 Rice plans envoy shift

 - More diplomats for India

 Washington, Jan. 19 (Agencies): Secretary of state Condoleezza Rice said yesterday she will start this year to shift some US diplomats from Europe to countries such as India and Lebanon to help some of them strengthen their democracies.

 In what she has termed transformational diplomacy, Rice outlined initially modest plans to boost the US presence in West Asia, Africa and parts of Asia in a realignment that recalled a similar, albeit larger, shift at the Pentagon. To advance transformational diplomacy, we are and we must change our diplomatic posture, Rice said.

 We will begin this year with a down payment of moving 100 positions from Europe and, yes, from here in Washington, DC, to countries like China and India and Nigeria and Lebanon, where additional staffing will make an essential difference, she said.

 Over the next few years, several hundred diplomats ? from a total of more than 6,000 worldwide ? would move to the new areas.

 India and China are among emerging nations shaping the course of history in 21st century, said Rice. In the 21st century, emerging nations like India, China, Brazil, Egypt, Indonesia and South Africa are increasingly shaping the course of history, she said 

 Rice used India as an example to show that the global posture of the US did not reflect the changing realities of international politics and the international system. 

 Our current global posture does not really reflect that fact. For instance, we have nearly the same number of state department personnel in Germany, a country of 82 million people, that we have in India, a country of one billion people, she said. 

 Diplomats must go beyond the ability of analysing political situation in the country of the posting, Rice added. They should be able to run democracy-related assistance in foreign countries, she said.

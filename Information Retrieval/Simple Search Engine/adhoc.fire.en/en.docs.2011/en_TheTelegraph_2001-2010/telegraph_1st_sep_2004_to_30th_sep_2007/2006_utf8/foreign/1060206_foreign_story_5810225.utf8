 Iran defiant, but talks door ajar

 Tehran, Feb. 5 (Agencies): A defiant Iran today ended snap UN checks of its nuclear sites and said it was resuming uranium enrichment, a day after being reported to the Security Council over concerns it is building nuclear weapons.

 However, the foreign ministry left the door ajar for talks. The door for negotiations is still open, foreign ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi said.

 Diplomats warned that any defiant response from Tehran could escalate the dispute over the nuclear ambitions of the worlds fourth biggest oil exporter. Tehran insists it needs nuclear technology only to generate electricity.

 Iran has stopped all voluntary measures that it undertook in the past two-and-a-half to three years, foreign minister Manouchehr Mottaki told a news conference. We have no commitment to the Additional Protocol any more.

 Irans main measure was the suspension of uranium enrichment. If enriched to a low level, uranium can be used in power stations. If enriched further to weapons-grade, it can be used in warheads.

 Iran signed the Additional Protocol to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 2003, thereby allowing short-notice inspections of its atomic sites.

 President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad delivered a statement to the people of Iran, read out by a newscaster on state television today, explaining why the country needed atomic technology.

 The range of applications of this science is so wide in fields such as industry, medicine, agriculture, environment and energy that it is impossible to reach high economic and social targets without it, he said.

 The International Atomic Energy Agency voted yesterday to report Iran to the Security Council, but the top UN body will take no action until an IAEA report on Iran is delivered in March.

 Ahmadinejad said nothing could deflect Tehrans pursuit of atomic know-how. Our enemies cannot do a damn thing. We do not need you at all. But you are in need of the Iranian nation.

 But foreign ministry spokesman Asefi said Tehran would have talks with Moscow on February 16. He added the timing of Irans resumption of a full atomic fuel cycle remained uncertain.

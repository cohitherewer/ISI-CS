 For Israelis, war is all about Jewish survival

 Jerusalem, July 31 (Reuters): 

 Israelis see the war against Hizbollah in stark terms. 

 Its about the survival of the Jewish state ? and that means showing Israels enemies, especially Iran, that any attack will be severely punished.

 That is why Israel is resisting mounting demands for an immediate ceasefire after an air strike killed 54 civilians, including 37 children, in a Lebanese village yesterday.

 It is why Israel will try to keep fighting Hizbollah until an international force has deployed in southern Lebanon, even though US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice said today she believed a truce could be forged this week.

 Israelis see Hizbollah as a proxy of Iran that every morning threatens us with extermination, said Yaron Ezrahi, a political science professor at Hebrew University in Jerusalem. This has triggered visions of the Holocaust and extermination. It explains why there has been such intense support here for the operation against Hizbollah.

 Many Israelis fear Hizbollah is the spear-tip of Iran, whom they accuse of trying to build nuclear bombs and whose President has said the Jewish state should be wiped off the map. Iran insists its nuclear programme is for civilian use.

 Although Iran funded and armed the Shia guerrilla group in the 1980s, it insists support now is only moral and political. Israel disputes this, saying Hizbollah is using Iranian missiles to target its northern regions.

 Even before the war with Hizbollah erupted on July 12, when the guerrillas abducted two Israeli soldiers in a cross-border raid, Israel saw Iran as its biggest security threat.

 Underscoring concern at what they see at stake in the conflict, Israeli editorial writers today urged Prime Minister Ehud Olmert not to cave in to international pressure following the deadly attack on Qana village in southern Lebanon. 

 Already the war has lasted three weeks. Israels defeat of the combined Arab armies of Egypt, Syria, Jordan and Iraq in the 1967 West Asia War took six days.

 Michael Oren, author of a book on that conflict and a senior fellow at the Shalem Center in Jerusalem, said Israelis believed the army had to send a powerful message to Hizbollah and Iran.

 While Hizbollah fighters were not about to march through the streets of Israeli cities as many feared the Arab armies would do in 1967, the stakes were just as high, he said.

 The fear is of being perceived as weak and vulnerable. Then when Iran acquires nuclear weapons Hizbollah can shell Israel with impunity and we will not be able to respond, Oren said. 

 Foreign investment would flee the country, tourists would not come. The country could be strangled economically. In essence it would be the destruction of the Jewish state.

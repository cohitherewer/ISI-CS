 Daily Variety critic Todd McCarthy said director Bryan Singer had imprinted the Warner Bros. movie with its own personality. Superman Returns is never self-consciously hip, ironic, post-modern or camp. To the contrary, its quite sincere, with an artistic elegance, he said. Routh won praise for his apparent effortlessness ? with his resemblance to Superman predecessor, the late Christopher Reeve, not going unnoticed.

 The movies plot has Superman returning to Earth following a mysterious absence of several years. Back home, an old enemy plots to render him powerless once and for all while the superheros great love, Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth), has moved on.

 Brown stakes claim as PM 

 Brown

 Manchester, Sept. 25 (Reuters): Finance minister Gordon Brown staked his claim today to be Britains next Prime Minister with a speech that eased some doubts about his ability to unite his beleaguered party and succeed Tony Blair.

 Setting out a broad vision in an eagerly-awaited speech to the Labour Partys annual conference, Brown pledged further rises in education spending, more devolution of government powers and support for the fight against global warming.

 He said he would keep the party firmly in the political centre if chosen to replace Blair when he steps down as party leader and premier within the next year.

 I am confident that my experience and my values give me the strength to take the tough decisions. I would relish the opportunity to take on David Cameron and the Conservative Party, Brown said to cheers.

 The youthful Cameron has rejuvenated the opposition Conservatives and put it ahead in the polls, but the next general election is not expected until at least 2009.

 Commentators say both Blair and Brown have been damaged by party feuding this month that forced Blair to say he would quit within a year and sparked fierce attacks on Browns character.

 Brown had long been seen as an automatic choice to step into Blairs shoes, but polls show support waning for a Brown premiership and doubts growing about his personality. That could tempt a prominent Labour politician to challenge Brown.

 It was the speech of a Prime Minister in waiting, said Labour politician John McFall. Somebody is going to have to be very good to challenge him.

 In an attempt to mend fences, Brown heaped praise on Blair for leading the Labour Party to three successive election victories.

 I would be determined to draw on all the talents of our party and country, he said in a speech that won a long, standing ovation from the audience, including Blair.

 Many were impressed by the speech. It was very, very good. It put to bed the whole issue of the conflict between himself and Tony (Blair), said a member of Parliament.

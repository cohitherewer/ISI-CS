 9/11 Atta with martyr will

 Atta

 London, Oct. 1 (PTI): A video of two 9/11 hijackers reading their martyrdom will at Osama bin Ladens headquarters in Afghanistan has emerged in the US, a British newspaper reported today.

 It is the first time that a videotape has appeared of Atta, the ring leader of the 9/11 kamikaze attacks. He flew an American Airlines plane five years ago into the north tower of the World Trade Center. 

 The video, The Sunday Times said, fills in a significant gap in the timing of the build-up to the attacks on the US. Dates on the tape show that Atta was filmed on January 18, 2000 together with Ziad Jarrah, the pilot of United Airlines flight 93, which crashed in Pennsylvania after the passengers apparently stormed the flight deck.

 The newspaper obtained a copy of the video through a previously tested channel. The tape has no sound track and a US source said that lip readers had tried without success to decipher what was being said. In the video, the duo were in high spirits, laughing and smiling in front of the camera. They appear relaxed, well-groomed and intelligent.

 Only when Atta, with an AK-47 propped on a wall beside him, reads a document marked in Arabic The Will, does he become solemn. Both are well-groomed without the haggard appearance of the identity mugshots released after September 11.

 The newspaper said the high-quality, unedited film shows bin Laden addressing his followers at the mud-walled complex near Kandahar. One of the main figures in the September 11 plot, Ramzi Binalshibh, is identifiable in the crowd, as is a bodyguard whose task was to kill bin Laden with two bullets to the head if he faced capture.

 Dating on the tape indicates that the al Qaida leader was filmed on January 8, 2000, 10 days before Atta and Jarrah recorded their wills.

 The report said investigators have struggled for five years to find evidence of Attas whereabouts in January 2000 after he disappeared from Hamburg.

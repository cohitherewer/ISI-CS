 Kathmandu, May 13 (AP): Nepals new government is planning to issue a proclamation that will curtail the kings powers and privileges, the finance minister said today, but he declined to confirm reports that the monarch might have to pay taxes for the first time. 

 A declaration of parliament asserting the sovereignty of the people and parliament, which would have the effect of a law, is being prepared by the government and is being discussed among the seven parties in the ruling alliance, finance minister Ram Saran Mahat said.

 The document will certainly curtail the kings power and privileges, this is certain, but what the specifics will be, we are discussing, mahat said. It is definitely in the cards but it will be thoroughly discussed.

 A government official separately said the details being discussed included asking the king to pay taxes and reduce his palace budget, which, according to media reports, grew from 120 million rupees (us$1.75 million) to 600 million rupees when he was running the government. The official spoke on condition of anonymity citing parliamentary propriety. Kings in nepal do not pay taxes.

 Mahat declined to confirm the details of the proclamation.

 I am sorry, I cannot go into the specifics, he said, adding that the proclamation would reflect the aspirations of the people. 

 Maoist talks

 Maoist chief Prachanda sought direct talks today with Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala to end the decade old revolt but demanded release of all Maoist prisoners before the dialogue.

 He also said a special assembly should be elected that should turn Nepal, the worlds only Hindu kingdom, into a secular state.

 If the talks are held, it would be the first time Prachanda, or the terrible one, would appear in public.

 Prachanda did not give any date for the proposed talks. There was no immediate comment from Koirala or his government but the response was expected to be positive.

 Prachanda has led a bloody war against the Hindu monarchy in Nepal in which more than 13,000 people have been killed.

 In his statement, the guerrilla chief also warned the government not to rescind from an agreement they reached in a loose deal against King Gyanendra last November ? the key point of which is a special assembly be elected to prepare a new constitution.

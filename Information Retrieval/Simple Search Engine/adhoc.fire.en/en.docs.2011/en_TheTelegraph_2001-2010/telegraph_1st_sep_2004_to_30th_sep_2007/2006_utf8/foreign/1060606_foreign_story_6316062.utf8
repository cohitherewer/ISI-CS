 Truck staff kidnap in Iraq

 Baghdad, June 5 (Reuters): Gunmen in police uniforms abducted up to 50 employees of Baghdad transport companies in broad daylight today as a crisis over filling key security posts deepened.

 They carried out what appeared to be a coordinated operation along a street that is home to several firms offering transport to Syria and Jordan, police said. It took them about five minutes to take people away. One, two, three, four ? one after another, said witness Hamza Ali, recalling the men with rifles and strapped with grenades who suddenly showed up in 10 pickup trucks.

 The motive for the abductions was unclear but businesses have been hit by kidnappers for reasons like ransom, revenge killings and religious rivalry. The abductions came a day after Iraqi leaders failed to agree on nominees for the interior and defence ministries. Iraqs political blocs had been expected to agree on names to be presented to parliament yesterday but a deal fell through and the assembly session was postponed, dealing a blow to new Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki. 

 The abductions in Baghdad showed how far Maliki has to go to establish law and order. They just rounded people up. They also took 15 Syrians. They called out my name but I ran away, said the witness.

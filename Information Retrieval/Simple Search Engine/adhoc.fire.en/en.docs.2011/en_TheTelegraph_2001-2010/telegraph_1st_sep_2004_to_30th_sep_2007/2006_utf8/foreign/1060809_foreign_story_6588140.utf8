 UK patient loses right to live case

 London, Aug. 8 (Reuters): A terminally-ill patient has lost the last stage of a legal challenge for the right to receive nutrition and drink when he is close to death, his lawyers said on today.

 Leslie Burke, 46, who has a degenerative brain condition, fears artificial nutrition could be stopped against his wishes when he cannot talk anymore.

 Burke was seeking to overturn a ruling made by the Court of Appeal in London last year, which said it would be lawful for doctors to refuse him artificial nutrition and hydration (ANH).

 But the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg said in a written judgment released to Burke and the UK government last week that it had declined his appeal.

 Burke learned of the courts decision while attending the funeral of his brother in Ireland who died after suffering from the same genetic condition, Friedreichs ataxia.

 The condition causes lack of coordination, but does not affect mental faculties. 

 The Strasbourg court said that it was satisfied that the presumption of UK law was in favour of prolonging life wherever possible in accordance with the spirit of the Convention on Human Rights, Burkes lawyers said.

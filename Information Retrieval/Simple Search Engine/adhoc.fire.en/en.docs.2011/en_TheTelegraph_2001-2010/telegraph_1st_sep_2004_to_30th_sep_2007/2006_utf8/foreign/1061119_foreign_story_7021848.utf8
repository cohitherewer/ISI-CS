 Ramayan threat

 Bangkok, Nov. 18 (AP): Thailands new military-appointed government is threatening to shut down an operatic version of the Ramayan epic over fears that one of scene may bring bad luck, the operas composer said.

 The opera, Ayodhya, premiered on Thursday night and is scheduled for a repeat performance later with the offensive scene toned down. The composer, Somtow Sucharitkul, said ministry officials officials approached him a few days before the shows opening night to complain about a scene involving the on-stage death of a key character, the demon-king, Thotsakan.

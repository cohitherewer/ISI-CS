 Study: Less fat no protection

 Healthy signs

 Chicago, Feb. 8 (Reuters): Women who ate less fat and more fruits, vegetables and grains did not reduce their risk of two types of cancer or heart disease, though they did show signs of being healthier, researchers said yesterday.

 The broad conclusion of the study ? that a healthier diet doesnt ward off disease ? drew criticisms from some experts who said it could be misinterpreted and taken as an excuse by some people to eat as much of anything they want.

 Editorials accompanying the three related studies published in the Journal of the American Medical Association pointed to the relatively healthy population of women in the study, and noted the women who modified their diets might have cut out fats found in fish and nuts now known to be healthy components of the Mediterranean diet.

 I encourage people to interpret this with caution because we have many unanswered questions, Dr Jeanette Keith of the University of Chicago said in a phone interview. She was not part of the study. Other outside experts described the large, multimillion-dollar, government-funded study as the most definitive to date, upending widely held beliefs that people can avoid disease by eating healthier foods.

 The same Womens Health Initiative study previously drew the surprising conclusion that hormone-replacement therapy carries heightened risks of health ailments such as stroke. This large randomised clinical trial provides the most definitive evidence to date of the impact of a low-fat diet, said Dr Michael Thun of the American Cancer Society. But Thun cautioned that proponents of low-fat diets could also draw positives from the findings.

 The women on healthier diets did suffer 9 per cent few cases of invasive breast cancer ? considered statistically insignificant ? and had 15 per cent less estradiol in their blood, a form of estrogen that raises the risk of breast cancer. And they had 9 per cent fewer self-reported colon polyps, which are precursors of colon cancer.

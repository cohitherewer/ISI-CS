 Spain binge

 Madrid, March 18 (Reuters): Mass street drinking sessions fuelled clashes between Spanish youths and riot police early today, leaving 80 people injured and 70 arrested in Barcelona and Salamanca, police said.

 Tens of thousands of young people gathered in cities around Spain last night in an attempt to hold the biggest street drinking session or botellon (big bottle). In the southern city of Granada, police said 25,000 people joined the botellon.

 The most serious violence was in Barcelona, Spains second city, where 68 people, including 37 police personnel, were injured and 54 rioters arrested.

 Barcelona police used baton charges and fired rubber bullets to try to control the youth, who had been throwing bottles and cans, according to media reports.

 Firemen were called out to 50 blazes as the youths set fire to rubbish containers in the streets. Shop windows were broken and several shops ransacked, media reports said.

 The Barcelona event degenerated into pitched battles between police and drinkers in the narrow old streets of the city centre.

 Police blamed the disturbances on about 200 people who, police said, were out to cause trouble. Another 12 people were injured and 16 arrested in clashes in the historic city of Salamanca, 180 km northwest of Madrid.

 Loyalty test for Muslims in Germany

 KATE CONNOLLY 

 Berlin, Jan. 1: Muslims 

 intent on becoming German citizens will have to undergo 

 a rigorous cultural test to gauge their views on subjects 

 ranging from bigamy to homosexuality. 

 Believed to be the first test 

 of its kind in Europe, the southern state of Baden-W uuml;rttemberg 

 has created the two-hour oral exam to test the loyalty of 

 Muslims towards Germany. 

 It is to be taken on top of the 

 standard test for foreigners wishing to become German citizens, 

 which includes language proficiency skills and general knowledge. 

 Those applying must also have resided in Germany for the 

 previous eight years and have no criminal record. 

 Germanys 15 other states 

 will see the progress of the policy after it begins this 

 week. 

 The 30 questions, which have been set by a special commission, 

 range from sexual equality to school sports and are meant 

 to trigger a more detailed discussion between the applicants 

 and officials. 

 Until now, all applicants have 

 simply had to tick a Yes or No box to answer whether they 

 felt loyalty to Germany. 

 But now they will be quizzed on 

 their attitudes to homosexuality and western clothing for 

 young women, and whether husbands should be allowed to beat 

 their wives. 

 Other questions covering topics such as bigamy and whether 

 parents should allow their children to participate in school 

 sports have been called trick questions, meant 

 to catch people off guard. 

 The state interior ministry said 

 the test would be used to filter out Muslims who were unsuited 

 for life in Germany. Those who answered correctly 

 but later acted against expected behaviour, such as wife-beating, 

 could have their citizenship removed. 

 Critics say that the test is biased 

 and discriminatory and that if Muslims are obliged to take 

 it, so should all applicants for citizenship. 

 Brigitte L ouml;sch, a member 

 of the Baden-Wurttemberg Parliament, called for the oral 

 exam to be dropped, arguing that it inferred from the outset 

 that all Muslims were violent per se and unable 

 to abide by German law. 

 This list of questions is 

 only to be used for applicants from Islamic countries. It 

 is an unbelievable form of discrimination, she said. 

 If Germans were asked some of the questions, they 

 would find it difficult to answer them. 

 The European Assembly of Turkish 

 Academics rejected the questionnaire as strongly discriminatory 

 and racist against Germanys three million-strong 

 Muslim population, most of whom are Turkish.

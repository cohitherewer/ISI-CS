 One-dose cure for malaria

 Zurich, May 23 (Reuters): Drugmaker Novartis aims to develop a one-dose cure for the most dangerous form of malaria in a public partnership to address one of the worlds top killer diseases, the Swiss company said today.

 Novartis is launching the project at its Institute for Tropical Diseases in Singapore to design a one-dose cure for Plasmodium falciparum, the most dangerous form of malaria, and a treatment for Plasmodium vivax, the most frequent and widely distributed cause of the disease.

 Malaria, which is spread by mosquitoes, infects over 250 million people and causes 1 million deaths per year, 90 per cent of them in Africa and mostly among children, experts said.

 The disease is also an economy killer, with the drain on African output estimated by the WHO at $12 billion yearly. 

 Even in wealthy countries, malaria is becoming dangerous largely due to the emergence of drug resistant parasites that render traditional anti-malarial drugs ineffective. The search for a cure for Africas number one killer has become a cause c??bre among pop stars, with Bono, the pop group U2 front man who has championed causes for poor countries, likening watching the fight against malaria to watching the first moonwalk.

 Novartis is already one of the biggest makers of antimalarial drugs. Its combination malaria treatment Coartem has a cure rate of above 95 per cent with very few side-effects.

 Under a public-private partnership with the WHO formed in 2001, Novartis provides Coartem at no profit for use in developing countries where malaria is endemic. 

 But increasing resistance to the disease ? as well as increasing public attention ? has fuelled efforts to prevent malaria by using insecticide-soaked bed nets, because mosquitoes bite at night, and to develop new cures.

 Still, researchers at the new Novartis initiative do not expect to deliver new treatments to market for 10-15 years due to the lengthy research and testing process.

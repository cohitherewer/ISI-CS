 Models too thin: Claudia

 Schiffer: Milk and chocolates

 Berlin, Oct. 20 (Reuters): 

 Claudia Schiffer believes models are now too skinny to be 

 attractive even though the German supermodel may herself 

 be slightly underweight despite a voracious appetite and 

 predilection for chocolate.

 It doesnt really look good any more, the 36-year-old was quoted as saying in an interview with Germanys Bunte magazine.

 Fashion looks good on thin models, but when you look at todays models you can not help but think there is something wrong. They are way too thin. It is only bones that stick out.

 Schiffer who was part of a powerful band of 1990s jet-setting supermodels that included Naomi Campbell, Cindy Crawford, Christie Turlington and Linda Evangelista was adding her voice to recent criticism of underweight models.

 Recently Madrid asked models below a certain weight to stay away from its fashion show. Models with a body-mass-index (BMI) which takes into account height and weight of less than 18 were banned. 

 Models have always been thin. But today, they are even thinner, which is unbelievable, said Schiffer, who has been on the cover of more than 550 magazines during her career.

 She said she was on the heavy side when she began in 1988. I was one of the fattest when I started, said Schiffer, who according to a German magazine website www.modellkartei.de nevertheless has a BMI of just under 18. The website lists Schiffer as 1.82 metres tall and weighing 58 kg .

 Ever since I started having children, I can eat whatever I want. I eat chocolate almost every day and drink whole milk so that I dont lose any more (weight), said Schiffer, who has two young children. 

 When the media started writing that I looked too thin and ill, I went to the doctor. He said I was healthy, she said. I didnt gain weight after the pregnancies. I hope it stays like that.

 Schiffer was born in Rheinberg, Germany, and began modelling in 1987, after being spotted in a Dsseldorf nightclub. Just weeks later she appeared in ELLE and within a short time she began modelling for Chanel.

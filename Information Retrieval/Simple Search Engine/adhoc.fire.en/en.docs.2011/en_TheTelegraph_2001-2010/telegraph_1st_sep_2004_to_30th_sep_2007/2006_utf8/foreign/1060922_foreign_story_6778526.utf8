 UK to allow larger bags on planes

 London, Sept. 21 (Reuters): Britain said yesterday it would allow air travellers to carry larger bags and large musical instruments on to planes but that a ban on non-essential liquids would remain.

 The UK banned most liquids and set smaller limits on carry-on bags last month following what police said was a foiled plot to blow up US-bound airliners leaving Britain.

 Following meetings with the industry and consultation with international partners, we can now introduce further changes to the current regime which will lessen the burden on passengers, while maintaining a rigorous security regime. These changes will take effect from tomorrow, Friday, the UKs Department for Transport said in a statement.

 The measures we introduced in August were in response to a very real and serious threat which continues, the department said.

 It said passengers would still be allowed just one item of hand baggage, but that the size limit had been increased to 56 cm by 45 cm by 25cm .

 Last month, the UK had imposed limits of 45cm by 35cm by 16 cm. Large musical instruments will now be allowed as a second item of hand luggage, it said.

 Aviation experts from the EUs 25 member states are set to review EU proposals for carry-on baggage on September 27, a spokesman for the European Commission said.

 The US Transportation Security Administration said last week it planned no immediate changes. Airline officials have urged governments on all sides to coordinate what steps they take.

 We are continuing to work closely with our international partners, both in Europe and more widely, including the European Commission, towards arrangements that are harmonised as far as possible, to help facilitate safe and secure international travel, the department said.

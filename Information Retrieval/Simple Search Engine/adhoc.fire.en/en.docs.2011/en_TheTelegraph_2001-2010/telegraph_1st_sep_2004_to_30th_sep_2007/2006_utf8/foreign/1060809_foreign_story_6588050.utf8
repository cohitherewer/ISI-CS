 Tired Lohan seeks Iraq trip

 New York, Aug. 8 (AP): Apparently a bit tired of her party-girl image, Lindsay Lohan says she wants to go to Iraq with Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and entertain American troops there.

 Ive been trying to 

 go to Iraq with Hillary Clinton for so long. Hillary was 

 trying to work it out, but it seemed too dangerous, 

 Lohan said in an interview in the September issue of Elle 

 magazine. The actress said she hoped to emulate Marilyn 

 Monroe, who performed shows for about 100,000 troops in 

 Korea in 1954.

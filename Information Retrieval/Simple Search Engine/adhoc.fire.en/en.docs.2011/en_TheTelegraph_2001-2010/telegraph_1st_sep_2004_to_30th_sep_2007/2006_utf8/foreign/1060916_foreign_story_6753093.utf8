 Ride on dream horse

 Toronto, Sept. 15 

 (Reuters): Like many boys of their generation, actors Pierce 

 Brosnan and Liam Neeson loved to play Cowboys and 

 Indians and watch western movies at the weekend matinee.

 So it was a dream come true for both Irishmen to co-star in Seraphim Falls, a western epic about revenge and forgiveness set in the 1860s, shortly after the US Civil War.

 When Pierce and I first got our costumes on, on horseback ... the pair of us were just giggling like schoolboys, Neeson said yesterday, the morning after Seraphim Falls had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival this week.

 In the movie, Neesons character, a former Confederate colonel chases Brosnan, a former Union army captain, from the Rocky Mountains to the desert to carry out his last mission: revenge for an atrocity.

 It was like realising a childhood dream, I mean that genuinely. I was steeped in the western genre as a kid. Playtime was always westerns: Audie Murphy westerns, all those B-movie westerns, and then graduated to John Ford films, Neeson said.

 Seraphim Falls was shot on a brisk schedule of 48 days in what the stars describe as treacherous terrain in the western US. In the first 20 minutes or so of the movie, Brosnan is shot, tumbles down a snowy mountainside into a river, and over a waterfall. The pursuit eventually continues into the desert.

 The film has very little dialogue and the two stars only filmed together in the same scenes for about five or six days. Brosnan spends most of the film by himself, trying to get away from his pursuer.

 For Brosnan, who plays the ex-Union captain, the Civil War-themed western brought up interesting parallels with the two actors Irish roots. Liams from the north and Im from the south, said Brosnan, best known for his role as secret agent James Bond, and who was nominated for a Golden Globe for last years role in The Matador.

 That period (of U.S. history) was build on the backs of many an Irish man and woman. There were huge Irish regiments in the Civil War, said Brosnan.

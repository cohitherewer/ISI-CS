 Gizmo gals outspend boys

 Washington, Dec. 3: Diamonds on a cellphone are a girls best friend.

 Hence bling kits of adhesive crystals to adorn phones. And T-Mobile, which swiftly sold out of its $400 Juicy Couture bejeweled pink phones, now has a limited-edition cellphone line designed by Diane von Furstenberg.

 Gucci bag? No, thank you. This year its about the Dolce amp; Gabbana Motorola V3i, a $400 golden-coloured phone so gilded and so thin it evokes a supermodel.

 Companies are trying to get technology in touch with its inner fashionista, marketing to the fairer sex by tickling them with pink and smaller, lighter and easier-to-use devices that speak to a more feminine sensibility.

 The upshot: Women who have historically wielded serious power of purse as consumers are now buying technology for their families and themselves, outspending their male counterparts 3 to 2, according to the Consumers Electronics Association (CEA).

 Todays prototypical girl-techie might look like Natavia Vineyard, 19, who wants her technology to cut a stylish and up-to-the-minute profile.

 I always have all the new phones, said the Lanham resident, who last month traded in an older flip phone for a new Sony Walkman phone. The features built-in media player, radio and video-camera appealed to her. But the black colour didnt. So she decked it out in faux diamonds. I try to keep it looking feminine.

 Its not a sexist stereotype; women have different preferences, according to a CEA study released this year. Men prefer to view their high-definition TVs, while women more frequently use their cellphones and portable games.

 Women come to the table with a different sensibility when they talk about technology, said Pat Houston, general manager of Yahoo Tech.

 They think less about the technology itself, and more how it fits with their life, he said. I would argue its the new gold standard it really is a more mainstream sensibility.

 The Nintendo Wii, one of the game systems flying off the shelves this season, was also designed in part to appeal to women.

 Its a reflection of a change in our corporate strategy a few years ago, when the company faced a diminishing audience for its games in Japan, and decided to reach beyond the young male demographic it had targeted, said George Harrison, senior vice-president of marketing for Nintendo of America.

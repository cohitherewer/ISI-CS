 California bans using phones while driving

 Oakland (California), Sept. 16 (Reuters): California yesterday banned motorists from talking on cellphones unless they use a headset or speakerphone, although the law will not take effect until July 1, 2008, to allow time to educate the public.

 Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, who signed the measure, urged Californians not to wait until then to put down their phones while driving, citing government data showing those who held their phones while driving were involved in 15 times more accidents than those with hands-free setups.

 The simple fact is that it is really dangerous to talk on a cellphone and drive at the same time, Schwarzenegger said. Its very important for people to know ... stop using the cellphone right now, because you are putting people at risk.

 Schwarzenegger joked he told his teenage daughter he would take her car away for years if he caught her talking on the phone while driving.

 I said I will be driving behind you sometimes and you will not know. I will be spying, he said.

 Violators will be fined $20 the first time they are caught and $50 the second time.

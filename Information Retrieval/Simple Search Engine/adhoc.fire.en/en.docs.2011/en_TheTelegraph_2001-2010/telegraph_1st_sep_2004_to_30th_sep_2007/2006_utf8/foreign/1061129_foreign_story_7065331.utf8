 Tigers in duel with army

 Colombo, Nov 28 (Reuters) - Sri Lankas military fought a fierce artillery duel with Tamil Tigers in the islands restive east early today, just hours after the rebels said they were resuming their two-decade independence struggle.

 The military said the Tigers were using 152-mm artillery shells for the first time to target their forward defence line in the eastern district of Batticaloa, and had killed one soldier and injured two others.

 Our defence lines have been mortared and shelled, said Major Upali Rajapakse, a spokesman with the Media Centre for National Security. They are using heavy, heavy guns. The army is retaliating with artillery. Rajapakse said a convoy of 60 trucks, carrying around 600 tonnes of food aid, had to turn back because of rebel artillery fire.

 India plea

 India today urged Sri Lanka to make quick progress in its peace process with the LTTE after Tamil Tiger chief V. Prabhakaran said his organisation was left with no option other than an independent state.

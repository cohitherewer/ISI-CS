 Afghan deaths over cartoons

 Kabul, Feb. 7 (Reuters): Afghan police killed four protesters today in some of the worst violence to erupt over satirical cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad which have provoked a deepening crisis between Europe and the Muslim world.

 Fresh protests erupted in West Asia, Asia and Africa today over the cartoons as leaders urged restraint and struggled to contain the protests, some of which in recent days turned from peaceful to volatile and bloody.

 In Iran, locked in a nuclear stand-off with the West and which has cut trade ties with Denmark where the cartoons were first published, a crowd pelted the Danish embassy in Tehran with petrol bombs and stones for a second day.

 After rioters set Danish missions ablaze in Syria and Lebanon at the weekend, the EU presidency issued a strongly-worded warning to 19 countries across West Asia that they are obliged to protect EU missions.

 Depicting the Prophet is prohibited by Islam but moderate Muslims, while condemning the cartoons, have expressed fears radicals are hijacking the affair which has developed into a clash over press freedom and religious respect. Militants in Iraq have called for the seizure and killing of Danes and the boycott of Danish goods over the cartoons. 

 In a new twist, Irans best-selling newspaper today launched a competition to find the best Holocaust cartoon. Denmark said today that the violent protests raised concerns for the safety of its troops in Iraq and Afghanistan but that it had no plans to withdraw them.

 Dutch government backs burqa ban

 The Hague, Nov. 17 (AP): The Dutch government, facing re-election next week, said today it plans to draw up legislation as soon as possible banning burqas and other clothing that covers the entire face in public places.

 The announcement puts the Netherlands, once considered one of Europes most welcoming nations for immigrants and asylum seekers, at the forefront of a general European hardening of attitudes toward Muslim minorities.

 The cabinet finds it undesirable that face-covering clothing including the burqa is worn in public places for reasons of public order, security and protection of citizens, immigration minister Rita Verdonk said.

 From a security standpoint, people should always be recognisable and from the standpoint of integration, we think people should be able to communicate with one another, Verdonk told national broadcaster NOS.

 Basing the order on security concerns apparently was intended to respond to warnings that outlawing clothing like the burqa could violate the constitutional guarantee against religious discrimination.

 The main Dutch Muslim organisation CMO has been critical of any possible ban. The idea was an overreaction to a very marginal problem because hardly any Dutch women wear burqas anyway, said Ayhan Tonca of the CMO. Its just ridiculous.

 This is a big law for a small problem, he said. Tonca estimated that as few as 30 women in the Netherlands wear a burqa and said the proposed law could be unconstitutional if it is interpreted as targeting Muslims.

 He also said that the security argument did not stand up. I do not think people who have bad things in their minds would wear a burqa, he said.

 In the past, a majority of the Dutch parliament has said it would approve a ban on burqas, but opinion polls in advance of national elections on November 22 suggest a shift away from that position, and it is unclear if a majority in the new parliament would still back the government-proposed ban.

 Amsterdams mayor, Job Cohen, of the Opposition Labour party, said he would like to see burqas disappear, though he did not advocate a ban. From a viewpoint of integration and communication, naturally its very bad, he said. 

 Former British foreign secretary Jack Straw recently caused a stir by saying he wants Muslim women to abandon the full-face veil a view endorsed by Prime Minister Tony Blair. In France, the Center-Rights leading presidential candidate Nicolas Sarkozy has increasingly been adopting some of the rhetoric of the extreme-Right.

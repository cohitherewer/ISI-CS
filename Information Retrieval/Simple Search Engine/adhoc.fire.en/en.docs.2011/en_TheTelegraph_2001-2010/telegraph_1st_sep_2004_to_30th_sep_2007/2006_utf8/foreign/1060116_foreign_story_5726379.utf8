 Emir who rebuilt Kuwait dies

 Sheikh Jaber

 Kuwait, Jan. 15 (Reuters): Kuwait ruler Sheikh Jaber al-Ahmad al-Sabah, who rebuilt his Gulf Arab state after US-led forces drove Saddam Husseins occupation troops from the country in 1991, died today at the age of 78.

 Kuwaits cabinet named the major oil producers ailing crown prince, Sheikh Saad al-Abdulla al-Sabah, as its ruler after the emirs death from a long illness.

 Analysts expected no change in Kuwaits oil policies and pro-Western outlook under the 76-year-old new emir, who is largely incapacitated by illness. 

 He is likely to be a figurehead while Prime Minister Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah runs the country ? a role he has played over the past four years. Kuwait sits on about one-tenth of the worlds proven oil reserves.

 The analysts said Sheikh Saads appointment was aimed at averting a crisis within the ruling family, which traditionally must alternate the leadership between its two branches.

 Sheikh Jaber suffered a brain haemorrhage in 2001, which limited his duties in the country. He fled to Saudi Arabia in 1990 when Iraqi troops invaded but returned after the occupation ended to lead the rebuilding of a land scarred by killing, torture and brutal Iraqi rule. 

 US-led forces used Kuwait as its main staging ground for the 2003 invasion of Iraq that toppled Saddam.

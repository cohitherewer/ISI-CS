 Bangla stays firm on polls

 Dhaka, Dec. 12 (Reuters): Bangladesh swore in three new government advisers today after the countrys election chief vowed polls would go ahead as scheduled next month.

 The moves did little to reduce political tension in a nation where at least 44 people have been killed and hundreds injured in clashes between feuding political parties ahead of the January 23 parliamentary elections.

 One of the main contenders for the polls, the Awami Leagues Sheikh Hasina, hinted she was still considering a boycott. 

 I wonder whether we should participate in the election under the changing political circumstances, she told a news conference. 

 Thousands of Awami League activists and their allies staged a protest today against the appointment of the three advisers a day after four other advisers quit following differences over the deployment of the armed forces in the run-up to the polls.

 After compelling the neutral four to leave, now the President has appointed three advisers who are likely to be more loyal to him, a senior Awami leader and former minister Tofayel Ahmed told the rally.

 This will further complicate the situation.

 Protesters burned portraits of President Iajuddin Ahmed and chanted elections will be resisted unless corrupt election officials are removed and the administration made neutral.

 The rally ended peacefully but security was tight.

 Acting chief election commissioner Mahfuzur Rahman insisted late today that the polls would go ahead as required by the constitution.

 Feuding political parties are squabbling over almost every aspect of the election from the make up of the organising commission to wildly inaccurate voter rolls.

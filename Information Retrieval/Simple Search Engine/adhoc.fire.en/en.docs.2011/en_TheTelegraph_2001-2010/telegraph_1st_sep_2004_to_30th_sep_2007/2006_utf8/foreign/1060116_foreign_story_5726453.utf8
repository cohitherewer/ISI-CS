 Chile awaits maiden moment

 Santiago, Chile, Jan. 15 (Reuters): Chileans voted for a new President today and were expected to elect the South American countrys first woman leader, a socialist who is seen beating a moderate conservative billionaire.

 Michelle Bachelet, 54, a doctor and former defence minister imprisoned and tortured during the 1973-1990 Augusto Pinochet dictatorship, had a five-point lead over opponent Sebastian Pinera in a poll published this week.

 If she wins, Bachelet will be the fourth consecutive President from the centre-Left coalition that formed in the 1980s to oppose Pinochet and has run the copper-producing country of 16 million people since he stepped down in 1990.

 Polls opened at 8 am (1100 GMT) and were to start closing eight hours later. The first results are expected at around 6.30 pm (2130 GMT).

 Today is the day of the citizens. Its their decision. Were very calm and very optimistic, Bachelet said before entering a polling station in eastern Santiago to vote.

 A Bachelet victory would consolidate a shift to the Left in Latin America, where leftists now run Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Venezuela, some with politics more extreme than others. A socialist will soon take office in Bolivia and a Leftist is favoured to win Mexicos presidential election.

 Last month, Bachelet won 46 per cent of the vote in a four-way first-round. That was short of the absolute majority she needed to avoid a January runoff against Pinera, who came won 25 per cent.

 Bachelet pledges deep reforms to Chiles private pension system, which is admired around the world as a model but considered expensive and inadequate at home.

 While Latin American elections often give investors jitters, markets have taken Chiles campaign in stride, confident that whoever wins will follow the prudent fiscal policies that have helped make it the regions most stable economy.

 Bachelet would be only the second woman elected to head a South American state, and the first who was not the widow of a former President.

 Pinera, a former investment banker and senator who heads a rightist alliance, said the country needs a change after 16 years under the center-Left Concertacion coalition.

 With one of Latin Americas lowest poverty rates, Chiles biggest concerns are crime and unemployment. On the campaign trail Pinera pledged to create one million jobs and 12,000 more police.

 Hes a super-intelligent guy and he has money so hes not going to rob the country. Hes going to give jobs to extremely poor housewives. The country needs a change, said Elizabeth Ortega, a 32-year-old paramedic, after voting in Santiago.

 Polls show that most Chileans ? an austere, skeptical people ? find Bachelet more trustworthy than Pinera.

 The agnostic woman with three children from two relationships has also benefited from a shift to more secular values in the predominantly Roman Catholic country.

 Bachelet is benefiting from the popularity of outgoing President Ricardo Lagos and a cycle of economic prosperity in Chile, a mining giant enjoying record high prices for copper.

 Under Chilean law Lagos could not run for another term, but admirers applauded him on Sunday after he voted in downtown Santiago, chanting2010, meaning he should run next time around. (Additional reporting by Lisa Yulkowski)

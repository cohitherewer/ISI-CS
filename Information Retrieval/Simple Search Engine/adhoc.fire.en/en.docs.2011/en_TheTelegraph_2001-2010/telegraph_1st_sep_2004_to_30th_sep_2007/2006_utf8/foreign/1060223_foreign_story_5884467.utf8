 Cartoon on leaflets

 London, Feb. 22 (Reuters): The far-right British National Party today said it would distribute leaflets showing a cartoon of Prophet Mohammad, a move Muslim groups said would provoke protests and was playing with fire.

 A spokesman for the tiny fringe party, which has no seats in Parliament but a handful on local councils, said its use of the image was not intended to cause offence, but illustrated how Islam and Western values did not mix.

 The party says it is not racist, but its leader Nick Griffin and another activist are facing race-hate charges.

 The cartoon is one of 12 which first appeared in a Danish daily and were later reprinted in other European countries, sparking violent protests across the Islamic world.

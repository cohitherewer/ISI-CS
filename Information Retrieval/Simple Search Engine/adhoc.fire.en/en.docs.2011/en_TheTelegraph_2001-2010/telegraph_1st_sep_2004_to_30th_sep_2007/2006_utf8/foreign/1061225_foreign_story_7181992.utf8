 Iraq police shot Indians

 Karbala, Dec. 24 (AFP): The three Indian and 11 Pakistani pilgrims killed in Iraq in September were shot not by militants but by two police officers, the government said today.

 Iraqi police have arrested the officers who have confessed to dragging the pilgrims off their bus on September 2 and shooting them.

 The killings came amid sectarian clashes between Shias and Sunnis in Iraq. The pilgrims were Shias travelling to the shrine city of Karbala. Sunni insurgent group Ansar al Sunna had claimed responsibility for the murders.

 A police spokesman said the two officers had confessed their responsibility in this killing but did not explain the motive.

 The slain Indians were Jafar Mahsadi, 38, Mohammad Baig, 42, and Mohammad Ahmed Ali, 45, of Hyderabad.

 Peter Pan sequel rush

 London, July 14 (Reuters): When the authorised sequel to J.M. Barries childrens classic Peter Pan is published in October, it will not be the only adaptation of the original vying for attention in book stores.

 Childrens author Geraldine McCaughrean has finished writing Peter Pan in Scarlet and has given the first hints about what happens to Peter and his young friends in the eagerly awaited follow-up to the 1911 original.

 Great Ormond Street Hospital, the owner of copyright for Peter Pan since 1929, is hoping to raise money from the official sequel before its remaining rights on the novel, in the EU, run out at the end of 2007. 

 But they will face competition from other adaptations written in the US, where the veto on the novel does not apply. Disney has already published a prequel to Peter Pan, called Peter and the Starcatchers, and will release another adaptation called Peter and the Shadow Thieves tomorrow, according to its website www.peterandthestarcatchers.com.

 I think its a shame about the timing, as it is not going to do any kindnesses to the official sequel, said McCaughrean, who was chosen from around 200 authors to write the official sequel.

 But she was confident that her version, published on October 5, would hold its own. 

 McCaughrean said she had kept as many of the original characters as possible, including Peter, Wendy, the Lost Boys and Tinker Bell, and the action would be again set in Neverland. But asked if there was a return for the villainous Captain Hook, last seen disappearing down the throat of a crocodile, she replied:Youll have to wait and see. Great Ormond Street officials say McCaughrean has maintained the integrity of the original characters, whereas other versions tended to play down the darker aspects of Barries story.

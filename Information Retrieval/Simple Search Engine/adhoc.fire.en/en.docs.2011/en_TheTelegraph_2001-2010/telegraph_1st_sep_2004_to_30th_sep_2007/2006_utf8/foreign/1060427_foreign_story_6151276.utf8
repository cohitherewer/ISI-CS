 Bush critic is his spokesman

 Snow

 Washington, April 26 (Reuters): President George W. Bush named Fox News Radio host Tony Snow as White House press secretary today in his latest move aimed at giving his staff a new look and breathing new life into his presidency.

 Snow, 50, is the first Washington pundit to become White House press secretary and in his role as a conservative commentator he has sometimes criticised the President.

 A cancer survivor, Snow is the first journalist to go directly from the media industry to the top spokesman role since Ron Nessen during Richard Nixons presidency.

 He inherits one of the toughest jobs in Washington: Trying to manage the flow of White House information in an era of 24-hour news cycles, and put a fresh face on a struggling White House.

 Hes going to work hard to provide you with timely information about my philosophy, my priorities, Bush said in the White House.

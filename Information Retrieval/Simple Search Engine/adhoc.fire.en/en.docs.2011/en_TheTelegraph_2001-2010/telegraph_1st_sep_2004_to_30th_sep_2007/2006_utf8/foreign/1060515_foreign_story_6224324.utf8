 Depp best in autograph poll

 Depp: Write stuff

 Los Angeles, May 14: Johnny Depp has the write stuff when it comes to signing autographs while Cameron Diaz is the worst, according to a new list from Autograph Collector magazine. 

 Depp, followed by George Clooney, topped the magazines 14th annual survey of Hollywoods best and worst signers. The Pirates of the Caribbean star also was rated best last year. 

 Many stars become bad signers once fame and fortune hits, but not Depp. Hes even signed autographs for crowds at the airport while carrying luggage, said Steve Cyrkin, editor and publisher of the Santa Ana, a California-based magazine. 

 As for Clooney, hell joke as he signs, and make fun of how he looks in photos hes handed to autograph. 

 When it comes to her moniker, however, Diaz gets a flunking grade. 

 Cameron Diaz may be a talented actress, but shes persistently a terrible signer. 

 Instead of just turning down a persons autograph request, shell lecture them about how dumb autographs are, Cyrkin said. 

 Russell Crowe would have been named as the best of the worst but in recent months he has been much nicer to fans, Cyrkin said.

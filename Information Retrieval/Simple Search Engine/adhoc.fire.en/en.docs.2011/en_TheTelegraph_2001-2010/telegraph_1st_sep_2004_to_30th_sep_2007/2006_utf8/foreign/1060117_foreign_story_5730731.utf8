 New Delhi, Jan. 16: Irked by Iranian nuclear negotiator Ali Larijanis reference to Indias nuclear programme, Delhi today told Tehran that every state must fully comply with its international obligations and commitments in a transparent manner.

 This is the first time India has officially reacted to the Iran nuclear issue since the new round of confrontation with the West has unfolded. The provocation was the reference made by Larijani, the secretary of Irans supreme national council, about India in a recent interview. 

 Larijani had criticised the US for maintaining relations with India, which also possessed nuclear weapons. It does have nuclear weapons but they (the US) have extensive relations in the nuclear field. This dual standard is detrimental to international security, Larijani was quoted as saying in the interview.

 He had also said the West was putting pressure on Iran when some other countries made nuclear bombs without adhering to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) or signing the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. 

 In a sharp reaction, the spokesperson for the Indian external affairs ministry said: We regret the reference to India. We have consistently maintained that it is a states sovereign right to enter into treaties and international agreements. Every state must fully comply with its international obligation and commitments in a transparent manner. 

 India had maintained a stoic silence on the Iran issue even as it came under pressure from the West for breaking UN seals on a nuclear enrichment facility last week.

 Delhi had voted against Iran last September on an IAEA resolution, triggering protest from the Left allies of the UPA government.

 India will have to make up its mind again whether to refer Iran to the Security Council when the IAEA board meets in the first week of February.

 The Iran issue will also figure prominently during the next round of Indo-US nuclear talks slated to be held later this week.

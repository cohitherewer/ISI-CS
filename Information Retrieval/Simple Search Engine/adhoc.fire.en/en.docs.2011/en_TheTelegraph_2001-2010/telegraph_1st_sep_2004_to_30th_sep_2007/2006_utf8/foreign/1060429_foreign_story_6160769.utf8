 Tabloids say William to propose to girlfriend

 Kate: Caribbean holiday 

 London, April 28 (Reuters): Tabloid newspapers are speculating that Britains Prince William, 23, is about to propose to his girlfriend Kate Middleton on holiday in the Caribbean.

 The elder son of heir to the throne Prince Charles and the late Princess Diana is flying to the West Indian island of Mustique today to join the 24-year-old Middleton, the Evening Standard reported today.

 The London newspaper, which broke the news of Camilla Parker Bowless engagement to Prince Charles, said William sought advice on the best place to hide away from prying paparazzi lenses.

 Mustique was the favourite holiday destination of Williams great aunt, Princess Margaret. 

 Feverish speculation about a royal engagement began in The Mail on Sunday with the banner headline: Kate takes William on holiday ? but will he pop the question? William has in the past said he did not want to get married until he is at least 28 or 30 but the paper breathlessly reported they could be just weeks away from being engaged.

 But Judy Wade, royal correspondent for the celebrity gossip magazine Hello, felt the rumour mill was over-reaching itself.

 I think this romance is serious but today young couples live together for a while. And William wants to be sure, and not have a disaster like his parents, she said.

 Asked to confirm the Evening Standard report of the romantic Caribbean tryst, a spokesman for William said: We never comment on private holidays.

 The pair met while studying at the University of St Andrews in Scotland.

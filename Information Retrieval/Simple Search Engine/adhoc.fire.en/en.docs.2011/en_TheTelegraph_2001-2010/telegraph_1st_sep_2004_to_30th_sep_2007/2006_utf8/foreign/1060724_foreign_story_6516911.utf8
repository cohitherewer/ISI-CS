 Saddam fed by force

 Baghdad, July 23 (Reuters): Saddam Hussein was taken to hospital and given food today after 16 days on hunger strike and will not attend court tomorrow, the chief prosecutor in the former Iraqi leaders trial for crimes against humanity said.

 To avoid a deterioration in his health, he was taken to hospital for medical attention and food was given to him through his mouth, Jaafar al-Moussawi told Reuters. He will not be able to attend the session tomorrow.

 Conflicting reports on Saddams health and his lawyers refusal to attend the next court session highlighted the chaotic nature of his trial, which is approaching its conclusion.

 Earlier, a US military spokesman said Saddam was well enough to return to court on Monday in response to a report that he had been taken to hospital.

 Right now, we consider that the defendants are in a condition where they can return to court, he said.

 Hes continuing with his hunger strike and we are providing appropriate medical care.

 The US military says the 69-year-old ex-president has been drinking sweet coffee and liquid nourishment and receiving psychological counselling to try to persuade him to eat.

 Saddam and his co-accused are on trial for the killing of 148 Shia men and teenagers after an attempt on his life in the town of Dujail in 1982.

 He is also awaiting trial in August for genocide against the Kurds in the late 1980s under the so-called Anfal campaign.

 The Dujail trial, which US and Iraqi officials had hoped would project a new image of democracy in post-war Iraq, has been marred by the killing of three defence lawyers.

 Saddam and his half-brother and former intelligence chief Barzan al-Tikriti have often launched tirades in the chamber in a trial which saw the resignation of the first chief judge in protest over what he called government interference.

 Saddams chief defence lawyer accused US military authorities of force feeding the toppled president to make him end the hunger strike.

 The US military are force feeding the president to break his will and end his hunger strike to protest against the trial and its illegality, Khalil Dulaimi told Reuters in Amman.

 Dulaimi said he found Saddam in good health on Saturday, despite a weight loss of several kilograms.

 Car bombs kill 56

 Car bombs killed at least 56 people in Iraq today as Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki prepared for a White House visit expected to focus on easing violence that has raised doubts over his reconciliation efforts.

 A blast killed 36 civilians in a Shia district of Baghdad. Another car bomb exploded in the northern city of Kirkuk, killing at least 20 civilians outside a court house, police and witnesses said.

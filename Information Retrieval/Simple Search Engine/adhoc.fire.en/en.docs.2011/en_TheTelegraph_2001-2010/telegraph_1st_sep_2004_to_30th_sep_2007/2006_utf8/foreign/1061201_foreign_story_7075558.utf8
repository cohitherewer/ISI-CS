 Nicole tops salary list

 Kidman: Daring rise

 Los Angeles, Nov. 30 (Reuters): Nicole Kidman was Hollywoods highest-paid actress in 2006, nudging Americas sweetheart, Julia Roberts, from the top spot for the first time in five years, according to an annual showbiz earnings list.

 Kidman, an Oscar winner for her 2002 portrait of Virginia Woolf in The Hours, commands an estimated $16 million to $17 million per movie after a string of daring roles over the past year, entertainment trade paper The Hollywood Reporter said yesterday. Kidman, 39, who was born in Hawaii but grew up in her parents native Australia, is currently playing photographer Diane Arbus in the independently produced film Fur.

 Kidmans acting fee still falls short of the $20 million per movie earned by fellow Oscar winner Roberts, 39, before the Erin Brockovich star put her blockbuster film career on hold to marry and have children. Roberts gave birth to twins in November 2004.

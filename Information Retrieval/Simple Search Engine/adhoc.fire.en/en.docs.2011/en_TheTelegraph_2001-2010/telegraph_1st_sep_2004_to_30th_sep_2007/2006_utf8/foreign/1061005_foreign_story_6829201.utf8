 US detection

 Washington, Oct. 4 (Reuters): 

 The US has detected activity at potential test sites in 

 North Korea indicating possible preparations for a nuclear 

 test, but the evidence is not definitive, a US defence official 

 said today.

 US spy satellites have picked up unusual movement of vehicles and other activity at these locations that might occur before a nuclear test, said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.

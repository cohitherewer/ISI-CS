 Key Iran dissident freed

 Tehran, March 18 (Reuters): Irans most prominent political dissident, Akbar Ganji, has been released after six years in prison for criticising some of the most powerful figures in the Islamic Republic, his lawyer said today.

 Ganji, a journalist, was jailed in 2000 for articles linking senior officials to the serial killings of dissidents in 1998. His articles particularly targeted influential cleric Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, Irans president from 1989 to 1997.

 A smiling but thin and heavily-bearded Ganji welcomed reporters into his Tehran apartment. He stuck to pleasantries and sidestepped politics. Thanks for coming, he said. I am so sorry it is such a small place.

 Lawyer Youssef Mowlaie said Ganji was freed late yesterday. He predicted a legal wrangle over whether Ganji would be returned to Tehrans feared Evin prison for a few more days. Mowlaie said he reckoned Ganjis jail term ended on March 17, but a senior judiciary official disagreed.

 Currently, he is on leave and his sentence will end on March 30, Mahmoud Salarkia, deputy prosecutor-general for prison affairs, told the official Irna news agency.

 Salarkia said Ganji was allowed to return home for a week to mark the Iranian New Year holiday which starts on Monday night, but Ganjis wife insisted her husband was home for good.

 Iran rejected Ganjis allegations that senior officials were responsible for the dissidents killings, blaming rogue elements within the intelligence ministry.

 Ganji spent stints in solitary confinement and fell gravely ill in July, weakened by a hunger strike aimed at persuading authorities to release him. 

 Ganji, born in 1959, was a devoted follower of the 1979 Islamic revolution and served in the hardline Revolutionary Guards. He has been criticised for his propaganda work and his surveillance of Iranian student activities in Turkey.

 Islamabad, April 30 (Reuters): Pakistan has released a key aide to disgraced nuclear scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan after holding him for more than two years in a probe into a nuclear blackmarket scandal, the military said today.

 Authorities detained about a dozen men for questioning after the scandal involving the father of the Pakistans atom bomb came to light in late 2003. Later, all but Mohammad Farooq, director of procurement at a uranium-enrichment laboratory established by Khan near Islamabad, were released.

 Military spokesman Major-General Shaukat Sultan said Farooq was released last week. He has gone home. (But) he has been advised to stay home and restrict his movements for the sake of his own security.

 Khan, praised at home for his role in developing a nuclear weapon, confessed in February 2004 that he sold nuclear secrets to Libya, Iran and North Korea.

 The government sacked him as special adviser but President Pervez Musharraf pardoned him.

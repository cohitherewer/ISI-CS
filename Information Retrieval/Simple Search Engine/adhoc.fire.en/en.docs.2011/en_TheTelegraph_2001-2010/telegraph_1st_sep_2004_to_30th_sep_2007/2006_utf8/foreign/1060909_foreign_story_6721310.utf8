 Tiger war cry

 Colombo, Sept. 8 (Reuters): 

 Sri Lankas Tamil Tigers told the government today 

 to immediately withdraw from a rebel stronghold it seized 

 this week or face war.

 The army captured the territory on the southern edge of the strategic Trincomalee harbour in the northeast of the country on Monday after days of artillery battles. It was the first major capture of territory by either side since a 2002 ceasefire.

 We perceive the Sri Lankan armed forces occupying our territory as tantamount to a declaration of war, S. Puleedevan, head of the rebels peace secretariat, said. He added that the Tigers would launch a counter-attack and evict the army from Sampur if it did not withdraw immediately, adding that the ceasefire agreement was in tatters.

 The conflict is already widening all over the northeast, the Tamil homeland, Puleedevan said by a satellite phone.

 So far, we have tried very hard to maintain restraint, not to launch offensive attacks, but there are limits.

 Until now, and despite heavy fighting in recent weeks, the government and the rebels had been insisting that they continued to stand by the terms of a 2002 truce.

 But the foes blame each other for trying to force a full-scale return to a war that has killed more than 65,000 people since 1983.

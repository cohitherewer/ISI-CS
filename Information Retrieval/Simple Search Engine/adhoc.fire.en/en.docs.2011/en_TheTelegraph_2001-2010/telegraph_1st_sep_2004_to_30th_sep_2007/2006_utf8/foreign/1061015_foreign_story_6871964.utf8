 Soaked solution

 Asuncion (Paraguay), Oct. 14 (Reuters): Young entrepreneurs in Paraguay say they have a new weapon against pesky, and potentially dangerous, mosquitos cotton shirts soaked in lemon-scented citronella oil.

 The woven, collared shirts typical of this landlocked South American nation were launched this week by the surfer-inspired Pombero brand. Citronella oil comes from a perfumed grass and acts as an insect repellent.

 This is a product aimed at people who enjoy being in the fresh air and in contact with nature, but who want to maintain a sophisticated style, said company owner Rodrigo Jacks. He added the shirts can be washed up to 40 times before losing their power to repel mosquitos and other critters, like fleas.

 Insect repellent sold in the US is coated in permethrin, a man-made derivative of the chrysanthemum plant. Government scientists are interested in finding out whether they could provide extra protection from malaria or dengue.

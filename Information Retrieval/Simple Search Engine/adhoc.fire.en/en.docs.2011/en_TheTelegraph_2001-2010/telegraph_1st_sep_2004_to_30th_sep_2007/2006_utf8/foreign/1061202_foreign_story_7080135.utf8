 Pro-women rape law gets Pervez seal

 IMTIAZ GUL 

 Islamabad, Dec. 1: President Pervez Musharraf today signed a new law that will bring solace to Pakistani women by safeguarding their constitutional and legal rights.

 The new act comes into force at once with signing of the Protection of Women (Amendment) bill by the President, parliamentary affairs minister Sher Afgan told reporters in Islamabad.

 The National Assembly and the Senate had last month approved the bill amid stout resistance by the Islamic political alliance, Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal (MMA), which described the legislation as un-Islamic.

 The act annuls the Hudood Ordinance, promulgated in 1979 by the military dictator of the day, General Zia-ul Haq. Some of the clauses of the ordinance dealt with rape and adultery. In almost all rape cases, the (female) victim was required to produce four witnesses to prove the charge, or face prosecution for adultery. 

 The main amendment approved by the countrys parliament takes rape out of the sphere of religious law and places it under the penal code, thus doing away with the requirement for four male witnesses and allowing convictions to be made on the basis of forensic and circumstantial evidence.

 But the MMA is strongly opposed to any amendments in the Hudood Ordinance. It says the ordinance is in line with Quranic teachings and, therefore, must not be touched.

 The signing of the new decree by the President comes in the backdrop of continued countrywide protests by the MMA against approval of the bill by the parliament.

 Even yesterday, the police detained scores of MMA activists in Lahore for attempting to hold a protest rally against the bill.

 The MMA chief, Qazi Hussein Ahmad, has already stated that the alliance members would formally announce, during the alliances supreme council meeting scheduled for December 6-7 in Islamabad, that they would resign from the federal legislature.

 However, legislators from the Jamiatul Ulema-e-Islam (JUI), one of the component parties of the alliance, have been showing reluctance to resign from the lower house.

 The chief of the pro-Taliban JUI and opposition leader in the National Assembly Maulana Fazal-ur-Rehman reportedly opposed the idea during the last two meetings of the Supreme Council. 

 Observers believe that Rehmans opposition was mainly driven by fears that resignations might create serious political problems for the alliance, which rules the conservative North West Frontier Province (NWFP) and shares power in the government with Pakistan Muslim League (Q) in Balochistan.

 Rehman had said after approval of the bill by the National Assembly that the MMA would take a final decision if its members should resign from the Assembly or not after consulting constitutional experts on the issue.

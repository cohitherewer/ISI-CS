 Islamabad, Nov. 13: The Islamist-dominated Assembly in Pakistans North Western Frontier Province (NWFP) today approved the amended Hisba or accountability bill that would enforce a Taliban-style government in the state.

 The bill was first passed by the provincial Assembly in July last year. However, it could not be enforced after the Pakistan supreme court said at least five clauses of the bill were unconstitutional.

 The provincial government completely ignored ruling of the supreme court while reintroducing the law in the Assembly, private TV channel Geo TV quoted information minister Muhammad Ali Durrani as saying in Islamabad.

 However, the Islamist government, led by the religious alliance Muttahida Majlis-e-Ammal (MMA), said it had drafted the Hisba Bill anew in light of recommendations made by the supreme court before presenting it to the provincial Assembly.

 This bill has been prepared according to the provisions of the constitution and the directives of the supreme court, NWFP law minister Malik Zafar Azam said after the provincial Assembly passed the bill despite opposition from liberal groups. Virtues will be promoted and vices will be discouraged, he said.

 Durrani said the central government would challenge the new legislation if it was found to be unconstitutional.

 Keep weight down, eat less meat

 London, March 14 (Reuters): If you want to keep the weight down, switch to a meat-free diet, scientists said today.

 Researchers who studied the eating habits of 22,000 people over five years, including meat eaters and vegetarians, found they all put on a few kilos but meat eaters who changed to a vegetarian or vegan diet gained the least.

 Contrary to current popular views that a diet low in carbohydrates and high in protein keeps weight down, we found that the lowest weight gain came in people with high intake of carbohydrates and low intake of protein, said Prof. Tim Key.

 The research compared weight gain among meat eaters, fish eaters, vegetarians and vegans ? who eat no animal products ? and is published in the International Journal of Obesity.

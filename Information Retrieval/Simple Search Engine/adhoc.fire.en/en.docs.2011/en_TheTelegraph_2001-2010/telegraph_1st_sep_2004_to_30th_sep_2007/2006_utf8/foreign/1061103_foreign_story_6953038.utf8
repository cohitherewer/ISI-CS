 Probe into Nepal Kumari custom

 Kathmandu, Nov. 2 (Reuters): Nepal plans to investigate whether a centuries-old tradition of worshipping a virgin girl as a living goddess or Kumari has violated the childs human rights, a senior official said today.

 The move comes after Nepals supreme court ordered the government to submit a detailed report within three months.

 Such a study will be good for the Kumari system, said Madhav Prasad Ghimire, the most senior bureaucrat in the ministry of culture. It is a unique culture of ours and one of Nepals identities.

 If there are any practices that violate human rights those should be improved.

 Under a tradition followed for centuries in the Kathmandu valley, a girl as young as four or five from the Buddhist Shakya family is chosen through a rigorous religious process to serve as Kumari or the living goddess.

 She has to leave her family and stay in a 15th century temple in Kathmandus Basantapur area, noted for its ancient monuments. Buddha also came from a Shakya family.

 Many Nepali Hindus and Buddhists consider Kumari as an embodiment of Taleju Bhavani, the goddess of strength.

 During festivals the girl, dressed in red and gold coloured costumes with a third eye painted on her forehead, is carried in a chariot through the capital, home to 1.5 million people. She is also revered by the king, who was traditionally considered an incarnation of Vishnu.

 Her divine status is retained until the girl starts menstruating after which she goes back to her family and is replaced by a new child. Critics say the child is denied a normal life and the practice violates her fundamental human rights. 

 It requires the child to live away from her family, restricts contacts, deprives her of normal social as well as family life and regular schooling, said Pundevi Maharjan, a lawyer and human rights activist.

 But others disagree. This raises the status of the child as divine, said Subarna Keshari Chitrakar, president of Nepal Bhasha Misha Khala, a group that promotes the Newari language and culture. The girl is given proper care, education and lives with dignity, she said.

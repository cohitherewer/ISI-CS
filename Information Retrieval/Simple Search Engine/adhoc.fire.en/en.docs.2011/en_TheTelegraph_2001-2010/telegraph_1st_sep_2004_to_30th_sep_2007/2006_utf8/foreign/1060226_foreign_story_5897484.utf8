 Fresh Hillary hint of White House run

 ALEC RUSSELL

 Clinton: Ready for war

 Washington, Feb. 25: Hillary Clinton has recruited two loud-mouthed consultants who masterminded her husbands back from nowhere presidential run in a clear hint at her own White House ambitions.

 James Carville, known as the Ragin Cajun, for his no-holds-barred approach and Louisianan roots, became the worlds most sought-after election adviser after Bill Clintons 1992 victory.

 Officially, he and his long-time partner, Paul Begala, have been hired by Hillary Clinton to raise funds for her campaign for re-election as a senator for New York state in November.

 But as she already has nearly ?10 million in the bank ? against the ?138,000 raised by her probable Republican challenger ? she seems to be trying for the White House. 

 According to campaign finance laws, any money she has left in the bank from her Senate campaign can be used for a presidential run.

 While polls suggest nearly a third of Americans remain wary of a woman in the White House, and recent public appearances suggest she will have difficulty connecting with Middle America, her ratings continue to rise.

 She is the out-and-out favourite for the 2008 Democratic nomination with one poll suggesting she has actually gained a few points from a Republican bid to paint her as angry and irrational.

 Bald and with a pronounced southern drawl Carville dominated the Clinton 1992 war room, which specialised in taking the fight to the Republicans after years of Democratic defeatism.

 He minted the key slogan of the campaign: Its the economy, stupid, a tag which he pinned to the wall of the campaign room to remind staff to stay on message. Incongruously, he is married to Mary Matalin, an adviser to vice-president Dick Cheney.

 Begala originally played the quiet man, focusing on writing speeches while the Louisianan coined slogans. 

 Christian Winthrop, a spokesman for Hillary Clintons expected opponent this year, John Spencer, said the enlistment of two liberal attack dogs showed the panic in her camp. 

 The duo know all about panic from 1992 when they had to rescue Bill Clinton from the brink of disaster over his private life ? and some Hillary gaffes.

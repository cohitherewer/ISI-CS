 Gates $287m AIDS grant

 Gates: Huge donation

 Washington, July 19 (Reuters): The Bill amp; Melinda Gates Foundation announced $287 million in grants today to create an international network of 16 labs to try new approaches to making a vaccine against AIDS.

 The foundation says it wants the programme to transform the so-far unsuccessful AIDS vaccine effort by rewarding individual labs that come up with innovative ideas and helping them develop those ideas, but also ensuring that they collaborate with other researchers, who under ordinary circumstances would often be considered rivals.

 This is the foundations largest-ever investment in HIV vaccine development. In fact, its our largest-ever package of grants for HIV and AIDS, Dr Nicholas Hellmann, acting director of the Gates Foundations HIV, TB, and Reproductive Health program, said in a telephone briefing.

 AIDS was first described in 1981 and the human immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDS was found soon after ? but it has proven extremely difficult to find a way to make an effective vaccine.

 The 16 grants will go to more than 165 investigators in 19 countries, some of them top names in AIDS research and some less well-known. 

 Others will examine ways to make vaccines more effective, while five labs will create central facilities to help the others share data and compare results.

 Power run, in bikini

 COLIN RANDALL

 Royal: Bikini publicity

 Paris, Aug. 12: The tussle 

 for public affections between Frances presidential 

 frontrunners has moved from peak time television interview 

 slots to sun-drenched beaches.

 The celebrity gossip magazines Closer and VSD have defied Frances strict privacy laws by publishing pictures of Sgolne Royal, 52, recently voted one of the worlds sexiest women, in a swimsuit. On the cover of VSD, a photograph of Royal paddling in the Mediterranean in a turquoise bikini is juxtaposed with one of Nicolas Sarkozy, 51, jogging on the Atlantic coast.

 Aides of Royal, the voters clear favourite to stand for the Socialist Party in next years election, and her centre-Right rival have said that they did not give permission for the photographs to be taken. But one analyst was not convinced by their protestations and suggested that neither politician was likely to take court action.

 They could be accused of hypocrisy because of their past cooperation with the media in matters concerning their private lives, said Bruno Jeanbart, the director of political research at the opinion poll firm, Opinion Way.

 He said Sarkozy, neck and neck in the polls with Royal in the race for the Elyse Palace, had encouraged media attention towards his family, even posing with his wife, Cecilia, after their recent reconciliation following a well-publicised separation.

 Royal liked to cultivate an image of being open and close to ordinary people. She allowed film crews into a maternity clinic the day after she gave birth to her youngest daughter, Flora, in 1992, Jeanbart added.

 French Left rejects Chirac call for talks

 Paris, April 1 (Reuters): French Left-wing parties rejected President Jacques Chiracs call for dialogue today, reaffirming their plans to march next week against a youth job law they insist the government should withdraw.

 Opposition groups, reacting to Chiracs yesterdays speech saying he would sign the law but modify it, said they would join unions and students to stage more big protests that have gripped France.

 We have confirmed our unanimous agreement to demand the definitive withdrawal of the CPE (law) and the opening of real negotiations with all unions, students and high school pupils before any new law goes before parliament, Patrick Farbiaz, a leader of the ecologist Greens party, said after a meeting.

 A conservative strategy huddle earlier today agreed the laws critics had to hold talks with the government before it could introduce any modifications to the law allowing bosses to sack workers under 26 during a two-year trial period.

 Protesters say the First Job Contract creates Kleenex jobs that make it easier for firms to dispose of young workers.

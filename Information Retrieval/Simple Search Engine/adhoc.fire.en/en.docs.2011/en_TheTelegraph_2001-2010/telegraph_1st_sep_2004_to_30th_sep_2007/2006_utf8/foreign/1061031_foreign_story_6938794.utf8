 New Nepal poll chief named

 Kathmandu, Oct. 30 (Reuters): Nepals multi-party government appointed a retired bureaucrat as chief election commissioner today, a first step towards holding elections for a special Assembly to decide the embattled monarchys future.

 The government, formed after King Gyanendra restored democracy in April following weeks of mass protests, has pledged to hold elections for the constituent assembly by June 2007. The Assembly, a key demand of Maoist rebels, is supposed to prepare a new constitution and decide the future of monarchy. More than 13,000 people have died in the rebellion.

 We have appointed Bhojraj Pokharel as the chief election commissioner today, works and physical planning Minister Gopal Man Shrestha said after a cabinet meeting.

 The appointment was made with the consensus of the Maoists who are insisting on early elections, he said.

 Pokharel, 54, who was cleared by a parliamentary panel last week for the post, said his first priority was to conduct the elections.

 Fresh Ukraine gas row

 Moscow, Jan. 23 (Reuters): Russias gas monopoly Gazprom said today that neighbouring Ukraine was using more Russian gas than agreed, cutting onward supplies to Europe.

 But Ukraine, a key transit route for Russias huge supplies to Europe, said it was abiding by all its obligations despite soaring domestic gas use due to cold weather.

 The comments appear to reignite a row earlier this month when Russias gas monopoly Gazprom accused Ukraine of stealing gas destined for the West when it cut off supplies to its ex-Soviet neighbour over failure to agree to a new contract.

 The two sides finally agreed to a new contract on January 4. But today, Gazprom came close to accusing Ukraine of again stealing Russian transit gas. 

 Gazprom supplies one quarter of Europes gas needs and several of its clients, including Italy, have complained about reduced supplies.

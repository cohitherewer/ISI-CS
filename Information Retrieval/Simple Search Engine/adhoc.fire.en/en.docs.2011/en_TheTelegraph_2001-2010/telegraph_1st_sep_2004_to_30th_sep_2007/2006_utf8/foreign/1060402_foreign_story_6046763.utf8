 Virtual crucifixion on Internet

 Paris, April 1 (AFP): An Internet game site based on Roman Britain has staged a virtual crucifixion of one of its players to punish him for breaking the rules.

 The site Roma Victor (http://www.Roma-victor.com/) is an online recreation of life in Britain 2,000 years ago, in which players live as slaves and citizens under the Roman empire.

 Cynewulf ? in real life a 27-year-old electrical engineer from Flint, Michigan ? has been electronically nailed to a cross where he will hang for a full seven days on full public display, the site said yesterday.

 His punishment is for ganking, or repeatedly gang-killing new players as soon as they appear, thus destroying their chance of getting to grips with the game.

 Gamers on the site have the opportunity of insulting Cynewulf as they pass by his cross in a public square.

 Online game sites usually punish cheats by bans ranging from a few hours, days or weeks, with bad transgressors getting lifetime bans, although such punishments are usually very discreet and never made public. 

 Growth in the use of the Internet has come off its sizzling pace, even as people become more dependent on cyberspace for work and leisure, a global survey has showed.

 Ipsos Insights annual Face of the Web study yesterday showed the global online population grew just five per cent last year, well behind the 20 per cent growth rate seen in 2004.

 The survey of 6,500 people in 12 major countries, including India, by the research firm suggested growth will be slow in 2006 as well.

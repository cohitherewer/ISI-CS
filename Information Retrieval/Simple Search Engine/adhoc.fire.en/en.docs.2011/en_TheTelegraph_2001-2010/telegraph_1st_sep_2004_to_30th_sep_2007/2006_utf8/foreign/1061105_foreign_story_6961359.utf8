 Pastor admits sex link

 Colorado Springs, Colorado, 

 Nov. 4 (Reuters): Embattled evangelist Ted Haggard admitted 

 yesterday to buying the drug methamphetamine and seeking 

 a massage from a gay male prostitute but denied he had sex 

 with the man or used the stimulant.

 Haggard, a vocal opponent of gay marriage, resigned as president of the National Association of Evangelicals on Thursday after being accused by a male escort of having had a sexual relationship with him and using methamphetamine.

 I did call him. I called him to buy some meth. But I threw it away. I was buying it for me but I never used it, Haggard, who looked uneasy as he sat in a car with his wife, said in an interview with KUSA TV in Colorado.

 Asked if he had sex with his accuser, he replied tersely: No I did not. He said he had sought the man out at a Denver hotel for a massage.

 Haggard said he stayed at a number of hotels in Denver because he went to the city to write.

 Evangelicals said they were praying for Haggard but were troubled by the situation.

 This is a blow as the National Association of Evangelicals is a significant organisation for us. We would always want to lift up a high standard of conduct for church leaders, said Gary Ledbetter, director of communications for the Dallas-based Southern Baptists of Texas Convention.

 Haggard also temporarily stepped down as senior pastor of the New Life Church in Colorado Springs.

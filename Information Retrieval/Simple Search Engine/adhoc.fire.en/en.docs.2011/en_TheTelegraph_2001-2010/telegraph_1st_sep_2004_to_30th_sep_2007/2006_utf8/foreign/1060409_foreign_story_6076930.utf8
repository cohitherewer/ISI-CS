 Harry spotted in dirty club

 Harry: Wild child

 London, April 8 (Reuters): Prince Harry, who has gained a reputation as a royal wild child, hit the headlines again today with reports he visited a lap-dancing club.

 Harry, third in line to the throne, visited the Spearmint Rhino club at Colnbrook, west of London, with friends early yesterday to celebrate the end of his army officer training at the elite Sandhurst military academy, several newspapers reported.

 The Sun newspaper ? in a front-page story headlined Dirty Harry ? said the prince, 21, and his friends swigged lager and ogled topless girls. The Daily Mirror said Harry sat with a stripper on his lap after arriving at the club at 3 am.

 The office of Harrys father and heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles declined comment. 

 Harry, youngest son of Charles and the late Princess Diana, has courted controversy before with his behaviour.

 He apologised in January last year after wearing a Nazi uniform to a costume party.

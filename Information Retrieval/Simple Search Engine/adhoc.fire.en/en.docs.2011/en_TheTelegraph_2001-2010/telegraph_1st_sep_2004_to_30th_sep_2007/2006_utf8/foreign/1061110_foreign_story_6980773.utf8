 After China one-child policy, its one dog now

 London, Nov. 9: First it was one child. Now families in Beijing will be allowed only one dog.

 In a move designed to stamp out the spread of rabies, Chinas capital will institute a one dog per household policy in nine areas, the official Xinhua News Agency said.

 The new policy follows a campaign in August in which thousands of dogs were killed in order to fight the disease.

 Only one pet dog is allowed per household in the zones, and dangerous and large dogs will be banned. Anyone keeping an unlicensed dog will face prosecution, Xinhua said.

 Rabies, which attacks the nervous system and can be fatal, killed 318 people nationwide in September and 2,651 during 2004. Only 3 per cent of the countrys dogs are vaccinated against the disease.

 China has limited most urban couples to one child and those in the countryside to two since the 1970s in an effort to limit population growth and ease the strain on resources.

 The dog limit was announced by Beijing police and the city agencies for agriculture and commerce. A notice on the police departments website did not refer to a one dog policy but said a clampdown on stray and large dogs would be implemented.

 It called on dog owners to create a harmonious society and be a civilised dog raiser.

 Many people also supported the move, saying it was the only way to contain the disease.

 Woman caught in Marseille riot

 Paris, Oct. 30 (Reuters): France sent riot police reinforcements yesterday to the southern city of Marseille where young vandals torched a bus during the night, leaving a woman severely burned and fighting for her life.

 The attack on Saturday sparked fears of more violence in French cities, coming as France marks the anniversary of riots that scarred the nations poor, largely immigrant suburbs.

 President Jacques Chirac condemned the new unrest.

 The President told the victims family about his horror concerning this shameful act and assured them everything would be done to find the criminals and punish them with the utmost severity, Chiracs office said. Interior minister Nicolas Sarkozy announced the reinforcements.

 Local officials said some extra 160 officers were being sent to Marseille, a city which remained largely untouched by last years riots. 

 Police said four youths forced their way onto the bus and torched it before a French woman of Senegalese origin could escape. Officials said the 26-year-old was between life and death, with burns covering 60 per cent of her body. Some media reported the vandals were 15 years old.

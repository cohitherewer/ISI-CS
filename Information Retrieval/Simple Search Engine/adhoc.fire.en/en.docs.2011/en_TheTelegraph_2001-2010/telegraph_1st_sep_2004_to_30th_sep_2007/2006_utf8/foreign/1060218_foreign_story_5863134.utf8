The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Bonds lady

 Los Angeles, Feb. 17 (Reuters): Makers of the upcoming James Bond movie Casino Royale have cast little-known French actress Eva Green as the next femme fatale to pair up with British agent 007, distributor Columbia Pictures said yesterday.

 Green, 25, who made her 2003 film debut in The Dreamers, about a French brother and sister who befriend a young American during the Paris student riots of 1968, will play the enticing Vesper Lynd opposite English actor Daniel Craig in his first performance as Bond. Last year, she appeared in the big-screen crusades drama Kingdom of Heaven.

 In landing the coveted role of the next Bond girl, the French actress edged out a list of contenders reported in the Hollywood trade press to have included Oscar winner Charlize Theron, as well as Thandie Newton, Olivia Wilde and Kimberly Davies.

 American actor Jeffrey Wright, who co-starred in Syriana, has joined the Casino Royale cast as undercover CIA agent Felix Leiter. Production on Casino Royale, the 21st movie in the multibillion-dollar Bond film franchise that began with Dr. No in 1962, started on January 21 in Prague, and the movie is slated for release in November. Other production locations will include the Bahamas, Italy and Britain.

 The film, directed by Martin Campbell, is being adapted from the 1953 Ian Fleming novel that introduced the Bond character.

 Indonesia Playboy editor trial

 Jakarta, Dec. 7 (Reuters): The editor of Playboy Indonesia went on trial today on charges of distributing indecent pictures to the public and making money from them, which could carry a jail term of up to 32 months.

 The magazines first edition sparked protests in Indonesia in April although it had no nudity and less flesh was visible in the issue than many other magazines on sale in the worlds most populous Muslim country.

 Editor-in-chief Erwin Arnada has argued that Playboy was good for developing a pluralistic society in Indonesia but the prosecution told the South Jakarta court at the start of his trial that it was lewd and broke the law.

 Photos, drawings and articles in Playboy Indonesia magazine were results of the defendants selection. They were unsuitable for civility and could arouse lust among readers so they violated feelings of decency, said prosecutor Resni Muchtar. The case involves the first edition.

 The subsequent editions of the magazine are still on sale in Indonesian cities despite attacks on its Jakarta office.

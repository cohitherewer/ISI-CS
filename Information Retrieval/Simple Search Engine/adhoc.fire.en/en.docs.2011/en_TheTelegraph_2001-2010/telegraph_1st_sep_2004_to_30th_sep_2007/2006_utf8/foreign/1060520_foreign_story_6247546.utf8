The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 William, Harry love Friends, reality TV

 Harry and William 

 London, May 19 (AFP): 

 Their mother famously had the common touch, and it seems 

 the British publics view of Princess Diana as one 

 of us could also be true of her sons, Princes William 

 and Harry.

 The young royals have revealed a taste for popular television reality shows, the US comedy series Friends, as well as fierce sibling rivalry for custody of the remote control and rows with their father over their musical preferences.

 The insights into life in the Windsor household came during a light-hearted television interview with all three princes to be aired tomorrow evening to coincide with the 30th anniversary celebrations of Prince Charless trust.

 Although they have briefly answered questions together at photo calls in the past, it is the first time father and sons have been quizzed at length. According to excerpts of the interview released by Britains ITV1 Television, William, 23, and Harry, 21, have similar viewing habits.

 We like the same sort of things, although there is usually an argument over the remote control at home about who watches what. That usually goes on for a while, said William. Friends is always a safe bet, Harry said before both confirmed, slightly shame-faced, that they also watch the much-derided, yet popular, musical talent contests X Factor, Pop Idol and American Pop Idol.

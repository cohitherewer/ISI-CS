 Nepal govt address minus king

 Kathmandu, July 9 (Reuters): Nepals new government today presented its annual policies in parliament at a ceremony which for the first time did not include the king, and the Prime Minister was also absent because of poor health.

 Deputy Prime Minister Khadga Prasad Oli, addressed the legislature on behalf of 84-year-old Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala, who has been in hospital with pneumonia.

 The government is committed to establishing sustainable peace in the country by ending the decade-long violent conflict, Oli said, referring to the Maoist insurgency in which over 13,000 people have died.

 The parliament, reinstated by King Gyanendra in April after pro-democracy protests in which at least 18 people died, recently stripped him of his legislative roles and took over his control of the army.

 Earlier, Gyanendra would deliver the annual address. But today, his throne had been removed and a big national flag stood in its place.

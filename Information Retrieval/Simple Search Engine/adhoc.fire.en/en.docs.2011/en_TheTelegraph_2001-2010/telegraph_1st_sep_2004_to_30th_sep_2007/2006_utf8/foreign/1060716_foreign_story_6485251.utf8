 Iraq sports officials, Olympics chief nabbed

 Baghdad, July 15 (Reuters): Gunmen in uniforms seized 30 or more Iraqi sports officials, including the national Olympics chief, and their bodyguards in Baghdad today, barely an hour after parliament voted to extend a state of emergency.

 The kidnappings at a central Baghdad hall where the officials were meeting occurred despite a crackdown by Iraqi forces in the capital. 

 Police and interior ministry sources said gunmen wearing blue camouflage uniforms used by the ministry stormed the central Baghdad hall at about 1000 GMT and killed a bodyguard of the Olympic Committee chief Ahmed al-Hadjiya. Hadjiya and about 20 bodyguards, along with at least eight officials, were then bundled into vehicles and driven off.

 Indian drivers held

 Five Indian truck drivers have been taken into police custody in Iraq.

 The five, two from Punjab and three from Kerala, were detained as they were taking cargo from Kuwait to the Iraqi border for their employers Kuwait and Gulf Links, minister of state for external affairs E. Ahmed said. They have been identified as Bala Ramachandran, Devraj, Sedhu Johny Bhasha, Gulvinder Singh and Sanjeev Kumar Ramavtar.

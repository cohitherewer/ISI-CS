 Cuba handover

 Havana, Aug. 7 (Reuters): Cuba has set in motion a peaceful political succession, dashing US expectations of chaos following Fidel Castros handover of power to his brother, a leading Cuban intellectual and government member, Roberto Fernandez Retamar, said today.

 They (the US government) had not expected that a peaceful succession was possible. A peaceful succession has taken place in Cuba, Fernandez Retamar said.

 A council of state member, Retamar was the first government official to say a succession under Raul Castro was in motion after Fidel Castro relinquished power a week ago following gastric surgery.

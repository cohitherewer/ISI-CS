 Name game

 Los Angeles, Oct. 25 (AFP): The guessing game over pop-star Britney Spearss baby boys name is over, according to celebrity news website www.tmz.com.

 Contrary to reports, Spears and husband Kevin Federline have not named their child Sutton Pierce and instead have given him the moniker Jayden James.

 Tmz said the name was listed on a birth certificate filed by the couple with Los Angeles authorities after the birth of the boy on September 12, scotching rumours the baby was a girl.

 The couple already have a son, Sean Preston, who was born in September 2005. The baby is Federlines fourth child, as he has two small children by his ex-girlfriend, actress Shar Jackson.

 Row over Hemingway six-toed feline gifts

Hemingway: Cat chaos

 Miami, July 30 (AP): The caretakers of Ernest Hemingways Key West home want a federal judge to intervene in their dispute with the US department of agriculture over the six-toed cats that roam the property.

 More than 50 descendants of a multi-toed cat the novelist received as a gift in 1935 wander the grounds of the home, where Hemingway lived for more than 10 years and wrote A Farewell to Arms and To Have and Have Not. 

 The Ernest Hemingway Home and Museum disputes the USDAs claim that it is an exhibitor of cats and needs to have a animal welfare licence, according to a complaint filed in US district court in Miami.

 What theyre comparing the Hemingway house to is a circus or a zoo because there are cats on the premises, Carla Higgins, the homes attorney, said. This is not a travelling circus. These cats have been on the premises forever.

 The USDAs animal and plant health inspection service has repeatedly denied a licence for the Hemingway home under the Animal Welfare Act, which the home contends governs animals in commerce. The USDA has threatened to charge the home $200 per cat per day for violating the act.

 Were asking the judge to let us know whether this act applies to the cats, and if so why that is if the animals are not in commerce, Higgins said. If it has something to do with the number, how many do we have to get rid of to be in compliance with the act?

 Agency inspectors who have repeatedly visited the property since October 2003 have never indicated any concerns about the welfare of the cats. But they have said a six-foot-high, brick-and-mortar fence Hemingway built around the property in 1937 did not sufficiently contain the 53 cats, which should be caged, according to the complaint.

 Caging the cats, some of which are 19 years old or older, would traumatise them, and the home as a national historic site prohibits extending the height of the fence.

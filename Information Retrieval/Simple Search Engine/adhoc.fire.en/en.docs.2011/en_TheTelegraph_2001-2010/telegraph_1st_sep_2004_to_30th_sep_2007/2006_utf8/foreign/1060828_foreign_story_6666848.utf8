 Rebellion, fed by gas

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Islamabad, Aug. 27: The killing of veteran Baluch politician Nawab Akbar Bugti during a military operation late yesterday has plunged the Baluchistan province into a new phase of protest and condemnation of the Pakistani establishment.

 Bugti, a former chief minister and governor of Baluchistan, was being accused by the central government of fuelling insurgency, raising his private militia and targeting sensitive government installations in the restive province.

 The low-scale insurgency erupted in Baluchistan in December last year after the central government announced its plans to explore new reserves of oil and gas in the province.

 Baluch nationalists accuse the government of exploiting their natural resources without passing on the benefits to the impoverished province, which is rich in mineral resources and meets 25 per cent of the countrys natural gas demand.

 Bugti, who was born in 1927 and voted for creation of Pakistan as member of the royal assembly of Baluch elders in the early 1940s, also wanted a greater share of provincial natural resources and opposed the establishment of additional military garrisons in the region.

 It was in the backdrop of this clash of interests between the government and the tribal chiefs that President Pervez Musharraf also repeatedly issued stern warnings to Baluch nationalists, including Bugti, asking them to lay down arms and behave like good citizens.

 However, Bugti often rejected peace talks with the government, saying military operations and political negotiations could not continue side by side.

 The army conducted four operations to quell rebellion in Baluchistan since 1948, which only further embittered Baluch nationalists. 

 Bugti, who allegedly raised a 10,000-strong militia of insurgent tribals in his hometown Dera Bugti, was one of very influential tribal chieftains in the province.

 He played a predominantly important role in national politics for over five decades and started his active political career after winning a seat in Pakistans Constituent Assembly and becoming a deputy minister for defence and interior in 1958. He also served as provincial chief minister and governor in 1989 and 1973. He became a member of the Baluchistan Assembly and federal legislature many times. 

 Bugti, who was last elected to the National Assembly in 1993 and represented his Jamhoori Watan Party, supported political movements against the military governments of Ayub Khan in the 1960s and Ziaul Haq in the 1980s. 

 He also worked with former Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto for quite some time but left him in the mid-1970s following differences after the latter ordered a military operation in Baluchistan in 1973. 

 He (Bugti) had a great respect and following in Baluchistan as the leading politician, former Prime Minister Mir Zafarullah Khan Jamali, who himself comes from Baluchistan, said.

 Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal chief Qazi Hussein Ahmad and acting Alliance for Restoration of Democracy president Makhdoom Amin Fahim also condemned the killing. 

 The way Bugti has been murdered doesnt augur well for the future of the province, Sardar Wazir Jogezai, a former deputy president of the national legislature from Baluchistan, told The Telegraph. 

 It might throw up even a stronger insurgency and unite all the nationalist forces. A dead Bugti could be more dangerous than the one holed up in a cave, Jogezai warned.

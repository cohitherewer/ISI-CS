 Scientists test new anti-obesity vaccine

 New York, Aug. 1 (Reuters): In what could become a new weapon in the battle of the bulge, scientists today reported initial success with an experimental vaccine for obesity.

 The researchers found that when they gave rats a vaccine against a hunger hormone called ghrelin, the animals were able to live the dream of eating what they wanted without packing on body fat.

 The findings, published online by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, suggest a whole new approach to weight loss. Its a long way, however, from success in rats to similar results in people. More research in animals and more data on safety will be needed before an obesity vaccine is widely tested in humans, according to Dr Kim Janda of the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California.

 One of the next steps will be to see whether ghrelin vaccination helps already obese rodents shed pounds, Janda said. 

 If a vaccine were to become a reality for humans, it would be aimed at those obese individuals who continually yo-yo through diet and exercise, he noted. Secreted primarily by the stomach, ghrelin is one of the hormones that help regulate appetite, metabolism and weight. 

 Janda and his colleagues aimed to decrease the hormones activity with an anti-ghrelin vaccine.

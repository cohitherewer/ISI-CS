 Pak helped foil plot

 London, Aug. 10: Pakistani intelligence agencies helped the British authorities foil the terror plot to blow up aircraft travelling between Britain and America, highly placed sources in Pakistan said today.

 The agencies have been working closely with British anti-terror police in monitoring the activities of the suspected terrorists for some time, many of whom have links with Pakistan-based Islamic militant groups, The Times has learnt.

 Pakistan actively cooperated to make this happen, a senior Pakistani official said. There was very close cooperation between the intelligence agencies of the two countries. The official said action was being taken in Pakistan, but would not confirm whether any arrests had been made in the country.

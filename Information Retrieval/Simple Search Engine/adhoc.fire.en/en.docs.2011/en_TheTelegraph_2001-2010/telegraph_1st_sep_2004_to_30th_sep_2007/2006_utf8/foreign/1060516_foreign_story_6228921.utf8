 UK stabbing weapon

 London, May 15 (Reuters): Detectives investigating the stabbing to death of part-time policewoman Nisha Patel-Nasri said today she may have been killed with her own kitchen knife. 

 The 29-year-old special police constable was off duty when she was stabbed to death outside her home in Wembley, northwest London, late on Thursday night.

 Police said a 13-inch stainless steel knife was missing from the home and could not rule out that Patel-Nasri had taken it outside, having heard a disturbance.

 We dont know why she left the house, detective Superintendent Julian Worker told the BBC, and it does remain a possibility she took the knife herself. 

 The distinctive cooks knife had the name of the store John Lewis written on the side.

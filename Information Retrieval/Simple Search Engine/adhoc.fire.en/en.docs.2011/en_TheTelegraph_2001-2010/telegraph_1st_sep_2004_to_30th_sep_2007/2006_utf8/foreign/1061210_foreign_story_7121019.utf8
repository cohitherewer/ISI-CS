 Bushfire smoke hits Melbourne

 Sydney, Dec. 9 (Reuters): Smoke from bushfires burning hundreds of kilometres away blanketed Australias second largest city Melbourne today, delaying flights and setting off fire alarms at the citys airport.

 Water-bombing aircraft intended to help contain some of the 24 bushfires burning out of control in the southern state of Victoria were grounded because of the thick smoke. Ambulance officials urged people with respiratory problems such as asthma to stay indoors and aviation officials warned pilots that visibility was down to 5 km.

 The conditions for today with all the smoke in the atmosphere are absolutely terrible for people with asthma. It is imperative that they stay inside, said an ambulance official.

 The bushfires, most sparked by lightning strikes, have blackened almost 180,000 hectares of land, mostly in rugged, inaccessible mountains in the northeast of the state. Firefighters fear the fires could sweep through some small country towns in Victorias highlands tomorrow as northerly winds pick up strength ahead of a forecast cool change.

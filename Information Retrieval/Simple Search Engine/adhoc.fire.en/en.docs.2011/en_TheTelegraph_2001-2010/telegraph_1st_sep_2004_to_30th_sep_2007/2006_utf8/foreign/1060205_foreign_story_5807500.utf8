 Embassies burn in Syria protest

 Damascus, Feb. 4 (Reuters): Furious Syrians set fire to the Danish and Norwegian embassies today as protests over cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad showed no signs of abating despite calls for calm.

 Oil giant Iran, already embroiled in a dispute with the West over its nuclear programme, said it was reviewing trade ties with countries that have published such caricatures. 

 Chanting God is Greatest, thousands of protesters stormed the Danish embassy, burned the Danish flag and replaced it with a flag reading: No God but Allah, Mohammad is His Prophet. They set fires which badly damaged the building before being put out.

 No one was hurt as the embassy was closed at the time.

 Demonstrators also set the Norwegian embassy ablaze. It was brought under control by firefighters. 

 Police fired teargas to disperse protesters there and also used water hoses to hold back others from storming the French embassy. Scores of riot police were also deployed to protect the US mission. Denmark and Norway advised their citizens to leave Syria.

 Denmark is at the eye of the storm as the cartoons that Muslim demonstrators find offensive, one of the Prophet with a turban resembling a bomb, first appeared in a Danish daily.

 A small Norwegian Christian newspaper was one of the first newspaper outside Denmark to publish the cartoons. They have now appeared in papers in Bulgaria, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, Hungary, New Zealand, Norway, Poland.

 Sweden, which shares its Syrian embassy with Denmark and Chile, was also dragged into the Damascus protests. It summoned the Syrian ambassador in Stockholm in protest.

 Sweden, Denmark and Norway said the Syrians had not done enough to protect their buildings in the capital. 

 There was no immediate comment from Syrian officials.

 The row has already had an economic impact with Arab countries boycotting Danish goods, but in a new twist today, Iran said it had formed a committee to review trade ties with countries that published cartoons deemed to insult the Prophet. 

 A committee has been formed to review trade ties, a spokesman for the presidential office said.

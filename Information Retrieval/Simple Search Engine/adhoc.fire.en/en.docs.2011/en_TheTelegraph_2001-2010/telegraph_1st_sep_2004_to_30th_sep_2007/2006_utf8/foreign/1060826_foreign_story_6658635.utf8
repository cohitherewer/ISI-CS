 Lying low

 Hanoi, Aug. 25 (Reuters): A convicted Vietnamese robber who escaped from prison 20 years ago chose a sly way to hide from the law inside the police force and as a member of the ruling Communist Party.

 A police newspaper reported today that Ngo Thanh Tam, 51, was re-arrested on Tuesday, two decades after joining the police under a false identity in the Central Highlands province of Dak Nong.

 The An Ninh Thu Do (Capital Security) newspaper described Tam as a dangerous criminal on the national wanted list. After his arrest he was purged from the party. 

 Drink drive

 Beijing (Reuters): A 25-year-old auditor 

 in China apparently ate and drank himself to death while 

 he was supposed to be inspecting a government department. 

 Zhang Hongtao went to many banquets organised by a power 

 company in northern Chinas Hebei province in April, 

 and instead of working did little else but eat and drink. 

 He collapsed and died following a banquet.

 Chip in hand opens up doors

 New York, Jan. 6 (Reuters): Forgetting computer passwords is an everyday source of frustration, but a solution may literally be at hand ? in the form of computer chip implants.

 With a wave of his hand, Amal Graafstra, a 29-year-old entrepreneur based in Vancouver, Canada, opens his front door. With another, he logs onto his computer. Tiny radio frequency identification (RFID) computer chips inserted into Graafstras hands make it all possible.

 I just dont want to be without access to the things that I need to get access to. In the worst case scenario, if Im in the alley naked, I want to still be able to get in (my house), Graafstra said in an interview in New York, where he is promoting the technology. RFID is for me.

 The computer chips, which cost about $2, interact with a device installed in computers and other electronics. The chips are activated when they come within 3 inches of a so-called reader, which scans the data on the chips. The reader devices are available for as little as $50.

 Information about where to buy the chips and readers is available online at the forum, (http://tagged.kaos.gen.nz/) where enthusiasts of the technology chat and share information. 

 I cant feel it at all. It doesnt impede me. It doesnt hurt at all. I almost cant tell its there, agreed Jennifer Tomblin, a 23-year-old marketing student and Graafstras girlfriend. The RFID chip in Brooklyn resident Mikey Sklars hand, which is smaller than a grain of rice, was injected by a surgeon in Los Angeles. Tattoo artists and veterinarians also could insert the chips into people.

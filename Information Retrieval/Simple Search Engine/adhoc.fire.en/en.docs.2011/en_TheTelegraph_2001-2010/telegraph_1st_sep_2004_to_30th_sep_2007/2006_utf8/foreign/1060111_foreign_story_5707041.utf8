 Mothers death still haunts Rowling

 - Potter 

 angst tied to author life 

 Modest: J.K. Rowling 

 A tear slowly trickles down J.K. Rowlings cheek. She is sitting in her large and comfortable drawing room in the Morningside area of Edinburgh, recalling the most traumatising moment of her life.

 It was the day her mother, Anne, died aged 45 after a 10-year battle against multiple sclerosis (MS). A small part of her agony is that her mother never knew she was writing Harry Potter, let alone that she would become the most successful author on earth. The night she died I had been staying with my boyfriends family, the first time I had ever spent Christmas away from home. I had gone to bed early, ostensibly to watch The Man Who Would Be King, but instead I started writing.

 So I know I was writing Harry Potter at the moment my mother died. I had never told her about Harry Potter.

 Dad called me at seven clock the next morning and I just knew what had happened before he spoke. As I ran downstairs, I had that kind of white noise panic in my head but could not grasp the enormity of my mother having died.

 It was New Years Day 1991 and Joanne Rowling, then 25, and her boyfriend piled into his car and drove to her parents home in Wales.

 I was alternately a wreck and then in total denial. At some point on the car journey, I can remember thinking: Lets pretend it hasnt happened, because that was a way to get through the next 10 minutes.

 Rowling is startled by her tears. She is naturally reserved and very private. She is also very ordered and in control. She dabs a proffered napkin to her eyes and pauses before continuing: Barely a day goes by when I do not think of her. There would be so much to tell her, impossibly much.

 A priority in her life now is to raise funds for research into MS, which confined her mother to a wheelchair in her final days. She was so young and so fit. To have your body in rebellion against you is a dreadful thing to witness, let alone suffer, says Rowling, now patron of the MS Society Scotland.

 On March 17, she will host a fundraising masked ball at Stirling Castle; one of the many attractions will be a treasure hunt with clues set by her. Her mothers condition forged her own psychological strengths and vulnerabilities, as well as leading her to make Harry Potter suffer the death of his parents.

 Her orphaned schoolboy with his trademark specs has become one of the most successful characters in childrens literature, selling 300 million books in 63 countries; some of the Harry Potter books have sold three million copies within 48 hours of going on sale.

 Death is the key to understanding J.K. Rowling. Her greatest fear ? and she is completely unhesitant about this ? is of someone she loves dying. My books are largely about death. They open with the death of Harrys parents. There is Voldemorts obsession with conquering death and his quest for immortality at any price, the goal of anyone with magic.

 I so understand why Voldemort wants to conquer death. Were all frightened of it. In the seventh and final Harry Potter book, there will be deaths of both goodies and baddies.

 She was talking to her husband, Neil, recently, after she had just written the death of one particular character. He shuddered. Oh dont do that, he said to me, but of course I did.

 And with one swirl of her pen, millions of children will weep or rejoice. Countless Harry Potter websites try to predict what will happen in the final book. Neil is the only person I can talk to about what happens because he instantly forgets, she says, laughing.

 This modest, gentle woman, born in Chipping Sodbury, Gloucestershire, cannot really believe she is as famous as Walt Disney was in his day. I cannot really emphasise how unconnected I was when all this happened to me.

 But you know that your PA could arrange a meeting for you with anyone in the world? When you say that to me, I just find it freakish. Im not being disingenuous, Im not trying to be modest, but it still puzzles me and Im very wary of it.

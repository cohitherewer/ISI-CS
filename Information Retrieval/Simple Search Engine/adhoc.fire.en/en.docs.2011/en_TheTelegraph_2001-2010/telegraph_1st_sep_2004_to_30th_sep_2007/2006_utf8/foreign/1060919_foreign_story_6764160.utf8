 Dogged soul

 Jerusalem, Sept. 18 (Reuters): A stray dog which refused to budge from the home of a recently deceased rabbi has finally moved on after a redemption ceremony at an Israeli cemetery. 

 The dog, pictured in Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper today, showed up at the house of the late Rabbi Nahman Dubinky.

 Rabbis expert in Kabbalah, or Jewish mysticism, concluded the animal could be possessed by a tortured soul seeking redemption. Ultra-orthodox Jews traditionally do not keep dogs as pets.

 Rare dish

 Tokyo (Reuters): Hundreds of people queued up at a central Tokyo restaurant on Monday to savour a dish not tasted for more than two years beef bowl made with US meat. Some Japanese had even camped out overnight outside a popular branch of fast-food chain Yoshinoya, which resumed sales of its famed speciality following the July lifting of a government ban on imports of US beef. The ban was imposed in December 2003 after the discovery of the first US case of mad cow disease.

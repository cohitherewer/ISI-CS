 India: Polls lacked credibility

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 9: India today slammed the municipal elections in Nepal saying they lacked credibility in the absence of mainstream political parties from the poll process. 

 In a hard-hitting statement against the palace-sponsored polls, Delhi said that for any credible electoral exercise the involvement of mainstream political parties was necessary. India also deplored the curtailment of legitimate democratic rights of political parties through mass arrests of leaders and social activists.

 King Gyanendra may have tried to sell civic elections as the first step towards restoration of democracy, but he has no sympathisers in Delhi. India said polls were held in the backdrop of boycott by the recognised political parties.

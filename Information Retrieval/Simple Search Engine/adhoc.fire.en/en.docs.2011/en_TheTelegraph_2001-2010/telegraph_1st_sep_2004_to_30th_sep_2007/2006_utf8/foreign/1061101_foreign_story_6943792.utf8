 Thai vulgar dance banned

 Bangkok, Oct. 31 (AFP): Thailand today banned people younger than 20 from performing sexy dances in public places after the queen objected to an erotic performance held in a Buddhist temple.

 As they are under the age of consent, they cannot conduct such performances, the head of the governments cultural surveillance centre, Ladda Thangsuppachai said. They could be easily lured into the sex trade, she warned.

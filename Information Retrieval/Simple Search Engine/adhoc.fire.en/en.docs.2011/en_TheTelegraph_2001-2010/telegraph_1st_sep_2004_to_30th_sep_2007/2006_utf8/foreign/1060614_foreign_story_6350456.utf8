 Popular diners

 New York, June 13 (AP): When Esquire asked American men who they would invite from a list of 14 notable women to a dinner party, they chose secretary of state Condoleezza Rice over such stars as Julia Roberts, Jennifer Aniston and Jessica Simpson.

 Rice was followed by Oprah Winfrey and Angelina Jolie in a national survey published in the magazines July issue. The 29 question survey, conducted by Beta Research Corp, polled 1,083 men aged 25 and older. Asked which famous man they would invite to dinner, 37 per cent picked Tonight host Jay Leno. Bill Clinton placed second, trailed by George Clooney and President George Bush.

 Men said they most admired former secretary of state Colin Powell (5.9 per cent). Clinton and Bill Gates tied closely behind (5.8 per cent) and Bush placed third (5.3 per cent).

 The President did, however, place first in another category: least admirable man in America. He got 14.8 per cent of the vote, while Clinton came in second, again at 7.8 per cent.

 According to the survey, most men do not aspire to be American Idol winner Taylor Hicks. Eighty five per cent said they would rather be the CEO of a Fortune 500 company than win the Fox talent contest (15 per cent).

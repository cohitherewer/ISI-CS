 Many deaf to cry of the dying, says Pope

 Vatican City, Dec. 25 (Reuters): Mankind, which has reached other planets and unravelled many of natures secrets, should not presume it can live without God, Pope Benedict said in his Christmas message today.

 In an age of unbridled consumerism it was shameful many remained deaf to the heart-rending cry of those dying of hunger, thirst, disease, poverty, war and terrorism, he said.

 Does a Saviour still have any value and meaning for the men and women of the third millennium? he asked in his Urbi et Orbi (to the city and the world) message to the faithful in St Peters Square.

 Is a Saviour still needed by a humanity which has reached the moon and Mars and is prepared to conquer the universe; for a humanity which knows no limits in its pursuit of natures secrets and which has succeeded even in deciphering the marvellous codes of the human genome?

 He appealed for peace and justice in West Asia, an end to the brutal violence in Iraq and to the fratricidal conflict in Darfur and other parts of Africa, and expressed his hope for a democratic Lebanon.

 The Pope said he hoped to visit the Holy Land as soon as the situation allowed.

 Speaking to tens of thousands of people, he wished the world a Happy Christmas in 62 languages, but his speech highlighted his preoccupation with humanitys fate.

 Marking the second Christmas season of his pontificate, he said that while 21st century man appeared to be a master of his own destiny, perhaps he needs a saviour all the more because much of humanity was suffering.

 People continue to die of hunger and thirst, disease and poverty, in this age of plenty and of unbridled consumerism, he said.

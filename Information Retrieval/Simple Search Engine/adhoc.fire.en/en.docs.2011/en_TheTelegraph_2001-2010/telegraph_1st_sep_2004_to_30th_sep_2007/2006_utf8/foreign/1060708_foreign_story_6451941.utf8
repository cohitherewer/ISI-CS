The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 More 7/7 fears

 London, 

 July 7 (Reuters): Britain marked the first anniversary 

 of the London suicide bombings with flowers, candles and 

 a two-minute silence today as the citys police chief 

 said another attack now looked more likely.

 One year after four young British Muslims blew themselves up on Londons transport system, killing 52 people and wounding 700, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Ian Blair described the threat faced by Britain as grim.

 There are, as we speak, people in the UK planning further atrocities, he told BBC Radio. Since July, the threat has palpably increased. As sombre Londoners went to work, stopping to lay flowers at the site of the July 7, 2005 attacks, the mood was one of unease mixed with resignation and defiance.

 I was there. It could have been me, so I am just lucky to be alive and remembering those who werent that lucky, said Robert Andrews, 29, who was on one of the bombed London Underground trains. I am aware it could happen again but I am not worried, he said. I have just got to get on with my life.

 A survey by the Pew Global Attitudes Project released in Washington yesterday showed 42 per cent of Britons were very concerned about a rise in Islamic extremism in Britain compared to 34 per cent a year ago.

 Many of Britains 1.8 million Muslims feel their community has been unfairly targeted by the police since the attacks. Two botched anti-terrorist operations in which police shot two innocent men, killing one of them, have not helped. Some survivors want a full public inquiry into events which, like the September 11 attacks in the US, have become etched into the British psyche as a simple date ? 7/7.

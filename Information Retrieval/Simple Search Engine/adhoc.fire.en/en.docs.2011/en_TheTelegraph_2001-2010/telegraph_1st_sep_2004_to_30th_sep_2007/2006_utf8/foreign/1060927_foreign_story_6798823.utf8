 A yen for China 

 Tokyo, Sept. 26 (Reuters): Japans new Prime Minister Shinzo Abe pledged today to boost his countrys role in global affairs while trying to improve relations with China, frayed by predecessor Junichiro Koizumis visits to a Tokyo war shrine.

 The hawkish Abe (in picture), who at 52 became the youngest Japanese leader since World War II, also said he wanted to push ahead with the economic reforms begun by Koizumi and revive respect at home for traditional values and culture.

 Relations with China chilled after Koizumi began annual visits to Tokyos Yasukuni Shrine, seen in Beijing and Seoul as a symbol of Japans past militarism.

 Chinas development is a big plus for us. I want to make efforts to further develop ties, said Abe, who has backed Koizumis visits but declined to say if he would follow suit.

 The soft-spoken lawmaker reiterated his call for tighter ties with the US, promised to work towards rewriting Japans Constitution and to put more discipline in classrooms.

 He said he would nurture growth while giving precedence to spending cuts to rein in public debt, the biggest among advanced nations. 

 Abe said he would cut his own salary about $358,000 by 30 per cent and those of his ministers by 10 per cent.

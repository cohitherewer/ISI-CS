 Militants get death

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Islamabad, Feb. 21: More than 20 months after they tried to kill the Karachi corps commander in a brazen ambush, the Jund Allah militants were today handed death sentences in an Islamabad court.

 Eleven of the 16 accused were present in the court when Judge Feroz Muhammad Bhatti of the special anti-terrorism court ruled that all 16 militants had been found guilty of involvement in the attack in June 2004 on a busy Karachi intersection.

 General Ahsan Saleem Hayat, then the corps commander of Karachi, was on his way to the corps headquarters when the militants opened fire on his convoy. General Saleem, now the deputy chief of army, escaped unhurt but seven soldiers died in the attack.

 The bearded militants greeted the death warrants with loud slogans: Allah--Akbar, We do not repent our acts, we are not scared of death.

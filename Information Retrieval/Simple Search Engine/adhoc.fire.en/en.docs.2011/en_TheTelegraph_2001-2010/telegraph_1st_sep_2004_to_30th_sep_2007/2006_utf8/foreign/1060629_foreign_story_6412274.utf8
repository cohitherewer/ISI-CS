 Mobile doubles up as detector

 Paris, June 28 (AFP): The Finnish phone maker Nokia has devised a mobile handset that can also double up as a metal detector, enabling the owner to look for concealed guns, hidden electrical cables and lost car keys.

 The US patent application filed by Nokia says the phone is fitted with an induction coil whose main use is to get a clear audio signal for people with hearing difficulties, the British weekly New Scientist reports.

 But it can also be used to detect metal at short distances, says the report, carried in next Saturdays issue of the British science weekly.

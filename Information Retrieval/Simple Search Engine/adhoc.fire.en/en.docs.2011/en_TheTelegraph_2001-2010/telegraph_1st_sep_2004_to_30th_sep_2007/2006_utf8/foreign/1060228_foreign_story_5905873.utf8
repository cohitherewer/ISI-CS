 Zarqawi aide held: Iraq TV

 Zarqawi: Blow

 Baghdad, Feb. 27 (Reuters): Iraqi interior ministry forces have captured a senior aide to al Qaida in Iraq leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, Iraqi state television said today.

 Iraqiya named the man as Abu Farouq and said he was captured with five others in the Sunni insurgent stronghold of Ramadi, west of the capital.

 It said Abu Farouq al-Suri, previously unknown to the media, was captured by the Wolf Brigade, one of several counter-insurgency units operating within the Shia-run interior ministry but accused by Sunnis of targeting civilians in their community.

 The word Suri is Arabic for Syrian, indicating that the captured man may have come from Iraqs western neighbour. US military spokespeople were unaware of the capture. US and Iraqi forces often report the capture of senior al Qaida operatives in Iraq.

 Iraqi intelligence officials have said Zarqawis centre of operations appeared to move last autumn from the western Anbar province to the religiously mixed eastern province of Diyala.

 Nationalist Sunni insurgents in Anbar had said they were planning to set up a militia partly to fight al Qaida and its network of foreign fighters.

 Mosques bombed

 Four people were killed and 15 wounded when two bombs exploded near a Sunni mosque in mainly Shia eastern Baghdad today, police said.

 The bombs were planted by the road outside That al-Nitaqain mosque in the New Baghdad area and went off just after evening prayers. Iraq lifted a three-day curfew today that had been imposed to quell a wave of violence.

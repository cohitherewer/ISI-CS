 Revealed: How Bush fell

 Minor cuts on President Bushs hand after the collision at Gleneagles Hotel, Scotland, in July last year

 London, Feb. 27: George W. Bush only had one hand on his handlebars when he came off his bicycle during last Julys G8 summit, according to newly-published police documents.

 The American President suffered minor injuries when he collided with a police officer while out on his bike at the Gleneagles Hotel in Perthshire, Scotland, on July 6.

 An official police incident report, obtained by the Scotland on Sunday newspaper, has revealed further details of the incident, which left the unnamed officer requiring crutches.

 The officer was with a detachment of Strathclyde Police constables, dressed in anti-riot gear, who were forming a protective line at the gate at the hotels rear entrance.

 [At] about 1800 hours the President approached the junction at speed on the bicycle. 

 The road was damp at the time, the report stated. As the President passed the junction at speed he raised his left arm from the handlebars to wave to the police officers present while shouting: Thanks, you guys, for coming.

 As he did this he lost control of the cycle, falling to the ground, causing both himself and his bicycle to strike [the officer] on the lower legs. 

 The President continued along the ground for approximately five metres, causing himself a number of abrasions.

 The report also confirms that the President telephoned the injured officer to ask how he was and to apologise for the accident.

 Farrell sex tape now on Internet

 Los Angeles, Jan. 11: A steamy sex video made by actor Colin Farrell and a Playboy playmate surfaced on the Internet today despite a court injunction blocking its release.

 A website carrying the video featuring the Irish actor Farrell and his then-girlfriend, Nicole Narain, Playboy magazines Miss January 2002, spread like wildfire on the Internet after being picked up by other websites, including defamer and idontlikeyouinthatway, which also posted what it claimed are video stills of Farrell and Narain purportedly engaged in sex acts.

 In releasing the video, the website reportedly stated: Colin tried to stop us from showing you this. Well, here it is anyways, according to idontlikeyouinthatway. By late this afternoon, the website carrying the video was unavailable for viewing.

 Farrells publicist released the following statement today: A website attempting to distribute an unauthorised tape of Colin Farrell was shut down today.. A Los Angeles court had issued an order in July, temporarily blocking the public release of the video that was made about two years ago.

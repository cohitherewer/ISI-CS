 Islamabad, March 6 (Reuters): Pakistans President Pervez Musharraf stepped up a war of words with Afghanistan, deriding accusations the Taliban leader was in Pakistan as nonsense and questioning the Afghan Presidents leadership.

 Musharraf in an interview with CNN late yesterday, said relations with neighbouring Afghanistan were growing tense and President Hamid Karzai was totally oblivious to efforts by elements in his government to malign Pakistan.

 President George W. Bush visited both major allies in the war in terrorism last week and US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice said the US was trying to promote cooperation between the often uneasy neighbours. President Karzai is totally oblivious of what is happening in his own country, Musharraf told CNN.

 Afghanistan is facing an increasingly vicious insurgency by the Taliban, who have been fighting since they were ousted shortly after the September 11 attacks when Pakistan dropped support for the radical Islamists.

 Although Pakistan officially ended its support, many Afghans are convinced the Taliban could not survive and fight without the benefit of Pakistani refuges from where they plot and launch attacks into Afghanistan. Pakistan has long rejected such accusations. 

 Border clashes

 Pakistani security forces battled Islamist rebels holding out in a town near the Afghan border today, killing 19 of them as the toll from three days of clashes rose to more than 120, the military said.

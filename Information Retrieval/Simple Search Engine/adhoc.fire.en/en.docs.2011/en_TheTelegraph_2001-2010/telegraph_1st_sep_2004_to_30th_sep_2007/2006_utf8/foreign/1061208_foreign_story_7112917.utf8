 Russia opens probe

 Moscow, Dec. 7 (Reuters): Russian prosecutors today launched their own murder investigation into the death of Alexander Litvinenko from radiation poisoning as the Russian former spy was buried at a rain-soaked ceremony in London.

 Prosecutors also opened a criminal case into what they said was the attempted murder of Dmitry Kovtun, a Russian businessman who met Litvinenko at the time he fell ill. Kovtun has symptoms of radiation poisoning, the prosecutors said.

 British detectives also pursued their inquiries in Moscow in the politically-charged case. They and Russian investigators yesterday interviewed Kovtun who, with fellow businessman and ex-KGB spy Andrei Lugovoy, met Litvinenko in a London hotel on November 1. Kovtun is in critical condition in hospital from radiation poisoning.

 The Russian prosecutor-general has opened a criminal case in connection with the murder of Russian citizen Alexander Litvinenko and the attempted murder of Russian citizen Dmitry Kovtun, a statement said.

 A prosecution source said the move would help them cooperate with their British colleagues murder inquiry. Russian investigators might fly to London to make their own inquiries, said the source.

 Letters shed light on Einsteins affairs

 Einstein: Love theory

 Jerusalem, July 10 (Reuters): Albert Einstein had half a dozen girlfriends and told his wife they showered him with unwanted affection, according to letters released today that shed light on his extra-marital affairs.

 The wild-haired Jewish-German scientist, renowned for his theory of relativity, spent little time at home. He lectured in Europe and in the US, where he died in 1955 at age 76. But Einstein wrote hundreds of letters to his family.

 Previously-released letters suggested that his marriage in 1903 to his first wife Mileva Maric, mother of his two sons, was miserable. They divorced in 1919 and he soon married his cousin, Elsa. He cheated on her with his secretary, Betty Neumann.

 In the new volume of letters released today by Hebrew University in Jerusalem, Einstein described about six women with whom he spent time with while being married to Elsa. In the early 1980s, Elsas daughter Margot gave almost 1,400 letters to Hebrew University. But Margot directed that the letters not be released publicly until 20 years after her death. She died on July 8, 1986. 

 Some of the women identified by Einstein include Estella, Ethel, Toni, and his Russian spy lover, Margarita. Others are referred to only by initials, like M. and L.

 It is true that M. followed me (to England) and her chasing after me is getting out of control, he wrote in a letter to Margot in 1931. Out of all the dames, I am in fact attached only to Mrs L., who is absolutely harmless and decent. 

 In another post to Margot, Einstein asked his stepdaughter to pass on a little letter for Margarita, to avoid providing curious eyes with tidbits.

 The new batch of letters, for the first time, included replies from Einsteins family, Hanoch Gutfreund, chairman of the Albert Einstein Worldwide Exhibition at Hebrew University said.

 This, he said, helped shatter myths that the Nobel Prize-winning scientist was always cold towards his family. In these letters he acts with much greater friendship and understanding to Mileva and his sons, Gutfeund said.

 Putin cross with UK on spy

 Taking exception

 London, Dec. 3 (PTI): The espionage saga unravelled with the death of a former Russian spy could trigger a diplomatic dust-up with President Vladimir Putin reportedly expressing his anger at Britains failure to gag him in the final hours of his life.

 British foreign secretary Margaret Beckett told her cabinet colleagues that the Russian government had taken exception to the defectors deathbed letter accusing the Putin regime of his murder, a leading British newspaper claimed today.

 Beckett, who spoke to her Russian counterpart before Thursdays cabinet meeting, said the Russians had seemingly failed to understand that Alexander Litvinenko was under police supervision rather than in custody.

 British Prime Minister Tony Blair concluded the cabinet meeting by saying the most important issue was likely to be Britains long-term relationship with Moscow, Londons Sunday Times said. The foreign office officials yesterday confirmed the Russians had raised the issue of Litvinenkos letter with Beckett and British diplomats, it said. 

 Until now, the government has admitted only that the Russians had agreed to assist Scotland Yard with its inquiries.

 Litvinenko, 43, a former KGB agent who was a fierce critic of Putin, died late last month after falling gravely ill from what doctors said was poisoning by the radioactive element polonium-210.

 In interviews before his death, Litvinenko claimed he was ordered to hire assassins to kill rivals to Kremlin-favoured business leaders and execute whistle-blowers who threatened to expose corruption. He told police he believed he had been poisoned on November 1 while investigating the killing of Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya, another critic of Putin. 

 The FBI is now also involved in the probe into the death of Litvinenko after details emerged that he planned to blackmail Russian security and business bigwigs.

 British police and US sleuths also interviewed former KGB agent Yuri Shvets after he claimed that he had vital information regarding Litvinenkos death. 

 A business associate of Shvets said Litvinenko had a dossier in his possession containing potentially damaging revelations about Moscow and the break-up of Yukos oil company. Yukos was owned by Mikhail Khodorkovsky who is currently serving nine years in prison for tax evasion.

 Man detained

 Britains domestic security service MI5 has detained a man thought to have significant information about the apparent radiation death of Alexander Litvinenko, the Sunday Mirror has said, reports AFP.

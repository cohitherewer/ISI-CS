 Charles due, Pak to hang Briton

 Islamabad, Oct. 18 (AFP): Pakistan sparked a row with Britain today after saying it would hang a British national during an upcoming visit by Prince Charles and his wife Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall.

 British Prime Minister Tony Blair urged Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf to halt the execution of Mirza Tahir Hussain scheduled on November 1 and warned of very serious consequences if it goes ahead.

 Musharraf has already ordered three stays of execution for Hussain, 36, who has spent half his life in a Pakistani jail for killing a taxi driver and who at one point had his conviction quashed.

 Mirza Tahir Hussains new execution date is November 1, an official at Adiala prison in Rawalpindi said.

 The third extension given to him by the President was until October 1. Before that the jail authorities wrote a letter to the court seeking orders to hang the convict on expiry of the stay, the official added. The court issued an order last week fixing the execution on November 1, as there are no executions during Ramazan.

 Nepal rally

 Kathmandu, July 26 (Reuters): Hundreds of Nepalis protested in Kathmandu today against an alleged delay in holding elections to decide the restive nations political future.

 About 2,000 lawyers, journalists, human rights activists, students and teachers held a sit-down protest on a major street in the temple-studded city. They were demanding early polls to a special assembly to write a new constitution for Nepal ? as promised by the interim government.

 We think there is undue delay in dissolving parliament and announcing the date for elections to the (constituent) assembly, said Devendra Raj Pandey, chief of civil society group Movement for Democracy and Peace, which organised the rally. Therefore, we are cautioning the government. 

 The protesters carried placards, 

 some of which read: Long live democratic republic.

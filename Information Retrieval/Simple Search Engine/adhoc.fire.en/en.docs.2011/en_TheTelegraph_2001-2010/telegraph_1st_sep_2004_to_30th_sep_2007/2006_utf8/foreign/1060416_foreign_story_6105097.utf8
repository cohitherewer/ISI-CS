Batticaloa (Sri Lanka), April 15 (Reuters): The Tamil Tigers said today they were pulling out of peace talks with the Sri Lankan government as two blasts killed seven servicemen, fuelling fears of renewed civil war on the island.

 The Tigers said their withdrawal from talks in Geneva aimed at saving a faltering 2002 ceasefire was due to problems with a requested safe-conduct transport of rebel commanders.

 The Tigers were concerned about Sri Lankan navy plans to monitor a boat that was to have taken the commanders based in the east and their Nordic escorts today to the Tigers northern base, the head of the Tiger peace secretariat said. It is very important we meet our commanders, S. Puleedevan said. We have cancelled the transport. If we cannot meet them, Geneva is off.

 The army accused the rebels of then carrying out two attacks with claymore fragmentation mines that killed seven servicemen and wounded several in the Tamil-dominated north and east.

 The rebels accused the military for an attack in their territory they say killed one rebel and one rebel civilian supporter. Each denies the others accusations, but diplomats are more inclined to believe the government.

 Swedish Major-General Ulf Henricsson, head of the unarmed Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission tasked with monitoring the truce, said the Tigers had initially agreed to allow the navy to monitor the rebel vessel from a distance.

 Im worried about the situation for Sri Lankan people of all ethnic groups, Henricsson said outside the monitoring missions eastern Batticaloa office shortly after hearing the Tigers no longer wanted the transport.

 Those in positions of responsibility on either side are not acting in the interests of their people.

 The island is being pushed to the brink of war for the second time this year. In January, fighters on both sides believed war was imminent until levels of violence fell after the Tigers agreed to the first round of Geneva talks. 

 Yesterday, the two sides had agreed to postpone the talks from April 19-21 to April 24-25 to accommodate a rebel council meeting.

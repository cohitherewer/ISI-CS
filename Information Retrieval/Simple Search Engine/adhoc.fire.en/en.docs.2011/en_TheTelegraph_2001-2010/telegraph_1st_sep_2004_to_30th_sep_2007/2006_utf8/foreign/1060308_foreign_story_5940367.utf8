 Pervez uneasy with warming Indo-US ties

 Musharraf: Impatient

 Islamabad, March 7 (Reuters): Warming US ties with India are playing on Pakistani insecurities at a time when President Pervez Musharraf is under fire for the conduct of a war on terrorism forced on him by the US.

 Analysts say by the time President George W. Bush arrived home on Sunday at the end of a South Asia tour, Pakistan had little new to show for an alliance with Washington that has pitted its army against its own people on the Afghan border.

 To add to Pakistans chagrin, before coming to Islamabad Bush struck an accord in New Delhi to provide arch rival India with American knowhow for its civilian nuclear programme.

 There was a sharp contrast between the treatment meted out to India and Pakistan, said Talat Masood, a retired general turned political commentator.

 Some analysts believe hardliners in the army could be growing impatient with both the conduct of the war on terrorism, and Musharrafs inability to get more support from the US in dealings with India.

 Meeting Pakistani media yesterday, President Pervez Musharraf played down rivalry with India, saying Pakistan did not share its neighbours global and regional aspirations.

 We are not in competition with India, he said, declaring Pakistans priorities were defensive and the creation of jobs and reduction of poverty. But Masood said the US aim to build up India as a regional counterweight to China would inevitably fuel Pakistani unease. 

 Whether the fears of Indian hegemony are real or imagined, it has heightened Pakistans insecurities.

 Pakistan has lurched in and out of military rule in the 59 years since it sprang into being from the partition of India. Both India and Afghanistan have regularly accused Pakistan of using militant groups to try to destabilise them.

 Since joining a US-led war on terrorism in 2001, Musharraf has been the target of several assassination attempts, with several junior military men convicted of involvement in plots.

 The real agenda of Bush in Pakistan is to speed up military operations in the tribal areas, Qazi Hussain Ahmad, leader of the six-party Islamist Opposition alliance, Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, wrote in the News on Sunday.

 The height of misfortune is that our armed forces are on the warpath with their own nation, wrote Ahmed, who had spent Bushs visit under house arrest to stop him leading protests.

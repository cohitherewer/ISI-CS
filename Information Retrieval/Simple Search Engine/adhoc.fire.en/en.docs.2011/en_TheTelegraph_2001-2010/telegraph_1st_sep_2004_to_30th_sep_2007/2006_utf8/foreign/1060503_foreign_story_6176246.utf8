 Last TV tango

 Berlin, May 2 (Reuters): Former German politician Heide Simonis says her embarrassing performance in a dance contest will be her last tango on television.

 Simonis, 62, was a respected state premier for 12 years and her styleless dancing has delighted audiences and pushed up the ratings each week at RTL for its Lets Dance programme.

 Despite criticism, she has stayed in the competition thanks to call-in voters who want to see her in the next round.

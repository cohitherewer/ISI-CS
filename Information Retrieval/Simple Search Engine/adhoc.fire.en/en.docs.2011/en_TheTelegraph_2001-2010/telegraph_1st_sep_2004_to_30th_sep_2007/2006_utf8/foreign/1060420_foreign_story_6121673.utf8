 China sells prisoner organs, say UK doctors

 London, April 19 (Reuters): British transplant experts accused China today of removing organs from executed prisoners without their consent in order to sell them.

 The British Transplantation Society (BTS) said there is an accumulating body of evidence that suggests organs of executed prisoners are being removed for transplants and sold without the prior consent of the prisoners or their families.

 Although the exact number of organs taken from prisoners is unknown, the BTS said the figure could be in the thousands.

 The British Transplantation Society condemns unreservedly any activity that transgresses an individuals human rights or involves the coercion of an individual to become an organ donor, Stephen Wigmore, chairman of the BTS ethics committee, said in a statement.

 The alleged use of organs from executed prisoners without consent is considered a breach of human rights and is an unacceptable practice, he added.

 Human rights groups have also criticised the use of organs from executed prisoners and the hospitals that have allegedly turned to organ sales and transplants to raise funds.

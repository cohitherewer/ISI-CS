 Pak relents over scribe murder

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Islamabad, June 20: Due to mounting pressure from journalists angered by the murder of scribe Hayatullah Khan, the Pakistan government today accepted their demands to provide justice to Khans family.

 Khans bullet-ridden body was found last Friday near his ancestral town of Mir Ali in the restive North Waziristan tribal region after he went missing six months ago in North Waziristan.

 Information minister Muhammad Ali Durrani met a five-member committee of Pakistani journalists today and accepted a seven-point charter of demands, which will provide justice to Khans family, Afzal Butt, one of the journalists, said.

 The journalists are demanding that a fact-finding mission be sent to North Waziristan, a substantial compensation be paid to Khans family, criminals involved in his murder be arrested within fifteen days and the judicial commission report on Khans murder be ready in one month. Following the government decision, the journalists ended the boycott of the National Assembly.

 Keira butt of Oscar jokes

 Knightley: Miffed

 Los Angeles, Feb. 15 (AFP): British starlet Keira Knightley revealed that her Pirates of the Caribbean co-stars including heartthrob Johnny Depp were making fun of her for winning an Oscar nomination.

 Knightley, 20, the youngest 2006 Academy Award nominee, said her fellow actors were not showing here any special reverence at all. 

 He just laughed at me, Knightley said when asked what Depps reaction had been when he learned of her nomination while the pair were filming the two Pirates sequels in the Bahamas.

 Theyve all been taking the piss out of me mercilessly, she joked to reporters in Beverly Hills. Every time I do a take, they go: Is that an Oscar-nominated take, then? Knightley said.

 The actress said her mother awoke her in the Bahamas to tell her she had been nominated, revealing that she then fell back to sleep only to wake up a little later giggling.

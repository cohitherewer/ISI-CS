 Study: Lack of sleep harmful

 Snooze works 

 Chicago, Sept. 18 (Reuters): Chronic sleeplessness aggravates and might cause numerous health problems, including depression, by wearing down the bodys immune system, researchers said today.

 As many as half of Americans experience some sleep problems during the course of a year and one-quarter have chronic difficulties sleeping that may be harming their health.

 Good quality sleep should be considered an essential component of a healthy lifestyle, as much as exercise and nutrition, said researcher Phyllis Zee of Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago.

 Zee, who co-authored an editorial commenting on several studies in this months issue of the of Internal Medicine examining the repercussions of sleep disorders, said scientists have yet to fully understand the mechanisms by which lack of sleep hurts the body.

 We do know that people who get less than seven hours of sleep a day are at higher risk of metabolic disorders and cardiovascular disease, she said in a telephone interview.

 Lack of sleep appears to increase levels of cytokines, which are molecules released by the immune system that control the bodys immune response. The resulting inflammation may be responsible for a host of ills from heart disease to diabetes to neurological diseases.

 It may be that sleep refreshes the immune system and resets the bodys autonomic nervous system that controls bodily functions, researchers said.

 What is it about sleep and sleep duration that ... effects changes in metabolism, changes in cardiovascular function? We just dont know, Zee said.

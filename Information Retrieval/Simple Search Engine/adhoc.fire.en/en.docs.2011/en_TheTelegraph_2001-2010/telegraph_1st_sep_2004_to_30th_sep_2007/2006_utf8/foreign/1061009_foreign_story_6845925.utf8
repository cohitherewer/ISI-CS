 Muzaffarabad, Oct. 8 (Reuters): Pakistan today united in mourning in memory of about 73,000 people killed in an earthquake exactly a year ago, while survivors vented frustration over the pace of reconstruction.

 Almost two weeks into Ramazan, Pakistans mosques have been even more crowded than usual.

 Today, worshippers prayed in unison for the dead and survivors alike to mark the first anniversary of the nations worst disaster.

 This day has revived my sorrows because I have lost many loved ones, said Abdul Rahim in Muzaffarabad. May God give courage to our new generation to rebuild this city, said Rahim, 65, as he waited for a commemoration ceremony to begin at a stadium near the Pakistan Kashmir capitals ruined university.

 Sirens sounded across the nation for a minutes silence.

 The quake struck at 8.52 am on a Saturday morning, at a time when schools and government offices were full.

 With an intensity measured at 7.6, it lasted less than two minutes, yet destroyed the homes of more than three million people in North West Frontier Province and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.

 There was a memorial service held in Islamabad to remember those killed in the Margala Towers the only building in the capital to collapse. 

 An overnight vigil was held at the site of the ten-storey residential block, where nearly 50 people died, many of them foreigners.

 Addressing the commemoration in Muzaffarabad, President Pervez Musharraf gave assurances that the bulk of rebuilding would be completed within two or three years, and that allegations of corruption would be dealt with firmly.

 With the grace of god, things are heading towards much improvement, said Musharraf.

 With a second winter just a couple of months away, and many victims still living in tents or makeshift shelters, critics accused the government authority overseeing rebuilding of dragging its feet in dispensing funds and setting appropriate guidelines for earthquake-proof construction of new homes.

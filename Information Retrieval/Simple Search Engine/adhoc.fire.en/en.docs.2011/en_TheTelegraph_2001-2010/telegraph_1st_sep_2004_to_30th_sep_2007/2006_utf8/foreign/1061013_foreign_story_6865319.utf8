The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Bodybags pile up at Jaffna

 Colombo, Oct. 12 (Reuters): 

 Sri Lankas Tamil Tiger rebels today handed over the 

 bodies of 74 soldiers killed in a battle a day earlier to 

 the Red Cross, taking the armys death toll in one 

 of the worst clashes since a 2002 truce to at least 129.

 Nearly 300 soldiers were wounded in the fighting yesterday around the besieged government-held enclave of Jaffna in the far north. The violence is spurring fears that peace talks scheduled for the end of the month may be cancelled.

 Today, a suspected rebel roadside bomb attack in Jaffna killed five people. Artillery duels continued to rage in the area. Residents heard fighter jets fly towards Tiger territory and explosions in the distance. We have handed over the dead. We have also recovered a large amount of weapons, including 98 semi-automatic rifles and a light anti-tank weapon, said Tiger military spokesman Rasiah Ilanthiraiyan. This is very good. As usual, we will take these weapons and use them against the military to fight for the freedom of our homeland.

 The military had already recovered the bodies of 55 troops killed during yesterdays battle. A huge total of 283 soldiers were wounded. It accused the Tigers of capturing soldiers and murdering them in cold blood. The military believes it killed around 200 Tiger rebels. The rebels say 22 of their fighters died. Red Cross officials were taking the 74 corpses to the southern border crossing between government and Tiger territory, where they were to be handed over to the military. The Tigers and the military accuse each other of provoking yesterdays fighting.

 Big day for Ban in hour of blast

 Ban Ki-moon: Positive move

 United Nations, Oct. 9 (Reuters): South Korean foreign minister Ban Ki-moon was formally nominated as UN secretary-general today, only hours after North Korea defied the world body by announcing a nuclear test.

 The UN Security Council voted by acclamation behind closed doors, thereby effectively selecting Ban as successor to secretary-general Kofi Annan, whose 10 years in office expire on December 31. Bans six rivals had withdrawn from the race earlier.

 The 192-member UN General Assembly must give final approval to Bans nomination, which usually follows within a week or two. That vote is expected to be positive.

 Ban, speaking to reporters in Seoul after the Security Council vote, said North Koreas test was a grave and direct threat to peace and stability on the Korean peninsula and Northeast Asia.

 This should be a moment of joy but instead I stand here with a very heavy heart, he said.

 Shortly after nominating Ban, the 15 Security Council ambassadors went into closed consultations on North Korea to see what action could be taken after Pyongyang announcement of a successful nuclear weapon test. The council on Friday had urged North Korea not to carry out a test.

 I think the fact the candidate is current foreign minister of the Republic of Korea is an asset in dealing with the situation in the Korean peninsula that we are now facing, Japans UN ambassador Kenzo Oshima said.

 Some diplomats, including Oshima, have speculated that North Koreas October 3 announcement of plans to carry out the underground nuclear test was timed, in part, to coincide with Bans candidacy in an effort to get world attention.

 Ban, 62, would be the eighth secretary-general in the world bodys 60-year history. He will inherit a bureaucracy of 9,000 staff, a $5 billion budget and more than 90,000 peacekeepers in 18 operations around the globe that cost another $5 billion.

 US ambassador John Bolton immediately emphasised the need for UN management reform. With this vote today, the winds of change at the UN have started to rise and we are looking forward to some significant steps in the reform process when he takes office, he said.

 Pope pleads for Jakarta clemency

 Jakarta/Vatican City, Aug. 11 (Reuters): Pope Benedict called on Indonesia today to stop the imminent execution of three Christian militants convicted of killing Muslims, as thousands of Indonesians held a prayer vigil opposing the death penalty.

 Fabianus Tibo, Marianus Riwu and Dominggus Silva were to face a firing squad at a secret location in Palu, the capital of Central Sulawesi province, a spokesman for the Indonesian attorney general has said.

 Vatican secretary of state Angelo Sodano said on behalf of the Pope that clemency should be granted on humanitarian grounds for the three men who were found guilty of leading a Christian mob in an attack which killed more than 200 people.

 Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono had rejected the three mens appeals for a pardon last year.

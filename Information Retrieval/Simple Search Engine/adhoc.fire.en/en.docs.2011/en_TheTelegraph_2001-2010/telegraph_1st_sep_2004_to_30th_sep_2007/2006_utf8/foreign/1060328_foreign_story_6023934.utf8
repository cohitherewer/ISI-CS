 Putin accused of plagiarism

 Washington, March 27 (PTI): Russian President Vladimir Putin, famed for his multi-faceted career which includes being a KGB spy, has now been labelled a plagiarist by US researchers, a media report has said.

 Large chunks of Putins mid-1990s economics dissertation on planning in the natural resources sector were lifted straight out of a management text published by two University of Pittsburgh academics nearly 20 years earlier, Washington researchers have insisted, The Washington Times said.

 Six diagrams and tables from the 218-page dissertation mimic in form and content similar charts in the Russian translation of the Americanswork as well.

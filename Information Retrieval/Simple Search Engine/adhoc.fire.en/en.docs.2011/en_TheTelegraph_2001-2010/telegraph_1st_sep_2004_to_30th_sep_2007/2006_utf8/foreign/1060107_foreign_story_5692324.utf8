 Fine Print

 Noddys Whizz

 London, Jan. 6 (Reuters): Noddy, one of Britains best-loved childrens characters, has a new friend ? Whizz the Robot, on a mission to teach foreign languages.

 Whizz is the first new character to appear in the Enid Blyton cartoon in nearly 15 years.

 Whizzing around on his red and yellow skates, he will introduce pre-school children to different languages as co-presenter of Say It With Noddy, a new television series .

 The first language is Mandarin, followed by French, Spanish, Swahili and Urdu.

 Each of the 100 episodes is based on a word that featured in the preceding Noddy programme. Whizz introduces the word and its translation to Noddy and then encourages the audience to join in.

 Obese pets

 London (Reuters): Just like their owners, 

 a growing number of British pets are becoming obese and 

 face chronic illnesses such as heart complaint, diabetes 

 and arthritis, according to research. A survey showed that 

 one in three pets, or 33 per cent, were considered overweight 

 and 38 per cent of pet owners said their animals put on 

 weight over Christmas.

 Penny wise

Unhappy when his Canadian bank began outsourcing some of its credit card processing to the US, the man lodged his protest via the banks online payment system, jamming its computers by making dozens of tiny payments a day.

 Empty chairs at UN high table

 United Nations, Feb. 3 (Reuters): John Bolton, Washingtons feisty UN ambassador, tried to open his first meeting as head of the Security Council at 10 am sharp yesterday ? and was irked to find no other diplomats showed up.

 I brought the gavel down at 10. I was the only one in the room, Bolton said. The US has just assumed the rotating presidency of the 15-nation council for the month of February.

 I believe in discipline. I think daily briefings constitute a form of intellectual discipline. Starting on time is a form of discipline, Bolton said. I failed today.

 I took a list of when they (council members) came in, Bolton said. We started just before 10:15.

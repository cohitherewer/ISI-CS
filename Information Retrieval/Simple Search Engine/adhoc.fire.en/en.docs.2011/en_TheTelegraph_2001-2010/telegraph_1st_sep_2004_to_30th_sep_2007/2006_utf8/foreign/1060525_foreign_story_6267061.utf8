The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Cate to play young Dylan

 HUGH DAVIES

 Cannes, May 24: Bob Dylan is 65 today, and its been announced that an Australian actress is to play him in a film.

 Cate Blanchett confirmed at the Cannes Film Festival yesterday that she will depict the early Dylan in Im Not There, the first Hollywood film that he has authorised on his peripatetic life.

 Heath Ledger, the star of Brokeback Mountain, Richard Gere, Christian Bale and Ben Wishaw will depict Dylan at other times in his life. Final details of the film, which was first announced three years ago, were given in Cannes. The producers called it a ferocious musical romp.

 Shooting will start in Montreal in July, with one more Dylan to be cast. Colin Farrell, who was to have portrayed the singer in the 1970s, has dropped out.

 Dylan is said to be so keen on the film that he is giving the director, Todd Haynes, access to his complete back catalogue. The singer is also relinquishing his half of the publishing income to keep the budget down to ?13.2 million.

 Haynes said: Bob Dylan was somebody who has rejected all of the various personas that he has embodied over the years. He continues to move forward by discarding himself, so my idea is to put together a film of multiple characters and tell their stories simultaneously. Its going to be weird, not a traditional narrative by any means.

 Dylan, who has been on never-ending tour since 1988, and returns to Britain next month, is not expected to appear himself.

 Cuffs off

 Chicago, Jan. 22 (Reuters): A Chicago woman arrested for drunken driving slipped off her handcuffs and drove away in a police cruiser, police said on Saturday.

 Veronique Armour, 22, was stopped early on Friday as she drove in the wrong lane on a city street. While a police officer was removing her 1995 Honda Civic hatchback from the street, she somehow escaped the handcuffs and drove away in the officers cruiser, police spokeswoman Joann Taylor said.

 Rice call

 Washington, May 6 (Reuters): US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice called her close friend, outgoing British foreign secretary Jack Straw yesterday after he was dumped from his key post.

 It was, from her perspective, I think, a bittersweet call, said state department spokesman Sean McCormack, adding that Rice counted Straw as both a close personal friend and colleague whom she could rely on.

 McCormack said Rice also called Straws successor, Margaret Beckett, and was looking forward to working with her. The two will meet next week during talks in New York to discuss West Asia, Iran and Sudan.

 There are a lot of tough issues on the agenda, but there are no closer allies than the US and the UK in facing up to these issues that are before us, said McCormack.

 Straws demotion ? after Prime Minister Tony Blairs ruling Labour Partys poor showing in local elections ? came little over a month after Rice visited his hometown of Blackburn in northern England, a trip memorable for the throngs of noisy, mostly Muslim, anti-war protesters that dogged her every stop.

 The British media lampooned Straw and Rice in cartoons during the visit, after which the two left protesters behind and went together on a secret trip to Iraq. Britain has been the USs closest ally in the Iraq war.

 The visit to Blackburn followed one last year by Straw to Rices hometown of Birmingham, Alabama, where the two enjoyed a largely positive reception for their backyard diplomacy.

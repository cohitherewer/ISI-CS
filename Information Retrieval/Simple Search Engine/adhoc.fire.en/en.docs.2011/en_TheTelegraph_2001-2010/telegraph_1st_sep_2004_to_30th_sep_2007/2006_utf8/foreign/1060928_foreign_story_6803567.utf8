 Japan bid to break China ice

 Tokyo, Sept. 27 (Reuters): Japan wants to hold a leaders meeting with China in October, foreign minister Taro Aso said today, adding that a visit to Beijing by new Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was one option.

 China had refused to meet Abes predecessor Junichiro Koizumi since April 2005 because of his visits to a Tokyo war shrine seen as a symbol of past militarism, and South Korea had shunned full-scale two-way talks after the middle of that year.

 Aso said the change in Japans government provided a chance to resume the summits. Wed like to hold it sometime in October, said Aso, who was reappointed as Japans top diplomat yesterday after the hawkish Abe became Prime Minister.

 Asked if this meant that Abe might visit the giant Asian neighbour, Aso said Japan should look into all options.

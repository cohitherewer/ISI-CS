 Corpus Christi (Texas), Feb. 18 (Reuters): Texas lawyer Harry Whittington, bearing bruises and pockmarks from birdshot but considering himself lucky, prepared to leave the hospital yesterday and said the hunting incident in which vice-president Dick Cheney shot him was just an accident.

 Whittington, 78, said he was sorry for all the trouble the incident had caused Cheney, as he spoke with reporters at the hospital for the first time since the Saturday shooting.

 Doctors said Whittington was in excellent health and would be discharged from Christus Spohn Hospital, where he was taken after Cheney shot him during a quail hunt. Wearing a coat and tie and standing at a podium filled with microphones, the tall, dignified Whittingtons voice broke as he praised the medical care he has received. 

 We all assume certain risks in whatever we do. Regardless of how experienced, careful and dedicated we are, accidents do and will happen, Whittington said.

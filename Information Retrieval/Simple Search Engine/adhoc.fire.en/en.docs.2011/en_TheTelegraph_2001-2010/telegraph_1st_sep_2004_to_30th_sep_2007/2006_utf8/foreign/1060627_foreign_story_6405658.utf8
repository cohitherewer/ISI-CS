The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 In US, nothing stays secret

 Washington, June 26 (Reuters): Almost every piece of personal information that Americans try to keep secret ? including bank account statements, e-mail messages and telephone records ? is semi-public and available for sale.

 That was the lesson Congress learned over the last week during a series of hearings aimed at exposing peddlers of personal data, from whom banks, car dealers, jealous lovers and even some law enforcement officers have covertly purchased information to use as they wish.

 US house energy and commerce committee members also hoped the hearings would help to outlaw the practice. 

 We had the impression that there were no secrets any more. Now we know that for sure, said Representative Ed Whitfield, a Kentucky Republican and chairman of the panels oversight subcommittee.

 He described a multimillion dollar industry that sells cellphone records for $200, Social Security information for $60 and a students university class schedule for $80.

 Most often, the customers are banks or financial institutions attempting to locate absconding debtors. But law enforcement officers ? including those in the department of homeland security and FBI ? have used the services on occasion.

 The problem has been that data brokers often have obtained information by deception, and they did not monitor to whom they were selling or how the data was used, lawmakers said.

 Such information, for example, could allow a stalker to find a victim or a threatening husband to find a spouse, said Representative Diana DeGette, who lamented that for $300 buyers can purchase the location of a cellphone that a person carries daily.

 Witnesses also testified that in one instance an undercover Los Angeles police officer was killed after drug dealers used a data broker to retrieve his beeper information.

 Mona Lisa the mum 

 Ottawa, Sept. 27 (Reuters): Mona Lisa, the mysterious woman immortalised in Leonardo da Vincis 16th century masterpiece, had just given birth to her second son when she sat for the painting, a French art expert has said.

 The discovery was made by a team of Canadian scientists who used special infrared and three-dimensional technology to peer through hitherto impenetrable paint layers on the work, which now sits in the Louvre museum in Paris.

 Bruno Mottin of the French Museums Center for Research and Restoration said it has become clear that the Mona Lisas dress was covered in a thin transparent gauze veil.

 This type of gauze dress... was typical of the kind worn in early 16th century Italy by women who were pregnant or who had just given birth. This is something that had never been seen up to now because the painting was always judged to be dark and difficult to examine, he said. 

 We can now say this was painted to commemorate the birth of the second son of the Mona Lisa that helps us to date it precisely to around 1503.

 The young woman with the ambiguous half smile has been identified as Lisa Gherardini, wife of Florentine merchant Francesco de Giocondo. She had five children.

 Mottin said, contrary to popular belief, the subject had not let her hair hang freely. 

 People always wrote the Mona Lisa had allowed her hair to hang freely over her shoulders. This surprised historians because letting your hair hang freely during the Renaissance was typical of young girls and women of poor virtue.

 Wolfowitz in image makeover bid

 Wolfowitz: Pro-poor

 Washington, April 23: At the opening of the annual spring meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund on Thursday, a small group of protesters chanted: Corporate corruption, who can we thank?/ The IMF and the World Bank! 

 In less than a minute, security guards hustled the noisy protesters out of the news conference. 

 That the moment, captured in Webcasts, fizzled so quickly was a sign of the surprising lack of controversy surrounding the 10-month tenure of Paul D. Wolfowitz as president of the World Bank, one of the most important anti-poverty institutions. 

 Wolfowitz, a former Pentagon official who became a lightning rod for criticism of the Iraq war and who was mocked by filmmaker Michael Moore in Fahrenheit 9/11 for fussing with his hair, has defused much of the opposition from advocacy groups. 

 Early in his tenure, he worked behind the scenes to push for debt relief, a cause popularised by the rock star Bono. On Friday, he announced that he had enough votes from bank shareholders to approve $37 billion in debt relief to 17 of the worlds poorest countries, mostly in Africa. 

 He didnt have to do that, said Max Lawson, a policy adviser with Oxfam. 

 Wolfowitz has laid claim to the mantle of anti-corruption crusader. In recent months, he has blocked or cancelled more than $1 billion in loans to many developing countries. But he has done it in a way that appealed to both conservatives, who worry that aid is disappearing down a rat hole, and to anti-corporate activists who fear that it is being stolen from the poor by corrupt rulers. 

 He has also on occasion shown a willingness to nip the hand of the Bush administration that used to feed him ? a tendency that has lessened suspicions that his appointment to head the World Bank would simply impose American interests. At a news conference on Friday, he gently chided the US for the relatively small sums it gives to help educate the 100 million children in the developing world who are not in school. 

 Certainly there is harsh criticism of Wolfowitz, but it seems tempered by a sense that his approach offers a chance for change at the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, a lumbering institution often berated as secretive, bureaucratic and ineffective in dispensing billions of dollars in very low interest loans each year to poor countries. 

 At a bacon-and-eggs news conference on Friday morning at the Old Ebbitt Grill, a clutch of advocacy groups ? with leaders from India , the Czech Republic and the Philippines ? laid out some of their recommendations for reform. 

 The bank needs stronger protections for its own whistleblowers, they said. It should forgive debts incurred by thieving dictators. Its lending should be subjected to parliamentary oversight in developing countries with vital democracies. And it needs to even more comprehensively investigate allegations of corruption, especially those involving multinational corporations..

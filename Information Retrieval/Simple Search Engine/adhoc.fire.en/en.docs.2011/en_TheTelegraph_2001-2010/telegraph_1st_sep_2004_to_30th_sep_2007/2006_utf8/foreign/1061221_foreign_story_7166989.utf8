 Gay nativity sparks furore

 Rome, Dec. 20 (Reuters): Two Leftists in Italys ruling coalition today outraged fellow lawmakers by placing four dolls representing homosexual couples near the baby Jesus in the official nativity scene in parliament.

 The two parliamentarians from the small Rose in the Fist party said their gesture was to promote the legalisation of gay marriage.

 Bruno Mellano and Donatella Poretti placed the Barbie and Ken-type dolls in the parliamentary nativity scene, each couple lying down embraced among the shepherds witnessing the birth of Jesus.

 Each of the two doll couples wore miniature placards with slogans in favour of gay rights.

 Beijing, Oct. 15 (AP): A Romanian TV station has released a video that it said shows Chinese forces fatally shooting a Tibetan refugee who was with a group of people trying to flee to Nepal in an incident that prompted an international outcry.

 The video from Pro TV shows a distant figure that its narrator says is a Chinese border guard firing a rifle and a separate scene of a person in a line of figures walking through the snow falling to the ground. An unidentified man near the camera can be heard saying in English: They are shooting them like, like dogs.

 Pro TV, Romanias biggest private TV station, said it was shot on September 30 by Sergiu Matei, a cameraman with an expedition climbing Cho Oyu, a Himalayan peak near Chinas border with Nepal.

 Activist group International Campaign for Tibet said the video proves Chinese troops fired at unarmed Tibetans and disproves Beijings statement on Thursday that its forces acted in self-defence after being attacked.

 The figures in most of the video are too far from the camera up to 1 km, according to the narrator to make out their identities. The scene of the man firing a rifle doesnt show what he is shooting at. The person shown falling gets up and starts to run, but a separate scene later shows a shape in the snow that the narrator says is the body of a dead Tibetan man. Men in Chinese military-style uniforms with rifles or machine guns are shown walking through the snow.

 They were shot like rabbits, Matei said.

 Witnesses quoted by human rights groups say at least one person, a 25-year-old Tibetan Buddhist nun, was killed in the shooting at the 19,028-foot-high Nanpa La Pass.

 The pass is a common escape route for fleeing Tibetans. Thousands have left for Nepal since communist forces occupied their Himalayan homeland in 1951. Some make their way to India, the home of the Dalai Lama.

 China said its forces killed one person when they clashed with some 70 people trying to leave the country illegally. It said a second person died later. It didnt say whether those involved were Tibetans.

 The incident was first reported in accounts posted on websites for mountaineers. Climbers in the area said Chinese troops put rifles to their shoulders and fired at Tibetans crossing the pass.

 Witnesses said troops detained 10 to 12 frightened-looking Tibetan children.

 The video released by Pro TV shows three children walking in single file ahead of men in Chinese military-style uniforms with guns slung over their shoulders. A Tibetan man is shown hiding in a climbers tent.

 Matei said he hid the Tibetan man for 12 hours and then showed him the quickest route across the glacier.

 Keira gown for charity

 Keira: Generous

 London, April 7 (Reuters): Britains Keira Knightley, who was nominated for a best actress award at last months Oscars, has donated the Vera Wang dress she wore at the ceremony to Oxfam to raise money for their work in East Africa.

 Knightley, 21, wore a one-shouldered, deep-claret gown to the awards where she was nominated for her role in Pride amp; Prejudice.

 The dress will be auctioned on the eBay website. Bidding will begin on April 21 and finish on April 30 with all proceeds going to Oxfams East African Food Crisis Appeal.

 This is such an amazing dress and I am really pleased to be able to donate it to Oxfam, the actor said. I have seen the TV reports on the horrendous drought in East Africa and... I am happy to be able to do something to help.

 Oxfams Paul Smith-Lomas said the charity was currently providing food and water to people in East Africa, where millions face hunger and hardship due to a drought since late 2005. Donations like this will help to fund this vital work, he said.

 The dress is currently on display at an Oxfam shop in Notting Hill, London. Knightley missed out on the Oscar award to Reese Witherspoon.

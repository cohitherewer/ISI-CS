 London, Dec. 19: A second man has been arrested by police hunting the killer of five prostitutes in Suffolk.

 Police said a 48-year-old man was arrested at 5 am (GMT) this morning at his home in Ipswich, less than 24 hours after Tom Stephens, a 37-year-old supermarket worker and friend of all five of the murdered women, was detained at his home near Felixstowe.

 Chief superintendent Stewart Gull announced the latest arrest at a short press conference this morning. He said: The man has been arrested on suspicion of murdering all five women. He is currently in custody at a police station in Suffolk where he will be questioned about the deaths later.

 Police cordoned off a long stretch of London Road, near Ipswichs red-light district, where a large white tent had been erected outside No 79.

 As forensic experts and search teams began the search for evidence, officers loaded a dark blue Ford Mondeo parked outside the bedsit where the suspect was arrested onto a transporter.

 Sky News said the man was known to prostitutes in the area as a client. One described him as an just an ordinary punter. 

 Unemployed Alfie Smith, 60, said he saw a man being led out of an address in London Road at around 5 am. I live opposite where the police went to. I saw lots of policemen. They just took this man out and away he went in a car.

 I didnt see his face he sort of had his head turned away. The man was just in his night clothes. I just saw all the police and didnt really know what was going on. 

 It was very frightening.

 Beni Patel, who owns a B amp;B opposite the bedsit said she did not know the man who had been arrested.

 They have cordoned the place off and they have been searching it, she said.

 His car has been searched thoroughly and towed. Theyve taken the car, and one lane is closed, cordoned off.

 Stephens, a former special constable, remains in custody at a police station in Suffolk, and earlier today a superintendent gave detectives a further 12 hours to interview him. If detectives wish to hold him for longer they will have to apply to a magistrates court. Detectives can interview him for a maximum of 96 hours, until Friday evening. 

 Forensic scientists are continuing to search his home in Jubilee Close in the village of Trimley St Martin near Felixstowe and the home of his mother, Ellen Kite, in the town of Eye, Suffolk.

 Despite the arrest of Stephens early yesterday, police close to the investigation told The Times that they were still looking at five other suspects and that they were no more than 50 per cent sure they had their man. Stephens is probably no more than midway on a scale of ten about four or five, said a detective.

 It emerged that Mr Stephens was 

 first interviewed by police after only one woman had disappeared.

 Unwelcome in Beirut, Rice soft-pedals

 Jerusalem, July 30 (Reuters): US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice called off a trip to Lebanon after Israel bombed a village there today, but she stopped short of urging an immediate ceasefire to help end the war.

 Lebanons Prime Minister Fouad Siniora said he did not want her to come to his country, saying that after the air strike, he could not hold any talks on resolving the crisis before an immediate ceasefire.

 Set to return to Washington tomorrow, Rices renewed push to end fighting between Israel and Hizbollah was derailed by todays bombing.

 In the wake of the tragedy that the people and the government of Lebanon are dealing with today, I have decided to postpone my discussions in Beirut. In any case, my work is here (in Israel) today, Rice told reporters of the cancelled Beirut trip.

 Rice insisted she had cancelled the Lebanon trip and not the other way around.

 With her options for shuttle diplomacy now limited, a US official said Rice would be back in Washington late tomorrow where she would focus on getting a UN resolution for a sustainable and durable ceasefire.

 She said she was deeply saddened by the Israeli bombing of the village of Qana in southern Lebanon, but did not call for an immediate ceasefire. 

 She said instead she would work very hard to try to end the hostilities. At least 542 people have been killed in Lebanon, although the health minister estimated the toll at 750, including unrecovered bodies. Fifty-one Israelis have also been killed. I think it is time to get to a ceasefire. We actually have to try and put one in place, Rice said.

 But Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, while voicing deep sorrow over the deaths, said Israel was not yet ready to stop its war against Hizbollah.

 Rice, who spoke to the European Unions Javier Solana, Britains Margaret Beckett and the UNs Kofi Annan about her plans, was set to have more talks with Olmert as well as his foreign minister Tzipi Livni later today.

 Rice was with Israels defence minister when she heard of the bombing, but did not show anger towards Israel for the attack. Nevertheless, officials insisted she would have strong words with Olmert.

 We are making clear to the Israelis our distress at this, said one official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

 Both Israel and the US have said a ceasefire would be meaningless unless Hizbollah could no longer carry out raids and rocket attacks and the Shia militia could be eventually disarmed as demanded by a UN resolution.

 Conscious of opinion in the region after the Qana bombing, Rices staff asked the television network travelling with her to quickly relay her comments to Arab networks.

 Washington has been accused of taking sides with Israel by not calling for an immediate ceasefire but Rice said she had pressed the Israelis hard on the need for extraordinary care to avoid civilian casualties.

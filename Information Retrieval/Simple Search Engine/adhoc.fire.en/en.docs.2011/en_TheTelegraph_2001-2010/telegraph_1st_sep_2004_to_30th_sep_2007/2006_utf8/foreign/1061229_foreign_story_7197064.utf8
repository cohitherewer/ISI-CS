 US: Food from cloned animals safe

 Washington, Dec. 28 (AP): The US government has decided that food from cloned animals is safe to eat and does not require special labelling.

 The Food and Drug Administration planned to brief industry groups in advance of an announcement. The regulatory agency indicated it would approve cloned livestock in a scientific journal article published online earlier this month.

 Consumer groups say labels are a must, because surveys have shown people to be uncomfortable with the idea of cloned livestock. 

 However, FDA regulators concluded that cloned animals are virtually indistinguishable from conventional livestock and that no identification is needed.

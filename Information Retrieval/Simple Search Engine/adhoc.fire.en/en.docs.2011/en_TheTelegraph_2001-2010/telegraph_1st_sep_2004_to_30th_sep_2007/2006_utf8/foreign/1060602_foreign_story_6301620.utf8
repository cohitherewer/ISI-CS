 Saudi women rise for veil

 Riyadh, June 1: More than 500 women packed the Saudi capitals Maimouna Center on a recent evening to attend a lecture.

 The women, some still in their full black wraps, filled the rows of plum-coloured plastic chairs, while late arrivals sat in small clusters on the carpet and against the wall. Whom do we love? asked the lecturer, a woman, seated behind a desk on a raised platform. God, the women answered in unison.

 Then we must obey Him.

 She went on to urge the audience members to dress modestly and raise their daughters to do the same. She explained that, despite what some Saudis are now saying, it is a sin for men and women to mix. Even if people dont see you sin, God is watching, she warned. 

 As she took copious notes, Mashael al-Eissa dabbed at tears, overcome by the extent of her religious responsibilities. Eissa, a fiery young Internet writer, and the lecturer, Afrah al-Humaydi, are among a group of conservative Saudi women trying to redress what they view as an erosion of traditional values in the kingdom and a dangerous shift in the status of women.

 Saudi women are the luckiest in the world and Saudi Arabia is the closest thing to an ideal and pure Islamic nation, Eissa said. We dont want imported western values to destroy that.

 The changes that have so riled Eissa and other conservative women followed the intense scrutiny that Saudi Arabia received after the discovery that 15 of the 19 hijackers who carried out the September 11, 2001, attacks in the US were Saudis. 

 The new atmosphere has alarmed conservative women who are suspicious of US interference. Though no figures are available, conservative, religious women seem to constitute a sizeable portion of the countrys female population, belying notions that most Saudi women are unhappy with their lot and waiting to be liberated.

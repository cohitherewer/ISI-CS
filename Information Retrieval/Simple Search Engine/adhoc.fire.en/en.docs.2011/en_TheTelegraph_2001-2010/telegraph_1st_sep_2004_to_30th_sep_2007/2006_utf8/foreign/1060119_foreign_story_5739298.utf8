 Katrina punishment for Iraq

 New York, Jan. 18: The mayor of New Orleans has provoked new outrage by calling Hurricane Katrina Gods punishment for invading Iraq and insisting the city become chocolate again.

 Mayor Ray Nagin, notorious for his outspoken, off-the-cuff rhetoric, also suggested that God was especially angry with black America for its treatment of its women and children.

 Surely, God is mad at America, Nagin, himself black, said at a ceremony to mark Martin Luther King Day. He sent us hurricane after hurricane after hurricane and its destroyed and put stress on this country. Surely, hes not approving of us being in Iraq under false pretences. But surely, hes upset at black America also. Were not taking care of ourselves, were not taking care of our women, and were not taking care of our children.

 It was the mayors thoughts on the future racial make-up of the city that prompted the most disquiet. 

 Its time for us to rebuild a New Orleans, the one that should be a chocolate New Orleans, Nagin said. This city will be a majority African-American city. Its the way God wants it to be.

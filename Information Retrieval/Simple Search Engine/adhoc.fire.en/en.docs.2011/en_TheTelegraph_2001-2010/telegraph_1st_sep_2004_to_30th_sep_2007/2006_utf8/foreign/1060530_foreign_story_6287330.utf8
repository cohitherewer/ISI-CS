Film premiere now an ailing beast

 JAMES VERINI 

 Aniston: Time to break-up

 Los Angeles, May 29: Note to Hollywood studio publicity departments: The movie premiere party is an ailing beast. Please do something. 

 The premiere party used to hold great sway in Los Angeles nightlife. In a town whose occupation is looking good, it was a hallowed kind of faux-civic event ? celebrities showing up to watch themselves on-screen and then retiring to a party to discuss themselves. 

 Things have changed. With box office receipts often interesting the public more than the movies generating them (or not). So many stars and filmmakers feel their premieres are obligatory now, said one prominent Hollywood event planner who has put together many premiere parties. Theyre not excited about it. Often there are multiple events for a single movie. There are so many of them, theyre not special anymore. 

 The most anticipated Hollywood premiere of the summer, The Da Vinci Code, took place not in LA but in Cannes. Ditto for X-Men: The Last Stand. M:i:III premiered in New York. The premieres that still take place here have been boiled down to their essentials: a chance to eat shrimp and drink free vodka near, say, Vince Vaughn, and the opportunity to provide yet another manicured moment for the tabloid media. 

 Not that either of these goals is inconsiderable. The media is an invaluable ? invaluable! ? institution, and anyone who tells you getting tight near Vince Vaughn wouldnt top their list of fun evenings is simply lying. But despite soaring marketing budgets, there is an uninspired, by-the-numbers feel to most premiere parties these days. 

 Take the Jarhead premiere last autumn at the Palladium in Los Angeles. Big money, big stars, great preview. The premiere party should have been a romp. Bullet casings littering the floor, bartenders in gas masks, moonshine served in canteens ? this would have been the way to go, right? Instead we got some weird lighting and pita bread.

 Monday night brought the premiere of The Break-Up and the chance to eat shrimp with Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston. 

 The Break-Up has its own built-in marketing mechanism in Vaughn and Anistons relationship, such as it exists. But amid the sordid, Burton-Taylorish details of Brangelina and Tomkat, Anistaughn has a quaint, Spencer Tracy-Audrey Hepburn quality to it. 

 That may be nice for the couple, but where premiere parties are concerned, the more sordid the accompanying tabloid story the better. 

 Disappointingly, this was an equivalently quaint affair. The only tumult belonged to the requisite teenagers and autograph hounds lined up outside the Mann Village Theatre,. 

 Inside, the movie started 20 minutes late (as punctual as it gets at a premiere) and the crowd of several hundred studio functionaries, clapped and laughed dutifully from the opening credits to the last scene. 

 The best thing to be said for The Break-Up party was that it was egalitarian, with the known and the obscure alike smushed up against one another, competing for air and food.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Key Nepal talks resume

 Kathmandu, Nov. 7 (Reuters): Last-minute talks between Nepals government and Maoist rebels began today to clinch a deal to end a conflict in which thousands have died in the Himalayan nation, negotiators said.

 Both sides said they were very close to an agreement on the main issues of disarming the rebels and the future of the monarchy but a pact expected to be announced on Monday was delayed because of wrangling over a temporary legislature.

 The agreement was as good as final but members of the ruling seven-party alliance were bargaining among themselves for more seats in the proposed interim parliament, said Krishna Bahadur Mahara, a rebel spokesman and a senior negotiator.

 There has to be an agreement today. We cant leave it like this.

 Berlusconi latest barb: Left boiled babies 

 Naples, March 26 (Reuters): Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, fighting for re-election against a centre-Left coalition which includes the hard Left, said today that communists had a history of boiling babies.

 I have been accused many times of saying communists eat babies, he told a rally of his Forza Italia (Go Italy!) party. 

 Go and read the black book on commu- nism and youll find that under Maos China they di-dnt eat babies but they boiled them to fertilise the fields.

 They say we look to the past too much, but they forget that in the opposition there are three parties who proudly call themselves communists.

 Berlusconi has often been accused of being obsessed with the communist threat in Italy, a country where during the Cold War, the communist party was bigger than anywhere else in western Europe.

 In the run-up to winning the 2001 election, Berlusconi said: I can organise a conference in which I will prove communists have really eaten babies and done even worse things.

 With the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the Soviet Union, most of the Italian Communist Party transformed itself into the Democrats of the Left, now Italys main opposition party.

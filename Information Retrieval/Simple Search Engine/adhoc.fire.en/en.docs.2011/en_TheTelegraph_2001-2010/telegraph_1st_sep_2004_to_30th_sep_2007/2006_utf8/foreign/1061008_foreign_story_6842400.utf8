 Girls against coed plan

 Richmond (Virginia), Oct. 7 (AP): A group of students at Randolph-Macon Womans College sued the school, challenging its decision to begin admitting men next autumn.

 The lawsuit claims the 115-year-old schools governing board breached its contract with the students by voting to make it co-educational.

 The lawsuit seeks to delay the enrollment of men until at least 2010, when currently enrolled students should have graduated. 

 Theyre in shellshock, alumna Diane Montgomery said of the colleges approximately 700 students. They feel their voices are not being heard. No one told them this college was going to go coed.

 Montgomery is secretary of the Board of Preserve Educational Choice Inc, an alumnae group formed to fight the board of trustees decision on September 9 to adopt co-education. 

 Im saddened that were in litigation with our own students but recognise they have the right to do that, Ginger Worden, the colleges interim president, said. 

 She said the board of trustees is the proper body to make decisions about the colleges future, and added that delaying coeducation until 2010 is impractical.

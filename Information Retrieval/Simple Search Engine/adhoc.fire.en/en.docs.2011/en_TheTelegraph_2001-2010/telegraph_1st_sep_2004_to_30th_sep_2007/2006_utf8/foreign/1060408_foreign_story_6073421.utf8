 Bombers hit Shia mosque

 Baghdad, April 7 (Reuters): Three suicide bombers dressed as women killed at least 55 people at a Shia mosque today in Baghdad, police said, putting more pressure on Iraqs divided leaders to form a government and face up to sectarian violence.

 The bombers were dressed in traditional Shia womens black robes when they struck, two inside the mosque and one just outside, police said. 

 The bombing was the biggest single suicide attack on a Shia target since November 2005. 

 Men screamed as bodies were rolled on wooden carts to ambulances at the complex, which belongs to SCIRI, the most powerful group inside Iraqs ruling Shia Alliance.

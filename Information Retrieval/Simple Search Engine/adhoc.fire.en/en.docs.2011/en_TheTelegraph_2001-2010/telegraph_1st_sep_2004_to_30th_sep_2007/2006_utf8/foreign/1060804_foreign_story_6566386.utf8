 Paris wants to know: whos Tony Blair?

 London, Aug. 3: Celebrity rich girl Paris Hilton has demonstrated her grasp of world affairs by asking: Whos Tony Blair?

 Asked by GQ magazine if she fancied Tony Blair, a confused Hilton replied: Who?

 After giving it some thought she said: Oh yeah... hes like your president? Then she admitted: I dont know what he looks like. Hilton also compared herself to Diana, Princess of Wales. I loved her. She was amazing. Her death affected me so much, such a strong and beautiful woman. I just cried for two hours non-stop when I heard she had been killed.

 Ive been in cars trying to get away from speeding paparazzi before and its horrible, so I can relate to Diana and the problems she had, she explained. Asked who she would most like to be compared to, she replied: Marilyn Monroe mixed with Diana.

 Elsewhere in the interview, the 25-year-old socialite revealed how much money she rakes in. Her empire includes perfume and cosmetics lines, shoes and hotels, and she is paid millions to make personal appearances.

 Ive made, like, $200 million in the last year, while JLos only made $150 million, she explained. Hilton became infamous when a videotape of her having sex with her then boyfriend was posted on the Internet. 

 But she declared: Ive only done it with, like, a couple of boyfriends. People think I sleep with everyone, but Im not like that. I like kissing, but thats all I do. Im not having sex for a year.

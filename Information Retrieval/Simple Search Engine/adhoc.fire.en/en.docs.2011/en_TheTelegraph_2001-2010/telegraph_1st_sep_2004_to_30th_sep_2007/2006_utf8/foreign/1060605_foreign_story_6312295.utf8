The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Have fun in Hell this 666 Tuesday

 Hell, Michigan, June 4 (AP): They are planning a hot time in Hell on Tuesday.

 The day bears the date of 6-6-06, or abbreviated as 666 ? a number that, according to the Bibles Book of Revelation, signifies the devil.

 And there is not a snowballs chance in hell that the day will go unnoticed in the unincorporated hamlet 100 km west of Detroit.

 Nobody is more fired up than John Colone, the towns self-styled mayor and owner of a souvenir shop.

 Ive got 666 T-shirts and mugs. Im only ordering 666 (of the items) so once theyre gone, thats it, said Colone, also known as Odum Plenty. Everyone who comes will get a letter of authenticity saying youve celebrated June 6, 2006, in Hell.

 Most of Colones wares will sell for $6.66, including deeds to one square inch of Hell.

 Live entertainment and a costume contest are planned. The gates of Hell should be installed at a childrens play area in time for the festivities.

 Theyre 8 feet tall and 5 foot wide and each gate looks like flames, and when theyre closed, its a devils head, Colone told The Detroit News yesterday.

 Mike Smitty Hickey, owner of the Dam Site inn, was not sure what kind of clientele would show up on Tuesday.

 Were all about having fun here. I dont think were going to get the cult crowd, the devil worshippers or anything like that, said Hickey, whose bars signature concoction is the Bloody Devil, a variant of the Bloody Mary.

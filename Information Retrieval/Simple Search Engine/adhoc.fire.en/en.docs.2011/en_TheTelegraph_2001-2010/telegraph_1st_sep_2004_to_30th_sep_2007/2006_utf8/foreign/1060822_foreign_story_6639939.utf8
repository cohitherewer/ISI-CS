 Wifes sweet revenge

 KATE CONNOLLY

Berlin, Aug. 21: Some wives cut up their husbands 

suits in revenge for infidelity. Others give away their wine collections. But 

the wife of the new Czech Prime Minister has found a different way of hitting 

her husband where it hurts running for a rival political party.

 Mirek Topolanek, who became Prime Minister of the Czech Republic on Wednesday, described his wife Pavlas move as a sweet revenge after admitting on Friday that, as his wife had long claimed, he was having an affair with the deputy leader of parliament. Topolanek, 50, head of the conservative Civic Democrats (ODS), said his wife told him last week that she had joined the Right-wing party Politika 21. I was surprised but not cross, he said. She plans to run for the Senate in Ostrava, Topolaneks home city.

 ODS apparatchiks are furious. A situation where the wife of a political partys chairman runs for another political party is extremely unusual, said Lukas Zenaty, the ODS leader in Ostrava. According to leading ODS members, Topolanek had told party leaders that her husband was having an affair with a senior party member.

 She claims their failure to respond to her request for a political post led her to join Politika 21, which campaigns under the slogan: No to political arrogance, corruption and wasting money.

 Pavla Topolanek, 51, who met her husband at university and later worked as his assistant, said in a statement: As I havent received a candidacy offer from my husbands party, the ODS, Ive decided to run for Politika 21, whose programme entirely corresponds to my Right-wing positions. Moreover, Ill run in my constituency of Ostrava city, where Ive always felt at home. I hope my decision will break the traditional clich where a politicians wife is not expected to join active political life.

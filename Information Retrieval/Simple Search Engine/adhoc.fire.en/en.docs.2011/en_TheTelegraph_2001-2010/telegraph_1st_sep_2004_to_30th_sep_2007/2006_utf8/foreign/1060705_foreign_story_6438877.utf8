 Kylie trauma

 HUGH DAVIES

 London, July 4: With a pixie-styled cropped haircut and a rueful smile, Kylie Minogue, the Australian singer, has spoken for the first time about the shock of being told she had breast cancer.

 She said: The moment my doctor told me, I went silent. My mum and dad were with me. Then we all fell to pieces.

 The singers immediate thought, she said, was to fly away. I was saying: No dad, Im getting on a plane. He said: No, youre not getting on a plane. Youll sit down.

 The former Neighbours actress was interviewed by Cat Deeley for Sky television. The interview will be broadcast on July 16 along with extracts from a video diary, which Minogue kept of her year-long treatment. 

 Minogue, 38, in an excerpt from the interview, looked the confident and perky star of old, a far cry from the frightened, shuffling figure seen entering the apartment of her fianc?, Olivier Martinez, the French actor, during chemotherapy. In another interview with an Australian newspaper, she spoke of the long, hard road to conquering her illness.

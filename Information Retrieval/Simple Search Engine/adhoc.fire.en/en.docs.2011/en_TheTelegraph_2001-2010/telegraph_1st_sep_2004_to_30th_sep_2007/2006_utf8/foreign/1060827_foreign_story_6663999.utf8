 Ramses rolls out of Cairo

 London, Aug. 26: A huge statue of Ramses II, one of the greatest pharaohs, rolled through the streets of Cairo to a new home near the pyramids yesterday to escape the pollution of its former home in the centre of the city. 

 Tens of thousands of people lined the streets to bid farewell to the 3,200-year-old red granite statue, which is 36 feett high and weighs 83 tons. It was wrapped in plastic and thick padding for the painstakingly slow 21-mile journey on a purpose-built vehicle to the site of a new museum.

 We are going to miss you. Cairo will never be the same again, shouted Ahmed Sami, 23, as the statue started its journey during the night.

 Cairo residents waved from their windows and balconies. Some were in tears. Others climbed buses, cars and mosques to get a view of the statue as it travelled to its new home near the ancient pyramids in Giza, a few miles outside Cairo.

 Ramses II was a powerful imperial ruler and prolific temple builder who ruled Egypt from about 1304 to 1237 BC. He is traditionally believed to be the pharaoh mentioned in the biblical story of Moses.

 Egypts Supreme Council of Antiquities took the decision to move the statue following a decade of discussions after it had deteriorated due to pollution. Im quite sure that if you look at the statue now, you will see it is smiling, Zahi Hawass, head of the council, said after the statue reached the new site.

 Engineers constructed a cage around the statue as two flatbed trucks carried it upright during the journey that took it across the Nile river.

 The statue will be renovated and wait for its new home to be built. The museum, which also will house King Tuts mummy and other treasures, is not expected to open for at least five years, officials have said.

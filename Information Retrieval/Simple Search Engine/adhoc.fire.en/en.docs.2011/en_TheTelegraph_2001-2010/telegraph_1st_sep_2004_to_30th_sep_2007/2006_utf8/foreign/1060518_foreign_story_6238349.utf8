 China typhoon

 Hong Kong, May 17 (Reuters): China evacuated more than 600,000 people as the strongest typhoon on record to enter the South China Sea in May bore down on the south coast today, causing flight and shipping delays around the region.

 Typhoon Chanchu, packing winds up to 170 kmph , was forecast to make landfall northeast of Hong Kong in Guangdong province later tomorrow after killing 37 people as it swept across the Philippines last weekend.

 Chinese state television news said some 320,000 people were evacuated from their homes along the coast of Guangdong province, while over 300,000 were moved in Fujian province. All ships were called back to port schools suspended classes.

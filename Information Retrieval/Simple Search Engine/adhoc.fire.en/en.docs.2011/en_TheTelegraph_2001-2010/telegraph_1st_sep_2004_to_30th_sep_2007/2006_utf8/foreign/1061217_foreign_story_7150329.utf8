 Florida bar on executions

 Ocala (Florida), Dec. 16 (AP): Governor Jeb Bush suspended all executions in Florida after a medical examiner said that prison officials botched the insertion of the needles when a convicted killer was put to death earlier this week.

 Separately, a federal judge in California yesterday extended a moratorium on executions in the USs most populous state, declaring that the states method of lethal injection violates the constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment.

 US district judge Jeremy Fogel ruled in San Jose that Californias implementation of lethal injection is broken, but it can be fixed. The decisions are the latest in a nationwide challenge to lethal injection the preferred method of execution in 37 US states as cruel and unusual punishment. Last month, a federal judge declared Missouris injection method, which is similar to Californias, unconstitutional.

 In Florida, medical examiner Dr William Hamilton said Wednesdays execution of Angel Nieves Diaz took 34 minutes twice as long as usual and required a rare second dose of lethal chemicals because the needles were inserted clear through his veins and into the flesh in his arms. The chemicals are supposed to go into the veins.

 Hamilton, who performed the autopsy, refused to say whether he thought Diaz died a painful death. I am going to defer answers about pain and suffering until the autopsy is complete, he said. He said the results were preliminary and other tests may take several weeks. The US supreme court has upheld executions by hanging, firing squad, electric chair and gas chamber despite the pain they might cause, but has left unsettled the issue of whether the pain is unconstitutionally excessive.

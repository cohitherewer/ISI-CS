Bracciano 

 (Italy), Nov. 18 (Reuters): Actors Tom Cruise and 

 Katie Holmes arrived separately at a medieval castle near 

 Rome for their star-studded wedding today, braving hordes 

 of paparazzi and rainy skies.

 Celebrity guests also began trickling into the lakeside venue of Bracciano, a normally sleepy town 40 km north of the Italian capital that is now swarming with thousands of journalists and onlookers. 

 Cruise, wearing sunglasses, waved to the crowd as he arrived in a black Mercedes minivan. Holmes earlier arrived clutching their baby daughter Suri in her arms, local media reported.

 Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli, expected to sing Ava Maria during the celebrations, and Roberta Armani, niece of designer Giorgio Armani, were among the first of the guests to arrive, local media reported. 

 Several minivans with tinted windows drove up at a side entrance at the frescoed castle.

 The few cars that have arrived, we couldnt see who was inside but Im happy anyway, said Paola Iela, a 34-year-old student. Normally, Bracciano is a dead town, but Im enjoying the media frenzy. Ive had a crush on Tom Cruise since I was a teenager. I think hes too sexy. 

 Details of the ceremony have been kept mostly secret, but it is expected to be in the early evening with some 150 celebrities in attendance.

 Fans started gathering in the main square facing the Odescalchi castle early in the day, though a downpour deterred some in the afternoon. Residents looked out from their balconies, some of them decorated with the American flag.

 Photographers with long lenses stood perilously on window ledges at the top of a building overlooking the castle, where the mayor is charging 1,000 euros ($1,278) for each position. But much of the action will be hidden from public view inside the fortress, surrounded by a 10-metre high wall.

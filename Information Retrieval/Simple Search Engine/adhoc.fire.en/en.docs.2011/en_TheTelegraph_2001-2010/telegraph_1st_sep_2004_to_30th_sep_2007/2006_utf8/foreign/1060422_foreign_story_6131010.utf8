 Hu day of indignities

 DANA MILBANK

 Washington, April 21: Chinese President Hu Jintao got almost everything he wanted out of yesterdays visit to the White House.

 He got the 21-gun salute and the review of the troops. He got the exchange of toasts and a meal of wild-caught Alaskan halibut with mushroom essence, $50 chardonnay and live music. And he got an Oval Office photo opportunity with President Bush, who nodded and smiled as if he understood Chinese while Hu spoke.

 If only the White House hadnt given press credentials to a Falun Gong activist who five years ago heckled Hus predecessor, Jiang Zemin, in Malta. Sure enough, 90 seconds into Hus speech on the South Lawn, the woman started shrieking: President Hu, your days are numbered! and President Bush, stop him from killing!

 Bush and Hu looked up, stunned. It took so long to silence her ? a full three minutes ? that Bush aides began to wonder if the Secret Services strategy was to let her scream herself hoarse. The rattled Chinese President haltingly attempted to continue his speech and television coverage went to split screen.

 Youre okay, Bush gently reassured Hu.

 But he wasnt okay, not really. The protocol-obsessed Chinese leader suffered a day full of indignities ? some intentional, others just careless. The visit began with a slight when the official announcer said the band would play the national anthem of the Republic of China ? the official name of Taiwan. It continued when vice-president Dick Cheney donned sunglasses for the ceremony, and again when Hu, attempting to leave the stage via the wrong staircase, was yanked back by his jacket. Hu looked down at his sleeve to see the President of the US tugging at it as if redirecting an errant child.

 Then there were the intentional 

 slights. China wanted a formal state visit such as Jiang 

 got, but the administration refused, calling it instead 

 an official visit. Bush acquiesced to the 21-gun 

 salute but insisted on a luncheon instead of a formal dinner.

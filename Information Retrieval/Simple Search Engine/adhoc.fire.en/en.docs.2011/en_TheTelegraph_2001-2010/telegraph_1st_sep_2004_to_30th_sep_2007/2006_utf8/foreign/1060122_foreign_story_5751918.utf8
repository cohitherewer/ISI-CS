 Iran leader the new Arab poster boy

 PATRICK BISHOP

 Ahmadinejad

 Damascus, Jan. 21: The Arab street has a new poster boy. Whatever Europe and America may think of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the Iranian Presidents anti-western rhetoric is winning him heroic status among West Asias masses.

 Strong men loom large in the recent history of the region. The prototype was Gamal Abdel Nasser, the Egyptian who inspired a generation of Arab nationalists. 

 Then there was Saddam Hussein, whose defiance of America won admirers even among Arabs who detested his tyranny. The position of West Asuia strongman is currently vacant. Ahmadinejad may be a Persian, but that does not appear to disqualify him from the job.

 Its good to have someone strong who can stand up to outsiders, said Rovan, a 19-year-old law student, in a coffee shop next to the Omayyad Mosque where the Iranian President had worshipped earlier in the day.

 What matters to me is that he is against Israel and America. As for nuclear weapons, Iran should have them. Israel has got them and is always threatening us. Why shouldnt we have the same right?

 According to Sami Moubaid, a Syrian political analyst, Ahmadinejad appeals because the Arabs are sentimental people and they enjoy the colourful and provocative statements that he has been making. 

 His statements are meaningless. What does it mean when he says the Holocaust never happened or that Israel should be wiped from the map? Its cheap talk but people like cheap talk. Its part of a tradition of macho political posturing.

 Ahmadinejad, who says Nasser and Ayatollah Khomeini are his greatest inspirations, styles himself as a simple man. 

 He wears cheap, light-coloured suits and, indeed, was mayor of Tehran before his election last August.

 His website is smugly titled The Peoples Friend. He is best known for the provocative statement that the Holocaust was a myth. But many in West Asia would agree with his assertion that.

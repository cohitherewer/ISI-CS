 No mercy for Briton facing death

 Rawalpindi, May 26 (Reuters): The brother of a Pakistani taxi driver killed 18 years ago said today that taking blood money to pardon a British man facing the gallows would be an insult to his family that he could not accept.

 We will starve to death but we will never sell the blood of our brother, Maseet Khan, the elder brother of murdered cab driver Jamshaid Khan, said.

 Earlier this week President Pervez Musharraf delayed the hanging of Mirza Tahir Hussain, a British national of Pakistani descent, for a month so that his family could make a last ditch attempt to reach a settlement with relatives of the dead man. 

 Hussain was to have been executed in early June.

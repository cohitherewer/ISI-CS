 Bachelor prince is papa again

 Prince Albert II: Secret no more

 Paris, June 1 (AFP): Prince Albert of Monaco has admitted fathering a second child born out of wedlock, the 14-year-old daughter of a Californian former waitress, his lawyer said in an interview published today.

 At first he decided to keep his paternity secret until Jazmin Grace reached adulthood. But during the past several weeks the paparazzi began to swarm around her in Palm Springs and the situation became untenable for her, Thierry Lacoste told the French daily Le Figaro.

 The prince officially acknowledges paternity, which was legally established several weeks ago, he added.

 Jazmins mother Tamara Rotolo became pregnant after a brief liaison with Albert during a holiday in 1991, according to Le Figaro journalists Lena Lutaud and Thibault Dromard, authors of The Underside of the People Press.

 Described as a mature, pleasant and intelligent young girl, Jazmin Grace was born in March 1992 in Palm Springs, California, they wrote.

 In 1992 Rotolo filed a paternity suit in a California court citing Albert as the father, but the court ruled that it had no jurisdiction in the affair.

 Albert, who is 48 and unmarried, has been linked with a succession of girlfriends, but, like his sisters Caroline and Stephanie, has regularly resorted to the French law courts to protect his privacy.

 US: Qaida renewing operations

 Osama: Resilient

 Washington, Nov. 16 (Reuters): Al Qaida is reinvigorating its operations from havens on the Afghan-Pakistani border and poses a growing challenge to US interests in both Iraq and Afghanistan, American intelligence officials said yesterday.

 Five years after the September 11 attacks and the fall of Taliban rule in Afghanistan, the network led by Osama bin Laden has replaced leaders killed or captured by the US and its allies with new seasoned militants.

 It has shown resilience, CIA director Michael Hayden told the Senate Armed Services Committee. The loss of a series of al Qaida leaders since 9/11 has been substantial.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Japan heaps attention on next First Lady 

 Akie Abe

 Tokyo, Sept. 24 (Reuters): She enjoys an occasional drink, was once a local radio DJ, and is such a fan of South Korean movie stars that she has begun studying Korean.

 Her name is Akie Abe, and on Tuesday she will become Japans first First Lady in over five years, when her husband Shinzo takes over from Junichiro Koizumi, a divorced bachelor.

 Akie, 44, is getting an unusual amount of attention from the media in Japan, where the wives of most Prime Ministers have usually kept very low profiles. 

 Abe is young and seen as good-looking, so more attention is being paid to his wife too, said social commentator Tomoko Inukai.

 Plus shes from a younger generation. The older wives just stuck to their husbands and stayed in their shadow, but shes the kind of person who steps forward a bit more.

 Akie is the daughter of the president of a candy maker and was an employee of a top ad agency before marriage. 

 Akie was lukewarm when an acquaintance 

 offered to introduce her to Abe and showed up late for the 

 meeting, so the story goes. Abe wooed her with flowers and 

 they married in 1987. I consult with her about many 

 things, Abe has said. Shes the person 

 who understands me the best.

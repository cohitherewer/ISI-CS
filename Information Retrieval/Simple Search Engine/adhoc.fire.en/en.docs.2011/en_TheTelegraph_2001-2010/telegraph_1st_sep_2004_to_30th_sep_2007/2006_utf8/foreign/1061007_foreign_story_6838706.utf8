 Heart of Dunst

 New York, Oct. 6 (AP): When it premiered at the Cannes Film Festival earlier this year, Marie Antoinette drew boos from French critics. Kirsten Dunst, who plays Antoinette in the movie, has a laid-back attitude about it.

 I didnt take it to heart, Dunst says in an interview in the latest issue of Entertainment Weekly. How would we feel about the French doing a movie about George Washington with French actors?

 The 24-year-old Dunst, whose screen credits include The Virgin Suicides and the Spider-Man movies, says making Marie Antoinette was a solitary experience for her.

 Sometimes I felt really isolated because it was such a lonely part to play, she says. 

 Late Lopez

Lopez, saying the singer and actress is late on payments for a pair of chartered 

flights. Avjet Corp of Burbank, California, filed the suit on Wednesday in a Los 

Angeles court. It claims Lopez has yet to pay for two flights on Gulfstream jets 

from Farmingdale, New York, to Puerto Rico and another to Burbank.

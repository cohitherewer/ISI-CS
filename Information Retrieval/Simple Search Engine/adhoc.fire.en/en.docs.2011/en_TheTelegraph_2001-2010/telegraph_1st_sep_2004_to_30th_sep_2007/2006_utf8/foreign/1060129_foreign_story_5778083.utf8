 Canadian pranksters fool Chirac

 Paris, Jan. 28 (Reuters): French President Jacques Chirac took a call from Canadas newly elected leader only to find he had been fooled by a pair of radio pranksters known as the Masked Avengers in Canadas French-speaking city of Montreal.

 Chiracs office confirmed that the French leader had taken a courtesy call on Thursday purportedly from Canadas new conservative Prime Minister-elect Stephen Harper.

 But after swapping diplomatic niceties during a lengthy chat, Marc-Antoine Audette of CKOI radio ? Canadas most popular station ? let the 73-year-old Chirac in on the joke.

 We chose Chirac because he is pretty famous, he is the President of France, and for us it was the chance to talk to a head of state, Audette, 25, said from Montreal. Chirac did not react once to Audettes thick French-Canadian accent as the two men discussed relations.

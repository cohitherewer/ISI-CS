 Smokers, watch your wrinkles

 London, June 14 (Reuters): Smokers heavily wrinkled faces could be an early warning sign of a serious lung disease, researchers said today.

 They found that smokers with pronounced wrinkles are five times more likely than those without marked facial lines to suffer from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes bronchitis and emphysema.

 COPD, a leading cause of death worldwide, is caused by smoking, which also prematurely ages the skin. So researchers at the Royal Devon amp; Exeter NHS Foundation in southwest England studied whether there was a link between the two. This data suggests that if you are a smoker and you are wrinkled you are more likely to have lung disease, said Dr Bipen Patel. 

 We found that cigarette smokers who had a large amount of facial wrinkling were five times more likely to have COPD than smokers who were less wrinkled.

 COPD begins with a persistent cough and increased mucous. It eventually leads to fatigue, shortness of breath and difficulty breathing as the lungs are destroyed.

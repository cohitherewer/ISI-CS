 Dhaka, Nov. 19 

 (Reuters): Bangladeshis were fleeing the capital ahead of 

 a countrywide transport blockade tomorrow, fearing a repeat 

 of violence during a similar action last week aimed at forcing 

 out officials overseeing January elections.

 Schools tried to finish annual tests, banks worked extra hours, and many people bought tickets out of Dhaka, witnesses said. Even weddings were being rushed.

 The country is up for another crippling shutdown of buses, trains and ferries and also for violence that could be widespread, a senior police officer said today. Two people were killed and hundreds injured in clashes with police and between rival activists during the previous stoppage.

 The blockades are being organised by a 14-party alliance led by Sheikh Hasina, chief of the Awami League, who accuses the election officials of favouring her rivals.

 Straw refuses to relent over veil

 London, Oct. 14: Anyone expecting Jack Straw to be cowed on his first return to Blackburn since the row over veils embroiled him a week earlier would have been disappointed yesterday.

 He began the day by engaging in the sort of shuttle diplomacy that was his stock in trade until he left the foreign office to become leader of the Commons. Except that for New York, Baghdad and Teheran read the Asian-dominated suburbs of Brookhouse and Little Harwood.

 Later, in the town hall, he held court, making clear that he took back not a single word of his remarks and going on to develop his theme that the Muslim veil was a symbol of separation in Britains ever-dividing racial mix.

 He left to applause from shoppers in the main square and only peremptory barracking from anti-war protesters.

 Straw insisted that he raised the issue of Muslim women covering their faces purely out of respect for Islam and affection for the Muslim community.

 He went on: The huge interest in what I said shows there is real anxiety about the retreat into parallel communities in some areas.

 I have been very concerned about that for a long time. I am afraid the statistical evidence in areas like Blackburn shows there is a greater degree of separation between communities than there was and I dont believe thats healthy.

 You cant legislate for it. The only way you are going to change it is by open discussion. Its unhealthy, full stop. But its particularly unhealthy for the group that happens to be a minority.

 Straw compared the situation in his constituency with that between local Protestants and Catholics half a century ago. The barriers only started being broken down when members of the communities decided they wanted to find out about the people who were apparently different but turned out to be very similar.

 Its not an issue at all now but it was 50 years ago in town. It was a big issue.

 Asked whether the integration of Asian communities was simply a matter of time, Straw replied: It should be, but if you see separate developments taking place which are moving things the other way then you have to say no, its not. There are sufficient worrying signs for us all to be concerned and thats what comes out of this debate.

 Straw was attacked by some Muslims for suggesting that community relations could be helped if women did not wear full veils. They were angered that he asks women visitors to his constituency office to remove their veils so that he can see them fully face-to-face.

 Straw said that wearing the full veil was bound to make better, positive relations between communities more difficult since it could be seen as a visible statement of separation and difference. Later, Straw faced a number of veiled women. Asma Patel, 20, said: He should apologise to those he has hurt. I wear the veil whenever I am out, and I have every right to do so. It is my modesty. It is my religion.

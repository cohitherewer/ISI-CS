 Meet the stunning, new Bond girl

 Caterina Murino: 

 Royale touch 

 London, jan. 17: A little-known 

 Italian actress and former beauty contestant, is to have 

 a major role in the next James Bond film, Casino Royale.

 Caterina Murino, whose previous roles have been confined to obscure European films, will play alongside Daniel Craig, the latest incarnation of the British secret agent. But she has missed out on the female lead, Vesper Lynd, played in the 1967 spoof film version of the book by Ursula Andress.

 Murino, 28, who came fourth in the 1996 Miss Italy competition, was secretly auditioned in Rome by 007 producer Barbara Broccoli, who was said to be delighted with her.

 A film insider said: Caterina has got dark, beautiful Latin looks and is stunning.

 She really impressed at the casting and Barbara was delighted with her. She will be a great Bond girl.

 Although born in Cagliari on the Italian island of Sardinia, Murino lives in Paris to further her career.

 Casino Royale will be her big break in films as until now she has only had small roles in minor Italian and French films. Murino is the first Bond girl cast for the film, which begins shooting at the end of the month. A number of big name stars, including Angelina Jolie, Charlize Theron and Naomi Watts, are said to have turned down roles in the film.

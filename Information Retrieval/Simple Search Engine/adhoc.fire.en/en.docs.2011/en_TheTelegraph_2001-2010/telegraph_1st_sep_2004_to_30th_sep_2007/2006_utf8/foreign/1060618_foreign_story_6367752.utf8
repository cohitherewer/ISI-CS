 Beyonce shocked

 New York, June 17 (AP): Beyonce Knowles had several surprise guests at a recent dinner, where members of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals peppered the pop star with questions about her fur use.

 eBay auction offered fans a chance to dine with Knowles, and PETA secretly placed the winning bid. At the dinner on Wednesday at the chic Nobu 57 restaurant, members of the animal rights group confronted Knowles about wearing fur coats and using fur in her clothing line, House of Dereon.

 A video of the encounter, posted on http://www.tmz.com, shows a stunned Knowles, unresponsive to the allegations and appealing to others in her group to react. 

 Spears

acknowledged on Saturday that he may have been duped into believing that Britney 

Spears was considering a Namibian birth for her next baby. Not true, 

Spears New York-based publicist, Leslie Sloane Zelnik, said on Friday. Earlier, 

Namibian deputy environment and tourism minister Leon Jooste said officials had 

received an inquiry on behalf of the 24-year-old pop star.

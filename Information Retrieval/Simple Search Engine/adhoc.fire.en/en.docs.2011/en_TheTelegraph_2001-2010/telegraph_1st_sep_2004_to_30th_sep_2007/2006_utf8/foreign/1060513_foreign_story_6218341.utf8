 200 dead in Nigeria blast

 Inagbe Beach (Nigeria), May 12 (Reuters): A pipeline explosion killed up to 200 people on the outskirts of Lagos today, leaving charred corpses on a sandy beach where locals tapping the pipe to steal fuel ignited the blast.

 The Red Cross said the pipeline blew up in the morning while thieves were siphoning fuel into jerry cans for sale on the black market. The massive explosion cooked everything within a 20 metre radius.

 Only grey calcinated skulls and bones were left of five people who were closest to the pipeline, which had been dug out of the sand and bore marks of drilling in several places.

 About 100 blackened, unrecognisable corpses were strewn on the waters edge a few metres away, where the golden sand was still steaming hot this afternoon. 

 Some bodies, charred and bloated, floated in the waters of the creek, which is only about a mile from Lagos city centre by boat. 

 You can see the corpses. Some are burnt to ash. Others are remnants... We estimate 150 to 200 people died, Lagos police commissioner Emmanuel Adebayo said.

 Theft of petrol and crude oil from pipelines is common in Nigeria, an oil producing country where the vast majority of people live in poverty.

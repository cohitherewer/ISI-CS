 Saran: People to decide

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 22: A day after it was seen to be supporting an unpopular King Gyanendra, New Delhi today clarified that it stands firmly behind the people of Nepal in their quest for democracy. 

 Speaking at a news conference in New Delhi late this evening, foreign secretary Shyam Saran tried to clear the air on the Indian position on the kings offer to the political parties.

 Indias quick approval of the kings reconciliatory speech had evoked sharp reactions in Kathmandu, particularly when the mood in Nepal was against the kings offer. Saran said India had asked the king to recognise the groundswell of popular sentiment in Nepal.

 Saran said Indias support for the twin-pillar theory ? where constitutional monarchy and multi-party democracy co-exist ? reflected the mood of the people. It was for the people of Nepal to decide what course they want to take tomorrow, he said.

 In the wake of the rapidly changing situation in Nepal. Saran said it would not decide what kind of political arrangement is required in Kathmandu and would respect the will of the people. 

 He also said that New Delhi was not averse to the Maoists joining the political mainstream after shunning violence and working in a multi-party democracy.

 The foreign secretary said the Indian position was distorted by the anti-India elements in Nepal. These sentiments have been baseless, he added without identifying the hostile forces. 

Speaking to newspersons on board a special aircraft 

to Germany, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh promised all help to Nepal to ensure 

that it did not become a failed state.

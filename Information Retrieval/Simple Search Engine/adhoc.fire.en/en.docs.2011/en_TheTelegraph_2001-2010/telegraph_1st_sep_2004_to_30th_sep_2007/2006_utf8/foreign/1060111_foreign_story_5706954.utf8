 If pandemic hits, HSBC is prepared

 London, Jan. 10 (Reuters): The worlds third-biggest bank, HSBC Holdings Plc, has drawn up plans to cope without up to half its staff if there is a pandemic triggered by bird flu, HSBC said today.

 London-based HSBC said the potential absence of up to 50 per cent of its staff did not relate to how many workers it expected to contract flu, but was a hypothetical number used for worst case scenario planning.

 It included employees staying at home with flu, some with secondary infections and others absent to care for family or to avoid infection.

 The Financial Times newspaper quoted HSBCs head of group crisis management, Bob Piggott, as saying several other banks were moving towards similar estimates for staff absences during any pandemic lasting up to three months.

 Piggott said HSBC had devised plans to increase working from home and other ways to get over the impact of a pandemic. A loss of 50 per cent of a companys staff would be far higher than official British government estimates of the likely absentee level.

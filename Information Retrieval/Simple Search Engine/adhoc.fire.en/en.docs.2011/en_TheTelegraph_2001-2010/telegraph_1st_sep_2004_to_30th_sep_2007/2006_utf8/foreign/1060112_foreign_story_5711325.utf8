 Turkey virus in endemic threat

 Ankara, Jan. 11 (Reuters): Turkey stepped up efforts today to halt an outbreak of deadly bird flu as a UN body warned that the virus risked becoming firmly established there and posed a serious threat to neighbouring countries.

 The virus has been found in wild birds and poultry in a third of Turkish provinces, killed at least two children and infected more than a dozen people in little more than a week.

 Scientists fear the H5N1 bird flu virus, which is known to have killed 78 people, could mutate into a form that can spread easily between humans, leading to a pandemic.

 WHO doctors said there was no sign of human-to-human transmission in the Turkish outbreak. They called for calm and said there was no reason for people not to visit Turkey, a tourism magnet.

 However, experts from another UN body, the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), said the virus risked becoming a constant problem in Turkey as it is in poultry in parts of Asia.

 The highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 could become endemic in Turkey, the FAO said in a statement.

 Juan Lubroth, senior FAO animal health officer, said the virus might be spreading despite measures taken to combat it.

 The world animal health body OIE said Ankara should consider poultry vaccination in addition to culling birds.

 Paris, Jan. 12 (AP): Frances culture minister honoured Penelope Cruz, calling her a great European actress and proclaiming her a Knight in the Order of Arts and Letters.

 Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres praised in particular her international film career, which includes roles in French, English, Italian and her native Spanish.

 Its Frances role to be the ardent defender of cultural diversity and to recognise those who extend, with their talent, the culture of their country, the minister said. Im happy to have honoured this great European actress.

 The Spaniard, who is in Paris to promote her new movie Bandidas, received the ministers accolades with modesty. Im not sure that I deserve it, but I will do my best so that you wont regret it, Cruz said. 

 The minister cited Bandidas as an example of Cruzs ability to work with a diverse cast of international talent. The film, a Western about two female outlaws set in 19th century Mexico, was written and produced by French filmmaker Luc Besson. The film co-stars Mexican heartthrob Salma Hayek, who was present at the ceremony and gave Cruz a congratulatory hug.

 Scot smoking ban

 Edinburgh, March 24 (Reuters): Scotland on Sunday becomes the first part of Britain to ban smoking in pubs, restaurants and workplaces, aiming to tackle the poor public health record that has earned it the nickname sick man of Europe.

 Officials say the blanket ban on lighting up in enclosed public spaces, inspired by similar measures in Ireland and other countries in the past few years, will eventually stop some 1,000 deaths a year from passive smoking.

 Scotland has a higher rate of heart disease, of cancer and of strokes than most other European countries, said first minister Jack McConnell, head of the Scottish government.

 It is time for drastic action to change that situation for future generations, he said today.

 Surveys show more than 60 per cent of people in Scotland support the plan. But around 30 per cent of the population are smokers and only a quarter of them favour the measure, which comes into force at dawn on Sunday.

 Critics see it as an attack on the traditional lifestyle of the working class who formed the backbone of Scottish society. Publicans are unhappy too, fearing their customers will opt to stay at home once they are banned from smoking in bars.

 For a normal working man, a fag and a pint go hand in hand, said Peter Cruikshank, landlord of the Spiders Web pub in Edinburgh, enjoying a cigarette in his wooden-floored bar.

 In here right now Ive got eight customers, he said, looking round the smoky pub. Theyre all smokers.

 At the bar, John Reid, a 62-year-old former soldier sporting green and blue tattoos on his hands and arms, said the new measure would rob him of a highlight of his day. I just think its out of order. I come down here every day for a drink and have a smoke, he said between puffs. Thats my only pleasure ? a drink and a smoke.

 Some customers said they would visit the pub less often. Others said they would still come but nip outside for a smoke.

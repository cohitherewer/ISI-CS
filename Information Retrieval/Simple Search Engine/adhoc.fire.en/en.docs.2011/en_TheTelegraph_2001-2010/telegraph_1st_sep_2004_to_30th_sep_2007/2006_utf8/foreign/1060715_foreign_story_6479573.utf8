 Kylie hope message

 Kylie: Doom and gloom

 London, July 14 (AP): Australian pop star Kylie Minogue offered a message of hope to cancer patients, speaking for the first time about her breast cancer treatment in an interview with Sky One to be broadcast on Sunday.

 The 38-year-old singer was close to tears during much of the interview in which she said the diagnosis was like a bomb has dropped.

 I love to say: you can get through it, she said. You can. The singer told Sky Ones Cat Deeley there were days she was unable to leave her bed. I dont want to go into the doom and gloom of it. Its hard, she said. Minogue said she had one day between her diagnosis in May 2005 and the operation on her breast.

 I had one days grace where I knew and went for a walk down to the beach with my brother, she said. The next day we made an announcement, and then I was virtually a prisoner in the house.

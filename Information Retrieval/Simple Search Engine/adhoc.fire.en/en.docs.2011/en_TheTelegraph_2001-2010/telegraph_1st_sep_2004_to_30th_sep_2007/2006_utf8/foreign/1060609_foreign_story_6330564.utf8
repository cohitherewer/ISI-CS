 Iran nuke talks

 Tehran, June 8 (Reuters): Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has said threats would not work in talks to settle the dispute over Irans nuclear policy but he was ready to clear up misunderstandings with the rest of the world.

 He said Iran was not willing to abandon its nuclear rights -- usually shorthand in Iran for uranium enrichment -- but some analysts said his speech reflected a greater readiness in Tehran for talks on the countrys atomic ambitions.

 Born to be dull

 London, Nov. 10 (Reuters): Looking for safe excitement? November is fig month at the Dull Mens Club, a place in cyberspace for men who feel born to be mild and enjoy watching grass grow and photographing garden sheds.

 Figs are good for you. High fibre and high nutritional value ... fat-free, sodium-free, cholesterol-free ... not to mention the great taste. And they are portable, enthuses the Dull Mens Club website (http://www.dullmen.com). While the rest of the Web teems with hazards, this monochrome haven boasts no violence or scary scenes.

 Baby hatch

 Tokyo (Reuters): A Japanese hospital 

 plans to set up the countrys first baby hatch 

 where mothers can drop off unwanted babies, who could then 

 be offered for adoption. Jikei Hospital in southern Japan 

 said it plans to install what it is calling a storks 

 cradle, consisting of a flap in an outside wall which 

 opens on to a small incubated bed. An alarm bell would ring 

 within minutes after a baby was deposited so hospital staff 

 could come and care for the infant.

 UK plans finger scans

 London, Dec. 12 (PTI): The British government will introduce biometric data collection or finger-scans for all those applying for a visa to visit Britain from 2008.

 All visa applicants, irrespective of their location or nationality, will have to go to a collection point to provide finger-scans and get their pictures taken which will have to be submitted with their visa application.

 The rule will come into effect from January 1, 2008, and has been taken as part of a worldwide biometric identification process to protect an individuals identity, allow future entry to the UK, combat visa fraud and reduce abuse of the Britains immigration systems, the British Foreign and Commonwealth office said.

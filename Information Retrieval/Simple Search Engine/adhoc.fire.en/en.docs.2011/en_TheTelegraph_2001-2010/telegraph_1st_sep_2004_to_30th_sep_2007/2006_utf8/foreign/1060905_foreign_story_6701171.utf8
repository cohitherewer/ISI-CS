 Hilton hoax album

 London, Sept. 4 (AP): Some Paris Hilton fans may have got more or less than they bargained for when they bought her debut album.

 Record chain HMV said yesterday it had pulled from shelves several copies of Hiltons Paris album that appeared to have been doctored by British graffiti artist and prankster Banksy.

 The doctored version includes a topless image of the celebrity heiress, as well as a picture in which she sports the head of a dog. A sticker advertises the albums hits Why am I Famous?, What Have I Done?, and What Am I For? Instead of Hiltons perky pop, the CD inside features 40 minutes of remixed music by a musician identified only as DM.

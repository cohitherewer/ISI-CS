 Space for love

 Tokyo, July 12 (Reuters): Japanese spouses can have their vows of love launched into outer space and stored there from next year ? as long as they buy platinum wedding rings.

 Couples who buy a platinum wedding ring at stores from August to December this year can write their vows of love on a campaign website.

 The messages will be stored on a DVD together with pictures of the loving couples, which will then be blasted off to a space station in a Soyuz rocket due to be launched in March 2007.

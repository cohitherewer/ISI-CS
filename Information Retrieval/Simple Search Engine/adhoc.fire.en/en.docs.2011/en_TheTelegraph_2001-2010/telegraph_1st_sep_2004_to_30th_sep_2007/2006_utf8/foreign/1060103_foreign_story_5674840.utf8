 Options before EU limited

 Brussels, Jan. 2 (Reuters): 

 EU nations may look with increasing scepticism at Russias 

 reliability as an energy partner after the resource-rich 

 country cut gas supplies to Ukraine, but the blocs 

 room for manoeuvre is limited.

 For the time being they can do nothing but wring their hands, said Daniel Gros, director at the Centre for European Policy Studies in Brussels, of the EUs choices in responding to the crisis that has hit gas supplies at the height of winter.

 In the longer run they have to build as many pipelines as possible from as many directions as possible. Thats all they can do. And, of course, increase dramatically their strategic stockpiles.

 Several European countries reported sharp falls in deliveries of Russian gas today after Moscow turned off the taps when Ukraine rejected demands for a fourfold price rise.

 The EU executive Commission has expressed concern about the dispute and called a meeting of member states energy experts on Wednesday. 

 Russia has shown its not above the temptation of using some bargaining power or blackmail, said Gros. It shows that if there is a way to get some political-economic advantages from a temporary weakness of your partner, the Russians will use it.

 Analysts said the EU could do little to reduce its dependence on Russian energy. In terms of transport fuels, nothing really, said Jonathan Stern, director of gas research at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies. In terms of stationary fuels... obviously there is talk about renewables, coal and nuclear. Stern said the EU should offer to mediate in the dispute and said, despite EU concerns, Russia has been a good partner.

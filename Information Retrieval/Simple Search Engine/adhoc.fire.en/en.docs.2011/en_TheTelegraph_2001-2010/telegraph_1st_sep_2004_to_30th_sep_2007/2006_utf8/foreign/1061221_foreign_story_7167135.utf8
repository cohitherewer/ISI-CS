 Duff order

 Duff : No threat 

 Los Angeles, Dec. 20 (AP): Hilary Duff and her boyfriend, Good Charlotte singer Joel Madden, have dropped a request for a temporary restraining order against a celebrity photographer. 

 A Los Angeles court dismissed the case against David Joseph Klein, 50, according to documents filed on Monday. 

 Duff and Madden had sought restraining orders against Klein and Maksim Myaskovskiy, 18. Myaskovskiy has been charged with stalking the singer-actress after police said he called a private security firm employed by Duff last month and threatened her and Madden.

 Partying Lohan grilled

 Lohan: Exhausted?

 Los Angeles, July 29 (Reuters): Actress Lindsay Lohan has been accused of heavy partying by a producer of her latest movie after a series of late arrivals and absences from the set that her spokeswoman said was due to illness.

 You and your representatives have told us that your various late arrivals and absences from the set have been the result of illness; today we were told it was heat exhaustion, James Robinson, chief executive of Morgan Creek Productions, wrote in a letter that was made public yesterday. We are well aware that your ongoing all night heavy partying is the real reason for your so called exhaustion. We refuse to accept bogus excuses for your behaviour, Robinson added.

 A Morgan Creek spokesman said the letter posted on celebrity media websites was authentic, but he declined to comment beyond what was written.

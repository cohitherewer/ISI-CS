 Matts turn to be dad

 Matt Damon and Luciana Bozan: Healthy

 Los Angeles, June 12 (Reuters): Matt Damons wife has given birth to a baby girl named Isabella, the couples first child together, a spokeswoman for the actor of movies such as The Bourne Supremacy said today.

 The girl was born at a hospital in Miami last night, and mother and child are healthy and doing fine, said spokeswoman Jennifer Allen. She gave no further details.

 Damon, 35, and wife Luciana Bozan, 30, married in December in New York. She has a seven-year-old daughter from a previous marriage. The actor rose to stardom in the 1997 low-budget movie Good Will Hunting, which he co-wrote and starred in with his friend Ben Affleck. The movie earned them an Oscar for original screenplay.

 Early in his career, Damon enjoyed a reputation as a solid actor in films like The Talented Mr Ripley in 1999. He hit big at box offices with the 2002 spy thriller The Bourne Identity and its 2004 follow-up The Bourne Supremacy. Other recent movie successes include.

 Damon has been involved with Luciana, a former Miami bartender, for about two years. The couple became engaged in September. In a previous marriage, she went by the name Luciana Barroso.

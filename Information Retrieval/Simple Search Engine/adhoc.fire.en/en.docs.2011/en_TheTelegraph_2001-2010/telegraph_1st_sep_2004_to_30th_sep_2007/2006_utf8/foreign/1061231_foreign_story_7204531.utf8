 Raghad (top) and Rana 

 Dubai, Dec. 30 (Reuters): Saddam Husseins daughters watched his final moments on television and were proud to see the former Iraqi President face his executioners without flinching, their spokeswoman said today.

 They felt very proud as they saw their father facing his executioners so bravely, standing up, said Rasha Oudeh, who was with Saddams daughters Raghad and Rana as they watched television footage of the noose being tightened around his neck.

 They pray that his soul rests in peace. They were calm and faced this with courage, she said by telephone from Jordan.

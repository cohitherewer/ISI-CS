 Dog tale tops list

 Philadelphia, Feb. 26 (Reuters): The tale of a rambunctious puppy is proving its staying power in the dog-eat-dog world of US bestsellers.

 With more than one million copies in print, Marley and Me ? Life and Love with the Worlds Worst Dog has struck a chord with dog lovers who are laughing and crying over author John Grogans account of his yellow Labrador retriever. The story is more than a recounting of Marleys antics that include chewing through doors, expulsion from obedience school, clawing paint off concrete walls, devouring furniture, swallowing valuable jewellery and swooning over soiled diapers.

 The excitable, good-natured lab also knows how to protect the familys tiny children and consoles the couple when they grieve over a miscarriage.

 The non-fiction has been on The New York Times bestseller list for 17 weeks. 

 Blondes

 Tokyo (Reuters): Its a case of 

 the vanishing blondes. Ten years ago, a stroll through central 

 Tokyo could leave travellers wondering what country they 

 were in as they watched a parade of tanned, fair-haired 

 women walking tall in precarious platform shoes. Now fashion 

 has moved on and hairdressers say bleached blonde tresses 

 are going the way of fake tans, although a dark brown tint 

 still seems more popular than natural black. The only fair-haired 

 women to be seen on the covers of Japanese fashion magazines 

 nowadays are foreign models.

 Postal trip 

 Washington (Reuters): A woman who tripped and fell over letters, packages and periodicals left on her front porch can sue the US Postal Service for damages, the US Supreme Court has ruled. Barbara Dolan said she suffered wrist and back injuries when she fell in 2001 in front of her Pennsylvania home. She said postal employees acted negligently by leaving the mail on her porch.

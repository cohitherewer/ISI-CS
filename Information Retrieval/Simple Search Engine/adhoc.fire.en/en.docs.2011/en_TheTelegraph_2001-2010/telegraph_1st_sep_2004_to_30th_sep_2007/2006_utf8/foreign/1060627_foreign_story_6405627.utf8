 Soon, a computer will read minds

 London, June 26 (Reuters): A raised eyebrow, quizzical look or a nod of the head are just a few of the facial expressions computers could soon be using to read peoples minds.

 An emotionally aware computer being developed by British and American scientists will be able to read an individuals thoughts by analysing a combination of facial movements that represent underlying feelings.

 The system we have developed allows a wide range of mental states to be identified just by pointing a video camera at someone, said Prof. Peter Robinson, of the University of Cambridge in England.

 He and his collaborators believe the mind-reading computers applications could range from improving peoples driving skills to helping companies tailor advertising to peoples moods.

 Imagine a computer that could pick the right emotional moment to try to sell you something, a future where mobile phones, cars and websites could read our mind and react to our moods, he added.

 Robinson hopes to get more data to determine whether someone is bored, interested, confused, or agrees or disagrees when it is unveiled at a science exhibition in London.

 People visiting the four-day exhibition organised by the Royal Society, Britains academy of leading scientists, will be invited to take part in a study to hone the programmes abilities.

 The scientists, who are developing the technology in collaboration with researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the US, also hope to get it to accept other inputs such as posture and gesture.

 Our research could enable websites to tailor advertising or products to your mood, Robinson said.For example, a webcam linked with our software could process your image, encode the correct emotional state and transmit information to a website.

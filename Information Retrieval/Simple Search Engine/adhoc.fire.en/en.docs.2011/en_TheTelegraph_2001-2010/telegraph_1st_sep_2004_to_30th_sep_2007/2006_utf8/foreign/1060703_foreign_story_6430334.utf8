 Saddams on most wanted list

 - Tale 

 of two wives ? one iraqi, one Al Qaida

 Baghdad, July 2 (Reuters): Iraq today named Saddam Husseins eldest daughter and first wife on a most wanted list along with top Baathists and al Qaidas new leader in Iraq, a day after the bloodiest bombing in three months killed over 60.

 The 41 most wanted list, which offers a $10 million bounty for former Saddam deputy Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri, accuses Saddams daughter, Raghd, and her mother of using millions stolen by the former Iraqi leader to finance Sunni insurgents.

 Raghd has taken a leading role in organising her fathers legal defence in his trial for crimes against humanity. Aged about 40, she lives in Jordan having been granted asylum there.

 Her mother Sajida is also on a list that includes the new head of al Qaida in Iraq, Abu Ayyub al-Masri. The government also offered a $50,000 reward for Masri ? far less than the $5 million the US placed on the man named by Osama bin Laden to succeed Zarqawi. The low sum may be intended to insult.

 Were releasing this list so that our people can know their enemies, national security adviser Mowaffaq al-Rubaie told a televised news conference to unveil the pictorial list.

 In Baghdad, mortar and gunfire rang across a Sunni Arab neighbourhood and militants armed with rocket-propelled grenades prowled the streets, a witness said. US armoured vehicles entered the area as US helicopters flew overhead.

 It was not immediately clear who was involved in the clashes in Adhamiya, a Sunni insurgent bastion near the Shia Sadr City where a car bomb devastated a market in the deadliest blast since a Shia-led unity government was formed six weeks ago.

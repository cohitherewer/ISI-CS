 Pitt humbled

 Toronto, Sept. 11 (Reuters): Hes one of Hollywoods biggest stars, but Brad Pitt says he enjoyed taking a smaller role as part of an ensemble in the new film Babel, and was humbled by the work of several non-professional actors in the film.

 Directed by 21 Grams director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, Babel made its North American debut at the Toronto International Film Festival this weekend.

 An intense tale of four interlocking stories spread across three continents, the film was a favourite at the Cannes film festival. Being a part of an ensemble is always more fun, you dont have to carry the film, Pitt told reporters in Toronto.

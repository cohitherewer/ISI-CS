 Cheney says dunk in water torture useful

 Cheney: Hot potato

 Washington, Oct. 27 (Reuters): Vice-president Dick Cheney was not talking about simulated drowning when he agreed this week that a dunk in water for terrorism suspects might be useful, the White House said today.

 Cheney was asked on Tuesday by a conservative radio host from Fargo, North Dakota: Would you agree a dunk in water is a no-brainer if it can save lives?

 Well, its a no-brainer for me, Cheney replied.

 His comment prompted complaints from human rights advocates that he was endorsing a technique called waterboarding that simulates drowning and is considered torture by some critics.

 If Iran or Syria detained an American, Cheney is saying that it would be perfectly fine for them to hold that Americans head under water until he nearly drowns, if thats what they think they need to do to save Iranian or Syrian lives, said Tom Malinowski, Washington advocacy director for Human Rights Watch.

 Bush, asked about the comment, did not specifically address it. This country doesnt torture. Were not going to torture. We will interrogate people we pick up off the battlefield to determine whether or not theyve got information that will be helpful to protect the country, Bush said.

 White House spokesman Tony Snow insisted that US officials do not talk publicly about interrogation techniques because they are classified. 

 US interrogation techniques came under scrutiny after evidence emerged of the abuse of detainees in Iraq and Afghanistan, damaging Americas image around the world.

 The possibility of waterboarding being used as a technique was a factor in a revolt by three senior Republican senators in September against a Bush proposal for establishing a CIA interrogation programme for terrorism suspects.

 The White House has refused to describe what interrogation techniques will be allowed under the programme, although Arizona Republican Senator John McCain has said he was confident such techniques would be banned under it.

 US missile system ready for operation

 Washington, Oct. 10 (Reuters): A US army missile defence system has proven it can hit enemy ballistic missiles and is now in place in Hawaii where it could be used to respond to any threats from North Korea, a top programme official said yesterday after a reported nuclear test by Pyongyang.

 The Missile Defence Agency, which oversees the programme, also expects to sign early next year a contract with Lockheed Martin Corp. for additional units of the developmental system, known as the Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (THAAD), Colonel Charles Driessnack said at the annual meeting of the Association of the US Army.

 Asked if the system could be declared operational to respond to the current crisis over the North Korean test, he said the system had proven it could intercept enemy missiles and was now positioned where it could do an operation. THAAD is designed to destroy enemy ballistic missiles during the final phase of flight. 

 It is part of the Bush administrations complex missile defence system and is slated to become operational only in 2009.

 Driessnack compared the systems state of readiness to that of another part of the missile defence system, which was activated briefly in July to guard against a Taepodong 2 missile test-fired by North Korea.

 Russia anger

 Russia hit out today at US plans to deploy an anti-missile shield on Polish soil, saying the move was an attempt to destabilise the balance of power.

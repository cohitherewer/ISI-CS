 Hillary slave slap to rivals

 Hillary Clinton: No regrets

 Washington, Jan. 19: Hillary Clinton has made an eye-catching pitch to re-establish her populist credentials with an assault on her Republican opponents in which she compared her foes in Congress with slaveowners.

 To the delight of both the Right and the Left, the unofficial front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008 abruptly abandoned the considered language she has favoured in recent months.

 When you look at the way the House of Representatives has been run it has been run like a plantation and you know what I am talking about, the New York senator told a mostly black audience at a Harlem church this week.

 She added: I predict to you that this administration will go down in history as one of the worst that has ever governed our country.

 The former First Lady has over the last year moved steadily to the centre of American politics, opposing calls for a swift withdrawal of troops from Iraq and shifting a little from her traditional liberal position on abortion.

 In the process, she has irked many of the partys core liberal supporters, who see the Democratic leaders as too mealy-mouthed and non-confrontational.

 Clinton stood by her remarks yesterday. Asked if she regretted the comment, she said: Absolutely not. Congress is run in a top-down way. There is no meaningful debate on important issues.

 The White House fired back, calling her criticism out of bounds. Reacting to Clintons comments in a flight back home after a trip to Africa, First Lady Laura Bush said: I think its ridiculous, its a ridiculous comment. Thats what I think.

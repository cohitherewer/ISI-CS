 Bird flu reaches France

 Paris, Feb. 17 (Reuters): France has detected its first case of bird flu in a duck found in eastern France, although it was not yet clear the fowl was carrying the deadly H5N1 strain transmissible to humans, the farm ministry said today.

 The test showed the H5 virus was present and had strong similarities with the H5N1 Asian influenza, it said. Further tests were being conducted on the wild duck, which was found dead on Monday near Lyon in a region famous for the quality of its chickens.

 The pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus has spread from Asia to Europe and Africa, infecting 169 people and killing at least 91 and leading to the destruction of millions of birds.

 Scientists fear that if the virus acquired the ability to easily pass from person to person, it could cause a pandemic that would kill millions.

 France said in a statement it had immediately installed a security zone of 3 km around the spot where the bird was found. Veterinarians would check all birds in that zone.

 Pope sets term for dialogue

 Vatican City, Oct. 11 (Reuters): Pope Benedict said today Christians could not allow their beliefs and identity to be diluted for the sake of dialogue with other religions.

 We have to remember that this identity of ours calls for strength, clarity, and courage in the world in which we live, he told pilgrims and tourists at his weekly general audience.

 Since he made controversial comments on Islam a month ago, the question of how much dialogue Catholics should have with other religions has become a point of debate in the Church.

 Some Catholics feel they have compromised too much of their Christian identity in the four decades since the 1962-1965 Second Vatican Council called for increased dialogue with Muslims, Jews and members of other religions. The Pope said the dialogue started after the Council must continue.

 But this path of dialogue that is so necessary must not lead us to forget the duty to firmly underscore the tenets and identity of our Christian faith that cannot be renounced.

 In an address at Regensburg University in his native Germany on September 12, the Pope quoted 14th century Byzantine Emperor Manuel II Palaeologus, who spoke of the Prophet Mohammads command to spread by the sword the faith he preached.

 The speech sparked violent protests in several Muslim countries and handed him the toughest international crisis since his election in April 2005. The leader of more than one billion Catholics has several times expressed regret for the reaction to the speech, saying his words were misunderstood. But he has stopped short of the unequivocal apology wanted by Muslims.

 The Vatican today posted on its website (www.vatican.va) an annotated version of the speech.

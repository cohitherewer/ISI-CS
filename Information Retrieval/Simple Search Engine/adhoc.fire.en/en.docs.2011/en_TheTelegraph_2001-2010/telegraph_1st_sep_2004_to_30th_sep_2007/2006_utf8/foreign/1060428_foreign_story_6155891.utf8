 Flee in style

 San Francisco, April 27 (Reuters): San Francisco police arrested a man and woman suspected of robbing a bank and fleeing in style by using a limousine as their getaway car, officials said yesterday.

 Roy Westry and Cynthia Johnson, both recently on parole and in their forties, were pulled over on Tuesday afternoon by police officers alerted to a nearby bank robbery involving a 2006 Cadillac limousine. The vehicle belong to Westrys employer.

 Geneva (Reuters): Deep Purple, whose 1970s hit Smoke on the Water describes a concert fire raging in Montreux, is returning to the Swiss lakeside resort to close the 40th annual jazz festival, organisers announced on Thursday. Deep Purple wrote the song, whose opening four-note riff became one of the most famous in hard rock history after watching a December 1971 fire at the Montreux Casino.

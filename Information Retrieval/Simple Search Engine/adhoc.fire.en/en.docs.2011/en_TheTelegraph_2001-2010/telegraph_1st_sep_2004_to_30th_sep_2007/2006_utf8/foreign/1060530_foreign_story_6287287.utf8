 Berlin, May 29 (Reuters): Irans President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad told Germans they should no longer allow themselves to be held prisoner by a sense of guilt over the Holocaust and reiterated doubts whether the Holocaust even happened.

 In an interview with Germanys Der Spiegel magazine, Ahmadinejad said he doubted whether Germans were allowed to write the truth about the Holocaust and said he was still considering travelling to Germany for the World Cup soccer tournament.

 I believe the German people are prisoners of the Holocaust. More than 60 million were killed in World War Two ... The question is: Why is it that only Jews are at the centre of attention?, he said in the interview published yesterday.

 How long is this going to go on? he added. How long will the German people be held hostage to the Zionists?... Why should you feel obligated to the Zionists? Youve paid reparations for 60 years and will have to pay for another 100 years.

 German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other leaders have said his previous remarks questioning whether the Holocaust happened were unacceptable. Denying the Holocaust is a serious crime in Germany punishable with a prison term of up to five years.

 Six million Jews were killed by the Nazis and their allies in concentration camps.

 In a rare interview with western magazine, Ahmadinejad said if the Holocaust really happened, then the Jews should be moved from Israel back to Europe.

 We say if the Holocaust happened, then the Europeans must accept the consequences and the price should not be paid by Palestine. If it did not happen, then the Jews must return to where they came from.

 World Cup visit

 Ahmadinejad said he was still considering going to Germany to support Iran in the World Cup despite a protest stirred by a worldwide network of Zionists.

 Irans first World Cup match is against Mexico in Nuremberg on June 11 two days after the tournament starts and German interior minister Wolfgang Schaeuble says he would be welcome to come because Germany wants to be a good host.

 The invitation sparked protests from groups who said his anti-Israeli comments were unacceptable.

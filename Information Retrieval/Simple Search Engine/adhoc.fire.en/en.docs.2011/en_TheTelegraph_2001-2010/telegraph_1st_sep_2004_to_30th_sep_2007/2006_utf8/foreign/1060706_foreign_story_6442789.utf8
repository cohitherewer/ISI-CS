 Scanner on Blair deputy

 London, July 5 (Reuters): British Prime Minister Tony Blairs deputy, John Prescott, faced an official investigation today into his contacts with an American billionaire who hopes to open a massive casino in London.

 The latest revelations about Prescott, who has also embarrassed his boss by having an affair with his secretary and keeping a free mansion, follow months of allegations of sleaze and mismanagement in Blairs government. 

 Parliaments standards commissioner said he was launching a preliminary inquiry after Prescott said he had stayed at a ranch owned by US oil and entertainment mogul Philip Anschutz, who wants to turn Londons Millennium Dome into a casino.

 Having considered the matter, (the commissioner) thinks there is probably enough substance in the allegation to warrant further investigation, said a spokeswoman for Sir Philip Mawer.

 Combative Prescott, known for punching a member of the public who hurled an egg at him at a 2001 election rally, sought to calm critics by entering the stay in a register of interests.

 But he insists he has done no wrong as he has no power over gambling licence decisions.

 Opposition Conservatives smelt blood.

 Why on earth did the deputy prime minister, the second most powerful political figure in the land, have seven meetings with somebody who wants to bid for the only slot available for a regional casino?, said Conservative Hugo Swire on BBC Radio.

 Some Labour lawmakers were also uneasy.

 It does lead to a perception things were going on which clearly werent going on, Labours Rob Marris told BBC Radio.

 Blair, who promised Labour would bewhiter than white when it took power in 1997, has consistently backed Prescott even after lurid headlines after he cheated on his wife.

 But he was stripped of most governmental responsibilities, and later gave up a free official country residence after he was photographed playing croquet on its lawn during working hours.

 Critics say he should go and one ally hinted to the Evening Standard that Prescott may be thinking of quitting.

 I hope he fights on but I could well understand if like most human beings (he) said hed had enough, said Peter Snape, a member of the upper house of parliament.

 Losing Prescott would hurt Blair.

 The former ships steward has links to the partys left wing and is one of the few figures able to soothe tensions between Blair and his likely successor, finance minister Gordon Brown.

 Prescotts exit could prompt calls for Blair, who has said he will not stand in 2009s expected election, to step down and allow simultaneous elections for Labours leader and deputy.

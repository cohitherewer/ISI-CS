The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Holy book row

 Chicago, Dec. 21 (Reuters): Plans by the first Muslim elected to the US Congress to use the Quran as part of his swearing-in ceremonies have unleashed criticism from people who think he should use a Bible.

 The flap involving Keith Ellison, a Democrat elected to the House of Representatives from Minnesota last month, deals more with symbol than substance since House members are sworn in as a group with no Bibles or other texts involved. In fact the US constitution states that no religious test shall ever be required to hold public office. But in a country where three out of every four people consider themselves Christian, the Bible has traditionally been used in ensuing unofficial ceremonies. These events among other things provide each member with an individual photo opportunity. 

 Ellison began hearing growls and gripes from the blogosphere and at least one conservative radio commentator after he said he would use the Quran in his unofficial ceremony.

 The controversy grew this week with disclosure of a letter Representative Virgil Goode, a Virginia Republican, wrote to some of his constituents saying: The Muslim Representative from Minnesota was elected by the voters of that district and if American citizens dont wake up and adopt (my) position on immigration there will likely be many more Muslims elected to office and demanding the use of the Quran.

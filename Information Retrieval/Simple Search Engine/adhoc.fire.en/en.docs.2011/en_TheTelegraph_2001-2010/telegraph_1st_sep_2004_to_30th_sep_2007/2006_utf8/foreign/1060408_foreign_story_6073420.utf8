 Bush told: You should be ashamed

 Charlotte (North Carolina), April 7 (AFP): President George W. Bush faced a rare display of hostility from the public at a forum here, when a man said he should be ashamed of yourself.

 The President had invited questions from the audience in a bid to show he was not out of touch with voters. 

 A man, who appeared to be in his 50s, said: Okay, I dont have a question. 

 What I wanted to say to you is that I,in my lifetime, have never felt more ashamed of, nor more frightened by, my leadership in Washington, including the presidency, by the Senate, and ..., the man said, as the audience began booing. 

 No, wait a sec ? let him speak, Bush said. I feel like despite your rhetoric, that compassion and common sense have been left far behind during your administration, and I would hope from time to time that you have the humility to be ashamed of yourself inside yourself, the man said.

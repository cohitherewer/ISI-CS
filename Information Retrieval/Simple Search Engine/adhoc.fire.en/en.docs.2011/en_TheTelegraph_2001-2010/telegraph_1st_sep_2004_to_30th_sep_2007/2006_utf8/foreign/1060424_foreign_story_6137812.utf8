 Haunted boat

 Mystic, Connecticut, April 23 (AP): Specialists in paranormal research are investigating whether a historic whaling ship might be home to the ghost of a long-ago seafarer. 

 The researchers on Friday night spent some time on the Charles W. Morgan where several visitors have reported seeing the apparition. The 165-year-old craft made 37 ocean voyages in search of whales in 60 years. Some people said that while touring the ship last summer, they saw a man in what appeared to be 19th-century clothing working below the deck. The man, with a pipe in his mouth, nodded at them but did not speak. 

 When they asked an official about him, they were 

told that no one was assigned to be on the boat that day. There were about 40 

other reports of possible paranormal activities. 

Swedish W

 Stockholm (AP): The letter W has entered the 

mainstream of the Swedish language. Swedish linguists have always viewed W 

as a lesser sibling of V, as the two are pronounced identically in 

Swedish. The few Swedish words that have W have been borrowed from 

other languages and have so far been lumped under the V section in 

dictionaries. Sweden is called Sverige in Swedish and its language is named Svenska. 

 Dad kidnap 

 Harare (Reuters): Three Zimbabweans have prevented their father from committing bigamy by abducting him from his own wedding. The three men, who accuse their father of neglecting their mother, brandished axes and knives at wedding guests before bundling him into a car and whisking him away.

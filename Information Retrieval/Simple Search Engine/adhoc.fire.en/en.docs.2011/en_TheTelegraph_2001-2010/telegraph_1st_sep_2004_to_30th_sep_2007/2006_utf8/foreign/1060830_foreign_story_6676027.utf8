 Bugti body not with govt, says Pak

 Bugti: Bloody legacy

 Islamabad, Aug. 29: A senior Pakistani military official today scotched rumours that the body of Baluchistan nationalist leader Nawab Akbar Khan Bugti was with the state government.

 The official said the body is still buried under the rubble of the collapsed cave in the hilly Kohlu region of Baluchistan.

 This is now beyond any doubt that he [Bugti] was present in the cave when it collapsed with a bang on August 26, chief military spokesman Major General Shaukat Sultan told a press briefing in Rawalpindi, three days after Bugti was killed in a military operation in the mountainous Kohlu region.

 Quoting a guide who survived the assault on the cave, Sultan said an explosion was heard as a team of government officials went inside the cave probably for talks with Bugti.

 He stressed that everyone present in the cave, including Bugti died, and the Baluch leaders body was still buried under the rubble.

 Sultan said army engineers have advised the government to clear the rubble by raising pillars inside the cave as the use of explosives would result in its complete collapse. 

 Every effort was made to apprehend him [Bugti] alive and not to kill him, the spokesman said and claimed that security forces have had clear instruction to arrest militants or their commanders alive.

 Confirming the death of seven army officials in the incident, Pakistan Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz said their bodies were found at the mouth of the cave as they had not gone inside when the roof of the cave collapsed.

 Aziz claimed that the army also found one hundred million Pakistani rupees in a box, AK-47 rifles and 107 mm rockets from the cave.

 This was Sultans news conference since Bugti was killed along with several of his commanders during a military operation on Saturday. 

 In Quetta today, security forces and gunmen clashed after prayers for Bugti, while a blast elsewhere killed three people, police said.

 Police said about 10,000 people had attended prayers for Bugti in Quetta. Mourners later threw stones at police and set fire to government offices, shops and vehicles. Firing erupted between protesters on rooftops and police and paramilitary troops below, a witness said. Sporadic gunfire went on for several hours.

 Police initially said a constable had been killed but later said they made a mistake and two police were wounded. 

 In a separate development, Pakistans parliament today rejected a no-confidence motion against Aziz.

 Lashkar leader

 Pakistani authorities rearrested the former Lashkar-e-Toiba leader, Hafiz Mohammed Saeed, today for 60 days just hours after he was released following almost three weeks in custody, his spokesman said.

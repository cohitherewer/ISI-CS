 Bush feels Right chill

 ALEC RUSSELL

 Washington, March 11: Americas great war leaders were saluted at this weeks annual dinner of the American Enterprise Institute, the supertanker of Right-wing think-tanks.

 Until recently, it would have seemed natural for President George W. Bush ? toppler of the Taliban, smasher of Saddam ? to be on the list. No longer.

 The lecture began with George Washington and ended with Franklin Roosevelt. Then the drinking, dancing and muttering began. I would be happy for him [Bush] to leave office tomorrow, confided one self-declared fervent Republican.

 Apart from the judges [his nomination of two staunch conservatives to the Supreme Court] what has he achieved? Iraq? The budget deficit? And now the ports. This last was a reference to the fiasco over Bushs support for the attempted takeover of six ports by an Arab company.

 Bush yesterday defended his record with his usual blend of Texan grit and self-deprecating wit. I think people should be allowed to criticise me all they want, he said. And they do. His audience laughed but it is no longer just the liberals who are scoffing at his performance.

 Increasingly Republicans of all stripes, from the neo-conservative thinkers who provided the intellectual ballast for his policies to traditional conservatives in the heartland, are starting to lose faith.

 Until this week, even as the middle-of-the-road voters who saw him safely back into the White House in 2004 were showing alarm over Iraq, runaway government spending and his leadership, the Republican base stayed loyal. 

 But yesterday, an Associated Press-Ipsos poll presented a different picture. Nearly four out of five Americans, including 70 per cent of Republicans, think that civil war will break out in Iraq. Since last month, Bushs job approval among Republicans has gone from 82 to 74 per cent.

 Republican congressmen are looking to Novembers mid-term elections and increasingly see their once great leader as a hindrance to their chances of retaining control of Congress.

 Obviously its the winter of our discontent, said Tom Cole, a Republican representative from Oklahoma.

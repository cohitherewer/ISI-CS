 Fresh France strike called

 Paris, March 29 (Reuters): French unions today called for a fresh one-day strike, stepping up pressure on Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin the day after millions marched to demand he abandon a contentious youth job contract.

 The unions urged President Jacques Chirac in a letter to use his constitutional powers to send back to parliament for revision an equal opportunities law that could then be gutted of the CPE first job contract measures. The Prime Ministers rigidity only reinforces the unions determination to take further action, the UNSA union said.

 The contract allows companies to fire under 26-year-olds easily during a two-year trial period, a measure opponents say will create a generation of disposable workers. 

 Protests over the measure have disrupted studies and exams at the bulk of Frances 84 universities and the government ordered head teachers of schools still blockaded by protesters to force them open, if necessary with police help.

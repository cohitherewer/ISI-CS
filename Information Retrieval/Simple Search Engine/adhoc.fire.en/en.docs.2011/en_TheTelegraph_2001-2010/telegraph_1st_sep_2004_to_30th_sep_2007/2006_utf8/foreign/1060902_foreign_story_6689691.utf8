 Iran plane fire kills 28

 Tehran, Sept. 1 (Reuters): An Iranian airliner caught fire after a tyre burst on landing at an airport in the northeast of the country today, killing 28 of the 148 people aboard, state television said.

 Earlier reports had suggested a death toll of 80.

 Nourollah Rezai-Niaraki, head of Irans civil aviation organisation, told state TV that 43 people on board the plane had been injured but the rest escaped unharmed.

 Television pictures showed a broken-up plane with parts of its fuselage charred. The cockpit appeared to be largely unaffected by the fire, as did much of the rear portion of the aircraft.

 Firefighters were shown extinguishing fires in parts of the smouldering wreck and clambering over other areas of the fuselage, carrying out corpses covered in blankets.

 The plane, a Russian-built Tupolev 154, caught fire at 1015 GMT after slipping off the side of the runway when a tyre burst on landing at the city of Masshad, site of Irans holiest shrine, state media said.

 The flight crew and the pilot of this flight survived, and this will be a great help to find out the cause of the accident as soon as possible, roads and transport minister Mohammad Rahmati told Irans students news agency ISNA.

 An Iranairtour official, who asked not to be identified, said the airline was contacting families of the victims. He also said flights to Mashhad had been cancelled after the crash.

 Pilgrims flock to Mashhad throughout the year to visit the tomb of Imam Reza, the eighth Shia imam. The southern city of Bandar Abbas, where the plane began its journey, is Irans main port.

 Air safety experts say Iran has a poor safety record with a string of crashes in recent decades, many involving Russian-made aircraft. US sanctions on the Islamic state have prevented it from buying new aircraft or spares from the West, forcing it to supplement its ageing planes with aircraft from the former Soviet Union.

 The last major plane disaster in Iran involved a military plane which crashed in January, killing at least 11 people. Another military plane hit a tower block in Tehran in December, killing 94 people on board and at least 22 people on the ground.

 Knots in the mine

 Beijing, Dec. 4 (Reuters): A Chinese coal mine has made the news for a reason other than the grim series of accidents nationwide it is claiming a world record for the the highest number of simultaneous weddings held underground.

 The Datong Coal Group in Shanxi province held weddings for 10 miners on Saturday 300 metres down the pitshaft, the Peoples Daily said today.

 The weddings were unprecedented nationwide, even worldwide, mine manager Liu Suisheng told the newspaper. Were going to apply to Guinness World Records.

 China has the worlds deadliest coal mining industry with fatal accidents occurring almost daily as safety regulations are ignored and production is pushed beyond safe limits in the rush for profit.

 The weddings aim to lessen the depressing impression of the mining industry. Marrying the man I love in his workplace is really meaningful to me, one of the brides, 22, said. I had been considering a unique wedding, but never thought of down a mineshaft.

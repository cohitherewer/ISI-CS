 Blackout busts Blaine bubble

 New York, May 9 (Reuters): Stuntman David Blaine failed to break the world record for holding his breath underwater yesterday, falling nearly two minutes short of the record.

 After Blaine spent seven minutes and 8 seconds underwater without any breathing apparatus, he blacked out and trainer Kirk Krack sent two divers into the tank to free him from shackles attached to his ankles.

 According to the website for the ABC television network, which broadcast the stunt live, the world record for holding ones breath underwater is eight minutes, 58 seconds.

 When he was lifted to the edge of an acrylic sphere where he lived underwater for a week, an emotional Blaine told the crowd: I am humbled so much by the support of everybody from New York and from all over the world. This was a very difficult week.

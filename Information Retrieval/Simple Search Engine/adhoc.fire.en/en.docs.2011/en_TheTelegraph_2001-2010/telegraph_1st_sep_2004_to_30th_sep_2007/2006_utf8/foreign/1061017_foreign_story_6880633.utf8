 China yes to inspection, no to checks on high seas

 United Nations, Oct. 16 (Reuters): Chinas UN ambassador said today his country would carry out inspections to spot any suspicious arms from North Korea but ruled out interdiction, an apparent reference to stopping cargo on the high seas.

 Inspections yes, but inspections are different from interception and interdiction. ambassador Wang Guangya said. China voted for the UN Security Council resolutions on Saturday that imposed sanctions on North Korea for its nuclear test.

 But Wang said the resolution did not make it mandatory for all nations to inspect cargo going to and from North Korea. He said states could carry out such an operation as necessary in accordance with their national legal authorities.

 I think in that area, different countries would do it in different ways, he said.

 On Saturday, China made clear it opposed the US-led Proliferation Security Initiative, launched in 2003. The PSI encourages the interdiction of dangerous weapons from North Korea, Iran and other states of concern.

 Less than 1 kiloton

 The US government said today that the test conducted by North Korea on October 9 was a nuclear explosion of less than one kiloton.

 Analysis of air samples collected on October 11, 2006, detected radioactive debris which confirms that North Korea conducted an underground nuclear explosion, the director of national intelligence said.

 He added that the explosion yield was less than a kiloton. By comparison, the nuclear bomb the US dropped on Hiroshima, Japan, in 1945 was about 12.5 kilotons. The announcement last week by North Korea that it had tested a nuclear bomb sharply escalated world concerns over North Koreas nuclear programme.

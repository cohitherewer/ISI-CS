 Hawking divorce

 DAVID SAPSTED

 London, Oct. 20: Prof. Stephen Hawking is to divorce for a second time.

 Papers have been lodged at Cambridge county court to end the 11-year marriage of the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge University to Elaine Hawking, 55. It is understood that the couple both want to divorce following the breakdown of the marriage.

 The author of the best-selling A Brief History of Time was said to be too busy to comment yesterday on the end of the marriage to the woman whose first husband invented the voice synthesiser that he uses.

 This is just a distraction, which is really annoying, Judith Croadsell, his secretary, said of the divorce. 

 We dont have time for any of this.

 A source close to the family strenuously denied a tabloid report that the break-up was caused by Prof. Hawking, 64, having an affair. 

 Prof Hawking, who was struck down with motor neurone disease when he was 22, married Elaine in 1995 after he had left Jane Hawking, his wife of 26 years and mother of his three children.

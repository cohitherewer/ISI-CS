 Kylies crack at book for kids

 - Celeb writers risk and reward

 London, Oct. 1 (Reuters): Australian pop star Kylie Minogue launched her first childrens book at the weekend, joining a long list of celebrities writing for the young.

 Publishing experts say that in the celebrity age, marketing is increasingly important to a books sales and more and more stars are putting pen to paper with varying degrees of success.

 But while kids books can seem the easy option when launching a literary career, they are harder to get right than they appear, childrens authors add.

 From the publishers point of view, the advantage of attracting a big star is clear, despite the risk of critical derision or cynicism within the industry, experts say.

 The first in a series of childrens books by US pop star Madonna, The English Roses, was described by the San Fracisco Chronicle in 2003 as cynical and unimaginative, but it went on to become the fastest selling picture book of all time.

 Minogues book is about how Kylie becomes a showgirl with the help of a dedicated group of friends, and was written while the singer recovered from breast cancer treatment. It features art- work inspired by drawings sent by fans during convalescence.

 The book, published by Penguin arm Puffin, went on sale on September 21 in Australia and Britain, and was officially launched by the 38-year-old at a book signing in London at the weekend.

 I think its a nice, frothy, bubbly confection, said Graham Marks, childrens editor at Publishing News. Its not literature, but theres nothing wrong with that.

 The book is the latest step on the singers comeback trail. Her Showgirl Tour, postponed in May 2005 when she was diagnosed with the disease, resumes in November.

 I met with the publishers whilst I was having treatment, so yes, it was therapeutic to be working on something that I could basically do through meetings and on the computer and on the Internet, Minogue said.

 Caroline Horn, childrens editor at the Bookseller publication, said professional writers sometimes felt resentment towards celebrities who can command large advances.

 Childrens authors typically get an advance of 5,000-10,000 pounds ($10,000-20,000), rising to 20,000-30,000 pounds if they are well established, but such figures can be eclipsed by stars. A lot of whats selling these days comes down to the PR and the marketing, Horn said.

 That is the trend now. Books and authors are becoming more and more of a brand. But at the same time I think its hard for publishers for it not to seem a little cynical.

 Leading childrens author Geraldine McCaughrean, whose official sequel to J.M. Barries classic Peter Pan is released this week, said resentment was not only about money.

 What really gets up writers noses is when people who have no association with books or talent for writing do it as if its something that anyone can produce, she told Reuters.

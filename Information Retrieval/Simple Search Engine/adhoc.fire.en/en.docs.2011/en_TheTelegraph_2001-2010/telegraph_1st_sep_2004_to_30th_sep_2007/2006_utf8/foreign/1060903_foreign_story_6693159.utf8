 Cruise has apologised: Shields

 Brooke, Tom: Mending 

 ties 

 Burbank (California), 

 Sept. 2 (AP): Brooke Shields says that Tom Cruise 

 has apologised for publicly criticising her use of anti-depressants.

 The 41-year-old actress says Cruise apologised in person Thursday. He came over to my house, and he gave me a heartfelt apology, Shields said yesterday during an appearance on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. And he apologised for bringing me into the whole thing and for everything that happened. And through it all, I was so impressed with how heartfelt it was. And I didnt feel at any time that I had to defend myself, nor did I feel that he was trying to convince me of anything other than the fact that he was deeply sorry. And I accepted it.

 The two had a public spat last year after the Mission: Impossible III star criticised her for taking anti-depressants after the birth of her first daughter. Cruise, echoing the position of Scientology, said in an appearance on NBCs Today show that depression can be treated with exercise rather than drugs.

 Islamabad, Nov. 18: China plans to help Pakistan build six new nuclear power plants under a new agreement to be signed during Chinese President Hu Jintaos visit to Islamabad next week.

 The agreement will lay a solid foundation of an expanded cooperation between the two countries in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, local media reports quoted senior officials as saying ahead of the Chinese Presidents visit.

 Beijing, which is already assisting Pakistan in construction of the second 300 megawatt nuclear power plant at Chashma, 280 km southwest of Islamabad, had offered to construct six more plants during President Pervez Musharrafs visit to China in February this year.

 The nuclear energy deal with China is likely to give a much-needed boost to energy-deficient Pakistan after the US refused to build nuclear plants.

 The first refusal came during President George W Bushs visit to Islamabad in March last year, two days after the US inked a similar deal with India.

 Bush had ruled out cooperation with Pakistan in the peaceful use of nuclear energy and said that India and Pakistan are two different countries, with different histories and requirements.

 Pakistan, which will require at least 8,800 megawatts of electricity by the year 2020, plans to build six plants with Chinese assistance in the next 10 years. Experts believe that each plant will have the capacity to produce 300 megawatts of electricity. 

 In addition to seeking Chinese help, Pakistan has also urged the 44-member Nuclear Suppliers Group to help it meet its growing energy requirements. However, none of the member states have so far responded positively to Islamabads requests.

 However, three years after the nuclear scandal was uncovered by the International Atomic Energy Agency, China has stood firm with its traditional ally in building more power plants. The history of Sino-Pak cooperation in security, defence and other vital areas dates back to the early 1960s when China helped Pakistan develop a aeronautical complex near Islamabad.

 Pak bypolls

 The Pakistan government today said it will hold bypolls if religious alliance Muttahida Majlis-e-Ammal (MMA) resign from the National Assembly to protest against the amendments to the countrys rape and adultery laws.

 Interior minister Aftab Ahmad Khan Sherpao said the government would hold bypolls if the 66 MMA members resigned from the Assembly.

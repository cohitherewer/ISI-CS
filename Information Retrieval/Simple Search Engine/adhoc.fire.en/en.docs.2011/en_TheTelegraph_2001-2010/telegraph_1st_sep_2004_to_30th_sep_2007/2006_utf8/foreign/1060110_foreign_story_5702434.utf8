 Toxic cloud on polar bears

 Los Angeles, Jan. 9: Already imperiled by melting ice and a brew of toxic chemicals, polar bears throughout the Arctic face an additional threat as flame retardants originating largely in the US are building up in their bodies, according to an international team of wildlife scientists.

 The flame retardants are one of the newest additions to hundreds of industrial compounds and pesticides carried to the Arctic by northbound winds and ocean currents. 

 Accumulating in the fatty tissues of animals, many chemicals grow more concentrated as larger creatures eat smaller ones, turning the Arctics top predators and native people into some of the most contaminated living organisms on Earth.

 In urban areas, particularly in North America, researchers already have shown that levels of flame retardants called polybrominated diphenyls, or PBDEs, are growing at a rapid pace in people and wildlife.

 Although they have been found in much lower concentrations in the Arctic, scientists say their toxic legacy will persist there for years because they are slow to break down, particularly in cold climates.

 Scientists say that other industrial chemicals with properties similar to PBDEs are already weakening the bears immune systems, altering their bone structure, skewing their sex hormones and perhaps even causing small numbers of hermaphroditic bears.

 What remains uncertain, however, is whether those physiological changes are killing bears or reducing their populations. Some experts suspect that many cubs, which are contaminated by their mothers milk, are not surviving.

 Rebuke in bottle

 New York, Feb. 4 (PTI): When Captain Harvey Bennett tossed five bottles with messages into the ocean, he wondered whether he would ever get any of them back.

 Six months later, the New York-based sailor did get back one bottle by post, along with a stinging rebuke from across the Atlantic ? asking him not to litter up beaches.

 Someone by the name of Henry Biggelsworth had found the bottle in Bournemouth, England, and used the opportunity to lecture Americans for mucking about somewhere.

 I recently found your bottle while taking a scenic walk on the beach, Biggelsworth was quoted as saying by the East Hampton Star newspaper on Thursday.

 While you may consider this some profound experiment on the path and speed of oceanic currents, I have another name for it: litter, he wrote in a letter.

 If you wish to foul your own nest all well and good, but please refrain in future from fouling mine, Biggelsworth added. The newspaper reported that Bennett was in the habit of putting messages in bottles and tossing them into the sea.

 Paris trove

 Los Angeles (AP): Paris Hiltons 

 diaries, along with photos of her in various stages of undress, 

 are among a trove of the celebutantes personal affects 

 that have found their way into the hands of a broker aiming 

 to sell them. David Hans Schmidt, known for handling deals 

 involving celebrity porn, is trying to auction off the Hilton 

 belongings, which had been locked away in a Los Angeles-area 

 locker until a few months ago. The pricetag? $20 million.

 Truce halts Lebanon fighting

 Beirut, Aug. 14 (Reuters): Heavy fighting in southern Lebanon stopped abruptly today after a UN-brokered truce came into effect, but the shooting of two Hizbollah guerrillas by Israeli soldiers underlined the fragility of the calm.

 Security sources in south Lebanon said Israeli air strikes and artillery fire continued until just a few minutes before the truce took effect at 0500 GMT. Then there was silence.

 The Israeli army said soldiers shot dead a Hizbollah fighter in southern Lebanon after he opened fire on them, the first casualty since the truce started. 

 Thousands of Lebanese displaced by five weeks of fighting headed south towards their homes, choking bomb-damaged roads with their cars in spite of a warning from Israel not to return to the area. Im so excited to see my home, said Sanaa Ayyad, carrying a baby while two young boys followed her.

 Id heard news it was completely destroyed, but even if theres one room intact, I will stay there with my children.

 In northern Israel, soldiers coming out of Lebanon were greeted with hugs and handshakes by their comrades.

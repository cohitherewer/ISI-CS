 Tehran to fingerprint Americans

 Tehran, 

 Dec. 3 (AFP): US citizens wishing to enter Iran 

 are to be fingerprinted on arrival after the republics 

 hardline vetting body approved a parliamentary bill backing 

 the move, Iranian media reported today.

 The green light from the guardians council, which has the power to veto parliamentary legislation, came despite opposition from President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who has expressed concern the move could offend US travellers.

 The council approved an adopted bill (by parliament) to fingerprint US visitors entering the country, and thus the government is obliged to carry it out, guardians council spokesman Abbas Ali Kadkhodaei was quoted as saying in the hardline newspaper Jomhuri Eslami. 

 After the approval of any bill by the council it becomes an effective law.

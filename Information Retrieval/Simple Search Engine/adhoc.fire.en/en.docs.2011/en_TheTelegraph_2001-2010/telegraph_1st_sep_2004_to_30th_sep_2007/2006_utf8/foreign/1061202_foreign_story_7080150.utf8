 Spy poison found in contact

 London, Dec. 1 (Reuters): British scientists probing the death of Alexander Litvinenko today said a second man had been poisoned by the same radiation that killed the former Russian spy.

 Media reports said the man was Mario Scaramella, an Italian contact whom Litvinenko met at a London sushi restaurant on November 1, the day he fell ill.

 One further person who was in direct contact with Mr Litvinenko has been found to have a significant quantity of polonium 210 in their body. This is being investigated further in hospital, a spokesman for the Health Protection Agency said.

 Police and health authorities declined to confirm the man was Scaramella. Polonium 210 is the radioactive isotope that poisoned Litvinenko, who accuses President Vladimir Putin of ordering his killing. A post-mortem was carried out on Litvinenko today.

 Scaramella, who describes himself as a security consultant, said last week he had met Litvinenko to show him emails from a mutual source warning both their lives may be in danger. He said Litvinenko told him not to worry.

 British media reported today that scientists at the countrys Atomic Weapons Establishment had traced the source of the polonium to a nuclear power plant in Russia. 

 The head of Russias state atomic energy agency said Russia produces only 8 grams of polonium 210 a month. He said all goes to US companies through a single authorised supplier.

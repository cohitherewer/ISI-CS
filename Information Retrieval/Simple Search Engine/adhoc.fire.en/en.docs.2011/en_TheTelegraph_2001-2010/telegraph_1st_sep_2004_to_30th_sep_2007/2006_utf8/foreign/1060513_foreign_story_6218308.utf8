 Bush in phone-snoop storm

 Bush: Who called?

 Washington, May 12: President Bush faced new and potentially damaging allegations about the secret surveillance of Americans last night after reports that his administration has covertly collected domestic phone records of tens of millions of citizens.

 The report provoked outrage from Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill.

 In a sign of how seriously the White House viewed the potential fallout, Bush appeared on television to read a statement in which he did not deny the allegations, but insisted that his administration had not broken any laws.

 A report in the newspaper USA Today, which claimed that since the 9/11 attacks the National Security Agency (NSA) has secretly collected the records of billions of domestic calls, also cast doubt on the confirmation prospects for General Michael Hayden, Bushs choice to head the CIA.

 General Hayden was head of the NSA between 1999 and 2005 and would have overseen the call-tracking programme. Meetings that General Hayden had scheduled for yesterday with the Republican senators Rick Santorum and Lisa Murkowski ahead of his confirmation hearings on Tuesday were apruptly cancelled. 

 According to the newspaper report, the NSA used data secretly handed over by the countrys three largest phone companies ? AT amp;T, Verizon and BellSouth ? to try to build a database of every call made within the US ? the largest database ever assembled anywhere in the world. 

 The programme does not involve the NSA listening to or recording conversations but the spy agency is using the millions of phone numbers handed over ? personal, business and mobile phone records ? to look for any calling patterns to help detect terrorist activity.

 The programme is significantly different from and potentially far more damaging politically than the secret, warrantless wiretapping programme revealed in December. That involved monitoring calls and e-mails in which one party was abroad. Polls consistently showed that a significant majority of Americans backed Bush on that because they believed it specifically targeted terror suspects.

 Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster, said: There is a very fine line between national security and personal oppression. The public is prepared to accept a degree of intelligence intervention but this may have crossed the line. I think a majority of Americans will be opposed to this.

Patrick Leahy, a Democrat, Senate Judiciary Committee, 

said: Are you telling me that tens of millions of Americans are involved 

with al Qaida? These are...Americans who are not suspected of anything ? where 

does it stop?

 No Castro as House meets 

 Havana, Dec. 22 (Reuters): Cubas National Assembly began its year-end session today without ailing leader Fidel Castro, who was last seen in public on July 26.

 The seat usually used by the 80-year-old Castro was empty at the start of the meeting in Havanas convention centre. The meeting was led by brother Raul Castro and other members of the islands Communist Party leadership.

 Raul Castro, 75, took over the government temporarily on July 31 when his brother relinquished power for the first time since the 1959 revolution.

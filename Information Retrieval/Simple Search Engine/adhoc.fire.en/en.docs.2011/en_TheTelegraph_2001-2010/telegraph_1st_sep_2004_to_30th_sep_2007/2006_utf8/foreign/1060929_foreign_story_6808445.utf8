 Moms puff can give baby asthma

 London, Sept. 28 (Reuters): Smoking during pregnancy can affect the babys immune system which may explain why asthma and respiratory problems are more common in children whose mothers smoke, Australian scientists said.

 Babies of smokers are more likely to suffer from respiratory infections than children of non-smokers.

 The scientists said it may be due to changes to biological receptors in the babys immune system.

 This is the first prospective study to examine the effect of smoking during pregnancy in terms of these aspects of newborn innate immune function, said Paul Noakes of the University of Western Australia in Perth.

 The study, published in the European Respiratory Journal, compared 60 newborns whose mothers had smoked during pregnancy and 62 born to non-smokers.

 In the babies of mothers who smoked, the researchers found impaired production of interleukin-6 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha.

 They said foetal exposure to cigarette smoke is associated with changes that both weaken innate immune defences and slow the development of the acquired immune system.

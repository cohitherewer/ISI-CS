The woman, who spoke little English and was travelling to Mexico, put the infant in a plastic bin used to hold loose carry-on items for security scanning at the busy airport on Saturday morning. Security screeners saw the baby as it started to pass through, pulled the bin out, and immediately sought medical assistance for the child.

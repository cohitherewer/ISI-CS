The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Dictators duplicates

 Beijing, Oct. 1: The eccentric North Korean dictator Kim Jong-il has hired doubles tocarry out his more mundane tasks, according to South Korean intelligence officials, reports The Daily Telegraph.

 While Kim himself attends major state occasions, two men stand in for him for more routine visits to tractor factories or farms.

 They are the spitting image of Kim the same age, same height andwith the same bouffant hairstyle and pot belly, a South Korean news agency quoted an intelligence official as saying. They are trained to behave like him and even had plastic surgery to enhance the resemblance.

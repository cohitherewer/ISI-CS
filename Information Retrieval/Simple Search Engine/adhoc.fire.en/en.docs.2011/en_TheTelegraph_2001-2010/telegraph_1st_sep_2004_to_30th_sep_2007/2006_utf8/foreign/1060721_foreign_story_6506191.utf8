 Hollywood for Hillary

 Clinton: Tinsel magic

 Washington, July 20 (AP): Just as Hollywood was good to her husband, the capital of the film industry is being good to Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton.

 Top stars such as Tom Hanks, Jennifer Lopez and Owen Wilson donated to the New York Senator in recent months, generating the kind of cash usually associated with a major box office opening or a potential presidential bid ? perhaps in 2008.

 Clinton, who does not face much of a challenge in her re-election but is considered by many to be a front-runner for the 2008 presidential race, received $4,200 from Hanks and his wife, Rita Wilson. The donations were made public yesterday, with more than 4,000 pages of paperwork.

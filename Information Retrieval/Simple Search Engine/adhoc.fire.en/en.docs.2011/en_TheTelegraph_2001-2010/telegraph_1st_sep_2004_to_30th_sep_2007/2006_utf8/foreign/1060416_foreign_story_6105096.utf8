 UK writer Spark dead

 Spark: Ascerbic

 Rome, April 15 (Reuters): Ascerbic Scottish-born novelist Muriel Spark, best known for her book The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, has died in Italy at the age of 88 and was buried in Tuscany today.

 She was very open. Both fascinating and down-to-earth at the same time. Her loss will be very difficult to overcome, Massimiliano Dindalini, the mayor of the little Italian town where she lived, said.

 Spark wrote 24 novels, several short stories and three well-received biographies during her long career.

 But she shot to fame with her 1962 fictional work The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, a tense novel about a young teacher stirring thoughts of emancipation at an Edinburgh girls school in staid society between the two world wars.

 A self-styled experimentalist, she was hailed as being far ahead of her time both in her style of writing and the subjects she chose.

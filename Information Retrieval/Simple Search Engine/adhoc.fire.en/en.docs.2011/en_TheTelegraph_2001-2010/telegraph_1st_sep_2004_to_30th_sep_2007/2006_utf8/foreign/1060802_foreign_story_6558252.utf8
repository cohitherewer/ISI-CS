 Tigers shell strategic harbour, target ship

 Colombo, 

 Aug. 1 (Reuters): Tamil Tiger rebels shelled a 

 strategic harbour in eastern Sri Lanka today and tried to 

 sink a transporter ship with 850 troops aboard, the military 

 said, killing four sailors as a low intensity war spiralled.

 The military said Tiger artillery, mortar launchers and gunboats attacked a ship entering Trincomalee port, north of where troops are battling to secure a rebel-held sluice gate in a dispute that has prompted the worst and longest violence since a 2002 truce.

 The navy said three small Sea Tiger craft were sunk and three more were damaged, including explosives-packed speedboats piloted by suicide bombers. 

 As our passenger ship carrying 854 soldiers was entering the harbour, she was fired on by LTTE mortars and artillery, a military spokesman said. She is now safely in harbour.

 The attack came as the battle front for control over a water sluice in the district widened, and air force jets bombed rebel positions for a seventh consecutive day.

 The government accused the LTTE of attempted ethnic cleansing through cutting off the water supply to some 50,000 people, but said they were still committed to a fading 2002 ceasefire. The pro-rebel website (www.tamilnet.com) reported a naval fast attack boat was sunk, the naval headquarters were hit and at least eight navy sailors were killed.

 The army said a soldier was also killed as troops edged towards the disputed sluice gate in their first offensive since the ceasefire. 

 Twenty-seven soldiers and one civilian bus driver died in action yesterday in the area. Army sources said the troops were having to cross open ground under mortar fire.

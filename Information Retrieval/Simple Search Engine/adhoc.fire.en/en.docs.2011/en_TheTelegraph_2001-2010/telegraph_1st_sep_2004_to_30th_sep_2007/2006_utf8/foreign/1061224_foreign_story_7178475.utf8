The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Renovation approved

 United Nations, Dec. 23 (Reuters): The UN General Assembly today approved a top-to-bottom renovation of its landmark Manhattan headquarters building that is expected to take seven years to complete at a cost of $1.9 billion.

 The UN compound is one of New Yorks most popular tourist destinations. The main building is a 39-storey aluminum, glass and marble tower that houses the UN secretariat. But after 54 years, its roof leaks, it is riddled with asbestos and it lacks fire detectors, a sprinkler system or other emergency safety devices.

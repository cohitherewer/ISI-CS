 Golden showers scald Ricky

 Martin: Outraged

 Miami, Jan. 14 (AFP): Latin crooner Ricky Martin has expressed outrage over controversy that emerged after he told a leading us music magazine he enjoyed golden showers ? the act of urinating on another person.

 The pop star was particularly upset by statements by conservative leaders in his native Puerto Rico, who said he should give up his charitable foundation that helps deprived children.

 I love giving the golden shower, he told Blender magazine earlier. Ive done it before in the shower. Its like so sexy, you know, the temperature of your body and the shower water is very different.

 But in a statement posted on his web page, he said he never thought his comments would lead us to an absurd political discussion that has become sensationalist. 

 I demand respect for my foundation and our work, said Martin, who is best known for his 1999 hit Livin la Vida Loca.

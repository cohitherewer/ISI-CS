 Castro not gravely ill, says Cuba

 Havana, Dec. 18 (Reuters): Fidel Castro is not terminally ill and would make a public appearance shortly, but is unlikely to return to governing Cuba on a day-to-day basis, Cuban government officials told a visiting delegation of members of the US Congress.

 The party line is that Fidel is coming back. He does not have cancer, Representative Jane Harman said yesterday. But Representative William Delahunt, a Massachusetts Democrat and one of the leaders of the delegation, said that he had concluded after discussions with officials that the 80-year-old Cuban leader, who has undergone intestinal surgery, would not return to running his country on a day-to-day basis.

 The Cubans were empathetic, and I believe them, that Fidel does not have cancer and that the illness he does have is not terminal, Delahunt said. Castro, who has not been seen in public since July 26, was planning to make a public appearance shortly, and if he did resume a political role, it would probably be setting broad policy, Delahunt said.

 The 10-member US congressional delegation, was the largest to go to Cuba since Castros 1959 revolution.

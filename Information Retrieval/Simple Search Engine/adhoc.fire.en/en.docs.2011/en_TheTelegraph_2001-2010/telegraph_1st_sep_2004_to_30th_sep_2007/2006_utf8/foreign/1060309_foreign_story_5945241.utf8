 Flu kills girl in China, toll 10

 Beijing, March 8 (Reuters): A nine-year-old girl has died of bird flu in China, state media said today, as the UN stepped up efforts to battle the rapidly spreading virus.

 The girl, Chinas 10th known death from bird flu, died on Monday night in the eastern province of Zhejiang, the official Xinhua news agency said. Her death comes days after the government confirmed that a 32-year-old man had died from the H5N1 virus in the southern province of Guangdong, near Hong Kong, triggering alarm there.

 The epidemic situation is very severe. Right now is spring, when there is a high chance of bird flu outbreaks due to the frequent movement of migratory birds. This epidemic has not been effectively controlled worldwide, Chinas deputy agriculture minister Yin Chengjie said.

 The virus has spread rapidly since the beginning of February, killing birds in more than 15 new countries as it moves deeper into Europe and Africa. Albania today confirmed its first case of H5N1 in a chicken found in the southern Sarande coastal region, close to the border with Greece.

 Nigeria said yesterday that highly pathogenic bird flu had spread to three new states, including an outbreak in Port Harcourt, the main city in the oil-producing Niger Delta.

 The World Health Organisation, confirming the Chinese girls death, said bird flu has infected 175 people, killing 96 of them since 2003.

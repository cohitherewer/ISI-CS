 London, Sept. 18: Connie Fisher, an unknown 23-year-old who won through a two-month television talent show to win the lead part of Maria in the forthcoming West End version of The Sound of Music, has stunned its producers by asking to sing in every single performance.

 Fisher, a theatre school graduate but making ends meet by working in a call centre, has made only one professional stage appearance in a pantomime last Christmas in Pembrokeshire, where she lives.

 She swept to victory polling a majority of the viewers two million votes and winning a 3,000-a-week six-month contract to star in the show at the end of BBCs How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria? on Saturday night. Close to tears, she declared that it was a dream come true.

 But she has left Andrew Lloyd Webber and David Ian, the producers of the 4 million show which opens in November, with another problem. Lord Lloyd-Webber told The Daily Telegraph yesterday: I sat down with Connie after she had won and she said to me unequivocally that she wants to do all eight shows every week.

 Prompting allegations that the talent show was a fix, the producers had already quietly hired 23-year-old Emma Williams, a proven performer who has appeared in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, to appear twice a week as Maria von Trapp in The Sound of Music.

 Sceptics have claimed that Fisher, with no experience of the physical and vocal demands of appearing night after night on a West End stage, may be relegated to make just occasional appearances, with Williams playing Maria in the bulk of the performances.

 Lord Lloyd-Webber, who agreed to the talent show after failing to persuade the Hollywood star Scarlett Johansson to play Maria, vigorously denied this yesterday.

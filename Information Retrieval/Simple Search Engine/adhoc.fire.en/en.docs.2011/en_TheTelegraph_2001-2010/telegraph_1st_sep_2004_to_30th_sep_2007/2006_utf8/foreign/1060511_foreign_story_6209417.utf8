 Dr Zhivago returns with a Russian flavour

 - Most 

 of laras themes gone

 Lara is a redhead not a blonde, Yuris balalaika is nowhere to be seen and the Zhivago dacha has been stripped of its onion-shaped domes.

 When Russians turn on their television sets to watch the first ever on-screen version of Dr Zhivago in their own language, many of the themes from Sir David Leans interpretation of Boris Pasternaks great love epic will be gone.

 Among Russias many Pasternak fans, that will be cause for rejoicing. The 1965 Oscar-winning hit, starring Omar Sharif as Zhivago and Julie Christie as Lara, helped mould the view of Russia for millions in the West.

 But in Russia itself its perceived lack of authenticity served to irritate, even if samizdat, or self-published, copies of the banned film were much sought after and eagerly viewed.

 I saw Leans film a long time ago and remember my ambivalent feelings, said Oleg Yankovsky, who in the new series plays Viktor Komarovsky, Laras lustful suitor, whom Lara shoots in the new series. 

 On the one hand, it was forbidden fruit. On the other it left a wrong aftertaste, like a Russian child used to apples and pears suddenly eating a Kiwi.

 Even when it was banned in Soviet times, Russians could recite most of Zhivagos Lara poems by heart. So it seems extraordinary that, until now, the only two on-screen versions of the 1957 novel have both been western productions.

 For Doctor Zhivagos new director, Alexander Proshkin, the new series is the fulfilment of a long-held ambition, and the opportunity to correct a few of the misconceptions created by the western version. Lean made a wonderful film and I dare say most people only know about the novel thanks to it, he said. But Lean produced a Zhivago that has very little to do with Russia or with Pasternak. 

 Our adaptation does not just focus on the melodramatic aspects, but strives to answer different questions: Who are we? Where are we from? Where are we heading? In a nutshell, the film is about how to survive in Russia, how to remain true to oneself, to keep ones integrity. It is about love as well as the motherland.

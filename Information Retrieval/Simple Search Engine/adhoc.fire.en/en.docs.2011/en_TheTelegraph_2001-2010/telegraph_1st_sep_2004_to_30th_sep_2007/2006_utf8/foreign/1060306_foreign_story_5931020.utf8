 From Tehrans mouth: how we duped the West

 PHILIP SHERWELL 

 Washington, March 5: The man who for two years led Irans nuclear negotiations has laid out in unprecedented detail how the regime took advantage of talks with Britain, France and Germany to forge ahead with its secret atomic programme. 

 In a speech to a closed meeting of leading Islamic clerics and academics, Hassan Rowhani, who headed talks with the so-called EU3 until last year, revealed how Tehran played for time and tried to dupe the West after its secret nuclear programme was uncovered by the Iranian opposition in 2002. 

 He boasted that while talks were on in Tehran, Iran was able to complete the installation of equipment for conversion of yellowcake ? a key stage in the nuclear fuel process ? at its Isfahan plant but at the same time convince European diplomats that nothing was afoot. 

 From the outset, the Americans kept telling the Europeans, The Iranians are lying and deceiving you and they have not told you everything. The Europeans used to respond, We trust them, Rowhani said. 

 Revelation of Rowhanis remarks comes at an awkward moment for the Iranian government, ahead of a meeting tomorrow of the UNs atomic watchdog, which must make a fresh assessment of Irans banned nuclear operations. 

 The verdict of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is the final step before Irans case is passed to the UN Security Council, where sanctions may be considered. 

 In his address to the Supreme Council of Cultural Revolution, Rowhani appears to have been seeking to rebut criticism from hardliners that he gave too much ground in talks with the European troika. 

 The contents of the speech were published in a regime journal that circulates among the ruling elite. 

 He told his audience: When we were negotiating with the Europeans in Tehran we were still installing some of the equipment at the Isfahan site. 

 There was plenty of work to be done to complete the site and finish the work there. In reality, by creating a tame situation, we could finish Isfahan. 

 America and its European allies believe that Iran is clandestinely developing an atomic bomb but Tehran insists it is merely seeking nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. 

 Irans negotiating team engaged in a last-ditch attempt last week to head off Security Council involvement. 

 In January the regime removed IAEA seals on sensitive nuclear equipment and last month it resumed banned uranium enrichment. 

 Iran is trying to win support from Russia, which opposes any UN sanctions, having unsuccessfully tried to persuade European leaders to give them more time. 

 Against this backdrop, Rowhanis surprisingly candid comments on Irans record of obfuscation and delay are illuminating. 

 He described the regimes quandary in September 2003 when the IAEA had demanded a complete picture of its nuclear activities. 

 The dilemma was if we offered a complete picture, the picture itself could lead us to the UN Security Council, he said. 

 And not providing a complete picture would also be a violation of the resolution and we could have been referred to the Security Council.

 Ultimate club for the rich

 - Floating palaces amp; the most exclusive venues

 London, Jan. 8: It is the ultimate club for the seriously rich. Members cruise in the most luxurious yachts, fly in sleek private jets and stay at sumptuous villas in the most chic parts of the Mediterranean, Caribbean and the US. 

 Membership opens doors at some of the most prestigious yachting, polo and country clubs ? normally with waiting lists of up to eight years ? including the Guards Polo Club at Windsor, Europes most exclusive venue for the sport. 

 The club is the latest venture of the Latsis Group, the shipping, oil, banking and property empire run by the reclusive Spiro Latsis, who took over the company when his father, John, the Greek shipping billionaire, died three years ago aged 92. The family fortune is estimated to be ?2.4 billion. 

 It is not known whether the British Royal Family has signed up but John Latsis was a friend of the Royal Family and the Prince of Wales has been a frequent guest on board his 400-ft superyacht, the Alexander, which will be available for PrivatSea members. 

 The affluent elite who have signed up, include royalty, heads of state, senior politicians, entrepreneurs, and rock stars. Some are household names; other have accumulated vast wealth quietly and discreetly. Most insist on anonymity but the Sunday Telegraph has learnt that Prince Albert of Monaco, Yves Piaget, the Swiss watches and jewellery tycoon, and the family of Victor Pastor, the Monaco property magnate, are among the first members. Prospective members could include the likes of the actor, Sean Connery, who has in the past used one of the 20 yachts ? worth up to ?200 million each. 

 These lavishly-fitted boats are furnished with toys, including mini-submarines, helicopters, jetskis and recording studios. Every whim is catered for and guests security and privacy are paramount. 

 Such pampering does not, however, come cheap. The joining fee for the new club, called, in a rather painful pun, PrivatSea, is ?12,000. Members then choose one of four membership levels, costing from ?100,000 to ?800,000. 

 Applicants for membership of PrivatSea have to be seriously rich. Old money and new money are welcome, but money alone is not enough, according to Phillipe Lamblin, the chief executive. 

 We have a strict screening process, he said. We need to know not only the extent of their wealth but where it came from. We dont want to be stuffy or pompous, but we want the right people. 

 Anybody with a criminal background, or a negative reputation, and celebrities known for trashing hotel rooms, illegal activities such as drug-taking, and even partying hard, would be turned down. 

 Several applications have already been rejected, including one from an American rap star. A PrivatSea spokesman said Premiership footballers, despite earning up to ?120,000 a week, and other high-earning sporting figures, would be considered only on merit. 

 The membership will be limited to 100, the club says, even when the number of yachts is doubled to 40. Some of its boats are owned by the Latsis Group, while others are leased from private individuals and brokers. 

 The club offers a chance for the rich to parade their status without actually buying a superyacht, which costs a minimum of ?50 million.

 The clubs biggest yacht ? and the fourth biggest in the world ? is the Alexander. It has 41 state rooms and accommodates 60 guests and 60 crew. 

 Connery and Frank Sinatra in the past used the 180-ft Revelation, which takes members on holiday expeditions to places such as Alaska. 

 The club offers a chance for the rich to parade their status without actually buying a superyacht, which costs a minimum of ?50 million. However, a tiny elite ? the mega-rich ? will always want to own the ultimate status symbol, happy to pay running costs of up to ?12 million a year. 

 Roman Abramovich, the Russian oil billionaire and owner of Chelsea Football Club, worth ?7.5 billion, and Paul Allen, the co-founder of Microsoft, worth ?14 billion, are on another level quot;, said Mr Lamblin. quot;They are in a rich club of their very own. quot;

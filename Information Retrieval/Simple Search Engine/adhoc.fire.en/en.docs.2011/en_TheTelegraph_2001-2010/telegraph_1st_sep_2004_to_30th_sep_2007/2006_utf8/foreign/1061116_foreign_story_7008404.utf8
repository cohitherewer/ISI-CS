 UK youths cut Sikh teens hair

 London, Nov. 15 (Reuters): A gang of youths cut the hair of a teenage Sikh boy during a racist attack in Edinburgh, police said today.

 The 15-year-old boy was walking through a park last evening when four white youths subjected him to a tirade of racial abuse, Lothian and Borders police said.

 They then attacked him, punching and kicking him to the ground, loosening a bandana he was wearing around his head. The youths then cut his hair before running away.

 Sikh men do not cut their hair, for religious reasons.

 This was an extremely distressing attack on a young member of our community, who has been left traumatised by this incident, a police spokesman said.

 Police forces across Britain say there has been an increase in attacks on ethnic minorities since last years suicide bomb attacks in London carried out by four British Islamists.

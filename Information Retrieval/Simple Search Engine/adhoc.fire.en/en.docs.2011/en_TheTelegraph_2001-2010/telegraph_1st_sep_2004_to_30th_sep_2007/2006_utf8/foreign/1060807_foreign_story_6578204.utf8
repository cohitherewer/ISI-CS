 Tigers cry war after shelling

 Trincomalee, Aug. 6 (Reuters): Sri Lankan rebels today said that government shelling of rebel territory amounted to a declaration of war, but they had not yet decided whether to retaliate.

 The Tigers political wing leader said they had not yet retaliated to the heaviest artillery and rocket fire since fighting broke out 12 days ago, but may if shelling continued.

 We consider this a declaration of war and strongly condemn the attitude of the government, S.P. Thamilselvan said through a translator via satellite phone from the northern rebel stronghold of Kilinochchi.

 We may have to take a defensive position if the shelling continues. It is not decided yet, he added. He said there was still space for discussion while Norways special peace envoy Jon Hanssen-Bauer was in Kilinochchi.

 The rebel statement came the same day that 15 local aid workers helping with relief after the 2004 tsunami were found executed in a town caught up in fighting.

 Well over 800 people have been killed so far this year in escalating attacks and military clashes and dozens more since the fighting intensified two weeks ago.

 The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) are furious at President Mahinda Rajapakses rejection of their demand for a separate homeland for ethnic Tamils in the north and east. The government insists it is committed to the 2002 truce, but analysts fear more clashes are in store.

 Sri Lankan artillery pounded Tamil Tiger territory hours after the rebels offered to give in to a key government demand to open a sluice gate providing water to government territory. 

 The closure of the gate last month prompted the first ground fighting since the 2002 ceasefire.

 The Tigers said they would re-open it but as the head of the unarmed Nordic-staffed ceasefire monitoring mission, retired Swedish Major General Ulf Henricsson, headed towards the sluice south of Trincomalee, army artillery opened fire.

 (The government) have the information that the LTTE has made this offer, said Tommy Lekenmyr, chief of staff for the Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission. It is quite obvious they are not interested in water. They are interested in something else. We will blame this on the government.

 The political situation remains deadlocked. The government said the Tigers must leave the area of the sluice gate, which officially lies in army territory but which military sources said was in an area effectively controlled by the rebels.

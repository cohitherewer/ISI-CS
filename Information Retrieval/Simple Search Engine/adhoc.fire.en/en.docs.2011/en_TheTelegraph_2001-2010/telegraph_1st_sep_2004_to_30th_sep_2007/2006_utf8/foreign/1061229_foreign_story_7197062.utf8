 Britain sop for good students

 LIZ LIGHTFOOT

 London, Dec. 29: The brightest 800,000 pupils in England are to have vouchers to spend on extra lessons as part of a national talent search that starts next week.

 Every secondary and primary school will be told to supply the names of 10 per cent of their pupils who best meet the new criteria for the gifted and talented programme when they fill in the January schools census.

 Each pupil on the scheme will be given credits to buy a range of additional courses designed to push them further. This includes weekend or summer schools at universities, in which academics are paid to provide master-classes in particular subjects. The scheme, to meet the needs of the brightest of the eight-million state school population, is being driven by Lord Adonis, the schools minister.

 It will be delivered by the Centre for British Teachers (CFBT), a non-profit education company that won a government contract to run the programme this month. At present, only the five per cent of pupils achieving the best marks in national curriculum tests for 11-year-olds are eligible for funding under a gifted and talented programme. 

 But The Daily Telegraph can disclose that the new project will widen its scope considerably, picking out the brightest 10 per cent in each school, regardless of how many children reach the present criteria. 

 The scheme also introduces to schools for the first time the concept of vouchers as part of an education market in which pupils are the consumers and decide how and what they want to learn. It follows a decision by the Tories last month to drop plans for a full-blown voucher, in which parents would get 5,000 a year to spend at the school of their choice state or private.

 The new scheme reflects the Governments disappointment with the National Academy of Gifted and Talented Youth for which pupils have to prove they are in the top five per cent in order to gain membership and access to its activities.

 About 30 per cent of secondary schools have failed to nominate any pupil to the academy, with many teachers ideologically opposed to singling out gifted children for special help.

 Research shows that most participants come from better-off families who can afford fares and fees for weekend and summer schools.

 The Department for Education already has the names of the pupils achieving the highest raw scores in the tests for maths and English they take in the final year of primary school and wrote to head teachers last July identifying them by name with a request that their talents be nurtured.

 However, some inner city comprehensives have only one or two in the category and Lord Adonis wants all schools to widen the gifted category to take in the top 10 per cent of each year group.

 Initial funding of 65 million will be used to start the credit system. Further money will come from the 930 million the Government is investing in quot;personalised learning quot;, where head teachers get extra money to tailor classes to fit individual pupils needs.

 Under the new programme, each pupil will initially receive 151 credits. They will have no monetary value at first but act as vouchers with which pupils will be able to buy the extra lessons. In the first year, CfBT will invite companies, independent schools, universities or learned bodies to provide activities under contract and pay them an agreed fee.

 It will award each activity a number of credits so pupils may, for example, be able to buy a summer school place for 100 credits, an evening on-line course for 50 credits or a Saturday morning course in Mandarin for 80 credits. They may even be able to buy education programmes drawn up by Nasa, the US space agency, which has web-based courses linked to the shuttle programme on science, technology, engineering and maths.

 The CfBT said it would monitor the system to see which activities were the most popular and worthy of funding in future years.

 Lord Adonis said schools and local authorities should target pupils at risk of failing to fulfil their potential.

 quot;All schools should identify their full gifted and talented population in the forthcoming school census [Jan 2007], quot; he said. quot;We have also just published new summary guidance on identification to help schools with this process.

 quot;The national register set up earlier this year will enable thousands more gifted and talented children to be identified, especially late developers and those underachieving because of social disadvantage. This register will ensure they are identified early and get the appropriate learning opportunities inside and outside school. quot;

 Tim Emmett, the development director for CfBT, said there would be an emphasis on identifying bright children from disadvantaged backgrounds failing to reach their potential, either for school or family reasons. But the scheme would also answer criticism from middle-class parents that state schools failed to nurture the most able.

 quot;No one is pretending that the top 10 per cent of Kendrick Girls Grammar School in Reading are the same as the top 10 per cent of pupils at Lilian Baylis comprehensive in Lambeth, quot; said Mr Emmett. quot;But there will be children in Lambeth who have got something which needs to be cultivated and encouraged and at the moment it is just not happening in too many schools.

 quot;The Government is seeing this as part of school improvement rather than a lifeboat for a few bright children. If you can raise the meter for 10 per cent of children in a school you can do it for the other 90 per cent as well. quot;

 Sir Cyril Taylor, the chairman of the Specialist Schools and Academies Trust, is the driving force behind the National Talent Register, the existing table of the top five per cent with the best raw scores for maths and English.

 The register will continue in tandem with the new programme which Sir Cyril said, quot;must not detract attention quot; from the original scheme.

 However, he admitted it was quot;a disgrace quot; that some schools, including some specialist colleges within his organisation, failed to participate in the existing scheme on the grounds that it was elitist.

 quot;Middle-class families have as much to gain because making sure you identify and nurture the brightest students to ensure they get top A-level grades is fairer than trying to force universities to apply admission quotas for comprehensive school children. quot;

 Tigers on EU terror list

 - LTTE assets frozen, diplomatic disaster for group

 Brussels, May 30 (Reuters): The EU listed Sri Lankas rebel LTTE as a banned terrorist organisation today amid a sharp escalation in clashes between it and the military, EU diplomats said.

 One of the consequences is the freezing of the (groups) assets, an envoy said of the decision taken at a regular meeting of EU ministers in Brussels. The EU freeze on assets could hurt the war chest of the Tigers, which have used past trips to Europe during peace talks to raise funds from expatriate Tamils.

 More generally, the ban is a diplomatic slap in the face for the group, which has sought to project an image abroad as viable leaders of a de facto state they want recognised as a separate homeland for ethnic Tamils in the islands north and east.

 The US, Canada and Britain have already listed the Tamil Tigers as a terrorist group. The EU imposed a travel ban on the groups cadres last September and said then it was considering banning it for use of violence and terrorism.

 The Tigers pulled out of peace talks aimed at ending the islands two-decade civil war last month. They have said in recent days an EU ban would only exacerbate the conditions of war and could deter them from resuming peace negotiations.

 More than 280 soldiers, police, civilians and rebels have been killed in attacks from suicide bombings to naval clashes since February in what monitors of a 2002 truce and the Tigers themselves now call a low intensity war.

 Frustration among Sri Lankans is palpable as many fear a return to a full-scale war that killed more than 64,000 people before the ceasefire and displaced hundreds of thousands more.

 I dont think the ban is going to achieve very much, said Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu, an analyst with the Colombo-based Centre for Policy Alternatives. I cant see any way out of ... moving towards large-scale hostilities.

 How much more pain can we take? How many more years are we going to go on? asked leading local artist Anoma Wijewardene, whose lost one of the contributors to her latest exhibition.

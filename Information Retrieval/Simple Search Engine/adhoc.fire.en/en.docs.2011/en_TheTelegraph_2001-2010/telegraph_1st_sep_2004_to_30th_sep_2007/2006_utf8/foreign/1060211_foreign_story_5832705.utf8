 Storm over Yahoo aid to China

 Washington/San Francisco, Feb. 10 (Reuters): US Internet companies faced bipartisan criticism in the Congress yesterday amid a rising controversy over Yahoo Incs alleged role in the Chinese governments imprisonment of a second dissident.

 I dont like any American company ratting out a citizen for speaking out against their government, Representative Tim Ryan, an Ohio Democrat and member of the House Human Rights Subcommittee, said.

 This is the tip of the iceberg of a very oppressive regime that we have almost become accustomed to in America, said Representative Chris Smith, a Republican.

 The storm over western media companies compliance with Chinese policies comes before a hearing next week by Smiths committee. Lawmakers from both parties are expected to grill representatives from Yahoo, Google Inc, Microsoft Corp and Cisco Systems Inc.

 Google came under fire last month for bowing to Chinese government pressure to block politically sensitive terms on its new Chinese site. Microsoft has also angered human rights activists by blocking the blog of a critic of the Beijing government.

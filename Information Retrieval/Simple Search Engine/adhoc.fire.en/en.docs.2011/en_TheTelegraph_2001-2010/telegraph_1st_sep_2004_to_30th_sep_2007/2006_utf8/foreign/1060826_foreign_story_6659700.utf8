 Ship to unload aid for Jaffna

 Colombo, Aug. 25 (Reuters): The first aid ship to break a two week siege of Sri Lankas northern Jaffna peninsula prepared to unload today, while another Red Cross-flagged vessel left port to evacuate foreign nationals.

 The aid ship is carrying over 1,000 tonnes of rice, lentils and some tinned food from the UN World Food Programme. Most shops on the Jaffna peninsula have run out of food and some of its half-a-million people are down to one meal a day.

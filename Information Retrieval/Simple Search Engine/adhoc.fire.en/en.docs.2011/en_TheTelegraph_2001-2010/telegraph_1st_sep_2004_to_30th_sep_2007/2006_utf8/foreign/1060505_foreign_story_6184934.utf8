 China church row worsens

 Vatican City, May 4 (Reuters): Pope Benedict said today Chinas appointment of two Catholic bishops without his blessing was a grave violation of religious freedom as a standoff with Beijing over control of church posts escalated.

 The bishops were consecrated this week despite Vatican opposition in what was seen as a a major setback for relations between the Holy See and China, which had appeared to be improving in recent years. The Holy Father learned the news with deep displeasure, the Vatican said in an unusually strongly worded statement. 

 It said the Vatican had information from China that bishops and priests there had come under strong pressure and threats to take part contrary to their conscience in the ordinations, which it branded as illegitimate.

 The Holy See reiterates the need to respect the freedom of the church and the autonomy of its institutions from any external interference, it said, adding that such unacceptable acts of violent and intolerable constraint should stop.

 The statement noted that church law prescribes automatic excommunication for the bishop consecrating the new prelate and the priest who agrees to be made a bishop without Vatican approval, meaning all four men would be punished.

 But when asked if they were now shut out of the church, Navarro-Valls said: That is something that we will think (about) afterwards, not at this moment. We still dont have all the information.

 He did not elaborate, but in Catholic moral teaching, someone who does not freely choose a certain course of action might not be fully responsible for it. The Vatican said the appointments did not help ties with China, which had thawed in recent years, raising expectations that diplomatic relations cut off in 1951 could be restored. Navarro-Valls said, however, the Vatican would continue to seek dialogue with Beijing.

 Sharon stable after surgery

 Jerusalem, Feb. 11 (Reuters): Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, comatose since a stroke last month, underwent emergency surgery to remove parts of a damaged intestine today and a hospital official said he was out of immediate danger.

 Shlomo Mor-Yosef, director of Hadassah Hospital, said that while the surgery went well, Sharons main problem remained his continuing state of unconsciousness and the dramatic event this morning will not help him recover and is not a good sign.

 Medical experts hold little hope for the 77-year-old leaders recovery after a massive brain haemorrhage on January 4. 

 He has been in a coma since the stroke.

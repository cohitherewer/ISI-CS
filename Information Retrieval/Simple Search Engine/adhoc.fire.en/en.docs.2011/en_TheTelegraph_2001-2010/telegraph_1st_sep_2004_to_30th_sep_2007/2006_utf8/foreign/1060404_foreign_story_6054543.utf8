 Kathmandu, April 3: In a strategic move, the Maoists announced a unilateral ceasefire within the Kathmandu valley starting from this evening.

 The announcement comes three days before the April 6 general strike in the valley called by the seven-party Opposition alliance which is spearheading the pro-democracy movement in Nepal.

 In a statement here this evening, the Maoist chairman Prachanda said that his party had taken the decision to cease all military activities in the capital keeping in view the requests made by the alliance and civil society groups. 

 He said the move was intended to expose the claims made by the royalist government that the Maoists were planning to infiltrate the protest rallies organised by the political forces.

 According to the rebel supremo, the truce will be in force until further notice.

 Prachanda said that his party would extend its full support to the general strike. He explained that his party was taking this step in accordance with the understanding reached with the alliance last month. 

 The Maoist leader appealed to the people of Nepal to rally behind the pro-democracy movement. 

 He cautioned against royalist government bid to stop the protests. The government is conspiring to unleash state terror against the peaceful movement being launched by the Opposition parties against the 14-month-old direct rule of the king, he said.

 The government dismissed the Maoist announcement as yet another attempt to force the government to slacken its pressure on the group.

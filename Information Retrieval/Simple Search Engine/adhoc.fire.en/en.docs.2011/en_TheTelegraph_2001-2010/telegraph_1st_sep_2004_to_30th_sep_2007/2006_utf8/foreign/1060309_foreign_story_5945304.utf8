 Scientist in Dolly denial

 AUSLAN CRAMB

 Prof. Ian Wilmut 

 and Dolly the sheep: Fresh twist 

 London, March 8: The man whose name is synonymous with the cloning of Dolly the sheep admitted yesterday that he was not responsible for the scientific breakthrough that made headline news around the world. 

 Prof. Ian Wilmut told a tribunal hearing in Edinburgh that he had a supervisory, although not trivial, role in the project. However, he did not develop the technology or carry out the experiments that led to the first clone of an adult animal from a single cell. 

 He added that he only appeared as the lead author on the paper that described the historic event because of a prior agreement with his colleague, Dr Keith Campbell. 

 Prof. Wilmut, formerly of the Roslin Institute outside Edinburgh, was giving evidence at an employment tribunal at which an Asian colleague is accusing him of racial harassment and bullying. Dr Prim Singh, 45, a molecular biologist, claims that Prof Wilmut tried to steal his ideas ? on work not related to Dolly ? and bullied him because of his ethnic origin. 

 Prof. Wilmut said his colleague Dr Campbell deserved 66 per cent of the credit for the work on Dolly the sheep. 

 The idea of freezing cells for use in cloning had been devised by Dr Campbell and the vital experiments had been carried out by a fellow scientist, Bill Ritchie.

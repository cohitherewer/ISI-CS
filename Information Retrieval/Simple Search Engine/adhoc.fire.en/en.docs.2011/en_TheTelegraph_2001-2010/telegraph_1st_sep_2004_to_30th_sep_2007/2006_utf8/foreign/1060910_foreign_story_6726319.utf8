 Pak nabs key Jaish militant

 Karachi, Sept. 9 (Reuters): Pakistani security forces arrested today an Islamist militant suspect who is wanted for several attacks and smuggling explosives used in bombings in the countrys biggest city, a security force spokesman said.

 Pakistan is a major US ally in the war on terror and has arrested hundreds of militants since the September 11, 2001, attacks on the US.

 The suspect, Mohammad Rizwan, was a member of the banned Jaish-e-Mohammad militant group, which the US has designated a terrorist group, said Captain Fazal Mehmood, a spokesman for paramilitary Pakistan Rangers.

 Rizwan was arrested in a shanty town on the outskirts of Karachi after a tip-off, Mehmood said.

 Rizwan was affiliated with Jaish-e-Mohammad and was involved in several heinous acts of sectarian terrorism. The provincial government had him on their most wanted list, he said.

 Rizwan had also been involved in smuggling weapons and explosives from the Afghan border to Karachi, he said.

 The Jaish-e-Mohammad has been fighting Indian security forces in Kashmir. It has also been suspected of involvement in attacks in Indian cities and on western targets in Pakistan.

 Mullah Omar

 Pakistan today denied an international media report that Taliban chief Mullah Omar, who is on the US most wanted list, is living in Pakistan.

 There has been no evidence about the presence of Mullah Omar in Pakistan, said a statement released in Islamabad, shortly after the CNN reported that Omar was living in the country.

 The statement termed the CNN report 

 as baseless adding it was a concocted 

 story and nothing but mere figment of reporters imagination. 

 Although Pakistan has repeatedly denied such accusation, 

 the latest one came after CNN reported from Kabul that Omar 

 is living in Pakistan.

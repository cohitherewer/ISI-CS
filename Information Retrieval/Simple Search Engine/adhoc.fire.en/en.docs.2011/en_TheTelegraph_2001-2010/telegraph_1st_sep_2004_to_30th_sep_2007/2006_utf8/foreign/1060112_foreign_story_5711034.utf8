The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Yes, I smacked my older children but 

 not Leo: Blair

 London, Jan. 11: Tony Blair smacked 

 his three older children when they were small, he admitted 

 yesterday, but insisted that he does not hit his five-year-old 

 son, Leo. 

 Blair was put on the spot about 

 his methods of parental discipline by Kirsty Wark, the BBC 

 Two Newsnight interviewer, at a question and answer session 

 with the public and media in Swindon as he promoted his 

 respect agenda. 

 He was asked: Do you smack 

 your kids? Did you? When he failed to reply immediately, 

 Wark asked him: Did it cause a problem? 

 Blair said: No, I think 

 actually, funnily enough, Im probably different with 

 my youngest than I was with my older ones. Misunderstanding 

 his reply, Wark asked him: What, you do smack the 

 younger one? 

 Blair, whose other children are 

 aged 21, 20 and 17, replied: No no, no no. It was 

 actually the other way round but... I think, look, this 

 smacking... I mean, I agree with what you just said, I think 

 everybody actually knows the difference between smacking 

 a kid and abusing a child. But I, if I can honestly 

 say this to you ? I think the problem is when you get these 

 really, really difficult families, its moved a bit 

 beyond that. 

 In 2004 as the government faced 

 calls to back a total ban on physical punishment, Blair 

 said he understood why parents would want to smack really 

 naughty children. 

 But he said that he felt a 

 bit different now, and called for a dose of 

 common sense in the debate. 

 His comment came during debates 

 on the Children Act, which bans any physical punishment 

 by parents in England and Wales that leaves a mark on the 

 youngster.

 In 1998 the European Court of 

 Human Rights declared that the ancient British law that 

 permits the reasonable chastisement of children 

 was unlawful. 

 The ruling has been endorsed by 

 two parliamentary committees, and the monitoring committee 

 of the UNs Rights of the Child Convention. It is perfectly 

 possible that Blair does not smack Leo because the boy is 

 perfectly behaved and dutifully respects his father at all 

 times.

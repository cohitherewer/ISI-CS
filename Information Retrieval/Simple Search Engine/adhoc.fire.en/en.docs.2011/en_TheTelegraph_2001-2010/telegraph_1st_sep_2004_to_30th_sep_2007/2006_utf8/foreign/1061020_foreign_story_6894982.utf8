 Sad days for Chinas Happy Man

 Beijing, Oct. 19 (Reuters): Chinas top statistician was sacked after anti-corruption investigations implicated him in the Shanghai pension fund scandal, a spokesman for the National Bureau of Statistics said today.

 Qiu Xiaohua who announced plans to issue a new Happiness Index this year to include living conditions, the environment and salary was dismissed as chief of the statistics bureau this month for breaches of discipline, bureau spokesman Li Xiaochao said. 

 Relevant departments, when carrying out investigations into the Shanghai social security fund scandal, found out that Qiu was suspected of being involved in severe violations of party discipline, Li said. Xinhua said Qiu was discovered to be involved in the scandal. 

 More than 100 central government investigators have descended on Shanghai to investigate money reportedly drained from the citys 10 billion yuan ($1.25 billion) social security fund for illicit loans.

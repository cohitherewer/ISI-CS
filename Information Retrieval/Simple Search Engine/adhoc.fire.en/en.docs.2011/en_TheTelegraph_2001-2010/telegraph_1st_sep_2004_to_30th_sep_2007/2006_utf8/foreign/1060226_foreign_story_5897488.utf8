 Sheryl Crow operated for breast cancer

 Sheryl Crow: Gutsy

 Washington, Feb. 25 (Reuters): Grammy winner Sheryl Crow had surgery for breast cancer and postponed a North American tour scheduled to start next month, the singer announced on her website yesterday.

 Crows website said she underwent successful surgery on Wednesday and described the procedure as minimally invasive. Doctors said her prognosis was excellent and she would have radiation treatments as a precaution.

 I am joining the more than 200,000 women who will be diagnosed with breast cancer this year, Crow said. We are a testament to the importance of early detection and new treatments ... I am inspired by the brave women who have faced this battle before me and grateful for the support of family and friends.

 Last month, Crow, 44, and Lance Armstrong, seven-time winner of the Tour de France cycling race and a survivor of testicular, brain and lung cancer, announced they were scrapping plans to get married. Crow is calling off her March-April tour but intends to reschedule as much of it as possible.

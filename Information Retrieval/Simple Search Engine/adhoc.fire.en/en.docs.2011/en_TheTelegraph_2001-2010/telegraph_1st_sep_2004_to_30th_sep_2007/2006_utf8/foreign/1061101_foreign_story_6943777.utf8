 Reese, husband to separate

Los Angeles, Oct. 31 (Agencies): Reese Witherspoon, 

who started the year on an Oscar-winning high, and Ryan Phillippe are ending it 

on a low note: The couple have separated.

 Witherspoon, whose seven-year marriage reportedly had been on the rocks for some time, won a best actress Oscar for her role in Walk the Line. She is the latest academy award winner to suffer marital woes. In January, two-time Oscar winner Hilary Swank split from husband Chad Lowe. We are saddened to announce that Reese and Ryan have decided to formally separate, their publicists said. They remain committed to their family and we ask that you please respect their privacy.

 Witherspoon, 30, and Phillippe, 32, reportedly met at her 21st birthday party before working together on the 1999 film Cruel Intentions. They married in June of that year and have two children, 7-year-old daughter Ava and 3-year-old son Deacon.

 The publicists gave no more details about the split but the celebrity website www.tmz.com reported that Witherspoon has contacted the divorce lawyer who represented Jennifer Aniston and Lisa Marie Presley.

 Dollar habit

 Moscow, July 22 (Reuters): Russian defence minister Sergei Ivanov invented a new unit of currency yesterday: That thing your are not allowed to say.

 Russias parliament is in the process of adopting a law that will fine government ministers for saying dollar when they could have used the word rouble instead.

 But old habits die hard. Telling reporters about a contract to supply fighter aircraft to Venezuela, Ivanov said the deal had a value of more than one billion of that thing that you are not allowed to say anymore.

 Calista TV

 Pasadena, California (AP) Calista Flockhart says its time to get back to work.

She returns to TV this autumn as a Right-wing radio host turned pundit in the new drama Brothers amp; Sisters. The show, which co-stars Sally Field and Rachel Griffiths, begins on September 24 on ABC. I really want to go back to work. It just seemed like the perfect time and the perfect project, Flockhart told the Television Critics Associations summer meeting.

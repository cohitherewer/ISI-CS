 Problems? Call up Putin

 Moscow, Oct. 24 (Reuters): Have a problem in Russia? There is one sure-fire way to solve it: Get on the telephone to President Vladimir Putin.

 Putin tomorrow will field questions, requests and complaints from ordinary people across his vast country in a live television show called A Direct Line to the President that has become a hotly anticipated annual ritual.

 For those lucky enough to get through, it can work wonders. In 2002, an 11-year-old girl complained on air that her town only put up an artificial tree for the New Year holiday. Days later a real tree was installed in the town square.

 In 2004, pensioner Lyudmila Karachentseva called the show to tell Putin her village had no running water. The President threatened to sack the regional governor if he did not act. A new water pipe was installed soon after.

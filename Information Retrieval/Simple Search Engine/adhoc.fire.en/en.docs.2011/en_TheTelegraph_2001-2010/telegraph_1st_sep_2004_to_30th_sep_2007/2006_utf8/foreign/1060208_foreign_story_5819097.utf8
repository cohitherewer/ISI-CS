 Cool Clooney Vegas gamble

 Las Vegas, Feb. 7: The glamorous Las Vegas of the Rat Pack era is being reborn with a host of luxurious developments that emphasise opulence and sophistication over gambling. 

 Many of the multi-billion-dollar projects include high-rise blocks of flats with artfully landscaped grounds, part of a drive by developers to turn affluent visitors to the booming city into residents.

 George Clooney is the most famous investor in Las Ramblas, a $3 billion casino, hotel and condominium complex of 11 towers on a 25-acre plot complete with an open-air pedestrian promenade. 

 The actor, who played Danny Ocean, Frank Sinatras character, in a remake of the 1960 Rat Pack heist film Oceans Eleven, aims to recapture the glamour of vintage Vegas with a smarter dress code and Philippe Starck-designed interiors. 

 It will be more Tony Bennett than Britney Spears, said Clooney. I want it to be like old Vegas and old Hollywood. Its going to be a classy joint.

 The Rat Pack, entertainers who included Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr, helped transform Vegas from a sleazy, desert mob-town into something more sophisticated and stylish.

 Their act embodied hedonism and permissiveness but the tuxedo-clad group oozed raffish charm, attracting the Hollywood elite and the rich and famous eager to sample the new cool, swinging Vegas.

 But the gambling mecca was later dominated by themed casinos with gimmicky architecture, drawing more tourists in shorts than wealthy hipsters. Las Ramblas is supposed to change all that. Named after the Barcelona boulevard, it will sit on Harmon Avenue, the focus of roughly $20 billion of upmarket development.

 Paris problem

 Los Angeles, Feb. 8 (Reuters): A judge yesterday ordered Paris Hilton to stay away from a Los Angeles party planner who accused the celebrity heiress of bombarding him with angry phone calls, shoving him and threatening his life.

 Quintana won a restraining order in a Los Angeles court against the 24-year-old socialite best known for her television reality show The Simple Life and for a sex video that showed up on the Internet.

 Quintana, who claims to have introduced Hilton to her current boyfriend, Greek shipping heir Stavros Niarchos, said problems began after she started dating Niarchos.

 He said she accused him of trying to get Niarchos to ditch her for Niarchos former girlfriend, starlet Mary-Kate Olsen.

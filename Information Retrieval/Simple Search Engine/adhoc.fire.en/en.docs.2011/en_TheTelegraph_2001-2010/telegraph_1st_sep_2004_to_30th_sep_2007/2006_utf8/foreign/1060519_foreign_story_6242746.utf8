 Cloud hangs on prince 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Crown Prince Paras Bir Bikram Shah Dev

 Kathmandu, May 18: Some analysts have voiced doubts over the effectiveness of the proclamation as, under the current constitution, no parliamentary bill can become law until the head of state ? the king ? signs it.

 But politicians say the proclamation overrides the constitution and reflects the will of the people and, therefore, cannot be challenged.

 If anyone tries to dishonour this, they will be digging their own grave, said former Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba. One significant clause in the resolution is about naming the heir to the throne. 

 From now, the parliament will decide the heir as well as the perks and expenses of the king. It will also be responsible for his security. The clause puts a big question over the possibility of the unpopular crown prince Paras, known for his wild and violent ways, becoming the king after his father Gyanendra.

 The resolution says the parliament, which will enjoy full executive powers, would take steps to ensure the election of a constituent assembly. It nullifies all the provisions of the 1990 constitution and laws that contradict this resolution.

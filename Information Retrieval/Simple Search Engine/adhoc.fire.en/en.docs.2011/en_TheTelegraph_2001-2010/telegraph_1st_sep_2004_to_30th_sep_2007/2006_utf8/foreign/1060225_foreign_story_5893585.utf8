 Glamour seeks Oscar return

 Los Angeles, Feb. 23 (Reuters): Hollywood wants to return to its heyday of sophisticated glamour ? the days when a star was a star and knew how to dress like one ? at this years Academy Awards, fashion insiders say.

 But dont expect to see a single slinky fashion dominating the red carpet at Oscar night on March 5.

 A variety of styles will be key. Long flowing silk charmeuse gowns will share the stage with vintage show-stealers from glamourous eras gone by. A smattering of ballet-length hems will be seen among floor-length gowns, and warm shades like copper and olive will vie with vivid hues of fuchsia and lilac.

 I think were going to see a return to the Hollywood glamour era, said Patty Fox, fashion coordinator for the 78th Academy Awards, adding: Were going to see more variety than weve seen in the past.

 Yesterday, Fox hosted a fashion preview of the looks expected to turn heads at the awards show, featuring designers like Monique Lhuillier, Colleen Quen, Richard Tyler and Escada ? all draped over models dripping in diamonds.

 A lime Sylvia Heisel one-shoulder satin gown accented by a Van Cleef amp; Arpels Art Deco diamond brooch gave way to a flowing lilac chiffon Randolph Duke. A ruby-red Douglas Hannant beaded dress weighing 11 kg caused veteran Oscars producer Gil Cates to joke: The dress weighs more than the model!

 Mens styles ? tuxedos with waistcoats and black accented with ivory ? will be reminiscent of the days when celluloid heartthrobs Cary Grant and Gary Cooper prevailed, she said.

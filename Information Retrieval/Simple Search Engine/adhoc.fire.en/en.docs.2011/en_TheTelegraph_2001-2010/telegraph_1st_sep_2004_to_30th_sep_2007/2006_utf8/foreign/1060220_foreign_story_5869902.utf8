 French, US wine war set for rerun

 ANDREW ALDERSON

 London, Feb. 19: Shock waves were sent through the world of viniculture when nine French wine tasters ruled that Californian wines were as good as the best from their own country. 

 That blind tasting, which took place 30 years ago and is known as the Judgment of Paris, is to be recreated in Britain and America. On May 24, nine more European tasters will swirl, sniff, sip and spit their way through wines, while a simultaneous event takes place in the US. 

 Until 1976, American wines had been considered inferior, but so improved was their standard that some judges professed not to be able to tell the difference between them and the French wines. 

 Steven Spurrier, the wine writer and author who staged the original tasting, said yesterday that he was excited about the rematch. 

 The results of the original tasting changed the perception of New World wines for ever. These Californian upstarts surprised the French establishment, sparking an exchange of ideas that has created a golden age for wine-drinkers. 

 The results of the original tasting, held in Paris, are considered to have revolutionised wine-making. 

 However, this time, Spurrier believes that the French wines will come out top as some of them were too young to be at their peak in 1976. 

 quot;I think this will be the final triumph for the French wines. Id be surprised if a Californian wine finished in the top four, quot; he said. 

 In Britain, the new tasting - organised with the help of the Rothschilds, one of the worlds leading wine-making families - will take place at Waddesdon Manor, in Buckinghamshire. The manor, now owned by the National Trust, is the ancient home of the Rothschild family. 

 The Europeans who will take part in the blind tasting include Hugh Johnson, Jancis Robinson and Michael Broadbent. 

 The Californian tasting will be held at Copia, a quot;discovery centre quot; in the Napa Valley.

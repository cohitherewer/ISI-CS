 G8 runs into energy storm

 St Petersburg, July 16 (Reuters): Environmental advocacy groups today accused the Group of Eight industrial nations of failing to take seriously the problems of climate change and the dangers of nuclear energy.

 At a summit in St Petersburg, the leaders of the G8 approved a statement that acknowledged divisions among the worlds top economies on promoting nuclear energy and tackling climate change.

 But the statement said those who favour nuclear energy ? six of the eight G8 members ? see it as key to providing energy security amid booming global demand and as a clean form of power that can help slow dangerous global warming.

 Tobias Muenchmeyer, an analyst at anti-nuclear environmental group Greenpeace, said acknowledgement of a split did not change the fact that the statement is strongly pro-nuclear.

 He said that apart from Germany and Italy, Bush and Putin and the rest are committed to expanding nuclear technology that at the same time gives countries the nuclear weapons option.

 German officials said the text was acceptable to Berlin, which has committed to an early phase-out of nuclear energy by the early 2020s, because it emphasised the need to ensure nuclear power plants are safely run.

 Nuclear energy, which is making a comeback worldwide, especially in Asia, produces few greenhouse gases and has been hailed by some environmentalists as a good way of protecting the climate while meeting growing demand for electricity.

 Critics, however, say there is no good solution for the storage of dangerous nuclear waste. They also say nuclear power plants are vulnerable to terrorist attacks and result in an increased risk of nuclear weapons proliferation.

 Alice Slater, president of the GRACE Policy Institute, said it was time to focus on green renewable sources of energy, namely solar, wind and hydro power that can stop the climate from worsening.

 People dont get told 

 the story that these things are possible, that the sun, 

 water and wind can work, Slater said.

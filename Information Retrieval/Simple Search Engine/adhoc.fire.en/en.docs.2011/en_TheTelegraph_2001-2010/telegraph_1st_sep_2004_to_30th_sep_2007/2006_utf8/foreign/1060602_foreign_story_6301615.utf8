 Meek thief

 Tokyo, June 1 (Reuters): A would-be Japanese bank robber asked staff how he should carry out the crime before meekly obeying a request to leave and then accidentally stabbing himself in the leg with a knife he was carrying.

 The 58-year-old unemployed man went into a branch of the Saitama Resona Bank in the town of Kumagaya, north of Tokyo, on Wednesday, intending to rob it, police said.

 The man first asked a bank teller: Any idea how you rob a bank? The teller alerted another member of staff, who asked the man to leave. 

 Big silence

 London (Reuters): The quarter bells 

 of Londons Great Clock which accompany Big Bens 

 sounding on the hour will not be chiming for a month as 

 the bearing on one bell needs to be replaced. While residents 

 and visitors to London can still expect to hear the main 

 Big Ben itself chiming, they may be surprised when the clock 

 stays silent at each quarter-hour from 8 am on Monday. 

 Prison call

 Rio de Janeiro (Reuters): Brazilian police are investigating how an accused drug kingpin wanted by the authorities dropped by a local prison to take part in a sermon last week and left through the front door. Alberico Medeiros spoke during a Pentecostal sermon in front of 480 inmates about his years as a drug trafficker and how he had a huge gang of cutthroats at his command.

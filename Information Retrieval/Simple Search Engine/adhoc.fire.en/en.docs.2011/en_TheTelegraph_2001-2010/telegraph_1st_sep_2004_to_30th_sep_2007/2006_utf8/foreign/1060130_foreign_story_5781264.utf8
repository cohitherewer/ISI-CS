 Saddam trial collapses in chaos

 Baghdad, Jan. 29 (Reuters): The trial of Saddam Hussein collapsed into chaos moments after resuming today, as the former Iraqi President and his defence team stormed out and guards dragged his half-brother from the courtroom.

 The dramatic scenes were played out as a tough new chief judge, Raouf Abdel-Rahman, tried to stamp his authority on the court, telling lawyers he would not allow them to make political statements in the US-backed court.

 I am the judge and you are the defendant, Abdel Rahman told Saddam as he checked an outburst by the former Iraqi President, who complained: This is an American court and its rules are American... you cannot force me to stay in court.

 Abdel-Rahman is under pressure to deal firmly with Saddam after the government accused his predecessor, who resigned two weeks ago, of being too lenient on the former Iraqi leader. Saddams courtroom tirades have dominated proceedings.

 The walkouts by Saddam, two co-defendants and their legal team after verbally sparring with the no-nonsense Abdel-Rahman, and the judges expulsion of a fourth accused, will raise fresh concerns about the courts ability to stage a fair trial.

 Within minutes of the start, Abdel-Rahman ejected Saddams former intelligence chief and half-brother, Barzan al-Tikriti, after he refused to keep quiet and called the trial a daughter of a whore. Barzan was dragged out by court guards.

 This court is not a place for political speeches, said Abdel-Rahman, a 64-year-old Kurd.

 The chief of Saddams legal team, Khalil al-Dulaimi, protested: This trial is not fair. After this the defence lawyers walked out.

 If you leave then you cant come back for future sessions, said Abdel-Rahman.

 When the judge then tried to impose court-appointed lawyers on Saddam, the former Iraqi leader turned to them, and shaking his finger, said: I reject you. If you stay here you are evil.

 I want to leave, Saddam, dressed in a dark suit and a white shirt, told the judge.

 Then leave, said Abdel-Rahman.

 It is a tragedy. I led you for 35 years. How can you lead me out of court? Shame on you, Saddam said.

 He then left the courtoom, and was followed by his former vice-president, Taha Yassin Ramadan, and Awad Hamed al-Bander, a former chief judge in his Revolutionary Court.

 Abdel-Rahman was determined not to allow the walkouts to derail proceedings, calling three new witnesses, two women and a man. They testified from behind a light grey curtain, as other witnesses have done, to hide their identity.

 The four minor Baath party officials who remained in the court complained they had been left without legal representation, but Abdel-Rahman said they had the court-appointed lawyers.

 Saddam and seven co-accused are on trial for crimes against humanity, charged with killing 148 men from the Shiite town of Dujail after a failed bid to assassinate him there in 1982.

 The court has been in turmoil since Kurdish chief judge Rizgar Amin resigned, complaining of pressure from the Shiite-led government to speed up the process and be firmer in his handling of Saddam.

 The trial has been marred by delays since getting under way last October. Two members of the defence team have been murdered, and Amins original replacement was accused last week of being a former member of Saddams Baath party.

 Some human rights groups have criticised the former U.S. occupation authoritys decision to try Saddam and his aides in Iraq rather than in an international court. They say subsequent events have reinforced their view that sectarian and ethnic conflict make a fair trial in Baghdad hard to achieve.

 Rights group Human Rights Watch said on Friday the turnover of judges on the panel endangered the credibility of the trial.

 Abdel Rahman is from the town of Halabja, where 5,000 people died in a gas attack during an offensive by Iraqi forces in 1988, a case that will probably be the focus of a future trial for genocide.

 Sundays session was the eighth since the trial began on Oct. 19. It was due to have resumed last Tuesday but was postponed for five days amid reports that some judges in the tribunal were unhappy about Abdel Rahmans appointment.

 Abdel Rahman postponed proceedings on Sunday until Feb. 1 or Feb. 2, depending on the start of Muharram, the Islamic new year, which is marked by a public holiday.

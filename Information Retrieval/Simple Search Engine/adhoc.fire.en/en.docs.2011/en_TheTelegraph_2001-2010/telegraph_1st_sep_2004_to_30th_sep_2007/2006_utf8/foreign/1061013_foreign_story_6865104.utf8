 Pervez: Not an easy target

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Rocket theory 

 Islamabad, Oct. 11: Days after a mysterious blast in a Rawalpindi park and discovery of four 107 mm rockets in Islamabad, President Pervez Musharraf said yesterday that the culprits involved in these incidents have been arrested.

 Musharraf told reporters at an Iftar dinner last night that intelligence agencies had arrested extremists involved in the plot. However, he did not disclose the number of arrests or from where they had been nabbed.

 We have unearthed the whole gang and caught the culprits, who are extremists, he said. However, the President was not sure whether the rockets found near Parliament House and the Presidents secretariat were targeted at him.

 But, I can tell you one thing I am not an easy target, he said with a smile.

 Last week, Pakistani security officials defused two rockets which were found lying close to Parliament House in Islamabad, hours after a mysterious explosion near Musharrafs residence in the garrison town of Rawalpindi.

 Sniffer dogs detected the rockets during a routine check in the area which is located near the homes of the President and the Prime Minister, parliamentary lodges and the supreme court.

 Musharraf, who has completed seven years in power, warned that Muhammad Ali Jinnahs Pakistan will be no more if extremists gain control of the nation from moderates like him. The tussle will be between the moderates and the extremists. I am a moderate and strongly believe that the moderates must win. If the extremists win, than Quaid-e-Azams (Jinnahs) Pakistan will be no more, he said.

 NRIs off Blair Honours List 

London, April 2 (PTI): British Prime Minister 

Tony Blair is to admit defeat over the cash for peerages affair this 

week and publish the next Honours List without the names of controversial millionaires, 

including NRIs Gulam Noon and Dr Chai Patel, who made loans to the Labour Party, 

a report said today. 

 Blair has lost his battle with the Honours watchdog and will dump all controversial donors nominated for the House of Lords, reported The Independent on Sunday. 

 Downing Streets decision to publish the list of peers without five disputed names is aimed at stopping damaging stories about cash for Honours. The newspaper last October revealed that Blair was to award a string of Labour donors with seats on the red benches. Sources said none of the Labour donors would now gain seats in the House of Lords. 

 Leading criminal lawyers warned last night that an inquiry by Scotland Yard into the affair could lead to a criminal conviction for Blair if he is found guilty of awarding peerages for cash. The offence carries a maximum sentence of seven years. 

After consulting the queen, Blair has now agreed to 

abandon his fight to award Labour peerages to Noon, the millionaire curry magnate 

who gave ?250,000 to the party, and to Patel, head of the Priory Clinics, who 

lent ?1.5 million.

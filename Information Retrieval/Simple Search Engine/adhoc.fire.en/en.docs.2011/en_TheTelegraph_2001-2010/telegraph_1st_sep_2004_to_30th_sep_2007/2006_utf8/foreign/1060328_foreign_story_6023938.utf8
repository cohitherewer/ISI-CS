 Baghdad blog

 London, March 27 (Reuters): The anonymous female author of an Iraqi blog, whose website entitled Baghdad Burning mixes humour, despair and acerbic political commentary, has been nominated for a major literary prize in Britain.

 Known only as Riverbend, the self-styled Girl Blog from Iraq has been sending regular dispatches since August 2003.

 In her first entry, she wrote: Im female, Iraqi and 24. I survived the war. Thats all you need to know. Its all that matters these days anyway.

 Soon afterwards she explained how she lost her job in a computer software company when it was deemed too dangerous for her to go to work.

 The online diary was collected and issued by Marion Boyars Publishers in 2005, and that book has made it on to the longlist of the annual Samuel Johnson Prize for contemporary non-fiction, the winner of which wins ?30,000 ($53,000).

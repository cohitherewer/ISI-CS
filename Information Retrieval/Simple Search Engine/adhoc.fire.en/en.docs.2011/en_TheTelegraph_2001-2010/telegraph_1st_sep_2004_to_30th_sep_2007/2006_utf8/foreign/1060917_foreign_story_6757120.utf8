 Crowe court

 New York, Sept. 16 (Reuters): Actor Russell Crowe went back today to the court where he pleaded guilty last year to hitting a hotel clerk with a telephone this time as an actor rather than the defendant.

 The New Zealand native was at a Manhattan court filming the upcoming movie American Gangster.

 Crowe, the star of such movies as A Beautiful Mind and Gladiator, hit a clerk with a telephone in June 2005 at a trendy SoHo hotel.

 The actor pleaded guilty to misdemeanour charges. Crowe plays a detective in American Gangster, which is about a drug lord who smuggles heroin into Harlem during the 1970s in the coffins of US soldiers returning from Vietnam.

 Who rocks

 Los Angeles (Reuters): Legendary British rock band The Who is reaching out to a new generation of listeners.

The Who Channel, a commercial-free music channel, will launch on September 21. 

 Pop eyes

 Rio de Janeiro (AP): Claudio Paulo Pinto is looking for work. Thats his job looking. Pinto can pop his eyeballs at least 7 millimetres out of their sockets, a national record for eyepopping according to RankBrasil, an organisation modelled after the Guinness Book of World Records that lists Brazilian records. A former driver, Pinto got a job scaring visitors in a commercial haunted house in Belo Horizonte, 340 km north of Rio de Janeiro. But he recently was laid off, and now he seeks international recognition for his ability. I was measured by an opthamologist on television in January. I could pop my eyes out 7 millimetres, Pinto said by telephone on Saturday. Since then, my capacities have improved over 50 per cent. 

 CSI body

 Miami (AP): A fictional crime scene staged for CSI: Miami became part of a real police investigation after a mans body floated near the television series film crew, authorities said. The body washed up early Friday at the waters edge in Bicentennial Park, which film crews were using as a helicopter staging ground for aerial shots of a fictional offshore investigation for the CBS show. A homeless man spotted the body and alerted an off-duty police officer who was working security on the set.

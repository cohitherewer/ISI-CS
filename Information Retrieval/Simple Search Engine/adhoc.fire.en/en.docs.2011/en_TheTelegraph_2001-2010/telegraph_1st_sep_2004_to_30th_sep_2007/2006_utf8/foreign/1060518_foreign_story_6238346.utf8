 Bangkok, May 17 (Reuters): A Pacific-wide tsunami drill today revealed glitches in the regional alert network ranging from a faulty fax machine in Malaysia to an overloaded telephone network in Thailand, officials said.

 To test how well countries and their people can be notified about possible tsunamis, Exercise Pacific Wave 2006 simulated two massive undersea earthquakes ? one off the coast of the Chile, the other north of the Philippines.

 It was really a communications test for us, said Stuart Koyanagi, a geophysicist at the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii, which coordinated the test. For the most part, we were very pleased with the results, especially as its the first time weve done this sort of thing, he said. Tsunamis dont happen too often, so we have to keep people on their toes.

 For the Philippine quake, which primarily affected nations around the South China Sea, Japans Meteorological Agency transmitted six dummy bulletins to 10 countries by fax, e-mail and a special weather-data communications system.

 The last time there was one fax number in Malaysia that didnt receive the information, but that place received the information another way as well, so there was no big problem, said Osamu Kamigaichi,the agencys senior tsunami expert. The results were basically as we expected, although we thought that wed succeed with every place every time. 

 In Thailand, where more than 5,000 people died in the December 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, the government heard the message fine but a plan to issue a public alert by text message failed as phone networks ground to a halt. Deputy Prime Minister Suwat Liptapanlop and a string of high-ranking officials presiding over the drill were left red faced as SMS alerts limped in as much as 15 minutes late. This is something we need to improve, Samith Dhammasaroj, head of the Thai Tsunami Warning Research Centre, said.

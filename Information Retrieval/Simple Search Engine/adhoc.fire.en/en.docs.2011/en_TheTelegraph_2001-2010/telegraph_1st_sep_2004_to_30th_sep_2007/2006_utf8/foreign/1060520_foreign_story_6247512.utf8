 Vatican censures priest over sexual abuse

 Vatican 

 City, May 19 (Reuters): The Vatican said today 

 it had disciplined an ageing Mexican founder of an influential 

 Catholic religious order who has been accused of sexual 

 abuse, instructing him to retire to a life of prayer 

 and penitence.

 The censure of Father Marcial Maciel, 86-year-old founder of the Legionaries of Christ, is significant because he and his conservative order had found favour under the late Pope John Paul, making the decision by Pope Benedict even bolder.

 The instruction was the new Popes first major decision involving sexual abuse charges since his election last year. Before he was elected, Benedict decried the filth in the church.

 The sanctions against Maciel made him one of the most prominent persons to be disciplined for alleged sexual abuse and could be devastating for the priestly order and its lay branch, Regnum Christi, which claims tens of thousands of members.

 Founded by Maciel in 1941, the order now has around 600 priests and 2,500 seminarians. It also runs a major Pontifical university in Rome.

 Maciel, who lives in Mexico, has been accused by some former seminarians of sexual abuses dating back to the 1940s and 1950s, when they were boys as young as 10.

 The subject of on-and-off probes into abuse during his career, Maciel stepped down as leader of the conservative religious order in 2004 and has long denied the accusations.

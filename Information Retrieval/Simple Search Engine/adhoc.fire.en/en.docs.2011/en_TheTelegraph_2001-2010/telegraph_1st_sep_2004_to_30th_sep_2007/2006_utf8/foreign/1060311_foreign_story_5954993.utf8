 Berlusconi trial heat

 Milan, March 10 (Reuters): Milan prosecutors asked a judge today to order Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and the husband of British culture secretary Tessa Jowell to stand trial on corruption charges, judicial sources said.

 The prosecutors have accused Berlusconi of paying tax lawyer David Mills, Jowells recently estranged husband, a kickback of $600,000 for not revealing compromising details of the Prime Ministers media empire when he testified in two court cases.

 The request for a trial comes at a difficult time for the Italian Premier as he faces a close-fought general election on April 9 and 10. 

 Documents filed by prosecutors last month when they wrapped up their probe included a letter from Mills to his accountant in which the lawyer said he did not lie in court but turned some very tricky corners, to put it mildly and acknowledged receiving $600,000.

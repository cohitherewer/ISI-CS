 London given a Kashmir label

 London, Aug. 30: London, which is already called Londonistan in some circles, could also be disparagingly nicknamed Kashmir on the Thames, it was suggested by a writer who was given airtime on BBC Radio 4s flagship Today programme.

 The writer, Paul Cruickshank, was interviewed about an article, Kashmir on the Thames, he has co-authored with Peter Bergen, for the influential American journal, The New Republic.

 Cruickshank, an investigative journalist, is a fellow at New York University Law Schools Centre on Law and Security, while Bergen is a senior fellow at the New American Foundation and the author of The Osama bin Laden I Know. 

 Cruickshank alleged today that Britain poses the greatest threat to America because it houses Pakistani militants with British passports. His comments come against the background of the alleged bomb plot, involving mainly British Pakistanis, to blow up trans-Atlantic aircraft.

 Today, three more men Nabeel Hussain, 22, Mohammed Yasar Gulzar, 25, and Mohammed Shamin Uddin, 35 appeared before the City of Westminster Magistrates Court in central London, accused of conspiracy to murder and of preparing an act of terrorism. 

 Eight other men have already appeared in court on the same charges. 

 In a geographical sense, Cruickshank and Bergen are inaccurate in that the vast majority of the Mirpuris from Pakistani Kashmir live not in London but in Bradford or Birmingham.

 However, allowing them poetic licence, the authors argue that British Pakistanis are endangering Americas safety, and that the US government may have to reintroduce visas for visiting Britons. At present, they are admitted under a visa waiver scheme. 

 The authors recall the example of Omar Sheikh, a British student who was released from an Indian jail in exchange for the passengers of a hijacked Indian Airlines plane.

 On New Years Eve in 1999, Islamist militants had plenty to celebrate, they begin. 

 At the Taliban-controlled Kandahar airport, a planeload of hostages was being swapped for terrorists held in India. The hijackers Kashmiri militants had managed to secure the freedom of three key allies. Two, Maulana Masood Azhar and Mushtaq Ahmed Zargar, were Pakistani; but the third, a man named Omar Sheikh, was the scion of a wealthy British Pakistani family and had studied at the London School of Economics.

 They add: That a British citizen figured so prominently in the Kandahar hostage crisis was disturbing but far from anomalous. The eleven people charged this week with conspiring to blow up planes using liquid explosives are all British citizens. 

 So were the terrorists who 

 attacked London in 2005, almost all of the plotters who 

 allegedly conspired to detonate a fertiliser bomb in England 

 in 2004, the suicide bombers who attacked a beachfront Tel 

 Aviv bar in 2003, and an alleged al Qaida operative who, 

 along with would-be shoe bomber Richard Reid, planned to 

 explode a plane in the fall of 2001.

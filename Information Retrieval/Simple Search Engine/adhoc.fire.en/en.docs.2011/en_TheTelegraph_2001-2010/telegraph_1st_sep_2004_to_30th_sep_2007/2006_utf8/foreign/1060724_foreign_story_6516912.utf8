 Police pick up the bill for bloomer

 London, July 23: Two men now known in Britain as the Forest Gate Two and their family have been living in a four-star hotel for more than seven weeks ? at a cost to the taxpayer of up to ?30,000 a month.

 Along with their parents and two women, thought to be their sisters, they have been booked into five rooms at a Holiday Inn in Bloomsbury in central London, where both single and double rooms cost ?190 per night.

 Facilities available to them there include a swimming pool, sauna and spa, as well as the hotels restaurant.

 The Metropolitan Police are picking up the bill because the raid in which the familys home was torn apart in the hunt for a chemical bomb resulted in false arrests.

 Mohammed Abul Kahar, 23, who was shot in the shoulder during the raid, and his brother Abul Koyair, 20, were held by police on June 2 but later released without charge. A police spokesman explained that the force was obliged to foot the bill for accommodation until it had engaged and paid for builders to restore the property.

 However, there was little evidence last week of restoration work even having begun on the house in Forest Gate following the much-publicised police raid.

 Questions were being raised about what alternative accommodation might have been available for less outlay.

 A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: A schedule for restoration has been drawn up. Until the property is of a decent standard we will continue to pay for the familys alternative accommodation.

 The police refused to say if work on the property had yet begun but neighbours said that they had seen no activity or building work at the terrace house since the forensic teams left the scene on June 10.

 One neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: Their house has never been quieter. In fact, you would be able to hear a pin drop in comparison to the racket the police where making when they were carrying out their investigations.

 On Friday, The Sunday Telegraph was told by a hotel employee that all the family except the two brothers had been staying at the Holiday Inn since the Forest Gate raid ? 52 days ago.

 The brothers checked in after their release from police custody, the staff member added. Based on the ?190 nightly rate for a room, the total bill for accommodation so far would be up to ?44,080.

 This sum excludes the meals they have eaten regularly at one of the hotels restaurants, the Rasa Maricham, which serves Indian food and charges more than ?10 for an average main course dish with rice.

 On Friday night, the whole family sat down to dinner at the restaurant, which provides a range of dishes, including Calicut chicken kurma and Nair masala dosa.

 The two brothers, dressed in shorts and T-shirts, appeared relaxed. The family happily chatted among themselves as they tucked into their meals.

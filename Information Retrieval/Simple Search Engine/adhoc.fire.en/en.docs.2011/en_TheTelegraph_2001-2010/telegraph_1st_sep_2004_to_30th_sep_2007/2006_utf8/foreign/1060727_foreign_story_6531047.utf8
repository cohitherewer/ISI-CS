 Jolie baby in wax for public eye

 Jolie: Family in wax

 New York, July 26 (AFP): Barely two months her birth, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolies baby Shiloh Nouvel already merits her own figure at the Madame Tussauds wax museum in New York.

 The first baby ever given the honour, Shiloh Nouvels figure with moms signature pouty lips and delicate features, will be inaugurated today, joining more than 200 top celebrities portrayed in wax statues.

 Shiloh Nouvel was born to the Hollywood megastars in Namibia on May 27. While her parents have kept the real Shiloh out of the public eye, at Madame Tussauds she will lie peacefully inside a woven bassinet in her very own african-themed nursery, near figures of her parents, the museum said in a statement.

 The nursery ? painted a pale yellow ? also includes jungle-themed curtains, a whimsical chandelier, a hite changing table and giant stuffed animals, the statement said.

 Soft African lullabies will be played in the background, and guests can pose for a family photo with the three figures, said the museum, which promises to send a dollar per photo to the UN childrens fund Unicef.

 Jolie has been a United Nations goodwill ambassador for several years.

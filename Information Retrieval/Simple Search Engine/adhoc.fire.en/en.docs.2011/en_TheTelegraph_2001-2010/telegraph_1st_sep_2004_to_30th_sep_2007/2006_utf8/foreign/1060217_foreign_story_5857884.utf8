 Find killers, urges China

 Beijing, Feb. 16 (Reuters): Chinese President Hu Jintao has urged Pakistan to track down the gunmen who killed three Chinese engineers in a drive-by shooting, Xinhua news agency said today.

 The attack occurred near the southern town of Hub, outside Karachi, ahead of a planned visit to China by Pakistani President Perves Musharraf on Sunday. A spokesman for the Baluch Liberation Army claimed responsibility.

 Baluchistan home minister Shoaib Nausherwani said investigators were hopeful of getting a break in the case over the next couple of days. We have detained around 40 people in connection with the killing, Nausherwani said.

 Informed about the murder yesterday, Hu Jintao ordered (the) Chinese foreign ministry, embassy and consulates to require Pakistan to catch the murderers and ensure the safety of the Chinese there, Xinhua said.

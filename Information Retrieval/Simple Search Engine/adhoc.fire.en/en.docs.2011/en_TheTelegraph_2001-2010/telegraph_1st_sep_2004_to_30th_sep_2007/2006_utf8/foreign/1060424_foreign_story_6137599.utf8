 Namibia shield for star couple

 Pitt and Jolie: Privacy 

 Johannesburg, April 23 (AP): Namibian authorities are clamping down on journalists trying to follow Brad Pitt, heavily pregnant Angelina Jolie and her two adopted children, according to a newspaper report. 

 South Africas Sunday Times said its photographer and three other French photographers were ordered to leave Namibia or face arrest. Journalists require accreditation to work in the country.

 Namibian Prime Minister Nahas Angula defended the move, saying the couple should be left alone.

 This lady is expecting, he said. You guys are harassing her. Why dont you allow her some privacy? harassment is not allowed in Namibia.... If a person says they dont want to be photographed then, of course, that person deserves protection.

 The couple and their entourage are staying at the luxury burning shores resort hotel between the scenic old colonial german town of swakopmond and the resort of walvis bay, in an area where the desert sand dunes descend spectacularly to the sea.

 Despite tight security, photographers have managed to snap images of hollywoods hottest couple.

 The newspaper said that the couples security chief gave a local journalist a statement appealing for privacy.

 We love africa and to be here in namibia with our family is very special for us, it said. To the local people who have been so kind and gracious, thank you for making us feel at home.

 As for the press, we kindly ask for privacy so that we can enjoy this beautiful country with our children. It was signed angelina jolie and brad pitt. (ap) sma ksm 04231810 del

 Rights icon amp; Martin Luther widow dies

 King: Grace and steel

 Atlanta, Jan. 31 (Reuters): Coretta Scott King, who surged to the front of the fight for racial equality in America after her husband Martin Luther King Jr. was murdered in 1968, has died at age 78, friends and family said today.

 She had suffered a stroke and a heart attack in August, and was last seen in public on January 14 at a dinner marking the Martin Luther King, Jr, national holiday, where she received a standing ovation from the 1,500 people in the crowd.

 Coretta Kings steely determination, grace and class won her millions of admirers inside and outside the civil rights movement.

 Representative John Lewis, a Democratic congressman from Georgia and civil rights leader, said it was a very sad hour.

 Long before she met and married Dr King, she was an activist for peace and civil rights and for civil liberties, he told CNN. She became the embodiment, the personification (of the civil rights movement after Dr Kings death) ... keeping the mission, the message, the philosophy ... of nonviolence in the forefront.

 At the White House, Dan Bartlett, counsellor to the President, told Fox television: President Bush and First Lady Laura Bush were always heartened by their meetings with Coretta King. What an inspiration to millions of people. Im deeply saddened by todays news.

 Coretta Scott King played a major back-up role in the civil rights movement until the death of her husband, who was assassinated on a Memphis motel balcony on April 4, 1968, while supporting a sanitation workers strike.

 Coretta King, who was in Atlanta at the time, learned of her husbands shooting in a telephone call from Reverend Jesse Jackson, a call she later wrote: I seemed subconsciously to have been waiting for all of our lives.

 As she recalled in her autobiography My Life With Martin Luther King Jr., she felt she had to step fully into the civil rights movement.

 Because his task was not finished, I felt that I must re-dedicate myself to the completion of his work, she said.

 Determined to make sure Americans did not forget her husband or his dream of a colour-blind society, she created a memorial and a forum in the Martin Luther King Jr Centre for Non-violent Social Change in Atlanta.

 Coretta Scott was born April 27, 1927, near Marion, Alabama. Spending much of her early years on a farm she saw little racial prejudice until she reached high school, when she and her sister were sent into town to board with a family while attending Lincoln High School, one of the black schools in the segregated South. It was awful, she said of living in Marion.

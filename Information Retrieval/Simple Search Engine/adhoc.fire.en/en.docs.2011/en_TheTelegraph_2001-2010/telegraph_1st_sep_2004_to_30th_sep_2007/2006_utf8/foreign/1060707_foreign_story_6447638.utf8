 Pepsi tips off, Coke catches thieves

 New York, July 6 (Reuters): Federal prosecutors charged three people yesterday with stealing confidential information from Coca-Cola Co. ? including a sample of a secret new drink ? and trying to sell it to rival PepsiCo Inc.

 The three, who include an executive administrative assistant at Coke, were charged with wire fraud along with stealing and selling trade secrets. The prosecutors say the trio sought to sell the information in deals worth as much as $1.5 million.

 The prosecutors said Coke learned of the theft from Pepsi, which provided the company with a letter from an individual claiming to be a high-level Coca-Cola employee offering very detailed and confidential information.

 We just did what any responsible company would do. Competition can be fierce, but it also needs to be fair, a Pepsi spokesman said.

 On hearing from Pepsi, Coke alerted the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which began an undercover operation.

 Following the undercover investigation, prosecutors named Ibrahim Dimson, Edmund Duhaney and Joya Williams in the complaint. They said investigation showed Williams, an executive administrative assistant at Coke, was the source of the information. 

 Video surveillance showed Williams at her desk going through files in search of documents and stuffing them in her bags, prosecutors said.

 She was also observed holding a liquid container with a white label, which resembled the description of a new Coca-Cola product sample before placing it into her personal bag, authorities said. The company later verified the sample was genuine.

 A Coke spokesman said the closely guarded formula of Coca-Cola Classic was safe.

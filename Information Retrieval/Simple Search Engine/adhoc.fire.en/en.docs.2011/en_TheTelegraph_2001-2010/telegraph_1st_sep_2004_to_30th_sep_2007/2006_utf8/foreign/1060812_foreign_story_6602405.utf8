 London, Aug. 11 (Reuters): British Muslims criticised the government today for publishing the names of 19 men who police sources say are under arrest for allegedly plotting to blow up passenger planes bound for the US.

 The government instructed the Bank of England to publish the names yesterday, just hours after police arrested 24 people in connection with the suspected plot. Police have not named the 24 but a police source confirmed they include the 19 named by the central bank. 

 Some Muslim groups said the move was unnecessary and could hamper the suspects chance of a fair trial if they are eventually charged in connection with the plot.

 The Federation of Student Islamic Societies (FOSIS), an umbrella group representing Muslim students, said it was extremely disappointed by the governments action.

 It is important to wait until a thorough investigation has taken place before pointing fingers and drawing conclusions, FOSIS spokesman Wakkas Khan said.

 It is important to maintain the legal principles we hold dear, namely the concept of innocent until proven guilty. The government said that in publishing the names, it was not inferring guilt. 

 Hizb ut-Tahrir, a radical Islamist party which the government says it plans to ban, said it too was dismayed by the publication of the names.

 It concerns us that there is already talk in the media about the ethnic identity of the suspects, and that suspects are presumed guilty before any due process, said Imran Waheed, spokesman for the British branch of the party. We urge caution before jumping to conclusions.

 Colombo, April 11 (Reuters): Suspected Sri Lankan Tamil rebels killed 11 people in an attack on a naval bus today, officials said, stoking fears upcoming peace talks would not take place and civil war might resume.

 It was the second major attack on the military in two days. At least 20 people have died since Friday in a surge of violence in the country ahead of the peace talks in Geneva next week. Two British nationals were also wounded in todays attack.

 An army spokesman said a vehicle convoy was taking services personnel on holiday from the northeastern port of Trincomalee when rebels detonated a claymore mine, spraying a hail of steel fragments into the bus and another civilian vehicle.

 In a close fight, the runner-up was Rhino Horn Stockpile Management: Minimum Standards and Best Practices from East and Southern Africa. Previous winners have been Bombproof Your Horse and Greek Rural Postmen and their Cancellation Numbers.

 Car cruelty

 London: An expert on machine safety watched in disbelief as his Jaguar was devoured by a car wash, reports The Daily Telegraph. Richard Wrigley, 58, whose company advises firms nationwide, faces a ?3,000 repair bill for the 10-year-old XJ6 after the machine mangled the boot and a door. Wrigley had his grandchildren Joel, 11, and Claudia, 10, in the rear of the vehicle at the time. He had used the car wash without problems many times before at the store in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire. He said: I glanced in my rear mirror and saw something red, after a few seconds I realised it was my boot lid. I thought it would cut out but the machinery kept going on and on.

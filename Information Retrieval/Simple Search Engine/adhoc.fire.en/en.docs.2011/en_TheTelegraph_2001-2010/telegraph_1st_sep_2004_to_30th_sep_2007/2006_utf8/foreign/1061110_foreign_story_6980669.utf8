 Obscure UK firm car faster than a Ferarri

 Bristol Cars Fighter T

 London, Nov. 9: Its hardly a household name amongst supercar makers, but yesterday Bristol Cars, a tiny and obscure British motor manufacturer, usurped the might of Ferrari, Bugatti and Lamborghini by launching what it billed as the worlds fastest car.

 The 270 mph (434 kmph), 351,000 Fighter T is a derivative of the existing Fighter model, a two-seat, aerodynamic coup launched in 2004.

 Beneath the bonnet throbs an eight-litre, 10-cylinder Chrysler engine, complete with two turbochargers, which delivers 1,012 bhp (brake horse power) and shattering performance to match. The Fighter T is capable of reaching 60 mph (96 kmph) in 3.5 seconds and 225 mph (362 kmph) in less than 30 seconds.

 The idea came from our customers, said managing director Anthony Crook. As soon as the news was out the telephone started ringing. One man even changed his order from a normal Fighter model to a T version. 

 The Fighter T will be faster than the Bugatti Veyron and the Ferrari Enzo, but its not as expensive. This is a very useable car. Its the size of a Porsche 911 and only 5 foot 9 and three-fourths inches wide, so itll go through Londons width restrictions.

 When Bristol was originally formed it used BMW engines, but it has had a 45-year association with the US Chrysler marque. The Fighter Ts V10 power plant is a former truck engine that was re-engineered by Lamborghini and used in the Dodge Viper sportscar, which was launched in 2000.

 With more than double the horsepower, the Fighter T, at top speed, will cover 132 feet a second. So how safe can such performance be in private hands? Crook said the 1.5-ton car will be limited to 225 mph when it goes on sale next autumn, but he dismissed criticisms that super high-performance cars like the Fighter T are unsafe.

 He said: People will have to be responsible and you shouldnt do such high speeds on the road. We cant pick our owners, but we dont want them killing themselves or members of the public. A Bristol is a very safe car, weve only lost three owners in 60 years and one of them drove off a precipice.

 In spite of a long history producing bespoke automobiles, few will have heard of Bristol, the car maker that emerged from the old aeroplane maker 60 years ago. The hand-built cars are sought out by aficionados the world over and Bristol has won class and team awards at Le Mans in the Fifties. In 1980 it introduced the UKs first turbocharged car the Bristol Beaufighter.

 In 60 years the firm has built only 8,016 cars and Bristol owners tend not to court publicity. Noel Gallagher, of the pop group Oasis, bought a used Bristol Blenheim five years ago.

 Vatican gates

 Vatican City, Feb. 7 (Reuters): It may not be pearly, but the Vatican is opening a new gate in its centuries-old walls. 

 The Vatican, at 0.44 sq km the worlds smallest sovereign state, said today it would open a new gate on Friday ? to be used only by cars and pedestrians leaving the Catholic enclave.

 The seat of the papacy is a small place, so the event is big local news ? worthy of a one-and-a-half page statement from the office of the governor.

 The statement said the gate, only 3.7 metres wide and closed at night by huge bronze doors, had become necessary to ease traffic at certain times of the day. Yes, even the Vatican has traffic jams.

 Bare Fair

 New York (AP): With award season still under 

 way, Scarlett Johansson and Keira Knightley are exchanging 

 ballgowns for birthday suits. Under the artful eye of photographer 

 Annie Leibovitz, the starlets posed nude for the cover of 

 Vanity Fair magazines yearly Hollywood issue. 

 Fashion superstar Tom Ford also appears on the cover photo, though he stuck with a more traditional suit one of black fabric. Ford, the issues guest art director, said he hadnt planned on becoming part of his own project, but he stepped in when actor Rachel McAdams backed out.

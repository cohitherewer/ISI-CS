 Gentle lines in Hitler sketches

 ANDREW ALDERSON

 London, Jan. 29: The watercolours of gentle landscapes suggest an innocent, even naive, young artist. 

 But the church on the edge of town, even the hastily-built barracks, give little sense of the war raging around them, or the future awaiting their creator. 

 They are, however, part of a collection of paintings and sketches created between 1916 and 1918, apparently by the young Adolf Hitler, then serving as a corporal in World War I. 

 The collection came to light after being kept in a suitcase in a Belgian attic for nearly 70 years, close to where Hitler served near the border with France. 

 The 21 watercolours and sketches will go under the hammer at Jefferys in Lostwithiel, Cornwall, in March and are expected to fetch up to ?100,000. Their Belgian owner chose the auction house after it sold another painting by Hitler in November for ?5,200. 

 The paintings carry recognised hallmarks of Hitlers previously seen art work, with a distinctive signature on most of the works. Jeffreys is carrying out further checks to confirm authenticity.

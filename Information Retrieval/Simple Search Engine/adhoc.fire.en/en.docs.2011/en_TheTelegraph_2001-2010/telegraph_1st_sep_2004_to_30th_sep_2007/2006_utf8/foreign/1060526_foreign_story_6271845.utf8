 Bin loss bother

 Doncaster (England), May 25 (Reuters): Litter bins are mysteriously vanishing from the northern village of Kirk Sandalls and the councils efforts to replace them are rubbish, say the residents.

 In many cases the bins just disappear and we do not know where on earth they are, said Michael Edward, a 63-year-old retired teacher from the village near Doncaster.

 Residents say at least 30 of the villages large metal bins have gone missing over the past year, although the council says the number is lower. One day you have bins around the shops and the next day they mysteriously vanish, said barman Adam Mackell.

 UN plea on Nepal displaced

 Kathmandu, Dec. 4 (Reuters): Nepals Maoist rebels and government must ensure the safe return of hundreds of thousands of people who fled their homes during the countrys decade-old, bloody civil war, the UN said today.

 The UN says up to 200,000 Nepalis have been driven from their homes to other parts of the country as well as India since 1996 when Maoist insurgents began a revolt against the monarchy. Last month, the government and rebels signed a landmark peace deal ending the conflict.

 As part of the pact, both sides promised to facilitate the safe return of those who have been displaced. We now call on both sides to fulfil their commitment by creating the conditions for such returns to take place, UN agencies said.

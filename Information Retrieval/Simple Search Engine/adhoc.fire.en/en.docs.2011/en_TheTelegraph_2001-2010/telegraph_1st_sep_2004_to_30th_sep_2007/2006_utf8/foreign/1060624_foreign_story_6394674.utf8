 Book irks Peter Pan hospital

 London, June 23 (Reuters): Londons Great Ormond Street Hospital, which owns the copyright to Peter Pan, criticised as inappropriate a graphic novel which portrays the sexual awakening of the character Wendy.

 Lost Girls, by British writer Alan Moore, portrays three fictional heroines ? Wendy from Peter Pan, Alice from Alices Adventures in Wonderland and Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz ? in a work its publisher calls erotic fiction at its finest.

 Moore insists on calling the work pornography, while Publishers Weekly, in an article earlier this year, said it involved a whole lot of sexual activity involving minors.

 Great Ormond Street, the childrens hospital that was given the rights to the Peter Pan story by author J.M. Barrie in 1929, said it had yet to be approached by Moore about his novel.

 In order to be published or distributed in UK and the EU, Alan Moores title would need our permission or licence, the hospital said today. 

 From press coverage, we understand it deals with sensitive subject matter which does not initially seem appropriate to be associated with the hospital and with J.M. Barries legacy to us.

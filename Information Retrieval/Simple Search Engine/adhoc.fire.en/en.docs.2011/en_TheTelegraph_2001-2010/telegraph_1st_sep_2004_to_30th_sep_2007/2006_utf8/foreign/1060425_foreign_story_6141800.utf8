 Fine Print

 Coldplay hot Fix

 London, April 24 (Reuters): British rock band Coldplay headed the list of nominations today for the respected Ivor Novello music awards after being selected in three categories.

 Soldier-turned-singer James Blunt also featured highly after being shortlisted for two awards, which honour the best British songwriters and composers.

 For best song, Coldplays Fix You goes up against Suddenly I see by Scottish singer KT Tunstall and I Bet You Look Good On The Dancefloor by Sheffield rockers the Arctic Monkeys.

 Take off

 Newcastle (Reuters): British boyband Take That, minus its 

most famous member Robbie Williams, kicked off a comeback tour on Sunday, playing 

before a packed, mainly female audience at Newcastle Arena. A decade after they 

quit, the cuddly quintet split proved their lasting popularity when the tickets 

sold out in December.

 Silent hit

 Los Angeles (Reuters): Silent Hill, a horror film based on a video game, replaced comedy spoof Scary Movie 4 as the top choice for North American moviegoers during the weekend, according to studio figures issued on Sunday. Hill sold about $20.2 million worth of tickets since opening on Friday.

 Cruise father cry

 Tom Cruise: Grim childhood

 New York, April 7 

 (AFP): Hollywood superstar Tom Cruise says his father was 

 a bully and a coward who beat him during a childhood 

 also marked by intimidation at school.

 In an interview with Parade magazine, the Mission Impossible hero painted a grim picture of his early years when he struggled with a learning disability and the breakdown of his parents marriage. Cruise grew up in near poverty in a Catholic family, dominated by his abusive father ? an electrical engineer who could never hold down a job and kept the family constantly in motion as he looked for work.

 He was a bully and a coward, said Cruise, 43. He was the kind of person where, if something goes wrong, they kick you. It was a great lesson in my life ? how hed lull you in, make you feel safe and then, bang! The Cruise family was largely supported by their mother, now 69, especially after their parents divorce in 1974 when the future box office king was just 11 years old.

 My mother finally had the courage to stand up to my dad and go: No more! Im not taking it. So long, he said.

 After the divorce cruise never saw his father until 10 years later when he visited him in hospital where he was dying of cancer. Cruise, who adopted two children with his ex-wife Nicole Kidman, is currently awaiting the birth of his first baby with actor fiancee Katie Holmes, 27.

 My concern is being the best parent I can be, making sure my kids can think and make decisions for themselves, he said.

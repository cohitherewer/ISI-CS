 Fear fades in Maoist Nepal

 Betahani, Nepal, June 18 (Reuters): Ram Kumar Jaisawal says the people of his tiny village on Nepals baking southern plains would never have had the courage to speak out against Maoist rebels a few days ago.

 But after a landmark peace deal between the government and rebels on Friday, the people of Maoist-dominated rural Nepal might gradually be finding their voices again.

 Shortly after news of the deal filtered through, dozens of men and women gathered in a grove of mango trees in Betahani to protest against the rebels and a commander who they say is intimidating them and extorting money.

 There is tremendous fear, said the 50-year-old farmer. But since there is some unity between the government and the Maoists, now we think we can speak to the party and be heard.

 Under the deal, the government agreed to dissolve parliament and invite the rebels to join an interim administration. Elections will follow for a special assembly meant to draw up a new constitution and, the rebels hope, bring more than two centuries of monarchy to an end.

 The peace process exploded into life when King Gyanendra surrendered power and reinstated parliament in April. The new multi-party government quickly agreed a truce with the rebels, stripped the king of most powers and conceded to the Maoists key demand ? constituent assembly elections.

 The deal was sealed by Prime Minister G.P. Koirala and rebel chief Prachanda. 

 Many people gave the pact a guarded welcome, but seemed slightly uncomfortable with the pace of change.

 Cutting the kings power is a drastic move but whether it will succeed is only 50-50, said Dipendra Shahi, an airline company manager. It is difficult to fulfill the Maoists demands and I doubt there will be peace.

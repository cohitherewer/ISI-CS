 Amnesty on agenda for peace

 Baghdad, June 25 (Reuters): Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki presented a national reconciliation plan to the parliament today which included the offer of an amnesty to prisoners in a bid to ease a Sunni insurgency and tackle sectarian violence.

 There will be an amnesty for those who did not take part in criminal and terrorist acts and war crimes and crimes against humanity. Those who have no proof of a crime against them should be released immediately, Maliki said.

 But the Shia Islamist did not offer any bold initiatives or concrete plans on tackling the insurgency or easing sectarian violence.

 Maliki said he would deal with powerful militias seen as one of the most destabilising forces in Iraq but difficult to disband because they are the military wings of some political parties, including ones in his ruling Shiite Alliance.

 But Maliki, who has said failure to disband militias could trigger civil war, did not detail how he would take them off the streets. He only spoke of tackling the problem of militias through political, economic and security solutions.

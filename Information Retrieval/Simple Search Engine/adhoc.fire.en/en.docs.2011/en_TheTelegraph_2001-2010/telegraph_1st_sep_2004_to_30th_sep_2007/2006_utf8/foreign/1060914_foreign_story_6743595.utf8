 Britney has a boy again

 Los Angeles, Sept. 13 (AP): 

 She did it again.

 Britney Spears gave birth to her second son early yesterday at a Los Angeles hospital, according to several entertainment magazines. 

 The baby boy was delivered around 0900 GMT at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Us Weekly reported on its website today, citing an unnamed family source. The child was delivered by a scheduled Caesarean section procedure, People.com reported.

 The newborns name was not immediately known. Spearss New York-based publicist, Leslie Sloane Zelnik, did not immediately return a call. It was the second child for Spears, 24, and her husband Kevin Federline, 28. The newborns arrival came just days before their son Sean Prestons first birthday.

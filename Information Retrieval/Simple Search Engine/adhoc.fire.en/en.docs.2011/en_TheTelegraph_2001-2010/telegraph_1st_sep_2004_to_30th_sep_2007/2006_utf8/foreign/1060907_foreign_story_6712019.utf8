 Los Angeles, Sept. 6 (Reuters): Actor Tom Cruises infant daughter made her debut on Tuesday as freshman CBS Evening News anchor Katie Couric broke the story of Vanity Fair magazine landing the much-anticipated first photos of baby Suri.

 The photographs of the dark-haired baby born to Cruise and actress Katie Holmes on April 18 were televised about midway through the newscast, marking the first public glimpse of the actors first biological child.

 Given to CBS News by Vanity Fair as an exclusive to promote the magazines 22-page Suri photo spread hitting newsstands on Wednesday, the pictures were taken by celebrity photographer Annie Leibovitz, magazine spokeswoman Beth Kseniak said.

 One shot aired by CBS News and later circulated on the Internet was the cover photo showing the smiling parents with their daughter peeking out from inside the actors leather jacket. A second showed Holmes lying on her back holding the baby over her.

 The photos put an end to speculation that had swirled in the tabloids about why baby Suri had remained out of the public eye for so long, including rumours questioning the childs existence.

 The pictures were shown during a segment called Snapshots, part of the revamped format inherited by Couric as she began her tenure as the first woman solo anchor of a major US network newscast.

 We knew this would be a very exciting show that everyone would be curious to see Katie on her first night. So, what better place to debut Vanity Fairs exclusive cover featuring baby Suri and her parents, Kseniak said.

 She said the magazine paid nothing for the photographs and unlike pictures of Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitts first child together, there was no distribution deal tied to charity.

 Suri was born after months of nonstop publicity generated by the courtship of Cruise and Holmes, which burst into the open in May 2005 when the actor giddily professed his love for the actress during a notorious couch-hopping appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show.

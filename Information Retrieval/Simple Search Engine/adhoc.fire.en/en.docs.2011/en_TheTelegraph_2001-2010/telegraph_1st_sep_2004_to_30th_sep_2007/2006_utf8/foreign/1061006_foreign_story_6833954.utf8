 US in stern warning to Korea

 Washington, Oct. 5 (Reuters): The US in its starkest warning so far said yesterday it would not live with a nuclear-armed North Korea, while Japan and other neighbours hardened their responses after the reclusive state announced it planned a nuclear test.

 We are not going to live with a nuclear North Korea, we are not going to accept it, US assistant secretary of state Chris Hill said. 

 He warned Pyongyang that it can have a future or it can have these weapons. It cannot have both.

 Hill spoke after a US defence official said the US had detected activity at potential test sites in North Korea, indicating possible preparations for a nuclear test. North Korea, which has said it has nuclear bombs, on Tuesday said it would conduct its first nuclear test.

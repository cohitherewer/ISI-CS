 Lohan too big to be called Teen Queen 

 Lohan: Grown up

 New York, Feb. 22 (AP): Lindsay Lohan doesnt want to be called a Teen Queen. 

 In an interview in the March issue of Allure magazine, now on newsstands, the 19-year-old says she wants to be considered a serious actress ? and rejects her youthful, party-girl image. 

 I hate it when people call me a teen queen, Lohan says in the interview. 

 Lohan, star of family friendly movies such as Freaky Friday and Herbie: Fully Loaded, has recently graduated to more grown-up roles, acting opposite Meryl Streep, Lily Tomlin and Tommy Lee Jones in Robert Altmans A Prairie Home Companion, due in theatres in June. 

 Shes also been working on Chapter 27, a film about the death of John Lennon, starring Jared Leto. 

 As for her days as a Skinny Girl, Lohan says: Sometimes being that thin doesnt look healthy. I kind of didnt realise that. 

 She dropped pounds from her shapely figure following a hospital visit last year, she says. 

 I lost weight when I was in the hospital, and then I wanted to keep it off. 

 It was an attention thing, too, she adds. (But) you start to wonder if your friends are your friends because you look a certain way. 

 Regarding her breakup with Wilmer Valderrama, Lohan tells the magazine: I know now that I dont need a boyfriend. 

 The past year felt like five lifetimes because Ive grown up a lot, she says. 

 I know better what to do and what not to do. I lost sight of the people and things that are most important to me.

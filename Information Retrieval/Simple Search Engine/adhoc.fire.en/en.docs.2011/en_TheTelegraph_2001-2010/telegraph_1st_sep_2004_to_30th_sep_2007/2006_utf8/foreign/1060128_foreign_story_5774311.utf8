 Storm over Manisha campaign

 Kathmandu, Jan. 27 (PTI): Bollywood actress Manisha Koirala, daughter of Nepals science and technology minister Prakash Koirala, has kicked up a storm here after she campaigned for a mayoral candidate for the February 8 municipal elections.

 In spite of the nationwide strike called by the seven pro-democracy parties, Manisha visited the Morang district election office in Biratnagar to file nominations on behalf of Binod Aryal, a former member of the Nepali Congress who is running for the post as an independent candidate.

 While her fans tried to catch a glimpse of Manisha, members of the Nepal Students Union shouted slogans against the actress.

 However, she remained unfazed. I am not scared of anybody protesting against me...I have come here all the way from Mumbai to get Aryal elected, she said.

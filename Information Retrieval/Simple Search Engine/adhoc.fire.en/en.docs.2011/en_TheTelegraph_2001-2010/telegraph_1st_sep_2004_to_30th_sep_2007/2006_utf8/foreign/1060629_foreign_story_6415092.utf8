 Boy George garbage

 New York, June 28 (AP): Boy George, garbage man.

 The one-time Culture Club singer will do five days of court-ordered community service as an employee of the department of sanitation, a spokesman for the city agency confirmed yesterday.

 He will be part of our team, said sanitation spokesman Keith Mellis. We wont know exactly what he will be doing for several weeks, though.

 The singer, whose real name is George Dowd, was ordered to do community service after pleading guilty in March to false reporting of an incident. He called police with a false report of a burglary at his lower Manhattan apartment last October, and the responding officers found cocaine inside. He became an icon in the 1980s with his androgynous appearance and vocals on hits like Karma Chameleon and Do You Really Want to Hurt Me?.

 Island wants e-identity back

 PHILIP SHERWELL 

 London, April 2: Niue, a Pacific island nation whose name means look, a coconut, is involved in a wrangle with an American entrepreneur over the control of its Internet suffix. 

 At first glance, the 2,000 islanders seem to have done well from the internet era ? theirs is the only nation in the world with free wireless access for all its citizens. But locals are unhappy that a US company controls their profitable .nu domain name under a deal agreed in the late 1990s. 

 Bill Semich, a former computer magazine editor, bought the rights to the suffix in 1998 for an undisclosed sum from the government of Niue, at a time when the islands politicians were little-versed in cyber-business. 

 Semich had hoped to market the domain to US companies as an alternative to dot.com. But he later found that nu means now in Swedish, a coincidence that has done wonders for his business, .NU Domain Ltd. 

 There are now 110,000 companies, 80 per cent of them in Sweden, that pay $30 a year for the .nu suffix. Examples of how the names translate include wakeup.now (for a Vicks Vaporub advertising site) and getupandjump.now (for a parachutists club). 

 Semich points out that, in 2003, his company voluntarily built towers across Niue to provide all its citizens with free wireless Internet. 

 But for some Niueans this was not enough. Discontent on the deeply Christian island was fostered in 2004 when it was revealed that .nu was also a common suffix for pornographic sites, although Semich denied any responsibility for the registration of the sites. 

 The row dominated last years elections, amid allegations of neo-colonialism and anger that the government no longer controlled a lucrative national asset. 

 Mititaiagimene Young Vivian, the premier, intends to meet Semich, who is based in Massachusetts, to hammer out their differences. Reasonable benefits should come to Niue, Vivian told The Wall Street Journal.

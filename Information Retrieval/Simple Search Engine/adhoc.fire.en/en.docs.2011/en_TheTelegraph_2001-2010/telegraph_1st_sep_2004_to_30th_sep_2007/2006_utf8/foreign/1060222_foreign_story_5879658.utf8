 Brussels, Feb. 21 (Reuters): The H5N1 strain of bird flu was confirmed in Hungary and Croatia today as the deadly virus spread around the globe, while EU officials considered measures to vaccinate millions of birds in France and the Netherlands.

 At least 15 nations have reported outbreaks in birds this month, an indication that the virus, which has killed more than 90 people, is spreading faster.

 Migratory birds are thought to be at least one way the disease is being carried and more than 30 countries have now reported cases since 2003, seven of them recording human infections.

 Hungary said today that tests showed the virus in three dead swans found last week, while Croatia also confirmed H5N1 had been found in a dead swan on an island in the Adriatic. Bosnia confirmed its first cases of bird flu yesterday, while Malaysia said the H5N1 avian flu virus killed chickens near the capital. 

 In Brussels, EU animal health experts met to consider requests from France and the Netherlands, among Europes biggest poultry producers, to be allowed to vaccinate millions of birds against avian influenza.

 The commission is considering plans that were submitted last night by the French and Dutch authorities, a European Commission official said.

 In London, the famous ravens at the Tower of London were brought inside to protect them from bird flu. Legend has it that if the ravens leave the Tower, where the Crown Jewels are stored, the kingdom will fall.

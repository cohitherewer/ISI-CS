 Astronauts plan fourth spacewalk

 Los Angeles, Dec. 18 (Reuters): Astronauts aboard the International Space Station readied for a fourth spacewalk to unstick a jammed solar array in an extra excursion that extended the space shuttle Discoverys mission at the orbiting outpost by a day.

 Astronauts Robert Curbeam and Christer Fuglesang will try to clear snarled guidewires that are preventing the 33 metre panel from retracting into a 50-cm-high storage box at its base. It has already retracted enough to allow the crew to successfully complete its primary mission of rewiring the space station.

 The fourth spacewalk is expected to last four to six hours.

 The stations robotic arm will boost Curbeam close to the panel where he can inspect and free grommets that are snagging on guidewires as the panel is reeled into the box.

 He will use tools wrapped in insulating tape to pluck at the guidewires, push on panel hinges and flip the grommets to try to unstick them as mission controllers slowly retract the panel by remote command. Fuglesang, posted at the base of the array, will if necessary, shake the array by hand to ease bunching in the solar blanket.

 Rivals find peace in the universe

 Los Angeles, July 22 (AFP): Peace reigns at least at the Miss Universe 2006 contest, where beauties Miss Lebanon and Miss Israel are the best of friends despite the fighting between the two countries back home, their companions said.

 The two women ? Gabrielle Bou Rached of Lebanon and Israels Anastacia Entin ? have struck up a friendship ahead of tomorrows tough competition to see who is named the worlds most beautiful woman.

 I think the perpetrators of the current West Asia crisis could learn a few lessons from Miss Lebanon and Miss Israel, who are the best of friends here, said Miss Germany Natalia Ackerman. The contest doesnt allow much room for warring, with contestants from 86 countries this year all crammed into the same hotel.

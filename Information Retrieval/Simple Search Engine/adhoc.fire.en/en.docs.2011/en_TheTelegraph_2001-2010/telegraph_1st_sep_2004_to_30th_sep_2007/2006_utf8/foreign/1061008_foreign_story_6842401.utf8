 Cartoon video

 Copenhagen, Oct. 7 (Reuters): Muslim leaders in Denmark today condemned video showing members of the anti-immigrant Danish Peoples Party (DPP) drawing cartoons mocking the Prophet Mohammad, but said they would not be goaded into taking action.

 Danish state TV yesterday aired amateur video footage showing a number of members of the youth wing of the DPP at a summer camp in August, drinking, singing and engaging in a competition to draw humiliating images of the Prophet.

 In September last year Danish daily Jyllands-Posten published cartoons, including one showing the Prophet Mohammad with a bomb in his turban. Muslim clerics denounced them as blasphemous, sparking protests early this year in which more than 50 people died in Asia, Africa and West Asia.

 Against the background of the problems earlier, we have to be careful, said Ahmed Abu-Laban, a Copenhagen imam who helped organise a trip to Egypt and Lebanon last year to rally support among Muslim leaders for protests against those drawings.

 This time its a different situation. Of course its deplorable, but we all know the attitude the DPP have toward Muslims and Islam and these pictures were never intended for publication, he said. Most Muslims regard depiction of the prophet as offensive. Abu-Laban said he regretted Danish TVs decision to air the footage saying it raised ethical questions. Weve been working very hard to resolve the problems since the conflict earlier this year.

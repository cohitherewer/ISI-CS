 Nato eyes Indian boots in war zones

 Nato secretary-general Jaap de Hoop Schaffer: Readjusting ties

 Nato Headquarters, Brussels, Sept. 22: The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, Nato, wants Indian troops for its missions in some of the most volatile regions of the world, including Afghanistan and Kosovo, diplomats and officials of the military alliance said here yesterday and today.

 Indian boots on the ground will be part of a wider engagement that Nato envisages with non-member states and the 26-member grouping of mostly North American and western European nations. 

 Natos engagement with India currently identified as a contact country to demarcate it from more intense relations connotated by the phrase partner country is a thought-through process. 

 The alliance does not expect Indian troops for its missions overnight but as a consequence of a protracted engagement that will drive policy change in Delhi and reforms within Nato itself. 

 The beginnings have been made at two levels. First, the Nato headquarters has conducted at least two briefings for Indian diplomats in Brussels. 

 The briefings were described as preliminary. Second, Nato secretary-general Jaap de Hoop Schaffer met Indian defence minister Pranab Mukherjee on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York on Tuesday. 

 The Nato secretary-general was said to have discussed Afghanistan and the security situation in South Asia. Speaking for the Nato headquarters, Simone de Manso said the discussions were good. 

 For Delhi, the beginning of an active engagement with Nato drives foreign policy into a super-charged environment. 

 First, India is a founder country of the Non-aligned Movement. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh returned from its latest summit in Havana, Cuba, only last week. 

 The NAM was so called to distinguish itself from Nato and Warsaw Pact (Soviet Bloc) countries. But with the Cold War now history, Nato itself has transformed into an alliance with global linkages that span across continents. 

 Second, in 2004 US President George W. Bush identified Pakistan as a major non- Nato ally to the chagrin of Delhi, and here now are the stirrings of a Nato relationship with India. 

 Third, Delhi will also have to consider a rewriting of its policy under which Indian troops deploy overseas only under UN mandates and as part of UN peace missions. 

 But Nato diplomats say mechanisms have been evolved that allow for non-member states to associate with Nato by marrying Nato deployments to UN mandates (Afghanistan and Kosovo, for example). 

 De Manso said the Nato secretary-generals meeting with Mukherjee was one of several bilateral talks on the sidelines of the General Assembly. 

 But the significance is that it was held as Nato prepares for the summit meeting of its heads of governments in Riga, Latvia, on November 28 and 29. Ministerial meetings leading to the summit are drafting an agenda in which associations with partner countries are likely to figure majorly. 

 Over yesterday and today, Nato diplomats at the headquarters and military officials at the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe an hours drive from here briefed a team of journalists, including The Telegraph correspondent, from South Asia. 

 Indian boots on the ground is one of not the only option of an engagement with Nato, a senior diplomat said. 

 Options envisaging Indian participation in Nato missions that figured during the briefings included: 

 Straight-forward deployment of an Indian military element alongside or as part of the International Stabilisation and Assistance Force (Isaf) in Afghanistan 

 Provision of assets such as transport aircraft or troop carriers for Nato deployments 

 Deployment with the Nato force in Kosovo to relieve some of the pressure on Nato member states whose militaries are overstretched with multiple missions, the officials and diplomats emphasised that in both Afghanistan and Kosovo, Nato military contingents were acting under UN-madated missions. 

 The officials cited the examples of Australia and Japan, South Korea and central Asian countries, who were not Nato members but were engaged with the alliance with boots on the ground. 

 The stirrings of Nato-and-Indian involvement come in the wake of frequent military interactions between India and the US over the last four years through joint exercises, reciprocal visits and dialogue. 

 In 2003, India rejected a US request to participate in stabilisation forces in Iraq (where Nato is involved only with a small military training contingent). 

 The India-US military engagements have often been officially described as drills in inter-operability a keyword that echoes at Nato headquarters and means the ability of militaries of different nations to act in consonance. 

 Second, the interest in India also comes when Natos military leaders are worried about force generation. In afghanistan right now, for instance, Nato is looking for a theatre task force, a reserve of upto 2,500 troops, as Isaf contingents deploy to the volatile south around Kandahar.

 Nato missions are vastly different from UN peace missions. One diplomat said we are much more robust a euphemism for aggressive, compared to UN peacekeeping and observation assignments. 

 Also and this will weigh heavily with Indian diplomats as they engage with Nato Nato member states and troop contributors fund and train their own contingents in military deployments. This is vastly different from UN missions for which troop contributors such as India are fully funded by the world body.

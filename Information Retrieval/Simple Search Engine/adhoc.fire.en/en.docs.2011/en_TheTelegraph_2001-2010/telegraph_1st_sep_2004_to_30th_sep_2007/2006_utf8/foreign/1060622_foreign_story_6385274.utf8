 Gates vision could help change world

 - from software to global issues

 Fresh energy: Bill Gates in Mozambique

 Melinda Moree met plenty of people who dismissed the prospects of a malaria vaccine. Then she encountered Bill Gates.

 No one had developed a human vaccine against a parasite like malaria before, and the monetary incentives simply did not exist for pharmaceutical companies to develop drugs targeted at poor children. Development would require cooperation among scientists, drug companies, health groups and international governments ? an alliance so large it didnt seem possible, she recalled someone telling Gates.

 Of course it is, Gates countered, according to Moree, now director of the PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative in Seattle, which along with other groups has received nearly $500 million from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to develop, test, manufacture and eventually distribute a malarial vaccine. Theres something about vision and belief that these things are possible, quot; Moree said.

 People in the non-profit world say Gates, 50, could fundamentally alter the methodology of philanthropy with his announcement last week that he will quit his day-to-day role at Microsoft Corp. in two years to spend more time on his foundation. He will take the same energy he once directed toward software technology to global health, education and other intractable issues, they say.

 Even as Microsoft is grappling with a changing competitive environment in which the software that Gates championed is losing ground to Internet-based services, the foundation is facing hurdles that observers say only Gates may be able to clear.

 The co-founder of Microsoft has given $25.9 billion of his personal wealth to the foundation and has pledged to give billions of dollars more to devote to several dozen specific programs, such as minority scholarships, clean water initiatives, updated computer systems in libraries and the development of a variety of vaccines. 

 The foundation has not been able to carry many of its projects through to completion because of the enormous logistical, political and commercial barriers inherent in distributing malarial vaccine to Africa, for example, and developing a vaccine against HIV and AIDS. Finishing those tasks requires political diplomacy, organisational efficiency, and monetary and human resources ? challenges that Gates may be uniquely positioned to take on as one of the most successful and driven businessmen of the era.

 A lot of the corporate foundations were born in the corporate style, but few have had someone of Gatess stature get involved personally in the execution of their programmes, said Sharon Oster, director of the Program on Social Enterprise at Yale University. Logistics ? getting vaccines into Rwanda quickly, for example ? will be a large part of what the foundation will need to do, and Gates will probably have to make hard decisions about which worthy causes are more deserving of his money, such as medicines, infrastructure or education, she said.

 Decisions about operational controls and investment are not new to Gates, Oster said, adding: There are also more complicated governmental issues, and certainly Microsoft has dealt with those. But this time Gatess enemy isnt another company ? its disease, mosquitoes, ignorance, political unrest. And vanquishing those requires a different approach to partnership, she said. It will require working with a disparate group of governments, other non-profit groups and companies that do not answer to him.

 As an ambassador for projects, Gates is likely to draw more funding and interest from other corporations, Moree said.

 113 killed in Black Sea air crash

 Moscow, May 3 (Reuters): All 113 passengers and crew on board an Armenian airliner were killed today when the plane crashed into the Black Sea off the Russian coast in heavy rain, the Russian emergencies ministry said.

 Investigators blamed it on bad weather. The Airbus A-320 had been trying to land at Sochi, a popular holiday spot in southern Russia. Justice officials said they had no reason to suspect a bomb.

 The ministry said rescue workers had found baggage, life jackets, pieces of wreckage and a patch of oil floating on the surface of the sea at the crash site. At least 39 bodies had been retrieved from the water by 0900 GMT, along with dozens of body parts.

 According to preliminary information, all people on board are dead, a ministry spokeswoman said. The plane, operated by Armavia, had been making a short flight of about an hour from the Armenian capital Yerevan. Most of the passengers were Armenian nationals.

 Scorn on Code

 London, April 16: The Archbishop of Canterbury today attacked societys obsession with books like The Da Vinci Code which, he said, encourage people to believe that the Christian faith is a series of conspiracies and cover ups. 

 Dr Rowan Williams said that there is a tendency to treat Biblical texts as if they were unconvincing press releases from some official source, whose intention is to conceal the real story, reports The Daily Telegraph. 

 Fascination with bringing secrets to light, he said, evoked All the Presidents Men, the 1976 film about the investigative journalists Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward, who exposed the Watergate scandal. 

 He also poured scorn on the recent discovery of a leather-bound papyrus written around 300AD believed to be The Gospel of Judas, which claims that it was Christ himself who asked Judas to betray him. 

 Robot mum 

 Vallejo (AP): Noelles given birth in Afghanistan, 

California and dozens of points in between. Shes a lifelike, pregnant robot 

used in increasing numbers of medical schools and hospital maternity wards. The 

full-sized, blonde, pale mannequin is in demand because medicine is rapidly abandoning 

centuries-old training methods that use patients as guinea pigs, turning instead 

to high-tech simulations. Noelle can be programmed for a variety of complications 

and for cervix dilation. She can labour for hours and produce a breach baby or 

unexpectedly give birth in a matter of minutes. She ultimately delivers a plastic 

doll. 

 Curse fraud 

 Moscow (Reuters): Russian police are looking for two mystics who persuaded a student of Moscows elite State Institute for International Affairs to part with more than $160,000 in exchange for lifting a curse, RIA news agency has reported. Two unknown women, on the pretext of lifting a curse, stole $150,000 and some jewellery by means of deception. The total amount stolen is estimated at 4.48 million roubles ($161,800), a police officer said. Many Russians are highly superstitious. They spend huge sums each year on faith healers and alternative medicine.

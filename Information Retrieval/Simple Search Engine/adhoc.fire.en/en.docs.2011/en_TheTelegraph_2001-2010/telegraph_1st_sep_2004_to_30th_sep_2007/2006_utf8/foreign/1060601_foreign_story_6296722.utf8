 New leads in Diana crash probe

 Diana: Story continues

 London, May 31 (Reuters): The detective leading a British investigation into the death of Princess Diana said he has found new witnesses and fresh forensic evidence about the fatal car crash in a Paris road tunnel in 1997.

 Sir John Stevens, a former chief of Londons Metropolitan police who is heading a crash inquiry, refused to give details.

 He was speaking during an interview at a literary festival in southern England where he is launching a book. His comments were reported by British media today.

 A spokeswoman at Londons Scotland Yard police headquarters confirmed fresh evidence had emerged. As would be expected, new witnesses have been spoken to and new forensics have been considered as part of the continuing investigations, she said.

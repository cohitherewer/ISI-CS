 Ruckus ride

 London, May 10 (Reuters): A German cyclist who rode 539,015 km in almost 44 years on the same bike and then had it stolen in Britain, celebrated today after it was recovered.

 Heinz Stucke had just arrived in Portsmouth, southern England, on the latest leg of a global cycle ride which he began in 1962 when thieves stole his bike as he slept in his tent.

 Distraught, he told the Portsmouth News: I would do anything to get my bike back, Im emotionally attached to it.

 However, today he was rejoicing. Stucke told BBC News that he was rejoicing after police told him the bike had been found abandoned in a park. I expected it to be found, because its not a flashy one, its not an expensive one, he said.

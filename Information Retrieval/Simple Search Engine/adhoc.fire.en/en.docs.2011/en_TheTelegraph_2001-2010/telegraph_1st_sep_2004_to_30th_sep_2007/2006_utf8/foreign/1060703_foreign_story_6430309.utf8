 Zarqawis talks of US angle 

 Rome, July 2 (AFP): Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the head of al Qaida in Iraq, was sold to the Americans because he became too powerful, his wife Um Mohamed said in an interview published today.

 My husband had become too powerful and he was no doubt bothering someone, she told Italian newspaper La Reppublica. His growing power and the consensus he achieved between the most radical groups cost him his life. 

 Mohamed claimed he was the victim of a secret pact between Iraqi resistance fighters, the leaders of al Qaida and the US secret services.

 In return, the Americans agreed to slow down their search for bin Laden,she added. 

 Mohamed, who was described as a Jordanian, said the pact had been reached with the Sunni tribes charged with protecting Zarqawi, with the Jordanian secret services.

 Zarqawis remains have been buried in Iraq in a secret grave, officials said.

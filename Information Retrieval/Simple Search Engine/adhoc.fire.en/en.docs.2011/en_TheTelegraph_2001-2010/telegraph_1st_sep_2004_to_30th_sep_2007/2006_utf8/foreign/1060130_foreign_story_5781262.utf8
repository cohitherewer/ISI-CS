 Chorzow, Poland, Jan. 29 (Reuters): Poland said today 66 people were killed when the snow-laden roof of an exhibition centre staging an event for international pigeon enthusiasts collapsed in the countrys worst disaster in almost two decades.

 After a night in which temperatures reached minus 15-degree Celsius, rescue workers began winding down their search for survivors among the rubble.

 President Lech Kaczynski said the death toll from yesterdays disaster in the southern city of Chorzow was unlikely to rise. According to current data, which should not change, there were 66 fatalities in the disaster, including two children and two foreigners, Kaczynski said.

 About 150 people were injured when the metal roof of the modern building, the size of a soccer field, collapsed during a packed gathering of pigeon enthusiasts from across Europe.

Kaczynski said 128 people were still in hospital.

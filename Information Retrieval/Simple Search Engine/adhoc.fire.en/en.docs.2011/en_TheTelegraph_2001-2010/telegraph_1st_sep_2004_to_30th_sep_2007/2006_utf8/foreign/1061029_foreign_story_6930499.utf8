 Cheney defence

 Washington, Oct. 28 (Reuters): Vice-president Dick Cheney said today he was not referring to water boarding or any interrogation technique in a radio interview, after critics accused him of endorsing simulated drowning by agreeing that a dunk in water for terrorism suspects might be useful.

 His wife Lynne and President George W. Bush defended his comments to the radio station after human rights groups criticised him as approving water boarding.

 Returning from a day trip to Missouri and South Carolina yesterday, Cheney told reporters on board his plane no one used the term water boarding in the radio interview and he had not been discussing any specific technique.

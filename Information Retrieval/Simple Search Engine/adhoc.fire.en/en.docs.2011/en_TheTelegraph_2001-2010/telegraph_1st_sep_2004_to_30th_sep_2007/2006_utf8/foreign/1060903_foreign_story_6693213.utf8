 Lahore, Sept. 2: A 12-year-old Scottish-Pakistani girl at the centre of a custody battle told a Lahore court today that she wants to remain in Pakistan with her father. 

 Molly Campbell, whose Muslim name is Misbah Rana, signed a statement saying she arrived in Pakistan from Scotland on August 26 under her own free will. I was not kidnapped, I have arrived in Pakistan to live with my father, the girl said in the statement presented to the court, according to lawyer Mohammed Basit.

 The judge, Amir Javed Rana, awarded custody to the girls father, Sajad Ahmed Rana, until September 6, when a hearing will be held to decide guardianship and give time for her Scottish mother to attend.

 The judge also ordered that notification of the upcoming guardianship hearing be passed on to the British Consulate in Lahore.

 According to Molly Campbells mother Louise, the girl was abducted by her father from their home in Stornoway, the principal town in the Outer Hebrides Islands on August 25. 

 The girls father visited Stornoway on August 24 and departed later for Glasgow. The following day, the girl was met at her school by her elder sister, Tahmina, and they flew from Stornoway to Glasgow before boarding a flight to Lahore.

 However, the Dawn newspaper in Pakistan quoted Louise Campbell as saying that Molly was abducted by her father Sajad Ahmad Rana for a forced marriage.

 Scottish police, who have said the case could be a violation of the Child Abduction Act, have completed their investigation and filed a report to prosecutors, who will determine whether to take further action.

 Mohammed Sarwar, a British MP from Glasgow of Pakistani descent, met Molly and her family yesterday. There is no question of such a marriage, as the girl herself and her family have denied anything like that, he told the Dawn newspaper.

 Quoting Molly, Sarwar said that she had come to Pakistan of her own free will and her father never abducted her. 

 The MP, who volunteered to resolve the issue, said nobody had forced Molly to leave Britain. He added that Mollys father had also offered to take Molly back to the UK if she so desires. 

 I asked Molly whether she would like to get back to her mother, but she simply refused, said Sarwar, who is very popular in Pakistan for vigorously advancing the cause of Kashmiri Muslims. 

 Sarwar said Molly was happy to be with her father, brother and sister. Molly has decided to live in Pakistan permanently, he added.

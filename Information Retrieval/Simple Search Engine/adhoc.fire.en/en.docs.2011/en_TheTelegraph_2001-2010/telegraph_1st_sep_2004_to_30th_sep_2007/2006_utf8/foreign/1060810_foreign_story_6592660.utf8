 Men ditch the groomed look

 London, Aug. 9: Modern men are ditching the carefully-groomed culture of David Beckham in favour of a more rough-and-ready Rooney look, a study has found.

 Despite the rise of metrosexual fashion symbolised by the sarong-and-jewel-wearing Beckham, men appear to be reverting to type, private medical insurer PruHealth said. 

 A study for the group by pollster YouGov found that little more than one in 10 men (12 per cent) now bothers to spend time on male grooming prac tices such as moisturising. 

 The study part of Pru- Healths Mens Health Awareness campaign found that 88 per cent of British men say they just shower and shave.

 Although the pattern was similar across the UK, with over 90 per cent of men in the Midlands, southern England, Greater London and Scotland rejecting elaborate preening, the news of the change appears to have come late in eastern parts. 

 One in five East Anglian men polled admitted to regularly cultivating a fake tan and/or waxing their body hair.

 Although the study did not provide comparisons with previous years, PruHealth interpreted the findings as indicating a decline in male grooming something it attributed to a Rooney effect.

 Dr Chris Dark, medical director at PruHealth, said: While fewer men plucking their eyebrows and using wrinkle cream is not a huge problem for society, there is one aspect of appearance which is more crucial keeping your body in shape by eating healthily and exercising regularly.

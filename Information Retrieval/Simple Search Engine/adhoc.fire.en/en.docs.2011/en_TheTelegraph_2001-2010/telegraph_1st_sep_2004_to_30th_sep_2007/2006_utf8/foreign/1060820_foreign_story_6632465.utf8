 Forget bombs, Snakes is here

London, Aug. 19: Forget tubes of toothpaste. 

Forget suntan lotion. Forget even swivel-eyed Muslim ideologues clutching copies 

of the collected statements of Osama bin Laden. The real threat to anyone planning 

to board a plane is snakes.

 Thousands of them, from skinny little rattlesnakes to a 91-kg Burmese python, are the stars of this summers most talked-up B-movie: Snakes on a Plane. 

 The $30 million thriller stars Samuel L Jackson, a plane and hundreds of boas, pythons and cobras 

 The film, originally called Venom, and then Pacific Air 121, has been the subject of countless fan-boy blogs, chat-board gossip and viral marketing strategies since the start of the year. Even in Britain. it has been hard to switch on the TV or catch a bus without seeing advertisements for this modern-day version of a shocker.

 For all the excitement and feverish speculation, until yesterday no one had any idea about whether it was any good or not. In fact, most people assumed it would be a howling, crashing disaster, not least because New Line, the American company that pumped $30 million into making the thriller, had gone out of its way to ensure that no critic on either side of the Atlantic got a sneak preview before its release.

 The official reason was that this was a peoples film, one whose surrounding buzz, as well as some of its dialogue, came from geeks and enthusiasts. Usually, when studios deny critics access, as they did earlier this year with The Pink Panther, it is an admission that they have sunk a fortune into an execrable work. Surprise, surprise: Snakes on a Plane turns out to be a hoot. 

 More fun than Airport, less infantile than Airplane!, its a wittily scripted, fitfully scary, largely unironic slice of superior hokum that, in this summer of bloated would-be epics, has the wisdom not to outstay its welcome.

 Directed by David R Ellis, a man whose less than exalted track record includes Final Destination 2, its a clever distillation of horror flick, martial arts pic and disaster movie (think Titanic at high altitude). 

 The plot is contained in the title. A Hawaiian drugs boss, desperate to stop a witness to one of his executions being transported to LA to testify against him, arranges for boxes of boas, pythons and cobras to be smuggled into the hold of a plane and sprayed with pheromones that drive them crazy and eager to attack the passengers.

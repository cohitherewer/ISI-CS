 Blunder tag on UK cops

 BEN LEAPMAN AND ADAM LUSHER

 London, June 11: The two brothers freed without charge after they were held for a week as terrorist suspects in Britain could receive ?500,000 in damages as a result of their ordeal.

 Mohammed Abul Kahar, 23, and Abul Koyair, 20, were released after police found no trace of a chemical device which an informant had claimed was at their home in Forest Gate, east London.

 The Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) has called on Tony Blair to welcome the mens release, following the Prime Ministers comment last week that he supported the police 101 per cent.

 Lawyers said that Kahar, who was shot in the shoulder when he was arrested in a raid involving 250 police officers, could receive upwards of ?30,000 for his injuries. The brothers could seek at least ?200,000 each in libel damages over accounts of their arrest that emerged from police sources.

 Mark Stephens, a media lawyer of the law firm Finers Stephens Innocent, called the shooting an expensive mistake.Much of the information that has come out has clearly been dis-information. It can only have come from officers who have breached the police disciplinary code, he said.

 Shami Chakrabarti, the director of the civil liberties group, Liberty, said: The trust we all need to build is undermined by the briefings to the press about chemical weapons. We need to ask, Where was that coming from?

 Privately, however, senior officers maintained that they still believed their intelligence was grounded in fact, and said the hunt for a home-made device would continue.

 Critics said the affair had damaged relations between Muslims and the police, making anti-terrorism operations more difficult.

 The case has piled fresh pressure on the Metropolitan Police commissioner, Sir Ian Blair. He is awaiting the Crown Prosecution Services verdict as to whether any of his officers will face prosecution over the fatal shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes, an innocent Brazilian, last July.

 Visiting Forest Gate yesterday, Dr Muhammad Abdul Bari, the new secretary-general of the MCB, said the raid had caused considerable unease in the Muslim community, while Blairsendorsement of the police had left many Muslims unhappy.

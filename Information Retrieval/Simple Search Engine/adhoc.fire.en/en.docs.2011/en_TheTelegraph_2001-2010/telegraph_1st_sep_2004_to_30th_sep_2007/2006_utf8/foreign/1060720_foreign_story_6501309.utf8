 5511 Pak madarsas registered

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Islamabad, July 19: The Pakistani government has secured the registration of 5,511 madarsas since a new law came into force in August last year making it compulsory for the schools to be registered and their accounts audited.

 President Pervez Musharraf was also informed about the registration of the madarsas at a meeting of the National Security Council yesterday, an official said in Islamabad.

 The crackdown on the madarsas gained momentum in July last year after the British government named three London bombing suspects who had links with the religious schools in Pakistan.

 The government also deported 487 foreign students last year who were studying in Pakistani madarsas without a no objection certificate (NOCs) from their respective governments. The government also plans to deport 784 students who did not have the certificates.

 Rapists hanged

 Three men found guilty of gangraping a woman were hanged in Lahore. The men had raped the woman in the nearby town of Sheikhupura in front of her family.

 Cheney war

 Moscow, 

 May 5 (Reuters): A speech by US vice-president 

 Dick Cheney strongly critical of the Kremlin marks the start 

 of a new Cold War that could drive Moscow away from its 

 new-found western allies, the Russian press said today.

 In shocked reaction to the harshest US criticism of Moscow for years, commentators said Washington had created an anti-Russian cordon of western-aligned states stretching from the Baltic almost to the Caspian Sea. The Kremlin, in a reaction within hours of Cheneys delivery in Vilnius, said the speech, which was full of accusations that Moscow was limiting human rights and using its energy riches to blackmail the world, was completely incomprehensible.

 The Russian press compared it to a 1946 speech by British statesman Winston Churchill in Fulton, Missouri, when he said an Iron Curtain was dividing eastern Europe from the free world.

 Enemy at the Gates. Dick Cheney made a Fulton speech in Vilnius, said business daily Kommersants front page headline. US vice-president Dick Cheney made a keynote speech on relations between the West and Russia in which he practically established the start of the second Cold War ... The Cold War has restarted, only now the front lines have shifted, it said. Washington and Moscow have largely ignored differences since the hijacked airliner attacks on US buildings in September 11, 2001, and concentrated on joint interests in the wars against international militant groups.

 Migrant rush

 London, Nov. 2 (Reuters): The British population rose by 500 people a day in 2005 as the number of new immigrants dwarfed the total leaving the country, official figures showed today.

 The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the net migration total for last year was 185,000, down from 223,000 in 2004. The ONS said 12 per cent, or 49,000, of migrants to Britain came from Poland, the biggest proportion from any single country. India came a close second, accounting for 11 per cent.

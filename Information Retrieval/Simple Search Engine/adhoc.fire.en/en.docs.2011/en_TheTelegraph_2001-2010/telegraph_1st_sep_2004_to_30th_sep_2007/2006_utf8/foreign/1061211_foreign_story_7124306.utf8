 Kate slams size-zero fashion trend

 Disturbing 

 trend 

 London, Dec. 10 (AP): Hollywood star Kate Winslet said today she finds the current fashion for ultra-thin size zero models and actresses unbelievably disturbing.

 Its so disturbing because young girls are impressionable from 11 up to 19 or 20 even; women are very impressionable at those ages, Winslet told British Broadcasting Corp. televisions Sunday AM programme.

 Theyre trying to figure out who they are, and they want to be loved, and what I resent is that there is an image of perfection that is getting thinner and thinner, and its truly upsetting to me.

 Stick-thin celebrities such as Nicole Richie and Victoria Beckham have been accused of being poor role models for young women and of contributing to a rise in eating disorders. A major fashion event in Madrid banned ultra-thin models from the catwalk earlier this year, and other fashion shows have indicated they plan to do the same.

 Winslet, whose films include Titanic and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, said it was unbelievably disturbing whats going on at the moment.

 The British actress, whose latest film is seasonal romcom The Holiday, said she refuses to allow any magazines featuring the rake-thin models into her house for fear her 6-year-old daughter, Mia, will see them.

 Its only a matter of time before she becomes aware of it, and it frightens the life out of me, she said.

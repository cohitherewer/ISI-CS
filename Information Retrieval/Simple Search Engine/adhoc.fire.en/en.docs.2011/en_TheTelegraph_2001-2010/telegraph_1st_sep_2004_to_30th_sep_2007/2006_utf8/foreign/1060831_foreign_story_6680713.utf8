 Stellar blast

 London, Aug. 30 (Reuters): Teams of international scientists have used observations from Nasas Swift satellite and other telescopes to witness the evolution of a cosmic blast into a stellar explosion or supernova.

 The blast is thought to be a milder type of gamma-ray burst (GRB) the most powerful type of explosion known to astronomers called an X-ray flash. It is known as GRB060218 after the February 18 date it began in the constellation of Aries about 440 million light years away. A light year is about 10 trillion km, the distance light travels in a year.

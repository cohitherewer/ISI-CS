 Heathrow cancels flights

 London, Aug. 12 (AP): Londons Heathrow Airport canceled one-third of flights due out this afternoon and night, blaming strict new security regulations for problems which caused some passengers to miss flights.

 Whilst the need for this action is extremely regrettable, it is the only way that services at Heathrow can continue to return to normal operations, said BAA plc. It said cancellations would hit departures between 7.30 pm (IST) and 5 am (IST).

 Smoking tied to early death

 New York, March 21 (Reuters): Cigarette smoking strongly increases the risk of dying in middle age for both men and women, but kicking the habit, even at older ages, strongly decreases the risk of dying prematurely. 

 These are the findings of the largest and longest study to date on smoking habits and consequences. The study is published today in the Annals of Internal Medicine.

 Among nearly 50,000 residents of rural Norway who were followed for 25 years, researchers found that 41 per cent of men who continued to smoke heavily (at least one pack a day) died between 40 and 70 years of age compared with just 14 per cent of men who never smoked. Twenty-six per cent of women who were heavy smokers died between 40 and 70 years of age compared with only 9 per cent of women who did not smoke.

 Our study shows that smoking strongly reduces the chances of surviving from 40 to 70 years of age, write Dr Stein Emil Volsett of the University of Bergen.

 There is a clear dose-response relationship between smoking and mortality ? survival decreases with increasing number of cigarettes smoked per day, they note.

 The study also shows that the longer people delay smoking, the less likely they are to die from smoking at an early age, a finding that supports efforts to target smoking prevention efforts at adolescents and pre-adolescents.

 Moreover, the sooner a smoker quits the better ? and its never too late to quit. While the benefits of quitting are greatest for those who quit before their 40th or 50th birthday, people who quit at older ages (between 50 and 59 years of age) also enjoy better health.

 Copenhagen, Feb. 11 (Reuters): Denmark said today it had withdrawn diplomats and staff from Indonesia and Iran because of security threats, while Muslims held demonstrations in European cities over cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad.

 The diplomats departure follows that of Danish embassy staff in Syria who left yesterday on the grounds that the security provided by Syrian authorities was inadequate.

 Denmark has been the target of protests in Islamic countries since cartoons of the Prophet, first published in the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten in September, were reprinted by other European newspapers in January.

 French police estimated that 7,200 people took part in a march through central Paris, waving banners and chanting, but the atmosphere was peaceful and many families took part.

 Frances Muslim Council had urged the countrys five million Muslims to stay calm. The council had tried in vain to block the satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo from reprinting the cartoons earlier this week. 

 Late India reaction

 In a late reaction to the events that have shaken the world for over a week, New Delhi said attempts to hurt the religious sentiments of the people should be avoided, reports our special correspondent.

 An official spokesperson said: India is deeply concerned about the growing controversy over the publication of cartoons that offended the Muslim community the world over. Anti-Denmark protests were held in several Indian cities with the biggest rally taking place in Srinagar.

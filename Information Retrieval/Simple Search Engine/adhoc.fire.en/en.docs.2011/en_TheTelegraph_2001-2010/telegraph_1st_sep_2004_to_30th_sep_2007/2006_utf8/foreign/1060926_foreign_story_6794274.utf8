 Pak not a banana republic: Pervez 

 Islamabad, Sept. 25 (Reuters): Scoffing at rumours that he had been overthrown in a coup while visiting the US, President Pervez Musharraf said Pakistan was not an unstable banana republic.

 Independent television channel Geo News today showed the President smiling and laughing with journalists in the US as he scotched speculation that he had been toppled.

 It is a nonsense. What should I say about this. Look we arent, thank God, a banana republic, where such things happen suddenly, said Musharraf, who came to power himself in a bloodless military coup seven years ago.

 The coup rumours swept Pakistan yesterday during a power outage that blacked out large parts of the country, including Islamabad, the neighbouring garrison city of Rawalpindi and Lahore.

 Ive been told the power breakdown was in Ghazi Barotha, and these rumours surfaced due to this. As if a power breakdown is needed to create such disturbance? Musharraf joked, as he stood alongside his wife.

 Newspaper offices and journalists were flooded with telephone calls and text messages inquiring about the rumours, eventually forcing information minister Mohammad Ali Durrani to issue a denial.

 Believing the rumours were true, tribesmen in North West Frontier Province fired in the air to celebrate.

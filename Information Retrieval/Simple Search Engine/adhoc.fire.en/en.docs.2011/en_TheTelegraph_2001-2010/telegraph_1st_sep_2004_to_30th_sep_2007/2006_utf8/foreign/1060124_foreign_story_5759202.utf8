 Pasadena (California), Jan. 22 (Reuters): NBCs acclaimed White House drama The West Wing will conclude its seven-year run in May ? as had long been expected ? after languishing through a steep ratings decline in recent seasons, the network said yesterday.

 In formally announcing plans 

 to bring the series to a close on May 14, NBC entertainment 

 president Kevin Reilly stressed the shows fate was 

 strictly a matter of TV democracy ? West Wing simply 

 failed to draw enough viewers. 

 The programme, starring Martin Sheen as fictional US President Josiah Jed Bartlet, won the Emmy Award as best TV drama four years in a row.

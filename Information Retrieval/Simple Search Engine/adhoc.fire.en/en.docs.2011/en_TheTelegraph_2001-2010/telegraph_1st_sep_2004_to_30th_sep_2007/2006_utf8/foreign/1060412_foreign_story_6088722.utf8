 Madonna marriage

 London, April 11 (AP): Madonna and Guy Ritchie have retreated to Los Angeles where they are patching things up after a bumpy period in their marriage, her father-in-law says in a magazine interview released on Tuesday.

 LA seems to have helped them. Its easier out there because there is less pressure. They seem to have left the bumps they were having over here behind them, John Ritchie was quoted as saying in an interview with Closer magazine. The couple have a son, Rocco, 5, and the singer also has a daughter, Lourdes, 9.

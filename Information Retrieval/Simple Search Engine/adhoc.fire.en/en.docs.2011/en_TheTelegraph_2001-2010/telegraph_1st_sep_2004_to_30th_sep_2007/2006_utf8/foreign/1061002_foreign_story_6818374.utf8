 Israels Lebanon pullout almost over

 Zarit (Israel), Oct. 1 (Reuters): Israels army withdrew from all of south Lebanon except a small border village today, as part of a handover to the Lebanese army and UN peacekeepers under a ceasefire deal that ended a war with Hizbollah fighters.

 Crossing the frontier without fanfare before sunrise, Israeli troops padlocked the border gate at Zarit, close to where Iranian-backed Hizbollah fighters seized two soldiers on July 12 before the conflict with US ally Israel erupted.

 The IDF (Israeli army) have withdrawn their troops from the south, except from the area around the village of Ghajar, UN Interim Force in Lebanon (Unifil) commander Major General Alain Pellegrini said in a statement.

 I expect that they will leave this area in the course of the week, thus completing the withdrawal in line with the (UN) Resolution 1701, he said.

 Villagers in south Lebanon were delighted to see the troops go but there were few signs of celebration. Most are preoccupied with rebuilding their battered villages and shattered lives.

 They had the Israeli flag on my roof. When I arrived, I put up the Lebanese flag, Saleh Mohammad, 50, said.

 No clear victor emerged in 34 days of fighting in which Hizbollah, challenging West Asias mightiest army, fired nearly 4,000 rockets into the Jewish state and Israel hit the groups strongholds. Around 1,200 Lebanese, mostly civilians, and 157 Israelis, mostly soldiers, died.

 Israel sent 10,000 troops into south Lebanon before a truce took hold on August 14.

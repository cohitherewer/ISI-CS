 Jakarta, July 20: A minister strongly criticised for failing to give warning of a tsunami that claimed at least 530 lives and left 270 missing, yesterday tried to excuse Indonesian government failings by saying that text messages had been sent alerting officials.

 Kusmayanto Kadiman, the science and technology minister, said Indonesia had received the tsunami alert from early warning centres in Hawaii and Los Angeles, but admitted that we did not announce them.

 If it [the tsunami that struck the coast of Java on Monday] did not occur, what would have happened? he had said in a television interview.

 But in a subsequent interview yesterday, Kadiman appeared to back away from his admission that no warning was given, telling el-Shinta radio that the meteorological agency sent text messages, or SMS, to at least 400 officials. But he did not say whether the actions were taken before the tsunami hit, or whether the 400 officials lived on the threatened coastline.

 Moreover, with no warning sirens or alarms on the beaches, getting the message to significant numbers of residents and tourists would have been almost impossible. The under-sea earthquake was not felt by most people on the beaches. The first most of them knew of the wave was when they heard screams of tsunami. tsunami.

 The Jakarta Post said in an editorial yesterday that the disaster agency had done nothing of note to increase peoples preparedness for disasters.

 Despite losing 170,000, in the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami, Indonesia has failed to establish an early warning system for Java, its main island.

 Mondays tsunami was triggered by a magnitude 7.7 earthquake and smashed into a 110-mile stretch of Java islands coastline, which was unaffected by the 2004 tsunami. Waves at least 2 metres high reached 182 metres inland in some places, destroying scores of houses, restaurants and hotels. Cars, motorbikes and boats were left mangled in fishing nets, furniture and other debris.

 Thousands of Indonesian survivors were terrified again yesterday as the coast was rattled by up to four strong earthquakes.

 Ill be sleeping in the mountains tonight because Im still afraid that there will be another tsunami, said Kang Ai, the owner of a seafood restaurant in Batu Keras beach.

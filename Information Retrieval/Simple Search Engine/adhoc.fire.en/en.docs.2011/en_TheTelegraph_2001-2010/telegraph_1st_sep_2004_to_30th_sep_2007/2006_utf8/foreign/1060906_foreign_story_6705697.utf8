 Pirates, other hits keep Hollywood afloat

 Los Angeles, Sept. 5 (AP): The Hollywood hand-wringing of 2005 has been forgotten. 

 After a dismal box-office year and gloomy prophecies about its future, the movie business has rebounded with a solid though far from spectacular summer season.

 Led by one of the biggest all-time hits, Johnny Depps Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Mans Chest, Hollywood will have rung up about $3.85 billion (euro 3 billion) in domestic ticket sales from the first weekend in May till Monday, up 6.3 per cent from the same period last year, according to box-office tracker Exhibitor Relations. Movie attendance was up about 3.1 per cent.

 If every year were like this, it would be fine, said Paul Dergarabedian, president of Exhibitor Relations. Hollywood will take solid over slump any day.

 In summer 2005, revenues declined 8.5 per cent and attendance tumbled 11.4 per cent compared to 2004.

 This summers revenues will come in about 2 to 3 per cent below those of 2004, a strong box-office season. This summers attendance will be down about 8 per cent compared to 2004.

 Last year brought continual bad headlines as the flop of the week hit theatres, with Hollywoods overall revenues down weekend after weekend. Analysts theorised that home theatres and other personal entertainment options were undermining cinema business.

 The great thing this year is it seemed like audiences found a picture they wanted to see every week and sometimes two. That didnt happen last year, said Jeff Blake, vice-chairman at Sony, which had summer hits this year with Tom Hankss The Da Vinci Code and Will Ferrells Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby.

 Clearly, there were some weekends last year where people would say: Lets not go to the movies.

 The opposite happened this year as most big films delivered, pulling in steady audiences. Overall movie revenues were up 14 out of 17 weekends this summer.

 I truly believe the axiom that lines beget lines. When youre on a roll, everything positive happens to you, said Chuck Viane, head of distribution at Disney, which released Pirates of the Caribbean and had a blockbuster with the animated comedy Cars.

 Last year, there was so much negative spin in the press and the minds of people, I think it created a mind-set. This year, everything started positive and its continued straight through.

 Pirates of the Caribbean raced past $400 million (euro312 million) domestically, only the seventh movie to top that mark. Cars, X-Men: The Last Stand and The Da Vinci Code all made it past $200 million (euro156 million), with Superman Returns at $196 million (euro153 million) and creeping toward that level.

 The first big-screen adventure for the Man of Steel since 1987s Superman IV: The Quest for Peace, Superman Returns drew huge audiences. But box-office analysts had expected it to do better considering how well other elite superhero franchises have done, such as Spider-Man and X-Men.

 Another underachiever was Tom Cruises Mission: Impossible III, which took in a respectable $133 million (euro104 million) but fell far short of the 1996 original ($181 million) and 2000s sequel ($215 million). 

 According to Steve Gilula, chief operating officer at Fox Searchlight: I think the public is more selective than ever. But the quality of movies this summer shows they still like going out to the theatre.

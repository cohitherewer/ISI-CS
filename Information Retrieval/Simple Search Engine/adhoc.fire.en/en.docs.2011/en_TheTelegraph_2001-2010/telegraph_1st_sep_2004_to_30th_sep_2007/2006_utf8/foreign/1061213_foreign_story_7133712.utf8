 Buy a house, get a gun free 

 Houston, Dec. 12 (Reuters): A Texas real estate agent looking to add more bang to her business is offering clients in law enforcement a free Glock pistol if they buy a home from her.

 Julie Upton, a Houston-area real estate agent, spurned traditional buyer incentives like free fuel cards or home improvement store gift certificates. Instead, she placed an advertisement offering a pistol with the purchase of any home worth at least $150,000 in the city police departments monthly publication, Badge amp; Gun.

 The free guns are only for those in law enforcement, said Upton, who is married to a police officer. We thought it would be a good way to entice other police officers, Upton said. And whether people want the gun or not, it has stirred up a lot of attention.

 Upton has given away two pistols to police officers who purchased homes from her. The guns cost about $500.

 And so far the advertisement has not generated negative attention from the anti-gun lobby, she said.

 In Texas, no licence is required to own a rifle, shotgun or handgun, but a permit is needed to carry a concealed weapon, according to the National Rifle Association.

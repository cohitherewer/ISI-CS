 Mistake to rule out 4th term: Blair

 Canberra, March 27 (Reuters): British Prime Minister Tony Blair sparked a fresh bout of conjecture over his future today when he said it may have been a mistake to rule out a fourth term.

 Newspapers also reported that Blair, facing media calls to resign over a cash-for-favours row, had decided when to stand aside but that he was not yet revealing the date.

 The Prime Minister, on a visit to Australia, was asked in an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corp if his determination not to seek another term was a mistake that had left him open to calls for his resignation.

 I think what happens when you get into your third term and you are coming up to your 10th year is that it really doesnt matter what you say, said Blair, in office since 1997.

 You are going to get people saying it should be time for a change or when are you going? or whos taking over?

 The announcement not to seek a fourth term was an unusual thing for me to say, but people kept asking me the question so I decided to answer it. Maybe that was a mistake.

 On the eve of a heart operation in 2004 and under pressure from the fallout of the Iraq war, Blair ruled out a fourth term but said he intended to serve a full third term.

 That could take him to 2010 but most commentators expect him to hand over to his presumed successor, finance minister Gordon Brown, in the next year or two.

 His spokesman said Blair was keen to carry on. The Prime Minister is focused on getting on with the business he was elected to get on with, he said. Several analysts believe Blair is particularly keen to see through reforms to the National Health Service, due by 2008.

 Some also think he wants to stay in office longer than Margaret Thatchers eleven and a half years, which would mean hanging on until the end of November that same year.

 The spokesman said Blair, seen by some as a lame duck, was interrupted by the interviewer. He did not say the preannouncement was a mistake, he did not say the pre-announcement had backfired. He simply said his hope it would kill the speculation had proven not to be the case, added the spokesman. 

 Some commentators think Blairs comments signal an intention to stay on until nearer 2010. Blairs authority, weakened by last Mays election where his majority was more than halved, has waned in the last few months.

 He has been defeated three times in parliamentary votes and has had to rely on the opposition to push through flagship education policies. A funding crisis in parts of the health service is also damaging, given the large amount of cash poured into hospitals.

 But most serious is the row over loans to his Labour Party.

 A controversy erupted after officials revealed it had received nearly ?14 million in loans from 12 businessmen, some of whom were subsequently nominated for seats in Britains upper parliamentary chamber.

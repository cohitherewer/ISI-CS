 Brolly veil

 London, Dec. 22: A veiled Muslim woman who refused to show her face in court because she would have to be questioned by a male barrister agreed to a very British solution a brolly, reports The Times newspaper. 

 Shereen Lohar, 21, was applying in the high court for a declaration of nullity over a marriage, which she said had been forced on her. Solicitors acting for Lohar had successfully applied to the family division for her case to be heard by a female judge, but Lohar refused to lift her veil because her barrister was a man. 

 The barrister, Teetha Gupta, came to the rescue of the case, which resulted in a successful application for a declaration that her marriage was invalid, by offering his umbrella as a screen. Lohar raised it so that her face was obscured from him, but was visible to the judge, Justice Macur.

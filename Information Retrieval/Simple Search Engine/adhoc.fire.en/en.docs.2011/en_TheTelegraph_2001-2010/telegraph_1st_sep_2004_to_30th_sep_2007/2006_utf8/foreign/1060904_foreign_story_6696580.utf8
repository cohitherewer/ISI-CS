 Islamabad, Sept 3: Pakistans government will unveil the details of a peace deal signed by local Taliban and members of a grand assembly of tribal elders in the countrys troubled North Waziristan region in the next couple of days, a tribal elder has said.

 Members of the assembly or jirga signed the deal with the local Taliban yesterday in Miran Shah, the administrative centre of North Waziristan. Miran Shah witnessed a series of anti-terror operations since early last year, carried out by the Pakistani security forces to track down al Qaida fugitives and remnants of the Afghan Taliban. 

 Over 200 suspected militants, mostly of Uzbek, Arab, Chechen and Afghan origin, were killed in these operations, which often coincided with the visits of senior US administration officials. More than 156 suspected foreign militants were killed a day before the visit of US President George W. Bush to Pakistan in early March.

 The agreement signed by at least 10 representatives of the local Taliban will ensure a permanent peace in this restive tribal region that border Afghanistans Khost province, Malik Nasrullah, the tribal elder and member of the jirga, said.

 The draft agreement will now be presented to North West Frontier Province governor Ali Muhammad Jan Orakzai, who will announce it in the next couple of days after it is ratified by government officials and the local Taliban.

 The government had formed the 45-member jirga in April for the accord. 

 The local Taliban recently agreed to extend the ceasefire till December 10 in North Waziristan following a series of meetings with members of the tribal assembly. The security forces, in return, released over 140 alleged militants. 

 The jirga mediated the release of more than 140 tribesmen on the demand of the militants and secured freedom for four personnel of the paramilitary Frontier Corps held by the militants, Nasrullah said. 

 The government released a fresh batch of 13 tribesmen on Friday. But it has not yet held out any assurance to abolish the existing military check posts in North Waziristan as demanded by the rebels.

 The talks between the government-sponsored assembly and the local militants went under way in the backdrop of concerns expressed by Pakistani leaders, including interior minister Aftab Sherpao, over the growing Talibanisation in the tribal areas, known as Federally Administered Tribal Areas, and consists of seven semi-autonomous regions, each called an agency.

 Pakistani daily The News said some of the hurdles in reaching an agreement were the militants demand for withdrawal of the army from North Waziristan, payment of compensation for human and material losses suffered by the tribesmen, including those associated with the militant groups, return of seized weapons and vehicles, and dismantling of all road checkpoints. They also want freedom for the remaining tribesmen, totalling more than a dozen. 

 Though the government officials and Loya Jirga members were tight-lipped about the terms of the proposed agreement, it was learnt that foreign militants hiding in North Waziristan would be given the option to stay there after furnishing guarantees of good conduct. Tribesmen will be allowed to go to Afghanistan for business and peaceful purposes only. 

 The Pakistan Army, it was learnt, would not man checkpoints and instead operate out of its bases and barracks. The militants would be compensated for their human and material losses and their remaining colleagues would be released.

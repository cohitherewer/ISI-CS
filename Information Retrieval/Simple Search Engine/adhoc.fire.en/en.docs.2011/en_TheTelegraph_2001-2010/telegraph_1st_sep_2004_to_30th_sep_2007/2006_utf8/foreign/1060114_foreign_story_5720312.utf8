 Iran threat to halt checks if reported

 Soltaniyeh: Committed

 Tehran, Jan. 13 (Reuters): Iran threatened today to halt snap UN inspections of its nuclear facilities if it is taken to the UN Security Council, but the US said the West would not be deflected from that course. 

 Its more of the same, kicking up sand, said a senior state department official who asked not to be named.

 It only demonstrates further that they are only intent on confrontation. They intend to face down the international community but we are going to continue to pursue a course to the Security Council, the official said.

 Britain said earlier the council would consider sanctions if Tehran defied international demands. The US and the EUs three biggest powers said yesterday that nuclear talks with Iran were at a dead end and Tehran should be brought before the Council. 

 Iranian foreign minister Manouchehr Mottaki said such a step would have consequences for the West and Tehran would have to end all its voluntary measures in response.

 Iran has repeatedly threatened to end snap checks and resume uranium enrichment if taken to the Council. Parliament passed a law in November requiring the government to respond in this way.

 Cooperating with snap UN inspections is voluntary on Irans part, under a protocol it has signed but not ratified. However, halting them would reduce Irans cooperation with the UN nuclear watchdog to the legal minimum.

 Irans new representative to the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Aliasghar Soltaniyeh, said Tehran remained fully committed to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and its statutory obligations to the IAEA.

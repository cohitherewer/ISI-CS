 Dan Brown book delay

 London, April 21 (Reuters): Dan Browns follow-up novel to his global bestseller The Da Vinci Code wont be ready by the end of the year as originally expected, his publisher said today.

 We dont know when its coming, but its out of the schedule for this year, said Larry Finlay, managing director for Transworld Publishers in London. At one point we were hoping for it around October or November, but now its looking like 2007, he said.

 The book, whose title and plot are as secretly guarded as the religious sects Brown writes about, remains unfinished, with Brown having been embroiled in a high-profile plagiarism lawsuit.

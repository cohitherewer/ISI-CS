 Baghdad, March 1 (Reuters): Former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein admitted today he had ordered the trial of Muslim Shias who were executed in the 1980s and said he had approved the razing of their farms.

 Saddam made the extraordinary confessions during his second day in court this week, where prosecutors read out documents, showed satellite images and played audio tapes in an attempt to link Saddam to the execution of 148 Shias after a 1982 assassination attempt on his life in Dujail.

 I referred them to the revolutionary court according to the law. Awad was implementing the law, he had a right to convict and acquit, Saddam said, referring to his co-accused Awad al- Bandar, the former chief of the Revolutionary Court.

 I razed them ... we specified the farmland of those who were convicted and I signed, Saddam told the court trying him for crimes against humanity. Its the right of the state to re-own or compensate. So where is the crime?

 Saddam said he ordered the razing of the farms because there had been an attempt on his life as his motorcade drove through the town during a visit in July 1982.

 Describing how gunmen fired machine guns on his vehicle, he said: I saw the bullets with my own eyes, I was sitting on the right side. The trial, which began in October last year, was adjourned until March 12.

 Saddam was mostly subdued as chief prosecutor Jaafar al-Moussawi laid out what he said was evidence linking Saddam to the Dujail case.

 A day after prosecutors presented what they said was a death warrant signed by Saddam for the 148 Shias, Moussawi showed more papers today ? this time, he said, showing the condemned mens trial had been a farce.

 Moussawi also showed aerial pictures of fields laid waste around Dujail and played an audio tape of Saddam in discussion with a Baath party official.

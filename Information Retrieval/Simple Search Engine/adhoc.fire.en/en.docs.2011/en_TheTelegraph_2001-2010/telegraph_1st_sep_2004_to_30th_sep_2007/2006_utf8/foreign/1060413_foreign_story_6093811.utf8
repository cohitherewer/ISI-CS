 Playboy pique

 Kuala Lumpur, April 12 (Reuters): An Indonesian maid posed in her underwear for pictures her female employer promised would appear in the Indonesian version of Playboy, but complained after receiving no payment, a Malaysian social group said today.

 Playboy magazine caused a stir at its launch in Indonesia last week. In exchange for a promise of 1,000 ringgit ($272), the woman took pictures of her 25-year-old maid in seductive postures while her family was away, the Star newspaper said.

 It was a joke by the employer, but the maid took it seriously, said M. Ganesha, head of a complaints bureau run by the Malaysian Indian Youth Council, to which the maid turned for help in getting payment.

 Kylie fest

 London (AP): Kylie Minogue has been asked to headline the 

Glastonbury music festival in 2007, two years after she cancelled her performance 

when she was diagnosed with breast cancer. Michael Eavis, a working farmer who 

stages the event in his own fields, said he has asked the Australian pop star 

to perform next summer. Kylie is coming back hopefully, Eavis said.

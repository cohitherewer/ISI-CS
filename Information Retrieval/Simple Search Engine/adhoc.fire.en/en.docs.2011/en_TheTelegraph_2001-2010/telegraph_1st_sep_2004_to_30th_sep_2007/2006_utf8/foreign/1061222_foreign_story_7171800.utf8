 250,000 passengers unscreened

 Ottawa, Dec. 21 (Reuters): A four-day protest by screening staff at Torontos international Pearson airport in October meant 250,000 passengers boarded aircraft without being searched properly, the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. said today.

 CBC quoted an internal transport ministry report as saying the lapse had severely compromised the travelling public. 

 It said the security screening process was circumvented...in some cases it was abandoned altogether.

 The problem arose after screeners working for a private security company began working to rule, hand-searching all carry-on bags and creating long lines.

 The screeners told the transport ministry that managers cleared the lines by allowing about 250,000 passengers to pass through with minimal or no screening. In a letter to the transport ministry, workers quoted their managers as asking: Why are you searching bags? They said the managers wanted us to rush through the screening procedures.

 The internal report said the managers action constituted a gross violation of pertinent legislation, CBC reported.

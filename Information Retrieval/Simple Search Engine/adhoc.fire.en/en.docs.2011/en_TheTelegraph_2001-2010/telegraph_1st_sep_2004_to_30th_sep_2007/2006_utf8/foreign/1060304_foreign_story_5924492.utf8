 Arroyo ends 7-day emergency

 Manila, March 3 (Reuters): President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo ended a week-long state of emergency in the Philippines today, as widely expected, after her security chiefs said the threat from coup plotters had receded.

 A Leftist Congressman and an army lieutenant face charges of rebellion, with prosecutors investigating complaints against five Left-wing lawmakers, three lieutenants and two retired soldiers.

 Many analysts suspected Arroyo of ramping up the alleged plot to allow security forces wider scope to target her enemies. They said that the crackdown would do little to stop power struggles among the elite or unite the restive military.

 Two small bombs exploded in Manila near the headquarters of an elite police team and a shopping area about 75 minutes before Arroyos taped announcement was broadcast, causing no casualties but briefly raising fears she might extend emergency rule.

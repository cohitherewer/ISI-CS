 Radiation detected on BA planes

 Gigantic task 

 London, Nov. 30 (Reuters): Britain is monitoring five planes for radiation in an ever widening probe into the poisoning of a former Russian spy that has heightened tensions with Moscow.

 British home secretary John Reid told parliament today that radioactive traces had been found at 12 out of 24 locations being checked by police and pledged there would be no political barriers to the probe.

 The Kremlin and Russias foreign spy service have denied any involvement in the death of Alexander Litvinenko, a former Russian spy who became an outspoken critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin. 

 Litvinenko, who became a British citizen while living in London, died in the capital a week ago after being poisoned with radioactive polonium 210.

 British Airways said three aircraft had been taken out of service as part of the probe. All had flown between Moscow and London, and one is still in Moscow.

 The airline said very low traces of a radioactive substance had been found on the two planes being held in London.

 Reid told parliament scientists were monitoring a fourth aircraft for possible contamination. The plane, a Boeing 737 leased by the Russian carrier Transaero, arrived at Londons Heathrow airport this morning, he said.

 Transaero spokesman Sergei Bykhal said the plane was being held in Britain for checks and that the company would cooperate fully with any official body.

 Reid said Britain was also interested in a fifth plane a Russian aircraft and there could be more involved. 

 The announcement about the planes and their destinations could rekindle suspicions of a Moscow link to the death of Litvinenko, who himself accused Putin of ordering his murder. In Moscow, Anatoly Safonov, President Putins counter-terrorism adviser, said: As we said before, we are open and willing to offer all the help needed.

 Russia has expressed at the highest levels the political will to cooperate in the fullest way in all aspects of this affair, Safonov said. 

 Reid told parliament that Moscow had promised cooperation to thehighest level and that British police would use all the powers they needed to search planes.

 In Britain, thousands of BA passengers sought health reassurances from the airline after the announcement. BA says the risk to health is low. But it faces a huge task tracing the 33,000 passengers who used the planes over a five-week period.

 Farm flu fears

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Islamabad, Feb. 27: Pakistani authorities have placed two farms in the North Western Frontier Province under quarantine after a suspected outbreak of bird flu in the country.

 Cases of low pathogenic avian influenza have been detected in two poultry farms in the NWFP, livestock commissioner Dr Afzal Ahmed said in Islamabad.

 The strain of virus has not been confirmed but initial tests pointed to a H5 subtype present at the two farms in Abbotabad, 125 km north of Islamabad, and Charsadda, 120 km northwest of Islamabad, he said. Tests for the N-subtype have still to be carried out.

 Afzal said there was no confirmation of any outbreak of the H5N1 virus but that samples were being sent to laboratories in Britain.

 Recent media reports suggested that the regional government had earlier refused to accept a ban on inter-provincial poultry movement as no birdflu case had been detected. A ban would cause colossal damages to the poultry business.

 People working on the farms had been tested and were not infected with bird flu, another agriculture ministry official.

 Our initial findings suggested that the outbreak is not from any migratory birds and it is not harmful for humans, he added.

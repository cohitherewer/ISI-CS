 Baby buzz around Jolie

 Jolie: Happy times

 Washington, Jan. 11 (Reuters): Angelina Jolie is pregnant with Brad Pitts child and is expecting this summer, People magazine reported today.

 Yes, Im pregnant, the U.S. entertainment magazine quoted Jolie as telling a charity worker in the Dominican Republic, where she is working on a movie.

 People magazine added that Jolies first pregnancy had been confirmed by representatives of both stars. Pitt, 42, divorced Jennifer Aniston in October after four and a half years of marriage.

 He had previously met Jolie, 30, on the set of their film Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith, but the couple played down rampant media speculation about their relationship, saying they were just friends.

 Last month, media reported that Pitt had filed legal papers in Los Angeles to adopt Jolies two adopted children, adding that this might be a step leading to marriage.

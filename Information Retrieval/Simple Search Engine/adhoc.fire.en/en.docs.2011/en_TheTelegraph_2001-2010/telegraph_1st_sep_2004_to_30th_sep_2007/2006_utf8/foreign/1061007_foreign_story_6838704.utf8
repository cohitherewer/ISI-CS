 Chemo can affect brain for 10 years

 Washington, Oct. 6 (Reuters): Chemotherapy causes changes in the brains metabolism and blood flow that can last as long as 10 years, a discovery that may explain the mental fog and confusion that affect many cancer survivors, researchers said today.

 The researchers, from the University of California, Los Angeles, found that women who had undergone chemotherapy five to 10 years earlier had lower metabolism in a key region of the frontal cortex.

 Women treated with chemotherapy also showed a spike in blood flow to the frontal cortex and cerebellum while performing memory tests, indicating a rapid jump in activity level, the researchers said.

 The same area of the frontal lobe that showed lower resting metabolism displayed a substantial leap in activity when the patients were performing the memory exercise, said Daniel Silverman, the UCLA associate professor who led the study.

 Experts estimate at least 25 per cent of chemotherapy patients are affected by symptoms of confusion, so-called chemo brain, and a recent study reported an 82 per cent rate, the statement said.

 50 Afghan civilians killed in Nato raids

 Kabul, Oct. 26 (Reuters): Nato warplanes killed at least 50 civilians, mostly women and children, in bombing in southern Afghanistan during a major Islamic holiday, local leaders said today.

 The incident happened on Tuesday during the Id-ul-Fitr festival in Panjwai, an area where the alliance said it had killed hundreds of insurgents in a two-week offensive last month.

 Nato says it killed 48 insurgents during heavy fighting in the area in Kandahar province, but had also received credible reports that several civilians were killed in the operation.

 The defence ministry has sent a team to investigate and President Hamid Karzai today appointed a special team of local elders to look at the case. It was late at night that might be the reason they didnt know where to bomb, said provincial assembly member Agha Lalai.

 Visiting the wounded in hospital, tribal elder Naik Mohammad said 60 civilians had died. Villagers also said 60 died, dozens were wounded and 25 houses razed in 4-5 hours of bombing.

 The United Nations mission in Afghanistan, UNAMA, today urged a speedy and thorough investigation.

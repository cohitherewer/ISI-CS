 Ghostly school

 London, Jan. 21 (AFP): One of Britains most haunted houses will become the countrys first ghost school, aimed at giving the public a chance to decide whether things really do go bump in the night.

 Muncaster Castle, an 800-year-old country pile in the scenic Lake District of northwest England, has been chosen for the two-day residential course because of its spine-chilling reputation for spooks and spectres.

 Braithwaite, a cognitive psychologist and neuroscientist from the University of Birmingham, grew up within 15 km of the castle and will run the course in March.

 A self-confessed sceptic about the paranormal, he said the idea was to teach people to apply genuine scientific skills so they can decide for themselves what lies behind phenomena that appear to have no rational explanation.

 Jewel bag

 Melbourne (AFP): A handbag containing jewellery worth more than $110,000 has been returned to a woman who left it hanging on a shopping trolley in a car park, Australian police said on Saturday. The handbag, containing gold bracelets, rings, earrings, chains and pendants ? plus a large sum of cash ? was handed in to police in Melbourne by another woman, who wanted to remain anonymous. The owner, who wanted to be identified only as Kathy, told said she was overwhelmed by the return of the bag and its contents. 

 Super shed

 Dublin (Reuters): Its about the size of a garden shed, has no electricity and a toilet with no sewage outlet. But such is Irelands property boom that the grandly named Neptune Cottage in county Wicklow has been put on the market for 120,000 euros ($145,100) ? all 18.6 square metres of it. They dont come up that often, which is why its generating so much interest, said Roisin Grady, an assistant at auctioneers Hassett (www.hassett.ie).

 Chirac flees meet in fury

 - President walks out of summit after Frenchman speaks in English

 Brussels, March 24 (Reuters): French President Jacques Chirac walked out of a EU summit briefly yesterday when the French head of the EUs industry lobby addressed leaders of the bloc in English.

 A French official said Chirac, foreign minister Philippe Douste-Blazy and finance minister Thierry Breton left the room when Ernest-Antoine Seilliere, head of the UNICE business lobby, switched from French to English at a summit session with the EUs so-called social partners ? employers and unions.

 Representing 20 million companies in 39 organisations in 33 countries, I will speak English, the language of business, the former head of the French employers organisation said.

 A UNICE spokeswoman said Seilliere began his speech in French before switching to the language of Shakespeare. 

 Chirac missed Seilliere urging leaders to resist national protectionism in order to avoid a negative domino effect in the EUs internal market, in a veiled criticism of France and others who have tried to block cross-border takeovers.

 Seilliere did not want to comment on the incident. He wishes to concentrate on the business message, a spokeswoman said.

 Chirac returned to hear another Frenchman, European Central Bank president Jean-Claude Trichet, address the leaders in French.

 Trichet, a former Bank of France governor, almost always speaks English at the Frankfurt-based ECB.

 English, French and German are the working languages of the 25-nation bloc, which has no single official language. All 20 languages of the member states are used at summits, ministerial meetings and in the European Parliament.

 French once dominated the EU, but English has overtaken it since the bloc expanded to take in Nordic countries in the 1990s and east European members in 2004.

 Paris has fought a rearguard battle to preserve French as a main working language in Brussels, sparing no expense to offer free or heavily subsidised language courses to officials and diplomats from the new member states as well as journalists.

 Nicolas Schmit, secretary of state for European affairs of Luxembourg, said other French-speaking leaders had not joined Chirac.

 With all the love I have for the French language, I think there are other problems, notably in France, he said.

 Today, Chirac said he had been so shocked to hear a fellow Frenchman speak English at that he had felt compelled to leave the room.

 I have to say I was profoundly shocked to see a Frenchman express himself in English at the (EU) Council table. Thats why the French delegation and myself walked out rather than listen to that, Chirac said. It is not just national interest, it is in the interest of culture and the dialogue of cultures. You cannot build the world of the future on just one language and, hence one culture.

 Youth job law

 Chirac today ruled out withdrawing a new youth employment law that has provoked mass demonstrations and sporadic riots as his Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin sat down with unions to discuss the crisis.

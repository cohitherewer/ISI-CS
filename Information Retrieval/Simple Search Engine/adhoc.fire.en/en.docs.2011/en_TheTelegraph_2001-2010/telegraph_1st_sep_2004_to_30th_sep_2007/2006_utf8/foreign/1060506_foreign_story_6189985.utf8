 CIA chief Porter Goss resigns abruptly

 Goss: Fresh twist

 Washington, May 5 (Reuters): CIA chief Porter Goss, assigned to rebuild the US spy agency after huge intelligence lapses over the September 11 attacks and Iraq, abruptly quit today after less than two years on the job.

 President George W. Bush gave no explanation for Gosss resignation, praising the former member of Congress from Florida for his candid advice. The announcement was made at a hastily arranged event in the Oval Office attended by Goss and John Negroponte, director of national intelligence.

 Porters tenure at the CIA was one of transition. Hes helped this agency become integrated into the intelligence community. That was a tough job. Hes led ably, Bush said.

 The CIA fell under a newly created director of national intelligence as part of reforms enacted after intelligence failures related to the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon.

 Some bureaucratic wrangling has resulted as the new intelligence arm sought to assert itself over the CIA and met some opposition from the veteran spy agency. Im confident that his successor will continue reforms that hes put in place and as a result, this country will be more secure, Bush said.

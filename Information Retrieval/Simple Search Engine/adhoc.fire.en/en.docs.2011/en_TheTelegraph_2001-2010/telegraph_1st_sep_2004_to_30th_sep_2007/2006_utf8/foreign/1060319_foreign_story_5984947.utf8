The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Will they, wont they?

 Pitt, Jolie: Suspense

Rome, March 18: The champagne is on ice, the 

paparazzi are lurking in the bushes and Lake Comos most luxurious hotel 

is a sea of white flowers.

 The only thing missing is the bride and groom ? or indeed the certainty that the happy couple will turn up.

 Como has been awash with rumours for months that Brad Pitt, 42, and Angelina Jolie, 30, would be married at the Renaissance era hotel Villa dEste at Cernobbio, with a reception afterwards at George Clooneys nearby lakeside residence, the Villa Oleandra at Laglio. Another rumour is that the wedding could be at the Clooney villa, where workmen were installing new spiked railings. 

 Giuseppe Salvioni, a spokesman for Simona Saladini, the mayor of Cernobbio, said that he believed that Hollywoods most celebrated couple were in Milan. But he had no information as to whether the marriage would actually go ahead.

 So thats that, then: no wedding after all, since in Italy couples have to publish the banns 30 days in advance. Well no, Signor Salvioni said: the 30-day rule does not apply to foreigners. Antonella Chiesa, speaking for the Villa dEste, said: We dont have any bookings under their or their agents names. 

But she added teasingly: Maybe thats because 

it will be an intimate celebration... in any case were ready to stage a 

wedding ceremony. Signora Saladini confirmed that the Cernobbio council 

had recently converted a small boat for wedding couples to use. Angelina 

is too tired, wedding postponed, ran the headline in Il Giornale, 

the Milan newspaper.

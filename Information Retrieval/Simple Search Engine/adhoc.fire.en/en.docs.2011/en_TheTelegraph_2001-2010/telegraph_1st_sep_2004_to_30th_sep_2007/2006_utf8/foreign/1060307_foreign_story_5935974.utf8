 Rich kid pockets

 London, March 6 (Reuters): British children have never had it so good, according to a study today which showed the average child receives over ?800 a year.

 Derived from various sources ? pocket money, the tooth fairy, cash at Christmas and birthdays ? the money accounts for ?7.2 billion of GDP, the Kids Pay Audit found.

 The research among over 3,000 parents of five to 16-year-olds found the main source of cash remains mum and dad, with childrens income closely reflecting that of their parents.

 Drunk bite

 Berlin (Reuters): A drunken hearse driver has been arrested in the western German town of Krefeld after biting a police officer taking him in for an alcohol test, police said on Monday. Police had called for a hearse at a funeral home to transport a body to the cemetery. The hearse driver had to hold onto everything he could find as he stumbled to the house, the police said. They decided to take the man to the station to test his blood alcohol level, but when they tried to get him out of their car he started a fight and bit an officer several times in the hand.

 Bolivia ire

 La Paz, Bolivia (Reuters): Bolivians have found a new reason to grumble about arch rival Chile ? the small five-stringed Andean guitar Chilean President Ricardo Lagos gave to Bono when the U2 played in Santiago last week. According to Bolivians, the charango is a uniquely Bolivian instrument and Lagos gesture has prompted a chorus of nationalistic complaint from ministers, musicians and newspaper editorials.

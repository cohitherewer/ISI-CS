 Fine Print

 Anonymous Depp

 New York, June 19 (AP): Johnny Depp says the medias perception of him as a European wannabe has been exaggerated, and that he just likes the anonymity of living in France.

 this weeks issue of Newsweek, the 43-year-old actor says life is simpler there. Ive always loved it there, he said. The phones dont ring as much. Movies are never brought up in conversation. Ill take the kids and well go out to the trampoline and the swing set, and well stop by the garden and see how our tomatoes are doing. You know, old-fart stuff. Good stuff.

 Its a sharp contrast to his early acting days when he became a teen idol starring on the TV series 21 Jump Street. Suddenly, you go into restaurants and people are pointing at you and whispering, he said. You feel spooked by it because that freedom of anonymity is gone. You never get used to that. 

 Depp, French actress-singer Vanessa Paradis and their two children split their time between homes in France and Los Angeles. 

 Bracing for baby boom

 Sydney (Reuters): Australian hospitals are bracing for a 

baby boom in July as expectant mothers try to delay imminent births to take advantage 

of a new welfare payment, researchers said on Monday. From July 1, a baby bonus 

paid to the parents for every new-born child will increase by A$1,000 ($740) to 

A$4,000. Economists said that after the baby bonus was introduced in July 2004 

about 700 births were delayed by a week to take advantage of the new payment.

 Support for Iraq PM to continue in office

 Baghdad, Feb. 12 (Reuters): Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari looked set to keep the top job in Iraqs new government today after his ruling Shiite bloc nominated him to tackle the same crises that dogged his last cabinet.

 After weeks of wrangling that exposed divisions in the biggest bloc in Parliament, the United Iraqi Alliance resorted to a vote to pick a candidate, with Jaafari beating pragmatic economist Adel Abdul Mahdi by just one vote.

 As the biggest bloc in Parliament after winning 128 of the 275 seats, the alliance will be asked by the next President to name a Prime Minister, to be approved by a simple parliamentary majority, under the Iraqi constitution.

 So Jaafari, a leader in the Dawa party, is almost certain to remain in office to lead the first full-term government since the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003.

 The challenges remain staggering ? an insurgency that has ravaged Iraq, bloody sectarian tensions and a battered economy that few foreign investors will touch despite vast oil wealth.

 One of the most sensitive issues shows no signs of going away. Sunni Arabs allege that Shiite militias linked to Jaafaris partners in the ruling alliance run death squads against Sunnis. Jaafaris government has denied the accusation.

 The end of the alliances negotiations could pave the way for the start of talks on the formation of a government nearly two months after the December 15 election.

 In a news conference after he won the vote, Jaafari announced sweeping plans but offered no specifics, language that has earned him a reputation as a slow decision maker.

 The priorities of the new government will be the same as the last ones ? security, the economy and rebuilding. 

 Washington, encouraged that Sunnis voted after boycotting last Januarys poll, hope for a balanced new cabinet that will help defuse the Sunni insurgency.

 Its not a matter of whether we are happy about Jaafari or not. This is politics. We respect his nomination and we believe in changing Iraq through politics. Our priority will be working with Jaafari to end the American occupation, he said.

 Aside from highlighting splits among leaders of Iraqs 60 per cent majority Shiites, the vote pointed to the emergence of Shiite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr as a rebel leaderturned-kingmaker.

 Sadr, who has led two uprisings against US and Iraqi troops, apparently swung the crucial votes to Jaafari, whom he favours over his rival leaders of the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq.

 Attempt to revive Sharon

 Jerusalem, Jan. 10 (Reuters): Doctors pressed ahead today with efforts to revive Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon from an induced coma, further reducing his sedation to assess brain damage from a severe stroke.

 Sharon remained in critical condition but there were fresh reports of improvement. An Israeli news website said he had moved his left arm and leg for the first time since his medical team started trying to awaken him yesterday.

 With Israelis keeping a nationwide vigil for the 77-year-old leader many had seen as their best hope for peace, campaigning for a March 28 general election that Sharon had been favoured to win ground to a halt.

 Six days after Sharon suffered his stroke, doctors still did not know how badly his faculties had been impaired, and medical experts say even if he survives he will have little chance of recovering enough to return to resume his duties. They will continue to gradually reduce the sedatives and they will observe his responses, a hospital spokesman said.

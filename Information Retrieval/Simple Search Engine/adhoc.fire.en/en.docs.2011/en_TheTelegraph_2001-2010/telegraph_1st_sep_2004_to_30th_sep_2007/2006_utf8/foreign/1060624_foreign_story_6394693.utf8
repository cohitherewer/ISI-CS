 Chicago hit plan foiled

 - Mission to kill all devils

 Miami, June 23 (Reuters): Seven people arrested in Miami discussed attacks on the landmark Sears Tower in Chicago, the FBI building in Miami and other government buildings in a mission just as good or greater than September 11, US officials said today.

 But attorney general Alberto Gonzales said in Washington that the plotting of the seven, who were called part of a a home-grown terrorism cell, never went beyond the earliest planning stages.

 There was no immediate threat, Gonzales said, acknowledging the defendants never had any contact with al Qaida and did not have any weapons. 

 They didnt have the materials required.

 An indictment handed up against the men by a grand jury in south Florida said they pledged loyalty to Osama bin Ladens al Qaida in order to wage war against the US government and build an Islamic army. It said at least one of them plotted to blow up the 110-storey Sears Tower, the tallest building in the US.

 But deputy FBI director John Pistole said at the justice department news conference that the discussions to attack the Sears Tower were aspirational rather than operational.

 Gonzales emphasised there was no immediate threat to the Sears Tower or the five government buildings in the Miami area.

 The men, named as Narseal Batiste, Patrick Abraham, Stanley Grant Phanor, Naudimar Herrera, Burson Augustin, Lyglenson Lemorin and Rotschild Augustine, were due to appear in a Miami magistrates court.

 Justice department officials said five were Americans and two were from Haiti, and that one of the two Haitians was in the country illegally.

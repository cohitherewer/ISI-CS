 Everest feat

 Wellington, May 16 (Reuters): A New Zealand mountain climber who lost both his legs to frostbite has become the first double amputee to conquer Mount Everest, despite breaking one of his artificial limbs during the ascent.

 The amputee, Mark Inglis, 47, called his wife, Anne, last night to tell her he was standing on the summit of the 8,850 metre peak.

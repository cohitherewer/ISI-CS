 Bush: Pope sincere in apology

 New York, Sept. 19 (Reuters): President George W. Bush said on Monday that Pope Benedict was sincere in his apology for comments on Islam that have sparked outrage in the Muslim world, a US official said.

 Bush gave his assessment in talks with Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi in New York ahead of a UN General Assembly session today.

 The President noted that the Pope had made some apologies for his remarks. The President believed the Pope was sincere in those remarks, Dennis Wilder, White House senior director for East Asian affairs, said. And thats where the discussion was left. Asked whether the Malaysian leader had been satisfied with Bushs view, Wilder said: He accepted the Presidents position on the subject.

 Administration officials said Malaysia was selected for one of Bushs one-on-one meetings on the fringes of the UN session because it is in an influential but moderate Muslim country.

 The pontiff said on Sunday he was deeply sorry Muslims had been offended by his use of a medieval quotation on Islam and holy war.

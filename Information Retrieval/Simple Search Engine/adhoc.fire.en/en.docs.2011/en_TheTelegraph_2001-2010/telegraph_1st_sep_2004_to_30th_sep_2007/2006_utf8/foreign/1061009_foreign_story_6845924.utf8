 Hu buries Jiang era

 Beijing, Oct. 8 (Reuters): Chinas Communist Party chief Hu Jintao is seeking to cement his grip on power at a closed-door party meeting which began today while further chipping away at the residual influence of his predecessor, Jiang Zemin.

 About 350 full and alternate members of the elite Central Committee opened a four-day plenary session to decide the fate of Jiang ally Chen Liangyu, sacked as Shanghai party boss in September for channelling pension funds into illegal investments.

 It means that Hu Jintao is now more or less in full control, that the Jiang Zemin era has ended, Joseph Cheng, a China watcher at City University of Hong Kong, said of Chens downfall.

 Analysts expect the meeting to strip Chen of his party membership and possibly turn his case over for prosecution.

 In a power play, Hu took on Shanghai, Jiangs political stronghold and Chinas financial hub, to root out official graft and instill loyalty. Chens downfall crippled the Shanghai Gang of Jiang allies and protegees.

 Chen and other independent-minded local leaders had defied the central governments moves to cool the overheating economy.

 Take one out as a warning to a hundred, political commentator Liang Kezhi said, quoting a Chinese saying.

 Chen also lost his seat on the partys 24-member Politburo, the first member to be dismissed since 1995.

 The plenum, or full assembly, of Chinas ruling body is set to endorse Hus doctrine of building a harmonious society, which aims to embrace millions of Chinese left out of the countrys economic boom. It will eventually replace Jiangs Three Represents theory, which opened the partys doors to private entrepreneurs.

 The official Xinhua news agency defined a harmonious society as a democratic society under the rule of law, a society based on equality and justice, an honest and caring society, and a stable, vigorous and orderly society in which humans live in harmony with nature.

 Huang Zongliang, a Peking University professor, said communist parties in the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries lost power because they distanced themselves from the masses, stuck to rigid rules, refused to make changes, neglected contradictions and violated laws of development.

 The Communist Party should draw a lesson from them and avoid repeating their mistakes, Huang said.

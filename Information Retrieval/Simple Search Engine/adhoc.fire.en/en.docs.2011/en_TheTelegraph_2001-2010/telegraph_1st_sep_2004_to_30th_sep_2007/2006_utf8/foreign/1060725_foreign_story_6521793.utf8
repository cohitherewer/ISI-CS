 Woody Scoop

 New York, July 24 (Reuters): Theres an undercurrent of deja vu coursing through Woody Allens new comedy Scoop, starting with its London setting.

 But perhaps most significantly, Scarlett Johansson, the leading lady of Allens last film, Match Point, once again plays a displaced American woman ? though in Scoop shes more damsel in distress than femme fatale.

 So is Johansson, 21, poised to become the directors next muse, succeeding Diane Keaton and Mia Farrow? Allen enthused in a production notes interview that: Shes a total joy. Its like I hit the lottery or something.

 He compared her to Keaton, who starred in Allen classics such as Annie Hall and Sleeper.

 There are certain people Ive worked with over the years ? Diane Keaton was one ? who were just hit with the talent stick and had it all. And Scarlett has got it all, Allen said. Its a treat to work with her.

 After years of filming nearly all of his pictures in New York city, Allen returned to the British capital, where he shot last years dark drama Match Point.

 He also revisited the caper territory of Manhattan Murder Mystery, which the director said was a favourite of his films. In Scoop, Johansson plays a student reporter named Sondra Pransky who gets a tip from a dead journalist, Ian McShane who returns from the afterlife to ensure that his big scoop makes it into print.

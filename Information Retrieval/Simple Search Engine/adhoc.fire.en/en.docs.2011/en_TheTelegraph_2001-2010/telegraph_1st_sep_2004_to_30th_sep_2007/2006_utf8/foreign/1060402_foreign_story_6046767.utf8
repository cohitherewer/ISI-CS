 Raid on Nasa chief in child porn probe

 Washington, April 1 (AP): The headquarters office of a senior Nasa manager was searched, and computer equipment was seized, in a child pornography investigation, according to court documents and an online report.

 The Nasa inspector generals office served a search warrant on Wednesday on the agency headquarters office of James R. Robinson, in-space propulsion technology programme executive.

 A copy of the search warrant on the Smoking Gun website said a filter on Nasas computer system that searches for flesh-coloured tones alerted technicians who found 189 images of underage child sexual activity on Robinsons work computer.

 The search warrant also said Robinsons computer had been used to send movies of child pornography to an undercover postal inspector and used a private account to correspond about pictures. Robinson, who was named in the warrant, has not been arrested.

 Reached at his home in Sterling, Virginia, Robinson said he had no comment. Madeline Chulumovich, spokeswoman for the inspector general, also refused to comment. Nasa spokesman Dean Acosta confirmed that Robinson is a senior manager of the agency, reporting to the head of Solar System exploration.

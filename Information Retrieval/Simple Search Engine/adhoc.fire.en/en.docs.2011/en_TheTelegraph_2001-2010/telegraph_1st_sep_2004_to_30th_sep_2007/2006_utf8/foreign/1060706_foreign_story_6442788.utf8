 Delhi cool to Kargil nuke story

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Musharraf and Sharif

 New Delhi, July 5: Delhi today chose to ignore former Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharifs claim in his biography that Pervez Musharraf was planning to use nuclear weapons against India during the Kargil war.

 The foreign ministry remained silent on the explicit details given in Sharifs book about the backroom politics played in Islamabad during the 1999 standoff. 

 In his biography, Ghadaar Kaun? Nawaz Sharif Ki Kahani, unki zubani (Who is the traitor? Nawaz Sharifs story in his own words), written by journalist Suhail Warraich, Sharif claimed that Musharraf, who was then the army chief, had moved nuclear warheads with the plan to attack India.

 Indian analysts said Sharifs account is just the confirmation of what has been known to Delhi.

 Sharif said in his book: During my post-Kargil misadventure meeting with American President (Bill) Clinton, I was told... that nuclear warheads had been shifted from one station to another during the Kargil war. I was taken aback by this revelation because I knew nothing about it. 

 The American President further told me that the nuclear warheads have been moved so that these could be used against India.... It was a very irresponsible thing to do on General Musharrafs part.

 Defence analyst Uday Bhaskar said it shows the command and control mechanism in the Pakistani establishment, unlike other nuclear states, is under military, and not civilian, authority. 

 He said that India had factored in the nuclear aspect at the time of the Kargil conflict. 

 The officials said that more than India, Sharifs biography will have an impact on Pakistans domestic politics. For India, the book will help in sequencing the events before and during the Kargil episode and corroborate what is already known to the security establishment.

 Sharif gives a detailed account of the episode. In one of the chapters he has been quoted as saying that General Musharraf had said that I will sort this bastard (Sharif) out. The former Pakistani Prime Minister claimed that he was in the dark about Musharrafs Kargil plan and came to know about it through the then Indian Prime Miniter Atal Behari Vajpayee who gave him audio tapes of Musharrafs telephonic conversation. Experts said that this fact was well known now in India. 

He goes on to give details about the heavy loss suffered 

by Pakistani army and claimed it lost 2700 soldiers of the Northern Line Infantry 

which was wiped out due to carpet bombing by the Indian air force. He claimed 

that number of Army jawans martyred during the Kargil war is greater than those 

who sacrificed their lives during the wars of 1965 and 1971.

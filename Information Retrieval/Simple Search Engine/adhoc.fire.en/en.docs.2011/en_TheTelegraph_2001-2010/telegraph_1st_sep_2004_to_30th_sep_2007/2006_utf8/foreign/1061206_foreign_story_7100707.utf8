 Islamabad, Dec. 5: President Pervez Musharraf today called the forces opposed to the emancipation of women in Pakistan extremists and hypocrites. 

 These are the people who opposed the Women Protection Bill (PWR) but boycotted National Assembly proceedings when the legislation was put to vote, a visibly displeased Musharraf told hundreds of women delegates at a national convention in Islamabad. 

 Musharraf gave his assent to the bill on December 1 after it was approved by the National Assembly and the Senate. 

 The bill repealed the controversial Hudood Ordinance of 1979 promulgated by former military ruler General Zia-ul-Haq. Some of the ordinance clauses dealt with rape and adultery and required almost all rape victims to produce four witnesses to prove the charge, or face prosecution for adultery. 

 The main amendment approved by the parliament took rape out of the sphere of the religious law and placed it under the penal code, doing away with the requirement for four male witnesses and allowing convictions to be made on the basis of forensic and circumstantial evidence. 

 However, the six-party Islamist alliance Muttahida Majlis-e-Ammal (MMA) strongly opposed any amendments to the ordinance, saying that it was in line with Quranic teachings and, therefore, must not be touched. 

 The alliance also announced that its members would resign from the federal legislature during the supreme council meeting on December 6 and 7 in Islamabad. I call these people hypocrites because of contradictions in their claims and deeds, Musharraf said. 

 The President appealed to the women to reject extremists by voting to power moderates in the 2007 election. He said people should flush out elements opposing the emancipation of women in the next elections. He added that these forces did not hesitate to call Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah as Kafir-e-Azam.

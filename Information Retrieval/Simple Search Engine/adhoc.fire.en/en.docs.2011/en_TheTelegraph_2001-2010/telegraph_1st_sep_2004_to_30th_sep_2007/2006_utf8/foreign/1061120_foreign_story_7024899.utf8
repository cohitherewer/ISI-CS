 US lifts Sukhoi sanctions

 Hanoi, Nov. 19 (AP): The US has lifted sanctions against top Russian jet maker Sukhoi, the Russian foreign minister said today, in what analysts said was an attempt to curry favour with Moscow over a US- proposed sanctions package against Iran.

 The news came after Russia and the US signed a key trade agreement, removing the last major obstacle in Moscows 13-year journey to join the World Trade Organisation. The deal was signed on the sidelines of a Pacific Rim leaders summit.

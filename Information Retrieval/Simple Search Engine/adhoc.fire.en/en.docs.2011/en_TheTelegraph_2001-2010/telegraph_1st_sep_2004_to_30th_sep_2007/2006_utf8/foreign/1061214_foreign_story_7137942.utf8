 Afghan paper slams Pak 

 Kabul, Dec. 13 (Reuters): Pakistans government is equipping and sending militants into Afghanistan, a state-run Afghan paper said today, the harshest criticism yet against Islamabad in the face of the bloodiest violence since the Talibans fall.

 The US and its Afghan allies say the Taliban has been able to regroup since its 2001 ouster using safe havens in Pakistan and drugs money. For a long time, our country has been exposed to invasions and threats, Anis, the leading government-controlled paper, said in an editorial. The countrys current crisis of military challenge is the result of direct and indirect interference of Pakistan.

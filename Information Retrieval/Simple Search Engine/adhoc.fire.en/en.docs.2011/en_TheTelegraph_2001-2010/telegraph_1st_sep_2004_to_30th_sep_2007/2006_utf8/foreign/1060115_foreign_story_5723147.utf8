 Lanka attack on Nordic monitors

 Colombo, Jan. 14 (Reuters): Attackers bombed the compound of Nordic truce monitors in Sri Lankas restive east early today, damaging vehicles and a building but causing no injuries, officials said, as fears of a return to war grow.

 The first direct attack against the monitors since a ceasefire in 2002 halted a two-decade civil war came just hours after the Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission reprimanded both LTTE rebels and the government over a spike in violence.

 We initially thought it was a grenade, but it turned out to be a sophisticated explosive device underneath one of the vehicles, said Helen Olafsdottir, spokeswoman for the monitoring mission, known as SLMM.

 It brings into question whether we can continue to carry out our normal monitoring, she said.

 Yesterday, the unarmed 60-strong team questioned if there was still a ceasefire to monitor after more than 100 people were killed in December in attacks that have continued into January.

 Fears of a return to a war that killed more than 64,000 people are growing with deadly attacks by suspected rebels on the military and reported abuses by the armed forces of civilians.

 Suspected rebels killed nine sailors in an ambush on a main supply route in Sri Lankas north on Thursday. Similar ambushes killed 39 military personnel in December.

 Sporadic violence continued in the northeast today when one sailor was killed and three others injured on the outskirts of Jaffna town in the north by a mine planted by suspected Tiger rebels, the navy said.

 Analysts dismiss rebel denials of involvement in the attacks, but say evidence suggests elements in the military are hitting back either directly or by helping renegade rebels target the Tigers, despite their denials.

 The military suspects the attack on the truce monitor base was carried out by either the mainstream Tigers headed by leader Velupillai Prabhakaran, or a renegade faction led by a breakaway commander called Colonel Karuna ? which is locked in a feud with rebels in the east.

 We cannot say if it was the Karuna LTTE or the Prabhakaran LTTE, but it was definitely a terrorist act, said Brigadier Athula Jayawardane, head of military operations.

 He said troops started to clear roadsides in the north and east at first light after they detained a suspected female rebel trying to plant two mines where a military convoy was due to pass.

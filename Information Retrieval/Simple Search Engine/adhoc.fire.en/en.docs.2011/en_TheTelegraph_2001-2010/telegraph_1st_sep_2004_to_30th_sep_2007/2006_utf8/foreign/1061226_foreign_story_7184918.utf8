 Fine Print

 Dare to bare

 Milwaukee, Dec. 25 (AP): Miss December is wearing nothing but a Santa hat and a smile. Oh, and holding one strategically placed cat. 

 Chandra Gates, 39, decided the Humane Society of Jefferson county was a worthy enough cause for the 39-year-old to bare nearly all for a nude calendar fundraiser.

 Im shy about the picture but definitely proud of the cause, said Gates, an animal activist. The Humane Society is one of countless non-profit organisations around the world selling tastefully nude 2007 calendars.

 A group of women aged from mid 50s to early 70s in Yorkshire, England, pioneered the idea in 2000 when they sold a calendar of discreet nude photographs of themselves to raise money for cancer research.

 cocaine can be found on 94 per cent of banknotes in Spain,

 pharmacies across Spain.

The two scuffled briefly before the thief fled.

 down on the tracks in front of a train in the western town 

 of Eltville.The man at a station in Eltville began screaming

 Kabul carnage after blast near US embassy

 Kabul, Sept. 8 (Reuters): A massive car bomb exploded near the US embassy in Kabul today, killing at least 16 people including up to seven foreigners, the worst suicide attack in the city since the Taliban were overthrown in 2001.

 The attack on a packed road of pharmacies and restaurants appeared aimed at a US military convoy and came ahead of Mondays fifth anniversary of the September 11 attacks,

 Police and rescue officials said at least 16 people, including up to seven foreign soldiers or security contractors, were killed in the explosion that stripped trees, wrecked cars and shattered windows for several hundred metres (yards). Some of them turned into pieces, a policeman said as rescue crews hosed down fires and washed blood and body parts from the road, metres from the entrance to the US embassy.

 Many of the Afghan dead were poor street cleaners preparing the area for the anniversary of the death of freedom fighter Ahmed Masood, whose brown marble monument is nearby.

 Speaking by satellite phone, Taliban rebels said they carried out the attack, but did not say what the target was. The Taliban denies attacking civilians, but many raids aimed at foreigners kill more Afghans than soldiers.

 The US military said at least two of its personnel were killed in todays attack.

 There are parts of body, blood and pieces of meat, shrapnel and broken glass everywhere, said Ahmad Zia Babori, who runs one of several pharmacies along one side of the road.

 You see, this is the blood of an innocent man who was killed in this suicide attack, he added, pointing to a slowly drying pool.

 US and Afghan forces and private American contractors sealed off the site as wailing residents carried off their own wounded. US soldiers sprayed hoses to move Afghan officials away.

 Minutes after the blast, a cart laden with apples and grapes was still aflame in a blaze of red. Dead bodies, mangled and mouths gaping, lay beside the road.

 The attack was unusual in that militants do not normally strike on Fridays, the Islamic sabbath. But they have begun changing tactics as they have grown stronger over the past year or so.

 Taliban fighters began using suicide attacks late last year as part of a strategy to harry western forces in Afghanistan and destabilise President Hamid Karzais government.

 Analysts say the Taliban and their allies are the strongest they have been since they were ousted in 2001.

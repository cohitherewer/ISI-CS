 Germanys son at Auschwitz

 Oswiecim, Poland, May 28 (Reuters): Pope Benedict visited the Auschwitz death camp as a son of Germany today to meet former inmates and view an execution wall and starvation cells where some of the 1.5 million victims died.

 The Pontiff, 79, walked under the entry gates infamous motto Arbeit macht frei (work makes you free) to tour the main Auschwitz camp, the nerve centre for a huge complex serving Adolf Hitlers Final Solution of wiping out European Jewry.

 Benedict began the last of his four days in Poland with a huge mass in Krakow, but it was marred by news of an attack on Polands Chief Rabbi Michael Schudrich in Warsaw yesterday by a young man shouting Poland for the Poles!

 Schudrich was due to pray with Benedict later today. This incident is very nasty but lets not let it undermine the great importance of todays event, he said.

 Recalling Benedicts Polish predecessor had visited the camp in 1979, Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls told reporters yesterday: John Paul went to Auschwitz as a son of the Polish people and Benedict is going as the son of the German people.

 After the main camp, he was due to visit a nearby centre for dialogue among Poles, Germans and Jews and then pray at the Birkenau section of the camp, where Jews were led from trains straight to their deaths in gas chambers. 

 Benedicts visit evoked complex issues of Catholic-Jewish and Polish-German relations, the mystery of evil and German guilt for the deaths of 1.5 million, mostly Jews.

 The symbolism was heightened by the fact that Benedict was involuntarily enrolled in the Hitler Youth organisation and then drafted into an anti-aircraft unit at the end of World War Two.

 Benedict, who visited Auschwitz with John Paul in 1979 and with other German bishops in 1980, has said he saw slave labourers during his short army service. The brutality of the Nazi regime helped him decide to be a priest.

 The interior ministry said it was looking for a 25-year-old man who may have attacked the New York-born Schudrich, 50, and added that yesterdays incident might be aprovocation aimed at creating an image of Poland as an anti-Semitic country.

Earlier today, Benedict said mass for more than 900,000 

people in a field in Krakow where John Paul traditionally held huge gatherings 

with his countrymen before returning to Rome. He urged Poland to share with 

the other people of the world the treasure of your faith as a fitting and 

lasting tribute to Pope John Paul.

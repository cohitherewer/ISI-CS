 Iran reformists claim poll blow to President

 moderate showing

 Tehran, Dec. 18 (Reuters): Irans biggest reformist party said today President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad had suffered a decisive defeat in nationwide elections last week due to his governments authoritarian and inefficient methods.

 The governments spokesman countered that by saying the government had no favoured candidates in Fridays twin votes for local councils and a powerful clerical body known as the Assembly of Experts and was happy to work with the winners.

 Political analysts said the elections, the first since Ahmadinejads stunning 2005 presidential win, would have no immediate impact on policy in the Islamic state where Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has the last word on all matters.

 But a poor showing for allies of the anti-western President could give a stronger voice to more moderate voices in decision-making in future.

 Vote counting in several major electoral battlegrounds continued for a third day today, prompting government critics to express fears the delay could indicate possible tampering.

 The results that have been announced suggest that moderate conservative and reformist candidates had, on the whole, fared better than close allies of Ahmadinejad although no one group could claim outright victory.

 The initial results of elections throughout the country indicate that Ahmadinejads list has experienced a decisive defeat nationwide, the pro-reform Islamic Iran Participation Front said.

 These results were tantamount to a big no to the governments authoritarian and inefficient methods, it said.

 Government spokesman Gholamhossein Elham preferred to highlight the turnout of about 60 per cent, well above levels for equivalent elections in recent years.

 The government does not work in the interest of any particular political group, he told a weekly news conference. It is not important for us who is the winner in the elections.

 Early vote tallies for the crucial Tehran city council race gave Ahmadinejad supporters up to four of the 15 seats. Among those poised to be elected was a sister of the President.

 The rest of the council seats were shared among moderate conservative backers of Tehran mayor Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf and reformists, including at least three former cabinet ministers.

 Reformists said the Tehran results reflected those in other parts of the country where Ahmadinejad allies had failed to win decisive control of other councils. Some reformists leaders said they feared backers of Ahmadinejad and Qalibaf could form an alliance to squeeze out reformists from power in Tehran.

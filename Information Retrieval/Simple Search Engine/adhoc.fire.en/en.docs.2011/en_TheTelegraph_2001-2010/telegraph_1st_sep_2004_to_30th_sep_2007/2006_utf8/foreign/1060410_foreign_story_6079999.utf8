The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Foul-mouthed Silvios day of reckoning

 Berlusconi: Bad times

 Rome, April 9 (Reuters): Some likened him to wartime fascist dictator Benito Mussolini. Others saw him as a saviour persecuted by politically tainted magistrates.

 Italians have grown to either love or loathe Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, and passions ran high today as they voted in a parliamentary election many see as a referendum on him.

 I so ferociously hate him that the left could have said and done anything, I was still going to vote for them, said Franco Barlassina, an 82-year-old Roman pensioner, after casting his ballot in an upmarket neighbourhood of the capital.

 Its not just that he did not keep his promises. Its that he went into politics only for his own personal interest, to protect himself and his company from the prosecutors, he said.

 From an opposite perspective, Silvana, an elegantly dressed coroner in her 40s, spoke in equally strong terms.

 Look, I work all the time with those communist magistrates who are always after him. But hes governed well and I hope he wins. Hes the right man for Italy, she said.

 That the election has turned for many into a vote for or against Berlusconi, who trailed his centre-left rival Romano Prodi by 3.5 to 5 percentage points in opinion polls before a blackout came into force 15 days ago, is perhaps not surprising.

 The billionaire tycoon has dominated the ugliest campaign in decades, calling Centre-Left voters assholes and accusing the press, the judiciary and big business of plotting his demise. 

 Some Centre-Left voters could be seen going to the polls wearing I am an asshole T-shirts and pins. 

 Berlusconis government was all about money, money, money. Self interest predominated. Prodi will promote a more cultured society and offer hope to young people who are in a desperate situation here, said Donatella Lega, who works for a language school in Rome.

 Berlusconi is not a democratic man. He said workers sons cannot expect the same prospects of professionals. Not even Mussolini said that, she said. Prodi in turn has compared Berlusconi to a drunkard clinging to a lamp post and branded his rivals political criminals for claiming he would raise taxes across the board.

The bitter rhetoric has left many disillusioned and 

sceptical that either side can tackle the countrys problems ? particularly 

how to revive its flagging economy.

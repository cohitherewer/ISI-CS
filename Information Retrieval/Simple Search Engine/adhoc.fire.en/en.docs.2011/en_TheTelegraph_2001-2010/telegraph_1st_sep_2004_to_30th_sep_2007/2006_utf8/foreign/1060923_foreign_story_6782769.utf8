 Pope mixes more balm

Vatican City/Cairo, Sept. 22 (Reuters): Pope Benedict will meet Muslim ambassadors to the Vatican and Italian Islamic leaders on Monday to try to calm lingering anger over his use of a medieval text which says their religion was spread by violence.

 The purpose of this meeting is to relaunch dialogue with the Islamic world, said a Vatican official today, after invites were sent for the Monday meeting at the summer palace of the Pope (in picture) in Castelgandolfo, outside Rome.

 With protests continuing at Friday prayers at mosques around the world, Islamic diplomats accredited to the Holy See hoped the meeting would help restore trust between the Roman Catholic Church and Muslims offended by the Popes speech.

 We welcome it and are definitely going to participate, said Irans deputy ambassador to the Holy See, Ahmad Faihma. This is a positive signal from the Vatican. I know that this will improve relations with the Islamic world, he said.

 This meeting will be very important, especially in these days, to try to stop every action that is not good, said Fathi Abuabed at the Arab Leagues Vatican mission.

 The leader of more than one billion Roman Catholics has expressed regret three times in the past week for the reaction to a speech in which he quoted 14th century Byzantine Emperor Manuel II Palaeologus, who spoke of the Prophet Mohammads command to spread by the sword the faith he preached.

 Turkeys religious affairs director Ali Bardakoglu urged him not to use it just to reiterate that he was misunderstood. 

 But he would consider meeting if Benedicts planned trip to Turkey in November goes ahead. Mehmet Ali Agca, who tried to kill Pope John Paul II in 1981, warned Benedict not to travel to Turkey, saying he would be at risk.

 Day of anger 

 Thousands of Muslims from Cairo to Kuala Lumpur protested against the Pope at mosques today, demanding a full apology and in some cases a retraction of comments.

 At Cairos 10th century al-Azhar mosque many hundreds of Muslims took part in what they called a day of anger.

 Not only do we not accept his apology, but his insulting words should be wiped out of the text, a preacher said.

 In Afghanistan, scholars called the remarks psychological warfare on Islam.

 In Malaysia, about 300 Muslims waved anti-Pope banners at a peaceful rally.

 Koizumi words

 Tokyo, March 15 (Reuters): A question in Japans parliament today peppered with English financial terms had Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi warning a lawmaker to mind his language.

 Who understands (English) words like compliance and governance? Koizumi asked the embarrassed Opposition questioner. Use words that ordinary people can understand, he said to loud cheers.

 Some members know English, Ive studied a bit, but debates shouldnt be limited to those who understand English. Debates are for everyone.

 English and other foreign-language words are increasingly common in Japan, and are often introduced to make something sound exotic and to describe concepts for which there is no local equivalent

 Billion bill

 Los Angeles (Reuters): The counterfeit money looked good, 

but there was one flaw. Theres no such thing as a one billion dollar bill. 

US customs agents in California said on Tuesday they had found 250 bogus billion 

dollar bills while investigating a man charged with currency smuggling. Further 

investigation led agents to a West Hollywood apartment where they found the stash 

of yellowing and wrinkled one billion dollar bills with an issue date of 1934 

and bearing a picture of President Grover Cleveland. 

 Fish robot

 Tokyo (Reuters): Armed with nothing more than a couple of sensors, a robotic fish unveiled by Japanese scientists this week could one day be used to observe fish in the ocean or survey oil platforms for damage. Modelled on the koi, a decorative strain of carp popular in Japan, the remote-controlled white, red and gold robot can manoeuvre its way around a fish pond with a realistic flick of its tail. The 80-cm carp can also use sensors in its mouth to monitor the concentration of oxygen in water, a key to fish health, said project leader Tetsuo Ichikizaki of Ryomei Giken in Hiroshima.

 Lanka time

 Colombo (Reuters): Sri Lanka should ditch a plan to permanently 

turn its clocks back 30 minutes in April because the move could push up the islands 

energy bill and ward off investors, resident science fiction guru Arthur C. Clarke 

has warned. The best solution is to start school sessions later, Clarke, 

who first came to Sri Lanka in the 1950s for diving and became a resident after 

he fell in love with the place, said in a statement released overnight.

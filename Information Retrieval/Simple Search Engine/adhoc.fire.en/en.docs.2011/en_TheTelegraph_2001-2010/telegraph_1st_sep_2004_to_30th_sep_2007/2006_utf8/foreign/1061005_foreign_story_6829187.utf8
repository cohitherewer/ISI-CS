 Malawi Madonna

 Lilongwe (Malawi), Oct. 4 (Reuters): Pop diva Madonna arrived in Malawi today to adopt an African child and fund an orphan centre for 1,000 children, many of whom lost parents to AIDS.

 A fleet of cars and trucks specially flown in whisked the Material Girl and her entourage to an undisclosed location soon after their private plane landed at Lilongwe. She came straight from the plane, greeted the minister (of women and development) in the VIP lounge, then (went) straight to her car, said a spokeswoman. Madonna has said she plans to spend at least $3 million on programmes to support orphans in Malawi and another $1 million to fund a documentary about the plight of children in the country.

 Wanted: Enlarged women

 Berlin (Reuters): A German plastic surgeon cheated out of payment by women has handed pictures of their enlarged breasts to police, in the hope the photos will help trace them. The women registered under fake names, Michael Koenig, a surgeon in Cologne, told Bild newspaper. After the operations, which lasted about an hour, they just ran away.

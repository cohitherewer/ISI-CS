 Cancer link to alcohol found

 A man drinks vodka in Moscow: Burden of cancer

 New York, Aug. 4 (Reuters): An international team of researchers reported that 3.6 per cent of all cancer cases worldwide are related to alcohol drinking, and these lead to 3.5 per cent of all cancer deaths.

 A causal link has been established between alcohol drinking and cancers of the oral cavity, pharynx, oesophagus, colon, rectum, liver, larynx and breast, Dr Paolo Boffetta of the International Agency for Research on Cancer, Lyon, France, and colleagues wrote in the International Journal of Cancer. For other cancers, a causal association is suspected.

 In their study, the researchers used various data sources to make an estimate of the number of cancer cases and deaths in 2002 linked to alcohol consumption.

 According to the study, there were 389,100 cancer cases linked to alcohol drinking in 2002, representing 3.6 per cent of all cancer cases, and 232,900 deaths, 3.5 per cent of all cancer fatalities.

 More than 60 per cent of alcohol-related cancers in men were in the upper digestive tract and approximately 60 per cent of alcohol-associated cancers in women were in the breast.

 The burden of cancer attributed to alcohol drinking was especially high in central and eastern Europe.

 On the other hand, there is strong evidence that moderate consumption of alcohol reduces the risk of heart disease, stroke and gallstones, Boffetta and colleagues said in their study.

 Therefore, they advised, that the burden of alcohol-associated cancers should be considered in the light of the evidence that alcohol drinking modifies the risk of numerous other diseases.

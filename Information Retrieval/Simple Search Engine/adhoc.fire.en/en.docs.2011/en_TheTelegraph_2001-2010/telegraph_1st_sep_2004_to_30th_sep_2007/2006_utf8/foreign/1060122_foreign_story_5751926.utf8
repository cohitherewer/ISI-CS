 Lauras 8-year itch

 Laura Bush

 Washington, Jan. 21 (Reuters): Eight years in the White House is enough and it is right to limit Presidents to a pair of four-year terms, First Lady Laura Bush said yesterday.

 I think thats plenty. Eight years is a long time, President George W. Bushs wife told the BBC in an interview, on the anniversary of Bushs second inauguration. A constitutional amendment ratified in 1951 limits US Presidents to two terms in office. Laura Bush also agreed with her interviewer it was dispiriting to see al Qaida leader Osama bin Laden resurface in an audiotape this week. She said she worried about her husband on his travels. I worry about him, of course. I dont think theres anyone whos been married to a President that doesnt worry a little bit, she said.

 Laura Bush, who has said on several occasions that secretary of state Condoleezza Rice would make a great President, said in the interview she did not now believe Rice would run.

 I think Condis fully decided shes not going to run. In fact, every time I endorse her, she probably gets a lot of letters from people who are Condinistas, as they call them. So shes going to make me start answering those letters, probably, Laura Bush said. Bush on Thursday ruled out his wife running for a Senate seat from their home state of Texas. Never, he told a crowd. Shes a great lady. Shes not interested in running for office, Bush told a woman. Im pretty certain when I married her, she didnt like politics or politicians, he quipped after a speech on the US economy.

 Laura Bush strayed only a little bit from that position.It is unlikely, absolutely unlikely, she said. She said the presidency had been about what she expected and that she had seen Bushs parents experience the weight of the job when Bushs father was President. As for divisions within the country over the Iraq war, she acknowledged that many people are very, very sincerely anti-war while adding: Everyone is anti-war. The President is anti-war. No one wants war. But no one wanted what happened on September 11 either, she said.

 Koizumi cool on succession

 Tokyo, Feb. 8 (Reuters): Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi backed away from his vow to change the law to let women inherit the throne today, one day after sudden news that a royal princess was pregnant revived hopes for a male heir.

 No royal males have been born into Japans ancient imperial family since 1965, and Koizumi had vowed to present a bill to give women equal rights to ascend the Chrysanthemum throne to the current session of parliament to avoid a succession crisis.

 But unexpected news yesterday that Princess Kiko, wife of the emperors second son, was pregnant with her third child quickly boosted calls from opponents of reform to wait and see if the baby ? due in September or October ? is a boy.

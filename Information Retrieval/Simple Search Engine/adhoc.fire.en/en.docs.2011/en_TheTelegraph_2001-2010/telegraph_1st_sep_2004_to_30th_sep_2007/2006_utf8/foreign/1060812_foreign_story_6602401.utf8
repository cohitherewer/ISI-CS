 Shadow of plot on film

 Los Angeles, Aug. 11 (AP): Following the news early yesterday of a terrorist plot to blow up in-flight passenger airplanes, executives at Paramount Pictures considered scaling back advertising for the new Oliver Stone film, World Trade Center, which opened in the US on Wednesday.

 Ultimately, with executives and other analysts unable to predict how moviegoers will be affected, the studio decided not to change its in-place marketing plans.

 Stones film, which stars Oscar-winner Nicolas Cage, recounts the harrowing tale of two Port Authority police officers caught under the rubble of the twin towers, which fell after being hit by two passenger planes on September 11, 2001.

 Box office analysts say the current news events could raise awareness of the film, which could boost ticket sales. World Trade Center was never designed to be escapist entertainment anyway, so Im not sure people will shy away from it, said Paul Dergarabedian, president of box-office tracker Exhibitor Relations. How much more relevant could this movie be right now?

 But the films subject matter might not be the only thing on moviegoers minds. In the days after the September 11 attacks, out of concern for their safety, people stayed away from large public gatherings. Box-office receipts did pick up in subsequent weekends.

 With the US government raising the threat level and continued focus on the plot by news shows, people could again decide to stick close to home this weekend.

 I give the audience a lot of credit, Dergarabedian said. By and large we still feel very safe on our own soil going to the movie theatre.

 Wednesdays audience for the film was evenly split among men and women, young and old, Paramount said. A higher-than-normal percentage of moviegoers told exit-poll researchers they would recommend the film to friends. 

 It performed significantly ahead of our expectations, Harris said.

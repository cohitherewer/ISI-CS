 First open-air funeral in UK

 Hexham (England), July 12 (Reuters): Hindus staged their first open-air funeral in Britain for more than 70 years today and hope they can now get the go-ahead to light pyres for all their dead.

 At an emotion-charged ceremony, the family of an Indian illegal immigrant found dead in a canal bade a tearful farewell to him on a remote farmland in northeast England.

 Police had been alerted about the ceremony but allowed it to go ahead after checking all the documentation.

 Davender Ghai of the Anglo-Asian Friendship Society, who lit the pyre, arranged for the mother and sister of Rajpal Mehat to fly over especially for the cremation.

 About 500,000 Hindus and an estimated 320,000 Sikhs live in Britain where open-air cremations have been banned since the 1930s amid environmental concerns over mercury emissions.

 Andrew Bogan, legal adviser to the Anglo-Asian Friendship Society, said: Police had been alerted that an illegal pyre was to be lit. I showed them copies of all the certificates required to burn a body. They were satisfied all due process had been adhered to and said the funeral should go ahead with the blessing of the police. This is the first open-air cremation in Britain for 72 years. Hopefully we have created the precedent we are seeking.

 Giving a graphic account of his life as an illegal immigrant, Rajpal Mehats sister Sonia said: He moved from menial job to job, city to city, living in constant fear of being caught. 

 She said the agent that arranged his entry into Britain was paid ?8,500 and took most of Rajpals earnings to pay it off. She and her mother, pleading for information to clear up the mystery of Rajpals death, went to visit the bridge over the canal where he died. Police investigations were unable to confirm if he jumped, fell or was pushed.

 US sanctions on India firms

 Washington, Aug. 4 (Reuters): The US has imposed sanctions against seven companies from North Korea, Russia, India and Cuba for their alleged arms dealings with Iran, a state department official said today.

 The Indian firms are Balaji Amines and Prachi Poly Products while the Cuban company was identified as the Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology. The Korean firms were Korean Mining and Industrial Development Corporation and the Korea Pugan Trading Corporation of North Korea. The Russian companies were listed as state-owned arms export firm Rosoboronexport and warplane maker Sukhoi.

 The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the sanctions were imposed after the US obtained credible information that the companies had transferred equipment or materials to Iran since January 1, 1999. The sanctions apply to the specific entities and their successors, sub-units or subsidiaries and not to their respective countries or governments, said the official.

 The Federal Register said the sanctions were imposed as these firms had passed on equipment or technology to Iran that could contribute to the development of weapons of mass destruction or cruise or ballistic missile systems.

 Study: Coffee helps liver

 Cup that cheers 

 London, June 13: Drinking coffee every day cuts the risk of cirrhosis of the liver caused by alcohol, according to a new study.

 However, doctors stopped short yesterday of saying that coffee should be drunk for that reason. The study, by Dr Arthur Klatsky and colleagues at the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Programme in Oakland, California, used data from 125,580 people. 

 This supports the hypothesis that there is an ingredient in coffee that protects against cirrhosis, especially alcoholic cirrhosis, concludes the report, published in the of Internal Medicine. 

 The authors said they could not determine whether it was caffeine or another ingredient in coffee which had the protective effect.

 Long term heavy alcohol use is the most common cause of cirrhosis in developed countries, which progressively destroys healthy liver tissue and replaces it with scar tissue.

 Most alcohol drinkers, however, never develop cirrhosis. Researchers, therefore, believe other factors that may play a role include genetics, diet and nutrition, smoking and the interaction of alcohol with other toxins that damage the liver. About 80 per cent of Americans drink coffee, averaging 3.2 cups a day.

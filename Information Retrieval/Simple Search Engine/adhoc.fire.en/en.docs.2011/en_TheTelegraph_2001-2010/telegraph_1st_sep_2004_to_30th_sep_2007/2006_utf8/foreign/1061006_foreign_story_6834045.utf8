 UK Israel embassy row over Muslim guard

 London, Oct. 5 (Reuters): London police defended today a controversial decision to excuse a Muslim firearms officer from guard duty at the Israeli embassy, saying it was based on a potential safety risk and not on the mans personal views.

 The Sun newspaper reported that Constable Alexander Omar Basha told his bosses he morally objected to Israels 34-day war against Hizbollah guerrillas in Lebanon.

 However, the Association of Muslim Police Officers, which represented Basha in media interviews, said he was moved last week because he felt uncomfortable and unsafe guarding the embassy in west London.

 This is about the welfare of an individual and not about a moral issue, the associations superintendent Dal Babu told BBC radio. His wife is Lebanese and his father is from Syria.

 Prime Minister Tony Blairs government has been trying to improve integration among Britains ethnic and religious communities after suicide bomb attacks by four Islamists on Londons transport network in July 2005 killed 52 commuters.

 Londons Metropolitan Police ordered an urgent review of Bashas case, which sparked criticism that it would open the floodgates for officers of any religion or belief to refuse to carry out certain duties.

 Deputy commissioner Paul Stephenson later said the decision had been made after the officer had raised personal concerns.

 Whilst the Israeli embassy is not his normal posting, in view of the possibility that he could be deployed there, a risk assessment was undertaken, which is normal practice, Stephenson said.

 It was as a result of this risk assessment and not because of the officers personal views that the decisions was taken temporarily not to deploy him to the embassy. 

 When officers join the British police they swear an oath to service without fear of favour and Stephenson insisted that it would be unacceptable for this principle to be broken.

 Dhaka, Nov. 23 (Reuters): A crippling four-day transport blockade was called off in Bangladesh today after the chief election commissioner, under pressure from a 14-party political alliance to resign, stepped aside temporarily.

 We are lifting the blockade, but our pressure on the interim government will continue to further re-organise the election commission and update the voters list, said Abdul Jalil, general secretary of the alliances main party, the Awami League.

 Traffic streamed back onto the streets of Dhaka, which has been buffeted for weeks by political feuding and violence ahead of January elections.

 However, the air was not entirely cleared by the election chiefs departure: the alliance raised objections to a plan by the interim government to appoint two election commissioners in addition to the three remaining in office.

 Jalil said the alliance wanted the three existing commissioners to be removed because of their alleged bias towards the Bangladesh Nationalist Party of former Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia and its Jamaat-e-Islami ally.

 Instead of doing this, the President is planning to appoint two new commissioners without discussing it with major political parties, including the Awami League, Jalil said.

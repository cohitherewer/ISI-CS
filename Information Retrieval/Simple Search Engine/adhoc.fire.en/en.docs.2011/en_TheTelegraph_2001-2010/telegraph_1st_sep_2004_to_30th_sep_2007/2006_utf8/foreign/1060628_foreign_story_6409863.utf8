 Fat? Here are some excuses

 Milwaukee, June 27 (AP): Why are so many people fat? Scientists have come up with some novel excuses, including air conditioning, lack of sleep, fewer smokers, and more sex among obese people, which can produce chubby kids.

 Desserts are not the only things weighing America down, these researchers contend in a report published today in the International Journal of Obesity.

 I think its very creative, said Dr Robert Kushner, medical director of the weight management programme at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago, who had no role in the report. We are facing an epidemic with no tipping point in the near future. At this point, there are no silly ideas.

 However, some critics say the authors Top Ten list of alternative explanations reads more like material for a late night talk show routine than a scientific study.

 Id put this in the category of calorie distracters ? Lets just do anything to get people to stop worrying about having to eat less and move more, said Marion Nestle, a nutrition professor at New York University. 

 David Allison, a University of Alabama biostatistician, invited 19 other scientists in the US, Canada and Italy, to work on the report. They agreed on 10 potential contributors to obesity:

 Inadequate sleep,

 Substances in some foods that may alter fats 

in the body,

 Air conditioning and heating limit burning 

of calories,

 Fewer people smoking, 

 Medicines that cause weight gain

 Population changes,

 Older mothers,

 Genetic influences during pregnancy,

 Darwinian natural selection,

 Fat people mating with others of the same body 

type.

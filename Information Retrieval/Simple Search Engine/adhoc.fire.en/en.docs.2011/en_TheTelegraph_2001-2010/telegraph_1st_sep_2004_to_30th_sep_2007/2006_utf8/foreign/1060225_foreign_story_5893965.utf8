 Nazi jibe puts mayor in spot

 Livingstone: Maverick

 London, Feb. 24 (Reuters): Londons feisty mayor Ken Livingstone was suspended for a month today for comparing a Jewish reporter to a concentration camp guard, a verdict the mayor said struck at the heart of democracy.

 A three-person panel which hears complaints against local authorities ruled in a case brought by a Jewish group that Livingstone, 60, had brought his office into disrepute. It ordered him suspended for four weeks from March 1.

 Three members of a body that no one has ever elected should not be allowed to overturn the votes of millions of Londoners, Livingstone said.

 This decision strikes at the heart of democracy. Elected politicians should only be able to be removed by the voters or for breaking the law. He added he was discussing with lawyers whether to appeal.

 The suspension came as a surprise: the mayor, one of Britains most colourful and popular politicians, could have faced up to a five year ban on holding public office, but British media were expecting at most a public rebuke.

 Livingstones deputy Nicky Gavron said she would run the city in his absence, and that services would not be interrupted.

 Livingstone sparked the rumpus when reporter Oliver Finegold questioned him as he left a party for a gay politician last year. When the reporter identified himself as working for the Evening Standard, a paper loathed by the mayor, Livingstone asked:What did you do? Were you a German war criminal?

 Finegold said he was Jewish and found the remarks offensive. Livingstone replied that the reporter was like a concentration camp guard ? you are just doing it because you are paid to.

 He later refused to apologise, noting that the Standards sister paper, the Daily Mail, had supported the Nazis in the 1930s. He also said he had been rude to reporters for decades, others hadnt complained and he had no intention of changing.

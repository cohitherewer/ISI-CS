 Power drivers face stick

 Beijing, Sept. 3 (Reuters): Few abuses of power irk ordinary Beijingers more than a road hog with military number plates blaring their horn and running a red light.

 Now relief could be in sight.

 The Peoples Liberation Army has launched a campaign to punish military drivers in the capital who break traffic rules, state media reported.

 Frequent violations of traffic laws and other regulations have tarnished the armys image among the people, according to an army announcement carried in the Army Daily newspaper.

 Military cars, usually big black sedans with blacked-out windows, are readily recognised by their license plates indicating the rank of their owner. They are often seen blatantly breaking road rules by speeding, dangerously changing lanes or running red lights, Xinhua news agency said.

 Police are usually reluctant to pull over drivers of military cars for fear of their connections, Xinhua said.

 It said the good-driving campaign, which will last until the end of the year, would also target leading organs of the Communist Party and the government.

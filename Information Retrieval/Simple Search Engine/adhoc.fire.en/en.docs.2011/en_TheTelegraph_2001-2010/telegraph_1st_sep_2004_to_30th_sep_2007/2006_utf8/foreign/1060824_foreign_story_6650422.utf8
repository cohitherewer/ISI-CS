 Minister keen on France smoke ban

 Paris, Aug. 23 (AP): If the health minister gets his way, the days of Frances smoke-filled restaurants, bars and cafes will soon be history.

 Xavier Bertrand, quoted today in Le Figaro newspaper, said a smoking ban in public places is going to happen and wants to order it by decree to avoid any political fallout with elections looming.

 I am convinced that a ban is a measure that people want, he was quoted as saying. In a sign of how touchy the issue is in smoker-friendly France, a health ministry spokeswoman, however, insisted that Bertrands comments were his own, and did not represent government policy. 

 These are the wishes of the minister, and are in no way an official government announcement, said Gladys Hure, the spokeswoman. The decision must be made by the government.

 According to Le Figaro, the ban would be enacted in staggered steps, with restaurants among the first public places ordered to honour it first while nightclubs, casinos and some cafes could wait till 2007.

 The newspaper reported that Bertrand wants the decree this autumn, and setting up for a partial ban to take effect by January 1. His ministry said a decision was expected by the year-end.

 Parliamentary discussion of a smoking ban was shelved in April, when the conservative government was fighting a losing battle against thousands of street protesters over its planned youth jobs contract. At the time, Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin ordered the health minister to examine the prospects of a ban. 

 Bertrand said smoking-related illness kills 66,000 people every year in France, with some 5,000 of those deaths attributed to second hand smoke. The ban would allow for a raising of awareness, and help mentalities evolve, he said.

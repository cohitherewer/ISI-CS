 US strike kills family, says Iraq

 Tikrit (Iraq), Jan. 3 (Reuters): A US air strike killed 14 members of one family in the oil refining town of Baiji in northern Iraq, an Iraqi security force spokesman said today. 

 The air raid destroyed one house, killing the 14 people inside, said the spokesman for the Joint Coordination Centre, which handles information and liaises between US and Iraqi forces.

 Another four houses were hit and three people were injured in the raid last night, he said.

 We have this information from the Iraqi police and army in Baiji, said the spokesman, who declined to give his name.

 The US military had no immediate comment.

 Glare on China divide

 Beijing, March 5 (Reuters): China will channel its surging economic growth to narrow the chasm dividing its rich cities and restive countryside, Premier Wen Jiabao told parliament today in a speech tempering optimism with stark warnings.

 In setting out government goals for the coming year, Wen promised continuity and stability in general economic policy, including the currency exchange rate and monetary policy. But he said more wealth and investment must go to farmers and other struggling groups to ensure Chinas stability and growth.

 Wen praised Chinas performance in 2005 in a speech to nearly 3,000 delegates of the National Peoples Congress ? mostly Communist Party members and officials ? who packed Beijings Great Hall of the People for their brief annual session.

 He read a 35-page speech word for word, his delivery occasionally interrupted by perfunctory applause. The only extended clapping before the end came when he spoke of Chinas commitment to reclaim Taiwan, an island China considers its own.

 Wen warned of dangers and difficult choices ahead. Some deeply seated conflicts that have accumulated over a long time have yet to be fundamentally resolved, and new problems have arisen that cannot be ignored, he said.

 The country must pay more attention to social equity and social stability so that all the people can enjoy the fruits of reform and development.

 Wen drew a picture of a rapidly growing economy threatened by excessive investment, production gluts and mismanagement. He said distorted industrial expansion was undercutting Chinas long-term economic health.

 Production gluts are increasingly severe, prices of related goods are falling and inventories are rising. Business profits are shrinking, losses are growing and latent financial risks are increasing.

 Wens government is working on the assumption that GDP will grow about 8 per cent this year and consumer prices will rise 3 per cent. But it typically sets cautious targets; it set 8 per cent growth for 2005 but actually it was 9.9 per cent.

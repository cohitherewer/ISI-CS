 Hillary vs Rumsfeld

 Washington, Aug. 2 (AP): On the eve of a potentially contentious Senate hearing about the Iraq war, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton urged defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld to testify before Congress, saying it has been too long without such an appearance.

 Clinton, a New York Democrat, is a member of the Armed Services Committee. While she has criticised the administrations handling of the war, she has not called for Rumsfelds resignation, as have other prominent Democrats.

 The American people should hear directly from you, Clinton wrote in a letter to Rumsfeld today, a day before the scheduled hearing. She urged him to reconsider your decision to decline testifying, saying a public appearance before the committee is long overdue.

 The top Republican and Democrat on the committee, Senators John Warner, a Republican, and Democrat Carl Levin, asked Rumsfeld in a July 26 letter to appear before the committee, saying they had questions about Iraq, Afghanistan, and the recent violence in Lebanon between Israeli forces and Hizbollah.

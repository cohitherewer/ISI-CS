 Reid faces protester ire at Muslim meet

 London, Sept. 20 (Reuters): A heckler denouncing the British police as state terrorists interrupted a speech to Muslim leaders by home secretary John Reid today.

 The demonstrator shouted at Reid, calling him the enemy and attacking the governments anti-terrorism policies before being led away from the venue in east London. How dare you come to a Muslim area. I am here to disrupt the meeting, the man, who identified himself as Abu Izzadeem, said. 

 Shame on all of us for listening to him.

 Reid was forced to interrupt his speech on the need for Britains Muslims to do more to root out possible extremists.

 A second heckler briefly disrupted the speech later.

 Reids call reflects government frustration that Britains Muslim communities are not doing enough to combat radical elements in their midst. Prime Minister Tony Blair has repeatedly stated that the police and security services alone can not defeat terrorism.

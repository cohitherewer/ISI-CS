 Kathmandu, Oct. 10: The second round of talks between top leaders of the ruling Seven-Party Alliance (SPA) and Maoist rebels ended this evening after they finalised the schedule for the constituent Assembly elections.

 However, both sides could not reach any agreement on several key issues, including the future of the monarchy, arms management and composition of the interim government which will supervise the elections.

 But they agreed to meet once again on Thursday afternoon to discuss the outstanding issues and thrash out a possible joint declaration. In the meantime, the negotiating teams of the two sides will meet tomorrow to finalise the agenda for Thursdays meeting.

 CPN-UML leader Jhalanath Khanal, who took part in the talks, said they decided to hold the elections before June next year. A new election commission will be formed by mid-October to oversee the process of the constituent Assembly elections, he said.

 During the talks, Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala asked the Maoists to disarm their peoples army before the elections. Responding to Koiralas demand, Maoist supremo Prachanda said that his party would agree to arms management as long as other political issues are also resolved simultaneously.

 The meeting, which was held at Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koiralas official residence, was attended by all top SPA leaders and Maoists. Before leaving the venue, Prachanda said that he was happy with the progress of the talks. The talks have been positive, he said without elaborating.

 Senior leaders who attended the talks included CPNUML general secretary Madhav Kumar Nepal, Nepali Congress (Democratic) president Sher Bahadur Deuba and deputy Prime Minister and Peoples Front Nepal chairman Amik Serchan.

 The government team was led by home minister Krishna Sitoula while the Maoists were led by spokesman Krishna Bahadur Mahara. The meeting lasted for seven hours. 

 The peace process began in May after King Gyanendra surrendered power following weeks of often bloody street protests.

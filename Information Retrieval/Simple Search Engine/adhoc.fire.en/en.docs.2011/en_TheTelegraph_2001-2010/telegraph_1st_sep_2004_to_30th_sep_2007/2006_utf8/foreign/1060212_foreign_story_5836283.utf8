 Berlusconi Napoleon boast

 Berlusconi: Short burst

 Rome, Feb. 11 (AP): Italian Premier Silvio Berlusconi can think of only one man who achieved more than him as a leader ? Napoleon.

 Berlusconi made the comparison yesterday during a late-night talk show, searching for superlatives about the government he has led since 2001.

 Only Napoleon did more, Berlusconi said, in comments reported by news agencies Ansa and Apcom. But I am definitely taller. Berlusconi has been depicted as Napoleon by cartoonists, who also made fun of the Premiers short stature.

 Berlusconi like Napoleon? said Opposition deputy Alfonso Pecoraro Scanio. Then the next elections will be his Waterloo. Berlusconi is campaigning ahead of elections on April 9.

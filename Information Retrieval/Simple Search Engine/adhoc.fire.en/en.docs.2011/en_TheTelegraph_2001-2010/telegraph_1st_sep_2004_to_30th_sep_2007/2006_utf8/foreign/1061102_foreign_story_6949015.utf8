 Kylie to resume tour

 Minogue: Back where she belongs

 London, Nov. 1 (Reuters): Australian pop star Kylie Minogue returns to the stage on November 11 in Sydney to resume the tour she was forced to abandon last year after being diagnosed with breast cancer, her record label EMI said today.

 The 38-year-old singer underwent successful surgery in Melbourne in May, 2005, and a course of chemotherapy in Paris, where her French actor boyfriend, Olivier Martinez, has a home. 

 In recent months the former soap opera actress turned international celebrity has made occasional appearances in public, including a television interview, a book signing in London and Dolce amp; Gabbanas catwalk show in Milan. An EMI spokesman said the tour, re-named the Showgirl Homecoming Tour, would take Minogue to Britain on January 2.

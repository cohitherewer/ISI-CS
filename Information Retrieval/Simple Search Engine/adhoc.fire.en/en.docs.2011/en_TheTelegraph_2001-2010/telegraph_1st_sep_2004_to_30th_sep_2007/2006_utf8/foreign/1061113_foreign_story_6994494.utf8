 US predicts Castro end by 2007

 Castro: Debate over death 

 Washington, Nov. 12 (AP): The US government believes Fidel Castros health is deteriorating and that the Cuban leader is unlikely to live through 2007, US officials said.

 That dire view was reinforced last week when Cubas foreign minister backed away from his prediction the ailing Castro would return to power by early December. Its a subject on which I dont want to speculate, he said.

 US government officials say there is still some mystery about Castros diagnosis, his treatment and how he is responding. But these officials believe the 80-year-old leader has cancer of the stomach, colon or pancreas.

 He was seen weakened and thinner in official state photos released late last month, and it is considered unlikely that he will return to power or survive through the end of next year, said the US government and defence officials.

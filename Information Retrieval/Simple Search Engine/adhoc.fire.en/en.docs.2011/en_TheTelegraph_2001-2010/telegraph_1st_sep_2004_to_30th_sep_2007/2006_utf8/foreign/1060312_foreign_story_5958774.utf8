 Mars craft drops into orbit around Red Planet

 Pasadena (California), March 11 (Reuters): A $450 million Nasa spacecraft dropped smoothly into orbit around Mars yesterday, successfully completing a risky make-or-break manoeuvre in its two-year mission to search the Red Planet for life and find landing spots for future astronauts.

 Mission controllers at Nasas Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena erupted in cheers when the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which left Earth in August, signalled that it had achieved orbit around a planet that has defeated two-thirds of the probes sent there.

 Its almost like dodging a bullet, said Dan McCleese, the Jet Propulsion Laboratorys chief Mars scientist.Its going to take a few trips around the planet to know for sure, but from what we can see so far its a near-perfect entry into orbit.

 The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter will spend six months making some 500 trips around Mars, reeling itself in from an elongated 35-hour loop to a nearly circular two-hour orbit, before starting its primary science mission.

 The most advanced vessel ever sent to another planet, with instruments that can study an object on the Martian surface the size of a desk, the orbiter will search for signs of life and scout sites where astronauts may land years from now.

 It will fly closer to the surface than previous missions and send back 10 times as much data as all previous probes put together, while studying every level of the planet. 

 Mars has proven notoriously difficult for Earth explorers and, after losing two of the last four orbiters they have sent there, Nasa scientists said were holding their breath yesterday.

 Hurricane on way to Canada 

 Miami, Sept. 30 (AP): Isaac strengthened into the fifth hurricane of the Atlantic season today, and was headed for Canada, forecasters said.

 At 1500 GMT, the ninth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season had sustained winds up to 120 km per hour, up from 72 km per hour, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said.

 The storm was centred 595 km east-southeast of Bermuda and moving northwest at a speed of 11 km per hour.

 A turn to the north-northwest was expected by tomorrow. Hurricane force winds extend 64 km from the centre, while tropical storm force winds of at least 63 km per hour extended up to 200 km from Isaacs centre.

 Forecasters said Isaac should stay to the east of Bermuda, but the Canadian Maritimes and Newfoundland could feel the outer edges of the storm, forecasters said.

 Isaac developed into a tropical storm on Thursday.

 The Atlantic hurricane season began on June 1 and ends on November 30.

 Vietnam typhoon

 Vietnam evacuated thousands of people and halted domestic flights as Typhoon Xangsane was forecast to hit the central coast late today or early tomorrow, Reuters reports said.

 The typhoon killed at least 61 people in the Philippines. It was expected to pound the 1,000-km coastline of central Vietnam which prepared for torrential rains, flooding and landslides.

 British cleric Abu Hamza: Outrageous

 London, Jan. 14: Abu Hamza, the Muslim cleric, told his followers that John Travoltas dancing posed a danger to their daughters, a court was told yesterday.

 The Hollywood actor was at the centre of an anti-West sermon by Hamza, who also told his audience to rob and steal from non-believers.

 In a taped address shown to the Old Bailey, the former radical imam of Finsbury Park mosque, north London, said: Now you ask a woman, Go, I have a good husband for you.

 This brother hes a mujahid [freedom fighter] and she looks at him and says: Oh look, his forehead is black, probably hes praying. She likes John Travolta, who is dancing and moving his stomach as quick as the ? as I dont know what ? and she likes that because if he was wearing the proper dress which has been imposed on him by Muslims she wouldnt even think about him.

 He warned that girls would learn new words at school and would look their fathers in the eye and tell them: I dont care a tin monkey about you, father.

 Hamza, 47, is accused of nine counts of soliciting to murder, four counts of using threatening, abusive or insulting behaviour and two further counts of possessing abusive recordings with a view to distribution and possession of a document useful to preparing terrorism.

 Advising his followers on bringing up their sons to avoid a hashish life, he said: Once a child reaches 10 years old then you have to teach him some kind of thing which is scouting, sleeping rough, sleeping tough, going for training, sweating, getting a couple of punches in his face.

 In another tape he added: We teach our wives through television how to answer back ? is that clever? He also said: We invite the Kaffir [non-believer] with all their obscenity and dirty manners into our house and keep flicking channels to see this. 

 Hamza said selling top-shelf magazines featuring nudism was forbidden and called on his followers to kill anyone who gives out licences for wine shops.

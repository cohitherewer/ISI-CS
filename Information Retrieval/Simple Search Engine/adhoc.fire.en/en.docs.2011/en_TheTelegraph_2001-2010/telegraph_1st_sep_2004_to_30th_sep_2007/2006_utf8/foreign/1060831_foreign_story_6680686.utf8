 Shakira hips dont lie for NY mayor

 Shakira: Body fixation

 New York, Aug. 30 (AP): Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who uses his iPod mostly for studying Spanish, made a powerful endorsement yesterday and backed Colombian pop star Shakira in the race for Video of the Year at MTVs Video Music Awards.

 Bloomberg passed over the other nominated artists, Madonna, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Panic! At the Disco and even Christina Aguilera, who is from the Staten Island borough of New York city.

 In a taped spot that aired on MTVs Total Request Live daily countdown show, Bloomberg defended his choice by noting the truth in the title of Shakiras smash single Hips Dont Lie, which refers to her famous curves.

 I think Im going to have to go with Shakira those hips dont lie, Bloomberg said.

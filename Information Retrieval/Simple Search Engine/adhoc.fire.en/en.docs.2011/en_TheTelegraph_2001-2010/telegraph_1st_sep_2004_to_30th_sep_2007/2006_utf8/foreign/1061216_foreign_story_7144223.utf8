 Mice on a plane

 Dubai, Dec. 15 (Reuters): The screams were louder than the roar of the engines when more than 100 passengers on board a Saudi plane fought off an invasion by 80 stowaways: mice.

 Al-Hayat newspaper reported today that the mice escaped from the bag of a traveller on the internal Saudi Arabian Airlines flight and started falling on the heads and scurrying between the feet of panic-stricken passengers.

 An hour after it took off from Riyadh, the aircraft was at an altitude of 28,000 feet when passengers were surprised by the mice... the paper quoted an airline official as saying.

 Vodka track

 London (Reuters): A drunken businessman 

 who fell asleep on a railway track causing rush hour disruption 

 was sentenced to 180 hours community service on Friday. 

 Railway staff took half an hour to try and wake Kevin Craswell 

 after he passed out on a line near Epsom, southern England, 

 last March after drinking a large amount of vodka.

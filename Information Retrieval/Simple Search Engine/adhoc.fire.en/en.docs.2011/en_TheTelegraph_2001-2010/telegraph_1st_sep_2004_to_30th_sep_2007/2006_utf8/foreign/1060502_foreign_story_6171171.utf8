 Iran protest over jobs

 Tehran, May 1 (Reuters): Thousands of Iranian workers today lambasted the growing use of short-term employment contracts in the most vociferous May Day demonstration in the Islamic state for years.

 The protest came as a reminder to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad that, although embroiled in an international dispute over his countrys atomic ambitions, he was elected to improve living conditions for the poorest echelons of society.

 Short-term contracts, while better paid than regular staff contracts, allow bosses to sack workers more easily and cheaply. The contract worker is a slave as he lives in fear of being sacked, said Aliasghar Ghaliaf, 37, who has worked in a textile factory on a permanent contract for 19 years.

 Employers set us up against the contract workers, accusing us of not working hard enough, he added. 

 Paper-factory worker Masoud Cheraghi, 40, said: Some employers even make contract workers sign a resignation form without a date on it.

 The demonstrators, numbering some 10,000, called for labour minister Mohammad Jahromi to resign and brandished placards with bread stuck on them to symbolise their hand-to-mouth existence. Some wore headbands saying: The short-term contract is a slavery law. Other carried banners that read: Labour strikes must be revived.

 The protesters spread out for more than a kilometre, beating their chests in emulation of religious mourning ceremonies. Unions exist in Iran but their power is limited. Short-term contracts were introduced by the previous administration as part of attempts to make the state-heavy economy more efficient.

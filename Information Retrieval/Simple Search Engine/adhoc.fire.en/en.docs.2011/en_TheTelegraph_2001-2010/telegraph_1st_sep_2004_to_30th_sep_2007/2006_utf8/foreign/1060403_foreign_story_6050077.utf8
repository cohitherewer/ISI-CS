 After Jolie, Pitt eyes wine

 NICK PISA 

 Rome, April 2: He is best-known for his role as the battered brawler Tyler Durden, but now Brad Pitt is to move from the underground world of Fight Club to elite wine club as he becomes the latest film star to express an interest in owning a vineyard. 

 Pitt, 42, the star of Oceans Twelve and soon to be a father with his girlfriend, the actress Angelina Jolie, has viewed two estates in the Italian countryside during a secret visit. He was shown around the 20-acre properties, which both have vineyards and produce their own wine, while he was in Italy last month for the Winter Olympics. 

 Pitt was in Turin for the end-of-games party thrown by the American magazine, Sports Illustrated, and the brewer, Budweiser, which was held in a glass pyramid on the banks of the Po. 

 Before the event, he stayed at the Fontanafredda estate at Serralunga ? a 45-minute drive from Turin ? which is set in 100 acres of land. It is surrounded by vineyards which make some of Italys most famous wines ? reds, such as Barolo and Dolcetta DAlba, and the classic white, Gavi. Jolie was not with him for the brief stay. 

 He spent the night in the royal suite ? the estate was owned by the King of Italy, Vittorio Emanuele II, who started the tradition of wine-making there more than 130 years ago. 

 Monica Tavella, a spokesman for the estate, said: Brads visit was kept very secret, and only a handful of people knew that he was staying with us. He stayed over a weekend which is usually quiet, so he was able to see the vineyard and the cellars, where the wine is aged. 

 He seemed to be interested in buying, she added. 

 The estates are 90 minutes drive from Lake Como, where Pitts close friend and Oceans co-star, George Clooney, has a waterside villa at Laglio ? where it was rumoured recently that Pitt and Jolie were to be married. 

 Pitt is not the first celebrity to be bitten by the wine-making bug in Italy. Mick Hucknall, the singer with Simply Red, owns a vineyard at SantAlfio in Sicily. The rock star, Sting, also produces wine from the vines on his estate near Florence, while the film actor, G?rard Depardieu, makes wine at his villa in Sicily.

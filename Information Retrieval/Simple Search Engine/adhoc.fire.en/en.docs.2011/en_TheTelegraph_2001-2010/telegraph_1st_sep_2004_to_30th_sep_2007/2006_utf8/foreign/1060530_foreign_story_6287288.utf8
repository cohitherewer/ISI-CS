 Kabul, May 29 (Reuters): Several Afghans were killed and at least 20 were wounded today when firing erupted during a violent protest over a traffic accident involving a US military convoy in the capital, Kabul, Afghan officials said.

 There was further sporadic small arms fire by police and Afghan army soldiers as demonstrators marched towards a neighbourhood housing several embassies as protests grew in size around the city, and helicopters circled overhead.

 It was not immediately clear who was responsible for the initial shooting that broke out as Afghan police came to the assistance of a US convoy when it came under attack from a crowd hurling stones and smashing vehicle windows.

 Some eyewitnesses blamed the US troops, others blamed the police and some said both had opened fire.

 A Reuters reporter at the scene saw one man shot dead and several wounded people being taken away.

 Police said some people had been killed, but were unable to be more specific. A government doctor said at least 20 people had been admitted to hospitals with gunshot wounds, but no dead bodies had been received as yet.

 Earlier, the crowd had blocked the US convoy after one of its vehicles hit a taxi, killing at least one person, on the northern outskirts of Kabul during the morning rush hour. Rioters set two police vehicles on fire and damaged a vehicle belonging to an Afghan television station.

 A number of our citizens have been martyred and a number of them have been wounded, Yunus Qanuni, president of the lower house of parliament, told the assembly. 

 He urged people to exercise restraint.

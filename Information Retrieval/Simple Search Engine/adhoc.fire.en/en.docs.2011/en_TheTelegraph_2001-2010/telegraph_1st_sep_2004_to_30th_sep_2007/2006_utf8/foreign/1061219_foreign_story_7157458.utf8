 Hillary snub hits Royal tour

 HENRY SAMUEL

 Hillary (top), Segolene: Symbolic 

 Paris, Dec. 18: Sgolne Royal, the French Socialist presidential candidate, postponed a triumphant US tour planned for this week after Hillary Clinton declined to meet her, it was claimed yesterday.

 Royal, the first Frenchwoman with a realistic chance of becoming President in elections in April, officially put off her tour until late January or February due to fatigue after visits to West Asia and Portugal.

 But in reality the decision appears to have been influenced by her failure to secure what would have been a symbolic meeting with Hillary Clinton, the Democrat senator whose ambition is to become Americas first female President. 

 An unnamed advisor to Hillary Clinton told the newspaper Le Parisien that appearing next to a French Socialist who recently met an official of the Hezbollah movement in Lebanon could be construed as condoning the beliefs of the militant Shia group. The Democrats also have little in common with French Socialism, which supports massive state intervention, a huge civil service.

 But the main problem, said the advisor, stemmed from Royals association with the Hezbollah official, who denounced the unlimited dementia of the American administration and likened Israels foreign policy to Nazism. After initially saying she agreed with his analysis of the role of the US, Royal later condemned the remarks and said that they had been mistranslated.

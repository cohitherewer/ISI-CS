 Men want Alba more than Jolie

 Alba: Top of the tops

 New York, Jan. 30 (AP): More guys want Jessica Alba for their girlfriend than any other woman, according to AskMen.coms top 99 list for 2006.

 The 24-year-old actress tops the websites list ranking female celebrities on their long-term relationship material. Alba is followed by Alfie star Sienna Miller and the ubiquitous Angelina Jolie. 

 James Bassil, editor-in-chief of AskMen.com, said the list was determined by the rankings of 2.5 million readers and by the sites staff.

 Readers of the online magazine were asked to vote according to the woman they would most want a relationship with, would consider marrying or thought best-suited to be the mother of their children.

 Few have ever accused Alba, Miller or Jolie of being short on movie star glamour. We encouraged readers not to go on looks alone, Bassil said. 

 I dont believe its an entirely accurate reflection of what a reader strives for in their long-term relationships, but at the same time, its not a sheerly surface appreciation.

 The rest of the top 10, in order, is Brazilian model Adriana Lima, Access Hollywood correspondent Maria Menounos, Charlize Theron, Jessica Biel, singer Amerie, Natalie Portman and Desperate Housewife Eva Longoria.

 Violence in Paris, Villepin for talks

 Paris, March 23 (Reuters): Rampaging French youths set fire to cars and looted shops in Paris today, marring protests against a youth jobs law that Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin, in a conciliatory move, agreed to discuss with unions.

 Aides said Villepin would meet senior trade union officials tomorrow to try to defuse a crisis that has triggered a national strike threat and drawn hundreds of thousands of protesters on to French streets.

 In Paris, riot police fired tear gas in clashes with youths, dubbed casseurs by the French, in the Invalides areas near the foreign ministry, Reuters witnesses said.

 Youths threw stones at police and set fire to the door of an apartment building in running battles at the end of a largely peaceful rally by thousands of students and workers against the CPE First Job Contract. This time, there are lots of young criminals on the march who are there to steal and smash. This discredits the movement, said Charlie Herblin, a 22-year-old worker on the march.

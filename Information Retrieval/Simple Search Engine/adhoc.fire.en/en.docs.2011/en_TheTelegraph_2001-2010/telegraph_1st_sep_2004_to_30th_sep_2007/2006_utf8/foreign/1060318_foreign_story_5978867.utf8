 Rio pair in reunion

 Moore: Flawless

 Los Angeles, March 17 

 (AFP): Hollywood veterans Michael Caine and Demi Moore will 

 share top billing in the new jewellery heist film Flawless 

 to be directed by Michael Radford, Variety reported 

 yesterday.

 Caine, 73, who won two Oscars for best supporting actor in The Cider House Rules and Hannah and Her Sisters, will play a British jewellery shop guard who teams up with an American woman, Moore, to steal gems from his employer.

 Moore, 30 years younger than her co-star, is best known for popular hits like Ghost, Striptease and Indecent Proposal. She starred opposite Caine 22 years ago in the romantic comedy Blame it on Rio.

 Flawless director Radford was nominated for the 1996 best director Oscar for the romantic comedy Il Postino. He has also directed the 2003 Al Pacino-Jeremy Irons film The Merchant of Venice.

 China chokes news flow

 Shanghai, Sept. 10 (AP): China today announced detailed controls on the distribution of news by foreign news agencies, banning all content that violates its own tight media restrictions.

 The new measures, issued by the official Xinhua News Agency, limit foreign news agencies to distributing news only through Xinhua or entities authorised by it.

 The detailed rules ban the distribution in China of news content that disrupts Chinas economic and social order or undermine Chinas social stability, Xinhua said. The limits also ban news that undermines Chinas national unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity, it said.

 Chinas communist authorities have long sought to control independent distribution of news and information by foreign companies. 

 The rules would also apply to release of news in Hong Kong and Taiwan though it was unclear how they would apply given the separate legal systems there.

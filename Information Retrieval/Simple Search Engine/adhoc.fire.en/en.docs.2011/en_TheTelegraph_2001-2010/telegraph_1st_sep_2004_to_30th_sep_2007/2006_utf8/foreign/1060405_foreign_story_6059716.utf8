 Colombia captive has child with captor

 Clara Rojas: Childs play 

 Bogota, April 4 (Reuters): A Colombian politician taken hostage more than four years ago by Leftist rebels has had a child by one of her captors in a secret jungle prison camp, according to a book to be published today.

 Colombian news programmes were filled with reports about the baby boy yesterday, with commentators speculating about the effect the existence of a child might have on attempts to swap rebel hostages for guerrillas held in government jails.

 The book, Latest News From the War by journalist Jorge Botero, tells the story of Clara Rojas, a single 41-year-old lawyer kidnapped by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, while campaigning for the vice-presidency.

 Botero, known for his close contacts with the FARC, said he confirmed the existence of the child, now about two years old, with top FARC commanders. I hope that this child can become a symbol of the tragedy that we have been living through, Botero said, referring to Colombias decades-old guerrilla war, in which thousands are killed every year.

 The child is not the result of rape or something forced. He is the result of a relationship, Botero said.

 Kathmandu, Dec. 19: Angry Maoist cadres brought life to a standstill all over Nepal in protest against the appointment of 14 ambassadors by the coalition government, saying the decision was taken without consulting them.

 In the eastern Illam district, close to the Indo-Nepal border, about 800 armed members of the Peoples Liberation Army (PLA) organised a protest march in Chulachuli town. The day-long strike, the first by the rebel group since the signing of the peace deal with the government, pointed to fresh strains in their uneasy relationship.

 In Kathmandu, life was completely paralysed for over six hours this morning when students and labour groups backed by the Maoists took to the streets and enforced a shutdown. The rebel activists damaged vehicles and forced all educational institutions, industries and shops to close down.

 Early morning traffic in the hill-ringed city was disrupted by protesters, some of whom tied a rope across a road, burned tyres and set up other roadblocks to stop vehicles. 

 The Maoists also enforced similar shutdowns in all major towns of Nepal and even in the countryside. 

 Maoist chief Prachanda said the decision to nominate the ambassadors was a serious violation of the agreements reached between the government and the Maoists. 

 We are in the process of joining the government soon. However, the government has taken such a decision bypassing us. So, it is a serious violation of the agreement and accord between the party and the government, he said. 

 We protest this as it was done without consulting us. We consider this a conspiracy against the understandings and (this) could seriously affect the peace process in future. The government, which named envoys to 14 countries, including India and the US, denied it had done anything wrong. I am really surprised, deputy Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli said.

 Mona Lisa breaks silence and speaks

 Tokyo, May 31 (Reuters): The Mona Lisas smile may always remain a mystery, but it is now possible to hear what her voice would have sounded like, thanks to a Japanese acoustics expert.

 Dr Matsumi Suzuki, who generally uses his skills to help with criminal investigations, measured the face and hands of Leonardo da Vincis famous 16th century portrait to estimate her height at 168 cm and create a model of her skull.

 Once we have that, we can create a voice very similar to that of the person concerned, Suzuki said in an interview at his Tokyo office last week. We have recreated the voices of a lot of famous people that were very close to the real thing and have been used in film dubbing.

 The chart of any individuals voice, known as a voice print, is unique to that person and Suzuki says he believes he has achieved 90 per cent accuracy in recreating the quality of the enigmatic womans speaking tone.

 I am the Mona Lisa. My true identity is shrouded in mystery, the portrait says.

 In Mona Lisas case, the lower part of her face is quite wide and her chin is pointed, Suzuki explained. The extra volume means a relatively low voice, while the pointed chin adds mid-pitch tones, he added. The scientists brought in an Italian woman to add the necessary intonation to the voice. We then had to think about what to have her say, Suzuki said.

 We tried having her speak Japanese, but it didnt suit her image.

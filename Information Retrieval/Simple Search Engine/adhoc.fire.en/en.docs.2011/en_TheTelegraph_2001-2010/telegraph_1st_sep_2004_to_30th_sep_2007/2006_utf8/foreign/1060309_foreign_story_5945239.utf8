 Scientists fusion claim to be probed

 Washington, March 8 (Reuters): Purdue University is investigating complaints about a scientist who claimed to have achieved cold fusion using sound waves to make bubbles in a test tube, the university said today.

 Nuclear engineer Rusi Taleyarkhans work has been controversial since he published a study in 2002 claiming to have achieved the Holy Grail of energy production ? nuclear fusion at room temperature. Nuclear fusion is the process that powers the sun.

 If scientists can duplicate the results and harness the technology, tabletop fusion has the potential to provide an almost limitless source of cheap energy.

 Taleyarkhan, whose study was published while he was at the US department of energys Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, now works at Purdue University in Indiana and has also been trying to replicate his earlier findings. 

 Purdue provost Sally Mason said her office was checking complaints from some of Taleyarkhans co-workers.

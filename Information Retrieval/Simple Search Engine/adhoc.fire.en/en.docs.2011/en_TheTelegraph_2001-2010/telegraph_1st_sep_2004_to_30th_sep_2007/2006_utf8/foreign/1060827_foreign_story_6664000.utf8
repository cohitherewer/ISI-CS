 Battle of races in reality show

 New York, Aug. 26 (AP): A group of New York city officials blasted CBS and its hit series Survivor after the network announced that the teams on the new season of the reality show will be divided by race.

 Saying that the set-up will promote divisiveness, the officials called on CBS to reconsider its plans. The idea of having a battle of the races is preposterous, city councilman John Liu said on Thursday. How could anybody be so desperate for ratings?

 For the first portion of the 13th season of Survivor, which premieres on September 14, the contestants competing for the $1 million prize while stranded on the Cook Islands in the South Pacific will be divided into four teams blacks, Asians, Latinos and whites.

 Liu, who is Asian-American, said he was launching a campaign urging CBS to pull the show because it could encourage racial division and promote negative typecasts. He and a coalition of officials, including the councils black, Latino and Asian caucus, planned to protest.

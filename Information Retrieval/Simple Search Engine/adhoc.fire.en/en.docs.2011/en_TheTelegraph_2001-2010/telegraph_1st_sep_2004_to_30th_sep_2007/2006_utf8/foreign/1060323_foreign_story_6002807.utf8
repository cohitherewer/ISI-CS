 Job law row exposes France rift

 Paris, March 22 (Reuters): Frances powerful interior minister distanced himself from Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin over a job law today but ruled out quitting, in a clear sign of a deep split within the ruling Right.

 In an interview, Nicolas Sarkozy called for a six-month trial period for the CPE First Job Contract, which has sparked street protests and a national strike threat and highlighted the presidential rivalries of Sarkozy and Villepin.

 Commentators suggest Sarkozy might leave the government in an effort to prevent his chances in 2007 presidential elections being damaged in the fallout from the CPE row. I am showing solidarity while being different, Sarkozy told the Paris Match weekly in an interview released ahead of publication .

 I have no intention of displaying that difference more when things are not going well, rather than when things are going well, he said, adding he would not resign over the issue. One does not leave a government for opportunist reasons.

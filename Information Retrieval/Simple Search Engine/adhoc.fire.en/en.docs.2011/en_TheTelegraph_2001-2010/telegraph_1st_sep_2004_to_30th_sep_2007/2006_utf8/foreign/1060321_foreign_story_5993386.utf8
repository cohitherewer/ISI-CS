 Australia coast hit by cyclone

 Innisfail (Australia), March 20 (Reuters): One of the most powerful cyclones to hit Australia in decades lashed the northern city of Cairns today with winds of up to 290 kmph , ripping roofs off houses, uprooting trees and flattening crops.

 There were no reports of deaths by late today but authorities said about 30 people had received minor injuries.

 The eye of Cyclone Larry crossed the coast just south of Cairns, the sugar-growing town of Innisfail taking the maximum-category five storms full force as it left a trail of destruction along 300 km of coast.

 Larry flattened cane fields and banana crops and roads were strewn with trees and power lines. The roofs of homes were ripped off like the top of sardine cans, a witness said.

 She was howling like a banshee. The walls were getting sucked in and out and making an incredible sound, Paul Leyton said as he stood outside his home, which had lost its roof.

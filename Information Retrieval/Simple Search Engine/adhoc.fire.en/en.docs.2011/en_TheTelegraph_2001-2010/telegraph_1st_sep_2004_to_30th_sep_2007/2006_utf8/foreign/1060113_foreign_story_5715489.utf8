 Fuji fervour

 Tokyo, Jan. 12 (Reuters): A lack of winter snow on Japans famed Mount Fuji has sparked speculation the volcano could erupt for the first time in three centuries, but experts today denied any link between snow and seismic activity.

 Much of Japan has had record snowfall in the last month, but recent photographs of the usually snowcapped Mount Fuji show its slopes looking bare.

 Some tabloids have taken the snowless peak as a sign that an eruption was imminent, but scientists said there was no basis for concern. Mount Fuji last erupted in 1707.

 Shady plan

 Mount Clemens, Michigan (AP): Slim Shady 

 and his ex are going to get married again. Kim Mathers, 

 Eminems former wife known to hip-hop fans merely as 

 Kim, has applied for a licence to marry Marshall 

 Bruce Mathers III or Eminem. The two reconciled in late 

 2004, three years after their divorce. The application was 

 filed with the Macomb county clerks office.

 Hordes flee Lanka strikes

 Colombo, April 26 (Reuters): Sri Lankas military launched air and artillery strikes on Tamil Tiger targets in the islands northeast today, with thousands fleeing their homes a day after a suicide attack damaged an already fragile ceasefire.

 Military spokesman Brigadier Prasad Samarasinghe said the latest strikes came after the LTTE fired at the military near the northeastern port of Trincomalee. By night, the army said the island was quiet.

 The rebels said they would retaliate if the government continued the attacks, launched after a suspected Tiger suicide blast in the capital killed 10 and wounded the army commander.

 It is like a war situation in Trincomalee. If the attacks continue, the LTTE will be forced to take military defensive action, S. Puleedevan, head of the Tigers peace secretariat, said in the morning as rebel positions were hit.

 The strikes were the first official military action since a 2002 ceasefire halted the two-decades-old civil war and raised hopes of a lasting peace. They followed a string of suspected Tiger attacks on the military and ethnic riots against Tamils.

 The army said it had closed borders with rebel territory. Some aid workers helping rebuild after the 2004 tsunami said they were evacuating from the north and east. UN agencies stayed where they were, but cancelled transport.

 Tiger northeastern political leader S. Elilan said shelling had ceased late in the morning. At least 10 bodies had been recovered and 25 people were injured, he said. A rebel website showed photographs of battered bodies and destroyed homes.

 The army said three civilians were killed when the Tigers fired mortars back into government territory. The government said the strikes would last as long as the Tigers kept up attacks.

 UN High Commissioner for Refugees representative Amin Awad said he believed thousands had fled their homes, although some reports said tens of thousands. Until aid agencies got access, it would be hard to say, he said.

 We have not yet had access to the area, he said. We want access and have called for a halt in hostilities.

 Swedish Major-General Ulf Henricsson, who heads the Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission that oversees the truce, said if air strikes continued, peace talks would become difficult. The worst-case scenario was a return to war, he said.

 I think the parties are not prepared for that, he said. And if they were, it would be devastating for the people of Sri Lanka and for their own military capabilities.

 More than 100 people had already died in the bloodiest two weeks since the truce, even before a female suicide bomber, disguised to look pregnant, blew herself up at Colombos high-security army headquarters. The Tigers yesterday denied responsibility for the attack.

 But a suspected Tiger front group, the High Security Zone Residents Liberation Force (HSZRLF), claimed responsibility. HSZRLF feels that the LTTE is merely wasting time by maintaining a ceasefire, it said in a fax.

 The Tigers indefinitely postponed a second round of peace talks that were to take place last week in Geneva, accusing the government of obstructing the transport of eastern rebel leaders to a pre-talks meeting.

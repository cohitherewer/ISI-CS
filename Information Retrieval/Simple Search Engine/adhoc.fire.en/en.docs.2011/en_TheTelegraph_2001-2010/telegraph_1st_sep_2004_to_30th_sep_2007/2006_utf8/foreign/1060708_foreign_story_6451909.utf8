The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Lot younger

 Washington, 

 July 7 (Reuters): If President George W. Bush felt 

 any angst about turning 60 yesterday, he sure wasnt 

 showing it.

 Let me just say this ? its a lot younger than you think, Bush said on hitting the milestone. An avid biker who quit drinking at 40, Bush prides himself on his physical fitness. Born in 1946, Bush is a member of the huge post-war baby boomer generation. His press secretary, Tony Snow, portrayed the birthday as just another day.

 He feels like its one day after being 59, Snow said. You know the President. Its not the sort of thing where hes sitting around somewhere looking at his watch and saying: Oh man, I got an achy knee.

 Although his birthday was yesterday, Bush began celebrating at a Fourth of July dinner that included family and friends. He showed up in a red-and-white Hawaiian shirt.

 As for gifts that were made public, Bush got a belt buckle from visiting Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper and cuff links from staff. Later, in Chicago, Bush blew out the candles on a birthday cake at a dinner in a basement room at the Chicago Firehouse restaurant. Among the all-male group was Democratic mayor Richard Daley, local officials and senior White House aides. 

 Ive got a lot of birthday wishes, said Bush. I hope our troops are safe, I hope Roger Ebert does well. I know a lot of people here in Chicago are pulling for him. Ebert, a Chicago film critic, had emergency cancer surgery recently.

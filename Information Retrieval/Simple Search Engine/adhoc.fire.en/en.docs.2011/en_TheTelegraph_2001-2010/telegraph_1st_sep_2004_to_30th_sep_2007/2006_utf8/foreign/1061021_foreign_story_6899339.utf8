 Briton ready for the worst

 Adiala Jail (Pakistan), Oct. 

 20 (AP): British death row inmate Mirza Tahir Hussain 

 stared from behind the bars of his dank prison cell, his 

 long white beard a sign of 18 years in a Pakistani prison.

 He said prayer and his deep faith in Islam have helped prepare him for either of two scenarios: release, or death by hanging. I hope for the best and try to be ready for the worst, and leave everything to Allah, Hussain, 36, told The Associated Press yesterday in a rare interview at the notorious Adiala Prison in Rawalpindi, a garrison city near the capital, Islamabad.

 Pakistani officials announced this week that Hussains execution had been re-scheduled for November 1. 

 Hussain was 18 when he travelled to his ancestral home of Pakistan for the first time in 1988, taking a break, he said, from a stint in the British territorial army, the UKs military reserve. He planned to visit relatives in the Punjab province town of Chakwal, south of Islamabad.

 On the day he arrived, Hussain was picked up by taxi driver Jamshed Khan, who, the Briton said, pulled out a gun and tried to sexually assault him. During an ensuing struggle, the driver was fatally shot. Hussain drove the cab and the body to a nearby police station, where he was arrested.

 It wasnt pre-planned. It happened suddenly. A scuffle took place. It could have been me that was shot, said Hussain, wearing a red-and-white head scarf and a crisp, white shalwar kameez.I feel very sorry for whatever happened, and regret it and pray for the family of the deceased and the victim also. I grieve as they do. 

 Death row at Adiala Jail comprises five or six quadrangle buildings with a courtyard in the middle of each into which prisoners like Hussain are allowed to walk for two hours daily. Hussain said he spends his days reading the Quran and other books, writing, talking with cellmates.

 Earth has close shave with asteroid

 Washington, July 3 (AFP): An asteroid hurtling through space came within a hairs breadth ? in astronomical terms, at least ? of crashing into the earth early today, US scientists said. 

 Apollo asteroid 2004 XP14 was discovered by Lincoln Laboratory in Lexington, Massachusetts, a research facility which is part of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 

 The lab claims the title of the worlds principal detector of asteroids, said Roger Sudbury, a spokesman for the lab.

 We were the discoverer, said Sudbury of the asteroid, which passed some 432,000 km from the earth at 9.55 am IST.

 The distance between the two bodies was slightly greater than that between the earth and the moon. Sudbury said the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Minor Planet Center had classified the body as a potentially hazardous asteroid, because of its proximity to earth.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Lanka rebels reject talks, fighting on 

 Colombo, Aug. 13 (Reuters) 

 : Sri Lankas Tamil Tigers today said peace talks 

 were impossible as the worst fighting since a 2002 truce 

 raged in the islands north and the government demanded 

 rebel fighters surrender.

 The government had said it received a message from the Tigers through ceasefire monitors on Friday, hours before clashes erupted on the northern Jaffna peninsula, saying that they were keen to talk something the government said it was keen to do.

 We have made no proposals for peace talks, S. Puleedevan, head of the Tiger peace secretariat, said. Government offensive attacks make peace talks impossible.

 The government says it is winning the fighting, although analysts are sceptical. A statement late today said many LTTE fighters were deserting and called on them to put down their weapons.

 Security forces confirm there are many child recruits amongst the LTTE cadres killed in the confrontations that took place in the last 48 hours, the statement said. The government requests all child recruits and other LTTE cadres to surrender to the nearest security forces camp or police station.

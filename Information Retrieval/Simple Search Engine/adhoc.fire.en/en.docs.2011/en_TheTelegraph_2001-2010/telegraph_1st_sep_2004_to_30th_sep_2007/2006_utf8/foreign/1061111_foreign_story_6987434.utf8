 Village fury over China land grab

 Hong Kong, Nov. 10 (Reuters): Thousands of Chinese villagers clashed with riot police after barricading officials and foreign businessmen in a warehouse they said had been built on illegally seized land, a newspaper reported today.

 The clash erupted on Wednesday near Shunde, in the southern province of Guangdong, during the opening of the warehouse, which villagers said had been built on land grabbed by officials and sold off to developers, Hong Kongs Apple Daily said.

 The villagers only began to disperse the next morning when police used tear gas.

 China has struggled to control rising flare-ups of social unrest in recent years, sparked by issues ranging from corruption, forced layoffs and land grabs without compensation to disparities in wealth.

 Up to 10,000 people blockaded the warehouse entrance in the village of Sanzhou, trapping 300 assembled dignitaries, including Guangdong officials and Hong Kong and foreign businessmen inside, the Apple Daily said.

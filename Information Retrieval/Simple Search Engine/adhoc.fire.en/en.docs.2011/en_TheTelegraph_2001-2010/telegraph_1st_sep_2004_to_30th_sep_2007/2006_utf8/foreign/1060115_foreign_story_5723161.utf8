 US airstrike misses Zawahri, angers Pak

 Ayman al-Zawahri: Lucky again

 Islamabad/Washington, Jan. 14 (Reuters): A US airstrike on a Pakistan village targeted al Qaidas second-in-command, US intelligence sources say, but Pakistani officials said Ayman al-Zawahri was not there and condemned the attack.

 The strike near the Afghan border yesterday killed at least 18 people, including women and children, and three houses were destroyed, according to residents of Damadola village in Bajaur tribal area.

 CIA-operated unmanned drones were believed to have been used in the attack, US sources said. A Pakistani intelligence official said four missiles had been fired.

 Pakistan condemned the airstrike and summoned US ambassador Ryan Crocker. Information minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed said he had no information about Zawahri, though another Pakistani official said Osama bin Ladens deputy was not in the village.

 Al-Zawahri was not there at the time, the official, who declined to be identified, said.

 Al Arabiya satellite television said today Zawahri was alive, quoting a source which it said has contact with al Qaida.

 The US has offered $25 million each for Egyptian Zawahri and bin Laden, who have been on the run since US-led forces toppled Afghanistans Taliban government in 2001 after the September 11 attacks on US cities.

 They are believed to have been hiding along the border under the protection of Pashtun tribes.

 Pakistani intelligence sources said Zawahri was believed to have made visits to the Bajaur area, though yesterday he was not in Damadola, 200 km northwest of Islamabad.

 Pakistans foreign ministry said foreigners had been in the vicinity, and were the probable target of the attack from forces based in Afghanistan.

 As a result of this act there has been loss of innocent civilian lives which we condemn, the ministry said.

 Anger has been building in Pakistan over repeated US attacks, and today hundreds of protesters chanted anti-American slogans at Inayat Killi village, near Damadola.

 The incident came days after Pakistan, an important ally in the US-led war on terrorism, lodged a strong protest with US-led forces in Afghanistan, saying cross-border firing in the Waziristan tribal area last weekend killed eight people.

 President Pervez Musharraf, addressing officials in the town of Swabi to the north of Islamabad, made only a passing reference to the attack in Bajaur, saying it was being investigated. 

 People from Damadola said no foreigners, only local people, were present and killed in yesterdays attack.

 I know all the 18 people killed. There was neither Zawahri nor any other Arab among them. Rather they were all poor people of the area, Haroon Rashid, the areas National Assembly representative, was quoted by the Afghan Islamic Press news agency as saying.

 US sources in Washington said the remains of the dead would have to be examined to determine whether Zawahri was among them.

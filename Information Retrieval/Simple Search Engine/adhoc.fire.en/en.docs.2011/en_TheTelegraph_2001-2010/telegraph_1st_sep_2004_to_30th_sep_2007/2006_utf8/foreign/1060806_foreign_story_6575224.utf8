 Fans inspire Roald Dahl celebration

 TOM LEONARD

 London, Aug. 5: Like the giant peach that grew bigger and bigger, a 90th birthday party for the late Roald Dahl has blossomed into a month-long nationwide celebration of the authors life and work, his widow said yesterday.

 Sixteen years after his death, the extraordinary appeal of the author of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, The Witches and countless other slightly sinister childrens stories shows no sign of dimming.

 His widow, Felicity Dahl, said his family had been inspired to celebrate his birthday on September 13 by the continuing pilgrimage of young fans to the house in Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire, where he wrote many of his books. Every day, you see a little head peering over the hedge, she said.

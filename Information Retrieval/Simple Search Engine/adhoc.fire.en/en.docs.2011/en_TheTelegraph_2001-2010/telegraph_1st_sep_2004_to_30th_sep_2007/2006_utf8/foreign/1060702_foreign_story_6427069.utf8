 Nepal to seek UN help despite rebels

 Kathmandu, July 1 (Reuters): Nepal will ask the UN to monitor weapons of Maoist rebels and the army ahead of elections for an assembly to map out the countrys political future, the home minister said today.

 Without the UN involved, the Nepali people will have no confidence in the arms monitoring process, Krishna Prasad Sitaula said in an interview.

 The letter (to the UN) will go ... the foreign ministry will send it, said Sitaula, the governments main negotiator with the rebels.

 Sitaulas comments came a day after Maoist leaders, including rebel chief Prachanda, said there was no need for arms monitors from outside. 

 Sitaula did not comment on the sudden Maoist turnaround to foreign arms monitors besides expressing surprise. He said the rebels had already agreed to international supervision of arms in pacts between the Seven-Party Alliance (SPA) and the Maoists last year and in June 2006.

 Sitaula said the formation of an interim government and an UN -supervised process of arms monitoring must go hand-in-hand.

 The US ambassador in Nepal said today that Washington would not support a government in Kathmandu that included the rebels if they took part in clashes in the countryside despite a truce.

 US ambassador James Moriarty said Washington ? a key donor ? could stop aid to impoverished Nepal if the rebels joined an interim government without giving up their arms first.

 If the Maoists continue to use violence and then enter the government, our law says we cant supply assistance to those who support (terrorism), Moriarty said in Kathmandu.

 The rebels and government are holding talks to fulfil a political roadmap after popular and violent protests forced King Gyanendra to give up his absolute rule in April and cede power to the SPA.

 The roadmap includes an interim constitution and an interim government in the coming months and polls next year to the special assembly that will decide on a new constitution and the future of the 240-year-old monarchy.

 Though clashes between the army and the rebels ended after a ceasefire two months ago, around a dozen people have been killed in Maoist attacks or strikes by attackers thought to be anti-rebel vigilantes since May.

 This violence is an obstacle to the peace process, Sitaula said, saying there could be an internal conspiracy to undermine the political talks but did not say who could be behind it.

 Sitaula said the Maoists should stick to the principles of the 12-point pact signed in November 2005, return seized land and stop abductions. 

 The UN this week expressed its concern over Maoist killings.

 We must convince the Maoists that guns must fall silent.

 In all, more than 13,000 people have been killed since the Maoist revolt erupted in 1996, aimed at toppling the monarchy.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 $2 million for 666-6666

 Doha, May 23 (Reuters): The tiny Gulf state of Qatar, famed mainly for having the Arab worlds largest reserves of natural gas, added another record to its name today ? one of the worlds most expensive telephone numbers.

 At a charity event in the capital Doha, a Qatari bidder paid $2.75 million for the mobile phone number: 666-6666.

 The winner, who made the highest bid 10 minutes into the auction, declined requests for interviews. 

 Eight people took part in the auction, organised by Qatar Telecom to help raise funds for charity, paying 3,000 Qatari riyals ($824.60) per ticket.

 Funds from the ticket sales were given to a local charity, while the 10 million riyals from the sale of the number was handed over to Hamad Medical Services Foundation to expand medical services.

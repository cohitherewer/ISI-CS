 Hangu (Pakistan), Feb. 9 (Reuters): At least 35 people were killed and dozens wounded in Pakistan today in a suicide bombing on a Shia procession and subsequent violence on the holiest day of the year for the religious minority.

 The bombing targeted a procession in the town of Hangu in the North West Frontier Province to mark Muharram. Interior minister Aftab Ahmed Khan Sherpao said there had been three blasts.

 Pakistan has suffered Islamist sectarian violence for years, most of it directed by majority Sunnis against Shias.

 Analysts say that in recent years attacks by Sunni groups linked to al Qaida have appeared to have a broader aim of destabilising the rule of President Pervez Musharraf and his alliance with Washington in the US-led war on terrorism.

 Unidentified gunmen also opened fire on a bus outside Hangu, killing four passengers, including a woman, and injuring two, officials said.

 Superintendent Mohammad Ayub of the Hangu police said four people died in a shootout during a curfew imposed after the bombing ? one policeman, a soldier, and two civilians.

 In Afghanistan, at least five people were killed and 27 wounded in clashes between Shias and Sunnis during the commemoration in the western town of Herat.

 Abdul Rashid, medical superintendent at Hangu hospital, said 29 people had been confirmed dead there. Some of them have bullet wounds. All of them are Shias.

 A leader of the procession, Maulana Khurshid Anwar, said a bomb exploded near a stage as he was about to address mourners. Enraged Shias set shops and a bank on fire and fired shots into the air in the town 200 km west of Islamabad.

 NWFP police chief Riffat Pasha said the bombing was a suicide attack and troops and armoured personnel carriers were sent to restore order. Troops put up barricades on roads into Hangu.

 Among the bodies at Hangus Civil Hospital was one that was headless and some bystanders said it was that of the bomber. Most shops at the site of the blast in the main bazaar were burned and some were still ablaze. 

 Hangu mayor Ghani-ur-Rehman said he did not believe sectarian rivalry was responsible.I think it is not a Shia-Sunni affair ? it is terrorism, he said, adding that there were also Sunnis in the procession, including himself.

 Kakarvitta (Nepal), March 22: Fresh violence rocked eastern Nepal today as the situation in the trading town of Birtamode remained tense after yesterdays daring Maoist attack.

 In the latest clash at Urlabari, 60 km from Kakarvitta in the Morang district, a group of armed Maoist rebels in a jeep attacked a convoy of two vehicles carrying cash from a branch of the Nepal National Commercial Bank to the local police station at 3.30 pm (IST). 

 Unlike yesterdays incident at Birtamode where the police put up little resistance, the Maoists in Urlabari were involved in a shootout with the police for 45 minutes. The Maoists, however, failed to get any of the cash.

 The body count at the end of the skirmish read: three Maoist rebels, two policemen ? Bir Bahadur Limbu and Krishna Khadka ? and an unidentified woman who was caught in the crossfire.

 The police also recovered one assault rifle and two pistols from the site of the encounter, sources said, adding that the arms may have belonged to the slain rebels.

 In Birtamode,, the situation was tense with most shops remaining closed for the second day today. The local police station and traffic police office, which was the target of the Maoist attack, however, continued to draw curious residents.

 This is terrible and the earlier this mindless cannibalism ends the better for us, said Harka Bahadur Sharma.

 Mecca Cola sales rise

 Dubai, Feb. 21 (Reuters): UAE-based Mecca Cola, touted by its makers as an Islamic alternative to western brand soft drinks, has seen sales triple since anger erupted in Muslim countries over cartoons lampooning the Prophet Mohammad.

 Chairman Taoufik Mathlouthi said at a food industry exhibition that he planned to list Mecca Cola on the Dubai stock market, adding the process could take more than a year.

 Growth came with these Danish caricatures. Its crazy but our sales multiplied by three ... We cannot supply all the demand we have right now, Mathlouthi said.

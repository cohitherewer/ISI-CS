 Islamabad, Nov. 25 (AP): Pakistan has signed an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency for safeguards at a nuclear power plant currently under construction.

 The 35-member IAEA board of governors approved measures for Pakistans Chashma Nuclear Power Plant Unit 2, the foreign ministry said late yesterday.

 Pakistan began building the 350-megawatt power plant in April 2005 with assistance from China. 

 The power station, about 200 km southwest of the capital, Islamabad, is to be completed in 2011.

 The unit is near another nuclear power plant that was also built with Chinese help and began generating power in 2000.

 Chinese President Hu Jintao, currently on a visit to Pakistan, said today that China will continue civilian nuclear cooperation with Pakistan in the future. China is Pakistans northern neighbour and a longtime ally. Hus visit, the first in a decade by a Chinese President, was mainly aimed at promoting economic cooperation.

 The foreign ministry said Pakistan already has placed two research reactors and two other nuclear power plants under IAEAs safeguards.

 Pakistan has been fulfilling its obligations in respect of these agreements and looks forward to continued cooperation with the agency within the framework of the applicable safeguards agreements in future as well, the ministry said in a statement.

 Pakistan, the Islamic worlds only known nuclear weapons state, began operating its first nuclear power station with Canadian assistance near the southern port city of Karachi in 1972.

 Hu today travelled to Lahore and attended a glittering reception in an ancient garden in the heart of the city.

 Hu also visited the mausoleum of renowned national poet Allama Iqbal and strolled in a Moghul-era garden.

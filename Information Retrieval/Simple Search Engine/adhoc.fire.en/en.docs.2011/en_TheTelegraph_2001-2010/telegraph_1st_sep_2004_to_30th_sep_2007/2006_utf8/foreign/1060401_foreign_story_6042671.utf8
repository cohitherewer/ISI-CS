 Casual sex rubbished in survey

 London, March 31: Samantha 

 of Sex and the City, it is fair to say, would not 

 approve. The casual attitude to sexual relations embraced 

 by the most liberated of the characters in the television 

 series turns out not to reflect the views of 21st century 

 women quite as well as widely imagined.

 Researchers investigating female attitudes to sex and their sexuality were surprised to find that most women have rather more traditional, conservative views on one-night stands than they expected. 

 Around nine out of 10 of those questioned felt casual sex was immoral and that those women who engaged in it were not doing so primarily for pleasure.

 They said they felt sorry for women who had one-night stands, that they were lacking something in their lives and if they had not simply lost control through drink and drugs they were seeking emotional rather than physical connection. Dr Sharron Hinchcliffe, a psychologist from the University of Sheffield, presented her findings at the annual conference of the British Psychological Society in Cardiff yesterday.

 Dr Hinchcliffe said: Our results did not fit in with the image we have of todays independent woman who can go out and get sexual fulfilment without the ties of a relationship.

 There was a view that if women had one-night stands they were doing it for reasons other than their own pleasure, more out of a feeling of being desperate, needy or looking for something, or that they had lost control through drink or drugs.

 They said they did it for reasons that were different to those of women in relationships ? which they said were for pleasure and to express their love for their partner. They defined it as deviant behaviour.

 They referred to the women as emulating male behaviour. It was certainly the view that it was not the way women should behave.

 Some of the respondents said these things even though they admitted they had had one-night stands themselves. I was surprised at how judgmental they were.

 Dr Hinchcliffe and colleagues carried out in-depth interviews with 46 women selected from the electoral roll aged 23 to 83, with an average age of 48. Around 10 per cent of the sample disagreed with the majority view of no strings sex as immoral. 

 Some of the participants also expressed concerns about women having casual sex exposing themselves to sexually transmitted disease. An Amnesty International UK survey found that more than a third of people believed a female rape victim was totally or partially responsible if she had behaved in a flirtatious manner with her attacker.

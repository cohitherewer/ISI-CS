 Hasina walks back to House

 Dhaka, Feb. 12 (Reuters): Bangladeshs main Opposition party returned to Parliament today ending a more than year-long boycott, amid cheers from government legislators and a warm welcome by the Speaker.

 Members of the ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party said they hoped legislators from the Awami League, led by former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, would stay in the House and actively participate in legislative business.

 Awami League, with 58 out of Parliaments 300 elected seats, walked out in January last year, saying the Speaker had refused its lawmakers enough time to participate in debate.

 Now we have decided to go back to presenting peoples demands as we dont want to give the government and ruling BNP a chance to ignore them any more, Hasina told reporters.

 Hasina walked into Parliament shortly after other party legislators. Deputies greeted her by thumping their desks.

 Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia was absent as she had left Dhaka today on a three-day visit to Pakistan.

 Hasina and her Awami legislators faced losing their parliamentary membership which would automatically dissolve following abstentions for 90 consecutive business days.

 The deadline for the Awami League was February 14, Parliament officials said.

 Analysts and observers were sceptical Hasina would stay in Parliament very long, saying she had threatened to quit again unless her demands are met.

 Along with more time in debates, the Awami League wants the government to immediately reform the countrys Election Commission, including sacking the chief election commissioner who it says is favouring the government.

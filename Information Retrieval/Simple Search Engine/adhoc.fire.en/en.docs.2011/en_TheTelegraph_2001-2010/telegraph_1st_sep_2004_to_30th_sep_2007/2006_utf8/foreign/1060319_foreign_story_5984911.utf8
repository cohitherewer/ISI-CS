 US snubs Adams

 Adams: Terror links

 Washington, March 18 (Reuters): Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams was delayed at a Washington-area airport yesterday for a secondary security screening, a Homeland Security department official said.

 Adams had been scheduled to fly from Washingtons Reagan National Airport to Buffalo, New York, for St Patricks Day appearances with Democrat Representative Brian Higgins of New York but was unable to make the trip because of the airport delay, said Teresa Kennedy, a spokeswoman for the Congressman.

 Earlier yesterday, Adams, along with Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern and other Irish leaders attended a meeting at the White House with President George W. Bush.

 A Homeland Security official declined to comment when asked if Adamss name had appeared on a terror watch list. Sinn Fein is a political ally of the IRA guerrilla group.

 There are privacy restrictions that preclude us from talking about individuals on no-fly lists, the official said.

 In a statement, Higgins said Adamss name indeed appeared on a terror watch list.

 This is a man who has dedicated the past 25 years of his life to promoting peace and the unification of the 32 counties of Ireland into one united republic, Higgins said. 

 That his name would appear in this untoward manner and that appearance, in the end, ruined his ability to celebrate St Patricks Day in Buffalo is sad and unfortunate when one considers Gerry Adams leadership in the decommissioning of the IRAs weapons and his commitment to the Good Friday agreements.

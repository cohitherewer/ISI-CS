 Code adult rating sought

 London, Jan. 21: The Catholic organisation Opus Dei is asking censors to give the Hollywood version of Dan Browns best-selling novel The Da Vinci Code an adult rating because of the hateful image of the group it portrays.

 Opus Dei, which is often criticised as ultra-conservative and secretive, is particularly angry that a key figure in the story, a self-flagellating monk, is cast as a member and commits a grisly murder at the behest of a delusional bishop.

 It said there were no monks in the order. In addition, the story falsely depicts members lying, stealing, drugging people, and otherwise acting unethically.

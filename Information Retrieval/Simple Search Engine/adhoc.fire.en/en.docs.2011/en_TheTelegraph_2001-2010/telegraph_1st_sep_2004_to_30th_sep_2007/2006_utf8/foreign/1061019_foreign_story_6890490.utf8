 Pak officials pounce on impounded cars

 IMTIAZ GUL

 A Toyota Crown: Luxury lure

 Islamabad, Oct. 18: Officials in the customs department and various ministries have started seizing 200 impounded Toyota Crown luxury cars for their own private use.

 According to officials in the customs directorate of the Central Board of Revenue, the economic coordination committee of the Pakistan cabinet has allowed officials in the customs department and other ministries to use impounded luxury cars.

 The officials are using these cars without entitlement but with maintenance paid by the government.

 According to the English language newspaper The News, the customs department has, in its possession, countless vehicles in the 1000cc and 2800cc range. Some of these cars are already being used by customs officials and by various other government departments. However, the paper said, the officials are entitled to cars within the 1000cc range and not above that. 

 With salaries ranging from (Pakistan) Rs 25,000-Rs 30,000, these customs and income tax officials have triggered a culture of high spending among government servants.

 The Toyota Crown cars have been provided to several officials whose basic salary does not allow them to maintain the expensive vehicles. However, they have managed to maintain the cars at the governments expense.

 Not to be outdone, regional tax commissioners and collectors have also made it a regular practice to use expensive cars without entitlement and whose maintenance is paid by the government. In ninety per cent of the cases, these cars are used for private use.

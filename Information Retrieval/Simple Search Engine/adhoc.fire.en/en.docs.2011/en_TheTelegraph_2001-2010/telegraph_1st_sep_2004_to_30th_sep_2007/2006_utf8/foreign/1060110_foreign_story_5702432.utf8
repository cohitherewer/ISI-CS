 More gas rows likely, says Ukraine leader

 London, Jan. 9 (Reuters): Gas prices in last weeks deal to resolve a dispute between Russia and Ukraine have only been agreed for the next six months, according to a copy of the pact posted on the website of Ukraines ex-premier Yulia Tymoshenko.

 A short-term agreement on gas prices raises the possibility of more rows and supply cuts to Europe this year.

 The pact between the ex-Soviet neighbours aimed to avert a repeat of a New Year supply halt that shook Europe.

 It was hailed as a five-year deal, but according to a version of the contract on Tymoshenkos website, sales prices have been set for a much shorter period.

 Under the deal, the price Russia pays for transporting gas across Ukraine, the route for 80 per cent of its exports to Europe, has been fixed for five years until 2011.

 The document on Tymoshenkos website says Ukraine agreed to pay $95 per 1,000 cubic metres for Russian and Central Asian gas but this price has only been set for the first six months of 2006.

 Under the deal, Gazprom will pay Ukraine transit fees of $1.6 per 1,000 cubic metres per 100 km in cash for the next five years until 1 January 2011. 

 When the deal was announced, officials said Ukraine would buy Russian gas from Gazprom for $230 per 1,000 cubic metres and a mix of Russian and Central Asian gas for $95. Russian gas expert Jonathan Stern said in reality the $95 price covers just Central Asian gas as Russian gas is too expensive for Kiev.

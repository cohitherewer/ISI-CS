 Rowling urged not to kill Potter

 New York, Aug. 2 (Reuters): Two of Americas top authors, John Irving and Stephen King, made a plea to J.K. Rowling yesterday not to kill the fictional boy wizard Harry Potter in the final book of the series, but Rowling made no promises.

 My fingers are crossed for Harry, Irving said at a joint news conference before a charity reading by the three writers at New Yorks Radio City Music Hall. The author of The World According to Garp said he and King felt like warm-up bands for Rowling, who is working on the seventh and last book in the Harry Potter series.

 King, who shot to fame in 1974 with Carrie, said he had confidence that Rowling would be fair to her hero. 

 I dont want him to go over the Reichenbach Falls, King said in a reference to Arthur Conan Doyles effort to kill off the character of Sherlock Holmes. 

 Rowling said she was well into the process of writing the final book. I feel quite liberated, she said. I can resolve the story now and its fun in a way it wasnt before because finally Ive reached my resolution, and I think some people will loathe it and some people will love it, but thats how it should be.

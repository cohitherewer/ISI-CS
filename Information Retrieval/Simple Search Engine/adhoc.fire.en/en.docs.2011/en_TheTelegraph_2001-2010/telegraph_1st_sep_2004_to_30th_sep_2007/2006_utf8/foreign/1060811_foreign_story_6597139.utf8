The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Its just part of travel today

 London, Aug. 10 (Reuters): Chaos reigned at British airports crammed with holidaymakers today as airlines cancelled flights and brought in drastic security measures to thwart what police said was a plot to blow up several aircraft in flight.

 But while departure halls were jammed with people, hand luggage and liquids banned from flights and passengers with babies made to publicly taste their food, the mood was one of calm resignation.

 Its just part of travel today. Its just something you have to do and theres always a risk, and if theyre increasing security this much, were probably safer than usual, said Dale Rosser, 57, queuing at Heathrow to fly back to Michigan.

 Hotels around Heathrow, the worlds busiest international airport, were booked solid. At Terminal One there was a queue more than 100 metres long of people trying to find accommodation further afield.

 Nobody seemed to know what was going on. These was no communication in the airport. But it is your life you are looking at. They are doing the best they can, said Sebastian Hover, 33, trying to get to Warsaw from Bristol.

 Bars and coffee shops did booming business, with Terminal One bar manager Simon Bell saying more was expected tomorrow as people returned to try to resume their journeys. We were frantically busy in the first three hours but it has calmed down a bit now.

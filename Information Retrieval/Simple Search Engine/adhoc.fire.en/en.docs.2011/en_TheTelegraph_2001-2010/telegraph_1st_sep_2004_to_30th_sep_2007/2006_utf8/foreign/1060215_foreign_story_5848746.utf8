 Lost World 2 found

 CHARLES CLOVER

 London, Feb. 14: A treasure trove of undiscovered marine life has been found on an underwater mountain top in the Caribbean.

 Scientists found an average of a new species a day on a 14-day dive on the little-studied Saba Bank Atoll, a submerged volcano which is the worlds third largest coral atoll.

 The Saba Bank Atoll rises from the abyssal depths to just 25 feet below the surface 

 The expedition, which was plagued by high winds and strong currents, found 200 species of fish where only 50 were recorded before, among them two new and undiscovered species of goby.

 The expedition, mounted by scientists from Conservation International, the Smithsonian Institution, and the Netherlands Antilles government, found vast beds of seaweed, which included a dozen new species.

 The area of the coral reef at the top of the sea mount, 150 miles southeast of Puerto Rico in the Dutch Windward islands, extends to 90 square miles.

 Michael Smith, the director of Conservation Internationals Caribbean Biodiversity Initiative, said the atoll was one of the least explored parts of the Caribbean ? despite it being in an important shipping lane and where supertankers frequently anchored on their way to an oil terminal on St Eustatius Island nearby. 

 The discovery of the marine riches on Saba Bank Atoll is the second big find in two months for the American-based charity, which was also partly responsible for the expedition that last week announced it had found a Lost World with unknown species of birds and plants in the west of New Guinea.

 We have been looking for the kinds of places that seem to have fallen through the cracks and not been studied very well, said Mr Smith.

 The scientists said the fragile ecosystems of Saba Bank became damaged by anchors and chains of ships that avoid anchoring fees in the territorial waters of St Eustatius. 

 The large ships also endangered local fishermen of Saba in their small boats, forcing them away from traditional lobster and reef fish grounds.

 Smith said the richness of marine life and vulnerable status of the atolls coral beds made Saba Bank a prime candidate for protection as a particularly sensitive sea area.

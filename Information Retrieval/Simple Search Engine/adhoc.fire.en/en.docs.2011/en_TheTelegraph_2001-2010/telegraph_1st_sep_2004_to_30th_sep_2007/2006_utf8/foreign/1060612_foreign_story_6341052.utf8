 Street clashes in Dhaka

 Dhaka, June 11 (Reuters): At least 200 people were hurt in street clashes between police and opposition activists trying to blockade Bangladeshs capital Dhaka today, witnesses said.

 Police, who used tear gas and baton charges, detained nearly 50 people at Kanchpur, which is on the main Dhaka-Chittagong highway.

 As the battle raged, hundreds of people from nearby villages, brandishing sticks, joined the protesters, forcing police to make a temporary retreat.

 The protesters burned several vehicles, including a police car. Several policemen were hurt by flying rocks, witnesses said.

 Street battles also erupted at three places in Dhaka and two areas just outside the capital. In all over 200 people, including at least 20 policemen, were hurt, and several vehicles damaged, witnesses said.

 Leaders of the opposition Awami League had urged followers to gather at city entry points on Sunday to lay siege to the capital.

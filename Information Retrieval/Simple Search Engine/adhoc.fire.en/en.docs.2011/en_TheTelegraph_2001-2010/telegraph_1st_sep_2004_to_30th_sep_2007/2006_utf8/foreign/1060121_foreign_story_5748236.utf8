 Under pressure, Iran shifts assets

 Tehran, Jan. 20 (Reuters): Embroiled in a nuclear standoff with the West, Iran said today it was moving its foreign assets to shield them from possible UN sanctions and flexed its oil muscles with a proposal to cut Opec output.

 Yes, Iran has started withdrawing money from European banks and transferring it to other banks abroad, said a senior Iranian official, who asked not to be named.

 Central Bank governor Ebrahim Sheibani was quoted earlier as saying Tehran had started shifting funds, but he sidestepped a question on whether the assets would go to accounts in Asia.

 It is far from clear how placing assets in Asia or anywhere abroad would protect them from being frozen as few governments or major banks would be willing to flout UN sanctions openly.

 The US and the EU want the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to refer Iran to the Security Council at an emergency meeting on February 2. 

 The council has the power to impose trade or diplomatic sanctions, though no swift action to punish Iran is likely. Russia and China, which both have major commercial interests at stake in the Islamic Republic, have urged caution.

 Irans ambassador to the IAEA in Vienna said hauling his country to the council would be difficult because of the views of Russia, China and some European and developing countries.

 Worries over Iran helped push oil above $67 today and an Iranian proposal to slash a million barrels a day off Opec production from April was not calculated to calm markets.

 Opec governor Hossein Kazempour Ardebili said the cut was needed because markets are oversupplied by some two million barrels per day, which he said could cause an oil price collapse in the second quarter of the year.

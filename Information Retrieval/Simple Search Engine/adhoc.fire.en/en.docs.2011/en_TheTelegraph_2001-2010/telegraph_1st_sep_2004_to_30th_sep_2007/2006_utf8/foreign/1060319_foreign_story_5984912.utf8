 Parties urge Maoists to end strike

 Kathmandu, March 18 (Reuters): Nepals main political parties piled fresh pressure today on Maoist rebels to end an indefinite road blockade that has raised prices and crippled life across the Himalayan nation this week.

 The blockade called by the anti-monarchy rebels has left roads across Nepal nearly deserted since Tuesday. Maoists also plan to follow it up with a general strike from April 3.

 But Nepals seven main political parties, who have a loose alliance with the rebels against the king, have urged the Maoists to call off the blockade saying it was hurting ordinary people. The parties also fear that the government could use the blockade as an excuse to crack down on a peaceful anti-king rally.

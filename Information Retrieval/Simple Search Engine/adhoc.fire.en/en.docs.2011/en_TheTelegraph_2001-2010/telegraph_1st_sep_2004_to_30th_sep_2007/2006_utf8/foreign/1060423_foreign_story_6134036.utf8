 Denise bar on Sheen

 Denise Richards and Charlie Sheen in happier times

 Los Angeles, April 22 (Reuters): Actor Charlie Sheen was ordered yesterday to keep at least 90 metres away from his estranged wife, actor Denise Richards, and their two young daughters after Richards said in court papers he had been abusive and had threatened to kill her.

 Sheen, star of the hit CBS television series Two and a Half Men, denied the charge and the judge agreed to his request that all telephone conversations between the couple be tape recorded. Sheen was also granted one-day-a-week visitation with his daughters, Sam, 2, and Lola, 10 months, provided it was done under supervision.

 The restraining order is the latest chapter in the stormy marriage between Sheen, a one-time playboy, and model/actor Richards, 35, who filed for divorce from him last December, after less than three years of marriage.

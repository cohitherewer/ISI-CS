 Moss hints at UK return 

 London, Jan. 6: Kate Moss, the model who left the country amid allegations of cocaine abuse, is expected to return to Britain to co-operate with an investigation after police appealed for her to come back.

 Moss, 31, apologised and booked herself into a drug rehabilitation centre in America after pictures of her were published in a national newspaper allegedly showing her taking cocaine. Since then Moss has spent three months in the US rebuilding her career.

 When Moss returns to Britain, it is still unknown whether she will face any charges in relation to the allegations. A spokesman for the models agency, Storm, refused to comment. But a close associate of Moss said she had always had every intention of returning to Britain and to co-operate with the police when work commitments permitted.

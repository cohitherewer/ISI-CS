 Scream verdict

 Edvard Munchs best-known painting The Scream

 Oslo, May 2 (Reuters): A Norwegian court ordered two men to pay $122 million in damages today after convicting them for the 2004 theft of Edvard Munchs masterpieces The Scream and Madonna and then jailing them for seven and eight years.

 The Oslo court also convicted a third man for providing a car for the daylight armed robbery, but did not order him to pay damages. It acquitted three other men. The two 1893 paintings have not been recovered.

 Two gunmen walked into Oslos Munch Museum on August 22, 2004, and pulled the two paintings off the walls in front of dozens of stunned tourists.

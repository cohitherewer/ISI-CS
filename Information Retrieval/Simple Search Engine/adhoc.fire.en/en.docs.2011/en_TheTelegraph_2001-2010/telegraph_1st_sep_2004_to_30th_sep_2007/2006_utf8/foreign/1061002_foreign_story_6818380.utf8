 Russia raises pitch in Georgia spy war

 Tbilisi (Georgia), Oct.1 (Agencies): The commander of Russian military forces in Georgia said his troops had been put on high alert and ordered to shoot to kill to defend their bases, while Russian President Vladimir Putin denounced the Georgian authorities arrest of Russian officers on spying charges as state terrorism and blamed unidentified foreign nations for the crisis.

 General Andrei Popov said the Russian law authorises the military to use force to defend their bases abroad from aggression.

 We are ready to thwart any possible attempts to penetrate our facilities using all means, including shoot to kill, he told reporters.

 Moscow, infuriated by Wednesdays arrest of four Russian officers, recalled its ambassador, evacuated its citizens and denounced Georgia as a bandit state. Ties between Tbilisi and Moscow had already been strained over Georgias bid to join NATO, and allegations that Russia was backing two Georgian separatist provinces. Moscow denies that claim.

 Putin said today in his first public comments on the crisis that the Georgian leadership likened the arrests to the repressions of Soviet dictator Josef Stalins henchman, Lavrenty Beria and denounced it as an act of state terrorism involving the taking of hostages, the Kremlin said in a statement.

 These people think that under the roof of their foreign sponsors they can feel comfortable and secure. Is it really so? Putin questioned, inviting top officials to give their considerations. While Putin didnt name any names, some Russian lawmakers accused the US of instigating Georgian authorities action.

 Those who are doing that believe that anti-Russian course of foreign policy meets the Georgian peoples interests. I dont think so, Putin said.

 Along with some 2,500 peacekeepers in breakaway provinces of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, Russia has between 3,000 and 4,000 troops at two military bases in Georgia that it pledged to withdraw by the end of 2008 under a deal signed last year. Russian General Alexander Baranov, the commander of the North Caucasus military district, said yesterday that Moscow was suspending planning for further withdrawals because of the officers arrests.

 But after making his tough statements, Putin told the Defence Ministry to continue the planned pull-out of Russian troops from Georgia, news agencies quoted his spokesman Alexei Gromov as saying.

 Putin will discuss the situation in Georgia with Russias main political parties later this week, Gromov said.

 EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana spoke by telephone with Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili yesterday, urging him to find a rapid solution and offering assistance.

 The 56-member Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), to which Georgia and Russia belong, appealed today for both sides to refrain from provocation, open a dialogue and seek a peaceful solution.

 OSCE Chairman-in-Office Karel De Gucht said he was in close contact with the foreign ministers of both countries to try to reduce tensions and was ready to travel to the region if needed.

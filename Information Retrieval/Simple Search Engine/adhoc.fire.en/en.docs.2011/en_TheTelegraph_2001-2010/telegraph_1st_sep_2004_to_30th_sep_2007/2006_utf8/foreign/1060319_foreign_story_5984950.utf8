 Tummy tuck trick

 Madrid, March 18 (AP): Spanish surgeons using cranes and ropes removed a 60-kg mass of fat and liquid from the abdomen of a middle-aged woman in the procedure known as a tummy tuck.

 Francisco Javier Gabilondo, chief of plastic surgery at Hospital Cruces near the Basque city of Bilbao, said yesterday the operation was more spectacular than it was difficult. The nine-hour procedure was performed last week. Gabilondo said she suffered from morbid obesity and until now had to sleep with the fatty mass ? known as an abdominal apron ? placed beside her on a table. The medical team had to use cranes to lift the mass and give doctors access to the rest of her body so it could be cut away, Gabilondo said. 

 Steel Shakira statue

be honoured with a five-tonne, five-metre statue set to tower over her equally 

sultry coastal Colombian home town, local media reported. German sculptor Dieter 

Patt donated the work, in steel, which will be erected in a square in the Caribbean 

city of Barranquilla.

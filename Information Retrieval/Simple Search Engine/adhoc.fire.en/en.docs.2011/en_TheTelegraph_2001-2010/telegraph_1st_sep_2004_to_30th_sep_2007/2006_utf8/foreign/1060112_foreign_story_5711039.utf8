 UK MPs free to ban smoking

 London, Jan. 11 (Reuters): A complete ban on smoking in all English pubs and clubs looks increasingly likely after the government said today it would allow its lawmakers to vote according to conscience and not along party lines. 

 The move averts a likely parliamentary revolt and possible defeat for Prime Minister Tony Blair, whose plans propose a smoking ban which would exempt pubs which do not serve food and private clubs.

 Many lawmakers in Blairs Labour party, including some cabinet members, want a total ban and surveys show most Britons support smoke-free pubs and bars.

 A partial ban would put England at odds with Ireland, Northern Ireland and Scotland which have either completely banned smoking or have announced plans to do so. Blairs government bowed to pressure from its MPs after several of them put forward an amendment to remove the exemptions in the law.

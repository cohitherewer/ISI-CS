 Australia cry for babies

 Sydney, July 24 (AFP): The Australian government issued a rallying cry today for its citizens to have more babies, saying the countrys economy depended on a higher fertility rate.

 Treasurer Peter Costello, who once urged families to have one for mum, one for dad and one for the country noted Australias birth rate was on the rise.

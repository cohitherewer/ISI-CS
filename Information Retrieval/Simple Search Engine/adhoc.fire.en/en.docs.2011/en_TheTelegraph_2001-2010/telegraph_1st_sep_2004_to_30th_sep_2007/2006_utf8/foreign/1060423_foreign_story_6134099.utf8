Kathmandu, April 22: The constituents of the 

seven-party alliance have described Indias quick support for King Gyanendras 

offer as completely off-tack and want it to make a course-correction .

Although claiming that India seemed ignorant of the 

peoples sentiment in Nepal, they have left the door open for New Delhi to 

reassess the situation and take corrective action.

They want India to come out in favour of the democratic 

aspirations of the people and not be seen to be supporting the king. India must 

recalibrate and reassess its response, most political leaders here felt. Just 

as the peoples heightened sentiments have forced them to reject the kings 

offer, they are hoping that Delhi would also not remain oblivious to the sentiment 

on the streets of Kathmandu.

How much ground India can retrieve at this stage is 

not very clear. There are people here, however, who claim that with its hasty 

reaction Delhi seems to have lost the chance to stem anti-India sentiments in 

Nepal for years to come.

Much as Delhi might argue that there was an element 

of sincerity in what it did ? posing the issue as compromise with the king 

vs. chaos? this does not was with the Nepalese. The Nepali Congress had 

criticised the Indian reaction last night itself. Today, the other constituents 

of the seven-party alliance joined them.

Our friends, without talking to us decided to 

welcome the kings move. This is not good. India must correct this. India 

has no monarchy and, therefore, has no experience of this kind of deception. When 

the people of Nepal are rejecting the kings offer, how can India go against 

their democratic wishes? asked K.P. Oli, senior leader of the Nepal Communist 

Party (United Marxist Leninist).

Rajendra Mahto of the Nepal Sadbhavna Party (Anandi 

Devi), which largely represents Nepalese of Indian origin, shared his sentiments.

India must rethink its position. The kings 

statement is meant to confuse the international community. Not only India but 

the international community must examine its pros and cons again and support our 

democratic movement, Mahto argued.

Instead of going on the front foot to attack India, 

the political parties are hoping that India will eventually come out on their 

side.

Some of them recognise that India might have wanted 

a marginal role for the king. But they themselves are unable to ignore the sentiment 

against the institution of monarchy on the street.

C.P. Mainali, leader of the United Left Front, found 

Indias reaction inexplicable. They knew what the agenda of the seven-party 

alliance for restoration of democracy was. Why did they think we would accept 

the kings offer when he did not address our key issues? 

And even if we did, why did they think the people 

of Nepal would accept it?

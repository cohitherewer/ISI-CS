 US firm not to harm embryo in new study

 Washington, Aug. 23 (Reuters): A Massachusetts company said today it had developed a way to make human embryonic stem cells without harming the original embryo, a finding it said could dispel ethical objections to promising medical research using such cells.

 It is possible to generate stem cells without destroying the embryo and without destroying its potential for life, said Dr Robert Lanza, chief scientist at Advanced Cell Technology in Massachusetts.

 President George W. Bush last month vetoed an expansion of federal funding for embryonic stem-cell research, saying that US taxpayers, who object to such research, should not have to pay for it. Opponents have a range of objections which include a distaste for manipulating or destroying what they see as a potential human life.

 It (the new finding) at least takes away the Presidents last excuse to oppose the research, Lanza, who led the companys research team, said. Stem cells are the bodys master cells, available from many sources, but many experts believe the most powerful and versatile cells may be those taken from days-old embryos.

 Lanzas team had been saying they had an acceptable alternative to destroying embryos, and today they published their research in the journal Nature. The scientists used a method already employed in fertility treatments to remove one cell from a human embryo without harming it. Then they grew stem cells from that single cell.

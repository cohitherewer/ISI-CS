 New Orleans revelry proves em wrong

 New Orleans, Jan. 1 (Reuters): Thousands of revellers packed the French Quarter to toast the arrival of 2006 today, shake a leg to music by Arlo Guthrie and bid good riddance to a year New Orleans is not likely to forget.

 They said this wasnt gonna happen, mayor Ray Nagin shouted to a cheering throng at a concert outside Jackson Square. They said New Orleans was dead. But we proved them wrong. New Orleans is alive and well.

 The first New Years celebration in the Crescent City since Hurricane Katrina ravaged the central Gulf Coast on August 29 was smaller than usual. Only about one in four residents, by some counts, have returned to the storm-wrecked city, and few tourists have ventured back.

 Thousands of area students, who usually pack Bourbon Street on New Years Eve, have yet to return to colleges and universities shut down by the hurricane. 

 Still, the mood was jubilant as Nagin ticked off the final seconds of 2005. At midnight, a replica of a gumbo pot decorated with New Orleans symbols, including a bottle of hot sauce and a French Quarter street sign, slid down a 25-foot pole atop Jackson Brewery.

 Im so excited about leaving 2005 behind, yall just dont know, Nagin said. 

 You know, 2005, prior to Katrina, was going along pretty good, he said. Our biggest struggle was, we had a murder rate that was escalating. But the economy was doing good. Wed taken 37,000 people off the poverty rolls. The real estate market was hot. Then Katrina changed everything, he told a reporter earlier.

 Guthrie, who performed earlier in the evening, was in town to wrap up a fund-raising tour that has raised more than $100,000 for New Orleans musicians affected by the storm.

 This city is known for its music and its food, said Guthrie, whose 1972 hit City of New Orleans immortalised the train route between Chicago and New Orleans.

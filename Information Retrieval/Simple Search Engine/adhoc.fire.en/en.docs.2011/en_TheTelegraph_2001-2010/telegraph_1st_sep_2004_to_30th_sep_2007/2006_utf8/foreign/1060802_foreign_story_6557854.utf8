 Nepal women

 Kathmandu, 

 Aug. 1 (Reuters): Nepals multi-party government 

 has finalised draft legislation that would allow women to 

 succeed to the throne amid growing debate about the future 

 of monarchy, a minister said today. Under centuries-old 

 royal tradition and present law, only a male can ascend 

 the throne and the king has the sole authority to name his 

 successor.

 London, May 12 (Reuters): Julie Andrews wannabes queued today to audition for a reality TV show with a new twist ? the winner gets the lead role in a new Andrew Lloyd Webber stage production of The Sound of Music.

 The hopefuls came in all shapes, sizes and ages, limbering up with impromptu choruses of Edelweiss before trying to convince the judges they would make the perfect young nun.

 A BBC spokeswoman for the How Do I Solve A Problem Like Maria? show said more than 1,000 hopefuls had applied for the London weekend of auditions at the Wembley conference centre.

 They will be gradually whittled down to 10 finalists with television viewers voting for who should star in the London West End production due to open at the end of the year.

 Lloyd Webber, composer of Cats and Phantom of the Opera, has pledged not to grill would-be stars in the style of Simon Cowell, the acerbic judge on the Pop Idol talent shows popular on both sides of the Atlantic.

 It wont be everyone taking Simon Cowell pot-shots at artists, he has promised.

 Lloyd Webber has said that, ideally, he wants a 20-year-old unknown actress to play the part made famous by Julie Andrews in the classic film about a nun sent to look after the seven Von Trapp children in Austria.

 The name of Hollywood star Scarlett Johansson had originally been mooted as a possible choice for the role of Maria. At todays auditions, some ever optimistic contestants were convinced that age was no barrier.

 Clutching her Sound of Music lyrics, 35-year-old Rachel Cross said: I think I could just push it at my age but I know my chances are slim. But she warned: If the judges are nasty, there could be tears. Another pushing the age barrier for the part was 32-year-old American Amy Royle who has just introduced her son to the film.

 JLo Beach bother

 New York, April 26 (AP): A television writer has filed a lawsuit saying Jennifer Lopez stole his idea for a series based on his move from Brooklyn, New York, to Miami and involvement with the modelling and nightclub scenes.

 Jack Bunicks lawsuit claims South Beach, a TV series produced by Lopez that started on US channel UPN on January 11, mirrors a script he wrote in 1999 for a pilot episode of a show that would have been called South Beach Miami.

 Bunicks script was about two young men from Brooklyn who travel to South Beach, where one of them quickly gets involved with the club and modelling scenes. UPNs website says South Beach is about best friends Matt and Vincent, who abandon their world as they know it and head to the alluring paradise of South Beach.

 Ice palace on ships

 London (Reuters): Two businessmen have 

 shipped 200 tonnes of frozen deoxygenated water from Canada 

 to London to build an ice palace that will go on show in 

 the British capital before making a European tour. The IceSpace, 

 which opens to the public on Monday, will stand for two 

 months on the banks of the Thames river next to the citys 

 landmark Tower Bridge before travelling on to Barcelona 

 and Berlin at the height of the European summer.

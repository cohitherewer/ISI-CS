 Search amp; destroy killers: Putin 

 President Vladimir Putin shakes hands with a boy at the Kremlin Cathedral Square in Moscow on Wednesday. Putin was shown by state television chatting to graduates of military academies before he took a walk through one of the Kremlins courtyards, often full of tourists. He stopped and spoke to a young boy who appeared to be aged four or five and turned away shyly when asked his name. What is your name? Putin asked, kneeling down in front of the fair-haired boy and holding him by the waist. Nikita, the clearly shocked boy answered, looking from side to side. Putin then lifted the boys shirt and kissed him on his stomach. He then patted the boy on the head and walked off through a crowd of astonished tourists. (Reuters)

 Moscow, June 28 (Reuters): Russian President Vladimir Putin today ordered his state security agents to hunt down the killers of four Russian diplomats abducted in Iraq and wipe them out, Interfax news agency quoted the Kremlin as saying.

 The President gave the order to Russian special services to take all measures for finding and eliminating the criminals who carried out the murder of Russian diplomats in Iraq, it quoted the Kremlins press service as saying.

 The head of the FSB state security, Nikolai Patrushev, immediately pledged to see Putins order carried out.

 However much time and effort it requires, we will work to this end, he was quoted by Interfax as saying.

 The diplomats were seized in Baghdad four weeks ago and an al Qaida-led group posted video footage on the Internet last Sunday showing the killing of three men it said were Russian hostages. Russia has acknowledged all four were killed.

 Interfax said Putin made his comments to visiting Saudi prince Salman bin Abdulaziz al-Saud, governor of Riyadh. Putin gave no details of how such a search-and-destroy mission could be mounted in Iraq, where a US-led coalition are fighting attacks by al Qaida militants and other insurgents.

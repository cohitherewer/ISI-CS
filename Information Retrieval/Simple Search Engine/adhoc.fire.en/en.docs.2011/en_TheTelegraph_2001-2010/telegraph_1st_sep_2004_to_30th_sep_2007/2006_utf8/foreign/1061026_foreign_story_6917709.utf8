 Berlin, Oct. 25 (Reuters): Newspaper pictures purporting to show German soldiers desecrating a skull in Afghanistan sparked outrage in the country today, with top ministers calling the images disgusting and ordering an immediate investigation.

 A photograph of a smiling soldier in fatigues posing with a human skull was splashed on the front page top-selling German daily Bild under the headline: Shock photos of German troops.

 The images, apparently taken more than three years ago, come as the German army is seeking to expand its global role nearly 60 years after World War II amid public scepticism. Other photographs showed an unidentified soldier clutching the skull next to his exposed penis and the skull resting on the front wing of a light armoured vehicle. 

 These pictures arouse disgust and horror, defence minister Franz Josef Jung said.

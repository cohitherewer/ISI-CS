 Under fire, Russia to restore gas supplies

 Moscow/Berlin, Jan. 2 (Reuters): A heavily-criticised Russia today promised to restore full gas supplies to Europe after Germany warned that its dispute with Ukraine over deliveries could hurt its long-term credibility as an energy supplier.

 With winter demand already high, gas supplies through Ukrainian pipelines to Europe started to fall off dramatically as a result of the Russian blockade, prompting western fears about insecurity in the energy sector.

 Russia, which took over the G8 chairmanship for the first time this month and has sought to promote itself as a reliable energy source, cut its neighbours gas supplies yesterday after Ukraine rejected Moscows demand for a fourfold price rise.

 As criticism mounted, the state-controlled gas monopoly Gazprom said it would restore full gas supplies through the pipeline to Europe by tomorrow evening, and that it had piped across an extra 95 million cubic metres of gas. But it made clear it held Ukraine responsible for the problem.

 With the aim of preventing a possible energy crisis caused by Ukraine illegally taking gas, Gazprom has taken the decision to deliver additional gas into the gas transport system of Ukraine, the company said.

 We stress that the additional delivery of gas is not designed for Ukrainian consumers but is meant for transit through the territory of Ukraine for delivery to consumers outside the borders of Ukraine.

 Ukraine, which denies stealing any gas, accused Russia of blackmail, saying Moscow wanted to destabilise its economy.

 Russia said it had had no choice but to turn off the taps after Ukraine refused to sign a new contract that would have ended the preferential price treatment of the Soviet era.

 German economy minister Michael Glos, Russias biggest gas customer, said Moscow must act responsibly and show it could be trusted as a supplier.

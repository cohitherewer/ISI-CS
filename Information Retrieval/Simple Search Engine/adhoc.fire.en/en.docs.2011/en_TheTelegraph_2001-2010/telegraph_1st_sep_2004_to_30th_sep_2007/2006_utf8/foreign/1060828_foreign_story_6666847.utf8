 Iran N-policy

 Tehran, Aug. 27 (Reuters): Iran today insisted it would never stop uranium enrichment despite a looming UN deadline intended to ensure it cannot develop atomic weapons.

 Iran will continue its uranium enrichment. We want to produce our own nuclear fuel, Irans chief nuclear negotiator Ali Larijani said. We will never stop it.

 The UN Security Council has told Iran to suspend atomic fuel work by August 31 or face possible sanctions. The West suspects Iran is secretly pursuing nuclear arms but Tehran insists its only aim is to generate electricity.

 Any measure to deprive Iran of its right will not change our mind about our aim, Larijani said.

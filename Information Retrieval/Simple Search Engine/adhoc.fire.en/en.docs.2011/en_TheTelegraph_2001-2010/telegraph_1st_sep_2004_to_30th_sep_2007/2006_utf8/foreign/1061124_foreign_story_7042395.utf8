 Islamabad, Nov. 23 (Reuters): Chinese President Hu Jintao arrived in Pakistan today for a visit that is expected to cement an all-weather relationship.

 Hu arrived from India where he agreed with leaders to expand economic relations, sweep away mistrust and speed up efforts to resolve border disputes.

 Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf met Hu at the airport where he was greeted by a 21-gun salute.

 Hu will be keen to demonstrate Chinas steadfast support for Pakistan and is expected to sign a broad range of agreements to underline that despite warming Indian ties, analysts said.

 Theres a redefining of the relationship. The Chinese are demonstrating theyre keen to have strong relations with both Pakistan and India, said former Pakistani foreign secretary Tanvir Ahmad Khan. This is partly because China does not want to leave the South Asian sub-continent to other external powers.

 Theyll try to demonstrate that friendship with India is not at the expense of Pakistan, he said.

 Hus visit is the first by a Chinese President in a decade and marks the 55th anniversary of diplomatic relations.

 Tomorrow, Hu will deliver a live television address to the Pakistani nation, the first foreign leader to do so since former President Bill Clinton in 2000.

 The constancy of the China-Pakistan friendship contrasts sharply with the on-off relationship Pakistan has had with the US.

 China is the only country, when it comes to the national security of Pakistan, which Islamabad trusts. No one else, said Tarique Niazi, an analyst at the University of Wisconsin, who has written extensively on Sino-Pakistan relations.

 For the past five years, Pakistan has been a US ally in a global war on terrorism, and has been supplied with long-coveted US weapons and generous aid.

 Analysts believe China has supported Pakistans missile and nuclear weapons programme for decades. It is also Pakistans main supplier of conventional arms and provides hundreds of millions of dollars of development finance.

 Two-way trade increased 39 per cent last year to $4.26 billion, according to Chinese figures. The two countries are expected to announce a free trade agreement which they hope will push trade past $8 billion by 2008. They also want each others help to secure energy supplies.

 Pakistan wants China to help it build civil nuclear plants something the US refuses to do because of the role played by Pakistans former top scientist in a nuclear proliferation scandal.

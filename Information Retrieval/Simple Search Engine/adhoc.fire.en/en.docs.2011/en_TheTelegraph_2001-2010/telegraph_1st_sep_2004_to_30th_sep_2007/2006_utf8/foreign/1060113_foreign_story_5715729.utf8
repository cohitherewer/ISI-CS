 EU trio pushes Iran to UN

 Berlin, Jan. 12 (Reuters): The EUs three biggest powers said today that talks with Iran had reached a dead end and agreed it should be hauled before the UN Security Council over its nuclear programme.

 Accusing Tehran of turning its back on the international community, they said it had consistently breached its commitments and failed to show the world its nuclear activities were peaceful.

 Our talks with Iran have reached a dead end, German foreign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said after talks in Berlin with his British and French counterparts and EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana.

 A joint statement from the EU3 countries said: We believe the time has now come for the Security Council to become involved. They said they would call for an extraordinary meeting of the board of governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN nuclear watchdog, to seek a referral to the council, which has the power to impose sanctions.

 Oil prices climbed to a three-month high as mounting tension over Iran stoked fears of supply disruption from the worlds fourth biggest crude exporter, though they later pulled back.

 US crude futures were up 76 cents to $64.70 by 1702 GMT, easing from a session high of $64.90, which was the highest level since early October.

 After holding a news conference, the EU ministers headed straight to a teleconference on Iran with US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice.

 The announcement by the EU3 signified the end of two and a half years of attempts to convince Iran to abandon its uranium enrichment programme, which they suspect it intends to use to produce fuel for nuclear weapons.

 Iran says it only aims to develop a civilian nuclear power programme in accordance with international law. It said today it was not worried by the threat of referral to the Security Council.

 Tehran raised the stakes on Tuesday when it began to remove IAEA seals on equipment used to enrich uranium. 

 In their statement, the EU3 deliberately did not mention the possibility of UN sanctions, an option they are holding in reserve in the hope that simply bringing Iran to the Security Council will persuade it to comply.

 Russia and China, permanent council members with veto powers, will hold the key to deliberations.

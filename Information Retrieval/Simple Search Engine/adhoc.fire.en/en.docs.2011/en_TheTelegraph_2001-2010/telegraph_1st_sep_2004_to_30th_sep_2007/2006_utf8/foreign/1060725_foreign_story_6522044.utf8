 Beirut, July 24 (Reuters): US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice flew to Lebanon today and a Lebanese source said she had insisted Hizbollah release two Israeli soldiers and pull back from the border before any ceasefire.

 Rice met Prime Minister Fouad Siniora after arriving by helicopter from Cyprus in Beirut, a city pounded by Israeli air strikes almost every day since the 13-day-old war began. Thank you for your courage and steadfastness, she told Siniora, who has repeatedly pleaded for an immediate ceasefire.

 But Rice later told Shia parliament speaker Nabih Berri, who is an ally of Hizbollah and is also close to Syria, that the situation on the border cannot return to what it was before July 12, a Lebanese political source said.

 Rice was referring to the day Hizbollah captured the two Israeli soldiers. The source quoted her as saying there would be no ceasefire before Hizbollah freed the pair unconditionally and pulled its forces back about 20 km from the border. The tone of the meeting was very negative, the source said.

 Another source said Rice had also proposed deployment of the Lebanese army on the border, backed by an international force.

 On her way to the region, Rice said she wanted to create conditions for a sustainable ceasefire in a war that has cost 377 dead in Lebanon and at least 37 Israeli lives in 13 days.

 Washington has blamed the conflict on Hizbollah and the Shia groups allies in Syria and Iran. I am deeply concerned about the Lebanese people and what they are enduring, Rice said before meeting Berri. 

 British Prime Minister Tony Blair said he hoped a peace plan would emerge within days that could lead to a ceasefire.

 Hizbollah said it had shot down an Israeli helicopter and hit five tanks, inflicting casualties in fierce battles that erupted after Israeli forces pushed north from a border village.

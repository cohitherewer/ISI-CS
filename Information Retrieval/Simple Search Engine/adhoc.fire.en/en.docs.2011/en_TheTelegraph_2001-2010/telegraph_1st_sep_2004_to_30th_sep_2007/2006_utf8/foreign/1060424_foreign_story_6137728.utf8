 Iran raises pitch before key session

 Tehran, April 23 (Reuters): Irans decision to enrich uranium is irreversible, its foreign ministry said today in defiance of international demands it halt all nuclear work.

 Iran, accused by western nations of seeking nuclear bombs, said this month it had enriched uranium for the first time to a level used in power stations.

 Irans uranium enrichment and nuclear research and development activities are irreversible, foreign ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi told a weekly news conference.

 Western nations have threatened to seek sanctions on Iran if it does not stop enrichment. The US has not ruled out military action, a step other western states, as well as Russia and China, oppose.

 The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is due to report by April 28 on whether Iran is complying with a UN demand that it halt enrichment, a process that can have civilian and military uses.

 If the (IAEA) report contains expert assessment, there will be nothing left to worry about, Asefi said.

 However, if the report comes out and somehow puts pressure on Iran or speaks with a language of threats, naturally Iran will not abandon its rights and it is prepared for all possible situations and has planned for them, he said.

 Iran says its nuclear programme is purely for generating electricity. Western nations say the only way for Tehran to prove it is not seeking atomic bombs is to renounce all sensitive nuclear technology.

 French foreign minister Philippe Douste-Blazy said he was very worried by Irans latest statement, but said a military option was not on the agenda.

 When I see this declaration today that tells us that the enrichment is irreversible, we are extremely concerned, he told Paris radio station Radio J.

 Top US congressional intelligence committee members said Washington did not have enough intelligence to know if Iran was capable of producing nuclear weapons in the near future.

 Weve got a long way to go in rebuilding our intelligence community.... We dont have all of the information we would like to have, House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Chairman Peter Hoekstra, a Republican, said.

 Jane Harman, a senior Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, also said US intelligence was thin. Just the fact that the Iranian government is making a lot of noise doesnt prove their capabilities, she said.

 Iran has stoked worries in the West by saying it is pressing ahead with research and development on advanced P-2 centrifuges, which can enrich uranium faster than its existing P-1 units.

 So far, we have never used P-2 centrifuges, Asefi said. He added that Iran was still discussing a plan to enrich uranium on Russian soil.

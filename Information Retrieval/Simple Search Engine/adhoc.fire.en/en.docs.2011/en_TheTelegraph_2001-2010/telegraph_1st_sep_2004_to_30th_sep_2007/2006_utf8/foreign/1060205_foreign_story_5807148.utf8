 Game show stampede near Manila

 Manila, Feb. 4 (PTI): At least 73 people were killed and nearly 400 injured today in a stampede at a stadium near the Philippines capital Manila where hundreds had queued up to watch a popular game show similar to Kaun Banega Crorepati.

 The incident took place at 9 am local time at Pasig, 15 km from here, when the organisers of the show Wowowee announced that all entrances except one would be closed as hundreds of people had lined up at the stadium to watch it.

 Philippines national Red Cross, which had earlier said that 88 people were killed and over 200 injured in the stampede, revised the figure saying 73 people were killed and 392 were hurt. Most had been treated and released. 

 President Abdul Kalam, who is on a state visit here, condoled the loss of lives in the stampede during talks with his Philippines counterpart Gloria Arroyo.

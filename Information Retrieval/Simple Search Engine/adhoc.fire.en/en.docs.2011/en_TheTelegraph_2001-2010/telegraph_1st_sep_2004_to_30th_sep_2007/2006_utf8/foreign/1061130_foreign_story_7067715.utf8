The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 UK author says cancer forced him to write

 NIGEL REYNOLDS

 London, 

 Nov. 29: A former rock singer and publisher was 

 celebrating yesterday in his own way after his debut 

 novel, which had taken him 30 years to write, was shortlisted 

 for one of the countrys top literary prizes.

 Michael Cox, blind in one eye from a rare form of cancer, and only a week out of hospital as a result of a heart attack brought on by treatment, said the success of the book was helping to keep him going.

 I feel absolutely overwhelmed, he told The Daily Telegraph. I got an inkling of this when I was lying in a fairly unpleasant NHS ward two weeks ago. It was a great, transforming experience and has sent my spirits soaring.

 I have been ill for so long and I have had so many bad moments, really very bad moments. My wife has also had to be treated for cancer of the tongue and without this we couldnt have coped.

 The book has transformed our lives but I must say that once the highs have gone the pleasures are quite muted because life has changed big time. I have lost the sight of my left eye, I may lose the sight in my right and I dont know about the future.

 Cox, 58, was one of four novelists shortlisted yesterday in the best first novel section of the Costa Book Awards.

 Iran gamble

 Tehran, June 23 (Reuters): Iran will halt its massive petrol imports from September 23 and impose fuel rationing, the oil minister said today ? a political gamble in a country where subsidised fuel is viewed as a national right.

 Parliamentarians in the worlds fourth biggest oil producer approved a budget for the year to March 2007 that cut the amount to be spent on petrol imports to $2.5 billion from $4 billion.

 This meant President Mahmoud Ahmadinejads populist government, which draws its support from the poor, was faced with an unappetising choice of hiking petrol prices or rationing, both potential sources of social discontent.

 Fighting flares in Afghanistan

 Kandahar, May 18 (Reuters): Afghanistan saw one of its bloodiest days since the 2001 overthrow of the Taliban today as hundreds of insurgents attacked a southern town and fighting flared across the country.

 Fighting raged for hours after insurgents attacked the town of Mosa Qala in Helmand province. In a separate incident, a suicide car bomber attacked a convoy in Herat town, killing himself and an American civilian.

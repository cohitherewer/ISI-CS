 Study: Gene dual role in ageing

 Paris, Sept. 7 (AFP): Scientists delving into the mysteries of ageing have uncovered a key gene that could explain why tissues decline as the years pass.

 The gene, Inka, controls a protein whose role is to promote longevity by suppressing the development of cancer cells.

 But, with ageing, the gene becomes more and more active and eventually interferes with mechanisms by which new, replacement cells are born to regenerate body tissue, according to the three new studies.

 The good news is that we can get older before we get cancer, said Sean Morrison, director of the Center for Stem Cell Biology at the University of Michigan, who lead-authored one of the three parallel studies that appear today in Nature, the weekly British science journal. 

 The research, conducted on laboratory mice, looked at levels of the genes so-called P16 INK4A protein in several different areas that give birth to stem cells, the precursors of tissue-specific cells.

 These areas were the brains olfactory centre; the bone marrow, where blood cells are generated; in the pancreas, the home of beta cells that make the hormone insulin.

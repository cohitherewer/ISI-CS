 Baghdad, May 7 (Reuters): Car bombs killed 30 people in Iraq today and wounded more than 70 in one of the bloodiest spasms of violence of recent weeks as political leaders sought a deal to form a national unity government.

 The southern city of Basra was quiet as British forces examined the wreck of a helicopter, apparently shot down yesterday with the loss of up to five British troops. Five Iraqis had died in hours of violence after the crash as soldiers clashed with youths chanting triumphal Shia militia slogans.

 At least 21 people were killed and 52 wounded when a suicide bomber detonated a car on a crowded street in the Shia holy city of Kerbala, police and doctors said.

 Iraqi and US leaders have branded such attacks Sunni al Qaida ploys to spark a sectarian war with Shia Muslims.

 Around the same time, two cars exploded in the capital.

 A suicide car bomber hit an Iraqi army patrol in the restive Sunni district of Aadhamiya, killing eight people and wounding 15. Soldiers and civilians were among the casualties.

 Iraqi and US forces had conducted a sweep for Sunni guerrillas in the area yesterday, the US military said.

 Also in north Baghdad, second car bomb exploded at a busy intersection near the offices of a government-funded newspaper, killing one civilian and wounding five.

 In Kerbala, the police chief told a news conference only two people had died in the bombing. But police and medical officials who declined to be named stood by their casualty figures.

 The blast decimated crowds going about their business at the start of the working week, close to a partially built Shia mosque and 500 metres from the main bus station. A dozen other vehicles burned out as a result of the blast.

 Interior ministry sources said 42 bodies had been found in the last 24 hours in the capital alone, including eight dumped near Kindi hospital in central Baghdad. The figure is in line with levels of violence seen since sectarian bloodshed spiked up after the bombing of a Shia shrine on February 22.

 More than 100,000 people have registered with the government as refugees since then and the number is rising, officials said. Many others have fled homes without informing the authorities.

 Sunni leaders blame pro-government Shia militias and the Shia-dominated police for some of the sectarian killing. 

 Sectarian bloodshed has prompted warnings Iraq is sliding towards civil war, and added urgency to efforts by political leaders to form a unity government that can reverse the trend.

 Nuri al-Maliki, the Shia Islamist nominated as Prime Minister two weeks ago after months of stalemate following Decembers election, says he expects to name a cabinet shortly.

Yesterday, the Shia Vice- President said he expected 

a deal in the next few days.

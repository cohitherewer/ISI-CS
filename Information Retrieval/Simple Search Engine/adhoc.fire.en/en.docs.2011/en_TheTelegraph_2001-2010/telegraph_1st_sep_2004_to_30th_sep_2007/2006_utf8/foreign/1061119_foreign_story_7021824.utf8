The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Mills opens up, but not on divorce

 London, Nov. 18 (AP): Heather Mills McCartney was giving her first television interview since announcing her plans to divorce Paul McCartney but would not discuss her breakup with the former Beatle, her spokesman said.

 Phil Hall, a London-based publicist, said Mills McCartney, 38, had flown to New York to give an interview to the celebrity gossip show Extra that was being recorded yesterday and would be broadcast next week.

 He said Mills McCartney had agreed to discuss her vegan diet, her health-and-fitness regime but not the divorce.

 He was responding to myriad reports in British tabloid newspapers and US celebrity-gossip websites that claimed Mills McCartney was about to give a tell-all interview to Extra, a daily programme syndicated on the NBC network.

 McCartney, 64, and Heather Mills McCartney announced their separation in May after four years of marriage and began divorce proceedings in July.

 Singapore, Dec. 28 (Reuters): Asias telecommunications services were partly restored today after earthquakes off Taiwan cut undersea cables and knocked millions of users offline, but with few alternative routes, access was slow and patchy.

 Telephone traffic was back to normal in some parts of Asia but many operators in north Asia struggled to get up to full speed a day after business and home users from Seoul to Sydney were hit by one of the worst tech disruptions in Asia.

 Internet access in many countries had also improved today although many customers complained of slow connections.

 Chunghwa Telecom, Taiwans top phone company, said it could take up to three weeks to repair six submarine cables owned by a consortium of telecoms firms.

 Two powerful quakes off Taiwan on Tuesday, one of magnitude 7.1, severed the cables. At least five maintenance ships based in the region are heading for the waters near southern Taiwan to repair the undersea cables, Hong Kongs telecoms regulator said.

 In general, it requires about five to seven days to repair the cables, the regulator said. However, due to the earthquake, the seabed may have been damaged and there may be further earthquakes that will affect the maintenance work.

 The main quake struck off Taiwans southern coast at 1226 GMT on Tuesday, killing two people. 

 Businesses across the region ground to a halt, although many said it was fortunate that the breakdown happened in the middle of the quiet holiday period.

 Voice services to the US, Japan, Canada, China and Singapore have been restored as of 0500 GMT, an official at Chunghwa said. However, services to Hong Kong remain seriously disrupted, with only 27.6 per cent functioning, while those to Southeast Asia were about 50 per cent.

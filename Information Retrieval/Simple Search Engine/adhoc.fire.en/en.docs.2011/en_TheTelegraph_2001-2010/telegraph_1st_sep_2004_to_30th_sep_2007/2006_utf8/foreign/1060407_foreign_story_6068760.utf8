 Lost, found in Japan

 Tokyo, April 6 (Reuters): Three Singaporeans were found safe today after getting lost on what they said was a mission to find a legendary karate expert on a snowy mountainside in Japan.

 One of the three men told police in Hirosaki, near the northern tip of Japans main island, that they had come to Japan after his dying father, a martial arts expert, had ordered them to seek out the karate teacher, TV Asahi said on its website. 

 Japan looked so small on the world map that we thought we would be able to find him straight away, one of the group was quoted as saying. All three were dressed in light clothing and huddling in an abandoned car when they were rescued from the slopes of 1,600-metre Mount Iwaki.

 Litter at your own cost

 London (Reuters): New powers which allow local authorities to issue stiffer, on-the-spot fines of up to 80 pounds for littering, scrawling graffiti or failing to clear up dog mess come into force on Thursday. Under the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act, councils can now take action against a range of anti-social behaviour. People who leave burglar alarms ringing for 20 minutes or more could be fined ?100 pounds and those who create a nuisance by repairing their car on the street will face on-the-spot penalties. Councils will also be able to fine people caught fly-posting. Other measures include charging stores for the recovery of abandoned shopping trolleys.

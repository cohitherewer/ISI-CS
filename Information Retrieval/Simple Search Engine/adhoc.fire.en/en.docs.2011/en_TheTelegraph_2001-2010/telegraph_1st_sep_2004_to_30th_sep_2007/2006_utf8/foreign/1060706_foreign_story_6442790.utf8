 Europe to slap green tax on air passengers

 BEN WEBSTER

 London, July 5: Air passengers will be charged up to ?40 extra for a return ticket within Europe to pay for the environmental impact of their journeys, under plans approved by European Parliament yesterday. 

 Members of European Parliament (MEP) voted in favour of the immediate introduction of a tax on jet fuel for flights within the 25-member states of the EU. The charge would double the cost of millions of budget airline flights. 

 They also accepted a recommendation for a special emissions trading scheme for the aviation industry, which would see airlines buying permits to cover their output of carbon dioxide. 

 Aviation is the fastest growing source of greenhouse gases and flights within Europe are on course to double by 2020 and triple by 2030. 

 British Airways and other European airlines have been lobbying for a more lenient scheme that would compensate for only a small portion of their emissions and cost the average passenger less than ?1.50 per flight. 

 But Parliament rejected BAs argument that the impact of aviation on the environment was not sufficiently understood and, therefore, the scheme should be limited. 

 MEPs voted by 439 to 74 to adopt the proposal. 

 The main proposal was for airlines to be forced to buy emission permits within a separate trading scheme dedicated to aviation, with a specific cap on the amount of carbon dioxide. 

 BA had wanted to be allowed virtually unlimited growth by being able to buy cheap surplus permits from other industries. Parliament also dismissed BAs proposal for airlines to be allocated free permits to cover their existing level of emissions. BA wanted the scheme to focus on additional flights. 

 The MEPs said the scheme should cover all flights arriving at or departing from EU airports rather than just intra-EU flights, as had been proposed by BA. But it is likely to be limited to flights within Europe in the early years to avoid legal challenges from the US and other countries. 

 The MEPs also accepted the proposal for a separate environmental tax to cover the impact of nitrogen oxides and condensation trails emitted by aircraft. When emitted at altitude, these emissions trap heat in the Earths atmosphere. Parliament accepted that aviations total contribution to global warming was two to four times greater than the impact of carbon dioxide alone, and that airlines should be forced to pay for this. 

 The GreenSkies Alliance, a coalition of environmental groups that opposes the growth of aviation, said passengers would have to pay up to pounds 20 per flight, or pounds 40 return, to cover the cost of purchasing just the CO2 permits for flights within Europe. A jet fuel tax and an environmental tax would push ticket prices up even further but the costs are harder to quantify. 

 Jeff Gazzard, of the alliance, said: quot;The huge European Parliament majority shows that MEPs overwhelmingly recognise that air transports greenhouse gas emissions are out of control and urgent action to control them is long overdue. quot; 

 The parliaments vote will strongly influence legislation being drafted by the European Commission and due to be debated later this year. The emissions trading scheme is due to be introduced in 2008 but commission officials admit it could be delayed until 2010. 

 Andrew Sentance, BAs head of environmental affairs, admitted that aviation could account for almost half of Britains total CO2 emissions by 2050, compared with 6 per cent today. 

 Even assuming a fast introduction of fuel-efficient technology and a reduction in the rate of growth of flights, aviations share of total emissions would still triple. 

 He said that imposing a cap on aviation emissions would quot;deny society the right to make choices quot; about how to tackle climate change. He said society might prefer to continue to allow flights to grow but to reduce emissions elsewhere to compensate, such as in power generation or road transport.

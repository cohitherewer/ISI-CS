 Bush ex-aide in shoplifting net

 JENNY EAGLE 

 London, March 12: A former senior White House aide has been arrested on shoplifting charges, causing an embarrassed President George W. Bush shock and disappointment. 

 Claude Allen, 45, who resigned last month as the Presidents top domestic policy adviser, is alleged by police in Montgomery County, Maryland, to have claimed refunds for more than $5,000 worth of merchandise he had not bought. He had been under investigation since January over 25 alleged thefts from Target and Hechts department stores. 

 If the allegations are true, Claude Allen did not tell my chief of staff and legal counsel the truth, and thats deeply disappointing, Bush said. 

 If the allegations are true, something went wrong in Allens life, and that is really sad. 

 Allen was the number two official at the health and human services department before being appointed domestic policy adviser at the White House early last year. 

 The arrest stemmed from an incident at a Target store on January 2 when Allen, of Gaithersburg, Maryland, was allegedly seen by a Target employee to place items in an empty Target bag and others in a shopping cart. Using a receipt, he is said to have sought a refund for the goods in the bag. 

 Allen is also accused of carrying out similar transactions at other stores, receiving refunds to his credit cards of more than $5,000. 

 Allen has claimed it was all a misunderstanding and cited confusion with his credit card because he had moved several times.

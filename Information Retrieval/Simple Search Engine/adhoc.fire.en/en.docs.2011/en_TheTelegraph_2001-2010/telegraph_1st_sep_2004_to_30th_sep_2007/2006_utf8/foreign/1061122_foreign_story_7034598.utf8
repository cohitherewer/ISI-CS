 No Hobbit for Rings director

 Jackson: Calling Frodo

 Los Angeles, Nov. 21 

 (Reuters): Where is Frodo when you need him?

 Director Peter Jackson has been told he will not be hired to direct a movie based on J.R.R. Tolkien novel The Hobbit, despite the nearly $3 billion global box office success of his Lord of the Rings trilogy, according to a letter Jackson wrote to fan site TheOneRing.net.

 The trilogy of movies is based on Tolkiens fantastic tale of an epic war among wizards, sorcerers, elves, villainous orcs and friendly little hobbits of whom the novels hero, Frodo, is one. It is Frodo who eventually saves the day. The Hobbit is a fairy tale-like story that Tolkien wrote before the Rings trilogy.

 In Jacksons letter, which was posted on the website late on Sunday, the director said last week a top executive with Los Angeles-based New Line Cinema called him to say the studio was moving ahead on The Hobbit movie without Jackson. 

 This was a courtesy call to let us know that the studio was now actively looking to hire another filmmaker, Jackson wrote.

 Hillary weighs bid

 New York, Nov. 8 (Reuters): Democratic Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, widely believed to be weighing a bid for the White House, won re-election yesterday to a second term in the US Senate.

 The message couldnt be clearer that its time for a new force, the former First Lady said in a victory speech after defeating Republican challenger John Spencer.

 New Yorkers and Americans want an end to the culture of corruption and the dominance of special interests and a new beginning to our beloved country, Clinton added. Clinton had been expected to win easily, having outpolled Spencer, the former mayor of Yonkers, by more than 30 percentage points in a state where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by a 5-3 ratio.

 Her second Senate term in hand, Clinton now faces widespread speculation that she will pursue higher political office. Prior to Election Day, Clinton insisted she was concentrating on her re-election campaign and had not made a decision on a White House bid.

 New York Republicans tried to make an issue of her possible higher political ambitions but most voters indicated it made no difference in whether they would re-elect her to the Senate. Political analysts noted Clinton has tried to broaden support in upstate New York.

 An anti-war candidate challenged Clinton for the Democratic Senate nomination, taking issue with her vote in Congress to support the US-led war in Iraq, but he gained little traction. Clinton enjoyed fat campaign coffers, having raised $35 million while Spencer raised less than $4 million. She also enjoyed celebrity status during the race.

 Blair, Prodi launch attacks 

on veil

 London, Oct. 17 (Reuters): Two European leaders separately voiced concern over the Muslim veil today, with Britains Tony Blair calling it a mark of separation and Italys Romano Prodi saying that it should not be used to hide behind.

 Both leaders said the wearing of full veils presented difficulties for their nations with Muslim communities and immigrants needing to integrate into western societies.

 It is a mark of separation and thats why it makes other people from outside the community feel uncomfortable, Prime Minister Tony Blair said when asked his opinion on the veil, which has become a hot topic in Britain in recent weeks.

 In Italy, Prime Minister Romano Prodi said it was a matter of common sense that people show their faces in public.

 You cant cover your face. If you have a veil, fine, but you must be seen, Prodi said. This is common sense I think, it is important for our society. 

 Neither Britain nor Italy restrict the wearing of the veil, but Italy has in the past had laws against covering the face in public as an anti-terrorism measure.

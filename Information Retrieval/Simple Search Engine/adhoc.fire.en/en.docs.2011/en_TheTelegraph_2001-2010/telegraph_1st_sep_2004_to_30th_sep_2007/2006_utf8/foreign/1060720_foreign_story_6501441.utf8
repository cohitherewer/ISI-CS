 US hotel chain to be smoke-free

 Washington, July 19 (AP): Hotel operator Marriott International Inc. said today that all of its hotels in the US and Canada will be smoke-free starting in September.

 The company said the move is the largest in the industry, with more than 2,300 hotels and corporate apartments and nearly 400,000 guest rooms under the Marriott, JW Marriott, Ritz-Carlton, Renaissance, Courtyard, Residence Inn, SpringHill Suites, Fairfield Inn, TownePlace Suites and Marriott ExecuStay brands involved.

 The new policy means that smoking will not be allowed in all guest rooms, restaurants, lounges, meeting rooms, public space and employee work areas.

 Creating a smoke-free environment demonstrates a new level of service and care for our guests and associates, chairman and chief executive J.W. Marriott Jr. said. The company said that currently more than 90 per cent of Marriott guest rooms are already designated as non-smoking.

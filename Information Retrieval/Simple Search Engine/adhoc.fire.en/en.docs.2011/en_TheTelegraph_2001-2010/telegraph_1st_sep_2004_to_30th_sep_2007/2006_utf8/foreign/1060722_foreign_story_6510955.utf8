 Fuelled by Julia

 Dallas, July 21 (AP): Oscar-winning actress Julia Roberts is making another debut: this time as a spokeswoman for alternative fuel.

 Dallas-based Earth Biofuels announced that Roberts will become a spokeswoman for the company and chair its new advisory board.

 Its very important that we expand our use of clean energy and make a long-term commitment to it. Biodiesel and ethanol are better for the environment and for the air we breathe, Roberts said.

 Roberts joins fellow Oscar winner Morgan Freeman and country singer Willie Nelson in promoting the use of renewable fuels.

 Kate look

 London (Reuters): Actress Kate Hudson 

 accepted libel damages on Thursday from a magazine that 

 printed a photo making her look too skinny, alongside an 

 article that said her movie star mother Goldie Hawn wanted 

 her to eat more. Hudson had sued the UK Enquirer 

 magazine over the article under the headline Goldie 

 Tells Kate: Eat Something! Her lawyer Simon Smith 

 said the story and pictures implied Hudson had recklessly 

 and foolishly endangered her health.

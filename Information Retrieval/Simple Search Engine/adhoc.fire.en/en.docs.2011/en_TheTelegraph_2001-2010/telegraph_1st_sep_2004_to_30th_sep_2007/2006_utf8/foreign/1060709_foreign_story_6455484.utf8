 UK church to ordain women as bishops

 London, July 8 (Reuters): The Church of England voted today to ordain women as bishops, a major liberalising step in a faith that has also faced schism over homosexuality, although it could be years before the first woman bishop is named.

 The English church has ordained women as priests for a decade and one in six parish priests is now a woman. But the church maintained what critics called a stained-glass ceiling that prevented women from rising to the rank of bishop.

 At their synod in the northern English city of York, the three houses of laity, priests and bishops each voted overwhelmingly in favour of a motion that declared ordaining women bishops to be compatible with church teaching.

 This means it is consonant with the faith, a spokesman for the synod said. But while the vote resolves the theological question, the church must still amend its rules, a process that requires a two-thirds majority vote and could take years.

 Opponents of woman bishops are holding out for compromise measures, like a proposal that would allow conservative parishes to secede from woman-run diocese.

 The issue has been one of several that pit traditionalists against liberalisers within the worlds 77-million-strong Anglican communion.

 Most church leaders say that as long as women can be priests they deserve to be able to reach the top ranks.

 We are the only profession that doesnt have equality of opportunity, said Canon Patience Purchas, a retired church worker who has campaigned for women to be made bishops. Its a waste of some very able women.

 But conservatives say that the 12 apostles of Jesus were all men and there is no precedent for women as bishops.

 The Bible insists that both at home and in the church there are differences between the role of men and women, said Rod Thomas, spokesman for the Evangelical group Reform. 

 They are equal in every respect in terms of status and salvation, but their roles are supposed to be carried out differently.

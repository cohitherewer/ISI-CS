 Islamabad, Nov. 8: A cloaked suicide bomber today sprang the most audacious attack yet on the Pakistan army, charging into a training ground and blowing up at least 42 soldiers limbering up for their morning drill.

 The blast at the armys main training centre in Dargai in the North West Frontier Province came nine days after military helicopters raided a madarsa run by a commander wanted for harbouring al Qaida fighters, killing 80 suspected militants.

 The attack by the chadder bomber he was wrapped in a cloak is the deadliest attack so far on the army and has struck at the very pillar that props up the Pakistan state. The army is considered Pakistans most feared and powerful institution.

 The attack occurred at 0830 hours on Monday, when a man wrapped in a chadder came running into the recruits training area at Dargai near Mardan town and blew himself up, killing 35 army soldiers, a statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations said. The toll later went up to 42.

 A security official said there had been a second suicide bomber, but his explosives had not gone off. He had fled on a motorcycle and was being hunted in nearby areas. He had also been spotted before the attack with a grenade in his hand.

 Pakistan interior minister Aftab Sherpao linked the attack, the first in five years at an army installation, to the strike on the Chenagai madarsa in Bajaur, bordering Afghanistans Kunar province.

 Sherpao claimed the suicide strikers modus operandi mirrored the kind of training being given at the madarsa.

 The suicide attack in the army recruitment centre is linked with the Bajaur incident. This was the kind of training being imparted to militants in Bajaur, he told reporters.

 Speaking to Pakistans private Geo television, he said the madarsa had only been targeted after authorities received intelligence reports that miscreants there were receiving training for suicide attacks.

 Although no outfit claimed responsibility, suspicion immediately fell on Islamic militants who have publicly vowed to target the army with suicide attacks to avenge the air strike. Local residents said the soldiers had been doing morning exercises at a drill area when the attack happened.

 We heard a deafening sound of a blast in the morning. Now people say a bomb had exploded at the army training camp, said Akbar Khan, a resident. Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf, who had yesterday described terrorism as a threat to the countrys security at an army commanders conference in Rawalpindi, condemned the incident.

 Dargai is a stronghold of an outlawed Islamic group, Tehrik-e-Nifaz-e-Shariat Mohammadi (Movement for the Enforcement of Islamic Law), which has been fighting government forces.

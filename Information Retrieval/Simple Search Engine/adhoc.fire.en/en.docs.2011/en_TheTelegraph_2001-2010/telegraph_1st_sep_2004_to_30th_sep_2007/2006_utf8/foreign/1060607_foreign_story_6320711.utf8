 Meow scare for bank

 JOSHUA ROZENBERG 

 The feline case 

 London, June 6: A cat is not entitled to register a website that is confusingly similar to the name of a well-known bank, an Internet arbitrator has ruled. 

 Morgan Stanley, the US-based investment bank that now markets platinum credit cards in Britain, complained about a website called mymorganstanleyplatinum.com . 

 The domain was registered last year in the name of Meow, Baroness Penelope Cat of Nash DCB, whose address was given as a barn near Tenbury Wells, Worcs. 

 Asserting that this information was false, Morgan Stanley complained to the National Arbitration Forum in Minneapolis, which handles Internet registration disputes. 

 Ruling in the case of Morgan Stanley vs Meow at the end of last month, the arbitrator, Richard Hill, noted that the respondent claimed to be a cat, that is, a well-known carnivorous quadruped which has long been domesticated. 

 However, Hill continued: It is equally well-known that the common cat, whose scientific name is Felis domesticus, cannot speak or read or write? Therefore, either the respondent is a different species of cat, such as the one that stars in the motion picture Cat From Outer Space, or the respondents assertion regarding its being a cat is incorrect. 

 Hill clearly smelled a rat. He had been told that the cat allowed Michael Woods, described as a human, to use the domain name in his work as a business consultant. 

 If the respondent is in fact a cat from outer space, the arbitrator said, then it should have so indicated in its reply, to avoid unnecessary perplexity by the (arbitrator). Further, it should have explained why a cat from outer space would allow Mr Woods to use the disputed domain name? 

 In the absence of such an explanation, Hill said if Meow was a cat from outer space, then it may have something to hide ? and this is indicative of bad faith behaviour. 

 In its defence, the cat had pointed out that a previous arbitration panel had found that Mr Woods was not acting in bad faith when he registered and used a similar domain name, morganstanleyplatinum.com . 

 But that case was different, the arbitrator concluded. quot;In that case the respondent was Mr Woods, and not a cat or someone who has misled the panel by pretending to be a cat. quot; 

 Finding that by claiming to be a cat the respondent had acted in bad faith, the arbitrator transferred the disputed domain name to Morgan Stanley. 

 A spokesman for the investment bank said yesterday: quot;As Camille Paglia once said, Cats are autocrats of naked self-interest. quot; 

 Meow was not taking calls.

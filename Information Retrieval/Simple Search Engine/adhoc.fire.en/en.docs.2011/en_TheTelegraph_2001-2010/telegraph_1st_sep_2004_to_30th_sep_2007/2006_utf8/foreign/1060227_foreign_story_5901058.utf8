 Beijing, Feb. 26 (Reuters): Hong Kong, where bird flu made its first known jump to humans in 1997 killing six people, barred poultry imports from France today over bird flu fears.

 Authorities in eastern China today scrambled to contain an outbreak of the virus that has left two persons ill.

 The European Union had urged trading partners not to over-react to the spread of H5N1 virus to a turkey farm in France after Japan banned French poultry imports on Friday and threatened similar action against the Netherlands.

 Hong Kong is already unnerved by the threat of the disease spreading from China, which warned yesterday of the chance of a massive outbreak among birds. 

 The virus, which spreads easily among birds but is still relatively rare in humans, has killed eight in China since it re-emerged in 2003. Hong Kong has enforced a ban on backyard fowl and warned people not to touch wild birds or live poultry.

 Hong Kong is a small poultry market for France, the EUs biggest producer, whose biggest exports are to Russia and the West Asia.

 Bird flu has killed at least 92 people worldwide since 2003, spreading from East Asia to West Asia and reaching Europe this year along wild bird migration patterns.

 Bird flu has been registered in wild fowl in six regions of southern Russia and in domestic fowl in four of these regions.

 Further west, Switzerland reported its first case of H5N1 avian flu in a bird. Xinhua said a woman farmer and a girl from two neighbouring Chinese provinces remained in a critical condition.

 Authorities in Zhejiang province had traced 600 people who had been in contact with the girl and tested them for signs of the disease, but that none had been found. 

 China has reported more than 30 outbreaks of deadly H5N1 bird flu among wild and farmed birds in the past year, and culled more than 23 million fowl in 2005 to control it.

 France, which reported its first 

 H5N1 case in a wild duck just over a week ago, confirmed 

 yesterday that the deadly viral strain had been found at 

 a turkey farm ? the first such case among domestic farm 

 birds in the European Union.

 Italy asks models for health proof

 Rome, Dec. 16 (Reuters): Italys government and its fashion chiefs issued a manifesto today to crack down on the use of ultra-thin teenagers on the catwalk, requiring models to show proof of their good health or be barred from fashion shows.

 The charter also bans the use of models who are under the age of 16, saying they risk sending the wrong message to girls of the same age in the delicate pre-puberty stage.

 The manifesto, which will be officially signed next week, was drawn up as pressure grows on the fashion world to promote healthier looks.

 Spain barred models below a certain weight from Madrid fashion shows in September. Earlier this month, Brazil also launched a campaign to ban underage, underweight models from its catwalks in response to the death of a Brazilian model from complications due to anorexia.

 The government and fashion associations have sealed a strategic partnership to launch a common fight against anorexia, said sports minister Giovanna Melandri.

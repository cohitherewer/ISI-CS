 Kathmandu, Feb. 8: The Royal Municipal Polls are a failure despite what King Gyanendras courtiers may claim. Few voters turned out to cast ballots today. 

 Official figures were not available till this evening but unofficial estimates said less than 10 per cent of the voters exercised their franchise.

 The Maoists, who had called a seven-day general strike to coincide with the polls and the call of the seven-party alliance for a boycott of the hustings, are likely to call off their strike because, sources said, the point that the king was not trusted has been made by todays poor turnout.

 In interviews published yesterday, the chairman of the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist), Prachanda, said the rebels were prepared to hold talks even with the kings dispensation.

 There is little doubt that the flexibility shown by Prachanda in interviews timed to perfection has added to his stature and allowed the Maoists to shed their dogmatic sheen. Prachandas quotes were the subject of discussion in huddles around news stands across Kathmandu today.

 The polls, which were held amid heavy security, were marred by stray incidents of violence.

 A political activist belonging to the Communist Party of Nepal was killed when a soldier of the Royal Nepalese Army (RNA) opened fire on demonstrators in Gorahi of Dang district in western Nepal. Another activist of the same party suffered bullet injuries.

 According to reports, the activist, Umesh Thapa, was killed when the soldier fired to disperse a group which was trying to disrupt the polls.

 Kathmandu valley was virtually taken over by the security forces with huge deployment of personnel belonging to the armed police and RNA. Armoured carriers belonging to the RNA were deployed in all major intersections.

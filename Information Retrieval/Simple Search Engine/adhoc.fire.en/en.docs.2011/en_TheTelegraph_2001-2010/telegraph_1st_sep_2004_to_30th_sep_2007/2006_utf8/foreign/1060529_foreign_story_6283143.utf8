 Twin jolts in quick succession

 Sydney, May 28 (Reuters): Two strong earthquakes shook the South Pacific today but there were no reports of major damage or injury and seismologists said they did not signal an increase in seismic activity in the quake-prone region.

 The quakes in Tonga and Papua New Guinea hit within 10 minutes but were unrelated to a strong quake on Indonesias main island of Java yesterday, seismologists said.

 There were no immediate fears of tsunamis being generated by either of todays quakes, which were both deep below the Earths surface, seismologists said.

 Tonga, an island nation of some 169 islands and 115,000 people, was hit by a quake measuring 6.7 in magnitude at 4:36 pm local time (0336 GMT). 

 It came 10 minutes after a quake with a magnitude of 6.2 off the remote and sparsely populated New Britain island in the east of Papua New Guinea, one of the most seismically active regions.

 Statistically, its probably a little unusual to get two quakes of this size occurring within half an hour of each other but Im not getting any reports of damage, a seismologist said.

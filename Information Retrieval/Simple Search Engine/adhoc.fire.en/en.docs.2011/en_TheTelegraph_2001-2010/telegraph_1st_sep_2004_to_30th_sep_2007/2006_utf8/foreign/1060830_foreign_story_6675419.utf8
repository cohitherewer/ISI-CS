 Iran leader in Bush challenge

 Tehran, Aug 29 (Reuters): Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad today proposed holding a live television debate with President George W. Bush to discuss global affairs.

 I suggest holding a live TV debate with George W. Bush to talk about world affairs and the ways to solve those issues, Ahmadinejad said.

 Reacting to the challenge, the White House said Irans call for a presidential debate with the US on global concerns is a diversion from international concerns over its nuclear programme.

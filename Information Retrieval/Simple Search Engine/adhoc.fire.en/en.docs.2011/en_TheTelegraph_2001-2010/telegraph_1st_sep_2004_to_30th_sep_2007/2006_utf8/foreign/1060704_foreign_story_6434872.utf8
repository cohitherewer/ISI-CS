 Jordan backs Saddam kin

 Amman, July 3 (Reuters): Jordan said today that Saddams eldest daughter Raghd and her children were guests of the royal family and did not engage in any political activities.

 Iraq yesterday put Raghd on the 41 most wanted list, along with her mother Sajida and top Baathists and al Qaida leaders, and was accused of using millions stolen by the former Iraqi leader to finance Sunni insurgents.

 Prime Minister Marouf Bakheet was quoted in local papers as saying Raghd, who had been granted asylum by King Abdullah in 2003 after she fled with her sister to Jordan after the US invasion of Iraq, was living in Jordan for humanitarian reasons.

 She does not engage in any political or media activities. Raghd Saddam and her children are guests of the Hashemites, Bakheet said.

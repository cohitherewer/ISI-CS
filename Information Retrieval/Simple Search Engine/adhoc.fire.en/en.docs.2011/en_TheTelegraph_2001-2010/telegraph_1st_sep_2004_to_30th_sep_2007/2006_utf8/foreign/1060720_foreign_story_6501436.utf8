 Pangandaran (Indonesia), July 19 (Reuters): An aftershock in Indonesias tsunami-ravaged region and a new tremor off the southwestern Java coast sowed fear today as the toll from Mondays disaster climbed to 550.

 Rescuers pulled bodies from the debris and aid trickled into worst-hit Pangandaran town while a search continued for about 275 people still missing after the tsunami smashed into a 300-km stretch of coast along southern Java.

 A light aftershock that shook Pangandaran beach sent some people running, while others headed inland on motorcycles and cars as rumours circulated of a fresh tsunami.

 Hours later, tall buildings swayed as an earthquake struck the Indonesian capital Jakarta and nearby parts of Java island, prompting people in several areas to flee from high-rise offices and homes.

 There were no immediate reports of casualties or damage. The quakes strength was 6.2 at its epicentre at the Indian Ocean end of the Sunda Strait off the southwestern tip of Java, said Fauzi, an official at the national earthquake centre.

 Todays quake was felt in many areas of western Java, but the Hawaii-based Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said it posed no risk of a tsunami. The authoritative US Geological Survey put the magnitude at 6.0 on its website.

 Indonesian media questioned why there was no warning ahead of Mondays killer waves despite regional efforts to set up early alert systems after the massive Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004.

 The Jakarta Post said in an editorial the disaster agency had done nothing of note to increase peoples preparedness for disasters.

 Indonesian vice president Jusuf Kalla said the government would build an early warning system in Java and other areas in Indonesia in three years.

 Along the coastline, heavy equipment was deployed to help in the search for bodies left under the rubble when the waves rolled in after a 7.7-magnitude undersea earthquake.

 Five bodies were found on beaches in the Pangandaran area alone early today, Red Cross official Mehmet Selamat said. There are many fishermen missing. he said.

 Search and rescue official Hadi Tugiman said he expected the search effort to continue until the weekend.

 Government officials said as many as 54,000 people were displaced from wrecked fishing villages, farms and beach resorts, adding to the rehabilitation headache for authorities after an earthquake that killed more than 5,700 people in central Java less than two months earlier.

 Trucks started to arrive with aid for the thousands who lost their homes or who, fearing further tsunamis, had fled to hills above the coast. 

 More than a dozen corpses in yellow body bags lay in a makeshift morgue near the Pangandaran beach.

 Foiled plot finds echoes in 1995 Asia plan 

London, Aug. 10 (Reuters): A UK bomb plot foiled 

today echoed one planned a decade ago in Asia and lays bare the threats airlines 

still face despite heightened vigilance since the deadly hijackings of 2001, security 

analysts say.

 UK and US authorities said several airliners set to fly from London to the US were to be blown up by bombs which suspects planned to carry on board in hand luggage and ordered passengers not to carry liquids on board.

 Dr Peter Neumann, director of the Centre for Defence Studies at Londons Kings College, said the plot bore many similarities to one in 1995 by Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, convicted of planning to blow up the World Trade Center.

 He actually planned to blow up 11 planes over the Pacific with a liquid explosive, Neumann said. This is almost exactly the same type of plan we see emerging in this particular instance.

 Airlines cancelled hundreds of flights in and out of London today. 

 Carriers on both sides of the Atlantic suspended flights, waiving penalities for ticket changes and extra checked baggage. The move stranded thousands of passengers.

 British Airways and easyJet said they were cancelling some short-haul flights in and out of the capital, while planes bound from Europe into Heathrow airport were temporarily grounded. US airlines also cancelled some flights. American Airlines, a unit of AMR Corp, said it had cancelled six flights between Heathrow and the US.

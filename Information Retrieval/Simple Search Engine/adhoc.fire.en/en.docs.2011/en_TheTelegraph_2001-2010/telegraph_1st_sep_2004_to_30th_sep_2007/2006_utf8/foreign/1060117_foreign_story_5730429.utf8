 Chile: End of violent era

 Santiago, Jan. 16 (Reuters): Chile elected socialist Michelle Bachelet to be its first woman President yesterday, making her only the second woman elected to head a South American state as Latin America cements a shift to the Left.

 With almost all votes counted, Bachelet, from Chiles ruling Centre-Left coalition, won 53 per cent of ballots cast while Opposition candidate Sebastian Pinera took 47 per cent, the government Electoral Service said.

 Bachelet, 54, a medical doctor imprisoned and tortured during the 1973-1990 Augusto Pinochet dictatorship before living in exile abroad, will be the fourth consecutive President from the Centre-Left alliance that has run Chile since 1990.

 Violence came into my life, destroying what I loved, because I was a victim of hate, Bachelet told tens of thousands of confetti-tossing supporters along the main boulevard in downtown Santiago.

 I have dedicated my life to reversing that hate and converting it into understanding, tolerance and, why not say it, love.

 A former defence minister, Bachelet is only the second woman elected to head a South American nation after Janet Jagan of Guyana was chosen to succeed her husband as President in 1997 after he died.

 I feel emotional, happy. We are breathing the air of liberty and unity, said Ana Paredes, 37, a hotel employee who said she spontaneously decided to join Bachelet revellers.

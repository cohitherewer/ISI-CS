 Cliff lacks class

 Cliff Richard

 London, Aug. 13: Fans of Sir Cliff Richard may wax lyrical about his wine from The Algarve, believing that it greets the nostrils like an old and treasured friend. 

 However, the experts beg to differ. Twelve celebrity-owned labels were put to the test by Wine amp; Spirits magazine but the singers products were ranked eighth and ninth on the list. 

 His Vida Nova 2004 was judged to have a plummy nose but very green tannins and his Vida Nova Reserva 2004 showed good fruit, herbal depth, good breadth and tannins, but was slightly greener than usual, reports The Daily Telegraph. 

 The magazine said of the Vida Nova: Its quite good but overpriced. Youre paying a premium because its Cliff Richard. It lacks a bit of class. 

 fact, Chateau Botham a wine produced near Adelaide by the former cricketer Ian Botham, was judged to be far more palatable. It was full of ripe, rich fruit and smooth, creamy silkiness, the magazine said. 

 Dog ad dispute in court

 New York (AP): A woman has filed a lawsuit 

 against a pet cremation service and a photo agency, claiming 

 they used a picture of her posing with her dogs without 

 her permission.

 The photo, showing Gina Cecala holding her sweater-clad pooches, Chickie and Tiny, was taken in 1992 by an amateur photographer. It was later sold to Getty, which in turn sold it to Matthews for use in a national ad campaign.

 Cecala said she was outraged, embarrassed and traumatised after she learned the photo was used in an ad that appeared in a funeral industry newspaper.

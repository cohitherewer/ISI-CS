 Pak hints at India Bugti support

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Islamabad, Sept 4: Three days after the burial of slain Baluchistan nationalist leader Nawab Akbar Khan Bugti, Pakistan today said the tribal chieftains armed resistance was supported by a foreign force.

 We knew that Bugti did not manufacture missiles or rockets in Baluchistan and these weapons came from somewhere, state minister for information Tariq Azeem. 

 The minister made the statement while referring to the presence of at least nine Indian consulates in Afghanistan. 

 According to Pakistani officials, they had evidence showing that the Indian consulates in Afghanistan were trying to destabilise their country during talks in June last year.

 Addressing a news conference in Islamabad, Azeem said the presence of nine Indian consulates in a small country like Afghanistan cannot be justified as India does not even have big trade and economic interests in the country .

 In the US and the UK, where millions of Indians reside, Delhi does not maintain such a large number of consulates, he said, adding that there were four each Indian missions in America and in Britain. (However, Indian officials in Delhi said that India has four consulates in Afghanistan.)

 Azeem said the issue would come up for discussion when President Pervez Musharraf visits Kabul. 

 Pakistani foreign ministry spokeswoman Tasneem Aslam said today that Musharrafs visit has been on the cards for a long time. She did not disclose the dates of the visit but local media reported that it would take place later this week.

 The minister said security forces launched an attack on Bugtis hideout in the Kohlu district of Baluchistan after monitoring the illegal movement of trucks into Pakistan from Afghanistan.

 He added that two army helicopters were also shot during the search operation for the trucks two days before Bugtis death. Akbar Bugti made the situation alarming with the help of outside elements, Azeem said without naming India.

 Bugti, who had been a very active player in Pakistani politics and served as governor and chief minister of Baluchistan in 1973 and 1989, was killed while he was inside the cave with his commanders.

 Pakistani officials insist that Bugti died after the cave collapsed as a team of army officials went in most probably for talks. 

 However, Pakistani Opposition parties rejected the claim, saying that it was a target killing.

 He was not killed but died, Azeem, said joining the official chorus that the army operation was not directed towards any individual and the armed forces had no idea the rebel leader was inside the cave during the attack.

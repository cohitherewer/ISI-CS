 Undeclared war in Lanka

 Trincomalee, Aug. 2 (Reuters): Sri Lankas civil war appeared to have resumed in all but name today as Tamil Tigers attacked three army camps and pushed into government territory and the military said dozens of rebels were killed.

 A 2002 ceasefire between the two sides still exists on paper, but a battle last week over water supply for about 50,000 people in a government-controlled area has spread to the port of Trincomalee and surrounding areas with both sides exchanging artillery and mortar fire.

 The air force resumed bombing raids on Tiger positions for an eighth day, while the army transported two T-52 Russian battle tanks and convoys of supplies to the area.

 The military said more than 40 Tigers were killed today, adding that the rebels had left only a few bodies behind. The Tigers dismissed the claim as desperate, but gave no details of casualties.

 Officials said five military personnel and two civilians were killed. 

 Truce monitors say military tolls of rebel deaths are often wildly overdone, while the Tigers often deny suffering losses at all. But one diplomat said: This certainly looks like a war.

 Police said rebels had infiltrated government-held parts of Mutur town near Trincomalee, had overrun a police post and were firing at troops from buildings in the town. 

 The military said the Tigers had tried to capture a navy jetty checkpoint but had been repulsed. Residents in surrounding villages despaired.

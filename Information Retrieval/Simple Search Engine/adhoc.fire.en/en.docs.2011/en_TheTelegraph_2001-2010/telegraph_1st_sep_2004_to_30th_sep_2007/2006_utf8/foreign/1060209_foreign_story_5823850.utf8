 Double standards

 Dubai, Feb. 8 (Reuters): Muslims have decried as hypocrites western dailies which have cited free speech as the reason for printing disrespectful cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad, saying the same newspapers take pains to avoid lampooning Jews.

 What is really insulting, say some politicians and clerics, is that Europeans do not think twice about denigrating Islam but view ridicule of Judaism as anti-Semitic. What about freedom of expression when anti-Semitism is involved? Then it is not freedom of expression. Then it is a crime, said Arab League chief Amr Moussa. But when Islam is insulted, certain powers... raise the issue of freedom of expression.

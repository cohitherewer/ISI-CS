 Fine Print

 Branded babies

 St Louis (Missouri), March 11 (AP): A woman has sold the advertising rights to her pregnancy for $1,000 to an Internet company, giving exclusive rights to temporarily tattoo its brandname onto her belly and broadcast the birth of her daughter live on the Internet.

 Asia Francis, 21, of St Louis, Missouri, whose baby is due any day, auctioned off the rights on ebay ? becoming just the latest American to join the human billboard trend.

 Twenty-one year old Andrew Fischer earned more than $37,000 last year by bearing a corporate logo on his forehead for a month. Michele Hutchison auctioned ad rights for her babys clothing on ebay last year, seeking $1,000 for a months lease. 

 Super snap

 Wellington, New Zealand (AFP): Lovelorn 

 American men looking for a partner online are using photos 

 of one of New Zealands most popular sports personalities, 

 rugby star Richie McCaw, to lure women. Photos of the 25-year-old 

 McCaw, an imposing figure at 1.88 metres tall and weighing 

 105 kg, have been found on two dating websites in the US. 

 In one of the profiles, Elden says he is a dateless 

 Las Vegas casino worker who likes relaxing, while in another 

 Eddie describes himself as a Boston law enforcer 

 who likes animals and movies. In reality McCaw is the next 

 captain of the All Blacks rugby team, has a private pilots 

 licence and likes flying in his spare time. 

 Hot helmet

 Amsterdam (Reuters): Sales of orange replica Nazi helmets aimed at Dutch soccer fans attending the soccer World Cup have trebled since they were banned from Dutch stadiums this month, the helmets producer said on Friday. Footballs governing body in the Netherlands, the KNVB, banned the helmets ahead of a Dutch friendly against Ecuador in Amsterdam earlier this month, saying they were offensive. We are now selling three times the previous average daily volume, said the helmets producer Florian van Laar.

 Mob soap

 Los Angeles (Reuters): The end is finally 

 near for Americas favourite mob family, and Las Vegas 

 is cheerfully setting odds on who gets to sleep with the 

 fishes. After a 22-month absence, the hit gangster drama 

 The Sopranos returns on Sunday to cable TV network 

 HBO for the first of what its creator swears will be the 

 last 20 episodes. The show is supposed to end in 2007 with 

 Tony Soprano and family finally out of business after six 

 seasons.

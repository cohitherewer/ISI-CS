The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Blair to stay on for one year

 London, Aug. 6: Tony Blair has fired the opening shots in a new war with Gordon Brown by indicating that he wants to stay in power for at least another year, The Sunday Telegraph has learnt. 

 Close colleagues of the Prime Minister say that he returned from his five-day trip to the US feeling rejuvenated and believing that he still has a major role to play both domestically and internationally. 

 He has ordered his aides to prepare a packed programme for September, between his return from his Caribbean holiday and the start of the Labour Party conference in Manchester. 

 Authoritative sources said that Blair is also ready for a fresh fight with his Labour critics, both inside and outside his cabinet, by seeking to push through a fresh round of modernising reforms in health and education. 

 His renewed sense of purpose will be extremely unwelcome news for Brown, who is spending most of August on paternity leave. 

 The chancellor and his close aides, together with a large number of Labour MPs, want a stable and orderly transition of power shortly after the 10th anniversary of Blairs accession to power next May.

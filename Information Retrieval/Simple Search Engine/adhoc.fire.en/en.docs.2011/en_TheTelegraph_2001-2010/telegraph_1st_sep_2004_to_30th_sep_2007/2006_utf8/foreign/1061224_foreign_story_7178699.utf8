 Japan fights for sushi

 COLIN JOYCE

 Tokyo, Dec. 23: Japan is planning a campaign to end the corruption of sushi, as the nations most celebrated and traditional food gets an increasingly raw deal in foreign restaurants.

 After a rise in the popularity of Japanese food across the world, the agriculture ministry hopes to deter foreigners from serving poor quality sometimes bizarre dishes that it believes damage the image of Japanese cuisine.

 In Moscow, which has an abundance of sushi restaurants, one can find such eccentric creations as jellied meat sushi and pickled mushroom sushi, alongside the more traditional raw fish. Miso shiru, a soyabean-based soup flavoured with fish stock and served with a few pieces of tofu, can be found with chunks of carrots and potatoes and even served as a miso cappuccino.

 The Philadelphia roll which includes cream cheese and smoked salmon has frayed already raw nerves in Japan, and the crab stick and mayonnaise-laced California roll, which was invented in Los Angeles but has even been reverse imported into Japan, draws similar horror among Japanese aficionados. Now, with Tokyo predicting the number of Japanese restaurants outside Japan will double to more than 50,000 in the next three years, the ministry plans to give official certification only to restaurants that meet its standards.

 In Paris, just 50 of some 600 Japanese restaurants, 90 per cent of which are Chinese-owned, will be listed in a 2007 guidebook produced by the local office of the Japan External Trade Organisation.

 The scheme is expected to be extended to other countries, including Britain.

 Our goal is to offer real Japanese cuisine. We dont want restaurants that look Japanese but whose content is anything but, a Japanese minister said.

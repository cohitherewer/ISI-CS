 Book says Ali champion of rap music

 Mighty Mouth

 New York, Dec. 16 (AP): Float like a butterfly/ Sting like a bee/ Your hands cant hit/ What your eyes cant see.

 Muhammad Alis rhymes, taunts, provocations and exclamations were an endlessly entertaining and insightful facet of his larger-than-life persona. As he once said, I outwit them and then I outhit them.

 A new book, Ali Rap: Muhammad Ali the First Heavyweight Champion of Rap, proclaims Alis verbal barrage was more than self-promotion, but that it sowed the seeds of hip-hop, which was born in the early Seventies. 

 Before there was rap ... there was Ali Rap ... a topsy-turvy, jivey jargon that only Ali could create, but a language we could all understand, writes the books editor and designer, George Lois.

 The book is not a continued analysis of this claim, but nearly 300 pages of examples, illustrated by a quote roughly every page that issued from Alis world-class mouth. 

 Lois, a renowned ad man and graphic designer, recently said that he wanted to condense Alis many sayings and memorable utterances into a small, fat book like a Bible or a Quran.

 Lois remembers riding in a car with Ali years ago when a rap song came on the radio. Lois suggested Ali was a rapper himself, to which the boxer responded: Im a double rapper. First I rap them with my mouth, then I rap them in the mouth. Presented chronologically, Ali Rap takes the reader from Alis Kentucky childhood, through his historic fights against Sonny Liston, Joe Lewis and George Foreman and finally to his current struggles with Parkinsons disease.

 Even as a 40-kg 12-year-old, Ali who as a teenager was known by some as The Louisville Lip or Mighty Mouth had found his flow: This guy is done. Ill stop him in one.

 Alis life story is all told through Alis own words, in hysterical soundbites and intimate reflections. Lois, who counts himself a friend of Alis, famously designed a 1964 Esquire magazine cover showing Ali punctured with arrows an allusion to the criticism he received for refusing to fight in the Vietnam War.

 The books bold, catchy boast that Ali invented rap is certainly debatable. Surely, hip-hop has more to gain by the association than Ali, who has always transcended all categorisation.

 Writing for ESPN which published the book with Taschen pop culture critic Chuck Klosterman pondered, If true, this would mean that rap did not originate (as commonly believed) in the South Bronx during the 70s; it would mean that rap was invented in Kentucky during the 60s.

 This is hard to accept because there are very few memorable rap songs about competitive horse racing and/or Rex Chapman.

 But there are more than a few rappers in Alis corner, including Public Enemys Chuck D, a well-respected elder statesman of hip-hop. Chuck D (born Carlton Douglas Ridenhour) recently hosted an ESPN special on Alis love of language, which also included hip-hop artists Rakim, Ludacris, Doug E. Fresh, Fab 5 Freddy, Jermaine Dupri and MC Lyte. 

 He was able to engage his social surroundings into his whole persona. Thats what hip-hop was able to do to be an antenna for social reflection, Chuck D said. Hes one of the few black people to get on TV and speak their minds.

 US eases luggage rules

 Washington, Aug. 14 (AP): Air travellers in the US yesterday were given permission to carry small amounts of liquid non-prescription medicine onto a plane and instructed to remove their shoes during security checks.

 The shoes have to be placed on an X-ray belt for screening before passengers can put them back on.

 The eased restrictions on medicine and the mandatory shoe removal were among several measures the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) ordered yesterday in response to the thwarted terror plot in Britain involving US-bound airplanes. TSA had previously banned all liquid medications; now it will allow up to 113 grams of liquid non-prescription medicine. 

 In other measures, TSA said it would let flyers carry low blood sugar treatments including glucose gel for diabetics; solid lipstick; and baby food.

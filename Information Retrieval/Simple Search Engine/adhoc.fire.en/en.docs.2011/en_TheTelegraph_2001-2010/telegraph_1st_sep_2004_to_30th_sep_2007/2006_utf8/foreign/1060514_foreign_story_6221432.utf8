 TV bids adieu to West Wing

 US actor Martin Sheen as the US President in West Wing

 Los Angeles, May 13 (Reuters): American television bids goodbye tomorrow to The West Wing, a landmark drama offering viewers a Utopian narrative ? some might call it fantasy ? of a President and White House staff who always put country above politics.

 The Emmy-winning series starring Martin Sheen as the man in the Oval Office heads off the airwaves after seven years on the NBC network (one year shy of two presidential terms) just as newly elected successor Jimmy Smits is about to assume office.

 The nations real-life political landscape has changed dramatically since the show debuted in 1999, during the post-Monica Lewinsky twilight of the Clinton administration.

 But The West Wing has stayed its course through the turbulent years that followed, often reflecting actual events and politics, although usually with greater eloquence, clarity and decisiveness than viewers could find on the evening news.

 It was a kind of Utopian notion of the kind of President that we wished we had but that the political process would never be able to deliver, said Robert Thompson, head of Syracuse Universitys Center for the Study of Popular Television.

 Moreover, the shows idealism resonated with a US electorate disillusioned by real politics, said University of Maryland Prof. Trevor Parry-Giles, author of The Prime Time Presidency: The West Wing and US Nationalism.

 It played right into this seeping cynicism and gave audiences this countervision, he said. 

 The show didnt really rip stories from the headlines but played off cultural anxieties and angst.

 Critics hailed the series, especially during its first four seasons under the guidance of creator Aaron Sorkin.

 West Wing won the Emmy Award as best TV drama four years in a row and holds the record for most Emmys trophies in a single season ? nine for its first year. Although it lost considerable ratings steam, the show was widely regarded as having enjoyed a creative renaissance in its final season.

 As a portrait of the political and personal struggles inside a Democratic administration, the show was embraced by many liberal viewers as prime-time wish fulfillment while derided by some conservatives as Hollywood Leftist propaganda.

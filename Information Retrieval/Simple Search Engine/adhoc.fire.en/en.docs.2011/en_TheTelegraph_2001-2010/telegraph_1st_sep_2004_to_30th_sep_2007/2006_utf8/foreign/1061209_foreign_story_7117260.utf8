 Eddie dad of baby: Melanie

 Murphy, Melanie

 New York, Dec. 8 (AP): Eddie Murphy has said he is not sure if he is the father of former Spice Girl Melanie Browns unborn child. Brown, however, says she is quite certain he is.

 I am obviously upset and distressed at some of the comments made by Eddie Murphy to the media, Brown, 31, said in a statement released yesterday by her publicist, Nadine Bibi.

 I have no idea why anyone would want to conduct themselves in this kind of manner about such a personal matter in such a public way. My main concern is for the well-being of my daughter, Phoenix, and of course the baby. I was astonished what Eddie said. There is absolutely no question that Eddie is the father.

 Bibi said Brown known as Scary Spice when she was in the British megahit group of the 1990s was not giving interviews at this stage.

 Murphy, 45, who stars in the upcoming Dreamgirls film, was recently asked by a TV interviewer if he was excited that Brown is pregnant.

 Now youre being presumptuous because were not together anymore, Murphy replied. And I dont know whose child that is until it comes out and has a blood test. You shouldnt jump to conclusions, sir. 

 A clip of the interview was posted on the entertainment website www.TMZ.com.

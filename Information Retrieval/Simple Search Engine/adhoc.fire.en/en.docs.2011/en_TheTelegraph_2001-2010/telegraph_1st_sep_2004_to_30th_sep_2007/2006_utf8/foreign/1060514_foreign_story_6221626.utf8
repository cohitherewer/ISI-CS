 Putin to name successor soon

 Putin: Veiled attack

 Moscow, May 13 (Reuters): Russias Vladimir Putin said today he would name a preferred successor to follow him as President and vowed to ensure a smooth handover of power when he steps down in 2008.

 He also obliquely hit back at criticism by the US leadership that he was backsliding on democracy, saying Russia would build up its ties with the West patiently and calmly and there would be no return to the Cold War.

 Putin, who was himself made acting head of state by then-President Boris Yeltsin to ensure his election, has long rejected talk he will change the constitution and stand for a third successive term.

 The identity of his successor has become the countrys hottest political topic, with defence minister Sergei Ivanov and first deputy prime minister Dmitry Medvedev at present seen as strong possibilities to follow him.

 Most political commentators believe he himself will stay on after 2008 in some influential political role.

 The 53-year-old former KGB intelligence agent gave no clues as to whom he would support. But, laying out Kremlin strategy, he made clear Russia would not stray far from his system of managed democracy at home and self-confidence abroad.

 I think I would be right to express my point of view on one candidacy or another, and I will do this, Putin said in the Black Sea town of Sochi, when asked about his successor.

 Everyone is concerned about stability and are wondering what will happen after 2008... I have certain ideas about how to set up the situation in the country in this period of time so as not to destabilise it, so as not to scare people and business.

 Since Putins election in 2000, he has stamped his mark on the country, and overturned much of Yeltsins work. Observers say that, while reducing crime and securing state finances, he has undermined Russias nascent democracy. 

 His control over almost all aspects of Russian life has drawn Western criticism.

 Jaffna (Sri Lanka), May 3 (Reuters): People stayed off the streets in Sri Lankas north today after gunmen killed two in an attack on a Tamil newspaper, prompting calls by journalists for greater protection.

 Unidentified attackers stormed the office of Tamil daily Uthayan, or Dawn, in the northern town of Jaffna late yesterday, witnesses said, searching for a senior journalist, smashing computers and equipment and killing two staff.

 More than 130 people have died in the last month in the bloodiest period by far since a 2002 ceasefire, sparking fear that the islands two-decade civil war might be about to restart. Its really shocking, said autorickshaw driver Raveendran Kumar, referring to the attack on the Tamil daily. I dont know who is behind this but, whoever it is, I beg of them to stop.

 The Sri Lankan government condemned the attack on the newspaper, which is widely seen to have good contacts with Tamil Tiger rebels. Police in Jaffna said they had arrested six young men in connection with the incident, but didnt give any more details.

 The army earlier said it tried to stop the attackers fleeing, seized an AK-47 assault rifle and arrested two people. But some suspected the hand of military or army-linked groups.

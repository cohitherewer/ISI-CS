 For money, Cherie game

 Cherie: Cash calls

 London, March 12: Cherie Blair is to be paid ?30,000 to speak about life in Downing Street ? by a wealthy American widow at the centre of a row with the Jewish community. 

 Before making the speech in Florida on Tuesday, the British Prime Ministers wife will also be a lunch guest at Everglades, a private members club which has in the past been criticised for excluding Jews and black Americans. Her son Nicky, 20, will accompany her. 

 Blairs speech and the lunch will be funded by Maureen Donnell, 74, who provoked controversy in 2004 by arguing successfully that Palm Beach was discriminating against Christians by erecting a menorah, a lamp lit during the Jewish festival of Chanukah. The case divided the city, which has a large Jewish population. 

 Blairs lecture, the John R. Donnell Memorial Speech, which she will give at the Society of the Four Arts in Palm Beach, will come on a speaking tour of America during which she is expected to earn about ?150,000. 

 It comes after revelations yesterday that the Blairs have mortgage debts of almost ?4 million ? higher then previously thought ? with monthly payments of at least ?16,000 on properties in London, Bristol and Durham. 

 Blair has told friends she needs the money from her lectures to fund huge outgoings, particularly the ?3,467,000 mortgage on the central London townhouse bought in 2004. 

 She has been embroiled in controversy over offending Jewish people in the past. In 2002, she appeared to express sympathy for Palestinian suicide bombers within hours of an explosion in Jerusalem that killed at least 19 people. 

 She was forced to apologise after saying during a visit to a Palestinian medical charity in north London: quot;As long as young people feel they have got no hope but to blow themselves up you are never going to make progress. quot; 

 In her speech this week, described in publicity material as quot;An Afternoon with Cherie Booth quot;, Mrs Blair will discuss The Goldfish Bowl, the book about life in No 10 that she co-wrote with Lord Braggs wife, Cate Haste. The Sunday Telegraph understands that Mrs Blair is being paid ?30,000, or ?750 per minute, for the 40-minute speech. Her talk will be followed by 20 minutes of questions from the audience. The society is also believed to be meeting the costs of her travel and accommodation.. 

 Mrs Donnell said: quot;I just felt it was intriguing to have the wife of the Prime Minister, and England has been a good ally of the US. quot; 

 The 1,100-member Everglades club was mired in controversy for decades because of its admissions policies, but has remained free of scandal since the late 1990s. 

 The tycoon Donald Trump once said of membership: quot;If youre Jewish and marry a gentile member, forget it. You can only be a guest. quot; 

 In 1972, the club suspended one of its members, the socialite and equestrian C Z Guest, for six months after she invited Estee Lauder, the Jewish perfumier, and her husband, Joe, to her 25th wedding anniversary party there. 

 James Kimberly, the Kleenex heir, has told how he and Sammy Davis Jr, who was both black and Jewish, strode up to the club, where a doorman wrapped an arm around them and turned them back towards the car park. 

 Last night No 10 said: quot;Cherie is not the guest of any one person but of the society, which frequently features prominent Jewish speakers. quot; The spokesman declined to comment on the lunch.

 Yusuf Islam plans album

 Islam: Mirror to West

 London, May 17 (Reuters): Yusuf Islam, the pop star formerly known as Cat Stevens who left the wild world of the music business in the 1970s, is returning with a new album that he hopes will bridge the divide between Islam and the west.

 The singer converted to Islam and dropped the Cat Stevens name in 1977, leaving the music industry where he had hits including Moonshadow and Peace Train. More recently, he made headlines in 2004 when he was denied entry to the US and his flight was diverted after his name turned up on a watch list. 

 There were one hundred reasons for leaving the music industry back in 1979, not least because I had found what I was looking for spiritually. Today there are perhaps one hundred and one good reasons why I feel right making music and singing about life in this fragile world again, Islam said.

 The as-yet untitled album, due for release this autumn on Universal Musics Polydor label, was produced by Rick Nowels. Much has changed, but today I am in a unique position as a looking glass through which Muslims can see the West and the West can see Islam, Islam added.

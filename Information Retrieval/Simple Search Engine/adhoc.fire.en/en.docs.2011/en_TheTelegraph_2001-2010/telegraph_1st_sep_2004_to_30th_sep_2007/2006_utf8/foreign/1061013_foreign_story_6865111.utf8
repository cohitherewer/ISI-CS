 Seoul, Oct. 12 (Reuters): North Korea threatened Japan on Thursday with strong countermeasures if it goes ahead with tougher sanctions over Pyongyangs reported nuclear test.

 Japan and the US are pushing for tough measures against the North, although diplomats say China opposes the more punitive parts of a draft resolution Washington wants the UN Security Council to adopt in a vote, possibly on Friday.

 We will take strong countermeasures, said Song Il-ho, North Korean ambassador in charge of diplomatic normalisation talks with Japan, according to a report by Japans Kyodo news agency from Pyongyang.

 The specific contents will become clear if you keep watching, Song said. We never speak empty words.

 Japan, arguing that Pyongyangs nuclear weapons poses a direct threat to its safety, is expected to formally approve additional sanctions on Friday, including banning imports from the impoverished communist state and blocking North Korean ships from entering Japanese ports.

 US President George W. Bush, speaking after Japan announced plans for extra sanctions, said on Wednesday: In response to North Koreas actions were working with our partners ... to ensure there are serious repercussions for the regime in Pyongyang.

 Giant ice shelf breaks free from Arctic island

 Toronto, Dec. 29 (AP): A giant ice shelf has snapped free from an island south of the North Pole, scientists said yesterday, citing climate change as a major reason for the event.

 The Ayles Ice Shelf 66 square km of it broke clear 16 months ago from the coast of Ellesmere Island, about 800 km south of the North Pole in the Canadian Arctic.

 Scientists discovered the event by using satellite imagery. Within one hour of breaking free, the shelf had formed as a new ice island, leaving a trail of icy boulders floating in its wake. 

 Warwick Vincent of Laval University, who studies Arctic conditions, travelled to the newly-formed ice island and was amazed at the sight.

 This is a dramatic and disturbing event. It shows that we are losing remarkable features of the Canadian North that have been in place for many thousands of years, Vincent said. 

 We are crossing climate thresholds, and these may signal the onset of accelerated change ahead. 

 The ice shelf was one of six major shelves remaining in Canadas Arctic. They are packed with ancient ice that is more than 3,000 years old. They float on the sea but are connected to land. 

 Some scientists say it is the largest event of its kind in Canada in 30 years and that climate change was a major element.

 It is consistent with climate change, Vincent said, adding that the remaining ice shelves are 90 per cent smaller than when they were first discovered in 1906. 

 Laurie Weir, who monitors ice conditions for the Canadian Ice Service, was poring over satellite images in 2005 when she noticed that the shelf had split. Weir notified Luke Copland, head of the new global ice lab at the University of Ottawa, who initiated an effort to find out what happened.

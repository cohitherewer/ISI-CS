 Doctors guarded on Sharon state

 Jerusalem, Jan. 7 (Reuters): A scan of Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharons brain showed slight improvement today but doctors were not ready to declare the threat to his life over, three days after he suffered a massive stroke.

 Shlomo Mor-Yosef, director of Jerusalems Hadassah hospital, said the 77-year-old leader remained in critical but stable condition after emergency surgery staunched bleeding in his brain yesterday.

 We as human beings are optimistic, he said as Israelis kept a nationwide vigil for Sharon. But I cannot say that the Prime Minister has come out of danger ... there are very slight signs of improvement.

 He said a decision on when to try to awaken Sharon, who was in an induced coma, would be taken tomorrow morning and only then would doctors be able to assess how much damage he suffered from the stroke on Wednesday.

 Results of the latest scan stirred cautious optimism in the Israeli media, but outside experts have said the prognosis for the Sharon remains bleak given the haemorrhaging that led to his five-hour operation yesterday.

 The medical consensus is that if Sharon survives it is extremely unlikely he will ever return to political life.

 The death or incapacitation of Sharon, who raised peace hopes by pulling Israeli settlers and troops out of Gaza in September to end 38 years of military rule, would create a huge vacuum in Israeli politics and West Asia peace process. An initial post-surgical brain scan yesterday had shown that the operation succeeded in staunching the bleeding and relieving intense cranial pressure.

 Sharon underwent a new computerised scan today that doctors said largely matched the earlier findings. 

 An official determination on Sharons condition was expected only after doctors wean him off drugs that have kept him sedated and on a respirator. In a sign of the obstacles Sharon faces, an X-ray detected an abnormality in the area of Sharons lungs, Israeli television reported. It said doctors did not know the cause but that stroke victims often develop lung infections or pneumonia.

 From Jerusalem synagogues where the Jewish Sabbath was being observed to Tel Aviv beach cafes where youths carried surfboards under their arms, Israelis anxiously awaited word on the ex-generals fate.

 Were all praying for him. He is a giant of our nation, said Jonathan Eilat, 47, wearing a prayer shawl at Jerusalems Western Wall, the holiest site of Jewish worship.

 Sharons two sons maintained a vigil at his bedside. A four-year-old Israeli boy arrived at the hospital with his family carrying a hand-drawn get-well card for the Prime Minister. World leaders pledged support for Sharons deputy, Ehud Olmert, named acting Prime Minister.

 Sharons operation yesterday was his third since being rushed to the hospital on Wednesday. 

 Throughout the Jewish state, radios were tuned to news broadcasts for any scrap of new information on Sharon. Stations played the national anthem and melancholy ballads and psychologists were interviewed about the publics mood.

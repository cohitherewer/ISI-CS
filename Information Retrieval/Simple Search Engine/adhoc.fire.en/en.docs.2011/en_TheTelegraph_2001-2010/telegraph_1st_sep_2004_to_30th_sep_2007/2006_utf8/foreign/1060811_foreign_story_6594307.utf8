 Robin Williams to be treated for abuse

 Los Angeles, Aug. 9 (Reuters): Comedian and Oscar-winning actor Robin Williams has entered treatment for alcohol abuse after being sober for 20 years, his publicist said yesterday.

 Williams, 55, found himself drinking again after two decades of sobriety and has decided to take proactive measures to deal with this for his own well-being and the well-being of his family, spokeswoman Mara Buxbaum said in a statement.

 Besides The Night Listener, which opened last week and stars Williams as a radio host who becomes involved with a young listener who claims to be a child-abuse victim, the actor has three more movies set to hit theatres this year.

 He plays another talk show host who runs for President in the Man of the Year, due out in October, supplies the voice of a penguin in the polar cartoon Happy Feet, set for November and co-stars with Ben Stiller and Owen Williams in the comedy Night at the Museum.

 Williams became a household name as the star of the 1970s sitcom Mork amp; Mindy.

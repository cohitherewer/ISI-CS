 Veiled woman cries off Xmas message

 Khadija Ravat

 London, Dec. 17: A Muslim woman who was due to deliver Channel 4s alternative Christmas message wearing a full veil has backed out after criticism from inside and outside her community.

 Earlier this month, Khadija Ravat agreed to front the six-minute slot that is broadcast as the queen delivers her own thoughts on Christmas Day. She said she wanted to argue that women should have the right to cover their faces if they choose. 

 On Friday, however, after talks with the producers, the part-time primary school teacher from Leicester told Channel 4 that she could not go through with the project.

 In a statement, she said that it was the unexpected publicity around her decision that made her change her mind. But a source close to the programme makers said one of the reasons was that she had been pressurised by senior members of the community who felt it was not her place to talk about Islam. It has also been said that she had received threatening letters from non-Muslims accusing her of trying to upstage the queen.

 My initial thoughts about the programme were that it would be a fantastic opportunity to do something positive and to convey a warm message for everyone to share.

 However, after careful consideration, I have decided not to appear on the programme. 

 Ibrahim Hewitt, head of the al Aqsa Primary School, which is near Ravats Leicester home, said: There has been a mixed reaction. I have known her for a long time, and she is a very sincere person. Nobody at the school has raised any objections indeed, parents have come to me and said they were very happy she was going to do it.

 But some people think she is trying to upstage the queen, which is certainly not the case. But I think she feels it would rub people up the wrong way.

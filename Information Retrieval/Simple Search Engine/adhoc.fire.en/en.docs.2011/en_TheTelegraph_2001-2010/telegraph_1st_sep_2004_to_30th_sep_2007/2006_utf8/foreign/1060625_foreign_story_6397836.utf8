 Sydney, June 24 (Reuters): Oscar-winning actress Nicole Kidman said today she planned to get a good nights sleep before tomorrows wedding to country singer Keith Urban in Sydney, while Urban is reportedly having a party.

 As preparations for the wedding were finalised, Sydney media speculated that Moulin Rouge director Baz Luhrmann, a long-time friend of Kidmans, would shoot the wedding video.

 Kidman and Urban are to be married tomorrow but details of the wedding have been kept under wraps all week as guests such as King Kong star Naomi Watts and Luhrmann jetted into Sydney. Speaking briefly today, Kidman said she and her husband-to-be were very happy. Asked what she would be doing tonight, Kidman replied: Im going to get some sleep.

 Urban is reportedly having a party at an exclusive Sydney nightclub with musicians who have flown in from Nashville.

 Luhrmann, who will attend the wedding with his film producer wife Catherine Martin, met Kidman and Urban last night, sparking media speculation he would be involved in creative direction, which would include the wedding video.

 I am very happy to be going along to a happy occasion, was all a smiling Luhrmann would say to reporters after meeting the couple and the wedding party at Kidmans family home in Sydney. Kidman told reporters that Luhrmann was part of the family.

 Luhrmann chose the statuesque Australian actress to star in Moulin Rouge, and directed her in a Chanel No 5 perfume advertisement.

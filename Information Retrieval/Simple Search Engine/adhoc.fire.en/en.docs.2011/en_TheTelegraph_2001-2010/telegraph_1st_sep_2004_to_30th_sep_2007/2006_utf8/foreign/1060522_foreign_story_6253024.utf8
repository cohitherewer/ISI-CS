The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Hike ticks on foreign students 

 Sydney, May 21 (PTI): International students in Australia will lose heavy discounts on train and bus fares if a new legislation is passed that seeks to overturn a ruling granting cuts in travel expenses to up to 80,000 such students.

 Transport minister John Watkins said yesterday that his government would legislate to overturn the administrative decisions tribunal ruling since it disadvantaged local pensioners, schoolchildren, isolated families and the disabled, the Daily Telegraph reported.

 Full fee-paying students have been campaigning vigorously for free or discounted transport even though they sign a declaration that they are fully self-sufficient before entering the country.

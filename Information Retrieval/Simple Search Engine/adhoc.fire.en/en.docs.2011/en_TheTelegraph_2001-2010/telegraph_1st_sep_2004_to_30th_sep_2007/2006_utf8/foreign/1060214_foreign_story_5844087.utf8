 Kathmandu, Feb. 13: The Maoist-controlled All Nepal Trade Union Federation (ANTUF) paraded three Nepali employees of the Indo-Nepal joint venture Surya Nepal before a team of human rights activists and journalists last evening at Chhatiwan village in Makwanpur town, southeastern Nepal.

 The parade of the ITC-owned company employees came 10 days after they were abducted from the Birgunj area. Soon after the abduction, ANTUF president Shalik Ram Jamarkattel issued a statement listing 10 demands of the union. He also said the abducted employees will be released if the concerned side shows seriousness to implement the demands of the trade union.

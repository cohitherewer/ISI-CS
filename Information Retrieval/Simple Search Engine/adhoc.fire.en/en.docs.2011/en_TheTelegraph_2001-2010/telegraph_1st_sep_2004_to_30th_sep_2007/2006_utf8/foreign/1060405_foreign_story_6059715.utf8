 France protests

 Paris, April 4 (Reuters): Hundreds of thousands of students marched through French cities today in new protests aimed at killing off a youth hire-and-fire law as rail workers and teachers staged one-day sympathy strikes.

 Frances ruling conservatives stopped short of agreeing to scrap the law but, faced with sliding poll ratings and internal rifts over how to deal with two months of sometimes violent protests, signalled possible concessions to trade unions.

 Early counts around the country suggested turnout could reach that of a week ago, when anything between one and three million took part in one of the biggest days of protest seen in Frances 48-year-old Fifth Republic.

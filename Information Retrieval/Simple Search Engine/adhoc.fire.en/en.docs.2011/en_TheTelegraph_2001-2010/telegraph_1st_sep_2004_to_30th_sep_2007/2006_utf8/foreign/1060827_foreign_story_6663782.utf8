 Pak plans to bend rules for judge son

 New Delhi, Aug. 26: The Shaukat Aziz government is considering bending the rules to allow the alleged son of a supreme court chief justice to join the lucrative Pakistan police service.

 According to the English-language daily The News, Punjab health department official, Arsalan Iftikhar Chaudhry, is apparently the son of supreme court chief justice Iftikhar Ahmad Chaudhry. Arsalan, who is a doctor, has failed the prestigious Central Superior Services (CSS) examination on three occasions.

 Critics say that the central government might bend the rules to accommodate Arsalan and avoid further rulings by the apex court in this context.

 Keeping this in view, critics are question the judicial activism being displayed by the apex court.

 Arsalan was last year appointed to the Federal Investigation Agency on deputation. He was later sent to the National Police Academy for specialised police training that was meant for recruiting assistant superintendents of police, the paper said.

 The Prime Ministers secretariat is now considering amending the PSP (Composition, Cadre and Seniority) Rules after it was clear that under the present situation there was no legal provision to allow Arsalans direct induction into the service. 

 The government is contemplating to add a provision to these rules whereby any government servant, including a provincial government employee, can be inducted into the PSP, the newspaper quoted sources as saying., 

 They added that if approved, it would open a new arena for backdoor induction of junior VVIPs in the PSP.

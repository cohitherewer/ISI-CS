The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Paper offers $1m over scribe death

 Moscow, Oct. 9 (Reuters): The newspaper where slain Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya worked has offered almost $1 million for information leading to her killers amid widespread international condemnation of the murder.

 A gunman shot Politkovskaya, one of President Putins strongest critics, four times as she brought her shopping home to her Moscow apartment on Saturday evening. The 48-year-old mother of two died on the spot.

 Russian investigators and commentators believe the killing was motivated by Politkovskayas fiercely critical reporting, which won her many international awards.

 Politkovskayas newspaper, Novaya Gazeta, published a front page bordered in black on Monday with a large picture of the murdered reporter. She was beautiful, its story began.

 Novaya Gazetas publishers, who include former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, offered a reward of 25 million roubles ($933,500) to anyone who could help find those who ordered the killing, organised it and carried it out.

 Revenge fears over Briton

 Islamabad, May 24 (Reuters): Pakistani prison authorities tightened security today to protect a British man on death row, as his family feared he was in danger of a revenge killing after President Pervez Musharraf ordered a stay of execution.

 We asked the authorities to limit access because we fear the family (of the dead man) might try to assassinate Tahir in the prison, the prisoners brother Mirza Amjad Hussain said.

 His (Mirza Tahir Hussain) family has asked us not to let anyone meet Tahir except the close family relatives, a senior police official said. Hussain has spent half his life behind bars.

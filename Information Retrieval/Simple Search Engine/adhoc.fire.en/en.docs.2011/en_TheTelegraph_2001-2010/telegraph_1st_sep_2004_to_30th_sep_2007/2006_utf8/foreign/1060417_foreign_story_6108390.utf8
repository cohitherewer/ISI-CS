 Vatican City, April 16 (Reuters): Pope Benedict, in his first Easter message today, called for an honourable solution to the nuclear standoff with Iran, a truly independent Palestinian state, and global cooperation to combat terrorism.

 The German Pope, speaking on his 79th birthday, made his appeal for world peace in his Easter Urbi et Orbi (to the city and the world) message to some 100,000 people as he concluded the first Easter season of his pontificate.

 The Pope, who marks the first anniversary of his election on Wednesday, led a joyful Easter mass in a sunny St Peters Square on the most important day of the Christian liturgical calendar, when the faithful celebrate Christs resurrection from the dead.

 In the speech, televised to millions in more than 65 countries at the end of Easter Sunday mass in the square, the head of the Roman Catholic Church listed his worries about a world he said was living through uncertainty and anxiety and oppressed by widespread suffering.

 Concerning the international crises linked to nuclear power, may an honourable solution be found for all parties, through serious and honest negotiations... he said in a clear reference to Iran. The US wants targeted sanctions on Iran that include a freeze on assets and visa restrictions.

 The Pope read the speech, and delivered brief Easter greetings in 62 languages, including Hebrew and Arabic, from the central balcony of St Peters Basilica.

 The crowd in the square, which was decked out with tens of thousands of flowers donated by the Netherlands, interrupted his address with applause several times when he called for peace.

 In another part of the speech, the Pope defended Israels right to exist, in what appeared to be an indirect criticism of statements by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad that the Jewish state should be eliminated. But he also called firmly for the establishment of a Palestinian state. May the international community, which re-affirms Israels just right to exist in peace, assist the Palestinian people to... build their future. 

 Mentioning Iraq, he prayed may peace finally prevail over the tragic violence that continues mercilessly to claim victims.

 Push for talks

 The US should hold direct talks with Iran on its nuclear programme and go slow on pressing for sanctions, contrary to Bush administration strategy, the Senate foreign relations committee chairman said today.

 Richard Lugar said it was too soon to press hard for sanctions aimed at halting Irans suspected nuclear policy.

 even as the Bush administration prepares to do so at a meeting in Moscow Tuesday.

 The Pope also prayed that the spirit of the risen Christ bring relief and security to Africa, particularly the people of Darfur in western Sudan, who he said were living in a dramatic humanitarian situation that is no longer sustainable.

 Chad broke diplomatic ties with neighbouring Sudan on Friday and warned that it might stop sheltering thousands of Sudanese refugees who have crossed the border to escape an ethnic conflict in the Darfur region.

 This is the first Easter for the 1.1 billion member Roman Catholic Church since the death of Pope John Paul, who was in his final days a year ago and was only able to make brief appearances in the week between Palm Sunday and Easter Sunday.

 John Paul died on April 2, a week after Easter.

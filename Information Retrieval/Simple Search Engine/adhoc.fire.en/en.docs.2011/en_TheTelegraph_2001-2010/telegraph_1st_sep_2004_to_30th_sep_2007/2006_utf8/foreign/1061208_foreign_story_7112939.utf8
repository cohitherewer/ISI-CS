 Flatulence forces plane to divert

 CATHERINE ELSWORTH

 New York, Dec. 7: A passenger jet was forced to make an emergency landing after a woman lit matches to hide her flatulence and concerned passengers reported the smell of burning.

 The American Airlines jet, flying from Washington to Dallas, was diverted to Nashville where all 99 passengers and five crew left the plane while it was searched. 

 A bomb-sniffing dog located spent matches in the cabin. After lengthy questioning by the FBI the unidentified Dallas woman admitted lighting the matches to disguise odour she said was caused by an unspecified medical condition.

 She was removed from the plane and the flight continued without her. She was trying to conceal body odour, said Lynne Lowrance, spokesman for Nashville International Airport, adding that there was no malicious intent but the womans actions had broken airline rules.

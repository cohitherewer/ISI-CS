 Pak to keep N-deterrent

 Islamabad, April 12 (Reuters): Pakistan, worried about a nuclear cooperation deal between rival India and the US, today said it will maintain a credible nuclear deterrent for its security.

 Pakistans Nuclear Command Authority (NCA), the top body that controls the countrys nuclear assets, criticised the US-India deal and said it would help New Delhi expand its nuclear weapons programme.

 The agreement would enable India to produce significant quantities of fissile material and nuclear weapons, said a NCA statement. The NCA expressed firm resolve that credible minimum deterrence requirements will be met.

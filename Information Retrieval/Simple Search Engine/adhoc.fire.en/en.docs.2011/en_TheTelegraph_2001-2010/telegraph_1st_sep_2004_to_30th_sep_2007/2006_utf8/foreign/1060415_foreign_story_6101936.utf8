 Kafka scale for red tape

 Kafka: Surreal

 Paris, April 14 (Reuters): France is campaigning to cut government red tape by using the name of writer Franz Kafka, who gave rise to the term Kafkaesque because of his portrayal of absurd, surreal and often frightening bureaucracies.

 The government has introduced what officials call a Kafka scale of one to 100 on how many forms, letters, phone calls and other steps are needed for companies and individuals to win state permits or aid for a project. Its an indicator to measure as objectively as possible the most complex procedures so that we can then simplify them, a government spokesman said.

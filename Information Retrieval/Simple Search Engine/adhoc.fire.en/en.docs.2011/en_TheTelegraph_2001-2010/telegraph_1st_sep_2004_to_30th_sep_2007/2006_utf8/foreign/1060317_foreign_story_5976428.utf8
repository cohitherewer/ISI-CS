 Brangelina rumours

 Cernobbio (Italy), March 16 (Reuters): Rumours that Hollywood sweethearts Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt could marry on the shores of Lake Como this weekend have transformed even quiet Italian villagers into star-struck gossip fans.

 The weeks-long speculation centres on the lakeside villa of Pitts friend and fellow actor George Clooney, where the couple are expected to arrive tomorrow, and the nearby luxury hotel of Villa dEste, once a romantic hideaway for stars such as Ava Gardner and Frank Sinatra.

 We dont have any bookings under their or their agents names, maybe because it will be an intimate celebration, said Villa dEste spokeswoman Antonella Chiesa. Pitt and Jolie, who are affectionately known as Brangelina, have not announced any wedding plans.

 Phil split

 New York (Reuters): For now, 

 theyll go on living Separate Lives. British 

 singer and songwriter Phil Collins and his wife of six years, 

 Orianne, have decided to separate, the couple said. Collins 

 will continue to live in Switzerland to be near his two 

 young children his publicist Mara Buxbaum said.

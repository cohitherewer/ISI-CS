 Iran flexes might at military parade

 Tehran, April 18 (Reuters): Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said during an armed forces parade today that any aggressor would regret attacking the Islamic Republic, which is embroiled in a nuclear dispute with the West.

 The President declared Iran a nuclear power last week after he said it had successfully enriched uranium to the level used in power stations. Iran insists its programme is civilian despite accusations by the West that it wants atomic bombs. The US has said it wants a diplomatic solution to the standoff but has not ruled out military action.

 Today, Irans army is one of the most powerful armies in the world and it will powerfully defend the countrys political borders and the nation, Ahmadinejad said in a brief speech before troops and missiles took part in an annual parade. It will cut off the hands of any aggressors and will make any aggressor regret it, he said.

 Ahmadinejad took the salute of thousands of army, navy and air force troops. Battle tanks were towed past on trucks, while helicopters and Russian-built warplanes flew in formation overhead. Parachutists sailed down from the sky. Torpedos and small submarines were also towed before the President, as were Nazeat 10 and Zelzal 1 missiles.

 The US-based Nuclear Threat Initiative security website says the solid-fuelled rocket Nazeat 10 missile has a range of 150 km. It said the Zelzal 1 was also a solid-fuelled rocket with a range of 125 km .

 Iran did not show off its longest range missile, the Shahab-3, which it says can hit targets 2,000 km away, putting Israel or US bases in the Gulf in range. Iran staged war games in the Gulf this month and tested what it said was a radar-evading missile and a high-speed sonar-evading torpedo.

 Jiang Zemin book

 Beijing, July 30 (Reuters): Former Chinese President Jiang Zemin has released a book intending to highlight his diplomatic prowess, at a time when he has been seeking to increase his political profile.

 For a Better World: Jiang Zemins Overseas Visits chronicles 12 years of travels, starting with a three-day trip to North Korea in 1990, the official Xinhua news agency said today.

 The 654-page volume, not yet widely available in bookstores, also details Jiangs (in picture) attendance at the ceremonies marking the return of Hong Kong and Macau to China, Xinhua said.

 Hundreds of diplomats and officials attended a book launch today in Beijing. Xinhua did not mention whether Jiang, 79, was present. He resides in Shanghai.

 The foreign ministry said on its website (www.fmprc. gov.cn) that the book demonstrated Jiangs contributions towards safeguarding Chinas independent and peaceful foreign policy.

 Lanka peace push

 Colombo, Sept. 27 (PTI): Hopes of revival of the Lanka peace process were raised today when a minister said Tamil Tiger chief Velupillai Prabhakaran had pledged commitment to talks with the government.

 We need concrete positive commitments from the leader of the LTTE to resume talks. He has given that, policy planning minister Keheloya Rambukwella said. 

 He declined to reveal how the commitment of the elusive Prabhakaran was conveyed to the government, but said a meeting between Norways ambassador Hans Brattskar and the LTTE political leadership last week was positive.

 Rambukwella said President Mahinda Rajapakse had wanted Prabhakaran himself to recommit to the peace process as the government could not accept the words of the LTTEs political wing leader and public face, S.P. Thamilselvan. 

 We are not prepared to play any more games, Rambukwella said.

 30 injured in Dhaka clashes on strike-eve

 Dhaka, June 12 (Reuters): At least 30 people were injured in Dhaka today in clashes between police and Opposition workers trying to whip up support for a nationwide strike, witnesses said.

 The clashes erupted after baton-wielding police swooped on thousands of activists trying to march through the streets of Dhaka on the eve of a two-day strike called by the 14-party Opposition alliance to press for electoral reforms ahead of elections next year.

 Several vehicles were set on fire in the latest unrest in Dhaka where some 200 people were injured yesterday during a similar protest.

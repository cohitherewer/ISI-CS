 Brown for more India trade

 AMIT ROY

 Stronger links 

 London, Nov. 28: Doubts that Gordon Brown would feel secure enough to leave Britain in the middle of a leadership contest were dispelled today when the Chancellor of the Exchequer confirmed that he will lead a senior trade and political delegation to India in mid-January.

 Speaking at the annual conference of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), Brown said that he wanted to boost closer economic links with China and India. That these two giants with a population of over two billion should account for only 5 per cent of UKs overseas trade was ridiculous, he said.

 Brown, who has been in charge of Britains finances ever since Labour came to power in 1997, is desperate to succeed Tony Blair as Prime Minister. The handover is expected to happen sometime next year.

 But the publicity that a potential rival, Dr John Reid, has received over his battle to combat terrorism has, fuelled the home secretarys ambitions that he could be an alternative candidate for Prime Minister, political observers say.

 In such an uncertain climate, some feared that Brown would postpone his first official trip to India. But today he said he would go to India.

 Indians will be relieved that Brown, an avowed champion of globalisation and free trade, does not want to take protectionist measures of the kind advocated by opponents of outsourcing to India.

 The only way of beating China and India, he indicated, was to upskill. But this will not be easy in a country with a rapidly ageing population and where the young would much rather do softer subjects such as media studies or drama in preference to physics. 

 Indeed, Reading University recently announced it is shutting its physics department for lack of money and interest.

 On his visit to India, Brown will be accompanied by Alastair Darling, the trade and industry secretary who is currently in China. The CBI has heard from a number of senior Indian representatives, among them Anand Mahindra, of Mahindra amp; Mahindra.

 Brown pledged: We will be promoting stronger links with India and China. He added: The challenge for Britain is to out perform our competitors. The answer to the jobs lost through offshoring is to upskill, and the answer to outsourcing is to out innovate.

 He warned: China and India are turning out 4 million graduates a year, Britain 250,000; and these people are not only raising skills in their countries, but challenging us Britain and other advanced nations in a race to the top. If we are to succeed in global economy, it is clear that we will have to make more of the potential of our own people.

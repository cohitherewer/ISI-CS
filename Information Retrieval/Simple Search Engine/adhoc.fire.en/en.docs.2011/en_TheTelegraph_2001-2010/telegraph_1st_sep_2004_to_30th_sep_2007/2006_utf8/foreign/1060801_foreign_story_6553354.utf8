 Bint Jbeil (Lebanon), July 31 (Reuters): The first words Deeba Ibrahim uttered when she saw rescue workers approaching to evacuate her from this southern Lebanese front-line town were please bring me water.

 Her face covered in cuts and her clothes in tatters, she said she had spent several days inside a deserted, damaged store in Bint Jbeil without food or water. I came here to stay with my daughter but I did not find her, said Ibrahim, a woman in her 70s wearing an Islamic dress, as she gulped water and juice.

 Take me to the hospital now, please, she told rescue workers, clinging to a plastic bag of medication.

 The areas around Bint Jbeil and the nearby village of Maroun al-Ras have seen the fiercest fighting between Israeli forces and Lebanese Hizbollah guerrillas during the Jewish states three-week-old offensive designed to cripple the Shia group. Heavy Israeli air strikes and artillery shelling flattened scores of houses in Bint Jbeil, which has a population of 4,000.

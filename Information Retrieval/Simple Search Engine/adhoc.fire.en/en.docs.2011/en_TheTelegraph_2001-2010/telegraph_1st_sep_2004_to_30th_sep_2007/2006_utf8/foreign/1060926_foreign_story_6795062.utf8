 Baby diverts flight

 London, Sept. 25 (Reuters): A transAtlantic flight from London to Boston had to make an emergency diversion after one passenger made an unexpected early arrival.

 A woman travelling on board the British Airways flight went into labour after the plane had taken off last night. Unable to reach another airport in time, the baby was delivered mid-air. 

 The captain diverted the plane to Halifax in Nova Scotia, Canada, while the cabin crew moved some nearby passengers to make some space on board for the woman. 

 Glare on bug buffet

 Gurnee, Illinois, Sept. 25 (AP): People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) wants Six Flags Great America to scrap its Halloween-themed cockroach-eating promotion. Peta says the contest at the amusement parks FrightFest is gratuitously cruel. The amusement park is offering unlimited line-jumping privileges to anyone who eats a live Madagascar hissing cockroach. The bugs are up to three inches long.

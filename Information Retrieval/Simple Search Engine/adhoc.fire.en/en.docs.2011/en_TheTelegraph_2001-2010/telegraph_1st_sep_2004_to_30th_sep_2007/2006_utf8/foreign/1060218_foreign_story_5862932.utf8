 T rex: Big body, sharp sense

 London, Feb. 17: Tyrannosaurus rex may have been a formidable ambush predator that tracked its prey with highly developed sensory radar, new research suggests.

 X-rays of the dinosaurs skull case indicate that it had unusually good balance as well as a keen sense of smell and sharp hearing.

 Scientists believe the combination would have helped the animal track targets like a missile system, using swift, agile movements of the head to detect and lock on to prey.

 Dr Lawrence Witmer, from Ohio University College of Osteopathic Medicine, used CT scans to explore the inside of a T rex skull and said the results were surprising.

 T rex has the inner ear of a much smaller, more agile animal, said Dr Witmer. This is very interesting, because T rex is a very large animal; its a gigantic animal.

 Its a movie star. We know its an animal that fed on meat. Whether predator or scavenger, it was the pinnacle of meat eaters.

 Now we know the sensory system of T rex was even more heightened than we thought, and its predatory prowess was greater than we thought.

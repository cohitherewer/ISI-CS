 School for auction

 Anchorage (Alaska), June 30 (Reuters): Local officials in the rural Alaskan town of King Cove have put an old school up for sale on eBay, saying they hope to raise $1.8 million.

 The Aleutians East Borough has put the school in the southwestern Alaska coastal village of 725 people up for sale on the online auction house eBay, hoping a new owner can take advantage of the 3,995-square-metre buildings location on the waterfront in the midst of Alaskas biggest commercial seafood harvests, officials said.

 because of similarities in the music and fashion worlds 

 they live in, a Hong Kong magazine reported. I think 

 part of why its (the marriage) worked is that we understand 

 each others businesses so completely, she said.

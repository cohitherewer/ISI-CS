 Rocky fights for the 60 set

 Los 

 Angeles, Dec. 14 (Reuters): At 60, Sylvester Stallone 

 thinks its time to show people that the careers of 

 guys like me, can last long after most people 

 retire, and he sets out to prove it in his new movie, Rocky 

 Balboa.

 This is uncharted waters. People are living longer. They are healthier. They have more ambition, more energy, yet society is telling them to move aside, Stallone said. Its different now, and I thought: Boy, if I could just come up with a dramatic premise to use as a platform.

 Balboa, which debuts in US theatres on December 20, is the sixth movie in a series that began with 1976s Rocky. Stallone famously raised about $1 million to make that low-budget film based on a screenplay he wrote and would not sell to Hollywoods studios unless he was the star. The original movie tells of a hapless boxer, Rocky The Italian Stallion Balboa, who overcomes huge odds to better his life. It became a surprise smash hit, earning over $117 million at US box offices ($362 million in todays dollars), winning the Oscar for best film, and making Stallone a worldwide star.

 Four other movies followed the Philadelphia boxer through various stages career success, family troubles and bankruptcy. Stallone said the lovable lug has been championed by fans because he is humble, can be self-deprecating and is sometimes fearful of what life offers. He has an almost childlike naivete in the body of a very courageous fighter, Stallone said.

 Capitol scare

 security breach

 Washington, Sept. 18 (Reuters): An armed man barrelled through a security barrier in his car and then ran into the US Capitol today, prompting police to shut the building down briefly before capturing him, authorities said.

 The man was carrying a small handgun in his pocket during the 8 am breach at one of Washingtons most heavily secured government buildings, police said.

 He was captured shortly afterward in the basement flag room, on the House of Representatives side, they said. He was unstable. He apparently thought the devil or the demons were chasing him, an official said.

 The congressional day had barely begun when the man was arrested and it appeared there were no members of Congress in the building at the time. The sprawling Capitol building was re-opened after about an hour. 

 The suspect breached security with his car first and then got out and ran into the building, police said. The man apparently suffered a seizure and was treated by the Capitols medical staff.

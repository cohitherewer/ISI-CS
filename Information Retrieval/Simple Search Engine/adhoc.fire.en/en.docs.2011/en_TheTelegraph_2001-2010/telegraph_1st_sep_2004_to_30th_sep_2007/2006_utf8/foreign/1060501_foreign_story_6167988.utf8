 Rice alert for Iran 

 Washington, April 30 (Reuters): US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice warned the US might take steps outside the UN Security Council to pressure Iran to stop its nuclear programme. 

 Rice today said if the council did not act quickly enough against Iran, Washington and its allies would not wait. Iran has so far defied the UN demand to stop uranium enrichment. Tehran today renewed its defiant stand, saying it would continue to defy the council. 

 Iraq talks 

 Baghdad (Reuters): Iraqs President said on Sunday he and US officials had met with insurgents and that a deal with some groups to end violence could be reached. The statement by Jalal Talabani came as Iraqs various factions negotiate on a new government. 

 Egypt law 

 Cairo (Reuters): Egypts parliament today agreed to 

a two-year extension of emergency law requested by the government while it prepares 

replacement anti-terrorism laws. Emergency law has been in force since 1981, when 

Islamist militants killed President Anwar Sadat. It gives the government power 

to detain people without charge and restrict civil liberties.

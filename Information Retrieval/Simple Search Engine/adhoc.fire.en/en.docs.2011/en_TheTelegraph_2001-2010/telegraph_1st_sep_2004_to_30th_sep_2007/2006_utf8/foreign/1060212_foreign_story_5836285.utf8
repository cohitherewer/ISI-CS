 Rome, Feb. 11 (Reuters): Greece and Italy said today they had found swans with the H5N1 bird flu virus, the first known cases in the EU of wild birds with the deadly strain of the disease.

 As the slow creep of the virus around the globe continued, Romania said more infections were suspected in birds in the Danube delta and Bulgaria said the lethal strain had been confirmed among swans in wetlands close to the Romanian border. The region is a haven and transit point for migrating birds.

 Nigeria started testing people who have fallen ill close to where the virus has been found among birds, in the first outbreak in African of a disease that has spread seemingly inexorably across the Eurasian landmass from China and Vietnam.

 Finance ministers of the Group of Eight (G8), meeting in Moscow, discussed the risk of a worldwide pandemic and issued a new call for wealthy countries to help poor ones fight bird flu.

 Italy said wild swans found in the southern island of Sicily and the mainland regions of Puglia and Calabria had tested positive for the highly pathogenic version of the H5N1 strain.

 Of the 17 dead swans, the majority (died) of H5N1, but this does not mean all, health minister Francesco Storace said. Transport of animals susceptible to the virus will be banned in the three regions, Storace said, adding that no bird flu had been found in farm or domestic birds and there was no need to fear a risk to human health.

 A regional health official in Sicily said the swans were believed to have migrated from Russia.

 Three swans sent by Greece to the EU lab in Britain tested positive for the deadly strain, said a senior Greek agriculture ministry official. A sample from a wild goose on Skyros island in the Aegean has also been sent to Britain.

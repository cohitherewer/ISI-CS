 Pak, Russia to boost ties

 Putin: Strategic ties

 Islamabad, Nov. 16: Pakistan and Russia today pledged to lay the foundation of a strategic partnership in diverse areas including security and defence.

 We are trying to lay the foundation of such a partnership by ensuring implementation of earlier agreements reached between the two countries to further reinforce bilateral cooperation, Pakistan foreign minister Khurshid Mehmud Kasuri and his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov said in Islamabad after the talks.

 Lavrov arrived in Islamabad last night for talks with Pakistani leaders on ways to boost cooperation in investment and trade.

 The ties between the two nations had cooled off due to Pakistans links with the Taliban regime in Afghanistan and the support given by religious groups in Pakistan to extremists in the breakaway region of Chechnya. 

 However, the situation improved six years ago after President Pervez Musharraf met his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin and removed Moscows misunderstandings.

 From $50 million, the volume of bilateral trade reached the $500 million mark last year. 

 Russia attaches great importance to its relations with Pakistan, which is an important Islamic country, located in the close proximity of the Commonwealth of Independent States , Lavrov said. He added that his country was ready to consider the possibility of cooperation with Pakistan in the defence field.

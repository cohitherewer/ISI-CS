 Kathmandu ban on protests

 Kathmandu, April 4 (Reuters): Nepals royalist government today indefinitely banned protests in Kathmandu, two days ahead of a general strike and a series of protests against King Gyanendras seizure of power.

 The ban would come into force from tomorrow in Kathmandu and the neighbouring temple-town of Lalitpur, a government statement said.

 The main political parties have planned a four-day nationwide general strike from Thursday and a series of big protests in Kathmandu against the king, who seized power last year. The government said the ban was necessary to maintain law and order as Maoist rebels could infiltrate the demonstrations and incite violence.

 The government move came a day after the Maoists announced an indefinite ceasefire in Kathmandu and its surrounding valley to help make the protests successful.

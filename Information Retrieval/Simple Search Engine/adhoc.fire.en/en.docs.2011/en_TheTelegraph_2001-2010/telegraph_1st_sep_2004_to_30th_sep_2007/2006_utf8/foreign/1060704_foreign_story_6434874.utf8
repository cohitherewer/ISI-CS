The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Fine Print

 Superb Shakira

 London, July 3 (Reuters): Colombian singer Shakira reached the top of the pop charts for the first time yesterday with her new single Hips Dont Lie.

 The collaboration with Haitian-American rapper Wyclef Jean has already topped the US Billboard Hot 100 singles chart, thanks largely to Internet download sales.

 Shakira has enjoyed several top five singles in Britain, including the worldwide hit Whenever, Wherever, but has never before had a UK number one single.

 She knocked Canadian pop star Nelly Furtados Maneater off the top spot after three weeks.

 Grand fear

 Rome (Reuters): An Italian man escaped from house arrest 

and begged police to put him in jail because he could not bear living with his 

grandfather, his lawyer said on Monday. The 30-year-old was under house arrest 

for six months in the Sardinian town of Sassari after a scuffle with a policeman. 

But he escaped and on Sunday showed up at a police station in the northern city 

of Genoa, asking them to arrest him and put him in a cell.

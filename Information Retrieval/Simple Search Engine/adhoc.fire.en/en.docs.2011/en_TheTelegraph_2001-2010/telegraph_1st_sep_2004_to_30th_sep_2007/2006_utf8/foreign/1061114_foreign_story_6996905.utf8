 Snake threat

 Sydney, Nov. 13 (Reuters): An Australian driver threatened police with a live snake after he was pulled over for a breath test for driving under the influence of alcohol, police said today.

 The driver in the outback Northern Territory was stopped on Saturday night by police just outside the city of Darwin after they saw him swerving, police said.

 After registering a blood alcohol level well over the legal limit, the man ran onto the road and picked up a live snake. The driver allegedly armed himself with a live snake, pointed the head of the reptile at them and threatened them, said police.

 Police told the man to drop the snake, but he ran into bushland still carrying it. The man has been charged with drunken driving. 

 Erotic ban

 San Francisco (Reuters): A court has 

 upheld a Las Vegas city regulation barring erotic dancers 

 from raunchy physical contact with their customers, in a 

 ruling that runs counter to the citys sinful reputation.

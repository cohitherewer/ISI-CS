 Pullout date in Iraq PM frame

 Washington, Dec. 1 (Reuters): Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki has said his countrys forces would be able to assume security command by June 2007, which could allow the US to start withdrawing its troops.

 I cannot answer on behalf of the US administration but I can tell you that from our side our forces will be ready by June 2007, Maliki told ABC television yesterday night after meeting President George Bush in Jordan.

 Maliki was replying to a question whether US troops could start withdrawing at that time. ABC released a transcript of the interview ahead of its broadcast later in the day.

 At the beginning of next year we will increase the training of our forces.... When they reach an acceptable level, we can talk about transferring power from multinational forces to Iraqi forces, he said.

 I can say that Iraqi forces will be ready, fully ready to receive this command and to command its own forces, and I can tell you that by next June our forces will be ready.

 Maliki rejected the notion that he was incapable of getting militias including that run by radical Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr under control. But he added that Iraqi security forces needed more weapons and training.

 Bushs national security adviser said the President would take weeks rather than months to start making changes in his Iraq policy after he receives high-level recommendations on the conduct of the war. 

 There is a real sense of urgency but there is not a sense of panic, Stephen Hadley said.

 Bush had yesterday said US troops would stay in Iraq till the job is complete.

 US officials said Bush would hold White House talks with top Iraqi Shia leader Abdul Aziz al-Hakim on Monday and also meet the countrys Sunni Vice-President next month.

 Hours after Maliki spoke, bombs had killed five people in Baghdad today.

 Three people were killed and 22 wounded, police said, when a car bomb blasted the Ghazil market, which sells a raucous, colourful range of creatures, from guard dogs and monkeys to parrots, pigeons and tropical fish.

 In the Shia suburb of Husseiniya, north of the capital, another car bomb killed two people and wounded 13.

 In central Baghdad, machinegun fire rained from US helicopters as US and Iraqi troops clashed with gunmen during a raid to seize militants, police and witnesses said.

 The fighting erupted when the troops moved into the Fadhil area, a stronghold of Sunni insurgents, and were fired on by militants hiding in houses.

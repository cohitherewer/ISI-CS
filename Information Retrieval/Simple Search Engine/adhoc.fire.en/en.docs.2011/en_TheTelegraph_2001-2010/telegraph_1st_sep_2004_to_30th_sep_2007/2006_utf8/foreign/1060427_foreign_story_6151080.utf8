The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Jolie breaks silence

 Johannesburg, April 26 (Reuters): Heavily-pregnant Angelina Jolie broke her silence today from her African hideaway, but she wasnt talking babies or Brad Pitt.

 Jolie, whose trip to Namibia has sparked a blaze of interest in the international media, took time to promote one of her favourite causes: boosting educational opportunities for the worlds poor.

 Talking to reporters in a teleconference with British finance minister Gordon Brown, Jolie said it was time for the world to get behind the Global Campaign for Education, a new plan aimed at giving 100 million children in poor countries the chance to go to school.

 Im just thrilled to have this opportunity to help bring this to the forefront of peoples minds this week... It is a rare occasion that I am really thanking the press, said Jolie.

 She and Pitt have seen their Namibian hotel besieged by paparazzi photographers eager for pictures of the couples expected child.

 Jolies call came as US activists increased pressure for support for the education initiative, which got a boost this month when Brown announced the British government would spend $15 billion over 10 years to train teachers and build and equip schools in poor countries.

 Brown said the onus was now on other developed countries to pitch in, adding that he was sure both the World Bank and the IMF would both sharpen the worlds focus on the need for education. We have to raise $10 billion per year if we are to ensure that every child has access to education, Brown said.

 The appeal for help for the worlds underprivileged children marked a return to form for Jolie, who together with Pitt has in recent weeks played a cat-and-mouse game with reporters desperate for news of their first child.

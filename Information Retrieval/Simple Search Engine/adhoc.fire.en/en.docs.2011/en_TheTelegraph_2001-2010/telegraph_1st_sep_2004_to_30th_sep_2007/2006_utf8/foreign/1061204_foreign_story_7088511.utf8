 Tree frauds

 London, Dec. 3: Posing as tree surgeons, three workmen preyed on the elderly so successfully that they netted 225,000 in seven years, reports The Daily Telegraph.

 But they failed to fool one householder when they knocked on her door and offered to prune her poplar tree.

 Sandra Martin, 60, asked: What poplar tree?, and when the ringleader pointed to a telegraph pole with ivy growing over it, she smelt a rat and alerted police.

 Sex sauce

 London (Reuters): Nearly two-thirds of 

 Britons think the fiery Italian sauce Arrabiata is a sex 

 infection, according to a survey. The survey, of 1,015 people 

 and released on World AIDS day, also showed nearly half 

 were unable to identify a range of common sexual complaints. 

 What is very worrying is the lack of knowledge about 

 sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) revealed in the survey, 

 said sex therapist Emily Dubberley. Sixty-three per 

 cent in the UK thought an Italian sauce was an STD and over 

 43 per cent couldnt identify any of the common sexual 

 complaints we asked about. 

 Vote miss

 Istanbul (Reuters): A blind Turkish 

 pensioner has been sentenced to a 26-day reading and writing 

 course at his local public library after he failed to vote 

 on time for his village cooperatives election , his 

 son has said. A prosecutor in the province of Kutahya in 

 northwest Turkey sentenced Ismail Canseven, 73, to the course 

 after he did not show up for the election of the cooperatives 

 board of directors in May, Isa Canseven said. In Turkey, 

 people are obliged by law to vote in elections.

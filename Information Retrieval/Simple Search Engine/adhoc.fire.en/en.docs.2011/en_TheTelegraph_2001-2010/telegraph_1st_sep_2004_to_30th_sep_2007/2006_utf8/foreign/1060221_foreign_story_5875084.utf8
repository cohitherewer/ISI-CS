 Rain turns fashion queens into gymnasts

 London, Feb. 20: Celebrity dressing was put to the test at the Baftas last night. 

 As the rain poured down and the wind howled, it required a will of iron, the balancing skills of an Olympic gymnast and, preferably, two burly minders with a brolly apiece, to negotiate the waterlogged red carpet and a 30 feet cantilevered ramp of slippery PVC squares which were like climbing a toboggan run uphill.

 The languid or lavish long dress beat the short, sharpmini; furs were blatantly displayed and diamonds glistened on necks and wrists, courtesy of Steinmetz and De Grisogono which had operated a millionaires answer to pick mix in a heavily guarded hotel suite.

 Thandie Newton, best supporting actress for her role in Crash, which won two awards, was one of the fashion queens of the night in a billowing, tea-rose, pink satin strapless, crinoline gown by Christian Lacroix, emblazoned with a black tulle bow.

 Mischa Barton also picked pastel, entering like a fairy princess in jewels by Bulgari and a cloud of pale lilac silk by the London-based label, Marchesa, one of whose designers, Georgina Chapman, arrived minutes later with her boyfriend, Harvey Weinstein of Miramax. 

 Renee Zellweger, who wisely bypassed the slippery entrance ramp, chose a black silk gown that was as much grand exit as grand entrance, featuring a plunge back, criss-crossed with straps set with a diamante motif. 

 Charlize Theron, however, with De Grisogono diamonds twinkling in the paparazzi lights, negotiated the ramp by hoisting her hourglass navy silk faille Lanvin gown by Alber Elbaz above her knees, a feat facilitated by the split in the front of the long skirt.

 Ziyi Zhang, star of the Memoirs of a Geisha, kept out the chill in a rabbit-fur jacket over a white sequined long gown from Giorgio Armanis Priv? collection.

 Anna Wintour, editor in chief of American Vogue and the constant target of the Peta activists, however, left her Fendi furs at home and braved the sub-zero temperatures in a strappy gold Prada sheath-dress.

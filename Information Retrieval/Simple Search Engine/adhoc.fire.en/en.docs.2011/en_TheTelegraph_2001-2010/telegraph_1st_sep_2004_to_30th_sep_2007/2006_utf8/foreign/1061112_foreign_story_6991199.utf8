 Colossal storm found churning on Saturn

 London, Nov. 11: A colossal hurricane-like storm with a well-developed eye ringed by towering clouds has been observed churning at Saturns south pole, the first time such an event has been detected on a planet other than Earth.

 The storm on the giant, ringed planet measures about 5,000 miles wide, roughly two- thirds the diameter of Earth, with winds howling clockwise at 350 mph. Jupiters Great Red Spot, which swirls counter-clockwise, is far bigger, but is less like a hurricane because it lacks the typical eye and eye wall. 

 The images were captured by the Cassini spacecraft as it passed about 210,000 miles from the planet as part of its exploration of Saturn and its moons.

 The sequence taken by Cassinis camera over three hours reveals the shadow cast by a ring of towering clouds surrounding the pole, and two spiral arms of clouds extending from the central ring. These ring clouds, 20 to 45 miles above those in the storms heart, are two to five times taller than the clouds of Earths thunderstorms and hurricanes.

 Eye-wall clouds are a distinguishing feature of hurricanes on Earth. They form where moist air flows inward across the oceans surface, rising vertically and releasing heavy rain around an interior circle of descending air that stares out of the eye of the storm.

 Though it is uncertain whether such moist convection is driving Saturns storm, the dark eye at the pole, the eye-wall clouds and the spiral arms indicate a hurricane-like system.

 Michael Flasar, an astrophysicist involved in the mission at Nasas Goddard Space Flight Centre in Greenbelt, Maryland, said the storm looked just like water swirling down the plug hole of a bath tub, only on a gigantic scale. Weve never seen anything like this before, Flasar said. 

 The giant storm differs from Earth hurricanes in part because it is stuck at the pole rather than drifting, as such storms do on this planet, and because it did not form over a liquid ocean, with Saturn being a gaseous planet.

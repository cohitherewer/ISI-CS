 Gooey trap

 Kenosha (Wisconsin), Aug. 19 (AP): A 21-year-old man was trapped in a tank of chocolate for about two hours, police here said.

 Captain Randy Berner said the worker got into the tank at the Debelis Corp yesterday to unplug it and became trapped waist-deep in the chocolate.

 It was pretty thick. It was virtually like quicksand, Berner said, and co-workers, police and firefighters were not able to get him out until the chocolate could be thinned out.

 The worker said his ankles were sore after the incident. 

 Strip Poker

 London (Reuters): Up to 200 

 strip poker players competed on Saturday to see who will 

 lose their shirts and more and who will scoop 10,000 

 by retaining their clothes and modesty. Organised by Irish 

 bookmaker Paddy Power, the inaugural World Strip Poker Championship 

 took place at the Cafe Royal in central London with players 

 battling it out in games of No Limit Texas Hold em. 

 The bookmaker said it decided to hold the competition after 

 its spoof April Fool earlier this year.

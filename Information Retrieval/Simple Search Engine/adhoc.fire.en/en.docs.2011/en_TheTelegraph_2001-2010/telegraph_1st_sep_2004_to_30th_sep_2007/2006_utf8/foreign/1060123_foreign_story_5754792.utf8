 Islamabad, Jan. 22 (Reuters): Pakistans top rights group on Sunday accused President Pervez Musharrafs military- led government of gross human rights violations in Baluchistan province, where it said a war-like situation prevailed.

 The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) also rejected government claims that it was not using regular armed forces in a crackdown in the southwestern province launched last month after rocket attacks by tribal militants battling for greater autonomy and control of lucrative natural gas fields.

 The group said it had received evidence that action by armed forces had led to deaths and injuries among civilians and that populations had also been subjected to indiscriminate bombing.

 The HRCP report said up to 85 per cent the 22,000-26,000 inhabitants of Dera Bugti had fled their homes after the town was repeatedly hit by shelling by paramilitary forces.

 There were alarming accounts of summary executions, some allegedly carried out by paramilitary forces. HRCP received credible evidence that showed such killings had taken place, it said.

 Across Baluchistan, the HRCP team found widespread instances of disappearance, of torture inflicted on people held in custody, and on those fleeing from their houses, it added.

 However HRCP chairperson Asma Jahangir told a news conference that interviews with local people had not provided evidence to prove a claim by Baluch opposition politicians that the military had used poison gas.

 The security forces, as well as the decision-makers, have remained completely unaccountable for the gross human rights violations in the province, including responsibility for the internally displaced people, the report said. 

 There is a war-like situation, militarisation and politico-economic conflict in Baluchistan, it said.

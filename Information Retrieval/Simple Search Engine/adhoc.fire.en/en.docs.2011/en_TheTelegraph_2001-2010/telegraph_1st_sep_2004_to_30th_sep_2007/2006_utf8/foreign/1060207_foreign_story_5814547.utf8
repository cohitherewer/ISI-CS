 Tehran uranium signal

 Tehran, Feb. 6 (Reuters): Iran today said inspectors from the UNs nuclear watchdog will visit in the next few days to oversee the resumption of uranium enrichment ? a process that can be used to make bomb-grade material.

 Iran decided to resume enrichment that was suspended for over two years, after the board of governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency voted on Saturday to report it to the UN Security Council.

 EU officials have warned that Irans enrichment plans and curtailment of UN nuclear inspections in retaliation for the IAEA vote will exacerbate its nuclear case, making the prospect of UN sanctions against Tehran more likely. 

 In a letter to the agency we announced the date and the inspectors will come to Iran for it in the next few days, Ali Larijani, secretary of Irans Supreme National Security Council, said.

 Chinas new status symbol

 Beijing, Dec. 3: Luxury cars, yachts and diamonds are commonplace for Chinas super-rich, but a new status symbol has been added to their list of must-haves the wet nurse. 

 The practice of infants being suckled by women other than their mothers was branded decadent by Mao Tse-tung and was stamped out by the countrys post-war leaders. 

 But in the booming cities of the east coast, the moneyed classes are no longer constrained by the taboos of their communist overlords and they are looking to the past excesses of their ancestors. Pu Yi, the subject of Bernardo Bertoluccis film The Last Emperor (1987), was suckled well into his teens. 

 To have a wet nurse is a status symbol and young mothers are being lured by the promise of up to eight times their existing salary to breastfeed the offspring of the rich. At first I had my doubts, but the money convinced me, said one wet nurse, known as Madam Gu. Now I earn five times more than the 1,000 kuai (65) a month I used to get from the trading company I worked for. 

 A poor college graduate from Lianyungang City in Jiangsu province, the 28-year-old joined the household of a Shanghai family this summer. After leaving her newborn baby with relatives, she had to provide test samples of her breast milk and undergo a medical examination. 

 In addition to producing high-quality milk, the new breed of wet nurses are often required to emulate their imperial predecessors by displaying refined manners and reciting Ming dynasty poetry. Even their diets are strictly prescribed, including traditional herbs and medicinal dishes, such as stewed pigs trotters. 

 However, if their infant fails to grow by at least 20g a day (about 0.7oz), stiff fines are docked from their wages. According to Gu, she is fortunate that her employer allows relatives to bring her own baby to see her once every three months. 

 Housekeeping agencies have been quick to exploit the market by adding wet nurses to their lists of domestic servants, cooks, and drivers. One agent, a former shoe-factory worker, received 200 orders for wet nurses within days of his launch. 

 One agency in Guangdong recently launched a public relations campaign to promote an image more suited to Maos communist ideals, by allowing state television to interview one of its wet nurses.

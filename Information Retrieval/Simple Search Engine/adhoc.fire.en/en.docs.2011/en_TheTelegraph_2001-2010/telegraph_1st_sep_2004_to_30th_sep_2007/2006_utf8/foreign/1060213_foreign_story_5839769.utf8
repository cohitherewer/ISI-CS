 Dogs, not hubby, close to Bardot

 TONY PATERSON 

 Bardot: All for animals

 Berlin, Feb. 12: Brigitte Bardot, the 71-year-old former film star criticised for supporting Frances extreme Right, has admitted becoming a virtual recluse who shuns society and feels closer to her dogs than her husband. 

 In a rare interview granted in the run-up to the Berlin film festival, the ageing sex icon, now crippled by arthritis, said she rarely ventured out of doors and claimed that caring for animals had become almost her sole raison d?tre. 

 Asked whether she was still interested in people, Bardot told the German Die Zeit newspaper: I am not even interested in myself. What am I supposed to do? Get my nails done? I never go to the hairdresser or a restaurant. The whole society business gets on my nerves. Its all over. 

 Once considered a rival to Marilyn Monroe, Bardot quit films in 1973 and has since devoted her life to caring for stray and maltreated animals through her Paris-based Brigitte Bardot Foundation. Her fourth husband, Bernard dOrmale, 53, whom she married in 1993, is an executive member of Jean Marie Le Pens far-right National Front Party. 

 She said animals were all she needed and her dogs were closer than any person could be. Asked whether that included her husband, Bardot said: You know what? I was always the man of my life. 

 Frances long love affair with the actress who became known simply as BB ended in 2003 with the publication of her book Un Cri dans Le Silence. It attacked Islam, homosexuals, the unemployed and illegal immigrants and called for a return of the guillotine. 

 Bardot ended up in court and was fined ?3,400 for inciting racial hatred. Yet last week, the actress who once shocked the French middle-classes with her libertine lifestyle, appeared unrepentant and said she had written it because she was worried about France.

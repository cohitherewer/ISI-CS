 Prince drops tailored suit

 ANDREW ALDERSON

 Charles: The right fit?

 London, Jan. 29: For decades he followed the tradition of his royal forefathers, dressing impeccably in ?4,000 suits from Savile Row. 

 Now, however, Prince Charles has shocked the world of fine tailoring by turning his back on his distinctive bespoke outfits. Instead, he has become the first heir to the throne in modern times to buy made-to-measure alternatives ? at less than half the price. 

 The move has prompted accusations that the Prince of Wales has let bespoke tailors ? and himself ? down by looking, in his mid-fifties, far less elegantly dressed. It has seen him desert the tailors Anderson amp; Sheppard, removing their prestigious royal warrant, after being a loyal customer for the past two decades. 

 Royal sources say that Charles, 57, has recently bought several made-to-measure suits from Turnbull amp; Asser, who have a royal warrant for their shirts since 1980. 

 It is thought his turning away from bespoke tailoring may have been influenced by his new wife, the Duchess of Cornwall, while others suspect his frugal private secretary, Sir Michael Peat. 

 The relationship between a man and his tailor has been likened to that of a woman and her hairdresser: it usually inspires great loyalty but occasionally the relationship can, to use a phrase Prince Charles coined for his first marriage, irretrievably break down. 

 Thomas Mahon, one of Britains most respected tailors, who made Charless suits for three years until 1995, said he believed the move towards more casual, made-to-measure suits was a mistake. 

 Mahon, who was a senior tailor at Anderson amp; Sheppard, said: I think what has happened is very sad. He was photographed in November with Camilla and President and Mrs Bush outside the White House and, almost 20 years ago to the day, he was photographed in the same place with Diana and President and Mrs Reagan. The change is so apparent. 

 Twenty years ago ? when he was wearing Anderson amp; Sheppard ? he looked so elegant. But in the photograph two months ago he looked bloody awful in a made- to-measure suit. To fit the human body is not the hardest job in the world but character and style ? thats the challenge. 

 Bespoke is a term dating from the 17th century, when tailors held the full lengths of cloth on their premises. When a customer chose a length, it was said to have been spoken for. A tailor who makes a customers clothes individually is called bespoke. 

 More than 20 measurements and figuration details are taken from a customer before his suit is cut. 

 That is unlike made-to-measure, which simply uses a template pattern that is then adjusted, with less precision, to an individuals measurements. 

 Mahon, whose company, English Cut, has clients in America, said: We are constantly being told (by his aides) that Prince Charles is more confident and relaxed. But he certainly looked more confident and relaxed in the suit from 20 years ago ? and a lot of that is down to the tailoring. 

 Prince Charless newly favoured tailors, Turnbull amp; Asser, who have premises in Jermyn Street, sells made-to-measure suits costing from ?1,400 to ?2,500. 

 John Hitchcock, the managing director of Anderson amp; Sheppard, which is 100 years old this year, confirmed that the Prince was no longer a customer. The firm had made 20 suits for him. Its unfortunate but if Prince Charles chooses to buy made-to-measure suits ? or even factory-made suits ? thats up to him, he said. 

 Charless new image has its fans as well as its critics. When Andre 3000, the hip-hop singer with the band OutKast, came to London to pick up an award from GQ magazine in 2004, he said: Prince Charles is my number one British style icon. 

 The last word, however, should go to Richard Walker, the author of Savile Row: An Illustrated History: The perfect suit is like the perfect wine ? it does not exist, except in terms of individual taste.

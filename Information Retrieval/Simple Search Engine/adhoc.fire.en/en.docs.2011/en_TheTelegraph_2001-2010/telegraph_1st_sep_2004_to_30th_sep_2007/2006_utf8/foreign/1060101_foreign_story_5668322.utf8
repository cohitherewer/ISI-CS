 New Year Eve Tube strike hits London

 London, Dec. 31 (Reuters): Hundreds of thousands of London New Years Eve revellers faced transport chaos today as underground rail station staff staged a 24-hour strike on one of the busiest nights of the year.

 The Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union said the industrial action would take full effect around mid-evening as staff failed to turn up for their shifts following the strikes midday start.

 The walkout threatened to undermine a planned free underground service which had been due to run from 11.45 pm.

 Transport officials said they hoped to be able to provide some service on all underground lines but advised passengers to plan alternative routes home.

 Some three million people use Londons Underground, also known as the Tube, every day, though the numbers go down during the weekend. The Tube is the oldest underground rail network in the world with 275 stations.

 The RMT union is striking over the introduction of new work rosters which they say will reduce safety levels.

 The rosters that London Underground intend to impose would reduce the number of station staff on duty at any one time, in many cases by more than half, RMT general secretary Bob Crow said. 

 We believe that would leave stations with insufficient cover, especially in emergencies.

 Operator London Underground denied the rotas were unsafe, saying there would be no reduction in station staffing. 

 London mayor Ken Livingstone and London Underground condemned the strike, saying it may ruin the night for revellers in London where celebrations include a fireworks display at the London Eye wheel on the south bank of the river Thames.

 The strike will also affect a New Years Day parade which starts at Parliament Square at midday on Sunday and features 10,000 performers from around the world.

 Parade publicist Dan Kirkby told BBC radio the strike threatened to ruin two years of preparations.

 London deserves better than this, he said.We are urging people to take a little time and effort, come on overground trains and drive and walk.

 A second underground strike has been set for Jan. 8-9.

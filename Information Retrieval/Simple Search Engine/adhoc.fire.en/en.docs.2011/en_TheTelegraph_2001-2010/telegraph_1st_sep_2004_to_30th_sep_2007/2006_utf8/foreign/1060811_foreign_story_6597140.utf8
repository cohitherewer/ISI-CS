 Bomb hidden in liquid

 NIC FLEMING

 London, Aug. 10: Terrorists involved in the suspected plot could have been planning to combine explosive ingredients disguised as common, everyday items such as mineral water, fizzy drinks and sugar. 

 Measures introduced at UK airports included specific restrictions on taking liquids on board, prompting speculation that evidence had been uncovered of a plot to smuggle liquid explosive devices onto flights. Passengers travelling with infants were being asked to taste baby milk they intended to carry on their journey in front of security staff. 

 Andy Oppenheimer, editor of Janes Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Defence Directory, said: There are a lot of homemade mixtures you can concoct from some very common materials that are innocent in themselves. We are talking about common, everyday chemicals that are used in perfumes, cosmetics, drain cleaner, batteries, or could for example be stolen from school labs. These materials are easy to obtain and hard to detect, and could be smuggled in small amounts in small containers because it doesnt take much to blow an aircraft up.

 Oppenheimer added that the ingredients would have to be mixed together in the correct proportions and that the resulting mixture would be very unstable and sensitive to shock or heat. 

 Terrorist gangs have long been aware of the potential of combining common ingredients including liquids to create homemade explosives. Police believe acetone peroxide triacetone triperoxide was the home-made explosive used in London on July 7 last year in the attacks that killed 56 people.

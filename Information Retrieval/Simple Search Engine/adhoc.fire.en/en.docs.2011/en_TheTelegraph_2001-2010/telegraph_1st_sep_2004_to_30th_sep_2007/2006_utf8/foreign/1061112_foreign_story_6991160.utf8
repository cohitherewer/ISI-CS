The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 No alcohol, no concert 

 MATTHEW MOORE

 London, Nov. 11: Guns N Roses have pulled out of a major show after being told that they could not drink alcohol on stage.

 The rock band cancelled their performance in Portland, Maine, just hours after fire marshals said they would not be able to swig wine and beer while performing. 

 Axl Rose, the band leader, released a statement apologising to fans and blaming the situation squarely on local officials. It was important for us to play there and it is a shame that what should have been a great night for all of us was not possible due to the actions of two people, he said. I agree with, and ultimately take responsibility for, the end decision not to jeopardise the safety of the fans, the crews, the bands and myself as a result of the methods of these particularly draconian authorities. 

 A spokesman for the band blamed fire marshals for making it impossible for the band to perform their show to the usual high standards that their fans deserve.

 State law in Maine prohibits performers from drinking while on stage, and bans employees at establishments with alcohol licences from drinking on the job. Rose has pledged to organise another date in Maine.

 Study: Kissing risky

 NIC FLEMING

 London, Feb. 10: Teenagers who intimately kiss many different people almost quadruple their risk of developing meningitis, according to a study to be published today.

 Researchers found that 15- to 19-year-olds who engaged in what they termed deep kissing with multiple partners were 3.7 times more likely to get meningococcal disease.

 Children under five and adolescents face the greatest risk from the disease that can cause serious disability and death from septicaemia if the bacteria overcome the bodys defences to get into the bloodstream, or meningitis if it reaches the brain.The reasons for a marked shift in age distribution towards older teenagers in Britain and the US during the 1990s has so far been poorly understood.

 Scientists compared the lifestyles of older teenagers admitted to hospital with meningococcal disease with those of a healthy control group. 

 Meningitis bacteria live in the back of the nose and throat and are carried by a large proportion of the population. They are frequently passed harmlessly between individuals. It is only when a persons immune system defences are weakened that invasive infections occur.

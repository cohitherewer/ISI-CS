 Penguin farce

 Los Angeles, March 25 (Reuters): Actor Samuel L. Jackson has signed on to narrate an upcoming spoof of the Oscar-winning documentary March of the Penguins with an all-star supporting voice cast, independent studio ThinkFilm said yesterday.

 Farce of the Penguins, mixing archival wildlife footage with an R-rated screenplay written and directed by comedian Bob Saget, is aimed for a late-summer theatrical release, ThinkFilm spokesman Alex Klenert said.

 In press materials, ThinkFilm described Farce 

of the Penguins as the story of one penguins search for love while 

on a 112-km trek with his libidinous buddies on their way to a hedonistic mating 

ritual.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Bureaucrats, lend me your ears

 London, June 11: Once more unto the brief dear friends, once more. The British government has spent over ?140,000 of taxpayers money sending Whitehall mandarins on Shakespeare training courses.

 According to documents released to The Daily Telegraph, more than 100 senior civil servants have been studying some of the bards plays, including Henry V, in an attempt to improve their decision-making and leadership skills. 

 The civil servants have taken part in more than 30 different workshops and sessions, also based around Macbeth and Julius Caesar. But the courses have been criticised as a waste of time and money.

 At least 10 permanent secretaries have been on the courses devised by Olivier Mythodrama, a company run by Richard Olivier, the director and youngest son of the late Lord Olivier, Britains most celebrated actor. The programmes are geared towards employees in the more senior grades. 

 The courses have been chosen by the cabinet office and the National School of Government, a body set up to improve civil service training. 

 Participants are asked to study key excerpts from the plays and to explore the motives of the central characters. Each of the plays is studied for different reasons.

 The study of Henry V, which includes his famous once more unto the breach call to arms, will, according to Mythodramas website, enable participants to live their leadership potential to the full by following the journey of King Henry. By contrast, the sessions based on Julius C?sar are all about surviving power struggles at the very top. 

 Macbeth, the Scottish tale of witchcraft, ambition and murder, apparently offers valuable lessons about courageous leadership and ethical ambition.

 Hugo Swire, the Tory culture spokesman, questioned if the expenditure was justifiable at a time when the government was cutting spending on the arts. I would encourage everyone to learn more about the bard, but surely this isnt the best use of taxpayers money.

 Olivier admitted that some of the participants were sceptics but claimed everyone benefited. I think Henry V strikes a chord with civil servants in particular, he said. 

 These are people who are enormously skilled but earn far less than they could in the private sector. The course helps them reconnect with their sense of service.

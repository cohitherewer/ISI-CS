 wasnt his because he stole it. 

 Bradley Robison was charged with possession of marijuana with intent to deliver and failure to affix a drug tax stamp. Robison said he had stolen it from a nearby business that he had just broken into, but the court said it doesnt matter how he got the marijuana only that he had it.

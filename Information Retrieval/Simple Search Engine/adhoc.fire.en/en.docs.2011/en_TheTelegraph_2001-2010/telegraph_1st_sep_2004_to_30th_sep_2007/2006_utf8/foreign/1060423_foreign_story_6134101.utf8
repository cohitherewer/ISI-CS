 Begum Ali ruffles Pervez feathers

President Musharraf: Cross-connection 

 Karachi, April 22: President Pervez Musharraf, has tussled with Islamist terrorists, fundamentalist mullahs and liberal intellectuals in the struggle to shape Pakistans identity.

 But he is now facing an altogether different foe: the cross-dressing son of a retired colonel.

 Ali Salim, 27, has shot to fame as the most famous television personality in the predominantly Muslim, male-dominated country by donning a silk sari and adopting the alter ego of a flirtatious widow hosting a chat show. 

 Such is the popularity of Late Night Show With Begum Nawazish Ali, that Pakistans military leadership has threatened to take the programme off air. 

 The Begum has ruffled feathers in a country where, despite the existence of a marginalised group of transsexuals that performs at weddings and birth blessings, cross-dressing is generally frowned upon.

 We decided to create a larger-than-life character to host a talk show where the host would be flirtatious and look good so she would be on a strong footing with her guests, said Salim.

 Posing controversial questions that journalists routinely steer clear of, Pakistans Dame Edna Everage tackles taboos as a routine.

 He questions prominent Islamic religious figures, celebrities and politicians on issues such as Pakistans support for the US-led war on terror, Musharrafs dictatorship and discrimination against women.

 Ever since I was a child I used to fantasise about growing up to be a woman, he said over lunch yesterday in Karachi, where the programme is recorded. My friends all said that I am like a 60-year old woman. I am a woman in a mans body. 

 Articulate and theatrical, Saleems earrings, waxed forearms and plucked eyebrows were offset by a days growth of stubble on his chin. 

 In private he eschews his characters low-necked chiffon robes, preferring a T-shirt and jeans. 

 A rarity in Pakistan for his openness, Salim describes himself as a bisexual.

 He first earned a name impersonating former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, and then added Margaret Thatcher, the late Diana, Princess of Wales and Noor Jehan, the actor who inspired the Begums 1970s sartorial style.

 His mother, a former government official and his father, a polo-playing army officer, both applaud his success.

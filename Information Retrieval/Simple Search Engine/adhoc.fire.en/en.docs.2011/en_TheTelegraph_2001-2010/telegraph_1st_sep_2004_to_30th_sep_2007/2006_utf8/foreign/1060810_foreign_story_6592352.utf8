 Tigers lift water siege, no end to violence

 Trincomalee (Lanka), Aug. 9 (Reuters): Water flowed to thousands of farmers in east Sri Lanka for the first time in three weeks today after Tamil Tiger rebels lifted a blockade, but there was no end to the worst fighting since a 2002 truce.

 The army fired rockets towards Tamil Tiger positions before dawn, 15 days after jets first dropped bombs on rebel areas in a bid to wrest control a disputed sluice. The rebels said air force jets again bombed their territory.

 Water is flowing. The water level has risen 2 metres high. That indicates there wont be a problem of water for those villagers and farmers, said Major Upali Rajapakse, senior coordinator at the media centre for national security.

 The humanitarian operation conducted by the security forces has achieved success, he said. 

 The islands defence secretary said it was too early to say if the military campaign was nearly over. The Tigers had vowed to reopen the waterway on Sunday, but the government replied with renewed artillery fire.

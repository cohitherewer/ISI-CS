The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Economy can survive for months

 Kathmandu, April 19 (Reuters): Nepals economy can hold out for months even if it is isolated by donors and allies angered by King Gyanendras crackdown on a pro-democracy campaign, the World Bank representative to the country said today.

 Although the economy was suffering a lot of strain from a two-week strike in the campaign by a seven-party alliance for the restoration of democracy, it had foreign exchange reserves of about $1.5 billion, equivalent to the full annual budget, said Ken-ichi Ohashi, the banks Nepal country director.

 How long has Burma (Myanmar) survived? he said. I think evidence is pretty clear that if a country decides to endure some hardship, the economy just doesnt collapse very easily.

 And especially the Nepali economy, its so well integrated into the Indian economy that its not going to collapse.

 India slapped a partial trade blockade on Nepal in the late 1980s following political differences, but it had only a limited impact even though it lasted for several months.

 If India plays hardball, India can put pressure, Ohashi said. But the pressure is only through essentially making everybodys life miserable.

 YouTube faces UTube anger

 Toledo (Ohio), Nov. 2 (AP): 

 A company that shut down its website because it was overwhelmed 

 by millions of people looking for YouTube has sued the online 

 video-sharing portal.

 Universal Tube amp; Rollform Equipment Corp. said the cost of hosting its website www.utube.com has grown significantly in the last two months. Weve had to move our site five times in an effort to stay ahead of the www.youtube.com visitors, said Ralph Girkins, Universal Tubes president. The lawsuit, filed this week in a US court, asks that YouTube Inc. stop using the youtube.com or pay Universal Tubes cost for creating a new domain.

 The confusion took off a couple of months ago, Girkins said. The company, with just 17 employees, got 68 million hits on its site in August, making it one of the most popular manufacturing websites.

 The site shut down in early October just before Google Inc. announced plans to buy YouTube for $1.65 billion. It took several days before it was back up. A YouTube spokeswoman did not return a message seeking comment.

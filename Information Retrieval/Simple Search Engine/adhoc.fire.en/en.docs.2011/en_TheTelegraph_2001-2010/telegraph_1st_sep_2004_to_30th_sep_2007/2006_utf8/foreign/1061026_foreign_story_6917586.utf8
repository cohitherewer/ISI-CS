 Madonna surprised by adoption controversy

 Madonna: Davids story

 New York, Oct. 25: Madonna has spoken publicly about her adoption of an Malawian boy, saying she never expected it to provoke such controversy. 

 In her first television interview since her adoption of 13-month-old David, the singer told the American chat show host Oprah Winfrey that she had acted according to the law.

 She also expressed surprise that the boys father did not understand the full impact of the adoption process and believed his child would return home after finishing school. An audience member on Oprah said that Madonna believed that the media frenzy surrounding the adoption had prompted Yohane Banda to change his story. 

 Madonna was reported to have said: He looked at me straight in the eye and said: Im thankful for giving my son a future and a life because if he stayed with me, I would have buried him. 

 She also told the audience that she planned to visit Malawi once or twice a year with David. 

 The singers appearance on the chat show came as Bande said he would not fight the adoption because he believed his son would have a better life with Madonna.

 In an interview with Time magazine, he said: I dont want my child, who is already gone to come back. I will be killing his future if I accept that. But he reiterated his earlier claim that he did not realise that he was giving up his child for good. 

 I am not educated so the way I was told, I thought it would be the same as keeping him at the orphanage, the only difference being that he will be kept by a rich, respectable lady, he said.

 I never understood it as my child being taken for good. He added: What I was told is that good Samaritans want to help raise my son by sending him to school and looking after him. When he finishes school he will come back home to stay with us.

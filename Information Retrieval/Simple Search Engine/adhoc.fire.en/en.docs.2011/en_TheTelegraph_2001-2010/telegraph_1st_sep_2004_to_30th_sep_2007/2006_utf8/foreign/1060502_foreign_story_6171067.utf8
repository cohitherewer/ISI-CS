 US immigrant strike begins

 Washington, May 1 (Reuters): A one-day nationwide strike and business boycott gathered steam today to demand legal rights for millions of illegal immigrants, with many US businesses shutting down voluntarily to avoid disruption.

 Early reports suggested many of the estimated 11.5-12 million illegal immigrants in the country were staying away from work, despite a mixed message from immigrant-rights organisations, some of which opposed the action.

 In New Yorks Union Square, the normally bustling open-air market operated at a fraction of its typical activity. Cheap, immigrant-run buses services from New Jersey to the city were not running.

 Demonstrators formed human chains at several points around the city. Hundreds, including schoolchildren, lined up in Queens, stretching for three blocks on both sides of the street waving US and Latin American flags and banners saying: We are Americans and Full Rights for All Immigrants.

 Everyones an immigrant here. The only real American is the Indian, said Puerto Rican-born Rene Ochart, a doorman at the posh Hotel Pierre in Manhattans Upper East Side, who was working as usual.

 A bill passed by the House of Representatives in December that would make all illegal immigrants into felons provoked a mass protest movement, bringing people who previously worked and lived in the shadows of US society into the streets.

 Across the country, several major meat-packing plants were closed but operators had tried to prepare for the shutdown by stepping up production over the weekend.

 Fast food company McDonalds Corp. said some of its restaurants were operating for shorter hours or drive-thru service only. The National Association of Chain Restaurants said the boycott could hurt its members.

 Unfortunately, these work boycotts have the potential to handcuff the very businesses that have worked so hard for immigration reform, said association spokesman Scott Vinson. 

 Wage and labour expert Oren Levin-Waldman of the Metropolitan College of New York said the main impact would be to inconvenience people but a one-day protest would have little economic effect despite the major role played by immigrants in the economy.

 Recent polls suggest a majority of Americans would support legislation being debated in the Senate that would allow many illegal immigrants to join a legal guest worker programme.

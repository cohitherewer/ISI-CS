 Rice, on Straw date, gets cold reception

 Blackburn (England), March 31 (Reuters): Local Muslims and anti-war activists told US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice to Go Home when British counterpart Jack Straw led her on a tour of his home town today.

 Around 250 protesters gathered outside a school which Rice visited, waving placards and shouting as her motorcade arrived during a rare visit to the area by an overseas politician.

 Many of them were locals from Straws constituency of Blackburn, a former cotton town in the industrial northwest with a 20 per cent Muslim population. Straw invited Rice to the area after he toured her home state of Alabama last year.

 The trip has been unpopular among some Muslims and Left-wing activists, who have already persuaded a mosque in the town to withdraw its invitation to her.

 The Muslim population is very angry. Shes not welcome in Blackburn, said Suliman, one of the demonstrators outside Pleckgate school, where Rice met young pupils.

 My message to Rice and Straw is that they should get all their troops out of Iraq and Afghanistan, said the 61-year-old Muslim, who declined to give his surname.

 How many lives per gallon? asked one of the placards held aloft, in reference to the US invasion of oil-rich Iraq which many Britons opposed.

 Rice played down the protests, saying everyone had the right to vent their feelings.

 I would say to those who wish to protest: By all means, she said during a visit to a British Aerospace factory on the outskirts of the town. Ive seen it in every city Ive visited in the US. Im not surprised. People have strong views.

 Rice also visited the English Premier League team Blackburn Rovers soccer stadium. She will later travel to Liverpool, where she will attend a concert and visit a performing arts centre founded by former Beatle Paul McCartney.

 Rice arrived in Britain late yesterday from Paris and, before that, Berlin, where she discussed the next steps in dealing with Irans nuclear programme with officials from Germany, France, Britain, Russia and China.

 The talks come a day after the UN Security Council issued a presidential statement urging Iran to freeze its uranium enrichment programme, which can produce fuel for atom bombs.

 Rices trip is expected to be heavy on photo opportunities and light on discussion, as was Straws trip to the American south in October.

 Among other things, it will give Rice a chance to indulge her passion for The Beatles. Not only is she visiting the bands home city, she is also touring the town which inspired one of their more curious lyrics.

 I read the news today, oh boy. 4,000 holes in Blackburn, Lancashire, run the words from the song A Day in the Life. John Lennon wrote the words after seeing a newspaper headline about the poor state of roads in Blackburn.

 I never understood that Beatles song, Rice said earlier this month when asked about her trip. Perhaps now Ill get the chance.

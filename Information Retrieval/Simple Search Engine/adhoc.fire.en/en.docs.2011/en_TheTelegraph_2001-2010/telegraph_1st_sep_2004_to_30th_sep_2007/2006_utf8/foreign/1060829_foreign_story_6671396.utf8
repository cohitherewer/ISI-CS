 UK: Extradite Pak suspect

 Tasnim Aslam: Under consideration

 Islamabad, Aug. 28 (Reuters): Britain has requested the extradition of a Briton of Pakistani descent who was arrested in Pakistan this month on suspicion of involvement in a plot to bomb airliners over the Atlantic, Pakistan said today.

 Yes, they have sought his extradition and the matter is under consideration, Pakistani foreign ministry spokeswoman Tasnim Aslam said, referring to the suspect, Rashid Rauf.

 A British High Commission spokesman confirmed that a request for the extradition of Rauf, who is a dual Pakistani-British national, had been submitted, but said it was in connection with a murder inquiry.

 The spokesman, Aiden Liddle, referred to news reports that Rauf had left Britain and travelled to Pakistan in 2002 after the murder in Britain of an uncle.

 Weve requested his extradition in connection with that investigation, Liddle said.

 A spokesman for Britains Home Office (interior ministry) declined to comment on whether the extradition request had any link to the bomb plot inquiry.

 British police said on August 10 they had foiled a major plot to carry out suicide bombings on aircraft bound for the US and were questioning more than 20 suspects.

 7 years in prison for UK cleric

 London, Feb. 7 (Reuters): The British Muslim cleric whose north London mosque figured in some of the most important terrorism cases of the last decade was sentenced to seven years today for charges including inciting murder.

 Egyptian-born Abu Hamza al-Masri was convicted on 11 counts, also including stirring up racial hatred in his sermons and possessing a handbook of use to terrorists. The judge sentenced him to serve all 11 sentences concurrently, the longest of which was seven years. He could have faced life. 

 The incitement to murder charges stemmed from sermons he delivered to his followers, mostly in the late 1990s, when his Finsbury Park mosque in north London was seen as a hotbed of radicalism, attracting followers from all over Europe.

 Hamza, who lost both hands and an eye in Afghanistan, is still wanted by the US on charges of trying to set up a terrorist training camp in the state of Oregon.

 The Finsbury Park mosque helped earn the British capital the nickname Londonistan among European security services who felt Britain was too tolerant towards radical Muslim clerics.

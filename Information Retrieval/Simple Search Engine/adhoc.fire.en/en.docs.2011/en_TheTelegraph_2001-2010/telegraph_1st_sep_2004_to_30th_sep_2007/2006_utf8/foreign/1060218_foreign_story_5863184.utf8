 Presley marries

 Los Angeles, Feb. 16 (Reuters): The late king of rock roll has gained a new son-in-law.

 Singer Lisa Marie Presley, the only child of Elvis, has married her guitarist, Michael Lockwood, a collaborator on her 2005 album Now What, in a wedding held last month in Kyoto, Japan, her spokesman said yesterday. 

 The couple exchanged vows in a traditional Japanese service conducted on January 22, with the brides first husband and close friend, musician Danny Keough, serving as best man.

 It was the fourth trip to the altar for Presley, 38, and came 10 years after her surprise marriage to pop star Michael Jackson ended in divorce. She later married Oscar-winning actor Nicolas Cage. They divorced in 2004.

 Unlucky 17

 Turin, Italy (AP): Its Italys Friday the 13th. The 17th in Italy is the equivalent of that bad luck day known to many cultures, and it is accompanied by the usual superstitions. Curve no. 17 on the treacherous Olympic bobsled track in Cesana is the only turn without a nickname for that reason. I dont think 17 brings a lot of bad luck, said private security guard Francesco Trama. As long as its not Friday 17. Well, actually it is. Oh my god! I forgot, it is Friday 17, why did you remind me? Trama, a Naples native, always carries a small golden horn, a common lucky charm in southern Italy, and says he is likely to hold onto it tight in the next 24 hours.

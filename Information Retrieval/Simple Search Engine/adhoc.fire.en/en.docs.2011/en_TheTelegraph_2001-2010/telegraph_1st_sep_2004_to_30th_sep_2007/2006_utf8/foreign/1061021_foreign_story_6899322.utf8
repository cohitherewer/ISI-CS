 Morse saviour

 London, Oct. 20 (Reuters): Morse code, the dots and dashes signalling system first used at sea on the Titanic, made a comeback this week in the rescue of a stranded fisherman.

 The man had run aground near Hayling Island on the south coast when his boat began taking on water. He had no modern safety aids and no phone but it was dark and he did have a torch. Using that, he managed to communicate the S..S. distress message to the coast guard rescue officer Steve Mann.

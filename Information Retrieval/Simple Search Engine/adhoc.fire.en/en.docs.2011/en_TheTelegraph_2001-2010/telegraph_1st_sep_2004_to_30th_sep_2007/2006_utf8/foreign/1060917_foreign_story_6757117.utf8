 Kate tries to juggle kids, making films

 Winslet: Not a period babe

 Toronto, Sept. 16 (Reuters): Movie making is competing with being a mother for actress Kate Winslet, who finds it strange to spend even three days away from her kids to attend the Toronto film festival.

 Winslet, who plays key roles in two of the festivals most talked-about movies, described balancing motherhood and work as her biggest achievement of the year.

 It is a lot to pull off, keep everybody settled and do my job as well as I can, but most importantly being the best parent that I can, Winslet, who has a 2-year old son and a 6-year old daughter, said in an interview.

 We go everywhere together with the kids and I am very rarely away from them. Even to be here for three nights, its weird because I just dont do that.

 Winslet plays a southern belle who has an affair with the Louisiana governor in Steven Zaillians new movie, All the Kings Men. In Little Children, directed by Todd Field, she plays a suburban mom, Sarah, who also has an affair as she tries desperately to find happiness and herself.

 It was very, very challenging and hard for me to separate myself from my own life and my own feelings as a mother and my own instincts as a parent and to be this character here, who isnt a good mother at all, and quite selfish in a way, she said of the Little Children role.

 On the surface she is quite weak-willed too, which I am not, I am quite strong.

 Her pointy black boots were cast aside and the drapes in the hotel room closed as she took on countless interviews.

 The two movies are a departure from Winslets previous roles as a period babe in movies like Sense and Sensibility and Hamlet as well as her role as Rose in Titanic.

 She said she considers herself very lucky not to have to work 48 weeks a year.

 I am taking a year off now, just to see the children and I am going to do that more and more now, so I do have very big gaps in my working schedule, where I switch off and I am just a parent, she said.

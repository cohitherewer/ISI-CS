 Rape row cleric ill

 Canberra, Oct. 30 (Reuters): Australias top Muslim cleric, under a cloud after comparing unveiled women to uncovered meat, was hospitalised today as the countrys Prime Minister warned his comments may lead to vilification of other Muslims.

 Sheikh Taj El-Din Hamid Hilaly, the mufti of Australias biggest mosque in Sydney, angered community and political leaders and divided Australias 280,000 Muslims over the comments, made in a Ramadan sermon a month ago but only reported last week.

 In a separate speech reported today, Hilaly praised jihadist militants fighting US-led coalition forces in Afghanistan and Iraq, but condemned terrorist attacks against civilians in New York, London and Madrid.

 Lebanese-Australian Muslim leaders sought to meet Hilaly today to discuss resignation from his self-appointed position, but the cleric was hospitalised before the meeting began. Lebanese Muslim Association spokesman Tom Zreika refused to confirm reports Hilaly fainted inside the Lakemba mosque.

 Prime Minister John Howard urged Muslim leaders to act quickly and drop Hilaly, who once described Howard, President George W. Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair as the real axis of evil.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Long slog stares at Britons

 London, May 21 (Reuters): Britain confirmed on Sunday that its standard retirement age will have to rise as it struggles to meet a huge pension deficit but said the increase from the current age of 65 would be introduced gradually.

 Speaking days before the government releases long-awaited proposals to reform the pension system, work and pensions secretary John Hutton said people would have to work longer.

 It is inevitable that the state pension age is going to have to rise, he told the BBCs Sunday AM television programme. I think its going to have to rise... but even if it does go up it will be gradual.

 He described the governments imminent proposals as probably the biggest shakeup of the pensions system since the Atlee government (in the late 1940s). Its certainly of that magnitude.

 Like many European countries, Britain faces a pension time bomb as its population ages.

 Employers, facing rising costs, have been closing traditional, relatively generous pension schemes in favour of schemes in which the employee carries more of the investment risk.

 If nothing is done to tackle an estimated ?57-billion pension shortfall, many Britons may be dependent on means-tested state handouts when they retire.

 In its proposals, the government is expected to draw on the ideas of a panel of experts headed by Adair Turner, who called for higher state spending on pensions coupled with a new National Pensions Savings Scheme (NPSS) to which workers would contribute.

 Turner called for the state retirement age to be raised at least to 67 from 65, and recommended that all employees be automatically enrolled into private pension schemes or the NPSS.

 In a report published on Sunday, The House of Commons Treasury Committee warned the government that if the NPSS is to succeed, it must be simple and cheap to run.

 Committee chairman John McFall, a member of parliament for the ruling Labour Party, said he believed an annual management fee of 0.3 per cent of funds under NPSS control ? the maximum which Turner said the NPSS should aim for ? would be highly desirable.

 It ties in with our thinking that we want the maximum returns for people for their pensions, he said in a telephone interview.

 Economists expect this weeks government pension proposals to focus on changes to the state pension system, rather than private schemes. 

 They expect the government to back the controversial NPSS proposal but say details may take longer to emerge.

 The Association of British Insurers, an industry lobby group, disagreed with the Treasury Committees contention that allowing employees to choose a pension plan provider would probably mean more regulation and push up costs.

 Survivors seek hijack damages

 Neerja: Courageous

 Washington, April 8 (AFP): Passengers and relatives of victims of a 1986 hijacking in Pakistan on Wednesday registered a lawsuit demanding $10 billion in damages against Libya and the hijackers.

 The action was filed on behalf of 176 passengers and families of some of the 20 people killed in the hijacking of Pan Am flight 73 at Karachi airport by the Abu Nidal group on September 5, 1986. The suit demands damages from Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, the Libyan government and the five Abu Nidal hijackers.

 During a terrifying 16-hour hostage ordeal, one Pakistani-American was shot dead in front of passengers and his body dumped on the tarmac. 

 Senior flight purser Neerja Bhanot hid the passports of the passengers so that the hijackers could not differentiate between American and non-American citizens. She was killed while shielding three children from the bullets fired by the terrorists.

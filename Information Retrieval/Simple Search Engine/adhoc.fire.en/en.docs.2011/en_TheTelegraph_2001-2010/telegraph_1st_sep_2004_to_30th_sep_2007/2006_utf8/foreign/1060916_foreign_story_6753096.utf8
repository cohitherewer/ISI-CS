 Website rejects link to Montreal shooting

 Toronto, Sept. 15 (Reuters): The website used by the angel of death gunman who killed one and wounded 19 at a Montreal college on Wednesday claims 600,000 members and millions of page hits a day, and says its wrong to link it to the bloody shooting spree.

 Just because someone goes around shooting people and happens to be a member of vampirefreaks, doesnt mean that this website has influenced him to do such a horrible thing, said a new posting by Jet, the founder of the black and purple website, www.vampirefreaks.com.

 The Goth scene is a very friendly, nurturing, non-violent community and we are very supportive of our users and do not condone any illegal activities, he added.

 The Montreal gunman, 25-year-old Kimveer Gill, had posted graphic photographs and comments on the website.

 Attack foiled

 Two 17-year-olds in Green Bay, Wisconsin, were arrested yesterday after an officer at their school learned that they had homemade bombs and weapons at their homes. 

 They were suspected of plotting a shooting spree at the school.

 Blair faces quit calls

 London, March 20 (Reuters): British Prime Minister Tony Blair faced growing pressure today to step down over a sleaze row which has tarnished his reputation and boosted calls for finance minister Gordon Brown to take the reins.

 The cash for favours row blew up after it was disclosed that rich businessmen had been nominated for seats in the upper house of parliament after lending the Labour party large sums to bankroll its 2005 election campaign.

 Right-leaning newspapers have been clamouring for Blair to go for days, but today the Guardian, long seen as the institutional voice of the Centre-Left, joined the chorus. Nine years is long enough, it said in an editorial. There is no excuse for foot-dragging, no excuse for trading on the patience of his party, the country or his successor.

 Blairs spokesman brushed off speculation about the future of the Prime Minister, who has been dubbed Teflon Tony for surviving past political fallout unscathed.

 The prime ministers concentrated on getting on with the job, and he will, the spokesman said.

 Most big political parties in Britain depend on loans and Blair did not break any law by not declaring them. Under current rules only donations to parties have to be made public. But what irks some Labour lawmakers is that their party treasurer and some senior ministers did not know about the ?14 million received, fuelling allegations that Blairs inner circle was running a secret slush fund.

 Blair has said he will not fight a fourth election, due by mid-2010. He won a third term last May but saw his majority slashed.

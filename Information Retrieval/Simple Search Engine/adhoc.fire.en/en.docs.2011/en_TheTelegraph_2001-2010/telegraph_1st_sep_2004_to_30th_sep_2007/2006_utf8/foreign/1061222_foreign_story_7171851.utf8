 Dhaka, Dec. 21 (Reuters): Troops and riot police fought pitched battles with protesters in Bangladesh today as a strike aimed at forcing electoral reforms turned violent.

 Witnesses said at least 25 people were wounded in the clashes that broke out in several areas of Dhaka, which was thrown into chaos by the strike along with business and transport across the country.

 More than 100 people were also injured in fighting between strikers and police outside the capital.

 The protest was called by a 14-party alliance, led by former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, to force the interim government to implement reforms ahead of a general election set for next month.

 In Dhaka, troops in armoured cars patrolled the streets, chasing down protesters and rounding them up. Police also fired tear gas and rubber bullets at activists who had set a police car ablaze in the Shyamoli residential area, witnesses said.

 The interim government had put the army on standby earlier this month, despite criticism by the Hasina-led alliance. They (army) are out in full force... (they) chased away violent activists, training guns at them, a Reuters cameraman said.

 An EU observation mission said there was still hope for a credible election next month. 

 I believe if all political parties ... work responsibly towards a genuine election, there is still hope for the reflection of the peoples will, Alexander Graf Lambsdorff, the European Commission team head said in Dhaka.

 Outside Dhaka, activists damaged more than 50 vehicles and rickshaws, halted trains and barricaded roads. The Chittagong seaport and several landports stood idle, while universities, schools and the Dhaka and Chittagong stock exchanges were closed.

 Mohammad Nasim, a senior Awami leader and former home (interior) minister, urged the interim government not to use the army to suppress peoples democratic rights and privileges.

 Our army is a patriotic force, defends the country and works to establish peace world over. Do not pitch them against people fighting for democracy and rights, Nasim told a protest rally.

 The disputed election is set for January 22, but Hasina has asked for a delay to allow time for campaigning and to prepare a flawless voters list as well as issue voter identity cards. Hasinas alliance also wants President Iajuddin Ahmed, head of the caretaker government, to resign, accusing him of bias. 

 A congenial atmosphere for a free and fair election does not exist in the country now, Hasina told the EU officials.

 Yesterday, Hasina rejected as insufficient a government move to give a holiday to one election commissioner, who is among several she accuses of bias towards her rival, Begum Khaleda Zia.

 New life in old heart

 London, 

 April 13 (Reuters): A British girl is thought to 

 have become the first heart transplant patient in the UK 

 and possibly the world to have had her donor organ removed 

 and her own heart re-started, a London hospital said today.

 Hannah Clark from south Wales had a heterotopic transplant operation ? known as a piggyback because the donor heart is placed next to the original organ ? 10 years ago.

 However, complications arose after 

 her body recently started reacting badly to the drugs she 

 had to take to stop her body rejecting the new heart and 

 surgeons took the decision to remove the donor organ. We 

 discovered that actually her old heart was now working quite 

 well, said a spokesman from Londons Great Ormond 

 Street Hospital for Children.

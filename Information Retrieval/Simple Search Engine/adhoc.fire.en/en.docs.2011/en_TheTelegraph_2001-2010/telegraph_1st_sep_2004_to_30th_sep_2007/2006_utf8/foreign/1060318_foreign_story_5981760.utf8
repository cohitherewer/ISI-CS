 Milosevic death cause not poison

 The Hague, March 17 (Reuters): The UN war crimes tribunal said today initial results of blood tests showed no sign that Slobodan Milosevics death by heart attack was caused by poisoning, but key questions over earlier tests remained.

 Milosevic, who died in jail last Saturday, had suffered from high blood pressure and a heart condition.

 But speculation grew over whether Milosevic had deliberately tried to exacerbate his condition or whether he had been poisoned, as the 64-year-old suggested in a letter addressed to Moscow the day before he died. So far no indications of poisoning have been found, Judge Fausto Pocar, president of the UN war crimes tribunal, said.

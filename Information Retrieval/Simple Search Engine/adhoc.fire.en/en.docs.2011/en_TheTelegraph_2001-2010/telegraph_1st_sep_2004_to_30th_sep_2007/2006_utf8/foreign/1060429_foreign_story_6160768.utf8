 - Tehran remains defiant

 Vienna, April 28 (Reuters): The worlds nuclear watchdog said in a report circulated today that Iran has ignored a UN Security Council call to suspend all nuclear fuel enrichment and has accelerated the programme.

 The report, which diplomats passed to Reuters, was sent to the Security Council which could eventually impose sanctions on Iran. Tehran has said its enrichment policy is irreversible. It has vowed to withstand any consequences, whether financial penalties or military attack. Iranian officials were not immediately available for comment.

 However, hours before details of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) report emerged, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said Iran would pay no heed to any UN measure designed to rein in its nuclear programme. Those who want to prevent Iranians from obtaining their right, should know that we do not give a damn about such resolutions, he told a rally in northwest Iran.

 President George W. Bush said he wanted peaceful persuasion to prevail. Its very important for the Iranians to understand there is a common desire by a lot of nations in this world to convince them, peacefully convince them, that they ought to give up their weapons ambitions, Bush said.

 The IAEA report confirmed that Iran had flouted the Security Councils demands. Iran was supposed to suspend, but since they continue to do experiments, they have not suspended enrichment efforts, said a senior official close to the IAEA.

 The IAEA also said Iran had done little during a 30-day grace period to answer questions meant to determine whether its nuclear programme is purely civilian.

 The report said IAEA tests confirmed Irans claim this month to have enriched uranium with a cascade of 164 centrifuges to the low level needed to fuel nuclear power plants. It must be purified to a much higher level for bomb-making.

 Iran was also building two new cascades of 164 centrifuges at its underground enrichment plant.

 Diplomats said questions persisted over Iranian research on advanced P-2 centrifuges, documents on how to design an atomic bomb core, and intelligence reports of links between uranium ore processing, high-explosives tests and a missile warhead design.

 Mark Fitzpatrick, nuclear analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, said interest in IAEA chief Mohamed ElBaradeis report focused on how it assessed Irans claims to rapid progress toward mastering the enrichment process.

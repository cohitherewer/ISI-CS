 Militant attack in Somalia

 Baidoa (Somalia), Sept. 18 (Reuters): A car bomb killed five people and wounded several others outside parliament in Somalias provincial capital Baidoa today in an assassination attempt on President Abdullahi Yusuf.

 Six attackers were killed in a gunbattle with Yusufs bodyguards after the explosion, which took place as lawmakers approved a new cabinet, Foreign Minister Ismail Hurre Buba said.

 A car exploded when the presidents convoy was passing on the way to his residence, Hurre said. It was an assassination attempt on the President.

 Yusuf escaped unharmed, but Hurre said five people were killed in the blast he said bore the hallmarks of al Qaida.

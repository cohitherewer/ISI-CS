 UN debates Iran nuke fate

 Vienna, Feb. 2 (Reuters): The UN nuclear watchdog chief said today the nuclear dispute with Iran was at a critical phase as his agency discussed reporting Tehran to the UN Security Council over fears it is seeking atomic bombs.

 But US and EU leaders, in a nod to Russian, Chinese and developing world concern not to provoke Iran, said Security Council involvement did not mean an end to diplomacy or that Tehran would eventually face punitive sanctions.

 Diplomats forecast passage of a resolution, agreed by the councils five permanent members, to send Irans case to New York. Tehran threatened to respond by halting UN spot checks of its atomic sites and pursuing wide-scale uranium enrichment.

 We are reaching a critical phase but it is not a crisis situation. Its about confidence-building and it is not about an imminent threat, International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) director-general Mohamed ElBaradei said.

 He said the IAEA emergency session was about pressing Iran to resolve doubts about its nuclear intentions before a conclusive report he will make to the March 6 meeting. ElBaradei emphasised that even countries advocating referral were not asking the Security Council to take immediate action.

 The US and its European allies persuaded Russia and China this week to back reporting Iran to the council after Tehran stripped IAEA seals from nuclear equipment on January 9. That broke a two and a half-year moratorium on atomic development activity agreed with three leading EU powers.

 But the rare show of unity emerged only after Washington and the EU trio of Britain, France and Germany agreed the council would not act against Iran until after the IAEAs director reports to the agencys regular meeting on March 6. 

 This would allow time for Russia and Iran to work on details of Moscows offer to purify uranium for Tehran, a joint venture aimed at preventing diversion of nuclear fuel to bomb-making.

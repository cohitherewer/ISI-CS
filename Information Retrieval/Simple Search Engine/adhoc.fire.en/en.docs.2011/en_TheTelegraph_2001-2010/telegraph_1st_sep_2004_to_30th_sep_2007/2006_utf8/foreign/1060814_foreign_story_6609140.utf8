 Havana, Aug. 13 (AP): On his 80th birthday, Fidel Castro cautioned Cubans he faced a long recovery from surgery and advised them to prepare for adverse news, but urged them to stay optimistic, while a newspaper published the first photographs of the Cuban leader since his illness.

 Castro, whose illness forced him to step aside as President two weeks ago, said his health had improved, but warned he still faced risks.

 I feel very happy, said a statement attributed to Castro in the Juventud Rebelde newspaper. For all those who care about my health, I promise to fight for it.

 In the photos, Castro wears a red and white Adidas warm-up suit, looks a bit tired but is sitting up straight, his eyes alert. One is a tight shot of him posing with his fist under his chin and in two he is talking on the telephone.

 The fourth photograph shows him sitting in a chair in front of a bed with a white spread in what appears to be a home. He is holding up a special supplement of Granma, the Communist Party newspaper, published yesterday. 

 The photos were published in the online edition of Juventud Rebelde. It was impossible to confirm the authenticity of the photographs which were credited to Estudios Revolucion, a division of Castros personal support group that collects historic documents and images but there was no reason to doubt their authenticity.

 Juventud Rebelde also published a handwritten note by Castro. In his statement, he said his stability has considerably improved but added: To affirm that the recovery period will take a short time and that there is no risk would be absolutely incorrect.

 I ask you all to be optimistic, 

 and at the same time to be ready to face any adverse news, 

 it added.

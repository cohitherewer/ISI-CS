 Finger at Pak in Blair thesis

 London, Dec. 9: Tony Blair has made an important speech perhaps one of the most important in his nine years as Prime Minister on the future of multicultural Britain in which he has fingered Pakistan, without mentioning the country for the spread of a new and virulent form of ideology associated with a minority of our Muslim community. 

 The context of his wide-ranging lecture: The Duty to Integrate: Shared British Values, delivered yesterday at 10 Downing Street, made it clear that he was referring mainly to British Muslims of Pakistani origin. 

 Britain has 1.6 million Muslims, half of whom are of Pakistani origin and 300,000 of Bangladeshi descent. 

 In contrast, he states the obvious that there is no problem with one million British Hindus. Acknowledging that Britain had dealt with Irish militancy, the Prime Minister said he was now not contributing to a debate on generalised extremism. 

 He said: It is not a problem with Britons of Hindu, Afro-Caribbean, Chinese or Polish origin. Nor is it a problem with the majority of the Muslim community. Most Muslims are proud to be British and Muslim and are thoroughly decent law-abiding citizens. But it is a problem with a minority of that community, particularly originating from certain countries. 

 The majority of British Muslims arrested on terrorism charges have been the UK-born or bred children of immigrants from Pakistan. A handful are of Bangladeshi origin. Nationals from countries seen as the source of terrorism by the Americans Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan hardly figure at all. 

 As Blair recalled: The day after we won the Olympic bid came the terrorist attacks in London. These murders were carried out by British-born suicide bombers who had lived and been brought up in this country, who had received all its many advantages and yet who ultimately took their own lives and the lives of the wholly innocent, in the name of an ideology alien to everything this country stands for. 

 The thrust of Blairs message was that multiculturalism was to be celebrated but not if it encouraged divisions in society. We like our diversity. But how do we react when that difference leads to separation and alienation from the values that define what we hold in common? For the first time in a generation there is an unease, an anxiety, even at points a resentment that our very openness, our willingness to welcome difference, our pride in being home to many cultures, is being used against us; abused, indeed, in order to harm us. 

 He said: The whole point is that multicultural Britain was never supposed to be a celebration of division; but of diversity. The right to be in a multicultural society was always implicitly balanced by a duty to integrate, to be part of Britain, to be British and Asian, British and black, British and white. 

 He announced a number of measures to tackle extremism. In future, grants would not be given to racial or religious groups that did not promote community cohesion and integration. 

 There would be tough action to stop forced marriage again a problem that manifests itself mainly among orthodox Pakistanis although it has also occurred among Indian Punjabis. There can be no defence of forced marriage on cultural or any other grounds, warned Blair. 

 He was not contemplating legislation to tackle the exclusion of women from certain mosques. But he had instructed the Equal Opportunities Commission to produce a report by the spring of next year on how these concerns could be practically addressed. 

 Pointing out that there has been a lot of concern about a minority of visiting preachers, he said that in future where they are recruited internationally, we will require entrants to have a proper command of English and meet the pre-entry qualification requirements. 

 On faith schools and there are concerns about whether Islamic institutions can prepare children for life in modern Britain Blair said that it was important that they teach tolerance and respect for other faiths and the education department will discuss with the faith groups how this is achieved and implemented, according to new national guidelines. 

 We will also encourage all faith schools to construct a bridge to other cultures by twinning with schools from another faith. 

 He added: There can be no excuse for Madrassahs (in Britain) not meeting their legal requirements and they will be enforced vigorously. 

 On foreigners coming into Britain for permanent settlement, he said Britain would include a requirement to pass an English test before such permanent residency is granted. 

 Being British carries rights, commented Blair. It also carries duties. And those duties take clear precedence over any cultural or religious practice. 

 One word not mentioned by Blair was Iraq, given as the reason by many Muslim spokesmen why young British Muslims have been drawn into terrorism.

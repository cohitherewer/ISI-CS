 World Cups united colours in West Asia

 Jerusalem, May 30 (AP): When it comes to the World Cup, Israelis and Palestinians are in full agreement: The price to watch the games on TV is too high.

 In a violence-wracked region where soccer is sacred, fans on both sides are going to great lengths to avoid hefty subscription fees.

 Palestinians plan to watch pirate broadcasts or head to coffee shops to circumvent satellite charges of $600 (euro470), while Israelis have staged a consumer rebellion that has prompted a parliamentary probe and already brought down prices.

 In football, there is no conflict, said Raed Othman, a Palestinian television executive, discussing the universally angry reactions to subscription fees on both sides of the divide. 

 Neither Israel nor the Palestinians qualified for this years World Cup, but soccer fever is clearly in the air. Israeli stores are full of World Cup memorabilia and giveaways, like the 29 shekel (euro3) soccer ball on sale at local McDonalds. In the West Bank, flags of soccer powerhouses like Germany and Brazil flutter from cars and storefronts.

 During the last World Cup in 2002, at the time of a major Israeli military offensive in the West Bank, fighting hit a noticeable lull, as Israeli soldiers halted operations to allow Palestinians to watch games on television.

 Making light of this rare bit of common ground, the Haaretz daily published a cartoon this week showing Israelis scaling the West Bank separation barrier to watch free soccer games with a Palestinian peasant. Were all one family, says one of the Israelis in the cartoon.

 Israelis and Palestinians are far from being the only people forced to pay for World Cup access. Stations in Poland and Italy are charging for some matches. And South Korea announced today that North Korea had asked the south to relay World Cup broadcasts to its reclusive neighbour. In the US, viewers can watch somes games on free network TV. The remainder are available on cable, without extra charges.

 But no other people on earth seem to have the determination and defiance to break the rules. Palestinians are being asked to pay $600 (euro470) to the Saudi-based satellite channel ART, which holds local broadcast rights. Existing subscribers can get World Cup access for euro235.

 Even in normal times, the fee would be excessive for most Palestinian families. But this years World Cup comes at an especially difficult time. International economic sanctions have left the Hamas-led government broke and unable to pay the salaries to its tens of thousands of employees, devastating the economy. I dont know what Im going to do. I cant pay for the subscription because I dont have the money, said Amin Hassan, a 40-year-old civil servant and self-described soccer fanatic.

 Under fire

 Vancouver (British Columbia), Oct. 26 (Reuters): A Canadian city under pressure for alleged sexual harassment within its fire department has ordered firefighters to wear only boxer-style underwear.

 Richmond, British Columbia will spend $14,200 to buy six pairs of underwear for each firefighter in a bid to make firehalls in the suburb of Vancouver more gender neutral.

 We supply firefighters with various pieces of gear such as gloves, now its underwear, an official said. A recent investigation of the department described its workplace culture as characterised by juvenile behaviour towards female firefighters.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 US embassy caught in Bush twins purse row

 Buenos 

 Aires, Nov. 28 (Reuters): The US embassy in Argentina 

 rejected reports that it had told President George W. Bushs 

 twin daughters to leave the country after a widely publicised 

 purse-snatching incident.

 ABC News reported on its website(www.abcnews.go.com) yesterday that embassy officials had strongly suggested that the twins, Jenna and Barbara Bush, cut short their visit to Buenos Aires due to security concerns.

 Argentine officials confirmed last week that one of Bushs daughters had her purse stolen in San Telmo, a neighbourhood popular with tourists. The incident led to teasing by Argentine media about the twins seemingly ineffective Secret Service bodyguards.

 We have seen a report from news sources stating that embassy officials strongly suggested that President Bushs daughters curtail their visit in Argentina, the US embassy said in a written statement.This is false.

 The embassy welcomes the visit and has provided close support and cooperation, the statement read.

 Television footage showed the Bush daughters cheering on Argentinas most popular soccer club, Boca Juniors, on Sunday. The twins marked their 25th birthday in Argentina on Saturday. It was not immediately clear whether they were still in Argentina yesterday.

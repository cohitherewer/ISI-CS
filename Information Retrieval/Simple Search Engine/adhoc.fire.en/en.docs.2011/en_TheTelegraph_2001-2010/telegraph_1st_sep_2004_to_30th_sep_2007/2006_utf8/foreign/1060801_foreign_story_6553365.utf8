 Farrell gets Gong Li alcohol lesson

 Gong Li: Rum thing

 Hong Kong, July 31 (AP): Chinese actress Gong Li said Colin Farrell, her co-star in the movie Miami Vice, taught her how to drink beer but she introduced him to mojitos ? the rum, lime and soda water drink served with a sprig of mint, a Hong Kong newspaper reported yesterday.

 Gong plays the Chinese-Cuban lover of a crime lord in Miami Vice, while Farrell is an undercover detective who has a relationship with her. Miami Vice, which was released in the US earlier this month, reprises the TV cop show of the same name.

 The Chinese actress said Farrell treats everybody well and takes great interest in everyone around him ? not just me, but the crew as well. As a result, its easy to feel relaxed around him, the Sunday Morning Post reported. Gong, 40, said Farrell showed her how to drink beer, while she taught him how to drink mojitos. Mojito is Cubas oldest cocktail and is derived from the word mojo, which means to place a little spell.

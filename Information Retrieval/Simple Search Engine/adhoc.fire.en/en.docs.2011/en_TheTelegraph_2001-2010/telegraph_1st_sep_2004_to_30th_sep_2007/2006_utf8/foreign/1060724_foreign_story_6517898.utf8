The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Options before Tel Aviv and world

 Answers to key questions about the showdown:

 Will Israel launch a major ground invasion?

 Twelve days of air strikes have failed to halt Hizbollah rocket attacks. The army has carried out limited ground operations inside southern Lebanon and massed troops and tanks on the border.

 Israel could launch a massive incursion to drive Hizbollah fighters north of Litani River, 20 km inside Lebanon, but some military officials say it will stop short of a full-scale invasion.

 The longer Israel waits, the more unlikely a major invasion could become as diplomatic efforts to end the war gather pace and pressure grows on Israel over civilian deaths in Lebanon.

 What is happening on the diplomatic front?

 The UN and some European countries want a ceasefire while the US says this would be a mistake without resolving what it sees as the root problem ? removing the threat posed to Israel by Hizbollah. 

 Israel believes it has a green light from Washington to continue its offensive for another week. 

 Israel has signalled support for the deployment of an international peacekeeping force on Lebanons border with Israel. 

 How soon before an international force deploys?

 It could take weeks to mobilise a peacekeeping force that some European diplomats say will require 10,000 men. UN sources said France and Turkey were high on the list for leading such a force.

 What is the end game?

 Israel believes its air and ground campaign has weakened Hizbollah, but it no longer holds out much hope of crushing the group completely. Instead, it hopes to get the international community to try to finish the job ? by deploying a peacekeeping force, putting monitors at border crossings and ports to halt the flow of weapons, and pressuring Syria and Iran to deny it support.

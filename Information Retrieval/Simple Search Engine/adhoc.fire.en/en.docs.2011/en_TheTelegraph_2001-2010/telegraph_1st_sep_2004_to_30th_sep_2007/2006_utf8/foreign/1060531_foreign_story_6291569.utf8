 US treasury secretary resigns

 Washington, May 30 (AP): Treasury secretary John Snow has resigned and will be replaced by Goldman Sachs chairman Henry M. Paulson Jr, a senior administration official said today, in another chapter of a White House shake-up to revive President George W. Bushs troubled presidency.

 Snow, the former head of railroad giant CSX Corp. who has a Ph.D. in economics, has been treasury secretary since February 2003. His departure has been rumoured for more than a year.

 Paulson has been chairman of Goldman Sachs for about eight years. It is considered one of the premier financial firms on Wall Street and has sent a number of its top executives to high positions in Washington.

 Robert Rubin, one of Paulsons predecessors, served as treasury secretary in the Clinton administration, and Jon Corzine, another Goldman Sachs chairman, served as a US senator from New Jersey.

 Pak defers key rape bill

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Islamabad, Sept. 18: The Pakistan government has decided to defer the passing of the Protection of Women Bill (PWR) in the National Assembly till President Pervez Musharraf returns from his US tour at the end of this month.

 The announcement comes after the leading civil rights organisation in Pakistan threatened to launch a protest movement from Wednesday over the repressive bill.

 The bill also faces fierce resistance from the Islamist Opposition. 

 The government had tried to duck a confrontation with the Islamists over the bill to amend laws covering rape and adultery, but changes subsequently proposed by the religious parties proved unpalatable to the ruling Pakistan Muslim Leagues (PML) coalition partners.

 PML chief Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain, who made the announcement at a talk show on the private Geo TV channel, said the government was looking to delay submitting the bill for up to two weeks

 It could be delayed to evolve consensus. We are not backtracking, he said.

 Lacking the numbers to block the bill, the Islamists had instead threatened to resign from parliament and the provincial assemblies in protest, raising fears of a political crisis in Baluchistan and North West Frontier.

 Bullet Cruise

 Tokyo, June 16 (Reuters): Someone had better warn him not to jump on the seats.

 Tom Cruise is hoping to impress his Japanese audience by chartering an entire 1,300-seater high speed bullet train to take 150 fans on a trip from Tokyo to Osaka on Wednesday.

 The train ride is part of the publicity campaign for his latest film Mission: Impossible III.

 But any repeat of the actors couch-jumping episode from the Oprah chat show last year may irritate the Japanese, who are careful to keep their shoes away from upholstery.

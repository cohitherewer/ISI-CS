 Key phase for Mars Orbiter

 Washington, Feb. 25 (Reuters): Nasas Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter is headed into a perilous phase after a seven-month journey from Earth, aiming to start looping around the Red Planet on March 10, space agency officials said yesterday.

 If it manages to reach its planned orbit, a process that will take another seven months, the spacecraft could collect unprecedented data about Earths next-door planetary neighbour, which could help scientists determine where to land the next Mars rovers and even to make preliminary plans for a human landing site.

 Its going to be difficult to get it into orbit, Doug McCuistion, who heads the Nasa Mars Exploration Programme, said.

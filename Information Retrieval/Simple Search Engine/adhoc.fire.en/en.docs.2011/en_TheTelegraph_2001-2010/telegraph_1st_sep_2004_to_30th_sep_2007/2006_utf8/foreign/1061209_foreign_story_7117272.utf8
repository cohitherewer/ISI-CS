 Im-ing gap that splits teens, adults

 Washington, Dec. 8 (AP): Teenager Michelle Rome cannot imagine life without instant messaging. Steve Wilson, in his 50s, does not care that it even exists.

 They are part of an instant messaging gap between teens and adults. And the division is wide, says an AP-AOL survey on how Americans use or snub those Internet bursts of gossip, happy date-making and teen tragedies that young people exchange by the hour.

 Rome, 17, a high school senior, spends more than two hours each day sending and receiving more than 100 instant messages or im-ing.

 I use it to ask questions about homework, make plans with people, keep up with my best friend in Texas and my sister in Connecticut, she said. The 51-year Wilson, a mechanic, prefers using email and the telephone. Instant messaging is the worst of both worlds, he said. It manages to combine all the things I dont like about each. Im more or less a dinosaur. I use the Internet for reading celebrity gossip.

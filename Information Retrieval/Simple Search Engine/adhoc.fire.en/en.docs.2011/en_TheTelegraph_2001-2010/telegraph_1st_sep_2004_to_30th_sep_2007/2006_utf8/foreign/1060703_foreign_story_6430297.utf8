 Dhaka, July 2 (Reuters): Two people were killed and nearly 200 injured in clashes in Bangladesh today as opposition parties enforced a countrywide transport shutdown, police and witnesses said.

 A policeman was killed after being pelted with stones and hit by stick-wielding activists in Sonargaon, 30 km from Dhaka. 

 A 45-year-old man was killed in the capital and 100 people were hurt. The opposition Awami League said the man had been hit by a rubber bullet but police said he was killed in a stampede.

 Police and pro-government activists fought rock-throwing opposition workers and supporters. Police used batons, tear gas and rubber bullets, witnesses said. Fifty activists were held.

 Opposition parties called for a nationwide strike on Tuesday to protest the violence. 

 More than 80 people were injured in other clashes around Bangladesh, one of the worlds poorest countries with a population of 140 million.

 A 14-party alliance led by Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina, a former Prime Minister, had called the transport shutdown to try to force the government to implement electoral reforms before a general election due next January.

 The Opposition wants chief election commissioner M.A. Aziz removed for alleged pro-government bias and a say in choosing a caretaker administration to supervise the polls.

 Sunday is a working day in Bangladesh, and the shutdown stranded millions of commuters. Witnesses said most trains, buses, ferries and other transport were idle as hundreds of Opposition supporters and workers blockaded terminals.

 Dozens of vehicles and a train were damaged as drivers tried to defy the blockade, witnesses said. 

 The Awami League said police provoked violence by using force to break the peaceful blockade.

 The shutdown was total and demonstrated growing public support for our anti-government campaign, said Tofayel Ahmed, a senior Awami leader.

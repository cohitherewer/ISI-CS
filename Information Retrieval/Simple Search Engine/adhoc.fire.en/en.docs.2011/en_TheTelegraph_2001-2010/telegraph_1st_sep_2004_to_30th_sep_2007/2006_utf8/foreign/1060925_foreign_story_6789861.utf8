 US detains Chavez minister

 Sept. 24: Venezuelas foreign minister was detained at a New York airport on Saturday, prompting an apology from the US government and compounding already tense relations between the two countries.

 In New York, state department spokesman Gonzalo Gallegos said the US regretted the incident involving foreign minister Nicolas Maduro at John F. Kennedy airport.

 The United States government apologised to foreign minister Maduro and the Venezuelan government, said Gallegos.

 Venezuelan television said Maduro was stopped for an hour and a half and stripped of his travel documents.

 We denounce the US government for violating international law, Maduro told Venezuelan television from New York, asking UN secretary-general Kofi Annan to condemn his detention.

 The state department said airport security had questioned the foreign minister and then US diplomatic security was sent to the airport to resolve the issue.

 The minister was told he could board the plane before it took off but he chose instead to return to New York City, the state department added.

 This is a provocation from Mr Devil, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez told Venezuelan state television, using a name he called US President George W. Bush at the UN General Assembly this week. Maduro had also been attending the UN meeting.

 Chavez continually accuses Washington of plotting to overthrow and assassinate him, charges the US dismisses.

 Last month, Washington and Caracas had a spat over a diplomatic cargo that Venezuela impounded despite US assurances it was entitled to immunity.

 In a venomous broadside, Chavez has described Bush as a devil, sick man and an alcoholic.

 The comments, to the UN General Assembly, and later away from the podium, were dismissed by US Republicans and Democrats alike as the offensive outpourings of a publicity-hungry demagogue.

 But Chavez had his eye on a different audience and indeed electorate. For Venezuela is making a strong bid to secure one of Latin Americas seats on the UN Security Council.

 That would give his hand-picked envoys the platform to act as champions of an emerging anti-American bloc and undermine efforts by the world body to secure consensus on crises such as Irans nuclear programme.

 The applause and laughter from many diplomats listening to Chavezs General Assembly diatribe indicate that his global aspirations have a strong international constituency.

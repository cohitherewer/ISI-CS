 Hard-partying star off drink

 Lohan: Taking control

 Los Angeles, Dec. 2 (Reuters): Actress Lindsay Lohan, who has been a frequent target of the tabloids for her partying ways, has begun attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, her publicist said yesterday.

 In July, a producer of the film Georgia Rule blamed Lohans hard partying for a series of late arrivals and absences from the set that her spokeswoman said was due to illness. In a 2005 article in Vanity Fair, Lohan admitted to having an eating disorder, but later denied her statements.

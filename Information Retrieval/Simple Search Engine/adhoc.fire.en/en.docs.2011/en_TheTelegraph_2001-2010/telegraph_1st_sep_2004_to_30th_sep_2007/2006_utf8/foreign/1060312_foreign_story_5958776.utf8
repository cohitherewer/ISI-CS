 US port row worsens

 Washington, March 11 (Reuters): The US House of Representatives will forge ahead with a vote on blocking an Arab-owned company from managing US ports, to ensure the firm sheds its US holdings as promised, a leadership spokesman said today.

 The Republican-run Houses refusal to back away from the showdown vote was another blow to President George W. Bush, who suffered a stinging defeat on Thursday when Dubai Ports World said it intended to back out of the deal his administration had approved.

 Reverberations from the political earthquake continued yesterday. The United Arab Emirates suspended talks on a free trade pact with the US, although a spokeswoman for the US Trade Representatives office said delays are common.

 Bush said he was concerned the opposition sent a worrying message to West Asia allies.

 In order to win the war on terror, we have got to strengthen our relationships and friendships with moderate Arab countries in West Asia, Bush told newspaper editors.

 State-owned Dubai Ports World surrendered to unrelenting criticism from both Republicans and Democrats in giving up the management of some terminals at six major US ports.

 The UAE company said it would transfer the ports to a US entity to allay concerns the deal posed a threat to American national security. Details of the transfer were not outlined.

 The White House had hoped the announcement would resolve the unprecedented crisis between Bush and a Congress run by his own party in open revolt.

 But Ron Bonjean, spokesman for House speaker Dennis Hastert, an Illinois Republican, said the House vote on a provision to bar the deal would go ahead on Wednesday or Thursday anyway.

 Its a smart move to keep it (the legislation) in there, in case the Dubai thing doesnt work out, he said.

 The outlook for a Senate vote was less clear. Senate Republican leaders have been trying to avoid one in the near future. 

 Deal critic Senator Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat, wants more information from the White House.

 If things are as they appear, this is a great victory for national security. But make no mistake, we are going to scrutinise this deal with a fine-tooth comb to make sure the separation between American port operators and Dubai Ports World is complete and security is tight as a drum, he said.

 Dubai Ports chairman Sultan Ahmed 

 Bin Sulayem, asked if the firm would sell the US port management 

 rights, said: All this is being worked out by our 

 parties in the States.

 Baby bonus bounces

 Rome, April 22 (Reuters): It all started with a pre-election letter by Italys Prime Minister to more than 600,000 newborns.

 Best wishes for your arrival, do you know that the budget has put aside 1,000 euros for you? Big Kiss. Silvio Berlusconi, read the letter telling the parents of babies born in 2005 how to receive a 1,000 euro baby bonus from the state. Trouble is, the letter was sent in January to all families with a newborn, including immigrants, even though the cash bonus was meant only for Italian babies. 

 The economy ministry is now asking all those who claimed the money but were not entitled to it ? at least 3,000 immigrant families, according to one estimate ? to pay it back. Yesterday, it put out a statement with the bank details for the reimbursement.

 Hostages caught in glue

 Los Angeles (Reuters): A southern California man took two 

men hostage at gunpoint, stripped them naked, bound their hands together with 

super glue and poured glue into their mouths, police said on Friday. Rene Avila, 

36, was arrested early on Friday after releasing his hostages during the night. 

They were treated at the scene and released. The motive behind the bizzare incident 

was unclear but police speculate a possible relationship among the three may have 

triggered Avilas behaviour. There was some kind of dispute there and 

he put super glue in their mouths before calling his sister, Los Angeles 

policeman Ernest Eskridge said. We dont know if that was his cry for 

help.

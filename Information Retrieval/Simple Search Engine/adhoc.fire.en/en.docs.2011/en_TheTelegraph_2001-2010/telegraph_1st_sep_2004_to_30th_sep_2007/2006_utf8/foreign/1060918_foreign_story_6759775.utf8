 Nepal bid to rescue peace drive

 J. HEMANTH

Kathmandu, Sept. 17: In a bid to prevent the 

collapse of the peace process in Nepal, Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala held 

talks with Maoist leader Prachanda and his second-in-command Baburam Bhattarai 

here this evening.

 The two were invited to the Prime Ministers residence amid increased posturing by the Maoists.

 The talks between the administration and the Maoists were deadlocked after the rebels refused to disarm their cadre before the installation of an interim government.

 Sources in the Prime Ministers Office said Koirala ticked off the Maoist leaders for allowing their cadre to have a free run in the Kathmandu Valley, where they were targeting the business community for donations. 

 The disclosure came as the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry announced that it would convene a meeting on the issue.

 The rebel leaders protested against the appointment of General Rukamagat Katuwal as army chief, saying that he is a royalist.

 Adults rule in music charts

 Teen diva matures 

 New York, Dec. 11 

 (AP): Just a few years ago, when teens dominated the pop 

 charts, to be a singer of a more senior age say, about 

 30 was something to be downplayed or outright omitted 

 on ones musical resume.

 Indeed, as the likes of N Sync, Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera posted hit after hit and sold millions and millions of albums, the most coveted part of a performers act seemed to be his or her youth.

 But these days, Justin Timberlake has graduated from N Sync to sexy adult club tracks, Aguilera is a married woman singing mature ballads and it no longer seems necessary to shave a few years off your age. 

 While teen acts like JoJo, Rihanna and Chris Brown are still creating hits, they are no longer ruling the marketplace. 

 Most of this years top-selling artists were in their 20s or 30s, like Gnarls Barkley, Mary J. Blige, James Blunt, Nelly Furtado and Shakira. And oldsters like 60-year-old Barry Manilow and 65-year-old Bob Dylan also had strong sales.

 There has been more product that was clearly adult for the last five to ten years, says Sean Ross, vice- president of music and programming at Edison Media Research, which tracks radio trends.

 Thirty-five-year olds are going to a point where rap is OK and 18-year-olds want more mellow music... Its more like theres nothing galvanising in the centre and that lets everybody see whats in the fringes.

 Still, there may be the rumblings of a teen craze on the horizon. The years biggest-selling album was the soundtrack to the Disney TV movie High School Musical, although it was aimed at the tween set. 

 And a graduate from that film, Vanessa Hudgens, is having some success on radio with her solo debut.

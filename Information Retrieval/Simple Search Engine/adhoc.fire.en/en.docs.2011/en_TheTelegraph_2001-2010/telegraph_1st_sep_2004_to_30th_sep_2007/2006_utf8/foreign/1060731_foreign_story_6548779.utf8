 Fire breaks out on Bond film set

 London, July 30 (Agencies): Fire ripped through the set of the latest James Bond movie, Casino Royale, at Britains Pinewood Studios today, destroying equipment and damaging the building, but no one was believed to be hurt, the fire brigade said.

 In a statement, the studio described the fire as serious and said it did not know how it had started.

 We do not know the extent of the damage to the 007 stage, although it is believed to be significant, it said.

 Filming for Casino Royale had finished and workers had been dismantling the set.

 A spokesman for the fire brigade said some 50 firefighters and eight fire engines were needed to tackle the blaze. Flames had been seen from many miles away but had now been put out, he said.

 He said three workers were known to have been in the studio when the fire broke out.

 Reuters photographs showed the roof covering the stage had caved in and the walls were blackened. Firefighters sprayed the building with foam and water from the ground and from cranes.

 Pinewood Studios, set within a former country estate, has been home to many James Bond films, although in recent years more filming has been done on location to reduce costs.

 The James Bond stage burnt to the ground in an accident in 1984 but it was quickly rebuilt for future films.

 Roads near the studio were briefly shut down but the blaze was contained and no one was hurt.

 The vast 007 stage had been transformed into a replica of Venice, where part of the film is set.

 Casino Royale, due for release in October, will be the first featuring new James Bond actor Daniel Craig.

 There was no report on whether Craig was inside when the fire broke out. He was chosen last year to replace Pierce Brosnan as the British super-spy.

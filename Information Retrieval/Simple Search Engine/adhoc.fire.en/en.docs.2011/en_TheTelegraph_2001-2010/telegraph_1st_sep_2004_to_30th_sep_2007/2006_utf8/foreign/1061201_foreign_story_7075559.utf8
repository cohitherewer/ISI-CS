 Elton harsh words for Howard

 Canberra, Nov. 30 (Reuters): British pop superstar Elton John had a blunt message today for Australian Prime Minister John Howard over his conservative governments ban on gay marriages.

 Up yours! the 59-year old told Australian television when asked what he would say to Howard about the ban. John and his partner David Furnish became one of the first gay couples to tie the knot in Britain in a civil partnership ceremony.

 It was just a commitment I wanted to make because I love him, and vice-versa,, John said in an interview. Howards government is strongly opposed to gay marriage and civil unions which would give gay couples the same legal rights as heterosexual married couples.

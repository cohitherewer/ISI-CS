 EU split on smoking ban

 Brussels, May 30 (Reuters): Most people in the EU support a ban on smoking in offices, shops and some other public places but are divided on whether to prohibit tobacco in restaurants and bars, an EU survey showed today.

 The Eurobarometer poll of 25,000 people in the 25 EU countries said four out of five supported a ban on smoking in their workplaces, in shops and other indoor and outdoor spaces.

 That compared to 56 per cent who supported outlawing smoking in restaurants, and 40 per cent who were in favour of banning it from bars. Responses differed largely from country to country, with only 35 per cent of respondents in the Czech Republic supporting a ban in bars but 88 per cent in favour in Italy.

 Ireland imposed the worlds first nationwide smoking ban in public places in 2004. Sweden bans smoking in restaurants, while Italy and Scotland have outlawed smoking in enclosed public spaces. Many parts of the US have similar bans. 

 The poll, taken last autumn and published on the eve of WHOs World No Tobacco Day, showed that the percentage of people who smoked in the EU had dropped to 33 per cent, seven percentage points fewer than said so in the last report in 2002, when the bloc had 15 members.

 The number of citizens declaring they had never smoked increased by almost five points to 47 per cent, and the percentage of those who had smoked but claimed to have given up also increased, by three points to 22 per cent.

 Seventy-five per cent of those polled thought that second-hand smoking posed a health risk ? 39 per cent said it could cause cancer and 33 per cent believed it could lead to respiratory problems.

 Among people aged 15 to 24, 53 per cent were worried about second-hand smoking.

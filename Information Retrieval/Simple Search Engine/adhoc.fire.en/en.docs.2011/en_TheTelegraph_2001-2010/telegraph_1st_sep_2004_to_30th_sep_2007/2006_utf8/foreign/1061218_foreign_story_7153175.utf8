 Damper on terminal patients death wish 

 Rome, Dec. 17 (Reuters): An Italian court has rejected a request by a paralysed, terminally ill man who wants doctors to take him off life support in a case that has split the predominantly Catholic country, where euthanasia is illegal.

 The pale, listless face of Piergiorgio Welby, 60, who suffers from advanced muscular dystrophy and is confined to bed but is lucid, has become one of the most recognised in Italy.

 Speaking via a computer that interprets his eye movements, Welby has appeared on news programmes and written to Italys President asking to be taken off the respirator that keeps him alive so he can find peace for my tortured and shattered body.

 But in a 15-page verdict underscoring the legal complexity of the case, a Rome judge said that while Welby had a right to have the respirator removed, that right was not concretely safeguarded by Italian law. The judge said doctors could not be ordered to switch off life-support machines. Only politicians and lawmakers could fill the legal vacuum and provide answers to the loneliness and despair of terminally ill patients.

 Euthanasia supporters, who staged pro-Welby vigils in 50 Italian cities, attacked the verdict, while opponents hailed it. Welby, who has been ill for 40 years but has seen his condition worsen recently, can appeal against the ruling. 

 This is a Pontius Pilate verdict, sacrificing the right of those who want to legally put an end to their suffering, said Silvio Viale, a doctor and a member of the Rose in the Fist party, which is part of Romano Prodis Centre-Left government.

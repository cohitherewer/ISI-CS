 Fine Print

 Lottery luck

 London, Jan. 2 (Reuters): The holders of a winning British lottery ticket worth ?9.4 million has just hours left to claim their prize before the money goes to good causes.

 The National Lottery said the ticket with winning numbers 3, 12, 17, 36, 44 and 49 was bought in the Doncaster area in northern England and matched all numbers for the July 6, 2005, National Lottery draw.

 If no one comes forward before the deadline expires, the prize money plus interest accrued will go to various good causes to add to the ?17 billion already raised for them through lottery ticket sales over the last 11 years.

 We would urge everyone to join in the hunt and check any old tickets that they might have; to look through wallets, in the pockets of summer clothing or down the back of the sofa, a lottery spokesperson said.

 show winner Shayne Ward entered 2006 at the top of the British

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Actor barred

 London, April 21 (Reuters): An Iraqi actor who plays a hijacker in a new film about the September 11 attacks on the US complained today he had been denied entry into the country for the movies premiere.

 But the US embassy in London said Lewis Alsamari, who has lived in Britain since 1995, had not given sufficient notice about his planned trip. A spokeswoman said officials at the embassy would try their best to get Alsamari to New York on time but could give no guarantees.

 Alsamari stars in United 93, a film about the hijacked plane that crashed in Pennsylvania which has sparked intense debate about whether Americans are ready to see an on-screen portrayal of the events. The movie, directed by Briton Paul Greengrass, premieres at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York next week. Alsamari, 30, said he may have been denied entry by the US embassy in London because he served in the Iraqi army in the early 1990s.

 I think this was because I am still an Iraqi citizen and fought in the army ? but that was only because I was forced to, he told Londons Evening Standard newspaper. It would be so disappointing not to be able to go because I still have not seen the film. I have only seen footage and it would have been amazing to be in New York for the premiere.

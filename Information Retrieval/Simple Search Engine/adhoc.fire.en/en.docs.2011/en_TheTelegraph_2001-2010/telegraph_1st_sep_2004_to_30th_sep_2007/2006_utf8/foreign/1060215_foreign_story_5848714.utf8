 Iran renames pastries

 Tehran, Feb. 14 (Reuters): Not content with pelting European embassies with petrol bombs to protest against cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad, Iranians have decided to rename the Danish pastries relished by this nation of cake lovers.

 From now on, the sweet, flaky pastries which dominate the shelves in Irans cake shops will be known as Roses of the Prophet Mohammad, the official Irna news agency reported as pressure on Denmark over the cartoons took on a new dimension.

 No one is allowed to make fun of our beloved and respected Prophet, Hassan Nasserzadeh, a cake-shop owner in central Tehran, said.

 The pastries are baked every day and are not imported or subject to any boycott of Danish goods imposed over the cartoons.

 The Iranian move had echoes of the verbal food fight set off by restaurants in the US House of Representatives which renamed French fries and French toast as Freedom fries and Freedom toast after France refused to back the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003.

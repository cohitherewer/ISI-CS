 No-work blues haunt Dench

 Fear thing 

 Los Angeles, Dec. 25 (AP): Judi Dench may be one of the worlds most acclaimed actresses, but she still worries about getting work.

 The 72-year-old film and stage actress says she takes on many roles partly out of fear that her latest one could be her last. Its just wanting to be employed in my case, she tells the Los Angeles Times. Trevor Nunn once said to me: Youre always in tears on the first night. And I said: Im so frightened that nobodys going to ask me to do the next thing. I get so fearful about that kind of thing. Dench currently stars in the drama Notes on a Scandal.

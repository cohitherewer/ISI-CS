 Harry friend robbed in SA

 DAVID BLAIR

 Davy: Traumatic

 Cape Town, Sept. 11: An armed gang forced Prince Harrys girlfriend, Chelsy Davy, to lie on the kitchen floor of a Cape Town restaurant before robbing her at gunpoint.

 Five thieves posed as customers when they entered the Cubana Latino cafe, overlooked by the crags of Table Mountain in one of the most affluent areas of South Africas oldest city, Cape Town. 

 Davy, 20, was in the cafe with a friend and four other diners. Leal Kleingeld, the owner of the restaurant in the suburb of Claremont, said the five men ordered drinks then drew guns and knives. They made everyone lie down on the kitchen floor at gunpoint and knifepoint, said Kleingeld, 44.

 Everybody was very shaken up. They took everyones wallets, money, cell-phones and car keys. Five staff were on duty at the time and they, together with Davy and the other customers, were herded into the kitchen at the rear of the restaurant.

 The red and yellow neon signs of the Cubana Latino cafe overlook a main road and a robbery in the dining area would have been easily visible to passers-by.

 But the manager, Devilliers Nienabar, did not lie down on the kitchen floor speedily enough for the gang.

 Our manager got kicked in the face, said Kleingeld. Davy, who was not hurt in the incident, studies at the University of Cape Town, whose campus is a short drive from the Cubana Latino cafe.

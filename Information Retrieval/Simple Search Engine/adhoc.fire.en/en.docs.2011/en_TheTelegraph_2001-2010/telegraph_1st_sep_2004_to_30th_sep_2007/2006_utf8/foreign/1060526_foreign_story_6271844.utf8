 Chocolate brain boost

 New York, May 25 (Reuters): Chocolate lovers rejoice. A new study hints that eating milk chocolate may boost brain function.

 Chocolate contains many substances that act as stimulants, such as theobromine, phenethylamine, and caffeine, Dr Bryan Raudenbush from Wheeling Jesuit University in West Virginia.

 These substances by themselves have previously been found to increase alertness and attention and what we have found is that by consuming chocolate you can get the stimulating effects, which then lead to increased mental performance.

 To study the effects of various chocolate types on brain power, Raudenbush and his colleagues made a group of volunteers consume, on four separate occasions, 85 grams of milk chocolate; 85 grams of dark chocolate and 85 grams of carob (a chocolate substitute).

 After a 15-minute digestive period, participants completed a variety of computer-based neuropsychological tests designed to assess cognitive performance including memory, attention span, reaction time and problem solving.

 Composite scores for verbal and visual memory were significantly higher for milk chocolate than the other conditions, Raudenbush said. And consumption of milk and dark chocolate was associated with improved impulse control and reaction time.

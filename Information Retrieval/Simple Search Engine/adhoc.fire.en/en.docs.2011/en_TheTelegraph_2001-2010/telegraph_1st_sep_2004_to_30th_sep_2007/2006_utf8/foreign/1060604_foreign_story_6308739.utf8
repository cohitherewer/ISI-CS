 EU leader to work on Iran

 Solana: Presenter

 Tehran, June 3 (Reuters): European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana will soon present Iran with the incentives agreed by major powers to try to persuade Tehran to end nuclear fuel development, his spokeswoman said today.

 Iran said the plan might offer a way forward, but insisted it would not give up uranium enrichment ? which the West is demanding as proof that it is not developing nuclear weapons.

 The incentives were agreed on Thursday by the permanent members of the UN Security Council ? the US, Russia, Britain, France, China ? plus Germany.

 Solanas spokeswoman, Cristina Gallach, and Iranian foreign minister Manouchehr Mottaki said no date had been set for the trip. However, Solana plans to be in West Asia tomorrow and on Monday.

 The incentives being offered by the six powers were still unknown, but their diplomats have been working on themes ranging from offering nuclear reactors to giving security guarantees.

 We believe if... theres goodwill then theres a possibility that our ideas may complete the proposal and give them (westerners) a way out of the situation they have created for themselves, Mottaki said on state television. However, he added: The main pillar of the talks is that they should be free from preconditions.

 Iranian politicians habitually use the word precondition for demands that Iran end its fuel work. Mottaki and President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad have said there is no question of this, insisting on a right to make fuel for power generation.

 Ahmadinejad last night told UN secretary-general Kofi Annan that Iran was willing to negotiate on nuclear issues as long as talks had no preconditions of threats. 

 Washington says this must not be seen as a final rejection, and that Iran could be staking out a negotiating position.

 Iran has a labyrinthine command structure and the President and the foreign minister may not have the last word on political matters.

 Irans main authority is supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and the Supreme National Security Council, headed by chief nuclear negotiator Ali Larijani, is directly charged with handling the nuclear dispute.

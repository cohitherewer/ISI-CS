 Islamabad, April 14: Bisma Naseem and Fatima Khalil of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) became Asias first women paratroopers after successfully completing a rigorous para jumping course at the PAF academy in Risalpur, southwest of Islamabad.

 Naseem and Khalil, who are currently training as aviation cadets at the academy, set the new record as they performed the jump along with nine officers, ten cadets and 29 airmen yesterday from a C-130 military transport aircraft.

 The two women are studying at the College of Aeronautical Engineering in the academy with ten women aviation cadets, who will be flying F-16s after completing their training at the academy.

 This is the first time in Pakistans history that the air force has inducted women aviation cadets in its general-duty (pilot) branch. 

 Apart from the female cadets, women officers are already serving the air force in the engineering, logistics, accounting, administration and education branches.

 The two ladies proved their mettle during the training course and set a new record, a senior PAF official said at the Para Training Squadron of the academy in Risalpur.

 The jump performed by Naseem and Khalil was the fifth and the last one in the series of five compulsory jumps required to be performed by the cadets in order to earn the Para-Wing badge.

 The Para Training Squardon conducts various basic and advance courses, including advanced military Free Fall Training. 

 My dreams came true today as I performed the last and final Para Jump, Nasem said. 

 Khalil said the para training has enabled her to pursue the targets she had set to achieve during her career as a PAF officer.

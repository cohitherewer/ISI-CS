 Spelling sale

 Los Angeles, Dec. 11 (AP): Hundreds of fans and bargain-hunters descended on Tori Spellings yard sale and walked away with wine glasses, paintings, lingerie, roller skates, a rubber duck and other items. 

 Memorabilia from Spellings time with the television show Beverly Hills, 90210 also sold quickly on Friday and Saturday. One person paid $25 for a plastic Starbucks mug that reportedly retained a smear of Spellings lipstick.

 About 300 people showed up at the Tori Spelling Dazzling Studio City Estate Sale at the rented home she shares with husband Dean McDermott. Spelling is pregnant with the couples first child. They reportedly plan to open a restaurant and raise their child outside Los Angeles.

 Several people even flew in for the sale that resulted in traffic jams and angry neighbours when camera crews blocked the road. 

 News helicopters also hovered over the event. The sale was videotaped for the VH1 reality show So NoTORIous loosely based on Spellings life.

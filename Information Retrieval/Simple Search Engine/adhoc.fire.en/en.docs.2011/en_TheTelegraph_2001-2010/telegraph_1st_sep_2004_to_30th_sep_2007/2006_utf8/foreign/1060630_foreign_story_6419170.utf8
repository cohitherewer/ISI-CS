 Pregnant Spears bares all

 New York, June 29 (AP): Pregnant pop princess Britney Spears is baring nearly all on the cover of Harpers Bazaar magazine.

 The singer of ... Baby, One More Time posed in the buff for the cover of the August issue; theres also a photo spread inside. On the cover, Spears, who is sitting, cups her breasts with her hands and crosses her legs while showing her protruding belly and smiling for the camera of lensman Alexi Lubomirski.

 Nothing to wear? a cover headline asks. 

 Spears revealed to late-night talk show host David Letterman last month that she was pregnant, confirming media reports and ending much speculation. Spears, 24, and her husband, Kevin Federline, have a son, Sean Preston, who was born last year.

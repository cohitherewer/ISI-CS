 Scot puff ban 

 Edinburgh, March 26 (Reuters): A sweeping ban on smoking came into force in Scotland today, making it the first part of Britain where pubs, restaurants and workplaces are smoke-free.

 Around 1,000 Scots die every year from passive smoking.

 , with a population of five million.

 No smoking signs have gone up to promote the measure, part of a broader drive to change a lifestyle of heavy drinking and smoking, poor diet and lack of exercise which has earned Scotland the nickname sick man of Europe.

 At the capital Edinburghs airport, teenage volunteers handed out leaflets about the ban to arriving passengers and a large blue poster declared: Welcome to a smoke free Scotland.

 We have an unhealthy reputation and we are going to change that, first minister Jack McConnell, head of Scotlands government, told reporters. We have a record as a country that has too much heart disease, too much cancer, too many stroke victims. 

 Scotland was inspired by Ireland, which imposed the worlds first nationwide smoking ban in 2004, and a string of other countries which followed its lead.

 Surveys indicate that more than 60 per cent of Scots support the ban, although only a quarter of smokers back it.

 Im loving it, said student Kathy Eager, who works as a waitress at a pub in Edinburghs Grassmarket area.

 She said she would now be able to go straight to university to study after finishing work. Normally Id have to go home and scrub the smoke out of my skin, said Eager.

 England, Wales and Northern Ireland are expected to impose similar bans next year.

 About 30 per cent of people in Scotland smoke, higher than the rest of Britain. Scots also have lower life expectancy.

 Critics of the ban have described much of the evidence about passive smoking as dubious. They have also branded the measure an attack on individual freedoms and the traditional working class lifestyle of drinking and smoking.

 I think its shoddy. There should be smoking places and non-smoking places, said Leo Federici, a nightclub promoter smoking a cigarette outside a city centre bar.

 I probably will cut down, save a bit of money, be a bit healthier but its the principle of the thing.

 Some pub and restaurant owners have voiced concern that the measure may drive smoking customers away.

 But author Ian Rankin welcomed the ban and said his famous creation Inspector John Rebus, a heavy drinker and smoker in the traditional Scottish working class mould, would have to adapt.

 Hes just going to have to take the patches or hes going to have to stand outside his (regular pub) the Oxford Bar, he told BBC Radio Scotland.

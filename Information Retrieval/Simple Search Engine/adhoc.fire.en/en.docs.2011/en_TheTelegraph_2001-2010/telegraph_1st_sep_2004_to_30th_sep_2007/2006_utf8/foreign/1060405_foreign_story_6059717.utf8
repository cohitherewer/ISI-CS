 Million-dollar Julia

 Roberts: Packed

 New York, April 4 (AP): Julia Roberts was almost the million-dollar baby on Broadway last week. Three Days of Rain, which stars Roberts, Paul Rudd and

 Bradley Cooper, grossed a whopping $988,298 for its first full week of preview performances, according to figures released yesterday by the League of American Theatres and Producers. The eight performances, which began on March 28, played to 101 per cent of capacity (which includes standing room) at the Bernard B. Jacobs Theatre, the league said. The Richard Greenberg play ? Robertss Broadway debut ? opens on April 19.

 Other shows playing to capacity ? or better ? last week included Wicked, Monty Pythons Spamalot, The Pajama Game, The Odd Couple and The Phantom of the Opera. Although Phantom was helped by discount offers, the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical has demonstrated surprising box-office muscle, particularly after becoming Broadways longest running show last January. Also playing to virtual capacity were such shows as The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee, Jersey Boys, The Lion King and Tarzan.

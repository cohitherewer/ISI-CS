 Jury mulls 9/11 plotter verdict

 Alexandria (Virginia), March 30 (Reuters): A jury began considering the evidence against September 11 conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui today after prosecutors said he should be executed because his lies led to nearly 3,000 deaths in the hijacked airliner attacks.

 After hearing 10 days of testimony, the jury opened its first full day of deliberations on whether Moussaoui, who pleaded guilty last year to six counts of conspiracy in connection with the attacks, should be eligible for the death penalty. In dramatic testimony on Monday, Moussaoui said he had lied to the FBI after he was arrested on August 16, 2001, to ensure that the plot went forward. 

 He also said he knew about the hijacking plan and was meant to pilot a fifth plane aimed at the White House.

 The jury must now decide if Moussaoui, 37, lied to the FBI after his arrest. If the jury makes that finding, a second phase of the sentencing trial will be held to determine if Moussaoui is put to death.

 Whats in a name? Ask Clooney

 (Top) George Clooney and Jack Abramoff: 

No good night and good luck 

 New York, Jan. 22: Actor George Clooney has come under attack from the father of Jack Abramoff, the Washington lobbyist facing jail over influence-peddling charges, after making an obscene joke about his sons name.

 In a crack delivered while accepting the best actor prize at the Golden Globe film awards in Beverly Hills last week, Clooney, an outspoken Democrat, made fun of Abramoffs father and mother for picking the name Jack.

 Who would name their kid Jack with the last word off at the end of your last name? he asked. No wonder that guy is screwed up.

 The remarks, made in front of an audience at the Beverly Hilton and broadcast to 19 million television viewers worldwide, infuriated Abramoffs father Frank, 78, who was watching the show with his family at his home in Palm Springs, California.

 In an open letter to his local newspaper, he launched a strong attack on both Clooney and the wider Hollywood establishment ? generally seen by Americas Right as a bastion of naive, Left-wing liberalism.

 Oh, how far Hollywood has fallen, said his letter to the Desert Sun. Your glib and ridiculous attack on my son, Jack, coupled with your obscene query as to the choice his mother and I made in naming him, brought shame and dishonour on you and your profession.

 Abramoff added that on hearing Clooneys remarks, his 12-year-old granddaughter ? one of his sons five children ? burst into tears. Are you proud of that? he asked. One wonders how your father would respond, were the roles reversed.

 He went on to explain that Jack was his own fathers name, telling Clooney: You decided to take a gratuitous slap at my son, my family and even my dear departed father. Is this the tradition of Gable, Bogart, Pacino and Burton? Are you the heir to the dignity and greatness of Hollywoods past, or more likely a portent to a depressing and horrific future?

 Clooney, 44, has already come under attack from Republicans after using his recent films to broadcast an increasingly overt message about Americas political climate.

 He won his best actor Golden Globe for playing a CIA operative in the political thriller Syriana, which has attracted criticism from Republicans for showing Americas enemies in a sympathetic light.

 His previous film, Good Night and Good Luck, a biography of the broadcaster Ed Murrow, also had a political theme, reviving memories of McCarthys witch-hunt against Communists in Hollywood in the 1950s.

 His attack on Abramoff could not have come at a more sensitive time in Republican circles. The lobbyist, who counted several senior party figures among his associates, pleaded guilty on January 3 to fraud, tax evasion and influencing lawmakers by showering them with gifts, money and free holidays. 

 In return for a reduced sentence he has agreed to co-operate with a federal inquiry that could focus on as many as 20 members of Congress and become the worst ethics scandal on Capitol Hill in years.

 Clooney has so far ignored Frank Abramoffs protest, but his own father, former television news journalist Nick Clooney, has weighed in robustly on his behalf. 

 I understand what it is like to have ones son criticised in a very public way, Clooney Senior, who lives in Kentucky, told Desert Sun.

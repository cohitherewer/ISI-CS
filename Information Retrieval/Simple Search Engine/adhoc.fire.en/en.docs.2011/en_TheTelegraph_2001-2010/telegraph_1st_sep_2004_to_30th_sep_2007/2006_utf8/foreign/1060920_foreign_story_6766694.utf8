 Traders call for end to Maoist extortion

 Kathmandu, Sept. 19 (Reuters): Hundreds of businessmen rallied in Nepal today to demand an end to extortion by Maoist rebels and greater security from the government, witnesses and business leaders said.

 Stop extortions immediately, read some of the placards held up protesters at a demonstration organised by the Federation of Nepalese Chamber of Commerce and Industries (FNCCI), an umbrella business group, in Birgunj, a business town 60 km south of Kathmandu.

 Extortions and other acts of intimidation by the Maoists or their trade union have forced many industries or businesses to close, FNCCI President Chandi Raj Dhakal told Reuters.

 Earlier this month, Nepals key foreign donors, including the US, urged the rebels to end extortion and intimidation, saying their actions were hurting the economy of one of the worlds poorest nations.

 The Maoists, who have been observing a ceasefire with the security forces since May and are holding talks with the multi-party government, say they collect only voluntary donations and do not force businessmen to pay up.

 But Dhakal said many businesses had closed down in the past few months because of what he termed unreasonable demands for higher wages and better working conditions by pro-rebel labour groups, who have called regular strikes.

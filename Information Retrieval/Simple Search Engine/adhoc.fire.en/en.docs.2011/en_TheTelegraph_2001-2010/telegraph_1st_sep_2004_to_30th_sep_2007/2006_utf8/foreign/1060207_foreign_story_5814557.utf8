 Manisha: Wooing voters

 Kathmandu, Feb. 6: Manisha Koirala appealed to all Nepalese people to exercise their votes in the controversial municipal polls scheduled on Wednesday.

 Addressing a news conference in Biratnagar, her home town in eastern Nepal this morning, the actor reiterated that the people should not fear the Maoist rebels who have announced stern action against those who take part in the polls, including the contestants. The election is going to be conducted peacefully. So have no fear. Come out and exercise your vote, she urged the people. 

 Manisha, who belongs to an illustrious political family, also said that she would enter active politics if she was forced into such a situation.

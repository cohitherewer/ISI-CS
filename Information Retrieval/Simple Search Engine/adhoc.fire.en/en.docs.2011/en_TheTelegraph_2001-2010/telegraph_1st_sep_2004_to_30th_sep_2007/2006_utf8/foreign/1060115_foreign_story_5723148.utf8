 Japan tests huge quake simulator

 Tokyo, Jan. 14 (AP): Japanese researchers tested a huge quake simulator capable of jolting a six-storey building in a project that could help improve earthquake-resistant construction methods.

 The e-defence simulator, with a 300-square-metre shaking table powered by 24 pistons, can jolt buildings up to 12,000 tons, according to the National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Prevention, or NIED.

 In yesterdays experiment, the mammoth device jolted a 16-metre, six-storey condominium at velocities similar to those in the 7.2-magnitude quake that hit the western city of Kobe in 1995. That quake caused widespread damage and killed over 6,400 people.

 Quake simulations involving life-sized structures help engineers assess structural damage in ways that arent possible with models, NIED said. Earthquakes have always been a concern in Japan, located on four tectonic plates, and the country has built some of the worlds most quake-proof buildings.

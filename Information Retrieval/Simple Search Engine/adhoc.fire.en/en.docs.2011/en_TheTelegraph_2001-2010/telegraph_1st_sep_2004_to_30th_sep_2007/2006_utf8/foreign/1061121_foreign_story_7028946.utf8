 ISI help for Maoists

 Kathmandu, Nov. 20 (PTI): Maoist chief Prachanda last night said that Pakistans ISI had offered help to his rebel outfit through direct or indirect means.

 However, Prachanda said he had turned down their offer as it would not be in the interests of Nepal or its people, the Maoist chief told reporters at Kathmandu airport last night after a trip to New Delhi.

 He did not disclose the nature of the help that the ISI was willing to offer but his statement confirms the belief in India that the Pakistani intelligence agency is active in Nepal and other neighbouring countries.

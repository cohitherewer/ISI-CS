 Smoking tied to depression

 New York, March 3 (Reuters): The likelihood of suffering major depression seems to be increased among smokers, especially those who smoke heavily, study findings suggest.

 Researchers in Norway who followed a population-based group of adults for 11 years found that those who smoked were more likely than non-smokers to become depressed, and the risk climbed in tandem with the number of cigarettes smokers puffed each day. Heavy smokers ? those who burned through more than 20 cigarettes a day ? were four times more likely than people who had never smoked to develop depression.

 A number of factors the researchers considered ? including physical health, exercise and stressful life events ? failed to explain the link between smoking and later depression. This suggests, they say, that smoking may directly contribute to the development of the mood disorder.

 For instance, nicotine may over time change brain levels of the emotion-related chemical serotonin, which appears to be reduced in people with depression, the studys lead author, Dr Ole Klungsoyr, said. Klungsoyr and colleagues at the University of Oslo report their findings in the American Journal of Epidemiology.

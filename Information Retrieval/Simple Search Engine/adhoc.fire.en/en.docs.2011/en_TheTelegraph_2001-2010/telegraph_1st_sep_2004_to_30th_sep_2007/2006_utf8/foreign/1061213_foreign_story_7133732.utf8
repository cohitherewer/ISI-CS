 Lifter help

 Berlin, Dec. 12 (Reuters): German shoppers sprang to the help of a shoplifter who was being detained after trying to steal clothes at a department store, wrongly assuming she was being attacked by strangers, police said today.

 Two store detectives caught a woman in her mid-30s stealing garments in the city of Mainz near Frankfurt and attempted to detain her for questioning, police said.

 But the woman tried to free herself, and bit, kicked and hit the detectives who wrestled her down in a skirmish, prompting passersby worried about her safety to help her.

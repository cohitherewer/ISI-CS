 Colombo, Aug. 11 (Reuters): Tamil Tigers and the army shelled each other in Sri Lankas north today and the battlefront of the worst outbreak of fighting since a 2002 truce extended in the east of the island.

 The rebels said troops were trying to breach a border that divides government territory from land the Tigers control in the northern Jaffna peninsula.

 Fighting that has raged in the east for 17 days was also spreading, they said, and the air force bombed a Tiger training camp, killing many rebels.

 Truce monitors confirmed artillery exchanges at three points along the border, including the main entry point at Muhamalai.

 Goods travelling by land must pass through there to reach the army-held area of Jaffna peninsula, which is hemmed in by Tiger territory and guarded by 40,000 troops.

 It is definitely very dangerous, opening up on several fronts, said Robban Nilsson of the unarmed Nordic truce monitoring mission. Guerrilla tactics have always been able to fight the enemy on several fronts, so it is definitely a very worrying development.

 A Reuters witness in Jaffna said he could hear fierce shelling in the distance and said the military announced an indefinite curfew over an emergency radio channel. Shops must now stay closed and people must stay off the streets.

 The Tigers used their own radio station, the Voice of Tigers, to warn civilians to immediately leave the army-held town of Chavakachcheri which lies 16 km east of Jaffna. They are firing artillery and trying to breach our borders, Tiger military spokesman Rasiah Ilanthiraiyan said.

 Pak to buy Awacs aircraft in $1-bn deal

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Islamabad, May 25: Pakistan plans to buy six airborne warning and control system (Awacs) aircraft from Sweden in a $1 billion deal.

 The Pakistani cabinet approved the purchase after a briefing by defence officials who wanted a reliable early warning surveillance system to guard the countrys airspace.

 Pakistan had decided to buy the Swedish Awacs aircraft in July 2004, three months after India signed a $1 billion deal with Israel for the purchase of three Falcon Airborne Early Warning Radar Systems. 

 Pakistan has embarked on an ambitious programme to modernise its air force. It plans to buy 55 F-16s from the US, both old and new, and is making plans to induct the JF-17 Thunder aircraft from China.

 The JF-17 has been made jointly by Pakistan and China. The aircraft made its inaugural flight in the Chinese city of Chengdu on May 10.

 The Pakistan air force will induct the first batch of JF-17s in its fleet next year followed by the jets serial production at the Pakistan Aeronautical Complex (PAC).

 Known as the third generation aircraft, the JF-17 is a lightweight multi-role jet which can fly at a speed of Mach 1.6 with an operational ceiling of 55,000 feet. The aircraft will be equipped with Beyond Visual Range capability, a state-of-the-art avionics package and an capability to track and destroy multiple targets.

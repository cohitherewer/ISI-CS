 Haj bridge 

 on way out 

 Riyadh, Jan. 15 (Reuters): Saudi Arabia has started pulling down a disaster-prone bridge near Mecca days after more than 360 pilgrims were crushed to death there in the worst disaster to hit the Muslim Haj in 16 years.

 The first stage of the projected overhaul of Jamarat bridge in Mena began yesterday and will be completed and ready for next years Haj, said Osama al-Bar, who heads a government centre that helps organise the annual five-day pilgrimage. Jamarat bridge has become the most sensitive area in Haj. 

 Pilgrims were killed as they jostled to perform a stoning ritual at the bridge on Thursday.

 In 2004, about 250 pilgrims were crushed to death at Jamarat Bridge. A decade earlier, 270 were killed in a similar stampede. Thursdays death toll was the highest since 1,426 people were killed in a stampede in a tunnel in Mecca in 1990.

 The authorities had already said they would replace the Jamarat Bridge with an elaborate system of entrances and exits, including a subway, which will cost $1.12 billion. The project will take three years to complete.

 The first stage, which will be ready for the next Haj, involves a two-storey bridge and an underground emergency exit for pilgrims and ambulances.

 Bar said the development would allow Saudi Arabia to host over the 2.5 million pilgrims it currently allows in.

 The bridge is 32-year-old and the legitimacy of Saudi Arabias ruling family rests in the eyes of many Muslims on its ability to host pilgrims from across the world every year.

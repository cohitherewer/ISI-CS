 Lebanon hope

 Jerusalem, Aug. 12 (Reuters): Israels offensive against Hizbollah guerrillas in south Lebanon is expected to end on Monday, foreign minister Tzipi Livni said today.

 Livni said the offensive had continued despite a UN Security Council resolution calling for an end to the war because the army had requested an extension. We said (we would) allow the army the time it needed and I think that will be until some time on Monday, she told Channel Two television. Livni gave no time for the end to the offensive. A senior official said it would be at 0400 GMT. 

 Air strikes killed up to 20 people in Lebanon, hours after the council adopted the resolution. At least four Hizbollah rockets were fired into northern Israel, causing two casualties, Israeli police said. Hizbollahs daily rocket barrages have typically numbered more than 100. The UN resolution authorises up to 15,000 UN troops to move into south Lebanon to enforce a ceasefire. France is widely expected to lead the force, an expanded version of existing UN peacekeepers in the south, but with a more robust mandate. Relief officials said Israel was still denying permission for aid convoys to reach civilians in south Lebanon.

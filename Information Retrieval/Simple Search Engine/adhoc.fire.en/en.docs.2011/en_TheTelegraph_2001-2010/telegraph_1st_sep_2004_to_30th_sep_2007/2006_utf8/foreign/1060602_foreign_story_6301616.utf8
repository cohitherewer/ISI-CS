 Gap with govt widening, say Maoists

 Kathmandu, June 1 (AP): Communist rebels today acknowledged widening differences at peace talks with Nepals new government, accusing the ruling alliance of reneging on promises that could push the country back into conflict.

 After joining forces to topple King Gyanendras authoritarian government in April, the ruling alliance and the rebels appeared close to a solution to the decade-long civil war that has killed more than 13,000 people.

 Rebel spokesman Krishna Mahara, however, accused the government today of reneging on some of its promises ? including putting soldiers back on the street ? which could lead to a return to war.

 The government is trying to push the country back to conflict, Mahara said today, a day before communist activists planned to hold a mass rally in Kathmandu.

 He said the government was trying to reinstate old village councils in areas where the rebels had previously disbanded them.

 Government troops were also back on the streets patrolling, manning checkpoints on highways and even beating up some rebels, he said.

 This is against the code of conduct the sides have signed saying armed soldiers or fighters will not be mobilised, Mahara said.

 Nepals army said soldiers have been deployed in recent days in Kathmandu and other major cities to help combat rising crime. The rebels and government have agreed to hold a second round of peace talks, but a date has not yet been set.

 Mahara said the Maoists also want to hold a conference that would include all parties that had united to oust Gyanendra, and would discuss how to move the country forward, including the rewriting of the constitution.

 Mahara also reiterated the rebels demand to dissolve the reinstated parliament and the new government before they will join an interim administration that would hold elections for a constituent assembly. The rebels, who say they are inspired by Mao Zedong, began fighting in 1996 to establish a communist state.

 Since both sides announced a ceasefire, they have held one round of peace talks last month in Kathmandu.

 Mahara said the rebels were committed to the 25-point code of conduct they signed during the recent first round of talks with the government.

 He dismissed the allegations that the Maoists were extorting money but admitted that they had been voluntarily collecting funds from people to feed their army and also raising taxes as they ran a parallel government.

 He also did not rule out the possibility of mediation in the talks with the government and said they were also working to form a committee to monitor the ceasefire.

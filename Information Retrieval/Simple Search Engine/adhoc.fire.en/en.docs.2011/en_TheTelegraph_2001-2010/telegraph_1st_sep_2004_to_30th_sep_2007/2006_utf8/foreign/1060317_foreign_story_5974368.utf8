 Testing risks

 Chicago, March 16 (Reuters): A drug experiment in which six subjects became violently ill has raised questions about safeguards for patients, while analysts yesterday said it underscores the unavoidable risk in companies testing drugs in healthy volunteers.

 Six men lay in intensive care in a British hospital yesterday after suffering severe reactions to an investigational drug for chronic inflammatory conditions and cancer, British health authorities said.

 The trial, the first using the drug on people, was set up by the US drug testing company Parexel International Corp. on behalf of German drug maker TeGenero AG. Major pharmaceutical companies often farm out drug testing to firms such as Parexel with promises to speed development.

 Universities performed this function in the past, but a whole industry of companies for profit has sprouted to meet the demand. Testing protocols are cleared by oversight committees. This is exactly what the companies were hired to do in the first place, said Eric Coldwell of Robert Baird. Drugs are not perfectly safe. All six subjects who took the drug became ill. Two were in critical condition. 

 The violent reactions suffered by the subjects in the Parexel trial are extremely rare because drugs are exhaustively tested first on animals before being given to humans, experts said. The drug being tested by Parexel is a monoclonal antibody, a biologically-derived protein, called TGN 1412.

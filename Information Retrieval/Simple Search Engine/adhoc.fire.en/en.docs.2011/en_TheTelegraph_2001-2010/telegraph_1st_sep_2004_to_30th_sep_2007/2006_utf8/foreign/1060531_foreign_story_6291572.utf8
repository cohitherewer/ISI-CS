 Dont paint pets yet

 Berlin, May 30 (AP): An animal welfare group has a message for fanatical World Cup followers: Dont paint your pet.

 Germans who want to show their four-legged friends support for Juergen Klinsmanns team should instead buy them jerseys in the national colours of black, red and yellow, European Animal and Nature Protection said. No one needs to torture his dog by thoughtlessly painting it out of justified enthusiasm, Norbert Guenster, the head of the German-based organisation, said today. The group issued its warning as anticipation mounts ahead of the tournament, which opens on June 9.

 Lucky lottery owner

 Bay Shore, New York (AP): A US soldier 

 and his girlfriend found a winning lottery ticket on the 

 ground at a convenience store on Monday and turned it in 

 to police, who were able to find its owner ? a $2,500 winner 

 with no idea her lucky ticket was missing. Sergeant Edward 

 Boniberger and Marnie Hall found the ticket in a plastic 

 case at a store, police said. They tried to find the woman 

 who had signed it, but when they could not, they took it 

 to a police station. Detectives then located Mary Ann Doerrbecker, 

 who had not realised she had dropped the ticket, according 

 to Sergeant Thomas Groneman. She was shocked, 

 Groneman said. Doerrbecker met the couple and offered them 

 a reward, which they declined. 

 Loaders cash craving

 Valletta, Malta (Reuters): A Maltese 

 court has ordered the customs department to return to an 

 aircraft loader $5,000 he found on a plane. The loader found 

 the cash on a plane that arrived in Malta from Tripoli in 

 July 2000. He handed it to customs, but asked for it to 

 be returned when no one claimed it. Customs refused, arguing 

 it was illegal to hold foreign currency under a law existing 

 at the time. A court on Monday decided, however, that the 

 loader had a right to the money.

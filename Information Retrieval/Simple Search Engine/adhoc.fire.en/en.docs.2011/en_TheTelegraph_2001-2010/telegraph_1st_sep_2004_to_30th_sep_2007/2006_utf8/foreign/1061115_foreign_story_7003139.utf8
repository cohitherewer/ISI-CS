 Image bender 

 London, Nov. 14: David Beckham paid himself a salary of up to 19 million last year, it was reported today. 

 The former England football captains income is listed in the end-of-year accounts for his company, Footwork Productions Ltd. It includes income from his sponsorship deals with global brands including Adidas, Gillette, Pepsi and Police sunglasses. 

 But it does not include the 6 million a year he gets for playing for Real Madrid. The accounts revealed that Beckham shared a salary of 19.7 million with two members of staff, but he is believed to have earned the vast majority of it. 

 Footwork Productions is a shop front for Beckhams image rights and sponsorship deals. Because its overheads are so low, for every 100 it takes, a estimated 77.50 of it is profits. A spokesman told the Sun newspaper that the figure was so high because he only paid himself 100,000 the previous financial year.

 Maoists vow not to disrupt protest rally

 J. HEMANTH

 Kathmandu, Jan. 18: The Maoist rebels today announced that they had no plans to take part in the mass rally being organised here on Friday by the seven-party political alliance to mobilise public support against the February 8 municipal polls.

 In a statement, Maoist supremo Prachanda criticised the government for imposing prohibitory orders, including night curfew, in the Kathmandu valley, saying it exposed its cowardice and defeatist mentality. 

 He said his party would honour its commitment to the alliance and support all peaceful protest programmes.

 We will not use any force or provoke violence at the peaceful protest called by the seven parties, he said, adding that the government was raising the bogey of Maoist infiltration to sabotage the rally. 

 Our party, once again would like to clarify that there will not be any power show, infiltration or chaos from our side in the rally,he said. 

 In a separate development, the home ministry advanced the night curfew timings to 9 pm tonight.

 Mel explains outburst

 Gibson: Apologetic

London, Oct. 11: Mel Gibson has condemned his 

anti-Semitic outburst after he was arrested for drink-driving as the stupid 

rambling of a drunkard.

 The actor and director, who unleashed the tirade on a police officer who stopped him in July, said that he did not want the public to think of him as a monster. 

 He said that he needed to heal himself and to be assuring and allay the fears of others and to heal them if they had any heart wounds from something I may have said. It was just the stupid rambling of a drunkard, you know and ... the last thing I want to be is that kind of monster, he said.

 Gibsons comments were made in a two-part interview with ABC news anchors Diane Sawyer, the first since his arrest. The network released excerpts of the interview ahead of its airing tomorrow and Friday.

 Gibsons reputation was left in tatters after he was arrested for drink-driving near the celebrity enclave of Malibu.

 Humour pays

 London, Feb. 13 (Reuters): Its a trait often requested in lonely hearts ads and scientists have now shown that a good sense of humour is important for women, but not men, in choosing a romantic partner.

 A woman is even willing to overlook other shortcomings in a man if he can make her laugh, researchers said. 

 Our results suggest that humour can positively affect desirability as a relationship partner but this effect is most likely to occur when men use humour and are evaluated by women, said Eric Bressler, of Westfield State College in Massachusetts.

 Bressler and Sigal Balshine, of McMaster University in Ontario, Canada demonstrated in an experiment that a good sense of humour ? G.S..H. as it appears in personal ads ? does make a difference.

 The humourous people were seen as more socially adept but less trustworthy, honest and intelligent. Men did not select the funny person but women did. Women chose funny men as relationship partners despite often rating them as less honest and intelligent, the researchers said in the study.

 Kathmandu, June 13 (Reuters): Nepal said today it had freed at least 127 jailed Maoist rebels, keeping a pledge made to the guerrillas ahead of last months resumption of peace talks that aim to end a revolt that has killed thousands of people.

 At least 60 rebels were freed from a jail on the outskirts of Kathmandu, a day after officials dropped terrorism charges against them.

 The Maoists left the high-security prison in a line to be greeted by hundreds of friends and relatives waiting in scorching heat and carrying garlands.

 Down with monarchy. Long live the republic, Long live CPN(M), they shouted, referring to the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist), the official name of the Maoists, as they raised their fists in a Maoist salute.

 Independent Kantipur radio said about 300 rebels had been freed today across the country.

 But home (interior) ministry spokesman Baman Prasad Neupane said 127 rebels had been freed ? 60 in Kathmandu and 52 in the western district of Kaski.

 More will be released as I am collecting reports from other places, he said.

 Nepals multi-party government, which took control in April after King Gyanendra gave in to pro-democracy protests supported by the Maoists and handed power to political parties, held preliminary talks with rebels in May, the first such meeting since 2003.

 Some of those released today are from Maoist-affiliated student and labour groups. All were charged under a controversial anti-terrorism act that allowed security forces to detain suspects for up to one year without trial.

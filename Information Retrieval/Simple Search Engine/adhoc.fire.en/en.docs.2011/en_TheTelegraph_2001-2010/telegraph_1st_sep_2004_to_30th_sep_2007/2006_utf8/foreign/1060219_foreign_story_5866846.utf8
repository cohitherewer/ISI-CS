 Nigeria oil workers abducted

 Lagos, Feb. 18 (Reuters): Nigerian militants launched a string of attacks on the worlds eighth largest oil exporter today, abducting nine foreign workers, bombing a major oil export platform and sabotaging two pipelines.

 Royal Dutch Shell suspended exports from the 380,000 barrel-a-day Forcados tanker terminal, a senior industry source said, bringing the impact from recent attacks on oil supply to one fifth of Nigerias 2.4 million barrels daily.

 The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta said the attacks were a response to military air raids on villages in Delta state earlier this week and would be followed by another wave of violence on a grander scale.

 These hostages are human shields. Subsequent attacks on other installations will be drastic as we have no intentions of taking hostages, the militants said, calling on all oil workers to leave the delta.

 The militants said they wanted more local control over the Niger Deltas vast oil wealth and the release of two ethnic Ijaw leaders, including a militia leader who is on trial for treason.

 Expatriates must realise that they have been caught up in a war and the Nigerian government can do nothing to guarantee the security of anyone, they added.

 In military-style attacks before dawn today, militants stormed an offshore barge operated by US oil services company Willbros and abducted nine workers ? three Americans, one Briton, two Thais, two Egyptians and a Filipino.

 They bombed a major Shell crude oil pipeline nearby, and a pipeline taking natural gas from the delta to a refinery in northern Nigeria, operated by state-run Nigeria National Petroleum Corp, militant and oil industry sources said.

 The full impact of the attacks on operations was not immediately clear.The militants warned Shell not to try to repair the offshore loading platform, which delivers crude oil through pipes to several large buoys where the tankers load.

 If theyre able to repair these facilities without our knowledge, we will repeat this attack on a more brutal scale. This was a warning to oil workers in Delta state, they said.

 Militants said this series of attacks was focused on Delta state, which is on the western side of the Niger Delta and accounts for about a quarter of Nigerian output, in response to the militarys helicopter gunship attacks earlier in the week.

 The military said their aerial bombardment was aimed at gangs stealing crude oil from pipelines, but community leaders said it targeted villages suspected of harbouring militants, who had staged another series of attacks on the oil industry in December and January.

 The delta is a vast region of mangrove swamps and creeks that accounts for almost all of Nigerias output.

Karachi, Aug. 23 (Agencies): Police in Pakistan have arrested a man who stole a railway locomotive, drove it for 34 km and tried to ram it into a passenger train in an apparent suicide attack, police said today.

 The man, identified as Madan Lal, stole the engine from a marshalling yard outside the city of Karachi and was speeding towards a passenger train, the Farid Express, last evening when his engine was derailed. Lal told police he took the locomotive so that he could travel to Karachi.

 God helped us avert a major human disaster, police officer Irshad Baig said.

 Senior railways police officer Malik Mohammad Afzal said Lal appeared to be mentally unstable. Authorities initially thought he was an Indian but later Lal said he was a Pakistani Hindu from the southern province of Sindh.

 He had given his address in Hyderabad but we have still found no documents on him confirming if he is a Pakistani or an Indian, Afzal said.

 Police managed to derail the engine Lal was driving just two minutes before it would have smashed into the passenger train at the Pipri station near Karachi, he said. Lal tried to run away but was caught. Police are also investigating whether he was planning to carry out a terrorist attack, said Afzal.

 The engine had been left unattended at the Pipri railway station by its driver and his assistant, who left it to get a cup of tea from a nearby stall, Afzal said.

 Lal, who is in his 50s, got into the engine and drove it about 34 km through two train stations before entering sprawling Karachis city limits, Afzal said.

 With Lal behind its controls, the engine was minutes away from slamming into the rear of a passenger train travelling in the same direction but further ahead on the line, Afzal said.

 But railway workers diverted the engine onto a service line and forced Lal to stop shortly before the line came to an abrupt end. He could have rammed the (passenger) train and that could have been a disaster, Afzal said.

 We dont know as yet what his motive was for this attack. But he apparently knows how to drive a railway engine and had planned it, he said.

 Lal, who said he had never worked as a train driver but knew how to drive one, has not yet been charged. But he faces a life sentence if convicted of hijacking the engine, Afzal said. The engines driver and his assistant have been arrested for negligence.

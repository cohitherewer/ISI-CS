 Study: Earth has high fever

Washington, June 22 (AP): The Earth is the 

hottest it has been in at least 400 years, perhaps even longer.

 The National Academy of Sciences reported today that the recent warmth is unprecedented for at least the last 400 years and potentially the last several millennia.

 A panel of top climate scientists told lawmakers that the earth is running a fever and that human activities are responsible for much of the recent warming.

 Their 155-page report said average global surface 

temperatures in the northern hemisphere rose about half a degree Celsius during 

the 20th century.

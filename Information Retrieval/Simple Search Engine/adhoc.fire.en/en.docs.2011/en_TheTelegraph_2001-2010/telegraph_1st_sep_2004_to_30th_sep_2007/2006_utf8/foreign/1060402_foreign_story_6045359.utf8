 UK stops sale of four soft drinks

 London, April 1 (Reuters): Britains Food Standards Agency said four soft drinks were being removed from sale after they were found to contain high levels of benzene which can cause cancer.

 The FSA said it had discovered the products with a benzene level above the WHOs guidelines during a survey of 150 soft drinks on sale in the UK. We found that levels in the vast majority of products tested were low and not a cause for concern, said Andrew Wadge, the FSAs director of food safety.

 However, we are concerned about the levels in four drinks and have asked their manufacturers to remove the affected batches from sale.

 The four products were Co-ops low calorie bitter lemon; Popstars still sugar free lemon and lime drink; Morrisons no added sugar pineapple and grapefruit crush; and Hyberrys high juice no added sugar blackcurrant squash.

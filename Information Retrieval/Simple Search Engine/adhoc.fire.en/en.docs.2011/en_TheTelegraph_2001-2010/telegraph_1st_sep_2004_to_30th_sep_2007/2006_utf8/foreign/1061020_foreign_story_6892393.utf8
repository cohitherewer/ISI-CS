 Borat antics

 Almaty (Kazakhstan), Oct. 19 (Reuters): Alarmed by the antics of a fictional TV reporter who portrays their country as a nation of horse urine-drinking misogynists, Kazakh authorities have invited the British comedian who plays the character to come and see the truth for himself.

 Rakhat Aliyev, Kazakh first deputy foreign minister and a powerful son-in-law of President Nursultan Nazarbayev, asked British comedian Sacha Baron Cohen to visit the vast, oil-rich steppe nation and meet normal human beings rather than the larger-than-life lunatics shown by Cohens TV reporter Borat.

 His trip could yield a lot of discoveries that women not only travel inside buses but also drive their own cars.

 White House tears over United 93

 Washington, May 31 (AP): Tears flowed in the White House theatre yesterday night at the conclusion of United 93, a movie about the plane that crashed in rural Pennsylvania on September 11, 2001, after passengers fought back against their hijackers.

 It was a very emotional night, said White House press secretary Tony Snow, who watched the movie with Bush and relatives of some of the 40 passengers and crew members portrayed in the film.

 It has a very powerful ending, Snow said today. Its dead silence as the credits roll, and you had sounds of quiet sobbing in the room. The President has always said that... the passengers and the crew members on the flight were heroes.

 Mariah, Mary fight for Carey

 Los Angeles, Dec. 9 

 (Reuters): Grammy-winning pop singer Mariah Carey is trying 

 to block porn star-turned politician Mary Carey from trademarking 

 her similar-sounding stage name, saying that fans could 

 get the two performers confused.

 But the adult film actress, whose real name is Mary Cook, said on Friday that she would not be intimidated by the international superstar and will press forward with her trademark application. Im ready to battle Mariah over this because Ive been Mary Carey for a long time, Mary Carey said. Its kind of funny because Im a porn star and Ive been being myself for a long time. I think shes being silly.

 The star of films like Double Air Bags 11 and Boobsville Sorority Girls, she started using the stage name Mary Carey in 2002 and ran for California governor against Arnold Schwarzenegger. She filed the trademark papers earlier this year. In October, a lawyer for Mariah Carey sent Mary Careys representatives a letter threatening legal action if she did not withdraw the application.

 MARY CAREY and MARIAH CAREY share the identical surname and have first names that are very similar, attorney Robert Becker wrote. And in part because the porn star was seeking the trademark for audio and video recordings, he said, confusion between your client and her MARY CAREY trademark and our client and its MARIAH CAREY trademark is therefore likely.

 Becker also demanded that Mary Carey use her name only for adult entertainment and that she not sing or perform music. This is a technical procedure to stop a trademark registration. Mariah Carey has no affiliation with Mary Carey, said Mariah Careys spokeswoman, Leslie Sloane-Zelnik.

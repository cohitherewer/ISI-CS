 Nepal warning 

 J. HEMANTH

 Kathmandu, Nov. 17: Nepal Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala today sternly warned the Maoist rebels to stop recruiting schoolchildren for their Peoples Liberation Army.

 At a news conference in his hometown of Biratnagar, eastern Nepal, Koirala said rebel activities like abductions and extortion could have a negative impact on the whole peace process. 

 According to a report in the Kathmandu Post daily, the Maoists have stepped up the recruitment of schoolchildren and youths before the UN deadline of confining the rebels in temporary shelters before the Nepal elections.

 The rebels have lured the youths and children with the assurance that they would be given (Nepal) Rs 8,000 per month and a job in the Nepalese army. 

 In many areas, the rebels took the children by force to their camps without the permission of their parents, the report said. 

 Speaking on the delayed peace accord, Koirala said the pact would be signed after all participants in the peace process reached a consensus on the deal. A delay of a few days would not hamper the peace process, the Prime Minister said. On the contrary it will make the process more concrete and stronger, he added. Koirala said the accord would bring lasting and sustainable peace to the country. Before leaving for Biratnagar, Koirala held talks with Maoist chief Prachanda at his official residence.

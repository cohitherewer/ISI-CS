 Pak to buy N-reactors from China, says paper

 Shaukat Aziz: Big plans

 London, Jan. 3 (Reuters): Pakistan is in talks to buy up to eight nuclear power reactors from China for between $7 billion and $10 billion, Britains Financial Times reported today.

 Construction on the plants could start by 2015 and end 10 years later, the newspaper said, quoting an unidentified senior Pakistani official.

 The new power stations would add 3,600-4,800 megawatts of capacity using a series of 600 megawatt reactors, according to the report.

 Pakistans Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz formally launched construction last week of a Chinese-supplied nuclear plant at Chashma in the eastern province of Punjab.

 In September, Pakistan called on the US and other western countries for help in developing civilian nuclear technology that would meet its growing energy needs. However, there have been international concerns over Pakistans activities since its top nuclear scientist, Abdul Qader Khan, admitted in 2004 selling nuclear technology to Iran, North Korea and Libya.

 Khan, once revered as the father of Pakistans atomic bomb, ran a nuclear black market supplying technology to make highly enriched uranium for nuclear bombs.

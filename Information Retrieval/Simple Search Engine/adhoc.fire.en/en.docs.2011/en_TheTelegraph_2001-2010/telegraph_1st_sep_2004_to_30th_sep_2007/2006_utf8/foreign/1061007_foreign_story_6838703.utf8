The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Shakira hips to rock for school

Bogota, Oct. 6 (AP): Pop diva Shakira will 

donate the proceeds from a concert in her hometown to build an arts school for 

1,800 children forced to flee their homes by Colombias civil war.

 The concert, part of her worldwide Oral Fixation tour, will be held on November 15 in the Caribbean port city of Barranquilla and is being billed as a festive homecoming for the hip-shaking international superstar, who last month was nominated for five Latin Grammy awards.

 The English and Spanish bilingual school will bear the name of Shakiras Pies Descalzos (Spanish for Bare Feet) foundation and have an emphasis on arts education, the foundation said yesterday. The school will be located in La Playa, a poor suburb of Barranquilla where 45 per cent of the residents are minors. Only about half of whom attend school.

 La Playas 21,500 residents are among the estimated three million people internally displaced by a half-century of armed conflict between Leftist rebels, far-Right paramilitary groups and army troops. The school, which will open in 2008 and has received the backing of the education authorities, is being designed by Uruguayan architect Rafael Vinoly.

 Tickets for Shakiras concert in Barranquilla start at under $7 (euro 5.5) each, a far cry from the up to $200 (euro 157) being charged at Bogota and the southern city of Cali.

 Shakiras foundation already helps 3,380 children living in three other communities of internally displaced persons.

 The Latin diva, whose song Hips Dont Lie has topped charts across the world, has won two Grammys for best Latin album in 2001 and 2003.

 Russia burns millions for image makeover

 Putin: Blitz ahead 

 Moscow, Jan. 8: Vladimir Putins government has embarked on an emergency propaganda drive to bolster Russias standing among its citizens and improve its tarnished image abroad. 

 Stung by criticism over human rights, press freedoms, Mafioso business practices and its latest attempt to cut gas supplies to its Western-leaning neighbours, the Kremlin has decided to hit back. 

 In a grotesque comparison more likely to offend than impress, Gleb Pavlovski, a Kremlin media adviser, said: The Russians have become the Jews of the 21st century. They are regarded as the pariahs of Europe. 

 The Kremlin is believed to be spending almost ?70 million a year on its campaign, which includes backing for pro-government rock groups, new patriotic magazines and radio programmes and funding for an English-language television channel. 

 The drive has been timed to coincide with Russias year-long chairmanship of the G8 group of leading industrial nations that began this month. When G8 leaders assemble for their summit in St Petersburg in July, they will be treated to a lavish state-backed demonstration of Russian prowess. 

 Sergei Mironov, the head of the Russian Federation Council and a loyal Putin supporter, sought to justify the huge financial backing for the campaign: The West has learnt how to hurt us by portraying us in a very bad light. For that reason the honour of the homeland has become an extremely costly matter. 

 Three weeks ago, the Kremlin began targeting Western audiences with a ?17 million government-funded satellite television channel, Russia Today, which broadcasts programmes portraying Putins government in a wholly favourable light across Europe, North America, Asia and Africa.

 Skydive craze

 Kuala Lumpur, July 16 (AP): A Malaysian couple celebrated their 37th wedding anniversary today by jumping out of an aircraft at 9,000 feet, in their first ever parachute jump.

 Cheah Sum Beng, 64, and wife Choo Kit Har, 61, earned themselves an entry in the Malaysia Book of Records as the oldest pair to skydive from a helicopter, the national news agency Bernama said. They went into a 30-second free-fall before opening their parachute. Cheah said the curiosity and the will to face adversities made them to take up the challenge.

 Cell flight 

 Tokyo (Reuters): Japanese students succeeded on Sunday in making a manned flight in a plane powered only by household batteries. The group from the Tokyo Institute of Technology flew the plane a distance of 1,283 ft at an airfield in what was the first such battery-powered flight. The plane, weighing just 44 kg, was piloted by a 63-kg student for the trip, which lasted about one minute. The power was provided by 160 AA batteries.

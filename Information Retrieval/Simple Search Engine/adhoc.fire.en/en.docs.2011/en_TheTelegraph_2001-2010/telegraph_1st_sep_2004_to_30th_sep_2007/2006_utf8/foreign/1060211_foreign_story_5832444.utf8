 Nepal govt rejects Maoist talks offer

 J. HEMANTH

 Gyanendra: Cornered

 Kathmandu, Feb. 10: The royalist government headed by King Gyanendra today rejected a Maoist ceasefire offer and reiterated that no talks can be possible with the rebels unless they renounced violence and laid down their arms.

 At a press meet, the vice-chairman of the council of ministers, Dr Tulsi Giri, said that the government has not changed its stance on the Maoists. They are terrorists. We can not hold dialogue with them until they surrender their arms and stop their terrorist activities, he said. 

 Responding to questions on the recently published interviews of Maoist supremo Prachanda in some newspapers, Giri said the rebels were trying to mislead the people of Nepal. On one hand, they are talking about peace while on the other they are expressing their intention to dislodge the government. They have no clear stance. Violence has to be renounced to hold talks. 

 Giri, who is a hardliner in the Nepal royalist government, also dismissed the worldwide criticism of the controversial February 8 municipal elections and announced the governments resolve to go ahead with parliamentary elections in a years time. 

 The election commission will call all the political parties to participate in the election and fix the timeframe. The polls will be held even if they do not participate in the election, he said. 

 Giri described as baseless the criticism from several countries, including the US and India. 

 The election does not have anything to do with the governments legitimacy as claimed by the international community. Their comments are baseless and sheer lies. When a 16 per cent voter turnout in Kashmir can be accepted, why not a 21 per cent turnout? he asked adding that the low turnout was due to negative activities of the parties.

 Suri: More than a name

 Los Angeles, April 21 (Reuters): Its a Nubian tribe, the word for rose in Persian, thesun in Sanskrit and, oh yes, its also an obscure variation on the Hebrew name Sarah and refers to a form of an Alpacas wool.

 Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes may have got more than they bargained for after naming their daughter Suri when she was born on Tuesday, according to language expert Paul JJ Payack, head of the Global Language Monitor, a group that studies word use. Payack said he found at least five meanings for Suri, including the name of a Nubian tribe on the Sudanese-Ethopian border. The tribe is known for the ceremonial clay plate inserted into the lower lip of Suri girls after their lower teeth have been extracted.

 Suri also refers to the sun in Sanskrit. The words meaning is sometimes translated as lord or ruler. Moreover, Suri is the name for the wool of the Andean Alpaca.

 In Persian, it means rose, though not necessarily a red rose, as Cruise and Holmes said through their spokesman when the birth was announced. Payack said Suri was also a relatively rare variation of the biblical name Sarah, which means lady or princess. Combined with the childs last name, which in English means to move or go along, especially in an unhurried or unconcerned fashion, Payack added that Suri Cruise could translate to: The ruling Nubian sun princess unhurriedly moving along wearing a rose-coloured blanket.

 Speaking during an interview to a US daily USA Today, Cruise said: I thought I had been used to long days and nights on movie sets. But I think Ive forgotten what sleep is.

 Cruise said he was hesitant to resume doing promotional interviews for his latest film, Mission: Impossible III. I talked it over with Katie, and she said: Go, go, everythings great, Cruise said.

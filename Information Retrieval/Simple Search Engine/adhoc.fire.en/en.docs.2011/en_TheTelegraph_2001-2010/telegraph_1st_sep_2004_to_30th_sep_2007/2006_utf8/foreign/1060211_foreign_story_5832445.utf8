 Costner to rock at golf meet

 Greenville (South Carolina), Feb. 10 (AP): Kevin Costner will do more than play golf at the next BMW Charity Pro-Am at The Cliffs.

 The 51-year-old actor-director will debut his band with a concert for ticket holders and volunteers, tournament officials announced on Wednesday. 

 The unnamed, five-member group plays original rock and popular music, according to tournament organisers. Costner is the lead singer.

 Costner has participated in the Nationwide Tour celebrity event several times. The concert will follow third-round play in the 72-hole tournament on April 29.

 Costner said the concert was to thank tournament volunteers. This tournament would never take place and be as popular as it is without the hard work and dedication of the thousands of volunteers who give off their time and energy. This is our way of saying thank you to them for all that they do, he said.

 The BMW Charity Pro-Am takes place from April 27 to April 30. Organisers say the five previous tournaments have raised more than $3 million for area charities.

 Recovering Castro on TV

 Havana, Sept. 2 (Reuters): A clearly recovering Cuban President Fidel Castro was shown on television yesterday meeting Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez after temporarily ceding power a month ago to undergo intestinal surgery.

 Castro appeared much stronger than when he was last seen on in a video on August 13, when his ally Chavez visited him to celebrate his 80th birthday. Yesterday, Castro, wearing red pajamas, was seen sitting at a small table talking animatedly with Chavez. On August 13, Castro was shown in bed and covered with a blanket.

 Cloud over Harvard chiefs fate

 Summers: Mounting pressure

 Boston, Feb. 19 (Reuters): Harvard Universitys governing board is considering whether to intervene before the Ivy League schools president faces an unprecedented second vote of no-confidence over his leadership, three newspapers reported this weekend.

 Members of the powerful Harvard Corporation have spoken with faculty and university officials about Harvard president Lawrence Summerss management style and are mulling whether to ask him to resign before the vote, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Boston Globe wrote.

 A board member asked Nancy Rosenblum, chairwoman of the government department and a longtime Summers supporter, how the faculty would react if Summers, whose abrupt style has won him praise and contempt, steps down.

 The faculty of arts and sciences 

 has fixed a no-confidence vote on February 28, one year 

 after Summerss comments on women sparked debate.

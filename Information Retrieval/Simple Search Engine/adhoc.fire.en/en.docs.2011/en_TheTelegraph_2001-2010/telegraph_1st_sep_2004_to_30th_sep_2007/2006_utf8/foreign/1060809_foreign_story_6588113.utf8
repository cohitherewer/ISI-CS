 Colombo, Aug. 8 (Reuters): A car bomb exploded in Colombo today, killing two people, including a three-year-old boy, as Tamil Tiger rebels lifted a water supply blockade.

 Bomb squad officials said a magnetic bomb had been fixed to the rear of a minivan carrying a minority Tamil politician opposed to the Tamil Tiger rebels. It was detonated in a residential quarter of the capital.

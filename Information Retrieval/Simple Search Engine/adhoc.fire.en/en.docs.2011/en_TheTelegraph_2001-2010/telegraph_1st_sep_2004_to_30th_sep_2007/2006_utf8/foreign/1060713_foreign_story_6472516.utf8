 Nepal cuts kings funds

 - Gyanendras allocation slashed by 70% in budget

 Gyanendra

 Kathmandu, July 12 (AP): Nepals government presented the annual budget today, slashing money allocated for King Gyanendra who was recently forced to give up his authoritarian rule.

 Finance minister Ram Sharan Mahat presented the 144 billion rupee ($ 1.95 billion) annual budget in parliament today for the fiscal year that begins on July 17.

 Mahat said the government has slashed the annual funds allocated for the king by about 70 per cent compared to last year when he was in direct control over the Himalayan nation.

 The king would get 210 million rupees ($ 2.8 million) for the coming fiscal year. Weeks of pro-democracy demonstrations forced the king to give up powers he seized last year, reinstate parliament and appoint veteran politician Girija Prasad Koirala as the Prime Minister.

 Koiralas government and parliament pushed through several resolutions stripping the king of his powers including his control over the army and power to veto laws drafted by the government.

 The government expects part of its budget to be financed by foreign donors. The budget includes 23.7 billion rupees ($320 million) in grants and 16.9 billion rupees ($ 229 million) in loans.

 Nepals main donors are Japan, Germany, Britain and the US, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.

 Mahat said the main objectives of this years budget are to institutionalise the democratic system, develop economic infrastructures, improve the investment climate, make economic programs pro-poor and inclusive, increase investment in the social sector and implement programmes for relief, rehabilitation and reconstruction.

 Koirala concern

 An ailing Koirala left hospital today after treatment for pneumonia but his health remains a concern, doctors and analysts said.

 The 84-year-old veteran politician was admitted to Gangalal Heart Centre last week after complaining of chest problems.

 The health of Prime Minister Koirala, the consensus choice of the seven political parties, has been a growing concern in recent months.

 He underwent prostate surgery in Bangkok in June.

 His poor health has definitely hampered the work of the government, said Rajendra Dahal, editor of the widely read magazine, Himal.

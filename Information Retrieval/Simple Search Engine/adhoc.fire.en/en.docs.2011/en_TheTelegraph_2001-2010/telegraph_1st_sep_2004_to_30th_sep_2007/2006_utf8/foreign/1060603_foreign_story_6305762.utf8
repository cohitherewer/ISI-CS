 Iraq glare on Haditha massacre

 Baghdad, June 2 (Reuters): The Iraqi government will ask the US for the investigative files into allegations that US Marines killed Iraqi civilians in Haditha last year, Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki said today.

 Standing beside US ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad during a visit to a new Baghdad power plant, Maliki said he first heard of the alleged November 19 massacre in the town through the media.

 I hope it (the US investigation) will be fair for the sake of all the victims, said the Shia Islamist whose government of national unity was sworn in 13 days ago.

 Asked if he would demand the files, Maliki told reporters without elaborating: Yes.

 US defence officials have said murder charges may be brought against Marines following an investigation into the deaths of 24 civilians in Haditha, which some commentators are comparing to the 1968 My Lai massacre in Vietnam.

 President George W. Bush yesterday promised a thorough independent investigation.

 Maliki, who has said he is losing patience with reports of killings of Iraqi civilians, yesterday condemned the suspected massacre in Haditha as a terrible crime.

 US military spokesmen say three or four other cases involving allegations that US troops killed Iraqi civilians are under investigation. In one of those probes, American military prosecutors were expected to charge seven Marines and a Navy corpsman in the death of an Iraqi civilian.

 Rumsfeld confident

 US secretary of defence Donald 

 Rumsfeld today expressed confidence in the Haditha killing 

 probe, saying we will soon know the answers.

 Lebanon hit again, toll touches 600

 Beirut, July 27 (Reuters): 

 Israeli warplanes and artillery hammered Lebanon again today 

 and the Beirut government said up to 600 people may have 

 been killed in Israels 16-day-old campaign against 

 Hizbollah guerrillas.

 Israels inner cabinet chose to pursue a strategy of air strikes and limited ground incursions, rather than a full-scale invasion of Lebanon, to halt Hizbollah rocket fire on its towns.

 Lebanese health minister Mohammad Khalifeh said hospitals had received 401 bodies of people killed during the war launched by Israel on July 12.

 On top of those victims, there are 150 to 200 bodies still under the rubble. We have not been able to pull them out because the areas they died in are still under fire, he said. At least 437 people, most of them civilians, have been confirmed killed in Lebanon, according to a Reuters tally.

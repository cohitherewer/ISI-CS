 Moss not to face charges

 London, June 15: The supermodel Kate Moss will not be charged over allegations that she took cocaine because there is not enough evidence to proceed.

 The allegations surfaced after video footage apparently showing the model snorting drugs was released to the press. In the resulting furore, Moss lost several of her high-profile modelling contracts.

 Rene Barclay, Londons director of serious casework, said it was clear that Moss was using controlled drugs. But the case highlighted a glaring loophole in the law on dealing with drug-takers. Video footage of Mosss activities could not prove whether the substance was cocaine, ecstasy or amphetamine.

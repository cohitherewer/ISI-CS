The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Delhi eye on border 

 OUR BUREAU

 Oct. 29: With Bangladesh convulsed by street riots and political turmoil, India today moved to protect its eastern borders from a possible refugee influx.

 We have cautioned the Bengal and Assam governments to beef up internal security. There may be a possibility of some groups infiltrating into these states, Pranab Mukherjee said, squaring up to his first major task since becoming foreign minister.

 We have also alerted BSF to take all necessary measures to thwart infiltration bids by Bangladeshis.

 Mukherjee, visiting Murshidabad to oversee flood relief, said that whenever Bangladesh faced political upheaval, Bengal and Assam bore the brunt of an influx. His comments come a day after foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon met Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattcharjee to discuss border problems.

 Mukherjee added that Delhi was in constant touch with the Bangladesh high commission for updates. Delhi fears Islamist groups might now move to the centre-stage in Dhaka, worsening the problem of militants using the country as a base to launch attacks in India.

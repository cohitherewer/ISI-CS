 Pervezs Kargil reply

 Musharraf: Picture proof

 Islamabad, July 13 (PTI): Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf has suggested that the Kargil invasion had been planned even as former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee was preparing for his bus journey to Lahore.

 Former Pakistan Premier Nawaz Sharif had been briefed on the operation 15 days ahead of Vajpayees trip on February 20, 1999, Musharraf said in a television interview. The Pakistan President was the army chief during that time.

 Sharif had recently claimed that he was in the dark about the Kargil operation and had first come to know about it when Vajpayee called him up from Delhi to ask what is happening.

 A Prime Minister is not worth his salt if he is? informed about (the) Kargil operation by his Indian counterpart, Musharraf said. He defended the invasion by saying that it was Kargil and the mujahideen operation that help spread the Kashmir issue globally.

 Speaking to the Pakistani news channel Business Plus, Musharraf said Sharif was briefed about the Kargil operation at Kel in Pakistani Kashmir on February 5, 1999. Excerpts from the interview were carried in the Pakistani daily The Daily Times. Musharraf showed four photographs as evidence of Sharifs visit to Kel. 

 Look at these pictures. In one of these I am receiving him (Sharif), in another he is being briefed by Commander Mehmood at Kel? while in yet another he is addressing the troops there, he said.

 All these pictures were taken the same day, he said.

 Why had he gone to Kel at a time when all such things were underway. During heavy snow...what was the necessity that forced him to go to Kel? Musharraf asked.

 The daily also published pictures showing Musharraf accompanying Sharif. In the pictures, Sharif is seen attending a briefing by former ISI chief Commander Mehmood, who took part in the 1999 coup but later quit during a purge of the military top brass following the 9/11 terror attacks in the US.

 Paltrow pregnant again

 Paltrow: Cumbersome

 Los Angeles, Jan. 14 (Reuters): Oscar-winning actress Gwyneth Paltrow and her musician husband Chris Martin are expecting their second child, celebrity television programme The Insider reported yesterday.

 The show said Paltrow, who has a daughter, named Apple, with Martin, was at a screening of her movie, Proof, in Los Angeles on Thursday when actor Lou Diamond Phillips introduced her to the audience as a pregnant woman and asked her how far along she was. Paltrow replied: Far enough along to feel very cumbersome, according to The Insider.

 The actress Los Angeles-based publicist was not immediately available to confirm the report. Paltrow, 33, won the best actress Oscar for 1998s romantic comedy Shakespeare in Love, and since then has been one of Hollywoods most sought-after actresses. She is among a group vying for a nomination this year.

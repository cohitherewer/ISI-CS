 Korea nuke talks today

 Beijing, Dec. 17 (Reuters): The US and Japan demanded real progress when talks on scrapping North Koreas nuclear arms resume this week, warning Pyongyang that sanctions and isolation were its only alternative.

 But analysts and officials held out little hope of a major breakthrough for the negotiations set to formally reopen tomorrow between the two Koreas, the US, Japan, Russia and host China after a gap of more than a year.

 South Koreas chief envoy Chun Yung-woo also warned against optimism, saying the talks would be exploratory in nature. A missile test by North Korea in July and its nuclear test sparked global outrage and UN sanctions.

 Jolie on UN list, no place for Pitt yet

 Pitt: Waiting game

 United Nations, Jan. 12 (Reuters): Cellist Yo Yo Ma will soon become a UN peace envoy but actor Brad Pitt is not yet on the list to get the same honour as his Oscar-winning friend Angelina Jolie.

 UN secretary-general Kofi Annan yesterday met Ma, considered the worlds greatest living cellist, and confirmed to reporters that Yes, he will be a peace envoy.

 Asked if Brad Pitt would become a UN goodwill ambassador, Annan laughed and said: I will consider it and I will let him know you recommended him.

 Jolie is a goodwill envoy for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. Pitt joined Jolie on a trip to Pakistan last month to highlight the plight of earthquake victims.

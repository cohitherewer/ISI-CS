 Beast behind beautiful cloud

 ALEX STORY 

 London, July 30: As a small girl Maria Tokasheva would sit on the doorstep of her familys home watching enraptured as mysterious mushroom-shaped clouds filled the sky. 

 At the time, in the 1960s, the Soviet Union was embroiled in a fierce arms race, but the endless nuclear bomb tests in the Semipalatinsk region of Kazakhstan seemed nothing more to her than a pretty light show. 

 I liked to be there, said Tokasheva, 49, a mother of one. I remember atomic mushrooms. My friends and I, we couldnt understand how dangerous it was because we had seen this mushroom and then something like a rainbow. It was amazing for us. 

 Only years later, when she and her friends started to feel exhausted for no apparent reason, did they become concerned. Then her hair started falling out. Now six of her nine siblings have died. And they were not alone. 

 Sixteen years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, hundreds of thousands of inhabitants from this area south-east of Astana, Kazakhstans new capital, are still reeling from the deadly legacy of being a nuclear test site. 

 In the post-Second World War battle for global dominance, the development of a nuclear arsenal became a priority for Joseph Stalins regime ? and Semipalatinsk was chosen as the test centre. 

 The welfare of the inhabitants became immaterial as, between 1949 and 1991, around 500 nuclear weapons were detonated in the region ? 68 in one year alone. Atmospheric nuclear tests were conducted at a rate of four per week across an area the size of Sussex. 

 Melis Meitov, a so-called Atomic Soldier who participated in the experiments, was told nothing about the dangers he faced when he joined the military service in Kazakhstan. 

 In 1962, there were four explosions a week that we observed, through dark glasses, from a distance of two miles, he said. An hour after the explosions, we would visit the test fields dressed in safety uniforms. I was there for 40 days ? you can imagine how much radiation I got. 

 Scientists tried to ensure the fallout did not affect Kurchatov, the regional capital, but Meitov remembers that things did not always go to plan. An unplanned explosion went off on August 7, 1962, he said. A black cloud was moving towards where all the military services were based. The waves of the explosion hit Kurchatov. People were told that a hurricane was coming. 

 All the people and soldiers became guinea pigs. We were told it wasnt dangerous and we believed it. These were Soviet times. Now Meitov is one of only 10 survivors from a 250-strong company, none of whom has been able to claim compensation since the collapse of the USSR. 

 His pension does little to cover the cost needed to treat his exposure-related ailments. He says that when he phoned the authorities for advice he was told to stop complaining, and be happy just to be alive.

 In 1992, Kazakhstan recognised that 1.6 million people were affected. In a report by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the government identified 67,000 people in the 19 villages closest to the site as having been seriously affected. Only 27,000 have survived.

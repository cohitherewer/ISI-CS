 Republicans defy Bush

 Washington, March 8 (Reuters): Defying President George W. Bush, Republicans in the House of Representatives yesterday moved to block plans by a state-owned Arab company to manage six US ports by attaching an amendment to must-pass spending legislation for the Iraq war and hurricane relief.

 House Republican leaders backed a plan by Appropriations Committee chairman Jerry Lewis to push an amendment aimed at stopping the Dubai ports deal the administration had approved, said Ron Bonjean, spokesman for House Speaker Dennis Hastert, an Illinois Republican.

 Catwoman task for Berry

 Cambridge (Massachusetts), Feb. 18 (AP): Halle Berry had to write I will not make Catwoman II on a chalkboard four times on Thursday in order to earn her pudding pot as Harvards Hasty Pudding woman of the year.

 Berrys performance in the 2004 action bomb earned her a worst-actress award in last years Razzies, a spoof of the Oscars that trashes Hollywoods worst.

 Berry also shook her hips in a comic faux dance competition to prove her superpower skills and to jokingly test her abilities as an action star.

 Before she was given the traditional brass pudding pot during a roast at Harvards Hasty Pudding Theater, Berry danced suggestively with a Harvard student dressed like a French poodle, which Berrys presenters dubbed Dogman.

 She also acted out scenes from Monsters Ball, a film for which she won an Oscar and a SAG award in 2002.

 Berry, 39, said she takes her Hasty Pudding award very seriously. Its going to go right next to my Oscar, she said. Earlier on Thursday, Berry rode in a silver Bentley convertible in the traditional parade through Harvard Square, flanked by two male Harvard students.

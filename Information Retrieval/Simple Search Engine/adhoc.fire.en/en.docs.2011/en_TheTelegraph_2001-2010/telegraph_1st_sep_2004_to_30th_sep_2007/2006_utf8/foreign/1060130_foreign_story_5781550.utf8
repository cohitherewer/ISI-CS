 Abortion survey

 London, Jan 29 (Reuters): A majority of women in Britain want the law changed to make it harder for them to end a pregnancy, said a poll in the Observer newspaper yesterday.

 The poll found 47 per cent women believe the legal limit for an abortion should be cut from its present 24 weeks while 10 per cent thought abortion should be outlawed. Only 31 per cent women and 35 per cent men thought the current time limit is about right.

 No sex

 Rome (Reuters): Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi 

is famous for his ambitious promises, but he is unlikely to be called to task 

if he breaks his latest pledge: not to have sex before the April 9 general election. 

The twice-married Berlusconi, 69, prides himself on his physical fitness, and 

after a facelift and a hair transplant he looks younger. 

 Ape hunt 

 Kuala Lumpur (Reuters): Malaysia plans to send two teams of scientists to scour its southern rainforests and track down a huge ape said to have been spotted there. The Bigfoot hit headlines after a villager claimed he saw a 10-foot ape standing on two legs by a river.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Britain does 

the Crouch

 Crouch: Time to rock after a goal

 London, June 5 (Reuters): Peter Crouchs celebrated Robot Dance has made a swift transition from the soccer pitch to the dance floor.

 A jerky routine reminiscent of Star Warss C3PO, the dance was first seen on television when the 6-ft-7-inch striker scored in last weeks England friendly against Hungary.

 Its fame spread like wildfire, stealing the headlines just as the public was beginning to wilt under the barrage of speculation about Wayne Rooneys broken metatarsal.

 Prince William asked to see the routine when he visited the England training camp and now bookmakers say Crouch is the tournaments top novelty bet. Doing the Crouch has also spawned a new dance craze among clubbers.

 From Burnham-on-Crouch to Crouch End, people are doing the Crouch, The Guardian said in a poll on how to do the Robot special.

 Hip, it aint. More like what embarrassing uncles do at weddings is a typical reaction from the unconvinced.

 But as World Cup fever mounts ahead of Englands first game against Paraguay on Saturday, gamblers are hooked. It is our top novelty bet, said Graham Sharpe, spokesman for bookmakers William Hill. It has eclipsed interest in what haircut Beckham will be sporting for the opening game.

 We are offering odds of 2-1 that he will perform it once in the tournament, 3-1 to bring it out twice and 4-1 for three or more. We have already seen bets of ?500. Hill even offered odds of 50-1 that Crouch would win TV dance contest Strictly Come Dancing.

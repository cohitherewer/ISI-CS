 Suspects sister leading model

 Heather: Brother bother

 London, Aug 12 (PTI): A 

 Muslim convert arrested in connection with the plot to blow 

 up 10 US-bound jets is related to a leading British supermodel.

 Don Stewart-Whyte, now known as Abdul Waheed, is the half brother of Victorias Secret model Heather Stewart-Whyte. The 36-year-old model was married to the French tennis player Yannick Noah until they divorced in 1999. They had two children.

 Little has been heard from Stewart-Whyte since the divorce. 

 A bizarre 2004 incident in which her family reported her missing or kidnapped ended after ten days after French officials found her alive and well with friends in northern France. 

 There had been concerns for the model following a mysterious phone call made to her family by a French woman who had asked for money. But a spokeswoman for the judicial police in Paris said there had been no kidnapping and Stewart-Whyte was back in the French capital after being questioned by detectives.

 Stewart-Whyte has been seen on the covers of several magazines, such as Vogue Paris, and the UK editions of Elle and Marie Claire. She could also be seen in ads for Christian Dior, Yves Saint Laurent, and Maybelline. She even had been the face of Gucci for some time.

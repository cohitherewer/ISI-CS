 Meet Mike, the unruffled

 NICK BRITTEN 

 London, June 4: For a breed of animal that is quite easily scared to death, Mike the hamster has got some nerve. 

 Having been put through a huge industrial shredder, rotating drum and vibrating grids, it emerged the other side recycled, a little quivering but otherwise unscathed. 

 The rodents death-defying journey began when a skip in which it was rummaging around was loaded on to the back of a transporter and driven to a recycling plant. 

 There, the animal was tipped on to a conveyor belt along with hundreds of tons of waste. First it survived the shredders teeth, which can rip a cooker or washing machine to pieces in seconds. Next it was tipped into a revolving drum before being shaken up on vibrating grids used to extricate smaller pieces of rubbish. 

 Staff at the Recyclo plant in Flintshire in Wales watched in amazement as the bedraggled hamster emerged from the machinery looking a little dazed and suffering from nothing other than a sore foot. 

 It is now settling into a new home and enjoying some relative peace and quiet, being looked after by Liam Bull, 10, the son of a machine operator at the plant, Craig. 

 Craig, 31, said: Its beyond belief. I found the hamster sitting among a huge pile of shredded waste. His fur was a bit matted where he had gone through the machine but he was fine. 

 He had come in with a consignment of waste in a skip and was tipped on to a huge pile at the plant. God knows how he survived ? that shredder is designed to rip things like fridges into tiny pieces. He could have been killed at any stage... its a miracle hes still alive. 

 Liam named the hamster Mike after Mike Jones, the worker who found him on the conveyor belt.

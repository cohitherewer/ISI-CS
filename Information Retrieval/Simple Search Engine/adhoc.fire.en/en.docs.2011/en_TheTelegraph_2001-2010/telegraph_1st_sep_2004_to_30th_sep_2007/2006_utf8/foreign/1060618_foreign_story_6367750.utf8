 Exam failure? Blame teacher

 Paris, June 17 (Reuters): The nephew of a former Socialist minister has successfully sued the French state after failing a philosophy exam because his teacher rarely showed up in class.

 In the first ruling of its kind, the student won his case after his failure to recognise German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer deprived him of a top graduate school place.

 Jerome Charasse, whose uncle Michel Charasse served as budget minister under late President Francois Mitterrand, scored a poor 6 out of 20 in philosophy despite getting good grades in the rest of his baccalaureat high school exams. 

 As a result he failed to get into the prestigious School of Political Science.

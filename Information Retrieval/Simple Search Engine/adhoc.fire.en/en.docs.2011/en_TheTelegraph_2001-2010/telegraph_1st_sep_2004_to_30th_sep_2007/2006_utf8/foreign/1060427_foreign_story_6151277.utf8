 Iran to US: Harm us at your peril

 Tehran, April 26 (Reuters): Iran said today it would harm US interests anywhere in the world if the United States launches an attack, a step Washington says is an option if diplomacy fails to resolve a nuclear standoff.

 The comments by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei come two days before the UN nuclear watchdog reports on whether Iran is complying with UN demands to halt enrichment. Tehran says it will not stop enrichment, which it insists is purely for civilian purposes and not part of what the US says is an effort to make atomic bombs.

 The Americans should know that if they assault Iran their interests will be harmed anywhere in the world that is possible, Khamenei was quoted as saying by state television. The Iranian nation will respond to any blow with double the intensity, he added. The US has been pushing to impose sanctions if, as Washington expects, Iran is found in the report by the IAEA.

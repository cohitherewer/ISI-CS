 Job blow to smokers

 Need not apply

 Brussels, Aug. 5 (Reuters): European employers are free to say smokers need not apply when they advertise for jobs, a European Commission spokeswoman said today.

 It is not a violation within the anti-discrimination rules on a European level for an employer to put into an ad smokers need not apply, said Katharina Von Schnurbein, a Commission spokeswoman. Schnurbeins comments followed a story in the Financial Times reporting the views of social affairs commissioner Vladimir Spidla of the Czech Republic.

 Spida, asked for his views by a member of the European Parliament, said Europe-wide law prohibited discrimination in employment or other areas on the basis of racial or ethnic origin, disability, age, sexual orientation and religion and belief. However, it did not cover smoking, he said.

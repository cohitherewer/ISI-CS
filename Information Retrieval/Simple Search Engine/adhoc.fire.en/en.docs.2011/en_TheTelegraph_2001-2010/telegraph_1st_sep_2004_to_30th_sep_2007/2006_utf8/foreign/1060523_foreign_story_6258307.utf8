 Find out if you are a workaholic

 ROSIE MURRAY-WEST

London, May 22: Being described as a workaholic 

used to be a bit of a compliment, but Gina Gardiner, a life coach, is so concerned 

by the state of Britains work force that she is setting up a support group.

 Recovering Workaholics aims to give those people who have spent too long in the office a structured social life and the chance to put something into the community through charity work.

 I know a number of workaholics and they are like that for different reasons, Gardiner said. For lots of people work is where they get their feelings of self-worth.

 The Recovering Workaholics group, based in London, will involve social activities to tempt people from the office and sessions where they can address ways to balance life and work. 

 Half the people I talk to arent happy with their lives, said Gardiner, 53, a former headmistress working up to 16 hours a day. 

 The only information she could find about tackling the issue was on mental health websites, and she felt there had to be another way of dealing with it. She now works with companies such as Capita discussing work-related issues.

 Michael Drayton, a psychologist who runs a consulting practice in Birmingham dealing with the problem, said taking over-work seriously was overdue. People become workaholics as a way of avoiding dealing with other areas of their lives. They need support.

 Workplace stress is now the second biggest cause of absence from work (after back pain), and causes 500,000 people a year to become ill, according to the Health and Safety Executive.

ARE YOU A WORKAHOLIC?

 1 It is Friday afternoon, and your colleagues 

are talking about their weekend plans. Do you:

 a) Chip in enthusiastically, 

 b) Keep your head down ? you want to finish that project before you leave tonight.

 c) Guiltily hide the bag stuffed with files you are taking home with you. Your only date is with your laptop.

 2 Your mobile phone rings in the middle of 

your daughters birthday party. Its the boss, and he wants you back 

in the office now. Do you:

 a) Not hear it ? your mobile phone is in a bag upstairs and you havent seen it for weeks.

 b) Answer it and tell him that youll deal with the problem after the party.

 c) Get the car keys and dash. The cake will have to wait.

 3 You have worked an eight-hour day and it 

is time to go home. When you leave the office do you:

 a) Not give it a second thought.

 b) Feel satisfied that youve done all that has been asked of you for the day.

 c) Worry that if you dont go back and do a few hours more you may get the sack.

 4 You have made it out for dinner with your 

friends. What do you talk about:

 a) How drunk you got on Wednesday and Thursday nights.

 b) The film you saw last night, and an amusing anecdote about your colleague in accounts.

 c) How you are never going to get the latest project finished, even if you work all weekend. And sorry, you have to leave after the main course and get back to it.

 5 The unthinkable happens and you lose your 

job. What do you miss most:

 a) The money.

 b) The company of your colleagues.

 c) The work and the sense of self esteem it gives you

Mostly Cs: Maybe you are a workaholic. 

Mostly Bs: You seem to have got the balance 

about right.

 Mostly As: Maybe you have work anorexia 

? the opposite of being a workaholic.

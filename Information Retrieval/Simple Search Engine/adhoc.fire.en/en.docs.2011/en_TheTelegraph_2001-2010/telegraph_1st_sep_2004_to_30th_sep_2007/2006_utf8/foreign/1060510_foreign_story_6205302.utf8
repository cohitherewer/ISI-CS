 Spaceys safe Old Vic plans

 London, May 9 (Reuters): Hollywood actor Kevin Spacey has opted for the safety of Shakespeare comedies and sure-fire hits in his attempt to revive the flagging fortunes of Londons Old Vic theatre.

 Critics have turned on Spacey for what they see as a poor record at the helm of the famous London venue, and one questioned whether he should resign after Robert Altmans production of Arthur Millers Resurrection Blues was panned.

 News that the Old Vic would remain empty for five months in 2006 further increased pressure on the 46-year-old American.

 The Oscar-winning star of American Beauty and The Usual Suspects said last month he intended to stay on as artistic director. He has committed to 10 years in the job.

 In the Old Vic tradition of celebrating great acting, big plays and a sense of event were proud of the line-up weve assembled for our third season and beyond, Spacey said today.

 The next season begins with Eugene Neills A Moon for the Misbegotten, in which Spacey himself will perform.

 Early next year, the Old Vic will stage two Shakespeare comedies, The Taming of the Shrew and Twelfth Night, both will be performed by Propeller, an all-male company.

 Then comes a production of The Entertainer to mark the 50th anniversary of John Osbornes play, with British actor Robert Lindsay as the struggling comedian Archie Rice.

 At Christmas, Ian McKellen is set to return as Widow Twankey in the popular pantomime Aladdin, and comedian Stephen Fry has agreed to write a new version of Cinderella for Christmas, 2007.

 Cells in bowels

 San Salvador (El Salvador), Sept. 8 (Reuters): Four prisoners in an El Salvador jail hid cellphones, a phone charger and spare chips in their bowels so they could coordinate crimes from their cells, prison officials said on Wednesday.

 The four men, all gang members, wrapped their phones and accessories in plastic and inserted them into their rectums far enough to reach their intestines, Ramon Arevalo, director of the maximum security Zacatecoluca prison, said. Arevalo said the ruse was discovered during X-ray examinations.

 Lohan loss

 London (AP): Lindsay Lohan lost some 

 luggage at Heathrow Airport on Thursday, but the film star 

 will have to wait and see if police can track down the Hermes 

 bag and the jewellery that was inside it. The police said 

 a 20-year-old woman reported the theft after she noticed 

 her orange bag was definitely not aboard her luggage cart.

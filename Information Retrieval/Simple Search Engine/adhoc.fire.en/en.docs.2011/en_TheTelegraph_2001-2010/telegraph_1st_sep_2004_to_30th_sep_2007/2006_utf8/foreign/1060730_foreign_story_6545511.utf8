 Will Smith wife meets Cruise baby

 New York, July 29 (AP): Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes daughter, Suri, hasnt been seen in public since her April 18 birth. But a second sighting has been reported, this time by Jada Pinkett Smith.

 Shes one of the sweetest babies Ive ever met in my life, Pinkett Smith tells People magazine. Shes an absolute beauty and shes Daddys little girl.

 Pinkett Smith and her husband, Will Smith, have visited Suri twice, both times at Tom Cruise and Katie Holmess mansion in Beverly Hills, California, People reported on its website. Shes the cutest little baby. Shes got a head full of black, beautiful hair, the 34-year-old actress tells the magazine. Shes beautiful and theyre very happy and they need to be left alone.

 Earlier this month, Leah Remini, another Cruise friend, said she had held Suri during a visit to the couples home. Shes a beaming baby. She looks like Tom and Katie, shes just beautiful, the 36-year-old actress said. 

 Arnold Robinson, a spokesman for Cruise, has said that if and when Cruise and Holmes decide to introduce their daughter to the world, it will be at their discretion and not anybody elses.

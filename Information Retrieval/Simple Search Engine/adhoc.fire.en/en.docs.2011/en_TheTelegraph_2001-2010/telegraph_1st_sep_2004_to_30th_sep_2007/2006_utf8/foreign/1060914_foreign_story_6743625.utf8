 China firm on media curbs

 London, Sept. 13 (Reuters): Chinas open policy to foreign media and financial information agencies remains unchanged and the government will protect their freedom and rights, Chinas Premier Wen Jiabao said today.

 I would like to reiterate that the open policy adopted by the Chinese government regarding the foreign news media and the financial information agencies operating in China remains unchanged, Wen said.

 The official Xinhua news agency announced rules on Sunday requiring foreign media to seek approval to distribute news, saying it could censor reports distributed by foreign media and delete forbidden content.

 The US has expressed concern about the new restrictions and trade officials are looking at whether Washington could challenge them as a violation of World Trade Organisation rules.

 I think that there are a lot of misunderstandings about the Chinese government policy for foreign media doing business in China, Wen said after meeting British Prime Minister Tony Blair in London.

 The Chinese government will ensure the freedom and rights of the foreign news media and foreign financial information agencies operating in China, he said.

 Information in commerce, finance and economic development will flow freely without any obstructions, Wen said.

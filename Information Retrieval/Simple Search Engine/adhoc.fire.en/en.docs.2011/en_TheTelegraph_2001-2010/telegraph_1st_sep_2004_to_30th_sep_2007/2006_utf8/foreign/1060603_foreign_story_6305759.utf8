 Want to lose weight? Diet in groups 

 CELIA HALL

 London, June 2: The most successful weight loss diets are those that involve a weekly commitment to a class or meeting, according to research that monitored people using four popular commercial methods. 

 The study also sends the message to public health doctors, grappling with the nations obesity epidemic, that a one size fits all approach to dieting does not work. 

 After six months, all the participants had lost around a stone on average, but at 12 months less than half were sticking to their diets. Those that did were twice as likely to have been allocated group diets than self-monitored diets. 

 At 12 months, all the diets that people kept to resulted in a healthy loss of around 10 per cent of body weight. The study inevitably found that diets that worked were those that were adhered to. The trick, the study said, was to discover which type of diet appealed most to any individual. 

 The diets selected were Atkins, a strict, low-carbohydrate diet; Slim-Fast, a meal replacement system; Weight Watchers Pure Points, a calorie-controlled diet with weekly meetings; and Rosemary Conley, a low-fat diet with a weekly exercise class. 

 Few studies have made direct comparisons between diets in this way. The research is published in the British Medical Journal. 

 The heavily criticised Atkins diet showed more weight loss than the others in the first four weeks but showed no significant difference at the end of the trial. People on the Atkins diet did not experience a rise in blood cholesterol. 

 Attendance at the weekly meeting after two months was 79 per cent for Rosemary Conley and 55 per cent for Weight Watchers, and at six months, 47 per cent for both. 

 Slim Fast recommends 14 meal replacements a week. Participants reported 10 replacements a week at two months and eight at six months. 

 People using the Atkins diet reported dropping 40 carbohydrate portions daily at the start compared with dropping five at two months and seven at six months. 

 Helen Truby, a senior lecturer in nutrition and dietetics from Surrey University who led the study, said in the British Medical Journal: Currently we cannot predict the dietary approach best suited to each person but it is clear that one size does not fit all. 

 No dietary differences were apparent at six months but behaviour from six to 12 months points towards an advantage of programmes based on group support. 

 She added that the findings should help doctors and promoters be realistic in advising people on how much weight they might expect to lose. 

 The study was supported by the 

 BBC and the researchers said participants might have been 

 influenced by the prospect of publicity. When data from 

 the 15 participants for filming were excluded, there was 

 no change in the figures. The findings were also consistent 

 with other studies.

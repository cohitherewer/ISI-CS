 Clapton concert

 St. Paul, Minnesota, Sept. 17 (AP): Eric Clapton kicked off his North American tour here with a blistering set of old and new material.

 The 61-year-old Clapton, whose nimble playing inspired Clapton is God graffiti in London in the 1960s, showed fiery technique and soulful singing last night, with no signs of any rust after a five-week layoff since the end of his European tour.

 Clapton performed classics like After Midnight, Wonderful Tonight, Layla and Cocaine.

 Gaming blow

 London, Oct. 3 (Reuters): 

 Britains online gambling firms switched their sights 

 away from the US to look for new growth areas today after 

 the US Congress passed legislation to end Internet gaming 

 in their biggest market.

 Their shares continued to bleed after news of the impending ban wiped out $6.5 billion in share values yesterday.

 Sector leader PartyGaming fell more than 11 per cent, extending yesterdays 58 per cent drop, after it cancelled its interim dividend to reinvest $115 million, possibly in acquisitions. 

 Chief executive Mitch Garber had already stressed the need to reduce the companys dependence on the risky US market last month and hinted at deals in Europe and Asia.

 Interactive Gaming Holdings was the sectors only gainer today after the small-cap firm announced a move into South Asia through a deal with Curacao-licensed Maharajah Club.

 The alliance will provide IGH with access to the South Asian gaming market at an elementary stage of its development, with a partner who understands its inherent cultural differences, said IGH chief executive John Heaton.

 Long hours hurt women

 London, July 12 (Reuters): Working long hours has a greater negative impact on women than men because it makes them more likely to smoke, drink coffee and eat unhealthy food.

 Both sexes consume less alcohol if they spend more time working, researchers said today, but toiling extra hours makes women crave unhealthy snacks.

 Women who work long hours eat more high-fat and high-sugar snacks, exercise less, drink more caffeine and, if smokers, smoke more than their male colleagues, said Dr. Daryl Connor, a researcher at Leeds University. For men, working longer hours has no negative impact on exercise, caffeine intake or smoking, Connor said.

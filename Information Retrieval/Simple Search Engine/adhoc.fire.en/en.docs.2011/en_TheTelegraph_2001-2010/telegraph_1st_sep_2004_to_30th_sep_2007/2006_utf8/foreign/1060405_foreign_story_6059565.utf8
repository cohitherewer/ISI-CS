 Thaksin to resign

 Bangkok, April 4 (Reuters): Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra declared today he would step down to defuse a long-running political crisis, but it remained unclear exactly when and the Opposition said it still did not trust him.

 The leaders of a street protest campaign that moved Thaksin to call last Sundays inconclusive early elections said they would lift their siege of his office tomorrow but resume demonstrations if he did not go by April 30. 

 Thaksin, accused by opponents of corruption and cronyism, had tears in his eyes as he hugged family and friends after making his announcement. 

 I want to retreat by not taking the Prime Ministership, but I have to be caretaker Prime Minister until the selection process for the next Prime Minister is complete, he said in a nationally-televised address after weeks of street protests.

 The Opposition Democrat Party cast doubt on Thaksins motives, saying he appeared to have reneged on a commitment made yesterday to go immediately if certain conditions were met.

 Hes trying to dictate the terms of his departure, party spokesman Korn Chatikavanij said. Hes trying to get around the election law by forcing parliament to open. I dont think anybody is in a position to force parliament to open illegally.

 The Prime Minister is elected by parliament and Thaksins declaration left key questions unanswered.

 It was not certain when parliament would convene as Sundays election, called three years early and boycotted by the Opposition, left 38 seats empty because unopposed candidates did not get the 20 per cent of the eligible vote required to win.

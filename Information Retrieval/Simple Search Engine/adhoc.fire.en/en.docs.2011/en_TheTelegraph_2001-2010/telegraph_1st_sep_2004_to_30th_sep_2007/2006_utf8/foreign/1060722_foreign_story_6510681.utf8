 Bonds new mission

 London, July 21 (Reuters): A new James Bond novel will be published in 2008 to mark the centenary of creator Ian Flemings birth, but the identity of the new author is being kept under wraps.

 Fleming is credited with writing 13 or 14 Bond novels, starting with Casino Royale in 1953 and ending with Octopussy in 1966. We are delighted to have secured this particular author who we have had in mind for some time now, Corinne Turner of Ian Fleming Publications said today.

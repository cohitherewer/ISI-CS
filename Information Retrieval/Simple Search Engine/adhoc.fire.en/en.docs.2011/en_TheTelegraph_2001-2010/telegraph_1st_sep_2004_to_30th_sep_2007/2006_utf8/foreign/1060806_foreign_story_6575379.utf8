 Tigers halt attack, pull back

 Mutur (Sri Lanka), Aug. 5 (Reuters): Sri Lankas Tamil Tiger rebels said they had halted an offensive on a government-held town in the east today and were pulling back, a sign that conflict on the island may be easing off.

 The government said hostilities would stop if the Tigers kept their word. The pull-back comes after days of shelling and mortar and artillery duels around the eastern town of Mutur, just south of the port city of Trincomalee.

 Mutur was infiltrated by LTTE rebels earlier this week and is now a ghost town, buildings badly damaged and riddled with bullet holes.

 The offensive operation in Mutur has stopped and the LTTE is going back to its former positions in our own territory, a Tiger source said on condition of anonymity. There is no ceasefire yet.

 It was a limited operation, and we are doing this on humanitarian grounds, the source added, saying the Tigers want thousands of Muslims who fled yesterday to return home.

 The government said it was not interested in chasing the Tigers.

 We are not going to chase them ... We wanted certain areas cleared of terrorists and we have done that, said defence spokesman Keheliya Rambukwella. Once the last single Tiger leaves (government territory) the firing will stop.

 But if they come back again we will have to hold the territory and safeguard the civilians, he added. They have absolutely no right to step into (Mutur).

 Officials said the military would continue to clear newly laid landmines from around a sluice gate they accuse the rebels of blocking to choke the flow of water to farmers in government areas the original trigger for the violence.

 The fighting has been the most intense and prolonged since a 2002 ceasefire between the rebels and the government. Diplomats and analysts say the truce holds only on paper and that a two-decade civil war that has killed more than 65,000 people since 1983 has resumed.

 Aid workers estimate 20,000 to 30,000 civilians fled from Mutur yesterday to escape shelling, several thousand of whom have reached the government-held town of Kantale around 30 km southwest. 

 The navy ferried journalists south across Trincomalee harbour into Mutur for the first time since the fighting, landing them on the beach in small assault boats. As troops checked buildings for booby-traps, reporters heard mortar and small arms fire nearby.

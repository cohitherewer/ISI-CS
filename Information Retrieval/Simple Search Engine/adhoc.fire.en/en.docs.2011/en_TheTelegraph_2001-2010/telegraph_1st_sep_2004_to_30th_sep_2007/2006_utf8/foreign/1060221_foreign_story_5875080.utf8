 Another toxic spill in China

 Beijing, Feb. 20 (Reuters): A toxic chemical spill in southwest China has disrupted water supplies to 20,000 people since last week, a state newspaper said today, the latest in a series of pollution incidents to hit the country.

 A power plant on the upper reaches of the Yuexi river in Sichuan province was to blame for the pollution, which prompted environmental officials to suspend water supplies to Guanyin Town since last Wednesday, the official China Daily said.

 Tests showed that the river had been polluted with chemicals, including fluoride, the newspaper said. Water was being trucked to residents, but it wasnt enough.

 Barbra is back

 Philadelphia, Oct. 5 (Reuters): Barbra Strei-sand opened her first US tour in 12 years yesterday with a polished show filled with crowd-pleasing classics, more than a touch of nostalgia and a healthy dose of her liberal politics. 

 Before a capacity crowd of some 16,000 at South Philadelphias Wachovia Center, Streisand gave assured renditions of standards from her long career as a singer and actress including Funny Girl, Come Rain or Come Shine, Love Soft as an Easy Chair and Somewhere.

 Streisand, 64, told an adoring audience her career had lasted 46 years and she now relies on a teleprompter to make sure she doesnt forget the words to her songs.

 Alien claim

 Berlin (Reuters): A German lawyer hopes 

 to drum up more business by pursuing state compensation 

 claims for people who believe they were abducted by aliens. 

 Theres quite a demand for legal advice here, 

 Jens Lorek said on Thursday. The trouble is, people 

 are afraid of making fools of themselves in court. 

 Lorek, a lawyer based in Dresden, said he hoped to expand 

 his client base by taking on the unusual work.

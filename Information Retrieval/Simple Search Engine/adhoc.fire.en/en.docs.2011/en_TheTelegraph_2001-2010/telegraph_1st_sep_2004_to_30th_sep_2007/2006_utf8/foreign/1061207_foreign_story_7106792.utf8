 Vaughniston calls it quits

 Still friends 

 New York, Dec. 6 (AP): Representatives for actors Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn have confirmed that the couple has called it quits, People magazine says on its website (www.people.aol.com)

 Jennifer and Vince mutually agreed to end their relationship but continue to be good friends today, said representatives Stephen Huvane and John Pisani, according to People.

 The representatives said the former co-stars decided to end their romance after Aniston visited Vaughn in London in October. Aniston, 37, and Vaughn, 36, spent much of the last year and a half battling rumours about their relationship first that it was starting, then that it was headed toward marriage, and most recently that it was sputtering.

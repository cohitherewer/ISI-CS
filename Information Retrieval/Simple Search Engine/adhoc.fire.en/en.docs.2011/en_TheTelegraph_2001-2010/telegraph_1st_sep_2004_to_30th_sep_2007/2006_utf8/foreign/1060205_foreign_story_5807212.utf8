 Split powers to slow action

 United Nations, Feb. 4 (Reuters): Despite a decision by the UN nuclear watchdog to report Iran to the Security Council, significant action is likely to come slowly, if at all, because of a split among the major powers, council diplomats say.

 The 35-nation board of the International Atomic Energy Agency voted today to refer Iran to the Security Council, the pre-eminent UN body on war, peace and security with the power to impose punitive measures.

 But a provision in the IAEA resolution, inserted at the insistence of China and Russia, delayed any action in the Security Council that could criticise or punish Iran during the month of February, when the US holds the councils rotating presidency. We understand that the Security Council could be engaged at this stage only in terms of being informed by the IAEA board on the activities going on in the IAEA, Russias deputy UN ambassador Konstantin Dolgov said.

 Any resolution in the 15-member Security Council needs a minimum of nine yes votes and no veto from its permanent members ? the US, Britain, France, Russia and China.

 US and EU leaders, aware that Russia, China and others on the IAEA board wanted to avoid a showdown with Iran, the worlds number four oil exporter, stressed that reporting Tehran would not finish off diplomacy at the IAEAs Vienna headquarters or trigger early sanctions.

 Some envoys believe the Security Council could respond in a low-key fashion to the IAEA report, such as issuing a statement acknowledging the IAEAs action. Considering such measures as an arms embargo would not be feasible for quite some time, they say. Should Iran react more forcefully and end all cooperation with the IAEA, the US and Europeans would probably push for forceful measures.

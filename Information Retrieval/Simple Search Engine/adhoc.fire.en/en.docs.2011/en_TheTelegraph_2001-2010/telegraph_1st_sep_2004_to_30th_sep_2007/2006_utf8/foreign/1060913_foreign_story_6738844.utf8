 Fine Print

 Wives amp; Eva

 Pasadena (California), Sept. 12 (AP): Eva Longoria says shes done with television after Desperate Housewives ends.

 The 31-year-old actress said she loves the medium of television and the routine it provides, but that Housewives will be her last series. 

 I would never leave Desperate Housewives, Longoria said. I love doing both (TV and film), but I would never do another TV show after Desperate Housewives. No. 

 Longoria plays saucy Gabrielle Solis on the ABC comedy. 

 Hairy hunt

 London (Reuters): Wanted: 20 diminutive 

 actors who can sing. Hairy feet are a distinct advantage. 

 Producers of a musical version of The Lord of the Rings 

 are looking for candidates to play the hobbit heroes. The 

 producers are looking for male and female actors and singers 

 aged between 16-35 who must be under 1.7 metres. Hairy toes 

 are an advantage, a spokesman said

 Bag bother

 Toronto (Reuters): Gift bags are more plentiful than ever at this years Toronto International Film Festival, but there is a shortage of Hollywood stars lining up to get them. Whether its the bad rap that some celebrities have got for shamelessly cleaning out gift lounges or the prospect of hauling the goods across the border where the US Internal Revenue Service says stars must declare gifts from awards shows as taxable income, the attitude toward swag is changing fast.

 Cat jihad

 Red Bank, Tennessee (AP): Police are 

 investigating after a man wrote about launching a feline 

 jihad to rid his neighbourhood of stray cats. Max 

 Gerskin wrote a two-part series in a local weekly newspaper, 

 the first of which was published on August 9. In his commentary, 

 Gerskin said the strays fed by a neighbourhood cat 

 lady have brought filth and disease to his home, and 

 local Humane Society officials have not been able to stop 

 it.

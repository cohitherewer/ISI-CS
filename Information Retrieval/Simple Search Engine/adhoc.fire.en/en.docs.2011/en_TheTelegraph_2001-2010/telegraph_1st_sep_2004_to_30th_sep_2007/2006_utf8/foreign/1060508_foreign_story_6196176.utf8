The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 For Bush, the big catch is the fish

 Berlin, May 7 (Reuters): US President George W. Bush told a German newspaper his best moment in more than five years in office was catching a big perch in his own lake.

 You know, Ive experienced many great moments and its hard to name the best, Bush told weekly Bild am Sonntag when asked about his high point since becoming President in January 2001.

 I would say the best moment of all was when I caught a 7.5 pound (3.402 kg) perch in my lake, he told the newspaper in an interview published today. 

 Bush said the worst moment was September 11 when hijacked planes crashed into the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon in Washington.

 In such a situation it takes a while before one understands what is happening, Bush said. I would say that this was the hardest moment, once I had the real picture before my eyes.

 Because Bild could not immediately furnish English quotes, Bushs comments were translated from the German. The paper said the White House planned to release an authorised English version of the interview tomorrow.

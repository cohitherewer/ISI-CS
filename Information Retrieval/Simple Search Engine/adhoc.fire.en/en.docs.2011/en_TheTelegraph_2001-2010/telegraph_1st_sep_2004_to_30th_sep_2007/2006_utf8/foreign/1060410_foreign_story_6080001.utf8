 Keira to be the new Fair Lady

 RICHARD EDEN

 Knightley: Musical stint

 London, April 9: By George, I think shes got it. Keira Knightley, the Academy Award-nominated actress, is being lined up to play Eliza Doolittle in a remake of the classic musical My Fair Lady. 

 Knightley, 21, who last month was in the running for a best actress Oscar as Elizabeth Bennet in Pride and Prejudice, is said to be thrilled at the prospect of taking the role made famous on film by Audrey Hepburn in the 1960s. 

 The story of the Cockney flower girl who passes herself off as an aristocrat under the tutelage of the brusque Professor Henry Higgins, is one of the most coveted roles in film and theatre. 

 Hepburn starred in the 1964 Warner Brothers version and the role was reprised by the former EastEnders actress Martine McCutcheon on stage, in the 2001 musical adaptation by Sir Cameron Mackintosh. 

 Knightley, whose elfin features have inspired comparisons with the late Hepburn, has now been approached by Sir Cameron to play Eliza Doolittle in a new stage or film version. 

 Keira was studying the script madly while filming the sequels to Pirates of the Caribbean in the Bahamas, Knightleys friend said. She is due to have a session with Sir Camerons musical director in London. Keira is a huge fan of musicals and is desperate to do it. 

 Although none of Knightleys previous film or television roles has required her to sing, she has proved a quick learner in the past: she took up football in 2002 for Bend It Like Beckham, sword fighting for Pirates of the Caribbean and even lap dancing in last years flop Domino. 

 The new version of the show, which is based on George Bernard Shaws play Pygmalion, will be directed by Sir Trevor Nunn, who worked on Sir Camerons London run. It has, however, still to be finalised whether the production will first be a remake of the film or a Broadway musical. Although Knightley, the daughter of the actor Will Knightley and the playwright Sharman Macdonald, has little stage experience, she is said to be prepared to star in either version. After Hepburn was signed up to appear in My Fair Lady alongside Sir Rex Harrison as Professor Higgins, her singing voice was not considered strong enough and was dubbed by Marni Nixon. Sir Rex had wanted Julie Andrews, with whom he appeared in the 1956 Broadway production, to play the part. The producers, however, demanded a bigger name. 

 Sir Cameron came to regret his choice of McCutcheon, who had no significant stage experience and withdrew from a succession of performances with a throat infection. 

 quot;Shed be hysterical, beating herself up and saying, It wasnt perfect. It wasnt perfect , quot; the impresario recalled. quot;Youd go back and say, It was terrific. Listen to the audience . quot; 

 Although the role brought her greater prominence, McCutcheon, now 29, has not appeared in the West End since and says she has no desire to do so. Yet, she won an Olivier for her performance and the show was a commercial success, transferring from the National Theatre to the West End where it enjoyed a long run. 

 The casting of Knightley, a rising star of British acting who recently celebrated her 21st birthday, can make or break a film at the box office. Born in Teddington, Middlesex, she demanded an agent at the age of three. She left school before sitting her A levels to concentrate on acting and has already worked with a series of high profile actors - including Dame Judi Dench and Johnny Depp. 

 She can now command more than ?1.5 million per film and, in 2004, her films grossed more than those by any other female star. But she has previously admitted she is quot;desperate to do theatre quot; and would like the chance to play Eleanor of Aquitane in The Lion in Winter or the Greek tragic heroine, Electra. 

 quot;The trouble is, I never got offered anything. I used to go up for auditions and never get them, quot; she said. quot;The last one was when I was 15 and I blew it. But its a hard transition. And. the more successful I get in films, the more afraid I become. quot;

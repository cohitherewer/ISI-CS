 Castros message: stable, rest secret

 Havana, Aug. 2 (Reuters): Ailing Cuban leader Fidel Castro sees it as too early to judge his recovery from surgery that forced him to temporarily hand over power for the first time in 47 years to his brother, state media today quoted him as saying.

 As speculation swirled that his rule might be nearing an end, state-run newspaper Granma published a message from the 79-year-old President saying details of his health were secret but that he was stable and in good spirits.

 The most I can say is that the situation will remain stable for many days before a verdict can be given, said the message from Castro, which was first read out on state television late yesterday.

 The situation is stable but real progress on health needs time, said the message, mentioning Cubas specific situation a reference to long-running US government hostility to the communist outpost on its doorstep.

 Castro, who last appeared in public on July 26, handed over power to his 75-year-old defence minister brother, Raul, on Monday after surgery to halt stomach bleeding.

 The news ignited raucous celebrations among Cuban-Americans in Miami hoping for an end to Cuban communism.

 But residents of the Caribbean islands picturesque but scruffy capital have largely gone about their business as usual. Many said they are worried about their comandantes health but that the revolution he started in the hills of the Sierra Maestra would go on without him.

 There appeared to be a slight increase in police presence in some of Havanas more run-down neighbourhoods, where street protests over power cuts broke out last summer. Some Cubans with relatives in the security forces said military and other uniformed personnel had also been mobilised in barracks and police stations as a precaution.

 Some residents also reported that rapid deployment brigades used to quell riots in the past were on standby.

 Everything is calm and people are not talking about it in the street, but they are worried. What is going to happen? said Manuel, chauffeur of a battered Russian-made Lada car. Government employees held small rallies across Cuba yesterday to show their support for Castro and the revolution.

 Condi learns to have fun

 - The new, popular face of rice

 Honolulu, March 19 (Reuters): A Bolivian guitar decorated with coca leaves in Chile, holding hands with Elmo in Indonesia and a snapshot with Thorpedo, Australias swimming sensation.

 It wasnt the average trip for US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice, whose foreign forays usually involve more serious photographs with her mostly male counterparts in suits.

 But on a nine-day journey ending today, the top US diplomat tried to put a more informal, popular face on American diplomacy in visits to Chile, Indonesia and Australia.

 She also strayed from her usual brutal pace of multiple stops each day and spent two or three days in each country.

 Officials travelling with her said it was one of the longest trips by a US secretary of state ? 50,313 km with more than 60 hours flying time ? and Rice needed more down time.

 In Chile, Rice was photographed strumming a small guitar given to her by Bolivian President Evo Morales after the coca farmer had discussed drug policy. 

 Rices aides were horrified to find out that real coca leaves, the ingredient used to make cocaine, were lacquered onto the instrument. The guitar never made it onto the plane from Chile.

 On a two-day trip to Indonesias capital, Jakarta, the worlds top woman diplomat held hands under heavy security with Elmo, the childrens television character, at an Islamic school where she announced an $8.5-million grant to take Sesame Street to Indonesian schools.

 Rice, more often preoccupied with the likes of Iranian leader Mahmoud Ahmad- inejad, had difficulty remembering the Sesame Street characters, mistakenly referring to Miss Pinky instead of Miss Piggy. 

 In Australia, she took half a day off and travelled from Sydney to Melbourne to attend the 2006 Commonwealth Games. Rices guide was Australias most-decorated Olympian, swimmer Ian Thorpe, whose speed won him the moniker Thorpedo.

 She also attended a boxing match and met winner Bradley Pitt, who shares a name with the famous US actor. 

 As she swept through Melbourne a day after Queen Elizabeths visit, locals shook their heads at the length of Rices motorcade and the helicopters that clattered overhead.

 This motorcade is the biggest I have seen in Melbourne, said the driver of one of the vans transporting Rices staff. Its much bigger than the Queens.

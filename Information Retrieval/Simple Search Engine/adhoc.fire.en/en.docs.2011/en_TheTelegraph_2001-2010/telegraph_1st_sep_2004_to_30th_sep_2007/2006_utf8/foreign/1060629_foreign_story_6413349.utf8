 Probe Pak girl trade, says court

 Karachi, June 28 (Reuters): Pakistans supreme court today ordered an inquiry into a decision by a village council to give away five minor girls in marriage as compensation for a double murder case, police said.

 A council of elders, or jirga, in a village in southern Sindh province was reported to have ruled earlier this month that the killers families should hand over the girls to the family of a man and woman slain in 1997. The two families were related.

 The girls, aged between 13 months and six years, would have been given away in marriage once they reached puberty but authorities acting on media reports stepped in and stopped them.

 The supreme court has ordered 

 an inquiry and a report to be submitted within two weeks, 

 Shahab Mazhar, a district police officer in Kashmore district 

 of Sindh province said. If there is evidence that 

 a jirga was held and the girls were given in compensation, 

 then a case should be registered against the concerned people, 

 Mazhar quoted the court order.

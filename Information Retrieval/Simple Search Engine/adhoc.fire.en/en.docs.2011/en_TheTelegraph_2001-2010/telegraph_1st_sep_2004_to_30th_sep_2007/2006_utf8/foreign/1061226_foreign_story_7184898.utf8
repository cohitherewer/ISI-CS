 Surgeon rushes to Cuba

 - Spain doctor to carry out tests on deteriorating Castro

 Unsteady 

 Madrid, Dec. 25 (Reuters): A renowned Spanish surgeon has been rushed to Cuba to try to stop a steady deterioration in Fidel Castros health, a Spanish newspaper reported yesterday.

 Jose Luis Garcia Sabrido, an intestinal specialist, travelled to the Caribbean island on Thursday on an aircraft chartered by the Cuban government, according to Spains Left-leaning newspaper El Periodico de Catalunya.

 Garcia Sabrido was due to carry out tests on Castro to see if he needs another operation after undergoing emergency surgery for intestinal bleeding in July, the newspaper said, citing hospital sources. The doctors plane was carrying advanced medical equipment not available in Cuba, the newspaper reported. 

 Spanish authorities today confirmed that Garcia Sabrido has flown to Havana to study whether he should undergo more surgery, Madrid region health official Manuel Lamela said.

 He added that Madrids health department has been sending medicines to Cuba since June, but he declined to say which type of medical material or anything about Castros condition.

 If I did, I would be revealing the patients pathology and we would be violating medical confidentiality and the Cuban governments media policy.

 Garcia Sabrido was among doctors who presented their work at a surgery conference in Havana last month, according to the conferences website.

 He is credited with having operated on several important personalities in the past and is very prestigious in Spain and abroad.

 Cuban officials say Castro is not dying and will return to public life. But he has skipped recent public appearances including his 80th birthday celebration, and appeared to be frail and walking with difficulty in video images released in October, fanning speculation that he is too ill to govern.

 US intelligence chief John Negroponte said in an interview with the Washington Post published on December 15 that Castro was near death and had months, not years to live.

 US Congressman William Delahunt, one of the leaders of a delegation that visited Cuba around the same time, said he had concluded from discussions with officials there that if Castro did resume a political role, it would probably be setting broad policy, not governing on a day-to-day basis.

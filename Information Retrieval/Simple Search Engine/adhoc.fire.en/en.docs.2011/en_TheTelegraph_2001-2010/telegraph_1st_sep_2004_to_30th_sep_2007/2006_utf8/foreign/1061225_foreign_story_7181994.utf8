 Broken nose over veil remark

 London, Dec. 24 (Reuters): A British man, whose wife made a passing comment about a Muslim womans full face veil, suffered a broken nose and lost his front teeth after being attacked and head-butted by the womans partner, police said on Sunday.

 The victim, a 46-year-old white man, was walking through Londons Regents Park with his wife, son and daughter when they passed another family, a Muslim man and his wife who was pushing a baby in a pushchair.

 The victims wife made a comment directed to her husband that she thought it must be difficult for the woman wearing the veil to see out of it as it covered her face, a police spokesman said. The suspect began shouting and returned approximately 10 minutes later and repeatedly punched and head-butted the victim.

 The man was taken to hospital, suffering from facial injuries, including a broken nose and a black eye, but was discharged later in the day.

 The spokesman said the suspect was about 35 years old and of West Asian appearance and that they were treating the incident as a racially-motivated assault.

 The attack occurred in mid-November but police were informed only last week.

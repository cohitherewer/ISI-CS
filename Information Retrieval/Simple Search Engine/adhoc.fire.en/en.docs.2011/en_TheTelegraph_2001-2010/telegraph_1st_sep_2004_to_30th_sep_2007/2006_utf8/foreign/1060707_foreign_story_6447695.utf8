 Tobacco triumph

 Miami, July 6 (Reuters): In a huge victory for the tobacco industry, the Florida Supreme Court today refused to reinstate a $145-billion punitive damages award against major cigarette makers found liable for selling a dangerous product.

 The decision lifted one of the biggest financial clouds over tobacco companies and sent their stocks up sharply. It upheld the key part of a Florida appeals court ruling three years ago that overturned the punitive damages, at the time the largest award in a US product liability case.

 The high court said the punitive award was clearly excessive and would result in an unlawful crippling of the defendant companies.

 The ruling clears one of the biggest legal hurdles for Altria Group Incs plan to spin off its Kraft Foods Inc business. Altria management has said repeatedly that it plans to spin off Kraft after Engle and other cases are cleared up.

 But the Supreme Court also upheld key findings of the Miami trial court in the 12-year-old case known as Engle versus Liggett ? among them, that smoking causes cancer, heart disease and other ailments, and that tobacco companies marketed defective and unreasonably dangerous products.

 The high court also upheld the decertification of the class of plaintiffs in the Engle case but reinstated individual damage awards to two cancer patients ? $2.9 million to Mary Farnan and $4 million to the estate of Angie Della Vecchia, who died in 1999.

 I think its bad news for public health and its even worse news for smokers, said Joe Martyak, of the anti-smoking group American Legacy Foundation. The ruling underscores that Big Tobacco will literally be able to litigate to death a smokers claim for justice.

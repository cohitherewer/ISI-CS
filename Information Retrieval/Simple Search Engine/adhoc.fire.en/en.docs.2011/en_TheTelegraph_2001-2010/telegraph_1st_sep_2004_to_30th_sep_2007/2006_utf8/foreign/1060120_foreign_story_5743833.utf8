 Study: Lack of adequate sleep slows learning

 New York, Jan. 19 (Reuters): Skimping on sleep can slow certain types of learning, a new study in rats shows, and the difficulty seems to arise from a lack of new brain neurons.

 Rodents that got half their normal amount of shut-eye had a harder time remembering how to navigate a maze than well-rested rats, Dr Ilana Hairston of the University of California at Berkeley and colleagues found.

 And while new neurons sprouted and survived in a part of the brain associated with spatial learning in the animals that trained in the maze and then slept adequately, this increased growth of brain cells didnt happen in the sleep-restricted animals, Hairston and her team report in the Journal of Neurophysiology.

 Lack of adequate sleep is definitely not good for the brain in the long run, the investigator said. 

 Researchers had previously shown that limiting sleep impairs learning that depends on the hippocampus, a section of the brain at work in mastering spatial tasks. Past investigators also had demonstrated that when hippocampal learning occurs, the survival of new brain cells there is increased.

 Hairston said:You need both experience and a good sleep in order to have neurogenesis.

 Tigers trash truce, 50 killed in clashes

 Colombo, July 31 (AP): A senior rebel leader declared Sri Lankas ceasefire null and void today as soldiers and Tamil Tiger rebels traded artillery shells and gunfire and the air force struck insurgent positions, killing at least 50 fighters, the army said.

 The clashes in the northeastern district of Trincomalee and in Jaffna, a port on Sri Lankas northern tip, were among the fiercest since a 2002 ceasefire, and were as close to open war as the two sides have come in months of back-and-forth attacks.

 Still, the government said it had not violated the cease-fire, insisting it only sent ground forces into Tiger territory to end a rebel blockade of a key water source.

 Definitely not, we are not abrogating from the cease-fire, chief government spokesman Keheliya Rambukwella said. Our militarys operation to open the irrigation gates is purely based on humanitarian grounds. It is not an act of war. The rebels said otherwise. An LTTE leader said the governments offensive amounted to a declaration of war. 

 Therefore, for us, the ceasefire is null and void, said Puratchi, a rebel commander in Trincomalee who only uses one name.

 Puratchi said he was speaking for the Tigers, although his comments could not immediately be confirmed by other rebel leaders.

 Peace talks have faltered, and rising violence has killed about 800 people, about than half of them civilians, since April, according to the Nordic ceasefire monitoring mission.

 The missions chief, retired Swedish general, Ulf Henricsson said the truce was only on paper now. In reality, there is no ceasefire agreement in this area in Trincomalee today, but the paper is still valid, Henricsson said. 

 The root of todays fighting stretches back to July 20, when the Tigers shut a reservoirs sluice gate in an area under their control east of Trincomalee. The move cut water to 60,000 people living in villages in nearby government-controlled territory, and the Tigers said they took action because the government reneged on a promise to build a water tower for rebel-held areas.

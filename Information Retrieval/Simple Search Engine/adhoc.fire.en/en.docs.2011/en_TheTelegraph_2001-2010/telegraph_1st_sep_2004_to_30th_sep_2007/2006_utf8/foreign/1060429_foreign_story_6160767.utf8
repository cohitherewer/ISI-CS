 Pervez barks at tag of western poodle

 Musharraf: Lot of teeth

 London, April 28 (Reuters): Pakistans President Pervez Musharraf has rejected accusations he is a western poodle, saying his fight against Islamic militants is for his countrys benefit, not for the US or Britain.

 I am nobodys poodle, he said in an interview with Britains Guardian newspaper today. I have enough strength of my own to lead. When you talk about fighting terrorism or extremism, I am not doing that for the US or Britain, I am doing it for Pakistan.

 Musharraf, an important ally in the US-led war on terrorism, has faced repeated Opposition protests about his relationship with President George W. Bush. A 10,000-strong crowd gathered in the central Punjab region last month to hear Opposition leader Maulana Fazl-ur-Rehman call a visit by Bush an attempt at enslaving the Pakistani nation and rewarding General Musharraf for his patriotism to America.

 Newspapers have carried critical pieces on US foreign policy in Pakistan and one has a Mush amp; Bush column lampooning the two leaders relationship. 

 Asked by the Guardian if he had the teeth to bite back at his western allies, Musharraf said: Yes sir, I personally do ? a lot of teeth. Sometimes the teeth do not have to be shown. Pragmatism is required in international relations.

 Anger has been building in Pakistan over repeated US attacks in the country, including an airstrike in January which killed 18 civilians in the remote Bajaur region. Musharraf told the Guardian: The strike was an infringement of our sovereignty and I condemned it.

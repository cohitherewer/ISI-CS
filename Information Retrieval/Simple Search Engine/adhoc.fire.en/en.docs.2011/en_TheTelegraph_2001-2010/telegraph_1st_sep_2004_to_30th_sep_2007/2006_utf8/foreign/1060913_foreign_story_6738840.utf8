 Irwin fans urged not to kill rays

 Sydney, Sept. 12 (Reuters): Australian authorities have urged fans of Steve Irwin not to attack stingrays after several rays were found dead since the TV naturalist was killed in a rare fatal attack by one of the normally placid animals.

 Irwin, whose Crocodile Hunter documentaries were watched by more than 200 million people, was killed eight days ago when the serrated barb from a stingrays tail pierced his heart. Queensland state officials said up to 10 of the animals have since been found dead in coastal waters.

 Two were found dead with their tails hacked off today at Deception Bay, north of the Queensland capital Brisbane. Up to six rays had also been found dead recently further north at Hervey Bay said Wayne Sumpton, a senior biologist.

 We do not know if these incidents are motivated by Steve Irwins death. At the moment that is just speculation, he said. We do find dead stingrays with their tails cut off from time to time. People usually do it if they are worried about getting stung by a stingray, or they just do it maliciously, but it is pretty rare, Sumpton said.

 Irwins wildlife colleagues said killing stingrays was against his conservationist teachings.

 We just want to make it very clear that we will not accept and not stand for anyone whos taken a form of retribution. Thats the last thing Steve would want, said Michael Hornby, executive director of Irwins Wildlife Warriors Worldwide.

 The tails of stingrays carry toxic barbs that can measure up to 20 cm.

 Stings from from their tails are not uncommon, although most generally suffer painful but non-lethal wounds in their feet or lower legs. Irwins case was thought to be only the third recorded fatal stingray attack in Australia.

 News of his death sparked a remarkable outpouring of grief from Australia and around the world.

 Irwins family and closest friends held a private funeral around a campfire at his Australia Zoo at the weekend, while a public memorial service is being planned for next Wednesday.

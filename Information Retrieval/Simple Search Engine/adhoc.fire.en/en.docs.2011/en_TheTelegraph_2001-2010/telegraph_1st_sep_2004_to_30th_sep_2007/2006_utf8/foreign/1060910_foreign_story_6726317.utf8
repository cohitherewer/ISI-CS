 Atlantis lifts off

 Cape Canaveral (Florida), Sept. 9 (Reuters): Space shuttle Atlantis roared off its seaside Florida launch pad today after two weeks of delays, setting the stage for Nasa to resume assembly of the International Space Station.

 It was the final possible day for the launch before Nasa would have faced a lengthy postponement while Russia flies a replacement crew to the space station.

 The US space agency is eager to resume construction of the $100-billion orbital complex, which was halted after the 2003 Columbia shuttle disaster, and has only four years to finish the job before the shuttle fleet is retired.

 It looks like your long wait is over, shuttle launch director Mike Leinbach told the Atlantis astronauts just before takeoff. We wish you all the best luck in the world.

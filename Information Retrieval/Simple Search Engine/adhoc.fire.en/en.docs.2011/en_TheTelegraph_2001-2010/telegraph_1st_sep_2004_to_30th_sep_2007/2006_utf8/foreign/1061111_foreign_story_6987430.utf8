 Cate turns back on films for theatre

 Sydney, Nov. 10 (Reuters): Oscar-winning Australian actress Cate Blanchett said today she never planned to be a Hollywood movie star and is content to turn her back on tinseltown to pursue her first love, the theatre.

 Blanchett, who along with her husband playwright Andrew Upton has been appointed a creative director of The Sydney Theatre Company (STC), says she will now only allow three months a year for filming.

 The acceptance of the role of co-creative director of this company is not a dalliance. It is an absolutely firm commitment, she told a news conference at the STCs Wharf Theatre on Sydney Harbour.

 Sometimes I may take that (three months) up, sometimes I may not but my primary responsibility is to co-manage and lead this company whilst also maintaining my own engagement as an artist.

 Now 37 and a mother of two, Blanchett says she is tired of being called a Hollywood celebrity.

 Im not interested in that label for myself personally but obviously if theres some cachet around fame its a by-product, and if that by-product can be harnessed for the companys benefit then fantastic, she said.

 Blanchett began her acting career at the STC 13 years ago, when she first appeared in its production of Oleanna, a year after graduating from acting school.

 She made her film debut in Parklands in 1996 and in 2005, Blanchett won an Academy Award for best supporting actress in The Aviator alongside Leonardo DiCaprio.

 Her latest film, Babel, in which she stars with Brad Pitt, was released in the US last month to acclaim and is being suggested as a possible Oscar nomination.

 Blanchett said she never intended to become a movie star: in fact, film work was frowned upon at her acting school.

 It wasnt something I necessarily trained to do, she said, but conceded it wasvery, very important that actors get the opportunity to work in all mediums.

 This month, Blanchett will direct the STCs A Kind of Alaska, marking her first project in the role.

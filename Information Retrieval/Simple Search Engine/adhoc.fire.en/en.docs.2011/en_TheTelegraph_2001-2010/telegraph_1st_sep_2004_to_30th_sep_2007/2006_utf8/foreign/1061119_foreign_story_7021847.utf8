 Frigid first place for Gibson

 Least inspiring 

 Los Angeles, Nov. 18 (AP): Two decades after being chosen as People magazines sexiest man alive, Mel Gibson now tops a very different kind of list: Film Threats annual Frigid 50: The Coldest People in Hollywood.

 The independent film website yesterday named Gibson number one among the least-powerful, least-inspiring, least-intriguing people in all of Tinseltown, following the anti-Semitic remarks he made during his arrest on suspicion of drunken driving.

 He apologised, he got sick of apologising, he refused to apologise anymore, he didnt want to address the issue, he spoke on nationally broadcast news shows, he spoke at synagogues, he met with Jewish Officials, Film Threats editors wrote. But in the end, in all his Im really not anti-Semitic posturing, he never bothered to address how irresponsible he was for driving under the influence in the first place. 

 And now hes got a new movie opening, Apocalypto, and the question becomes: who cares?

 Gibson, 50, the star of the Lethal Weapon movies and director of The Passion of the Christ, was Peoples sexiest man alive on the magazines inaugural list in 1985.

 Also among Film Threats Frigid 50 are Borat (How can the top box office winner for two straight weeks be on the Frigid 50 already? Simple: Theres no future for Borat.), Lindsay Lohan and the Internet phenomenon Lonelygirl15. 

 Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes,who topped the 2005 list, came in at number 10 the day before their scheduled gala wedding in Italy.

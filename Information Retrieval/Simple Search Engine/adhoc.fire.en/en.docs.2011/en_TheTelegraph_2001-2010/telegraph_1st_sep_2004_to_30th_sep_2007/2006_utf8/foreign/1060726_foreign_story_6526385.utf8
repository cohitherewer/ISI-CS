 Europe hit by heat wave

 Paris, July 25 (Reuters): Around 40 people in France, mostly elderly, have died in a heat wave over the past week and the Netherlands is poised to record its hottest July since records began.

 Meteo France, the national weather agency, has put its heat wave alert at orange, the second highest level, in 53 of the 96 metropolitan departments.

 Further north, the Dutch meteorological institute said July was on track to be the hottest month in the Netherlands since temperatures were first measured in 1706.

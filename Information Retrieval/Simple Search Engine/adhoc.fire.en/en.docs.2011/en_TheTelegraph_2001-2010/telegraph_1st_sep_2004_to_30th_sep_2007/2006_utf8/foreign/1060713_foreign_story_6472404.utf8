 Blair chief fundraiser arrested in sleaze row

 Levy: Damaging

 London, July 12 (Reuters): Lord Levy, the chief fundraiser for Prime Minister Tony Blairs Labour Party, was arrested today by police probing allegations that state awards had been given in return for cash.

 The cash-for-favours row has dented Blairs standing in opinion polls and sparked calls for his resignation. The arrest of Blairs West Asia envoy and tennis partner makes the Prime Ministers position even more precarious.

 Levy, who denied any wrongdoing and accused the police of using their arrest powers totally unnecessarily, was later released on bail without charge pending further enquiries.

 It is damaging. It revives the sleaze story, one of Blairs many problems in recent months, said John Curtice, politics professor at Strathclyde University.

 The critical thing is that Levy is quite close to Blair and the brutal truth is that Blair is wounded and the endgame is playing out. 

 Blairs party came under pressure after it said it had received nearly ?14 million of loans from 12 businessmen, some of whom were nominated for seats in the un-elected House of Lords. Britain has a complicated system of awards and decorations. A law was introduced in 1925 making it illegal to sell seats in the House of Lords following abuses by the government.

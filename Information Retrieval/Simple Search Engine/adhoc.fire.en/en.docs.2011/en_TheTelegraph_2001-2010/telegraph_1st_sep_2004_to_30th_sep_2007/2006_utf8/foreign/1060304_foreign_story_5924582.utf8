 Cuba woos Russians

 Havana, March 3 (Reuters): Russians fell out of love with Cuba when the Soviet Union imploded. Cuba now hopes to win them back with rum cocktails, fine cigars and a little help from Papa Hemingway.

 Cuban cigar and rum exporters plan to open a Floridita bar on Moscows busy Arbat pedestrian street in May, modelled on American writer Ernest Hemingways favourite drinking haunt in Havana. It will try to capture some of the glamour of 1940s and 1950s Havana, when the Floridita was frequented by Hollywood stars and Mafia bosses.

 There will be daiquiris and mojitos served round the clock, a Habanos cigar shop, a restaurant and live Cuban music, said John Rose, an American marketing executive and director of the new bar. We want to bring an authentic Cuban experience to Moscow. We hope it will become the hippest place to sip, smoke, supper and swing, he said.

 The opening was announced during this weeks Cuban cigar festival by the bars owners, Havana Holdings, a partnership between British entrepreneurs and Cuban companies, which launched the award-winning Floridita London in 2004.

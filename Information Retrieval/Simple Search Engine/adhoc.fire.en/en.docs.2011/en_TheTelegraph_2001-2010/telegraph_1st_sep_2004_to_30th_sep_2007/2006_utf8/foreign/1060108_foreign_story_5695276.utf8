 DeLay quits House post

 DeLay: Under pressure

 Washington, Jan. 7 (AP): Embattled Representative Tom DeLay today abandoned his bid to remain as House majority leader, clearing the way for leadership elections among Republicans eager to shed the taint of scandal.

 In a letter to rank-and-file Republicans, DeLay said: I have always acted in an ethical manner. At the same time, I cannot allow our adversaries to divide and distract our attention, the Texas Republican wrote.

 DeLay is battling campaign finance charges in Texas and was forced to step aside temporarily as majority leader last autumn after he was charged in his home state. He has been trying to clear his name and, until today, resume his leadership role.

 In a separate letter to Speaker Dennis Hastert, DeLay said he intends to seek re-election to his House seat in November while I work to clear my name of the baseless charges levelled against me.

 DeLays about-face came amid growing pressure from fellow Republicans who were concerned about their own political futures in the wake of this past weeks guilty pleas by lobbyist Jack Abramoff.

 DeLays defiant, take-no-prisoners style had won him the admiration and respect of fellow Republicans, but his mounting problems cast a shadow over the entire House.

 DeLay acted hours after a small vanguard of Republicans circulated a petition calling for leadership elections and citing DeLays legal problems as well as his long ties to Abramoff.

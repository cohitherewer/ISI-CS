 Wine amp; apes

 Budapest, May 23 (Reuters): Monkeys and apes in Budapests Zoo drink their way through 55 litres of red wine each year, albeit in small quantities each day, to help boost their red blood cells, the zoo said.

 Budapest Zoo spokesman Zoltan Hanga said it was the 11 anthropoid apes who drank most of the wine in 2005. Obviously, they do not have it all at once and get drunk, but they get it in small amounts mixed in their tea, Hanga said.

 Helsinki (Reuters): Finns should be happy about paying some

Happy Taxpayers Association says. The association wants Finns to focus on 

the public services they receive rather than dwelling on negative thoughts about 

income tax. I dont think there is another official association like 

ours in the world, group vice-president Anna Tommola said on Monday.

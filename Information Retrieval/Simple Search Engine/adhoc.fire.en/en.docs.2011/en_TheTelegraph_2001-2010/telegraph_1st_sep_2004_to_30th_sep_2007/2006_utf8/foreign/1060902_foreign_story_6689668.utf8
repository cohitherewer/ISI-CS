 Sleepy flight

 Sofia (Bulgaria), Sept. 1 (Reuters): A sleeping teenager flew home to Bulgaria and then back to Malta after the plane crew apparently failed to notice she was still on the plane.

 Maria Ilieva, 17, was travelling alone and fell asleep on an Air Malta plane taking her overnight from the Maltese capital Valletta to Sofia. Unfortunately, she had returned to Malta by the time she woke up.

 Air Malta officials said the airplane was not a place for sleeping. But I have not seen any signs saying: No sleeping, I have only seen signs saying: No smoking, the girls mother, Nadezhda Vulova, said. 

 Brothel bill

 Sydney (Reuters): Australian brothels 

 are offering clients discounts based on their petrol bills. 

 Brothel owners claim the system works much the same way 

 as supermarkets which offer shoppers discounted petrol prices 

 by presenting their grocery bills when they fill up their 

 tanks. If you come in and spend time with one of our 

 lovely ladies, well give you a discount of 20 cents 

 a litre, Kerry, manager of Sydney brothel The Site, 

 said.

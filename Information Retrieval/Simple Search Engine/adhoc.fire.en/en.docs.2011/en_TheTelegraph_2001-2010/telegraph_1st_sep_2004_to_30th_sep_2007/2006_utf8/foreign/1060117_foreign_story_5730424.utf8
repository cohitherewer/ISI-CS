 Kathmandu, Jan. 16: Fearing Maoist violence in Kathmandu in the next few days, the district administration today imposed a curfew in certain areas of the valley from 11 pm to 4 am starting from tonight. 

 The night-time curfew will be in force in the area within the Ring Road of the Kathmandu valley until further notice. 

 The curfew has been imposed for maintaining law and order, for the welfare of the people and to prevent untoward incidents from taking place, the administration said in a notification adding that security forces have been directed to shoot anybody trying to break the curfew orders.

 The move comes after increased violence by the Maoist rebels within the valley. Two nights ago, hordes of heavily armed rebels launched a brazen assault in the valley by attacking two police checkposts and killing 12 policemen and injuring six. 

 They also detonated bombs in several places to protest against the royalist governments plans to hold municipal elections on February 8.

 In a separate development, the Indian ambassador to Nepal, Shiv Shankar Mukherjee, left for New Delhi today to brief his government on the emerging political situation in Nepal.

 In New Delhi, Mukherjee is set to hold discussions with foreign secretary Shyam Saran and other senior officials of the external affairs ministry. 

 He is also expected to call on defence minister Pranab Mukherjee and home minister Shivraj Patil. 

 Mukherjees visit to New Delhi comes in the aftermath of the collapse of the Maoist ceasefire triggering violent clashes in several parts of the country.

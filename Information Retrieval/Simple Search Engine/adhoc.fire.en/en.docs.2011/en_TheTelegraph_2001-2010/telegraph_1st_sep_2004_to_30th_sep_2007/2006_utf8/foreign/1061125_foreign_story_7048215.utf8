 China, Pak ink trade pact

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Islamabad, Nov. 24: Pakistan and China today signed a landmark free trade agreement and pledged to expand their long-term strategic partnership in the energy sector.

 While no formal agreement was signed for delivery of Chinese nuclear power plants to Pakistan, President Hu Jintao said during a joint news conference with his Pakistani counterpart Pervez Musharraf that energy cooperation was an important component of Sino-Pak relations.

 We reached an understanding during our talks to further reinforce energy cooperation between Pakistan and China, Hu said. Recalling Chinas help to Pakistan in the peaceful use of nuclear energy, Hu said this collaboration would continue in the future.

 China helped Pakistan construct a nuclear power plant at Chashma, 280 km southwest of Islamabad, in the early 1990s. The plant has a capacity to produce 300-megawatts of electricity.

 A second plant with the same capacity is being constructed with Chinese help, also at Chashma.

 Pakistan, which will require 8,800 megawatts of electricity by 2020, has been seeking help from the US and the Nuclear Suppliers Group for knowhow in constructing nuclear power plants.

 The two countries signed 18 agreements, including the free trade pact, which they hope will boost trade from $4.26 billion last year to $15 billion within five years. 

 Hu said China was committed to strengthening the long-term partnership with Pakistan. We are ready to raise our strategic partnership with Pakistan to new levels, he said, adding that ties will be reinforced in economy, trade, investment, education, science and technology and defence fields.

 In an address to the people of Pakistan, Hu hailed Pakistani support on what he described as issues affecting Chinas core interests. He mentioned Taiwan, Tibet and human rights.

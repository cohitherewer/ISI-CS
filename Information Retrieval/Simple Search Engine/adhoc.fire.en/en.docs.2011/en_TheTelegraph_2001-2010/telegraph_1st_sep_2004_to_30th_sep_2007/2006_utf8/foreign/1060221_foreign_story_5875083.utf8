 Osama on tape clubs US with Saddam

 Dubai, Feb. 20 (Reuters): Osama bin Laden accused US forces of barbaric acts in Iraq comparable to those committed by Saddam Hussein, according to an audio tape first broadcast in January and posted on the Internet in full today.

 The (US) criminality has gone as far as raping women and holding them hostage before their husbands ... as for the torture of men it has now come to the use of burning chemical acids and electric drills in their joints, he said in the tape posted with an English-language voice over.

 Despite all these barbaric methods... the mujahideen are strengthening and increasing by the grace of Allah, he said.

 The tape, whose authenticity could not be verified, was posted on the Internet by the al Qaida media group al-Sahab. In January, the Qatar-based Al Jazeera aired parts of the tape, in which bin Laden said al Qaida was preparing further attacks in the US.

 US intelligence analysts then authenticated the tape as a message from bin Laden. It was the first bin Laden tape since 2004.

 In the audio released today, bin Laden said the insurgency in Iraq was gaining strength despite barbaric and oppressive steps taken by the American army and its agents to the extent that there is no longer any mentionable difference between this criminality and the criminality of Saddam.

 The tape was first broadcast by Al Jazeera before new images surfaced of Iraqi prisoner abuse by US forces at Abu Ghraib prison.

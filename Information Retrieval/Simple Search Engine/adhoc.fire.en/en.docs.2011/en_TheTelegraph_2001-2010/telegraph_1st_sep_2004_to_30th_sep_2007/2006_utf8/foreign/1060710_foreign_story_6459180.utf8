 N Korea missile 

 Seoul, July 9 (Reuters): Momentum built today to seek a diplomatic solution to the North Korean missile crisis, with Seoul distancing itself from Japanese-led UN moves to slap punitive sanctions on the reclusive state. 

 North Koreas leader Kim Jong-Il said his country would not budge in negotiations with the US, adding Pyongyang was ready to meet any attack with a strong blow of its own. 

 Israel threat 

 Jerusalem (Reuters): Israel said it would continue air and ground assaults in the Gaza Strip indefinitely, rebuffing a proposed truce and keeping pressure on militants to free an abducted soldier and halt cross-border rocket attacks. 

 Timor peace 

 Jakarta (Reuters): Nobel Peace Prize winner Jose Ramos-Horta is likely to be East Timors new Prime Minister. The selection aims to restore calm to East Timor.

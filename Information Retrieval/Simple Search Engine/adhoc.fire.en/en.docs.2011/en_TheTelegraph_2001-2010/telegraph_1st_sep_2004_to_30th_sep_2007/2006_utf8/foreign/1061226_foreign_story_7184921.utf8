 Godfather of Soul James Brown dead

 Showman

 Atlanta, Dec. 25 (Reuters): Singer James Brown, the self-proclaimed Godfather of Soul, who billed himself as the hardest working man in show business, died today at age 73, his manager said.

 Brown died at 0645 GMT at Emory Crawford Long Hospital in Atlanta after being admitted there on Saturday for treatment of severe pneumonia, his manager, Frank Copsidas, said. Charles Bobbit, Browns longtime friend and personal manager, was at his side, he said.

 The singer, also known as Mr Dynamite, is credited with bringing the word funk into mainstream musical vernacular and influencing a new generation of black music.

 Rap and hip hop artists revered him for the grooves he was able to produce as a band leader and used his beats extensively as the backdrop to their own songs.

 Browns hit Say it Loud (Im Black and Im Proud) became a civil rights anthem during the turbulent 1960s and he performed the song at Richard Nixons inaugural in 1969 an act that temporarily hurt his popularity among young blacks.

 Brown was a showman, typically changing suits a dozen times during a show and dancing himself into a frenzy on stage. He once said he aimed to wear out his audience and give people more than what they came for make them tired.

 He had more than 119 charting singles and recorded over 50 albums, was inducted into the Rock Roll Hall of Fame and received a lifetime achievement award from the Grammys in 1992.

 Brown also built a successful business empire, including a string of radio stations and his own production company, and owned a fleet of expensive cars and his own plane.

 Soul is all the hard knocks, all the punishment the black man has had ... all the unfulfilled dreams that must come true, he once said.

 He was chosen to be a member of President Reagans Council Against Drugs but was arrested several times in the mid-1980s and 90s and charged with drug and weapons possession.

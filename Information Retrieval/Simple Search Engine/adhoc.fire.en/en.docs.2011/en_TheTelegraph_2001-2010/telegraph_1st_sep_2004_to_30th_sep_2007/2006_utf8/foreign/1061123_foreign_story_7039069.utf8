 Videotape lie

Los Angeles, Nov. 22 (Reuters): There is no sex tape involving pop star Britney Spears and estranged husband Kevin Federline, his lawyer said yesterday.

 After Spears filed for divorce from the fledgling rapper this month, reports surfaced in the tabloid press that Federline had in his possession a videotape of the couple having sex and was considering making it public. There is not a sex video of Kevin and Britney in existence, said Federlines divorce lawyer, Mark Vincent Kaplan. 

 It goes without saying that the stories of Kevin attempting to sell such a video are patently false and anyone who reports that they have information of such attempts is either lying or reporting the lie of someone else, Kaplan said.

 Earlier this month, a Los Angeles judge dismissed a lawsuit that Spears filed against Us Weekly, claiming that the magazine defamed her when it reported the existence of a sex tape.

 Judge Lisa Hart Cole ruled that Spears, 24, could not be defamed because she had put her modern sexuality squarely, and profitably, before the public eye.

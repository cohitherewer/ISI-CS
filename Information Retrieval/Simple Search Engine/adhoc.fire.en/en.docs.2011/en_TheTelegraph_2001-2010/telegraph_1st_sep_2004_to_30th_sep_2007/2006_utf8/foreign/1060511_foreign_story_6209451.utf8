 100 injured in Bangla protest

 Dhaka, 

 May 10 (Reuters): At least 100 people were injured 

 and many vehicles damaged in Bangladesh today as sporadic 

 clashes erupted between police and Opposition workers protesting 

 against rising commodity prices, police and witnesses said.

 The protests were organised by the main Opposition Awami League party and joined by thousands of its members and supporters, witnesses said.

 About 50 people were hurt when police fired rubber bullets and tear gas shells to disperse protesters in the northern town of Netrokona, 200 km from Dhaka.

 At the time, thousands of activists were marching towards the office of the district administrator to protest against rise in prices of food, fuel and other essentials in recent weeks.

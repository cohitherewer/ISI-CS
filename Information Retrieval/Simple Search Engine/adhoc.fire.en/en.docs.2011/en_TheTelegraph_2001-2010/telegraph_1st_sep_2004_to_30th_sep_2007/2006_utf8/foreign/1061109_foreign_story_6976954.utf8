 Pelosi, the tornado

 Washington, Nov. 8 (AP): When Republican prospects looked bleak ahead of congressional elections, party leaders would try to rally their supporters with a two-word warning of what a Democratic victory would mean: Speaker Pelosi.

 Yesterday, the Republican nightmare came true. The Democrats won a majority in the House and Nancy Pelosi, a liberal from one of the nations liberal districts, was set to become speaker of the House, the highest ranking lawmaker of the 435-member chamber.

 Pelosi is a big reason Democrats are returning to power after a dozen years in the minority. She organised the traditionally fractious Democratic lawmakers into a united front against President George W. Bush and congressional Republicans. She campaigned tirelessly for members of her own party.

 Pelosi raised $59 million for House candidates this election cycle and more than $100 million since she was elected House Democratic leader four years ago. No one has worked harder to bring us out of the desert, said Representative Anna Eshoo, a fellow Democrat from California and long-time friend. This woman is a human tornado.

 Pelosi, 66, the daughter and sister of Baltimore mayors, grew up immersed in politics. She moved west in her 20s when her investment banker husband wanted to return to his roots. She managed to work herself into Californias Democratic political structure while raising five children who were born over six years.

 She did not run for Congress until she was 46, when her youngest daughter reached high school.

 Pelosi made history four years ago when she became the first woman to lead a party caucus in either house of Congress, piercing what she calls a marble ceiling in the Capitol that makes it difficult for women to ascend to powerful positions.

 Fine Print

 Sandy Jagger

 Rio de Janeiro, Feb. 18 (Reuters): A stones throw from a stage on Copacabana beach where Mick Jagger will sing and strut in front of more than 1 million people, a spitting image of the British rock star sticks his tongue out of the sand at passersby.

 Thick red lips and four white upper teeth complete the sandy portrait of the 62-year-old lead singer and co-founder of the Rolling Stones. 

 Ive had to touch him up several times already because of the rain. Lots of people want to take photos, said sand sculptor Isaac Soladade, 33, as he worked with his scalpel under the palm trees.

 Old mother

Family members said the delivery at Mercy Medical Centre went smoothly on Friday, despite earlier concerns about the mothers health.

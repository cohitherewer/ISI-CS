 Gaza violence

 Beit Lahiya, Gaza, July 6 (Reuters): Israeli forces today killed 13 Palestinians in air strikes and clashes with militants in the worst violence since the Jewish state quit Gaza Strip a year ago.

 Gunmen also killed an Israeli soldier. Prime Minister Ehud Olmert ordered tanks to push deeper into Gaza overnight after Hamas militants fired rockets into an Israeli city for the first time.

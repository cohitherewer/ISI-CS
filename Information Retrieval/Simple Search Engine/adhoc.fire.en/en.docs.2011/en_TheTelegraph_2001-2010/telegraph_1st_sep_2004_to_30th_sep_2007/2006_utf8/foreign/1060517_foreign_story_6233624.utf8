 Right not happy with Bush migrant plan

 Washington, May 16 (Reuters): President George W. Bush yesterday declared that the US-Mexico border was broken and he would deploy up to 6,000 National Guard troops there, but he said millions of illegal immigrants should be given a chance to become citizens.

 Bush, stepping into the emotionally charged issue in a rare prime time Oval Office address, spoke under pressure from conservative allies to take tougher steps against illegal immigration and after big protests demanding immigrant rights.

 Despite progress, we do not yet have full control of the border, and I am determined to change that, Bush said in a speech timed to get out in front of a US Senate debate on an immigration overhaul.

 But to the chagrin of conservatives demanding only tougher border enforcement, Bush also insisted on a temporary guest-worker programme for illegal immigrants that would give them a path to eventual US citizenship if they pay a fine, pay taxes, learn English and show they are employed.

 He ruled out a mass deportation of an estimated 12 million illegal immigrants in the country. We must face the reality that millions of illegal immigrants are already here, Bush said. They should not be given an automatic path to citizenship.

 White House officials said that up to 6,000 National Guard troops would support US Border Patrol agents in duties like surveillance, analysing intelligence and building patrol roads.

 While they will be armed, they will not conduct patrols. The US is not going to militarise the southern border. Mexico is our neighbour and our friend, Bush said.

 But in Mexico, Geronimo Gutierrez Fernandez, foreign ministry undersecretary for North America, said: Even though the Mexican government has been assured the announced measures do not imply the militarisation of the border, we must express our concern that these actions are still not accompanied by sufficient advances in the legislative process.

 The US Senate is set to debate this week a sweeping immigration overhaul that would couple tougher border enforcement with a guest-worker plan.

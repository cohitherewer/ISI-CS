The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Pluto stays, books shaky

 Prague, Aug. 16 (AP): Earthlings, beware: Your neighbourhood is about to get much more crowded.

 The International Astronomical Union today proposed enlarging the worlds understanding of the solar system to encompass 12 planets instead of the traditional nine, changing what billions of schoolchildren have been taught for generations.

 But experts said that by the end of 2007, there could be dozens more.

 Theres a whole list of candidates knocking at the door, said Owen Gingerich, who chairs the planetary definition committee of the IAU, the arbiter of what is and isnt a planet.

 Dont get stuck on this number 12, because that wont last the whole of next year, he told reporters in Prague, where 2,500 of the worlds leading astronomers are considering a new definition for planets. By the end of next year, theres going to be more.

 The IAU says it has a watchlist of about a dozen potential candidates for planethood. Most would be known as plutons under a proposed new definition that would distinguish between the eight classical planets like Earth and Jupiter and Pluto, along with objects like it in the far reaches of the solar system beyond Neptune.

 Under the proposal, which will be voted on next week, Pluto would remain a planet but would be known as a pluton. Joining it on the list of planets would be three other plutons: Plutos largest moon, Charon; 2003 UB313, or Xena, the farthest-known object in the solar system; and the asteroid Ceres, which was a planet in the 1800s before it was demoted.

 Critics, including 2003 UB313 discoverer Michael Brown of the California Institute of Technology, contend the new classification would be ungainly and admit objects to the planetary club that dont belong because of their small size and mass or other factors.

 Science wouldnt be science if you didnt have a diversion of opinions, conceded IAU president Ronald D. Ekers.

 Defending the proposal, Richard Binzel of Massachusetts Institute of Technology said the IAU was considering all points of view to forge a reasonable and workable compromise based on sound science.

 There could be hundreds of plutons. But thats fine, because we have this new way of classifying them, said Binzel. We have to let the solar system be the solar system.

 The proposal: A planet is any round object larger than 800 kilometres in diameter that orbits the sun and has a mass at least about 1/12,000th that of Earth.

 Roundness is key, experts said, because it indicates an object has enough self-gravity to pull itself into a spherical shape. Yet Earths moon would not qualify because the two bodies common centre of gravity lies below the surface of the Earth. Pluto and Charon would because their centre of gravity lies in the space between them.

 As more objects are discovered, the lack of a complete definition of a planet has become increasingly confusing, Ekers said today. The proposal would help settle the endless bickering among astronomers about the significance of their finds.

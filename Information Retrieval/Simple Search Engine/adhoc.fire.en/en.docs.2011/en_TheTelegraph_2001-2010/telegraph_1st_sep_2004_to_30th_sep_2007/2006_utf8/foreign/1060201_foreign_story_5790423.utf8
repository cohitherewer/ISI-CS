 Japan wives tale 

 Tokyo, Jan. 31 (Reuters): A group of Japanese men hoping to encourage the nations legions of workaholic husbands to head home early and show their wives some appreciation have proclaimed Tuesday Beloved Wives Day.

 The group, which calls itself the Japan Doting Husbands Association, urged men to get home by 8 pm and say thanks to their wives for all they do.

 Many men cant put their feelings of gratitude towards their wives into words. Work is number one for them, the non-profit group says on its website, http://www.aisaika.org.

 This attitude is putting Japanese marriages under great pressure.

 Statistics bear this out. Japans divorce rate has risen steadily over the years. In 2004, more than one in three marriages ended in divorce.

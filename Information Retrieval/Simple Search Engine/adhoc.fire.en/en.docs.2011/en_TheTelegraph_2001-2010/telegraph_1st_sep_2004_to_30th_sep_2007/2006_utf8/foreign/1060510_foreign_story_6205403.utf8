 Life in jail for cannibal

 Frankfurt, May 9 (Reuters): A German court today handed down a life sentence for murder to Armin Meiwes, the German cannibal jailed for killing a man and feeding on his flesh, overturning a previous manslaughter conviction.

 Meiwes, 44, was on trial for the second time after Germanys top criminal court ruled his 2004 conviction was too lenient. 

 Meiwes severed the penis of computer engineer Bernd-Juergen Brandes in a bizarre pact hatched over the Internet. After heavy bleeding, Brandes finally fell unconscious.

 Believing him to be dead, Meiwes froze parts of the body and ate some of it.

 US bar on rights panel

 John Bolton: Firm

 United Nations, Feb. 27 (Reuters): The US today called a compromise proposal for a new UN Human Rights Council unacceptable and said it would vote against it unless negotiations were reopened.

 We are very disappointed with the draft that was produced last Thursday. We dont think its acceptable, US ambassador John Bolton said. He said his instructions were to reopen negotiations and to try and correct the manifold deficiencies in the text of the resolution, or alternatively to push off consideration of the resolution for several months to give us more time.

 The new council would replace the discredited Geneva-based Human Rights Commission, where a number of rights-violating nations have seats. The US had submitted proposals calling for a smaller council and more restrictions on admitting members.

 Bolton said that if UN General Assembly president Jan Eliasson, who drew up the compromise proposal after months of negotiations, insisted on a vote this week, the US would vote no.

 The US does not have a veto in the 191-member General Assembly, so it depends whether a vote would be called for over US objections.

 New negotiations could result in a line-by-line debate of the text. Supporters of the resolution, which include major human rights groups, fear this would open the door to opponents of a new council and produce a deadlock.

 Tigers snub Lanka

 Colombo, June 9 (Reuters): Sri Lankan government delegates prepared to return today from talks in Oslo without meeting Tamil Tiger rebels as mediator Norway asked if the two sides stood by their ceasefire and a senior rebel warned of war.

 The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam blindsided Norwegian diplomats yesterday by refusing to meet a Sri Lankan government team for talks about the safety and operation of the 57-member Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission. The LTTE did not turn up ? I guess one had to come back, deputy head of the government peace secretariat Kethesh Loganathan said. But as far as the government is concerned, the peace option remains on the table all the time.

 The rebels demanded the withdrawal of monitors from European Union countries, which last month listed them as terrorists. That would remove the missions Swedish head and leave it with only 20 staff from non-EU states Norway and Iceland. The government wants the EU nations to stay.

 More than 400 people have been killed since early April as the Tigers pulled out of peace talks and the ceasefire collapsed into a low-intensity conflict, with fears rising of a return to full scale war.

 The Tigers, who want a separate Tamil homeland in the islands north and east, are sticklers for hierarchy and refused to meet the delegation because it contained no Sri Lankan ministers.

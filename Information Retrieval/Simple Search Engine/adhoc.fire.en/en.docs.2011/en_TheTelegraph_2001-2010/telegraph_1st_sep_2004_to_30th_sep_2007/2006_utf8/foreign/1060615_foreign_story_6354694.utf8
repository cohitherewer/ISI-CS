 Jolie baby in fashion statement

 Jolie: T-shirt fever

 Denver, June 14 (AP): Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitts baby has made what may be her first fashion statement, appearing on the cover of People magazine in a $42 T-shirt sold by a Denver boutique ? and triggering a tidal wave of orders.

 Belly, a shop in Denvers Cherry Creek district, sent Jolie one of the T-shirts and some maternity clothes in January. It was not immediately clear whether the shirt in the cover photo was the one sent by Belly.

 Everyones claiming that theyre responsible for sending them their gift package because they want publicity, the shirts designer, Kingsley Aarons, told USA Today. 

 Obviously, if she wore something of ours, that would be awesome, Belly employee Janci Clawson told the Rocky Mountain News in yesterdays editions. But it was more of a thank you to Angelina for doing so much for women and children around the world.

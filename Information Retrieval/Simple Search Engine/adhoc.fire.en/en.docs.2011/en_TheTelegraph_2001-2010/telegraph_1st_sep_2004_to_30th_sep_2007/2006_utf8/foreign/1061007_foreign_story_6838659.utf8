 YSL falls on Paris road

 Paris, Oct. 6 (Reuters): Fashion recluse Yves Saint Laurent fell in a Paris street today and lay motionless in the road for several minutes surrounded by aides until emergency services arrived to help him, video footage showed.

 A spokeswoman at the Yves-Saint-Laurent Foundation said the 70-year-old designer did not have a heart attack. He just missed the curb, dropping into his car, and he fell, she said, declining to give her name. Hes fine.

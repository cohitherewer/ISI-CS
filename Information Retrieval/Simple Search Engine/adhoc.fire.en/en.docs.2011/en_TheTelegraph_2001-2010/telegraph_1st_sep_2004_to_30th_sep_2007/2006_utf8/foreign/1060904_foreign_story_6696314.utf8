 Single mom fury on Blair

 Blair: Mothers rage

 London, Sept. 3 (Reuters): Young, single mothers in London are fuming at comments by British Prime Minister Tony Blair that their children run a high risk of turning into delinquents without help from the state.

 It is unfair, they argue, to blacklist a child or even an unborn baby just because his or her parents are unwed teenagers rather than a well-to-do married couple.

 A welfare expert agreed, saying that the remarks by Blair, who this week embarks on a regional tour to tackle social exclusion, were probably made without proper consideration.

 The Prime Minister said on Thursday that the government should intervene early possibly even before birth to stop the children of problem families growing up into troublemakers. He singled out unmarried, teenage mothers who were not in a stable relationship as his prime target.

 Victoria Clarke, 23, who lives in a local authority flat in southeast London, fell pregnant with her first baby when she was 17 and is expecting her third child in November.

 Unmarried but in a long-term relationship with the father of her children, she ridiculed Blairs ideas. Tony Blair is talking rubbish. We have got more than enough experience to bring up our children properly, Clarke said, as she pushed Megan, aged five, and two-year-old Ronnie in a buggy.

 Some people have a good background and still grow up to take drugs, she said, emphasising that she tried to instill good values into her young family.

 Her friend, Danielle Richards, also 23 and from southeast London, agreed. Richards like her mother before her became pregnant with her first child at 16 and now has two healthy girls with her long-term boyfriend. I think Tony Blair should try to look at himself. His own son got into trouble for drinking alcohol, she said.

 Richards was referring to an incident in 2000 when the Prime Ministers oldest son, Euan, then 16, was arrested after a night of under-age drinking in Londons West End.

 It is not all about coming from a privileged background, she said. Sometimes, the tougher your upbringing the more you want your own kids to succeed.

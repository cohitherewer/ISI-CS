 Fever fear

 Milan, Sept. 10 (Reuters): When Italian health officials came to remove a woman from the apartment she has not left in more than two decades, they had to don respirators against the stench.

 The woman, in her late 50s, weighed about 30 kg and had seven-foot-long hair when she was taken to hospital. The officials found the apartments windows sealed with adhesive tape and the shutters jammed shut.

 A bout of influenza 26 years ago terrified Carmela so much that she tried to seal herself off from germs by barricading herself in her home, newspapers said. 

 Flag nest 

 Eau Claire, Wisconsin (AP): Groundskeepers 

 at Forest Hill Cemetery thought it was kids who were stealing 

 dozens of US flags. That is, until one found a giant squirrels 

 nest. I was mowing, looked up out into the distance, 

 and something caught my eye, said a groundskeeper. 

 He reached a nearby tree and looked up. Lo and behold, 

 I found the missing flags. They were ripped and serving 

 as the foundation of a giant squirrel nest.

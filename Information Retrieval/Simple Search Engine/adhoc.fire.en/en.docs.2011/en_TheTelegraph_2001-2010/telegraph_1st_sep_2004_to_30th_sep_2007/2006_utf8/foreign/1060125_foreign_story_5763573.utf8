 US torture outsourced

 Strasbourg (France), Jan. 24 (Reuters): The US flew detainees to other countries where they would be tortured and European governments probably knew about it, the head of a European investigation into the controversy said today.

 But Swiss senator Dick Marty said in a report for the Council of Europe human rights watchdog that he had found no irrefutable evidence to confirm allegations that the CIA operated secret detention centres in Europe.

 There is a great deal of coherent, convergent evidence pointing to the existence of a system of relocation or outsourcing of torture, Marty told the 46-nation council.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 For some, arousal is a pain

 Paris, March 24 (AFP): A health journal today describes a newly-identified syndrome affecting women ? non-stop sexual arousal that can last for months and cannot be satisfied regardless of the number of orgasms.

 The paper, which appears in the International Journal of Sexually-Transmitted Diseases and AIDS, tentatively calls it persistent sexual arousal syndrome, or PSAS.

 It seems to affect only a small minority of women but the true extent is unclear. The study says that, despite the sniggering or smart remarks this condition may cause, the state of endless arousal can cripple a womans life.

 Sometimes embarrassing and often humiliating, the condition is unwanted because it occurs in the absence of genuine sexual interest. 

 PSAS is a distressing and perplexing condition, say the authors, David Goldmeir of St Marys Hospital in London and Sandra Leiblum of the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in New Jersey.

 Women with this clinical experience find the symptoms unwelcome since the genital arousal is usually persistent, unprovoked and unrelieved by orgasm. 

 Indeed, women with persistent genital arousal report a high degree of psychological distress and even suicidal thoughts.

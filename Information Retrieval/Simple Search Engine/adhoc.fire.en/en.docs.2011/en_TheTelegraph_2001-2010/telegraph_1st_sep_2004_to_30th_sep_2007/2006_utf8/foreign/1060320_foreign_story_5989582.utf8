 Fine Print

 Naughty Nicole

 Los Angeles, March 19 (AP): Nicole Richie irritated a local family during the taping of The Simple Life by asking an 11-year-old boy, in graphic language, if she looked attractive.

 The boy was playing when Richie, pushing a baby carriage, approached and asked him how she looked, using a profane word. Camera operators taped the exchange. The boys father refused to give the right to use the clip and lodged a complaint. 

 Bloom blow

 Tokyo (Reuters): Little is as important in the Japanese 

spring than knowing when cherry trees will bloom. Last years prediction 

was off by four days, leaving the Met office red faced. Stung by a storm of criticism, 

it has revised its forecasting model to predict when the delicate pink flowers, 

a national obsession, will emerge.

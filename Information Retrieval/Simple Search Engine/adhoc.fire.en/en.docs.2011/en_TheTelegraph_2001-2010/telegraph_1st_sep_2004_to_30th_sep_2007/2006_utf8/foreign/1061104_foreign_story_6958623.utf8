 Saddam trial 

Baghdad, Nov. 3 (Reuters): Three years after 

he gave himself up to American soldiers, Saddam Hussein may be condemned to hang 

on Sunday if an Iraqi court finds him guilty of crimes against humanity.

 Saddam, 69, has been charged with crimes against humanity for the killing of 148 Shia villagers after an attempt on his life in the town of Dujail in 1982. If convicted, Saddam faces death by hanging, a prospect Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki says cannot come soon enough.

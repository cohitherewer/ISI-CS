 Forever young Dylan

 Dylan: No birthday plans

 New York, May 23 (Reuters): Bob Dylan has announced no plans for his 65th birthday tomorrow, but around the world and in the hometown he couldnt wait to escape, the musician who has insistently resisted labels will be celebrated as the voice of a generation.

 Dylans spokesman, Elliott Mintz, responded to questions about Dylans birthday and touring plans by saying only that he had passed along the inquiry.

 But a new compilation book of Dylan interviews has been published for the occasion, radio stations from Norway to Australia will air salutes, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has mounted a special exhibit and in his hometown of Hibbing, Minnesota, residents are baking cakes in hopes he may return.

 The singer-songwriter who is also an author, filmmaker, actor and, most recently, radio disc-jockey has changed his name, religion and musical styles along the way. He has sometimes shocked his fans but always kept them guessing, while writing culture-changing songs like Blowin in the Wind and Like a Rolling Stone.

 May you stay forever young was his fond wish for his audience, and He not busy being born is busy dying his credo. At retirement age, with hundreds of songs and nearly 50 albums behind him, he is still constantly touring, with a European swing about to begin. I dont see why you cant last as long as you want to last, he is quoted as saying in Bob Dylan, The Essential Interviews, edited by Jonathan Cott. All I can do is be me ? whoever that is, he says. The book traces Dylans progress from a kid besotted with 1950s rock roll to a young folkie who gave voice to the anti-war, anti-racism youth movement of the 1960s. He quickly renounced the title protest singer and became a rocker on a personal exploration of Christianity and Judaism.

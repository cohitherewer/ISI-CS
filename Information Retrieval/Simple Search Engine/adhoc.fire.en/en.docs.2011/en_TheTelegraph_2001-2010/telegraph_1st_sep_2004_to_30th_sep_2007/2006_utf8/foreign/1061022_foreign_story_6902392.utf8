 Navy clash with Tigers again at sea

 Colombo, Oct. 21 (Reuters): The Sri Lankan navy destroyed two Tamil Tiger boats today off an island in the countrys restive north, killing six rebels, a naval spokesman said, the second military engagement at sea in less than 24 hours.

 Yesterday, the navy destroyed seven Tamil Tiger craft in a major sea battle, killing at least 35 rebels off the northern Jaffna peninsula.

 The latest clash took place near the government-controlled Kytes island off the Tamil-dominated peninsula after navy patrol boats spotted rebel craft approaching the island. All six LTTE members on board were killed, Commander D.K.P. Dassanayake said.

 Sri Lanka has seen a surge in violence in the past few months, raising doubts about the success of peace talks between the government and the LTTE in Geneva on October 28-29.

 Pro-rebel website www.tamilnet.com said the LTTE denied suffering casualties and that rebel boats had damaged two navy attack boats. It said the rebels were attacked first by the navy.

 On Wednesday, the rebels launched a sea-borne suicide raid on a naval base in the southern city of Galle.

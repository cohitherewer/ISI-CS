 Milosevic body

 Amsterdam, March 15 (Reuters): The body of Slobodan Milosevic was flown to Serbia today for burial in his home town, almost five years after the former Yugoslav President was sent to The Hague to stand trial for war crimes.

 Milosevic died of a heart attack in jail just months before an expected verdict. It was unclear whether his widow Mira Markovic, dubbed Lady Macbeth for her powerful influence on her husband, would attend the funeral because she would face a court hearing and confiscation of her passport if she returns to Serbia.

 Milosevic will be buried on Saturday in his hometown of Pozarevac, 80 km east of Belgrade, Uros Suvakovic, a senior official of his Socialist Party, said.

 A Russian doctor sent from Moscow to check the results of the Dutch autopsy said today he was satisfied Milosevic died of a heart attack but that he could have been saved if he had been allowed to travel to Moscow for specialist treatment. Belgrade has refused a state funeral for Milosevic.

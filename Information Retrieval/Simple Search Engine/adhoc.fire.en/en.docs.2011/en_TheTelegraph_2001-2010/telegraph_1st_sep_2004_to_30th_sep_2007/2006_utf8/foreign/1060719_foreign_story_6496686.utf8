 Night risks all for Water

 New York, July 18 (Reuters): M. Night Shyamalan left Disney when the studio refused to make his new movie Lady in the Water, based on his own fairytale. Now the director of The Sixth Sense is risking his reputation on the movie, and some critics are scratching their heads and wondering why.

 Lady in the Water, to be released on Friday by Warner Bros., is based on a bed-time story Shyamalan made up for his two young daughters. But his fairy tale, also published as a childrens book, has already cost him dearly. When the 35-year-old director presented his vision to Disney, which produced his four previous films, the studio said the story was too confusing.

 Disney executives also questioned Shyamalans decision to act in a pivotal supporting role rather than take his usual Hitchcockian cameo. But Shyamalan refused to compromise his vision, instead parting with a studio which grossed more than $1.5 billion on his last four films.

 Disney has downplayed the split, saying: We have a terrific relationship with Night, and although we didnt agree creatively on this particular project, we look forward to working with him in the future. The films problems are negative early reviews. Hollywood Reporter called the film waterlogged. Despite all that, the India-born Shyamalan who was raised in a Philadelphia suburb, stressed how important this project was to him, both professionally and personally. Whatever happens, Ive never got more joy out of a story, he said. I dont know why.

 But all the criticism appears to fuel Shyamalans desire for Lady in the Water to succeed. 

 The director said he feels so strongly about his latest work, that he would trade all his earlier success for this film to succeed. This film represents more about things that are life and death to me ... more of a manifesto of my beliefs, he said. One day there will be that one (movie) that doesnt connect, Shyamalan said, adding that if he ever makes a movie, that doesnt mean anything to the audience, I will have to go back and reflect on that.

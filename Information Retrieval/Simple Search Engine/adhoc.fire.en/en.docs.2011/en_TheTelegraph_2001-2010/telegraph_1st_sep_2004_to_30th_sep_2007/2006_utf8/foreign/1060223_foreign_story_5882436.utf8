 Heart feat

 London, Feb. 22 (Reuters): Surgeons may soon be able to operate on a beating heart using software that synchronises its pumping action with the movement of robotic surgical tools, New Scientist magazine reported today. 

 In traditional bypass surgery, the heart is usually stopped and an artificial pump used to keep the blood flowing around the body. 

 The new software, used with a robot called da Vinci, uses a two-camera endoscope that feeds images to the surgeon. At the same time, it tracks the heart beat and instructs the robots instruments to move with the heart movement.

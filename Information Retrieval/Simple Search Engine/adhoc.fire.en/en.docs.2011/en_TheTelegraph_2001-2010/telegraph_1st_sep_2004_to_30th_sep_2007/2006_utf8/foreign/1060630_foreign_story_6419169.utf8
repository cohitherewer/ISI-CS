 Kuwait, June 29 (Reuters): Kuwaitis voted for a new parliament today with women running and casting ballots for the first time in a national poll in the Gulf Arab state.

 I dont know how to describe my feelings, I am so happy, its a beautiful day as women practice their right, female candidate Hind al-Shaikh said. I hope a woman makes it. Parliament passed a law in May 2005 giving women the right to vote and stand in elections for the 50-seat National Assembly of the oil-producing country.

 Officials said about 250 candidates are standing, including 28 women determined to make headway despite daunting odds of beating seasoned male opponents, many of whom are former parliamentarians seeking re-election.

 Men and women braved the scorching summer heat in the desert state, voting in separate stations across the conservative state as Islamists, who reject female suffrage, had demanded.

 Campaigners handed out to voters roses or water bottles with candidates photos printed on them. Some wore scarves with candidates pictures.

 The participation of women has added a new spirit to the march of democracy in Kuwait, Prime Minister Sheikh Nasser al-Mohammad al-Sabah said during a visit to a polling station.

 I feel I am going to cry of happiness because its a historic moment for Kuwait ... I hope a woman can make it, said Diaa al-Saad, 55, one of the first women to vote in Jabriya. Experts say female candidates have a slim chance given their political inexperience.

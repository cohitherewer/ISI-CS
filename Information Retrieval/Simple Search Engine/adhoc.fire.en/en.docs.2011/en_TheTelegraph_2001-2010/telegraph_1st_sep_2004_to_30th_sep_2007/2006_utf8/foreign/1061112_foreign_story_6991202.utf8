 Pope to meet Turk cleric

 Vatican City, Nov. 11 (AP): Pope Benedict XVI will meet with an Islamic cleric who was among the first Muslim officials to denounce him for his remarks on Islam and violence, the Vatican said today in announcing details of the pontiffs upcoming trip to Turkey.

 Immediately after arriving in Ankara, Turkeys capital, Benedict will visit the mausoleum of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of the modern, secular Turkish state. 

 A week ago, thousands of nationalist Turks demonstrated there, vowing to defend Turkeys secular government against radical Islamic influences while urging their political leaders not to make too many concessions to gain EU membership.

 Benedict will meet Turkeys President for religious affairs, Ali Bardakoglu, a top Islamic cleric. Bardakoglu was among the first prominent Muslim figures and one of the most vehement to denounce Benedict for the September 12 speech in which Benedict quoted a Byzantine emperors remarks about Islam and violence. 

 Benedict has since expressed regret that the remarks caused offence and has stressed they did not reflect his personal opinion. He has also expressed esteem for Islam.

 Bardakoglu had called the Popes remarks in the September 12 speech extraordinarily worrying, saddening and unfortunate.

 The pontiff will also meet Turkeys deputy Premier. Turkeys Prime Minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has already said he will not be meeting the Pope because he will be attending a Nato summit in Latvia but denied he was trying to avoid an encounter with the pontiff.

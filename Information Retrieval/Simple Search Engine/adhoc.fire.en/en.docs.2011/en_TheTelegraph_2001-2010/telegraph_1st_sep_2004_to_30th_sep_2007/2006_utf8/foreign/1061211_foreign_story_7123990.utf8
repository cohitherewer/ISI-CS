 Iran gains most from Iraq war

 Ahmadinejad: Scoring a point

 Paris, Dec. 10: The report issued last week by the blue-ribbon Iraq Study Group provides fresh proof of Irans strengthened hand in West Asia since the US-led invasion: It mentions the Islamic Republic more than 50 times and makes clear that the US will have to seek Irans help for any resolution.

 The report told the Iranians, You are mighty now in the region and in Iraq. The Iranians feel now they are untouchable, said Mustafa Alani, director of security and terrorism studies at the Gulf Research Center, an independent think tank in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

 The Bush administration no longer has much leverage to stop Iran from pursuing uranium enrichment, diplomats and analysts said. And the price of cooperation, Alani said, will be very high.

 They are looking for a grand bargain that includes the nuclear issue, recognition of their influence and position in Iraq, and their position in the balance of power in the region, he said.

 Far from spreading democracy through the region, the Iraq war has strengthened a theocracy in which unelected religious figures make many of the crucial decisions.

 So far, Iran won the Iraq war, said George Perkovich, the vice-president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. They gained the most by far.

 He said the US hand was already weak on the nuclear issue because of Russias reluctance to go along with sanctions against the Islamic Republic. But the report makes clear that Iran has substantial leverage in any negotiation, he said, because of Irans importance in helping to quell the civil war in Iraq. We have to deal with reality, Perkovich said.

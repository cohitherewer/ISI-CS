 Iraq victory

 Baghdad, Jan. 20 (Reuters): Iraqs Shia Islamists were confirmed in power by election results today that gave them a near-majority and paved the way for negotiations to begin on a national unity government promoted by the US.

 Despite angry reactions to the rejection of their complaints about the December 15 vote, many Sunni political leaders are already discussing places in a grand coalition government and talks are expected to start shortly with Shia and Kurdish groups.

 The US ambassador joined calls for Iraqs sectarian and ethnic communities to come together after the results to form a government of national unity. 

 The final results, which parties have two days to challenge, gave the Shia Islamist Alliance 128 seats, 10 short of retaining the slim majority it enjoyed last year in the Sunni-boycotted interim Assembly. The main Kurdish bloc won 53 seats, down sharply, while the two main Sunni groupings shared 55 seats ? winning 44 and 11 places respectively.

 Sex versus century

 London, Sept. 22 (Reuters): A large number of Britons would be prepared to give up sex if it meant they would live to be 100, according to a survey.

 The Mori research found that 40 per cent would pass on the passion for longevity, though far more women (48 per cent) were ready to make the sacrifice than men (31 per cent).

 Nearly 94 per cent would not give up their friends or family to reach their century while a half thought scientists should keep trying to prolong peoples lifespans.

 A healthcare provider did the survey as part of a debate on the implications of an aging population.

 Britain is facing an aging time bomb with major challenges presented by retirement, the desire to live longer and the increasing burden of caring for older people, said the healthcare providers medical director.

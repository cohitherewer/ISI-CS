 Heather to sue UK papers over divorce

 London, Oct. 24 (Reuters): Heather Mills McCartney is to sue two newspapers over false, damaging and immensely upsetting statements over her divorce battle with former Beatle Paul McCartney, her lawyers said today.

 The lawyers said Heather charity campaigner had been vilified in the media and was being stalked by photographers. One of the most high-profile divorce cases in showbusiness history turned bitterly acrimonious last week when legal papers were leaked.

 The document contained allegations that Paul mistreated his wife during their tempestuous four-year marriage. Lawyers Mishcon de Reya named the Daily Mail and the Evening Standard as the subject of legal proceedings. Legal action will also be taken shortly against the Sun tabloid.

 Mishcon de Reya said Mills could not afford to sue all the newspapers she wanted to. Her time and resources are not infinite. She cannot sue every single newspaper that has published false and damaging statements about her, they said in a statement.

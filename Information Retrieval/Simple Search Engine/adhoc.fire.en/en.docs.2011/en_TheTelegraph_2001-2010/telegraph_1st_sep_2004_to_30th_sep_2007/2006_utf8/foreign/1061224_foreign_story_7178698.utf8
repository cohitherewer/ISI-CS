 Christmas hostages

 London, Dec. 23 (AFP): A feisty great-grandmother held four builders hostage after they told her improvement work on her home would not be finished by Christmas.

 Josie Medlock snapped when told the work would not be completed until the new year, scuppering her plans to invite 14 family members for a Christmas Day meal, British papers said.

 The 59-year-old widow barricaded the front door of her home in Rotherham, northern England, and told the workers they would be free in time for Christmas only if they finished as promised. When police came, she reportedly told them: Im not going to hurt them. Im just making a point.

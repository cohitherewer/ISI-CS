 Lanka author, tourists killed

 Colombo, May 28 (Reuters): Six local tourists and their guide ? among them an award-winning author ? were killed by suspected Tamil Tiger landmines while tracking wild elephants in northwest Sri Lanka, officials said today.

 A separate group of Sri Lankan tourists in Wilpattu National Park in northwest Sri Lanka heard a large explosion in the sanctuary yesterday and discovered their jeep in a ditch and the body parts of the seven people strewn across the road.

 The army suspects the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), whose de facto state begins 65 km from the site of the blast, planted the pressure mines.

 We have only been able to identify four of them from their remains. All the bodies are in pieces, said military spokesman Brigader Prasad Samarasinghe. There were three landmines connected to each other so that they all went off together.

 We suspect it was the Tamil Tigers, he added. 

 It was the first time tourists have been killed by landmines inside a Sri Lankan national park, and comes amid a surge in attacks and clashes between the military and the rebels that some fear could spiral into all-out war.

 Samarasinghe said renowned Sri Lankan author Nihal de Silva, who wrote award-winning novel The Road From Elephant Pass, which is set during the islands civil war, was among the dead.

 The Tigers denied any hand in the incident. The LTTE has no involvement in this whatsoever, S. Puleedevan, head of the rebels Peace Secretariat, said by satellite telephone from the northern rebel base of Kilinochchi.

 This is a baseless accusation by the army, he added.This happened in government-controlled territory, not in our homeland.

 Wildlife Department Director General Dayananda Kariyawasam believes the mines were newly laid, because they were on a main road through the park that has been used regularly since it reopened in 2003, the year after a ceasefire halted a two-decade civil war that has killed more than 64,000.

 The park had been shut for 17 years because of the war.

 Samarasinghe said 18 trucks crossing from rebel to government-held territory were impounded further north on Sunday in a separate incident after small quantities of plastic explosives were found hidden in their bodywork.

 Analysts say the Tigers have focused recent attacks on the military and government officials, and have not traditionally targeted tourists during their armed struggle for a separate homeland for ethnic Tamils in the north and east.

 Norwegian International Development Minister Erik Solheim, who brokered Sri Lankas ceasefire and oversees mediation between the government and the Tigers, said on Friday he feared Sri Lanka could slide deeper into violence unless both sides start to make concessions.

 More than 270 soldiers, police, civilians and rebels have been killed in a rash of attacks from suicide bombings to naval clashes since February in what the truce monitors and Tigers now call alow intensity war.

 The European Union is poised to ban the Tigers as a terrorist group, and was expected to officially announce the proscription as early by Tuesday. The United States, Britain, India and Canada have already outlawed the rebels.

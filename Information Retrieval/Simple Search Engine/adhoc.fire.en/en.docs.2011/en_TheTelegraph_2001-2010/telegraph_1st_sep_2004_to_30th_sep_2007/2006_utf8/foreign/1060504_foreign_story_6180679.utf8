 Tsunami alert after 8.1 quake hits Tonga 

 Suva (Fiji), May 3 (Reuters): An earthquake measuring 8.1 hit the Tonga islands, the US Geological Survey (USGS) website said today and a tsunami warning was issued for Tonga, Fiji, New Zealand and other South Pacific states.

 The warning said it was not known if a tsunami had been generated by the quake but that any such wave would have hit Suva, Fiji, at 1713 GMT and Gisborne, New Zealand, at 1821 GMT.

 However, later tonight the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center cancelled the tsunami alert in a report on its website.

 The earthquake occured at 1526 GMT and was located at a depth of 16.1 km, a statement carried on the website, which is monitored in London, said. 

 A police officer in Tonga told Britains Sky Television it was the largest tremor for over 20 years but there were no immediate reports of damage. He said electricity went out but later returned.

 Another witness told Sky that the earthquake was felt in several islands and a resident of Tonga told Sky he felt tremors lasting over 30 seconds.

 Fiji radio in the capital Suva said there were no initial reports of a tsunami. 

 There have been no reports of any problems, but it is early in the morning said a reporter for Fijis FM96 radio station.

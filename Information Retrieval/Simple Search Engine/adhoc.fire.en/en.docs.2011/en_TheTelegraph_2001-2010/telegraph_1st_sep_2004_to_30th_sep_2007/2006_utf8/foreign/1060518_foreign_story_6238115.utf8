 William the caring

 William: Princely touch

 London, May 17: Prince William delayed his presentation of the FA Cup to the Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard so he could console a fan whose father had died in the Millennium Stadium during the match.

 Showing the kind of compassion for which his mother was renowned, the prince visited Gary Luckhurst in the medical centre at the Cardiff stadium and offered to help in any way he could.

 That was such a godsend for me, Luckhurst, 32, said yesterday. It gave me real strength while I was trying to come to terms with my fathers sudden death.

 He and his father, David, 50, both avid West Ham supporters, went to the match together on Saturday. But 20 minutes into the game, moments before West Ham took the lead, Luckhurst, collapsed and was pronounced dead soon afterwards. 

 Prince William, 23, the newly appointed president of the Football Association, learned of Luckhursts death as he passed the medical centre shortly before he was due to present the cup to the Liverpool team.

 Gary Luckhurst, an engineer, said: I saw two bodyguards standing outside the room and then Prince William walked in. He shook my hand, held my shoulder, and said: Im very sorry to hear about your father passing away.

 He added: This must be a very difficult time. Anything I can do to help, please feel free to ask.

 Luckhurst said the prince appeared genuinely upset. He added: The prince was with me for about 10 minutes, before his bodyguards tapped him on the shoulder and motioned to him to leave. It was a real sacrifice on his part and one I will always be grateful for, he said. I burst into tears the minute he left.

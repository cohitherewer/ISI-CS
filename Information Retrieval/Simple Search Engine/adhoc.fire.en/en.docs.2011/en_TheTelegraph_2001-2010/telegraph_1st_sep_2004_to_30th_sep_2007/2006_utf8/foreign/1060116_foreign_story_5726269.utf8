 Murder kept Elizabeth a virgin: BBC drama

 London, Jan. 15: Queen Elizabeth I died a virgin because her fathers murder of her mother left her with a lifelong fear of physical intimacy. 

 A new BBC1 drama, The Virgin Queen, which stars Anne-Marie Duff, will claim that the Tudor monarch was unable to consummate any of her relationships because of a string of childhood traumas which scarred her for life. The ?9-million four-part series depicts her as a woman haunted by the image of Henry VIII and unable to accept the circumstances of Anne Boleyns demise. 

 The decision to portray Elizabeth as a virgin is in stark contrast to other recent screen versions which have sought to debunk the myth of the virgin queen. 

 Last years Channel 4 drama Elizabeth depicted the queen and Earl of Leicester, as lovers. A sequel to the Hollywood film Elizabeth, starring Cate Blanchett, is expected to depict a sexual liaison with Sir Walter Raleigh, played by Clive Owen. 

 Paul Rutman, the producer of The Virgin Queen, said the new characterisation was based on thorough historical research. We are convinced on the basis of the available historical evidence that she died a virgin, he said. 

 Paula Milne, who wrote the screenplay, believes the queens public pronouncements about her virginity, although at times politically motivated, were the product of deep psychological wounds. 

 If I was asked to write a piece about a contemporary woman whose mother had been killed by her father, I would be expected to examine the psychological impact. 

 I think in those circumstances it was inevitable that Elizabeth would regard intimacy as a threat.

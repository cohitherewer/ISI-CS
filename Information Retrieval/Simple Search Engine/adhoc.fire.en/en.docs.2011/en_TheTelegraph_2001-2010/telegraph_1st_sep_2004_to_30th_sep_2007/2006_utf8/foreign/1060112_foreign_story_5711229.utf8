 Kathmandu, Jan. 11: Within days of ending their unilateral four-month-long ceasefire, Maoist rebels launched a major attack on Dhangadhi town, the district headquarters of Kailali district in western Nepal late this evening. 

 Reports reaching here said scores of heavily armed Maoists simultaneously attacked the district police office, a ward police office, the regional police office, the Unified Command (police and army) barracks, Sukhkhad base camp, a Nepal Rastriya Banks branch office and other government buildings in Dhangadhi.

 The rebels exploded bombs and in retaliation the security forces exchanged fire for about half an hour. Both the sides have reported casualties, but the exact figures remain unclear, security sources said. 

 Of the 25 policemen in the ward police office, only 15 were in contact till last reports came in, the sources said.

 Unconfirmed reports said seven security personnel had been killed in the incident.

 According to the sources, around 10 pm, the Maoists attacked the district jail and the district police office. They also looted some weapons from the ward police office.

 The rebels ended the truce on January 2 and since then at least six people have been killed and more than a dozen wounded in a string of attacks before todays strike.

 While calling off the truce, the Maoists had indicated they would go on the offensive to defend themselves against government forces.

 The unilateral ceasefire that was extended once under popular pressure came to an end as the King Gyanendra-led regime did not match it.

 The King, who seized power nearly a year ago from the elected government, believes the rebels use ceasefire as a camouflage to regroup.

 The royal army is surrounding our Peoples Liberation Army, which is in defensive positions, to carry out ground as well as air attacks on us, the rebels had said.

 Therefore, we are compelled to go on the offensive not only for the sake of peace and democracy but for the sake of self-defence, Prachanda, the Maoist chief, said.

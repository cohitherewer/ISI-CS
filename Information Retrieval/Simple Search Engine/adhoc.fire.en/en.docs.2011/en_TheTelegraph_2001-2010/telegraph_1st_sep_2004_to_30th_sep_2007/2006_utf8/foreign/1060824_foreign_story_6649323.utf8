 Moscow, Aug. 23 (AP): Russias 

 space agency announced yesterday that US entrepreneur Anousheh 

 Ansari will fly to the international space station next 

 month, becoming the first woman to make a paid voyage to 

 the station, news agencies reported.

 On Monday, officials said Japanese businessman Daisuke Enomoto, who was to blast off for the ISS on September 14, had failed a medical test. Roskosmos space agency officials could not immediately be reached for comment.

 Ansari, born in Iran, is a co-founder of the Texas-based company Telecom Technologies Inc.

 The space flight takes off from Russias manned launch facility in Baikonur, Kazakhstan, and includes Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Tyurin and US astronaut Miguel Lopez-Alegria. Ansari is to return to Earth 10 days later with Pavel Vinogradov and Jeff Williams, who have been aboard the space station since April 1.

 Lunar vehicle

 The name of the new vehicle that Nasa hopes returns astronauts to the moon was supposed to be kept hush until an announcement next week. 

 But apparently US astronaut Jeff Williams, floating 350 km above Earth at the international space station, did not get the memo.

 Weve been following the crew exploration vehicle for several years but today it has a name Orion, Williams said yesterday, taping a message in advance for the space agency that was transmitted accidentally over space-to-ground radio. 

 Nasa planned to reveal the new name on August 31, when the space agency also announces which contractor will build the vehicle.

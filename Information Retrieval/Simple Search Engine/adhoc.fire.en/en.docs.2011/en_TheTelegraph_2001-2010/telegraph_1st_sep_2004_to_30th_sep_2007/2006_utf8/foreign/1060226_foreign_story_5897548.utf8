 Coup men grilled, Manila paper raided

 Manila, Feb. 25 (Reuters): Suspected coup plotters were hauled in for questioning and the office of an Opposition newspaper was raided in the Philippines today, a day after President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo imposed a state of emergency.

 But Manilas streets were calm, in sharp contrast to the chaotic scenes 20 years ago to the day when one million people stood up to army tanks on the EDSA highway, forcing dictator Ferdinand Marcos to flee in a people power revolt.

 Arroyo, who survived a crisis last year over allegations of vote-rigging and corruption, invoked emergency rule yesterday, citing a systematic conspiracy against her by members of the Opposition, communists and military adventurists.

 (The) military has effectively crushed the plot but some people responsible for it are still out there, national police chief Arturo Lomibao told reporters today.

 Former police chief Ramon Montano and Leftist congressman Crispin Beltran were taken in for questioning. Lomibao said he had a list of other targets, with former senator Gregorio Honasan, hailed as a hero in the overthrow of Marcos, at the top.

 About a dozen army and air force lieutenants, who were recruited to take part in the coup, turned themselves in to senior commanders, in the first apparent admission that there was a plan to destabilise the Arroyo government.

 Many young officers have started surrendering for fear of getting arrested, said a senior general, who declined to be named, adding that the army was expanding its probe to pin down the masterminds and financiers of the plot.

 The military was on alert for street protests and arrests were expected to continue.

 Arroyo cited biased local reporting in her decision to invoke emergency rule and, before dawn today, police raided a pro-Opposition newspaper and troops were sent to watch over the countrys two main broadcasters.

 The Daily Tribunes editor said the newspaper would continue to publish despite police confiscating copies from the printing press and padlocking the office.

 They just swooped down, went inside, Ninez Cacho-Olivares, said on radio. This is like martial law. Police also went to the Abante tabloid but Elvira Altez, a member of its board, said the officers left after seeing crews from two television stations.

 The Presidents allies defended the newspaper raids as a legitimate step against attempts to incite unrest, but critics said it was reminiscent of martial law under Marcos.

 The National Union of Journalists called a news conference tomorrow to protest against the clampdown.

 There have been a dozen coup attempts in the last two decades, but some analysts say Arroyos government amplifies threats to ward off plotters and shore up public support.

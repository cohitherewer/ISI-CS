 Fine Print

 Cracked Jessica

 New York, Sept. 2 (AP): Jessica Simpson sang for the first time since injuring her vocal cords a week ago, but only made it through one song before her voice cracked.

 Simpson croaked her way through I Belong to Me on NBCs Today show yesterday morning, but when it came time to hit a high note on With You, her voice cracked. She paused for a moment and said: All right, I tried that one, before finishing the tune. That had to be the most nerve-racking thing youve ever done in your life, said Today co-host Matt Lauer.

 The 26-year-old singer tried to soothe her voice with a concoction that Lauer described as gnarly looking. Simpson said her vocal coach had made the nasty mixture.

 More Rush

 Montclair, New Jersey (AP): 

 After a five-year absence from movie screens, Chris Tucker 

 is about to begin shooting Rush Hour 3 with Jackie 

 Chan. But before the cameras roll, the 34-year-old motor-mouthed 

 comedian is squeezing in a 21-city standup tour, which began 

 June 11. It is his first official tour in nearly a decade. 

 Standup gets me warmed up for the movie, Tucker 

 said.

 Fear puts Baghdad under curfew

 Baghdad, Sept. 30 (Reuters): Iraqi forces placed Baghdad under a blanket curfew throughout the day after US troops arrested a man suspected of plotting to attack the capitals government compound with suicide car bombs.

 US troops arrested a security guard at the home of the leader of the main Sunni political bloc yesterday.

 The US military today said the man was suspected of planning attacks on the fortified Green Zone and may have been linked to al Qaida.

 Coalition force personnel detained an individual at the residence of Dr Adnan al-Dulaimi in Baghdad on September 29. The detained individual is suspected of involvement in the planning of a multi-vehicle suicide operation inside Baghdads International Zone, the military said.

 Dulaimi leads the Accordance Front, the largest Sunni bloc in parliament, which is also housed inside the sprawling Green Zone.

 A senior official in the Front named the arrested man as Khudhar Farhan and said he was in his mid-20s and had joined Dulaimis security staff about a month ago. 

 There was no official explanation for the curfew which emptied streets. A political source said it was linked to fears that security in the Green Zone had been compromised. Access for all but the top officials had been barred.

 The 5-sq km riverside compound once occupied by Saddam Hussein is home to thousands of people, including most senior officials and the US and British embassies.

 Another Iraqi official said the curfew was imposed in fear of more widespread unrest after a bloody first week of the holy month of Ramazan.

 In Washington, the US Congress voted to block the Bush administration from building permanent bases in Iraq or taking control of its oil sector.

 Palestine feud flares up

 Gaza, April 23 (Reuters): Tensions between the Hamas-led government and President Mahmoud Abbass Fatah faction flared into a shootout at the Palestinian health ministry today, despite pledges to calm an eruption of internal fighting.

 At least four people were wounded after gunmen from Fatahs al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades stormed into the ministry, where they were confronted by Hamas guards, health ministry officials said.

 An al-Aqsa spokesman denied the men were from his faction, saying they were from a Gaza clan affiliated with Fatah. 

 The guards from Hamass Izz el-Deen al-Qassam brigades chased off most of the Fatah intruders and captured four of the gunmen, tying them up and putting them into a police car as people in the street cheered, witnesses said.

 The time has passed when our institutions and our police can be attacked. Whoever holds a gun against one of our institutions, or one of our policemen, opens himself for death, interior ministry spokesman Khaled Abu Hillel said.

 In the West Bank city of Bethlehem, Israeli security forces killed a Palestinian after they fired on a vehicle carrying wanted men that did not stop. Palestinian security sources said the dead man was a member of the Palestinian security forces.

 About 20 people were hurt in armed confrontations in Gaza yesterday between students and militants from Fatah and Hamas. It was the most serious fighting between Palestinians since Hamas won a parliamentary election in January.

 The violence followed the condemnation by exiled Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal of Abbass veto of a new Gaza security force formed by the Islamic group and headed by a top militant.

 The appointment of Jamal Abu Samhadana, head of the Popular Resistance Committees which has often attacked Israel, as leader of the new Gaza police force was widely seen as an attempt by Hamas to strengthen its grip on the powerful interior ministry. Abbas cancelled the decision, a veto Meshaal said assisted a Western campaign to isolate the Palestinian government.

 Egyptian officials yesterday tried to mediate an end to the Hamas-Fatah violence. 

 Meshaal said after yesterdays violence that Hamas respected Abbass authority and called for Palestinian unity.

 The interior ministry said the new Gaza force would work from within the existing security establishment, headed mainly by Fatah loyalists. 

But Abbass aides said only the Palestinian President 

could make decisions regarding the government.

 Bush: Qaida plot thwarted

 Washington, Feb. 9 (Reuters): President George W. Bush today disclosed new details of a thwarted al Qaida plot to use shoe bombs to hijack a plane and fly it into a Los Angeles building, as he sought to justify his tactics in Washingtons war on terrorism.

 With critics questioning the legality of his authorisation of a domestic spying programme, Bush used newly declassified details of a previously disclosed plot to show that the threat of terrorism has not abated. Bush said that in early 2002, the US and its allies thwarted a plot to use bombs hidden in shoes to breach the cockpit door of an airplane and fly it into the the tallest building in Los Angeles.

 But he named the wrong building. We believe the intended target was Liberty Tower in Los Angeles, California, Bush said. White House aides later said he meant Library Tower.

 Library Tower is now known as US Bank Tower, but locally it is still mostly called by the former name because of its proximity to the citys central library. 

 Last October, the Bush administration had disclosed the plot to attack targets on the West Coast using hijacked planes, saying this was among 10 disrupted al Qaida plots.

 Bush said today that in October 2001, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the operational mastermind of the September 11 attacks that year, had set in motion a plot for another attack inside the US using shoe bombs to hijack an airplane and fly it into the tallest building on the US west coast.

 Rather than use Arab hijackers as he had on September 11, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed sought out young men from southeast Asia whom he believed would not arouse as much suspicion, Bush said. Mohammed was captured in Pakistan in March 2003. In his speech, Bush praised the efforts of Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf in fighting terrorism.

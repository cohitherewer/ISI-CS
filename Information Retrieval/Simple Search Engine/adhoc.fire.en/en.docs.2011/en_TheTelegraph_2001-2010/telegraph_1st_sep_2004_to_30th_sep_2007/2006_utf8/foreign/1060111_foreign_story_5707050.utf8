 US judge in kirpan ruling

 New York, Jan. 10 (PTI): Police at the Wayne State University in Detroit should not have arrested a Sikh student for carrying kirpans as it was part of his religious belief, a US judge has ruled.

 Sukhpreet Singh Garcha, 23, was arrested on August 14 by campus police for carrying a 10-inch knife on his hip and another 5-inch knife concealed in his waistband. 

 The religious group, United Sikhs, protested Garchas arrest, saying the kirpan is not a weapon, but rather an ornamental article of faith.

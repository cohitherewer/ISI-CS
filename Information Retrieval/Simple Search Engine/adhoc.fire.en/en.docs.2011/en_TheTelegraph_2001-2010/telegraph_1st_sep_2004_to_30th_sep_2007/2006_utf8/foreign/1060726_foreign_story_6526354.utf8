 Jihad to stay in Pak schools

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Islamabad, July 25: The Pakistan government has decided that jihad will continue to feature in its curricula for schoolchildren.

 Education minister Lieutenant General (retired) Javed Ashraf Qazi, a former chief of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), said jihad is an integral part of Islamic teachings and beliefs and would not be taken off the curricula, which is currently being reviewed. Jihad has many dimensions, which also includes self-negation, and we will teach students the full concept of jihad, he told reporters during a briefing on the draft of the new curricula for Classes I to XII.

 The draft has been sent to the provinces for recommendations and will be finalised after their proposals are considered, Qazi added. Under his enlightened moderation jargon, President Pervez Musharraf had ordered a review of the curricula and asked the academia to address the demands of cthe yber age.

 The review is part of the US-funded programme to cleanse textbooks of jihadist preaching. The Bush administration had begun pouring millions of dollars into the project soon after the fall of Afghanistans Taliban in December 2001. Ironically, the same country had spent about $35 million in the early 1980s to load the curricula in Afghanistan and Pakistan with jihadist teachings.

 Together with the ISI, it had also promoted the creation of hundreds of madarsas to indoctrinate people into jihad against the Russians who had invaded and occupied Afghanistan in December 1979.

 Yesterday, the US signed an agreement with Pakistan under which it would provide $62.7 million in 2006 to improve education in the country. Out of $62.7 million, $40 million will be spent on basic education ? focusing on school administration, teachers training, improvement of schools through parental and community involvement and construction of schools in tribal areas.

 While scientists like Pervez Hoodbhoy and A.H. Nayyar have been asking for a complete review of the science syllabi, civil society organisations have voiced concern over teaching hate materials.

 Dollar taboo

 Moscow, July 27 (Reuters): Russias economy minister German Gref today had to be rescued by cabinet colleagues from breaking a taboo: using the word dollar.

 Parliament is in the process of adopting a law that will fine ministers for saying dollar when they could have used rouble in a drive to restore pride in the national currency. 

 Briefing a televised cabinet meeting about new investment in the Siberian city of Tomsk, Gref said it was worth 30 million, and then hesitated and shuffled nervously through his notes before being prompted by a colleague.

 Gref regained his composure and said: Seven hundred million roubles. Thank you. Laughing nervously, he added: Thirty million not roubleson Saturday.

 Denpasar (Indonesia), Feb. 14 (Reuters): An Indonesian court today sentenced two young Australian men to die by firing squad for trying to smuggle heroin from Bali.

 The sentences matched what prosecutors had demanded for Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, the accused masterminds of a group of nine Australians arrested in Bali last April for trying to smuggle more than 8.2 kg of heroin to Australia.

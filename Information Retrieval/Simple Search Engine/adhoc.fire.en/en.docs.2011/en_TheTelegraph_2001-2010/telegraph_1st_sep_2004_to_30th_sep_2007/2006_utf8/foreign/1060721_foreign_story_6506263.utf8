 Officer amp; whore

 Wellington, July 20 (Reuters): A woman police officer moonlighting as a prostitute has got off with a caution, New Zealand police said today.

 The unidentified officer, stationed in the countrys biggest city Auckland, was discovered last year to have been a prostitute for a short time. The officer concerned has been counselled. Under police procedures this amounts to a censure, the police said.

 A spokesman for a welfare and lobby group for sex workers in Auckland said: We have law students that are sex workers, we have doctors that are sex workers. I mean anyone can be a sex worker.

 Annes role

 Pasadena, California (AP): Anne Heche 

 famously dated Steve Martin and survived a messy breakup 

 with Ellen DeGeneres before marrying her husband and having 

 a child. So perhaps its fitting that the 37-year-old 

 actress plays a relationship coach who settles in Alaska 

 in the new drama Men in Trees.

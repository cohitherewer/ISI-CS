The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Crack at US Muslim ceiling

 Ellison

 Minneapolis, Sept. 17 (Reuters): Keith Ellison, who could become the first Muslim to win a seat in the US Congress, is a former Catholic who says both religions and family roots in the civil rights movement shaped a fiery liberal philosophy.

 The chance to make history thrust the 43-year-old lawyer into the spotlight last week when he won the Democratic nomination to run for the US House of Representatives.

 Ellisons faith hardly came up in the campaign in a heavily Democratic district but his former ties to controversial Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan were discussed.

 Ellison said he had renounced Farrakhan and his group long ago because of their bigoted and anti-Semitic ideas. But the issue may not die down.

 His Republican rival, Alan Fine, said after the primary he was personally offended, as a Jew, that we have a candidate like this running for Congress.

 Fine called Ellison a follower of the known racist Farrakhan who is a person who believes that Jews are the scourge of the earth.

 Ellison told the the Jewish Community Relations Council of Minnesota and the Dakotas in a letter in May he got involved with Farrakhan 11 years ago because he cared about personal responsibility and self-sufficiency among black men.

 He said he wrongly dismissed concerns that Farrakhans views were anti-Jewish. They were and are anti-Semitic and I should have come to that conclusion earlier than I did.... At no time did I ever share their hateful views, he said.

 State Republican Frank Hornstein, who sat next to Ellison in the Minnesota state legislature, calls him a champion of human rights for all.

 As a Jew, I would always have concerns about Farrakhan, but I never felt Keith shared those views. It just never occurred to me that Keith Ellison would be hostile to the Jewish community or anti-Semitic, he said.

 Ellison worships at Masjid An-Nur, a mosque in Minneapolis that is undergoing a $1.5-million renovation to give it a dome and minaret.

 He was raised a Catholic in Detroit and converted to Islam while attending university. He says his strength and moral courage come from both religions. I am inspired by the Quorans message of an encompassing divine love and a deep faith life every day,Ellison said.

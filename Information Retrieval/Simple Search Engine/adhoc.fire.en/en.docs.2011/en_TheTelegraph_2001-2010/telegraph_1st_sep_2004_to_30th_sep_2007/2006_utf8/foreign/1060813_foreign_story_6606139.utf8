 Discarded liquid items end up as trash

 Atlanta, Aug. 12 (AP): 

 Loads of liquid goods discarded by airline passengers at 

 security checkpoints will end up in the trash, not in the 

 pockets of airport employees or others, officials at airports 

 across the country promised.

 No exceptions not even for cases of wine. 

 We had people throw away a whole case of wine, or try to drink their wine in line, said San Franciscos international airport duty manager Lily Wang.

 Airport security screeners scrambled to implement a new ban on all liquids and gels from lip gloss and toothpaste to perfume and tequila in carry-on luggage after British authorities announced on Thursday the arrest of 24 people in an alleged plot to blow up US-bound planes. Baby formula, prescription medication and essential non-prescription medication are still allowed.

 From Atlanta to Albuquerque, New Mexico, airport maintenance crews were ordered to dump any confiscated items along with the rest of the garbage.They seal it, they do not touch it, they dispose of it as they would other garbage, said Daniel Jiron, spokesman for the Albuquerque international airport. 

 All the waste irked some passengers. I know they have to do this, but I think they went overboard, said Terry Asbury, an Ohio resident who flew from Albuquerque to Cincinnati on Thursday and had to throw out her cosmetics. I literally lost about $50 or $60 worth of things we were told to throw out.

 Maoists threaten protests over polls

 Kathmandu, Sept. 2 (Reuters): Nepals Maoist rebels threatened today to launch street protests to press the multi-party government for early elections to an Assembly that would draw up a new constitution.

 The government is lingering. We cannot continue to remain in limbo like this, rebel spokesman Krishna Bahadur Mahara said after a central committee meeting of the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist). In June, the Maoists agreed a power-sharing deal with the government to form an interim legislature to replace the existing parliament, which does not include the rebels.

 The key political issues need to be settled at the highest level between us and the seven-party government, Mahara said. If there is progress in a reasonable time of 10 or 15 days, its okay. Otherwise we will go to the people and launch peaceful street protests to achieve what the people want.

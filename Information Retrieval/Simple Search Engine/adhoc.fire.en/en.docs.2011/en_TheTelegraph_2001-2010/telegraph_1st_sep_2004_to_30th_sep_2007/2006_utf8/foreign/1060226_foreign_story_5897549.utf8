 Rice to repay Straw with home trip

 Straw and Rice: Home 

 truths 

 London, Feb. 25 (Reuters): British foreign secretary Jack Straw said today US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice had agreed to pay a visit to his home town in northern England to repay a trip he made to Alabama last year.

 Straw, who visited Rices home state of Alabama last October, did not specify when the trip would take place for security reasons but the British foreign office said it was expected to be later this year.

 I am delighted that she has accepted and will be able to see how modern Britain is thriving ? and not just in the London venues with which she is familiar, Straw said.

 I will be proud to show Condoleezza Rice the city of Liverpool and my own constituency, Blackburn, during this visit. As in Alabama, we will take the opportunity to make speeches together on foreign policy. 

 He said Liverpool and Blackburn, a former mill town that would not usually be on a top list of UK tourist destinations, were both great places with great futures. During his US visit last year, Straw was greeted with bemusement by some Alabamans, with many struggling to name him describing him simply as Mr England.

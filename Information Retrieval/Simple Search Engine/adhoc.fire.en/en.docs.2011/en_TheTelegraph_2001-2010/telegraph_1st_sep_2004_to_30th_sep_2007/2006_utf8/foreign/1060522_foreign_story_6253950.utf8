 Religion vs porn

 Jakarta, May 21 (AFP): Thousands of Muslims marched in the streets of the Indonesian capital today in support of a controversial anti-pornography bill that would criminalise kissing in public and erotic dancing.

 Shouting God is greatest, some 10,000 protesters from various Muslim groups including the hardline Islamic Defenders Front gathered outside Jakartas historic Hotel Indonesia before marching towards the parliament.

 The protesters, many of them hoisting placards which read say no to sex and win from the influence of naked satan, were organised by the Indonesian Council of Ulemas, the countrys main islamic authority.

 Critics say some provisions in the anti-pornography bill would curtail artistic freedom and violate womens rights. 

 Eltons expletive essay

 Cannes (Reuters): Pop star Elton John launched an expletive-laden 

tirade against the press in Cannes late on Saturday while presenting an award 

during the annual film festival.

 At a ceremony held by jeweller Chopard, John presented the Chopard Trophy to young Canadian actor Kevin Zegers, who co-starred in the film Transamerica with Felicity Huffman.

 He (Zegers) is only 21 years old, already he showed incredible talent and maturity, said John, wearing dark glasses and accompanied by actress Elizabeth Hurley. I sincerely believe he will be a huge star and a great actor for many, many years to come.

 Then, as photographers called out during his address, he added: If you saw Transamerica... Im talking ... you f***wit, f***ing photographers you should be shot, you should be all shot. Thank you.

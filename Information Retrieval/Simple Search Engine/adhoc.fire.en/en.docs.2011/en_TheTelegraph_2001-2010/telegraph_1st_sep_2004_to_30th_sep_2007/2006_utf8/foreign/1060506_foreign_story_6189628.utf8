 Too-thin Nicole wants to gain weight

 Richie: No appetite

 New York, May 5 (AP): Nicole Richie, whose drastic weight loss spawned speculation that she has an eating disorder, acknowledged in an interview with Vanity Fair magazine that she is too thin and is getting treatment to add weight.

 I know Im too thin right now, so I wouldnt want any young girl looking at me and saying: Thats what I want to look like, the 24-year-old Simple Life star tells the magazine in its June issue. 

 I do know that they will, which is another reason I really do need to do something about it, she says. Im not happy with the way I look right now.

 The 5-foot-1-inch Richie was visibly heavier in 2003 when she began filming TVs The Simple Life, which features Richie and former friend Paris Hilton thrown into normal jobs and responsibilities.

 Richie says she doesnt know how much she weighs today.

 However, she says her eating habits are far from healthy: I eat the worst foods ? salty cheese-and-grease kind of stuff.

 Stress causes her to lose her appetite, she says, and her split in December from ex-fiance Adam Goldstein, a professional club DJ, didnt help matters. I had a bad breakup, and it eats me up inside when Im upset about something, says Richie.

 I get really stressed out, and I do lose my appetite, but I do force myself to eat. I tried to put the weight on my way, eating burritos, but that wasnt working, so I started seeing a nutritionist and a doctor, Richie tells the magazine.

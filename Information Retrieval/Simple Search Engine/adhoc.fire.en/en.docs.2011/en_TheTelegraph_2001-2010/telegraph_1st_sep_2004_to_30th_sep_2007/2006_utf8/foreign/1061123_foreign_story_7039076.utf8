 Nepal hails peace pact

 - Rallies held across nation

 J. HEMANTH 

 Kathmandu, Nov. 22: Thousands of Nepalis woke up today to the promise of peace and the end of a 12-year civil war.

 People came out on the streets to celebrate the historic peace accord signed by Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala and Maoist chief Prachanda here last night. 

 To mark the event, the government declared a public holiday today. It urged the people to illuminate their homes by lighting candles and lamps. All schools, colleges and government offices in the country remained closed.

 Victory rallies were organised in Kathmandu since early morning today with thousands waving red hammer and sickle flags and chanting slogans like: This is a victory for peace-loving people and Implement the deal.

 Celebrations were reported from Chitwan, Pokhara, Nepalgunj, Biratnagar, Butwal, Dang, Mahendranagar, Banepa and other parts of the country. Leaders of various parties hailed the accord and urged both sides to restore peace in Nepal. 

 Communist Party of Nepal-Unified Marxist Leninist general secretary Madhav Kumar Nepal said the agreement not only presented an example to the world but has also helped fulfil the desire of the Nepalis for lasting peace.

 Nepali Congress Democratic leader Sher Bahadur Deuba said implementation of the agreement will open avenues for the countrys prosperity. I request all not to miss the historic opportunity and internalise the agreement in its letter and sprit, he said. 

 The pace of change has left many Nepalis optimistic of better times, but also wary of the challenges that lie ahead if promises and deals are to be turned into lasting peace on the ground. 

 I hope no mother will lose her child to conflict and no child will become orphan anymore due to violence, said 54-year-old Punam Shrestha, selling vegetables on a pavement in Kathmandu.

 We are on the threshold of peace and a new history, said Yubaraj Ghimire, editor of the news magazine, Samay.

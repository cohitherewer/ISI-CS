 Lahore temple demolished

 Islamabad, June 13 (PTI): The only Hindu temple in Lahore has been demolished to make way for the construction of a multi-storied commercial building. 

 The temple was recently torn down after officials of the Evacuee Property Trust Board (EPTB), a government body which maintains minority properties especially those belonging to Hindus and Sikhs, reportedly concealed facts from the board chairman about the the building, the Dawn daily reported today. 

 A private developer was allowed to demolish Krishna Mandir at Wachhoowali Rang Mahal and build a commercial building in its place in violation of the boards own scheme for management and disposal of urban evacuee trust properties, the paper said. 

 Quoting from documents, the paper said board officials did not mention that the property being given to the developer, who is also a prominent jeweller of the area, was actually a Hindu temple.

 Had the officials indicated in their correspondence with the board chairman that the property was a Hindu temple, he may have rejected the request for its transfer to the developer for the construction of a four-storey building, an EPTB official was quoted as saying. 

 Several Opposition members of the National Assembly moved a motion against the demolition, saying such an act could have a bearing on Pakistans ties with neighbouring countries

 Girls saved

 Pakistan authorities have stopped five girls being forcibly given away in marriage as compensation for a double murder nine years ago.

 A council of elders in a village in Sindh province decided last week the girls, aged between five and 10, should be handed over to another family to make up for the 1997 killing of a man and woman by some members of their family.

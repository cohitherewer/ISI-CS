 Britain to monitor campus extremists

 AMIT ROY

 London, Oct. 16: The British government is to urge universities and colleges to monitor the activities of extremist Muslim organisations on their campuses but today denied it will ask teachers to spy on students.

 The approach to higher educational institutions as well as to schools is part of a much broader policy being adopted by the government aimed at preventing the grooming of vulnerable young Muslims and increase cohesion in society.

 Another plank of the policy is to give local authorities the power to demand that up to 25 per cent of places in new faith schools and more than 100 Muslim faith schools are in the pipeline to enter the state sector should be available to children of other religions.

 How this will help is unclear since it seems unlikely that the parents of Hindu, Christian or Jewish children will fight to get places in Muslim schools. On the other hand, long-established and well-run Christian schools in England, Wales and Scotland have always accommodated children of other faiths whose parents have wanted places.

 What the government wants to avoid is the spectre of Northern Ireland where separate schooling for Protestants and Catholics have perpetuated the political divide into adulthood.

 There is no doubt that some Islamic groups, among them the hardline Hizb-ul-Tahrir, have been very active in university campuses and been banned from some. There have also been reports of Jewish students being harassed on some campuses by Muslims.

 The dilemma for the government is working out with the university authorities where the borderline should be between legitimate student activity and possible recruitment and grooming for terrorism.

 University lecturers will absolutely resist anything which smells of spying, but at the same time they are aware that extremist groups do regard campuses as fertile recruiting grounds.

 Ruth Kelly, the former education secretary who consults with Muslims as the newly created communities secretary, said today: Its about striking the right balance.

 Her perception and that of the government was that the threat of Islamic extremism had increased since 9/11 and the London bombings on July 7 last year. 

 Kellys view is: In major parts of Britain the new extremism were facing is the single biggest security issue for local communities. This is not just a problem for Muslim communities. The far Right is still with us, still poisonous, still trying to create and exploit divisions.Extremism is an issue for all of us. We all must play our part in responding to it.

 On university campus, the government was determined to ensure that students are protected from extremist influence, said Kelly, after her meeting today with representatives of 20 key local authorities. 

 Todays Guardian reported that the newspaper had obtained a copy of an 18-page document containing proposals which it said would be sent to universities and colleges by the end of the year. 

 The document urges close attention be paid to university Islamic societies and says: Islamic societies have tended to invite more radical speakers or preachers on to campuses ... They can be forceful, persuasive and eloquent. They are able to fill a vacuum created by young Muslims feelings of alienation from their parents generation by providing greater clarity from an Islamic point of view on a range of issues, and potentially a greater sense of purpose about how Muslim students can respond.

 It suggests checks should be made on external speakers at Islamic society events: The control of university or college Islamic societies by certain extremist individuals can play a significant role in the extent of Islamist extremism on campus.

 The secretary-general of the Muslim Council of Britain, Dr Mohammad Abdul Bari, said: What is happening, especially in the last few months, has been a barrage of demonisation of the Muslim community to such an extent that the community is now scared and the whole community feels vulnerable.

 Gemma Tumelty, president of the National Union of Students, commented: They are going to treat everyone Muslim with suspicion on the basis of their faith. Its bearing on the side of McCarthyism.

 However, it is also the case that Omar Sheikh, the British Pakistani who began a career as a terrorist in India and later kidnapped American journalist Daniel Pearl, was first recruited to the Islamic cause while a very bright student in 1992 at the London School of Economics.

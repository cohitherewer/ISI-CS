 UK veil row escalates

 London, Oct. 15 (Reuters): The British minister responsible for race and faith today called for a Muslim teaching assistant suspended for wearing a veil to be sacked, entering a growing row over integration.

 Minister for local government and community cohesion Phil Woolas told the Sunday Mirror that 24-year-old Aishah Azmis decision to wear a veil while teaching made it impossible for her to perform her duties. She should be sacked. She has put herself in a position where she cant do her job, he said.

 Woolas was not the only minister to pronounce on faith issues today. Cabinet minister Peter Hain rubbished a decision by British Airways to send home a worker for wearing a Christian cross.

 Frankly, I think British Airways order for her not to wear her cross is loopy, the secretary of state for Northern Ireland told the BBC.

 BA employee Nadia Eweida had refused to cover up her cross necklace under a scarf, which the airline said contravened its policy that jewellery and religious symbols on chains should not be on display.

 The dispute over Azmis veil is currently before an employment tribunal which is set to rule within days.

 Azmi yesterday told the BBC that the garment, which left just her eyes exposed, had never been a problem for pupils at the Headfield Church of England Junior School in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire.

 She said students had never complained and there had never been an issue about children having difficulty in understanding her talk through the garment.

 Azmi said she was always willing to take her veil off in front of children, but had refused to do so in the presence of male colleagues.

 Fireproof goat

 Stockholm, Dec. 17 (AP): Vandals tried to set fire to a giant straw goat in central Sweden but failed to burn down the traditional Christmas monument, which has been soaked with flame-resistant chemicals.

 It was the seasons first attack on the 43-foot-high Christmas goat in the city of Gavle. It has been burned down more than 20 times in the last 40 years. Somebody tried to set fire to the right front leg, but the flame-resistant chemical worked 100 per cent, said the goat committee chief.

 Tokyo (Reuters): Does god exist in cyberspace? Japanese are split on the issue as more and more Shinto (a religion which says that gods inhabit all natural things) shrines offer virtual visits on websites and sell amulets online. Alarmed, the Association of Shinto Shrines plans to issue guidelines on shrines use of the Net.

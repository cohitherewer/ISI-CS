 Shoppers refusing to break junk food habit

 VALERIE ELLIOTT

 London, 

 Dec. 11: Shoppers are continuing to pile their 

 trolleys and baskets with unhealthy food, despite the governments 

 focus on tackling Britains obesity crisis. 

 A survey of food-buying patterns of 12 million consumers has found that, in the past four years, 44 per cent of people have made no change to their eating habits. Only 8 per cent of shoppers have moved towards a healthier diet, while almost as many are deliberately shunning a good diet and eating more junk food. 

 Even shoppers who normally try to eat healthily fall off the wagon if there is an upheaval in their lives such as the arrival of a new baby, divorce, a wedding, moving house, losing a job or being promoted at work. 

 The findings, from dunnhumby, the retail consultants, who have scrutinised the sales data of 10,000 everyday ingredients clocked up on Tesco loyalty cards as well as interviewed 2,000 customers, suggest that it will take more than a generation before Britain becomes a nation of healthy eaters. 

 The findings will come as a blow to the efforts of Caroline Flint, the public health minister, and the Food Standards Agency, who are attempting to encourage people to eat a more nutritious diet. 

 The study also appears to suggest that consumers need the help of the agencys traffic-light system of red, amber and green alerts on packs to help them to choose a healthier mix of food. The traffic lights are being strongly opposed by food manufacturers and Tesco, who claim that the system is simplistic and demonises food. 

 A surprising feature of the study is that there is little difference in the cost of a healthy shopping basket and an unhealthy one. A typical healthy basket costs an average 71.78 compared with 71.18 for an unhealthy one. Healthy shoppers were identified for buying organic and ecofriendly products and food with labels such as fresh, lite or low fat, or food from the healthy-living ranges.

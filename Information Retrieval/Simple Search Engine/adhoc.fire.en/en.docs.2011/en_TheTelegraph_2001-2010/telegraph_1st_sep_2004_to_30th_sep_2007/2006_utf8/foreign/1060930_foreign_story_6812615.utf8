 Space tour: once is not enough

 Near Arkalyk, Kazakhstan, Sept. 29 (Reuters): The worlds first woman space tourist, Iranian-born Anousheh Ansari, returned to earth today, bumping down in a Russian Soyuz capsule at dawn on the Kazakh steppe.

 They brought me home safe and sound, Ansari, looking tired but happy, said as she sat in a special reclining chair next to the capsule in bright early morning sunshine. 

 I had a great experience.

 These 10 days have been magnificent for me, she said during a farewell ceremony aboard the station, about three-and-a-half hours before the landing. I hope to be able to have this experience once again in the near future.

 A Russian space programme recovery team had surrounded the capsule, opened the hatch and extracted the cosmonauts from the Soyuz TMA-8 capsule, charred black from its fiery re-entry into the atmosphere.

 Ansari, a 40-year-old US telecom entrepreneur, left Iran in 1984. She paid $20 million for the trip.

 She came back with Russian cosmonaut Pavel Vinogradov and US astronaut Jeff Williams and was greeted with red roses as well as a hug from her husband, Hamid.

 It was the ride of a lifetime, Williams, eating an apple, a symbol of Kazakhstan and a traditional treat for returning space crews, said as he adapted to gravity after his six months in space.

 The spacecraft slowed its descent with a large orange and white parachute and fired special gunpowder engines to cushion its landing on one side in a puff of dust and dirt in a field.

 Ansari waved and smiled broadly after being presented with the bunch of red roses with a pink ribbon. Asked how she felt, she gave a thumbs-up and said khorosho good in Russian.

 There have been three other space tourists, each paying the Russian space programme about $20 million for the trip.

 Ansari blasted off from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on September 18 with a fresh US-Russian crew that relieved Vinogradov and Williams on the International Space Station.

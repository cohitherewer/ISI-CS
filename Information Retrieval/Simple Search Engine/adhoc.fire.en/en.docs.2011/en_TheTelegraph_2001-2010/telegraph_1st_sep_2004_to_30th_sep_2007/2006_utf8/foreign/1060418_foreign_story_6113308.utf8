 Snuff returns

 London, April 17: Snuff is making an unlikely comeback as smoking bans are intro- duced in pubs across the UK, reports The Daily Telegraph. 

 Sales of the tobacco product have increased over the past year with smoking already banned in Scotland, while England and Wales are to follow suit next summer. Snuff producers believe that taking a pinch at the bar will become an acceptable way for smokers to get some nicotine. 

 Because snuff is not taxed in the same way as cigarettes, a weeks supply costs less than ?3. 

 Dog fund

 London (Reuters): A British animal charity appealed on Monday 

for help finding homes for 200 Yorkshire terriers and 37 cats rescued at the weekend 

from what it called a house of horror. Celia Hammond, a former top 

fashion model-turned-animal saviour, said her charity found the animals in appalling 

conditions at a house in West Sussex after the son of the deceased owner called 

them in.

 Pony jobs 

 London: Six Exmoor ponies have been drafted into the Peak District National Park to help regenerate a large area of moorland, reports The Daily Telegraph. Their ability to dine on the invasive purple grass molinia while ignoring traditional heather, makes them an ideal form of natural weed control. The rare ponies will be allowed to roam free over 2,505-hectare Eastern Moors estate, near Sheffield, for five years.

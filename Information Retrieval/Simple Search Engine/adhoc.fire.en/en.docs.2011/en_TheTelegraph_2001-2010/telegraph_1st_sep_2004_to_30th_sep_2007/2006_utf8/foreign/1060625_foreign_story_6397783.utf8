 Million chocolate bars recalled after health scare

 London, June 24 (Reuters): Cadbury Schweppes Plc said yesterday it had recalled over 1 million chocolate bars in the UK and Irish markets in a precautionary move, because they could contain minute traces of salmonella.

 There are minute traces of salmonella, which are significantly below those (levels) which scientific standards say present any hazard, a spokeswoman for the worlds biggest confectionery group said. 

 Theres no connection between our product and anybody becoming ill from it, she added. The company said it had identified the source of the problem and rectified it and was taking steps to ensure these products are no longer available for sale.

 The precautionary recall involves seven products ? 250 gram bars of Dairy Milk Turkish, Dairy Milk Caramel and Dairy Milk Mint; Dairy Milk 8 chunk; 1 kg bars of Dairy Milk: Diary Milk Button Easter Eggs (105 grams); and Cadbury Freddo 10p.

 Weve been making chocolate for over 100 years, and quality has always come first, UK managing Director Simon Baldry said.

 Weve taken this precautionary step because our consumers are our highest priority. We apologise for any inconvenience caused, Baldry added.

 The company said the decision to recall the chocolate bars had been made in consultation with the Food Standards Agency. Today, Cadbury insisted that its products were safe despite waiting five months to inform health authorities it had discovered traces of salmonella. 

 We are absolutely satisfied that our products are and continue to be safe to eat, the companys European president Matt Shattock told BBC radio.

 We have no evidence that anyone has been ill from eating them, he said.

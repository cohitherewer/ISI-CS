 Gibson sorry

 Los Angeles, Aug. 2 (Reuters): Actor Mel Gibson apologised yesterday for making anti-Semitic remarks in a drunken rant and asked to meet Jewish leaders, but several called on the Hollywood superstar to first show deeds and not offer words.

 Separately, US television network ABC pulled a programme about the Holocaust that Gibsons company was producing, and a Los Angeles official defended the sheriff departments handling of Gibsons arrest against claims he was shown favouritism. I want to apologise specifically to everyone in the Jewish community for the vitriolic and harmful words that I said to a law enforcement officer the night I was arrested, Gibson said in a statement.

 Gibson, who directed 2004s blockbuster movie The Passion of The Christ about the last hours of the life of Jesus, was caught speeding early on Friday, and he went on a rant in which he is widely reported to have said: The Jews are responsible for all the wars in the world. The Los Angeles police report is laced with anti-Semitic remarks from Gibson.

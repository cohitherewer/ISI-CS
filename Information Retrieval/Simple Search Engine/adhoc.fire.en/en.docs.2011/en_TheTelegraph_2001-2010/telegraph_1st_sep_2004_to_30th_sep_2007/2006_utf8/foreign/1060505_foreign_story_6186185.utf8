 Dylan is changing

 New York, May 4: That drawling, raspy voice was unmistakable. But this time it was introducing songs, not singing them. 

 The once-reclusive Bob Dylan made his debut yesterday as a radio DJ in the latest twist of his long career. For fans accustomed to his terse, mumbled comments at concerts, the singer-songwriter was positively chatty ? revealing a wry humour and even quoting Stevie Wonder in broken Italian. Hard on the heels of the revelations in his bestselling Chronicles autobiography and a Mrtin Scorsese documentary No Direction Home, Dylans weekly radio show promises new insight into the music legend. 

Introducing Slim Harpos Raining in My Heart, for instance, 

the twice-divorced Dylan opines: Slim wrote a bunch of songs with his wife, 

Lovelle. Boy, I wish I had a wife like that, help me write songs!

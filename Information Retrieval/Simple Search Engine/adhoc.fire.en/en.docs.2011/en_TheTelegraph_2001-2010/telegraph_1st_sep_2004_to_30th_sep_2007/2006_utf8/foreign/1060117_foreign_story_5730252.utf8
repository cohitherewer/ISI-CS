 India woos US blacks

 Martin Luther King: Indian dream

 Washington, Jan. 16: Even as President George W Bush is preparing to travel to New Delhi, India has launched a major initiative to woo Americas black community, whose prominent representative organisations are unenthusiastic about the Indo-US nuclear deal and have traditionally backed Pakistan on issues concerning South Asia.

 At a glittering black-tie reception at his residence during the weekend to observe the 77th birth anniversary of Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., being celebrated in the US today, Indias ambassador to the US, Ronen Sen, announced that the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR) is to sponsor an annual lecture to honour the legacy of the American civil rights leader.

 The Martin Luther King lecture series will be delivered alternately in India and in the US. The unusual black-tie reception and the ICCR initiative are the latest in New Delhis repeated efforts to woo African-Americans to Indias side, which have sputtered and stalled in the past.

 Through the 1990s and well until recently, some members of the influential Congressional Black Caucus have been supporters of Khalistan on Capitol Hill and voted for resolutions calling for cutting US aid to India on grounds of human rights violations.

 The Congressional Pakistan Caucus is led by a prominent black member of the US House of Representatives, Sheila Jackson Lee, a Democrat from Texas.

 The Congressional Black Caucus is entirely made up of Democrats since there are no black Republicans in the House of Representatives, or for that matter, in the Senate.

 Support from Democrats is vital if India is to see through the nuclear deal with the Bush administration and other measures which require Congressional approval.

 New Delhis problem is that several members of the Black Caucus are also members of Congressional bodies for whom nuclear non-proliferation is a holy cow, such as the Bi-partisan Task Force on Non-Proliferation. 

 In the past, Indias political effort to make an imprint on African-Americans has followed the traditional Third World and socialist route of installing Gandhi statues in view of the influence that the Mahatmas teachings had on King.

A statue of Mahatma Gandhi was unveiled at the Martin 

Luther King Jr. Historical Site in Atlanta in January 1998 as part of the 50th 

anniversary of Indias independence, while tributes are paid every year to 

the spiritual link between the Mahatma and King in Houston, which celebrates October 

2 as Mahatma Gandhi Day.

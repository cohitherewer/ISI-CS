 Experts say wild birds not to blame for flu 

 Rome, May 30 (AP): Wild birds carry only part of the blame for spreading the deadly strain of bird flu, and experts said today that they should not be killed but rather studied to understand how the virus spreads.

 Scientists at an international conference on bird flu in Rome urged countries to refrain from mass killings of birds, saying that only further research can reveal whether the highly infectious H5N1 bird flu strain will become endemic in wild birds, causing periodic outbreaks across the globe for years to come.

 The message is: Dont blame only the wild birds, Joseph Domenech, head of the Animal Health Service at the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, said on the sidelines of the two-day conference at the Rome-based agency.

 We dont know if wild birds can become long-term reservoirs of the virus, he said. We are not supporting actions on wild birds, such as killings. If wild birds have a role, the only answer is to monitor them.

 The conference gathered more than 300 scientists and animal experts from 100 countries to discuss the role of wild birds and other questions in hopes of finding ways to control the spread of the disease and to prepare in case it mutates into a virus that could threaten a human pandemic.

 Ford: Ready for Indiana

 Rome, Oct. 21 (AP): Harrison Ford said he is looking forward to appearing in his fourth Indiana Jones movie, adding that he feels fit to continue to play the adventurer, despite growing older.

 Ford, 64, told a news conference at the inaugural Rome Film Festival yesterday that he was delighted to team up again with directors Steven Spielberg and George Lucas for the film.

 We did three films that stay within the same block of time. We need to move on for artistic reasons and obvious physical reasons, Ford said. I feel fit to continue and bring the same physical action to the movie.

 Ford played Indiana Jones in the 1980s films Raiders of the Lost Ark, Temple of Doom and The Last Crusade. In the final film, Sean Connery played his father.

 Ford said yesterday that Connery might also appear in the fourth movie.

 Hes part of the emotional fabric of these films. I think there may be an opportunity; I believe that Sean is still willing, and Id be delighted if he joined us, Ford said.

 Connery, who attended the Rome event last week, has said that no offer had been made. Ford declined to provide details about a shooting schedule or film locations, adding that the directors were not yet finished with the script.

 What we talked about so far, I think its a real opportunity to make a film as successful ... as the ones weve made before, he said.

 The first-ever festival in the Italian capital has drawn a handful of stars promoting their films, although the 16 films in competition are mostly smaller films.

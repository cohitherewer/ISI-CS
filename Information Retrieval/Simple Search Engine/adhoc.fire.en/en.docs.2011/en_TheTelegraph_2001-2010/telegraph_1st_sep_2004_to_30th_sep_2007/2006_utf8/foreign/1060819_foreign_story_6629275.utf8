 Royal ransack row

 Segolene: Losing her cool

 Paris, Aug. 18 (Reuters): A break-in at the apartment of French presidential hopeful Segolene Royal during her summer holiday has sparked a row ahead of next years election.

 Royals flat southwest of Paris was ransacked while the mother-of-four was with her family in southern France, a source close to Royal said today. The Socialist had asked police to keep the matter confidential, the source added.

 However, a paper published an article on the break-in today. French media said Royal indicated that the interior ministry, headed by her likely presidential challenger, conservative Nicolas Sarkozy, could have passed on the details.

 Its serious that a report like this can appear in the press before I, as a mother, have been able to let all my children know, Royal told reporters.

 I am sending out a warning. Everyone must know that there are methods which arent acceptable, she said.

 An interior ministry statement said no information of a confidential character concerning a possible intrusion (at Royals flat) has been disclosed by the officials or cabinet (of Sarkozy).

 Nothing was stolen at the flat Royal shares with her partner, Socialist leader Francois Hollande, the source said, although cupboards had been emptied and furniture tossed around.

 Prosecutors have opened a preliminary police enquiry into the break-in, discovered yesterday. Nothing allows us to say that the person or persons knew whose place they were getting into, a deputy prosecutor said. Roger Karoutchi, senator of the conservative UMP party, said Royal was losing her cool.

 She is trying to discredit interior ministry officials to promote herself ahead of her political comeback at the end of the summer break, he said. Royal is leading opinion polls to become the Socialists presidential candidate in next years election.

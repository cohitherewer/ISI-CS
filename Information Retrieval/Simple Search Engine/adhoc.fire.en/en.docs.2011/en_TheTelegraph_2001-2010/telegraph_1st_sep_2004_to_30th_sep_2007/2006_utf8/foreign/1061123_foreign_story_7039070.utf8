 Berlin, Nov. 22 

 (Reuters): Some things never change. At least not at the 

 Merkels breakfast table.

 Despite becoming chancellor of Europes most populous country a year ago, Angela Merkel still prepares breakfast for her scientist husband, Joachim Sauer, she told Germanys Bild newspaper today.

 The breakfast that I make for us is still the same one, she said when asked what had changed since becoming chancellor. Of course, overall I have less time. But it is important and very nice for me that my husband understands that.

 Merkel also said she was looking forward to Christmas as only then did she have time to read a book, more often than not a long novel such as those by Fyodor Dostoyevsky.

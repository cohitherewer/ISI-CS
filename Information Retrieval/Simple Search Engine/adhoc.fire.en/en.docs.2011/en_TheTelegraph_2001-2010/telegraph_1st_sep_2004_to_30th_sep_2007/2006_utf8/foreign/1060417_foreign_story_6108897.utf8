 Canned hunting, for ?20000 

 DAVID HARRISON

 Badajoz, Extremadura, April 16: Wealthy hunters are paying up to ?20,000 to kill lions, tigers and other rare and exotic animals on game reserves in Spain. 

 Police who raided a reserve in Extremadura, a region by the Portuguese border, were astonished to discover two tigers and a lion lined up as quarry. One tiger had already been shot dead, but officers arrived in time to save the others. 

 The animals, believed to have been bought from zoos or circuses, were found in rusty cages at the Lunares reserve, near the small town of Monterrubio de la Serena. Seven people ? the reserve owner, three staff and three hunters ? were arrested and are expected to face trial. 

 The surviving animals were taken to a sanctuary in Malaga. 

 The hunting of big game is the most shocking development in the dramatic growth of illegal hunting of rare or endangered animals in Spain. Police say that some reserves are organising safaris for hunters who want to kill imported antelope, protected wolves and the endangered Iberian lynx in the south and west of the country. 

 The three arrested hunters were Spaniards but police believe that illegal safari hunters, who pay up to ?20,000 for the chance to shoot rare and endangered animals without the expense of travelling to Africa, may also come from Britain, Italy and America. Illegal hunting also takes place in Andaluc?a and Castilla-La Mancha. 

 The dead tiger is believed to have been shot in its cage or in a small enclosure from which it could not escape. 

 The practice, which has been reported in Africa but never before in Spain, is known as canned hunting. Hunters take the animals heads and skins home as trophies, claiming that they have shot the game in the wild. 

 A senior environmental police officer said: We have evidence that people are prepared to pay huge sums of money to kill an animal unable to defend itself just so they can take the head and skin home and brag to their friends: I killed that lion in Africa. 

 Ramon Gonz?lez, the Badajoz provincial head of Seprona, the Guardia Civils environmental unit, led the raid at Monterrubio. He said that he was surprised, to say the least to find tigers and lions in Spain. 

 We hope it will be an isolated incident but we cannot say there will be no more cases. We are increasing our surveillance and are determined to catch the organisers and the hunters, wherever they are from. 

 Extremadura, like other regions, has a long tradition of organising legal hunts for wild boar, deer, partridges, rabbits and hares. A days legitimate hunting costs more than ?2,000 and the business is estimated to generate ?1 billion a year. 

 In January, 12 Indian blackbuck antelopes were confiscated from a farm near C?ceres. Seprona confiscated 678 illegally imported animals across Spain early last year. Philip Russell, of World Society for the Protection of Animals, said: We have heard that it is going on in Africa but that it should be happening in western Europe just beggars believe.

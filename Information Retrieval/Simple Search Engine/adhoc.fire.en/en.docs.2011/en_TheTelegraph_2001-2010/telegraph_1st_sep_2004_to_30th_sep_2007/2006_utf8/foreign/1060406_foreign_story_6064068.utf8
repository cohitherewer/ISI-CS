 Shampoo ad ire in UK

 DAVID DERBYSHIRE

 London, April 5: Claims made in advertisments for cosmetics and beauty products generally need to be taken with a pinch of salt.

 However, when some recent commercials for Head amp; Shoulders claimed that it could leave hair 100 per cent dandruff-free, they werent telling the whole story. What the adverts voiceover meant was that regular use of the shampoo made it impossible to spot flakes of dandruff from a distance of two feet.

 Yesterday, the Advertising Standards Authority ruled that two television adverts had misled viewers. Although the manufacturers Procter amp; Gamble ran a text caveat at the bottom of the screen, the ASA ordered it not to repeat the adverts in their current forms.

 Procter and Gamble said that a distance of two feet was used for assessing dandruff because this was a realistic personal distance for people speaking to each other. A Procter amp; Gamble spokeswoman said the group would amend its adverts. 

 The ASA, though, considered that users would think the advert meant they would be unable to see any dandruff themselves. 

 After six years of television commercials stating regular use of Head and Shoulders leaves your hair 100 per cent dandruff free, one sceptical viewer complained.

 He said he did not believe Head and Shoulders would get rid of all the dandruff.

 The commercials are the latest for beauty products to be criticised by the watchdog. 

 Last year LOr?al and Est?e Lauder were found to have made misleading claims about their anti-cellulite creams. An advert claiming that Pantene Pro-V products made hair up to 10 times stronger was also deemed to have breached the rules.

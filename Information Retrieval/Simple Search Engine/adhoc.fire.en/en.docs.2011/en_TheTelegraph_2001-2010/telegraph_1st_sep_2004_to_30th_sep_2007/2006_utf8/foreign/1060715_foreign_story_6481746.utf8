 Karachi , July 14: A suicide bomber killed a leading Pakistani Shia cleric, Allama Hassan Turabi, in Karachi today.

 Three other people, including Turabis young nephew and the bomber, died in the attack.

 Turabi was a central figure of the six-party Islamic Opposition alliance, the Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal. After Turabis killing, hundreds of angry Shias cried and beat their chests and chanted religious hymns in the hospital. 

 Hundreds more emotional followers congregated in the roads close to the dead clerics home and angry youths threw stones and burned tyres in some parts of Karachi.

 The police fired tear gas to disperse the Shia protesters. Gunfire was also heard but there were no casualties.

 According to the Karachi police chief, Niaz Siddiqui, the suicide bomber had strapped explosives to his body and blew himself up as Turabi arrived at his home in the Abbas Town area of Karachi.

 Siddiqui said the police had found the bombers head and legs at the scene of the blast. He added that a grenade was also found at the blast site.

 Turabi: Big blow

 According to Salahuddin Haider, 

 a Sindh government spokesman, the bomber struck after an 

 accomplice threw the grenade that did not explode. The second 

 attacker managed to escape, he added.

 There was no claim of responsibility for the killing of Turabi, who survived an assassination attempt in April when his car was hit by a remote-controlled bomb.

 It was a targeted killing, aimed at disturbing the peace and harmony of Karachi. Lets hope and pray that the situation remains calm, Haider said.

 Siddiqui said a state of high alert had been declared in Karachi. Paramilitary troops had started patrolling the city ahead of Turabis funeral tomorrow which is likely to draw thousands of Shia mourners.

 Karachi has borne the brunt of sectarian violence between Pakistans majority Sunnis and minority Shias that has killed thousands of people since the 1980s. 

 Security was tightened at the 

 US and several European consulates in Karachi.

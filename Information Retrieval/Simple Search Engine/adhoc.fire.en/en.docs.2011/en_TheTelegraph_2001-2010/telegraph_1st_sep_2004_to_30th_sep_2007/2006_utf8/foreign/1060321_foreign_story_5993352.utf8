 Guilty gnomes hide

 London, March 20 (Reuters): A disabled council tax rebel has sent her collection of garden gnomes into hiding to avoid them being seized by local officials.

 The officials had threatened to take the gnomes from widow Gwynneth Lester in Fareham, about 112 km southwest of London, after she refused to pay up. Lester, 57, refuses to pay the tax which finances local services because, she says, she gets nothing for it. Her rebellion has landed her in court with a demand to pay up some ?670 ? in cash or in kind ? or face prison.

 Well, they wont be taking the garden gnomes now because I have given them away, she said today. In fact they wont be getting anything that I have collected over the years because I have given it all away to keep it from them.

 Crowe for gladiator sport

 Melbourne (Reuters): Oscar-winning actor Russell Crowe has 

taken his famous role as a gladiator to a new level by buying into Australian 

rugby league, a sport renowned for its gladiatorial contests. Crowe offered A$3 

million ($2 million) to take over the South Sydney rugby league club, one of the 

oldest and most famous clubs in the sport. The inner Sydney club had resisted 

the offer and its membership was split before an agreement late on Sunday.

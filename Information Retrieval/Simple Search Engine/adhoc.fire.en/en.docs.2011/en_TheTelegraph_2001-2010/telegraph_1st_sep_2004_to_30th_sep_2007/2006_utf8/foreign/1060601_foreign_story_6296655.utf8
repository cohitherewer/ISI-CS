 Demi night

 Des Moines (Iowa), May 31 (AP): Patrons at a West Des Moines bar were surprised when Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore showed up this weekend ? and stayed until closing time.

 Kutcher, who is a native of the eastern Iowa town of Homestead, was visiting family with his 43-year-old actress-wife and her 14-year-old daughter Scout.

 Moore told patrons attempting to take pictures to go away, and some people who persisted in taking photos were asked to leave the bar. As the bar was closing at 2 am, Kutcher tried to arrange a helicopter to take his family home, said bar manager Mike Caudle.

 I contacted every pilot I know, and I couldnt get a hold of anyone with a helicopter, said Caudle. He said his security personnel drove them the 160 km home.

 Butt force

 Sydney (Reuters): May the Butt Force be with you. Sydney, 

Australias largest city, has had enough of careless smokers who dispose 

of their butts in the street. Coinciding with World No Tobacco Day on Wednesday, 

a team of 30 plain-clothed rangers were prowling Sydney streets as part of an 

anti-smoking and litter crackdown. Nicknamed by local media as Butt Busters 

and the Butt Force, the rangers have been issuing fines of $45 for 

smokers who dump their butts in the streets instead of in designated bins.

 Boom ban

 Shanghai (Reuters): Booming Shanghai will ban all-night building work for the next 18 days to let students revise for exams in peace, a state newspaper said on Wednesday. And on exam days ? from June 7-9 and June 17-18 ? construction will be stopped at all sites within 100 metres of an exam hall, the Shanghai Daily said. Around the clock construction is a common feature in many Chinese cities, though technically work is supposed to stop after sunset. Trucks rumble through the night and jackhammers are used at all hours keeping residents awake.

 Iran removes UN nuke seals

 Tehran, Jan. 10 (Reuters): Iran removed UN seals at its Natanz uranium enrichment plant and resumed nuclear fuel research today, drawing sharp western criticism but no immediate threats of punitive action.

 Tehran denies wanting nuclear technology for anything but a civilian energy programme aimed at satisfying the Islamic Republics booming demand for electricity.

 But the US and the EU doubt that Irans atomic ambitions are entirely peaceful and are likely to ask the UN Security Council, which can impose economic sanctions, to take up the matter, western diplomats said.

 Western powers had called on Iran to refrain from any work that could help it develop atomic weapons.

 Irans nuclear research centres have restarted their activities, Mohammad Saeedi, deputy head of Irans Atomic Energy Organisation, told state television.

 He said work at the research facilities would be under the supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN nuclear watchdog.

 Saeedi said Iran had come to an agreement with the IAEA on what work Tehran would do. He gave no details.

 The IAEA in Vienna confirmed Iran was removing UN seals at Natanz, an underground plant in central Iran that Tehran concealed from UN inspectors until an Iranian exile group revealed its existence in August 2002.

 The Iranians have begun removing seals at Natanz in the presence of IAEA inspectors, said IAEA spokeswoman Melissa Fleming.

 The EU was quick to denounce Irans move. This is very much a step in the wrong direction. We are extremely concerned and consultations are taking place (within the EU) to coordinate a response, said Cristina Gallach, spokeswoman for EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana.

 Russia, which is helping Iran build a nuclear power station at the southern port of Bushehr, said Tehran should abide by international commitments and that its decision to resume research caused concern.

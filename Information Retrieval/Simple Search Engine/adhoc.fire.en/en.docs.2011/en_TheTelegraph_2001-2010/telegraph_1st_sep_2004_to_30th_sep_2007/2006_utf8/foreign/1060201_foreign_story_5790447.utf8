 Putin backs world role

 - Russia focus on economy

 Moscow, Jan. 31 (Reuters): President Vladimir Putin today brushed off criticism of his democratic record and said Russias dynamic economy and commitment to global investment justified its place as a member of the G8 group of rich nations.

 Exuding confidence, Putin told a marathon Kremlin news conference that Russians were living better than before, despite high inflation, and benefiting from strong economic growth that was filling state coffers with cash.

 Linking increasing prosperity to Russias growing world role, Putin said Russia fully deserved its place in the Group of Eight industrialised nations ? a fact recognised by the other members of the group. I know the mood of the leaders of the G8. No one is against our active participation in this club. No one wants the G8 to turn into a gathering of fat cats, he declared.

 Russia took over the rotating chair of the G8 group ? that includes Germany, France, Britain, Italy, the US, Canada and Japan ? at the start of this year. 

 With Russias world role as an energy superpower growing, a summit of President George W. Bush and other G8 leaders in July in Putins home town of St Petersburg will be the high point of his time in power.

 Though his focus was mainly on the economy, the 53-year-old Kremlin leader fielded a wide range of questions on foreign policy where he adopted a moderate tone apparently not wishing to ruffle feathers within the G8.

 His nearly six years in power have been marked by the muzzling of the free media, the neutralising of the political Opposition. Now, curbs on non-governmental organisations (NGOs) including established human rights bodies have raised eyebrows in the West.

 Speaking on the economy, Putin highlighted a growth of 6.4 per cent in 2005 as a sign of how vibrant the economy was, though he acknowledged that inflation at 10.9 per cent was higher than he would have liked.

 Russias strong finances meant it could now buy back more of its foreign debts after last year repaying $18 billion to the Paris Club of sovereign lenders and International Monetary Fund.

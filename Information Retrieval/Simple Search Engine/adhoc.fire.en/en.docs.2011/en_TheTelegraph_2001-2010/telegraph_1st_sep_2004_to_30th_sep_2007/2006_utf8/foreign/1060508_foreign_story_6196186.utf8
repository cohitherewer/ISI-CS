The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Tehran threat to leave NPT

 Tehran, May 7 (Reuters): Iran today said it will reject any UN resolution seeking an end to its atomic fuel work and renewed its rhetoric about following North Korea in quitting the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).

 The defiance came as US President George W. Bush said Iran posed a threat to Israel and other countries.

 A draft UN Security Council resolution, fashioned by Britain and France and backed by the US, will ask that Iran suspend its uranium enrichment activities.

 Irans President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was quoted by official IRNA news agency as saying: They should know that the Iranians will dash their illegitimate resolution against the wall.

 Iran says it wants atomic fuel for power stations, not bombs, but has failed to convince the international community.

The draft UN resolution seeks to invoke Chapter 7, 

making the resolution binding under international law and would allow for sanctions 

and even war, although a separate resolution is required to specify either of 

those steps.

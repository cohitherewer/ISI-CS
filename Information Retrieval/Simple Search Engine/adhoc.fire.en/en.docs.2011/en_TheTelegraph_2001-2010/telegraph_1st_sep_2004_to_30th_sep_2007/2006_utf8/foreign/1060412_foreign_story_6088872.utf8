 Man wins $9-m Vioxx damages

 The Merck painkiller Vioxx: Lethal

 Atlantic City (New Jersey), April 11 (Reuters): A jury today awarded $9 million in punitive damages to a New Jersey man who blamed Merck amp; Co. Incs Vioxx for his heart attack, but the company vowed to continue fighting cases involving its withdrawn pain medicine.

 That comes on top of last weeks award of $4.5 million in compensatory damages to 77-year-old John McDarby by the jury that found Vioxx was a significant contributing factor to his heart attack and that Merck failed to adequately warn of the drugs risks.

 In order to award punitive damages, the jury of six women and two men in New Jersey superior court needed to find that Merck withheld material information on Vioxx from the US Food and Drug Administration

 Under state law, punitive damages ? awarded as punishment to rectify a wrong committed by a defendant ? were capped at $22.5 million, or five times compensatory damages.

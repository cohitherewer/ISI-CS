 Minnesota sends first Muslim to Capitol

 Ellison: Historic

 Minneapolis (Minnesota), Nov. 8 (Reuters): Voters elected a black Democrat as the first Muslim in Congress yesterday after a race in which he advocated quick US withdrawal from Iraq and made little mention of his faith.

 Keith Ellison, a 43-year-old lawyer and state representative, defeated two rivals, television networks said, to succeed retiring Democrat Martin Sabo in a seat that has been held by Democrats since 1963.

 Ellison, who converted to Islam as a 19-year-old college student in his native Detroit, won with the help of Muslims among a coalition of liberal, anti-war voters.

 He advocates an immediate US withdrawal from Iraq along with strongly liberal views. While Ellison did not often speak of his faith during the campaign, awareness of his candidacy drew interest from Muslims well beyond Minneapolis. A significant community of Somali immigrants in Minneapolis cast their first votes for him in the crowded September primary.

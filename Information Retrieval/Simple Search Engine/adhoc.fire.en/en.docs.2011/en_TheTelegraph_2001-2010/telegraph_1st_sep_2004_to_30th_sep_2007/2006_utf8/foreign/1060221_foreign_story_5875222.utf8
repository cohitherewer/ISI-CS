 Paris, Feb. 20 (Reuters): Europe called in the military and shut chickens in sheds and coops today to halt the spread of deadly bird flu that has reached France and hit poultry sales across the continent.

 With European cases so far limited to wild birds, authorities worked furiously to prevent the H5N1 virus infecting the EUs one-billion-strong domestic poultry flock and threatening an industry worth 20 billion euros ($23.88 billion) a year.

 French authorities clad in protective suits installed a three-km security zone around the spot near Lyon where an infected duck was found. Veterinarians were busy today checking all birds within the zone. Birds from other French regions were being tested too, but two suspected cases in the Somme region turned out negative.

 The H5N1 strain, which has killed 92 people and led to the destruction of millions of poultry, has now spread to Europe, West Asia and Africa from Asia. 

 The German government deployed reconnaissance jets and soldiers in bio-hazard suits to help control the virus after it was confirmed to have reached the mainland from an initial outbreak on the Baltic island of Ruegen.

 Two hundred and fifty soldiers from all branches of the armed forces and military officials from Mecklenburg-Vorpommern will assist the coast guard in the collection of bird corpses, the coast guard said.

 The military was called in after days of media criticism that the local authorities were moving too slowly. 

 Italy has a special police unit checking health and safety norms, which include the compulsory use of netting over areas where the fowl are kept, to prevent contact with wild birds.

 Governments reacted to the first cases in the EU last week, ordering all poultry to be kept inside. And yet public panic has worsened, despite the measures and government assurances that poultry, if cooked properly, is perfectly safe.

 Over the past week, poultry meat sales in Italy have fallen by 70 per cent, farmers association Coldiretti said.

 Britain is one of the few countries in the bloc yet to order a lock-up of its poultry but the situation was under review. Animal health experts will meet in Brussels tomorrow to debate requests from some member states.

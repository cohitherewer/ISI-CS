 Pak peace dividend

 Musharraf: Defence push

 Islamabad, June 5 (Reuters): Pakistan today announced a 3.78 per cent increase in defence spending, a modest rise analysts said reflected the easing of tension with India and a shift in the security focus to battling militants.

 The increase for the financial year beginning on July 1 was announced in a budget speech by minister of state for finance Omar Ayub Khan.

 The defence budget will be Rs 250.18 billion compared with a revised Rs 241.06 billion for the fiscal year ending on June 30. Pakistans impregnable defence is our number one priority, Khan told parliament.

 Relations between India and Pakistan have slowly improved since peace efforts resumed in early 2004.

 I dont think any direct threat is developing from India right now, said Kamal Matinuddin, a former general. Unlike in the past, theres no war of words, no movement of troops and no military exercises near borders. 

 In February, India raised its defence spending by 7 per cent for the next fiscal year, aiming to finance ambitious plans to modernise its 1.3 million-strong military, the fourth largest in the world.

 Indias armed forces have been on a shopping spree in the past few years, seeking new fighter and trainer aircraft, submarines, an aircraft carrier and artillery systems. Pakistan has long given up hope of matching India weapon-for-weapon and has based its defence on deterrence.

 Pakistani defence analysts said the increase announced today was modest and understandable in the light of a surge in fighting against al Qaida-linked militants in lawless tribal regions on Pakistans western border with Afghanistan. For now, we have to concentrate more on the western border than the eastern side, Matinuddin said.

 Security analyst Talat Masood, another former general, described the increase in defence spending as nominal but said the government might allocate more funds later for new weapons.

 Pakistan is one of Washingtons main allies in its war on terrorism and the US administration said last week it was planning to let Pakistan buy Boeing Harpoon anti-ship missiles and related equipment worth up to $370 million.

 The cabinet last month approved plans to buy a $1-billion early warning surveillance system from Sweden.

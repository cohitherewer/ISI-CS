 Russia nabs officials taking bribe

 Moscow, Nov. 17 (Reuters): Police have arrested the director of the Russian state medical insurance fund and five other senior employees for bribe-taking, the latest officials to feel the weight of President Vladimir Putins anti-corruption drive.

 A court spokeswoman said today that Andrei Taranov, director of the Federal Obligatory Insurance Fund which was set up in the 1990s to improve health services, had been charged under two articles of the criminal code. These relate to receiving bribes and abuse of professional position, she said, saying: These are official charges from the prosecutor general.

 Five other senior employees of the fund, including two of Taranovs deputies, had been arrested on similar charges, the prosecutor generals office said on its website.

 Putin has made fighting corruption, endemic to Russian society, a key priority and the theme is becoming a major issue in the build-up to presidential elections in 2008.

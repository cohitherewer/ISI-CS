 Chandigarh, Nov. 16: The family of Sarabjit Singh, who is on death row at Lahores Kot Lakhpat jail, has sought the help of Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh in obtaining Pakistani visas so that they can see him before a supreme court hearing.

 The three review petitions in the supreme court are expected to come up for hearing during the last week of this month. We are told that the hearings would be final and Sarabjit will be hanged if the petitions and the clemency plea to President Musharraf are dismissed. We would like to see him before he is executed, Dalbir Kaur, his sister, said.

 US cant melt Annan

 United Nations, June 8 (Reuters): UN secretary-general Kofi Annan has refused a US demand that he repudiate his deputy for accusing Washington of relying on the United Nations but failing to defend it against domestic critics.

 An outraged US Ambassador, John Bolton, while not demanding the resignation of UN deputy secretary-general Mark Malloch Brown, called his remarks a very very grave mistake. Bolton said: Even though the target of the speech was the United States, the victim, I fear, will be the United Nations.

 Malloch Brown, a Briton, said on Tuesday: The prevailing practice of seeking to use the UN almost by stealth as a diplomatic tool while failing to stand up for it against its domestic critics is simply not sustainable. 

 Bolton accused Brown of employing a condescending, patronising tone about the American people. 

Annan, however, agreed with his deputys views.

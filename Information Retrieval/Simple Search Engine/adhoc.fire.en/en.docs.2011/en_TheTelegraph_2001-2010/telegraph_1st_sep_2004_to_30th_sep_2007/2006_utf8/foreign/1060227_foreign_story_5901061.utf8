The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Music with a difference for Oscars 2006

 - Country on the cards

 Cast members Taryn Manning and D.J. Qualls of the film Hustle amp; Flow

 Los Angeles, Feb. 26 (Reuters): In a departure from past Oscar shows featuring syrupy Disney tunes and soundtrack ballads, this years telecast will give audiences country music, alternative rock and a super-sanitised version of a racy rap song.

 The song, called Its Hard Out Here for a Pimp, is from the movie Hustle amp; Flow, the story of a pimp who aspires to a singing career. In the Oscars first performance by a rap group, the group Three 6 Mafia will perform the song, one of three nominated in the best original song category, at the March 5 Academy Awards ceremony.

 The pimp movie wont be the only aspect of the Oscars show that could make social conservatives cringe. The gay-themed cowboy movie Brokeback Mountain leads the nominee pack and the show is being hosted by Jon Stewart, who fills his news satire Daily Show on the Comedy Central cable channel with George W. Bush jokes.

 The Academy (of Motion Pictures Arts amp; Sciences) is really to be commended, said Aaron Rosenberg, lawyer for Three 6 Mafia. Its admirable that voters are recognising the hip-hop generation and its influence on American culture.

 While rapper Eminem won the best song Oscar in 2003 for Lose Yourself from the film 8 Mile, he skipped the ceremony and the song was not performed.

 With decency concerns in high gear in the aftermath of the notorious baring of Janet Jacksons breast during the 2004 Super Bowl halftime show, Three 6 Mafia worked to make their lyrics meet ABCs broadcast standards. We took out all the cuss words and made it squeaky clean, rapper Paul DJ Paul Beauregard, who co-wrote the song with Jordan Juicy J Houston and Cedric Frayser Boy Coleman, said.

 The writers substituted new lyrics where necessary in the song, which portrays the life of a hustler in the inner city of their hometown, Memphis, Tennessee.

 For instance, Beauregard said they substituted Its messed up where I live but thats just how it is, for the lyrics: Its f***ed up where I live but thats just how it is.

 The song will be FCC friendly, Rosenberg said.

 Just in case, ABC is also expected 

 to use a five-second delay to aid network censors.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Shut down prison, UN tells US

 Detainees at Camp X-Ray in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba

 Geneva, Feb. 16 (Reuters): The US today faced mounting international calls to close its Guantanamo prison camp with UN investigators saying detainees there faced treatment amounting to torture.

 In a 40-page report, which had been largely leaked, five UN special envoys said the US was violating a host of human rights, including a ban on torture, arbitrary detention and the right to a fair trial.

 The report is likely to fuel new Arab anger over the treatment of Iraqi inmates at Baghdads US-run Abu Ghraib prison after Australian TV broadcast more images of abuse there.

 The US government should close the Guantanamo Bay detention facilities without further delay, the human rights rapporteurs declared.

 Until that happened, the US government should refrain from any practice amounting to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, they added.

 Harsh conditions, such as placing detainees in solitary confinement, stripping them naked, subjecting them to severe temperatures, and threatening them with dogs could amount to torture.

 In London, UN Human Rights Commissioner Louise Arbour told the BBC she saw no alternative to closing the prison at the US naval base in Cuba where some 500 terrorism suspects are held, many of them for four years.

 Speaking ahead of the release of the report, Arbour said that, although she did not endorse every recommendation it made, the US should put inmates on trial or release them and shut down the prison.

 Marquez town name

 Aracataca, Colombia, June 25 (Reuters): The people of Aracataca, where Gabriel Garcia Marquez was born and first heard the ghost stories that would inform the magic realism of his novels, voted today to decide whether to change the towns name to Macondo, the mythical village of his most celebrated novel.

 A banner stretching across the road leading to this impoverished community in Colombias northern banana-growing region already takes the new name for granted, saying Welcome to the magical world of Macondo.

 Macondo, as the Nobel laureates fans know, is the name of the fictitious town where his masterwork, One Hundred Years of Solitude unfolds.

 In the novel, Macondo is a place where anything can happen. It rains for four years after a massacre of banana workers and there is a plague of insomnia.

 China bar on tobacco ventures

 Beijing, Feb. 8 (Reuters): China will not allow new cigarette factories, including joint ventures with foreign partners, as part of efforts to reduce smoking in a country that puffs its way through almost 2 trillion cigarettes a year.

 Beijing would also impose strict controls on existing tobacco production, including taxes on tobacco leaf and industry re-organisation, Xinhua news agency quoted Sha Zukang, the ambassador to UN agencies in Geneva, as telling a conference.

 China is the worlds largest cigarette producer and Chinese are the worlds most enthusiastic smokers, with a growing market of about 320 million making it a magnet for multinationals and focus of international health concern.

 Chinese cigarettes are also among the cheapest in the world and smoking kills 1.2 million people a year in China, according to the World Health Organisation.

 In December, Philip Morris, a unit of Altria Group Inc. , announced a joint venture to produce Marlboro cigarettes in China. Its partner is state-owned China National Tobacco Corp.

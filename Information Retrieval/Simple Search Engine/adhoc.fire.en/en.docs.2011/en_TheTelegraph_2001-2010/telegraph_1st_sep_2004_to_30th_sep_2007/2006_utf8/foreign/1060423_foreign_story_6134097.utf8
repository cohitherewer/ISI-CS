 CIA officer fired over leak

 Washington, April 22 (Reuters): The CIA said today that it fired an intelligence officer for leaking classified information that sources said contributed to a Washington Post report about alleged secret CIA prisons in eastern Europe.

 NBC News identified the accused officer as Mary McCarthy, and said she worked in the CIA inspector generals office before being marched out of the spy agency on Thursday.

 CIA spokesman Tom Crispell said the agency could not comment on the NBC report, citing privacy law.

 Public records showed McCarthy, a veteran CIA officer, had served as a special assistant to former President Bill Clinton and President George W. Bush from 1996 to 2001. 

 She was a senior director for intelligence programmes on the White House National Security Council staff and testified to the commission that investigated the September 11 attacks on the US. Earlier, the CIA said the dismissal of a CIA officer over a media leak was extremely rare and resulted from a three-month-old in-house investigation aimed at agency operations that had been the subject of recent media leaks.

 Sources familiar with the case said the firing stemmed from the Washington Posts reporting about secret CIA prisons for terrorism suspects in November.

 Pak wild over Bush satire

 Islamabad, March 15 (Reuters): President George W. Bush went home two weeks ago, but ever since his visit Pakistanis have been watching multiple daily repeats of an animated television satire of his meeting with their own president.

 Geo News, a private Pakistani channel that also beams to North America and Europe, first ran the take off of Bush and President Pervez Musharraf addressing a news conference on March 4 ? just after hours after the two leaders had, indeed, held such a news conference.

 I am feeling lonely. Osama is also feeling lonely, Bush laments at one point, as the script made light of the US Presidents main reason for coming to Pakistan ? to check how committed Musharraf was in the war on terrorism and the hunt for al Qaida leader Osama bin Laden.

 The piece uses footage of the actual news conference, with computerised renditions of Bush and Musharrafs faces. It was first aired in English, but Geo quickly produced an Urdu version to reach a wider audience, and the channel has been running it several times a day since. 

 Its very funny, I have seen it three times, said Mohammad Aftab, a businessman in Rawalpindi. 

 Imran Aslam, president of Geo TV, said he had been engaged in political satire for decades, and had so far escaped with no more thana few rapped knuckles. Things could be bad under Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif.

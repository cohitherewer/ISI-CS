 Fine Print

 Friendly Aniston

 London, July 17 (AP): TVs most famous group of Friends may be headed for a reunion show, former cast member Jennifer Aniston says in a television interview.

 In the interview with the British 

 talk show Richard and Judy for Channel Four, Aniston 

 said she missed the show at times and would like to revive 

 her role as Rachel for a Thanksgiving special. The 

 only thing I can think of doing is maybe for fun doing a 

 Thanksgiving episode, Aniston said. Our Thanksgiving 

 episodes were really fun. 

 Sail circles

 Dublin (Reuters): Two Irish men, who 

 stole a fishing trawler after missing their ferry, had to 

 be rescued off the British coast where they were going in 

 circles because they did not know how to sail. After hours 

 at sea, the men called what they thought was the Irish coastguard 

 for help. In fact, the pair were just 19 km north of where 

 they started in Holyhead, England.

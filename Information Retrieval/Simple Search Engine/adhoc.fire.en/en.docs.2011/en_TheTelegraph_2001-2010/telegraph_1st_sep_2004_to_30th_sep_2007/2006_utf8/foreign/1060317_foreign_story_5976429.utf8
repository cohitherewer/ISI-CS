 Businesses hit hard by Nepal ban

 Kathmandu, March 16 (Reuters): A blockade ordered by Maoist rebels kept most vehicles off roads across Nepal for a third straight day today, disrupting food and other supplies and hitting businesses hard, industry officials and residents said.

 The rebel called the blockade of Kathmandu, district capitals and other cities in a bid to end the absolute rule of King Gyanendra.

 Authorities have urged drivers to defy the rebels, offering armed escorts to vehicles willing to risk it, but most roads across the mountainous nation were all but deserted.

 The royalist government has also said drivers could lose their road permits if they refused to work. 

 Industries are on the verge of being closed due to the blockade, said Bijay Sarawagi, chief of the Birgunj unit of the Federation of the Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry. Birgunj is a major business centre in the southern plains.

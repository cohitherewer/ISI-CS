 Superbug risk in unlicensed tattoos

 New York, June 28 (Reuters): People who get tattoos from unlicensed sources are at risk of developing a drug-resistant bacterial skin infection, federal health officials warn.

 Six recent outbreaks of infections with this superbug, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) have been traced to unlicensed tattoo artists, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

 MRSA infection typically manifests as abscesses or areas of inflammation on the skin, though it can also lead to more serious problems such as pneumonia, blood infections or, in some cases, necrotising fasciitis, also referred to as the flesh-eating disease.

 The six tattoo-related outbreaks affected 44 people in Kentucky, Ohio and Vermont. Thirty-four had recently got a tattoo from an unlicensed source, while 10 others contracted the infection from close contact with the tattoo recipients. The tattooists in many cases did not follow standard hygiene practices.

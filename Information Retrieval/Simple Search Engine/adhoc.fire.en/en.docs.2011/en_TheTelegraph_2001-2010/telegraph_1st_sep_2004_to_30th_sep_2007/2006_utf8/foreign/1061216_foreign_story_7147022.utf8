 Court confirms jail term for Ershad

 Ershad: Setback

 Dhaka, Dec. 15 (Reuters): The Bangladesh high court confirmed yesterday a two-year jail sentence for Ershad after a lower court convicted him of squandering state funds in a deal to buy patrol boats from Japan when he was in power from 1982 to 1990.

 Ershad, who leads the small Jatiya party, cannot contest the election set for January 23 unless his conviction is overturned by the Supreme Court.

 The verdict triggered accusations of political interference by the head of a multi-party alliance Ershad had planned to join to contest the elections.

 He is being fixed for not pledging loyalty to Khaleda and the court verdict was remote-controlled, said the head of the alliance, Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina, referring to her arch-foe Begum Khaleda Zia.

 Hasina has been campaigning for the removal of election officials it accuses of bias towards the Khaledas Bangladesh National Party.

 Hasina has also demanded President Iajuddin Ahmed step aside as head of an interim administration for failing to show neutrality.

 Khaleda stepped down as Prime Minister in October, handing over to the President whos role is to prepare the nation for elections.

 Hundreds of Ershads supporters blocked a highway in Sylhet 350 km northeast of Dhaka for several hours today.

 The protesters also damaged a number vehicles during the blockade before police dispersed them using batons. At least 10 people were injured. Ershads supporters have called for a protest in Dhaka, police said.

 There was no immediate comment from Ershad on the court sentence.

 Khaleda and Hasina had joined forces in late 1990 to topple Ershad from power.

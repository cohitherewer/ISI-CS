 Revere all faiths, says Pope

 Vatican City, Sept. 28 (Reuters): Still under a cloud for recent remarks about Islam, Pope Benedict today called for tolerance of other religions and cultures and a reverence for what is sacred to others.

 The German pontiff told Berlins new ambassador to the Vatican that the Roman Catholic Church would never force anyone to accept the teachings of Jesus Christ.

 Muslim leaders worldwide have criticised Benedict for a speech hinting that Islam had been spread by the sword and brought only evil to the world. The Pope has expressed regret at the uproar four times but has not withdrawn his words.

 Tolerance and cultural openness must characterise meetings with other people, he told ambassador Hans-Henning Horstmann. The Church does not impose itself, because the faith in Jesus Christ that it proclaims can only occur in freedom.

 Quoting a sermon he gave during a trip to Bavaria, Benedict said the world needed a tolerance that includes reverence for God, a reverence for what is sacred to others.

 He warned against confusing tolerance with outright indifference. Real tolerance always requires respect for other people, who are creations of God and whose existence has been reaffirmed by God.

 Hendrix songs right

 New York, Oct. 29 (AP): An unidentified bidder spent $15 million to purchase guitar legend Jimi Hendrixs entire song catalogue, but the rock stars family said that the music, including classics like Purple Haze and Voodoo Chile, still belongs to them.

 The rights to the rock legends songs were auctioned off on Thursday by the estate of former Hendrix manager Michael Frank Jeffrey, said a spokeswoman for Ocean Tomo Auctions. 

 A Hendrix family spokesman said the term winner was relative. 

 You may buy the right to become a defendant in a lawsuit, said Bob Merlis, a spokesman for Experience Hendrix, a Seattle-based company owned by the family. If someone infringes on our rights, well deal with it.

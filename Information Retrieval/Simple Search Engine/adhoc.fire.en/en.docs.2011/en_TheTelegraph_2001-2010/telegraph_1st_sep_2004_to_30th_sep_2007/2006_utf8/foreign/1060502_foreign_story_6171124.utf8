 Former Playmate set to grab millions

 Smith: New chance

 Washington, May 1 (Reuters): Former Playmate of the Year Anna Nicole Smith won from the US supreme court today a new chance to collect millions of dollars she claims her late Texas oil tycoon husband promised her.

 The justices unanimously overturned a US appeals court ruling that the blonde widow was entitled to nothing because federal courts lacked jurisdiction to hear claims that are also involved in state probate hearings.

 The high court sent the case back to the federal appeals court in California for more proceedings in the long-running legal battle involving the former Playboy centerfold who also had her own reality television show.

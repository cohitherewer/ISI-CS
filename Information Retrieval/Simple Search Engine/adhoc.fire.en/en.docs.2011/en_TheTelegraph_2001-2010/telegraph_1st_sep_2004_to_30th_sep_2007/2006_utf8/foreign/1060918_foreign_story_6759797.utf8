 Comment cloud on nun death

 Mogadishu, Sept. 17 (Reuters): Gunmen killed an Italian nun at a childrens hospital in Mogadishu today in an attack that drew immediate speculation of links to Muslim anger over the Popes recent remarks on Islam.

 The Catholic nuns guard also died from pistol shots in the latest attack on foreign personnel in volatile Somalia.

 The assassinations were a blow to Mogadishus new Islamist rulers attempt to prove they have pacified one of the worlds most lawless cities since chasing out warlords in June.

 The bodyguard died instantly, but the nun, from the Missionaries of the Consolation order based in Nepi near Rome, was rushed into an operating theatre after being hit by three or four bullets in the chest, stomach and back.

 She died in the hospital treatment room, doctor Ali Mohamed Hassan said. She was shot outside the hospital, going to her house just across the gate.

 A nun from the Missionaries order identified her as sister Leonella Sgorbati, born in 1940, in Piacenza in northern Italy. In Somalia since 2002, she trained nurses at the SOS Kindergarten hospital.

 The Italian government said the nun and two other Italian nuns working with her had been repeatedly advised to leave Somalia, which was formerly ruled by Italy.

 Todays death provoked scenes of mourning at the hospital. I was in class when I heard about six to eight shots, I ran out and saw sister bleeding, Fatuma Hassan, 21, said. Were so sad. Its a big loss.

 Two suspects were later arrested by Islamist militiamen, but there were no details of their identity.

 One top Islamist source said there was a very high possibility the attack was linked to the controversy over the Popes remarks.

 Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi told Italian news agency ANSA he hoped the nuns death was an isolated event but feared it was the fruit of violence and irrationality arising from the current situation (of Pope), which is without motive or reason.

 But in Italy, a nun from Sgorbatis order said: We have no reason to suspect any link. She said: There were no threats, we had no reason to expect something like this, though there are risks.

 Borne out of local courts practicing strict Shariat law, the Islamist movement in June seized Mogadishu from US-backed warlords who had run it for the past 15 years.

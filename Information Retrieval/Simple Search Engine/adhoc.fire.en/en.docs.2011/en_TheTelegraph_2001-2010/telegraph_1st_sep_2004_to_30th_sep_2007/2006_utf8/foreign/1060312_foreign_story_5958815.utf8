 Butcher of Balkans found dead in cell

 Slobodan Milosevic: Strongman 

 retires 

 The Hague, March 11 (Reuters): Slobodan Milosevic ? branded the Butcher of the Balkans for the wars that tore Yugoslavia apart in the 1990s ? was found dead in his cell today, just months before his trial was expected to conclude.

 Milosevic was found lifeless on his bed in his cell, the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague said.

 The court said a medical officer confirmed that the 64-year-old former Yugoslav President ? who suffered from a heart condition and high blood pressure ? was dead, adding the Dutch police and a coroner had launched an inquiry.

 A tribunal spokeswoman said there was no indication Milosevic had committed suicide. She said the trial ? which has already lasted four years ? would end now he was dead.

 Milosevic rose to the top of Yugoslav politics in the power vacuum left by the 1980 death of post-World War II Yugoslav dictator Marshal Tito. Elected Serbian President in 1990, he ruled with an iron grip until his overthrow in 2000.

 With the death of Milosevic, one of the main actors, if not the main actor, in the Balkan wars of the late 20th century has left the scene, French foreign minister Philippe Douste-Blazy said.

 Milosevic was charged with 66 counts of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes in Bosnia, Croatia and Kosovo as he sought to carve out a Greater Serbia as Yugoslavia broke up in the 1990s. He dismissed the trial and refused to plead.

 The charges against him included involvement in the siege of Sarajevo during the 1992-95 Bosnia war and the 1995 massacre of 8,000 Muslims in the UN safe area of Srebrenica, Europes worst single atrocity since World War II.

 Milosevics ill health had repeatedly interrupted his trial that started in February 2002 and had been expected to end this year. Last month, the court rejected Milosevics bid to go to Russia for medical treatment, noting the trial was almost over.

 Looking pale and with his shock of white hair swept back, Milosevic ? sent to the tribunal in 2001 ? said last month his health was worsening and he was hearing noises in his head.

 Milosevics wife Mirjana, his high-school sweetheart often described as the driving force behind his career, blamed the court.The tribunal has killed my husband, she told CNN.

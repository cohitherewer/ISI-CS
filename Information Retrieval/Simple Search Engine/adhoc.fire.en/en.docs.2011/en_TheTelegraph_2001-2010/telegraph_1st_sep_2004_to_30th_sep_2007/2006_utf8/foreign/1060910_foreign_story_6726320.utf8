 Bridget pants

 London, Sept. 9 (AP): The famously large underpants worn by film character Bridget Jones are to be auctioned off to raise cash for some of Londons most famous green spaces, Britains Royal Parks Foundation announced yesterday.

 The large, white underwear was worn by actress Renee Zellweger in her role in Bridget Joness Diary, and prompted the comment: Hello, mummy! from Hugh Grant, who played her suitor, Daniel Cleaver.

 The underwear was signed by Grant, and will be auctioned off at a charity dinner next week for the foundation. Organisers hope the dinner will raise 100,000 for the Royal Parks, which provided the setting for scenes in the second film in the series, Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason.

 Baseball fever

 But a 47-year-old primary school teacher in Osaka found himself in trouble after pupils complained that he watched the game, played on Wednesday night in the US but broadcast live from midday Thursday in Japan, while proctoring a test they were taking.

 Bush war

 Lima (AP): Carlos Santana quoted his old friend Jimi Hendrix 

in an anti-war message here on Monday and said his philosophy is the antithesis 

of President George W. Bushs. I have wisdom. I feel love. I live in 

the present and I try to present a dimension that brings harmony and healing, 

the 58-year-old rock icon said. My concept is the opposite of George W. 

Bush. Santana, speaking to Peruvian journalists ahead of a concert, said 

young peoples opposition to the war in Iraq is reaching the dimensions of 

the anti-Vietnam war sentiment in the 1970s. There is more value in placing 

a flower in a rifle barrel than making war, he said.

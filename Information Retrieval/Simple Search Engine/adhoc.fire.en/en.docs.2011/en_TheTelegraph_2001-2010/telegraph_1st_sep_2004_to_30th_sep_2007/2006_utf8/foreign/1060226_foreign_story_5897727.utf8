 Saudi threats

 Abqaiq (Saudi Arabia), Feb. 25 (Reuters): Al Qaida in Saudi Arabia claimed responsibility today for an attack on a Saudi oil facility at Abqaiq, when security forces fired at suicide bombers trying to storm the worlds biggest oil processing plant.

 It vowed more attacks in the kingdom and named two suicide attackers who died, according to a Web posting. The posting attributed to the group named the attackers as Mohammed al-Ghaith and Abdullah al-Tweijri and said yesterdays attack came in response to a call by Osama bin Laden to target oil installations.

 The attack was the first direct strike on a Saudi oil target since al Qaida attacks aimed at toppling Saudi Arabias U.S.-allied monarchy in 2003. The statement posted on the website said: With grace from God alone, hero mujahideen from the squadron of Sheikh Osama bin Laden succeeded today (Friday)...in penetrating a plant for refining oil and gas in the town of Abqaiq in the eastern part of the peninsula, and then allowed two car bombs in driven by two martyrdom seekers, it said.

 It said the raid was within the framework of efforts to prevent the theft of Muslims wealth bycrusaders and Jews.

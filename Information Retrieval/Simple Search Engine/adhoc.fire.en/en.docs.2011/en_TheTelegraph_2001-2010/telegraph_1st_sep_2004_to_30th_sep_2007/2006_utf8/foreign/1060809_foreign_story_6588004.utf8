 Fine Print

 Janet expose

 New York, Aug. 8 (AP): Janet Jackson has never been afraid to expose some skin.

 The 40-year-old singer, newly svelte after losing some 28 kg, appears on the cover of Vibe magazine wearing a skimpy bikini bottom and a necklace made of large shells. Her right arm covers her breasts. 

 Will she ever stop posing for sexy photos? Of course. When Im 80, she tells Vibe. Thats when Ill call it quits. Two years ago, Justin Timberlake pulled off a part of Jacksons bustier, briefly exposing one of her breasts, during the Super Bowl half-time show.

 Paul police

 London (AP): A security guard at Paul 

 McCartneys London home called police when one of his 

 estranged wifes guards climbed a wall to let her in, 

 a spokesman for Heather Mills McCartney said on Tuesday. 

 Mills McCartneys security guard climbed a wall to 

 open a gate after realising the locks at the home had been 

 changed, said her spokesman, Phil Hall. A guard inside called 

 police, who spoke to Mills McCartney and left, Hall said. 

 Mills McCartney then entered the house with the couples 

 daughter, Beatrice, 2, and stayed the night, he said. 

 Ape alarm

 Nicosia, Cyprus (Reuters): Is it a mysterious ape? Someones lost pet monkey or the product of overactive imaginations? Whatever it is, Cypriot authorities are searching for a stray primate reported to have tapped on windows at dinner time to beg for food near the western resort town of Paphos. Police could not say whether they thought the animal was an ape or a monkey, but said there was no cause for alarm. 

 Thai ban

 Bangkok (Reuters): Thai cultural watchdogs 

 have banned a line of condoms whose name translates as Good 

 Penetration, saying the suggestive label could draw 

 youngsters into having sex earlier, newspapers reported 

 on Tuesday. The condoms are actually named Tom Dundee 

 after the stage name of a popular country singer, but officials 

 said this offended good norms and culture, the Thai Rath 

 tabloid said.

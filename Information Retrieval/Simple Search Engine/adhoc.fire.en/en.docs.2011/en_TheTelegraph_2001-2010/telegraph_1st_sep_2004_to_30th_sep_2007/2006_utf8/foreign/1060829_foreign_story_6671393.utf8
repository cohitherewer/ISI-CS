 Fine Print

 Britney cover

 Tokyo, Aug. 28 (Reuters): Tokyos subway allowed a publisher to display posters of a nude and heavily pregnant Britney Spears today, overturning a decision to cover up part of the image for being too stimulating for young people. 

 The picture of the pop singer nude but covering her breasts with her arms and crossing her legs at the knee appeared in the August issue of Harpers Bazaar in the US and will be on the cover of the magazines Japanese edition for October.

 Tokyo Metro and the publishers had initially agreed to display a censored version of the cover photo, with the pop stars body covered from the elbow down.

 Fine Print

 Aniston silence

 New York, April 5 (AP): Silence. Awkward silence.

 That was Jennifer Anistons tightlipped response to yesterdays Today show when asked about the latest rumour that Oprah Winfrey is planning to host an $8 million wedding for her and beau Vince Vaughn.

 The moment grew still more awkward when Anistons Friends with Money co-star, Catherine Keener, weighed in on her behalf. I thought you werent going to go there, she told entertainment correspondent Jill Rappaport. 

 Earlier in the interview, Aniston said she gives interviews to promote a movie, not her personal life.

 Sick shots

 Singapore (Reuters): A Singapore doctor who used his mobile 

phone camera to secretly film up the skirts of women was jailed for two months, 

a local newspaper said. The Straits Times said the doctor was persistently 

walking close to a 20-year-old woman at a supermarket, carrying a grocery basket 

with his mobile phone facing up inside the basket, and positioning it close to 

the victims legs.

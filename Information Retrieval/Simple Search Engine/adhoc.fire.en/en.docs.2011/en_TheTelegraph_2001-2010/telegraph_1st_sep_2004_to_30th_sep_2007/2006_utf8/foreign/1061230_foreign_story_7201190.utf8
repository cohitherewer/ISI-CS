 Fuss over British roles leaves Renee clueless

 New York, Dec. 29 (Reuters): American actress Renee Zellweger doesnt know what all the fuss is over her playing British women.

 Zellweger created a stir several years ago when she landed the coveted role of the lonely London singleton Bridget Jones, adapted from Helen Fieldings best-selling book Bridget Joness Diary. She famously took speech lessons before landing the part, beating a host of British actresses.

 Now she is playing another British figure in Miss Potter, a biopic of English literary phenomenon Beatrix Potter, whose early 20th century childrens books, including The Tale of Peter Rabbit, remain bestsellers. 

 But Zellweger says that compared to the fictional Bridget Jones, playing Potter, who died in 1943, brought different expectations. I guess the difference was there are clearly more people to disappoint, Zellweger, 37, said in an interview. I wont say that Helen Fielding didnt create a character that was embraced by British culture, but Beatrix was a part of the fibre of British literature in a very substantial way. 

 Zellweger, who helped bring Miss Potter to the screen as an executive producer, said her origins may add to any attention, including whether she can again lose any Texas twang. It is just work. It is part of the process, she said of perfecting the English accent.

 Its much more exciting to talk about blaspheming the language because youre from Texas, I guess.

 Zellweger said she suspected the press attention given to her accent and weight made for exciting tabloid headlines. She became media fodder after gaining weight to play Bridget Jones. Its disheartening, because it is a reflection of what it is that we value, she said. And it is a superficiality that does not deserve the focus of energy that it gets; its boring.

 But the amicable Zellweger is mostly positive about her experience. And while she is not actively seeking British roles its just been sort of chance she said she has long felt a calling. I love British humour and the way people communicate. That, and Paul McCartney comes from England.

 Bush tries to mend ties

 St Petersburg, July 15: President George W Bush insisted yesterday that he had a solid friendship with Vladimir Putin despite months of declining and often bitter relations between Washington and Moscow.

 The American leader visited St Petersburg before tomorrows Group of Eight Summit, which is the first Russia has hosted and is a major step in establishing its global reputation.

 It was an awkward meeting designed to bridge differences but Bush and his aides faced a difficult balancing act in expressing their concern over the Russian Presidents authoritarianism while not alienating a man whose support they badly need in a range of foreign crises.

 The President sought to tweak Putins tail by meeting activists from non-governmental organisations, including supporters of Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the jailed oil billionaire. Many of them have faced intense pressure from the Kremlin to rein in their activities as part of what Russias critics say is a drive to roll back democratic freedoms.

 Bush emerged from the meeting to say he had spent a lot of time listening to their concerns.

 He said he had told the 15 activists that we believe in universal values embedded in democracy, we believe in the rule of law, we believe in human rights.

 The one upbeat moment came when the two leaders surveyed Putins first car, a Zaporozhets bought in 1972 and shared a joke over its Soviet-era simplicity. Bush revealed that his first vehicle was a Triumph.

 As he faced questions on his way in, the American President told journalists to find some Russian vodka and relax.

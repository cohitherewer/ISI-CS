The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Mass boycott of Danish goods

 Ramallah, West Bank, Feb. 5 (Reuters): Mahdi Karaji, a fan of Danish-made cheese and butter, filled his supermarket trolley this weekend with Palestinian-made dairy products.

 The insult to our prophet was very deep and this is the least I can do, the 45-year-old emergency physician said of his decision to join a Muslim boycott of Danish goods to protest cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad printed in European newspapers.

 In the West Bank city of Nablus, about 30 masked gunmen gathered outside the French Cultural Centre, shooting in the air and demanding that the centre be closed. 

 But most Palestinians protesting the publication of the cartoons did so peacefully with their pocketbooks.

 A vast majority of Palestinian shoppers interviewed over the weekend in the West Bank vowed not to buy Danish cheese spread, butter and other products until European governments apologised.

 They have committed a grave insult against Islam, Haifa Siyam, 61, said inside the Bravo supermarket chain, the biggest in the Palestinian territories.

 The boycott is already having an economic impact. Danish-Swedish dairy company Arla Foods said on Friday it is losing about $1.8 million of sales a day in the West Asia. 

 Its products have been taken off store shelves in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Kuwait.

 My boycott is a message to the Danish government that you have crossed the red light, said Siham Rayyan, a teacher from Ramallah.

 Zuhair Osaily, general manager of the Arab Palestinian Shopping Centres, which owns Bravo, said his stores have slashed shelf space for Danish goods from three metres to 30 cm.

 There is a phenomenal drop in demand for Danish products, Osaily said.Even some customers ask us, Why do you still keep them on the shelves?

 Osaily said he was keeping some Danish products on the shelves for foreigners living in Ramallah, not for Palestinians.

 We can make it without (Danish) spread cheese, said Karaji, risking the ire of his four children, who love the cream cheese.

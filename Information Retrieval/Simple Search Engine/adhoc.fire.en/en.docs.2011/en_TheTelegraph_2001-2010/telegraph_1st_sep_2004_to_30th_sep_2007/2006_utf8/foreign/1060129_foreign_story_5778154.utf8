 Plans to curb Pak organ sale

 IMTIAZ GUL 

 Islamabad, Jan. 28: Following in Indias footsteps, Pakistan plans to enact a law which will curb the illegal practice of selling and buying kidneys. 

 Thousands of kidneys are sold every year in several Pakistani hospitals due to the absence of a law barring the sale of human organs.

 We have to stop exploitation of the poor and to achieve this important objective, we are working on a comprehensive law that will award stringent punishments to all those who entice the poor into selling kidneys, health minister Naseer Khan said in Islamabad.

 At Oscars, what lies beneath

 Los Angeles, March 4 (Reuters): Its what you dont see the stars wearing at the Oscars that really provides the va-va-voom on the red carpet.

 If a star wants to turn heads, she has to start with what no one sees ? the perfect undergarment to build up the bosom or minimise the backside.

 Lingerie has joined the gowns, jewellery and handbags loaned or given to actresses by firms eager for the publicity associated with tomorrows Oscars and other awards shows. But there are potential pitfalls, whether an ill-fitting garment, or ill-mannered observer.

 Designer Isaac Mizrahi, an awards show fashion commentator for cable television, was so intrigued by Scarlett Johanssons bra at the Golden Globes that he groped the actresss breast while interviewing her.

 Most stars lingerie choices remain a mystery, but Keira Knightley, Hilary Swank and Naomi Watts plan to wear a simple G-string ? smaller than a thong ? underneath their gowns on Oscar night, the Miami-based lingerie company Cosabella said. Some figure challenges demand more elaborate solutions.

 Finding the perfect lingerie for body-revealing gowns becomes difficult when the girl doesnt have a bust, said Parisian lingerie designer Chantal Thomass, who uses foam linings to pump up the decolletage. But with too much up top, its not so beautiful, she said.

 Robert Behar, who designed Dolly Partons Oscar outfits, said the secret often lies within the dress itself.

 When it comes to evening gowns, the most important is the foundation that is built inside the dresses, said Behar, who also has worked with stars Sharon Stone and Janet Jackson.

 If you need to have your dress changing parts of your body, then you should build it within your dress, he said.

 Stars at past awards shows have asked London-based lingerie line Agent Provocateur for padded bras and corsets.

 One woman with a 66-cm waist wanted a corset to slim her to 56 cm. 

 She nearly passed out at the event, marketing head Jess Morris said. 

 Another with a small bust wore a padded bra that did too good a job.

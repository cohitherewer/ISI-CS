 Still friends despite kiss

 Los Angeles, Oct. 18 (Reuters): 

 Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston are still a couple despite 

 tabloid press reports to the contrary and recent photographs 

 showing the comic actor kissing a mystery blonde, a London 

 lawyer said yesterday.

 The lawyer, Simon Smith, said he had been instructed by Vaughn to sue Britains Sun and Mirror newspapers and the New York Post for publishing a photo of the actor kissing a mystery blonde whilst attending a charity event ... at Londons Old Vic theatre.

 He added that the articles suggested that Vaughn was either unfaithful to Aniston, the ex-wife of movie star Brad Pitt, or that their relationship had ended. In fact, he said, the couples relationship was continuing and the suggestion he was being unfaithful to the former Friends star was false. A spokesman for Vaughn confirmed that Smith was representing the actor in the legal action and that the Hollywood pair, who recently co-starred in the film The Break-Up, were still a couple off-screen. Aniston and Vaughn had until recently gone to great lengths not to discuss or reveal their relationship, which began after her marriage to Pitt collapsed.

 Moss conflict

 JEREMY MCDERMOTT

 Medellin (Colombia), Nov. 2: 

 Colombias vice-president accused celebrity cocaine 

 users yesterday of fuelling conflict in his country.

 Francisco Santos, who launched his cocaine curse campaign, reserved particular criticism for the British model Kate Moss. Santos said consumption of the drug in Europe fuelled the finances of rebels in Colombia.

 It was baffling that Moss had won modelling contracts after admitting she had a cocaine problem and checked herself into a rehabilitation clinic for a month last year.

 To me its baffling, that somebody who helps cause so much pain in Colombia is doing better than ever and winning more contracts than ever, he said. And I never once heard her say: Im sorry. When in Colombia, policemen, judges, journalists, common men and women are dying every day because of cocaine consumption, that hurts. Moss lost several contracts after she was photographed allegedly taking cocaine. No criminal charges were brought against Moss and she publicly accepted responsibility for the scandal.

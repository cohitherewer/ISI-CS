 Fine Print

 Taxi trick

 Santiago, Oct. 21 (Reuters): A Chilean taxi driver has come up with a new way to fight assaults: make your vehicle so conspicuous that nobody would dare try to rob you.

 After being robbed several times, Juan Geraldo upholstered and covered every square inch of his cars interior with black and white spotted cowhides, including the steering wheel and ceiling. He then decorated the interior with stuffed toy cows, and added a horn that moos.

 The visual effect is even more impressive at night, when the black and white taxi interior is set off from floor to ceiling by a flood of neon light. The effect was immediate. They havent robbed me since, said Geraldo. 

 Jail bird

 Berlin (Reuters): A 59-year-old German man who has spent the last 34 years in jail has turned down offers to be let out, an official said on Saturday. He rejected an offer to leave in 1992, Thomas Melzer, a spokesman for the Brandenburg state justice ministry, told Bild newspaper. We cant do anything if someone sentenced to life in prison doesnt want to leave. The man, identified only as Gerold H, was convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment in 1972.

 Nanny spy

 New York (Reuters): Just as trucking companies put signs on their vehicles asking the public to report unsafe drivers, parents can now put licence plates on their baby strollers to get feedback on the behaviour of their nannies. Jill Starishevsky, a mother of two and a New York prosecutor, launched HowsMyNanny.com on Thursday, which sells stroller licence plates that have a unique number and include the website address so the public can anonymously report good or bad nanny behaviour. The parents, who pay $50 for a plate, receive an e-mail alerting them to the report, which they access on the website using a password.

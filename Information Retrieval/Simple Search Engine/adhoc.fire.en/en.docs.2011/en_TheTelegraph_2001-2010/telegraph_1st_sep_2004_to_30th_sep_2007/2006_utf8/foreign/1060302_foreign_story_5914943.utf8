 Swank muse for new French perfume

 Swank: Genuine

 New York, March 1 (AP): Hilary Swank will be both muse and spokesperson for a new womens fragrance by Guerlain to be launched later this year.

 In making the announcement on Monday, Guerlain described the 31-year-old actress, an Oscar winner for her roles in Million Dollar Baby and Boys Dont Cry, as a radiant and natural beauty who does not conform to stereotypes.

 Her background of always opting for the more challenging and risky roles coupled with her warm and genuine personality, a far cry from the usual Hollywood mould, were all factors that made her an obvious choice for Guerlain, the luxury French fragrance and beauty company said in a statement.

 Guerlain said it has a three-year contract with Swank. A spokeswoman for the company declined to comment on Monday on the terms of the deal or the details of the fragrance.

 Patti Hansen, who is married to Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones, represented Guerlains musky fragrance Shalimar Light in 2004.

 Other Oscar winners who have represented fragrances include Nicole Kidman for Chanel No. 5 and Gwyneth Paltrow for Estee Lauders Pleasures.

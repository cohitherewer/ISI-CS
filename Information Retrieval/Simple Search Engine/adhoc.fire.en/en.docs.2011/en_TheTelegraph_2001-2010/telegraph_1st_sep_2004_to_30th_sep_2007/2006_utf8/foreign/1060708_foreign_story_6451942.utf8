 Pak relief for jailed women

 Islamabad, July 7 (Reuters): Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf approved legislation today that will allow some 1,300 women jailed for minor crimes to be freed on bail.

 The President today signed an ordinance that has allowed women languishing in jail to be released on bail, except those held on murder and terrorism charges, minister for women and youth affairs, Sumaira Malik, said.

 She added that around 1,300 jailed women stood to be freed on bail as a result of the Presidents decision.

 However, it was unclear whether the change would effect women imprisoned under Pakistans Islamic penal code, known as the Hudood Ordinance, which enforces punishments for crimes such as adultery, rape and theft. 

 The Hudood laws were promulgated in 1980s by former military ruler General Zia-ul-Haq.

 Government officials say around 1,600 women are jailed across the country and about 300 of them are facing murder and terrorism charges. But rights activists say the number of women in prison is far greater, and the majority of them are facing charges under Hudood laws.

 Civil and women rights groups have long called for the repeal of Hudood laws which they say discriminate against women.

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Islamabad, March 7: As the war of words escalates between Pakistan and Afghanistan, the commander-in-chief of the US central command (Centcom), John P. Abizaid, arrived in Islamabad today to neutralise the tensions between the two American allies.

 Abizaid is in Islamabad on President Pervez Musharrafs invitation who has been furious over recent allegations by the Afghan leadership that Pakistan is not doing enough to check cross-border infiltrations of al Qaida and Taliban operatives.

 An US embassy official said in Islamabad today that the Centcom chief would meet the Pakistan President to follow up discussions between Musharraf and President George W. Bush last Saturday.

 The official added that the talks would focus on the cooperation between the two countries in the war on terrorism.

 Musharraf accused the Afghan defence ministry of conspiring against Pakistan and bringing into disrepute its role as the frontline state in the anti-terror war.

 Afghan governments allegations that Pakistan is not doing enough to curb cross border infiltrations are nonsensical, Musharraf said.

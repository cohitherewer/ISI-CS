 Rushdie struggles for energy

 Warsaw, Oct. 4 (AP): British novelist Salman Rushdie said yesterday that he has to struggle more to find the energy to write as he gets older, but he has developed greater control over his writing.

 I used to write much more in a day than I write now, but it was much less finished, said Rushdie, who was in Warsaw for three days on his first visit to Poland. When you are young, the battle is for control, when you are older, the battle is for energy.

 He told a meeting of journalists that he is happy when he writes 300 words a day, but he has to give the writing the first energy of the day.

 Before you read the newspapers, before you open the mail, before you look at the email, before you telephone anybody, you do your writing. I do it often even before I get dressed. In my pajamas.

 Jokingly, he advised everyone against being the subject of a fatwa like the one Khomeini issued against him.

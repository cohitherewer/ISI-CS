 Heathrow travel chaos

 London, Aug. 13 (AP): Airlines cancelled almost a third of flights from Britains busiest airport today, plunging travellers into a fourth day of travel chaos triggered by the foiling of an alleged airplane bomb plot.

 British Airways said it had scrapped 30 per cent of flights from Londons Heathrow Airport on the instructions of the airport operator British Airports Authority, or BAA.

 The airport operator said 70 per cent of flights on all airlines at Heathrow were expected to operate, but warned that tough new screening measures for passengers and luggage meant delays were inevitable.

 BAAs chief executive for Heathrow, Tony Douglas, said the airport was doing its best, but that delays will go on until the security threat level is reduced.

 After the foiled plot, authorities introduced tough security measures, including individual searches of all passengers and a ban on carry-on luggage except clear plastic bags containing travel documents and a few essential items.

 Today, British Airways cancelled almost 100 flights to Europe from Heathrow and scrapped all its domestic flights from Londons second airport, Gatwick. Most long-haul flights were operating, although 10 BA services to the US were cancelled.

 Scores of flights to Europe and the US also were cancelled yesterday. Passengers were delayed so long by the strict new security measures that many missed their flights.

 British Airways said in a statement that it cannot rule out the possibility that flights will once again depart without all their passengers because of ongoing problems with BAAs security search process and baggage operation at Heathrow Airport.

 Some airlines accused BAA which operates seven of the countrys major airports of failing to cope with the new anti-terror security systems. 

 The airports baggage system cannot process all of the passengers bags and where passengers have been able to check their bags in, the lengthy queues in the airport security search area means that passengers are unable to get to the departure gate in time for their flight, BA chief executive Willie Walsh said.

 Budget carrier Ryanair urged the government to use police and army reservists to speed up searches at overloaded airport security checkpoints and said the need to search all passengers should be eased.

 We dont need to be body searching young children travelling with their parents on holiday to Spain, Ryanair CEO Michael Leary said.

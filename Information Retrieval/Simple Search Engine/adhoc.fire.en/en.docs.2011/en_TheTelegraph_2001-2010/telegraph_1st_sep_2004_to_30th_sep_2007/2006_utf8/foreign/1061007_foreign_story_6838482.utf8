 Nato bosses: Pak helping Taliban

 Kabul, Oct. 6: Commanders from five Nato countries whose troops have just fought the bloodiest battle with the Taliban in five years, are demanding their governments get tough with Pakistan over the support and sanctuary its security services provide to the Taliban.

 Natos report on Operation Medusa, an intense battle that lasted from September 4-17 in the Panjwai district, demonstrates the extent of the Talibans military capability and states clearly that Pakistans ISI is involved in supplying it.

 Commanders from Britain, the US, Denmark, Canada and Holland are frustrated that even after Pakistans President Pervez Musharraf met George W. Bush and Tony Blair last week, western leaders are declining to call Musharrafs bluff.

 It is time for an either you are with us or against us delivered bluntly to Musharraf at the highest political level, said one Nato commander.

 After the September 11 attacks in 2001, America gave Musharraf a similar ultimatum to co-operate against the Taliban, who were then harbouring Osama bin Laden.

 Our boys in southern Afghanistan are hurting because of what is coming out of Quetta, he added.

 The Taliban use the southern province of Baluchistan to co-ordinate their insurgency and to recuperate after military action.

 The cushion Pakistan is providing the Taliban is undermining the operation in Afghanistan, where 31,000 Nato troops are now based. The Canadians were most involved in Operation Medusa, two weeks of heavy fighting in a lush vineyard region, defeating 1,500 well entrenched Taliban, who had planned to attack Kandahar.

 Nato officials now say they killed 1,100 Taliban fighters, not the 500 originally claimed. Hundreds of Taliban reinforcements in pick-up trucks who crossed over from Quetta waved on by Pakistani border guards were destroyed by Nato air and artillery strikes. Nato captured 160 Taliban, many of them Pakistanis who described in detail the ISIs support to the Taliban.

 Nato is now mapping the entire Taliban support structure in Baluchistan, from ISI- run training camps near Quetta to huge ammunition dumps, arrival points for Talibans new weapons and meeting places of the shura, or leadership council, in Quetta.

 Nato and Afghan officers say two training camps for the Taliban are located just outside Quetta, while the group is using hundreds of madarsas where the fighters are housed and fired up ideologically before being sent to the front.

 Many madarsas now being listed are run by the Jamiat-e-Ullema Islam, a political party that governs Baluchistan and the North West Frontier Province. 

 During the battle, the Taliban fired an estimated 400,000 rounds of ammunition, 2,000 rocket-propelled grenades and 1,000 mortar shells, which slowly arrived in Panjwai from Quetta over the spring months.

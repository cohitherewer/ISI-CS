 Bangla meeting crisis

 Mahmudur Rahman

 Dhaka, Nov. 26 (Reuters): Bangladeshs political crisis deepened further today after the interim government said it would investigate reports that key state officials attended a secret late-night meeting hosted by a former ministry adviser.

 Leaders of a 14-party alliance locked in a furious struggle with the former ruling coalition ahead of general elections in January accused the participants of plotting to rig the polls.

 Fridays meeting, at an office owned by Mahmudur Rahman, adviser to the energy ministry under the previous Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) government, was revealed by reporters.

 Television footage showed participants trying to avoid the cameras but some were identified either as retired or serving state officials.

 Mahmudur, who also served as executive chairman of the Bangladesh Board of Investment, could be seen trying to reason with reporters as his guests fled. He said he had invited them over to visit his new office, but could not say why it had to be late at night.

 Mahmudur told reporters today it was a private party where guests included government and non-government officials. 

 There was nothing wrong in that, he said, accusing the media of breaching my privacy.

 The television reports said those present included known loyalists of BNP leader Begum Khaleda Zia, whose five-year term as prime minister expired in October. She is a key contender in the coming election.

 Abdul Jalil, general secretary of the Awami League led by Sheikh Hasina, another former prime minister, told reporters late on Saturday the meeting had been convened to work out a formula to rig the coming vote to bring Khaleda back to power.

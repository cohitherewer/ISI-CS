 Pak bill introduced to amend Islamic laws

 Musharraf: Crucial step

Islmabad, Aug. 21 (Reuters): Pakistans 

ruling party introduced a bill today to amend controversial Islamic laws, including 

one which makes rape victims liable to prosecution for adultery unless they produce 

four male witnesses.

 The laws, which laid down punishments for such crimes as rape, theft and adultery, were introduced in 1979 by General Zia-ul-Haq and have drawn widespread criticism.

 The proposed amendments include the removal of the need for a woman rape victim to produce four male witnesses. Another stipulates that sex with a girl under age of 16, with or without her consent, will be deemed as rape.

 The Islamic laws, known as the Hudood Ordinances, set no age for sex with girls, saying only they should have reached puberty.

 Law minister Mohammad Wasi Zafar presented the bill to the lower house of parliament to loud protests with Opposition Islamist members tearing up copies of the amendments.

 President Pervez Musharraf, who promotes an ideology of enlightened moderation, has assured rights activists he would back any moves to amend or repeal the Islamic laws. But with an election due by the end of next year, critics fear the government could lose some of its resolve.

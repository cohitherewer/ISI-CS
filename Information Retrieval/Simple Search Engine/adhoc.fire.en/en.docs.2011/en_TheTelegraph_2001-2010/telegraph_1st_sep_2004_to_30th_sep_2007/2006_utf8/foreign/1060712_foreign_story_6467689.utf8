The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 UN chief from Asia

 Washington, July 11 (Reuters): President George W. Bush said the next UN secretary-general is expected to come from Asia.

 UN Security Council members will soon start the process of considering candidates to succeed Kofi Annan, whose 10-year term as leader of the world body expires at the end of the year. Annan is from Ghana.

 As I understand it, traditionally ... regions rotate, and were really looking in the Far East right now to be the secretary-general, Bush said in an interview yesterday.

 Asia, yes, he said when asked to clarify his answer, though he refused to be more specific or name names.

 Youll find that we will work closely with friends and allies to come up with the best candidate, but we wont be committing publicly, Bush added.

 Asked whether he would be against a Muslim in the post, he said: Not at all, would not be against a Muslim.

 The criterion Im for is somebody who wants to spread liberty and enhance the peace, do difficult things like confront tyranny, worry about the human condition, blow the whistle on human rights violations, he said.

 US ambassador John Bolton has said the best possible candidate should fill the post, regardless of region. To date, there are four names in the running for the job.

 Three have been officially nominated: Deputy Thai Prime Minister Surakiart Sathirathai; Sri Lankan disarmament specialist and government adviser Jayantha Dhanapala; and Indian novelist Shashi Tharoor, the undersecretary-general for the UN Department of Public Information. Seoul has also announced that South Koreas foreign minister, Ban Ki-moon, would run for the post though his name has not been formally submitted.

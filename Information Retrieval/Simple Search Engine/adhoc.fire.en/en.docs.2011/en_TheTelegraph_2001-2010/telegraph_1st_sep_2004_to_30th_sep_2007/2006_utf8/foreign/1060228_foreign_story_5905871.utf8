 Bling gang jailed for drug trade

 London, Feb. 27 (Reuters): Fourteen members of an international cocaine smuggling conspiracy, dubbed by newspapers the Bling Bling Gang for their love of flash jewellery, were jailed for a total of 178 years today by a British judge.

 A complex investigation by London police alongside the French National Drugs Squad and the Drug Enforcement Agency in the US finally broke the gang which had been shipping millions of pounds worth of drugs each week.

 In all, over 50 members of the conspiracy have been convicted by courts around the world including 25 in France and 10 in the US.

 The gang used mainly women couriers, often single mothers or drug addicts, to act as carrier mules. 

 Cocaine paste and liquid cocaine was smuggled from the Caribbean into the US and Europe.

 The British-based members of the gang were thought to have imported nearly ?50 million of cocaine over two years using specially constructed suitcases.

 The main conspirators in Britain were Clyde Cruel Benjamin 30, Bernard Kofi Clarke 31, Ian Dundas-Jones 35, and Lisa Bennett, 39.

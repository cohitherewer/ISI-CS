 Pope warns of culture clash if God is ignored

 Grave risk

 Vatican City, Dec. 22 (Reuters): Pope Benedict warned in a year-end speech today of an impending clash of cultures and religions if humanity continued to shut God out of its life.

 In his speech to cardinals, the Pope also said Christians should encourage Muslims who are opposed to violence. He reaffirmed the Catholic Churchs rule of priestly celibacy and its condemnation of same-sex marriage.

 Benedict said 2006, his first full year as pontiff, would be remembered for the horrors of war near the Holy Land and in general the risk of a clash between cultures and religions a risk he said was still hovering dangerously over the world.

 A secularised society that based its decisions too much on reason and logic and left no room for faith is not capable of entering into a true dialogue with religions, he said.

 If it remains closed to questions relating to God, this will end up leading to a clash of cultures.

 He said he was happy that his controversial trip to predominantly Muslim Turkey last month had allowed him to publicly show my respect for the Islamic religion. 

 We Christians feel united with all those who precisely because of their religious convictions as Muslims are committed against violence and work for a synergy between faith and reason, between religion and freedom, he said.

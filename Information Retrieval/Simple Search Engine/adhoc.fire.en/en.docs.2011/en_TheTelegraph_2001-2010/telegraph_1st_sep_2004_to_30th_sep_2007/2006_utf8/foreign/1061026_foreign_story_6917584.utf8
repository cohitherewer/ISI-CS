 Russia missile test fails

 Moscow, Oct. 25 (AP): An experimental Russian ballistic missile veered off its course shortly after having been launched from a Russian nuclear submarine and fell into the sea today, officials said.

 It was the second launch failure for the Bulava missile in two months, signalling serious problems with the nations much-lauded new weapon.

 The Bulava missile was launched from the Dmitry Donskoy nuclear submarine in the White Sea toward a testing range on the eastern Kamchatka Peninsula, but it veered off its designated flight path and fell into the sea, the navy said. The previous Bulava launch on September 7 also ended in failure, prompting quick action to prevent the mishap from damaging plans for commissioning new Borei-class submarines.

 Moment of truth, says US, Iran seals lips

 Tehran, June 2 (Reuters): Irans President today insisted on his countrys right to nuclear technology despite facing what Washington called a moment of truth over a programme that could produce atomic weapons.

 President Mahmoud Ahmadinejads comments suggested Tehran may have already decided to reject offers of incentives and negotiations from six of the worlds top powers in return for ending atomic fuel activities.

 Pressure of some western countries to force Iran to abandon its right (to nuclear technology) will not get a result, IRNA quoted him as saying.

 Although Ahmadinejad did not mention uranium enrichment, Mohammad Saeedi, deputy head of Irans Atomic Energy Organisation, said Irans plans included such sensitive work. Iran is determined to go ahead with its nuclear enrichment work for peaceful purposes, he said.

 But US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice still held out the possibility she would meet Iranian officials in what wou-ld be the highest-level such face-to-face contact since the 1979 Islamic revolution. The US cut ties with Iran in 1980.

 It depends of course on what Iran does, she told National Public Radio. Washington says Iran must stop atomic fuel work before any talks. If Iran is prepared to verifiably suspend its programme and enter into negotiations, then well determine the level (of representation) but I wouldnt be at all surprised if the ministers meet at some point. 

 Iran was facing a moment of truth, she told CBS.

 Director of National Intelligence John Negroponte said Iran could have an atomic bomb as early as 2010 and accused Tehran of being the top state sponsor of terrorism.

 The White House said Ahmadinejad was just staking out negotiating positions and expected Iran to take a careful look at a basket of incentives, approved by the US, British, French, German Russian and Chinese foreign ministers at a Vienna meeting yesterday, before officially responding.

 European officials will give Iranian officials a detailed presentation of the incentives in the next couple of days and a formal answer was hoped for within weeks, White House spokesman Tony Snow said.

 Decision-making in Iran can be drawn out by a complex political structure with ultimate power resting in the hands of supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

 Iran, the worlds No. 4 oil producer, says it wants to enrich uranium only to the level required for atomic reactors to generate electricity and has no interest in making highly-enriched uranium, a key ingredient in nuclear warheads.

 Russia and China, who do not believe Iran poses an imminent threat to peace as western leaders believe, have opposed threatening Iran with sanctions if it defies such demands. Russian President Vladimir Putin said it was too early to speak about sanctions against Iran.

 We need to have a deep conversation 

 with the Iranian leadership. Only after that can we talk 

 about the next step.

 Flight feud over perfume

 Miami, Sept. 29 (AP): Federal agents questioned two airline passengers after a dispute that began when one of them sprayed the person sitting next to him with perfume. 

 The two men were aboard an American Airlines flight from Lima, Peru, to Miami. 

 Before the flight, the older man left his assigned seat and laid down in the aisle. He also asked for a glass of water and poured it on his head. 

 The 56-year-old Japanese then sat beside a jockey in his 20s. About two hours later, he sprayed him with perfume, an FBI spokesman said. 

 When the younger man took out an iPod, the older man started elbowing him. The youth then alerted the crew.

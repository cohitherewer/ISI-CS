 Bending rules for baby smile

 GEORGE JONES

 London, Jan. 12: The rules for young childrens passport photographs have been relaxed, so that babies under a year old do not need to have their eyes open ? and may even be pictured smiling.

 Thousands of applications have been rejected in recent months because the attached photographs did not meet the strict rules laid down by the UK Passport Office. 

 All children, from newborns to the age of 15, must have individual passports these days. But many parents have fallen foul of the rules that required the photograph to show the child looking straight ahead with a neutral expression, its mouth closed and eyes open. Between September 12 and November 26 last year 15,441 child passport applications were rejected, according to figures given in the Commons in response to questions tabled by John Hemming, the Liberal Democrat MP for Birmingham, Yardley. He has been campaigning against what he describes as the bureaucratic nightmare of the Passport Service rules.

 One parent had a photo rejected because her daughters mouth was open, another because the babys head was too small relative to the size of the pictures frame, and yet another was told that her babys face was too shiny and was advised to put make-up on the 11-week-old. Andy Burnham, a home office minister, told Hemming that on November 21 the UK Passport Service had simplified its standards.

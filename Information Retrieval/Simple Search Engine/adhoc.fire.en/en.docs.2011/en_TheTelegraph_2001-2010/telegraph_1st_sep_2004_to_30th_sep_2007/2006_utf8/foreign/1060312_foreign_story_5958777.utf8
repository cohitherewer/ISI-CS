 Rachel glad to model for British Burberry

 Weisz: Thrilled

 New York, March 11 (AP): The public has seen a lot of mama-to-be Rachel Weisz lately ? first at the Golden Globes in a gold Donna Karan gown and then at the Oscars in a sleek black Narciso Rodriguez gown.

 Now Weisz, who is seven months pregnant, is the face of Burberrys ad campaign for the new fragrance London. The ads were shot last autumn. The 35-year-old actress, who won an Oscar for her role in The Constant Gardener, is a fashion-industry favourite.

 I love beautiful things and beautiful fashion, Weisz said in a recent telephone interview. I like clothes that are beautifully cut that arent too fussy.

 She often attends Rodriguezs show during New York Fashion Week, but it was Burberry, which shares Weiszs British heritage, that approached her about modelling.

 Im British. I grew up with Burberry being the ultimate brand in chic, elegance and history. My granny, the chicest lady I ever knew, had a Burberry raincoat. Now its a cool and edgy fashion house, too, Weisz said. 

 I was thrilled to be asked (to model). There was no hesitation.

 The fragrance is light and floral with a rich undertone. Weisz said shes particularly fond of perfumes with a sandalwood base.

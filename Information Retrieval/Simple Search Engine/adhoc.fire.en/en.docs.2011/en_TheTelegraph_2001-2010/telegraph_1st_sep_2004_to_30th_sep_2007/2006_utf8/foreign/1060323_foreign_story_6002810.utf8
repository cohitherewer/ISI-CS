 Pak tailor and Iran nuke trail

 ANTON LA GUARDIA

 London, March 22: Nuclear inspectors have established a link between Iranian nuclear documents and the blueprint for a warhead bought by Libya on the black market. 

 The discovery increases suspicions that Tehran is trying to build atomic weapons under the cloak of its civil nuclear programme. As Iran faces the threat of UN sanctions, questions are growing about whether it has made the jump from enriching uranium to designing an actual weapon. 

 The new evidence on weaponisation has built up from several sources. They include the latest US intelligence, a surprising error by Iranian officials and the discovery in Libya of an atomic bomb manual stuffed in two plastic bags incongruously marked Good Looks Tailor.

 A key piece of evidence is a 15-page document setting out how to make enriched uranium hemispheres ? the core of an atomic bomb ? found by the International Atomic Energy Agency last October among hundreds of papers handed over by Iran. Several diplomatic sources said the paper was only a general outline but was similar to the full blueprint for a Chinese-designed bomb sold to Libya by the disgraced Pakistani nuclear scientist, Abdul Qadeer Khan. 

 Libya surrendered the weapons design to officials from America, Britain and the IAEA in January 2004, as part of its agreement to give up its weapons of mass destruction in return for rehabilitation in the West. The Libyans gave us two plastic bags marked with Good Looks and the address and the name of a tailor in Pakistan. Inside them were the designs for nuclear weapons, recalled one participant. 

 Good Looks Fabrics and Tailors in Islamabad caters to members of Pakistani high society, including A.Q. Khan. At first, the owner, Salahuddin Khan, said he was in shock at the discovery. But yesterday he said he had benefited from the attention.

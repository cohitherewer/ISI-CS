 Key Saddam lawyer killed

 Obaidi: Vicious

 Baghdad, June 21 (Reuters): One of Saddam Husseins main lawyers was shot dead today after men in police uniforms took him from his home, police and relatives said, the third defence attorney to be killed since the trial opened in October.

 The killing of Khamis al-Obaidi was a new setback for the US-backed court. It fuelled complaints that sectarian violence, some by Shia militias within the police against Saddams once dominant Sunni minority, is crippling a fair trial.

 The lead defence lawyer called for the case to be suspended and the defendants taken abroad after the death of his deputy.

 Obaidis wife told another defence lawyer that men in police uniform took Obaidi from his Baghdad home around 7 am.

 They said: Were from internal security and we need you for questioning, Qatari attorney Najeeb al-Nuaimi told Al Jazeera television. Two hours later, Obaidis body was dumped on a road beside a poster honouring a Shia cleric killed under Saddam.

 The attack appeared very similar to the killing of another lawyer the day after the televised trial began in October.

 A police officer who identified himself as Captain Sabah said Obaidi had been shot eight times and there were signs of torture ? both his arms were broken.

 Chief prosecutor Jaafar al-Moussawi said the killing would not affect or delay the trial and we will defy terrorism. It came two days after Moussawi demanded a death penalty for Saddam and three of his former senior aides.

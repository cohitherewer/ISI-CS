 Toned-down Aguilera

 Aguilera: Back to basics

 New York, July 25: Christina 

 Aguilera says she has toned down the sexuality on her new 

 double-disc album, Back to Basics, but has no regrets 

 about the sultry image shes projected in the past.

 The sexuality coming forward on this record is more softened, she says in the July 24 issue of Newsweek. 

 Aguilera said she was proud of the image she projected on her last album, Stripped, in part because it elicited strong opinions. If you liked it, you wanted to root for me: Look, shes empowered. If not, well, youd stick all those labels on me.

 Aguilera also told the magazine there was never a feud between her and Britney Spears. We were like best friends, but the media had to create some drama, she said.

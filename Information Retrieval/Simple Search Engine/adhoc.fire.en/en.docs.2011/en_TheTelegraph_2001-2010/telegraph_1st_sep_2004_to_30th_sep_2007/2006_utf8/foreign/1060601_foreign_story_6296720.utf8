 King faces more curbs

 Kathmandu, May 31 (Reuters): Nepals parliament is expected to consider stripping the king of his remaining parliamentary roles, a lawmaker said today, after voting to withdraw most of his powers earlier this month.

 King Gyanendra reinstated parliament in April after weeks of protests against his absolute rule, and political parties soon approved sweeping curbs ending the monarchs control of the army, and making him open to questioning in parliament and the courts.

 But any bill passed by parliament still needs the kings signature to become law. He also opens and closes sessions, and reads out the governments annual policy programme.

 All this will end now, said Narayan Man Bijukchhe, a deputy of the Nepal Workers and Peasants Party that is part of a seven-party alliance behind the pro-democracy protests.

 Bijukchhe, who heads a panel finalising the proposed changes, said the king would have no role in parliament under the plan.

 The Prime Minister will call the session, present the governments programmes and the speaker will end the parliament session, he said.

 Under the proposals, expected to be presented to lawmakers soon, bills will not need the kings signature to become law.

 King Gyanendra threw the Himalayan nation into turmoil in 2005 when he sacked the government and took absolute power saying it had failed to crush an anti-monarchy Maoist insurgency that has killed 13,000 people.

 Last week, the government and rebels held their first meeting since peace talks failed in 2003. They agreed to hold elections for an assembly to be tasked with preparing a new constitution and deciding the future of the monarchy, a key Maoist demand.

 Robbery foiled

 At least three people, including a security guard, were killed in an encounter in eastern Kathmandu between a dozen armed robbers and police who foiled an attempted bank robbery. 

 Three people were killed in the cross-firing between security guards and the robbers who stormed into the branch office of Nabil Bank at Jorpati, eastern Kathmandu, Radio Nepal said.

 A group of 12-14 armed robbers entered the bank by shooting at the security guards but police launched a counter attack against the gunmen in which two of the bank guards and driver of the bus in which the robbers entered the premises, died, police said.

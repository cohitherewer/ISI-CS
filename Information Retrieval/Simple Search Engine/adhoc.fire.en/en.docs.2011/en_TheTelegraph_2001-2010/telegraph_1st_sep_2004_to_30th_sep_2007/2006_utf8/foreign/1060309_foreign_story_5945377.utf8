 After Crash, racism in Salma film

 New York, March 8 (Reuters): Racism in Los Angeles is a hot topic after the Oscar triumph of Crash and its back on the big screen this week in Ask the Dust, a new film starring Salma Hayek, who has fought her own battles against Hollywood prejudice.

 Based on the cult novel by John Fante, the film stars Colin Farrell as Arturo Bandini, an aspiring Italian-American writer in 1930s Los Angeles who reluctantly falls in love with an illiterate Mexican waitress played by Mexican-born Hayek.

 We were talking about a time when it would say: No Mexicans or animals, Hayek said, recalling a sign in the shabby hotel where Farrells character stays in the film. We had the same rights as an animal, maybe not even that, she said in New York. Director Robert Towne said he fell in love with Fantes book 30 years ago. He envisaged Al Pacino playing the lead but too much time had passed for that.

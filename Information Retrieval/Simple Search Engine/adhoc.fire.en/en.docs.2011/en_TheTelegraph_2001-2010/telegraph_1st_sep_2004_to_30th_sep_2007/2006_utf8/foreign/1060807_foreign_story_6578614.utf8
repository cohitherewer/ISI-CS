 Castro better, Cubans ponder

 Havana, Aug. 6 (Reuters): Cuban leader Fidel Castro was today recovering from surgery but Cubans questioned whether he would ever be strong enough to return to full power.

 A week after the 79-year-old Castros unprecedented provisional handover of power to his younger brother Raul, his exact whereabouts and condition remained a mystery to ordinary Cubans.

 Yesterday, Vice-President Carlos Lage said Castro would return to the presidency in several weeks and denied a Brazilian newspaper report his surgery was for stomach cancer. Fidel has had to confront an operation and is recovering favourably. He does not have cancer, Lage said in Bolivia.

 Senior Cuban officials, seeking to allay suspicions that longtime US foe Castro (in picture) had lost his grip on the island nation he has dominated since his 1959 revolution, insisted in brief statements that he was recovering from surgery for internal bleeding. But they said he may have to reduce his workload.

 Fidel is definitely out of intensive care and doing as well as can be expected for his age, though no one knows exactly where he is, what he has and if he will ever resume all his activities, a Havana party member said.

 Everyone is breathing a little easier with the news, though we all remain very concerned, a government official said.

 National Assembly President Ricardo Alarcon said Castro came through the complicated surgery so well that a few hours afterwards he was talking, he was making jokes.

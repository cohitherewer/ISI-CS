 London, Nov. 4 (Reuters): Paul McCartney says he wants to maintain a certain dignity over his divorce from Heather Mills, in his first public comments on their acrimonious split.

 Speaking at the premiere of his classical composition Ecce Cor Meum (Behold My Heart) in London late yesterday, the former Beatle told BBC radio he was not the type of person who bore grudges or blamed others for sadness in his life.

 There are certain things in life that are personal and I think a relationship with a partner is intensely personal and I prefer to keep it that way, he said in an interview broadcast today. McCartney, 64, and former model Mills, 38, announced their separation in May, blaming media intrusion for the failure of their marriage. The divorce has since turned into a public battle for sympathy fought in the media spotlight.

 I think when you are going through difficulties the thing to do, for sake of all the people concerned, is to keep a certain dignity and remember that it is a private affair, McCartney said.

 That way you will probably get through it better, you will put less noses out of joint and I think its a more dignified way to go about it. So thats what I try to do.

 McCartney said music had always helped him get through difficult times and remain optimistic about the future.

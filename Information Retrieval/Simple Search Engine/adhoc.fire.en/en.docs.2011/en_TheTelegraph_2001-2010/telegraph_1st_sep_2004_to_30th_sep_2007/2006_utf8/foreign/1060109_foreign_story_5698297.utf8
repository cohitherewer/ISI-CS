 Taliban target co-ed school 

 Kandahar, Jan. 8 (AP): Suspected Taliban gunmen destroyed a co-ed primary school in the main southern Afghan city today, first tying up two security guards before setting the buildings on fire.

 The attack on Kandahar was the latest in a spate of assaults that have forced many schools to close. The insurgents claim educating girls is against Islam and they even oppose state-funded schools for boys because they teach subjects besides religion.

 Suspected Taliban insurgents last Tuesday beheaded the headmaster of another co-ed school in the region.

 In todays attack, a group of men raided Qabail Primary School before dawn, briefly detaining its guards but not hurting them, said Hayabullah Rafiqi Othak, Kandahar provinces education director.

 The assailants then went into each classroom, making bonfires of books and wooden desks that eventually razed the whole school, he said.

 Some 700 girls and boys had studied at the school. Builders were to immediately start reconstructing it and Othak said some classes may be able to resume when vacation ends in March.

 The attack came hours after gunmen tried to set fire to another school but the guards scared them away, the education director said.

 Pakistan protest 

 Quetta, March 25 (Reuters): Up to 200 Pakistanis staged a protest in front of the Afghan consulate in southwestern Pakistan today against the killing of 16 compatriots in Afghanistan. 

 Chanting slogans against Afghan President Hamid Karzai, the protesters pelted the mission in Quetta with stones and demanded action against those involved in the killings.

a general strike, dubbed the massive mobilisation, on Tuesday.

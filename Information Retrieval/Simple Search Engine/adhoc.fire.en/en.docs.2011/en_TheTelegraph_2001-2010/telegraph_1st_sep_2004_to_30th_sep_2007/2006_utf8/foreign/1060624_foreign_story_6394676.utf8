 Banker heist

 Sydney, June 23 (Reuters): New Zealand police said today they had arrested a bank manager who had tried to rob his own bank with a gang of thieves that included his lover.

 A gang of three armed bandits charged into a bank in Auckland, New Zealands largest city, on Tuesday dressed in balaclavas and overalls.

 They held staff at gunpoint and tried to make off with NZ$65,000 ($40,000) but two of the robbers were arrested at the scene after passers-by reported the robbery to police.

 The third bandit escaped but police said questioning of the robbers in custody soon revealed that their accomplice was in fact the bank managers girlfriend.

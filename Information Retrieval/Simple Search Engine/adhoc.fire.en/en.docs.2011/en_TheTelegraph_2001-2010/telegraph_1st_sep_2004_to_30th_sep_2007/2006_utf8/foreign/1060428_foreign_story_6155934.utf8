 Iran decree on women faces flak

 Tehran, April 27 (Reuters): Iranian conservatives have called on President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to reverse his decision to let women into sports stadiums, saying it was against Islamic values, newspapers reported today.

 Ahmadinejad promised a return to the values of the 1979 Islamic revolution when he was elected last year, prompting many in the establishment to expect rigorous enforcement of Islamic dress and other social codes.

 But he has been more moderate on social issues than many expected, including saying dress codes should not be imposed by force and, this week, that women should be allowed into sports stadiums for the first time since the revolution.

 Womens presence at such places is un-Islamic... The concerns will be removed by cancelling the decree, Grand Ayatollah Lotfollah Safi Golpaygani said in a message published by the Tosea newspaper.

 His comments were echoed by at least five other senior clerics, newspapers reported. Some 120 parliamentarians also urged the president in a letter to review his decision, the Kayhan newspaper said.

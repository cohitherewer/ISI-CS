 Missile alert for Palestine PM

 Gaza, July 2 (Reuters): An Israeli helicopter fired a missile into the empty office of Palestinian Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh today in an attack that drove home threats to target the Hamas leadership unless an abducted soldier is freed.

 The air strike was part of a military offensive in the Gaza Strip that has been coupled with statements from Israeli leaders that no one in the Hamas-led government was immune from attack.

 Hamass armed wing responded by threatening to attack Israeli power plants, institutions and schools if Israel carried out further air strikes against government offices and infrastructure in the Gaza Strip.

 Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said Israel would pursue anyone who harmed its citizens. No one will go unpunished, he said in broadcast remarks, without mentioning Haniyeh.

 Haniyeh was not in the office at the time of the strike, witnesses said. He arrived to survey the damage to find shattered furniture and windows and a portrait of late President Yasser Arafat blown off the wall.

 This is the policy of the jungle and arrogance, Haniyeh said. Nothing will affect our spirit and nothing will affect our steadfastness.

 Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, whose Fatah faction was defeated by Hamas in a January election, also toured Haniyehs wrecked office. The world must understand that this is a true criminal act, he said.

 One Hamas member was killed in a second attack on an office used by forces loyal to the Islamic militant group, whose charter calls for Israels destruction. A third strike hit a Hamas school, but there were no casualties. The Israeli army said a nearby building used by Hamas was the target.

 Israel, which pulled out of the Gaza Strip last year, sent troops and tanks into the south of the territory on Wednesday after Palestinian gunmen, some from the armed wing of Hamas, seized Corporal Gilad Shalit in a cross-border raid a week ago.

 Nabil Abu Rdainah, an adviser to Abbas, said diplomatic efforts spearheaded by Egypt to free the soldier were continuing but they have produced no results so far and we are near deadlock.

 A Palestinian official quoted mediators as saying 19-year-old Shalit was alive after being treated for wounds.

 Setting the stage for tougher military action, Olmert ordered the armed forces to make sure no one sleeps at night in Gaza, Israeli interior minister Roni Bar-On told Israel Radio.

 A UN official said widening an Israeli offensive to the northern Gaza Strip, where militants have been launching rockets at Israel, could displace up to 25,000 Palestinians.

 With a Palestinian humanitarian crisis looming and under international pressure, Israel reopened Karni, the main commercial crossing into the Gaza Strip. Israel, which had said Gazas borders would be sealed indefinitely after Shalit was abducted, opened fuel pipelines.

 Smoking ban only solution

 Washington, June 27 (Reuters): Second-hand smoke clearly kills people and the only way to control it is to ban all smoking in workplaces, US surgeon-general Dr Richard Carmona said today.

 In a report aimed at echoing the landmark 1964 surgeon generals report that first laid out the dangers of smoking, Carmona detailed the effects of second-hand smoke and said no one should be forced to inhale it.

 Second-hand smoke causes premature death and disease in children and in adults who do not smoke, the report reads.

 Children exposed to second-hand smoke are at an increased risk for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), acute respiratory infections, ear problems and more severe asthma, it adds.

 Smoking by parents causes respiratory symptoms and slows lung growth in their children. Exposure of adults to second-hand smoke has immediate adverse effects on the cardiovascular system and causes coronary heart disease and lung cancer.

 A 2005 report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found 3,000 people died every year in the US from lung cancer, 46,000 died from heart disease and 430 newborns from sudden infant death syndrome ? all caused by second-hand smoke or passive smoking.

 The report said it is impossible to protect non-smokers even with designated smoking areas, and at least one report from California, which has strict bans, has shown no impact on businesses.

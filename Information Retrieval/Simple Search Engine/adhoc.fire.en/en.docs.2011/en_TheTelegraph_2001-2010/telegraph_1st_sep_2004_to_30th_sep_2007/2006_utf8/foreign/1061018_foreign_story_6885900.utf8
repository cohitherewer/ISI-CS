 Rome, Oct. 17 (Reuters): A train on Romes underground metro system rammed into the back of another at high speed today, killing at least one person and injuring 110 others, five seriously, authorities said.

 Earlier, officials had said two people had been killed. The difference was apparently due to confusion at the scene.

 Officials at the scene, the Piazza Vittorio metro station just south of the main overground rail terminal in the city centre, said there was no indication the accident was related to terrorism.

 The accident happened when one train arriving at the station crashed into the back of another that was still discharging passengers.

 Prime Minister Romano Prodi said officials were still looking into whether it was a human mistake or if something went wrong with the signalling.

 The trains were brand new and there is no visible technical fault at the moment. Now lets give our condolences to the casualties and lets stay close to the ones who are in hospital, he said.

 Rome mayor Walter Veltroni said: When I first heard of it, I was afraid it could be something else, an apparent reference to fears of a terror attack. 

 The injured, many of them spattered with blood, were taken to six hospitals in or near the city centre causing traffic chaos.

 I was on the train that hit the other train. The other was really close. I was right near the front of the train. This is my favourite seat. I saw everything, said Fabiano DeSantis, a lawyer. 

 I clearly saw a red light then luckily I managed to anticipate the situation because I saw the train before us, he said.

 A witness said overhead beams of the station collapsed and the lights went out. People on our train were saying: This is a terrorist attack but later it became clear to all of us that it was an accident, one woman said.

 About one quarter of the first carriage of the train I was on was totally crushed, another passenger said. The entire system of Rome metros Line A was shut down and ground traffic was backed up throughout the city as ambulances took the injured to hospitals.

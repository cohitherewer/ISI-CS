 Buenos Aires, Nov. 22 

 (AP): US and Argentine media reported that one 

 of President George W. Bushs 24-year-old twin daughters 

 had her purse stolen while being guarded by the Secret Service 

 during a visit here.

 ABC News, citing unidentified reports, reported on its website yesterday that Barbara Bushs purse and cellphone were taken while she was dining in a Buenos Aires restaurant.

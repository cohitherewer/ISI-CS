 US hurricane

 St Petersburg (Florida), June 12 (Reuters): US forecasters warned today that Tropical Storm Alberto could become the first hurricane of 2006 as it strengthened ominously over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico and barrelled toward northwest Florida.

 The storm was about 190 miles south-southwest of Apalachicola, in Floridas panhandle, at 1500 GMT, according to the US National Hurricane Center (http://www.nhc.noaa.gov).

 Preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion, the US forecasters in Miami said.

 Alberto has the potential to become a hurricane within the next 24 hours, the forecasters added, fuelling a sense of foreboding in a state hit by eight hurricanes in the last two years, including Katrina, which went on to devastate New Orleans.

 This is a serious storm and we are taking it seriously, Florida governor. Jeb Bush said in Tallahassee as the state government declared a state of emergency and activated its emergency response system.

 Albertos maximum sustained winds had increased to near 110 km per hour.

 Future fantasy

 San Francisco, April 18 (Reuters): When Americas top sex researchers gathered recently to discuss the next decade in their field, some envisioned a future in which artificial sex partners could cater to every fantasy.

 What is very likely to be present before 2016 would be a multi-sensual experience of virtual sex, said Julia Heiman, director of the Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender and Reproduction at Indiana University, Bloomington.

 A field dubbed teledildonics already allows people at two remote computers to manipulate electronic devices such as a vibrator at the other end for sexual purposes. People who use it are just blown away, said Steve Rhodes, president of Sinulate Entertainment.

 Mystic duo

 Moscow (Reuters): Russian police are looking for two mystics 

who persuaded a student to part with more than $160,000 in exchange for lifting 

a curse, RIA news agency said. Two unknown women, on the pretext of lifting 

a curse, stole $150,000 and some jewellery by means of deception. The total amount 

stolen is estimated at 4.48 million roubles ($161,800), the agency said. 

The victim is a female student at Moscows elite State Institute for International 

Affairs, RIA said.

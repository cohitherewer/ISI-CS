 Vietnam tiger ready to roar

 Ho Chi Minh City, May 29: The last tiger may finally be ready to roar.

 In the twenty years since Vietnam began its policy of Doi Noi, or reform and opening up, the country has mostly missed its opportunity of becoming southeast Asias newest miracle economy. 

 But Hanois signing of a free-trade pact with the US in 2001 and its current negotiations to join the WTO, coupled with rising costs in China, have joined to reignite global investors interest in this industrious nation of 82 million. 

 Vietnam is where the action is now ? its like a gold rush, said Than Trong Phue, Intels country manager in Ho Chi Minh City. Youll be foolish if you miss out.

 Until recently, this was the mantra chanted about China. But as capital has poured into Asias fastest-growing economy its labour costs have risen between 25 and 40 per cent, dulling Chinas well-earned sobriquet of being the worlds factory. Today, it costs about $125 a month to hire a factory worker in southern China. 

 But in bustling Ho Chi Minh the minimum monthly wage for factory workers is $65 ? and thats after a 40 per cent increase in the government- mandated minimum wage in February. 

 Phue said thats partly why Intel passed up the opportunity to expand the two factories it has in Chengdu and Pudong in China, and set up a $600 million greenfield chipset plant just east of Ho Chi Minh City. 

 Yes, Vietnam has been slower than China (in opening up), but its been a bit more prudent, said Kham Tom Doan, a Vietkieu, or Vietnamese American, who quit his job with Bank of America to return here and start a financial management firm called Horizon Capital Advisors. 

 On the whole things here have gone better. The dong (as the local currency is called) isnt fluctuating much, infrastructure is improving all the time ? in fact theyve building a new port at Cai Memp just outside Saigon ? and theres stability in the system.

 Evidence of this was seen in how warmly global investors embraced Vietnams first sovereign bond offering last October. 

 Hanoi, which has plans to spend an estimated $115 billion on infrastructure over the next five years, asked investors for $500 million. It was offered $4.5 billion, and finally decided to keep $750 million, leading Moodys to raise Vietnams bond rating from B1 to Ba3. 

Emboldening many investors is a recent Merrill Lynch 

report that said Vietnam will be the fastest-growing Asian country in the 

next ten years? more exciting than anywhere else in Asean.

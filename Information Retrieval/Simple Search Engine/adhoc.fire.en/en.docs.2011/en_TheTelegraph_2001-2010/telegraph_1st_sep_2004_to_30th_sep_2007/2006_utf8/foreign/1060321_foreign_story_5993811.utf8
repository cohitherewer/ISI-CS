 Belarus President victory leads to protests

 Lukashenko: Defiant

 Minsk, March 20 (Reuters): Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko swept back into office today in an election that independent observers condemned as flawed and which triggered a second day of protests from Opposition supporters.

 Several thousand people, defying warnings by Lukashenkos state security forces, massed in a central square after an appeal by Opposition rival Alexander Milinkevich, who called for a re-run of the vote.

 Lukashenko, in power since 1994 and a bogeyman for the West because of his Soviet-style policies at home, defended his re-election ? officially by a tally of 82.6 per cent of the vote ? as honest and democratic.

 He said that a pro-western revolution, like those that swept away entrenched establishments in ex-Soviet Ukraine and Georgia, had been stopped in its tracks.

 But the outcome, never in doubt given the control Lukashenko exerts over the media and all aspects of political life, put Washington and Moscow at variance.

 Russian President Vladimir Putin quickly congratulated Lukashenko. The results of the election testify to the fact that the voters trust in your course..., the Kremlin quoted Putins message of congratulation as saying.

 Within minutes, the US denounced the victory and said the election had been conducted in a climate of fear.

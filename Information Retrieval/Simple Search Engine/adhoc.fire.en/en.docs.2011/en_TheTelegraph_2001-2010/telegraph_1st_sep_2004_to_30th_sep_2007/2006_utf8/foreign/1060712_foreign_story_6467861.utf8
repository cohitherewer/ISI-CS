 Pink Floyds Barrett dead

 Barrett: Recluse retires

 London, July 11 (Reuters): Syd Barrett, the troubled founding member of British rock group Pink Floyd, has died aged 60, after living the life of a recluse for the last 30 years.

 The band are naturally very upset and sad to learn of Syd Barretts death, Pink Floyd said today. Syd was the guiding light of the early band line-up and leaves a legacy which continues to inspire.

 A source close to the band, who did not want to be named, said Barrett died on Friday. Media reports say complications from diabetes were the cause.

 Barretts bizarre on-stage antics in the late 1960s were linked to his experimentation with psychedelic drugs, and he left the band in 1968.

 The singer, songwriter and guitarist, who wrote the bulk of Pink Floyds earliest music, has been credited with helping shape its progressive sound and influencing artists including David Bowie.

 He wrote most of the songs on Pink Floyds first album The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, which was a hit in Britain, and also worked on A Saucerful of Secrets, released in 1968. He issued his first solo album, The Madcap Laughs, in 1970, with backing from members of Pink Floyd and Soft Machine.

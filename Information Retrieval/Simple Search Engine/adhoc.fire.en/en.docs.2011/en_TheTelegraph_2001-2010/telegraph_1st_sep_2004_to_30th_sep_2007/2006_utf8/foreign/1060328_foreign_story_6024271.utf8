 Washington, March 27 (Reuters): Afghanistan will free a man who faced the death penalty for converting to Christianity after the West pressed the government for his release, a US state department spokesman said today.

 Abdur Rahman, 40, was jailed this month for rejecting Islam and converting to Christianity in a case that raised a storm of international protest and threatened to create a rift between Afghanistan and the US and other western backers.

 In Afghanistan, many clerics and other conservatives have called for Rahman to be tried under Islamic law, meaning he could be executed for abandoning the faith.

 Street protests against him possibly being freed also raised fears for his safety, if he were to stay in the country after any release.

 He will be released, state department spokesman Sean McCormack said. I understand now that the details of his release and any potential onward travel are being handled as a private matter.

 Rahman become a Christian while working for an aid group helping Afghan refugees in Pakistan 15 years ago. He later lived in Germany before returning to Afghanistan.

 He was detained after his relatives told authorities he had converted to Christianity, apparently following a dispute involving two daughters. President George W. Bush has urged Afghanistan to show it respects religious freedom and resolve the case quickly.

 Molly conversion row

 Lahore, Sept. 3 (Reuters): A 12-year-old Scottish girl at the centre of a tug-of-love between her parents said in Pakistan today that her British mother had tried to convert her from Islam against her will.

 She wants to bring me up as a Christian. I do not want to be a Christian. I love Scotland, but I love Islam more, said Molly Campbell, reading from a statement during a news conference in Lahore.

 I love my religion. I love my father. I did not see my sister and brothers while living with my mum, so I came here to Pakistan, the girl said.

 A day earlier, a Pakistani court awarded temporary custody of Molly Campbell to her father, Sajad Ahmed Rana, after she told a judge that she wanted to live in the Muslim country.

 The court also invited the mother to a second hearing scheduled for Wednesday.

 British police launched an investigation after Campbell left her mother her legal guardian in the Western Isles of Scotland to travel to Lahore with her father and elder sister.

 Campbells mother, Louise, has made an emotional plea for her daughter to return home, while her grandmother was quoted in British newspapers as saying she thought the girl could be forced into an arranged marriage.

 But the girl, who is also known as Misbah Iram Rana, rejected the impression. My father has never asked me to marry anyone. Indeed, he has told me in so many words that Im absolutely free to marry anyone of my own choice when the time comes.

 Lanka stops strikes, reopens borders

 Colombo, April 27 (Reuters): Sri Lanka stopped bombing Tamil Tiger targets and reopened borders with rebel territory today but fragmentation mine blasts killed five, police said, as the island teetered on the brink of war.

 Both sides vowed to retaliate if attacked again after heavy firing on Tuesday night and yesterday caused thousands to flee their homes and raised fears a 2002 ceasefire would collapse.

 If violence stops, diplomats say peace talks might still be possible. But if it resumes, they fear a return to a two-decade-old civil war that has killed more than 64,000.

 Police in the army-held Jaffna enclave in the north said a suspected Tiger claymore mine blast killed two sailors.

 A second attack near the northwest coast killed three soldiers and wounded two, they said, while two policemen were hurt in a blast in the same area earlier in the day.

 Speaking on condition of anonymity, one senior government official said the bombing was halted for humanitarian reasons and the raids could restart, but army spokesman Brigadier Prasad Samarasinghe said claymore blasts would not provoke air attacks.

 It was suspected LTTE. But for a claymore mine blast we dont respond with air strikes, Samarasinghe said after the first blast.

 The strikes on LTTE territory in the northeast followed a suspected Tiger suicide bomb attack on Colombos army headquarters which killed 10 and wounded the army commander.

 Ambassadors from Sri Lankas main donors met President Mahinda Rajapakse today. Diplomats said that while they understood the government was provoked, they wanted restraint.

 Even if they have stopped, the door is still open for many dangerous moments ahead, said a western diplomat. Norway, Japan, the EU and the US will meet in Oslo on Friday to discuss the situation.

 In a statement on their official website, the Tigers called the government attacks attempted genocide.

 Another pro-rebel website, www.tamilnet.com, quoted Tiger northeastern political chief S. Elilan as saying the rebels awaited instructions from their leadership, but any retaliation would be catastrophically disabling and devastating.

 Truce monitors said they had been told 19 people had died in the raids.

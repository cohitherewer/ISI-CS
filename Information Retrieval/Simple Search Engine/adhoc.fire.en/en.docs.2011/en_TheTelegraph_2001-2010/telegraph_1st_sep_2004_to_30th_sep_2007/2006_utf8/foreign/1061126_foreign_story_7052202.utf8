 US varsity to teach Hindi, Urdu

 Austin, Nov. 25 (AP): University of Texas (UT) officials are recruiting students to study Hindi and Urdu as part of a new defence department programme to teach languages vital to global security, according to a media report.

 The National Security Education Programme awarded UTs South Asia Institute more than $700,000 to open the National Flagship Language Programme for Hindi and Urdu. It is part of the National Security Language Initiative announced this year by the White House to prepare more students for the global economy, Robert Slater, director of the programme, said.

 Students will study in India during their third year in the programme. By the time undergraduates in the programme earn a degree, they should be able to chat with near fluency in either Hindi or Urdu.

 Italy Jesus twist

 MICHAEL HIRST

 London, Feb. 13: Silvio Berlusconi talked himself into another controversy at the weekend by comparing himself to Jesus Christ.

 The Italian Prime Ministers comments, made at the start of official campaigning for Aprils general election, prompted the scorn of his political opponents and the wrath of the Catholic Church. I am the Jesus Christ of politics, Berlusconi told supporters at a party rally on Saturday. I am a patient victim, I put up with everyone, I sacrifice myself for everyone.

 Marco Rizzo, a communist parliamentarian, called it a grotesque comparison. Silvio Berlusconi has as usual with his usual limited sense compared himself to Jesus Christ, said Giuseppe Giulietti, an Opposition Left MP. 

 According to information that I have, God the Father and the rest of Jesuss family did not take this very well.

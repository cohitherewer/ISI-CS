 Suu Kyi at home 

 Bangkok, June 10 (Reuters): Myanmars opposition leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, was recovering at her home today from an illness thought to be a bowel disorder.

 Police general Khin Yi told reporters in Yangon Suu Kyi, whose latest detention began in May 2003, had been ill but she was not hospitalised. He did not give further details. 

 A National League for Democracy spokesman had said the party leader was hospitalised yesterday and returned home after she improved.

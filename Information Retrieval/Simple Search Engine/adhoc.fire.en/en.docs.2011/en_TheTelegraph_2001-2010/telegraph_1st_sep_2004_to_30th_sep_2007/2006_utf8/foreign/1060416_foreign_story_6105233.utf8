 Model to Rowling: Dont call us dumb 

 - How 

can you be so bitter? 

 fashion sense: J.K. Rowling

 Modelling may not be brain surgery, as J. K. Rowling pointed out last week when she pilloried empty-headed toothpicks, but it seems that brain surgeons can be models.

 Megan McGill, a well-travelled American fashion model with a degree in neuroscience, yesterday defended her trade against the authors scathing criticism.

 She said she was appalled by the confrontational nature of Rowlings comments, adding: You are the most loved woman by every child in the world, how can you be so bitter?

 McGill, who is based in London but will move to New York in the autumn to study neurology at medical school, added: Models do actually read newspapers, and they dont like being called dumb.

 Maybe most models dont have degrees, but the majority are multi-lingual, and I dont know anyone I would describe as vapid or emaciated.

 Rowling, the creator of Harry Potter, who is working on her seventh book, said photographs of an ultra-thin woman in a glossy magazine had prompted her rant.

 Writing on her website, she said that she did not want her daughters, Jessica, 12, and Mackenzie, one, to emulate women whose only function was to support the trade in over-priced handbags and rat-sized dogs. She described waif-like models as empty-headed, self-obsessed, emaciated clones, and railed against a world that was skinny obsessed.

 McGill read the authors comments in The Daily Telegraph and discussed them with other models during a tour of Britain and Ireland with a catwalk show for LOreal.

 The general comment was bollocks, she said. Im six feet tall, thin, blonde-haired and blue eyed. But I also hold a degree in neuroscience with minors in chemistry and music from an Ivy League college (the University of Pennsylvania) from where I graduated magna cum laude in three years instead of four.

 And no, my greatest achievement is not un-chipped nail polish. This autumn I will start medical school in New York where I plan to study neurology to hopefully become a neuro-surgeon. I dont know anyone whose only function in the world appears to be supporting the trade in overpriced handbags. In fact, Im quite sure Rowling has more handbags than I do.

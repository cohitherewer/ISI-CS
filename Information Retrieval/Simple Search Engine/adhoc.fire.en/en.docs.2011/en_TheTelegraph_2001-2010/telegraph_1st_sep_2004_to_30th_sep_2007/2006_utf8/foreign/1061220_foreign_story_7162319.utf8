 Laura treated for skin cancer on leg

 Early detection

 Washington, Dec. 19 (Reuters): First Lady Laura Bush was treated for the second most common type of skin cancer on her leg last month, her spokeswoman said today.

 Laura Bush did not appear to have difficulty walking at a Hanukkah reception at the White House yesterday but a bandage was visible below her right knee. 

 She had a biopsy of a small sore on her leg in late October, revealing a squamous cell carcinoma, the second most common type of skin cancer, Susan Whitson, spokeswoman for the First Lady, said.

 Laura Bush had the small growth removed from the shin area of her right leg shortly after Election Day, which was November 7, and before she and President George W. Bush went to Asia later that month, Whitson said. 

 Because of Laura Bushs early detection and treatment, the area on her leg is healing well and it has not interrupted her schedule, she said. There are more than 200,000 new cases of squamous cell carcinoma, called SCC, per year estimated in the US, according to the Skin Cancer Foundation website.

 Most SCCs are not serious. When identified early and treated promptly, the future is bright. However, if overlooked, they are harder to treat, the foundation said. Chronic overexposure to the sun is the main cause of nearly all cases of this type of skin cancer.

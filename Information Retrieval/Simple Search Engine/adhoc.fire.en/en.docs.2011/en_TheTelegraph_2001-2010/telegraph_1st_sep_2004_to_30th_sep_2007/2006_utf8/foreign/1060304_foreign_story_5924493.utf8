 Rocker jailed for girl abuse

 Vung Tau (Vietnam), March 3 (Reuters): A Vietnamese court sentenced British glam rocker Gary Glitter to three years in jail today for molesting two 11-year-old girls, although if he wins early parole he could be free by Christmas.

 Im innocent, the 61-year-old shaven-headed Glitter, who now sports a white goatee beard, shouted after the verdict was pronounced following a one-day, closed-door trial.

 But Judge Hoang Thanh Tung described in graphic detail the offences committed by the 1970s pop icon in the southern resort town of Vung Tau, drawing gasps from ordinary Vietnamese packed into the courtroom.

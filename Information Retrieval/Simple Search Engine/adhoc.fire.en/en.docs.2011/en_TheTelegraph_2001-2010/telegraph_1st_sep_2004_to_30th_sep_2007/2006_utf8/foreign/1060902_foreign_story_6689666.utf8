 Gere hunts for Bosnia fugitive

 Gere: Thrilling

 Sarajevo, Sept. 1 (Reuters): Hollywood actor Richard Gere will start searching for war crimes fugitive Radovan Karadzic in a new film due to start shooting in Bosnia this month, a local production company said today.

 Richard Shepards light-hearted thriller Flak Jacket will also star US actors Jesse Eisenberg and Terrence Howard, who along with Gere play reporters heading to post-war Bosnia on an unauthorised mission to locate Karadzic. The film is based on an article written by Scott Anderson, a journalist who reported on the Bosnian war for Esquire magazine.

 Edo Sarkic of the Sarajevo-based Scout Film production company said the first 10-day shooting would be done in Bosnia and the remainder in Croatia.

 We have completed the technical scouting and selected several shooting locations in and around Sarajevo and the 160-member crew will start making the film on September 12, Sarkic said. He could not disclose who would play Karadzic.

 Bosnian Serb wartime leader Karadzic is wanted along with his military chief Ratko Mladic by the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague over the 1995 Srebrenica massacre of 8,000 Muslims by the Bosnian Serb forces and the 43-month siege of Sarajevo.

 His staying at large represents an embarrassment for the international community, Nato and regional leaders.

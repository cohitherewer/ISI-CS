 Tomcat cruises to retirement

 Aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt, July 29 (Reuters): The US Navys F-14 Tomcat, built to protect the fleet from Soviet bombers, took its last flight off an aircraft carrier yesterday, closing one of the final chapters in its 32-year history.

 The retirement of the Tomcat, made famous in the movie Top Gun, clears the way for the navy to start using new military aircraft that supporters say can meet post-Cold War requirements more affordably.

 But for Tomcat pilots and aircraft enthusiasts, the end of the F-14 does not just mark an end of an aviation era ? it signals a trend in US government weapons spending that favours cost-cutting over performance.

 Its a Cold War icon with modern-day lethality, said Commodore Jim Howe, commander of the navys last Tomcat fighter squadron and the pilot on the last Tomcat to make the two-second, 240 kmph catapult launch off the carrier.

 Lieutenant Justin Halligan, the pilot who dropped the last bomb from a Tomcat over Iraq earlier this year, said the plane was at the top of its game or better, but times are different, moneys different.

 Pilots and machinists aboard the USS Roosevelt aircraft carrier, off the coast of Virginia, echoed those sentiments this week. 

 Were kind of retreating from an era of best you can build and moving to an era of best you can afford, said Richard Aboulafia, an analyst with the Teal Group aerospace. Theres no better sign of that than the retirement of the F-14. 

 Beyond reflection about the aircrafts powerful image, supersonic speed and unmatched dog-fighting capabilities, many sailors and analysts agreed the navy just doesnt need the Tomcat anymore.

 While some in the Navy criticise Washington, analysts say there is a lot more room for further cuts in the military aircraft budget given the changing face of war.

 Simple but deadly ground-based threats such as the roadside bombs used against US forces in Iraq, difficulties securing access to foreign bases and the near total lack of a rival in the air, raise questions over the need for maintaining high spending levels.

 The Tomcat had outlived its mission once the Cold War ended, and the federal government was quick to decide the cost, at more than $60 million per plane, was outweighing the benefit. The first Bush administration terminated new F-14 production in its 1990 budget, and the Navy in 1991 ended its plans to convert older versions, saving $6 billion.

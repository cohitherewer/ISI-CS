 Islamabad, Feb. 26 (Agencies): Pakistan police today briefly detained cricketer-turned politician Imran Khan and several Islamic leaders and fired teargas shells at scores of protestors in Lahore, who defied a government ban and took out rallies against publication of Prophet Mohammad cartoons. 

 Khan, who is the leader of the Tehrik-e-Insaf party, was detained when he tried joining a rally in Lahore. 

 The former captain is an ally-turned-opponent of President Pervez Musharraf aligned with the six-party Islamic alliance Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal (MMA) in recent months to oppose the military-backed government.

 MMA leader Qazi Hussain Ahmed was also taken into custody as he tried to get out of the heavily-guarded party office in Lahore. He was earlier put under house arrest. 

 Up to 70 protesters were detained today as they shouted Death to America, Death to Denmark and Death to European countries. 

 More than 10,000 Islamists rallied in Karachi to denounce the cartoons, published first in Denmark and reproduced in several European nations.

 This protest will continue until European countries and the newspapers which published these cartoons offer an apology to the Muslim world, Fazal-ur-Rehman, secretary-general of the MMA, said from Islamabad in a phone call relayed by loudspeakers to the crowd. Authorities earlier prevented Rehman, a fiery orator, from boarding a plane for Lahore to lead the protest there.

 Police today detained Hafiz Mohammad Saeed, founder of the outlawed Lashkar-e-Toiba, in Lahore.

 Earlier in the day, more than 100 MMA activists were detained in Lahore to prevent them from holding the rally, Amir Zulfiqar, a senior superintendent of police, said.

 Paramilitary troops and police were out in force at all main roads of Lahore and had blocked the roads leading to the headquarters of Jamaat-e-Islami, a major component of six-party MMA.

 The unrest in Pakistan over the cartoons has increasingly targeted President Pervez Musharrafs military-led government for its alliance with the US-led war on terrorism.

 Musharraf met a group of Muslim clerics yesterday and said his government would represent the sentiments of Muslims in international forums.

 We believe that such publications under the pretext of freedom of the press cannot be justified, the official Associated Press of Pakistan quoted him as saying.

 Two people died in violent protests in Lahore this month and three more in protests in the northwestern city of Peshawar. 

 The MMA has called for a countrywide strike on March 3, just before an expected visit to Islamabad by US. President George W. Bush. Musharraf told the clerics he would discuss the issue with Bush.

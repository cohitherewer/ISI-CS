 Sleaze row hits Blair

 Blair: Secret fund

 London, March 17 (Reuters): A sleaze row threatening British Prime Minister Tony Blair gained momentum today when his Labour party said it had received ?14 million in previously undeclared loans from individuals.

 The huge sums, which helped bankroll the partys election win last May, shocked some Labour lawmakers who accuse Blair and his inner circle of running a secret slush fund and risked deepening rifts within party ranks.

 Im astonished at the amount of money involved in these secret loans, and would want to know where the money has gone, Labour parliamentarian Ian Davidson said.

 The operation of these secret accounts is tarnishing the image of the Labour Party and the Labour government as a whole, when it is clear that only a very small number of people were involved in this misbehaviour, he said.

 Under party funding rules, loans do not need to be declared. But the disclosure that several wealthy businessmen were offered seats in parliaments upper house after lending Labour large sums has sparked the new cash-for-favours row.

 The furore adds to Blairs troubles as he battles party revolts over his governments public service reform agenda.

 Blair, who strongly denies selling peerages, said yesterday he knew about loans from individuals who were later nominated for seats in the House of Lords. 

 The row has raised doubts about the transparency of a government Blair said would be whiter than white after sleaze and scandal dogged the previous Conservative administration.

 US Lashkar conviction

 Virginia, June 7 (AP): A third-grade teacher has been found guilty of lending aid to the Lashkar-e-Toiba, becoming the 11th conviction in what the US government called a Virginia jihad network.

 Ali Asad Chandia, 29, a teacher at an Islamic school in College Park, Maryland, was convicted yesterday for providing material support to the terrorist outfit and conspiracy to do the same. 

 Chandia was accused of travelling 

 to Pakistan after the September 11, 2001, attacks and receiving 

 military training from the Lashkar. Upon his return in 2002, 

 he served as a chauffeur to a top Lashkar official in the 

 US, Mohammed Ajmal Khan, and helped him ship military training 

 equipment from the US to Pakistan.

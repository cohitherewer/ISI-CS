 Hold fire: Its a Taliban funeral

 PHILIP SHERWELL 

 The funeral gathering

 New York, Sept. 17: The American intelligence officers monitoring the satellite feed from an unmanned spy plane at their base in Afghanistan could hardly believe their eyes. 

 An estimated 190 Taliban fighters were lined up in tightly packed formation, captured in the crosshairs of a gun sight as the picture shows. 

 Rarely in the mountainous terrain of Afghanistan are so many Taliban fighters gathered together on open land. The target was too tempting to ignore: all it required was authorisation for the Predator drone to launch an air strike. 

 We were so excited. I came rushing in with the picture, an army officer told an NBC television journalist who obtained the grainy black-and-white photograph taken in July. But then, to his frustration, they were told that the US militarys rules of engagement made an attack impossible because the men were attending a funeral in a cemetery. 

 The officers then watched the satellite footage of the fighters splintering into small groups not big enough for the drone to target and heading back to their mountain redoubts. They were sure that prominent Taliban leaders were present. 

 At a time when British-led Nato forces are incurring heavy casualties as the resurgent Taliban pursues a guerrilla war on several fronts, the decision has caused amazement in America and been criticised by relatives of US troops killed in Afghanistan. 

 For many, it also brought back memories of the decision not to order an air strike when a Predator drone tracked Mullah Omar, the Taliban leader and Osama bin Laden ally, as he left Kabul in a convoy in late 2001 and took cover in a building with 100 fighters. 

 The disbelief was heightened as the picture of the assembled Taliban fighters appeared on an NBC news blog just two days after a suicide bomber killed six people at the funeral of the governor of Paktia province, who was assassinated by the Taliban. 

 The US military did not give a reason for the decision and does not discuss its rules of engagement. But it noted in a statement that while the Taliban had killed civilians during a funeral, coalition forces hold themselves to a higher moral and ethical standard than their enemies. 

 The intelligence officers monitoring the footage were in no doubt that the men were Taliban fighters. Nonetheless, the military remains extremely wary of hitting culturally sensitive targets, even with apparently credible information, as was the case when US aircraft mistakenly bombed a wedding party in Afghanistan in 2002. 

 But American caution has also proved expensive at times. When Mullah Omar was located in 2001, the CIA requested permission from Central Command in Florida to destroy the building. The response from the military commander was that his legal officer doesnt like this, so were not going to fire. The mullah escaped unscathed. 

 Yesterday, thousands of Afghan and foreign security forces kicked off a big new offensive against the Taliban in eastern Afghanistan as a Nato-led operation wound down in the south.

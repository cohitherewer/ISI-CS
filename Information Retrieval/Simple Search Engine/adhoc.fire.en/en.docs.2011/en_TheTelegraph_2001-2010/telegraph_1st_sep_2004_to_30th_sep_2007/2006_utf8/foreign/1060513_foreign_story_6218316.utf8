 UK euthanasia

 London, May 12 (Reuters): Britains House of Lords voted today to stall a controversial bill to allow doctors to help terminally ill patients end their lives. The assisted dying bill would let doctors prescribe, but not administer, lethal drugs to patients who are suffering unbearably. 

 Peers voted 148 to 100 to back an amendment which blocked the bill.

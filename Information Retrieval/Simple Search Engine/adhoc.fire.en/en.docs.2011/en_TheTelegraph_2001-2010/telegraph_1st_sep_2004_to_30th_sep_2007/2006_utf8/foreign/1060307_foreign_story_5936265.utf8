 Rape slur against SA leader

 Johannesburg, March 6 (Reuters): An HIV-positive AIDS activist testified in court today that South Africas former deputy president Jacob Zuma raped her without a condom, in a case that could end the charismatic leaders political career.

 The 31-year-old woman, a long-time Zuma family friend, gave graphic testimony as she took the stand for the first time. As more than 2,000 Zuma supporters demonstrated outside the Johannesburg courthouse, his accuser told how the man once seen as South Africas likely next President offered to tuck her in and then had sex with her against her will.

 I thought, Oh no, uncle (Zuma) cannot be naked, he is on top of me and I am in his house, the woman said.

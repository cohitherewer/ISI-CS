 US forces kill Taliban leader

 Osmani: Significant

 Kabul, Dec. 23 (Reuters): US forces said today they had killed the Talibans military chief in southern Afghanistan, where the insurgency is at its bloodiest, the most senior rebel leader killed yet.

 Akhtar Mohammad Osmani and two other guerrillas were killed in an air strike on their car on an isolated desert road on Tuesday, spokesman for the US-led coalition force, Colonel Tom Collins, said in Kabul. Mullah Osmani is the highest ranking Taliban leader that weve ever killed, he said. His death is very significant.

 The Taliban said Osmani, once annointed by the groups leader, Mullah Mohammad Omar, as his heir, was alive.

 We strongly deny this. He is not present in the area where American forces are claiming to have killed him, commander Mullah Hayat Khan said. The American and Nato forces from time to time make such false claims.

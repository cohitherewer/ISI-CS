 Lebanon link in German plot

 Berlin, Aug. 25 (Reuters): A man held in Lebanon in connection with a failed attack on German trains has confessed to planting a suitcase bomb and investigations suggest he might have links to al Qaida, the Lebanese government said today.

 When he saw the pictures, he admitted that he planted the bomb, Lebanons acting interior minister Ahmad Fatfat said. There is nothing clear now, but in his computer, we found something that can be related to al Qaida.

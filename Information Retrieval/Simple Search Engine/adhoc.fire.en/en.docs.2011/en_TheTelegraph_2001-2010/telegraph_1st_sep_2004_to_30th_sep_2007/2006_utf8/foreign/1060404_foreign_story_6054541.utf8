 Pak eases party curbs

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Islamabad, April 3: Four years after banning the militant party, Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan (SSP), Islamabad said it would allow it to start political activities in a very low profile, media reports said today.

 The English-language newspaper, The Daily Times, quoted sources as saying that the outlawed organisation, which allegedly had close links with the Taliban and al Qaida, has been allowed to operate under the name: Millat-e-Islamia Pakistan.

 The SSP is a Sunni sectarian outfit that has allegedly been involved in terrorist activities, primarily targeted against the minority Shia community in Pakistan. 

 Officials have placed two major conditions on the SSP to resume even low-key political activities, the paper quoted sources as saying. 

 The government has stressed that the SSPs leaders cannot incite sectarian violence in any way nor abuse any person at a public meeting, they added. Authorities decided to relax some restrictions on the SSP after these assurances and allow it to restart political activities as Millat-e-Islamia Pakistan, the paper said.

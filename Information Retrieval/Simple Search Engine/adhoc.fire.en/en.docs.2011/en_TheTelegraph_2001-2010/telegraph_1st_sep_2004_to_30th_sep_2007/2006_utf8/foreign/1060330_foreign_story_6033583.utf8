 Truant teen lesson

 Berlin, March 29 (Reuters): German police discovered a truant teenager at home in bed with her boyfriend after a neighbour spotted a man climbing into her window and reported a burglary, authorities said today.

 Thinking he had witnessed a break-in, the neighbour called police, who sped towards the would-be crime scene with their siren blaring. When officers arrived, the girls mother told them the room belonged to her 15-year-old daughter who was at school. Further investigation revealed the mother was wrong. She wasnt looking at school books, she was in bed with her boyfriend and was presumably learning something else, Frankfurt police said.

 Bothered by Britney art

 New York (AP): Britney Spears will soon be giving birth again ? in Brooklyn, New York, as a sexy sculpture that has drawn thousands of hate e-mails. This is a new take on pro-life (people who are opposed to abortion). Pro-lifers normally promote bloody images of abortion. This is the image of birth, Daniel Edwards said of his work, to be unveiled at a Brooklyn gallery in April. The life-size pop princess is naked and pregnant, crouching face-down on a bare-toothed bear rug as the babys head appears on the opposite end. When some bloggers heard about the exhibit, the gallery was inundated with about 3,000 emails from around the world. We also got calls from Tokyo, England, France. Some people are upset that Britney is being used for this subject matter, said gallery co-owner David Kesting.

 Afghan jail riot

 Pul-I-Charkhi, Afghanistan, 

 Feb. 26 (Reuters): Taliban and al Qaida inmates took 

 control of parts of the Afghan capitals main high 

 security prison and at least 30 prisoners were wounded in 

 attempts to quell the riot, officials said today.

 Bursts of gunfire were heard from the Pul-i-Charkhi prison on the eastern outskirts of Kabul. A police officer said seven prisoners had been killed.

 The unrest erupted late yesterday after prisoners led by Taliban and al Qaida militants took two female guards captive in a row over attempts to implement a new rule requiring inmates to wear prison uniforms, government officials said.

 As far as we know, some 1,500 prisoners are involved in this incident, a security official said. It went out of control and a clash broke out between the prisoners, including many Taliban, and the police, in which 30 people have been wounded. 

 Smoke could be seen coming from the prison after prisoners set fire to blankets and mattresses and chanted Long live the prisoners and Allahu Akbar, or God is Greatest. 

 Heavily armed police and troops 

 took position outside the jail and talks have begun between 

 the government and inmates.

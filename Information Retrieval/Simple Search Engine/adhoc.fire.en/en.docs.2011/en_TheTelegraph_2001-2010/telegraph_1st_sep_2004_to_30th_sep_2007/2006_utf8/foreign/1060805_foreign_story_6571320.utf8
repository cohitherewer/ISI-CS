 Lanka exodus

 Trincomalee, Aug. 4 (Reuters): Thousands of civilians fled Sri Lankas eastern battle zone by tractor and on foot today as shells fell nearby during an artillery battle between Tamil Tiger rebels and the army, survivors said.

 Small pockets of rebels continued firefights with troops in the eastern Muslim town of Mutur, where aid workers say between 20,000-30,000 people were trapped by the fighting.

 Tamil Tigers also attacked army camps and Norways peace envoy flew in to discuss the future of Nordic truce monitors as the island slides back to civil war.

 We left everything behind our wealth, our belongings. We have to be somewhere safe, said 24-year-old shop owner S.M. Ramees, arriving with thousands of fellow displaced at the town of Palathoppur south of Mutur.

 A dozen aid trucks organised by local Muslim groups drove towards Mutur carrying food and water, white flags flying from their windows. Soldiers drove by in armoured vehicles. At least 20 civilians, 12 Tigers and one soldier were killed yesterday. The military says it has killed more than 70 rebels in the past week and the Tigers say they have the bodies of 40 troops ready to hand over.

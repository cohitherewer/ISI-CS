 Ford whips up Indiana frenzy

 Berlin, March 15 (Reuters): Harrison Ford is ready to jump back into his favourite film role and begin shooting the fourth Indiana Jones movie soon, a German magazine quoted the Hollywood actor as saying today. 

 Steven Spielberg and I now have a script in hand that we both like. I believe that we can start with the filming soon, Ford was quoted as saying in an interview with German lifestyle and entertainment magazine Fit for Fun.

 The third and last Indy film, 1989 hit Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, starred Ford as the whip-swinging archaeologist and Sean Connery as his bumbling father.

 Ford, 63, was quoted as saying that he needed to do a little practising with the whip to avoid injuries.

 Australias NW magazine recently reported that actor Scarlett Johansson might be in the fourth Indiana Jones film. 

 Tom Cruise had been championing the Oscar nominee for a part in the movie as the pair worked together on the Armageddon drama The War of the Worlds. An insider said: Steven was saying there is a shortage of young actresses who can carry off a strong role.

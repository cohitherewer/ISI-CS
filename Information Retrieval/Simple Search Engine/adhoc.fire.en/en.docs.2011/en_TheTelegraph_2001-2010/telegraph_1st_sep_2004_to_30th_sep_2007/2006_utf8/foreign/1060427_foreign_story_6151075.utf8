 Malaysia mulls space prayer

 Bangi (Malaysia), April 26 (Reuters): As Malaysia prepares to pick its first astronaut, the countrys space agency is hunting for solutions to the problems it expects devout Muslims to face while in orbit, such as in which direction to pray.

 One of the five pillars of Islam requires the faithful to pray five times a day, and to face Mecca, the birthplace of Islam, while doing so. Astronauts aboard spaceships could have difficulty meeting these requirements.

 Among the astronauts needs, if he is a Muslim, are guidelines on performing prayers in space, and other aspects of life according to Islamic principles, Malaysian government official Mohd Ruddin Abdul Ghani said.

 There are three Muslims on a shortlist of four candidates from which Malaysia must pick two in May to begin training as astronauts. The programme was launched two years ago.

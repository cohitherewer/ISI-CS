 Jessica splits up

 Los Angeles, July 2 (Reuters): Jessica Simpson and Nick Lachey, who let America pry into their marriage with their MTV reality show, Newlyweds, have finalised their divorce, a spokesman for the singer-actress said.

 The marriage of Simpson (in picture) and Lachey crumbled late last year after three years. Celebrity magazines reported the two had yet to work out a financial agreement, but Simpsons spokesman, Rob Shuter, refused to comment.

 All I am confirming is that they are now in fact divorced, Shuter said.

 Lachey, 32, is promoting his album Whats Left of Me, while Simpson, 25, is recording a video for her new single, A Public Affair, after starring in last summers movie The Dukes of Hazzard.

 Vicar no to stars

 London, May 1: A vicar has rejected a proposal to film the Hollywood stars Sean Bean and Bob Hoskins at his church, because he fears gratuitous violence and bad language, reports The Daily Telegraph.

 The director Nick Love wanted to film The Outlaw in the Reverend Nick Bromfields picturesque church in the Forest of Dean, Gloucester. However, after seeing one of Loves previous films, The Business, about a young Cockney tearaway, Bromfield decided he did not want his church to be the backdrop for such graphic material.

the three days beginning Friday, while the teen gymnast drama Stick It

 $100 million fortune? Salma smirks

 Hayek: Bit of a joke

 Mexico City, July 22 (Reuters): Mexican big-screen siren Salma Hayek yesterday dismissed as nonsense reports that she has a $100 million fortune, and said if she did she would retire and use the money to help the poor.

 Local media in Mexico and Latin America reported this week that the Oscar-nominated actress had been ranked by Fortune magazine as the second-richest Latin American in Hollywood, with nearly half as much money as singer Jennifer Lopez.

 Its a huge lie. Its very, very far from reality. I dont have that amount of money, Hayek said, after reading an article in Mexican daily El Universal about a list of Latino millionaires in the US.

 Somebody sent me the story and I laughed. Its a bit like a joke. Obviously, I have never earned $100 million and I wouldnt even want to, she said in a telephone interview from her Los Angeles home.

 A spokesman for Fortune said he was not aware the magazine had published such a list. Its certainly not a list weve done. It seems somebody got their facts mixed up, he said. 

 Hayek, 39, a smouldering beauty and former star of a top Mexican soap who seduced Hollywood when she appeared opposite Antonio Banderas in the 1995 movie Desperado, is not known for flashy big-budget productions. While famed for her curvaceous figure, she makes as many headlines speaking on violence against women and discrimination toward Hispanic migrants in the US as she does twirling on the red carpet.

 With things as they are in Mexico, it bothers me that they put me in a group of millionaires with $100 million I dont have when there are so many people dying of hunger, Hayek said, pausing the interview in a brief panic to scoop a drowning rat out of her swimming pool.

 Born to a Lebanese businessman and a Mexican opera singer, Hayek is one of Mexicos highest-profile celebrities and has raised awareness about issues like Mexicos failure to solve a spate of brutal murders of women in the northern border city of Ciudad Juarez.

 If I had $100 million I would have retired and would be doing more things on an altruistic level than I can now. I would have opened centres in Mexico for violence against women and many other things, she said.

 Hayek was nominated for an Oscar for her passionate 2002 portrayal of Frida Kahlo, the legendary Mexican painter who spent much of her life in bed in a plaster cast while her artist husband dallied with other women.

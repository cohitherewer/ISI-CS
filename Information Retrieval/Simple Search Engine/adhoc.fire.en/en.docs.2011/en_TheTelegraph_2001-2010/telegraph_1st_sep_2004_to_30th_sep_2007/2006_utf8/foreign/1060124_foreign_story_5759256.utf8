 Welcome to Singhdale

 K.P. NAYAR

 Toronto, Jan. 23: Amid Canadas biggest urban sprawl in and around Toronto, known as the Greater Toronto Area or GTA, people of Indian origin are contributing to modern urban lexicon.

 Like every big city in the world, Toronto has its downtown or urban areas and well-laid out suburban areas: but unlike any other city, Toronto also has huge urban and suburban pockets, which locals describe as this citys turban areas.

 These are enclaves where Torontos Sikhs and other Punjabis live, which will elect by the end of today at least three Sikh members to Canadas incoming parliament.

 Brampton, which is at the heart of Torontos turban areas, alone has 85,000 South Asians, 21 per cent of the citys residents.

 Ruby Dhalla, the well-groomed doctor-turned politician under 30, is a Liberal Party incumbent fighting for re-election in one of Bramptons constituencies, Brampton-Springdale.

 People no longer refer to this constituency as Springdale: they call it Singhdale. Just as the Air-India flight from Toronto to Birmingham and onward to Amritsar is known here as the Singh Express.

 In the last election to parliament in 2004, the Liberal Party in Brampton-Springdale was all set to nominate Andrew Kania, a non-Punjabi as its candidate.

 But Prime Minister Paul Martin wanted to make sure that the seat would be won by his party. He stepped in, overruled the local party and nominated the young Punjabi, Dhalla, as the sure shot candidate.

 Also in 2004, a delimitation of GTA constituencies created a new seat in parliament: Mississauga-Brampton South. 

 There, another Punjabi candidate under 30, the political newcomer Navdeep Bains, defeated three veterans and went on to win both the Liberal Party nomination and the seat.

 The sitting Liberal MP in Brampton West is Colleen Beaumier, 61, who was won the seat four times although she is not of Indian origin in this predominantly South Asian constituency.

 She has no hesitation in claiming on the record that I am more Indian than Candian. I think I was Indian in my last birth.

 Maybe, she has no choice but to say so. Her two opponents this time are both Punjabis, conservative Baljit Ghosal and New Democrat Jagtar Shergill.

 Greater Torontos turban area is home to a Punjabi FM radio station, which has about 150,000 devoted listeners. Politics is regular fare there and appearance on the station is a must for any candidate who has set eyes on seats in the Canadian parliament, which have a Punjabi vote bank.

 Greater Tornto is also home to the biggest gurdwara in North America, which attracts at least 30,000 people every weekend. Politicians, both Sikhs and non-Indians, are regulars at this gurdwara.

 For that matter, prime minister Martin and Conservative leader Stephen Harper, who hopes to inherit Martins job this week, have been regularly going to gurdwaras and Hindu temples in order to attract South Asian votes in this election.

 In Greater Toronto, another favourite method for politicians to win support is by attending Indian weddings. Most Indian weddings draw crowds ranging from 500 to 2,500, something unheard of in other communities.

 Gurbax Malhi, the senior-most among the Indo-Canadian MPs says there are months when he attends at least one wedding among his constituents every day, sometimes more.

 And unlike, yet, in India, politicians make speeches at Indian weddings in Canada!

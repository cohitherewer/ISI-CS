 Budapest calm after riots

 Budapest, Oct. 24 (Reuters): Budapest was calm today after a day of anti-government protests in the capital in which some 130 people were injured when police used rubber bullets, tear gas and water cannon to disperse demonstrators.

 Police arrested about 100 people from the crowds who set up barricades and attacked riot police late into the night, marring yesterdays celebration of the 50th anniversary of an uprising against Soviet rule. Police said the violence had been quelled by around 0000 GMT.

 Opposition parties criticised both the government and police for their handling of yesterdays violence but the ruling Socialists and police defended their record.

 Budapest police chief Peter Gergenyi told state television his units had used only appropriate and necessary force.

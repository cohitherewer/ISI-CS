 China pragmatic on N-deal

 JEHANGIR S. POCHA 

 Hu Jintao: Strategic plans

 Beijing, Dec. 14: Washingtons decision to break its 30-year nuclear embargo on India and supply New Delhi with civilian nuclear technology is being seen here as another attempt to contain Chinas rise.

 The US makes such decisions to balance the power structure in Asia, and to put restraint on China, said Prof. Shi Yinghong, director of the Centre for American Studies at the Peoples University in Beijing. As a big nuclear power, the USs decision to supply India, not a recognised nuclear power, is irresponsible.

 Yet, despite reports in Chinas state-controlled media criticising the impending Indo-US nuclear deal, Beijing may not jeopardise its relations with Delhi and Washington by opposing the agreement at the all-important Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG).

 Foreign ministry spokesperson Qin Gang told reporters yesterday that China considers that cooperation between countries to use nuclear energy for peaceful purpose will be beneficial to maintain the principles and effectiveness of international nuclear non-proliferation.

 China realises its opposition will not change the current situation, Shi said. So strategically speaking, China will not risk its relationship with either the US or India by opposing the agreement at the NSG, he added.Pragmatism has always been a hallmark of Beijing s diplomacy and there appears to be a new sentiment in the Communist Party that China must reconcile itself to Indias growing status in the world. 

 While the Chinese foreign ministry and military still harbour reservations vis--vis India, President Hu Jintao is said to be keen to enhance Sino-Indo ties, which he sees as essential for building a multi-polar world. 

 Shi said this was why Hu had signed a nuclear agreement of his own with India during his visit to Delhi last month. While the move was underplayed by both sides, and still needs to be fleshed out in more detail, it revealed Chinas desire to work with India and keep New Delhi from falling too deeply into the US orbit. 

 Objectively speaking, there are some similarities between the US-India deal and the China-India deal, Shi said. The decisions were both based on strategic considerations. Chinas cooperation with India also aims at restraining the power of the US. In fact, sources said, Chinas move had pressured the US into diluting some of the riders it had initially attached to the nuclear deal with India, such as insisting Delhi join Washington in pressuring Iran on its nuclear programme. 

 The fact that Hu did not announce any major nuclear agreements with Pakistan when he flew there from Mumbai also signalled China is no longer equating the two countries. While many Indians might be pleased at the way New Delhi has been playing the increasing rivalry between Beijing and Washington for its own advantage, the fact is that the two recognised nuclear powers continue to have a common objective in curtailing Indias military nuclear capabilities. 

 Shi said that while the nuclear agreements the US and China have signed with India comprised their stand on nuclear proliferation, I think they will make sure that India only develops civilian nuclear technology.

 Sex to pay fees

 London, 

 Oct. 8 (PTI): An increasing number of students 

 in the UK are resorting to prostitution or other jobs in 

 the sex industry to pay rising university tuition fees, 

 according to a study.

 Research by Kingston University, London, suggested that there has been a 50 per cent rise in numbers over the past six years in such cases.

 In a survey that asked 130 students whether they knew any friends involved in the sex industry, one in 10 said they knew of students who had stripped, lap-danced or worked at massage parlours and escort agencies to support themselves. Just over 6 per cent said they knew students who worked as prostitutes, the Sunday Times reported.

 The study found that alcohol and mental problems led some women into stripping and lap-dancing. But those resorting to prostitution were simply working to earn money. 

 Tuition fees, first introduced in 1998 at 1,000 a year, have risen to 3,000 this year at all but a few universities. The average student loan at graduation last year was 8,948, but Natwest Bank said students now in their first year could expect to graduate with liabilities of more than 14,700. 

 A 2004 study said clients spend about 534 million a year on prostitutes. A London escort said she had been working in the industry since 1999 to support herself through a masters degree and now a doctorate in international politics.

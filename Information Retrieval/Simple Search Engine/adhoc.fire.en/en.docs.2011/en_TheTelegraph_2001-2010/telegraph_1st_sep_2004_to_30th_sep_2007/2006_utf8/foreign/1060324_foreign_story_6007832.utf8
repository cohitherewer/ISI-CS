 Hostages rescued in Iraq

 - Canadian Harmeet among peace activists released

 Baghdad, March 23 (Reuters): Weeks of intelligence work in lawless west Baghdad and a rapid response by special forces to information extracted from a prisoner led to British troops rescue of three Christian peace activists in Baghdad today.

 British and US officials were reluctant to give details of the release of Canadians Harmeet Sooden and Jim Loney and Briton Norman Kember, not wishing to jeopardise efforts to free several other hostages believed still held around the capital.

 It was part of ongoing operations related to hostages, said British military spokesman Wing Commander Tony Radcliffe.

 Among foreigners still missing are two Kenyan engineers and American journalist Jill Carroll, seized in Baghdad in January.

 Sporadic gunfire throughout the day after the operation near the Abu Ghraib suburb that is a stronghold of Sunni insurgents suggested Iraqi forces might be continuing a sweep of the area.

 The killing of a fourth Christian hostage, American Tom Fox, may have spurred greater urgency in the hunt. His tortured body was found in Baghdad on March 10, three days after his three colleagues were seen in a videotape appealing for help.

 The dawn raid that found the three hostages tied up and unguarded in a house was led by British troops and involved others from the US-led coalition, officials said.

 They were acting on intelligence obtained three hours earlier from one of two people arrested the night before.

 Though not a shot was fired, it is likely the operation was led by special forces ready to quell resistance and, especially, get the captives out unharmed after four months in captivity: It was a fairly clinical extraction, Radcliffe said.

 Foreign secretary Jack Straw said: It follows weeks and weeks of very careful work by military coalition personnel in Iraq and many civilians as well.

 That suggested that the arrest of the man who provided the final tip was the product of detective work rather than chance.

 Special police teams, apparently from Britain and possibly Canada, had been working on the ground since the four men were seized in west Baghdad on November 26, British officials said, stressing the role civilians played in the process.

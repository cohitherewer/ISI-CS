 Bruce pain for Jazz City

 New Orleans, May 1 (AP): New Jerseys favourite son was adopted by New Orleans yesterday, as Bruce Springsteen ? through speeches and song ? vocalised the anger, frustration, pain and resilience of this hurricane-battered city at the annual Jazz amp; Heritage Festival.

 Decrying what he called criminal ineptitude in Hurricane Katrinas wake, Springsteen jabbed at the political powers he deemed responsible for New Orleans slow recovery. 

 Perhaps the most pointed moment came as he prepared to sing an old song that he had rewritten lyrics to for New Orleans. 

 Noting that he visited the citys ninth ward, perhaps the most devastated area in the city, Springsteen said: I saw sights I never thought Id see in an American city, and added: The criminal ineptitude makes you furious.

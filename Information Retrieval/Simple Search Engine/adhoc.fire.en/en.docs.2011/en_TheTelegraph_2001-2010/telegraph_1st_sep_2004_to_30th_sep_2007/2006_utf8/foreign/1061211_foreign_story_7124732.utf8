 London, Dec. 10 (Reuters): The widow of the murdered former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko says her husband angered members of the Russian security services by speaking out against them, but she never imagined they would kill him.

 Marina Litvinenko, 44, told British newspapers she believed members of the FSB, the successor to Russias KGB, could have been responsible for the death of her husband, who she called Sasha.

 Sasha never had enemies in his life, she told the Sunday Times, but because he was a former FSB officer and knew, just like me, that you never can escape from the FSB, and he was starting to speak openly about crime ...

 I cant say (it was) these people but Im absolutely sure they didnt forgive him for what he did.

 Litvinenko was killed in London with a lethal dose of radioactive polonium-210 and died on November 23. British and Russian police have opened murder inquiries.

 In a statement released after his death, Litvinenko accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of killing him.

 The Kremlin has denied involvement in a case that has spawned numerous conspiracy theories, revived memories of Cold War spying and strained relations between Russia and Britain.

 Litvinenko became a British citizen shortly before he died.

 Of course he had enemies, but not (enemies) to kill him in this horrible way. Sasha never felt like he was a first target, his widow added.

 She said November 1 the day her husband was poisoned was the sixth anniversary of their arrival in Britain, a day they always celebrated.

 German probe

 German prosecutors today opened an investigation into a Russian associate of the murdered ex-spy Alexander Litvinenko after finding traces of the radioactive substance polonium in properties he used in Hamburg.

 Russian businessman Dmitry Kovtun, 

 who met Litvinenko in London on the day he fell ill, is 

 being investigated on suspicion of illegally handling radioactive 

 material, Hamburgs chief prosecutor Martin Koehnke 

 told a news conference.

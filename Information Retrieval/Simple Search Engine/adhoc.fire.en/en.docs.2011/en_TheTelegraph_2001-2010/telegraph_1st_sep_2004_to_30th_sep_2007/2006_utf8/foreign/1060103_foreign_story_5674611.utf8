 Pak ruling party loses ministers

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Islamabad, Jan 2: The ruling Pakistan Muslim League today lost several ministers in a draw called to retire half of the 100-member upper house of parliament.

 The fifty senators from all four provinces, Federally Administered Tribal Areas and Islamabad are to retire on March 11 as a result of the draw held in parliament under the supervision of the acting chief election commissioner Justice Abdul Hameed Dogar.

 The remaining fifty members will complete their six-year term which will end on March 11, 2009. 

 The ministers who retired after three years today included former ISI chief Javed Ashraf Qazi, who looks after the education ministry, state minister for interior Dr Shehzad Wasim, youth affairs minister Muhammad Ali Durrani and privatisation minister Dr Abdul Hafeez Sheikh.

 Wasim Sajjad is also retiring on March 11. He has the unique distinction of serving as chairman of the upper house for over a decade before shifting loyalties to the ruling Pakistan Muslim League from Nawaz Sharifs party.

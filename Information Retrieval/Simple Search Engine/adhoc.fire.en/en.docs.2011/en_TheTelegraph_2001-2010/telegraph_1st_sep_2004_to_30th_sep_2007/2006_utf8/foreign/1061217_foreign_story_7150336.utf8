 Its one of those things where its like the least threatening person, the 31-year-old actress said. Good luck to you guys, I hope its not too awkward.

I wouldnt like Sasha if I met her offstage, the 25-year-old singer-actress tells Parade magazine. Oh, no. Shes too aggressive, too strong, too sassy, too sexy! Im not her in real life at all. Im not flirtatious and super-confident and fearless like her.

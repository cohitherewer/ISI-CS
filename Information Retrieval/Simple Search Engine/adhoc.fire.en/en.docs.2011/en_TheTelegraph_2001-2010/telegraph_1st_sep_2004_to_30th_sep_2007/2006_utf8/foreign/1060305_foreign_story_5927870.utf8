 Scandal splits UK minister, husband

 Tessa Jowell (top) and David Mills: Culture shock 

 London, March 4 (Reuters): A British government minister and close ally of Prime Minister Tony Blair is to separate from her husband, who faces a high-level corruption probe in Italy, her husbands lawyer said today.

 Culture minister Tessa Jowell survived an inquiry this week into whether she had broken a ministerial code over the couples financial arrangements.

 But she remained under pressure after the investigation left open the possibility of links between her tax lawyer husband David Mills and a bribery allegation against Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.

 The lawyer, David Kirk, said the couple were separating because of the dreadful strain caused by the inquiries.

 They hope that over time their relationship can be restored, but, given the current circumstances, they have agreed a period of separation, he said in a statement.

 Blairs Downing Street office said Jowells separation was a private matter and that she retained the Prime Ministers full support.

 Blair, who has good relations with Berlusconi, is fighting to maintain his authority before several difficult parliamentary votes, most notably on school reform.

 Jowell, responsible for preparations for Londons 2012 Olympic Games, was cleared on Thursday of breaching the code of conduct for ministers after she said she was not aware of a $600,000 payment used to repay a mortgage on the couples home.

 But the inquiry by Britains top civil servant made no attempt to explain how Mills got the money. Jowell said her husband had not told her about the money, received in 2000, until she became aware of it four years later.

 By the time I became aware of it, he had already agreed with the inland revenue that it should be classified as earnings on which tax was paid, Jowell said.

 I did not, therefore, consider it necessary to make any reference about any of this to my permanent secretary, she said. I fully accept that my husband should have informed me and if he had, I would of course have reported it.

 Mills said through his lawyer he was confident he would be cleared in a long-running Italian inquiry into his and Berlusconis financial affairs. My client wishes to state categorically that he has never been bribed by Berlusconi or by anyone on his behalf, Kirk said. 

 It must be clear to all that the Italian prosecutors are feeding information to the press about my client, with the intention of trying the case in the media rather than by due process. 

 Italian prosecutors want to know whether the money in question came from Berlusconi, and if that amounted to a crime. 

 In 2004, they asked Britains Serious Fraud Office about prospects for extraditing Mills under British law. 

 According to their code of conduct, British ministers and members of their family must not accept gifts which appear to place them under an obligation to return the favour.

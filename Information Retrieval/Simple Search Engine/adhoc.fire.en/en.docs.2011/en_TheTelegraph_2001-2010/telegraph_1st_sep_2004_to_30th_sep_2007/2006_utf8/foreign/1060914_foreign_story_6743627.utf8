 Dahl day

 London, Sept. 13 (AP): Britain celebrated its first Roald Dahl Day today to mark the 90th anniversary of the birth of the much-loved author of childrens classics Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Matilda and James and the Giant Peach.

 Fans across Britain were encouraged to wear yellow, Dahls favourite colour, speak in Dahls invented language, gobblefunk trade books and make up Oompa-Loompa dances.

 Children and parents participated in parties and book-readings this week to celebrate the writer, who died in 1990. 

 New book

 New York (AP): The latest work by Michael 

 Crichton is a futuristic thriller set in the present. Next, 

 to be released on November 28 by HarperCollins, has an announced 

 first printing of 2 million and a storyline the publisher 

 bills as fast, furious. Do you want to 

 design your own pet? Change the stripes on the fish in your 

 aquarium? Did you know one fifth of all your genes are owned 

 by someone else? reads a press release issued on Tuesday.

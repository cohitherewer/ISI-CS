 Cuba behind Kennedy murder, reveals film

 KATE CONNOLLY

 Kennedy: Mysterious end

 Berlin, Jan. 4: The Cuban secret service was behind the assassination of President John F Kennedy, according to evidence presented in a new television documentary.

 Rendezvous with Death, to be shown on German television on Friday, offers the most convincing evidence that Fidel Castros regime was behind the most talked-about murder of the 20th century.

 A former agent of the Cuban secret service G2 talks for the first time about how Lee Harvey Oswald, the assassin, was, he claims, pointed out to the Cubans by the KGB.

 Oscar Marino, who fell out with the Castro regime, said the Cubans were desperate to eliminate Kennedy, an opponent of the revolution who wanted to kill Castro.

 You ask why we took Oswald? he said to the German film maker Wilfried Huismann. Oswald was a dissident: he hated his country. He possessed certain characteristics. There wasnt anyone else. You take what you can get... Oswald volunteered to kill Kennedy. Oswald was a communist who spent three years in the Soviet Union and shot Kennedy in Dallas. He was killed by Jack Ruby after his arrest, leaving his motives shrouded in mystery. 

 Huismann spent three years persuading people to break their silence about Oswalds alleged Cuba connections. His film is based on testimony by former US, Cuban and Russian agents, KGB files and Mexican archives.

 One of the main witnesses is a retired FBI agent, Lawrence Keenan, now in his eighties. Keenan was sent after the assassination to trace Oswalds footsteps in Mexico.

 The evidence he found ? linking the Cubans with the murder ? prompted the FBI head, J Edgar Hoover, on the orders of President Lyndon Johnson, to withdraw Keenan after three days.

 This was perhaps the worst investigation the FBI was ever involved in, said Keenan. 

 I realised that I was used. I felt ashamed. We missed a moment in history.

 Mexico City was considered a Pandoras Box by the Johnson administration, which feared a war with Cuba were the truth to be revealed to the American people.

 They were afraid of what will happen. They didnt want to... know the truth for fear it would mean we go to war. Johnson sincerely feared for his own life. 

 Alexander Haig, a military adviser to Kennedy, said in the film that Johnson was terrified his people would learn the truth. He [Johnson] said: We simply must not allow the American people to believe that Fidel Castro could have killed our president.

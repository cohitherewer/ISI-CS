 Pitt to help rebuild city

 New Orleans, Sept. 1 (AP): As residents work to rebuild their lives and homes a year after Hurricane Katrina, actor Brad Pitt says he and girlfriend Angelina Jolie will be frequent visitors to the city observing the progress.

 The couple was in New Orleans yesterday, though only Pitt appeared at an afternoon news conference to announce the winner of the design competition he launched in April for plans to rebuild hurricane-ravaged neighbourhoods using environmentally friendly designs and construction.

 Wee going to be spending a lot of time down here, Pitt said just after the announcement was made. Preproduction for his next movie was scheduled to begin in November, and Pitt said he would be in New Orleans for much of January and February for filming.

 Around that time, he also hoped to break ground on the first phase of the neighbourhood redevelopment project slated for a section of the devastated Ninth Ward, he said.

 Pitt said the goal is to replicate the project in other parts of the city. This is not difficult. Its relatively easy if youre rebuilding, quot; he said.

 Nepalis seek news of missing

 Kathmandu, Sept. 5 (Reuters): Hundreds of people protested in the Nepali capital for the second straight day today demanding information about friends and relatives they say disappeared during a decade-old fight against Maoist rebels.

 Dozens of protesters, whose demonstration has been backed by the rebels, were wounded late yesterday when police beat them with rattan sticks as they gathered outside the high security army headquarters in the capital.

 We will continue to protest until the government provides information about the people who are missing after being arrested by troops, said Sonu Pokharel, an official of a group set up by the families of those missing after being detained.

 Nepals state-funded National Human Rights Commission said last week at least 936 people were missing in the conflict and blamed both the security forces and Maoists for disappearances.

 The UN also called on both sides to give information on those who have disappeared during the conflict. But this weeks protest was supported by the rebels and aimed against the security forces.

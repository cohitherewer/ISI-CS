 Maoists hail truce offer, to join talks

 Kathmandu, May 4 (Reuters): Nepals Maoist rebels welcomed today a ceasefire announced by the new, multi-party government and said they would join talks to try and end a decade-old insurgency that has killed thousands.

 The Maoist reaction came a day after new Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koiralas government announced an indefinite truce to match a ceasefire declared by the insurgents last week.

 The government also decided to seek the withdrawal of Interpol arrest warrants against rebel leaders, remove the terrorist tag on them and urged them to join peace talks. We welcome it as a positive move forward towards fulfilling the aspirations of the people for democracy, peace and progress, rebel chief Prachanda said.

 The rebel chief said the country was on its way to becoming a republic after weeks of often violent mass protests last month. 

 The desire of the people expressed through the popular movement is to adopt a republican system through an unconditional constituent Assembly, he said. 

 We are entering the talks with deep responsibility and commitment to the 12-point understanding with political parties, he said, referring to a loose deal struck in November with seven parties to end the kings absolute rule.

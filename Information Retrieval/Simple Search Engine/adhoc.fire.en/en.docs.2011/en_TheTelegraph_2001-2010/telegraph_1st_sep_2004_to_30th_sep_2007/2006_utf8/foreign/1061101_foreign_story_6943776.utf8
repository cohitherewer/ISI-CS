 Dhaka, Oct. 31 (Reuters): Bangladesh President Iajuddin Ahmed sacked or transferred 27 senior bureaucrats on his first day as head of an interim government after Opposition parties set him a deadline to prove his neutrality.

 The President has begun to act towards fulfilling the demands, a senior government official said today. Iajuddin was sworn in on Sunday evening as chief adviser of the caretaker authority to supervise January elections in Bangladesh.

 But the main Opposition party, the Awami League, and its allies have asked him to demonstrate by November 3 that he is neutral and can be trusted for the job.

 The caretaker authority replaced Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), whose five-year mandate ended last Friday.

 Violent protests over who should lead the three-month administration killed at least 25 people and injured hundreds over the weekend. Clashes between rival parties continued today and the death toll rose to 29, police said.

 Iajuddins administration ordered security tightened to avert further violence, which analysts said could derail the election process. Officials said around 500 people had been detained in the past 24 hours alone.

 Bangladeshi newspapers said Iajuddin faced a tough task in trying to ensure a free and impartial vote. The public perception of him being a (BNP) man is unavoidable... A person in such a position is generally the object of suspicion of others, the Daily Star said. It is thus for the President to de-link himself from the BNP and rise beyond any party or personal feelings and consider all the issues from the national perspective, the daily said. British foreign office minister Kim Howells urged the caretaker government in a statement to act with neutrality in the line of the constitution and... to work towards free, fair and peaceful elections. 

 UN secretary-general Kofi Annan appealed to the countrys main political parties to work together to find common ground for the elections, acting in the interest of democracy and the welfare of the nation, a UN statement said.

 Diplomatic missions in Dhaka asked their citizens to move with caution, officials said.

 Awami chief Sheikh Hasina handed Iajuddin a list of demands yesterday, including reforms to the election commission and a pruning of the civil and police administration.

 Hasina, a former Prime Minister, said Khaledas government had installed trusted and loyal officials in many key posts before quitting, ready to engineer her return to power.

 The senior government official said that, in addition to his personnel changes, Iajuddin had ordered Khaledas photographs removed from state offices, another of Hasinas pre-conditions. But there was no word on whether he would meet the main Opposition demand: removal of Chief Election Commissioner M.A. Aziz and his deputies, whom Hasina says has a pro-BNP bias.

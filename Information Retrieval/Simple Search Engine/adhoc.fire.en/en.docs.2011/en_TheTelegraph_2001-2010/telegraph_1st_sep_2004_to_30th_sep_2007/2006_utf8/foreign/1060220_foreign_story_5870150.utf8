The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Danish envoy leaves Pak

 Islamabad, Feb. 19 (Reuters): Police fired teargas and rubber bullets to break up a banned protest against cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad in Islamabad today and Denmark said its ambassador to Pakistan had returned home for security reasons. 

 The government banned the demonstration after similar protests in Pakistan turned violent, with at least five people killed in the past week.

 The government banned the demonstration after similar protests in Pakistan turned violent, with at least five people killed in the past week.

 But the Muttahida Majlis-i-Amal (MMA), an alliance of six Islamist parties, said its followers would defy the ban and around 1,000 protesters managed to congregate near a central bazaar, chanting religious and anti-government slogans.

 Denmark said its ambassador to Pakistan had returned home. 

 The Danish ambassador in Pakistan, Bent Wigotski, has returned temporarily to Denmark because it is practically impossible for him to do his job under the current circumstances, the foreign ministry said in a statement.

 Lars Thuesen, director general of Denmarks Consulate Service, said the departure was not a diplomatic issue. He has left the country for security reasons. 

 The cartoons were published by Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten last year and later reprinted in many newspapers, mainly in Europe, as part of a debate about the rights and responsibilities of free speech.

 Denmark closed its embassy in Pakistan on Friday because of security concerns and issued a new travel warning, urging Danes to leave the country. 

 Thuesen said there were no expatriate consulate staff left in Pakistan, but that around 100 Danes had chosen to remain.

 Pakistan has issued diplomatic protests over the cartoons and recalled its ambassador from Denmark.

 A leading Muslim cleric in the northwestern city of Peshawar has offered a reward to anyone who kills one of the Danish cartoonists who drew the pictures.

 In Islamabad, demonstrators lampooned President Pervez Musharraf as a lackey of U.S. President George W. Bush.

 Police and paramilitary troops patrolled the streets, barbed wire was placed across main routes ? including that leading to parliament ? and vehicles were searched.

 But around 100 protesters broke through the cordons and were joined by hundreds of others from side streets. Police fired teargas and when protesters retaliated by throwing stones, fired warning shots into the air and what a local official said were rubber bullets into the crowd.

 Police put MMA president Qazi Hussain Ahmed under house arrest in Lahore before he could travel to Islamabad.

 Another senior MMA leader, Fazul-ur-Rehman, and a group of around 30 followers, including parliamentarians, assembled at one of the main entry points into Islamabad, but were forced to abandon their march after police fired teargas.

 The whole Pakistani nation will continue and the Muslim world will continue coming on (to) the streets until an apology is offered for this sinister act and a promise made not to repeat it, Rehman told followers.

 MMA supporters burned tyres on roads in the nearby city of Rawalpindi, where police had detained over 100 activists.

 In Indonesia, more than 200 members of the militant Islamic Defenders Front pelted the U.S. embassy in Jakarta with eggs and stones to protest against the cartoons of the Prophet and his depiction in a sculpture at the U.S. Supreme Court in Washington.

 Identical twins set to rule Poland

 Lech (left) and Jaroslaw Kaczynski: Double take

 Warsaw, July 8 (AP): The US has its political power families ? the Kennedys, Clintons, Bushes. But Poland is about to top that.

 The country today faced the prospect of having identical twin brothers simultaneously hold the posts of Prime Minister and President, in what would perhaps be the most striking feature of the countrys ever-chaotic political scene.

 President Lech Kaczynski, who took office in December after winning the post in October, would swear in his twin Jaroslaw ? chairman of the socially conservative Law and Justice party ? as the head of a new cabinet if he wins confirmation in parliament.

 Since the party won elections last autumn, Jaroslaw Kaczynski has used his role as chairman to guide the government ? but always from the sidelines. It was the popular Prime Minister, Kazimierz Marcinkiewicz, who represented the government in Brussels.

 But the two apparently fell out over Marcinkiewiczs choice of a new finance minister, and today the party confirmed Marcinkiewicz had resigned and that party officials had recommended Kaczynski as his replacement. The prospect of having identical portly grey-haired 57-year-old twins in the two top posts has loomed as a possibility since Lech embarked on his presidential campaign last year. 

 But Jaroslaw had pledged during the campaign that he would refrain from becoming Prime Minister to help his brothers shot at the presidency.

 Pak urged to pardon Briton

 Islamabad, May 17 (Reuters): British parliamentarians have asked Pakistan to spare the life of a British national due to be hanged for murder on June 3, officials said today.

 Mirza Tahir Hussain, from Leeds in northern England and of Pakistani descent, was arrested in Rawalpindi in 1988 on charges of murdering and robbing a taxi driver who had reportedly tried to physically and sexually assault him.

 Our High Commission in London has received some letters from NGOs and parliamentarians, Tasnim Aslam, spokeswoman for Pakistans foreign office, said.

 Diplomatic sources said the British government is expected to request President Musharraf to commute Hussains death sentence. Musharraf turned down an appeal for mercy from Hussain last year, Aslam said.

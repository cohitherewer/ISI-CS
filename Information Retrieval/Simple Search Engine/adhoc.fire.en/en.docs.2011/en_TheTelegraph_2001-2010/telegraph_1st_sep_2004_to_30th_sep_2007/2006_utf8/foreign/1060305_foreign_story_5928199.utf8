 Baffling legs

 Los Angeles, March 4 (Reuters): Two prosthetic legs stolen from a 16-year-old California girl have mysteriously turned up in her mothers van, the second time in three months that an artificial limb belonging to the teen has been taken and then returned, police said yesterday.

 Los Angeles policeman David Austin said investigators dusted the slightly damaged limbs for fingerprints and had interviewed a laundry list of people but were baffled by the thefts.

 Were treating this as a crime, Austin said. We have a residential burglary to deal with. This is grand theft and burglary and if we find out whos responsible well take appropriate action.

 The two legs, which were taken from Melissa Huffs bedroom in February, were found on Wednesday in the back of her mothers van, Austin said.

 Air Abdul

 Las Vegas (AP): Paula Abdul was allowed to board a plane at the Las Vegas airport without passing through a security checkpoint, prompting all passengers and luggage to be screened when they landed in California, officials said on Friday. A worker led the American Idol judge and a companion around the mandatory screening process before they boarded a Southwest Airlines flight headed to Burbank, California, on Thursday afternoon. A spokeswoman said she could not confirm reports that the employee was trying to help the pop star avoid a swarm of fans. Federal transportation safety administration officials were alerted to the security breach while the plane was in the air.

 Car chase

 Los Angeles (Reuters): A 25-year-old woman grabbed a policemans sports utility vehicle on Thursday and led police on a two-hour televised car chase through suburban Los Angeles county. No injuries were reported in the pursuit ? a staple of local TV news in the sprawling car capital of the world. Policeman Dave Jennings said the woman, who was described as having a long criminal record, was being questioned in the back seat of the SUV about a stolen vehicle. She made her way into the front seat and drove off. Followed by police cars and news helicopters, the woman screamed and sobbed into the on-board radio as officers tried to calm her down. In the end, the woman came to a stop and was arrested at gunpoint.

 Gum paint

 Detroit (Reuters): Painter Helen Frankenthalers landmark abstract work The Bay just got a little more abstract ? to the dismay of Detroit museum officials. A 12-year-old boy visiting the Detroit Institute of Arts with his school group on Friday stuck a wad of chewing gum on the painting, which is worth an estimated $1.5 million, the Detroit Free Press said. The barely chewed Wrigleys Extra Polar Ice gum left a residue stain about the size of a coin in the lower left-hand corner of the painting. The boy was suspended from Holly Academy, a Detroit-area school.

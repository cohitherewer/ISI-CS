 Madarsas try to evade Pak probes

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Islamabad, June 13: Dozens of Pakistani seminaries, or madarsas, have formed trusts and charities to avoid government investigations into their sources of income.

 The probes had been ordered under the Seminaries Registration (Amendment) Law which requires the Islamic schools to reveal their sources of income.

 Government agencies have launched investigations to check financial sources of at least 32 people and their seminaries across the country, the English-language newspaper Daily Times quoted an official source as saying.

 According to the paper, the seminaries had formed trusts and charities to show the government that they are being run by trusts and not individuals.

 A madarsa manager, who declined to be identified, said the trusts were similar to non-governmental organisations which are eligible for financial aid in Pakistan and abroad.

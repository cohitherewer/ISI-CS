 Osama: Terror trick

 Boston, Nov. 1 (Reuters): A Maine attorney who released information in 2000 about President George W. Bushs drunken driving conviction was arrested yesterday after he dressed up as al Qaida leader Osama bin Laden and waved a fake gun at traffic.

 Police in South Portland, Maine, arrested Thomas Connolly, 49, of Scarborough, Maine, and charged him with criminal threatening. He was released on bail.

 Lieutenant Todd Bernard said the police department received calls about a man wearing West Asian garb and a bin Laden mask and carrying fake dynamite along an inter-state highway. When police arrived, they saw Connolly holding a fake gun. 

 They ordered him to drop the weapon several times and he eventually complied, Bernard said.

 In a phone interview, Connolly said he had been trying to protest a planned change in local tax rules. I didnt expect to be arrested, he said. Obviously I touched a post-9/11 nerve.

 In 2000, Connolly released information about Bushs 1976 drunken driving conviction. 

 The Bush campaign said Democratic dirty tricks were behind the disclosure that at age 30 Bush had been arrested for drunken driving in Kennebunkport, Maine, pleaded guilty, paid a fine and had his licence suspended for 30 days.

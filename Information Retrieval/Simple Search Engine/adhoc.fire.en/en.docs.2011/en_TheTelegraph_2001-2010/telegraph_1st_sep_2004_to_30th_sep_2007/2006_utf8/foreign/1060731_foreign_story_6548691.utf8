 Olmert sad but strikes will go on

 Jerusalem, July 30 (Reuters): Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert today expressed deep sorrow over the bombing of the Lebanese village, but vowed the war against Hizbollah would go on.

 Trying to stem international outrage over the attack on Qana, the Israeli military said it was unaware civilians were sheltering in the buildings it bombed and blamed Hizbollah fighters for using the area to fire rockets at the Jewish state.

 The death toll and the grim television images from the southern Lebanese village have intensified international pressure on Israel to accept an immediate ceasefire.

 I would like to express my deep sorrow at the death of innocent civilians, political sources quoted Olmert as telling cabinet ministers after the air raid. 

 But he said the offensive would continue. We will not blink in front of Hizbollah and we will not stop the offensive despite the difficult circumstances. It is the right thing to do, he said.

 The government promised an investigation into the bloodiest single attack during Israels 19-day-old offensive on Hizbollah.

 Israeli officials quickly went on the defensive. The air force was unaware civilians were in the Qana buildings it bombed, Israels military chief said. A senior air force commander said a precision-guided bomb was dropped on the assumption Hizbollah crews that had fired volleys of missiles into Israel were hiding there.

 Had we known there were that many civilians inside, especially women and children, we certainly would not have attacked it, the commander said.

 The army said it had told civilians to leave Qana days ago. Officials blamed Hizbollah for starting the war by abducting two Israeli soldiers.

 There is not one person whose heart is not crushed when children are killed, justice minister Haim Ramon told the cabinet. But Israel is not the one that spilled the blood of the Lebanese children. Hizbollah is the one that spilled the blood, he said.

 Today was a very sad day... but we must continue pounding Hizbollah, said optometrist Yoram Berger, 51, in Haifa, a frequent Hizbollah rocket target. No one asked if we feel pain. Is it fair that one million Israelis are holed up in shelters fearing for their lives?

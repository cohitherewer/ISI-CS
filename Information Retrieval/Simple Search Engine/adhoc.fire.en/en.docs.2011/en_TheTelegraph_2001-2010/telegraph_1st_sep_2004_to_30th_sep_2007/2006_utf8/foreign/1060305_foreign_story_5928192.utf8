 Castro leads Cuba cricket revolution

 - Bid to move away from baseball

 Despite apparently making an early decision to model his image on W. G. Grace, Fidel Castro did not play cricket as a boy, preferring its poor relation, baseball.

 Che Guevara was a very useful rugby player in his youth, but did not join the cricket club at his university in Buenos Aires.

 In short, when the revolution came to Cuba, cricket and its mollifying influences of Marylebone laws, cucumber sandwiches and linseed oil were not part of the game plan. But all that is about to change, thanks to a sudden realisation on the part of Cubas ruling elite that the Americans do not play cricket.

 Eager to emphasise their Caribbean status and tempt the younger generation away from the Yankee-influenced baseball diamond, the slow-moving Cuban government has embarked on a joint initiative with UK Sport, the current incarnation of the Sports Council, to bring the third man back in from the cold.

 The Cuban government want to be more closely aligned with the Caribbean countries rather than the States and they want to encourage the population to feel they are part of the West Indies rather than the USA, Debbie Lye of UK Sport said yesterday.

 There is a huge potential to be built on there, but obviously it must be done carefully and with sensitivity. It is very promising.

 Its not that the Cubans are new to the game. In the 1920s, an influx of sugar workers from Jamaica and Barbados brought cricket with them to the plantations on the east of Cuba.

 Their teams played in leagues and cup competitions in Santiago de Cuba, Guant?namo and Baragu?. Among the leading lights was a man called Leonard Ford, a Barbajan, whose daughter Leona is the leading light in the sports revival now. She rejoices in the title of president of the Commission of Rescue and Development of Cricket in Cuba, and now enjoys the full support of the state sports ministry.

 She is hoping to recreate the heyday of Cuban cricket in the 1950s when touring teams from Jamaica and other Caribbean countries came to the island. The club meetings were held at my home, and when I was little I used to hear about it a lot, Ford said in a recent interview.

 There were cricket photographs all over the house. But then the revolution came. The clubs were all officially nationalised and like everything else, they became the property of the government.

 And people were... busy. They were moving around. Cricket died out. The last game we have scorecards for was in 1974, between two small local sides. After that, it only existed in one town in the south called Baragu?, where they would play a game once a year on Emancipation Day, August 1 ? the anniversary of the abolition of slavery in the British colonies.

 Having started on a project to write the history of cricket in Cuba, she ended up changing the history of cricket in Cuba.

 After hearing of a speech she had given, Sir Howard Cooke, the governor-general of Jamaica who had led a touring team to Cuba in 1954, persuaded his friend Courtney Walsh, the West Indies leading Test wicket-taker, to lend his name to a campaign to collect old cricket equipment for Cubas nascent teams. 

 In the late 1990s, the game was confined to the traditional east of the island, but it soon spread to Havana, where there are more than 500 players now. 

 In the past couple of years, as gifts of equipment poured in from other cricket-playing nations, the potential for the sport percolated through to the powers that be.

 Michael White, a former British Council chief in Havana, said yesterday: There was initial hesitation from the authorities because it was not an Olympic sport. 

 They are very keen on their sport, but I think they would have been keener on cricket if there had been a chance to trounce the USA at the Olympics as they did at baseball.

 There has been no sighting in the sparse cricket crowds yet of the famous army fatigues and fat cigar of the bearded generalissimo himself, but the time may soon come.

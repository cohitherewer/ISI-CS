 Jessica snub

 Los 

 Angeles, March 16 (Reuters): Concerned about politicising 

 her favourite charity, singer-actor Jessica Simpson yesterday 

 turned down a invitation to meet President George W. Bush, 

 a snub that left Republicans dismayed.

 The apparent final word that Simpson would be a no-show at a major Republican fundraiser with Bush and congressional leaders came after a day of conflicting reports from her camp and organisers of the event. The blond star of the film The Dukes of Hazzard still plans to visit Washington to lobby members of Congress on behalf of Operation Smile, a non-profit venture offering free plastic surgery for disadvantaged children overseas with facial deformities.

 People close to Simpson said she declined a request to appear that same evening at the gala fundraiser of the National Republican Congressional Committee because Operation Smile is a non-partisan group.

 It just feels wrong, one Simpson insider said yesterday, adding that the actor keeps her political views private. She would love to meet the President and talk about Operation Smile ... but she cant do it at a fundraiser for the Republican Party. NRCC spokesman Carl Forti said he was surprised at Simpsons position. Its never been a problem for Bono, he said, referring to the U2 rock star who has met regularly with political leaders of all stripes to promote various causes.

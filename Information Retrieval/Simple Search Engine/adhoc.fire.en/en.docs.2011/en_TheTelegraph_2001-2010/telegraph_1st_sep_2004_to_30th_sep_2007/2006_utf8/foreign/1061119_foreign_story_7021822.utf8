 Wonder Viagra

 Brasilia, Nov. 18 (Reuters): The mayor of a small Brazilian town has begun handing out free Viagra, spicing up the sex lives of dozens of elderly men and their partners.

 Since we started the free distribution of sexual stimulants, our elderly population changed. Theyre much happier, said Joao de Souza Luz, the mayor of Novo Santo Antonio, a small town in the central state of Mato Grosso.

 Souza Luz said 68 men over the age of 60 had already signed up for the programme, which was approved by the towns legislature and has been dubbed Happy Penis, or Pinto Alegre in Portuguese.

 But the programme has also had the unforeseen consequence of encouraging some extra-marital affairs, Souza Luz said. Some of the old men arent seeking out their wives. Theyve got romances on the side, he said.

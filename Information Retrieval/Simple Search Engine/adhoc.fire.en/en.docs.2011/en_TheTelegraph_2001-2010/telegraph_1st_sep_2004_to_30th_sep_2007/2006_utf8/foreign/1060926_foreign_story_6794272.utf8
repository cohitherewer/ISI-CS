 Cop sting on French heroes

 Paris, Sept. 25 (AFP): Victor Hugo was a miserly money-grubber, poet Arthur Rimbaud was a monstrosity and Paul Verlaine was a worthless human being according to Paris police.

 The unflattering portraits of Frances 19th century literary giants are just some of the juicy morsels found in long-forgotten Paris police files recently published in book form.

 Bruno Fuligni, an employee at the French parliament who discovered the dust-covered files and compiled them, says what is even more startling is the vigour and thoroughness with which the most revered writers of that era were spied upon by snitches and secret police.

 Beyond criminals and political figures, there are files on writers and artists. In some, they go quite far in their indiscretions, he said.

 Some of the tidbits in Fulignis book, The Writers Police, were collected from 1879 through 1891 under police chief Louis Andrieux father of one of Frances most famous novelists and poets of the next generation, Louis Aragon. 

 The notes and reports on Hugo, the Les Miserables author and tireless campaigner for social justice who lived in exile for two decades after calling the self-proclaimed emperor Louis Napoleon a traitor, take up three voluminous boxes, Fuligni said.

 The police monitoring the larger-than-life figure overlooked nothing: his ideas, his breaches of conventional morality, the company he kept what Fuligni prefers to see as the little weaknesses of this great genius. 

 Hugo is described in the files as someone who exploits democracy and as being obsessed by money, a trait born out by others.

 What is worrying is not the information itself but the way it is exploited, Fuligni says. 

 The spies who kept tabs on writers and artists at the end of the 19th century were, in effect, their first biographers, and besides the sometimes parochial moral judgements, they came up with some startling insights.

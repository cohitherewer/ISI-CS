 Bangla citadel found

 Wari (Bangladesh), March 15 (Reuters): Archaeologists in Bangladesh say they have uncovered part of a fortified citadel dating back to 450 BC that could have been a stopping off point along an ancient trade route.

 So far, a moat round the citadel has been uncovered along with parts of an ancient road at Wari, 85 km northeast of the capital Dhaka.

 The citadel and a raft of artefacts may help redefine history of India, said Sufi Mostafizur Rahman, head of the department of archaeology at Jahangirnagar University, near Dhaka.

 The well-planned road with even manholes proves that the citadel was managed by a very efficient administration, Mostafizur added.

 I am confident further excavation will lead us to residue of a palace, he said.

 Archaeologists have been excavating the ancient roads and unearthing artefacts for several years. 

 Tests by a Dutch university revealed the objects dated to around 450 BC.

 Artefacts found in the 600 x 600 metre include metal coins, metallic chisels, terracotta missiles, rouletted and knobbed pottery, stone hammers and bangles.

 Ornaments suggested Buddhism dominated life in the urban centres. 

 Mostafizur said the citadel was believed to be a part of Harappan civilisation and a prime trade centre might have flourished there, possibly serving as a link between contemporary South Asian and Roman civilisations.

 The Harappan civilisation flourished in the Indus and Ganges valleys between 2,700 BC to 700 BC.

 Archaeologists hope the citadel and surrounding area yield many more surprises.

 In Wari and the nearby Batteswar village there are 47 raised areas and archaeologists are planning to excavate all of these as well.

 US peace corps

 The American Peace Corps has suspended its operations in Bangladesh for fear of terror attacks, the US embassy said today.

 The announcement came a day after US charge daffaires Judith Chammas commended Bangladesh for its recent capture of top Islamist militants, who headed two outlawed groups fighting for the introduction of sharia law in Bangladesh, a Muslim-majority democracy.

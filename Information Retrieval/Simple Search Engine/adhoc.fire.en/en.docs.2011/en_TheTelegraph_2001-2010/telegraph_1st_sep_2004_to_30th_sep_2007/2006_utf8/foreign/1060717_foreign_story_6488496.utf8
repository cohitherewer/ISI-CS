 Shariat radical spy busts Qaida plot

 TOBY HARNDEN 

 London, July 16: Muslim leaders in Canada have reacted with fury after a radical advocate of Shariat law revealed that he had been a government spy who helped to uncover an alleged al Qaida plot. 

 Mubin Shaikh, 29, came forward to confirm that he was recruited by the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), the countrys equivalent of MI5, and directed a 10-day winter training course in guerrilla tactics. 

 During the course, which Shaikh set up in a field in the remote village of Washago, Ontario, young Muslims allegedly dressed in camouflage, used guns for target practice and taped a video used to recruit others. 

 He said that he was initially asked to befriend the leader of a cell of 17 Muslims who allegedly planned to blow up the parliament building in Ottawa and Torontos stock exchange. The 17, arrested in June, face terrorism charges. Some of the arrested traced their roots to the subcontinent.

 This is like the pot calling the kettle black, said Tarek Fatah, of the Canadian Muslim Congress. He was the embodiment of extremism in the city and his spying calls into question whether hes acting out of sincerity, or is trying to fish himself out of his own troubles. 

 Aly Hindy, imam of the Salahuddin Islamic Centre in Scarborough, attended by some of the suspects, said Shaikh and Canadian intelligence had encouraged and entrapped young Muslims. The government and the people keep saying that we should not make our young people radical. CSIS is the one radicalising the youth. I call him CSIS Shaikh. 

 But Shaikh, who has declined an offer to enter Canadas witness protection scheme, is unrepentant, calling the suspects dangerous fruitcakes who deserved to be jailed. 

 The self-professed fundamentalist supports holy war in Iraq and Afghanistan but not in Canada. I wanted to prevent the loss of life. There are no combatants on the downtown streets of Toronto, he said. 

 Nada Farooq, the wife of Zakaria Amara, one of the accused, said: I know this man. May Allah curse him and make him suffer.

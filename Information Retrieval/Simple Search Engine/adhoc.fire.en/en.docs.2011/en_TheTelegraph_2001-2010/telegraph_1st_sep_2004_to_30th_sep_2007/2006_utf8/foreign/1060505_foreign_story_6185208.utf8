 Picasso painting sets record, sells for $95 m

 New York, May 4 (Reuters): Picassos 1941 portrait of his mistress, Dora Maar with Cat, sold for an astounding $95 million at Sothebys yesterday, becoming the second most expensive painting in auction history.

 The vibrant, large-scale work depicts Maar, the surrealist photographer Picasso was romantically involved with for a decade, seated in a chair with a small cat perched on the back. It had been expected to sell for upwards of $40 million, but the winning bid of $95,216,000, including commission, caught even Sothebys officials by surprise.

 I was hoping for 70-plus, said David Norman, Sothebys co-chair of Impressionist and Modern Art, after the sale.We thought it was worth more, and we were right.

 Even Tobias Meyer, the usually unflappable auctioneer, admitted he was surprised when the bidding passed $65 million. 

 The energy in the room was incredible, he said. Theres just a very clear, strong demand for the kind of intense painting with an emotional pull that the Picasso represents; things that are made for our times,

 Given a less-than robust economy, Norman said he was surprised, thrilled and grateful, at the sales result but I wasnt expecting a poor sale. We knew theres a tremendous pool of money out there, he said.

 Overweight man sues Air France over fat slur

 Paris, Dec. 20 (Reuters): An overweight passenger has sued Air France after being told he was too fat and had to pay for a second seat to accommodate his bulk.

 Jean-Jacques Jauffret, a French scriptwriter, said today he had felt humiliated by Air France staff who had measured his waist in public at New Delhi airport in 2005 and decided he was too big for a single seat. A lawyer representing Air France told a court yesterday the company had a clear policy of asking obese passengers to pay for two seats. Lets be objective. This man is fat, lawyer Fernand Gamault told the court in Bobigny, according to Le Parisien newspaper.

 He barely fits on the courtroom chair. How could he sit in an airplane? Gamault was not available for comment but Jauffret confirmed the lawyers comments and said he was denounced as fat and enormous on countless occasions during the hearing.

 I felt shocked and humiliated by what he said, Jauffret added. Jauffret said he weighed more than 160 kg and said he had flown numerous times, including on other Air France flights, without ever being asked to pay more.

 Bush push for unified response

 Washington, July 6 (Reuters): President George W. Bush pushed today to get a united international response to North Korea after the reclusive state launched a barrage of missiles in defiance of repeated warnings.

 After speaking to the leaders of China, Russia, Japan and South Korea, Bush said allies needed to speak with one voice over North Korea.

 But Bush gave no sign that differences with Russia and China over a UN Security Council resolution demanding nations halt funds and technology for Pyongyangs missile programme had been resolved.

 My message was that we want to solve this problem diplomatically, and the best way to solve the problem diplomatically is for all of us to be working in concert and to send one message, and that is ? to Kim Jong Il ? that, we expect you to adhere to international norms, and we expect you to keep your word, Bush said.

 It is in our interests that we send a clear message to the leaders of North Korea, he said at a news conference with Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper.

 Outrage over advice against career women

 ROYA NIKKHAH 

 Not the right girl? 

 London, Aug. 27: For any man who wants to be successful and happy, a warning: do not, whatever you do, marry a career woman. 

 Instead, find yourself a wife who has no desires other than dusting the house and doing the school run. 

 Marry pretty women or ugly ones, short ones or tall ones, blondes or brunettes, just, whatever you do, dont marry a woman with a career. 

 That advice, from a senior editor at one of the worlds leading business magazine groups, has sparked outrage on both sides of the Atlantic since it first emerged early last week. 

 In his piece, entitled Dont Marry Career Women, Michael Noer, the news editor of Forbes.com, the online version of the American magazine, advised his male readers to steer clear of ambitious women or face a life of misery and discord. 

 Noer outlined the pitfalls men face if they defy his advice. 

 He bases his theory on recent studies, which say career women are more likely to be unfaithful, file for divorce and want fewer children than their homely, unambitious counterparts. 

 Since the article was published last week, critics have described its author as a pathetic loser and his views as downright frightening. 

 His advice might seem to be borne out in part by the experience of Nicola Horlick, the high-flying city investment banker, nicknamed Superwoman for juggling her 1 million job and family of five, whose 19-year marriage ended as her career blossomed. 

 Despite her divorce, Horlick, 46, is adamant that women should not just sit at home to keep their husbands happy. 

 Maybe you cant necessarily have a happy marriage if you end up being a very high-powered woman, she said. It may be that men find it difficult living with a woman whos forging ahead. 

 But would I have wanted to sit around at home just doing the school run? I dont think I could take that. 

 However, women need not fly so high as Horlick to attract Noers disapproval. 

 He describes a career-girl as a woman who has a university degree, works more than 35 hours a week outside the home and earns more than 16,000 a year. 

 If the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings a report from the Office of National Statistics published last week is to be believed, that would include clergywomen, librarians and dressmakers. 

 Within hours of posting the piece on its website, Forbes was inundated with complaints and forced to withdraw it. 

 But as interest in Noers views increased, the magazine reposted the story with an accompanying response from Elizabeth Corcoran, another Forbes writer. 

 In her piece, entitled Dont Marry A Lazy Man, Corcoran, a career woman with two children and a husband of 18 years, described her colleagues opinions as downright frightening. 

 Last night, Carole Stone, a successful career woman married for seven years, described Noers article as absolutely pathetic. 

 Stone, 64, an author and broadcaster, who is married to Richard Lindley, the television journalist, said: I have been a career woman for 46 years and am happily married and I can tell Mr Noer he is completely wrong, she said. 

 Clearly he doesnt have much confidence in himself if he thinks he can only be a winner if the woman he is with is the loser in the career stakes. 

 My husband said that I boosted his self-esteem when we married. The essence of any successful relationship is to have a satisfied partner, and a woman at home bored and unfulfilled is more likely to cause trouble than one with an interesting career.

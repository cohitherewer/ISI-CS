 Damages for high sex drive

 LEE GLENDINNING

 London, Dec. 19: A man who was knocked on the head at work prompting his libido to spiral out of control has been awarded 3.1 million in damages in the high court.

 Stephen Tame, 29, of Wickford in Essex, fell from a gantry while working in a cycle warehouse in January 2002. While he made a remarkable neurological recovery after two years of treatment he became sexually disinhibited, to the detriment of his marriage, the court heard.

 His wife of eight months, Sarah, 30, has had to spend nights away from him to get some respite, and he had begun using pornography, ringing sex lines and visiting a prostitute.

 Sarah Tame was also shocked to find that he had been unfaithful to her, with a 57-year-old woman who attended the same church. She is now receiving treatment for clinical depression and broke down while giving evidence.

 We love each other but the love is slowly going, she told the court. We love each other but its not in love. I love Steve but its turning into friendship. Sarah Tame said her husbands carers had advised her to sleep in a separate bed to avoid encouraging his high sex drive.

 Asked by the defence whether she 

 had separated from Tame to increase the value of the compensation 

 claim, she said: That was never my intention in leaving. 

 I was becoming mentally ill because of the whole issue of 

 the accident.

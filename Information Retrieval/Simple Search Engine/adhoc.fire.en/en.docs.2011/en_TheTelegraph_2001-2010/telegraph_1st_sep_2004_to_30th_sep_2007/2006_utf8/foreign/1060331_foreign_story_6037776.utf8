 Car for horses

 Almaty (Kazakhstan), March 30 (Reuters): A Kazakh farmer is offering a brand-new Japanese sport utility vehicle as a reward for his missing herd of horses, media reported today.

 Zhansap Alzhanovs 45 horses went missing two years ago and he has been trying to find them ever since, state news agency Kazinform reported. He still believes they can be found, the agency said, adding that he thought they had been stolen. 

 Horse breeding is an integral part of life for many farmers in the vast steppes of the Central Asian country.

 Havana, Aug. 3 (Reuters): President George W. Bush called on Cubans yesterday to work for democratic change but the state media said today Raul Castro had firm control of the communist-ruled island while his brother Fidel was in hospital.

 We will support you in your effort to build a transitional government in Cuba committed to democracy and we will take note of those, in the current Cuban regime, who obstruct your desire for a free Cuba, Bush said.

 However, the party mouthpiece, Granma, rejected Bushs call, saying the situation in Cuba was totally calm. Raul is firmly at the helm of the nation and the armed forces, Granma said, dismissing Bushs statement as unacceptable.

 Bushs comments were Bushs first public declaration on Cuba since Fidel Castro ceded power on Monday temporarily to younger brother Raul Castro because of surgery for gastrointestinal bleeding.

 The Communist Party made plain yesterday it intended to remain in control no matter what happened to Fidel Castro. However, there was still no public appearance by Raul Castro.

 The only sign of the younger Castro was a photo on Granmas front page of his arrest at age 22 following the near-suicidal assault led by his brother on the Moncada garrison in Santiago in 1953.

 Some analysts saw this as a tactic to build up his image before any further moves. Cubas leaders may feel that if Raul Castro appeared too early it might touch off panic among Cubans after so many years under Fidel, they said.

 The silence and secrecy helped feed the feeling among some Cubans that the Fidel Castro era may be ending.

 The Bush administration had already dismissed the possibility of warming relations with a government led by Raul Castro, but Bushs comments went a step further. I urge the Cuban people to work for democratic change on the island, he said.

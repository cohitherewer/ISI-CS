 Havana, Sept. 5 (Reuters): Cuban leader Fidel Castro said he has put the worst of his health crisis behind him and will be able to receive foreign dignitaries in private during a summit of developing nations next week.

 But the Left-wing firebrand said in a statement published today that a full recovery from the undisclosed illness that forced him to turn over power to his brother will take a long time. Castro, 80, said he lost 18.6 kg in a few days after undergoing surgery to stop intestinal bleeding caused by an unexpected health problem on July 26.

 One can say that the most critical moment is behind us. Today, I am recovering at a satisfactory pace, he said in a message to the Cuban people published by the ruling Communist Party newspaper Granma on its website (granma.cubaweb.cu).

 Shopping? Trust your gut instinct

 London, Feb. 17: Scientists have discovered that the best way to make a decision is to collect the information you need, forget about it, and then trust your instincts to get it right. 

 This advice comes from a study by researchers at the University of Amsterdam that focused on how people make shopping decisions.

 Decisions can be grouped into two basic categories: complex decisions, such as buying a house or a car, and simple decisions, such as choosing a shampoo. Most people would agonise over the former and scarcely think about the latter, which is precisely the wrong way to do it, Prof. Dijksterhuis said in the Science journal.

 He added: Your brain is capable of juggling lots of facts and possibilities at the same time when you let it work without thinking about the decision. But when you are specifically thinking about a problem, your brain isnt able to weigh up as much information. I sit on things and rely on my gut.

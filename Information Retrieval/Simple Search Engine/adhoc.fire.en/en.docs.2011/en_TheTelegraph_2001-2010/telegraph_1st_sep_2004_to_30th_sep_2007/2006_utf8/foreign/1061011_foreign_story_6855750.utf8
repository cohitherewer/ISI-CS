 Woman uses baby as weapon

 Erie (Pennsylvania), Oct. 10 (AP): An American woman accused of using her baby to batter her boyfriend said she didnt realise what she was doing until it was too late.

 Chyrotia Graham, 27, of Erie, Pennsylvania, told police she had been drinking when an argument with her husband, the childs father, turned violent early on Sunday morning, according to an affidavit filed to support Grahams arrest.

 Graham said she snapped and began grabbing things and throwing them at Deangelo Troop, 20, not realising she had picked up her four-week-old son, Jarron Troop, who police said she held by the legs and swung at his father.

 Graham was being held at a jail yesterday on $75,000 bond. She faces charges of aggravated assault, reckless endangerment and simple assault. Jarron, who was born on September 11, suffered a fractured skull and bleeding in the brain after the incident. The infants head hit Deangelo, who had also fathered one of Grahams other four children.

 Deangelo told the Erie Times-News that Graham never meant to hurt their child. People are trying to make a big deal about it.

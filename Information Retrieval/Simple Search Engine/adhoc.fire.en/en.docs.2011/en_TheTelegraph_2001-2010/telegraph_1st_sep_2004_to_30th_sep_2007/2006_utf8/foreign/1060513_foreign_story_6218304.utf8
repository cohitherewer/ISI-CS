 Fresh Iran uranium traces found

 Berlin, May 12 (Reuters): UN inspectors have discovered new traces of very highly enriched uranium on nuclear equipment in Iran, deepening suspicions Tehran may still be concealing the full extent of its atomic enrichment programme, diplomats said.

 In its April report to the UN Security Council, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said it took samples from equipment that had been acquired by a former research centre at Lavizan-Shiya. The centre was razed in 2004 before inspectors could examine it.

 The IAEA inspectors took swabs from vacuum pumps earlier this year which were subjected to microscopic particle analysis, diplomats said. 

 Preliminary analysis by the IAEA showed traces of highly enriched uranium in the (pump) samples, a western diplomat said.

 Pope salve

 Vatican City, Sept. 20 (Reuters): Pope Benedict said today that his use of medieval quotes portraying a violent Islam did not reflect his views and were misunderstood, but he did not give the clear apology still demanded by many Muslims.

 The leader of the worlds 1.1 billion Roman Catholics, whose speech last week has provoked al Qaida groups to declare war on the Church, Iraqis to burn the Popes effigy and Turks to petition for his arrest, said he had not meant to cause offence. Speaking amid tighter security at his weekly general audience in St Peters Square, the Pope repeated the thrust of remarks made on Sunday that his words had been misunderstood. He expressed his profound respect for Muslims

 Even sympathetic observers say the Pope was clumsy to quote 14th century Byzantine Emperor Manuel II Palaeologus saying that everything the Prophet Mohammad brought was evil, such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached.

 But the Pope, a former theology professor, invited his listeners to re-read his text. For the careful reader of my text it is clear that I in no way wanted to make mine the negative words pronounced by the medieval emperor and their polemical content does not reflect my personal conviction, he said.

 He added: My intention was very different. I wanted to explain that religion and violence do not go together but religion and reason do. The Pope said he hoped the furore would eventually help encourage positive and even self-critical dialogue, both among religions as well as between modern reason and the Christian faith.

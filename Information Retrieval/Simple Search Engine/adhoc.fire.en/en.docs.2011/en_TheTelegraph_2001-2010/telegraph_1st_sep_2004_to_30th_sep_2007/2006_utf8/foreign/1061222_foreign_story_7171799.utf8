 London, Dec. 21 (Reuters): Thousands of passengers were stranded today as heavy fog in southern England grounded hundreds of flights during one of the busiest travel periods of the year.

 About 500 people spent the night at Londons Heathrow after British Airways cancelled all domestic and some European flights to and from the airport due to poor visibility. 

 Forecasters predicted the fog would get worse and could stay for the next 48 hours at least. At the peak time tomorrow 194,000 travellers, 30,000 more than a normal day, are set to pass through Heathrow.

 Airport operator BAA, which was bought by Spains Ferrovial earlier this year, warned of overcrowding and delays for people trying to visit families for Christmas, or flying off for winter holidays. At least 350 out of 1,300 flights at Heathrow were grounded. 

 Heathrow, the worlds busiest international airport, was shrouded in thick fog for a second day, prompting air traffic controllers to impose tight restrictions on flights.

 Passengers queued in the cold outside terminal buildings to find out if their flight would leave.

 NHS worker David Page, 43, from Derby, said his holiday plans were ruined after his flight to the Canary Island was grounded. Christmas has been cancelled, he said. Ill be spending a quiet Christmas in Derbyshire rather than on a beach in Gran Canaria.

 Student Rob Evans, 23, flying with Lufthansa from Calgary to Hamburg, said he had spent the night on the floor waiting for a flight. I am too tired to be angry, he said. It felt like the worst sleepover ever.

 Another passenger, Gianluca Longhi, 24, said his flight to Milan had been cancelled.

 It looks like I will be spending Christmas in London, the student said. I feel I will be stranded here indefinitely. 

 Car hire firms at Heathrow terminal one said they were running out of cars as people looked for other ways to travel.

 All of our 350 cars were snapped up this morning, a Hertz spokesman said. Nat-ional Alamo said it had no more cars at terminal one.

 Hotels said bookings were up by nearly a third.

 The airports managing director Mark Bullock urged passengers to check with airlines before going to the airport. It is very, very unfortunate that passengers are unable to travel, especially at this time of year, he told BBC radio. 

 Flights were cancelled at other British airports, including 30 in Scotland, as the disruption spread. Transport secretary Douglas Alexander said airlines must ensure they have enough staff to keep passengers informed through call centres or websites.

 I would strongly urge them ... to take the necessary action both to get people in the air if they can, but if not, to make the right arrangements to make sure that there is the least inconvenience possible, he told the BBC. 

 Theres always going to be a risk of fog over the next few days, the London Met office said.

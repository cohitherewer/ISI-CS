 Malay whips

 Kuala Lumpur, Dec. 5 (AFP): Malaysian lawmakers have called for foreign prostitutes to be whipped as a deterrent to others considering coming here to work in the sex industry, a report said today. 

 Mohamed Aziz from the National Front coalition said he had met a transvestite from Brunei who said he moved to Malaysia because the rules here were more lenient. 

 If we can impose whipping for drug addicts, why cant we do the same for prostitutes, he said in a proposal that was supported by at least one other lawmaker.

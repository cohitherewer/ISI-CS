 Japan to withdraw Iraq troops

 Tokyo, June 20 (Reuters): Japan has decided to withdraw its troops from Iraq, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi said today, bringing to an end the Japanese militarys riskiest and most ambitious overseas mission since World War II.

 Tokyo has kept about 550 ground troops in Samawa, southern Iraq, since February 2004 on a non-combat mission.

 The decision comes a day after Iraqs Prime Minister said his forces planned to take over security in the southern province of Muthanna, where the British oversee a multinational contingent that includes Japanese troops.

 Japans troop dispatch ? a symbol of Tokyos willingness to put boots on the ground for its close ally, the US ? won praise from Washington but was opposed by many at home.

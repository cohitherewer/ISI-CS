 Business tips from Flirt Guru

 ADAM LUSHER 

 Michael Douglas and Demi Moore in Disclosure: Whos afraid of flirting in office?

 London, Feb. 12: Wearing a low-cut dress, fishnet stockings and a broad grin, Elizabeth Clark leans towards her (mostly male) audience. Her voice is low, husky. Embrace the bosoms! she breathes. Compliment the breasts! 

 This isnt quite what one expected from a meeting of the Association of Alliance Managers (the professional body for executives with relationship management responsibility for joint sales, marketing and delivery.) 

 Clark and her fishnets, however, embody a radical,possibly revolutionary ? certainly fearless ? departure in business management. She is the Flirt Guru. 

 Struggling against the forces of political correctness and sexual harassment lawsuits, Clark has come to a seminar room in central London to teach alliance managers the art of flirting. 

 She seeks to crusade against the dreadful, sterile atmosphere in our litigation-conscious offices, to give us back the gift of banter ? the grease that gets things going, that seals deals and gets you a promotion. 

 Individual tuition costs about ?2,000 for four hours. She is getting takers. Men in their 30s have huge problems, she says when she arrives. They have good jobs but are working too hard to go out socialising. They find human resources departments warning them, that is politically incorrect, illegal. In the end they abstain from any kind of banter at all. 

 Then they hit the level where they want to be made partner and find themsel- ves rejected because they are dull with no interpersonal skills. 

 Clark leans forward, hands me her card. Now, its face to face: up close and personal. I cant help noticing her business card features a photograph of a womans bottom, in a G-string. 

 Clark asks the women ? about 10 in the audience ?what they like in a man. 

 She reminds the 40 men what they like in a woman. You cant help it. You like breasts. There. Its in the open. Gentlemen, we have a breast etiquette issue.

 Which is where bosom embracing comes in. Furtive glances and ogling are unhelpful, apparently, but so is abject terror. Hence the idea of complimenting the breasts. 

 In the interests of professionalism, and a low-cut dress,it must be asked: Clark, how exactly does one embrace the bosoms (without getting sacked)? 

 She invites me to compliment her on her necklace. 

 Judging by the number of compliments for Clarks necklace, some alliance managers paid attention.

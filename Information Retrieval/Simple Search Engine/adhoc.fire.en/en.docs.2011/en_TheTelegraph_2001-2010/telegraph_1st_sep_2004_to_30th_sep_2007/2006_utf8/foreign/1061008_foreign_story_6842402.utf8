The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 British newspapers back minister

 London, Oct. 7 (AFP): british newspapers today backed Jack Straw embroiled in a political storm sparked by his views on the problems posed by Muslim women wearing a veil. 

 Several dailies turned their editorials to the nationwide debate. It is perhaps understandable if Muslims feel under siege at the moment, said The Sun tabloid. That is the unhappy consequence of Islamic extremists bringing terror and death to the UK.

 The Times newspaper said community relations might be improved by genuine face-to-face contact, adding that the veil precludes a basic form of human contact in a way which the Sikh turban or the Buddhist robe does not.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 No Cup bar on Iran leader

 Bad Boll (Germany), April 8 (Reuters): Iran President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad would be welcome in Germany to cheer on his team at the World Cup but he would be taken to task for his anti-Israel comments, a German minister said today.

 Naturally he can come to the matches, interior minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said.

 It wont be a simple matter because of the things that he has said in the past that are simply unacceptable. But my advice is we should be good hosts. We want to be better.

 But I will certainly have a talk with him about the remarks he made, said Schaeuble during a podium discussion about the role of Germanys soccer federation (DFB) during the Nazi era.

 The head of the Iran soccer federation said this week that his President, a keen soccer fan, was considering coming to Germany for the tournament which starts on June 9.

 Ahmadinejad has been criticised in Germany and around the world for inflammatory remarks about Israel, saying the country should be wiped off the map and questioning whether six million Jews were killed by the Nazis in the Holocaust.

 Holocaust denial is a serious crime punishable with a prison term of up to five years in Germany.

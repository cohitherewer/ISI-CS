 Scorpion hope for cancer cure

 Washington, July 29 (Reuters): Doctors seeking treatments for malignant brain tumours have found promise in the venom of scorpions, according to a study released yesterday.

 The study showed that a synthetic version of a protein found in the venom of giant yellow Israeli scorpions targeted tumour cells but did not harm the healthy cells of brain cancer patients.

 Were testing a new agent that has a lot of potential for patients who have had no meaningful treatments thus far, said Dr Adam Mamelak, lead author on an article to appear in the August issue of the Journal of Clinical Oncology.

 In the study, 18 patients first had surgery to remove malignant gliomas, a lethal kind of brain tumour. Then doctors injected their brains with a solution of radioactive iodine and TM-601, the synthetic protein.

 The solution bound almost exclusively to leftover tumour cells, suggesting that it could be combined with chemotherapy to fight cancer. Two study patients were still alive nearly three years after the treatment. Because life expectancy for the 14,000 annual glioma patients in the US is typically a matter of months, the results indicate that the venom protein may inhibit tumour growth.

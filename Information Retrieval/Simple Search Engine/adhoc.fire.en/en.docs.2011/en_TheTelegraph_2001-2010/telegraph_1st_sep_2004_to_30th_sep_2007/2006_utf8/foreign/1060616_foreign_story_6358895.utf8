The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 After tease, Bush sorry

 Washington, June 15 (PTI): President George W. Bush, known to needle reporters at press conferences, inadverdently went a little too far when he teased a Los Angeles Times journalist for wearing sunglasses even on a cloudy day, not knowing that he had a vision loss disorder. However, the President later apologised to the scribe. 

 At a Rose Garden event yesterday, Bush called on the reporter Peter Wallsten and asked him if he was going to continue asking questions with his shades on.

 For the viewers theres no sun, Bush said, little realising that Wallsten has the Stargardts disease that makes the eyes extremely sensitive to glaring light, even if the weather is cloudy. 

 Later, Bush called Wallsten on his cellphone and apologised saying that he did not know he had a vision disease. Wallsten said no apology was needed because he did not feel offended since no one at the White House had been told of his condition. I needle you guys out of affection, Bush told Wallsten who, in turn, said he did not wanted to be treated any differently because of the disorder.

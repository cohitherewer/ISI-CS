 33 face flu quarantine

 Jakarta, May 25 (Reuters): Health experts have asked 33 people in a remote Indonesian village to quarantine themselves at home after the H5N1 bird flu virus killed as many as seven members of a family there earlier this month.

 Epidemiologists have failed to track down the source of infection in Kubu Simbelang village in north Sumatra and the WHO said this week limited human-to-human transmission between family members might have occurred.

 There are 33 people identified as close contacts. Weve asked them to observe home quarantine. Thats something they are willing to do to protect themselves, said Dick Thompson, WHO spokesman.

 In a separate development, local tests have confirmed an Indonesian child from the city of Bandung died of bird flu, a senior health ministry official said today. Local results on bird flu cases are not considered definitive and need confirmation from the WHO.

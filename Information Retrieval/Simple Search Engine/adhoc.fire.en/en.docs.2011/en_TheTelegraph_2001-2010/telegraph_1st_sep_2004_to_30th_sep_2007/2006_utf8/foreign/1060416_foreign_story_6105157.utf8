 Sikh in Pak army cadets parade

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Islamabad, April 15: The Sikh turban of Hercharn Singh, the first Pakistani Sikh who will be commissioned in the army in 2007, was the centre of attention at the Pakistan Military Academy parade ground in Kakul, North West Frontier Province.

 Singh matched the steps of the graduating cadets as they marched past the saluting dais for the last time at the academy today before getting commission as second lieutenants.

 Traditionally, junior cadets in the academy join their graduating colleagues in the parade on the passing-out day. Singh is in the second term of the academys Long Course-116, which is set to graduate in October 2007.

 I am proud to be a Pakistani and to join the Pakistan army, Singh said after meeting Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz, who was the chief guest at the parade.

 The military academy is the prime training institution of the Pakistan army, which was set up by the British rulers before the Partition. 

 Born in the mid-1980s in Pakistans Nankana Sahib, the birthplace of Guru Nanak, Singh said his selection in the army has come came as an encouragement for his friends and relatives, who are now also eager to joint the Pakistani armed forces. I would like to see more people from my community here, Singh said.

 Non-Muslim minorities make 3 per cent of Pakistans roughly 155-million population, consisting mostly of Sunnis. Minorities representation in the armed forces is low and only a few Christian officers and soldiers are serving in the forces.

 Last year, Justice Rana Bhagwandas had become the first Hindu to take over as chief justice of Pakistans Supreme Court. As the seniormost judge of the court, he acted as the chief justice in absence of the incumbent, Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, who was on a foreign visit.

 China critic gets rare pardon

 Gao: Reprieve

 Beijing, Dec. 22 (Reuters): In a rare display of official tolerance, outspoken Chinese human rights lawyer Gao Zhisheng was sentenced to three years in prison for subversion but execution of his sentence was suspended, meaning he could walk free.

 Gao, 42, was given a five-year reprieve, the official Xinhua news agency said today, quoting sources with a local court. That meant he does not have to serve his sentence unless he commits another crime over the next five years.

 The court showed leniency because Gao voluntarily reported other peoples offences and provided important clues to crack other cases, Xinhua said. Earlier this year, Zhao Yan, a Chinese researcher for the New York Times, was sentenced to 3 years in prison.

 Maoist ambush 

 Kathmandu, Feb. 27 (Reuters): Dozens of Maoist rebels ambushed an army patrol in eastern Nepal today and shot dead at least three soldiers, an army officer said.

 One civilian was also killed in the incident at Kavre district, 80 km east of Kathmandu, the officer said without elaborating. He had earlier said the civilian died in crossfire.

 In a separate attack in Pokhara, 200 km west of Kathmandu, 11 civilians were wounded after suspected rebels set off a bomb in a busy market place, police said.

 Residents reached by telephone said the bomb went off on a footpath and the victims were pedestrians and fruit or vegetable sellers. It was a deafening explosion, local journalist Rajendra Adhikary said. Police said the rebels had unsuccessfully targeted an army truck. There was no comment from the Maoists on the blast, the second to rock the resort town of Pokhara.

 Germany, Poland in potato war

 TONY PATERSON 

 Kaczynski: Potato? 

 Berlin, July 16: A satirical German newspapers mocking description of Polands President Lech Kaczynski as a potato has triggered a diplomatic row. 

 The article further claimed that his knowledge of Germany was limited to the lavatories at Frankfurt airport. 

 In response, the 57-year-old President has demanded an apology from Chancellor Angela Merkels government, while late last week, Polands nationalist Roman Catholic press, which shares many of his views, took up the cudgels on his behalf. 

 It published a hate list of German media correspondents who, it said, had been allowed to insult Poland with impunity. 

 The potato war, as the German media has dubbed the dispute, has prompted the Polish government to consider banning an Internet site that publishes foreign press articles critical of the Warsaw government. 

 The intensity of the dispute has shocked the German government. Officials refuse to discuss the Polish complaints, but privately they have described the row as risible and unworthy of a European Union member state. They accuse Kaczynski, and his twin brother, Jaroslaw, who was sworn in on Friday as the countrys new Prime Minister, of having a problem with the principles of press freedom. 

 Under the headline Polands new potato, a columnist in the Left-wing daily, Tageszeitung, lampooned the Polish President for his well-known aversion to Germany, and claimed that his knowledge of the country was confined to the spittoon in the mens lavatory at Frankfurt airport. 

 It also made fun of his brother, and expressed mock dismay that the staunchly Catholic, unmarried politician lived with his mother without a marriage certificate. 

 Kaczynski was reportedly so infuriated by the jibes that he cancelled a meeting with Merkel, and the French President, Jacques Chirac, saying that he had a bad cold. 

 The dispute is the latest spat between Berlin and Warsaw to have erupted since President Kaczynskis election last year. The two states have been at loggerheads over the planned Russian-German Baltic gas pipeline, which bypasses Poland. 

 There is a further dispute over German plans for a permanent exhibition commemorating the plight of refugees expelled from what is now Poland after the World War II. 

 In Poland, the potato war has been described by some senior politicians as trivial, while Polands ambassador to Germany, attacked his own government for its exaggerated reaction. 

 In what appeared to be an effort to defuse the Polish-German crisis, Merkel telephoned Kaczynski late last week. An official account of their discussion claimed despite recent differences, both sides were intent on furthering good relations. There was no mention of any vegetables.

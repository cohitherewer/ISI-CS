 London for love

 London, Feb. 14 (Reuters): Shop tills in the city of London rang out for love today as bankers brimming with bonus money splurged on Valentine chocolates, champagne and lingerie.

 Some luxury shops in Londons financial districts, collectively referred to as the City, prepared themselves by hiring security to help keep the peace among young, hard-driving city types renowned for their exuberance.

 Upmarket Feltons Flowers said a queue of people eager to pay prices upwards of ?225 ($391.2) for the finest in flowers stretched out the door. Luxury chocolate shop Ackermanns was busiest on Monday and has already sold out of its most expensive item, a pink satin box of chocolates, priced at ?65.

 Rose bids

 Aalsmeer, Netherlands (Reuters): Love 

 was in the air on Tuesday as Dutch traders at the worlds 

 largest flower market bid for millions of Valentines 

 Day roses guaranteed to make hearts flutter from New York 

 to Sydney. Well sell around 50 million roses 

 this week, said Adrienne Lansbergen, spokeswoman for 

 the Aalsmeer auction.

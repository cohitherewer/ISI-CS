 Thin crack found in shuttle insulation

 Cape Canaveral (Florida), July 3 (Reuters): A pencil-sized crack in the foam insulation on space shuttle Discoverys external tank sent Nasa experts into meetings today to determine whether to go ahead with tomorrows scheduled launch.

 At about 12.7 cm by 1 cm, the crack is small compared with the briefcase-sized chunk of foam that doomed shuttle Columbia in 2003, but it is located in an area of the tank that could shed debris onto the shuttle at launch.

 Nasa scheduled an afternoon news conference to announce its plans for tomorrows scheduled Fourth of July launch.

 Discoverys launch already has been delayed twice during the weekend, largely because of unfavourable weather at Cape Canaveral. The launch window extends until July 19 so any repairs would need to be made by then.

 Falling foam has bedeviled the space shuttle programme since the February 1, 2003, Columbia accident, in which debris shed from the external tank at liftoff damaged the spaceships left wing, opening a breach that let in superheated gas during re-entry. The vessel ripped apart, killing all seven crew.

 A year ago, foam insulation again fell from Discoverys tank on launch, causing no damage but prompting Nasa to ground the shuttle fleet to make more modifications.

 Marion LaNasa, a spokesman for Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company, which makes the external tanks, declined to say how long any possible repair might take.

 LaNasa said repairs would not necessarily require that the shuttle be rolled back into the massive Vehicle Assembly Building, a process that could take two weeks. It is not rare to repair damage on the pad, LaNasa said.

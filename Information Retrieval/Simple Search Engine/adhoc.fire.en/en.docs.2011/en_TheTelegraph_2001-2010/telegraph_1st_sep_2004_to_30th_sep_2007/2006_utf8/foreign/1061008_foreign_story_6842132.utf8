 Russia war critic killed

 Politkovskaya: Tragic 

Moscow, Oct. 7 (Reuters): Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya, an outspoken critic of war in rebel Chechnya, was shot dead today at her apartment block in central Moscow.

 Politkovskaya, a mother of two, was well-known for exposing rights abuses by Russian troops and remained critical of Moscows campaign despite intense government pressure. 

 The first thing that comes to mind is that Anna was killed for her professional activities. We dont see any other motive for this terrible crime, said Vitaly Yaroshevsky, deputy editor of Novaya Gazeta, the newspaper where Politkovskaya worked.

 Yaroshevsky said that sources in the police and Politkovskayas own son had both confirmed her death.

 Chechnya has always been her main subject, he said. Everything she wrote was on the edge. Novaya Gazeta is known for being critical of the Kremlin.

 Politkovskayas war reporting often meant she was under scrutiny by Russian politicians and, sometimes, the security services. She had been arrested.

 Interfax news agency quoted police sources as saying her body was discovered in a lift by a neighbour at 5.10 pm. Police officers found a pistol and four rounds abandoned in the lift, it reported. Police had cordoned off the scene outside her apartment block.

 Journalists rights groups condemned the killing. She was an intrepid and brave reporter who repeatedly risked her life to report the news from that region. Its a devastating development for journalism in Russia, said Abi Wright, spokeswoman for the Committee to Protect Journalists.

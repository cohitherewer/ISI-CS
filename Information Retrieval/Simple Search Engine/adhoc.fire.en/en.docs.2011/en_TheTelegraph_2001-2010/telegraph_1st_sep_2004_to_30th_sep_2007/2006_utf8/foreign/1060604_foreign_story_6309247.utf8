 Russian diplomat shot dead

 Baghdad, June 3 (Reuters): Gunmen killed one Russian embassy employee and kidnapped four others in Baghdad today, Russian and Iraqi officials said, in the latest attack on foreigners in the lawless capital.

 A car bomb in the southern city of Basra killed at least 27 people, hospital sources said, three days after new Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki announced a security crackdown there.

 The violence was yet another reminder of the challenges that Maliki, a tough-talking Shia Islamist, faces in delivering on his pledge to restore stability in Iraq.

 Key to that will be the naming of non-sectarian interior and defence ministers who can quell communal and insurgent violence, after the two jobs remained empty because of wrangling when Malikis government took office two weeks ago.

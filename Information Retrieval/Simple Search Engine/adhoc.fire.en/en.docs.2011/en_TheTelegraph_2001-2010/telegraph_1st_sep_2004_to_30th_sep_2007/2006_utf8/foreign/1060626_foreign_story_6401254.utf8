 Drunk pelican

 Los Angeles, June 25 (Reuters): Four pelicans suspected of being drunk on sea algae were being tested at a Southern California wildlife centre yesterday after one of them crashed headlong into a car.

 Three of the California brown pelicans were found wandering dazed in the streets of Laguna Beach after another pelican struck a vehicles windshield. The Wildlife Care Center said the seabirds may have been under the influence of algae in the ocean that can produce domoic acid poisoning when eaten. 

 Dance row 

 Hong Kong (AFP): With its heady mix 

 of glamour, excess, jealousy and revenge, a courtroom tussle 

 between a banker and her Latin dance instructor over his 

 $15-million fee has gripped the public imagination here. 

 High-flying HSBC banker Mimi Monica Wong agreed to pay the 

 sum for eight years of unlimited exclusive lessons from 

 flamboyant teacher Mirko Saccani in a deal which also involved 

 his wife, 14-time world champion Gaynor Fairweather. But 

 the partnership turned sour after a furious row in which 

 Saccani called her a lazy cow and told her to 

 move your arse.

The 37-year-old beat out 11 other competitors.

 J. HEMANTH 

 Kathmandu , Dec. 5: Maoist rebels and UN officials today agreed to speed up the the authentication of rebel fighters and their weapons within the next seven days. 

 At a meeting held in Kathmandu this morning, Jan Eric Wilhemson, security adviser of the UN representative to Nepal Ian Martin, said that the UN would soon begin inspections of the 21 rebel camps. However, he added, the entire process would be speeded up only after Martin returns to Nepal from New York. 

 According to Wilhemson, the arms management deal between the Seven-Party Alliance and the Maoists would be authenticated by Martin before the monitoring begins. Martin, who is in New York to discuss the developments in Nepal at the UN, is scheduled to return tomorrow. 

 Wilhemson also expressed concern over the attitude of both the government and the Maoists over the peace accord. Both the sides are not serious about implementing the various agreements,Wilhemson reportedly told the rebel side at the meeting. 

 Maoist spokesperson Krishna Bahadur Mahara highlighted the immediate need for managing the arms and armies. He also urged the UN representative to begin the monitoring process in order to ensure the effective implementation of the November 8 peace accord. According to the pact, the rebel army should have been disarmed and confined to the designated cantonments by November 21.

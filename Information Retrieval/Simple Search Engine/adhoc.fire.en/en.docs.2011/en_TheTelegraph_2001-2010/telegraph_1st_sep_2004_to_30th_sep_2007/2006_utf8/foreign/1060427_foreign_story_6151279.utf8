 New Delhi, April 26: India is in touch with Norwegian peace negotiators to preserve the ceasefire between the Sri Lankan government and the Tamil Tigers.

 Delhi is still wary of a direct intervention in Lankan affairs and, for the moment, is willing to back the Norwegian efforts in bringing peace on the island. 

 However, there is an urgency to react as there are strong indications of a war breaking out. According to an assessment by the Indian military, the attempted assassination of the Sri Lankan army chief and the retaliatory strikes by the military have cast a thick cloud on the ceasefire agreement between Colombo and the LTTE. If the attacks and the counter-strikes continue, the truce could be sunk without any formal announcement from either side. 

 Delhi has advised restraint and is urging both sides to abide by the ceasefire agreement. It has expressed concern over the Sri Lanka Monitoring Missions statement yesterday after the attack on Army Commander Sarath Fonseka. It is likely to have negative effects on the relationship between the government of Sri Lanka and the LTTE, and could jeopardise any possibility of future talks, it had said.

 Information monitored in Delhi also suggests that the Lankan army has closed borders with LTTE-controlled regions in the eastern part of the island nation. A senior army officer said: No self-respecting military will take an attack on its chief lying down and the retaliatory strikes were to be expected.

 Fonseka is one of the many senior officers of the Lankan army with whom the Indian military enjoys a good rapport. He had completed the Battalion Support Weapons Course, a standard with infantry officers. He has also done a course Counter Insurgency and Jungle Warfare School, Vairangte, Mizoram, besides the commando officers course in Belgaum, Karnataka.

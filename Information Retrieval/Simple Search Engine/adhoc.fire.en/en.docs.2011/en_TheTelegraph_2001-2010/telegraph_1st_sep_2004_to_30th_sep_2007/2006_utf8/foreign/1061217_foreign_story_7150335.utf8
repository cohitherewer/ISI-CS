 Incorrect word of year: Macaca

 Los Angeles, Dec. 16 (Reuters): Macaca you are number one.

 The word macaca, used by outgoing Republican Senator George Allen of Virginia to describe a Democratic activist of Indian descent who was trailing his campaign, was named the most politically incorrect word of the year yesterday by Global Language Monitor, a non-profit group that studies word usage.

 The word might have changed the political balance of the US Senate, since Allens utterance (an offensive slang term for Indians) surely impacted his election bid, said the groups head, Paul JJ Payack. 

 In second place on this years list was Global Warming Denier, for someone who believes that climate change has moved from scientific theory to dogma. There are now proposals that global warming deniers be treated the same as Holocaust deniers: professional ostracism.

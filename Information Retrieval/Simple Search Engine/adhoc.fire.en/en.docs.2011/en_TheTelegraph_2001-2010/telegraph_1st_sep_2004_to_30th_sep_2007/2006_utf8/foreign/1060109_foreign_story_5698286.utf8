 From master spy to matador

 MICHAEL SULLIVAN 

 Washington, Jan. 8: Retiring 007 Pierce Brosnan ? whose four-film reign as superspy James Bond came to an abrupt end last year with the announcement that actor Daniel Craig would take over the iconic role and who has complained in print about the titantic jolt to the system he initially felt upon getting the call that broke the news ? would rather not say anything more on the subject. 

 Ive spoken enough about it, he says, with a sigh, audible through the telephone. I wish Daniel all the success and happiness. 

 Still, the actor who has come to be associated with shaken-not-stirred cool, thanks to his association with writer Ian Flemings character (not to mention his mid-1980s TV stint as playboy thief-turned-detective Remington Steele), feels the need to point out one thing: His role in The Matador as a profane, debauched hit man undergoing a midlife crisis is by no stretch of the imagination intended as a rebuttal to his debonair public image. 

 It had nothing to do with anti-Bond anything, he says, calling that spin so much publicity verbiage. I never thought, This is great. Itll get me out of the box, out of the corner. 

 And yet, and yet. 

 Maybe taking the role even he acknowledges is a gritty, sharp left turn from what he has been known for did have a kind of perverse appeal. Id been wondering when something would come along, for a number of years, as the belts got tighter and tighter on Bond, he says. Its a huge persona to get yourself away from. Id always been aware of that, even before the call came. 

 The truth, says Brosnan (whose production company, Irish DreamTime, produced the film), is that he wasnt initially aware of how much of a left turn it would actually entail until well into the process. 

 Youre only aware in the doing of it. (You think), This is going to surprise an audience. They file into a darkened theater: Oh, look, theres Brosnan. Hes wearing this crazy mustache, painting his toenails, says (expletive) off to a kid, blows a guy to smithereens, walks through a hotel lobby in his knickers. 

 Dark comedy is very difficult, he adds. You have to bring the audience in and push them away at the same time. 

 The finished product, of course, is a little less dark than originally envisioned in writer-director Richard Shepards early versions of the script.. Thats because Brosnan, as producer, suddenly began to have qualms that his character, a psychopathic assassin named Julian Noble, might be even more alienating than his decadent character in quot;The Tailor of Panama. quot; 

 quot;There was one weekend there where I had a petit mal, quot; he jokes. quot;As I was setting sail on the project, I went instinctively. Then all at once I thought, Is this too sharp of a turn? Has the pendulum swung too far? So we investigated the script. And we pulled back. Technically, less is more, anyway. [Julian] originally was this flamboyant, vulgarian voice: bisexual, trisexual, try anything. And as much as I thought it was extremely funny in this vulgar way, I didnt want to bang on the audiences head. 

 quot;I made a lot of people very sad that weekend, quot; he continues, recalling that as both leading man and producer, one sometimes has to be a behind-the-scenes heavy. quot;By Wednesday, it was all right. We simply pulled [Julians] sexuality back and took out some jokes that were just foul. quot; 

 Producing demands a completely different skill set from the classically trained actor, who after eight years of sharing producing duties with his longtime friend and business partner, Beaumarie St. Clair, on films such as quot;The Nephew, quot; quot;Evelyn, quot; quot;Laws of Attraction quot; and quot;The Thomas Crown Affair, quot; says he is still learning the back-office ropes. quot;Its an ongoing education in literature, filmmaking and business -- or, I should say, my own lack of business acumen. Fortunately, weve got a great team in place. quot; 

 Brosnan compares the variety of films he has made for Irish DreamTime with examples of another art form. quot;I look at them like paintings, quot; he says. quot;Its great to go out in big, bold colors, with a popcorn flick like Thomas Crown, and then to drop down into small drama like Evelyn. quot; 

 Its a mix of the large and small, of the multiplex and the art-house, of Hollywood and his Irish roots, and of playing bad guys and good guys that Brosnan has no intention of abandoning. 

 Right now, hes working on quot;Seraphim Falls, quot; a Civil War drama in which the actor plays a mysterious hunted man who, as the film opens, is seen picking off, one by one, the members of a posse (led by Liam Neeson) that is pursuing him across the desert. After that, hell take a second stab at playing Thomas Crown in the Irish DreamTime-produced quot;The Topkapi Affair. quot; Although its already quot;in the works, quot; according to Brosnan, his company had been quot;reluctant quot; to do a sequel to the 1999 remake of quot;The Thomas Crown Affair quot; for some years. 

 Sure, the part of Thomas Crown offers another plum role (and another playboy thief no less!) for Brosnan, who by now can play these debonair criminals in his sleep. But the real reason he has hesitated to make the movie might serve to make Daniel Craig a little less nervous about living up to the worlds impossibly high expectations of the new James Bond: quot;Who wouldnt be reluctant? Its risky to step into the hallowed shoes of Steve McQueen. quot;

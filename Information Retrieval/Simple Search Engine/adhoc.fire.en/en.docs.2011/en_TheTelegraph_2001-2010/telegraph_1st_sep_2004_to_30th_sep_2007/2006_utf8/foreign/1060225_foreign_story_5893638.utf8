 Pak hawk held before protests

 Lahore, Feb. 24 (Reuters): Pakistani authorities detained the head of the countrys main Islamist Opposition alliance today for the second time in a week to prevent him from leading protests over cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad.

 Demonstrations against the cartoons were held in several cities and towns across Pakistan following a call from Qazi Hussain Ahmeds six-party Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance.

 But the number of participants was small by Pakistani standards and there were no reports of the type of violence seen last week, in which five people died.

 Ahmed was detained in Lahore after police blocked roads leading to Mansoora, a complex housing the headquarters of his Jamaat-e-Islami party. He cannot go out of his party office, said Taimur Azmat Usman, a spokesman for the provincial government.

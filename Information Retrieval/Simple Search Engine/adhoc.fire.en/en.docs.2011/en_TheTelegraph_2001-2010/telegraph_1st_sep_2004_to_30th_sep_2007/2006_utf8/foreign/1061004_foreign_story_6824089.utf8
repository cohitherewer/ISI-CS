 Amish school carnage

 Roberts: Angry

 Nickel Mines (Pennsylvania), Oct. 3 (Reuters): A dairy truck driver with a grudge burst into a one-room Amish schoolhouse yesterday and killed three girls execution style before committing suicide in the third deadly US school shooting in the past week, authorities said.

 Two girls died overnight, bringing to five the number of students killed. One other girl remained in critical condition and another four were described as stable, state police said.

 The heavily armed gunman, identified by authorities as Charles Carl Roberts, 32, had ordered the boys and some adults out of the classroom before opening fire on the girls.

 Roberts, who was not Amish, had dropped his own three school-aged children at their bus stop in the morning, showing no sign of the rampage to come, commissioner Jeffrey Miller of Pennsylvania state police said.

 But Roberts had left a rambling suicide note and letter to his wife and children, referring to an event 20 years ago for which he sought revenge, and he planned for a lengthy siege. He was angry with life and was angry at God. ... There may have been a loss of a child at some point in his life, Miller said.

 The Georgetown School classroom had 26 students aged 6 to 13. After Roberts ordered the 15 boys and some adults to leave, the victims were shot at close range, execution style, firing into the back of the head, Miller said. 

 Discussing the state of the wounded victims, Miller said: It would be a miracle if we were somehow able to have no further loss of life.

 The tragedy stunned this peaceful, largely Amish community some 100 km west of Philadelphia, where descendants of settlers of Swiss-German descent have preserved a religious lifestyle that shuns aspects of modern life.

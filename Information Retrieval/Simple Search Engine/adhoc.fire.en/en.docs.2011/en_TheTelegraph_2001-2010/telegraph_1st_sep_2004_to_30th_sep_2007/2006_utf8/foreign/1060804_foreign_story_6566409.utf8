 Leaderless Cuba tense

 Havana, Aug. 3 (Reuters): Nearly three days after Cubas historic handover of power, neither ailing President Fidel Castro nor his brother Raul, to whom he temporarily ceded control, has been seen by an anxious Cuban public.

 Close aide Ricardo Alarcon told a US radio programme yesterday that Castro, who had had a stomach operation, was very alert and resting after giving up power on the communist-ruled island for the first time in 47 years.

 No photographs or television pictures of Castro, 79, have been released since his operation for intestinal bleeding and there was also no sign of defence minister Raul, 75, Castros designated successor.

 We dont know whats going on. Were waiting for Raul to speak, said Vilma Gutierrez, a mother of three who works in a ramshackle state-owned shop selling subsidised potatoes and bananas. Her part of town saw riots in 1994 during the economic crisis.

 A finger to her lips, she said: People are keeping their mouths shut. They dont know whats going to happen. But Havanas sweltering streets, their stylish old buildings dilapidated from years of neglect, were quiet.

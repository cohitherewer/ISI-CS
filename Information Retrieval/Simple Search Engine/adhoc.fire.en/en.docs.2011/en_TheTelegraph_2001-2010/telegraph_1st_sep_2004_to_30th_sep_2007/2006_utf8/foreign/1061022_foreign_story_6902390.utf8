 Osama in US polls

 Washington, Oct. 21 (Reuters): Republicans unveiled an advertisement yesterday featuring the image and words of al Qaida leader Osama bin Laden and a warning to voters that these are the stakes in the November 7 election.

 The Republican National Committee ad, first shown on its website and scheduled for airing on cable television early next week, also includes images of al Qaida fighters in training and other al Qaida leaders.

 What is yet to come will be even greater, the ad quotes bin Laden as saying, before concluding with the words: These are the stakes. Vote November 7.

 President George W. Bushs Republicans, slipping in the polls from public dissatisfaction with the Iraq war, are fighting to retain control of Congress in the election. Democrats must pick up 15 House seats and six Senate seats to win a majority in each chamber.

 Republicans hope to turn the debate in the campaigns closing stages back to their traditionally strong issues of national security and the war on terrorism, although recent polls show Democrats overtaking them on that turf.

 Democratic Senate campaign committee spokesman Phil Singer called the ad a desperate effort to spur Republican voter turnout.

 The bin Laden ad recalls one of the most famous American political ads, the 1964 Daisy ad used by Democratic President Lyndon Johnson in his race against conservative Republican Barry Goldwater.

 It featured a small girl picking a daisy and a countdown to nuclear explosion before an announcer says: These are the stakes.

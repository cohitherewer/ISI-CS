 Baluch smells India hand in violence

 Karachi, Feb. 6 (Reuters): The governor of Pakistans western Baluchistan province today accused Afghan warlords and drug barons of arming tribal militants and India of financing them, a day after 21 people were killed in the latest round of violence.

 Baluch separatists and tribal militants have waged a low-level insurgency for decades, but the violence has escalated over the past year, posing another challenge to President Pervez Musharrafs authority over his turbulent nation.

 Baluchistan governor Ovais Ahmad Ghani said the deteriorating security situation was partly a spillover from Afghanistan due to the weakness of President Hamid Karzais government.

 Unfortunately Karzais central government is weak in the provinces, he said. We have successfully stopped 10 to 12 per cent of arms movement from Afghanistan but the border between Afghanistan and Baluchistan is 1,200-plus km long and it is very difficult to completely seal it. 

 Yesterday, 13 people were killed by a bomb on a bus some 60 km south of the provincial capital of Quetta. About a dozen suspects have been detained, but the authorities have not blamed any group.

 Also today, eight people were killed when tribesmen fired over 100 rockets at Sui, a town sitting atop Pakistans largest gas field.

 On Friday and Saturday, rockets had rained down on Dera Bugti, 50 km from Sui, and near the Loti Gas Field.

 Baluchistan is thinly populated but mineral rich, and its people want to benefit more from the exploitation of those resources, and the government faces trouble both from tribal militant and the secessionist Baluch Liberation Army.

 Ghanis comments come a little over a week before Karzai is due to visit Pakistan.

 He said more than one country is involved in fuelling the insurgency in Baluchistan, with a clear nod towards India. These groups are spending over 500 million rupees annually in weapons purchase, he said. We know where the money is coming from, I dont want to name any particular country, but everybody knows that we have an old rivalry with India.

 Last month, the Pakistan government levelled similar accusations after an Indian official said the Pakistan army should exercise restraint in Baluchistan.

 The army launched a crackdown after a Dec. 14 rocket attack while President Pervez Musharraf was visiting the town of Kohlu in Baluchistan.

 Baluch nationalists say hundreds of people have been killed. Analysts say this could be an exaggeration, but the independent Human Rights Commission of Pakistan has accused the government ofgross human rights violations in Baluchistan.

 Israel raid on rebels strains ceasefire

 Beirut, Aug. 19 (Reuters): Helicopter-borne Israeli commandos raided a Hizbollah bastion today in what Lebanon called a naked violation of the UN-backed truce that halted Israels 34-day war with the Shia group.

 Israel said the operation in Lebanons eastern Bekaa Valley aimed to disrupt weapons supplies to Hizbollah from Syria and Iran. Both countries deny arming the group.

 Lebanese security sources said three Hizbollah guerrillas were killed in a dawn firefight with the Israeli commandos. The Israeli army said it had suffered one dead and two wounded. 

 It is a naked violation of the cessation of hostilities declared by the Security Council, Prime Minister Fouad Siniora said, referring to an August 11 resolution. Siniora said he had protested to visiting UN envoys. The truce came into effect on Monday.

 Commandos in two vehicles unloaded from helicopters were intercepted on their way to an office of a Hizbollah leader, Sheikh Mohammed Yazbek, in the village of Bodai, the Lebanese sources said. The Israelis withdrew under cover of air strikes.

 The Israeli foreign ministry said continued Hizbollah arms shipments and the absence of Lebanese and international troops on the border had made the raid necessary. Israel reserves the right to act in order to enforce the spirit of the (UN) resolution, said spokesman Mark Regev.

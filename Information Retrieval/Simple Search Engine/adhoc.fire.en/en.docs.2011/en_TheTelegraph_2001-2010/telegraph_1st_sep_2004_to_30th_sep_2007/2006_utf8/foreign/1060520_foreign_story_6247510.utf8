 Pak tries to cool Kabul temper

 (Top) Kasuri and 

 Karzai 

 Islamabad, May 19 (Agencies): Pakistan today rejected a claim by Afghan President Hamid Karzai that it was backing Taliban militants in Afghanistan to stir up violence that left over 100 people dead yesterday.

 Pakistan is actively working with Kabul in coordinating and sharing intelligence in the fight against terrorism, foreign minister Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri told the Senate, Pakistans upper house of parliament in Islamabad.

 Kasuri made his comments a day after Kabul said gunbattles and suicide attacks during the last two days had killed more than 100, mostly militants.

 The foreign minister said a strong Afghanistan is what Pakistan wants.

 Lets not trade insults through the media. You have a difficult situation there, we have a difficult situation here. Lets not loose our cool, Kasuri said.

 He added that Pakistan has never and will not ever try to create instability in Afghanistan. Why would we do things that are against our own interests? Kasuri asked Afghanistan not to indulge in such insidious statements.

 At least 15 Afghan policemen, an American civilian training Afghan forces, and the first female Canadian soldier also died in some of the bloodiest violence since the fall of the Taliban in late 2001.

 Karzai yesterday blamed Pakistan for the violence. We have credible reports that inside Pakistan, in the madarsas, the mullahs and teachers are saying to their students: Go to Afghanistan for jihad. Burn the schools and clinics, he said.

 Today, while winding up a debate on foreign policy, Kasuri asked Karzai not to blame Pakistan ? a key ally of the US in its war on terror ? for what was happening inside Afghanistan.

 F-16s collide

 Athens, May 23 (Reuters): Greek and Turkish F-16 fighters collided in mid-air today while shadowing each other in the southern Aegean, where the two Nato allies have long disputed control over airspace.

 The two Nato members, who have come to the brink of war in the past over territorial disputes in the region, gave starkly differing accounts of the crash. But both hurried to limit damage to ties that have warmed markedly in the last six years.

 Turkeys foreign ministry said it had learnt with sadness that the Greek pilot lost his life. Athens announced search and rescue efforts were continuing and that he would be considered missing for at least 72 hours before being declared dead.

 Greece said the Turkish pilot, flying one of three Turkish planes involved in the incident, had been rescued by a foreign commercial vessel and was later picked up by a Turkish military helicopter after refusing to board a Greek rescue helicopter. 

 The calm tone of exchanges, contrasting with the bitter rhetoric of the past, highlighted a dramatic improvement in ties between the two long-time rivals, but analysts said this echo of past enmity could hamper further progress.

 Turkey said the crash was caused by a Greek fighter interfering in Turkish manoeuvres in international airspace.

 Greece said two Greek fighters were scrambled after two Turkish F-16s and an RF-4 jet violated the Athens flight information region, an area reaching out over the Aegean. It then headed towards Crete.

 The collision had occurred at about 8,000 metres, some 34 km southeast of the island of Karpathos.

 Baghdad, Nov. 25 (Reuters): Fearful Iraqis spent sleepless nights guarding their homes and asking who would be next after gunmen burned mosques and houses in a Sunni enclave following the worst bomb attack since the US invastion.

 The city of 7 million was under a tight curfew for a second full day since Thursdays bombing in which more than 200 Shias died.

 The government called for calm, desperate to avert the sort of sharp escalation in violence that followed an attack on a Shia shrine in Samarra in February. This time, many fear, such revenge attacks could push Iraq over the edge.

 Everybody is tense, everybody is expecting something may happen at any moment, said Abu Marwah, 40, a Sunni Arab translator who spent much of the night on the roof of his house with his Kalashnikov at hand, keeping watch for militia attacks. Exploding mortar bombs kept other Baghdad residents awake.

 Four mosques and some houses were burnt in the small Sunni part of the mainly Shia Hurriya area in northwest Baghdad, Sunni deputy Prime Minister Salem al-Zobaie said yesterday.

 Some 32 people were killed, police said, in attacks on the area by suspected Shia militiamen, untroubled by a curfew enforced after 202 died in the Shia stronghold of Sadr City.

 A witness to yesterdays attacks in Hurriya, university teacher Imad al-Din al-Hashemi, said three women, three children and two men were badly burned but survived when gunmen threw petrol into their homes and set fire to the buildings.

 Born to granny

 Tokyo, Oct. 15 (AP): A Japanese woman in her 50s gave birth to her own grandchild by using an egg from her daughter and sperm from her daughters husband.

 It was the first time in Japan that a woman has acted as a surrogate mother for her daughter. The woman agreed to in-vitro fertilisation because her daughter, in her 30s, had her uterus removed and was unable to bear children, Japanese daily Yomiuri Shimbun reported today.

 Duff mania 

 Los Angeles (AP): Singer-actress Hilary Duff and her boyfriend, 

Good Charlotte singer Joel Madden, have sought restraining orders against two 

men they claim are stalking them. They said one of the two was a Russian who came 

to Los Angeles for the sole purpose of meeting and becoming romantically 

involved with Duff. He has admitted to being obsessed 

with her, has stated his intention of removing his enemies (i.e. those 

who prevent him)... and has threatened to kill himself and to engage in dramatic 

actions to get her attention, they alleged.

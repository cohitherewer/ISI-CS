 Pound-wise Brits head to NY

 ROSIE MURRAY-WEST

 Shopping fever 

 London, Dec. 2: Thousands of bargain-hunting Britons are expected to flock to New York and other US cities before Christmas to take advantage of the two dollar pound.

 Airlines are reporting increased bookings on US flights and travel agents are getting more inquiries from transatlantic shoppers.

 We anticipate a rise in the number of people booking trips in the next week or two as Christmas draws closer and people will want to take advantage of the great exchange rate, a spokesman for lastminute.com said yesterday.

 British Airways has laid on four extra flights a week to the US, including one to New York. They were planned several months ago but are filling up fast.

 Virgin Atlantic is reporting a 20 per cent increase in bookings, while US stores are being swamped by British shoppers. Customers can currently get $1.978 to the pound, meaning that UK shoppers in the US can buy many goods at almost half the price at home.

 But revenue and customs warned yesterday that shoppers could only bring back 145 worth of goods without attracting duty. This can be levied at up to 20 per cent of the value of some items, ranging from electronic goods to jeans, which would wipe out much of the savings.

 One example of the complicated system is that while still digital cameras are free from the standard duty rate, camera lenses are subject to a 6.7 per cent tariff, while the rate for camcorders is as much as 14 per cent. 

 A spokesman said customs does not turn a blind eye to people exceeding the allowance while stressing that its main task was to stop the smuggling of drugs and other illegal items.

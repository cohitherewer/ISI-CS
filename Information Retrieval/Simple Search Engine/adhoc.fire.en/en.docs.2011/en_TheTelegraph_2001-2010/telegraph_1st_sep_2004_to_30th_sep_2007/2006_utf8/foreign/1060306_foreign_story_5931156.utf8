 Costly crash

 London, March 5: A bungling Royal Air Force baggage handler has been reprimanded after driving a luggage carriage into a Boeing 747, leaving taxpayers with a bill for ?600,000, The Daily Telegraph reported. 

 The chartered jet, carrying 300 members of the armed forces, was preparing to take off from the Falkland Islands last month when the carriage went out of control and smashed into the starboard engine. 

 The damage was relatively minor but the costs increased because officers were forced to fly in engineers to repair the aircraft and charter another 747 to return the troops to Britain. This has to be one of the most expensive prangs in the history of the air force. The luggage handler is very embarrassed, an official said.

 Gaza beer 

 Taybeh, West Bank (Reuters): Palestinian brewer Nadim Khoury, far from going out of business after Hamas Islamists won an election landslide, is preparing a new product ? non-alcoholic beer. Khoury said his brewery would put a green label on bottles instead of the gold one on regular Taybeh beer. The reason? The green flag of Hamas. Now we have a new government, so our motive to produce non-alcoholic beer becomes stronger, said the director of Taybeh Beer, the only brewery in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.

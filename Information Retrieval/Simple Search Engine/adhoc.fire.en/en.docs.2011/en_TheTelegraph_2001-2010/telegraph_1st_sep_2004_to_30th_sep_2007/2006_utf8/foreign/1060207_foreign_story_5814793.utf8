 Colombo, Feb. 6 (Reuters): Sri Lankas government and the Tamil Tiger rebels will hold peace talks in Geneva on February 22-23 seen as a last chance to avoid a slide back to a two-decade civil war.

 The talks will be the first at a high level since the islands peace process ground to a halt three years ago and are seen as vital to stemming escalating violence that killed have around 200 soldiers, civilians and rebels in two months.

 A date has been agreed between the government, the Tigers and Oslo, Norwegian peace broker Erik Solheim said after meeting chief rebel negotiator Anton Balasingham today. It is very positive that the parties have agreed to meet at high level to discuss how to improve the serious security situation. 

 The announcement comes a day after the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rejected government plans for talks on February 15-16, citing reported abductions of pro-Tiger aid workers that they blame on the military. 

 The Tigers say talks must focus on implementation of a ceasefire agreed in 2002, in particular a clause that stipulates the state must disarm paramilitaries the rebels say are attacking them.

 They want the government to disarm a renegade rebel faction led by a breakaway commander called Karuna, suspected to be behind a series of attacks in territory in the north and east controlled by the mainstream group.

 They have warned that talks, seen as a chance to build long absent trust between the foes, are doomed if the government tries to amend the terms of the ceasefire.

 Diplomats said the atmosphere of the talks could well depend on whether seven of the 10 pro-rebel aid workers who are still unaccounted for are released safe.

 If talks fail... I dont think we are looking at a situation of imminent open war, said Prof Emeritus Gerald Peiris of the University of Peradeniya. But (the violence) we have been having over the past few weeks is likely to continue, and it could spiral out of control.

 The Geneva talks are a first step, and peace envoys warn any lasting solution is still a long way off.

 New President Mahinda Rajapakse has already rejected the LTTEs demands for a separate homeland in the north and east for ethnic Tamils, and some analysts fear the rebels are insincere about peace in the first place and have simply used the truce to buy time to regroup and rearm.

 Rajapakse, who came to power after the Tigers ruined the November presidential election chances of the candidate seen best placed to reach a peace deal by scaring voters away with a boycott, has proved to be more moderate than many had expected.

 But Sri Lankas north and east, still ravaged by the scars of a war that displaced hundreds of thousands from their homes and left entire towns in ruins, remains tense.

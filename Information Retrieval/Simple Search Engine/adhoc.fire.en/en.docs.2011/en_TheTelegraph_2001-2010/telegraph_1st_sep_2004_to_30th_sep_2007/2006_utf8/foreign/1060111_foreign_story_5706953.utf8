 Swank to separate

 Swank: New Lowe

 Los Angeles, Jan. 10 (Reuters): Two-time Oscar winner Hilary Swank and her actor husband Chad Lowe have decided to separate after eight years of marriage, Swanks publicist said yesterday.

 Hilary and Chad have decided to separate but they are hopeful theyll be able to get through this tough time, publicist Troy Nankin said in a statement. Swank, 31, won her second Oscar last year for playing a feisty female boxer in Million Dollar Baby.

 In an effusive acceptance speech at the 2005 Academy awards ceremony, she thanked Lowe for his support, saying: Chad, youre my everything.

 Swank and Lowe married in September 1997 and have managed to keep their personal life mostly private. 

 Lowe, 37, works mostly in television and won an Emmy in 1993 for his portrayal of an AIDS sufferer in the TV series Life Goes On.

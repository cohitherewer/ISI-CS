 Chocolate igloo

 Perugia (Italy), Oct. 16 (Reuters): Four Italians have constructed what they believe is the worlds first full-sized chocolate igloo but they have yet to solve an age-old problem.

 It still melts.

 It was a tough thing to do, much more difficult than building a normal snow igloo, Marco Fanti, 45, who used to race cars in desert rallies, said as he stood beside the 1.65-metre-high, dome-shaped traditional Inuit shelter made of some 330 dark chocolate bricks. Fanti and fellow instructors at a survival school took 23 hours working with tricky, crumbling chocolate material to construct what they believe to be the worlds first chocolate igloo for the Eurochocolate fair in Perugia. They normally build one made of snow within three to four hours.

 Pirates sinks records

 ADRIANE QUINLAN

 Washington, July 10: Steering clear of the doldrums in a sea of bad critical reviews, the Black Pearl set sail over the weekend with an eye-popping pile of box-office booty.

 Disneys Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Mans Chest pulled aboard $55.5 million on Friday ? the highest single-day pillage ever ? and cleaned up over the weekend with an estimated $132 million in ticket sales, another all-time record.

 Following in the wake of 2003s Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, the sequel finds that same band of swashbuckling rogues cruising the high seas, under the dark-eyed vigilance of Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow.

 The film lashed to the mast the former opening-day record holder, Star Wars: Episode II, Revenge of the Sith ($50 million). Spider-Man, cowering in the shadows of Keira Knightleys cheekbones, gave up its former opening weekend record of $114 million. (Curse of the Black Pearl raked in a mere $47 million on its opening weekend in July 2003.)

 Asked about the $132 million weekend haul, producer Jerry Bruckheimer said he had expected something closer to the $77-million debut for The Da Vinci Code.

 When people in the industry predicted these high numbers, I thought they were just trying to be mean, Bruckheimer told the Associated Press yesterday. So no matter how good we did, if we did $100 million, wed be failures. I didnt think wed get near these numbers.

 I think its just jaw-dropping, said Gitesh Pandya of the website www.boxoffice- guru.com, who predicted high numbers ? but not this high. He attributed the films success to female moviegoers. They just love Johnny Depp in this role, Pandya said. He has more sex appeal than most male action stars. Judging from the weekends turnout, Pandya thinks the film could do as well as $1 billion domestically and $2 billion internationally.

 Such success illustrates a harsh divide between the viewers who turned out in droves and the critics who were practically unanimous in panning the film. The New York Times called Pirates a glistening, sushi-grade chunk of franchise entertainment, and Rolling Stone reduced it to a hollow hull of briny clich?s. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times found it as forgettable as a bad day in the Disneyland parking lot ? a scene as crowded as the lines at Washington area theatres on Friday.

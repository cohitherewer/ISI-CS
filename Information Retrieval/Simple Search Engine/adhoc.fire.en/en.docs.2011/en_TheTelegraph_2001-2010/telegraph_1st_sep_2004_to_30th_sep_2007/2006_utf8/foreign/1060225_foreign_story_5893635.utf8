 Old Bond to rescue of new one

 Toronto, Feb. 24 (AP): It took an old Bond to come to the rescue of the new Bond.

 Roger Moore, who played agent 007 in seven of the James Bond movies, said critics of the film franchises new star, Daniel Craig, should give him a chance.

 Hes a helluva good actor, said Moore, 78, noting that critics havent even seen Craig in the role yet. So why attack him? A group of James Bond fans has launched a website (www.Craignotbond.com) to protest the hiring of Craig to replace Pierce Brosnan in Casino Royale, now shooting in Prague.

 The blond Craig, who has starred in Munich and The Jacket, has so offended the fans they say they will boycott the film unless Eon Productions and Sony Pictures admit they have made a big mistake.

 Moore suggested the group was merely trying to attract people to their website.

 Moon probe

 Cape Canaveral (Florida), April 11 (Reuters): Nasa plans to send a two-tonne probe crashing into a crater on the moon in hopes of discovering if it harbours water that could be used for manned missions, the US space agency said yesterday.

 The $73 million probe, to be built by Northrop Grumman Corp, is set to be launched in 2008 aboard a rocket also carrying a sophisticated lunar mapper. Were going to learn a lot from this, said programme manager Dan Andrews of Nasas Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, California. Its going to give us a real definitive understanding of what we have up there.

 Nasa astronauts visited the moon during the late 1960s and early 1970s under the Apollo programme.

 Nasa plans a series of robotic precursor missions including the Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite, or LCROSS, which will plow into the crater, and the mapper, called the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter. 

 When LCROSS strikes the crater, it is expected to create a hole 5 metres deep and send up a 998,000-kg plume of debris for sensors and cameras stationed on a second spacecraft to monitor. Dozens of ground-based telescopes, will be trained on the plume as well. A monitoring satellite that is part of LCROSS will then fly through the plume to collect and relay data back to Earth.

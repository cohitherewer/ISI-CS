 Saddam signatures match

 Baghdad, April 24 (Reuters): Signatures on documents linking Saddam Hussein and six of his co-accused to the killings of 148 Shias in the 1980s match those of the former Iraqi President, the court heard today.

 The prosecution had demanded the court commission a team of experts to examine documents and authenticate the signatures and handwriting of the defendants facing charges of crimes against humanity in the deaths of 148 Shias in Dujail in 1982.

 The signatures and margins stipulated in the documents match the signature of Saddam Hussein on presidential decrees, said the experts report read out at the trial in Baghdads Green Zone.

 Saddam and his half brother Barzan al-Tikriti have refused to give the court samples of their writing. 

 Today, Barzan stood up in court in his white robe and traditional Arabic checkered headdress and rejected the report.

 He pointed to the movie Catch Me If You Can starring Leonardo DiCaprio, which dramatises the true story of a teenaged con man who stole more than $2.5 million, as an example of how easy it would be to forge a signature.

 Why didnt the investigator show us the original copy of this evidence... Its presented in front of hundreds of millions to try and stain our reputation, said Barzan, a former Iraqi ambassador to the UN in Geneva and once one of the most feared men in Iraq.

 I have my reservations about the accusations that the signatures and handwriting is real. 

 Defence lawyers demanded 45 days to study the new evidence before commenting. The trial was adjourned until May 15 to give the defence time to present their witnesses in the next session.

 The 148 Shia men and teenagers were killed or executed after an attempt on Saddams life in the town of Dujail in 1982. Television footage of that day showed Saddam in a military uniform getting out of his armoured car and personally interrogating nervous Iraqis about the assassination attempt.

 Saddam and his seven co-defendants could face death by hanging if found guilty.

 Saddam and Barzan have said there was no crime in prosecuting the Dujail Shias because they were accused of trying to kill the former leader.

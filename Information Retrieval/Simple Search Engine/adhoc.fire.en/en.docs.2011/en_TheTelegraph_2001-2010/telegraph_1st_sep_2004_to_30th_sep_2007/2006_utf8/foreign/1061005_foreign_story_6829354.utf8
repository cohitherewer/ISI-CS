 Cloud on cool Condi

 Rice: Under fire

 Washington, Oct. 4 (Reuters): 

 Although she is afforded celebrity status by many Americans, 

 some analysts say US secretary of state Condoleezza Rices 

 image may be tarnished by reports that she brushed off warnings 

 of the September 11 attacks.

 Despite her central role in the problem-plagued Iraq war, Rice has so far managed to avoid the public criticism heaped on defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld and has repeatedly had the highest approval ratings of anyone in the Bush administration.

 Much of her celebrity-status is media driven she was on Vanity Fairs Best Dressed List. An accomplished pianist, she allowed the New York Times to critique Sunday afternoon recitals with friends at her apartment.

 But award-winning journalist Bob Woodwards new book State of Denial threatens to dent her image of cool and competent efficiency by raising doubts about Rices performance, both as national security adviser during President George W. Bushs first term and as secretary of state.

 Rice has been criticised recently for her handling of nuclear crises with Iran and North Korea as well as the turbulent West Asia. During the Lebanon-Israeli war she came under fire for the US decision not to call for an immediate ceasefire, which gave Israel a green light to continue air attacks.

 In his book Woodward says Rice was told by then CIA chief George Tenet in a July 10, 2001, meeting about evidence an imminent that attack was being planned on the US. Initially, Rice, who was Bushs national security adviser at the time, told reporters she did not recall the meeting. 

 But her spokesman Sean McCormack later confirmed it took place and said Rice asked the CIA chief to give the same briefing to Rumsfeld and then attorney general John Ashcroft.

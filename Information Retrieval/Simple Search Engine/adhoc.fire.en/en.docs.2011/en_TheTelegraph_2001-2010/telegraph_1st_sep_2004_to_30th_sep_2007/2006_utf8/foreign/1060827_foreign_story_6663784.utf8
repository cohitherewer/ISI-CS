 Colombo, Aug. 26 (AP): Police today found a major weapons cache hidden in a house on the outskirts of the Sri Lankan capital, and arrested 17 people who an official said were planning a major attack.

 The weapons haul came as air force jets launched a third day of airstrikes on rebel positions in the north and six soldiers died in a mine explosion blamed on separatist Tamil Tiger insurgents.

 Officers from the polices elite special task force, acting on a tip-off, raided a house in Pamunugama, a coastal town close to the countrys international airport this morning, seizing weapons and explosives, police said.

 The haul included 8 hand grenades, 2 roadside bombs, an assault rifle, ammunition and detonators, police officer S.A. Jeewahasta said.

 The officer said 17 suspects, including two women, were being held for questioning. The suspects are all from Kokkadicholai, a village in the northeast controlled by Tamil Tiger insurgents, Jeewahasta said.

 Most of the suspects have been living on the outskirts of Colombo for nearly 15 years and were making plans for a major attack, an investigating officer said, requesting anonymity as he is not authorised to speak to the press. He declined to give further information.

 Roadside bombs that fire hundreds of steel balls propelled by plastic explosives are a favoured weapon of the Tamil rebels.

 On Tuesday, police discovered and defused a powerful bomb planted in a box of vegetables on a bicycle in a busy shopping district in Colombo.

 The military, meanwhile, said air force jets struck a small rebel base along the de facto border in Jaffna. Military spokesman Major Upali Rajapakse said the insurgents had used the base to fire artillery and mortar at government lines across the border. 

 The attack destroyed their mortar positions and caused damage to the camp, he said. Rajapakse also said six soldiers were killed, and four wounded in a mine explosion in Jaffna. Rebel officials were not available to comment on the militarys claim to have defeated their attempt to retake the region.

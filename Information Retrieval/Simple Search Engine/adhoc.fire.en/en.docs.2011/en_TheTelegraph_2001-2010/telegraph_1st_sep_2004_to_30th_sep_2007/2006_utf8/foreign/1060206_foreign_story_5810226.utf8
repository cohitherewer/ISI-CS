The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Blair to step down next year

 Blair and Brown: Power shift 

 London, Feb. 5: Tony Blairs closest advisers are working to a timetable that will see the Prime Minister hand over power to Gordon Brown next summer, the Sunday Telegraph has learnt. 

 Senior ministers expect Blair to step down a few months after he completes 10 years in office, in May 2007. Such a move would provide the Chancellor, the overwhelming favourite to succeed Blair, with at least 18 months in power ahead of an expected general election in 2009. 

 However, it would mean Blair reneging on a promise to voters, made before the last election, to serve a full term at Number 10. One of Blairs closest and most trusted political advisers said: Tony will go in about 18 months. 

 Sources close to Brown accepted that a timetable of 18 months was possible, although they scotched claims of a new deal between the men.

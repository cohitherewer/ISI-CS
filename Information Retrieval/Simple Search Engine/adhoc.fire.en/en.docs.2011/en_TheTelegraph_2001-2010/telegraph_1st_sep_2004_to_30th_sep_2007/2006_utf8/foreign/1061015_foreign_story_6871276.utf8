 Bush threat snares girl

 Julia: Unfair

 Sacramento (Calfiornia), 

 Oct. 14 (AP): Upset by the war in Iraq, a 14-year-old 

 girl vented her frustrations with President George W. Bush 

 last spring on her myspace.Com page.

 Julia Wilson posted a picture of the President, scrawled kill Bush across the top and drew a dagger stabbing his outstretched hand. She replaced the page last spring after learning in her eighth-grade history class that such threats are a federal offence.Too late.

 US authorities had found the page and placed her on their checklist. They finally reached her this week in her molecular biology class.Wilson was taken out of class at Sacramentos McClatchy High School on Wednesday and questioned for about 15 minutes by two secret service agents. The incident has upset her parents, who said the agents should have included them when they questioned their daughter. Yesterday, Wilson said the agents questioning over her page on the popular teenage Internet gathering spot led her to tears.

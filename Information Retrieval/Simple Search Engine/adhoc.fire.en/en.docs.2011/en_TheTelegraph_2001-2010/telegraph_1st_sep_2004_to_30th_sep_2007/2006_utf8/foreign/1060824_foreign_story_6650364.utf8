 Bush to raise funds for Indian baiter

 Washington, Aug. 23 (Reuters): President George W. Bush has no reservations about raising money for a Republican Senator under sharp criticism for calling a rival-campaign worker of Indian descent macaca, the White House said today.

 With Senator (George) Allen having made an apology ... it is in all of our best interests and as we work in politics and we work to improve the tone and the discourse, that when apologies are offered, they are accepted, spokeswoman Dana Perino said.

 Democrats called on Bush to condemn Allen, who is seeking a second term in the US Senate in November and considering a presidential run in 2008, for remarks in which he also welcomed the campaign volunteer to the real world of Virginia.

 Allen, a former governor of Virginia, later apologised and said the word macaca, which some interpreted as racially insensitive, was a name he simply made up for the man who was videotaping a campaign appearance for his Democratic opponent, James Webb.

 The videotape spread quickly over the Internet and the fallout from Allens controversial comments has given Democrats new hope that Webb can make a race of it in the historically conservative state. Polls have shown Allen ahead but at least one has Webb closing the gap.

 Allens remarks to S.R. Sidarth, a 20-year-old American college student, attracted the attention of Democratic activists and generated fresh financial support for Webb who is at a huge money disadvantage in the race.

 By staying silent, the President who fancies himself as a man of integrity is giving tacit approval to comments that have no place in the public discourse, said Phil Singer, communications director for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Even worse, the Presidents decision to host a fundraiser for Allen sends a signal that the Senators actions were acceptable.

 The event, at a private home in Alexandria, Virginia, is closed to the media.

 Macaca is a genus of monkeys including macaques common to North Africa and Asia and is regarded as a racial slur in some parts of the world.

 In a memo to Republicans circulated to reporters by the DSCC, Allens campaign manager Dick Wadhams complained about a feeding frenzy in the news media over the Senators comments. 

 Wadhams acknowledged it had been a difficult week for Allen and his wife. Never in modern times has a statewide officeholder and candidate been so vilified in a desperate attempt to revive a campaign that was fast-sinking the Webb campaign, Wadhams wrote.

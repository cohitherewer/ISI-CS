 Picasso painting auction for charity

 Picassos painting Angel Fernandez de Soto

 New York, July 1 (Reuters): British composer Andrew Lloyd Webbers foundation will sell a Picasso portrait that is expected to fetch over $40 million at auction, with the proceeds being donated to charity, Christies said yesterday.

 The 1903 work from the artists Blue Period, Angel Fernandez de Soto, will be sold at Christies autumn auction of Impressionist and modern art on November 8.

 The haunting portrait of Picassos close friend, who he met in 1899 in Barcelona and with whom he remained friends until de Sotos death during the Spanish Civil War, is expected to sell for $40 million to $60 million.

 In recent years, Picasso portraits have achieved remarkable prices. His Boy With a Pipe holds the record for any art sold at auction at $104 million, while a 1941 portrait of his mistress, Dora Maar with cat, exceeded $95 million this spring ? more than double the expected sale price.

 We are thrilled to offer a work of such stature by Picasso, said Guy Bennett, Christies head of Impressionist and modern art in New York. He added that the oil-on-canvas was one of the most personal and powerful works from the Blue Period. The record for a Blue Period work is $55 million, set in 2000 by Woman with arms crossed.

 Lloyd Webber, the theatre composer known for a string of hits including Cats, Evita, Jesus Christ Superstar and The Phantom of the Opera, which in January became the longest-running show in Broadway history, bought the work in 1995 for $29.1 million.

 He will make no personal gain from the sale, Christies said.

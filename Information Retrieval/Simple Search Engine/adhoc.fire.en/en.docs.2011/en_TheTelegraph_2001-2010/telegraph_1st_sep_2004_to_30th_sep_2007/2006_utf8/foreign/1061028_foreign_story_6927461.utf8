 Terror threat to oil facility, say Saudis 

 London, Oct. 27 (Reuters): Coalition naval forces in the Gulf have been deployed to counter a possible threat to Saudi Arabias Ras Tanura terminal, the worlds biggest offshore oil facility, the UKs Royal Navy said today.

 Oil prices initially rose about 30 cents to around $61 as traders recalled a foiled attack in February on Saudi Arabias huge Abqaiq facility, the worlds biggest oil processing plant.

 Crude oil shipments were continuing as normal from the kingdoms main east coast terminal, industry sources said and added the deployment was routine. 

 The British navy issued a warning to merchant shipping as a precautionary measure after receiving intelligence of a possible threat. It said coalition forces had been dispatched in support of Bahraini and Saudi units.

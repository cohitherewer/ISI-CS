 Liz rejects marriage rumours

 Taylor: Private plans

 Los Angeles, Oct. 27 (Reuters): Actress Elizabeth Taylor yesterday denied media reports that she was planning to marry for the 9th time.

 Taylor, 74, is being linked romantically with artist and photographer Firooz Zahedi who in the mid-1970s became the stars personal photographer on her film projects. Responding to what she called stories regarding my private life and future plans, Taylor described Zahedi as an old and dear friend.

 But she added: We are not, have never been and will never be romantically involved. My private life and my plans, at this time remain private. Taylor, who was treated for congestive heart failure in 2004, went on US television in May to scoff at tabloid claims that she was gravely ill or suffering from Alzheimers disease.

 The violet-eyed actress has been married eight times, twice to British actor Richard Burton. Her last marriage, to building labourer Larry Fortensky, ended in divorce in 1996 after about four years.

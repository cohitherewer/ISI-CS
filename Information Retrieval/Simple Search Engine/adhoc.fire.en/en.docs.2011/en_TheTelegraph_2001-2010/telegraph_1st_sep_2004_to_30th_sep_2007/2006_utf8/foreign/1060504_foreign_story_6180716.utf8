 Worlds heaviest man in race to shed weight

 Rome, May 3 (Reuters): A Mexican man who at 550 kg is possibly the heaviest person in the world hopes to travel to Italy for a life-saving operation to shed weight. 

 Manuel Uribe, bedridden for the past five years, cannot stand on his own and will need a special flight to take him from Monterrey, Mexico to Modena, where a surgical team has offered to perform an intestinal bypass free of charge.

 I cant walk. Im cant leave my bed, the 40-year-old Uribe, who weighs the same as five baby elephants, said in a recent telephone interview.

 Im trying to reduce my weight a bit right now so I can be in the right condition for the operation.

 Uribe made an impassioned plea for help earlier this year on Mexican television, saying he weighed a more normal 130 kg until aged 22 and did not know what happened to him. The broadcast drew the attention of doctor Giancarlo De Bernardinis, who visited Mexico with a medical team to examine Uribe in March.

 Bernardinis, whose biggest patient to date weighed 350 kg, said he plans a gall bladder, intestinal bypass procedure that will allow Uribe to pass food more quickly without so many calories being absorbed.

 Bernardinis planned to perform the surgery in Modena as early as this month, although a Mexican health official doubted Uribe would be ready for a trip to Europe that quickly.

 Uribes case puzzles doctors since his cholesterol and blood-sugar levels are normal, despite his extreme obesity.

 His heart works very well. He has some respiratory difficulty because of his obesity, but in strict terms, hes well, said Marco Anibal Rodriguez Vargas, the director of hospitals in the Mexican state of Nuevo Leon. Rodriguez Vargas said Mexican hospitals still hoped to treat Uribe themselves, but added Uribe would ultimately decide what to do.

 Korean held over Iraq scam

 New York, Jan. 7 (AP): A South Korean businessman accused of accepting millions of dollars from Iraq in the UN oil-for-food scandal was arrested by the FBI in Houston, federal authorities announced.

 The arrest of Tongsun Park by FBI agents yesterday came as new criminal charges against him were unsealed in the US district court in Manhattan. The charges related to a scheme in which Park allegedly conspired to assist the government of Iraq during the creation of the UNs oil-for-food programme.

 Park had been charged with accepting millions of dollars from the Iraqi government while he operated in the US.

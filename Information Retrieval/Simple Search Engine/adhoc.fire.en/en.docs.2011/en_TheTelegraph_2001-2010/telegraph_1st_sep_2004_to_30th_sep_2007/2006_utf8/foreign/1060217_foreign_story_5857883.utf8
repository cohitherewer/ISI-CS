 Fine Print

 Mobile mourner

 Tokyo, Feb. 16 (Reuters): Japans obsession with camera-equipped mobile phones has taken a bizarre twist, with mourners at funerals now using the devices to capture a final picture of the deceased.

 I get the sense that people no longer respect the dead. Its disturbing, a funeral director told the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper.

 At one ceremony several people gathered round the coffin and took out their phones to photograph the corpse as preparations were made to begin a cremation, she was quoted as saying. 

 Wall watch

 Beijing (Reuters): Beijing has called 

 up a team of dedicated Great Wall monitors to protect it 

 from damage from tourists, the China Daily said on 

 Thursday. The Great Wall receives an estimated 10 million 

 visitors a year. All that traffic has taken a heavy toll 

 on the structure, prompting the move to employ local villagers 

 to keep watch.

 Dodgy box

 London (Reuters): Lifeboats and a helicopter scoured the sea to track down an electronic distress signal ? only for coastguards to discover it came from a British pensioners faulty digital television box on dry land.

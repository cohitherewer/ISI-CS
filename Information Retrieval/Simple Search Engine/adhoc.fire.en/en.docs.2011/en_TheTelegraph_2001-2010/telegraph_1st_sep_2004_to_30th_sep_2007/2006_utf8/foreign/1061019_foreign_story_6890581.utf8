 BA faces heat over cross bar

 London, Oct. 18: A British Airways employee who was banned from openly wearing a small Christian cross necklace fought for her job at a meeting with airline management yesterday.

 Nadia Eweida, 55, a check-in worker, spoke of her dismay after managers insisted she remove or cover up her small cross. When Eweida refused she was sent home on unpaid leave. The case has fuelled a national debate on religious expression and seen the politicians Peter Hain and Anne Widdecombe attack BA for its stance.

 At an appeal hearing the committed Christian argued for her right to wear the symbol, claiming she was being discriminated against on religious grounds.

 After the hearing, she said: They are accepting of the turban and the hijab, which are both bigger than the cross. It is discriminatory because I do not have the chance to show my religious belief.

 A decision on whether the company should change its policy, which does not allow any visible jewellery, is expected in a weeks time. After the meeting Eweida said that regardless of BAs decision she would return to work wearing the cross.

 UK calls for Iran action

 Tehran, Jan. 11 (Reuters): Britain called today for the UN Security Council to consider action against Iran after it resumed nuclear fuel research, but former Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani said any sanctions would be futile.

 Iran removed UN seals at uranium enrichment research facilities yesterday and announced it would resume research and development on producing uranium fuel, prompting angry reactions from Washington, the EU and Russia.

 British Prime Minister Tony Blair vowed to haul Iran before the Security Council, which can impose punitive measures. I think the first thing to do is to secure agreement for a reference to the Security Council, (if) that is indeed what the allies jointly decide as I think seems likely, Blair told parliament.

 Then .. we have to decide what measures to take and we obviously dont rule out any measures at all, he added.

 Blair made no direct reference to military force, but his remarks seemed stronger than those of foreign secretary Jack Straw, who said yesterday military action was not on Britains agenda and that he believed it was not on anyone elses.

 Adopting harsh measures like imposing sanctions cannot bring about the desired outcome, Rafsanjani said at Tehran University in a sermon to mark the Id ul-Zuha festival.

 The foreign ministers of Germany, France and Britain will meet in Berlin on Thursday to discuss the crisis caused by Irans move to reactivate a nuclear fuel programme mothballed under a November 2004 deal with the EU trio.

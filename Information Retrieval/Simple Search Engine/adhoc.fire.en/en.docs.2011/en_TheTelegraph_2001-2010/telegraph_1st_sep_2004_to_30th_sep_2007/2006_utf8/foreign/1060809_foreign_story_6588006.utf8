 Born in conflict, baby lies abandoned

 Tyre (Lebanon), Aug. 8 

 (AP): Only two hours old, baby Raad fought for his life 

 in an ambulance that screamed along a treacherous, bombed-out 

 stretch of road out of the heart of southern Lebanons 

 war zone.

 His shock of black hair was matted with blood from his birth and his frail body was swaddled in a blanket when ambulance drivers brought the barely 3-pound infant from the village of Tibnin to the Najem hospital in the southern port city of Tyre.

 He was born two months prematurely, when his mother had a Caesarian section at a smaller hospital in Tibnin, where she had fled from her home village. Tibnin has been swarmed with thousands of refugees from surrounding villages, escaping heavy Israeli bombardment in the area.

 Tyre is a little better, having been repeatedly hit in Israeli strikes. A bombed-out car still sits near Najem hospital from an earlier strike. But the hospital had far better facilities than Tibnins to take care of the new-born baby.

 For now two weeks after his birth Raad is effectively abandoned. He was rushed out of Tibnin, 20 km southeast of Tyre, but his mother stayed, either too weak or too frightened to come in the ambulance, hospital worker Ali Jawad Najem said yesterday.

 She called the Tyre hospital once to ask about her child, but when a nurse asked when she would come for the baby, the mother hung up. Later, a man who said he was the babys uncle came to the hospital to check on him, but refused to take the infant.

 The mother identified as Reema Jawad Hameer on a form filled out by the Lebanese Red Cross workers who brought the baby might be too afraid to hazard the roads or believes the baby is safer and better cared for in Tyre, staff said.

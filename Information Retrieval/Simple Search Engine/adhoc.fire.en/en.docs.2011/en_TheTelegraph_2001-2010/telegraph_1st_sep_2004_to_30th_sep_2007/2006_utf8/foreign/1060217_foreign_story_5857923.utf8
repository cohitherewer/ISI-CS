 Report slams Nepal rights

 Kathmandu, Feb. 16 (Reuters): A top UN human rights panel said today that Nepali soldiers responsible for human rights violations should be banned from participating in international peacekeeping missions.

 Human rights groups accuse soldiers and Maoist rebels of large-scale human rights abuses. 

 They also accuse the army of arbitrary arrests and rape.

 Nepals security forces must hold accountable perpetrators of violations within their ranks, who should be excluded from participation in UN peacekeeping operations, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said in a report on Nepal.

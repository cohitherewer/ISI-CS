 Condi likes rock, but favourite is Mozart

 Rice: Boyfriend memories

 Washington, May 17 (AP): Secretary of state Condoleezza Rice said she works out to the acid rock of Cream and rocks out to Kool and the Gang. Elton Johns Rocket Man reminds her of her first boyfriend.

 But Rice, who trained to be a concert pianist before she became the top US diplomat, said her all-time favourite musical work is Mozarts Piano Concerto in D minor.

 Rices eclectic Top 10 music list appeared yesterday in a special edition of the British newspaper The Independent. The list was a favour to U2 frontman Bono, who guest-edited the paper as part of a charity appeal to fight AIDS in Africa. 

 Secretary Rice told the paper she won her first piano competition at age 15 with the Mozart concerto. The fit 51-year-old put Creams Sunshine of your Love at number two, and noted that she plays it when she exercises.

 Believe it or not, I loved acid rock in college and I still do, she told the paper.

 Aretha Franklins woman-power anthem Respect comes in at number, followed by Kool and the Gangs party anthem Celebration.

 Rice went back to the classics with Brahms Piano Concerto No 2 and Piano Quintet in F minor. She said the quintet is the piece she most likes to play with friends at a regular Sunday afternoon chamber music session she hosts at her apartment.

 Not surprisingly, Bonos band U2 makes the list, at number seven, but Rice didnt single out any U2 tune as a favourite. Number eight is the 1972 Elton John sci-fi spaceman ballad, written with Bernie Taupin.

 For Rice, and many children of the 1970s, this song is a blast from the past, the newspaper wrote. Rice, who is single, added a personal note: It brings back memories of college, friends, my first boyfriend.

 Beethovens Symphony No. 7 is ninth. Quite simply the greatest symphony of all time, Rice said. Boris Godunov by Mussorgsky completes the list at number 10. The greatest opera of all time, said Rice, a scholar of Russian history and language.

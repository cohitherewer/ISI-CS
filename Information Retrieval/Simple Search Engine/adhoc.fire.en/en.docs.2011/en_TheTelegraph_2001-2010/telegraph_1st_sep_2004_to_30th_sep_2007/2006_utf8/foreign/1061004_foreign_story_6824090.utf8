The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Fine Print

 Beatles remixed

 London, Oct. 3: To purists it is close to sacrilege. 

 But the surviving Beatles have announced their first new album in more than 25 years: a remix of some of their best-known songs that was used as the soundtrack to the theatrical show Love, reports The Times. 

 Sir Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr, with Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison representing John Lennon and George Harrison, agreed to the release on EMI under the Beatles banner. 

 Sir George Martin, the octogenarian producer, used original master tapes to create a new musical suite with the opening chord of A Hard Days Night merging into Get Back, the Eastern drone of Within You, Without You accompanied by the drums from Tomorrow Never Knows and phrases from Penny Lane weaving in and out of Strawberry Fields Forever. 

 Love will compete for attention with Ecce Cor Meum (Behold My Heart), a choral piece composed by Sir Paul after the death of his first wife, Linda.

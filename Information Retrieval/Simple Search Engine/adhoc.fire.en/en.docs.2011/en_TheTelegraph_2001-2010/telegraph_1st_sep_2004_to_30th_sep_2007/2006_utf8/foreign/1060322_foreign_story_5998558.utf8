 Villepin softens job law stand

 Poissy (France), March 21 (Reuters): French Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin told jobless people today he was ready to improve his contested youth employment contract, but refused to bow to street protests and a national strike threat.

 The Prime Minister, battered in the polls and facing a stern test of his ambition to contest 2007 presidential elections, repeated his call for unions and employers to work with him on how best to implement ? not abandon ? the measure.

 The law is well put together. It provides a framework and provides for improvements that can be set by agreement between the social partners, Villepin said during a meeting with young unemployed people. The issue is understanding which points can be improved. Its not very complicated, its a matter of getting around (the negotiating) table, he said.

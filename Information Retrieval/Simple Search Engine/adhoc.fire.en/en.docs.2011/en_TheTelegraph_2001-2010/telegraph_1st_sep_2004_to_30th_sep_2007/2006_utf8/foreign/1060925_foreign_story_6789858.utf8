 Terror threat up after Iraq war, finds US

 Washington, Sept. 24 (Reuters): 

 The Iraq war gave birth to a new generation of Islamic radicals 

 and the terrorist threat has grown since the September 11 

 attacks, according to a US intelligence report cited in 

 The New York Times yesterday.

 A national intelligence estimate completed in April says Islamic radicalism has mushroomed worldwide and cites the Iraq war as a reason for the spread of jihad ideology, the newspaper reported.

 The estimate concludes that the radical Islamic movement has expanded from a core of Qaida operatives and affiliated groups to include a new class of self-generating cells inspired by al Qaidas leadership but without any direct connection to Osama bin Laden or his top lieutenants, the newspaper said.

 The New York Times cited more than a dozen US government officials and outside experts with knowledge of the classified document.

 It is the first formal appraisal of global terrorism by US intelligence agencies since the war began in March 2003 and represents a consensus view of the 16 US spy services.

 According to reports, this intelligence document should put the final nail in the coffin for President Bushs phony argument about the Iraq war, Democratic Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts said.

 The fact that we need a new direction in Iraq to really win the war on terror and make Americans safer could not be clearer or more urgent yet this administration stubbornly clings to a failed stay-the-course strategy.

 Some of the estimates conclusions confirm predictions in a January 2003 National Intelligence Council report that said a war in Iraq might increase support for political Islam worldwide, according to the newspaper.

 It also examines how the Internet has helped spread jihadist ideology, and how cyberspace has become a haven for terrorist operatives who no longer have geographical refuges in countries like Afghanistan, the newspaper said.

 The National Intelligence Council, the main strategic think tank for the US intelligence community, is in the early stages of preparing a new national estimate on Iraq.

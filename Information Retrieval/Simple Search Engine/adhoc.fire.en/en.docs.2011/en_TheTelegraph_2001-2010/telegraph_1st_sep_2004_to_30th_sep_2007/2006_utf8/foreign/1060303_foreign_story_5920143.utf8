 Bernal shot at direction

 Bernal: New challenges

 Mexico City, March 2 (Reuters): Mexican actor Gael Garcia Bernal will make his directing debut with a low-budget feature film that focuses on class differences in Mexico.

 Garcia Bernal will also star in the untitled drama alongside Camila Sodi, Luz Cipriota and Tenoch Huerta.

 We dont want to reveal too much about the story, said producer Pablo Cruz. But what I can say is that it explores in a comic way how two distinct social classes interact at a family get-together in a house near Mexico City.

 Filming will begin within two months in Tepoztlan, Mexico. A release date has not been set.

 Upstart shingle Canana Films, run by Garcia Bernal, his Y Tu Mama Tambien co-star Diego Luna and Cruz, will produce the drama.

 It has been quite an organic experience to start directing, Garcia Bernal said in an interview. Im discovering a new world.

 Gracia Bernal has also starred in the 2004 smash hit film Motorcycle Diaries.

 Cruz added that Canana is looking to make cost-efficient, socially minded pictures that depict a more realistic view of Mexico.

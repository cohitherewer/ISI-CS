 Blairs US tilt comes under glare

 London, Aug. 10: Is Tony Blairs pro-US foreign policy to blame for young British Muslims turning to terrorism in protest against his actions in Iraq and now in Lebanon?

 The Prime Minister and his government will reject any such charge but others will argue that there is a link.

 Security sources said today that execution of the plan to blow up to 10 passenger aircraft flying from the UK to the US was imminent and could have been mounted within a couple of days. Police will examine if any of the 21 arrested visited Pakistan and, if so, why.

 Speaking from his holiday home in the Caribbean, Blair praised the British security authorities for foiling the alleged plot though some Muslims will take convincing there was such a plot given that police shot dead an innocent man last year at an London underground station after believing he was a terrorist and shooting and injuring one of two Muslim brothers in a raid in East London earlier this year.

 Blair said: I would like to pay tribute to the immense effort made by the police and security services who, for a long period of time, have tracked this situation and been involved in an extraordinary amount of hard work. I thank them for the great job they are doing in protecting our country.

 He added: There has been an enormous amount of cooperation with the US authorities which has been of great value and underlines the threat we face and our determination to counter it.

 From the Indian point of view, he will be even more open to the suggestion that there are parallels between the near simultaneous attack on seven trains in Mumbai and the alleged plan to blow up to 10 aircraft over the Atlantic at the same time.

 At the political level, his Lebanon policy of aligning himself closely with the Americans has not gone down well with many members of his own party who want parliament, now in recess for the summer, to be recalled to discuss the new crisis.

 Some Muslim spokesmen are taking the line that while terrorism is to be blamed, the Blair and Bush policies are undermining the authority of the moderate Islamic leaders among Britains 1.6 million Muslims.

 Labour MP Mohammad Sarwar, who represents a Glasgow seat, said today on BBC Radio: President Bush and Tony Blairs policies are making it difficult for moderate Muslims to stand up to these extremists.

 Another Labour MP Shahid Malik, among the 150 who support a recall of parliament, said: We want to make sure that the representations made to us by our constituents are actually debated in the chamber of the House.

 Meanwhile, Muslims homes are being subjected to close searches by police looking for bomb making equipment or storage areas, as happened after the July 7 attacks last year. 

 Residents near a house which was raided by anti-terror police overnight were evacuated from nine properties today quot;as a precautionary measure quot;, police said. The nine homes are in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire.

 Muslim groups today reacted with a mixture of shock and scepticism.

 Khurshid Ahmed, a member of the Commission for Racial Equality in Birmingham where some of arrests took place, expressed relief that an attack had been foiled.

 quot;The response here is one of shock that we still find young people actively involved in activities which we would condemn as a society and also a sense of relief that a possible attack has been thwarted, quot; he said. 

 However, Fahad Ansari, of the Islamic Human Rights Commission, responded: quot;I think you will get cynicism from the community. Over the last few years we have seen many high profile raids like this plastered over the press to terrify the public. We have seen it time and time again. It has been hit and miss on too many occasions. It is causing a lot of mass hysteria. quot;

 He suggested: quot;There has been so much pressure on the government, it could be a way of diverting attention away from its policy on the Middle East. He (Blair) has to realise that there was a relationship between 7/7 and British foreign policy. quot;

 But unlike their counterparts in Mumbai, British police are not being allowed to target the Muslim community as a whole or harass ordinary Muslims about where they have travelled as part of a general fishing expedition. 

 London Mayor Ken Livingstone warned against any attempt to blame the Muslim community at large.

 quot;Only a united London can help defeat terrorism, which means that all Londons communities have their part to play, quot; he said. quot;No community in London can or should be targeted or blamed because of the actions of people who are pure criminals. quot;

 Tyson held for cocaine possession

 Scottsdale (Arizona), Dec. 29 (Reuters): Former heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson was arrested in Arizona today and charged with driving under the influence of drugs and possession of cocaine, police said.

 Tyson was arrested in Scottsdale, 16 km east of Phoenix, Arizona, after his black BMW nearly collided with a police vehicle, according to court documents.

 Mike admitted to possessing bags of cocaine and said he uses any time he can get his hands on it, the arresting officer said in court documents.

 Tyson appeared in court this morning and was freed on supervised release, meaning he has to regularly report to officials for drug and alcohol monitoring, until he appears in court again on January 16, Arizona court spokeswoman J.W. Brown said.

 Missing Pak scribe with US, says family

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Islamabad, April 13: As the Pakistani army launched a new anti-terror operation in the tribal region of North Waziristan, the family of a local journalist Hayatullah Khan, who disappeared last December, fear that he has been handed over to the US.

 Khans younger brother Ehsanullah, who has been in touch with military and civilian officials in North Waziristan and the North Western Frontier Province , today said a senior official had told him that Hayatullah is not in Pakistan.

 This lead us to believe that he has been handed over to the US, Ehsanullah Khan said. A high-level military official also told Ehsanullah that his brother had probably been handed over to the American forces.

 Hayatullah Khan, who worked for an Urdu-language newspaper and the European Pressphoto Agency went missing after he photographed what he claimed was a piece of an American missile that reportedly killed senior al Qaida leader Hamza Rabia on December 1 in Miran Shah, Waziristans regional headquarters.

 Pakistans authorities had claimed Rabia was killed while making an improvised explosive device.

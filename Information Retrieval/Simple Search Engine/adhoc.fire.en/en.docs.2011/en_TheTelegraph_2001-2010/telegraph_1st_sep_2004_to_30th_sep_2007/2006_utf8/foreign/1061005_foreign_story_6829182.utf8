 Scientists discover new class of planets

 Washington, Oct. 4 (Reuters): Astronomers have discovered a possible new class of planets outside the solar system that hug their parent stars so tightly that they take less than a day to complete an orbit.

 Astronomers working with the Hubble telescope have so far identified five possible planets that orbit their parent stars in as few as 10 hours, according to a paper to be published tomorrow in the scientific journal Nature.

 The objects appear to be low-density gas giants similar to Jupiter, orbiting stars smaller than the sun.

 About 200 planets have been discovered outside the solar system so far, including gas giants eight times closer to their parent stars than Mercury is to the sun.

 Those previously known planets take a longer time, between 1.2 days and 4 days, to orbit their stars. 

 Astronomers say they form farther out and are pulled closer by the stars gravity. Those pulled too close are burned up by their parent stars.

 Disruption risk exists: Gazprom

 Moscow, Jan. 3 (Reuters): Russias gas monopoly Gazprom said today that there was still a risk of supply disruptions to Europe if Ukraine continues to expropriate gas from the pipeline crossing its territory.

 Gazprom deputy CEO, Alexander Medvedev, said in an interview that the company could not go on forever compensating for supplies to Europe that are being stolen by Ukraine following a dispute with Russia over pricing.

 The second day of January was even worse than the first as they (Ukraine) have stolen more gas, he said.

 And I believe that we cant continue this situation forever especially if weather conditions change. 

 It will mean that the illegal offtake by Ukraine could increase dramatically.

 Ukraine has said that if temperatures, currently unseasonally mild, drop below freezing it will help itself to Russian gas. It denies taking any at the moment. There is still a danger that the situation could develop in such a way that we are not going to be in a position to compensate, Medvedev said.

 He noted that Russia had already agreed to boost supplies by 95 million cubic metres a day to meet the requirements of European customers who have complained over supply disruptions as a result of the dispute with Ukraine.

 I would like to stress that after the effect of stealing gas was confirmed not only by us but by international independent experts, we immediately took a decision to compensate the volumes of gas stolen.

 He said officials from Gazprom and Ukrainian state gas firm Naftogaz would meet later in in Moscow. But he made clear he considered Ukraine entirely responsible for the crisis.

 The real surprise is the kind of statement and behaviour we see from the Ukrainian side, he said. It is really more ... (appropriate) for gangster films than civilised society. He also rebuffed US criticism of what it said was Russias use of energy supplies as a political weapon against Ukraine, saying it would be more useful if it helped Ukraine understand the meaning of market economics.

 The dispute centres around Moscows demand that Ukraine pay full market prices for Russian gas ? $230 per 1,000 cubic metres instead of the current $50 price that is rooted in Soviet-era subsidies.

 Ukraine agrees in principle to pay the same as European consumers but says its weak economy cannot absorb such a big hike overnight.

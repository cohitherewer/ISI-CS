 Suu Kyi: The fight goes on

 Yangon, May 27 (Reuters): Myanmars military junta imposed another year of house arrest on Opposition leader and Nobel peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi on Saturday despite stiff international pressure for her release, a government source said.

 As her previous six-month term of detention expired, the former Burmas ruling generals quashed hopes the 60-year-old would be freed by stepping up security outside her home. 

 The source said a military official had visited Suu Kyi yesterday to discuss conditions the junta wanted to attach to her release ? in all probability restrictions on her freedom of movement.

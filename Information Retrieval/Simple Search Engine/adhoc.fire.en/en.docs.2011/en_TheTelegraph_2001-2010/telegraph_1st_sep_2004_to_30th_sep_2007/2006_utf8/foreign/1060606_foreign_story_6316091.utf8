 Fly cheap with pride, even a PM does so

 Blair: No frills

 London, June 5: Tony Blair sidestepped further criticism over his use of the Queens Flight as his personal holiday airline by returning from Italy on a scheduled flight on a low-cost carrier. 

 While the Prime Ministers previous family holiday flights to Italy cost taxpayers ?16,000 a time aboard a BAe 146 of the Queens Flight, the new-look, no-frills Blairs returned on Saturday on Ryanair Flight FR3009 with tickets costing ?49 a head. 

 Mr and Mrs Blair, who had met the Pope earlier in the day, did not have to suffer the usual budget airline indignity of scrambling for a decent seat as soon as the gates opened at Ciampino airport on the outskirts of Rome. 

 After all other passengers boarding the Stansted-bound Boeing 737 had been double-checked by security, Blairs eight-strong party was ushered to specially-reserved seats at the front of the plane. 

 The Blair party also avoided the usual Ryanair check-in rigmarole of having to arrive two hours before departure time. It is not known if they had to pay the recently-introduced charge of ?2.50 per bag for each piece of checked-in luggage. In Cherie Blairs case, this could have amounted to a small fortune. 

 Like everyone else on board they were entitled to take their own food on to the plane. Alternatively, Ryanair offered what they describe as a delicious range of snacks to buy, along with soft drinks, beer and spirits. 

 Adriano Franceschetti, a spokesman for Ciampino airport, said: I can confirm that Mr Blair and his party left Rome on a Ryanair flight. The plane was due to take off at 16.30 on Saturday but left at 16.55 ? a little bit of a hold up is to be expected, I suppose, when you have the Prime Minister as a passenger. 

 Other passengers on the flight were not informed of the Blairs presence. Lorenzo Pederzani, a Canadian holidaymaker, said: I didnt even know Mr Blair was on board until we landed at Stansted. 

I noticed a police car and an official limo 

waiting by the plane and saw him get off. He gave everybody a big wave as he went 

down the steps.

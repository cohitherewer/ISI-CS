 US sets term for talks with Iran

 Washington, June 7 (Reuters): The US today said that Iran would have to suspend nuclear enrichment throughout any negotiations as a condition for proposed talks with the Islamic republic over curbing its atomic programmes.

 State department spokesman Sean McCormack said suspension is a firm condition of the major powers offer to begin negotiations and that condition would have to hold throughout any potential negotiations.

 The suspension of all enrichment-related activity is at the core of what the international community is asking Iran to do, he added.

 McCormack refused to say if a proposal by six major powers to Iran includes a provision by which it might eventually be allowed to resume enrichment on its territory. 

 But western diplomats said the package of incentives presented to Iran this week leaves the door open to Tehran eventually resuming enrichment. They also outlined details of the offer, which was agreed on by the US, China, Russia, Britain, France and Germany and included for the first time a US offer to join European-led talks with Iran.

 The major powers proposal, which has not been made public, also offers to provide Iran with a new facility to stockpile nuclear fuel, deletes an earlier reference in a draft to guaranteeing Irans territorial integrity and proposes an informal regional security forum, the diplomats said.

 The US is leading an international drive to stop what it says is Irans pursuit of a nuclear weapon. Iran, which is an oil exporter, says its nuclear programmes are for peaceful power generation to meet the energy demand from its growing population.

 Germany said if Iran did suspend enrichment ? a key step to generating power or building a bomb ? then the major powers would be open to negotiating other terms of the offer.

 This is an offer to kick off negotiations but there must first be a suspension of (enrichment) activities implemented by Iran, German Chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters.

 Merkel urged Iranians to consider the offer seriously, which she said was an opportunity to secure a peaceful resolution to the years-long nuclear standoff. It is a broad and comprehensive offer. I believe it is a huge chance and I hope well do a bit of negotiating.

 Iran has said it sees some positive aspects in the proposal but needs time to review it.

 The powers want a response within weeks.

 Tiger roar: Time running out

 Kilinochchi (Sri Lanka), Jan. 3 (Reuters): Sri Lankas Tamil Tigers accused the army of infiltrating their areas and killing a senior rebel today in what they said was the most serious attack since a 2002 truce, and warned time was running out to avert war.

 The rebels themselves are widely suspected of a string of Claymore fragmentation mine attacks on security forces that have killed dozens and brought the ceasefire agreement to the brink of collapse. They deny that, but say the army used a similar method to attack them.

 They came through the jungle and laid a Claymore, head of the rebel political wing S.P. Thamilselvan said through a translator. We lost one of our senior cadres ? a major ? and a civilian. It is a very serious matter for us to consider.

 Asked if the rebels, who have fought for two decades for self-rule for the islands Tamil minority, might retaliate, he said: Our leadership must decide on things like that.

 There had been a rise in attacks on the Tigers in the last few weeks, he said. The military ? which blames the Tigers both for attacks on its troops and for inciting riots in the northern army-held Jaffna peninsula ? denied any involvement.

 This was in an uncleared area. We dont operate there, said military spokesman Brigadier Prasad Samarasinghe. 

 No army, navy or security forces personnel have gone to uncleared areas.

 In November, rebel leader Velupillai Prabhakaran said the government must offer concessions in 2006 or face the movement intensifying its struggle, seen as a threat to return to war. The two sides are unable even to agree a venue for talks.

 The rebels said the majority Sinhalese military had carried out a string of atrocities in government-held areas, ranging from firing at crowds to the rape and murder of a young woman and the burning of a family in their home.

 If the military decides to thrust a war on the people by escalating military violence ... and thereby create a situation whereby we cannot just be onlookers, that may be a very decisive moment where we have to make decisions to make sure the people are safeguarded, Thamilselvan said, without giving a timeframe.

 China vows to expand rights

 Beijing, Oct. 18 (Reuters): Chinas ruling Communist Party promised to expand citizens political rights as part of a programme to tame rising social conflict, but insisted the party must maintain control as it navigates turbulent change.

 The promises came in the Communist Party Central Committees decision on building a harmonious socialist society, which was approved by a meeting last week but released only today.

 We will implement democratic elections, decision-making, administration and oversight, and actively and steadily advance political system reform, said the decision.

 Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao and other leaders have said the one-party state will gradually open up elections for local government and party posts, but the document also spelled out the party will insist on maintaining control.

 Chinese citizens, who have tried to contest tightly controlled elections for local councils now under way, said the leaders promises counted little against constant restrictions and harassment by local officials.

 Chinas government always talks nice-sounding words but these policies arent implemented. Theyre empty promises, said Yao Lifa, a former school official in central Chinas Hubei province who has gained national renown for mobilising activists to fight local elections.

 I should know. Here I am trying to speak to voters, but wherever I go there are dozens of officials tailing me. Yao said he is trying to win a place on his local Peoples Congress, a largely ceremonial council filled with party members appointed through rarely contested votes.

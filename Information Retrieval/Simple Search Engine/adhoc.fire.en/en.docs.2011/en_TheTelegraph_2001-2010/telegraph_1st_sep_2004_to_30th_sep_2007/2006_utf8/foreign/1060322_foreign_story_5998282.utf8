 Bush warns Iran on Israel

 FRANCIS HARRIS

 Washington, March 21: President George W. Bush yesterday issued a stark warning to Iran when he said that Americas military would be ordered into action if Teheran carried out its threat to attack Israel.

 Using the most uncompromising language he has employed to date in dealing with Irans nuclear threat, Bush said: I see a threat in Iran. The threat is, of course, their stated objective to destroy our strong ally Israel. Ive made it clear and Ill make it clear again, that we will use military might to protect our ally Israel, Bush said to applause. 

 In his response to a question that followed a speech in Cleveland, Bush made clear that diplomacy was Americas preferred approach to Irans suspected nuclear weapons programme.

 But the pledge to defend Israel with force marked a vigorous response to a statement by Irans radical President, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who has stated that Israel must be wiped off the map. Bushs promise of force came as diplomats met to finalise the UNs first major diplomatic intervention against Iran. Bush was sending an unmistakable signal to Irans leaders in Teheran that any military or nuclear adventure will draw a swift response.

 Last night, Britains high-rise UN mission in the heart of Manhattan was at the centre of diplomatic efforts to persuade Iran to continue negotiations about its nuclear programme as the representatives of America, Russia, China, France and Germany arrived to discuss the next steps.

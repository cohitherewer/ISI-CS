 Nisha husband in help cry

 London, May 14 (Reuters): The husband of murdered part-time policewoman Nisha Patel-Nasri today appealed for anyone with information about her killer to come forward.

 The 29-year-old special police constable was off duty when she was stabbed to death outside her home in Wembley, northwest London, late on Thursday night.

 Her husband Fadi Nasri, 32, said any clues could help track down the murderer.

 Obviously, someone has got a guilty conscience. Theyll be worrying about what they have done, or be shocked, or maybe it was an accident or mistake, or whatever, he said.

 Someone has got to know something who lives around them, a neighbour, or seen some blood, or someone acting suspiciously or nervous. 

 It might not be important, but just give us a call and let us know.

 The couple were celebrating their third wedding anniversary the day she was killed.

 We had dinner, she told me to go out and play snooker. So I went, and before I even got there, I was called back, he said.

 Patel-Nasri was found in her nightclothes and police believe she may have come out of the house after hearing someone tampering with cars parked outside.

 A neighbour administered first aid but Patel-Nasri, who ran her own hairdressing business, died later in hospital from stab wounds to her leg.

 Police are looking for a hooded man seen running from the scene. They want to trace a young couple walking near Patel-Nasris house after the attack who told a passer-by they had seen a man running past them.

 Her brother Katen Patel, 33, had been due to marry this weekend and said his sister had organised much of his side of the ceremony. The wedding has now been cancelled.

 She had just been waiting for this day for years and years, he said. But the days here now, and shes not around, and Im not even thinking about the wedding, Im just thinking about her.

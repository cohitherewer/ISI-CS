 Senator remark on Indians catches fire

 Biden: In a soup

 Washington, July 8 (Agencies): Facing criticism, potential 2008 presidential candidate Joe Biden has been forced to explain his recent remark that you cannot go to a 7-Eleven or a Dunkin Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent.

 On the recent cable television network programme, Road to the White House, the Delaware senator is shown shaking hands with a man and boasting about his the support among Indian-Americans.

 Ive had a great relationship. In Delaware, the largest growth in population is Indian-Americans moving from India. You cannot go to a 7-Eleven or a Dunkin Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent. Im not joking, Biden said.

 The clip made its way through cyberspace this week and caught fire in Washington, where Biden is known as one of the more long-winded senators.

 Bidens office said the Senator admires, supports and respects the Indian-American community ? and also sought to explain his gaff. 

 The point Senator Biden was making is that there has been a vibrant Indian-American community in Delaware for decades. 

 It has primarily been made up of engineers, scientists and physicians, but more recently, middle-class families are moving into Delaware and purchasing family-run small businesses, said Margaret Aitken, a Biden spokeswoman.

 These families have greatly contributed to the vibrancy of the Indian-American community in Delaware and are making a significant contribution to the national economy as well, she said.

 His remarks came under fire especially from the Indian-American Republican Council which not only slammed his comments, but also made the point that a Republican lawmaker could not have got away making them.

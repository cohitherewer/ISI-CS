 UK criminals freed in error

 JOHN STEELE

 London, April 26: More than 1,000 convicted foreign criminals, including killers, rapists and child abusers, have been freed from prison without being considered for deportation and hundreds are missing, Charles Clarke, the home secretary, admitted yesterday.

 All the prisoners had committed crimes that should have triggered automatic assessment for removal from the country and the majority should have expected to be expelled. About 160 were released without being considered for removal despite explicit recommendations by judges that they should be deported at the end of their sentences.

 Such is the chaos in the system for dealing with foreign national prisoners that home office officials were unable to say last night whether they had found three foreign murderers ? who should be on life-long licence ? nine rapists and five paedophiles among the 1,023 prisoners released since 1999.

 Clarke said he regretted the fiasco, which also involved his department giving misleading information to MPs. 

 I take responsibility for it, he said. It is a shocking state of affairs. We are taking it extremely seriously but I dont think this is a resignation matter.The home office is still not sure what offences 103 of the prisoners were jailed for and says it does not know how many have re-offended since being freed.

 Senior police officers believe that cases of serious re-offending will almost certainly emerge when details of the missing criminals are given to them to check against their records.

 Only 107 of the 1,023 have been found and considered for deportation, leaving 916 outstanding.

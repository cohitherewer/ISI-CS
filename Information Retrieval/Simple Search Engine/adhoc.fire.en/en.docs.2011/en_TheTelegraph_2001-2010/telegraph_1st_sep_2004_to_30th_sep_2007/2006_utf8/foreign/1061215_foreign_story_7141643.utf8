 Harvard study

 Boston, Dec. 13 (Reuters): Harvard University said yesterday it had dropped a controversial proposal that would have required all undergraduates to study religion as part of the biggest overhaul of its curriculum in three decades.

 Efforts to revamp Harvards curriculum, which has been criticised for focusing too narrowly on academic topics instead of real-life issues, have been in the works for three years.

 A proposal for a reason and faith course requirement, which would have set Harvard apart from many other universities and made it unique among its peers in the elite Ivy League, was unveiled in a preliminary report in October. We have removed reason and faith as a distinct category, a faculty task force said in a revised report, excepts of which were obtained by Reuters. 

 Courses dealing with religion both those examining normative reasoning in a religious context and those engaging in a descriptive examination of the roles that religion plays today can be readily accommodated in other categories, it said.

 Harvard professor Louis Menand, who co-chaired the committee that drafted the plan, said religion competed with other, equally valid subjects. 

 It is an important subject but nationalism is an important subject, and race is an important subject and markets is an important subject, said Menand.

 Passengers foil Russia hijack

 Prague, Dec. 28 (Reuters): Passengers overpowered a Russian man who tried to hijack an Aeroflot plane today and the aircraft safely made an emergency landing in Prague, airline officials said.

 One of the passengers on board the Moscow-Geneva flight said he had an explosive device and ordered (the crew) to change course, Lev Koshlyakov, deputy general director of the Russian airline, said. 

 The Airbus A-320 flying from Moscow to Geneva made an unplanned landing in the Czech capital after the pilot declared an emergency on board. A drunk person was on board. He provoked a brawl with passengers, threatened to damage the plane and demanded that it change the course, Itar-Tass news agency said. Czech police added that the man was subdued on the plane.

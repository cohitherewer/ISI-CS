 Boss no to split

 New York, Aug. 29 (Reuters): Rock star Bruce Springsteen yesterday said he remains committed to his wife, singer Patti Scialfa, denying reports the pair have split.

 Due to the unfounded and ugly rumours that have appeared in the papers over the last few days, I felt they shouldnt pass without comment, he wrote in a posting that appeared on his website, www.brucespringsteen.net.Patti and I have been together for 18 years the best 18 years of my life.

 Springsteens statement came after a gossip item, published last Thursday in the New York Post and spread widely in the media, said the couple had separated.

 The Post reported that the musician, known as The Boss, had been spending time with a September 11 widow he met while helping organise a benefit concert for families of World Trade Center victims.

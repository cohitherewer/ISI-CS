 US leaders vulgar: Poll

 BEN FENTON

 Bush: Incompetent hypocrite

 London, July 3: Britons have never had such a low opinion of the leadership of the US, a YouGov poll shows.

 As Americans prepare to celebrate the 230th anniversary of their independence tomorrow, the poll found that only 12 per cent of Britons trust them to act wisely on the global stage. This is half the number who had faith in the Vietnam-scarred White House of 1975.

 Most Britons see America as a cruel, vulgar, arrogant society, riven by class and racism, crime-ridden, obsessed with money and led by an incompetent hypocrite.

 American troops are failing either to win hearts and minds in Iraq or bring democracy to that country.

 More than two-thirds who offered an opinion said America is essentially an imperial power seeking world domination. And 81 per cent of those who took a view said President George W Bush hypocritically championed democracy as a cover for the pursuit of American self-interests.

 A spokesman for the American embassy said that the polls findings were contradicted by its own surveys.

 We question the judgment of anyone who asserts the world would be a better place with Saddam still terrorising his own nation and threatening people well beyond Iraqs borders.

 With respect to the polls assertions about American society, we bear some of the blame for not successfully communicating Americas extraordinary dynamism.

 But frankly, so do you [the British press].

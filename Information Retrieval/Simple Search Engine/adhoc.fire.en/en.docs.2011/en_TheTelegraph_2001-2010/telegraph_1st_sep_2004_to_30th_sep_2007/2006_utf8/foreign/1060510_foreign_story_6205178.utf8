 I still love Cruise, says Nicole

 New York, May 9 (AP): Nicole Kidman says her divorce from Tom Cruise was a major shock ? and, she still loves him. 

 That was a major shock, the 38-year-old actress (in picture on left) says in an interview in the June issue of Ladies Home Journal.

 He was huge; still is. To me, he was just Tom, but to everybody else, he is huge. But he was lovely to me. And I loved him. I still love him, she tells the magazine.

 Cruise filed for divorce in February 2001 after 10 years of marriage, citing irreconcilable differences. The divorce was finalised later that year.

 I always knew the rug was going to be taken out from underneath me at some stage, Kidman says. I didnt think it was going to happen in the way it happened. I had seen my mother battle breast cancer, so I had a fear of my health being jeopardised ? that was really where I was thinking mine would come.

 I knew I was going to get hit with something. But I think a divorce, and the demise of what your family is, is a little death in itself.

 Cruise and Kidman adopted two children, Isabella, now 13, and Connor, now 11.

 I feel enormous love for whoever my childrens birth parents are, Kidman says. And if my children choose to go find them at some stage, I cant wait. Because ? its the weirdest thing ? I actually feel (theyre) very connected to us as a big, strange family, and whether they choose to search for them or not, who knows.

 The 43-year-old actors latest movie, Mission: Impossible III, debuted with $48.025 million this weekend, a solid opening yet well below industry expectations and almost $10 million lower than the franchises previous installment, according to studio estimates on Sunday.

 Katie Holmes, Cruises 27-year-old fiancee, gave birth to the couples first child, a daughter, Suri, last month.

 Kidman, who stars in the upcoming Fur, about photographer Diane Arbus, is reportedly dating country singer Keith Urban, 38.

 Im pretty careful about who I share my life with, she says. I surround myself with truthful, kind people, most of whom are not in the business. Its the life I want to have when Im an old woman with long, grey hair.

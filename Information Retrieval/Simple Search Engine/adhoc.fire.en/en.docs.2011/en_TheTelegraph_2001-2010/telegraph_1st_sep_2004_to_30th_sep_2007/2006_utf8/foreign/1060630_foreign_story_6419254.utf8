The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Cage $2m for child soldiers

 Cage

 Los Angeles, June 29 (AP): Nicolas Cage has donated $2 million (euro1.6 million) to help former child soldiers worldwide.

 The donation by the Oscar-winning actor will help provide shelters and medical and psychological rehabilitation services, said Larry Cox, executive director of Amnesty International USA.

 Cox accepted the donation yesterday at a UN conference in New York. Amnesty International will administer the funds.

 I understand that this pledge is not a solution for the problem, Cage, 42, said when he announced the contribution by video.

 Its my hopeful wish that todays discussions on this tragic subject at the UN conference may bring us closer to eradicating the nightmare of child soldiers.

 Cage said he has worked with Amnesty International for more than two years.

 The UN estimates there are at least 300,000 child soldiers participating in armed conflicts in the world today. Cage won an Oscar for his role in 1995s Leaving Las Vegas.

 His screen credits also include Adaptation and the coming World Trade Center.

 Cage has also starred in the hugely successful thriller The Rock with Sean Connery and Richard Harris.

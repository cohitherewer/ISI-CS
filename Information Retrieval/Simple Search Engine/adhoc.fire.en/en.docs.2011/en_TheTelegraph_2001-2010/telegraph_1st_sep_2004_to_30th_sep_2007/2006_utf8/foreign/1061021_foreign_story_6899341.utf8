 5 held for Pak rape 

 Karachi, Oct. 20 (Reuters): Pakistani police have arrested five men accused in a gang-rape case that has evoked comparisons with Mukhtaran Mai, a Pakistani rape victim who has become an icon for international womens rights groups.

 The men, accused of raping a 24-year-old university student in the same part of the central province of Punjab where Mai was raped, had their bail applications rejected by a court yesterday and were taken into custody.

 The accused carried out the rape after one of their own women eloped with a relative of the student, who belongs to a low caste family in a village 40 km from Multan.

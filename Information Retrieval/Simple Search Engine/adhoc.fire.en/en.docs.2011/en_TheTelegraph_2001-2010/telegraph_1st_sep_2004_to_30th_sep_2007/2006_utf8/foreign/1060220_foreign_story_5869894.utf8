 Fatwa nod to Iran N-strike

 COLIN FREEMAN AND PHILIP SHERWELL 

 Washington, Feb. 19: Irans hardline spiritual 

 leaders have issued an unprecedented new fatwa sanctioning 

 the use of atomic weapons against its enemies. 

 In yet another sign of Tehrans stiffening resolve 

 on the nuclear issue, influential Muslim clerics have for 

 the first time questioned the theocracys traditional 

 stance that Shariat law forbade the use of nuclear weapons. 

 One senior mullah has now said it is only natural 

 to have nuclear bombs as a countermeasure against 

 other nuclear powers, thought to be a reference to America 

 and Israel. 

 The pronouncement is particularly worrying because it has 

 come from Mohsen Gharavian, a disciple of the ultra-conservative 

 Ayatollah Mohammad Taghi Mesbah-Yazdi, who is widely regarded 

 as the cleric closest to Irans new President, Mahmoud 

 Ahmadinejad. 

 Nicknamed Professor Crocodile because of his 

 harsh conservatism, Ayatollah Mesbah Yazdis group 

 opposes virtually any kind of rapprochement with the West 

 and is believed to have influenced Ahmadinejads refusal 

 to negotiate over Irans nuclear programme. 

 The comments, which are the first public statement by the 

 Yazdi clerical cabal on the nuclear issue, will be seen 

 as an attempt by the countrys religious hardliners 

 to begin preparing a theological justification for the ownership 

 and if necessary the use of atomic bombs. 

 They appeared on Rooz, an Internet newspaper run by members 

 of Irans fractured reformist movement that picked 

 them up from remarks by Mohsen Gharavian reported on the 

 media agency IraNews. 

 Rooz reported that Mohsen Gharavian, a lecturer based in 

 a religious school in the holy city of Qom, had declared 

 for the first time that the use of nuclear weapons 

 may not constitute a problem, according to Shariat. 

 He also said: When the entire world is armed with 

 nuclear weapons, it is permissible to use these weapons 

 as a counter-measure. According to Shariat too, only the 

 goal is important. 

 Gharavian did not specify what kinds of goals 

 would justify a nuclear strike, but it is thought that any 

 military intervention by US would be considered sufficient 

 grounds. 

 Ayatollah Mesbah Yazdi has previously justified use of suicide 

 bombers against enemies of Islam and believes 

 that America is bent on destroying the Islamic republic 

 and its values. 

 The latest insight into the theocracys thinking comes 

 as the US signals a change in strategy on Iran, after the 

 decision earlier this month to report it to the United Nations 

 Security Council for its resumption of banned nuclear research.

 Kennedy murder survivor dies

 Connally

 Austin, Sept. 3 (AP): Nellie Connally, the former Texas first lady who was riding in President John F. Kennedys Limousine when he was assassinated, has died, a family friend said. The 87-year-old was the last living person who had been part of that fateful Dallas drive.

 Connally, had said the most enduring image she had of the November 22, 1963, assassination was of a mixture of blood and roses.

 Its the image of yellow roses and red roses and blood all over the car... All over us, she said in a 2003 interview. Ill never forget it.... It was so quick and so short, so potent.

 As the Limousine wound its way through the friendly crowd in downtown Dallas, Connally turned to Kennedy, who was in a seat behind her, and said, Mr President, you cant say Dallas doesnt love you.

 Almost immediately, she heard the first of what she later concluded were three gunshots in quick succession.

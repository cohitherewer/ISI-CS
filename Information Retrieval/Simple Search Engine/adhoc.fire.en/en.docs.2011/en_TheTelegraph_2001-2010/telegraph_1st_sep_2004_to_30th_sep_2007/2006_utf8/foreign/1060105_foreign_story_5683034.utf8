 Fine Print

 Home alone

 San Francisco, Jan. 4 (Reuters): A California couple left their five- and nine-year-old children home alone for the weekend while they went to gamble in Las Vegas.

 Police said the parents could be charged with child neglect. The couple went to Las Vegas on Friday, leaving the children cereal to eat and the fathers cellphone number to call in an emergency.

 Their apparent hope that, in the words of the citys tourism advertisements, what happens in Las Vegas should stay in Las Vegas went awry when one of their mothers called their home on New Years Eve and became concerned that no adult was present. 

 Gun game

 Vancouver (Reuters): Police in a Vancouver 

 suburb reminded residents on Tuesday it was not a good idea 

 to play with a loaded gun while using the bathroom, after 

 a man accidentally shot himself. A 21-year-old North Vancouver 

 man was facing numerous weapons charges after he shot off 

 one of his fingers while apparently playing with a gun on 

 New Years Day.

 Hit films

 Los Angeles (Reuters): The Writers Guild of America on Wednesday named its nominees for the years best screenplays, with the hit comedy The 40 Year-Old Virgin joining such Oscar hopefuls as Good Night, and Good Luck and Brokeback Mountain.

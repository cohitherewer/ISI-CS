 Naomi seeks dumb roles, big cheque

 New York, Dec. 22 (AP): Naomi Watts, who has tackled emotionally wrenching roles, has a love-hate relationship with the idea of starring in a romantic comedy.

 I look at those romantic comedies, and I see actors with perfect hair and six-packs, and I feel myself being numbed, and I get angry because I see so much money spent on these things, the 38-year-old actress says in an interview in Allure magazines January issue.

 I dont mean to sound righteous here, she continues. There is need for it, because there are times when I am in a hotel room and need to be numbed... I keep saying to myself: Oh, God, Im sick of playing these dark, harrowing roles. I want a big pay cheque, so put me in some dumb romantic comedy any day.

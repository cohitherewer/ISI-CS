 Royal eggs

 London, Sept. 23 (Reuters): Prince Charless aides today denied a report his staff have to cook him seven boiled eggs to allow him to choose one with the perfect consistency.

 A new book, On Royalty, says Charles enjoys a boiled egg after a days hunt but is fussy how long it is cooked. If the Prince felt No. 5 was too runny, he could knock the top off No. 6 or 7, author Jeremy Paxman said.

 But a spokesman for Char-les denied this though Paxm-an claimed the storys source was a friend of the royal heir.

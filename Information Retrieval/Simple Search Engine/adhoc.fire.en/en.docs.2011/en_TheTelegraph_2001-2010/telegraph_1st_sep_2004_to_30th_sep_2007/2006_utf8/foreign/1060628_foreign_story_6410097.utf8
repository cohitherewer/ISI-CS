 Moss in Burberry 

 London, June 27 (AP): Model Kate Moss is back as a face of Burberry, the fashion house that scrapped a campaign featuring her nine months ago, following tabloid accusations she used drugs.

 Moss, 32, appears in a white lace trench coat at the centre of Burberrys main autumn-winter 2006-2007 advertisement, one in a series of ads launched yesterday to celebrate the clothiers 150th anniversary.

 Shot in black-and-white against London cityscapes by photographer Mario Testino, the ad campaign features the Burberry family of British cultural icons and their offspring

 Burberry distanced itself from Moss in September, days after The Daily Mirror published pictures of her allegedly snorting cocaine.

 Pak cry for Pervez stepdown

 Islamabad, July 2 (AP): About 50 politicians from Pakistans largest Islamic political party are ready to resign to force President Pervez Musharraf to step down, an official said today, as dozens of party supporters staged a noisy rally in the capital.

 Chanting Musharraf! Resign, about 30 lawmakers, cabinet ministers from the North West Frontier province and about 100 supporters of the Jamaat-e-Islami gathered in downtown Islamabad. Jamaat-e-Islami ? Pakistans oldest and best organised Islamic party ? leads a six-member religious coalition that opposes Musharrafs alliance with Washington and has demanded he resign.

 The coalition made unexpected gains in parliamentary elections in 2002 mainly because of its opposition to Musharrafs support for the US-led war in Afghanistan that ousted the Taliban militia.

 Musharraf has also angered the coalition by reneging on a promise to step down as army chief by 2004.

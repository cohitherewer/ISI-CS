 New shark find

 Mexico City, March 3 (Reuters): A Mexican marine biologist has discovered a new shark species in the murky depths of Mexicos Sea of Cortez, the first new shark find in the wildlife-rich inlet in 34 years.

 Postgraduate student Juan Carlos Perez was on a fishing boat in early 2003 studying sharks from the Mustelus family netted at depths of 200 meters when he noticed some of them had darker skin and white markings.

 The sharks, slender, dark grey-brown and around 1.5 meters long, turned out to be a new species that Perez and his team have named Mustelus hacat, after the word for shark in a local Indian dialect.

 Perez studied around 40 of the sharks from 2003 to 2005. Perezs find is the first shark discovery in the Sea of Cortez.

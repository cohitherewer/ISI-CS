 UK faces probe over Saudi deal

 London, Dec. 16: Britain could face a corruption inquiry following the decision to halt the Serious Fraud Office investigation into a multi-billion pound Saudi arms deal, the worlds leading economic body warned last night.

 The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development signalled that it would mount an investigation as a defiant Tony Blair took full responsibility for the decision.

 Lord Goldsmith, the attorney-general, announced on Thursday that the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) was discontinuing its two-year probe into the Al Yamamah arms contract with BAE systems, a deal worth up to 150 billion. The SFO investigation was launched following allegations that middlemen had been paid millions of pounds from secret slush funds.

 But the Saudis threatened to cancel a 10 billion order for Typhoon fighters unless it was halted, threatening thousands of defence industry jobs.

 Last night, Prof. Mark Pieth, the chairman of the OECDs working group on bribery, said that he was very concerned about the decision to halt the probe into an alleged BAE slush fund.

 We need to ask the UK some questions. But I have to say, comments by Lord Goldsmith have not helped allay my concerns, he said. Prof. Pieth said he had been contacted by several members of the working group who had been alarmed at Britains move.

 While Lord Goldsmith admitted yesterday that he was uncomfortable about claims by Labour MPs that he had bowed to Saudi pressure, Blair delivered a robust defence of the decision. The Prime Minister said that he took full responsibility for advising Lord Goldsmith that it was not in Britains national interest for the inquiry to continue.

 Twins festival

 Twinsburg, Ohio, Aug. 6 (AFP): This tiny US town was seeing double this weekend as over 3,500 twins, triplets and quadruplets came to a place named after its twin founders for what event organisers call the largest gathering of twins in the world. 

 Twinsburg plays host to the twins festival every year. The city was founded in the early 1800s, and, according to local lore, two of its earliest settlers were twins who offered city leaders some of their land if they would rename the city Twinsburg.

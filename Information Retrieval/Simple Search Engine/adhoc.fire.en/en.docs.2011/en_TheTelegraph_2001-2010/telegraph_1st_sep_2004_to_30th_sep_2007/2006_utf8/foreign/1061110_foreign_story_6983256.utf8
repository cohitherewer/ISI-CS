 Lanka sinks Tiger boats

 Valachchenai 

 (Sri Lanka), Nov. 9 (Reuters): Sri Lankas 

 military said it sank 22 Tamil Tiger boats in a sea battle 

 today after what it said was a rebel attempt to sink a passenger 

 ship with 300 civilians aboard in a suicide attack.

 The military said air force jets and helicopter gunships were brought in after the rebels sank a navy fast attack boat. The Tigers accused the military of provoking the clash by attacking their vessels during exercises at sea. The clash off the islands northern tip came as thousands of Tamil refugees fled a camp in rebel territory in the restive east a day after the army bombed it, killing dozens of civilians.

 Many fear the worst violence since a now-battered 2002 ceasefire could turn into a full-blown return to a war that has killed well over 65,000 people since 1983. They tried to sink a passenger vessel. The navy sank eight boats, and then the air force sank another 14, military spokesman Brigadier Prasad Samarasinghe said.

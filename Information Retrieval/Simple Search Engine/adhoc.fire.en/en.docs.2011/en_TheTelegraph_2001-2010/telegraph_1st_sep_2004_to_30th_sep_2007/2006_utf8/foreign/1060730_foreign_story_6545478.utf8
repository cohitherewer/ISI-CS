 Rice to serve Israeli interests: Hizbollah

 Beirut, July 29 (Reuters): Hizbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said today that US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice aimed to impose conditions on Lebanon and to serve Israeli interests in her West Asia mission.

 Rice is returning to the region to try to impose her conditions on Lebanon again to serve her new West Asia project and to serve Israel, Nasrallah said in a televised speech.

 Rice arrived back in Israel today for talks on ending the conflict which has killed at least 469 people in Lebanon, most of them civilians. Hizbollah has killed 51 Israelis, some of them civilians killed in rocket attacks. Washington blames the conflict on Hizbollah, whose July 12 capture of two soldiers in a raid into Israel triggered the conflict.

 The Israelis are ready to halt the aggression because they are afraid of the unknown, Nasrallah said.The one pushing for the continuation of the aggression is the US administration.

 Rice, who dined with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert this evening, said she hoped for agreement on the main conditions for a ceasefire to be outlined in a UN resolution that could be tabled as early as Tuesday. I expect the discussions to be difficult, but there will have to be give and take, Rice said en route to Jerusalem. Israel rejected as unnecessary a UN plea for a three-day truce to aid civilians trapped by fighting.

 Nasrallah said his group would fire more rockets at central Israeli cities if Israels offensive in Lebanon was not halted. The guerrilla group yesterday launched rockets beyond the Israeli city of Haifa, fulfilling Nasrallahs pledge to hit targets beyond the port city.

 In todays fighting, an Israeli air strike killed a woman and six children in a house in the village of Nmeiriya.

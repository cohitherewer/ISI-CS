 Back, in skinny pants

 - Audrey 

reborn as saleswoman 

 ROBIN ABCARIAN 

 Los Angeles, Sept. 23: You just cant keep a good woman down. Audrey Hepburn has returned from the Other Side this month and is starring in an ad campaign for Gap, the struggling retailer that is pinning its hopes on the actress, who died of colon cancer in 1993. 

 She joins many dead colleagues Fred Astaire (Dirt Devil), John Wayne (Coors) and Humphrey Bogart (Diet Coke) in her posthumous marketing career. 

 The Gap spot is based on a clip from the 1957 film Funny Face. Hepburn (in picture) plays a clerk in New York who is discovered by a fashion photographer (Astaire) and whisked off to Paris to take the fashion world by storm. 

 In the ad, Hepburn, in a black turtleneck and black pants, is shown leaping from her chair in a Paris nightclub, exclaiming: I rather feel like expressing myself now. And I could certainly use the release. She starts a goofy Bohemian dance, then springs from the frame onto a white background. 

 Some love the spot; some are appalled that a dead Hollywood icon is being used to sell skinny black pants. A comment on ThirdWay Advertising Blog said: Its a desperate attempt by a desperate company to align itself with someone classy. 

 I wanted to like it, said another, but at the end was just too offended by the reincarnation of Audrey Hepburn as a pants salesman. 

 Gap, for its part, is happy just to be back on peoples minds. For the last two years, it has failed to excite customers who have fled elsewhere for inexpensive basics. Reviving a staple like the slim black pants could help revive its fortune. 

 Steven Levitt, whose Q scores measure recognition and the likability of celebrities, thinks the choice of Hepburn is excellent. 

 Every two years, his firm conducts a survey to determine the Q ratings of 168 dead celebrities. In the most recent one, Hepburn ranked in popularity behind only Lucille Ball and Katharine Hepburn. 

 If you started searching for a likeable female with strong recognition to a current female audience, said Levitt, Audrey Hepburn would be the first one youd come to.

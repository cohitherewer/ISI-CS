 Cops on toes close to 7/7

 BEN LEAPMAN

 Extra alert

 London, July 2: Thousands of police will mount a show of strength in central London this week on the first anniversary of the July 7 bombings. 

 Scotland Yard is on high alert against the possibility that Islamic extremists could strike a year to the day after the blasts, which left 52 innocent people dead. 

 Officers and dogs will be deployed at Underground stations, on the streets of the capital and at rail stations around the country. Commuters will be urged to report any suspicious activity. 

 Britain will mark the anniversary on Friday with a two-minute silence from noon which the queen will join in at a church service in Edinburgh. Tennis will be halted at Wimbledon. 

 Plaques will be unveiled at the bomb sites, and the families of victims will pay private visits. Later, 1,000 people will attend a ceremony in Regents Park where the London Gospel Choir will sing Something Inside (So Strong) and Bridge Over Troubled Waters. 

 Elevated policing levels have been maintained in London in the past 12 months, but all this week additional officers from the Metropolitan Police and British Transport Police forces will keep up an even higher presence. 

 In the days after the July 7 outrages, 6,000 officers were on daily duty across London to guard against the threat of a repeat attack. Andy Trotter, deputy chief constable of the transport police, said: The threat of an attack remains high. Our challenge is to make sure we renew and refresh our tactics. 

 Police said the aim of the mobilisation was to reassure the public rather than to counter any specific known threat. Analysis has shown that groups linked to al-Qaida do not usually attack on anniversaries. 

 A police source said: The Met has carried out a risk assessment based on what people know about the potential for a repeat attack. We will police to that risk. Theres a fine line between reassuring the public and scaring them.

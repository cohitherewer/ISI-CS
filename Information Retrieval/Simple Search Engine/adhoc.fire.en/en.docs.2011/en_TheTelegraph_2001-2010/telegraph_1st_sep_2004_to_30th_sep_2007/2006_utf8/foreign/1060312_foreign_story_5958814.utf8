 Belgrade, March 11 (Reuters): 

 Former Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic feared he was 

 being poisoned in his detention cell in The Hague, his lawyer 

 Zdenko Tomanovic said today hours after the tribunal announced 

 Milosevics death.

 Today, I have filed an official request to the tribunal to have the autopsy carried out in Moscow, having in mind his claims yesterday that he was being poisoned in the jail, Tomanovic said in The Hague.

 I demanded protection for Slobodan Milosevic over his claims that he was being poisoned. I still havent received any reply and thats all I have to say at this time, the lawyer said. Milosevic conducted his own defence at the war crimes trial.

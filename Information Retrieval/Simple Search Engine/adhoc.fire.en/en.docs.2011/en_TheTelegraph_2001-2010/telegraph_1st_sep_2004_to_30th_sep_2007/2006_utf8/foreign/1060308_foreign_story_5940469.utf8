 UK woman loses embryo battle

 Evans: Setback

 Strasbourg (France), March 7 (Reuters): An infertile British woman lost a legal bid today to have children using frozen embryos fertilised by her ex-partner, who does not want her to conceive with his offspring.

 The European Court of Human Rights rejected Natallie Evans submission that her human rights had been infringed by British court rulings which said her former fiance Howard Johnston was entitled to block her use of the embryos. Speaking after todays decision, Evans, 34, said she was disappointed and would seek to have the case re-examined. She also appealed to Johnston.

 I would still prefer not to use the courts. Howard may feel it is too late for him to change his mind, but it is not. Howard please think about it, she told reporters. Lets stop going through the courts and let me have what I want. 

 But at a separate news conference, Johnston said he was pleased with the European court decision.

 It seems that common sense has prevailed, he said.

 The key thing for me was just to be able to decide when, and if, I would start a family.

 Judges in both Britains high court and appeal court had said both the man and the woman must give their consent for the use of embryos right up until they are implanted. 

 Prior to the surgical removal of the ovaries, she and Johnston had IVF (in vitro fertilisation) and six embryos were created. They were later frozen and put into storage.

 The couple later separated and Johnston then withdrew his consent for the embryos to be used. He argued he did not want her to have his baby because he did not want the financial or emotional burden of being a father to a child he would not bring up.

 Legally, Johnston would have been responsible for any child that he was the biological father of because a parents obligation is to the child not the partner.

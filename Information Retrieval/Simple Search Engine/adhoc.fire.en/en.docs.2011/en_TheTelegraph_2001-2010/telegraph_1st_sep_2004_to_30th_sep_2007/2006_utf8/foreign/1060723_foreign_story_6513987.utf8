 Walk in space for $35 million

 Washington, July 22 (AP): You do not have to be an astronaut anymore to experience the out-of-this-world freedom of walking in space. All you need is $35 million and the willingness to risk your life.

 Space Adventures Ltd, a private Vienna, Virginia, firm that already has sent three men to the International Space Station for $20 million, yesterday said it is now offering an even rarer trip: a stroll outside the space station on a spacewalk for an extra $15 million.

 Its just the sort of feeling of freedom that you are your own satellite, said former Nasa spacewalker Kathy Thornton, who is on the firms advisory board. There are people who collect material things. There are people who collect experiences. For the people who collect experiences, yeah it is worth it.

 Working with the blessing of the Russian Space Agency, the company is arranging the first spacewalking tourist in orbit in about a year or so, chief executive officer Eric Anderson said.

 The trip would involve a launch in a Soyuz capsule, an eight-day stay aboard the space station with a 90-minute spacewalk in a Russian space suit. An extra month would be added to the normal six months of cosmonaut training for spacewalkers.

 The plan still needs the approval of the other 15 partners in the space station. Anderson said Russian space officials are confident they can get approval.

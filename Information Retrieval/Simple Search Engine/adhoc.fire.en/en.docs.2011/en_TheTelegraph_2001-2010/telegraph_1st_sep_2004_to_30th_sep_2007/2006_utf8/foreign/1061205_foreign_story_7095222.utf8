 Bushs UN envoy quits

 Bolton

 Washington, Dec. 4 

 (Reuters): US ambassador to the UN John Bolton announced 

 today he will give up his job in days after he was unable 

 to satisfy Senate opponents concerned he would pursue a 

 unilateral US foreign policy.

 Boltons attempt to hang on to his diplomatic post, already tenuous, became even more problematic after Democrats who had blocked his nomination won control of the Senate in November elections. 

 Bolton has held the job on a temporary basis.

 Bolton had a history of angering diplomats and colleagues in his previous state department job and could not gain sufficient support from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to stay on despite winning praise from some envoys at the UN.

 Surprising some White House officials still searching for a way for him to keep his job, Bolton submitted a resignation letter to President George W. Bush on Friday. Aides said Bush thought about it over the weekend before reluctantly accepting it. I am deeply disappointed that a handful of US Senators prevented ambassador Bolton from receiving the up or down vote he deserved in the Senate, Bush said.

 China court tightens death law

 Beijing, Oct. 31 (Reuters): Chinas supreme court reclaimed its right to final review of death sentences today, a step its chief justice said would mean better oversight of executions and help curb miscarriages of justice.

 Legal reformers had long sought an amendment to the countrys laws governing the court system to give the supreme court final review in capital cases. An amendment was approved by Chinas top legislature and the change takes effect from January 1.

 It will also give the defendants in death sentence cases one more chance to have their opinions heard, chief justice Xiao Yang said in comments carried by state media.

 China executes an estimated 5,000-12,000 people a year more than any other country but has been slowly reforming its death penalty system after a series of high-profile wrongful convictions that raised public anger.

 The top court relinquished its review power during a crime-fighting campaign in the 1980s, and local governments have resisted changes to the status quo, asserting that their right to impose the death penalty helped maintain order.

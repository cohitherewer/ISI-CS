 US to probe boasts about abuse of detainees

 San Juan (Puerto Rico), Oct. 14 (AP): The US army has been told to investigate possible abuse at the Guantanamo Bay prison after a Marine officer said she overheard guards boasting about abusing detainees, the Pentagons inspector generals office said yesterday.

 Lieutenant Colonel Colby Vokey, who represents a detainee at the US naval base in eastern Cuba, filed the hotline complaint last week, attaching a sworn statement from his paralegal, Sergeant Heather Cerveny, 23. In it, she described comments made by several guards in a bar at Guantanamo Bay. Several of them bragged about beating detainees and described it as common practice.

 Others were talking about how when they get annoyed with the detainees, about how they hit them, or they punched them in the face, Cerveny said during a telephone interview on Thursday night. It was a general consensus that I (detected) that as a group this is something they did. That this was OK at Guantanamo, that this is how the detainees get treated.

 Cerveny visited the US naval base in Cuba last month and said she spent an hour with the guards at the military club. 

 The guards quit discussing beating detainees after finding out she works for a detainees legal team.

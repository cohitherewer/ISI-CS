 UK radical wanted caliph in White House

 Al-Masri: Abusive

 London, Jan. 11 (Reuters): Muslim cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri wanted a caliph sitting in the White House and said Hitler was sent into the world because Jews were blasphemous and dirty, a London court heard today.

 Hamza, 47, is the most high-profile figure to go on trial in Britain on charges of incitement to murder and stirring up racial hatred since the September 11, 2001, attacks on Washington and New York. Interest in the case has increased since suicide bombings on Londons transport system last July killed 52 people.

 Prosecutor David Perry said the Egyptian-born cleric used public meetings at the Finsbury Park mosque in north London and private meetings to incite his followers to kill non-Muslims.

 The prosecution case is, in one sentence, that Sheikh Abu Hamza was preaching murder and hatred in these talks, Perry told the Old Bailey court.

 He makes calls for a world dominated by a caliph, sitting, as he puts it, in the White House, Perry said.

 In one of his lectures, he accused the Jews of being blasphemous, treacherous and dirty. This, because of their treachery and their blasphemy and their filth, was why Hitler was sent into the world, Perry said.

 Hamza faces nine counts of using public meetings to incite his followers to kill non-Muslims and four other charges that he urged the killing of Jews.

 He is also accused of using threatening, abusive or insulting behaviour with intent to stir up racial hatred, along with one charge of possessing threatening, abusive or insulting sound recordings, and another count under anti-terrorism laws.

 Hamza has denied all the charges.

 The charges relate to nine video tapes seized when Hamza was arrested on May 27, 2004. Eight were at his home and one was at another address. The tapes were among 2,700 audio and 570 video tapes seized.

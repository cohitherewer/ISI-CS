 Maoists tax Polish hikers

 Mount Everest: Pay and climb

 Kathmandu, March 27 (Reuters): Four Polish hikers out of contact since last week were safe after being stopped by Maoists in eastern Nepal and forced to spend a night in a remote village because they refused to pay a rebel tax, one of the group said today.

 Speaking from Lukla, a popular village among trekkers heading for Mount Everest base camp, Wojciech Mysiara, a sociologist from the Polish city of Torun, said they had not been kidnapped and had been allowed to continue their trek after paying 20,000 Nepali rupees ($280).

 About seven or eight rebels stopped us in a village called Bhandara and asked us for a donation, Mysiara said.They were carrying guns and had hand grenades. They told us that if we didnt pay them we couldnt go on.

 They refused and had to sleep in the village, Mysiara said, admitting the four had been very scared. The next day they paid and were allowed to leave. They plan to continue their trek towards Everest. Bhandara is about 100 km to the east of Kathmandu, and about half way to Lukla.

 They are all safe and have reached Lukla, Ang Tshering Sherpa, president of Nepal Mountaineering Association, had said earlier.

 Nepals Maoist rebels have a strong presence in the Lukla area but have said their policy is not to harm foreign tourists, a key source of income for the impoverished but scenic nation. The Maoists, however, have collected tax from visitors.

 Along with Mysiara was Marzena Staniszewska ? both of whom had come to attend a conference on the international Esperanto language ? and two other Polish trekkers, named as Konrad Kakolewski and Maria Los.

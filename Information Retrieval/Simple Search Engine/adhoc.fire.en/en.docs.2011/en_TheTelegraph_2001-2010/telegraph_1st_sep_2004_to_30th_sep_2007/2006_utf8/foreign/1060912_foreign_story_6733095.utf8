 Pak caves in to hawks

 - Retreat on rape law

 Law minister Mohammad Wasi Zafar

 Islamabad, Sept. 11 (Reuters): Pakistans ruling party has given in to the demands of religious conservatives opposed to the amendment of Islamic laws that would have taken rape out of the sphere of religious law.

 A bill to amend the Islamic laws, including the one that requires rape victims to produce four male witnesses or risk an adultery charge, has been fiercely opposed by the conservatives.

 Womens rights activists had welcomed the proposed amendments, that would have put the crime of rape in the penal code, although some said the changes did not go far enough and the Islamic laws should be repealed altogether.

 But in the face of the objections from religious parties, the government said today rape would remain in the Islamic law, although it would also become a crime under the penal code. 

 If there are four witnesses it will be tried under (Islamic law), if there are not, it will be tried under the penal code, said law minister Mohammad Wasi Zafar. In the case of both adultery and rape, the judge will decide how to try the case, he said.

 Bangkok, Feb. 18 (Reuters): French President Jacques Chirac today urged calm over the likely first outbreak of the deadly H5N1 bird flu strain in France, Europes biggest poultry producer.

 Farm minister Dominique Bussereau said it was to 98.8 per cent sure that a duck found in eastern France had died of the H5N1 strain, which is transmissible to humans. .

 Chirac, on a trip to Thailand, said the government would be vigilant and ready to act on a possible outbreak.

 It is a situation which we have to take with calm, but which also has to be taken very seriously, Chirac told a news conference in Bangkok.

 Several wild ducks were found dead on Monday near Lyon in a region famous for the quality of its chickens. Test results for one of the ducks showed the presence of bird flu, the H5 virus, and tests for the H5N1 strain were underway, Bussereau said.

 The pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus has spread from Asia to Europe and Africa, infecting 169 people and killing at least 91 and leading to the destruction of millions of birds.

 Scientists fear that if the virus acquired the ability to easily pass from person to person, it could cause a pandemic that would kill millions.

 Bussereau said bird flu would be a major topic of debate during a meeting of EU farm ministers in Brussels on Monday. France would seek to increase some export help to its chicken farmers, he said, without giving details.

 Earlier this week, France extended its ban on keeping poultry outside to the whole of the country, saying there was a higher risk from bird flu following recent cases in Europe.

 The government has already banned feeding poultry outside across the whole country.

 In Cairo, the Egyptian government today that it had advised people who breed poultry at home to get rid of them to prevent the spread of bird flu, which was diagnosed in seven chickens in Egypt on Thursday.

 Prime Minister Ahmed Nazif said in a statement:The time has come to get rid of the idea of breeding chickens on the roofs of houses, especially under current circumstances.

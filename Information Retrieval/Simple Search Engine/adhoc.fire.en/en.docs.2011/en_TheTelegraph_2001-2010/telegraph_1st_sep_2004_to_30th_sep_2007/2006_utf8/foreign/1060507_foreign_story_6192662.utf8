 Goss silent on resign reason

 Washington, May 6 (Reuters): Porter Goss said today the reason for his abrupt resignation as CIA chief after less than two years on the job would remain a mystery, while the White House denied that President George W. Bush had lost confidence in him.

 As Goss left his home today on his way to give a commencement address in Ohio, he declined to comment on his resignation from the CIA, telling CNN that its one of those mysteries.

 Goss had come under fire inside and outside the agency during a difficult tenure, and several career intelligence officers had left after clashes.

 The White House denied a report in the Washington Post that cited senior administration officials as saying that Bush had lost confidence in Goss and had decided to replace him months ago.

 Reports that the President had lost confidence in Porter Goss are categorically untrue, White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said aboard Air Force One as Bush travelled to Oklahoma State University to deliver a commencement address.

 Porter Goss played a key role in keeping the focus on winning the war on terror and helped transform the agency to meet the challenging times were living in and the times ahead.

 Administration officials told CNN yesterday that Air Force General Michael Hayden, principal deputy director of national intelligence, would replace Goss. Sources also told The New York Times and Time magazine websites that Hayden was a leading candidate for the post.

 Perino declined to comment on a replacement but said an announcement would be made soon.

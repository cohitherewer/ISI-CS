 Nepal peace setback

 Kathmandu, 

 Nov. 26 (Reuters): A peace process aimed at ending 

 Nepals decade-old Maoist insurgency suffered a setback 

 today when government and rebels failed to finalise an interim 

 constitution and parliament as agreed in a landmark pact.

 Earlier this month, the two sides agreed to set up an interim constitution and form a provisional parliament on November 26. They also agreed to set up an interim cabinet to allow the rebels to join the mainstream government on December 1.

 But both parties now say they are running behind their ambitious timetable which was agreed on November 8.

 We suspect there could be some moves to delay the entire peace process, senior Maoist leader Dinanath Sharma, a rebel negotiator, said.

 From our side we are ready, but the government is slow with the interim constitution and parliament which should be the main focus now after the peace deal has been signed.

 This indicates that the formation of the interim government may also be delayed, Sharma added.

 Tourism minister Pradip Gyanwali, a government negotiator, said authorities were busy discussing the modalities of arms with the Maoists and the UN, who will supervise the management of weapons on both sides.

 Playboy refutes Alba claim

 Los Angeles, March 4 (Reuters): Playboy wont pull its March issue over actress Jessica Albas claim that she was made an unwitting cover girl to fool readers into thinking she is nude inside, the magazine said yesterday.

 Playboy has done nothing wrong, so there is no reason to pull our issue off of newsstands, spokeswoman Lauren Melone said. Alba accuses Playboy of violating her rights and misleading the public by getting a publicity photo from her 2005 movie Into the Blue from Sony Pictures and running it on the cover ? complete with a bunny logo superimposed on her bikini top.

 Lawyers for Alba, 24, have threatened to sue Playboy unless the issue was pulled off the stands and demanded that the Fantastic Four star be compensated for damage to her image.

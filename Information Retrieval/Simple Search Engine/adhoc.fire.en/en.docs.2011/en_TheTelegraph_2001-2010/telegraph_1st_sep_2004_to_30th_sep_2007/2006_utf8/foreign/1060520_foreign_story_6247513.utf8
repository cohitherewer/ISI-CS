 Spears stumble

 New York, May 19 (AP): Britney Spears stumbled outside a Manhattan hotel, nearly dropping her 8-month-old son and further fuelling the ever growing media scrutiny of her parenting skills.

 photos splashed across the front page and inside the New York Post today, the 24-year-old pop star is shown exiting The Ritz Carlton hotel with Sean Preston in one hand and a glass in the other.

 As her bodyguards walked Spears to her car, her long pants got tangled in her open-toed shoes as she stumbled. Sean Prestons head was flung backwards, knocking off his orange hat.

 Spears, though, was able to keep her balance and hold on to her son, with help from a bodyguard, who reacted quickly.

 Rude shock

 Nicosia (Reuters): A raccoon suffered 

 an 11,000 volt electric shock when it scampered up a pylon 

 in Cyprus but escaped with burns. The nocturnal mammal triggered 

 a two hour power outage at the town of Aradippou in southeast 

 Cyprus after it scaled the pylon. It was captured with a 

 net and has been impounded by vets as an illegal import.

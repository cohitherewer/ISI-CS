The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 After Sex, Parkers priority is family

 Parker: Just reward

 New York, Sept. 9 (Reuters): 

 Actress Sarah Jessica Parker, once the poster girl for style 

 and single women in New York, says theres something 

 in her life that takes higher priority than the latest designer 

 fashions her family.

 Parker, 41, soared to international stardom as newspaper columnist Carrie Bradshaw in the hit cable television series Sex and the City, which made her into a fashion icon, with fans copying her on- and off-screen clothes and accessories.

 The HBO show about the friendship and sex lives of four single, working women in New York ran from 1998 to 2004 and spawned scores of fads, made shoe designer Manolo Blahnik famous in middle America, and landed Parker on Vogues cover.

 But while New York is abuzz over its annual fashion week, which runs from September 8-15 this year, Parker says her family is her top priority and she wont be attending any shows.

 I dont have time. My son starts school this week and I have to take him every day, Parker said, talking about her 3-year-old son James with actor husband Matthew Broderick. Broderick, 44, broke his collarbone recently in a riding accident while on vacation in Ireland.

 Hes OK but he is (without) one arm. Its hard to get my son dressed and out of the door ... so I have a great excuse not to attend any fashion shows. In real life Parker is Carrie-like, with her mane of curly hair, red stiletto sandals and a lacy, silver designer dress. 

 But she said she has treaded carefully in endorsing products. Since Sex and the City ended, Parker starred briefly in an advertising campaign for the Gap clothing store and last year produced a signature perfume called Lovely.

 I have had lot of opportunities and continue to ... but I am very good at saying no, she said at a store in New York to present a new line of Lovely products. I am not particularly swayed by money because I dont think it is the reward I am looking for.

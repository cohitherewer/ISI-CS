 Lanka in new Tiger attacks

 Kilinochchi (Sri Lanka), June 16 (Reuters): Sri Lankas air force bombed around the Tamil Tiger rebel headquarters for a second night today as the victims of a civilian bus ambush were buried.

 Jets raided areas near the de facto rebel capital Kilinochchi at first light, but attacks then ceased apparently while the funerals of the 64 killed in yesterdays suspected Tiger attack were held. Witnesses said bombing resumed at nightfall.

 The bombers came back, said a Kilinochchi security guard who did not give his name. They bombed away from the town. Three to four bombs.

 An aid worker sheltering in a bunker said they had also heard an explosion, but did not manage to count the number of bombs.

 Military sources said the air raids were aimed at a rebel airfield south of Kilinochchi.

 The air strikes were the heaviest since a 2002 ceasefire halted a two-decade long war which killed more than 64,000 people. The attack on the packed bus in a remote area near rebel territory was also the worst since the truce.

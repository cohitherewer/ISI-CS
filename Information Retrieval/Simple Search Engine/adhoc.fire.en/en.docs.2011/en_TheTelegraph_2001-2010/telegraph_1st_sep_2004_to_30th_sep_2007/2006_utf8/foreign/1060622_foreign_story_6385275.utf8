 Mafia on its knees after Sicily dawn raids

 MALCOLM MOORE 

 Rome, June 21: The heads of 16 Mafia families were arrested in Sicily yesterday in a move that police said would decapitate the Cosa Nostra.

 In a series of dawn raids, 45 men were arrested and charged with Mafia association and extortion. A further seven are being hunted.

 A spokesman for the police in Palermo said 500 officers had been involved in the four-year operation. Clues were pieced together from thousands of hours of bugged conversations between alleged Mafia bosses that took place inside a garage in Palermo used as a hide-out.

 The recordings revealed a new map of the structure of the Mafia and showed how the mob held Palermo tightly in its grip. Further evidence was gathered from a series of typewritten notes found at the lair of Bernardo Provenzano, the former boss-of-bosses who was captured in April near Corleone.

 Piero Grasso, the head of Italys anti-Mafia department, said: After this mornings arrests and the capture of Provenzano we can definitely say that the Mafia, at this moment, is on its knees. 

 He added that a particular triumph was the capture of a powerful triumvirate who stood behind Provenzano and who took charge of the organisation after his arrest. 

 Antonino Rotolo, 60, from Corleone, was the head of the territory around Pagliarelli, and has previously served time for a series of murders. Although he was placed under house arrest on grounds of poor health, the investigators believe that he was Provenzanos likely successor.

 The other two men were Francesco Bonura, 64, and Antonino Cin?, a 61-year-old doctor who attended to Provenzano and to Salvatore Toto Riina, the former Mafia boss who was convicted of more than 100 counts of murder in 1993.

 We had to move quickly. A new Mafia war was set to begin, said Grasso, explaining that a power struggle was about to break out over who would become the new Godfather.

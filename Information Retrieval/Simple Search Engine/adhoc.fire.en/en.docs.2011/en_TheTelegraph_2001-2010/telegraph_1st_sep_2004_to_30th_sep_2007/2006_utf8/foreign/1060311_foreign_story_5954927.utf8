 Osama kin in reality show

 Dafour: Music quest

 New York, March 10 (Reuters): Osama bin Ladens niece, an aspiring singer who posed for a sexy photo shoot in a mens magazine last year, has signed up for a reality television show about her life and her as yet unfulfilled quest for stardom.

 Wafah Dufour Bin Ladin, whose mother was married to the al Qaida leaders half brother, was born in California but lived in Saudi Arabia from the age of three to 10.

 I understand that when people hear my last name, they have preconceived notions, but I was born an American and I love my country, Dufour said. Dufour has dropped the Bin Ladin and now goes by the name Wafah Dufour. Dufour has been promoting herself as a musician and last December appeared in a sultry GQ photo spread.

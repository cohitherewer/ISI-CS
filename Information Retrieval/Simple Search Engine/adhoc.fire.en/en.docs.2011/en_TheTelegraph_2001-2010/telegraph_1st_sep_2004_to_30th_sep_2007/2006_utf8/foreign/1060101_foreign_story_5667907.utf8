 Pak madarsa breather

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Islamabad, Dec. 31: Pakistan has decided to extend the deadline for registration of Islamic seminaries that was set to expire today.

 We will extend the deadline following a formal request from the Ittehad Tanzimat Madaris Deeniya (ITMD), an umbrella organisation representing all Islamic seminaries, said Vakil Ahmad Khan, secretary of the religious affairs ministry, in Islamabad.

 He said the government wanted to carry forward the registration process in a smooth fashion. It has been decided that the ITMD will appoint coordinators to interact with the government on registration of seminaries, he added.

 President Pervez Musharraf had set December 31 as the deadline for over 13,000 seminaries to register with the government. He also directed them to expel all foreign students ? mostly from Afghanistan, Central Asian republics and South East Asian and African countries.

 Interior ministry officials said 65 per cent of approximately 1,800 foreign students left Pakistan in the last six months, fearing a crackdown.

 Vakils remarks came on the backdrop of an announcement made by interior minister Aftab Ahmad Khan Sheropao that his government was not cancelling visas of the foreign students but they should leave the country as soon as possible.

 Analysts believe the decision not to expel the remaining foreign students was aimed at preventing renewed confrontation with the Islamic seminaries.

 Officials of the home department of Pakistans Punjab province on Wednesday said they would launch an operation against 81 seminaries teaching foreign students.

 The ITMD, however, fears that any operation against foreign students would hamper the registration process. Operation against foreign students will affect the registration process, ITMD convener Qari Hanif Jullandhry told reporters in Islamabad.

 Under the amended registration law, seminaries are required to reveal their sources of financing, be ready for annual audits, and refrain from preaching hate materials.

 Many moderate seminaries registered themselves after the government made some changes in the law, but most of the schools still have reservations about the law.

 Officials in the religious affairs ministry said up to 2,400 seminaries had been registered since the promulgation of the amended law in August. 

 Most religious and political organisations, many of whom also run seminaries, accuse Musharraf of following a US-led agenda against them under the cover of the war against terrorism. 

 Musharraf also survived two attempts on his life in the garrison town of Rawalpindi two years ago, which observers believe were masterminded by the elements unhappy with his outright support to the US.

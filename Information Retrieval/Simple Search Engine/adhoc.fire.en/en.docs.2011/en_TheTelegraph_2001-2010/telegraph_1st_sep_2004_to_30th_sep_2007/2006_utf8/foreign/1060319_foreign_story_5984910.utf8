 Cruise irked by TV satire

 Cruise: Impossible

 Los Angeles, March 18 (Reuters): Tom Cruise threatened to boycott promotion of his upcoming Paramount Pictures film unless a sister cable TV network pulled a South Park re-run lampooning the Church of Scientology, industry sources said yesterday.

 Representatives for Paramount and Cruise, a prominent Scientologist, denied he made any such threats or had anything to do with the Comedy Central network cancelling plans to air a repeat of the South Park episode titled Trapped in the Closet, on Wednesday. Trey Parker and Matt Stone, creators of the crudely animated cartoon hit, issued a quirky statement, filled with references to Scientology and the science-fiction writings of church founder L. Ron Hubbard, suggesting Scientology was behind the scheduling change.

 So, Scientology, you have won THIS battle, but the million-year war for Earth has just begun, the pair wrote.

 Temporarily anozinizing our episode will NOT stop us from keeping Thetans forever trapped in your pitiful man-bodies. Curses and drat! You have obstructed us for now, but your feeble bid to save humanity will fail! Hail Xenu!!!

 Instead of the Tom Cruise episode, the network aired reruns of two South Park episodes featuring the character Chef, voiced by veteran soul singer Isaac Hayes.

 Comedy Central, which like Paramount is owned by Viacom Inc., declined comment on the re-run switch, other than to say: In light of the events of earlier this week, we wanted to give Chef an appropriate tribute by airing two episodes he is most known for. Two industry sources familiar with the situation said Comedy Central pulled the episode after Cruise threatened to cease promotion of his upcoming Paramount film, Mission: Impossible III.

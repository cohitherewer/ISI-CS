 Virginia false alarm

 Ceredo (West Virginia), Aug. 18 (AP): A Pakistani woman whose daughters carry-on luggage caused an airport to shut down for nine hours says it was her ethnic background, not a few bottles of suspicious liquids, that set off security officials.

 Initial laboratory testing by the FBI turned up no evidence of explosive materials in the bottles carried at Tri-State Airport in West Virginia by Rima Qayyum, a 28-year-old Pakistani woman dressed in the traditional Islamic headcover. No charges were filed against the woman, who was never detained and was cooperative when interviewed by the FBI.

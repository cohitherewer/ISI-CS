 Israel, Palestine zero in on peace talks

 Olmert and Abbas: 

 Patch-up bid 

 Ramallah, West Bank, Sept. 10 (Reuters): Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas today said he was ready to meet Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert as soon as possible to resume long-stalled peace negotiations.

 Olmert, who voiced a willingness yesterday to hold talks with Abbas, told the Israeli cabinet it was time to create a new horizon with the Palestinians, officials said.

 I stand fully ready to meet the Prime Minister... without prior conditions and we are ready to begin immediately the preparations for this meeting, Abbas told a news conference with visiting British Prime Minister Tony Blair.

 But Olmert has made clear there could be no progress towards peace unless the Palestinians meet their obligations under an internationally-backed road map that calls for the dismantling of armed groups, such as the governing Hamas movement.

 Israel also has failed to carry out its commitments under the peace plan, including a construction freeze in Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank.

 Signs of movement in West Asia peacemaking could give Blair a political boost as he grapples with an unpopular war in Iraq and feuding in the ruling party, which forced him to concede this week that he will leave office within a year.

 I, like you, do believe there is a window of opportunity here, Blair said after talks with Abbas in Ramallah, welcoming the prospect of a meeting between the Palestinian leader and Olmert.

 Blair voiced support for Abbass efforts to reach an agreement with Hamas on a unity government in a bid to ease international pressure on the Palestinian Authority.

 I believe that such a government, based on the Quartet requirements, does offer the possibility of re-engagement by the international community, Blair said.

 The Quartet of peace brokers the US, the European Union, the UN and Russia have cut aid to the current Hamas-led government, demanding it recognise Israel, renounce violence and accept past interim peace deals.

 And I would like to say that so far as Im concerned, that if such a (unity) government is formed, then I believe that is right that the international community deal with such a government, Blair said.

 Like theme, Gibson career in balance

 Mel Gibson

 Los Angeles, Dec. 9 (Reuters): Apocalypto, Mel Gibsons first film since his anti-Semitic tirade last summer, opened yesterday as Hollywood wondered whether his career, like the Mayan civilization the movie depicts, is doomed to collapse or poised for resurrection.

 Ushered into a crowded holiday-season marketplace with largely favourable reviews and ample media buzz, Apocalypto has defied easy predictions by industry analysts seeking to forecast its commercial potential.

 We have to see whether all this awareness translates into box office. Its tough to call, said Paul Dergarabedian, president of box-office tracking firm Media By Numbers, who put the films likely US gross at between $13 million and $17 million through Sunday.

 Such a tally would pale in comparison to the $84 million gross of Gibsons last movie, The Passion of the Christ, in 2004. But in a weekend when multiplexes are bustling with many big box-office contenders, an opening in the mid-teens may be enough to rank as No 1.

 As a hyperviolent, R-rated movie with subtitles and a cast of unknown performers, the movie hardly fits the profile of a typical Hollywood blockbuster.

 Many reviews have praised Apocalypto as a gripping and visually spectacular work, though one with an exceedingly high quotient of blood and guts.

 Film critic Joe Morgenstern of the Wall Street Journal yesterday called it the most obsessively, graphically violent film Id ever seen. But he went on to hail it as a visionary work with its own wild integrity. Yet he added: Seeing it once is enough for one lifetime.

 The film is also vying for attention against several other releases this weekend, including action thriller Blood Diamond, starring Leonardo DiCaprio, and romantic comedy The Holiday, with Kate Winslet and Cameron Diaz.

 And all those films face formidable competition from the ongoing successful runs of Casino Royale and Happy Feet.

 What Apocalypto has going for it is an aggressive marketing campaign by distributor Walt Disney Co, with special attention paid to Spanish-language media, and intense hype surrounding the films pedigree as the latest work produced, directed and co-written by the Oscar-winning Gibson.

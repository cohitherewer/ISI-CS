 First female pilots join all-male Pak force

 Risalpur (Pakistan), March 31 (AP): With ceremonial pomp and aerial acrobatics, Pakistan today welcomed the first four female pilots into its air force at a grand parade watched by the Islamic nations number two general.

 Saba Khan, Nadia Gul, Mariam Khalil and Saira Batool were among 36 aviation cadets who received their wings after three and a half years of intensive training, breaking into an all-male bastion of Pakistans armed forces.

 I want to fly fighter jets and prove that girls can equally serve our country in the best possible manner as men are doing, flying officer Gul, 22, said after graduating from the air forces elite training academy in the northwestern town of Risalpur.

 General Ahsan Saleem Hayat, vice-chief of army staff, said the four had shown the spirit and courage to rise above the ordinary and break new ground for others to emulate.

 Carrying rifles and dressed in the same blue uniform as their male colleagues ? except for a tunic flapping over their navy blue trousers, and one wearing a headscarf ? they paraded before hundreds of family members and diplomats, and took the military oath. Standing in front of a T-37 training jet, Batool described her training as tough but very thrilling. The four women are the first female pilots in the 58-year-history of the Pakistan air force.

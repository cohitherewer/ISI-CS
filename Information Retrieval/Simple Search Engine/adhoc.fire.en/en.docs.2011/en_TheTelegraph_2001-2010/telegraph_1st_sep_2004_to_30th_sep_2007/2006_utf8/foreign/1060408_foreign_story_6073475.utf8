 Stones run into Great Wall

 Beijing, April 7: 

 The sextagenarian rock band, the Rolling Stones, is having 

 its style cramped by another set of ageing dinosaurs ? the 

 Chinese Communist Party leadership.

 The wrinkled British band is finally set to rock audiences in Shanghai tomorrow, but its not clear what its song-list will be.

 Four Stones songs ? Brown Sugar, Honky Tonk Woman, Beast of Burden and Lets Spend the Night Together ? have been banned in China for their bawdy lyrics, but it is not certain the band will be cowed into not performing them on stage. 

 Tomorrows concert will also remind China and the world of a more uncomfortable time. Originally, the Rolling Stones had been scheduled to play its first concert in China in 2003. But it had to cancel at the last minute because of the Sars epidemic.

 Emma Entertainment, a local event management company arranging the concert, told the press that the band would comply with all regulations.

 In China, the ministry of culture has the right to say what you can or cannot play (and) we will obey any rules or regulations, Amy Gu, a marketing executive at Emma was quoted as saying.

 Miffed fans, many of whom revere the Stones for its rebellious, anti-establishment views, poked fun at the band on their website. One visitor suggested the Stones rewrite one of its banned songs and rename it Lets Spend the Night Together in a Workers Paradise.

 Chinese laws are quite clear on what will happen to the Rolling Stones if it defies the government. Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Charlie Watts and Ron Wood, who have all spent varying amounts of time in western jails on charges ranging from drug possession to wrecking hotel rooms, will be able to add a Chinese jail to their list of detention centres. 

 But it shouldnt come to that, for the things that unite the Stones and Chinas leaders seem to outweigh the four songs that divide them. After all, both are ageing icons who would prefer not to rock the boat and rely on hair-dye and well-worn phrases to cling to past glories.

 Perhaps, thats why they both seem to have trouble connecting with todays China. Though tomorrows concert will be the first time the Stones are playing in China in its four-decade-long career, few Chinese seem interested. While Stones concerts in the US and Latin America often draw hundreds of thousands of fans, in Shanghai, Jagger and Co. have been booked to play at an 8,000-seat theatre ? and it isnt even sold out.

 Of course, part of the problem is the price of seeing the legends of rock in the flesh ? between RMB 300 (Rs 1,500) and RMB 3000 (Rs 15,000). Thats about the range of what most college graduates make a month. 

 But more significantly, while albums from British and American performers, such as the Rolling Stones and Bruce Springsteen, once sold rapidly here, todays youth seem unmoved by the content and themes of that music, said Steve Noerper, who teaches Asian studies at New York University. 

 Instead, Chinese teenagers say 

 they prefer to listen to local Chinese rock bands.

 Camera with Jolie snaps seized

 Westfield (Massachusetts), July 1 (AP): Police in this western Massachusetts town say they have seized a digital camera with images of celebrity couple Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie in Africa for an investigation by Los Angeles authorities.

 Local police, accompanied by state police and secret service officers, went to the home of William Keys on Tuesday to recover a digital cameras memory stick after three photos that appeared on the Internet were tracked to Keys, according to a Westfield police department news release yesterday.

 Officers then went to Precision Camera and Video Repair in Enfield, Connecticut, where Keys works, and recovered the camera. It remains in custody of Westfield police. No one has been arrested or charged in the case.

 Keys did not return repeated telephone calls yesterday for comment. Precision Camera referred calls to its attorneys, who did not return telephone messages. 

 Earlier this month, a celebrity photographer was arrested on suspicion of trespassing after he was found hiding in the bushes outside the Los Angeles school where Pitt and Jolie send their four-year-old son, police said.

 Fresh violence puts Lanka on knife-edge

 Colombo, May 1 (Reuters): Suspected Tamil Tigers killed at least seven people in a mine blast and a shooting today and the navy said it came under attack from the rebels sea wing intensifying fears of a return to civil war.

 The navy said five armed Sea Tiger boats, including two suicide craft, approached one of its vessels in waters off Trincomalee on the northeastern coast. When the navy tried to investigate, it was attacked.

 They have opened fire and attacked our Dvora, said navy spokesman D.K.P. Dassanayake, referring to the Israeli-built Dvora fast-attack craft. We retaliated in self-defence, he said. Five sailors were wounded.

 An army spokesman said a Sea Tiger ship was sunk in the exchange. There was no immediate comment from the LTTE headquarters. But the pro-rebel Tamilnet website said the previous night a Sea Tiger transport in the same area had to defend itself against artillery fire from shore. No casualties were reported.

 Near Trincomalee town, whose population is a volatile mix of ethnic majority Sinhalese, Tamils and Muslims, one sailor and four civilians were killed in a suspected rebel claymore fragmentation mine attack on a naval foot patrol, the army said.

 Seven were wounded in the blast, which occurred as a family was driving by in a motorised rickshaw.

 In the same district, police and the army said suspected Tiger gunmen shot dead two labourers and wounded three as they went to collect sand for construction work. 

 Five fishermen working in the same area were missing, they said.

 At least 130 have died in suspected Tiger mine attacks, a suicide bombing, government air and artillery strikes, riots and political killings in the past month, the bloodiest period since the two sides signed a Norwegian-brokered truce in 2002. Norway is trying to bring the government and the rebels, who have been fighting for a separate homeland for minority Tamils, back to peace talks meant to have taken place in Geneva in April.

 But Nordic truce monitors say that violence is worsening and there is evidence members of the armed forces are retaliating for claymore attacks by kidnapping and killing Tamil civilians.

 We dont believe the government has knowledge of this, said Nordic mission spokeswoman Helen Olafsdottir. We believe that some soldiers or police may be taking the law into their own hands, she said.

 The government denies that extrajudicial killings are taking place, but a UN report released last week said it was not doing enough to stop murders by a breakaway rebel faction operating in the east known as the Karuna group.

 The Tigers, whose anger at the Karuna killings are one of the chief reasons they are staying away from peace talks, said they raided a Karuna camp on Sunday, killing 20. 

 A Karuna aide confirmed the attack but said only five had been killed.

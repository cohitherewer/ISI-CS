 Hot idea on ice

 Wellington, Nov. 24 (Reuters): A New Zealand couples hot idea for a cool wedding tying the knot on an iceberg has been put on ice, local media reported today.

 Lawyer Bridget Byers and builder Donald Wyatt from the southern city of Dunedin had planned to marry on one of the many icebergs floating off the east coast of the South Island, the Otago Daily Times reported.

 But helicopter pilot Richard Hannibal Hayes, who was due to fly the pair and a marriage celebrant to one of the icebergs, said plans were on hold because the job was too risky.

 The slow thaw of the icebergs as they moved north meant they were constantly shedding ice, and it was difficult to find a safe haven for the lovebirds to land on.

 Bold Blaine

 New York (Reuters): David Blaines latest stunt ended with a crash on Thursday when the performer escaped from shackles in a gyroscope 15 metres above New Yorks Times Square, leapt and fell through a plywood stage below. After two days twisting and turning in the air, Blaine unhooked himself, jumped and crashed through the stage about half an hour after being given the go-ahead to try to escape. He emerged moments later, able to walk but appearing woozy, and greeted a few spectators before being whisked away.

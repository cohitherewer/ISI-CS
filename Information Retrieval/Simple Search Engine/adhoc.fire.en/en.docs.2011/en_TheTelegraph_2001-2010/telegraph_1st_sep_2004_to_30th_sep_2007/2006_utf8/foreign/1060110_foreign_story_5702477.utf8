 Turkey flu cases rise, WHO allays fears

 Dogubayazit (Turkey), Jan. 9 (Reuters): Turkey reported a spike in suspected bird flu cases among people across the country today as fears grew that the deadly disease was sweeping westward towards mainland Europe.

 The World Health Organisation (WHO) said victims appear to have contracted the virus directly from infected birds, allaying fears it was now passing dangerously from person to person.

 The Turkish authorities reported 14 people have tested positive for the deadly bird flu virus, including three children from the same family in an impoverished region of eastern Turkey who died last week.

 Bird flu is known to have killed 76 people since the latest outbreak emerged in late 2003. Human cases had been confined to east Asia until the virus was identified in Turkey last week.

 China confirmed its eighth human infection from bird flu today, the latest victim a six-year-old boy from the central Hunan province who is being treated in hospital.

 Indonesia said local tests showed a 39-year-old man had died from the virus earlier this month after contact with dead chickens. If confirmed, it would be the 12th death in Indonesia.

 Worried Turks rushed to hospitals today for tests for the virus, which kills more than half of those it infects.

 Thirteen children were among 23 people undergoing tests for bird flu in Istanbul, a teeming city of 12 million which is the countrys commercial hub and the gateway to Europe from Asia.

 Experts fear the deadly H5N1 strain will mutate just enough to allow it to pass easily from person to person. If it does so, it could cause a catastrophic pandemic, killing tens of millions of people, because humans lack immunity to it.

 However, a WHO team visiting Dogubayazit, the home village of the dead children, said the evidence there pointed to infection from diseased chickens.

 At the moment there is no element in this village indicating human-to-human transmission. Its typically similar to what we have seen so far (in Asia), Guenael Rodier, heading the WHOs mission to Turkey and a specialist on communicable diseases, said.

 The WHO has confirmed only four cases in Turkey, including two deaths. The WHO said other cases reported by Turkey have so far not been verified by laboratory tests.

 Investments and the economy could take a hit if tourism suffers as a result of health fears in Turkey, analysts say.

 Russia told its citizens yesterday to avoid travelling to Turkey, a popular destination for Russians.

 It has the potential to become quite serious depending on how long it stretches out, said Sonal Desai, senior emerging market economist at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein in Milan.

 Turkey has said it is treating human cases drawn from three broad areas, including victims from around the capital Ankara, about 400 km east of Istanbul. The other victims are from the Black Sea area in the north and the east where the deaths were reported last week.

 The total number of cases in our country is 14 confirmed by laboratory tests, and out of those 14, three children have died, Turkeys health minister Recep Akdag told a news conference.

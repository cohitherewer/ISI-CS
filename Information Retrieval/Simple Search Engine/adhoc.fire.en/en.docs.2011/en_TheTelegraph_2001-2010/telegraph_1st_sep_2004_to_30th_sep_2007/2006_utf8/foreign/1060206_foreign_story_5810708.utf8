 13 killed in Baluch bus blast

 Quetta, Feb. 5 (Reuters): A bomb exploded on a bus in southwestern Pakistan today, killing at least 13 people and wounding 20, the latest incident in worsening separatist violence in troubled Baluchistan province.

 The blast in a pass at Kolpur, about 60 km south of Baluchistans capital Quetta, came hours after eight people were killed when suspected tribal militants fired rockets into a town in the province near the countrys main gas field.

 Hospital officials said there were 13 dead at Quetta hospital and 20 wounded. Baluchistan police chief Chaudhry Mohammed Yaqoob said the toll could be higher as he had reports that people were still trapped in the wreckage of the bus.

 He blamed Baluch tribal militants who have stepped up an insurgency seeking greater autonomy and more benefit from natural gas resources in the province, which is Pakistans main source.

 Interior minister Aftab Ahmed Khan Sherpao said the blast was caused by a bomb hidden in the bus, which was travelling to Lahore.

 The bus attack was the worst incident blamed on tribal militants since they attacked Pakistans largest gas field last January, killing 15 people and disrupting fuel supplies for over a week.

 The violence came after President Pervez Musharraf on Friday demanded Baluch tribal leaders disband private militias.

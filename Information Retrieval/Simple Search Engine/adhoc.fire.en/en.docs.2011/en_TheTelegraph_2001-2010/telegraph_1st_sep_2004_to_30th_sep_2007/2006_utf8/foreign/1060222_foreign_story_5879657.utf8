 France laughs

 Rungis (France), Feb 21 (Reuters): Gallows humour has set in at the poultry hall of a large wholesale market near Paris where worried buyers and sellers are wondering what Frances first case of the H5N1 bird flu virus will mean for business.

 I went to an Asian restaurant last night and had duck. The duck was number H5 on the menu and the dessert was N1, said Olivier Chatelain, who was there to stock up on poultry for his shops and market stall. Youve got to have a sense of humour, he tells his colleagues who are chatting gloomily about the falling demand for chicken and other fowl.

 They stand around in white coats and hats among boxes of chicken sausages, guinea fowl and slabs of foie gras at the early-morning wholesale market which calls itself the worlds largest for fresh produce.

 The Rungis market south of Paris sells around 90,000 tonnes of poultry a year. In the early hours of today alone, 418 tonnes were delivered mostly from France but also from Belgium.

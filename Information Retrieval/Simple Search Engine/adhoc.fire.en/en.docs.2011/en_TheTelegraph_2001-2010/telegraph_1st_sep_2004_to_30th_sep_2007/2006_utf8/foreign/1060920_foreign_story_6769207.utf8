 Graft slur on Pervez regime

 Islamabad, Sept. 19 (PTI): The military-dominated regime in Pakistan is more corrupt than the two earlier governments of Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif, according to a survey by an anti-corruption watchdog.

 Thirty three per cent of the respondents in the survey, which was conducted by Transparency Internationals Pakistan chapter, said the government headed by President Pervez Musharraf between 1999-2002 was corrupt. 

 However, 67 per cent of the respondents found the government formed by Musharraf after the 2002 elections as more corrupt. The survey was based on a sample of 4000 urban and semi-urban citizens in all four provinces.

 Only 10 per cent of those questioned said the government headed by former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif between 1990-93 was corrupt. However, 34 per cent thought his second term, between 1996-1999 was more corrupt.

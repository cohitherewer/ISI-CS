 Victorias cake

 London, June 3: Vera Howarth celebrated her 98th birthday with a special cake ? one that is even older than she is, The Daily Telegraph reported today. 

 The seven-tier fruit cake was made in 1895, when Queen Victoria was on the throne, for the wedding of her parents, Mary Emma Illingworth and Samual Smedley. Most of it was eaten, but the top tier has been lovingly kept in the family. 

 Howarth, a former teacher from Paignton, Devon, said it had yellowed slightly but was still in good condition. My parents cut into the top tier on their wedding day. And on their golden wedding day, in 1945, they completed the slice, she said. We bring it out on special family occasions. It holds many memories. 

 Four generations of Howarths family were at her birthday party last week. Her daughter, Marjorie Schindler, 66, now keeps the cake. Its not mouldy and still smells beautifully of cake. Its amazing that its lasted so long.

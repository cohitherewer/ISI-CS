 Pak clashes

 Kohat (Pakistan), Feb. 10 (Reuters): Small-arms and rocket fire between Muslim sects killed four people in and around a Pakistani town after 36 people, mostly minority Shias, died in a suicide bombing and other violence, officials said today.

 Yesterdays bombing targeted a Shia procession in the town of Hangu in North West Frontier Province marking Muharram. No group claimed responsibility, but Shia leaders were quick to accuse Sunni militants blamed for decades of sectarian attacks as well as al Qaida-linked Islamist violence.

 The bombing sparked exchanges of fire between bands of Shias and Sunnis in and around Hangu, which continued into this morning, said Shia cleric Maulana Khurshid Anwar.

 Two people died in Hangu town and two in the nearby mountain village of Ibrahimzai, Hangu mayor Ghani-ur-Rehman said. 

 The shooting in Hangu, which is under curfew imposed by troops sent to restore order, died down before dawn. But exchanges of fire continued in Ibrahimzai, and in another village named Shahu where more than 100 rockets fell.

 Interior minister Aftab Ahmad Sherpao said the army and paramilitary troops had brought the situation in Hangu town under control, but sporadic firing continued in surrounding areas. Religious scholars from the Sunni and Shia sects were appealing for peace via mosque loudspeakers.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Box office blesses Code 

 A display shows tickets to the film sold out in New York

 Los Angeles, May 21 (Reuters): All the protests and all the bad reviews could not prevent The Da Vinci Code from recording a $224-million opening, the second-biggest debut ever at the global box office, its distributor said today.

 The controversial adaptation of Dan Browns best-selling novel, the story of a Vatican cover-up involving Jesus Christ and his supposed offspring, sold about $77 million worth of tickets at movie theatres in the US and Canada during its first three days, according to Columbia Pictures.

 Box-office watchers had predicted a North American opening of between $50 million and $80 million for the most eagerly awaited movie of the year.

 The biggest North American opening this year had been $68 million for Ice Age: The Meltdown seven weeks ago. But The Da Vinci Code numbers were still far from the $115 million record held by 2002s Spider-Man.

 The Da Vinci Code earned about $147 million overseas, the biggest international opening ever. The previous record was last years Star Wars: Episode III: Revenge of the Sith with $145 million, Columbia said.

 The total haul of $224 million ranks No. 2 behind the $253 million tally for the Star Wars movie, the studio said.

 In the films 90 foreign markets, it ranked as the No. 1 opening of all time in Italy ($11.4 million) and Spain ($11 million), and No. 1 or No. 2 of all time throughout South America, all heavily Catholic territories. It made the all-time top-10 in Britain ($15.7 million) and decidedly non-Christian Japan ($11.3 million).

 The strong sales came despite ? or because of ? an onslaught of protests and publicity not seen since another religious movie, Mel Gibsons The Passion of the Christ, earned $84 million domestically during its first weekend in February 2004. It grossed $612 million worldwide.

 The book became more than a book and the movie became more than a movie, said Valerie Van Galder, president of domestic marketing at Sony Corp.-owned Columbia. It became a perfect storm.

 Browns fictional premise ? that Jesus Christ had a child with Mary Magdalene and that their blood line survived through the ages ? was a huge hit at bookstores, with more than 40 million copies sold around the world.

 But some Christians, particularly Catholics, were angered by the story and have mounted an offensive against director Ron Howards movie adaptation, which stars Tom Hanks and French actress Audrey Tautou.

 A Catholic lay organisation, the American Society for the Defense of Tradition, Family and Property, took out full-page ads calling for worshippers to stage prayer vigils outside theatres.

 Other church groups have welcomed the opportunity to use the film as a starting point for discussion about the Bible, as has American Atheists, which says the same level of scrutiny applied to the book and film also should be used to question all other religious claims.

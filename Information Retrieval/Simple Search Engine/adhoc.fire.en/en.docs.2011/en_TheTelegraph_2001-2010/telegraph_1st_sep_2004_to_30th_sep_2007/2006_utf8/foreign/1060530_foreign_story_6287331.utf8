 Faithful offer prayers to appease the spirits

 Yogyakarta (Indonesia), May 29 (Reuters): Sitting cross-legged in front of a crumbled pavilion, the Indonesian palace retainer burns incense and makes an offering of bananas, betel nut leaves and areca nuts.

 Looking regal in his traditional Javanese suit, he bows his head and prays softly, pungent incense smoke hanging in the air. We are asking for your blessing, he whispers.

 The earthquake that rocked the royal city of Yogyakarta and surrounding areas on Saturday toppled the ornate open-sided pavilion ? locally known as the pendopo ? which had stood at the entrance to the Yogyakarta palace for centuries.

 The pendopo housed palanquins on which bearers used to carry the citys royals, and an ancient set of Javanese percussion instruments known as gamelan.

 The palace, home of the Sultan of Yogyakarta and governor of the province, was not spared. It was still closed to visitors today. But no one in the palace was harmed.

 Ive asked (palace staff) to be careful when they clean up the pendopo because there are plenty of historical objects there, Sultan Hamengkubuwono X said. Who knows if we can reconstruct them?

 In the sultans palace, another tourist draw in Yogyakarta, the quake shattered glass walls of a special room which displayed personal items of the sultans father, Hamengkubuwono IX.

 The Javanese are mainly Muslim, but mysticism runs through their culture. Most practice traditions and beliefs known as Kejawen, or The Javanese way. Kejawen followers believe wise spirits guard sacred places such as the centuries-old palace.

 We have to place offerings. We dont want to offend the spirit in the pendopo. We dont dare to retrieve the gamelan without their blessings, said Suryohadityo, a palace staffer.

 While life in Yogyakarta city slowly returns to normal, the Javanese are trying to make sense of what happened. 

 We cant do anything to prevent a disaster from happening. But the Javanese believe a disaster may be a prelude to another one, said Andy, a Javanese driver.

 Scientists challenge Pluto demotion

 Washington, 

 Sept. 2 (Reuters): Hundreds of US scientists have 

 challenged a recent decision by an international astronomy 

 group to strip Pluto of its planetary status with a petition 

 rejecting its definition of what constitutes a planet.

 The astronomical insurrection shows that debate is likely to continue over the status of the icy rock at the edge of the solar system that was considered the ninth planet until a vote last week by the International Astronomical Union.

 Petition organiser Alan Stern said the unions decision was driven by politics, not science.

 The IAU can say the sky is green all day long and that doesnt make it so, said Stern, a planetary scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado.

 The IAU created a definition which is technically flawed, linguistically flawed and scientifically embarrassing, Stern said in a phone interview.

 The 300 astronomers and planetary scientists who signed the petition said they would not use the IAUs definition. Dissenters are organising a conference next year to hash out a better definition, Stern said. Pluto has been considered the ninth planet since it was discovered 1930.

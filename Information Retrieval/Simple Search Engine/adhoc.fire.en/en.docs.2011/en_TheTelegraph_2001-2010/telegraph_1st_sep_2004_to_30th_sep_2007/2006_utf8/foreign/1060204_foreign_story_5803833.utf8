 Brangelina blows off Bennifer amp; TomKat

 Pitt and Jolie: Fever pitch

 Los Angeles, Feb. 3 (Reuters): The celebrity phenomenon dubbed Brangelina has triggered a media fever surrounding Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie that some observers say has reached the point of insanity ? far overshadowing the hoopla that attended such couples as Bennifer and TomKat.

 The terse confirmation last month that Jolie was pregnant by her co-star Pitt was proof to the media of a love affair that neither star has publicly acknowledged. Depending on which TV show you listen to or which celebrity magazine or gossip column you read, Jolie is expecting a girl, no! a boy, no! twins; the pair plans a Valentines Day wedding in Malibu, or possibly at George Clooneys Italian villa, unless they have already married in a secret Buddhist ceremony.

 They are also reported to have hired British celebrity chef Jamie Oliver to do the catering, Madonnas husband Guy Ritchie to be best man and have commissioned an Italian jeweller to come up with the ring. 

 Or does the sultry Oscar-winning actress (or possibly Pitt) have cold feet about tying the knot ? whoever said marriage was imminent anyway? ? and is Brads ex-wife Jennifer Aniston devastated or happily moving on? 

 Jolie, twice married, and Pitt, whose divorce last year from popular Friends star Aniston has spiced up the story, have remained tight-lipped, merely fuelling the speculation.

 We are not talking about it. We just want people to leave them alone, Pitts publicist Cindy Guagenti said. 

 There has always been a certain fascination with celebrity but with todays proliferation of outlets that seem to be competing for the same photos and stories, it has reached a point that seems completely insane, said consultant Ken Sunshine. 

 Even Time magazine has acknowledged the deafening noise, carrying a darkly satirical cartoon last week that featured the Jolie pregnancy news and wedding rumours as new methods of torture for prisoners of war.

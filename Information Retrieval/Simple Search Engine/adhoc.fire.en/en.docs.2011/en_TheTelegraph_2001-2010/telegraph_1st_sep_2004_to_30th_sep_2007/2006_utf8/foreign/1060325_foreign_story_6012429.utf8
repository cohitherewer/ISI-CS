 Afghans seek convert death

 Rahman: Razors edge

 Kabul, March 24 (Reuters): Growing international pressure on Afghanistan to respect the religious freedom of a Christian convert was met in Afghanistan today by a clamour of calls for the man to be executed for denying Islam.

 The controversy over 40-year-old Abdur Rahman, whose trial is due to begin next week, threatens to drive a wedge between Afghanistan and western countries that are ensuring its security and bankrolling its development.

 But President Hamid Karzai cannot ignore the views of conservative proponents of Islamic law or appear to bow too readily to outside pressure.

 A group of several hundred people, including a former Prime Minister and religious and former faction leaders, met in Kabul and urged that Rahman be tried under Islamic law, and threatened trouble if the government caved in to western pressure.

 Rahman was detained last week for converting to Christianity and could face the death penalty if he refuses to become a Muslim again, judicial officials say. Death is the punishment stipulated by sharia, or Islamic law, for apostasy. The case has sparked an outcry in North America and Europe but that appeared only to harden positions in Afghanistan.

 Several clerics raised the issue during weekly sermons in Kabul today, and there was little sympathy for Rahman.

 We respect all religions, but we dont go into the British embassy or the American embassy to see what religion they are following, said cleric Enayatullah Baligh at Kabuls main mosque.

 The US wants Afghanistan to show that it respects religious freedom and quickly resolve the case. President George W. Bush has vowed to use US leverage over Afghanistan.

 Several other countries with troops in Afghanistan, including Canada, Italy, Germany and Australia, have voiced their concern.

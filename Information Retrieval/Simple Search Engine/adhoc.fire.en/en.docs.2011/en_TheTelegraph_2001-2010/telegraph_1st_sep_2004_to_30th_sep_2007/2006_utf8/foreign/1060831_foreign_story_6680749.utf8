 Bugti fury flares in Pak

 Quetta, 

 Aug. 30 (Reuters): Suspected militants blew up 

 a railway line in Pakistans gas-rich Baluchistan province 

 today while elsewhere, a protest turned violent as anger 

 over the killing of a nationalist rebel chief simmered.

 Violent protests have erupted across Baluchistan province since nationalist leader Nawab Akbar Khan Bugti was killed on Saturday in a government assault on his cave hideout.

 Police and railway officials said militants blew up a railway track in Mastung district, 50 km south of Quetta.

 Waziristan killing

 The beheaded bodies of the two men were found in different parts of the North Waziristan region. Notes were left with both bodies accusing them of being spies for the US.

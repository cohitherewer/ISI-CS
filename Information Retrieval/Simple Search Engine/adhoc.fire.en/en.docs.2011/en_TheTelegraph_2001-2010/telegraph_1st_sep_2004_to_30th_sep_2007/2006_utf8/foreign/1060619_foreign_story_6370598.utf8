 Bamiyan offer

 A Bamiyan Buddha

 Bangkok, June 18 (AP): Thailand has offered to take the remains of Afghanistans blasted Buddhas of Bamiyan and rebuild the two 1,600-year-old statues in the Southeast Asian Buddhist country.

 Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra said he made the proposal to reconstruct the statues, which were destroyed by the former Taliban regime, to Afghan President Hamid Karzai on the sidelines of an Asian security summit.

 I told President Karzai that Thailand, as a Buddhist nation, is sorry that the Taliban destroyed the Buddha statues, and I asked for the rubble of the statues, so we could reconstruct them, Thaksin said. 

 Karzai said it was a good idea that he would discuss with his government, Thaksin added.

 The Taliban regime used dynamite and artillery to blast the fabled fifth-century Buddha statues in March 2001, disregarding worldwide protests to spare the archaeological treasures that were built into soaring cliffs of the Bamiyan valley.

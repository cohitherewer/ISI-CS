 Promiscuous? She goes Scarlett

 Johansson: Instincts matter

 New York, Oct. 10 (AP): Scarlett Johansson says that while monogamy might go against instinct, she is happy in her relationship with boyfriend and recent Black Dahlia co-star Josh Hartnett.

 Josh is very sweet, the 21-year-old actress says in an interview in Allure magazines November issue, on newsstands on October 24. Hes a good boy. A great person. Im very lucky and Im very happy. Contrary to popular belief, Im not promiscuous.

 There does seem to be a mistaken belief out there that I am sexually available somehow which is not to say that Im not open-minded about sex, she continues. 

 Yet I wouldnt say Im a serial monogamist, either. I mean, I went through periods of time when I was, ah, single. But when Im in a relationship, Im in a relationship.

 But Johansson, whose films include Lost in Translation and Match Point, still acknowledges monogamy might not be natural. 

 I do think on some basic level we are animals, and by instinct we kind of breed accordingly, she says. But as much as I believe that, I work really hard when Im in a relationship to make it work in a monogamous way.

 Johansson also encourages testing for sexually transmitted diseases.

 I get tested for HIV twice a year. ... One has to be socially aware, she says. Its part of being a decent human, to be tested for STDs. Its just disgusting behaviour when people dont. Its so irresponsible.

 Johansson has also starred in The Horse Whisperer with Robert Redford and Kate Bosworth.

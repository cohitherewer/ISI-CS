 Radiation trace in UK sites

 London, Nov. 27 (Reuters): Traces of radiation have been found at several more sites in London during investigations into the death of a former KGB spy last week, British home secretary John Reid said today.

 Reid told parliament the traces had been found at several other premises in addition to Alexander Litvinenkos home and a hotel and restaurant he visited on November 1, the day he fell ill. Significant amounts of Polonium 210 were found in his body.

 Before he died, Litvinenko accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of murdering him. Russia denies any involvement. Reid did not name the contaminated locations. Media reports cited a central London office block and an address in the capitals exclusive Mayfair district. Police declined comment.

 Health officials have said Polonium 210 is dangerous only if it is swallowed, inhaled or absorbed through a wound. Reid said there was no need for public alarm.

 But his comments deepened the mystery over how and where Litvinenko ingested the poison that caused his agonising death, causing his hair to fall out and gradually shutting down his vital organs.

 The possible contamination of members of the public has heaped pressure on the government to explain what it knows about Litvinenkos death. A spokeswoman for Britains Health Protection Agency said three people had been referred to a clinic for radiological assessment. 

 She declined to comment on their symptoms.

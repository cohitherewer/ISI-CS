 Clashes after Saddam verdict

 Baghdad, Nov. 6 (Reuters): Iraq today began to lift a curfew imposed to quell any insurgent backlash against the death sentence passed on Saddam Hussein, amid a wave of jubilation among his former victims and fury among diehard supporters.

 Five more American soldiers were killed, the military announced on the eve of mid-term US elections in which discontent over the Iraq war could cost US President George W. Bushs Republicans control of Congress.

 Mortar rounds slammed into areas around Baghdads Green Zone, the fortified compound that was once Saddams palace complex and now houses the courthouse where he was tried.

 The Prime Ministers office said vehicles would be allowed back in the streets of the capital at 6 am (0300 GMT) tomorrow. Pedestrians were free to move around again immediately in Baghdad. Curfews mostly kept down violence yesterday and today after the Iraqi High Tribunal convicted Saddam of crimes against humanity and sentenced him to death by hanging.

 But the verdict of a trial US officials hoped would help heal the country has divided Iraqis, being greeted with joy by Shia Muslims oppressed under Saddam but humiliating Sunnis.

 The interior ministry forced two Sunni Arab channels off the air yesterday, saying they were inciting violence. In contrast, state television, controlled by the Shia-led government, has broadcast non-stop scenes of celebration and graphic images of Saddam-era executions since the verdict was announced.

 About 200 Saddam supporters demonstrated today in Falluja, chanting old Saddam slogans such as we will give our blood for you. Mosul also saw pro-Saddam demonstrations, as did Samarra, north of Baghdad.

 An automatic appeal against Saddams sentence for killing, torturing and jailing hundreds of Shias from the town of Dujail means no execution is likely until next year at the earliest.

 Kurds, for whose alleged genocide Saddam is due back in court tomorrow, want their own day of judgment. Defence attorneys said, however, they saw little hope from the appeal and dismissed the sentence as victors justice.

 In Baquba, police put the final casualty toll at two dead and six wounded among pro-Saddam demonstrators in police firing.

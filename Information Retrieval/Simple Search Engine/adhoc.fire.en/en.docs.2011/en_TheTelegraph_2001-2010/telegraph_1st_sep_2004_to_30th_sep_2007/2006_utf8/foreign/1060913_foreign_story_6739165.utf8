 Taliban bigger threat

 Brussels, Sept. 12 (Reuters): Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf warned the West today that Taliban insurgents were a more dangerous terrorist force than al Qaida because of the broad support they have in Afghanistan.

 On a visit to Brussels, Musharraf defended his commitment to counter-terrorism in the face of some critical questioning from lawmakers in the European Parliament who also took him to task on human rights and restrictions on political opponents.

 He won support though from the EUs executive commission, which praised Pakistans help in foiling terrorist plots and pledged a substantial increase in development funds for education and rural development from next year.

 Speaking five years after al Qaidas 9/11 attacks on the US and the subsequent US invasion of Afghanistan to topple the Taliban, Musharraf told EU lawmakers Taliban fighters had regrouped in southern Afghanistan.

 The centre of gravity of terrorism has shifted from al Qaida to the Taliban, he said. 

 This is a new element, a more dangerous element, because it (the Taliban) has its roots in the people. Al Qaida didnt have roots in the people.

 Musharraf said he was certain Taliban fighters were being commanded by former Taliban ruler Mullah Omar from a base in southern Afghanistan, where Nato troops are struggling to contain an insurgency.

 He rejected criticism that Pakistan was not doing enough to prevent the Taliban from mounting attacks on Nato troops by infiltrating its porous borders with Afghanistan. No one should blame us or doubt us for not doing enough, he said.

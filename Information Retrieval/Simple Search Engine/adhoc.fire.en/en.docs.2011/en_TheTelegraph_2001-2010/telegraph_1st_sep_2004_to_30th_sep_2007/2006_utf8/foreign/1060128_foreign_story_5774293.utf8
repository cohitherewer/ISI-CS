 Salzburg comes alive with Mozart mania

 Salzburg (Austria), Jan. 27 (Reuters): Visitors from around the world descended on Salzburg today to mark the musical maestro Mozarts birth 250 years ago.

 Tourists crammed into the 12th Century house where Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was born and concerts got under way in the snow-covered Austrian town, which led international celebrations of a man who left behind a staggering musical legacy.

 I am a great admirer, a Mozart fan, said Stefano Armeni, 34, a pharmacist from Sardinia, as he queued outside with dozens of Japanese tourists. He was a great musician who reached the heart of everybody.

 The Austrian Wunderkind, who stunned the courts of Europe with his brilliance as a child pianist and was just five when he began composing, fled to Vienna as a young man when he felt the provincialism of Salzburg was cramping his style.

 Vienna will hold three days of parties and performances to celebrate the flowering of a genius who wrote his most enduring masterpieces in the city. Elsewhere, the Paris Opera will stage a new production of Don Giovanni, directed by avant-garde filmmaker Michael Haneke.

 Stars team up against AIDS

 Salma Hayek: Noble cause

 Managua (Nicaragua), May 6 (AFP): Hollywood stars Ashley Judd and Salma Hayek joined the Nicaraguan government in a declaration to support the fight against AIDS, a government official said.

 In a ceremony in the office of President Enrique Bolanos yesterday, actress Judd and mexican native Hayek signed a joint declaration with government officials committing their support for programmes to fight the disease.

 The two movie stars were in Managua as part of a tour through central America as ambassadors of Youthaids, a project of the Washington-based non-profit group Population Services International.

 Targetting people between 15 and 24 for HIV/AIDS education, Youthaids puts its message out through music and other popular culture avenues.

 Judd said the strategy is to promote abstinence, delayed sexual relations and fidelity and condom use for those who are sexually active.

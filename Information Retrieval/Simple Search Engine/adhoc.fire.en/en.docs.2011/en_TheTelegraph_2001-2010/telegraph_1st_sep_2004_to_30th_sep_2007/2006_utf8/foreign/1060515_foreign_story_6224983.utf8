 Iraq violence 

 Baghdad, May 14 (Reuters): Bombs killed 30 people in Baghdad today and sectarian attacks wrecked six Shia shrines in a rural area, adding to pressure on Iraqs rival leaders to agree on the formation of a unity government. 

 Two suicide bombers in cars killed 14 Iraqis at the entrance to Baghdad airport. 

 First Lady 

 Washington (Reuters): US First lady Laura Bush said on Sunday she does not believe opinion polls showing her husbands approval ratings at record low levels. Interviewed on Fox News Sunday, Laura said she did not think people were losing confidence in President George W. Bush, despite a series of polls showing support for him at its lowest point in his five-year presidency and among the lowest for any president in the past 50 years. 

 Israel law 

 Jerusalem (Reuters): Israels high court on Sunday narrowly upheld a law that denies Israeli residency to many Palestinians who marry Israelis, rejecting appeals against a statute critics say violates human rights and is racist. The restrictions affect thousands of Palestinian and Israeli Arab couples. 

 Lanka terror 

 Colombo (PTI): Nineteen people were shot dead in separate incidents in northeast Sri Lanka since Saturday. The violence came as Tamil Tiger rebels vowed a war to deploy their navy even though truce monitors said it violated a ceasefire.

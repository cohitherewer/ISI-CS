 Christmas to be costly

 Copenhagen, Nov. 8 (Reuters): Christmas cheer will be a little more expensive in Europe this year. 

 Christmas tree prices are set to rise in Germany, Britain and elsewhere because of a shortage of supply from main exporter Denmark, producers said today.

 The dog fight is in bulk sales for middle quality trees, which is about 75 per cent of the business, said Niels Ambech, a tree producer near Copenhagen. The price for a 2-metre Nordmann Fir treewill go up 10 to 20 per cent.

 Pak man kills sisters after spat over jobs

 Karachi, May 10 (Reuters): A Pakistani man is on the run from police in Karachi after shooting dead his two sisters following an argument over their plans to find jobs outside their home, police said today.

 The sisters, aged 21 and 16, had challenged their conservative elder brother by saying they wanted to work in a factory and beauty parlour to help their widowed mother manage the family household in a poor part of the southern city.

 Their brother, who is absconding, objected to them working as it was against the familys values, police officer Shaukat Awan said. He shot them in the early morning while they were sleeping with their mother in a room after a late night argument, he said.

 The man, a 25-year-old petrol pump attendant, shot each sister three times, according to Rohina Hasan, a hospital official involved in the investigation.

 Although women now figure prominently at workplaces in urban parts of conservative Pakistan, many men from poorer neighbourhoods or rural areas still consider that allowing womenfolk to work outside the home would be an insult to their honour.

 Karachi blast kills 55

 Karachi, April 11 (Reuters): A bomb targeting Sunnis killed at least 55 people and wounded dozens in Karachi today as they gathered to celebrate the anniversary of Prophet Mohammads birth, officials said.

 The blast shook the earth. It was like hell, Mohammad Ehtesham, a 70-year-old worshipper in the park where the blast took place, said. We were about to finish our prayers when blast went off ... It was so strong, said Ali Nasir, a young man among the wounded.

 Soon after, angry youths, some of them armed, went on a rampage, setting a petrol station and cars ablaze and firing on police and paramilitary troops as they tried to reach Nishtar Park, in the heart of the citys commercial district and close to the mausoleum of Pakistans founder, Mohammad Ali Jinnah.

 The blast was believed to have been centred close to the stage where prayer leaders from a Sunni organisation, Jamaat-e-Ahle Sunnat, had been standing.

 Police confirmed several Jamaat leaders were killed. The religious movement has a following of hundreds of thousands of people. It is an act of terrorism, deputy inspector-general of police investigation, Manzoor Mughal, said.

 The venue had been checked by security beforehand. There is high probability that it was suicide attack because we were on very high alert, the Sindh provincial home minister, Rauf Siddiqui, said.

 Television pictures showed dead bodies lying on the ground and wounded being taken to hospitals in vans after the explosion.

 At the moment, based on what we have got from various hospitals, there are at least 55 dead and scores wounded, Shabir Qaimkhani, Sindhs health minister, said.

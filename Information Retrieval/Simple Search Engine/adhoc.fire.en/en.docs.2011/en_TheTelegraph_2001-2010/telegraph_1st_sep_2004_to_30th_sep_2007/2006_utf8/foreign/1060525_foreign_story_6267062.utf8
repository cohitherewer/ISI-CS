 Osama denies Moussaoui role in 9/11

 Zacarias Moussaoui 

 Dubai, May 24 (Reuters): Osama bin Laden said Zacarias Moussaoui, the only person convicted in a US court for the September 11 attacks, had nothing to do with the operations, according to a website audiotape released yesterday.

 The speaker on the tape, attributed to bin Laden, said he had personally assigned tasks to the 19 hijackers who staged the attacks on US cities which killed about 3,000 people.

 The truth is that he has no connection whatsoever with the events of September 11. I am certain of what I say because I was responsible for entrusting the 19 brothers ... with the raids, said the man, who sounded like the leader of al Qaida.

 A US intelligence official said the recording is authentic. Following a technical analysis it has been revealed that the voice is indeed Osama bin Laden, said the official. Moussaoui was sentenced on May 4 to life in prison with no chance of release, ending four-and-a-half years of legal wrangling over his fate.

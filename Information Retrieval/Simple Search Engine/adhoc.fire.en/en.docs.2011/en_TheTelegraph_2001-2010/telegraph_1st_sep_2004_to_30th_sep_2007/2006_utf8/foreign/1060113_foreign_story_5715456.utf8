 No ticket for licence-less Arnie

 Schwarzenegger: Culprit

 Los Angeles, Jan. 12 (AFP): California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger will not be slapped with a ticket for driving without a licence after crashing his Harley Davidson motorcycle at the weekend, Los Angeles police has said.

 The movie star politician, who ironically has banned illegal immigrants from obtaining Californian drivers licences, got into hot water after admitting he did not have a proper licence to drive his motorcycle.

 I just never really got one, the former actor said. I never thought about it.

 The 58-year-old governor is sporting a fat lip after receiving 15 stitches following the accident that occurred when a driver reversed out in front of the gubernatorial motorbike.

 But police and city prosecutors announced that he would not face any charge over the accident. The LAPD does not issue a motorist a citation unless that person is observed by the officer committing a traffic violation, an LAPD spokesman said.

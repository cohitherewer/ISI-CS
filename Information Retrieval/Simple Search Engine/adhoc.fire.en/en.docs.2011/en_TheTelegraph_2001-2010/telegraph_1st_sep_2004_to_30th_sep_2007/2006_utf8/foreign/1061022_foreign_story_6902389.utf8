 Korea escalating crisis: Rice

 Moscow, Oct. 21 (Reuters): US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice cast doubt today on reports that North Korea had pledged to stop nuclear tests, saying it seemed bent instead on escalating the crisis.

 News reports had raised hopes that tension was easing yesterday by saying North Korean leader Kim Jong-il had told Chinas special envoy Tang Jiaxuan this week that he planned no further nuclear tests.

 But Rice met Tang in person in Beijing yesterday and then told reporters travelling onwards to Moscow with her that he had given no sign China had achieved such a diplomatic breakthrough.

 Tang did not tell me that Kim Jong-il either apologised for the test or said that he would not ever test again, she said. Russia is the last stop on Rices five-day trip.

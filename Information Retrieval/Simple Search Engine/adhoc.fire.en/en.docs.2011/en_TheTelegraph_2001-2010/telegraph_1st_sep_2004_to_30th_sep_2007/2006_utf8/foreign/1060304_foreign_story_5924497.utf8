 US prison detainee refuses to cooperate

 Guantanamo Bay US Naval Base (Cuba), March 3 (Reuters): An al Qaida member refused to appear before a Guantanamo war crimes tribunal yesterday or to cooperate with a US military defence lawyer whom he considers an enemy.

 That left the court struggling to figure out how to comply with President George W. Bushs order to present a zealous defence for all the foreign terrorism suspects charged at the naval base in Cuba. The remote military prison, which UN human rights investigators have urged Washington to shut, is home to nearly 500 captives, but only 10 have been charged with a crime.

 Ali Hamza al Bahlul, a Yemeni and acknowledged al Qaida member, is charged with conspiring with Osama bin Laden to commit crimes against civilians and property. He was allegedly bin Ladens bodyguard and made al Qaida recruiting videos, but has said he had nothing to do with the September 11 attacks.

 Bahlul refused to enter the courtroom for a pre-trial hearing at the remote base yesterday and the presiding officer, Colonel Peter Brownback, said he would not order him shackled and dragged in involuntarily.

 Bahluls attorney, Major Tom Fleener, has ignored Brownbacks instructions to file certain motions in the case and said it was because his client told him to do nothing on his behalf.

 Mr Fleener, I told you to represent him, Brownback said, sounding exasperated. The issue is not as simple as you say Do it, and I do it, Fleener replied. He doesnt want me, and cant be forced, I believe, to have me.

 Bahlul has repeatedly sought and been refused permission to act as his own attorney or have a Yemeni lawyer. Tribunal rules require that defendants have US military lawyers who are able to review secret evidence that the defendants cannot see.

 Defence attorneys and legal monitors said those rules violate international law guaranteeing the right to self-representation and the right to choose a lawyer.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 A China love cruise for the rich

 Beijing, 

 Nov. 14 (Reuters): A matchmaking cruise for male 

 millionaires and women who must be good-looking and 

 desirable sets sail in China this month, a state newspaper 

 said today.

 To take part in the cruise along Shanghais Huangpu river, the men must have assets of at least 2 million yuan ($250,000), organiser Xu Tianli was quoted as saying.

 Rich men are normally very busy, and most of the women they meet are there for work or business, which these men consider to be unsuitable for relationships, Xu said, adding that half the men who registered for the cruise had assets worth more than $25 million.

 One of the registered men, who identified himself by his surname, Sun, was confident in the match-making process.

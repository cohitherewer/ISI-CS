 Editor faces trial by old law

 Oslo, Feb. 21 (Reuters): A Norwegian Muslim has reported a newspaper editor who published cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad to the police for violating a blasphemy law last used in 1933 against a poet who called Christians cannibals.

 In January, a Norwegian Christian paper published the drawings, which originated in Denmark. That sparked attacks on Norwegian interests in West Asia and Asia.

 I have been reported to the police for blasphemy. We will have to see what happens as this law has not been used since 1933, Verbjoern Selbekk, editor of newspaper Magazinet, said..

 In 1933, the state failed to convict poet Arnulf Overland for comparing Christians to cannibals for their ritual of eating bread and drinking wine to symbolise Christs body and blood.

 Planeload of Georgians deported from Russia

Tbilisi (Georgia), Oct. 6 (Reuters): Russia 

today deported a planeload of Georgians it said were in the country illegally 

but Tbilisi said the Kremlin had now added a soft form of ethnic cleansing 

to its sanctions against its pro-western neighbour.

 Russian President Vladimir Putin said irresponsible Georgian policies were aimed at preparing the way for use of force to restore Tbilisis rule in two separatist regions.

 Russia has severed all transport and postal links with Georgia, stopped issuing entry visas to Georgians, and raided Georgian-owned businesses in Moscow in a row over Tbilisis arrest of four Russian soldiers on spying charges.

 The four were released but their arrest ignited smouldering tensions between the two nations, at odds for years over Georgias wish to move closer to the West. The 136 Georgian deportees, looking exhausted, some with tears in their eyes, walked down a ramp from the back of a huge Ilyushin cargo plane after arrival at Tbilisi airport.

 A Reuters reporter saw one woman drop to her knees and kiss the tarmac. Russian officials said they were expelled because they did not have the right documents, but several showed reporters their passports with valid Russian entry visas.

 It is terrible, we feel like Jews during World War II, not like humans, said one of the deportees, who gave her name as Irina. Todays deportations followed President Putins order to tighten up controls on illegal migrants, though he did not link the order to Georgia.

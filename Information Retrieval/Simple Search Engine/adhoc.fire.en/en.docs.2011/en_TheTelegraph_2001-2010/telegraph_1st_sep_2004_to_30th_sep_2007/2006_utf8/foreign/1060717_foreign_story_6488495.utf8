 N Korea rejects UN sanctions

 Seoul, July 16 (Reuters): North Korea today said it was not bound by a UN Security Council resolution imposing weapons-related sanctions on it and insisted the country would bolster its war deterrent in every way.

 The Security Council had acted with irresponsibility by voting unanimously for a resolution requiring nations to prevent North Korea from acquiring dangerous weapons, a North Korean foreign ministry spokesman said.

 Our Republic will bolster its war deterrent for self-defence in every way, by all means and methods, now that the situation has reached the worst phase due to the extremely hostile act of the US, he was quoted as saying by the official KCNA news agency.

 North Korea refers to its military build-up and its weapons of mass destruction programmes as its war deterrent, saying the US military presence and drills on the Korean peninsula are a prelude to war against it.

 The UN resolution condemns North Koreas July 5 multiple missile launches and demands that Pyongyang suspend all missile activities and return to stalled six-country talks aimed at ending its nuclear weapons programmes.

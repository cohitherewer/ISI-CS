 Haifa (Israel), July 19 

 (Reuters): Imad Mousa and his fiancee Anita Mishal 

 smiled sweetly as their wedding photos were taken in Haifa 

 yesterday ? just moments after the booms of Hizbollah rockets 

 echoed across the northern Israeli city.

 I am a bridegroom under fire, Mousa said. The noise bothers us, but what is more important than getting married?

 Dressed in their full wedding regalia, the couple posed for pictures overlooking Haifas crystal bay.

 They plan to get married on Friday in Mousas village of Kfar Yasif in the northern Galilee, which has also come under attack from the Lebanese guerrillas. 

 Mishal comes from Haifa and wanted wedding pictures from her home town.

 Hizbollah rocket salvoes have killed 13 Israeli civilians since the crisis erupted a week ago. Israeli air strikes on Lebanon have killed 235 people, the vast majority civilians. The couple, Arab citizens of Israel, bemoaned the bloodshed. War is bad for everyone, said Mousa.

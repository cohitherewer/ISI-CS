 Stones and smoke

 Glasgow, Aug. 27 (AP): Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards may have violated Scotlands new smoking ban by lighting up during a concert.

 The Glasgow City Council said today it had heard from journalists that Richards was smoking during a Friday night performance.

 Its been brought to our attention that he was smoking, and well be looking into it, a council spokesman said. We do take our responsibilities for enforcement very seriously.

 Scotlands ban on smoking in enclosed public places, including theatres and sports venues, came into force in March. Violators can be fined up to 50. 

 Caught changing

 Hong Kong (AP): Hong Kong 

 pop star Gillian Chung, a member of the female duo Twins, 

 who was secretly photographed in a backstage changing room 

 in Malaysia, has reported the matter to police.

 Photos of Chung changing backstage at a concert at the Malaysian entertainment resort of Genting were published on the latest cover of Hong Kongs Easy Finder magazine, drawing criticism from womens groups, journalists and other entertainers. 

 The photos show Chung adjusting her bra. It reveals her naked shoulder, but not her breasts.

 This time I was unlucky, but I also think its a matter of societal preference. People do these kinds of things because people like the pictures. The readers should reflect on their preferences too, Chung said.

 Watermelon record

 Converse, Los Angeles (AP): A father-son team from this Sabine County town broke the state watermelon record three times in one summer, with melons adding up to a total weight of 677 pounds. 

 The really big buster, at 252.4 pounds, was cut from its vine in front of two witnesses from the Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry. 

 We babied this thing for 147 days, said the father. He and 15-year-old son brought their first pair of record-breakers to the Louisiana Watermelon Festival in Farmerville July 27-28. 

 The world record is 268.8 pounds, set in 2005.

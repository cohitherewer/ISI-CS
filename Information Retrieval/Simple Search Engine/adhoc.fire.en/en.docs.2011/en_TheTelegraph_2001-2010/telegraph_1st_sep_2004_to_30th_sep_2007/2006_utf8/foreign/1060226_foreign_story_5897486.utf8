 Death for spy chief

 Kabul, Feb. 25 (Reuters): An Afghan court sentenced a former spy chief to death for killing hundreds of people during communist rule, the first such punishment for war crimes after decades of conflict in the country.

 Assadullah Sarwari, who has been detained since 1992 when US-backed mujahideen, or holy warriors, overthrew a Soviet-backed communist regime, said he would appeal against the verdict. Chief judge Abdul Basit Bakhtyari drew applause on announcing the judgement. Given the evidence, we ... sentence you Sarwari ... to death for killing hundreds of Muslim and Mujahid people.

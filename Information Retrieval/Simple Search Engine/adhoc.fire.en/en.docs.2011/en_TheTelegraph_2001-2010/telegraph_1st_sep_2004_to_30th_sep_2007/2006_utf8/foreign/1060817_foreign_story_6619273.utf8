The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Overweight outnumber hungry

 NICK SQUIRES

 Sydney, Aug. 16: The number of overweight people in the world has overtaken the number of malnourished for the first time, with a billion people heavier than advised. 

 While almost one in six of the estimated world population of 6.5 billion is now overweight or obese, about 800 million people do not have enough to eat, an international conference in Australia was told.

 The reality is that globally far more obesity than under-nutrition exists, said Prof. Barry Popkin, a nutritionist from the University of North Carolina.

 As Prof. Popkin said that the transition from a starving world to an obese one was accelerating, experts gathered at a meeting near Brisbane of the International Association of Agricultural Economists said the lead in the fight against obesity would have to be taken by governments. 

 Prof. Popkin said that while the number of hungry people was falling gradually, the number of obese people worldwide was about 300 million. Obesity is now affecting developing countries due to a change in diet to more fatty foods, a decline in physical work, the growth in car ownership and more hours spent in front of the television set.

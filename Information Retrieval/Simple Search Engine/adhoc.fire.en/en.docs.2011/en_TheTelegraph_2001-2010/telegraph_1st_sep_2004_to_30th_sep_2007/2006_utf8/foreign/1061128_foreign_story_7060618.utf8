The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Tiger chief in violence threat

 Colombo, 

 Nov. 27 (PTI): Tamil Tiger chief Velupillai Prabhakaran 

 today threatened to resume their violent struggle for a 

 separate Tamil state, saying that President Mahinda Rajapakse 

 was pursuing a military solution to the ethnic conflict.

 Speaking during the rebel outfits annual heroes day, Prabhakaran said the Norwegian-brokered ceasefire between his rebel group and government troops was no longer functioning and was made defunct by continuing attacks by security forces.

 He called on the international community, which has been pressing both sides to end the violence, to recognise the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelams struggle for independence. It is now crystal clear that the (majority) Sinhala leaders will never put forward a just resolution to the tamil national question, Prabhakaran said in the statement.

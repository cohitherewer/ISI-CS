 US finds taste for French fries

 ALEC RUSSELL 

 Wheres the sauce?

 Washington, Aug. 5: In a sign of the warming relations between France and America the cafeterias in the US House of Representatives have ended one of the great trans-Atlantic culinary disputes and are selling French fries and French toast once more.

 Republican Congressmen famously renamed them freedom fries and freedom toast three years ago in a fit of patriotic fury fuelled by French opposition to the US drive for war in Iraq.

 Walter Jones and Bob Ney, the representatives who pushed for the original change, said at the time it was to show the strong displeasure of many on Capitol Hill with the actions of our so-called ally, France.

 Since then the mood about the war has shifted dramatically. The menu in the House of Representatives basement cafeteria last week assumed its original wording. The other main cafeteria changed back earlier this year. Jones is now a critic of the war and publicly regrets his name-change campaign. 

 Anti-French sentiment remains strong in the heartland and official circles. When interviewing Condoleezza Rice, the secretary of state, Bill Reilly, one of Americas best-known Right-wing talk show hosts, this week mocked France and its foreign minister, Philippe Douste-Blazy, as ridiculous.

 More than 50 per cent of Americans have a favourable impression of France, up from 29 per cent in May 2003, according to the Pew Global Attitudes survey.

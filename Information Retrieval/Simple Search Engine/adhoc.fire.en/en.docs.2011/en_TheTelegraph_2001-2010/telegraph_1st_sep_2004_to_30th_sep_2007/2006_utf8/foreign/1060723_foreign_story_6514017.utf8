 Trick turns PCs into zombies

 San Francisco, July 22 (AFP): Computer hackers built a fake Google tool bar website to trick people into downloading a malicious programme that could turn machines into zombies, a US Internet security firm said.

 Emails containing Internet links to the bogus website and invitations to download Google tool bar software began circulating this week, according to Surfcontrol of northern California.

 The phoney website was a replica of the real one provided by the Internet search juggernaut based in Mountain View, California, Surfcontrol said yesterday.

 Instead of the promised tool bar software, the site duped people into downloading a trojan, malicious computer coding hidden inside a seemingly harmless offering, according to Surfcontrol.

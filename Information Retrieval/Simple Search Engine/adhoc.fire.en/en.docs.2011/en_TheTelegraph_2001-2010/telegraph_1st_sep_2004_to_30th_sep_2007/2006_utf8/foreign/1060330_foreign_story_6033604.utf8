 Afghan convert in Italy: PM

 Rome, March 29 (Reuters): An Afghan Christian convert who had faced the death penalty for abandoning Islam has arrived in Italy where he has been offered asylum, Italy said today. 

 Abdur Rahman, 40, was jailed this month for converting to Christianity and could have faced trial under Islamic sharia law that stipulates death as punishment for apostasy.

 He was freed from prison yesterday after pressure from western states whose troops helped bring the Afghan government to power.

 Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi said he had arrived in Italy. He is already here. He has asked for political asylum and is currently being looked after by the interior ministry, Berlusconi said.

 Berlusconi, who had earlier said that Rahman had shown great courage and that Italy would offer him asylum, said the mans exact whereabouts were being kept secret.

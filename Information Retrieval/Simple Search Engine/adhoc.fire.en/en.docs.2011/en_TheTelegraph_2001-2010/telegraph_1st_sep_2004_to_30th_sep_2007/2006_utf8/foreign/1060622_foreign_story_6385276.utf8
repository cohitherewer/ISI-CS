 Naomi at Nicole party

 Watts: Friends wedding

 Sydney, June 21 (AP): Actress Naomi Watts jetted into Sydney early today for her longtime friend Nicole Kidmans hotly anticipated weekend nuptials to country music star Keith Urban.

 The Oscar-winning Kidman is set to marry Urban in a lavish wedding this weekend. Details have been carefully guarded, but local media have widely tipped Sunday night for the event.

 Watts ? who was born in Britain but raised in Australia ? is a close friend of Kidman, who she met when the pair were young actresses in Sydney. The King Kong star arrived on a flight from New York early today wearing a grey sweater and black pants, her hair pulled back with a purple head band.

 Watts is also expected to attend a pre-wedding bachelorette party for Kidman.

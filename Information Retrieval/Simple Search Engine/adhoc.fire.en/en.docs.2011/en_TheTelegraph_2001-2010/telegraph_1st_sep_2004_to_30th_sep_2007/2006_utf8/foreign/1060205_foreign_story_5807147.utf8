 Dietary warning on chocolates

 London, Feb. 4 (Reuters): Two of Britains top sweet-makers are to put warning labels on their chocolate bars and other products advising consumers how their favourite treats should be enjoyed as part of a balanced diet.

 Cadbury Trebor Bassett and Masterfoods UK, the makers of confectionery such as Dairy Milk and Mars chocolate bars, said today they will include a Be treatwise message on millions of their products in future.

 The logo informs the consumer about guideline daily amounts (GDAs) ? how much of each nutrient the government recommends people should eat ? and advises the consumer to Be active for 30 minutes.

 People know and love chocolate and sweets as treats and understand these should be enjoyed sensibly, Simon Baldry, UK managing director of Cadbury Trebor Bassett.

 Communicating our Be treatwise message to millions of consumers daily by our packs is the most powerful way we can help people to understand and enjoy our products as part of their diet.

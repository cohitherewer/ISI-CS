 Havana, Dec. 23 (AP): Provisional President Raul Castro called for more discipline and openness in Cubas communist government, telling lawmakers in comments published today there is no excuse for the islands severe transportation and food production problems.

 In this revolution we are tired of excuses, Castro said, giving the strongest sense yet of the frank and demanding leadership style he will likely adopt if his ailing older brother Fidel Castro does not return as President.

 After almost five months with Raul in power, it has become clear that this Castro will ask officials to account for their actions and produce real results, rather than offer mere political platitudes.

 He also has shown he is willing to criticise aspects of the communist system that are not working. The Revolution cannot lie, he said in comments carried by the Communist Party newspaper Granma. This isnt saying that there have been comrades who have lied, but the imprecision, inexact data, consciously or unconsciously masked, can no longer continue.

 Castro spoke yesterday afternoon during a year-end meeting of the National Assembly. Lacking the charisma of his more famous bearded brother, the younger Castro will need to make changes that improve Cubans qualify of life to gain the popular support necessary to govern over the longer term.

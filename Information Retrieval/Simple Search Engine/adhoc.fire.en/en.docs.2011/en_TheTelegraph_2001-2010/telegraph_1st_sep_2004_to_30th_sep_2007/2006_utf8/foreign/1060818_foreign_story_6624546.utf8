 Pirate to barber

 Los Angeles, Aug. 17 (AP): Johnny Depp is going from woozy buccaneer to murderous barber.

 Depp is re-uniting with director Tim Burton (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) to play the title role in a film adaptation of Stephen Sondheims musical Sweeney Todd, about a 19th century barber seeking bloody revenge over his wrongful imprisonment.

 The star of Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Mans Chest, this years biggest hit with a domestic gross of $400 million, is expected to do his own singing, said a spokesman for DreamWorks.

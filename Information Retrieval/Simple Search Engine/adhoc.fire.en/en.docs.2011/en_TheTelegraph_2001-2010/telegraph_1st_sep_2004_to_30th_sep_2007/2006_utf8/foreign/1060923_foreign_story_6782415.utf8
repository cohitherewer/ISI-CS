 Walking damper 

 Washington, Sept. 22 (PTI): Walking may not be enough to experience significant health benefits, a study has found.

 Generally, low-intensity activity such as walking alone is not likely going to give anybody marked health benefits compared to programmes that occasionally elevate the intensity, lead author on the Health First study, Vicki Harber, said.

 She and her colleagues from the faculty of physical education and recreation at the University of Alberta in Canada were concerned that while people with health issues are encouraged to increase their volume of activity such as walking, there did not seem to be much focus on the effort that needed to go into the activity.

 The study put the popular pedometer-friendly 10,000-step exercise programme to the test against a traditional fitness programme, which incorporated cardio-based activities on equipment such as treadmills and stationary bicycles.

 When we matched the two programmes for energy expenditure, we found that the traditional fitness programme improved aerobic fitness and reduced systolic blood pressure more than the 10,000-step lifestyle programme, she said.

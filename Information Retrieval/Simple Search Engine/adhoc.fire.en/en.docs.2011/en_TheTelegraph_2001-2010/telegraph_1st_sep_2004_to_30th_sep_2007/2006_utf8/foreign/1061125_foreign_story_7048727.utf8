 Jerusalem, Nov. 24: A grandmother 

 became the oldest Palestinian suicide bomber yesterday when 

 she blew herself up in Gaza and slightly wounded two Israeli 

 soldiers. 

 Fatma Omar An-Najar was the first suicide bomber to be claimed by Hamas for nearly two years. Its armed wing said that she was aged 57, but her family said that she was 68. Israel said that its soldiers had spotted her and threw a grenade, causing her to set off the explosives early.

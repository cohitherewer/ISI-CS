 Just a kiss

 London, May 17: Kate Moss and Jemima Khan enjoyed a lingering kiss at Annabels nightclub in London on Monday, reports The Daily Telegraph.

 The clinch with the model was the star lot in a charity auction and dinner at the Mayfair club. Philip Green, the 54-year-old boss of Bhs, won the lot with a bid of ?60,000. Perhaps because his wife Tina was at his side he declined the opportunity ? offering the embrace instead to the person he outbid, Hugh Grants girlfriend, Jemima Khan. 

 A guest at the auction and dinner said: We thought it was going to be a kiss on the cheek. It lasted just over 60 seconds. Other lots included a round of golf with Grant, with Jemima caddying, which went for ?12,000, a cricket lesson from Imran Khan, tea with the Archbishop of Canterbury and a childrens bedtime story read by Tilda Swinton, the Narnia actress.

Italy, during his golden period, when he is believed to have crafted 

his finest instruments. Before the sale, Christies had estimated the Hammers

Tennant, a 1699 Stradivarius that sold for $2.03 million at Christies in 

April last year.

 Costly sister kiss

 Cairo, Oct. 18 (AFP): Two young Egyptians caught in the act of kissing in public in Cairo during the Muslim holy month of Ramazan have been fined $17.50 each, newspapers reported today.

 A court in Kasr al-Nil district found the pair guilty of offending public morals when they kissed in broad daylight on the banks of the Nile. The man, aged 25, argued in his defence that his 21-year-old friend was a colleague whom he regarded as a sister and with whom he would exchange a kiss every time their paths crossed.

 Dream elbow

 Los Angeles (Reuters): Picassos famed Dream painting turned into a nightmare for Las Vegas casino magnate Steve Wynn when he accidentally gave the multimillion dollar canvas an elbow. Wynn had just finalised a $139 million sale to another collector of his painting, called Le Reve (The Dream), when he poked a finger-sized hole in the artwork while showing it to friends at his Las Vegas office. Director and screenwriter Nora Ephron, said Wynn had raised his hand to show the group something about Picassos 1932 portrait of his mistress Marie-Therese Walter. At that moment, his elbow crashed backward right through the canvas.

 Killer dies in school raid

 Emsdetten 

 (Germany), Nov. 20 (Reuters): A masked man wearing 

 explosives and brandishing rifles opened fire after storming 

 a school in the western German town of Emsdetten today, 

 wounding at least 11 people before he committed suicide.

 Police identified the man as an 18-year old former pupil at the Scholl secondary school where the attack took place. He was known to authorities and due in court tomorrow for weapons violations, they said.

 German television broadcast pictures they said came from the mans website, showing him standing in a forest in camouflaged military fatigues and brandishing a hi-tech rifle. The website contained a note warning of his plans, by mid-afternoon, police said.

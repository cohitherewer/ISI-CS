 Clooney does not regret joke

 Los Angeles, Feb. 18 (AP): George Clooney, who may be giving speeches again at next months Academy Awards, says he has no regrets about making an off-colour joke about disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff during last months Golden Globes.

 I make no apologies for that ? it was a joke, Clooney told CNNs Larry King on Thursday. The 44-year-old actor-director made a risque reference to Abramoffs name as he accepted a best supporting actor Golden Globe for Syriana. Clooney is nominated for Oscars for best supporting actor for Syriana and best director for Good Night, and Good Luck. 

 Abramoffs father, Frank, who didnt find the joke funny, wrote an angry letter to The Desert Sun newspaper of Palm Springs. He denounced Clooney for a glib and ridiculous attack on his son.

 The right hangman

 London, June 2 (Reuters): It was not a job everyone wanted but British officials strived to uphold high standards when filling the post of hangman.

 They rejected applicants in 1938, including the chatty, the morally dubious and the morbid to keep executions dignified, documents released by Britains national archives showed.

 The need for an alert mind and healthy body also provoked concern among prison officials as to whether one of Britains longest serving hangmen, Thomas Pierrepoint, was up to the job after 70 in 1940. 

 Tall China 

 Beijing (Reuters): Chinese children are growing taller, forcing the Beijing city government to raise the height limit for free bus rides and other perks by 10 cm, the state media has said. Regulations adopted in 1949 originally stated that any child both below 7 years of age and below 1.1 metres was eligible for free bus rides, free entry to parks and theatres and free school lunches. Xinhua news agency said the average height of a Chinese 5-year-old was currently 1.2 metres, meaning a lot of children aged between 5 and 7 felt they were being short changed.

 War clips 

 Boston (Reuters): A US war veteran who lost both arms in Iraq has sued Oscar-winning director Michael Moore for $85 million, saying television clips were used without his permission in the anti-war documentary Fahrenheit 9/11 and gave a false impression that he opposed the war. Sgt. Peter Damon, 33, a supporter of President George W. Bush and the war, claims Moore portrayed him in a false light.

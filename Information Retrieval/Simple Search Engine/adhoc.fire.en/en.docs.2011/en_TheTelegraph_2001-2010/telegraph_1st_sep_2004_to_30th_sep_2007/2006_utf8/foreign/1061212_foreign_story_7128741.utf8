 Lock away Maoist arms first: Koirala

 Koirala: Stumbling block

 Kathmandu, Dec. 11 (Reuters): Nepals Maoists will only be included in an interim government after their arms are locked in stores under UN supervision, Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala said today.

 Last month, the government and Maoist guerrillas signed a landmark peace deal declaring an end to a decade-old conflict in which more than 13,000 people died. The deal envisaged the Maoists joining an interim cabinet and confining their fighters to camps, as well as locking arms in containers monitored by the UN.

 But uncertainty over the storage of weapons and jockeying between the rebels and the political parties meant a December 1 deadline for the Maoists to join the interim government was missed.

 Koirala said elections for a special Assembly to map Nepals political future, draft a constitution and decide the fate of the monarchy would be held in June 2007. 

 But the Maoists said linking the interim cabinet to the completion of the UN monitoring mission could delay the elections. This is against the agreement, Maoist leader Dev Gurung, a rebel negotiator, said.

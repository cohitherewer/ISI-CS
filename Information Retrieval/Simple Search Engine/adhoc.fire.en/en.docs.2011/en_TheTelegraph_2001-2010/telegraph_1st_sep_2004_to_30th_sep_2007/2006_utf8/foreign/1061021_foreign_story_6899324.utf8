 Diet for freedom

 Sydney, Oct. 20 (Reuters): An Australian prisoner who went on a crash diet so he could squeeze his way out of jail escaped to show authorities that he could go straight on the outside, a court heard today.

 Robert Cole, 37, fasted and used laxatives to lose some 14 kg before he squeezed through a hole he had chiselled with a butter knife to escape from a hospital in a Sydney prison in January.

 Weighing just 56 kg, Cole squeezed through the hole he had made between brickwork and a window frame, scaled a razor-wire fence, walked along a prison wall and then jumped to freedom. He was recaptured three days later.

 Sane habit

 London (Reuters): Pop star George Michael 

 said smoking cannabis kept him sane and happy 

 and appeared to light up a joint during an interview on 

 Britains ITV news channel, ITV said on Friday. It 

 added that Michael sparked up backstage at a 

 gig in Madrid during ITVs South Bank Show. 

 George defends his dope habit, saying it keeps him 

 sane and happy. But he admits its not very healthy, 

 ITV said.

 Moss style

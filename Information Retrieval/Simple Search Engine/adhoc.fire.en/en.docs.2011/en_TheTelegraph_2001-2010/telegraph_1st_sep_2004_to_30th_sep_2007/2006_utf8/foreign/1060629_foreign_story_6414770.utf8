 Double murder

 Liege (Belgium), June 28 (AP): Belgian police today discovered the bodies of two schoolgirls who disappeared almost three weeks ago from a late night street party. Officials said Stacy Lemmens, 7, and Nathalie Mahy, 10, were murdered.

 Priority will be given to uncovering the culprit, or culprits, in this terrible double murder, said Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt said. I can assure you that none of them will get away with this.

 A convicted child rapist, Abdallah Aid Oud, 39, has been charged with the girls kidnapping and has been held by police since handing himself in on June 13. He denies any involvement in their disappearance.

 The bodies were found about 10 meters apart in a storm drain among dense undergrowth beside a railroad track less than 500 meters from the cafe where the stepsisters were last seen before they disappeared in the early hours of June 10. Everything was done to find them alive, said Liege Prosecutor Cedric Visart de Bocarme said. Unfortunately these hopes were dashed by the discovery of these children deceased, or do I need to say it, murdered.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 A toast to Russian space walkers

 SIMON SARADZHYAN 

 Moscow, Jan. 15: After years of official prohibition, cosmonauts will soon be able to unwind with a drink after a hard day at the International Space Station. 

 In a country where vodka is consumed in industrial quantities, officials at Russias medical space research establishment said the consumption of alcohol in space was not only a right but a positive advantage. 

 Folks are flying in orbit for half a year or so, a spokesman said. They do tonnes of work. Especially exhausting are space walks where they can lose several kilos in several hours. Thats why, many of us think that it wont be that bad to have a little drink to replenish ones strength. 

 Russian cosmonauts and space officials welcomed the idea of lifting the ban, but cautioned that weightlessness multiplies the effect of alcohol. 

 Yuri Lanchakov, commander of the Cosmonaut Corps at the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Centre near Moscow, said: Twenty grams of a good cognac (about one pub measure) would be good. He intends to issue a tot to anyone returning after a space walk, and to allow astronauts to drink alcohol to toast New Year. 

 Champagne, however, will remain prohibited as the pressure could turn bottles into small missiles if opened in the gravity-free atmosphere of the space station. 

 An official at Russias Federal Space Agency (Roskosmos) said: Not only could the recoil be unpredictable, but the bottle could explode even before you open it. 

 He welcomed the idea of allowing alcohol on the space station but said everything should be in moderation ? perhaps remembering how in 1994 President Boris Yeltsin failed to emerge from his plane at Shannon Airport in Ireland after imbibing too much. 

 But the Americans are unlikely to follow the Russians lead. Questions about the possibility of lifting the ban for astronauts from the US drew a sober response from the North American Space Agency. 

 The Russians, it seems, are merely giving official sanction to what was once the practice among cosmonauts. 

 Almost every member of the crew of the Mir space station had a bottle of cognac at their disposal.

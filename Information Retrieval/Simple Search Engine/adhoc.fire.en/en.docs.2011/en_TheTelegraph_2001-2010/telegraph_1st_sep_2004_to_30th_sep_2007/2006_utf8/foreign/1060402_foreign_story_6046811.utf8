 Clooney website trick

 Clooney: In attack mode

 Los Angeles, April 1 (AP): George Clooney is known as a prankster, but his plan to undermine a website that posts celebrity sightings is no joke, his publicist has said.

 Clooney has suggested swamping Gawker.coms Gawker Stalker feature with false notes about stars whereabouts, spokesman Stan Rosenfield said.

 In an email Rosenfield recently distributed on Clooneys behalf to other high-powered publicists, the actor calls for publicity firms and their clients to join the effort against the site that some have called a threat to celebrities.

 There is a simple way to render these guys useless, Clooney said in the message. Flood their website with bogus sightings. Get your clients to get 10 friends to text in fake sightings of any number of stars.

 A couple hundred conflicting sightings and this website is worthless. No need to try to create new laws to restrict free speech. Just make them useless. Thats the fun of it. 

 And then sit back and enjoy the ride, Clooney writes, signing the note: Thanks, George.

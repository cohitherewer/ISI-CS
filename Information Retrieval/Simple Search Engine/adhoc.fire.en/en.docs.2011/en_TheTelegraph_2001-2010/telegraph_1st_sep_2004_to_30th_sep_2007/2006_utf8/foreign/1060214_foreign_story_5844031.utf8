 The face of love

 Shanghai, Feb. 13 (Reuters): Why proffer roses or chocolate when you can serve up the perfect face for your sweetheart this Valentines Day?

 As the traditional lovers day approached in China, plastic surgery clinics in trend-setting Shanghai reported a huge rise in business.

 The most popular operations were eyebrow remoulding and eyelid doubling, where an extra crease is added to the upper eyelid to make the eyes look larger.

 Sweet gift

 Seoul (Reuters): Valentines Day in South Korea is a time when the attention of the countrys massive army turns to romance and a mission to spread love via military transport. Under the Valentines Day tradition in South Korea, women give chocolates to men. And with compulsory service of two years for young men and a military of almost 700,000 troops, that translates into a lot of sweets.The sweets are sent to regular post offices and the military sends its trucks to pick up the parcels and take them on base.

 Fest fever

 New York (AP): The Sundance Film Festival is too intense for Robert Redford, who says he wasnt around for all of it this year. To the outside world, its a big fat market where you have people like Paris Hilton going to parties. Now, she doesnt have anything to do with anything. I think the festival is close to being out of control, the festivals creator said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Strongest man

 Charleston, West Virginia, Sept. 26 (AP): A firefighter who travelled to China to compete in the Worlds Strongest Man competition has become the first American in 24 years to win the title.

 The 6-foot-6, 146-kg Phil Pfister defeated 25 athletes from around the world in events such as bus pulls, car pushes, tire turns and stone lifts.

 Pfister was in second place behind defending champion Mariusz Pudzianowski of Poland but won the last five events. 

 He overtook Pudzianowski in the final event, in which competitors carry stones, some weighing hundreds of pounds, from one pillar to another.

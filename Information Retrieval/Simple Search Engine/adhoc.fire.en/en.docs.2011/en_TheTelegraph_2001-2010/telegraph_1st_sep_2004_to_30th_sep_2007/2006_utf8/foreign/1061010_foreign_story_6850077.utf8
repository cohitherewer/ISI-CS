 Almodovar scared of losing out to Hollywood

 Cruz: Comical

 New York, Oct. 9 (AP): Oscar-winning director Pedro Almodovar says he would like to make a movie in English but is scared of losing his independence in Hollywood.

 Part of my career I would like to make a movie in English, the Spanish director told an audience at a New Yorker Festival event on Saturday, adding that he had been approached several times to make a film in the US.

 But he said he feared the Hollywood production system. I was always scared of losing my independence and freedom.

 My experience, talking with other directors here, even Scorsese. I said, oh my God, this is incredible. I feel more lucky than you, I mean I work in much better conditions than you. It was Scorsese.

 Almodovars latest film Volver a comic drama starring Penelope Cruz about women making do without men opens in the US in November.

 Volver marks the first time Almodovar and Carmen Maura, who was featured in many of his earlier films, have worked together in 17 years.

 She became the actress that understood me better and the best instrument that I ever worked with. It was like she was perfectly tuned just to be directed by me, Almodovar told the festival audience.

 But he said they fell out during the making of Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown, his first major international success.

 Almodovar said he approached Maura to be in Volver after writing the script but he was worried that their chemistry would not be the same. When you have that experience of having that kind of chemistry with someone, its even much stronger than love, than sexual relations. Its something very deep, he explained.

 Volver also reunited Almodovar with Cruz, who starred in All About My Mother. I really wanted to work with her again. We have been friends for 12 years, he said, praising her inner strength and vulnerability.

 I dont know how she does it, she is amazing. She has this mix. Above all, she knows how to articulate both things.

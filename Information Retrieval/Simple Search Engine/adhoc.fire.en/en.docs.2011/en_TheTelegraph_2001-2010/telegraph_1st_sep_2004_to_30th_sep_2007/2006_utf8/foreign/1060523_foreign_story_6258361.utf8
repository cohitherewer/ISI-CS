 Unpaid dues ground two Pak airlines

 Karachi, May 22 (Reuters): Pakistan has grounded two private airlines until they pay millions of rupees owed in landing rights and other operational dues, an official of the countrys aviation watchdog said today.

 Karachi-based Aero Asia and Shaheen Airlines, a concern of the Pakistan Air Forces Shaheen Foundation, owe 444 million rupees ($7.4 million) between them, according to Tahir Ahsan Malik, director of Pakistans Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), said. They will not be allowed to resume their operations until they clear their dues, Malik said.

 Aero Asias chief operating officer, Humza Tabani, said the CAAs decision came as a surprise for the airline. We are in touch with the CAA and hopefully will resume our operations very soon, he said.

 Officials of Shaheen Airlines were not immediately available for comments. Aero Asia has four aircraft, two Boeing 737-200 and two MD-82s, while Shaheen has only one aircraft in their fleet.

 Afghan failure 

 Pakistan rejected today allegations by Afghan officials that al Qaida and Taliban fighters were operating from its territory, saying the government in Kabul should put its own house in order.

 The Afghan governments failure to deal with the situation cannot be placed at Pakistans door, Tasnim Aslam, Pakistans foreign ministry spokeswoman, said.

 The two neighbours became embroiled in a war of words in late February, after Afghan President Hamid Karzai gave a list of Taliban commanders living in Pakistan to authorities in Islamabad.

 Munich awash in beer

 Munich, Sept. 16 (Reuters): Munich opened its doors to thousands of beer-drinking merrymakers today as the worlds biggest folk festival, the Oktoberfest, got under way in celebrations which this year last two days longer than usual.

 Germans, in party mood after the World Cup and cheered by a pickup in the economy, have 18 days to consume millions of litres of beer and hundreds of thousands of sausages as the festival has been extended to include October 3s public holiday.

 This year, Germany has had many emotional highlights the World Cup, which produced high spirits and a positive national feeling, and this week we had the Pope visit with its spiritual side, festival director Gabriele Weishaeuple said.

 Munich mayor Christian Ude broke open the first keg at midday and declared the 173rd festival open with the words zapft is, or the barrel is tapped. 

 That was the cue for the oompah bands to start up and armies of buxom waitresses to begin serving litres of beer to the 100,000 thirsty guests squashed around long wooden tables in the 14 heaving beer tents.

 Serious films make Oscar ratings drop

 Stewart: Flop or hit?

 Los Angeles, March 7 (Reuters): Warning: Films about racial conflict, gay cowboys, Israeli assassins and effete New York intellectuals may be hazardous to your Oscar ratings, Nielsen Media Research figures revealed yesterday.

 Sundays Academy Awards telecast averaged 38.8 million viewers, down nearly 8 per cent from last year, bearing out predictions that a relative lack of star power and the serious, art-house subject matter of Oscar-nominated films such as Crash, Brokeback Mountain, Munich and Capote would dampen interest in this years show.

 Meanwhile, critics debated whether political satirist Jon Stewart was a flop or a hit as a first-time Oscar host. Those cheering his performance, including the Los Angeles Times and TVs movie-review duo Ebert and Roeper, said he earned himself a place as permanent emcee.

 The three-and-a-half-hour ceremony, capped by the surprise triumph of racial drama Crash over gay love story Brokeback Mountain, drew the smallest US TV audience since 2003, when 33 million tuned in to see the musical Chicago named best picture days after the US-led invasion of Iraq began.

 Before that, the last Oscar telecast to draw a smaller audience goes back to 1987, when Oliver Stones Vietnam War drama Platoon clinched the big prize and 37.2 million viewers watched the show.

 By comparison, last years ceremony, which crowned boxing drama Million Dollar Baby as 2004s best film, drew 42.1 million viewers.

 Nielsen ratings for the Oscars and other entertainment awards shows have generally declined over the years, though they tend to spike in years when films that packed the multiplexes also figured prominently at the Oscars.

 That was not the case this year, as none of the five movies nominated for the top prize made a huge impact at the box office. And many of the performers nominated in the major categories, such as best actor winner Philip Seymour Hoffman, were hardly household names.

 The Oscar-sponsoring Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and the ABC network had hoped Stewart, a popular host of cable TVs faux newscast The Daily Show, could generate additional interest this year, especially among young viewers who make up the core of his fan base.

 Mothers delay babies for benefits

 Berlin, Dec. 26 (Reuters): Expectant mothers in Germany are doing what they can to put off giving birth until January 1 when a generous government aid programme takes effect.

 The media has been filled with tips and warnings from doctors and midwives about holding off birth until January 1. While experts have warned women to refrain from medical intervention to delay births, they acknowledge the allure of a financial incentive worth up to 25,200 euros ($33,300).

 Worried about a birth rate at a post-war low in 2005, the government in September introduced the law to encourage working couples to have children. Babies born on or after January 1 qualify for the new benefits.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Fine Print

 Baring bother

 Paris, July 29 (Reuters): Parisian sunbathers will no longer be allowed to go nude or wear g-strings on the capitals artificial beaches and risk a fine if they are caught baring their breasts or buttocks.

 City hall has issued a decree banning indecent clothing to preserve the tranquillity of the sandy beaches created on the banks of the Seine river every summer since 2001.

 The city police will be enforcing the rules, and anyone caught baring too much flesh risks a 38 euro ($48) fine.

 Dead sport

 London (Reuters): An English 

 fishing town has banned the sport of conger cuddling after 

 an animal activist complained. The tradition, once described 

 as the most fun a person could have with a dead fish, involves 

 one team trying to hit another with a conger eel tied to 

 a rope. It was popular in Lyme Regis on Englands south 

 coast and used as a fund-raising event for the local lifeboat.

 Ozzy music

 New York (Reuters): Former Black Sabbath frontman Ozzy Osbourne is working on two new albums and the first one could be ready by February. I dont want to release an album if its not a great album, the 1970s heavy metal pioneer said in New York on Friday, declining to give many details about the album. I primarily write an album for myself, and if the world likes it, great, he said.

 Car heave

 Phoenix, Arizona (Reuters): A hefty 

 bystander at a road accident in southern Arizona heaved 

 a car clean off a trapped teenage cyclist, possibly saving 

 his life, police said on Friday. Eighteen-year-old Kyle 

 Holtrust was struck by a car as he pedalled along a Tucson 

 highway late on Wednesday and pinned beneath it. Tucson 

 paintshop worker Tom Boyle grabbed the Chevrolet Camaro 

 car and lifted it, allowing the driver to haul the injured 

 cyclist clear.

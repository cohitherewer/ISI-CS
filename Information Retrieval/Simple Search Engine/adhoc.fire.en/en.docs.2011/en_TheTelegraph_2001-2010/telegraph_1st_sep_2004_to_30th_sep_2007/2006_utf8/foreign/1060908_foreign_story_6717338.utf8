 Modern Dylan

 Los Angeles, Sept. 7 (Reuters): Bob Dylan reached the top of the US pop albums chart for the first time in 30 years today, becoming the oldest living person to launch a new disc at number one.

 The 65-year-old rock poets latest album, Modern Times, sold 192,000 copies in the week ending on September 3, his best sales week since tracking firm Nielsen SoundScan started to collate the charts in 1991. Johnny Cash had a number one album recently, but it was released posthumously.

 We couldnt be more thrilled that fans have responded to it so enthusiastically by putting Bob at number one, which is where he belongs, said Steve Barnett, the chairman of Dylans Columbia Records label.

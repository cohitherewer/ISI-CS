 Gyanendra subdued

 Kathmandu, July 7 (Reuters): Nepals increasingly isolated King Gyanendra, forced to give up all power by democracy protests in April, marked his 60th birthday with subdued celebrations today as a cloud hangs over the future of the monarchy.

 About 4,000 people, including Buddhist monks in maroon robes, Hindu priests in white loincloths, members of the kings ousted administration and their families took part in the celebration. But it was a much smaller affair at the Narayanhity palace.

 For the first time in years, government offices and schools stayed open and ministers skipped the ceremony. The king is now little more than a tourist attraction, Kunda Dixit, editor of the Nepali Times weekly, said.

 Living dangerously in suburban London

 London, May 13: 

 Like so many people living in London, Nisha Patel-Nasri 

 and her husband Fadi did not have to travel far to reach 

 a crime hot-spot.

 The reverse is also true. Criminals, probably car thieves interested in the limousines Patel hired out, did not have to travel far to prey on them. Though the Patels home is in an area that is not regarded as trendy or up-and-coming, it still boasts respectable, large 1930s houses on pleasant, wide roads signalling potentially rich pickings for criminals. 

 Nisha Patel-Nasri died in the borough of Brent, one of the highest crime areas in London, with 35,140 offences in the 12 months to March including 2,247 muggings, 2,557 home break-ins, 4,823 vehicle crimes and 8,253 incidents of violence.

 The area of Brent around Wembley was once solidly middle-class but it has changed, becoming one of the most racially diverse areas of London. White families live alongside long-established black communities and newer immigrants from Somalia and eastern Europe, with a large population of students.

 Typically, such areas score low on socio-economic measures, despite the pockets of relative affluence, and many who live there fall victim to the criminals in their midst. 

 Brent, like some other boroughs, has suffered from a resurgence of street robbers in the past year, after government funding for the street crime initiative of 2002 dried up and lengthy surveillance operations became more difficult to mount.

 Experience has shown that a hard core of street thugs are not only involved in mugging ? and sometimes stabbing ? robbery victims, but also move readily into car theft, drugs and other offences. 

 Nisha Patel was stabbed in the leg, echoing other street crimes in which such wounds are inflicted to intimidate, with little care for the risk of severing a major blood vessel. 

 The special constable lived in the Sudbury ward, which has levels of crime lower than the boroughs average and below the average for the Metropolitan Police or Met area. However, Sudbury stretches to the west, towards Harrow. Her home was on the far east side, only minutes from Wembley Central, where crime rates tell a different story. Despite the worldwide fame of the stadium, Wembley ? particularly Wembley Central ward ? suffers considerably higher crime rates than the borough and the Met area.

 In the 12 months to March, there were 13.6 robberies per 1,000 population, compared with 8.2 for Brent and 5.8 for the Met. Robberies rose sharply in 2005, putting Wembley Central on a par with the more challenged wards of boroughs such as Hackney.

 The rate per 1,000 for violence against the person was 51.4, compared with 28.1 for Brent and 25.5 for the Met, though this figure had fallen on the previous year.

 Kiri Kumar, 45, a care manager who lives opposite Nisha Patel-Nasri and her husband, said she had been worried by drug dealers using an alley beside her home. Ive seen young men arriving by car and disappearing down the alley. Some times there is shouting and fighting.

 I call the police but they dont turn up for weeks, she added. We should move house but we have lived here for 20 years. Its always been such a quiet area. Residents were thinking of setting up a neighbourhood watch.

 Milan Kamder, a Conservative candidate in the local elections, said his Mercedes had been broken into three times. He added: We would like to see more patrols around here and we have called the police a number of times, but they are only interested in serious crimes.

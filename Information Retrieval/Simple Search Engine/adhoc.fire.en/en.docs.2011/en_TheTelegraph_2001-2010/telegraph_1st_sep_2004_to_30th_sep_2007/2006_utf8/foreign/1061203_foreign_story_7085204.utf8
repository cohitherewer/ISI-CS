 Castro absent at birthday parade

 Havana, Dec. 2 (Reuters): Tanks rolled through the streets and jets roared overhead today in Havanas first military parade in a decade, but ailing leader Fidel Castro did not appear at what had been viewed as a test of his political future.

 Hundreds of thousands of flag-waving Cubans marched past a reviewing stand in Havanas Revolution Square in salute to the aging commandant who was nowhere to be seen, apparently too ill to attend.

 His inability to show up at the event marking his 80th birthday and the 50th anniversary of the start of the revolution that put him in power had already accelerated speculation that his 47-year rule of Cuba is coming to an end.

 It means he will not return to power, thats for sure. Otherwise he would have made it, said a European diplomat who attended the parade but asked not to be identified.

 Castro has not been seen in public since emergency surgery in late July that forced him to temporarily turn over power to his brother Raul Castro. He has appeared feeble in the few photos and videos released by the government.

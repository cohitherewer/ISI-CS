 London, Sept. 17 (Reuters): One of the main backers of London Fashion Week today rejected British government calls for a ban on wafer-thin models as the fashion industry faced a furore over its catwalks.

 Outright bans and indeed legislation is definitely not a route we want to go down, said Marks and Spencer CEO Stuart Rose, who is chairman of the British Fashion Council that is organising the event which starts tomorrow.

 He was responding to a plea from culture secretary Tessa Jowell for London to follow Madrids example and ban skinny models.

 Madrid fashion organisers have rejected underweight women, saying they wanted to project an image of beauty and health not a waif-like look.

 The new Spanish rules say models with a body mass index (BMI) a ratio of height to weight below 18 are not allowed to appear at the shows.

 Urging London to follow Madrids example, Jowell said: The fashion industrys promotion of beauty as meaning stick thin is damaging to young girls self-image and to their health. 

 The fashion industry is hugely powerful in shaping the attitude of teenage girls and their feelings about themselves, she said.

 Rejecting her call, Rose said: Are we going to ask people to walk through detectors for BMI and say Im sorry youre rejected? That would be quite difficult.

 Body Mass is just an indication, he said. It is just a guide. You cannot use it as an absolute.

 We just need to be reasonable, educate people, give them the facts and let them make up their own minds, Rose said.

 But the move to ban skinny models could well gather momentum across the fashion world.

 The mayor of Milan, Letizia Moratti, has said she will seek a similar ban for Milan Fashion Week starting in a weeks time unless it can find a solution to sick looking models.

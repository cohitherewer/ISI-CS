 Cartoon smoke

 London, Aug. 21 (Reuters): They chase each other at high speed wielding axes and hammers. But the famous cartoon duo of Tom and Jerry are in trouble in Britain for smoking on screen.

 Media regulator Ofcom received a complaint from a viewer who took offence at two episodes involving smoking. In one, Texas Tom, the hapless cat Tom tries to impress a feline female by rolling a cigarette, lighting it and smoking it with one hand. In the other, Tennis Chumps, Toms opponent in a match smokes a large cigar.

 Ofcom said that the Turner company, licensee for Boomerang which aired the cartoons, had agreed to edit some smoking scenes out of Tom and Jerry.

 Diva dare

Dusseldorf (AP): Madonna brought her worldwide Confessions 

tour to Germany over the weekend, complete with a mock crucifixion scene that 

recently drew criticism in Italy. The pop diva drew a crowd of 45,000 in Duesseldorf 

on Sunday night.

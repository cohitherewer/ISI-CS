 Rodeo runaway

 Lewiston, Maine, June 11 (AP): A one-ton rodeo bull escaped from a pen, setting off a chase that involved police and a horseback rider before the animal was captured in a backyard. 

 Dirty Rider apparently jumped a fence at the venue of a professional bull-riding event. He was cornered and roped within 15 minutes, but he gave handlers a battle and neighbours a start before being herded into a trailer. 

 I was going to go to the rodeo tonight, said a man, watching at a safe distance. I guess it came to me instead. 

 Everyone came away fine, a police officer said, except for one unhappy bull.

 Hilton hits 

 Los Angeles (AP): Paris Hilton had a fender-bender accident when her Range Rover backed into a car in a parking garage after a shopping trip. 

 A videotape on TMZ.com showed the actress getting into the car, saying goodbye to someone and backing up. The sound of a crash followed. The video showed scrapes on the bumpers of both vehicles. 

 Hiltons Rover stopped briefly after hitting the parked Honda Civic and then headed towards the exit. The site indicated that she did not leave her contact information for the Hondas owner and thus may have violated laws against hit-and-run. She was swarmed by paparazzi, her publicist argued.

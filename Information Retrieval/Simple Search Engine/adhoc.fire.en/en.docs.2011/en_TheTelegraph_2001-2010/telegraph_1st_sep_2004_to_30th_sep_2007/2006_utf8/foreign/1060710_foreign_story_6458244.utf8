 Kabul, July 9 (Reuters): Models strode down a catwalk in the Afghan capital Kabul for the first time in decades this weekend as two designers showed off their clothes behind the guarded walls of a luxury hotel.

 An audience of expatriates and well-heeled Afghans watched the show in Hotel Garden, under a clear midsummer nights sky, to the strains of traditional Afghan music.

 All of the models showing the conservatively cut clothes that included designer burqas were expatriate women, to the disappointment of some in the audience.

 The organisers said they did not want to court controversy in what is a deeply conservative Muslim country by having Afghan models.

 We invited a lot of Afghan women to attend the show but not to be models, said Italian designer Gabriella Ghidoni, who organised the show with an Afghan partner.

 The Taliban forced women to wear the all-enveloping burqa but nearly five years after the hardline Islamists were ousted, many women still choose to wear burqas when they are out.

 The models should have been Afghan, but we know that many families still dont allow their daughters to do things like this, said a member of the audience, Nooria Farhad.

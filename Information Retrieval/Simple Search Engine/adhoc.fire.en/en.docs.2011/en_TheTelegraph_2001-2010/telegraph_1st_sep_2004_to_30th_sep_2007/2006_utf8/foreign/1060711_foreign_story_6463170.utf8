 Maoists not to lay down arms

 Bhattarai: New twist

 Kathmandu, July 10 (Reuters): Nepals Maoist rebels will not surrender their arms before next years elections for a special Assembly to map out the embattled Himalayan nations political future, a top rebel leader said today.

 Let everybody be clear ? well never surrender our arms, Baburam Bhattarai, seen as number two to Maoist chief Prachanda, said in an interview.

 We want the restructuring of the state and the army. In that restructured army our army will also be integrated.

 The US, which provides $45 million aid annually to Nepal ? more than 10 per cent of total aid ? has threatened to withdraw funds if the Maoists, who it lists as terrorists, joins the interim government without giving up arms.

 The Maoists, who supported this years pro-democracy protests, began peace talks with the new multi-party government in May.

 But, Bhattarai said progress had been slow.

 Basically there seems to be lack of political willpower on the part of some in the government, he said, sitting on the balcony of a Kathmandu building.

 However, Bhattarai, who is considered a key ideologue of the rebels, said he and Prachanda were quietly meeting diplomats and political leaders to boost talks.

 There is tremendous pressure from the people who want to make the peace process a success, Bhattarai said, adding that the rebels would not return to war.

 Moral glare on Moss millions 

 DAVID HARRISON 

 London, Sept. 3: When Kate Moss was photographed apparently snorting cocaine in a London recording studio, her glittering career as a supermodel looked over. But now, a year later, the disgraced 32-year-old seems to have been rehabilitated fully into the multi-million-pound fashion world. 

 Moss has re-emerged as the face of the autumn, adorning endless hoardings, magazine covers and television commercials and being paid, it has emerged, more than three times as much as she was before the scandal broke. 

 The controversial Croydon-born model has picked up contracts worth almost 14 million, compared with 4.5 million before the grainy photographs of her alleged drug-taking hit the headlines. But her apparently triumphant return to the limelight, and accompanying millions, has left a sour taste for many critics. 

 According to drugs charities, she represents a poor role model for young people and the companies dishing out her multi-million-pound contracts are immoral. They described the fashion industry as fickle and accused it of pursuing profit regardless of the consequences. 

 Peter Stoker, the director of the National Drug Prevention Alliance, said the companies should have urged her to straighten up her act and were trivialising the impact of drug use and sending out the wrong message to young would-be models. 

 The world of commerce is immoral and the companies are exploiting Mosss notoriety to increase their profits, he said. She is a poor role model. We see parents at their wits end because their teenage children are taking drugs. Drug-taking is not glamorous. It is a huge problem in the UK that is causing misery and death. 

 A spokesman for Sane, the mental health charity, said: It is very dangerous to glamorise a lifestyle that involves taking drugs, but that is what is happening here. By rewarding Kate Moss with bigger contracts, the companies are effectively condoning drug-taking. 

 Moss went into rehab for a month after the photographs were published last September and many companies appeared eager to distance themselves from her. But it did not last. Moss was barely out of the clinic when she received the first of many offers of lucrative new deals. 

 Only H amp;M and Chanel dropped her for her alleged drug-taking. 

 The others were soon pleading for her signature with what one critic described as indecent haste, calculating that her new-found notoriety would help to sell even more of their products. And the deals came thick and fast, with Roberto Cavalli paying her 100,000 for a modelling assignment just days after she left rehab. 

 Over the next 11 months, the fashion designer was followed by Rimmel (3 million), Bulgari (1.6 million), Burberry (1.5 million), Calvin Klein (1.5 million), Nikon (1.5 million), Virgin Mobile (1.2 million), Stella McCartney (1 million), Dior (1 million), Belstaff (1 million), Longchamp (500,000) and Louis Vuitton (undisclosed). 

 The model, whose daughter Lila Grace, is four this month has also done cover shoots for Vogue, Vanity Fair and W magazines. 

 Meanwhile, a 250,000 police investigation into her alleged drug-taking ended in farce when officers said they could not prove which drug it was.

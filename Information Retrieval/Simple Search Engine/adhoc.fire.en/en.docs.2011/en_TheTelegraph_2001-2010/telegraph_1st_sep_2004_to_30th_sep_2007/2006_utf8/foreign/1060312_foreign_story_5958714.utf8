 Police end Paris student protests

 Paris, March 11 (Reuters): French riot police used teargas to break up a three-day sit-in at Pariss Sorbonne university today, stirring up memories of May 1968, as angry students warned of a mounting challenge to government labour reforms.

 Students had occupied the prestigious faculty, the centre of Frances 1968 riots, since Wednesday to protest against the youth jobs plan, which has sent conservative Prime Minister Dominique de Villepins popularity tumbling.

 French media said interior minister Nicolas Sarkozy had cut short a trip to the French West Indies because of the protests, the worst disturbances since weeks of suburban riots ending in November focused attention on poverty and led to curfews.

 Police stormed the Sorbonne just before 0300 GMT, forcing out around 200 students staging the protest and arresting 11 people, a police spokesman said.

 Two people were being treated for minor injuries including a photographer who was struck as demonstrators threw bottles, chairs and fire extinguishers at the police.

 Police moved into the university building after students had also blocked off the square outside the Sorbonne as well as the Boulevard St Michel in the heart of the Latin Quarter.

 Thousands of people have protested this week at Villepins plan to introduce a flexible First Employment Contract (CPE), which critics say will allow employers to hire and fire young workers more easily, with students demonstrating across France.

 We have the impression the government has decided to respond to the student movement with truncheons and repression, Bruno Julliard, president of students union UNEF. If the government wants to continue using force to wage a battle for the CPE, as Villepin says, then we are heading towards a serious conflict.

 Education minister Gilles de Robien said protesters had destroyed books and questioned whether all were real students. When I see young people, students, or people who claim to be students, starting to destroy our national heritage, which has been built up over centuries, destroying old books, smashing objects, vandalising the building, then I think it is right that the Sorbonne should be evacuated, he said.

 Julliard denied reports that some of the protesters included disaffected showbusiness workers who have orchestrated repeated demonstrations across France for the past three years to campaign for better working conditions.

 After fostering a decisive, no-nonsense image when he was promoted to revive conservative President Jacques Chiracs ailing government last year, Villepin has seen his once solid popularity hit the new employment plan.

 An opinion poll published showed a seven-point fall in his approval rating.

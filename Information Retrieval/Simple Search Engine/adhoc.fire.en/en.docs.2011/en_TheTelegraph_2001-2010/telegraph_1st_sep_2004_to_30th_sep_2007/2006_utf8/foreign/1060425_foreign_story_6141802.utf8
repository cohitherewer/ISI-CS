 No place on Earth for Moussaoui, court hears

 Alexandria (Virginia), April 24 (Reuters): A US attorney told the jury considering the fate of Zacarias Moussaoui today that after weeks of heart-wrenching testimony it was time to sentence the Sept. 11 conspirator to death.

 Let me be blunt, ladies and gentlemen, said prosecutor David Raskin. There is no place on this good Earth for Zacarias Moussaoui.

 Raskin presented his closing arguments for the jury to return a death sentence. He was followed by defence attorneys who argued Moussaoui, 37, an admitted al Qaida follower, should be given life in prison.

 The jury, which is only deciding the sentencing since Moussaoui has pleaded guilty to six conspiracy counts relating the September 11 plot, was expected to begin deliberations later. As the jury left for a morning break, Moussaoui said: Youll never get me, America. Never ever.

 Raskin said Moussaoui was pleased with his role in the plot and was elated that al Qaida murdered 2,972 innocent people on September 11.

 Enough is enough, Raskin said.It is time to put an end to his hatred and venom.

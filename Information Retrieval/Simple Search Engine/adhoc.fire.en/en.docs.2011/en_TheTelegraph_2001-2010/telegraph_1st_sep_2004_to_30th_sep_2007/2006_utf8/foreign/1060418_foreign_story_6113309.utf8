 World Briefs

 Iran nuke issue 

 Kuwait, April 17 (Reuters): Iran will continue to enrich uranium, influential former Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani said today, as concerns grow over possible US military action against Tehrans nuclear programme. 

 Iran announced last week it had enriched uranium 

for use in its power stations, stoking a diplomatic row with the West which suspects 

Tehran is trying to build an atomic bomb. 

Iraq murder 

 Baghdad (Reuters): Gunmen killed the brother of a top Iraqi Sunni politician on Monday in the second killing in days of a relative of a Sunni leader as deadlock over a unity government showed no sign of loosening. Saleh al-Mutlak, a wealthy businessman with links to former Baathists close to the insurgency, headed an Arab nationalist list which has 11 seats in parliament. 

 Racist attack 

 Berlin (Reuters): A 37-year-old Ethiopian immigrant has been in critical condition after being severely beaten in a racist attack. He was attacked while waiting for a streetcar in the centre of Potsdam in Berlin on Sunday. 

 Pak rally 

 Muzaffarabad (Reuters): Police on Monday baton-charged a 

rally by earthquake survivors demanding compensation for destroyed or damaged 

homes. The protesters were mainly students.

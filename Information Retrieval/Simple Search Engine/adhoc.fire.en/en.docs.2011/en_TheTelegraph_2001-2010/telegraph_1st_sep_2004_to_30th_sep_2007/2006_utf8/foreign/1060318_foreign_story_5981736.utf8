 US presses on with rebel offensive

 Baghdad, March 17 (Reuters): US-led forces today pressed on with a highly publicised offensive against suspected guerrilla targets near the northern Iraqi town of Samarra in their latest bid to weaken a raging insurgency, witnesses said.

 Operation Swarmer came as Iraqs deeply divided political leadership met again hoping to break a deadlock on forming a unity government that might avert sectarian civil war.

 US military officials yesterday said the operation, involving 50 helicopters, was the biggest air assault since a similar airlift across Iraq just after the war in late April 2003. That operation was also by the 101st Airborne Division.

 Military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Barry Johnson said that US-led forces are searching a 16-km-by 16-km area for guerrillas and that no casualties have been reported by American or Iraqi forces.

 A leading Sunni politician said the US assault would send a discouraging message at a time when Iraqi leaders are seeking a political solution to the countrys woes.

 This large operation that used airplanes is sending a signal to Iraqis that the solution is military and not political, said Saleh Mutlak.

 Iraqi defence ministry spokesman General Salih Sarhan criticised the attention being given to the assault, describing it as one of many operations aimed at rooting out rebels.

 The operation, which comes just ahead of the third anniversary of the US-led invasion which toppled Saddam Hussein, appears to be the latest US effort to show that Iraqi troops are improving their performance against the rebels.

 A US troop withdrawal hinges on whether Iraqi troops can improve their skills after watching rebels armed with extensive intelligence and bombs kill hundreds of their comrades.

 The US ambassador to Iraq, Zalmay Khalilzad, has been mediating tirelessly hoping that Iraqi leaders will finally bury their sharp differences and form a government.

 Iran interference

 Washington is also concerned that interference from regional Shia power Iran, which has close ties to the Shia-led Baghdad government, could further destabilise Iraq. The US embassy in Baghdad again accused Iran of meddling in its neighbours internal affairs, saying it was carrying out unhelpful activities there.

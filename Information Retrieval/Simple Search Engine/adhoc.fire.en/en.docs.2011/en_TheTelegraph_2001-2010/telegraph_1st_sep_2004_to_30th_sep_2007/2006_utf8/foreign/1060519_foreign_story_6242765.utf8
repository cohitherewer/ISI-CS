 Pervez 2nd term hint

 Islamabad, May 18 (Reuters): Pakistans President Pervez Musharraf said he could be voted in for a second five-year term by the current parliament and provincial assemblies before their dissolution for general elections due by the beginning of 2008.

 Analysts said that Musharraf, who came to power in a military coup more than six years ago, appeared to be paving the way for his re-election by lawmakers he can rely on rather than risk a new assembly at a time when his popularity is waning.

 Musharrafs current term expires in mid-November next year, as does parliaments, and a debate has been going on in the media over whether the President could get another five years in power from the outgoing assemblies.

 In an interview with Avt Khyber Television, parts of which were aired today, Musharraf said under the terms of the constitution he should seek re-election up to two months before his term ends. There are no ifs or buts in the constitution, Musharraf told the private Pashto-language channel.

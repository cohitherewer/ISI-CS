 In shadow of gallows, Saddam meets family

 Dubai, Dec. 28 (Reuters): In the shadow of the scaffold, Saddam Hussein met two of his half-brothers yesterday and passed on personal messages to his family, a lawyer said.

 Badie Aref, one of Saddams lawyers, said the rare meeting with maternal half-brothers Sabawi and Watban Ibrahim Hassan al-Tikriti, who are in US custody, was at the request of the ousted Iraqi leader and took place inside his heavily guarded prison cell in Baghdad.

 Aref said Saddam was in very high spirits and had sensed something was happening relating to the sentence when prison guards took away a small radio he had been given several months ago.

 He met Sabawi and Watban and gave them letters to his family in anticipation ... he is clearly unaware of the details of what is happening around him and prepared to give his life as a martyr to his country, Aref said by telephone.

 JUDGEMENT DAY 

 Appeals court upholds Saddam rsquo;s death sentence on December 26 for crimes against humanity

 Court statutes say the sentence should be carried out within 30 days

 Iraqi High Tribunal statutes say that nobody, not even the President, has the power to overturn or lessen the sentence

 Saddam-era Iraqi penal code specifies hanging for civilians, a method formalised under British rule

 The code prescribes hanging ldquo;inside the prison or any other place rdquo;

 Public execution unlikely

 Family to be notified a week 

 in advance and final visit may 

 be a day before execution. 

 Body can be retrieved for burial

A senior US official said yesterday the Iraqi government had told the US that Saddam could be hanged within a few days for crimes against humanity. 

Aref said prison sources who told him of the family meeting said Saddam was aware of an appeals court decision to uphold his death sentence for crimes against humanity during his 24-year rule. He was in very high spirits and clearly readying himself, Aref said during a visit to Dubai. 

 He told them that he was happy he would meet his death at the hands of his enemies and a martyr and not just languish in prison in oblivion. Aref said he was unsure if Saddams third half-brother Barzan al-Tikriti saw the ousted leader.

 TV quandary

 Television networks face a killer of a conundrum with Saddams impending execution, whose hanging could be videotaped and perhaps aired on Iraqi TV.

 The timing of Saddams date with the gallows was unclear, but late yesterday CBS, NBC and Fox News Channel reported that the former dictator would be turned over by the American military to the Iraqi government. 

 Several sources said Saddams execution would be videotaped by the Iraqi government, though it wasnt clear whether it would be released to the public or broadcast. We will video everything, Iraqi national security adviser Mouffak al Rubaie told CBS News.

 Meetings were held yesterday in at least two network headquarters over how to handle the potentially graphic images. ABC and CBS said they wouldnt air the full execution if the video became available.

 Pak to fence Afghan border

 IMTIAZ GUL 

 Islamabad , Dec. 27: Pakistan said yesterday it would fence and mine parts of its border with Afghanistan to prevent Taliban rebels from crossing over and waging their growing rebellion.

 The army has been asked to work out modalities for selectively fencing and mining Pakistans 2,400 km-long border with Afghanistan, foreign secretary Riaz Muhammad Khan said at a press conference in Islamabad yesterday. This is part of our established policy. We are taking measures to prevent any militant activity from Pakistan inside Afghanistan.

 However, Afghanistan immediately rejected the plan as neither helpful nor practical. It said doing so would unfairly divide ethnic Pashtun communities straddling the largely unmarked frontier.

 Khan gave no time-frame for the completion of the fencing but said the army would select the troubled sections on the border. While mining can be done expeditiously, fencing will take a longer time, he added.

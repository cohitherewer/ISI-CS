 Morales First Lady is sister

 Morales: Down to earth

 La Paz (Bolivia), Jan. 28 (Reuters): In the absence of a wife, Bolivian President Evo Morales is widely expected to ask the most important woman in his life to be first lady ? his big sister Esther.

 Perhaps even more than the President, Esther ? who runs a simple grocery store in the poor, highland town of Oruro ? represents the new face of the Bolivian government. She says it would be an honour to serve as First Lady.

 As a Bolivian woman, as an Aymara woman my role would be to serve the nation and help people in need, like abandoned children, Esther said by phone from her Oruro home late on Thursday.

 Weve lived through hard times and this reality ourselves, so we know how it is. Our plan is equality.

 Evo Morales, 46, a Leftist and Aymara Indian who herded llamas as a boy, was sworn in on Sunday as Bolivias first indigenous President, reversing years of political domination by a European-descended elite.

 The Morales family spent their early years in Oruro province, but a devastating drought prompted them to migrate to the Chapare region where they started farming coca leaves.

 Four of the familys seven children died as babies. Only Evo, Esther and a younger brother called Hugo survived.

 Esther, 50, who wears the traditional Indian dress of a wide skirt and bowler hat, said she might have to hang up her shopkeepers apron if confirmed as First Lady.

 But, until any announcement was made, she was ignoring the constant newspaper, radio and television reports and continuing her normal routine.

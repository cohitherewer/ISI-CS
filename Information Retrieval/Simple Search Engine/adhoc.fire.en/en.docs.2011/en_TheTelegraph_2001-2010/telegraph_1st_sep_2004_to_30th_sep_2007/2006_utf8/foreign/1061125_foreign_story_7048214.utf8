 Brangelina on Vietnam city tour

 Ho Chi Minh City (Vietnam ), Nov. 24 (AP): Instead of stuffing themselves with turkey, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie spent Thanksgiving cruising around Vietnams largest city on a motorbike.

 Pitt was spotted driving the motorbike through the city centre with Jolie perched on the seat behind him yesterday in a country where virtually everyone travels on the two-wheeled machines. The couple later dined at a popular Vietnamese restaurant converted from an old temple.

 When asked by a local reporter from Tuoi Tre (Youth) newspaper about whether he was worried about navigating the chaotic streets, Pitt smiled and said: There will be no problem.

 Pitt also said he and Jolie had a great time exploring the former US-backed wartime capital of south Vietnam, known then as Saigon. We had a wonderful day in Vietnam, the newspaper quoted Pitt as saying. Pitt and Jolie, who are also called Brangelina, arrived unannounced in Vietnam after an earlier visit to Cambodia.

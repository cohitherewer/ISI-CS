 Children die in quake areas

 Gilgit, Jan. 3 (Reuters): Up to 35 children have died of pneumonia in three mountain villages in Pakistani Kashmir since last week after heavy snowfalls in which temperatures plummeted as low as minus 30 degrees Celsius, a local official said today.

 Regional health director Hasan Khan Abacha said 28 children had died in the remote Gultari area, about 300 km northeast of Islamabad.

 Abacha said deaths occurred in three villages after temperatures dropped in heavy snow that cut all road links and prevented helicopter flights.

 Basketball star nets Longoria

 Longoria and Parker: A romantic proposal

 New York, Dec. 1 (AP): Desperate Housewives actress Eva Longoria is engaged to her beau, San Antonio Spurs star Tony Parker.

 Tony flew into Los Angeles last night after his game and surprised Eva at her home as she got off work, Longorias publicist Liza Anderson said yesterday via email.

 The proposal was romantic and perfect. The couple plans to wed in France in the summer of 2007 in what they describe as a big, happy ceremony with lots of family and friends.

 The 31-year-old Longoria, who plays crafty Gabrielle Solis on the hit ABC television series Desperate Housewives, and Parker, a 24-year-old French citizen, met in the Spurs locker room after a game in November 2004. They did not confirm their relationship until August 2005.

 The pair briefly split in September. At the time a representative for Longoria told the syndicated TV show Access Hollywood that the couple was going through a very difficult time right now just like any other couple with very demanding schedules.

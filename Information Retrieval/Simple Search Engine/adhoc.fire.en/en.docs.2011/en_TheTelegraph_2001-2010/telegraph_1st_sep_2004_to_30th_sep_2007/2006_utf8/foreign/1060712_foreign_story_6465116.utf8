 Jolie: Deadly voice

 Los Angeles, July 10 (Reuters): In her first movie deal since going to Africa to give birth, Angelina Jolie will co-star as a tiger in the upcoming kids film Kung Fu Panda for DreamWorks Animation SKG, the studio said yesterday.

 The Academy Award-winning actress will supply the voice of Tigress, a martial-arts master who helps train the title character, Po the Panda, played by Jack Black, in the ways of kung fu, DreamWorks said.

 The all-star cast of the computer-animated comedy, due to hit theatres in May 2008, also will feature the voice talents of Jackie Chan, Lucy Liu, Dustin Hoffman and Ian McShane.

 Jolie, 31, and Black last worked together voicing two of the lead characters, Lola and Lenny, in DreamWorks 2004 hit underwater adventure Shark Tale.

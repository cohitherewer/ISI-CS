 Gutsy granny

 Sydney, Feb. 27 (AFP): An Australian grandmother was honoured with a bravery award today for wrestling a giant saltwater crocodile as it dragged her friend from a tent.

 Alicia Sorohan, 61, was awakened early on the morning of October 11, 2004, by the screams of family friend Andrew Kerr in a nearby tent at their campsite on the northern Cape York peninsular.

 Seeing her friend in the jaws of a 4.2 metre, 300 kg crocodile, Sorohan did what anyone would do and jumped on its back.

 The man-eater then turned on her, breaking her nose and almost ripping her arm off before her son Jason shot it.

 It was pretty scary. But its one of those things ? if you see someone in trouble youve got to help them, Sorohan said. 

 Arm attack

 Johannesburg (Reuters): Pieter Abrahamse has an original excuse for a lost wedding ring: a crocodile ate it, along with the arm it was attached to. He took my wedding ring, I suppose he ate it up, Abrahamse said. The 47-year-old farm manager had the lower part of his left arm torn off in the attack last Thursday on a citrus plantation in South Africas northern Limpopo province. He was standing belly-deep in water about 5 metres from the shore when he felt a biting jolt in his left hip. He said thought it was a hippo but quickly realised it was a crocodile. 

 U2 award

 Santiago (Reuters): Irish rock band U2 received Amnesty Internationals annual Ambassadors of Conscience award on Sunday in Chiles national stadium, which was once a notorious detention center for political prisoners. Chilean President-elect Michelle Bachelet, herself a political prisoner in the 1970s, presented the award to U2 at a backstage ceremony prior to the band playing a concert.

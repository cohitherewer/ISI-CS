 Coup stops Cage film shooting

 Hong Kong, Sept. 21 (AP): Thailands military coup this week has interrupted filming of Nicolas Cages latest movie, a news report said today.

 The Chinese news website www.sina.com said Cage had prepared a private jet to leave the country on short notice. Cage is in Bangkok shooting the remake of the 1999 gangster thriller Bangkok Dangerous, directed by the Hong Kong-born twin brothers Danny and Oxide Pang, sina.com said. The Pang brothers are also directing the remake.

 When news of the coup on Tuesday night reached the crew, Cage was sent back to his hotel, but crew members remained on set to keep an eye on prop guns before Cage persuaded the producer to send everyone home.

 Kick twist to Zarqawi death

 Zarqawi

 London, June 11 (Agencies): A mortally wounded Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the head of al Qaida in Iraq, was allegedly beaten to death by US forces after the air strike on a safe house, eye-witnesses said.

 Native Iraqis who were on the scene when the air strike was launched, have been quoted as saying that Zarqawi, who was known as the Slaughtering Sheikh as he himself used to behead hostages, was alive when the US troops and Iraqi police drove up to the smouldering wreck of the safe house.

 Ali Abbas, a young farm labourer told The Sunday Times of London that he, along with some residents, rushed outside soon after a US aircraft dropped two bombs. We heard a moan coming from another part of the house (safe house), he was quoted as saying.

 Abbas and others reportedly found Zarqawi, who they did not recognise initially. There was life in him still. It took seven of us to move him from within the rubble and carry him out about 100 metres.

 Soon Iraqi and US forces turned up. They were shouting and screaming and in a very tense and agitated mood, Abbas said. The Americans tore his dishdasha (robe) and they kept on asking him through an interpreter, what is your name, what is your name? 

 He said the American forces probably feared that the militant was wearing a suicide belt.

 The soldiers, on finding that the suspect was not a threat, started to kick him in the chest. They kept kicking him, shouting, whats your name?, but the man only moaned and said nothing, Abbas said.

 The wounded man soon grew pale and blood oozed from his mouth and nose. It took about a quarter of an hour for him to die from the time when he was removed from the ambulance, the newspaper quoted Abbas as saying.

 However, the commander of the multinational forces in Iraq, General George Casey dismissed as baloney the allegation.

 I have not seen results of the autopsy. And the way I respond to the comments of the alleged Iraqi national to what went on there? Thats baloney, Casey told a television channel.

 Qaida threat

 Al Qaida today vowed to carry out large-scale attacks to shake the enemy after the killing of Zarqawi, heightening fears his death will bring no respite from carnage.

 The group, in an Internet statement, said its leading body met after Zarqawis death to discuss strategy and renew a pledge to al Qaida leader Osama bin Laden.

 We plan large-scale operations that will shake the enemy and rob them of sleep, in coordination with the other factions of the Mujahideen Council, said the statement.

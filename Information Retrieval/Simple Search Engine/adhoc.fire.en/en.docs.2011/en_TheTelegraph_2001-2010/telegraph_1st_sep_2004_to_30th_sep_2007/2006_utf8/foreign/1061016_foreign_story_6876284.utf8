 Dear Leaders drink safe, ban or no ban

 Seoul, Oct. 15 (AP): Hes known for swigging cognac and owning thousands of bottles of vintage French wine. His private train is reportedly stocked with live lobsters served with silver chopsticks. He allegedly flew in an Italian chef to make him pizzas.

 North Korean leader Kim Jong-il loves his fancy food. But will he have to start eating more kimchi (a local dish of fermented chilli pepper and vegetables) and less caviar if the UN sanctions affect the sale of luxury goods to North Korea?

 Some experts doubt the UN measure designed to punish the North for allegedly testing a nuclear device will force Kim to go on a diet. They say the Norths shadowy network of trading companies around the world will find ways to skirt the ban and deliver sushi and shark fin to Kim, whose paunch stands out as much as his frizzy bouffant hairdo.

 The North changes the names of the companies all the time. Its almost impossible to keep track of them, said Bertil Lintner, author of the book Great Leader, Dear Leader: Demystifying North Korea under the Kim clan.

 Kims foodie ways are legendary but largely unconfirmed. Most of the tales come from defectors, foreign officials, journalists and chefs who got a rare peek inside the reclusive leaders bizarre world.

 One of the most interesting accounts of Kims lavish lifestyle came from Konstantin Pulikovsky, a former Russian envoy who wrote a book, The Orient Express, about Kims train trip through Russia in July and August 2001.

 Pulikovsky said Kims 16-car private train was stocked with crates of French wine. Live lobsters were delivered in advance to stations, and gourmet feasts were eaten with silver chopsticks.

 While stopping in the Siberian city of Omsk, Kim sent back a plate of pickles because they were shoddily marinated cucumbers from Bulgaria, not prepared in the authentic Russian style, he wrote.

 Kenji Fujimoto, who worked as Kims personal sushi chef for more than a decade, said in Bradley K. Martins book Under the Loving Care of the Fatherly Leader that he was sent abroad on shopping missions to buy Czech beer, Thai papayas, caviar from Iran, Chinese melons, fish from Japan and Danish pork.

 Michael Breen, author of the biography, Kim Jong-Il: North Koreas Dear Leader, was also sceptical that the proposed UN ban on luxury goods would be effective. 

 He said the measure is designed to hit the nations leadership, who some believe have been unaffected by the countrys famine conditions. The super elite is impervious to whats happening, he said.

 About two million people are believed to have starved to death in North Korea in the 1990s because of bad harvests and decades of economic bungling. As Kim tucked into gourmet meals, his people survived by eating tree bark, weeds and roots.

 Breen said his favourite accounts about Kim include the Italian chefs who were recruited to make pizzas and train cooks in one of Kims palaces. Kim also reportedly eats specially grown rice grains that are hand sorted by women.

 Court clears email use against boss

 Kuala Lumpur, Dec. 9 (Reuters): A Malaysian labour tribunal has ruled that workers should be able to use office email to gossip about their bosses, and even use derogatory language, without fear of being sacked.

 The industrial court made the ruling in upholding a secretarys complaint that she had been wrongly dismissed for using office email to criticise her managers, newspapers said today. The courts view is that it is quite common and natural for staff to gossip about their superior officers, the Star quoted court chairman Syed Ahmad Radzi Syed Omar as saying.

 It can happen anywhere and anytime, especially when there is a gathering. It could be over coffee or tea; in this case, in e-mail between friends.

 London, Dec. 5 (Reuters): The iconic black dress worn by Audrey Hepburn in the 1961 film Breakfast at Tiffanys sold for 410,000 ($800,000) today, around seven times its pre-sale estimate.

 The sale room at London auctioneers Christies broke into applause at the end of a long and tense bidding session when it was bought by an anonymous telephone bidder.

 The dress, designed by Givenchy and worn by Hepburn in the memorable opening scene of the classic romantic comedy, was being auctioned on behalf of the City of Joy Aid charity which helps underprivileged children in India.

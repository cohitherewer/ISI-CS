 Fossett flies past record

 Manston (England), Feb. 11 (AP): Adventurer Steve Fossett completed the longest non-stop flight in aviation history today after flying around the globe and then some in roughly 80 hours.

 Fossett, 61, was forced to land his lightweight experimental plane, Virgin Atlantic Global Flyer, at Bournemouth International Airport, in southern England, instead of his planned landing point in nearby Kent, after encountering generator problems. 

 Ground control said he broke the distance record of 40,210 km, set in 1986, as he flew over Shannon, Ireland. Fossett flew 42,467.5 km in approximately 76 hours, his ground team said.

 That surpassed the 1986 record set by the lightweight voyager aircraft, piloted by Dick Rutan and Jeana Yeager. It also beats the balloon record of 40,812 km set in 1999 by the Breitling Orbiter 3. Over three days, the millionaire adventurer completed the 43,450-km journey despite losing about 340 kg of fuel during takeoff from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida because of a leak. Weak winds over the Atlantic and severe turbulence over India which, at one point, forced Fossett to strap on a parachute prompted fears Fossett would have to ditch his record-breaking attempt in Newfoundland.

 Instead, his flight team altered his projected route, having Fossett cross Florida, where he had begun his non-stop journey on Wednesday, and take a southerly path on the flights last leg to take advantage of better winds. Early today, Fossett decided to try to finish the trip after reaching the middle of the Atlantic.

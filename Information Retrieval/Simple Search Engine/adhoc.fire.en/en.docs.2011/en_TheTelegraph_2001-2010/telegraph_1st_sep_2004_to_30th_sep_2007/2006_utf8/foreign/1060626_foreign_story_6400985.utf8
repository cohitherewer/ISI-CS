 Saddam hopes for US knock

 New York, June 25 (Reuters): Saddam Hussein is certain his trial for crimes against humanity will result in the death penalty, but clings to the hope that Washington will use the sentence as leverage to enlist his aid to tamp down the insurgency in Iraq, the New York Times reported today.

 Saddams chief lawyer, Khalil al-Dulaimi, told the newspaper in Amman, Saddam knows the sentence has been issued from Washington, and if there is an even greater punishment than the death sentence, hell get it.

 But Saddam clings to hope, believing the way out is to become the USs last resort; theyll knock on his door, the lawyer said. The United States will use this sentence to pressure Saddam to save it from its mess.

 Saddam even believes the US might reinstall him as president of Iraq, al-Dulaimi told the daily.

 Deteriorating relations with Iran figure into Saddams reasoning, the lawyer added. The Iranian influence is a threat to American interests.... The only person standing in the face of Iran, which is the enemy of America, is Saddam Hussein, al-Dulaimi said.

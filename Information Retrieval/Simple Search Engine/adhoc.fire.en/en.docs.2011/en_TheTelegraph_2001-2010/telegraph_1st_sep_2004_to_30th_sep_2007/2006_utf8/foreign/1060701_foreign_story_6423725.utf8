 Smokers of lights less likely to give up

 New York, June 30 (Reuters): 

 The misconception that light cigarettes are 

 safer than regular brands may be preventing some smokers 

 from quitting altogether, a new study suggests.

 Researchers found that among more than 12,000 current and former smokers, more than a third said theyd switched to light cigarettes for health reasons. And these smokers were only half as likely to kick the habit as those who stuck with regular cigarettes.

 The findings, published online by the American Journal of Public Health, help validate the concern that many smokers may see light cigarettes as an alternative to quitting, said lead study author Dr Hilary A. Tindle of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine.

 Critics have long charged that cigarettes branded as light, ultralight, and low-tar dupe the public into thinking they carry fewer health risks, even though studies have shown light cigarettes to be as deadly as regulars.

 Light cigarettes are designated as such because they deliver less nicotine and lower levels of toxic chemicals when the smoke is measured by a machine.

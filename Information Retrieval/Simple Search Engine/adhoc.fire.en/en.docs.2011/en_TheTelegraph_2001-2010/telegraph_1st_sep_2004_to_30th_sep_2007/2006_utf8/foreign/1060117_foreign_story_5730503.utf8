 Australia to probe Iraq wheat exports

 Sydney, Jan. 16 (AP): The government opened an inquiry today into whether Australias monopoly wheat exporter made illegal payments to the Iraqi government of Saddam Hussein under the corruption-riddled UN oil-for-food programme.

 The inquiry was requested by the UN, which released a report in October last year showing AWB Ltd, formerly known as the Australian Wheat Board, to be the largest single supplier of humanitarian goods under the oil-for-food programme.

 According to the report, AWB sold 6.8 million tons of wheat to Iraq and received payments from the UN of more than $2.3 billion from 1997 to 2003.

 An UN independent commission, led by former US federal reserve chairman Paul Volcker, said that from 1999, AWB also had to arrange for the transport of wheat once it reached Iraq, which it did by paying Jordanian company Alia Transport.

 But Alia was partly owned by the Iraqi government and payments to Alia were tantamount to payments to Iraq, the report said. Paying the Saddam government for services was banned under the oil-for-food programme.

 The report said AWB made a total of $221.7 million in side payments for transportation of the wheat.

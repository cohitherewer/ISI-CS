 Seeking fairness, Harvard alters rules

 Boston, Sept. 12 (Reuters): Harvard University today said it would end its decades-old early admissions programme next year because the policy appeared to put low income and minority students at a disadvantage during the college entry process.

 We hope that doing away with early admission will improve the process and make it simpler and fairer, Derek Bok, Harvards interim president, said. Starting in 2008, the prestigious Ivy League school, which attracts thousands of applicants from the US and the world for roughly 1,655 spots in its freshman class, will have January 1 as a single application deadline for the class entering in autumn.

 By delaying the move to next year, Harvard, a longtime leader in educational trends and policies, expects other colleges which have similar programmes to follow suit.

 In the early admissions process, students who submit their applications in autumn are often told by December whether they are accepted. Most college applications are not due until January.

 Currently Harvard, the 370-year-old school ranked as Americas second best national university by US News and World Report magazine, accepts one third of its freshman class in December, months before most applicants are notified in April.

 Many other competitive schools have similar early admissions programmes including Harvards neighbour, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Princeton University, ranked the best university in the US; Columbia and Brown. 

 At most universities, but not Harvard, students accepted in December have to make firm commitments to attend at that time, giving them less chance to review aid packages from other schools that might accept them later, Harvard officials said. Early admissions programmes tend to advantage the advantaged, Bok said, describing how the schools 30-year-old policy favours certain applicants.

 Students needing financial aid are disadvantaged by binding early decision programmes that prevent them from comparing aid packages.

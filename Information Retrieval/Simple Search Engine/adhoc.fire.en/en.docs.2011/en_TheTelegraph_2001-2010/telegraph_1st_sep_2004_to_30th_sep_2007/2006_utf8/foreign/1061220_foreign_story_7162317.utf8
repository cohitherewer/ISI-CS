 Britney worst, Oprah best with dog

 Grrr... shes no friend

 New York, Dec. 19 (AP): When it comes to celebrity dog-parenting skills, Oprah Winfrey is tops and Britney Spears is the worlds worst, according to an online vote by readers of two dog magazines.

 Britney was the overwhelming choice for worst celebrity dog owner for 2006, Hilary Hagan, editor of The New York Dog and The Hollywood Dog magazines, said.

 She once had three Chihuahuas ... and never left home without at least one of them on her arm, Hagan said. As soon as she met K-Fed and had kids they (the dogs) disappeared. Spears has filed for divorce from aspiring rapper Kevin Federline. 

 The 25-year-old pop singer and Federline, 28, have a one-year-old son, Sean Preston, and a 3-month-old son, Jayden James. Paris Hilton, 2005s worst winner, placed second for treating her dogs like accessories, the magazines said. Winfrey, who owns five dogs, was voted this years best celebrity dog owner. 

 The talk-show host replaced 2005 winner Joss Stone, and beat off competition from Tori Spelling, Nicollette Sheridan and Beth Ostrosky, talk show host Howard Sterns girlfriend.

 Voting took place online over a three-month period. Results were not scientifically representative of the magazines readers, and the total number of votes wont be released, Hagan said yesterday.

 Bloated out of shape

 Britneys new girl-out-on-the-town lifestyle is doing her a fat lot of good. That is the verdict in Hollywood after a rather bloated Britney took a brief break from the cocktail circuit.

 But even watching a basketball game seemed too much for the 25-year-old; She looked puffy, weary and decidedly out of shape. 

 Non-stop drinking, smoking and late night snacking are thought to be to blame for padding out the svelte figure she worked so hard to retain after her second sons birth. 

 Her new career as a social butterfly began with the announcement that she was leaving Federline. She then linked up with heiress Paris Hilton and was pictured tottering in and out of nightclubs and parties in Los Angeles. In early December, her mother Lynne ordered her to stop drinking and return home to Louisiana. 

 But days later Spears attended a party in Malibu with her dress tied up in a knot.

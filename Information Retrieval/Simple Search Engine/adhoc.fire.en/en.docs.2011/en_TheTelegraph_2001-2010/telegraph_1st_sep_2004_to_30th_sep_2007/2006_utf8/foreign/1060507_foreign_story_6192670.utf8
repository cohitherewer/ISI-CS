 Material saddle

 New York, May 6 (AP): Madonna is back in the saddle again. 

 The Material Girl, who broke nine bones in a horse riding accident last year, stars with six Andalusian stallions in a 58-page photo spread in W magazines June issue.

 On the magazines cover, she wears equestrian-inspired 

garb, complete with a riding crop and fishnet stockings. Madonna, 47, suffered 

three cracked ribs, a broken collarbone and a broken hand after falling off a 

horse on August 16 last year. 

Thief trail

 Kampala, Uganda (Reuters): Ugandan police dogs on the trail 

of a thief sniffed out an unlikely suspect ? a born-again preacher ? who was promptly 

arrested for robbing a remote village shop, a state-owned newspaper reported on 

Saturday. Curious onlookers gathered as detectives released the dogs following 

a break-in at Igwaya village, in central Uganda. The shocked residents watched 

as the dogs raced to a nearby shop owned by Pastor Livingstone Isanga, head of 

the local Redeemed Christian Church. Hidden behind the counter were the stolen 

goods, New Vision newspaper said. 

 Hero hunt

 Pasadena, California (AP): The creator of Spider-Man and the Incredible Hulk is on the hunt for a new superhero, and he plans to find it on reality TV. Marvel Comics legend Stan Lee said on Friday that his new reality show Who Wants to be a Superhero? breaks new ground. Ive never lived in a world of reality, quipped the 83-year-old writer. Eleven wannabe superheros ? whittled down from 200 ? are set to compete in the show, which is scheduled to premiere on July 26. The winning superhero will be the star of a new comic book created by Lee.

 Pop prank

 New York (AP): A recent GQ article spoofing Michael 

Jackson has the singer demanding the magazine apologise and pull the issue from 

circulation. In a statement released on Friday, Jacksons representative, 

Raymone K. Bain, said Jackson is furious about a series of photos 

featuring a Jackson impersonator in the magazines May issue. The photos 

accompany an article called: Wheres Michael? which documents 

writer Devin Friedmans quest to find Jackson in Bahrain. In one photo, a 

Jackson look-alike sits in a darkened movie theatre amid a row of children. Another 

photo shows him standing in the desert draped in a black cloak and headscarf. 

The statement said: Mr Jackson is furious that his image has been used in 

such a misleading way.

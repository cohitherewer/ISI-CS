 Quake relief

 Klaten (Indonesia), June 1 (Reuters): Elderly Indonesian masseurs in the countrys earthquake devastated Java region have found themselves in high demand as traumatised survivors seek alternative treatment to soothe their pain.

 Two masseurs have been hired by a real estate company in Semarang, the provincial capital of central Java, to offer the free alternative treatment. Many survivors suffer from bruises and broken bones after being struck by debris as their homes crumbled. Suparjo, 61, has suffered from persistent headaches and had trouble walking since the magnitude 6.3 quake rattled Yogyakarta and Central Java provinces at dawn on Saturday. 

 You are suffering from stress, the masseur, 73-year-old Yoso Dumeri, told Suparjo. A lot of people here are suffering from stress and high blood pressure because of the quake.

 The masseurs apply pressure points on the nerves to restore the blood flow ? a procedure so painful it makes patients cry.

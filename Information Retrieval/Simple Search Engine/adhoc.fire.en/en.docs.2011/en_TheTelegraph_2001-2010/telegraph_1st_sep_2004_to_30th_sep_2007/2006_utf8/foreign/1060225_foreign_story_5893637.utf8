 How to spend ?50 m

 London, Feb. 24 (Reuters): Problem. How to get rid of ?50 million.

 Easy if the money is legitimate, but a major headache if it comes from what looks like being Britains biggest-ever cash robbery.

 Six raiders, posing as police officers, got away with the huge haul after they snatched the manager of a security depot on Tuesday evening, took his wife and young son hostage and threatened to kill them unless he co-operated.

 But rather than planning a life of luxury, said money laundering expert Peter Lilley, the gang had probably got away with more cash than they could possibly handle. He said they basically had three options: 

 Stash the money,

 Try to spend it, or 

 Launder it.

 None of these would be easy and in some cases impossible, so the gang might end up actually having to destroy it, Lilley said.

 I think they have stolen too much money, he said. If they had got five million, 10 million, 15, it would have been much easier than 50 million.

 Although day-to-day life can be conducted in cash, buying luxury items or property would be almost impossible. Stupid as it sounds, 50 million pounds of notes actually has no value whatsoever until you convert it to value, he said.

 If you want to go and buy a Ferrari ? if you come into the garage with more than 10,000 pounds in cash there are now certain money laundering rules that the garage has to follow regarding the source of the funds.

 Can you just go and blow 50 million pounds? The answer is no, Lilley said. One solution might be to get the money out of the country to places where laundering might be possible ? but much would depend on how professional the gang were.

 Criminals would be prepared to pay or lose 30 per cent of the cash to anyone who could help them out and there were organised gangs able to launder sums of around ?5 million at a time outside the UK through offshore companies, gold and property.

 Lilley suggested unscrupulous financial bodies or companies in Africa, former Soviet countries, West Asia or South America might also be prepared to take on the cash without asking questions.

 Police today released a computerised image of one of the suspects today as they quizzed three people already held as part of the inquiry. They have also found four vehicles used in the raid.

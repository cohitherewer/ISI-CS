 Storage future for Iraq prison

 Baghdad, March 10 (Reuters): Abu Ghraib prison, a symbol of terror for Iraqis under Saddam Hussein which later became notorious for the abuse of prisoners by US guards, is to be turned into a warehouse, Iraqs justice minister said today.

 The US military said yesterday it planned to end its operations at the prison. Some US officials suggested Iraqi authorities might continue to use it as a jail. But justice minister Abd al-Hussein Shandel said: There will be no detainees in Abu Ghraib. It will just be used as a storage facility for the justice ministry.

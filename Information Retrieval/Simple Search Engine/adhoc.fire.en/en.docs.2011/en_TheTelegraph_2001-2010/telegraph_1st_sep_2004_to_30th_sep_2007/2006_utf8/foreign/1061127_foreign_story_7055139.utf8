 Spys last allegation

 Litvinenko before his death

 London, Nov. 26: Former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko, who died last week from radiation poisoning, had named from his hospital bed a Kremlin agent as the man he believed responsible for targeting him, a media report today said. 

 Litvinenko, who died after mysteriously absorbing polonium-210, a rare and highly toxic radioactive material, told The Sunday Times in his last full interview from hospital that he knew he was an active case for Russian intelligence. 

 He named the agent in charge of monitoring him as Viktor Kirov. A man called Anatoly V. Kirov worked at the Russian embassy in London, where he was listed as a diplomat, until late last year. 

 He is believed to have left diplomatic service in October 2005 and returned to Russia. But Litvinenko claimed just days before he died that Kirov was an intelligence agent who continued to target him.

 Yesterday, anti-terrorist squad police requested that The Sunday Times hand over a tape of the interview in which Litvinenko named Kirov.

 Detectives will fly to Moscow and Rome this week in an attempt to unravel the mysterious radioactive poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko, The Sunday Telegraph reported today.

 Scotland Yards Counter Terrorism Command wants to question two Russians, Andrei Lugovoy and Dimitri Kovtun, and an Italian professor, Scaramella, who lunched with Litvinenko at the same Japanese restaurant in central London, just two weeks apart.

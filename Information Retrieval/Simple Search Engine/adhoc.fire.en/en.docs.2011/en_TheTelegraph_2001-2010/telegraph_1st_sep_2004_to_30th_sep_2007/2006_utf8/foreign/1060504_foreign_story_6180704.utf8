 New York, May 3 (Reuters): 

 A van Gogh portrait of a French cafe owner sold for more 

 than $40 million at the seasons first major Impressionist 

 and modern art sale yesterday.

 Led by the 1890 van Gogh work, LArlesienne, Madame Ginoux, which went for $40.3 million, Christies took in $180.2 million including commissions. It was the fourth-highest price obtained for a van Gogh painting at auction, Christies said.

 That was the auction houses highest total since May 1990, when a market driven largely by speculation at the hands of Japanese buyers gave way to the crash of the early 1990s.

 Sluggish economic conditions did not deter bidders from paying $34.7 million for Picassos 1932 work The Rest. The vibrant, large-scale depiction of the artists wife, Olga, was estimated to fetch $15 million to $20 million, but a bidding war erupted.

 Auctioneer Christopher Burge said 

 the sale reflected right across the board a solid, 

 strong market, without being a crazy market. The prices, 

 he added, were not in any way out of control.

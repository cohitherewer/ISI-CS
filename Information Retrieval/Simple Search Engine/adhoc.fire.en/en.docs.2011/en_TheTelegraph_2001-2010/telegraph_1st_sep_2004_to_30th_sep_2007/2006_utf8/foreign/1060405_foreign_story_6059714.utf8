 Wrestler slip fails

 Tehran, April 4 (Reuters): Iranian police have caught seven young men who were trying to emigrate to Hungary by masquerading as members of the national wrestling team, the official Iran newspaper reported yesterday.

 Airport police arrested the seven men after a tip-off from the Iranian Wrestling Federation that warned 15 imposters would attempt to slip out of Iran under the pretext of attending a Greco-Roman wrestling contest in Hungary. Getting visas to leave the Islamic Republic for EU countries is a very difficult process for most Iranians. Prosecutor Ataollah Roudgar said the men carried sports bags and wrestling suits but had not got their stories straight. 

 Amongst those arrested was a young man who weighed about 60 kg and claimed to be the 120 kg contender, Roudgar said. Wrestling is a highly prestigious sport with a long pedigree in Iran.

 Shakira sizzle not on show

 United Nations (AP): Latin pop star Shakira and Czech supermodel 

Karolina Kurkova received awards on Monday for their humanitarian work and then 

watched a fashion show featuring clothes partly made by women trying to escape 

poverty in developing countries. Lets not forget at the end of this 

day when we all go home, 960 children will have died in Latin America, Shakira 

said.

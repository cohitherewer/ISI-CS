 Pak, UK in joint terror fight

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Islamabad, Nov. 19: Pakistan and Britain today agreed to bolster strategic ties as partners in the ongoing global war against terrorism.

 The agreement was reached as visiting British Prime Minister Tony Blair met President Pervez Musharraf in Lahore and his Pakistani counterpart Shaukat Aziz in Islamabad.

 Blair arrived in Pakistan yesterday for the third round of bilateral summit consultations as agreed during Musharrafs visit to London in December 2004.

 The two countries also signed the development partnership agreement, which will double British assistance to Pakistan from 236 million to 480 million over the next three years.

 We should all work together to defeat terrorists, extremists and other obscurantist forces who are trying to Talibanise our societies and preventing people from making progress, Blair and Musharraf told a joint news conference in Lahore.

 The two leaders also pledged to work together with Afghanistan and other international partners to curb the violence through effective action against Taliban.

 They believed that a solution to the West Asia crisis would lead to progress in dealing with issues such as terrorism and extremism.

 Blair lent full support to Musharrafs concept of enlightened moderation for dealing with terrorism.

 We should empower moderate forces all over the world to win the battle against terrorism and militancy, he said, adding this approach will also ensure that those engaged in this war are not defeated.

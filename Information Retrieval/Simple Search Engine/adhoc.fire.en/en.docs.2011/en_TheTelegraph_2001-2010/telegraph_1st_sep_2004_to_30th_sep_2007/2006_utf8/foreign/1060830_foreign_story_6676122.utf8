 Cruises mission for movie cash possible 

 Cruise: Daring deal

 Los Angeles, Aug. 29 (Reuters): Turns out finding money to make movies was an easy mission for Tom Cruise.

 Only days after the Mission: Impossible movie star effectively was fired by Paramount Pictures, Cruise, his film partner Paula Wagner and an investment fund run by professional football team owner Daniel Snyder agreed yesterday to a financing package that puts Cruise back in business.

 This offers us the opportunity to work with all studios and continue doing what we were doing, but in more enhanced ways, Wagner said.

 First and Goal LLC, an investment fund run by Washington Redskins owner Snyder and partners Dwight Shar and Mark Shapiro, will cover overhead and development costs for Cruise/Wagner Productions for two years with an option to renew afterward.

 Financial details were undisclosed, and Wagner and others involved in the deal all declined to talk about financing. This is not a deal about money as much as it is about access and about our futures, Wagner said.

 Wagner said Snyder and his partners gave her and Cruise an entry into arenas where previously it had none, as well as the freedom to continue making both low-budget and big-budget movies outside Hollywoods major studio system.

 Shar is the chairman of US homebuilder NVR Inc., and Shapiro is the chief executive officer of Six Flags Inc. He was recruited to turn around the ailing theme park company by Snyder, Six Flags chairman.

 Last week, Sumner Redstone, chairman of Paramounts parent company Viacom Inc, said the studio would not renew Cruise/Wagners production deal when it expired this month. Redstone said Cruises recent conduct has not been acceptable. Wagner called Redstones comments undignified.

 The war of words marked a bitter end to one of the most lucrative production alliances between a major Hollywood studio and an A-list star. Cruises movies included many of the blockbusters of modern movie history, such as War of the Worlds, three Mission: Impossible films and Jerry Maguire.

 Last week, Wagner said her company had lined up $100 million to continue production, but she did not name names, leading many Hollywood watchers to wonder if indeed she really did have a partner waiting in the wings.

 Moss and le Fur stayed in the police station in western Paris about five minutes, then police blocked off the photographers so they could leave safely. No complaint was filed.

Lopezs husband, Marc Anthony. You will be surprised with this womans 

album, Estefano says. You will be surprised to see this singer. These

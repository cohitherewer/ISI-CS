 Gyanendra pays taxes for first time

 J. HEMANTH

 Common duty

 Kathmandu, Dec. 8: Nepals King Gyanendra and his errant son Paras have been forced to pay customs duty on imported, personal goods. 

 This is the first time any monarch in the Himalayan nation has paid any type of tax, a government spokesman said today. 

 The customs office at Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu charged (Nepal) Rs 53,739 as duty on 50 flashlights imported by the Narayanhitty Palace from the US. The package containing the goods arrived here in the name of King Gyanendra a few days ago. The office also charged (Nepal) Rs 77,193 in demurrage charges

 The customs office charged (Nepal) Rs 77,000 as duty on a hunting trophy from Austria that was imported by Crown Prince Paras. 

 This is the first time the palace has paid any tax to get its goods released from the customs, finance ministry spokesman Deep Basnet said. The king and his immediate family members were previously exempt from paying any taxes.

 Nepals monarchs have traditionally been revered as god, but King Gyanendras popularity dipped after he sacked the government early last year, saying the move was needed to quell an anti-monarchy Maoist insurgency which has killed more than 13,000 people since 1996.

 Street protests organised by Nepals main political parties and supported by the Maoists in April forced him to hand power back to the political parties.

 Last month, the government and Maoists signed a landmark peace deal declaring an end to the decade-old revolt. They have also agreed to hold elections next year for a special Assembly which would be tasked to map the countrys political future and decide the fate of its monarchy. 

 UN endorses pact

 The UN today formally endorsed the peace deal signed between the government and the Maoist rebels last month paving the way for management of arms and armies of the two sides.

 UN secretary-generals special representative to Nepal Ian Martin signed the agreement on arms and management of armies which was finalised by the government and the rebels earlier this week.

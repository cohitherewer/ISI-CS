 EU ponders mercury ban

 Brussels, Feb. 21 (Reuters): The EU may soon ban new thermometers that contain mercury, hoping to minimise the risk that the toxic heavy metal poses to humans, ecosystems and wildlife, the EU executive said today.

 The commission, which administers and instigates laws for the 25-country EU, wants to ban the marketing of mercury in new fever and room thermometers, barometers and blood pressure gauges due to its serious threat to health.

 Direct exposure from a broken thermometer is dangerous, causing damage to the lungs, kidneys and brain when inhaled. The proposed ban will now be debated by EU ministers.

 Hayatullah Khan: Tragic

 Islamabad, June 17: A day after local tribesmen found the dead body of a missing Pakistani journalist in the volatile North Waziristan region, the Islamabad press corps today decided to observe a black day on Monday to protest against the dastardly killing.

 Hayatullah Khan, who had disappeared last December, was found dead with bullet wounds in his back near his ancestral town of Mir Ali, North Waziristan, yesterday afternoon afternoon.

 In the National Assembly, journalists boycotted the proceedings and held a demonstration outside the House.

 Wearing black bands, they demanded a judicial probe into Khans killing and asked the ruling Pakistan Muslim League to send a fact-finding mission, comprising journalists, members of parliament and government officials, to North Waziristan.

 Assuring the protesting journalists of full cooperation, interior minister Aftab Ahmad Khan Sherpao said the government would investigate the incident as thoroughly as possible.

 Leading Opposition Assembly members, mostly from former the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and the Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal (MMA), also joined the demonstration.

 Sherry Rehman, a vocal MP of the PPP, questioned the governments capability in providing protection to journalists. What kind of freedom of press and democracy is this, she said while condemning Hayatullahs murder.

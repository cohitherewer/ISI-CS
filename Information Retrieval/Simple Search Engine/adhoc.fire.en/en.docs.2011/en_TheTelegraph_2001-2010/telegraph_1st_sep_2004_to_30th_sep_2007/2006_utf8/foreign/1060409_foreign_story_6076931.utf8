 Melanie Griffith and Antonio Banderas: Dressing down

 Los Angeles, April 8 (AP): A costume designer is suing Melanie Griffith for allegedly refusing to pay nearly $26,000 for dressing the actor and her daughters for this years Golden Globes awards and reneging on a promise to mention his name on the red carpet.

 In the suit filed yesterday in a Los Angeles court Niklas J. Palm claimed he designed dresses for Griffith and her daughters Dakota Johnson and Stella Banderas to wear to the January event.

 He said he submitted a $25,960 bill on January 16 and Griffith was overdue in making any payments.

 Palm also claimed that Griffith and her daughters backed out of their promise to mention his name to reporters.

 Griffith promised that he will receive publicity that money could not buy, then conveniently forget his name when reporters on the red carpet specifically asked (her) who designed her beautiful gown ? taking credit for the gown herself, the lawsuit said.

 Calls made after business hours yesterday to Griffiths attorney and publicist were not immediately returned.

 The lawsuit claimed breach of oral and written contract and intentional misrepresentation. It also names Griffiths husband, Antonio Banderas and their production companies as defendants.

 Palm was part of a costume design team that won a 2004 Emmy Award for their work on the HBO series Carnivale.

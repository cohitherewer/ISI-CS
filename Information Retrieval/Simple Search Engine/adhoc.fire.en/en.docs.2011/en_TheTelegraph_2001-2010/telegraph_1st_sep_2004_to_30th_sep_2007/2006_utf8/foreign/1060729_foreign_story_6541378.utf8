 Indians entertain on gala night

 Kuala Lumpur, July 28: (AP): Indian diplomats performed a Bollywood skit that took a dig at North Korea and Pakistans rogue nuclear scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan at the annual gala dinner of the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean) yesterday.

 At a night of song and dance performed by the diplomats themselves, the Indians went all out to entertain. 

 Oh, if only the world was Bollywood ... We could all dance and happily prance and declare the world as jolly good, the lyrics for the Indian delegation went.

 Then in a reference to the Pakistani rogue scientist, Abdul Qadeer Khan, they sang: Then we add some handsome heroes, some villains and some nuclear Neros... A Mr Khan, a Dr No, a Mr Kim and a John Doe. At the mention of Khan, US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice fell back in her seat in mock astonishment. 

 Rice, in a sombre mood after a diplomatic visit to West Asia, played a Brahms sonata on the piano.

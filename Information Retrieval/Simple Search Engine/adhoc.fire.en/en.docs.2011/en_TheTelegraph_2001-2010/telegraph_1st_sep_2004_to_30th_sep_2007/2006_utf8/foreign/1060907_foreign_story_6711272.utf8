 Beirut, Sept. 6 (Reuters): Israel said today it would lift an eight-week-old air and sea blockade of Lebanon at 1500 GMT on Thursday, handing over control to international forces.

 It said Prime Minister Ehud Olmert had been told by US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice and UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan that international forces are ready to take over control posts over the sea ports and airports of Lebanon.

 Thus it was agreed that tomorrow at 6 pm (1500 GMT), Israel will leave the control positions over the ports in conjunction with the entry of the international forces, a statement from Olmerts office said.

 Israel imposed the embargo, bombing Beirut airport and denying ships access to Lebanese ports, one day after Hizbollah guerrillas captured two of its soldiers on July 12 and sparked a war that was halted by a UN truce nearly five weeks later.

 Annan had said earlier at a joint news conference with Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara he was hopeful the blockade would be lifted within 36-48 hours.

 Lebanon had vowed to bust the blockade if it was not lifted by Friday.

 Annan, speaking after talks on Turkeys contribution to a bigger UN peacekeeping force to shore up the truce, has been trying to broker a deal to end the blockade.

 In a sign the end of the embargo was imminent, British Airways said it was resuming direct flights to Beirut after the British government had given assurances it would be safe to do so.

 Lebanons Middle East Airlines and Royal Jordanian began flying regularly into the capital last month, but have complied with Israels insistence all such flights go via Amman. Qatar Airways resumed direct flights to Beirut on Monday.

 Lebanese Prime Minister Fouad Siniora has said if the blockade went on for another 20 days, the economic losses would equal the nearly $1 billion in aid promised by international donors to help Lebanon get back to its feet.

 Lebanons foreign minister Fawzi Salloukh said on Wednesday the two Israeli soldiers held by the Lebanese Hizbollah guerrilla group would not be released unless there were talks with Israel about the exchange of Lebanese prisoners.

 Annan has said Israel should complete its pullout once 5,000 UN troops were on the ground. The force now numbers 3,100.

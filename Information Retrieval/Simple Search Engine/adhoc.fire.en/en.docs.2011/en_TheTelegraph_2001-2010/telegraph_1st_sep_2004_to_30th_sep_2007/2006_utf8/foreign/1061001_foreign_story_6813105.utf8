 Paris, Sept. 29 (Reuters): A French teacher hiding from Islamist death threats today said he had been abandoned by the education ministry and had to arrange his own safe houses when police bodyguards moved him every two days.

 Robert Redeker went underground after publishing a virulent attack on Islam on September 19 and he criticised education minister Gilles de Robien for saying he should have been prudent in the way he expressed himself.

 Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin said the threats against Redeker, who teaches philosophy in a suburban Toulouse high school, were intolerable and showed that we live in a dangerous world that is often marked by intolerance.

 The threats came amid widespread criticism of Pope Benedict by Muslims who accused him of implying in a speech that Islam was violent. They coincided with the cancellation of a Mozart opera in Berlin out of fear of backlash.

 In his article, Redeker called the Quran a book of incredible violence and the Prophet Mohammad a merciless warlord, a looter, a butcher of Jews and a polygamist. Islam, he said, exalts violence and hate.

 Speaking from an undisclosed location, Redeker, 52, said he felt alone and abandoned. The education ministry has not deigned to contact me to ask if I need any help.

 He said asking critical questions was his job as a philosophy teacher. If Mr de Robien were right, he said, there would never have been any intellectual life in France.

 Indian English challenge hurts Britain

 David Graddol: Tongue-tied

 London, Feb. 21 (Reuters): The dominance of English as the worlds top language ? until recently an advantage to both Britain and the US ? is now beginning to undermine the competitiveness of both nations, according to a major research report. 

 The report commissioned by the British Council says monolingual English graduates face a bleak economic future as multilingual competitors flood into the workforce from all corners of the globe. 

 A massive increase in the number of people learning English is under way and likely to peak at around 2 billion in the next decade, according to the report entitled English Next.

 More than half of all primary school children in China now learn English and the number of English speakers in India and China ? 500 million ? now exceeds the total number of mother-tongue English speakers elsewhere in the world.

 These new polyglots, and the companies that employ them, have significant competitive advantages over their monoglot rivals, including a vital understanding of different cultures, in a world faced with rapid globalisation.

 The competitive advantage of speaking English is ebbing away, said the author of the report, linguistic consultant David Graddol. Once everyone speaks English, advantage can only be maintained by having something else ? other skills, such as speaking several languages.

 At a corporate level, the UK and US economies have been enjoying a huge benefit from having so many English speakers elsewhere in the world, he said today.

 They can outsource overseas to India, for example, allowing them to cut costs and boost growth. 

 But Graddol said there were mounting disadvantages for US and British companies if they stayed monolingual.

 Companies from other countries could use exactly the same methods to cut costs. And those foreign competitors could also trade and take orders in other languages. We know from trade associations that small and medium-sized British firms are losing a lot of business because they cant even answer calls from abroad on the switchboard, he said.

 Calls dont get to the right people because the telephone operators dont have the languages needed.

 Around 30 per cent of the British population speaks a language other than English, but about half of these people have that other language as a mother tongue, Graddol said.

 In the US, 22 per cent of the population speaks a language other than English, mainly Spanish, and many of these people have Spanish as their first language, figures from the US Modern Language Association show.

 The number of foreign, particularly Chinese, students entering UK universities was falling as colleges in other parts of the world offered courses in English at lower cost, he said.

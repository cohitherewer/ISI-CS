 From pauper to prince

 MATT WRIGLEY 

 Moscow, July 9: With his degree in tractor driving, childhood on a collective farm and proud record as a communist youth leader, Sergei Kotov appears to be the archetypal child of Soviet Russia. In the land where all were equal, however, he had one thing that always made him stand out ? a black skin. 

 Abandoned as a child, the Afro-Russian grew up in an orphanage near Moscow, where he long wondered about his parents who had left him behind. 

 Now, almost four decades later, a reunion with his long-lost father has turned him from one-time pauper to prince. Following an appeal broadcast on a Russian television programme, Kotov discovered that he was the son of a doctor descended from Ghanaian royalty, making him the future monarch of a tribal kingdom in the West African state. 

 His remarkable story began after his Russian mother, Nina Kotova, fell in love with Phanuel Dartey, a medical student who had been invited to study in Kalinin (Tver) in the 1960s as the Soviet Union wooed Ghanas newly-independent government. Despite the communist regimes supposed egalitarianism, mixed-race relationships were deeply frowned upon, and Nina broke off the romance after two years. 

 Her lover left the country unaware that she was pregnant, and soon after she succumbed to pressure from relatives, and the local party, to put the baby in care. Whatever people used to say back then about friendship and equality between nations, there was a massive gap between the rhetoric and the reality. It was considered a disgrace to be seen with an African, said Kotov. 

 I was one of the first Afro-Russian children. There were constant insults from adults and other children. 

 After serving two years in the Red Army, Sergei became a local leader of the Communist Partys youth wing, the Komsomol. I had read all 55 volumes of Lenins works by the time I was 15, he said. 

 All these years he was concentrating on overcoming race discrimination to become a professor. The secret remained buried for 32 years until an acquaintance of his mothers revealed the family history.

 Shroud of Suri stays in place

 Holmes, Cruise: Super secrecy

 New York, July 12 (AP): Almost three months after the birth of Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes daughter, the Shroud of Suri has yet to be lifted.

 Suri Cruise has yet to be seen in public, either in person or photographically, since entering the world April 18. To some, this is a holdout of staggering proportions.

 Us Weekly magazine is running a clock, ticking off the days (84 and counting) since Suris birth. German TV station RTL, taking matters into its own hands, has produced a composite image of what Suri might look like. TMZ.com, perhaps digging for evidence of Suris existence, obtained a copy of the official birth certificate, filed May 8 in Los Angeles. 

 And gossip website Defamer.com has called the delay profoundly strange and upgraded its suspicion from mystery to riddle that would make the Sphinx incontinent.

 The secrecy is in stark contrast to the couples radically public courtship. Cruise, 44, and Holmes, 27, spared no photo-op during their whirlwind romance. They are now engaged, though there has been no word on wedding plans.

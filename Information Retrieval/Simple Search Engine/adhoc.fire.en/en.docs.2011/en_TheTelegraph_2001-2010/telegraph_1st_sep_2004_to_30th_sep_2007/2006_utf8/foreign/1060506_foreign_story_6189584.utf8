 Virgin care

 Berlin, May 5 (Reuters): A brothel has become the first in Berlin to offer special deals for virgins with prostitutes trained in the delicate art of catering for customers who have never had sex, a German newspaper reported today.

 These are men who either never had sex before or have never been in a brothel before, the brothels operator was quoted as saying in Berlins B.Z. tabloid. 

 Its the first house of love in Berlin that specialises in taking care of beginners, wrote the daily on its front page.

 Stop spit

 Beijing (Reuters): Some Chinese 

 tourists have been warned that while spitting, slurping 

 food and jumping queues may merely disgust people at home, 

 they are sometimes not tolerated abroad, Xinhua said. The 

 media in Singapore reports that hotel staff are upset with 

 Chinese tourists spitting in their rooms and smoking in 

 bed, it said.

 Winning slip

 Sydney, April 9 (AFP): An Australian grandmother who made a mistake filling out her usual lottery entry on a new form has won more than two million Australian dollars as a result.

 The 79-year-old bought her usual $2.30 ticket which allowed her four lines of numbers but accidentally duplicated one of the lines, which happened to be the winner, the New South Wales Lotto organisers said. This gave her a total of $2,333,333, while 17 other winners of the $21-million pool had to settle for just $1,166,666. 

 Finance toll 

 Washington (Reuters): If a high-fat cholesterol-laden snack 

doesnt trigger a heart attack, then a healthy economy just might. The risk 

of a fatal heart attack rises when the US economy strengthens and increases further 

if macroeconomic conditions remain robust over the next several years, a study 

said. The death rate rises in the year the economy expands and grows further if 

the lower rate of joblessness is maintained. A 1 percentage point drop in unemployment 

is estimated to raise mortality by 1.3 per cent or 2,515 additional deaths a year 

from heart attacks, it added. 

 Kiss ban 

 Jakarta (Reuters): Unrelated people who kiss each other on the lips for more than five minutes at public places in the Indonesian city of Tangerang will face arrest, local media said. The government defended the regulation as a practical guideline for its officers to follow up on its tough and heavily criticised anti-prostitution laws.

 Safe landing for shuttle

 - Columbia horror erased

 Cape Canaveral (Florida), July 17 (Reuters): US space shuttle Discovery landed smoothly in Florida today at the end of a 13-day mission meant to show the fleet is fit to fly safely, three years after the fatal Columbia accident.

 Double sonic booms thundered over central Florida as the shuttle glided through partly cloudy skies heading toward a 5 km-long runway at the Kennedy Space Center.

 Commander Steve Lindsey gently steered the shuttle through a series of turns to burn off speed before the winged spacecraft set down at 1314 GMT. Welcome back Discovery. Congratulations on a great mission, said astronaut Steve Frick from Nasas Mission Control at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. Thanks. It was a great mission, said Lindsey.

 Discoverys flight was the first in a year and only the second since the 2003 Columbia disaster. The agency has spent more than $1.3 billion on safety upgrades since the accident, which killed seven astronauts and brought construction of the $100 billion International Space Station to a halt.

 The agencys chief concern has been to fix foam insulation on the shuttles external fuel tank, which triggered Columbias demise. The doomed spacecraft was hit by a piece of falling foam during launch, opening a hole that let in super hot atmospheric gases during re-entry 16 days later.

 Nasa had hoped to resume space 

 station construction last year, but Discoverys 

 tank shed large pieces of foam during its July 2005 liftoff, 

 forcing the grounding of the fleet while space agency experts 

 worked on the problem. When the shuttle was launched again 

 on July 4, its tank lost only small pieces of foam, none 

 a threat to the spaceship or its crew

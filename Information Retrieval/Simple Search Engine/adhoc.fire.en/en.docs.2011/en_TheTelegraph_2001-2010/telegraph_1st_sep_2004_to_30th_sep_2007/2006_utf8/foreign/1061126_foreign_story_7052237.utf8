 Feline voyage

 London, Nov. 25 (AP): Emerging with a shock of white fur, a cat stunned cargo workers in England as it jumped out of a goods container after a 17-day sea voyage from Israel to Britain, a journey of more than

 3,200 km, an animal charity said yesterday.

 Animal rescue officials said the stowaway was starving and dehydrated when workers at a warehouse in Whitworth, northwestern England, discovered the unexpected cargo last Friday.

 Staff said the cat named Ziggy because it had eyes of different colours, one green and one blue, like singer David Bowie and his alter-ego Ziggy Stardust fled from staff when the container was opened, hiding for over five hours.

 I think he was scared to death. Hed travelled all that way and got to a strange country, and ran for his life, said James Ratcliff, an officer with the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. 

 Fur flies

 Beijing (Reuters): A $7,500 

 fur coat donated by pop diva Mariah Carey and intended for 

 Mongolias poor has disappeared, a leading animal rights 

 group said on Thursday. Carey donated the fur coat to People 

 for the Ethical Treatment of Animals which said it had since 

 been lost on its way to Mongolia, where it was to be given 

 to nomads to help them keep warm in the winter. After 

 (Carey) received two floor-length minks from a rich admirer, 

 she resealed the box and sent them to PETA, a spokesman 

 said. One coat was on its way ... to Switzerland 

 where it was to be included in a sealed container bound 

 for Mongolia, he added. But the coat never arrived. 

 Hack bite

 Albuquerque, New Mexico (AP): 

 A woman is accused of using a computer at a national laboratory 

 to hack into a cellphone companys website to get a 

 number for Chester Bennington, lead singer of the Grammy-winning 

 rock group Linkin Park. According to an affidavit filed 

 by the department of defence inspector general, Devon Townsend, 

 27, obtained copies of Benningtons cellphone bill, 

 the phone numbers he called and digital pictures taken with 

 the phone. Investigators said she also hacked into the email 

 of Benningtons wife, Talinda, and at one point called 

 her and threatened her.

 Swing time

 Singapore (Reuters): Every 

 two months, dozens of couples meet in a pub in Singapore, 

 have drinks, mingle, and then decide whether they want to 

 sleep with one another. In Sydney or Seattle nobody would 

 bat an eyelid, but the couples are part of a thriving underground 

 swinging scene that is an anomaly for a country where oral 

 sex is illegal and Playboy magazine is banned. There 

 are more than 10 swingers clubs in Singapore, most of them 

 private, some of them online. With more than 6,000 members, 

 the Web-based United SG Swingers is one of the biggest. 

 There are a lot more people that are open to the idea. 

 , said a 42-year-old com pany executive.

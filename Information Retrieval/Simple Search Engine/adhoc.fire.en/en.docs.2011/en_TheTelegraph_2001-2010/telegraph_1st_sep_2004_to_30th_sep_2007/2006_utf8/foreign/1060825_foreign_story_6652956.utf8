 China activist jailed

 Chen: No leniency

 Beijing, Aug. 24 (Reuters): 

 A Chinese court jailed a blind human rights activist for 

 four years and three months today, state media announced, 

 prompting other campaigners to warn of a clampdown on Chinas 

 rights defenders.

 Chen Guangcheng, who was tried last Friday without his own lawyers present, drew international attention last year after accusing officials in east Chinas Shandong province of enforcing late-term abortions in a population control drive.

 Chen, 34, was accused of damaging property and disrupting traffic after a protest erupted in his home Dongshigu village in February against his months-long house arrest, but his family and lawyers say the charges were trumped up.

 The verdict from Yinan County Court in Shandong came as a shock to Chens wife, Yuan Weijing, who had not been notified by the court.

 I thought they were going to sentence him even though hes innocent, but I never expected such a heavy sentence, she said. 

 Even if he was guilty, the damage they said happened was small and the law says blind people should be give leniency.

 The brief announcement of the verdict by the official Xinhua news agency did not say whether Chen had appealed or if he could expect clemency because of his disability.

 Chinese activists said the unexpectedly heavy sentence indicated officials are clamping down on rights defenders a growing network of lawyers, academics and dissidents seeking to expand citizens freedoms through litigation and Internet-driven campaigns for legal reform.

 Chen had educated himself in the law and campaigned for farmers and blind citizens rights.

 Kathmandu, May 12: The Girija Prasad Koirala government today arrested the leading lights of the former royalist government for their alleged role in the crackdown on the pro-democracy movement.

 State radio said the police arrested former home minister Kamal Thapa, former foreign minister Rameshnath Pandey and former state minister for communications Shirish Shumshere Rana.

 Tanka Dhakal and Niksha Shumsher Rana, two other ministers in the kings cabinet, were also detained

 According to unconfirmed reports, the government also issued orders to suspend the four security chiefs, including the Royal Nepalese Army chief General Pyar Jung Thapa. 

 The other chiefs who were suspended were inspector-general of police Shyam Bhakta Thapa, inspector-general of armed police force Sahabir Thapa and chief of the National Investigation Department Devi Ram Sharma.

 The suspension orders were issued on the recommendations of the Rayamahji commission which is probing the police excesses on the pro-democracy protesters. The commission said that the four chiefs should be suspended as they may influence the probe.

 Acting on a home ministry directive, the three former ministers have been detained on the basis of a 30-day arrest warrant. 

 They have been charged with making statements aimed at disturbing the public peace. The former ministers have been sent to the National Police Academy at Maharajgunj. .

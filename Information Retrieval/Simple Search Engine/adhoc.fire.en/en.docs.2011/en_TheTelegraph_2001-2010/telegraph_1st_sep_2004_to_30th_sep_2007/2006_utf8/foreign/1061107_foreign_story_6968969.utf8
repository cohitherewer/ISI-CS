 Deal on Nepal Maoist weapons

 J. HEMANTH

 Koirala: Taming rebels

 Kathmandu, Nov. 6: 

 The Nepal government and the Maoists reached a landmark 

 agreement today which would eventually result in the rebels 

 locking up their weapons under the UNs custody.

 The Maoists have been waging the so-called peoples war for a republic for more than a decade. 

 The agreement was reached at a meeting held at Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koiralas official residence this evening. Thirty leaders from both sides, including Koirala, Nepal communist party general secretary Madhav Kumar Nepal, Maoist chief Prachanda and his number two Baburam Bhattarai, attended the meeting.

 Prior to the formal meeting, the two sides held informal discussions to give finishing touches to the deal, which may formally be announced tomorrow. 

 According to the deal, the Maoists would lock up the weapons of their 30,000-strong rebel army in temporary cantonments, where all the fighters would also be accommodated. The armouries in such cantonments or camps would be secured with special locks equipped with electronic sensors. 

 The UN team handling the peace process would monitor these armouries through closed-circuit cameras while the keys would be in the custody of the Maoist leadership. 

 Under the deal, a similar number of weapons belonging to the Nepal Army would also be locked up. 

 The two sides also agreed to retain the current form of monarchy till the constituent assembly elections slated for June 2007. 

 Consequent to the deal, the Maoists are likely to join the interim government once the arms are deposited in the specially built cantonments.

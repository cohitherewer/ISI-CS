 Cruising to the knot

 Los Angeles, Feb. 15 (Reuters): Hollywood lovebirds Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes remain engaged to be married and are proceeding with wedding plans, his publicist said yesterday, denying a Valentines Day report to the contrary.

 It should be known that the story (of a breakup) is 100 per cent false, spokesman Paul Bloch said in a statement sent to news agencies in response to the report, from celebrity magazine Life amp; Style. It reported yesterday that Cruise and Holmes had agreed to call off their engagement but maintain the charade of a romance until after the birth of their baby. In the meantime, the magazine said, the two stars planned to live in Cruises Beverly Hills home, though sleep in separate bedrooms.

 Blind about long date

 Mashantucket, Connecticut (AP): A man 

 and woman spent just over 30 hours together in an attempt 

 to set a world record for the longest blind date. Tara Fortunato, 

 23, and Keith Santarelli, 28, spent Monday and part of Valentines 

 Day together trying to make the Guinness Book of World 

 Records. There is no existing record for longest blind 

 date. The pair began the blind date at 6.45 am on Monday 

 in Fortunatos hometown of Medford and ended the date 

 at Foxwoods at 1.03 pm.

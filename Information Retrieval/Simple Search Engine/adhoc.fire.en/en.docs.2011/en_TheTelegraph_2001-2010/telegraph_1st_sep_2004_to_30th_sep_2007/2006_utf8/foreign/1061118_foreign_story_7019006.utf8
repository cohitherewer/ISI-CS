 France Royal

 Paris, Nov. 17 (Reuters): Segolene Royal won backing from her Socialist Party to become Frances first woman President in next years election, promising change to many voters tired of a generation of male leaders from the same elitist mould.

 Party officials said Royal won 60.62 per cent of the vote in a Socialist primary ballot a result likely to silence many Leftist critics who had portrayed her as a lightweight populist and inexperienced campaigner.

 The fact that I have been chosen in this way is something extraordinary, said Royal, smiling radiantly and visibly moved. 

 I want to embody change and give it credibility and legitimacy. And I think today, I have received this legitimacy, she told reporters in her western France stronghold, where she is president of the Poitou-Charentes region.

 The victory banished fears in her camp of a damaging second round run-off vote and gave her the endorsement she had been seeking to take on the Rights likely candidate, interior minister Nicolas Sarkozy in 2007. Clear, definite and unmistakable. Segolene Royals victory cannot be contested, wrote the conservative daily Le Figaro.

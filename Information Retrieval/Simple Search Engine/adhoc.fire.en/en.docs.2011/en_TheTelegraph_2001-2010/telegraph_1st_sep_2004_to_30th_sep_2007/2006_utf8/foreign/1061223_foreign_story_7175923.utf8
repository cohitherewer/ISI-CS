 4 charged for Iraq massacre

 Wuterich: Marine rage

 Camp Pendelton (California), Dec. 21 (Reuters): The US military yesterday charged four Marines with murder and four others with dereliction of duty in the 2005 killing of 24 unarmed civilians in Haditha, Iraq, scene of what Iraqi witnesses say was a massacre by American troops.

 The charges cap a military investigation into the deaths of the two dozen men, women and children on November 19, 2005, which along with the widely publicised abuses of Iraqi prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison, have damaged US prestige and led to international condemnation.

 Iraqi witnesses say enraged Marines shot the civilians in their homes to retaliate for the death of a popular comrade, Corporal Miguel Terrazas, who was ripped in half by a bomb that exploded under a convoy in Haditha, 96 km north of Baghdad.

 Marine Corps squad leader Sergeant Frank Wuterich, 26, who led the squad investigated in connection with the incident, was charged with the unpremeditated murder, soliciting another to commit and offence and making a false official statement.

 The charges against Wuterich cover the deaths of 12 individual victims and the deaths of six people in a single house. Others charged with murder are Sergeant Sanick Dela Cruz, 24, Corporal Justin Sharratt, 22, and Corporal Stephen Tatum, 25. The remaining Marines are charged with dereliction of duty.

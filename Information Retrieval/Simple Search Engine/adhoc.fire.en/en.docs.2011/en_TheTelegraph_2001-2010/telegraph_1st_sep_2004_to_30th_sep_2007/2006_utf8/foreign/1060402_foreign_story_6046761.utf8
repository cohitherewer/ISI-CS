 Cambridge sinks Oxford French coup

 London, April 1: In a piece of oneupmanship, Cambridge University yesterday trumped Oxfords claim to have the first ever Frenchman rowing in the Boat Race this weekend.

 Not only do the Light Blues say that they beat their Oxbridge rivals by more than 150 years, but they claim that their Frenchman went on to become Prime Minister of France. It is a pity, perhaps, that his name, William Henry Waddington, hardly reeks of all things Gallic.

 Oxford had announced, amid some fanfare, that Toulouse-born Bastien Ripoll, who is studying for an MSc in water science, policy and management, would be among the eight competing in tomorrows contest.

 But Cambridge dug up their own Frenchman who, long before Ripoll, won a blue after competing in the annual varsity race in 1849. Waddington, a 19th Century graduate of Trinity College, Cambridge, was born in France to a French mother and a wealthy, English-born but naturalised French father.

 Yesterday, the race organisers admitted that, in the face of Cambridges claims, Oxfords boast to have the first French rower had become a grey if not a light blue area. 

 However, they insisted that Waddington had registered his nationality as British on his race entry documents.

 Dr Robert Tombs, a reader in French history from St Johns College, Cambridge, said Waddingtons French credentials were genuine, though he accepted that he might have had dual nationality.

 He was definitely French, said Dr Tombs. He was born in Normandy and being born in France at the time would have made him legally French.

 He went on to become a member of the French parliament and [in 1879] the Prime Minister. He would have had to have been a French citizen to be allowed to do that.

 It wasnt usual for French families to send their children to England for their education, so its likely he was sent here because of his familys heritage.

 Waddington, who was born in 1826 and died in 1894, became the French ambassador in London but Bryn Vaile, a spokesman for the race organisers, was unconvinced.

 It can be argued either way he said. In those days, no one had passports and no one has been able to find a birth certificate. He was born to an English father and a French mother but went to Rugby School. If you go to Rugby you would be regarded as English.

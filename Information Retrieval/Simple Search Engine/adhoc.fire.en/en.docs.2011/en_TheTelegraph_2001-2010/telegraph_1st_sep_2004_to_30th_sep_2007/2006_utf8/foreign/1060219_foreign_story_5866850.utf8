 Multan, Feb. 18 (Reuters): Pakistan banned demonstrations in Islamabad today as protests over cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad grew and four people were wounded when shots were fired during a rally in a central town.

 Information minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed said the ban would apply to a protest planned tomorrow by Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal (MMA), the countrys main Islamist alliance.

 MMA leaders have been told that protests and rallies will not be allowed in Islamabad, he said. But the MMA said its protest would go ahead. The rally will be held in Islamabad. It will be a peaceful rally, Shahid Shamsi, an MMA spokesman said.

 Five people have been killed in Pakistan this week during violent demonstrations against satirical cartoons lampooning the Prophet that have enraged Muslims across the world. First published in Denmark, the drawings have been reprinted by newspapers in European countries and elsewhere.

 Four people were wounded today when shots were fired during a protest over the cartoons in the town of Chiniot in central province of Punjab, police said.

 The shooting occurred as hundreds of protesters pelted police with stones and tried to block a road in the town. It was unclear whether police or protesters fired the shots.

 Thousands of women activists of MMA, waving copies of the Quran and chanting al-jihad, al-jihad (holy war) rallied in Karachi.

 Police detained around 40 activists of the student wing of an Islamist group in the city of Multan as they tried to stage a demonstration, defying a government ban on rallies in Punjab.

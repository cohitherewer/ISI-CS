 Luxuries to end for Kim

 Seoul, Oct. 13 (Reuters): North Koreas decision to test a nuclear weapon may mean no more French wines and spirits for the Dear Leader or jet skis for his beloved sons.

 The UN is moving closer to imposing sanctions on North Korea for its announced nuclear test on Monday. This would keep luxury goods away from its leaders.

 No one enjoys luxury goods more than paramount leader Kim Jong-il, who boasts the countrys finest wine cellar with space for 10,000 bottles. 

 Kim has a penchant for fine food such as lobster, caviar and the most expensive cuts of sushi that he has flown in to him from Japan, according to Kims former chef Kenji Fujimoto.

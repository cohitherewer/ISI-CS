 No longer Desperate

 Huffman: Upwardly mobile

 Los Angeles, Jan. 24 (AP): Felicity Huffman wasnt supposed to win the Emmy over her more glamourous and talked-about Desperate Housewives co-stars.

 But she did. Now, shes an Academy Award favourite for her performance in Transamerica ? in which she plays a man prepping for sex-change surgery.

 Not bad for an actress who was thinking a few years ago that maybe she wasnt supposed to have a Hollywood career, after all.

 Through the few ups and many downs in her career, Huffman often thought about quitting, pulling into her driveway and crying with her head on the steering wheel after bad days and failed auditions.

 Huffman managed to fleetingly catch the eye of audiences with bit parts, The Spanish Prisoner and Magnolia, and she endeared herself to a cult of fans who caught her as the slightly flighty producer on the acclaimed but short-lived TV series Sports Night.

 To those who wondered why Huffman did not steadily rise to bigger and better parts, the answer is easy. No one offered them to me, Huffman, 43, said in Los Angeless San Fernando Valley.

 Huffmans two breakthroughs came almost simultaneously. After reluctantly meeting ABC about yet another TV project she figured would go nowhere, she was cast as the overwhelmed homemaker Lynette in Desperate Housewives.

 As she was doing an early cast reading of the shows pilot script, Huffman got a call from her agent that she had got the part of Bree in Transamerica, playing a transsexual whose final surgery to become a woman hits a snag after she learns of a teenage son.

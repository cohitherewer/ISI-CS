 Cherie hair bill raises hackles

 Cherie: Cash for coiffeurs

 London, April 21: Cherie Blair was in trouble with angry Labour MPs last night after it was disclosed that she handed the party a ?7,700 bill for her personal hairstylist during last years general election campaign.

 Despite Labours well-publicised financial problems, the Prime Ministers wife asked officials to pay ?275 a day to ensure that she always looked her best. The party has declared the fees for Andre Suard, Cherie Blairs hairdresser, as an election expense.

 Labour MPs voiced dismay that the Prime Ministers wife expected the hard-pressed party to pick up the bill. One senior backbencher described the matter as a cash for coiffeurs scandal. However, party officials brushed aside the criticism and insisted that the payments were completely justified.

 Asked about the scale of Cherie Blairs spending on her hairstylist during the campaign, a party spokesman said: So what? Mrs Blair worked fantastically hard during the election and visited more than 50 constituencies during the campaign.

 She is enormously popular with the party and, dont forget, we won the election.

 However, the spending was criticised by Peter Kilfoyle, a former Labour defence minister, who stressed that he had laid out only ?3,500 on his entire campaign in the Liverpool Walton constituency last year.

 This is a real problem, he said. We are almost accepting by stealth a First Lady.

 His concerns were echoed by another senior backbencher, who said that grassroots members would be furious at the size of the hairdressing bill.

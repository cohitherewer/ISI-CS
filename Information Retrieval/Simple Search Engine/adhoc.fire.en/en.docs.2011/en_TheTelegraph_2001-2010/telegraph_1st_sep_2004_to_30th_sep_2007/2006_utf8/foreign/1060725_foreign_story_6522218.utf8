 Maoist anger over UN letter

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Kathmandu, July 24: Maoist rebels today formally informed the UN that any proposal to decommission only their weapons was unthinkable and unacceptable.

 In a letter to the UN secretary-general, Kofi Annan, Maoist supremo Prachanda objected to the Nepal governments letter to the UN earlier this month asking the world body to monitor Maoist arms. This is to draw your attention to the letter sent to you by the government of Nepal on July 2, 2006, and to register our strong protest and disagreement over certain crucial points of the letter, he said .

 Prachanda said that the government had secretly sought the UNs intervention without consulting the rebels.

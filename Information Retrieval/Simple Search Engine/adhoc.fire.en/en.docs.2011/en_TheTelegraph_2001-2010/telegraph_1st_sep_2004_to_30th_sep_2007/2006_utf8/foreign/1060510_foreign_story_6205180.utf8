 London, May 9: Tony Blair abandoned his election promise to serve a full third term last night, indicating that he could stand down next summer.

 Although he refused to set a timetable for his departure, saying that it would paralyse government, he anointed Gordon Brown as his successor and promised to give him sufficient time to establish himself before the next election.

 As the Labour Party stood on the brink of civil war over the timing of the succession, the Prime Minister acknowledged that he could not go on to the end of his third term, which could last until 2009 or even 2010.

 He appealed to the party to calm down and trust him to honour his commitment to ensure a stable and orderly transition, with the time plainly needed for my successor to establish himself.

 At a packed meeting of Labour MPs at Westminster, Blair spoke of allowing his successor ample time, saying that he wanted his legacy to be a fourth term for Labour.

 One of the MPs present said he expected Blair to hand over to Brown at the party conference in the autumn of 2007, giving the new leader 18 months to prepare for the next election. 

 Although some MPs were critical of Blair, party officials said the majority had been reassured by his promise to allow plenty of time for his successor.

 During last years election campaign, Blair repeatedly denied that he would quit after a couple of years and said he would serve a full four-year term. 

 Since then, his supporters in cabinet have insisted that that was still his intention and that he was staying on to allow time for an alternative to Brown to emerge.

 David Cameron, the Tory leader, said Blair had lost his authority and that Labour was in a state of civil war. He said the government was out of control, running out of steam, ideas, divided from top to bottom, and the sooner Blair goes the better.

 Blair used his monthly Downing Street press conference and the meeting with his backbenchers to confront growing demands for him to make way for Brown this summer after Labours dismal showing in last weeks English local elections.

 No 10 had claimed at the weekend that rebel Labour MPs were planning a coup to oust him. But Blair accepted that those calling on him to agree on a timetable for standing down were not only his Left-wing critics but included loyal, MPs.

 His promise to ensure a stable and orderly transition was welcomed by supporters of Brown but they said they did not trust Blair to stick to it. They said the Prime Minister had yet to consult the chancellor on key policies.

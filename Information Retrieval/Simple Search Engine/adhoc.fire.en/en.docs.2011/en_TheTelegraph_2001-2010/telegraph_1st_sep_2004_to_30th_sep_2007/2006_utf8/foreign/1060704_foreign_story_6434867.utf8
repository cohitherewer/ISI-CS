 Disaster in Dodo death

 Port Louis, July 3 (Reuters): Scientists who unearthed a mass dodo grave in Mauritius say they have found evidence showing the birds were killed by a natural disaster long before humans arrived on the Indian Ocean island.

 Most theories about how the dodo became extinct blame early settlers who found the plump flightless bird on the Indian Ocean island in the 16th century and hunted it relentlessly.

 There are indications that the fossil-rich layer represents the result of natural disaster wiping out a significant part of the Dodo-ecotope, a statement by the researchers said.

 While the latest find does not disprove the human theory, the scientists are convinced there was a mass dodo death, possibly caused by a cyclone or flood, pre-dating the arrival of humans, Christian Foo Kune, owner of the site, said.

 The fact that there are such a wide range of animals there, small and big ones, suggests that there was a sudden natural disaster, Foo Kune said. The mass grave also shows no domestic animals, so it is prior to the arrival of man.

 The bones were thought to be at least 500 years old, he added. We could be talking about a cyclone or repeated cyclones, flooding or a sudden rise in (sea) water levels that trapped the animals there, he said.

 The scientists from the Dodo Research Programme last month recovered a wealth of dodo remains and fossils of other animals and plants, including now-extinct Mauritian giant tortoises, parrots and tree seeds, from a sugar estate in the southeast.

 Researchers on the project say the fossils should enable them to reconstruct the dodos world in the 10,000 years before humans found the bird and determine what caused it to die out.

 CIA officials home raided

 Washington, May 13 (Reuters): Federal agents yesterday searched the home and office of the CIAs former third-highest ranking official who is under investigation because of ties to a figure in a congressional bribery scandal.

 Kyle Dusty Foggo, who announced his retirement from the CIA on Monday, is being investigated by five agencies due to his long-standing friendship with defence contractor Brent Wilkes, an unindicted co-conspirator in the bribery case that landed former Randy Duke Cunningham in prison.

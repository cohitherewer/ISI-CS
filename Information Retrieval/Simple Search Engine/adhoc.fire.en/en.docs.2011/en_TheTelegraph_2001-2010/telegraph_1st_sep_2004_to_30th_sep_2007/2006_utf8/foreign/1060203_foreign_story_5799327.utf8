 Spare Nepal schools: UN

 J HEMANTH

 Kathmandu, Feb. 2: The UN has expressed serious concern over the Nepal governments decision to locate polling stations in schools for the controversial February 8 municipal elections.

 In a statement issued here today, the UN said the conflict between the government and the Maoist rebels was damaging the school system in Nepal. 

 We are now concerned about a new threat: the decision to locate 75 per cent of polling stations for the February 8 municipal elections in schools, it said.

 The UN statement said that it was a normal practice in many countries to use schools to house polling booths. And in schools in countries at peace, there may be more litter in the playground the next day, the desks and furniture may need to be rearranged, but the school goes back to being a school. 

 Referring to the plans of the seven-party Opposition alliance and the Maoist rebels to disrupt the municipal polls, the UN said the election process would render the schools vulnerable to the threat of violence or damage. 

 If schools become a place where the conflict is fought out, then they are no longer safe places of education. 

 The UN said that in countries where elections could result in violence, schools can then become the focus or target of that violence. Nepal does not have enough school buildings at present. Its children cannot afford to lose any more school buildings to explosions. 

 Saying that the progress made in the last 10 years to improve literacy and to get more children into schools is under serious threat, the UN said that the parties to the conflict have engaged in violent and destructive activities in schools. 

 Schools have been caught in the crossfire and have been used as barracks and for political purposes. Their playgrounds have been dug with trenches. Both sides have left explosive devices near school premises, sometimes with fatal results, it said. 

 The UN also urged all sides to respect the needs and rights of children and keep schools free from conflict.

 Meanwhile the Commander of US Pacific Command, Admiral William J Fallon said that differences between the King and the political parties had emboldened the

 Maoist rebels to widen their mass base.

 Winding up his 24-hour long visit to Nepal to convey serious concern by the US Government at the situation in the Himalayan kingdom, he urged all concerned

 parties to sit together to discuss and agree on a way forward to establish a truly participatory government. Reconciliation between the King and the parties is not

 only indispensable to bring back democracy but also to effectively address the insurgency by the Maoists, which given their continued use of violence, could not be

 viewed as a legitimate political actor, he said in a statement issued by the US Embassy today.

 Admiral Fallon met with the King, senior Army officers, political party leaders, and civil society, and also visited RNA troops and facilities in some areas of the

 country. He also met Foreign Minister Ramesh Nath Pandey and Home Minister Kamal Thapa yesterday.

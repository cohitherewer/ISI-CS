 Feline hero

 West Milford, June 10 (AP): A black bear picked the wrong yard for a jaunt, running into a territorial tabby who ran the furry beast up a tree ? twice. 

 Jack, a 7-kg orange and white cat, keeps a close vigil on his property, often chasing small animals, but his owner Donna Dickey said his latest escapade was surprising. A neighbour first saw a bear climb a tree on her property and thought Jack was simply looking up at it, but soon realised it was afraid of the hissing cat. 

 After 15 minutes, the bear descended and tried to run away, but Jack chased it up another tree. When Dickey called Jack home, the bear scurried back to the woods.

 Key chaos 

 Banja Luka, June 10 (AFP): Three robbers were forced to 

suspend a post office raid in Bosnia as the employee who had the key for the safe 

where the money was kept was late for work. The three entered the post office 

and ordered the staff present to open the safe. But they had to leave empty-handed 

after being told that its key was with an employee who was yet to arrive.

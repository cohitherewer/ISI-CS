 Study: Lots of coffee not risky

 Washington, April 25 (Reuters): Go ahead and have that second cup of coffee ? or third, or fourth. A study published yesterday shows heavy, long-term coffee drinking does not raise the risk of heart disease for most people.

 The study, which followed 128,000 men and women for as long as 20 years, showed that drinking filtered coffee ? not espresso or French-style brews ? did not raise the risk of heart disease.

 We believe this study clearly shows there is no association between filtered coffee consumption and coronary heart disease, said Esther Lopez-Garcia, an instructor at the Universidad Autonoma de Madrid in Spain.

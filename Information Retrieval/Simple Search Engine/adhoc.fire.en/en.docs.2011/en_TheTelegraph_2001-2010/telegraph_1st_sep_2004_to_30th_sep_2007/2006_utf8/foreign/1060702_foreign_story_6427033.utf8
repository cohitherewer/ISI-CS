 Condi Russia spat revealed

 Moscow, July 1: US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice is famed for her sang froid but one person seems to be able to rattle her ? Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister.

 The pair are known to have goaded each other on several occasions, reflecting the souring relationship between Washington and Moscow.

 However, a candid conversation between the pair was revealed to the world when a technician failed to switch off an audio feed during a closed-door lunch at a meeting of foreign ministers in Moscow.

 For 20 minutes on Wednesday night, journalists were treated to often-tetchy exchanges about Iraq, interspersed with the tinkle of glasses and the scraping of cutlery.

 Sometimes the tone smacked of the playground as the two bickered over a new US-backed aid programme for Iraq.

 Lavrov tried to explain that the international community should not become involved in Iraqs political process ? something that Rice opposes ? but should be involved in support of the political process.

 What does that mean? Rice demanded.

 After a long pause, Lavrov replied with a sneer: I think you understand.

 No, I dont, she shot back. As Lavrov refused to lend Russian support to the new aid programme, Rice grew increasingly irritated.

 I just want to register that I think its a pity that we cant endorse something thats been endorsed by the Iraqis and by the UN, she said. But if thats how Russia sees it, thats fine.

 There were other angry exchanges during the conversation, which was conducted in English because, although an experienced Sovietologist, Rices Russian is poor.

 Perhaps wisely, the other ministers ? including Margaret Beckett, Britains foreign secretary ? barely spoke during the dinner.

 The Lavrov-Rice sparring continued at a subsequent news conference over issues such as Russias growing control of natural gas supplies in Europe and threats to democratic institutions in Russia.

 Reporters travelling with Rice transcribed the tape of the private lunch but did not tell Rice aides about it until after a senior state department official, briefing reporters on condition of anonymity as usual, assured them that there was absolutely no friction whatsoever between the two senior diplomats.

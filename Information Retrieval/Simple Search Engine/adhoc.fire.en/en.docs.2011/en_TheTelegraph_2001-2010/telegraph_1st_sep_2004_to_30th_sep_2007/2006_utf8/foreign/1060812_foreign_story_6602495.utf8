 Israel starts bigger offensive

 Jerusalem, Aug. 11 (AP): Israel has begun an expanded ground offensive in southern Lebanon after expressing dissatisfaction over an emerging ceasefire deal, government officials said.

 Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and his defence minister, Amir Peretz, made the decision to expand the offensive after meeting for four hours today. Peretz instructed the military to launch the offensive, officials said.

 Olmerts spokesman, Asaf Shariv, said the expanded incursion had already begun. An emerging ceasefire deal being worked out by the UN Security Council fails to meet Israels basic requirements, such as stationing robust international combat troops in southern Lebanon once Israel withdraws, Shariv said.

 Yesterday, we were very optimistic, but they (the Security Council) took the wrong turn, Shariv said.

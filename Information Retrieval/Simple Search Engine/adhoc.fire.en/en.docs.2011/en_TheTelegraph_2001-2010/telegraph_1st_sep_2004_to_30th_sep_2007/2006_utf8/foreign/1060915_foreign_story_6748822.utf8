 Natural Aniston

 Los Angeles, Sept. 14 (Reuters): Even in Hollywood land of breast implants and botox natural counts for something.

 So says an American magazine, which yesterday said Jennifer Aniston topped its list of best-dressed women of 2006 for her natural fashion sense.

 The annual best- and worst-dressed issue of the magazine, which chronicles the life and times of celebrities, hits newsstands tomorrow and features numerous Hollywood stars all given a moniker to describe their taste in couture.

 Oscar winner Halle Berry, dubbed The Classic, is number two behind Aniston, and number three was The Newcomer Jessica Alba, 25, star of movies like last summers hit Fantastic Four. People executive editor Elizabeth Sporkin said for the first time the list was picked by online readers and not the magazines editors. She said Aniston, The Natural, won by 54 per cent. 

 She has a fashion sense that is very accessible, said Sporkin. She wears jeans and T-shirts. She dresses like a regular person, and her evening wear, if you were going to an event, you you could really dress like her.

 Jolie in get-real sermon

 Davos (Switzerland), Jan. 27 (Reuters): Angelina Jolie told a summit of business leaders and politicians, many driven to distraction by the Hollywood siren, to concentrate on the real issues.

 I just think if I can ask anything its for everybody in this room, including myself, to stay focused on the issues, Jolie, a goodwill ambassador for the UN refugee agency, told an audience at the World Economic Forum yesterday. To follow up on Darfur, to watch what is happening in the courts, to follow up on Nepal... on Afghanistan, she said.

 Jolie uses her celebrity pulling power to draw attention to humanitarian crises in places such as Darfur, Chad and Pakistan. The Oscar-winner and her beau Brad Pitt, whose child she is carrying, have reduced the global elite at Davos to star-struck autograph hunters.

 Baby scan

 A gambling site has bought a scan picture it believes is of Jolies baby. The scan appeared for sale on eBay until bosses decided it violated their policy on celebrity materials.

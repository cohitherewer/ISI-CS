 Beijing plays it safe

 Wen Jiabao and Kim Jong Il

 Beijing, July 5 (Reuters): North Koreas missile launches today drew outcries from every major capital ? except Beijing, whose belated, low-key response underlined Chinas dilemma as it struggles to both prop up and pressure Pyongyang.

 We are seriously concerned about the events that have occurred, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao said in a statement. We hope that all sides will maintain calm and restraint.

 China has been an ally of the North since the 1950s and Chinese Vice-Premier Hui Liangyu is due to visit Pyongyang next week to mark a friendship treaty between the communist brothers-in-arms.

 Only last week, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao added his voice to those warning North Korean leader Kim Jong Il not to launch the missiles.

 While North Koreas long-range Taepodong-2 missile appeared to be a literal flop, dropping out of the sky after 40 seconds, Chinese analysts said international uproar over the tests would make it even more difficult for China to juggle its North Korea ties with its hopes for smooth relations with Washington and its partners.

 The test showed that North Korea has made no technological progress in the past 10 years, but this was a political step that will impose more pressure on China than the United States, said Yan Xuetong at Tsinghua University in Beijing. Washington will pressure Beijing to act against Pyongyang, but Pyongyang also wants China to act to lift the financial embargo. 

 China has proudly hosted six-nation talks aimed at ending North Koreas nuclear weapons ambitions. The other participants are the US, South Korea, Japan and Russia.

 But those talks have foundered since November, with North Korea refusing to take part while Washington threatens financial sanctions based on claims the North laundered money earned from drug trafficking and counterfeiting US currency.

 Several Beijing observers said they did not expect China to change its softly-softly diplomacy with North Korea because of its latest move. China considers its ties with Pyongyang too important ? and too brittle ? to risk a public rift, they said.

 China will be privately angry, but it wont change its approach, said Yuan Tiecheng, a Beijing-based researcher for the Shanghai Pacific Institute for International Strategy.

 Chinese President Hu Jintao was feted by Kim Jong-il when he visited Pyongyang in October. In January, Hu chaperoned Kim for much of a secretive nine-day tour of China.

 China is now the Norths main trading partner, and it contributes the lions share of foreign investment into the Norths struggling economy.

 But Chinas sway over Pyongyangs secretive regime is much more limited than many in Washington believe, said Yan, the security expert.

 Maybe China has the biggest foreign impact on North Korea, but while 1 percent impact may be bigger than 0.1, that doesnt mean it can ever be enough, he said.

 Jackson stumbles on plot to ruin him

 Jackson: Thrilling conspiracy

 Los Angeles, Aug. 8 (Reuters): 

 Pop star Michael Jackson has stumbled across a conspiracy 

 by former attorneys, associates and advisers to force him 

 into financial ruin, his spokeswoman said today.

 The plot was discovered after someone leaked documents to Jackson showing that unnamed former lawyers for the 47-year-old singer tried to recruit others into a petition that would drag him unwillingly into bankruptcy court, his spokeswoman and manager Raymone Bain said.

 In what could be one of the biggest conspiracies in entertainment history, documents have been sent to Michael Jackson and his representatives which reveal a deliberate plan by some former attorneys as well as associates and advisers to force Jackson into involuntary bankruptcy, Bain said.

 During his four-month trial on child molestation charges last year, prosecutors asserted that the self-styled King of Pop was in perilous financial shape due to mounting debt.

 Bain declined to name the conspirators, saying that Jackson had ordered his current legal team to investigate the scheme and file lawsuits in multiple jurisdictions.

 In addition, there is a strong possibility that these documents will be forwarded to the US attorney general for review and possible involvement, Bain said.

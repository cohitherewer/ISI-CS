 Toilet geek who makes loos his business 

 - Flush 

with success 

 japans pride: A model toilet 

 Darting through the 3.30 pm passenger rush at a new airport at Kitakyushu in southwestern Japan, a hurried 35-year-old in a gray business suit made a beeline for the mens room. Heading for the nearest open stall, Kyoji Asada threw aside his briefcase and quickly got down to business ? a spot inspection of the toilet bowl. 

 For more than a decade as a top designer for Japans bathroom appliance giant Toto Ltd, Asada has been responsible for developing the Rolls Royces of porcelain thrones. There are toilets with heated seats. Toilets with cleansing water sprays and drying-action air blasts. Toilets with built-in deodorisers and soothing river sounds to cover up embarrassing smells and sounds. 

 Going to the toilet should be about relaxation, comfort and cleanliness, he said. I strongly believe the Japanese have the cleanest and most comfortable toilets in the world. 

 He is here to make sure of that. During his 50- to 60-hour workweeks, random bathroom inspections are one way Asada keeps himself and Totos first-rate team of toilet engineers on their toes. I often do this at friends houses or when Im a dinner guest, said the man Japanese newspapers have dubbed the Toilet Geek. I seize the opportunity whenever I can. 

 The bathrooms at the two-month-old Kitakyushu International Airport contain some of Totos newest, top-of-the-line toilets ? elegant egg-shaped units that seem to hover above the ground. 

 During his first chance to get up close and personal with them since installation, Asadas passion overflowed. We developed them without a base. Their pipes attach from their backs directly into the wall, he said, caressing the toilet with his hand. With nothing underneath, you can see how easy it is for someone to wipe the floor. 

 He lifted the toilet seat and winced at a few drops of seepage dried underneath. This is what these visits are all about, he said. Ill report that we need to find a method to keep this cleaner. 

 As Asada shared his theories with the three people with him, two women and a reporter, an elderly man burst through the door, reaching for his zipper. Startled by the gathering inside, he turned on his heels in search of more tranquil facilities.

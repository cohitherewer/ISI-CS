 Ex-President Ford dead

 Known for Nixon

 Los Angeles, Dec. 27 (Reuters): Former President Gerald Ford, who took office after the Watergate scandal and later stunned the nation by pardoning a disgraced Richard Nixon, has died at his home in California, aged 93.

 Vowing that our long national nightmare is over, Ford took over from Nixon, who on August 9, 1974, became the only US President to resign his office.

 Nixon had been implicated in a cover-up of a break-in at Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate complex in Washington. Ford defended his highly controversial pardon of Nixon until his death. 

 The oldest living US President, Ford served for two-and-a-half years with a style often mocked as bumbling until he lost to Democrat Jimmy Carter.

 New York, June 27 (Reuters): Supermodel Naomi Campbell, who is accused of assaulting a housekeeper with a cellphone, was hit today with accusations from a second maid who claims the celebrity struck her in the head.

 The new civil lawsuit, filed in Manhattan supreme court, accuses Campbell of personal injury, employment discrimination, civil assault and battery. It seeks unspecified damages.

 The maid, Gaby Gibson, told the New York Post in April that Campbell whacked her in the back of the head when she was unable to find a pair of black designer jeans.

 She said it was to teach me a lesson, Gibson told the tabloid, which said Gibson worked in Campbells Park Avenue apartment in Manhattan for three months. Campbells attorney could not immediately be reached for comment. 

 British-born Campbell appeared in a Manhattan criminal court today for a hearing on the second-degree assault case, in which she has pleaded not guilty on charges of striking housekeeper Ana Scolavino with the cellphone. The phone allegedly struck Scolavino in the back of the head, causing a gash that needed four stitches to close.

 In a previous incident with a telephone, Campbell in 1998 assaulted an assistant, Georgina Galanis. The model agreed in 2000 to plead guilty to the assault in a Toronto court in exchange for expressing remorse, paying Galanis an undisclosed amount of money and attending anger management classes.

 House for clip

 Toronto, July 13 (Reuters): A Canadian man was handed the keys to a three-bedroom house yesterday, exactly a year after he offered a red paper clip online, asking to trade it for bigger or better things.

 his latest trade, Kyle MacDonald, 26, swapped a bit role in a Hollywood movie for a house in the small western Canadian town of Kipling, Saskatchewan.

 MacDonald traded in the paper clip for a fish pen and eventually moved up to an afternoon with rocker Alice Cooper before snagging the Hollywood movie role in his 14th trade.

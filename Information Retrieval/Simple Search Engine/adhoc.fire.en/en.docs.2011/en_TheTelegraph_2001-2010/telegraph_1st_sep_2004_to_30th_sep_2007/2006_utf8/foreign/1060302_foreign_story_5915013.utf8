 Faulty forgery

 Nicosia, March 1 (Reuters): You might have the best forgery skills in the world, but it is not much use if you cannot spell.

 A Cyprus court jailed Pakistani national Fazal-ur-Rehman for eight months for forgery after police spotted spelling mistakes on stamps on an Afghan passport he was carrying ? otherwise it was a near-perfect copy, the Cyprus Mail said on Wednesday.

 Ministry was spelt Menistry and the first was missing from government, the newspaper said.

 The passport looked perfect and professionally made... almost deemed original by forensics, a police officer told a magistrate in the Cypriot capital Nicosia.

 Tyra cover

 Los Angeles (AP): Tyra Banks really throws herself into her job as a talk-show host, often in ways only a recently retired supermodel can. On Wednesdays show, for instance, Banks will be shown going undercover as a stripper at a topless club, although the former Victorias Secret model stops short of complete disclosure. The stripper segment, she said, was the result of hearing friends and viewers express frustration about the men in their lives spending time and money in strip clubs. When I found out the majority of business is from males from married homes, I wanted to go inside the minds of the men who frequent these clubs, Banks said.

 Paul seals

 Toronto (AP): Paul McCartney and his wife will travel to the ice floes off the Canadian Maritimes this week to observe seal pups before the annual hunt opens, the Humane Society of the US said. The former Beatle and Heather Mills McCartney will head out to the frigid ice floes in the Gulf of St Lawrence on Thursday and Friday in their bid to prompt Ottawa to end the annual hunt of seals. Heather and Pauls visit to the seal pups will shine a global media spotlight on this cruel and needless slaughter, Rebecca Aldworth, the societys director.

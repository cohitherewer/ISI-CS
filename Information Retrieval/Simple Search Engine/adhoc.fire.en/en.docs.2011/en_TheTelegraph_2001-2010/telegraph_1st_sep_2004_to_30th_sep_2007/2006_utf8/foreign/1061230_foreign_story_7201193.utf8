 Ershad to appeal against ban

 Dhaka, Dec. 29 (Reuters): Former army ruler Hossain Mohammad Ershad appealed today against the Bangladesh election commissions decision to ban him from contesting next months parliamentary elections.

 Ershads lawyers submitted petitions to the commission, requesting it reverse its decision to reject his nomination due to legal troubles he faces over corruption charges, and instead declare him a valid candidate for the January 22 election.

 We hope the commission will consider the appeal in a truly democratic spirit and find a legal way to allow him to contest the poll, said Ruhul Amin Hawlader, secretary-general of Ershads Jatiya Party.

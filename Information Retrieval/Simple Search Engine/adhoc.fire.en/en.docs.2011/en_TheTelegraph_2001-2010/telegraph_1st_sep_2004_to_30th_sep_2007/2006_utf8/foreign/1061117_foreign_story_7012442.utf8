 Nepal peace deal delayed

 J. HEMANTH

 Kathmandu, Nov. 16: The signing of the peace accord between the Seven-Party Alliance and Maoist rebels was postponed today after fresh differences cropped up between the two sides over some key issues.

 Maoist spokesman Krishna Bahadur Mahara told reporters that the signing of the accord was postponed due to differences on certain critical issues. However, he refused to reveal the reasons for the postponement.

 Maoist sources said that the differences surfaced over some provisions of the interim constitution during talks between the two teams in the Bhaktapur guest house this morning. They said the Maoist party ideologue Baburam Bhattarai walked out of the meeting after the government failed to respond to Maoist requests on the constitution. 

 Home minister Krishna Prasad Sitaula said that efforts were being made to iron out the differences so that the peace accord can be signed. He hoped that the accord would be signed next week when the interim constitution is to be approved by the two sides. 

 Sitaula said that the new date for the signing of the accord would be announced after consultations between Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala and Maoist chief Prachanda.

 If the pact had been signed today, the accord would have formally ended the 12-year-old conflict. The visiting CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury today said he had invited Koirala and Prachanda to visit India after the formation of the interim government.

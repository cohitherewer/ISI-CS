 Gene link to Confucius

 Confucius: Blood is thicker

 Shanghai, June 16 (Reuters): Chinese claiming Confucius for an ancestor can now use a genetic test to prove a direct blood connection to the grandfather of Chinese social mores, a state newspaper said today.

 The fifth-century BC social philosophers ideas of filial piety and deference to elders influence Chinese society and politics even today.

 Now his countrymen can establish a genetic link in a test that will cost more than 1,000 yuan ($125), according to the Shanghai Morning Post.

 We would like to help these unconfirmed claimants to test their DNA and to establish a Confucius-DNA database, it quoted Deng Yajun, a DNA expert from Beijing Institute of Genomics, as saying.

 How the scientists had obtained a sample of Confuciuss DNA was not explained.

 One of the most difficult things in the project is to confirm the blood connections of these numerous claimants, said Kong Dewei, one of the editors of the new family tree, who has the same Chinese surname of Confucius, Kong in Chinese.

 Association with Confucianism was fatal during the tumult of the Cultural Revolution, when old China and its traditions were condemned as reactionary by fervent Communist Red Guards.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Loss of respect

 Dubai, Feb. 16 (Reuters): Arabs said today new images of US troops abusing Iraqi prisoners had eroded their respect for the West and would fuel the fury raging over cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad.

 The photographs made headline news in West Asia the day after an Australian television station broadcast previously unpublished film and photographs of violations at Baghdads Abu Ghraib jail. They could not have emerged at a worse time for the Wests image in the region. Emotions were already running high over cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad published in European newspapers. 

 This is awful because I always look up to the British and Americans as the best in the world, said Kuwaiti firefighter Khalil al-Amir. They are supposed to be more civilised. But when I see something like this it makes me think twice.

 Iraq seethes

 New images of abuse at Abu Ghraib prison prompted Iraqi President Jalal Talabani to condemn the US today, demanding harsh punishment for savage crimes as Iraqis seethed over more humiliation. We have condemned these savage crimes. We reject that a civilised country allow its soldiers to commit these ugly and terrible crimes, Talabani said.

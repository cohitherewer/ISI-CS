 Israel halts payments to Palestine

 Jerusalem, Feb. 19 (Reuters): Israel today called a permanent halt to monthly transfer of funds to the Palestinian authority but settled for a watered-down package of other sanctions after a Hamas-led Palestinian parliament was sworn in.

 In Gaza, Ismail Haniyeh, Hamass choice for Prime Minister, said everything will be on the table when he and other leaders of the militant group meet President Mahmoud Abbas later in the day for talks on forming a national unity government.

 Interim Prime Minister Ehud Olmerts cabinet appeared to bow to US calls to avoid adding to Palestinian hardship, deciding against tough measures Israeli defence officials proposed to weaken Hamas.

 These included ban on the entry 

 of Palestinian workers into Israel and restriction on the 

 movement of Palestinians between the Gaza Strip and the 

 occupied West Bank.

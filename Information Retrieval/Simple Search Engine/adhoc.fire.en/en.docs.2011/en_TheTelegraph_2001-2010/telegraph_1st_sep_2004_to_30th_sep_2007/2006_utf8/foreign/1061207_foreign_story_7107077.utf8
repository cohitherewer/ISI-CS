The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Australia yes to cloning

 Canberra, 

 Dec. 6 (Reuters): Australia will allow embryonic 

 stem cells to be cloned for research after lawmakers today 

 defied conservative Prime Minister John Howard in an emotive 

 parliamentary debate.

 Parliaments lower house approved new laws that bring Australia into line with Britain, and some states in the US, which scientists say will make it easier for Australia to attract medical researchers and allow greater international collaboration.

 Howard allowed a rare free vote on the issue in parliament, meaning lawmakers were not bound by their partys stance, but said he opposed any relaxation of the stem cell restrictions during a debate that split all parties in Australias parliament. 

 I dont think the science has shifted enough to warrant the parliament changing its view, Howard said today. I think we do live in an age where we have slid too far into relativism, and there must be some absolutes in our society.

 But Australias lower house of parliament overturned a ban imposed in 2002 that only allowed research on embryos left over from IVF programmes. Church and right-to-life groups strongly opposed the new laws. But prominent medical researchers, including Ian Frazer whose research led to a vaccine for cervical cancer, backed the changes.

 The new laws allow stem cells to be cloned for use in research, but will continue bans on importing or exporting cloned embryos, and maintain a ban on placing cloned embryos into a human body or the body of an animal.

 The vote is the second parliamentary defeat this year for Australias health minister Tony Abbott, who once trained to be a Catholic priest. He also lost his ministerial right to veto the use of the controversial abortion drug RU-486 in February.

 Abbott, a moral conservative, said cloned embryos were indistinguishable from embryos used for IVF, and he urged lawmakers to vote against the laws on moral grounds rather than from concerns about people with chronic disabilities. We owe it to the beloved dead to base our policies on our principles, and not on our grief, Abbott said.

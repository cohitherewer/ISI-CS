 Cruise a worst actor contender

 Los Angeles, Jan. 31 (Reuters): Tom Cruise may have survived a Martian attack in last years remake of War of the Worlds, but he has failed to elude Hollywoods movie police.

 The actor was among the contenders announced yesterday for the annual Razzie Awards, which honour the worst achievements in film.

 Cruise will compete for the years worst actor award with Will Ferrell (Bewitched, Kicking amp; Screaming), Jamie Kennedy (Son of the Mask), Dwayne The Rock Johnson (Doom) and Rob Schneider (Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo). The nominees were announced by The Golden Raspberry Award Foundation, a tongue-in-cheek organisation that claims more than 700 voting members.

 Foundation head John Wilson said in an interview he did not think Cruises portrayal of a working-class man in War of the Worlds was particularly credible.

 While there were arguably worse performances, Cruises off-screen antics ensured he made the grade, Wilson said.

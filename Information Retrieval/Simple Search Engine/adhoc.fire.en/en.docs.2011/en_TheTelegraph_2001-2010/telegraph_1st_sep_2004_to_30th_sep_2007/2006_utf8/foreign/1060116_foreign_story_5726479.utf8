 Fame craze in UK

 London, Jan. 15 (Reuters): Dazzled by the attractions of fame, more than one in 10 young Britons would quit school to become tomorrows tabloid star, a survey has said.

 In a country obsessed by celebrities, a growing number 

of children are more interested in becoming rich and famous than getting a good 

education, the study by the Learning and Skills Council has said. Around 9 per 

cent thought fame was a great way to earn money without skills or qualifications, 

it added. 

Britains tabloids are littered with revelations about C-list celebrities and the countrys most famous couple, David and Victoria Beckham, have made millions of pounds from gracing the front pages. 

 Rubiks cube record

 Francisco (AP): A 20-year-old California Institute 

of Technology student set a new world record for solving the popular Rubiks 

cube, turning the tiled brain-twister from scrambled to solved in 11.13 seconds 

on Saturday. Leyan Lo is part of Caltechs Rubiks Cube Club, a brainy 

clutch of students. The world record alone wouldnt gain Lo the overall champions 

title at the event, which is determined by averaging three of five solution times 

in the final round. For that title, Lo went up against the teenager widely considered 

the fastest Rubiks cube solver on the planet ? Shotaro Macky 

Makisumi, a high school sophomore.

 Swan love

 Berlin, May 26 (Reuters): A swan has fallen in love with a plastic swan-shaped paddle boat on a pond in the German town of Muenster and has spent the past three weeks flirting with the vessel five times its size, a sailing instructor said today. 

 Peter Overschmidt, who rents the two-seat paddle boat on the Aasee pond, said the black swan has not left the white swan boats side since it flew in one day in early May.

 New York, April 2 (Reuters): Thousands of immigrants and their supporters chanted, blew whistles and waved flags from dozens of Latin American countries yesterday as they marched across New Yorks Brooklyn Bridge to support immigrant rights.

 The festive crowd of more than 10,000 shouted We are all Americans, and carried banners in Spanish and English saying We are not criminals and Immigrant rights are human rights as they crossed the East River from Brooklyn to Manhattan.

 We are workers not terrorists, said Augustin Rangel, 40, who came from Mexico four years ago and has two jobs as a painter and bar worker. We work hard for this country and for our families. We want the same rights as everyone else.

 The New York protest was the largest of several held across the country to protest an immigration bill being debated by Congress that would toughen enforcement and tighten border security as concerns rise about illegal immigration.

 The issue is being fiercely debated as November mid-term elections approach and has posed a dilemma for President George W. Bush, who wants Congress to approve a guest-worker programme despite strong opposition from within his Republican Party.

 The rally point in New York was the square outside the Federal Plaza building in Manhattan where immigrants line up on weekdays to have federal officials process their visas. Yesterday, it was a colourful sea of flags and resembled a street festival with children, parents, and senior citizens.

 Camella Pinkney-Price of the Hispanic Evangelical Churches said the march was held to protest an immigration bill that could criminalise anyone who helped any of the nations estimated 11 million undocumented workers.

 We want to say that we deserve to be legal, she said. Why are people called illegal immigrants when they have shed blood, sweat and tears to work in this country?

 The House of Representatives passed a bill last December that defines illegal aliens as felons and calls for the construction of a 1,120-km fence along the US-Mexico border.

 The Senate is debating an alternative that provides a way for temporary workers as well as illegal immigrants to eventually become US citizens, as well as toughen workplace enforcement of immigration rules. 

 Jose Richards, who came to the US in the 1960s and remains here legally, carried a Jamaican flag as a banner that said: Leave no immigrant behind.

I do not support the part of the bill that makes 

undocumented immigrants felons, Richards said. We are not criminals.

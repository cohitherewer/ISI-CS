 Havana, Aug. 14 (Reuters): Ailing Cuban leader Fidel Castro received a visit at his bedside from his main ally Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, the Communist Party newspaper Granma said today, publishing pictures of the two men.

 The daily said Castro, who underwent stomach surgery two weeks ago, was fighting for life. The gallery of pictures posted on Granmas website (http://www.granma.cubaweb.cu) show Chavez shaking Castros hand on his 80th birthday yesterday, handing him presents, writing notes together and drinking what appears to be milk. Castro is lying in bed in what looks like a hospital room. The two men, fierce critics of US policies in Latin America, are wearing bright red shirts.

 Also present at the reunion was Castros younger brother Raul, who made his first public appearance on Sunday as acting President of Cuba when he greeted Chavez at Havana airport.

 It was an unforgettable afternoon, shared between brothers of the cause, that brought new strength and encouragement to the brave Comandante of a thousand battles who is seeking a new victory for life, Granma said.

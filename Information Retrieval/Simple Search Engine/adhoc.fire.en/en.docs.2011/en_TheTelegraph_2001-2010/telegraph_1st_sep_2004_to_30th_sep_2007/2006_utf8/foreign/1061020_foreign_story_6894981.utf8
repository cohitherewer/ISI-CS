 Sting prefers ballads to rock

 Berlin, Oct. 19 (Reuters): British rock star Sting said contemporary rock music is so stagnant that he prefers to sing 16th century English ballads.

 The former teacher who shot to fame as lead singer, bassist and composer in the 1970s and 80s for The Police told German newspaper Die Zeit that he prefers singing songs of Elizabethan lutenist and composer John Dowland to the rock music of today.

 Rock music has come to a standstill, its not going forward anymore, it only bores me, Die Zeit quoted the 55-year-old singer as saying.

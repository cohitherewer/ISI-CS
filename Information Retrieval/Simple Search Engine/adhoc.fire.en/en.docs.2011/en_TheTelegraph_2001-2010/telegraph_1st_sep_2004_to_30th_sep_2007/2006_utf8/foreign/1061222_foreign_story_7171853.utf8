 Treatment to be forced on cancer girl

 London, Dec. 21: An eight-year-old cancer sufferer who does not want to continue painful radiotherapy could be forced to have the treatment, her parents said yesterday.

 Leah-Beth Richards, who has fought cancer for six years, relapsed after a three-year remission and is facing another recovery battle. 

 Her parents, Kathryn and Mark Richards, have supported their daughter but said they have been told they face possible legal action by the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff if they allow her to refuse treatment.

 Kathryn Richards, 36, said her daughter, who has been diagnosed with Wilms tumour, had beaten the disease twice but it had returned and left her with little quality of life.

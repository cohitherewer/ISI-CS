 Kabul, June 3 (Reuters): Afghanistans President Hamid Karzai has sacked dozens of senior police officials days after anti-US riots in Kabul, an official said today.

 The shake-up includes Kabuls police chief, General Jamil Junbish, whose forces failed to prevent rioters from rampaging through the city on Monday after a US military truck crashed into Afghan vehicles, killing at least five.

 He has been replaced by General Amanullah Gozar the commander for the highway where riots began and where the accident happened.

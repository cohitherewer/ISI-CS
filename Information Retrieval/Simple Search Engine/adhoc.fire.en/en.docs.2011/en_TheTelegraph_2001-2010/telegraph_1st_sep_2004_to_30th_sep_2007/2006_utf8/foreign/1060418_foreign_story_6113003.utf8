 Glare on Hamas govt after Tel Aviv blast

 Tel Aviv, April 17 (Reuters): A Palestinian suicide bomber killed nine people and wounded 60 others in the Israeli city of Tel Aviv today in an attack a spokesman for the Islamic militant group Hamas called an act of self-defence.

 The Israeli government of acting Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said it held the new Hamas-led Palestinian Authority responsible for the bombing, which was claimed by the Islamic Jihad group.

 Olmert said he was weighing a response, adding the attack could have been timed to coincide with the swearing in of Israels new parliament in Jerusalem following March elections.

 In the northern Gaza Strip town of Beit Lahiye, an Israeli artillery shell killed a Palestinian and wounded two others, medics said. The Israeli military has been firing towards areas where militants launch cross-border rocket attacks.

 The Tel Aviv bombing occurred at a sandwich shop in the middle of the week-long Jewish Passover holiday. Medics put the number killed at nine, not including the bomber.

 The shop, target of a suicide attack in January in which only the bomber died, was wrecked while pools of blood lay on the ground outside. Three cars were damaged.

 I am beyond despair, said Asher Bracha, 46, owner of a small market two doors from the shop. I heard a deafening blast. I knew it was another attack.

 Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, a moderate, condemned the bombing, as did the US and France. It is a despicable act of terror for which there is no excuse or justification, White House spokesman Scott McClellan said.

 Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri called the attack a natural result of the continued Israeli crimes against our people. Our people are in a state of self-defence and they have every right to use all means to defend themselves. 

 It was the first suicide bombing inside the Jewish state to kill Israelis since Olmert took over from Ariel Sharon, who was incapacitated by a massive stroke in January.

 An Arab television station aired a video tape showing a young militant from Islamic Jihad, holding an assault rifle, and said he carried out the attack. 

We tell the criminal enemy that there are more 

martyrdom-seekers (suicide bombers), God willing, said the bomber, 18-year-old 

Sami Salim Hamad, from near Jenin in the occupied West Bank.

 Fertile phone

 Tokyo, Oct. 30 (Reuters): Is it a phone call, a text message or simply time to make love?

 A new mobile phone available through Japans NTT DoCoMo can ring to let would-be mothers know when they reach the most fertile part of their monthly reproductive cycles.

 By tapping in data on menstruation dates, the user can programme the phone to alert her three days before ovulation and again on the day. The company warns that the calculations are based on average cycles.

 The phone was the idea of female designer Momoko Ikuta, who also provided its pastel paisley look.

 The handset provides several other functions designed to appeal to women, such as a recipe database and a button on the side that sets off acamouflage melody, allowing the user to avoid unwanted attention by pretending to receive a call. 

 Love witch

 Berlin (Reuters): A German woman won a lawsuit against a love witch who failed to induce her ex-boyfriend to come back with rituals under the full moon designed to cast a spell over him, a Munich court said on Monday. The witch lost, said Munich district court spokeswoman Ingrid Kaps. The love witch was ordered to return her 1,000 euro fee and pay several hundred euros in costs.

 Whos back 

 London (Reuters): British rock band The Who is back with its first album in 24 years, but guitarist Pete Townshend said on Monday that the music was just the same old stuff. Im feeling excited about it, the songwriter said in London.I never thought wed get another Who album. I dont think Roger (Daltrey) did either, so we are pleased. Townshend and lead singer Daltrey are the only two survivors of the original lineup, after bass guitarist John Entwistle and drummer Keith Moon died in 2002 and 1978 respectively.

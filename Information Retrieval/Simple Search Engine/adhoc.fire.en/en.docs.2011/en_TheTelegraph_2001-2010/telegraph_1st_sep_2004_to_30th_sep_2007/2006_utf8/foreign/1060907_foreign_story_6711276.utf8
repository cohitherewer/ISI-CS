 Lahore, Sept. 6 (AP): A Pakistani court today ordered that a 12-year-old Scottish girl in an international custody dispute not be detained for deportation to the UK for at least 48 hours, after family members in Pakistan expressed fears shed be deported against her will.

 The high court in the eastern city of Lahore also asked Pakistani authorities and the British High Commission in the country whether any attempts are under way to repatriate Molly Campbell, also known as Misbah Iram Ahmed Rana.

 The girl arrived on August 26 in Lahore, along with her Pakistani father and her older sister.

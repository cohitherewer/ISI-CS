 London, Dec. 22 (Reuters): Travellers struggling to get home for Christmas faced another day of chaos today, with some 350 flights cancelled at LondonsHeathrow airport for a second day due to a thick blanket of fog.

 But some relief was in sight, with British Airways, which has suffered most cancellations, saying it aimed to fly 95 per cent of customers in and out of Heathrow as planned tomorrow.

 The airline said it planned extra flights with bigger planes to try to ease disruption as the fog begins to clear.

 We are hopeful that the weather will improve slightly over the weekend and, therefore, we can get back to operating a full planned Christmas Eve schedule, said Geoff Want, the airlines director of ground operations.

 We are drafting in extra staff from across the airline over the weekend to ensure that customers get to their final destinations before Christmas Day.

 Britains Met Office predicted widespread fog for tomorrow, possibly lingering in some areas on Sunday, Christmas Eve.

 Yesterday, 350 flights were cancelled and a similar number were stopped today, said a spokesman for airport operator BAA, which runs Heathrow and six other British airports.

 It is the worlds busiest international airport but we have only two runways... We have fundamental capacity constraints, BAA spokesman Simon Baugh told BBC radio.

 BA said it was offering customers the three Rs rebooking, rerouting and refunds. In below freezing conditions, passengers were offered hot drinks, woolly hats and blankets by staff.

 Father Christmas tried to offer some cheer to demoralised passengers with three red and white suited Santas despatched to raise morale.

 We understand that Christmas is an extremely important time of year for our customers and their families and we are working around the clock to give every assistance possible, Want said.

 Dan McKenzie, 35, spent his birthday at Heathrow trying to get a 40-minute flight to Belfast after a San Francisco holiday. The holiday memories have evaporated, he said. It is not a good advert for one of the biggest airports in the world.

 Despite air traffic control rules which slowed landings and take-offs by 50 per cent, a BA spokesman said the airline managed to get 80 per cent of passengers to their destinations yesterday, some going by minibuses or coaches. BA has booked 5,000 hotel rooms over the past two nights to accommodate others. Thousands packed on to trains to try to get home.

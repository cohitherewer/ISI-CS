 Pervez book error corrected

 Islamabad, Oct. 23 (PTI): An error that was spotted in the English version of President Pervez Musharrafs autobiography In The Line of Fire, has been corrected in the Urdu version, Sub Sey Pehlay Pakistan.

 The correction was made in the opening paragraph of Chapter 23 titled Taaqub (Manhunt) that highlights the role Pakistan played in capturing al Qaida suspects after the 9/11 attacks on US cities. 

 In the English version, Musharraf wrote that Pakistan had captured 689 al Qaida members and handed over 369 to the US. 

 We have earned bounties totalling millions of dollars. Those who habitually accuse us of not doing enough in the war on terror should simply ask the CIA how much prize money it has paid to the government of Pakistan.

 In the Urdu edition, the reference to having earned bounties totalling millions of dollars and prize money has been dropped. Within two days of his book launch in New York, Musharraf had admitted to having made a mistake and said that an amendment was in order. 

 That is my error. It doesnt come to government of Pakistan. I should not have written that, he added.

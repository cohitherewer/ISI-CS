 German arrest

Berlin, Aug. 19 (AP): German authorities today 

arrested a Lebanese student suspected of helping plant two bombs that failed to 

explode on trains last month, officials said.

 The 21-year-old was believed to be one of two men seen in a video recording from Colognes main station on July 31, the day of the attempted bombing, who were believed to have planted the devices. Chief prosecutor Monika Harms said the man had been in Germany since 2004.

 The man was arrested in the early morning at the main station in the Baltic Sea port city of Kiel, where he had studied. Joerg Ziercke, the head of Germanys Federal Crime Office, said he was confident that we caught the right suspected bomb planter here in Kiel today. The devices, made with gas canisters, were found on board trains in Dortmund and Koblenz, both of which had stopped in Cologne.

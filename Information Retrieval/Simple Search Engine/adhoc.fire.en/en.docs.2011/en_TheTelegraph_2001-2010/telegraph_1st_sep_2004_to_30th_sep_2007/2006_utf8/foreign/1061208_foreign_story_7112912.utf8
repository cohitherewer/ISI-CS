The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 On ramp with health proof

 Sao Paulo, Dec. 7 (Reuters): Models taking part in Sao Paulos big fashion show next month must show proof of their good health as part of a campaign launched in response to the death of a Brazilian model from complications from anorexia.

 Models who are under the age of 16 will also be banned from the catwalks in Sao Paulo Fashion Week, a major event in the fashion world that takes place from January 24-29 in the Brazilian city. Everyone needs to play their part in recognising their responsibilities and obligations in an ethical and pro-active way, Fashion Week creative director Paulo Borges said last night. The death last month of Sao Paulo-based model Ana Carolina Reston, 21, renewed concern over the use in the fashion industry of underweight models promoting an ultra-slim look. She had suffered from the eating disorder anorexia, in which victims obsessively deprive themselves of food. Model agencies must provide Fashion Week organisers with signed medical certificates testifying to the womens good health. A media campaign will also promote awareness of health problems to which models and other young women are vulnerable.

 Models under the age of 16 will also not be allowed to participate in the event. Two of Brazils top models, Camila Finn and Bruna Sotilli, are both aged 15. In September, Spain caused a storm in the fashion world when Madrid barred models below a certain weight from its top show.

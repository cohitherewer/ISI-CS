 Judge bribes

 Beijing, Oct. 27 (Reuters): Several former judges in east China were tried this week for taking bribes, state media reported today, in the midst of a nationwide crackdown on corruption that is highlighting the scale of official abuses.

 The judges were accused of taking bribes while serving in Fuyang, a city in eastern Chinas Anhui province that has given the country some of its most lurid corruption scandals. A Hong Kong newspaper reported today that a similar judicial scandal was unfolding in southern China.

 Zhang Zimin, former president of the Fuyang Intermediate Court, took 1.3 million yuan ($162,000) in return for securing jobs for cronies and rigging court judgements, Xinhua news agency reported late yesterday. Shang Jun, a former police officer who served on the court before becoming a vice-mayor and then deputy head of the provincial health authority, took about 900,000 yuan ($114,000) for arranging official jobs, Xinhua said.

 She was also accused of having assets worth 980,000 yuan ($124,000) from sources she could not account for. Numerous other judges, including several others under Zhangs supervision, were also involved in similar charges, the report said, citing two other cases of judges each taking bribes worth over a million yuan. The judges were tried on Wednesday in Anhui, but no verdict was announced. In the southern city of Shenzhen, five judges were questioned by anti-graft investigators in a widening judicial corruption scandal in the city, the South China Morning Post reported.

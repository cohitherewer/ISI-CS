The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 After Nepal, island

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New 

 Delhi, April 25: On a day India heaved a sigh of 

 relief after the breakthrough in Nepal, it was forced to 

 shift attention quickly to unrest in another neighbouring 

 country.

 Defence minister Pranab Mukherjee tonight spoke to Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapakse to express shock at the suicide bombing in Colombo. The suicide attack, believed to be carried out by the Tamil Tigers, has virtually broken the ceasefire between the government troops and the rebels. 

 Mukherjee termed the incident a brazen act of terrorism. He said India stood by the Lankan government and the people in this difficult hour. He told Rajapakse that India favoured political dialogue to resolve outstanding issues.

 The Lankan President appreciated Indias gesture and thanked it for the support and solidarity shown, a statement issued by the external affairs ministry in Delhi said.

 The bid on the life of army chief Sarath Fonseka has closed doors of communication between the two sides, raising the spectre of a full-fledged civil war.

 The attack has taken place after the Tigers refused to take part in the second round of peace talks in Geneva brokered by the Norwegians. Delhi was the focus of activity earlier this month and India was actively engaged in the bid to salvage the second Geneva round.

 Norwegian minister Eric Solheim briefed Delhi about the peace process and gave the feedback that ties between the Sri Lankan government and the Tamil Tigers were at the lowest.

 India also hosted key Opposition leader Ranil Wickramsinghe to nudge him to reach a political settlement and support the peace talks. The Rajapakse government sent representatives to meet the Indian government to put across Lankas point of view.

 The Indian intelligence agencies had tipped the government that the ceasefire will break down on the island as the Tigers were preparing for a major offensive.

 India had expressed deep concern at the escalation of violence in the eastern part of Sri Lanka that brought the ceasefire under strain. Colombo had told Delhi that it would show restraint but the latest attack has changed the situation.

 Haggling delays Iran vote

 Vienna, Feb. 3 (Reuters): The UN nuclear watchdog deferred until tomorrow a vote to report Iran to the UN Security Council over fears it is seeking atomic bombs, as the EU lobbied developing nations to back the measure.

 Diplomats said a clear majority on the International Atomic Energy Agencys 35-nation board favoured notifying the council on Iran, but EU diplomats needed more time to persuade as many developing states as possible to vote yes rather than abstain.

 Iran warned it would curb IAEA checks on its atomic sites if sent to the council, a threat that seemed to influence efforts by developing states to soften the EU-sponsored resolution.

 EU diplomats said the threat would not deter their efforts to induce the Islamic Republic to change course. The IAEA board held a crisis session yesterday and had planned to re-convene today, before the delay was announced. The board is now due to meet at 0900 GMT tomorrow.

 We are trying as best we can to secure as broad as possible consensus on the board for reporting Iran, said a diplomat with the one of the sponsoring powers, Britain, France and Germany.

 The resolution is being revised, a senior diplomat close to the IAEA said earlier.

 Asked about the haggling, a western diplomat said: The threat (to restrict inspections) is on everyones minds but we consider it blackmail and if we give in to that, theres no end to it. He said the negotiations with developing states focused on clarifying a clause in the resolution so that it could not be construed as ending IAEA oversight of Irans case.

 US and EU leaders, aware that Russia, China and developing states on the IAEA board want to avoid a showdown with Iran, the worlds number four oil exporter, said yesterday that reporting Tehran would not end diplomacy or trigger early UN sanctions.

 Irans deputy nuclear negotiator warned that involving the Security Council would also kill talks on a Russian offer to defuse the crisis by enriching Iranian uranium to ensure the Islamic Republic cannot divert it for bombs.

 Some developing nations fear a drift towards UN sanctions against Iran and resent the western push to single out Tehran before the IAEA concludes inquiries into its nuclear programme.

 They argued that the clause in the dispute appeared to pre-empt the outcome of a comprehensive investigative report that IAEA chief Mohamed ElBaradei is due to deliver for a regular March 6 board meeting, as well as any dialogue on Russias proposals.

 Analysts earlier reckoned on a majority of 25-30 on the 35-member IAEA board in favour of the resolution, with only a few nos from nations such as Syria, Venezuela and Cuba. 

 Russia and China endorsed the EU-sponsored resolution after Tehran was given at least until March to cooperate fully with UN investigators before the council takes any action.

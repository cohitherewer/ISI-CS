 Critics hail Dylans new album

 Dylan: Great times

 New York, Aug. 29 (Reuters): Bob Dylans new album Modern Times was released today to rave reviews that showed the 65-year-old legend has plenty to say about the changing times since his last record came out on September 11, 2001.

 But in typical fashion, the gravel-voiced star of the 1960s known for mumbling his words says it in elusive fashion. National Public Radio critic Tom Moon said that much had happened since Dylans last studio album Love and Theft, released on the day of the September 11 attacks in Washington and New York, but the new album showed Dylan wrestling with tough issues in a sly fox sort of roundabout way.

 Those expecting an inventory of catastrophe will be disappointed, Moon said.

 Dylan just glances at current events and thats all it takes for him to conjure up the dread of the age. His songs catch the curious blend of unwavering faith and formless fear that distinguishes the present moment.

 Critic Steve Jones, writing in USA Today, praised the album by saying: It takes about 30 seconds to figure out youre in the presence of greatness.

 He said the album contains some of Dylans most direct love lyrics, vindictive vendettas, meditations on mortality, pointed political commentary, dry wit, apocalyptic imagery and head-scratching flights of fancy sometimes in the same song.

 Jon Pareles in The New York Times said that even in a song titled, The Levees Gonna Break, Dylan merely hints at the devastation of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans last year.

 The particulars of the present mean less and less to the songwriter who radically and irrevocably changed popular music in the 1960s, Pareles wrote of the album.

 The 10 tracks on the album range from love songs such as Spirit in the Water, featuring the lyrics You think Im over the hill/ You think Im past my prime, to Workingmans Blues , a critique of the US economy that Gilbert said could have been written by Bruce Springsteen.

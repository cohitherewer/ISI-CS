 Iran strikes deal but cloud stays

 Bushehr, Iran, Feb. 26 (Reuters): Iran has reached a basic agreement with Russia on jointly enriching uranium, officials said today ? but there was no immediate sign that it would suspend homegrown enrichment to allay fears that it is developing nuclear weapons.

 A deal will help the Indian government also to avert a clash with the Left, which is waiting to see what stand Delhi will take at a meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency on March 6. The meeting may determine whether the US and European powers push the Security Council to impose sanctions on Iran.

 It was unclear what this basic agreement involved and both Russian and Iranian officials identified serious obstacles to a full deal.

 These principally concerned a suspension of Tehrans homegrown uranium enrichment work, the main demand of western powers who are threatening to press for UN sanctions.

 The original Russian proposal had been for Irans uranium to be enriched in Russia to defuse suspicions that Iran might divert some nuclear fuel into a weapons programme.

 However, Iran has always insisted upon its right to enrich the uranium it mines in its central desert on its own soil, and it was unclear how the original Russian proposal could be tailored to please Tehran.

 Regarding this joint venture, we have reached a basic agreement. Talks to complete this package will continue in coming days in Russia, Iranian nuclear chief Gholamreza Aghazadeh said in the Iranian port town of Bushehr.

 But Sergei Kiriyenko, head of Russias atomic energy agency, speaking at a news conference with Aghazadeh, said Iran still had to take serious steps before the deal could be completed.

 He did not specify what these would be, but an unnamed Russian official in Bushehr told Interfax news agency that the deal could only go ahead if Iran suspended its own uranium enrichment ? something it has repeatedly refused to do.

 Aghazadeh also stipulated that Iran would be setting an unspecified precondition. An EU diplomat said: Their idea of accepting the Russian proposal is to be able to enrich in Russia and Iran, not just Russia. 

 Europe and Washington have said they could not accept such a compromise.

 Iran has already been reported to the UN Security Council after failing to convince the world that its nuclear ambitions are entirely peaceful. Tehran flatly denies trying to develop nuclear arms.

 Konstantin Kosachev, head of the foreign relations committee in Russias Duma, said the chances of an agreement were about 50-50.

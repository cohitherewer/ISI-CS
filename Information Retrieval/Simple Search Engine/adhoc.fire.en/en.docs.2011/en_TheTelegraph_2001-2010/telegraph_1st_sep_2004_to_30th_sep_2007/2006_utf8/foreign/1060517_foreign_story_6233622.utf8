 Elvis home

 Chicago, May 16 (Reuters): Psychic Uri Geller and two partners have bought the Tennessee house Elvis Presley lived in before moving to Graceland, with a winning bid of $905,100 on eBay, he said yesterday.

 We are unbelievably pleased. This is a piece of history, Geller said by phone from England. We intend to restore it to its old glory. We would like to bring sick children there (for tours), Palestinian children, Israeli children, American children, the Israeli-born Geller said. Hopefully one day we might get approval to turn it into a museum.

 Presley bought the four-bedroom, two-bath house at 1034 Audubon Drive in Memphis in 1956 with a down payment of $500. He lived there for 13 months before moving to Graceland, the now-famous Memphis estate where he died in 1977.

 During his time in the white, ranch-style house, Presleys career took off with hits such as All Shook Up and Dont be Cruel.

 Yechury: Rebel hope

 Kathmandu, Nov. 15: CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury today told Maoist chief Prachanda that the government in New Delhi plans to release Maoist rebels from Indian jails.

 Yechury, who arrived in Kathmandu this afternoon to witness the signing of the peace accord between the Maoist rebels and the Seven-Party Alliance tomorrow, told Prachanda that New Delhi has already started the process to release nearly 100 rebels currently in Indian jails. Among those who are likely to be released are top Maoist leaders C.P. Gajurel and Mohan Vaidya who are in Jalpaiguri and Siliguri jails respectively.

 Before meeting Prachanda, Yechuri told reporters at the Tribhuvan international airport that the Indian government was releasing the Maoists as the situation in Nepal has changed.

 The Nepali laws under which they were arrested do not exist anymore. All of them should be released within a week or so, he said, adding: There is a legal process involved. We have asked the Indian government to speed up the process. The West Bengal chief minister also informed me that the process has already been initiated.

 Use of force irks Saddam

 Baghdad, Feb. 13 (Reuters): Saddam Hussein returned to court today after a two-session boycott, launching at once into a tirade against the new chief judge and complaining his own presence at his trial had been enforced.

 In a resumption of chaotic hearings, two of his former senior aides told the chamber they were forced to appear as witnesses. One of them accused the chief prosecutor of being a former member of Saddams intelligence services, throwing a new twist into a troubled trial.

 Saddam, who condemns the court as an imperial creation of US military occupation, slammed his fist on the railing of his metal pen as he berated the chief judge.

 You dont have the right to sit on that chair because you are ignorant of the law, Saddam told judge Raouf Abdel Rahman, a slight man who appeared fed up with a barrage of verbal abuse. The court was later adjourned until tomorrow.

 The toppled Iraqi leader refused an offer of court-appointed lawyers to replace his defence team, which walked out of the court last month to protest against the tough new chief judge.

 Saddam has boycotted the last two hearings since he and several of his seven co-accused staged a walkout on January 29. The chief prosecutor signalled yesterday Saddam would be forced to attend.

 Saddam and his half-brother Barzan al-Tikriti quickly went into attack mode today. This is not a court, this is a game, said Saddam. 

 I was forced into the courtroom. Exercise your right and sentence me in absentia, he told the judge. The trial has already been marred by the resignation of the first chief judge and the killings of 2 lawyers.

 Microwave baby death

 China Arnold: Merciless

 Dayton, Nov. 29 (AP): A mother was arrested on suspicion of murdering her newborn daughter by microwaving the baby in an oven.

 China Arnold, 26, was jailed on Monday on a charge of aggravated murder, more than a year after she brought her dead month-old baby to a hospital. Bail was set yesterday at $1 million.

 We have reason to believe, and we have some forensic evidence that is consistent with our belief, that a microwave oven was used in this death, quot; said Ken Betz, director of the Montgomery county coroners office.

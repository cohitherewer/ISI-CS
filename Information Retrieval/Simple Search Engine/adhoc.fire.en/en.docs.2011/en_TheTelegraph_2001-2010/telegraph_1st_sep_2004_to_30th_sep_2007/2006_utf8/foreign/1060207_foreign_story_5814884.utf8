 Egg attack

 London, Feb. 6 (Reuters): Britains education secretary Ruth Kelly was hit on the head by an egg today which smashed on impact, splattering her hair with yolk.

 Greater Manchester Police said a 44-year man had been arrested after the attack outside a Stralford court.

 Kelly arrived at the court to give evidence against her alleged attacker after an incident during last years election when eggs were also thrown at her.

 Curio crash

 London (Reuters): A man who tripped, fell down a staircase and smashed into three ancient vases in a museum said it was just a regrettable accident. 

 I snagged my shoelace, missed the step and crash bang wallop, there was a million pieces of Qing ceramics beneath me, he said. There is no way my pocket will stretch to reimburse them.

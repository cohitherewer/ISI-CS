 Lohan anger

 Los Angeles, July 31 (AP): A studio executive was way out of line for scolding Lindsay Lohan for her absences from the set of her new movie, the teen actresss mother told the television programme Access Hollywood.

 Last week, James G. Robinson, CEO of Morgan Creek Productions, chided Lohan in a letter for her behaviour on a movie set and doubted her absence was related to heat exhaustion.

 Dina Lohan said the wording of the letter was ridiculous. I feel when you are 19 (years old) it is way out of line. Maybe he has personal issues with whomever and it came out with my child, she said. 

 Helena fan

 Hong Kong (AP): Supermodel Helena Christensen 

 comes from Denmark, lives in New York and loves Japan, a 

 Hong Kong magazine says. Christensen is a huge fan of the 

 Japanese, the magazine said. I love them, she 

 was quoted as saying. I love the whole culture, the 

 history, their graciousness. They are so cool and so eccentric. 

 They seem so sweet all the way through, and I am like: What 

 is really going on?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 UK police accused of Islamophobia

 AMIT ROY

 London, Aug. 7: Tarique Ghaffur, the senior Scotland Yard officer who last month offered to help Mumbai police with the latest forensic technology in an interview with The Telegraph, today mounted an extraordinary attack on his own colleagues, accusing them virtually of Islamophobia.

 In a major speech today, Ghaffur, assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, pressed the government to concede what Tony Blair has been resisting since the US/UK military invasion of Iraq a judicial review into the behaviour of angry young Muslims. Blair does not want such a review for fear it might show up his foreign policy as being one of the primary reasons why young British Muslims have engaged in acts of terrorism against their own country.

 One of the good qualities about a policeman like Ghaffur is that he focuses all his energy on being a policemen he would be baffled if it were suggested to him that he should, for example, waste his time on running for president of the MCC. And the press would ensure he didnt last too long in his job if he did.

 Ghaffur accepts his colleagues have a job to do in trying to tackle Islamic terrorism but he feels that the way they have gone about it, police have made more enemies than friends among British Muslims.

 He would certainly be against the kind of tactics that have been deployed by Mumbai police picking up hundreds of Muslims, questioning them and probably roughing up a few, then releasing most and perhaps holding a handful on non-terrorism related charges. Ghaffur quoted figures which showed that of the 701 people arrested under anti-terror laws between the 9/11 terror attacks and the end of 2004 in Britain, only 17 were convicted, of which only three related to Islamic terrorism.

 As the most senior Asian and Muslim officer in the land, Ghaffur, who arrived in Britain from East Africa, is feted at Indian and Pakistani parties where he has been showered with many honours and prizes.

 But today he allowed some of his bitterness at being blocked from higher office to show through. In a keynote speech to the National Black Police Association conference in Manchester, Ghaffur claimed: I have been deliberately excluded from groups, processes and decision-making on occasions. I have had creative ideas turned down, only for them to then be subsequently suggested by colleagues and accepted. quot;Ghaffur failed last year in his bid to become deputy commissioner at Scotland Yard, and before that was unsuccessful in applying to be chief constable of the next three biggest forces in England and Wales, namely Greater Manchester, West Yorkshire and West Midlands.

 Each process attracted unfair media attention, had no true level of independence and basically amounted to informal appraisal of me as an individual rather than a proper assessment of my experiences and competencies, he complained.

 On the attitudes of the young, he said: Young people have developed a strong sense of connection with Islam. The cumulative effect of Islamophobia, both internationally and nationally, linked to social exclusion, has created a generation of angry young people who are vulnerable to exploitation. The simplistic anti-western messages of extremist organisations can be attractive to such vulnerable young people.

 He continued: quot;We must think long and hard about the causal factors of anger and resentment. In particular, we need to adopt an evidence-based approach to building solutions. I therefore support those who are calling for an independent judicial review of the issue of young Muslims and extremism and the wider community dimension. quot;

 It is not known when Ghaffur cleared his speech with his boss, Sir Ian Blair, the Metropolitan police commissioner, who was asked to resign by many commentators after police shot dead an innocent man at Stockwell underground station last year.

 This year, police shot and injured one of two Muslim brothers whose homes in Forest Gate, east London, were raided. No evidence against them was found.

 Ghaffurs view is that police have not been able to understand a simple point: although all Islamic terrorists are, by definition, Muslim, all Muslims are not terrorists.

 quot;There is a very real danger that the counter-terrorism label is also being used by other law-enforcement agencies to the effect that there is a real risk of criminalising minority communities, quot; he warned. quot;The impact of this will be that just at the time we need the confidence and trust of these communities, they may retreat inside themselves. quot;

 He would point out that Muslims in Mumbai would be less willing to provide intelligence to police because of the way police have behaved with them. 

 He would argue much the same was happening in Britain.

 quot;The consequence of this type of wide-scale enforcement has been to create a strong feeling of mass stereotyping within the Muslim community and, in fact, the wider non-Muslim South Asian communities, quot; he said.

 It is certainly true that many Indians have been stopped because police cannot tell them apart from Pakistanis. 

 He commented: quot;Elements of the Muslim community have become intensely self-reflective, both in terms of individuals and communities. They remain inward looking and are still in survival mode, thinking and feeling victimised, disconnected and separated. I believe we are standing at a critical crossroad. The overriding objective must be to stop another terrorist bombing happening again. quot;

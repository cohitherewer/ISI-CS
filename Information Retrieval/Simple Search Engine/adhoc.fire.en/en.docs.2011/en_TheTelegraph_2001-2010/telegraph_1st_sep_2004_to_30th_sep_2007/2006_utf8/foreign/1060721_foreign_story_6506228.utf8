 Questions surface over blitz

 Jerusalem, July 20 (Reuters): We will win and Israel is strong are the messages on the latest bumper stickers in the blue and white colours of the Jewish state.

 Support for the war on Lebanons Hizbollah guerrillas remains firm in Israel, but questions are starting to surface over the effectiveness of a week-old blitz that has wrecked Lebanon and killed more than 300 people there.

 Despite the assault, Hizbollah is still firing deadly rockets into Israeli towns, still able to fight troops at the border and still holding the two Israeli soldiers whose abduction started the crisis.

 Hizbollah remains the same intransigent rival as before. It is showing no signs of breaking, wrote Amos Harel in Haaretz, a usually dovish paper that has generally backed the war.

 Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has vowed to keep fighting until he meets Israels goals of bringing home the hostages and ensuring that Hizbollah is disarmed under a UN resolution and removed as a threat to the northern border.

 The question is whether those aims can be achieved by bombing Lebanon or if Israel might have to either begin a major land war or find a way to back out. At a certain point, people are going to start wondering: Is air power enough?, said Cameron Brown of the Herzliya Interdisciplinary Center in Israel.

 There was a wave of optimism, but I think Israel is starting to become more sober in the appreciation of what it can do with each option. The only obvious military alternative to the air campaign is to send tanks into south Lebanon.

 Even if smaller than Israels 1982 invasion, it would inevitably bring casualties and tie troops down in the hilly terrain, ideal for guerrilla attacks, that Israel evacuated under fire six years ago.

 So far, incursions into south Lebanon have been close to the border and solely by special forces trying to destroy Hizbollah outposts. 

 Security sources say Israel is not at the invasion stage yet, but it knows time is limited before even the US joins pressure to curb air raids ? particularly as Lebanons civilian death toll grows and Israels outside image worsens.

 Supporters of the air campaign argue that it is hard to tell how much damage has been done. A cabinet minister estimated today it amounted to half of Hizbollahs capacity. 

 This is a three-week carefully detailed strategy. Its carefully planned, almost computerised, and were only one and a half weeks into it, said Gerald Steinberg of Israels Bar-Ilan University.

 Israels public still appears behind the idea of waging war, even if there is debate over the best way to do it.

 Support has only been strengthened by Hizbollah rocket fire that accounted for 15 of the 29 Israeli dead, though if the volume of Katyushas falling on Israel grows it could increase pressure for ground action.

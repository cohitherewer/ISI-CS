 Smoking ban debate touches raw nerve

 Berlin, June 26 (Reuters): When a German magazine ran a story about new efforts to ban public smoking, the reactions of many of its non-smoking readers was fierce ? and surprising.

 I dont want to be deprived of the relaxed company of smokers in restaurants and bars, wrote David Harnasch of Freiburg in a letter to Der Spiegel weekly. If my clothes stink of smoke, I can wash them ? where exactly is the problem?

 Yvonne Deim from Munich wrote: Sitting in a smoke-filled room for a few hours bothers me less than it would if smokers were forced to get up every few minutes to go smoke outside.

 Governments across Europe are cracking down on smoking in public places. But resistance to new limits is strong in Germany.

 Polls show a majority of the population and one in two non-smokers opposed a proposed ban on smoking in restaurants and bars. 

 Some politicians have said the proposals are too draconian, and Germanys powerful cigarette, restaurant and hotel lobbies are working to ensure they never see the light of day.

 Der Spiegel made it clear where it stood by putting a picture of a broken cigarette on its cover alongside the title Smoking ? The End of Tolerance.

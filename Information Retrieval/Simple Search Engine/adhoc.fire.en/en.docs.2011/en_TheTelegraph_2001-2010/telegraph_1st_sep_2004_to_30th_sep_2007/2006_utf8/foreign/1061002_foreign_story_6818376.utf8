 Tenor book

 New York, Oct. 1 (Reuters): Placido Domingo is writing The Joy of Opera, a book to be published in 2009, in which the renowned tenor will offer insights into masterpieces and what makes a singer great.

 New York publisher W.W. Norton said it had acquired worldwide rights to the book, which it said will reveal how opera works on both sides of the curtain and how it is best experienced and savoured.

 Opera for so many people remains a mystery, a curious and strange art form when it really should be much more a part of our everyday lives, Domingo writes in the book, Norton said in a statement.

 Domingo, 65, is general director of the Los Angeles Opera and the Washington National Opera and continues to perform and conduct.

 War cloud on Lanka

 Colombo, Sept. 10 (Reuters): Sri Lankas army today said 28 soldiers and dozens of Tamil Tigers had been killed in their advance across frontlines in the islands far north, as the rebels accused them of shattering what is left of a 2002 truce.

 The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam said fighting continued to rage in no-mans land this morning. They said six fighters had died since the offensive in the northern Jaffna peninsula began on Friday.

 We have destroyed the bunkers of the LTTE, said army spokesman Brigadier Prasad Samarasinghe. It was a successful operation and at the moment we are consolidating the area.

 He said 28 soldiers had been killed and 119 injured, while the defence ministry said it believed at least 60 rebels had died.

 Hundreds of civilians, troops and Tiger fighters have been killed since Sri Lankas two-decade civil war re-erupted in late July, and more than 200,000 people have fled to refugee camps across the islands rural northeast.

 The Tigers have threatened to retaliate with all their might if government offensives continue.

 The Sri Lankan government have declared war against the LTTE by doing offensive attacks, S. Puleedevan, head of the Tigers peace secretariat, said. By their actions, they are killing the ceasefire agreement.

 The army blames the LTTE for starting the latest fighting by firing shells and rocket-propelled grenades at their frontline positions in the Muhamalai area of the besieged Jaffna peninsula cut off from the rest of the island by rebel territory and where food is running desperately short for around 500,000 residents.

 The military responded with artillery and air strikes before advancing around 600 metres across the heavily mined frontline on Friday to capture rebel bunkers.

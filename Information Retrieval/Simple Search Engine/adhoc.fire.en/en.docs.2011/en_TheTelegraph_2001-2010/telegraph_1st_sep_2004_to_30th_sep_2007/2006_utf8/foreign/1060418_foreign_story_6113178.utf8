 Iraq shows whos top gun

 Kalashnikov poses with guns bearing his 

name; A soldier with M-16 in Iraq 

 Moscow, April 17 (Reuters): Mikhail Kalashnikov, designer of the worlds most popular assault rifle, says that US soldiers in Iraq are using his invention in preference to their own weapons, proving that his gun is still the best.

 Even after lying in a swamp you can pick up this rifle, aim it and shoot. Thats the best job description there is for a gun. Real soldiers know that and understand it, the 86-year-old gunmaker told a weekend news conference in Moscow.

 In Vietnam, American soldiers threw away their M-16 rifles and used (Kalashnikov) AK-47s from dead Vietnamese soldiers, with bullets they captured. That was because the climate is different to America, where M-16s may work properly, he said.

 Look whats happening now: every day on television we see that the Americans in Iraq have my machine guns and assault rifles in their armoured vehicles. Even there American rifles dont work properly.

 Some US troops in Iraq have reportedly taken to using AK-47s in preference to the standard-issue M-16. The Cold War-era gun, renowned for its durability and easy handling, is plentiful in Iraq.

 Kalashnikov designed his first weapon in 1947 and is still chief constructor at Izhmash arms factory in Izhevsk in the Urals mountains.

 The factorys director said that around a billion rifles had been produced around the world using parts of Kalashnikovs or based on the same design, only 10-12 per cent of which were made in Russia.

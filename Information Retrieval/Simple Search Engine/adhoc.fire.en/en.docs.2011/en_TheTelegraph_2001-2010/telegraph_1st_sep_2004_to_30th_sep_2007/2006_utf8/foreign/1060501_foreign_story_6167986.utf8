 A jet for decor

 Beijing, April 30 (AP): A Chinese businessman has bought a MiG-21f plane from a US seller on the online auction site eBay for $24,730 and plans to use it to decorate an empty space at his office. 

 I like to collect valuable items. I have the buying power and my company has an empty space where I can display the plane, The Beijing News today quoted Zhang Cheng as saying. 

 The eBay site shows the plane is currently located in Lewiston, Idaho. It said the fighter jet, last flown in 1995, has been inspected by a museum and found to be in excellent condition. 

 There is the precedent of a Chinese company buying a retired aircraft carrier, but I dont know if this jet plane is a banned item, Zhang reportedly said.

 Tower bday

 New York (AP): The Empire State Building, once the tallest 

in the world, is turning 75 on Monday. 

 Like Londons Crystal Palace and the Eiffel Tower in Paris, the Empire State Building represented in its time what we were capable of, says Carol Willis, an architectural historian and founder-director of the Skyscraper Museum in lower Manhattan. Construction of the Empire State Building took only 410 days ? by 3,400 workers. 

 The 1,454-foot tower opened on May 1, 1931. Its 102 floors are topped by a 200-foot tower. 

 It was the worlds tallest edifice until it was surpassed in 1972 by the World Trade Center; it again became the citys tallest after the 9/11 attacks. It is now the ninth tallest in the world and second in the US, behind Chicagos Sears Tower.

 Cruz trying not to get affected by Oscar buzz

 - Lets not think about it

 Penelope Cruz is fully aware of the Oscar talk for her performance in Volver, and she is tuning it out.

 The film unites her for a third time with master director Pedro Almodovar, a fellow Spaniard she describes as family and for whom she has served as an inspiring muse. In Live Flesh (1997), she played a prostitute who gives birth on a bus. In All About My Mother (1999), she played a pregnant nun with AIDS. 

 Now, in Volver, Cruz stars as Raimunda, a working-class wife and mother who deals with everything from whipping up an impromptu lunch for 30 people to stashing away the bloody body of a stabbing victim. She must confront her complex past and re-establish herself, on her own, in the present.

 Shes earthy, sexy, funny and incredibly volatile; its the performance of her long and varied career. And the buzz is there, whether she wants to hear it or not. Its exciting and flattering but I also feel that its healthier not to expect it, Cruz said while lounging on a couch in her airy, Hollywood Hills home.

 But I would be lying if I didnt tell you its exciting, all the things that Im hearing in a movie that I did with Pedro, who is one of my favourite people in the world, she added. Weve gone through this together and we always look at each other when somebody comes and shows us something Look, look at this we look at each other and say: Lets not think about it. 

 Until now, much of the press in the US about the 32-year-old actress has focused on her high-profile romances with Tom Cruise, whom she was involved with for three years after meeting on the set of Vanilla Sky (2001), and Matthew McConaughey, her co-star in Sahara (2005).

 Her beauty, which made her the face of Ralph Lauren for several years, also has made her a favourite topic. And the reviews for her work in English-language films have not been nearly as strong as those in her native Spanish.

 Back in her comfort zone in Volver, though in a role she says is her most challenging ever, shes getting nothing but raves. But just as she deals with awards talk, shes learned not to let reviews affect her after working as an actress for the past 17 years. I know what it is to be on both sides when things are going good or when people are attacking you. I know both things, she said.

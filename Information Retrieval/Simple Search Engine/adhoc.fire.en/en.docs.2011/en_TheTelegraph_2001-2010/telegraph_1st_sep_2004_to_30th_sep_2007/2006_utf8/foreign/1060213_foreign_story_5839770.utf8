 In Japan, Feb 14s all about gifting herself

 All for myself

 Tokyo, Feb. 12 (Reuters): It used to be Japanese women gave men a gift of chocolates on Valentines Day.

 These days, theyre more likely to buy pricey chocolates costing up to $200 a box as a treat for themselves.

 Its a small luxury that I allow myself, said 39-year-old Reiko Nozawa, who buys champagne truffles for herself and a few other chocolates to share with her husband.

 Nozawa is not alone.

 Makers of 60 premium chocolate brands have set up special booths at Takashimaya Co, a department store in central Tokyo, where boxes of chocolates costing as much as $84-$168 are selling briskly, helped by Japans economic recovery.

 Theres been a trend the past two or three years for women to buy chocolates for themselves, as a sort of pat on the back for having worked hard, said Takashimaya spokeswoman Yoko Yanagisawa.

 That can be on top of what they spend on others.

 I think Ill buy some premium chocolates for myself, said Yoshiko Okajima, a fashionably attired working mother, as she checked out chocolates for herself after spending 7,000 yen on her husband and 8-year-old son.

 Tokyo is filled with Valentine Day chocolate adverts in the days leading up to February 14, and some manufacturers rake in about 20-30 per cent of their annual sales in a few short weeks.

 Until recently, most Japanese women bought cellophane-wrapped sweets in bulk from drugstores to give to colleagues or school friends as an obligatory chocolate on Valentines Day.

 A month later on White Day men return it by giving women gifts ? usually sweets but sometimes lingerie.

 Confectionary maker Morozoff Ltd is widely credited with having introduced Valentines Day to Japan in a 1936 advertisement for chocolates.

 If wed been a florist, no doubt we would have tried to sell flowers, Morozoff spokesman Kazuo Kojima said.

 Some two decades later, Mary Chocolate Co Ltd used Valentines Day as a sales promotion for its chocolates, in what is believed to be the first such commercial endeavour. The company only sold three chocolate bars during the three-day event in February 1958. Total sales ? 150 yen.

 Almost a half-century later, Japans Valentine Day chocolate sales have blossomed into a 50-billion-yen market.

 Upscale chocolate boutiques have sprouted up all over Tokyo, to cash in on increasingly sophisticated palates.

 At Belgium-based Pierre Marcolini in Tokyos trendy Ginza district a steady flow of customers peer at ribboned gift boxes in a glass display.

 Customers are ushered in by a young woman whose task is to ensure the softly-lit, modest-sized store doesnt get too cramped.

 It is pretty expensive, but I think they are worth the price and I like them, said a 36-year-old school teacher carrying a sweet-filled bag marked with the stores logo.

 Such consumers are likely to help Japans market for chocolate sweets, some 235,487 tonnes in 2004-05, and cocoa, roughly 56,634 tonnes, grow at a modest pace, said Kenji Kaminaga, executive director of the Chocolate amp; Cocoa Association of Japan.

 I think sales of premium chocolates are definitely helping to support the market, Kaminaga said.

 Premium chocolates are often imported from Belgium and France, with imports worth 36.8 billion yen in 2004-05, up about 36 per cent from a decade ago.

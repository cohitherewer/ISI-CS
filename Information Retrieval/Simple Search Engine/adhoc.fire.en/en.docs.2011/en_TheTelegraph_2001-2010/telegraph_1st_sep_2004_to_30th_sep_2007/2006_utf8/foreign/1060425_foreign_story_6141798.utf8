 Israel fears

 Tel Aviv, April 24 (Reuters): Israeli defence minister Shaul Mofaz said today that the nuclear programme being pursued by arch-foe Iran was the most serious threat faced by Jews since the Nazi Holocaust.

 Iran says it seeks nuclear energy, not bombs, but calls by its President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad for the elimination of Israel have stoked tensions. Israel has so far backed US-led efforts to curb Irans nuclear programme through possible sanctions.

 Of all the threats we face, Iran is the biggest. The world must not wait. It must do everything necessary on a diplomatic level in order to stop its nuclear activity, Mofaz told a conference on Iran at Tel Aviv University.

 Since Hitler we have not faced such a threat, he added.

 Founded partly as a haven for survivors of the German genocide of the Jews during World War II, Israel is believed to have West Asias only atomic arsenal. 

 Tomorrow is Holocaust Remembrance Day in the Jewish state.

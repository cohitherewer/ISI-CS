 Malaysia PM to pay traffic fines

 Kuala Lumpur, June 11 (PTI): Malaysian Prime Minister Datuk Seri Abdullah Ahmad Badawi would pay the penalties for the 11 traffic summonses faced by him, a media report said today. 

 Badawi said he did not know about the summonses until he was informed by the deputy inspector general of police, Tan Sri Musa Hassan yesterday, the Sunday Star newspaper said.

 I was just informed by Musa. I did not know about them. The last time I had summonses, I paid them all. Thank you for letting me know.

 I will find out who were driving the cars on those days, the report said, quoting Badawi.

 He said he would pay the penalties for the fresh summons tomorrow.

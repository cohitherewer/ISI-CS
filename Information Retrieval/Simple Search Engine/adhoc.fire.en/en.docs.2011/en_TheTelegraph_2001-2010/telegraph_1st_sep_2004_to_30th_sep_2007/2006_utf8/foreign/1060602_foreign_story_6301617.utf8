 We may not be fully human

 Washington, June 1 (Reuters): We may not be entirely human, gene experts said today after studying the DNA of hundreds of different kinds of bacteria in the human gut.

 Bacteria are so important to key functions such as digestion and the immune system that we may be truly symbiotic organisms ? relying on one another for life itself, the scientists write in tomorrows issue of the journal Science.

 Their findings suggest that studying bacteria native to our bodies may provide important clues to disease, nutrition, obesity and how well drugs will work in individuals, said the team at The Institute for Genomic Research, commonly known as TIGR, in Maryland.

 We are somehow like an amalgam, a mix of bacteria and human cells. There are some estimates that say 90 per cent of the cells on our body are actually bacteria, Steven Gill, a molecular biologist, said.

 Scientists have long known that at least 50 per cent of human faeces, and often more, is made up of bacteria from the gut. 

 Bacteria start to colonise the intestines and colon shortly after birth, and adults carry up to 100 trillion microbes, representing more than 1,000 different species.

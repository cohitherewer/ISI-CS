 Iran leader heckled

 Tehran, Dec. 11 (Reuters): Dozens of Iranian students burned pictures of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and threw firecrackers in an effort to disrupt his speech at a university today, a presidential office spokesman said.

 It was first time the President, elected in a landslide in June 2005, had faced such open hostility at a public event. But the spokesman said Ahmadinejad was not deterred and completed his address at Tehrans Amir Kabir University.

 While he was speaking today they tried to interrupt but they couldnt and they even burned his pictures while he was speaking and they threw firecrackers but Ahmadinejad continued his speech, the spokesman said.

 He said 50 to 60 students were involved and confirmed local news agency reports they had chanted Death to the dictator and that scuffles had broken out between pro- and anti-Ahmadinejad students at the event. The ISNA students news agency said Ahmadinejad had responded to the burning of his pictures by saying: Everyone should know that Ahmadinejad is prepared to be burned in the path of true freedom, independence and justice.

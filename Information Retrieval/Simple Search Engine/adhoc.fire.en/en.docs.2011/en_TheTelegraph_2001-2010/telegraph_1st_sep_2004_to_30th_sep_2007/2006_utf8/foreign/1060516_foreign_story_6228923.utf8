 Strip for a prize

 Dublin, May 15 (Reuters): Ireland will play host to the worlds biggest ever strip poker contest if bookmaker Paddy Power gets its way.

 The idea was originally floated as an April Fools joke but generated so much interest that Dublin-based Paddy Power has decided to look seriously at organising a contest it hopes will find a place in the Guinness Book of Records. We got almost 100 requests to take part, the companys spokesman, also called Paddy Power, said. 

 Mobile love ends marriage

 Kuala Lumpur (Reuters): A Malaysian man slapped his wife 

on their wedding night and stormed out of their home after she received a text 

message from an unknown admirer who professed his undying love for her. Though 

you are married, I still love you, was the message that flashed on the screen 

of the 19-year-old womans mobile phone just as the couple were about to 

enter their room at 2 am on Sunday. Her husband, 25, refused to believe the womans 

statement that she did not know who the sender was, hit her, tossed away the phone 

and walked out of the house.

The mans mouth opened in horror as the camera cut to him in the BBC studio, where he had been seated on a stool by a floor manager, a microphone clipped to his lapel.

 Pak poet snub

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Islamabad, Aug 1: One of Pakistans greatest Urdu poets, Ahmed Faraz, returned a top civilian award to protest against the policies of President Pervez Musharraf.

 I have returned the award because of the governments polices against the people of Waziristan and Baluchistan, he said.

 Faraz said he returned the Hilal-e-Imtiaz award (the Crescent Moon honour) because Musharraf had reneged on his pledge to give up his position as head of the armed forces.

 I cannot keep this award because the man who is heading the state lied to the people that he would remove his uniform in December 2004, Faraz said.

 Revered as the greatest living Urdu poet, Faraz, 75, said he was angered by the army operations in Waziristan and southwestern Baluchistan. The army has been fighting against pro-Taliban tribesmen in Waziristan and against ethnic Baluch tribesmen in revolt in the southwest. I am not against the armed forces, but the generals. They are not supposed to rule the country, they lost half the country in 1971, he said in reference to the creation of Bangladesh.

 Faraz was jailed and sent into exile by General Zia-ul-Haq for composing poems against the military ruler.

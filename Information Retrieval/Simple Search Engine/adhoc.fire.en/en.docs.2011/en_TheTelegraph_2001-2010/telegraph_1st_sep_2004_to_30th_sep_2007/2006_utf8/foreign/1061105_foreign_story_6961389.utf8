 Iraq alert ahead of verdict

 Baghdad, Nov. 4 (Reuters): Iraqi security forces were on alert and a curfew was expected to keep Baghdad locked down tomorrow when Saddam Hussein hears the verdict in his trial for crimes against humanity.

 If convicted, the ousted Iraqi President could be sentenced to hang.

 Saddams chief lawyer Khalil al-Dulaimi said yesterday Saddam believed the verdict was timed to boost President George W. Bush before US mid-term elections on November 7, and urged a delay. He warned of bloodshed if Saddam is sentenced to death.

 National Security Adviser Mowaffak al-Rubaie told local television stations a curfew would be imposed in Baghdad and the provinces of Diyala and Salahaddin, Saddams home province.

 Iraqiya state television said there would be a curfew tomorrow and Baghdad airport would be closed, but another senior official said others in the government were against a curfew, and a decision would be taken later today.

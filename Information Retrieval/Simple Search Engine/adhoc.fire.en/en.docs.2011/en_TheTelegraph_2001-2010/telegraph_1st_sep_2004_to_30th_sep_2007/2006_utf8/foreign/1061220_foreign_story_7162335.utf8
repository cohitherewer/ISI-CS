 Miss USA gets another chance

 Tara Conner: Keeps crown

 New York, Dec. 19 (AP): Miss USA Tara Conner, who had come under criticism amid rumours she had been frequenting bars while underage, will be allowed to keep her title, real estate mogul Donald Trump announced today.

 Ive always been a believer in second chances, Trump, who owns the Miss Universe organisation with the NBC television network, said with Conner at his side.

 Trump said he and Conner had met earlier this morning. She left a small town in Kentucky and she was telling me that she got caught up in the whirlwind of New York, Trump said. Its a story that has happened many times before to many women and many men who came to the Big Apple. They wanted their slice of the Big Apple and they found out it wasnt so easy.

 Conner won the title in April and has been living in New York. 

 Recent media accounts of heavy drinking brought a storm of criticism, since she was underage at the time. She turned 21, the legal drinking age in New York state, yesterday.

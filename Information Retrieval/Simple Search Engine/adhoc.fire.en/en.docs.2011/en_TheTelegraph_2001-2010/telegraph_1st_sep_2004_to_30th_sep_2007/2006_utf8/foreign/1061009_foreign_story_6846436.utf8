 World Briefs

 Korea N-date 

 Beijing, Oct. 8 (Reuters): North Korea may bring the date of a planned nuclear test forward after Chinas UN envoys remarks angered it. 

 US envoy John Bolton said that while Britain, France and Japan had made clear a strong statement was needed to warn Pyongyang against testing, he was not certain what North Koreas protectors on the (UN Security) Council are going to do. 

 Chinese ambassador Wang Guangya said: I think for bad behaviour in this world no one is going to protect them. 

 Japan thaw 

 Beijing (Reuters): China hailed a visit by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Sunday as a turning point in relations as they agreed to upgrade ties. Chinese leaders also agreed to an invitation from Abe to visit Japan. 

 Nepal talks 

 Kathmandu (Reuters): Nepals Maoist rebels and the interim government said their first meeting in four months on Sunday was highly positive. The talks will resume on Tuesday. 

 French puff 

 Paris (Reuters): France will ban smoking in most public places from February 1, 2007, and in bars, restaurants, hotels and discotheques less than a year later.

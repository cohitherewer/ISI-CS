 Wonder words

The voting began on November 20 and concludes on December 4, Arthur Bicknell, a spokesman for the Springfield, Massachusetts-based company, said in a telephone interview.

 Weve been getting literally thousands of submissions, he said.

 Pam split 

 Los Angeles (AP): Pamela Anderson and rapper Kid Rock each filed divorce papers on Monday, seeking to end their marriage of less than four months. Andersons representative would not comment on any particulars of the divorce. Anderson and Rock, whose real name is Robert Ritchie, cited irreconcilable differences in their divorce filings in a Los Angeles court. Yes, its true, Anderson wrote in a brief statement on her website. Unfortunately impossible.

 Wrong turn

Trains were suspended after security cameras clocked the disoriented driver sailing past a station through the railway tunnels.

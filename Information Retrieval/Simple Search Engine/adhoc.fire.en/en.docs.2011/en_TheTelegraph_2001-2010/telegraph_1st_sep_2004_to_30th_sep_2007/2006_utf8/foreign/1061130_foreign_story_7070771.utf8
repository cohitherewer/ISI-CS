 Dhaka govt building under siege 

 Dhaka, Nov. 29 (Reuters): Political activists seeking the removal of election officials surrounded Bangladeshs main administrative secretariat in Dhaka today, as a UN envoy flew in to assess the situation ahead of elections in January.

 Witnesses said activists of a multi-party alliance led by Sheikh Hasina, chief of the Awami League, choked streets leading to the secretariat, preventing officials from going in or out.

 Its a total gherao of the secretariat, one witness said, adding that authorities deployed hundreds of riot police to try to prevent violence.

 Violence has swept the impoverished South Asian country in the run up to the election set for January 21.

 Craig Jenness, director of the UN Electoral Assistance Division, arrived in Dhaka today for a three-day visit to assess the situation before the poll and prepare a report for secretary-general Kofi Annan.

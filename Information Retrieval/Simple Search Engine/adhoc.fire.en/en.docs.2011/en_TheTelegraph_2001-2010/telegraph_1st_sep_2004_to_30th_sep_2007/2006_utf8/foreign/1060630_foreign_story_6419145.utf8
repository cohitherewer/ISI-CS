 Pak hangs 4 men for gangraping 14-year-old Christian girl

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Islamabad, June 29: Four Pakistani men were hanged today in Punjab province for gangraping a Christian girl at gunpoint during a 1999 robbery.

 President Pervez Musharraf and the countrys superior courts had rejected the mercy petitions of Omar Hayat, Mubarik Ali, Muhammad Ashraf and Shehzad Ahmed for the rape of the 14-year-old girl. The men had also robbed the family of 60,000 rupees ($1,000).

 The men, who are between 28 and 34 years old, were hanged in Faisalabads central prison at 4.30 am (local time) after a last meeting with their relatives, prison superintendent Yousaf Ghauri said. Faisalabad is 300 km from Multan, the main city in the eastern Punjab province.

 An anti-terrorist court convicted them to death within one month of the rape. 

 The victims family did not attend the executions, Ghauri said. Her father had told the court that the four men took turns in raping his daughter inside his home and threatened to kill him if he raised alarm, Ghauri said. Christians form a small minority in overwhelmingly Muslim Pakistan.

 The hangings come during a countrywide debate on the Islamic Hudood law which was introduced by former military dictator General Zia-ul-Haq to gather support from religious groups.

 According to the law, a rape victim must produce four witnesses to her ordeal to convict the rapists. 

 In most cases, this allows the rapists to escape punishment.

 While some radical religious groups oppose repeal of the law and call efforts in this direction anti-Islamic, leading human rights groups and Opposition parties have demanded that the law be scrapped. 

 According to the independent Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, over 200 women were raped in Pakistan last year. The National Commission on Status of Women has also called for the repeal of the Hudood ordinance.

 Amnesty International, which opposes the death penalty, says 241 persons were sentenced to death in Pakistan during 2005, and 32 people were executed.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Collective groan over goodwill bandwagon

 Paltrow

 London/Mphandula, Malawi, Aug. 27 (Reuters): Madonna feels responsible for the children of the world and has found herself a big, big project to help orphans in Malawi.

 Gwyneth Paltrow declares I am African in a new advertisement for a charity working in Africa.

 The continent has long been a favourite destination for celebrity campaigners, going back to 1954 when Danny Kaye became Unicefs goodwill ambassador.

 U2s Bono and fellow Irish rocker Bob Geldof are Africa veterans, and more recently Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie have brought Hollywood gloss to the continent.

 But the latest flood of stars searching for a good cause has prompted a collective groan in the media and among bloggers, as people question their methods and motives.

 Madonna

 We are on the verge of farcical at this point, said Michael Wolff, columnist for Vanity Fair, when asked about Africas popularity among famous performers. This has become just a part of the public relations play book. Everybody has a PR person and every PR person says which country do you want to adopt?.

 Aid groups hit back, blaming the media for creating the cult of celebrity in the first place and arguing that by discouraging stars from adopting good causes they are endangering vulnerable peoples lives.

 Madonnas charity plans were announced in an interview with Time magazine, which itself pointed out that for someone who has never been to Africa the whole enterprise has the pungent aroma of a coordinated act of publicity.

 The fact that orphans at a planned care centre in Malawi will be taught a curriculum based on Spirituality For Kids, a group linked to the Kabbalah school of mysticism to which Madonna adheres, could add to the cynicism.

 But to people in Mphandula, where the centre is to be built, such arguments are unimportant.

 All I know is that she is 

 rich and a very compassionate mother. She is our mother 

 now, said village headman Mphandula, who had never 

 heard of Madonna. It is a gift from God.

 Paltrows appearance in African beads and with painted stripes on her cheek above the words I Am African drew online blogs of derision. Right Gwynnie. And Im Martian, said one.

 Michael Musto, celebrity columnist for the Village Voice, said: The Gwyneth thing was kind of laughable. So many celebrities are jumping on the Africa bandwagon, like they descend on a hot restaurant because its cool.

 But Leigh Blake, founder of AIDS charity Keep A Child Alive (www.keepachildalive.org) for which Paltrow appeared, reacted angrily to what she said was damaging cynicism. From my perspective I can assure you there are hundreds of thousands alive today because of the work of all these celebrities, she said.

 They (media commentators) cant imagine for one second that these people they dehumanise actually care about poor people.

 The truth is, the media created this monster (of celebrity) and we in the world of charity are forced to use it.

 Blake said the media had an important role to play in helping charities raise awareness and funds, but should beware of attacking celebrities with a cause. Dont put off the artistes we can get on board, she said.

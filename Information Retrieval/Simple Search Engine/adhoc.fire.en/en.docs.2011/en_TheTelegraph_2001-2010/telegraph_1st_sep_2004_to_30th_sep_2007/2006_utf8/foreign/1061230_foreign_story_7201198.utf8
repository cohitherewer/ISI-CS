 Saudi cleric calls Shias infidels

 Dubai, Dec. 29 (Reuters): An influential cleric of Saudi Arabias hardline Sunni school of Islam has denounced Shias as infidels in a new religious edict that comes amid rising sectarian tension in the region.

 The rejectionists (Shias) in their entirety are the worst of the Islamic nations sects. They bear all the characteristics of infidels, Sheikh Abdel-Rahman al-Barrak said in the fatwa distributed on Islamist websites.

 They are in truth polytheist infidels, though they hide this, it said, citing theological differences 14 centuries after the death of Prophet Mohammad, such as reverence of shrines which followers of Saudi Arabias Wahhabi school consider abhorrent. Concern is growing in Saudi Arabia over Shia-Sunni violence in Iraq and Lebanon.

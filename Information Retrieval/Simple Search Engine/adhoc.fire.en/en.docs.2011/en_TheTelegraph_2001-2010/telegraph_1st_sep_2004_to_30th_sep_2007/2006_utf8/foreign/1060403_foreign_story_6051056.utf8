 Smoker Crowe

 Wellington, April 2 (AFP): Oscar winner Russell Crowe has fallen foul of New Zealands anti-smoking laws by lighting up during a recent concert in Auckland with his band, The Ordinary Fear of God, a newspaper reported.

Crowe smoked cigarettes after each song and sometimes during songs 

in breach of New Zealands smoke-free environment act, which banned smoking 

in workplaces and bars, The Herald on Sunday said. 

 Action on Smoking and Health director Becky Freeman told the newspaper she was shocked the actor was smoking inside. So hes above the law because hes a celebrity or something? Just because youre Russell Crowe doesnt mean you can do whatever you like.

 Crowes smoking habit contrasts with the anti-tobacco movie, The Insider, for which he was nominated for an Academy Award for his role as Jeffrey Wigand, who blew the whistle on US tobacco companies. 

 Soccer bait

 Lagos (Reuters): Football referees in Nigeria can take bribes 

from clubs but should not allow them to influence their decisions on the pitch, 

a football official said. Fanny Amun, chief of the Nigerian Football Association, 

said bribery was common in the Nigerian game. We know match officials are 

offered money or anything to influence matches and they can accept it.... But 

they should only pretend to fall for the bait, but make sure the result doesnt 

favour those offering the bribe, he said.

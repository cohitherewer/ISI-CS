 Berlusconi film before ballot

 Rome, March 24 (Reuters): 

 Italian director Nanni Moretti brings Silvio Berlusconi 

 to the big screen in The Cayman, a bitter-sweet critique 

 of the tycoon-turned-politician but also of those who demonise 

 him.

 The Cayman hits the screens in Italy today, just two weeks before an April 9-10 election which opinion polls say the Prime Ministers Centre-Right bloc is likely to lose. Its release has been hotly anticipated in Italy, both because of the proximity to the ballot and the mystery which has surrounded its contents ? actors were sworn to secrecy by contract.

 The Cayman ? a reptile resembling a crocodile, and the nickname given to Berlusconi by the Left-wing press ? tells the story of a B-movie producer and a young woman film director who want to make a film about the Premier but cannot find an actor daring enough to play it.

 When the sole aspirant to the role backs out at the last minute the project falls apart, but the producer manages to put together enough money to shoot just one scene: the conviction of Berlusconi, impersonated by Moretti, in a corruption trial. The film marks a return to politics for diehard Leftist Moretti, one of Italys best known directors. It contains excerpts of controversial speeches given by the real Berlusconi. 

 But The Cayman, Morettis first film since his intimate drama The Sons Room won the Palme DOr top prize at the Cannes festival in 2001, also takes a more subtle swipe at those who portray Berlusconi as the cause of all of Italys woes. In one scene, Moretti at first turns down a proposal to play the Prime Minister in the highly critical film the passionate young director wants to make. Everything has already been said. And its what the Left wants to hear, he tells her. Hes blaming the Left for being obsessed with Berlusconi, said film critic Piera Detassis after a press screening.

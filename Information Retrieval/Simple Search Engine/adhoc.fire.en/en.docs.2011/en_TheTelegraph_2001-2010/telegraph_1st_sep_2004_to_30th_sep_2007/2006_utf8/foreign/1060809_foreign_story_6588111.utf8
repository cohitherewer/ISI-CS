 Scan evidence

 Washington, Aug. 8 (Reuters): Ultrasound disrupts the brain development of unborn mice, US researchers said in a study published yesterday that adds to growing evidence that too many ultrasound scans could also affect human fetuses.

 Prolonged ultrasound scans of the brains of fetal mice interfered with a process known as neuronal migration in which neurons move from one place to another, the team at Yale University in Connecticut reported.

 Proper migration of neurons during development is essential for normal development of the cerebral cortex and its function, Dr Pasko Rakic, chair of the Department of Neurobiology at Yale, said.

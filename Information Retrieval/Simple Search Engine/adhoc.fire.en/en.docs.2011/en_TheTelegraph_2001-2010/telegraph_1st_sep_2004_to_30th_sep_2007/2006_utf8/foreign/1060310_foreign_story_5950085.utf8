 Ex-teacher takes pupils hostage

 Nantes (France), March 9 (Reuters): An unemployed teacher armed with a gun took 20 pupils and three adults hostage at a school in western France today, demanding to talk to the media about his job problems, local officials said.

 Police surrounded the secondary school in the town of Sable-sur-Sarthe where the 33-year-old man barricaded the pupils aged 17 to 18, a teacher and two other adults into a classroom.

 The hostage-taker was a supply teacher who had worked at the Colbert de Torcy school but had been unable to find a job for the past two years, the town authorities said. 

 The man wants to talk to the press about his job problems, said Dominique Dezecot, an official said. We are hopeful (it will end well) but we are worried, Bernadette Mercier, a school employee, told LCI television.

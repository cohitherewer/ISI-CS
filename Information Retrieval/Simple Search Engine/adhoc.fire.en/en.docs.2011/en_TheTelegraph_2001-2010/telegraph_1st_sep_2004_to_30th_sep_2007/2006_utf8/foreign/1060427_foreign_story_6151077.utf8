 Cruise still boxoffice gold in Hollywood

 Los Angeles, April 26 (AP): He can hop on couches, denounce psychiatry and pooh-pooh postpartum depression ? and his supernova Hollywood heat doesnt cool a whit.

 Tom Cruise has been box-office gold since his first starring role in 1983s Risky Business. His 23rd starring vehicle, Mission: Impossible III, opening next week, is a lock to add to that lustre.

 Cruise isnt just a major movie star. Hes mastered the elusive art of staying hot in Hollywood. Its a difficult achievement.

 Stars have to stay in the public eye, experts say, but not to the point of overexposure. They have to choose unexpected roles, but not so unexpected that they alienate fans. They need to reveal parts of their off-screen personality, but not so much (at least in most cases) that they seem freakish or out of touch.

 Its easy to become an overnight star today, says veteran talent manager Bernie Brillstein. 

 The toughest thing is keeping stardom.

 Those who should know dont agree about how to do that. Some say positive publicity is key, others say its all about picking the right films. Some say talent matters, others insist its all about marketing.

 Talent and role choice are most important, says Peter Bart, editor of Variety, the Hollywood trade paper. You can have tremendous publicity, but if you make one lousy movie after another, youre not going to get your price.

 And an actors salary, he says, is more important than sex. Sometimes, though, an actor agreeing to a lesser salary can be an excellent move toward enduring stardom.

 Though Cruise is known for his big-budget action films, his role in 1999s Magnolia was perfect for showing off his acting chops, says Anne Thompson, deputy film editor for the trade paper The Hollywood Reporter.

 Its not about the money or the marquee, she says. Its about stretching and showing what he can do. Hes keeping his eye on both things, and all the good, successful actors do that.

 George Clooney is another performer who amplified his star power with a combination of roles in movies large and small, Thompson says. 

 He recognises that the big payday is less important than creating and doing work that will stand the test of time, she says. He has to do the big commercial films like Oceans Eleven, but he certainly came out ahead with smaller films that were really very risky to make.

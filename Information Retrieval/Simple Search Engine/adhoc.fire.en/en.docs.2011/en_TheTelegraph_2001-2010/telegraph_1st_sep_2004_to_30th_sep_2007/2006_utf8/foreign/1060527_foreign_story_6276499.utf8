 Outcry stops Mao auction

 Beijing, May 26 (Reuters): Mao Zedong will be spared the capitalist indignity of the auctioneers hammer.

 The original model for the Mao painting that hung above Tiananmen Square was to be auctioned on June 3 and had been expected to fetch as much as 1.2 million yuan ($150,000). However, the painting has been taken off the block after a public outcry. 

 The decision was made according to the views of relevant government authorities, Beijing Huachen Auctions said in a brief notice on its website.

 The portrait was owned by a Chinese American and painted by artist Zhang Zhenshi, who was among more than 30 from across China invited to paint the Great Helmsman in 1950.

 iPod ear fears

 San Francisco, Feb. 3 (AFP): A music lover claiming to suffer from iPod ear has filed suit in a US court against Apple Computers, charging that the market-leading MP3 music player damages users hearing.

 John Patterson of Louisiana filed a lawsuit against Apple in the Silicon Valley city of San Jose on behalf of all iPod users and demanded a civil trial, according to court documents yesterday. iPods have a maximum possible volume of 115 decibels, and listening at that level for just 28 seconds daily can cause hearing damage, the lawsuit charged.

 The noise from a typical chain saw is reported to register 110 decibels and a jack hammer about 120 decibels.

 Jet crashes with 155 on board

 Sao Paulo, Sept. 30 (Agencies): A Brazilian passenger jet with 155 people on board plunged into the Amazon jungle, possibly after colliding with a small plane. Officials said they were unlikely to find survivors.

 The plane was found. The wreckage was found, Jose Carlos Pereira, the president of airport authority Infraero, said. Rescue planes found a concentrated wreckage site in the Amazon jungle, indicating that the plane hit the ground in a vertical position, he said. 

 The brand-new Boeing 737-800 operated by Brazilian low-cost carrier Gol disappeared yesterday afternoon.

 Our experience shows that when one cannot find the fuselage relatively intact and when the wreckage is concentrated in a relatively small area, the chances of finding any survivors are practically nonexistent, Pereira said.

 The jungle in Mato Grosso state, 1,000 km northwest of Brasilia, where the plane crashed is so thick that authorities will be forced to use helicopters to lower search and rescue crews by rope to the forest floor.

 Authorities lost radar contact with the plane during its flight from the principal Amazon city of Manaus to capital Brasilia, the airline said.

 The flight between Manaus and Rio is popular with foreign tourists but there was no immediate word on the nationalities of those aboard.

 Brazils Embraer, the worlds fourth largest aircraft manufacturer, said one of its Legacy 600 executive jets had collided with the Gol flight.

 Defence minister Waldir Pires said the Embraer Legacy with five passengers made an emergency landing at the Cachimbo air force base, and there were no injuries.

 Piers said the Embraer pilot told the authorities he practically did not see the plane. When he saw something it was but a shadow. And he felt a shock, which made him lose part of a wing. 

 Nevertheless, radars showed the Legacy and the Boeing were flying with an altitude difference of about 1,000 feet.

 All rational logic shows there is a high probability that a collision occurred, Pereira said.

 The manager of Jarina farm in Mato Grosso said employees of a farm saw a big plane flying low and then lost sight of it. People saw a large plane making strange manoeuvring and losing altitude, Ademir Ribeiro said. The native forest is thick here, so they lost visual contact because of the trees.

 Gol said Flight 1907 was carrying 149 passengers and six crew members.

 Sergio Misaci, 47, said his brother Lazaro, 58, was aboard the flight and was travelling to Brasilia to celebrate their mothers 80th birthday. I have all the hope in the world. We have to root for them and have faith in God, he said.

 The worst previous air crash in Brazil occurred in 1982 when 137 people died.

 It was the first major incident for Gol, an upstart airline that took to the skies in 2001 with just six Boeing 737s. 

 It has grown to become Brazils second-largest airline, dramatically boosting its fleet using the same model of plane to keep costs down while giving passengers cold box lunches and soft drinks instead of hot meals and free alcohol, the norm on most Brazilian flights.

 Marriage only after restrictions end: Pitt

 New York, Sept. 9 (AP): Brad Pitt, ever the social activist, says he wont be marrying Angelina Jolie until the restrictions on who can marry whom are dropped.

 Angie and I will consider tying the knot when everyone else in the country who wants to be married is legally able, the 42-year-old actor reveals in Esquire magazines October issue.

 In the article he reflects on fifteen things I think everyone should know.

 Though Shiloh, the world-famous daughter of Pitt and girlfriend Angelina Jolie, hogged much attention upon her birth in May, Pitt says he cannot imagine life without adopted children, Maddox, 5, and Zahara, 1.

 Theyre as much of my blood as any natural born, and Im theirs, says Pitt. Thats all I can say about it. I cant live without them. So: Anyone considering (adoption), thats my vote.

 Pitt, who plays a world traveller in the upcoming drama Babel, subscribes to a laid-back parenting style. I try not to stifle them in any way, he says. If its not hurting anyone, I want them to be able to explore.

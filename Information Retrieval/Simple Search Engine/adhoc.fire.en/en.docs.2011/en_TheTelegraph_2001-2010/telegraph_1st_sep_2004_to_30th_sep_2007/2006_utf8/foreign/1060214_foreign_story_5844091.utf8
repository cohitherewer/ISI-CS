 Cheney hits mate by mistake

 Washington, Feb. 13 (Reuters): Vice-president Dick Cheney accidentally wounded a companion with shotgun pellets on a weekend quail hunt in Texas, his office said yesterday.

 Cheneys companion, Austin lawyer Harry Whittington, 78, was stable after being brought in on Saturday night, said Yvonne Wheeler, a spokeswoman for the Christus Spohn Hospital in Corpus Christi, Texas.

 Cheneys office said Whittington had been sprayed by birdshot while hunting at the Armstrong Ranch in south Texas, about 322 km south of San Antonio.

 Katharine Armstrong, whose family owns the ranch, was a member of the hunting party and witnessed the accident. She said Cheney, an experienced hunter, did not realise Whittington had rejoined the group without announcing himself, which is proper protocol among hunters.

 A bird flew up, the vice-president followed it through around to his right and shot, and unfortunately, Harry was there and he got peppered pretty good with a spray of 28-gauge pellets, Armstrong said.

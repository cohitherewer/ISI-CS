 Iraq rape scandal

 Baghdad, July 5 (Reuters): Iraqs new government today demanded an independent inquiry into charges US soldiers raped and murdered a teenager and killed her family, and said foreign troops immunity from Iraqi law should be reviewed.

 Five months before the expiry of a UN mandate for US-led forces in Iraq, Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki said he was not calling for the early departure of the troops because they would remain till Iraqi forces required assistance.

 Yes, we will demand an independent Iraqi inquiry, or a joint investigation with multinational forces, Maliki said in Kuwait in his first public meet since the case came to light five days ago. 

We believe that the immunity granted to international 

forces has emboldened them to commit such crimes, Maliki said.

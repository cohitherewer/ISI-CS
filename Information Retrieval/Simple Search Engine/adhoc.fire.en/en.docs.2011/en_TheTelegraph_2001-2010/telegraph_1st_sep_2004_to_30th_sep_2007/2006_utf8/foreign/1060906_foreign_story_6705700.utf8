 Honey feast

 Basel (Switzerland), Sept. 5 (AFP): A leak of honey at a Swiss transport company drew a swarm of hungry bees and forced the emergency services to step in, police said today.

 Hundreds of litres of honey flooded out of a damaged barrel which was part of a shipment from Mexico, and thousands of bees spread the word that the feast was on, the police said.

 Called in to end the feeding frenzy, local firefighters donned protective clothing and scooped up the honey with spades.

 The unwanted guests headed off after the honey-covered floor had been hosed down. No one was stung. 

 Beauty roll

 green dress and waving a Puerto Rican flag, was greeted 

 by the governor and first lady of the US Caribbean territory 

 as she stepped off the flight from New York. Im 

 proud to be Puerto Rican, to represent Puerto Rican women, 

 the 18-year-old aspiring actress said.

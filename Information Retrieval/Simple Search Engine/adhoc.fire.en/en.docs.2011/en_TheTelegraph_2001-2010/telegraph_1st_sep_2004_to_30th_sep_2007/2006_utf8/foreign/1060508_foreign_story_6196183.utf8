 Hunt for blue-eyed sperm donor in US ends

 PHILIP SHERWELL 

 Washington, May 7: For a few very grateful women, the search for one of Americas hottest commodities ? the sperm supplied by an anonymous super donor ? has ended happily, after a Californian artist gave away 17 vials. 

 Women across the US had almost given up hope of securing further supplies from Donor 401, whose blue eyes, sporty physique and academic background made him the ideal biological father. 

 After helping to create at least 25 children, he made his last deposit two years ago, since then stocks have run out. 

 That was until Melissa Weiss, who had tried for a baby herself without success, watched a television programme about his phenomenal popularity and realised that she had an entire batch of unused 401 samples. 

 The 17 vials cost her almost $3,000 but she insisted on giving them to existing 401 mums who wanted more children by the same donor father. 

 There seems little doubt that, had she chosen, she could have sold the samples for many times the purchase price. The women were asking me how much money I wanted, but Im just thrilled to be able to help, said Weiss, 39. Im sure they would have done the same for me. 

 She purchased 24 vials for $175 each six years ago when trying to have a baby. She used seven samples, but put the others in storage after failing to conceive. 

 In March, she saw a programme featuring mothers whose children were all conceived with 401 sperm. His contributions to the Fairfax Cryobank, near Washington DC, resulted in at least 25 babies for 18 women. 

 The detailed profile provided by the anonymous donor helps to explain his allure ? he has German roots, blue eyes and brown wavy hair and stands 6 ft 4 in tall. He was an active sportsman, studied for a doctorate and ? perhaps crucially ? described his close relationship with his mother. 

 The 401 mums initially made contact on-line to swap notes on their childrens health and developments and also to provide an extended family of half-siblings. 

 Some have met for shared holidays, but none imagined that national attention would elicit a fresh source of 401 supplies. Weiss added: The description of the donor sounded similar and Id also got the vials from Fairfax, so I contacted my fertility clinic and they confirmed that they came from 401. 

 She posted a message on the Donor Sibling Registry website where the women had made contact and where information about 401 supplies was posted, but was surprised that she did not receive any immediate response. As Carolyn George, whose son, Connor, two, is a 401 child, told The Sunday Telegraph, the mothers were concerned that they were being hoaxed or set up in a money-making ruse. Checks with doctors and clinics soon confirmed that Mrs Weiss was genuine. 

 quot;It was just an incredibly generous gesture for which were all grateful, quot; said Mrs George, 34, an Oklahoma accountant who is among the recipients, as she hopes to have another child when Connor reaches school age. 

 Mrs Weiss understood their scepticism. quot;It must have seemed too good to be true. There were women out there desperate to share just one vial and I turned up with 17. Who could blame them for feeling suspicious? When they realised it was real, they were clearly very happy and relieved. quot; 

 The vials were shipped from the Californian clinic back to Fairfax, specially packaged in two batches for security reasons. However, 401s popularity is raising questions about whether there should be limits on the number of children a single donor can produce. 

 In Britain, no donor can be used by more than 10 women because of concerns that half-siblings could unwittingly become a couple. 

 In the US, however, individual clinics operate their own unpublished restrictions on how many pregnancies are allowed from a donor in a particular geographical area and there are no national regulations. The anonymity of donors is guaranteed in legal agreements by the clinics, but given the media furore it is almost certain that 401 is aware that his is a premium product. 

 Several of the mothers told The Sunday Telegraph that although they were curious about the donor father of their children, they respected his right to privacy and would bitterly oppose any efforts to unmask him. 

 Meanwhile, Mrs Weiss and her husband have their own good news on the baby front, after trying, unsuccessfully, for a child for eight of their nine years of marriage. A surrogate mother will give birth to their daughter in August.

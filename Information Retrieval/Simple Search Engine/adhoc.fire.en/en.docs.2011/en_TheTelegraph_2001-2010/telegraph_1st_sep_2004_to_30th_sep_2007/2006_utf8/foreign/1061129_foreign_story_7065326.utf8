 Racy scandal of Russia kind

 Kandelaki: Gory details

 Moscow, Nov. 28 (Reuters): Married Russian TV star Tina Kandelaki today defended her squeaky clean image after French police said she was the mystery woman with a Russian billionaire when he crashed his sports car on the Riviera.

 A police source in Nice said 31-year-old Kandelaki was treated for minor injuries after businessman Suleiman Kerimovs black Ferrari slammed into a tree. But the presenter said she was at home all the time with her husband and children.

 As Kerimov fought in a Marseille hospital to recover from terrible burns he suffered in the crash, scandal enveloped Kandelaki, wife of a wealthy entrepreneur and regularly billed as one of Russias most glamourous but respectable public faces.

 The racy tale of wealth and possible indiscretion drove Russias fast-growing tabloid press into a frenzy. The billionaire burned, trying to save the presenter Tina Kandelaki, a headline in Your Day newspaper ran.

 The French police source confirmed Kandelaki was briefly treated at Saint Roch hospital in Nice on Saturday suffering from slight burns to the legs following the accident on the citys Promenade des Anglais. She checked out of the hospital very quickly, the police source said.

 But Kandelaki, who has an untainted public image as a presenter of childrens programmes and host of a popular chat-show Details, was determined to tough out the scandal.

 She told Russian journalists she had been with her family at home in Moscow all the time, recovering from mumps which stopped her making any public appearances.

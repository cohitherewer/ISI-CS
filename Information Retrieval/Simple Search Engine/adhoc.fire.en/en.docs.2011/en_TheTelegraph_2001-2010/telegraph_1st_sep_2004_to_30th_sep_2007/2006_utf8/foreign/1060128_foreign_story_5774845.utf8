 Russia outrage 

 Moscow, Jan. 27 (Reuters): President Vladimir Putins defence minister struggled today to stem national outrage after a young Russian army conscript had his legs, genitals and fingers amputated following a beating by his superiors. 

 Andrei Sychev, 19, was beaten up by the soldiers in a Ural mountains tank academy for several hours. Delayed medical help allowed gangrene to develop and doctors finally had to amputate Sychevs legs, his genitals and parts of his fingers.

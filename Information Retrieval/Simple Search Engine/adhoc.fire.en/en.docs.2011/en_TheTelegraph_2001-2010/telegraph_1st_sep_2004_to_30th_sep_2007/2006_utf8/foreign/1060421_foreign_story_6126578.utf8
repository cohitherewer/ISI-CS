 China fires organ salvo

 Beijing, April 20 (Reuters): China took a swipe today at British transplant experts who accused it of removing organs from executed prisoners in order to sell them, saying similar practices used to happen with patients in Britain.

 The British Transplantation Society said yesterday there was an accumulating body of evidence that suggested organs of executed Chinese prisoners were being removed for transplants and sold.

 I want to remind this organisation not to forget that a few years ago this kind of thing happened in Britain, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Qin Gang told a regular news conference.

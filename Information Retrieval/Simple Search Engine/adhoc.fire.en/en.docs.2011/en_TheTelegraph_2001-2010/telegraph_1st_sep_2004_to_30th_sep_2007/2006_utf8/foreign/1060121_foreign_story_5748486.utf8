 US smokers sue firm to pay for scans

 New York, Jan. 20 (AP): A group of long-time Marlboro cigarette smokers have sued Philip Morris USA, asking the tobacco giant to pay for annual high-tech screenings they say would catch lung cancer in its early stages. 

 Like other tobacco lawsuits, the complaint filed by four plaintiffs in federal court yesterday alleges they were victims of deceptive marketing of a deadly product. It seeks class action status for anyone over the age of 50 who has smoked the equivalent of one pack a day for at least 20 years.

 The plaintiffs have demanded yearly spiral CT X-Ray lung scans at the companys expense. The suit claims the procedure ? which can cost up to $500 and is not normally covered by health insurance ? could save thousands of lives by detecting lung cancer before it becomes deadly. The new suit describes a CT scan as a procedure that can detect small tumours on the lungs far more effectively than chest conventional X-Rays.

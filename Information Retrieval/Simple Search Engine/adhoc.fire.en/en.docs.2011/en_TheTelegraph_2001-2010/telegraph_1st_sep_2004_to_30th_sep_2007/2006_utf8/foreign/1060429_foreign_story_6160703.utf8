 Reptile rage

 Canberra, April 28 (Reuters): A cantankerous crocodile chased a man removing a storm-felled tree from its pen before stealing his chainsaw, shattering a few teeth in the process.

 The aptly named Brutus, a 4.5 m saltwater crocodile kept as an attraction at the Corroboree Park Tavern in Australias Northern Territory, took offence at the noise of the chainsaw as the man cut the fallen tree, tavern co-owner Linda Francis said.

 Freddy had climbed out on to the tree and was removing a limb when the crocodile just erupted from his pool about 20 m away and used the tree to launch himself up at Fred and the chainsaw, Francis said today.

 Fred virtually gave him the chainsaw, shoved it at him. The crocodile didnt cut himself, just broke a few teeth. Brutus then took the chainsaw into his pond and played with it for about an hour, before losing interest. 

 King fuel

 Oslo (Reuters): Swedens King Carl 

 Gustav drove away from a petrol station in northern Norway 

 without paying for his fuel because of a forgetful chauffeur, 

 the royal palace said on Friday. On their way home from 

 a days outing this Easter, the king and Queen Silvia 

 stopped to fill up at a northern Norway station, and their 

 driver went in to pay and buy sweets, but drove off after 

 only paying for the candy.

 Nasa posse

 Cape Canaveral, Florida (Reuters): Nasa is trying to rid the Kennedy Space Center of vultures after the shuttle struck one of the large birds during lift-off last year on the first flight after the Columbia disaster. The space center has set up what it calls a road kill posse to quickly clear as many carcasses as possible from the 6,000-acre site, in hopes of encouraging the vulture population to relocate by cutting off its food supply. When shuttle Discovery lifted off the launch pad last July on the first flight since the 2003 Columbia accident, it hit a vulture during its climb to orbit.

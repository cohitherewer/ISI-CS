 Humbled Gyanendra prays

 Kathmandu, May 6 (Reuters): Nepals humbled King Gyanendra used his first public appearance since restoring democracy to sacrifice animals and offer prayers to the Hindu goddess of power, officials and local media said today.

 The 58-year-old monarch, accompanied by Queen Komal, made a quiet visit yesterday to the shrine of Dakshinkali, about 25 km south of Kathmandu, a palace official said.

 The king, who gave in to last months street protests and reinstated the parliament dissolved in 2002, offered prayers to the family deity in a ceremony marked that is every year, he said.

 This is a very important worship of the family or personal deity, said Mukunda Raj Aryal, an expert on Nepali Hindu culture. Gyanendra offered prayers for more than 90 minutes at the shrine located in a ravine and sacrificed a goat, a lamb, a buffalo, a rooster and a duck to the deity.

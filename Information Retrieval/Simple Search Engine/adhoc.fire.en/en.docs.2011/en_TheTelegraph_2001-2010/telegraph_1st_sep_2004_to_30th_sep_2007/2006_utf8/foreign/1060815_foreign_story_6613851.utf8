 Culture cleaner

 New York, Aug. 14 (AP): Singer Boy George tried out a new look a street sweepers orange vest as he reported for his first day of community service today in New York.

 It did not take long before he got into a confrontation with the media. The one-time Culture Club singer was ordered to spend five days as a garbage worker after pleading guilty in March to false reporting of an incident. He called police with a bogus report of a burglary at his New York apartment last October, and the responding officers found cocaine inside. 

 As he went about his duties, the singer was swarmed by reporters and photographers on a New York street. You think youre better than me? he yelled. Go home. Let me do my community service.

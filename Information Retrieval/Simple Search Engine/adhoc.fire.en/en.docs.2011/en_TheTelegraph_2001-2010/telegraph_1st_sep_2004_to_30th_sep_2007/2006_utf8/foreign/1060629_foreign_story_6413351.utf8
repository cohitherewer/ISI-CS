 Streep draws on men, not Vogue editor

 New York, June 28 

 (Reuters): Meryl Streep, who plays a tyrannical fashion 

 magazine editor in The Devil Wears Prada, insists 

 she didnt draw on Vogue editor Anna Wintour 

 for her character ? on the contrary, she based it on men 

 she knows.

 The film is based on the best-selling book, which sent shock waves through the fashion world in 2003 with its barely disguised fictional version of the inner workings of Vogue magazine, written by former Vogue staffer Lauren Weisberger.

 In the book, the editor of Runway magazine, Miranda Priestley, is portrayed as unreasonable and bullying to her staff. In the film, she also has a softer side on rare occasions and her genius and business savvy are emphasized.

 Fashion circles have been abuzz before the films June 30 release about whether Wintour, the most powerful woman in fashion, might seek revenge in the pages of Vogue against those who collaborated on the movie.

 But Vogue spokesman Patrick Connell said Wintour had enjoyed the film when she attended an advance benefit screening recently. 

 Two-time Oscar winner Streep, who revels in the role of the fur-coat-clad boss from hell, said she modelled the character on various people ? but not Wintour.

 Unfortunately you dont have enough women in power, or at least I dont know them, to copy, she said in New York before the films release on Friday. Most of my models for this character were ... male, she said.

 I know the book was based on an assistants eye view of Anna Wintour, but it didnt interest me to do a documentary of Anna Wintour, Streep said. I didnt know anything about her and I only met her at the first benefit. She was a good sport about it. Shes been told that I dont resemble her.

 The woman responsible for dressing Streep and co-star Anne Hathaway, who plays the editors assistant, was fashion designer Patricia Fields, who was also the costume designer on the hit television show Sex and The City. I didnt worry about offending anyone, Fields said, adding that fashion labels from Chanel to Prada were only too willing to lend their clothes for the movie.

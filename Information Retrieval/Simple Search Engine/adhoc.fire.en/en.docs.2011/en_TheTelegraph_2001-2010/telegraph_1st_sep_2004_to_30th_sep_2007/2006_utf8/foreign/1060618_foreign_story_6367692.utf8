The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 When Paul will be sixty four

 London, June 17 (AP): When I get older, losing my hair, many years from now, sang Paul McCartney on When Im Sixty-Four, a jaunty tune from The Beatles Sgt. Pepper album.

 The hair is intact, but the year is now ? McCartney turns 64 tomorrow.

 A spokesman would not say how McCartney planned to spend the day, but he could be excused for skipping a party. It has been a traumatic year, in which the former Beatle split from his wife of four years, Heather Mills McCartney, amid lurid headlines about their relationship.

 People seem to be interested in him as a celebrity, but not as a musician, said Beatles historian Peter Doggett ? a bitter blow for a man who with John Lennon formed rocks most storied songwriting partnership.

 Beatles fans, however, seem determined to answer McCartneys question ? Will you still need me, will you still feed me, when Im 64? ? in the affirmative. McCartneys home town of Liverpool was celebrating with weekend of events.

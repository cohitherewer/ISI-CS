The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Take a shower, not bath

 Julia Roberts and Richard Gere in Pretty Woman.

 Los Angeles, Sept. 10: The hotel bathtub is going down the drain. 

 In todays hurried society, baths are becoming a rare occurrence, hoteliers say, so tubs are being replaced with larger shower-only stalls. 

 The ick factor keeps many hotel guests out of tubs. Some are grossed out by the thought of who might have been soaking there before they checked in. 

 Hilton, one of the worlds largest hoteliers, has yanked bathtubs from two of its marquee properties, the Beverly Hilton and Hilton New York. One of its chief rivals, Marriott, also is hauling some tubs to the trash. 

 When the upscale Sofitel Los Angeles finished a $40-million renovation in June, only 77 of its 309 rooms were left with tubs. 

 The Sofitel put in rain showers and hand-held shower wands, with privacy glass that allows for a one-way view of the Hollywood sign and the 32-inch flat-panel TV (the bathroom is armed with speakers). 

 Given time constraints and things today, people dont have time for the 30- to 40-minute bath, Brent Martin, Sofitels general manager, said. Theyre going toward a great shower experience. He said guests were walking away happy, save for a few international travellers mainly from Europe and Japan who are easily relocated to a room with a tub. 

 The goal, Martin said, is to make people as comfortable as they are at home. 

 A survey of home trends released by the American Institute of Architects indicated that multi-head showers, steam showers and separate showers were increasingly popular. 

 Whirlpool bathtubs, which not long ago were the hot bathroom accessory, are becoming less popular, the survey said. 

 Showers at Holiday Inn Express have become so popular with guests that hundreds each week are forking over $80 apiece to buy the hotel chains Kohler Stay Smart showerhead. It recently spent $20 million to upgrade its bathrooms, increasing shower size by 25per cent. 

 The hoteliers are catering to people such as Robyn Salzman, a 30-year-old television producer from Burbank, who avoids tubs during her regular business travels. 

 Its more of a time thing, Salzman said. Also, its sort of hygiene-ish. Who knows how well theyre cleaned? She might consider a soak in a whirlpool, but definitely not the standard tub-shower combo. 

 The days of bubble bath commercials are history for many people. 

 Even in Hollywood, luxuriating bathtub scenes seem dated. No more Doris Day and Rock Hudson in Pillow Talk, in which the two lounge, split-screen, in separate tubs. 

 And movie fans remember the famous bathtub scene from Pretty Woman with Richard Gere and Julia Roberts at the Regent Beverly Wilshire. But that was more than 15 years ago. 

 But what about travelling families that need to give their young ones a soak in the rub-a-dub-tubs? By dumping tubs, are hotels throwing the babies out with the bathwater?

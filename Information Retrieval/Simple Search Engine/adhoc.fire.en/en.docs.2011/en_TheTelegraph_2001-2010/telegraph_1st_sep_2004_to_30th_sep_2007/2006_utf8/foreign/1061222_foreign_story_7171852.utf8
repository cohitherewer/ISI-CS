 Monica graduates, hunts for job

 Looking ahead

 New York, Dec. 21 (Reuters): Former White House intern Monica Lewinsky, whose sexual relationship with President Bill Clinton led to his impeachment, has graduated from the London School of Economics, her publicist said yesterday.

 Lewinsky, who was 21 when she became involved with Clinton, is interviewing for jobs in Britain, publicist Barbara Hutson said.

 When Lewinsky, 32, received her Masters of Science degree in Social Psychology last Thursday the audience of students and parents erupted in spontaneous applause. ... It was a very emotional moment for her, Hutson said. 

 Hutson said Lewinsky spent the past year studying and staying away from the London social scene.

 She completed a thesis entitled In Search of the Impartial Juror: An exploration of the third person effect and pre-trial publicity.

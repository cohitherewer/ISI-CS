 Iran spectre of oil price spiral

 Tehran, Jan. 15 (Reuters): Any sanctions imposed on Iran because of its disputed nuclear programme could drive up world oil prices, economy minister Davoud Danesh-Jafari told state radio today. 

 Possible sanctions on Iran from the West could possibly, by disturbing Irans political and economic situation, raise oil prices beyond levels the West expects, he said.

 Iran is the worlds fourth biggest exporter of crude oil and the second biggest in the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.

 The US and the European Union want Iran referred to the UN Security Council for possible sanctions over a nuclear programme they suspect is aimed at developing weapons rather than fuel for power stations. Iran denies the charge.

 China, a key crude buyer from Iran and permanent member of the Security Council, has said it would prefer the case to be solved outside the world body.

 Germany, the biggest exporter to Iran, has also warned economic sanctions could be a very dangerous path, preferring travel restrictions on Iranian politicians. 

 Iran said today diplomacy was the only way to resolve the impasse but that it would not reverse its widely criticised decision to resume atomic research after a break of more than two years.

 Tehran raised the stakes in the dispute last week by removing UN seals to gain access to equipment that purifies uranium, which can be used for power or, if highly enriched, in bombs.

 Diplomacy is the only clear answer to the current situation, Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi told a weekly news conference. There is no legal basis for referring Iran to the Security Council. But if that were to happen, Iran is not afraid.

 Britain will host talks between foreign ministry officials from the US, Russia, China and the EU3 on Monday to discuss Irans nuclear case.

 Asefi said the meeting should avoid using threatening language against the Islamic Republic. Better results will definitely be achieved by resorting to negotiations and using respectful language rather than using the language of threats and intimidation, Asefi said.

 Iran says it has no intention of building nuclear arms and has a clear right to develop a full nuclear programme for peaceful purposes. 

 Asefi declined to clarify whether Iran planned to carry out small-scale uranium enrichment ? the most sensitive part of the atomic fuel cycle ?as part of its research work.

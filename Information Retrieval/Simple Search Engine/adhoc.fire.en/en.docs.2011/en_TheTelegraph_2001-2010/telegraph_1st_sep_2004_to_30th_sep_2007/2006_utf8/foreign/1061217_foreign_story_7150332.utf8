 Bush pat for lesbian mother

 Mary: Fine mom

 Washington, Dec. 16 (Reuters): Vice-President Dick Cheneys pregnant lesbian daughter Mary will make a fine mom, President George W. Bush said, sidestepping his past comment that a child ideally would be raised by a mother and father.

 Mary Cheney, 37, and her longtime partner, Heather Poe, are expecting their first child. I think Mary is going to be a loving soul to her child. And Im happy for her, Bush said in an interview with People magazine. In a 2005 interview, Bush said: I believe children can receive love from gay couples but the ideal is where a child is raised in a married family with a man and a woman.

 Kate party

 Santa Monica, California (AP): US actress Kate Hudson knows when you are married to a rocker like she is, you have to expect the party will be at your house. And that is fine with her.

 You cant go into that world and not think that youre gonna have musicians crashing in your house at least 346 days out of the year, said Hudson, who is married to Chris Robinson of the Black Crowes.

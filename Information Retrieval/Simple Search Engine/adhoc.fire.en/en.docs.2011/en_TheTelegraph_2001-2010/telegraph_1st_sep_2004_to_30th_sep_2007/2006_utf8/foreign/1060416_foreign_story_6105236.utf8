 Cool cat saviour

 Berlin, April 15 (Reuters): A cat saved the life of a newborn baby abandoned on the doorstep of a Cologne house in the middle of the night by meowing loudly until someone woke up, the police said.

 The cat is a hero, Cologne police spokesman Uwe Beier said. Its loud meowing got the attention of the homeowner and saved the baby from suffering life-threatening hypothermia. The homeowner opened door to see why the cat was making so much noise and discovered the newborn.

 Beier said the boy was taken to hospital at 5 am on Thursday, when overnight temperatures fell towards zero, and had suffered only mild hypothermia.

 Shakira aid

 Miami (Reuters): Colombian pop singer Shakira says she has 

teamed with a group of Latin artists to organise a Live Aid-style event that will 

help the poor people of her continent. We want this to be an event that 

brings world attention to poverty in Latin America, Shakira says, which 

is virtually invisible to the rest of the world. Formal word of the event, 

which is tentatively slated for 2007, is not expected for several months. Sources 

say the artists involved include Juanes, Alejandro Sanz and Miguel Bosa, who all 

have track records of working for worthy causes.

 Drunk drive

 San Antonio, Texas (Reuters): A controversial Texas programme to send undercover agents into bars to arrest drunks has been halted after a firestorm of protest from the public. The Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission has temporarily suspended what it called Operation Last Call even though it still believes it was worthwhile, commission spokeswoman Carolyn Beck said on Thursday. We understand that everything has room for improvement, this included, she said. 

She said most of those arrested in the sting operations had been 

dangerously drunk and might have tried to drive if TABC agents had 

not busted them. 

 Jury duty

 Beijing (PTI): Chinese movie actor Zhang Ziyi who starred in the film Memoirs of a Geisha has been included as a judge at this years Cannes Film Festival. She has accepted an invitation to join the jury, but is awaiting a formal announcement from the organisers, Zhang said while promoting the movie Jasmine Women here on Friday. Im anticipating taking up the post and it would be an honour, Zhang said. Zhang said she wanted to use her international influence in creating more Chinese films.

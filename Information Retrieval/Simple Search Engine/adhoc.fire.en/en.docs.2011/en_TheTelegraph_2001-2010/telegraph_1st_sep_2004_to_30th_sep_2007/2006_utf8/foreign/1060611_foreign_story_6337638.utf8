 Iran scripts N-reply

 Mottaki: Its our call

 Tehran, June 10 (Reuters): Iran may send its own nuclear package in response to proposed incentives agreed by six world powers that seek to persuade Tehran to stop its atomic fuel work, foreign minister Manouchehr Mottaki said today.

 He did not specify what changes to the package Iran might seek, but Tehran has repeatedly rejected the crux of the proposal ? that it should give up enriching uranium. 

 We hope that shuttle diplomacy will lead to a genuine proposal from the Islamic Republic that could possibly be sent to European counterparts as an amendment or a counter-package and that will be assessed carefully by the Europeans, Mottaki was quoted as saying by the official IRNA news agency.

 Irans chief nuclear negotiator Ali Larijani has complained about the incentives ambiguities.

 Iran has been referred to the UN Security Council where it could face sanctions, after failing to convince the international community that its atomic scientists are seeking to build power stations, not weapons.

 The US, France, Germany, Britain, Russia and China have agreed on a set of incentives for Iran on the condition that it stops making nuclear fuel, something Tehran has said it will never do.

 US President George W. Bush yesterday said Iran had weeks not months to respond to the proposals and Austrian Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel has said Iran has until next months Group of Eight (G8) summit to consider the offer.

 But Mottaki told the Mehr news agency: We have not defined a deadline for assessing the proposal.

 Pervez says Pak not involved

 Islamabad, Oct. 11 (Reuters): Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf defended his country today against suspicions that illegal nuclear proliferation by a disgraced atomic scientist had enabled North Korea to carry out a nuclear test.

 This bomb (North Koreas test) is a plutonium bomb. We dont have a plutonium bomb. We are following a uranium route. That should answer your question, Musharraf told journalists at a news conference, following a Iftar dinner with the media to break the Ramazan fast.

 Pakistans top nuclear scientist, Abdul Qadeer Khan, admitted selling nuclear parts and secrets to Iran, Libya and North Korea in early 2004, and has been under house arrest in Islamabad since.

 Still admired by many Pakistanis as the father of the countrys atomic bomb, Khan escaped more severe punishment, and the government has refused to allow US investigators to have direct access to him. The US says it is confident that Khans network has been dismantled, but it would like answers to a number of other questions.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Govt rigid

 Paris, March 19 (Reuters): The French government today looked set to resist demands, backed by hundreds of thousands of protesters in marches across the country, to withdraw a law that cuts job security for young workers.

 Trade union and student leaders gave Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin a 48-hour ultimatum to scrap the First Job Contract (CPE) or face more unrest like yesterdays mass protests, including a possible general strike.

The turnout at marches nationwide was 1.5 million 

with up to 400,000 in Paris.

 Shoes chaos

 Jerusalem, Aug. 13 (Reuters): Security guards detained what they described as a young Arab man outside the Israeli Prime Ministers office today after discovering suspicious material in his shoes, an official said.

 The man was taken for questioning and was released after bomb disposal experts found they contained no explosive materials.

 The man wanted access to Ehud Olmerts offices but had been stopped during a routine security check, when his shoes aroused suspicion.

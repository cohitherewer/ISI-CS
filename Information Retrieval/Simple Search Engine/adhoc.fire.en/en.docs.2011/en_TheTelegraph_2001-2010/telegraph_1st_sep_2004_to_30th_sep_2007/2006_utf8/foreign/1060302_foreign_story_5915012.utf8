 Cat infected with bird flu dies in Germany

 Berlin, March 1 (Reuters): A dead cat found in Germany was infected with a form of the H5N1 bird flu virus, officials said yesterday, the first such case in the country and one which may fuel public fears over the disease.

 The WHO and disease experts said the case probably did not increase the risk to humans from a virus which has killed at least 93 people since late 2003. But officials in parts of Germany where bird flu has been discovered advised owners to keep their cats indoors and one expert said cat to human transmission could not be ruled out.

 Germanys Federal Research Institute for Animal Health said it was still conducting tests to see whether the virus was the deadly strain which has led to sickness and fatalities among humans in Turkey and Asia.

 The cat was found at the weekend on the island of Ruegen off Germanys northern coast, where the virus was first identified in birds earlier this month, the institute said.

 Till Backhaus, the regions agriculture minister, said the cats owner noticed the animal behaving strangely and informed local officials when it died the following day.

 The discovery may increase concern that the virus could spread to other species in Europe as it has in a number of cases in other parts of the world.

 It has been known for some time that cats can become infected by eating infected birds, Thomas Mettenleiter, the institutes president said in a statement.

 A number of big cats in Asian zoos have died after being fed infected birds and domestic cats have been shown to be particularly vulnerable to the disease, the institute said. 

 It added there had so far been no known case of a human becoming infected by a cat.

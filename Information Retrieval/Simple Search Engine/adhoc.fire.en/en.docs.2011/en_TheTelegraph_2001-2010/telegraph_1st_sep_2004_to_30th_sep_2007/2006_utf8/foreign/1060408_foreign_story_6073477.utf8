 Reward ruckus

 Berlin, April 7 (Reuters): When a German woman found a wallet containing 1,000 euros ($1,220) she decided it was better to get a reward from the owner than to keep the money ? even if that meant resorting to extortion, police said today.

 It was a bit stupid. She could just have kept the wallet, said a spokeswoman for police in the southwestern city of Darmstadt. But she wanted the finders reward ? and might have got one anyway. But she opted to extort it instead. 

 Police said the 47-year-old found the owners phone number in the wallet and told the pensioner she could only have it back for 100 euros plus 20 euros travel costs.

 Rabbit rot

 London (Reuters): It sounds 

 like a job for Wallace and Gromit. A monster 

 rabbit has apparently been rampaging through vegetable patches 

 in a small village in northern England. Angry horticulturists 

 in Felton, near Newcastle, have now mounted an armed guard 

 to protect their prized cabbages and parsnips. They 

 call it the monster. Its very big, said Joan 

 Smith, whose son Jeff owns one of the plots.

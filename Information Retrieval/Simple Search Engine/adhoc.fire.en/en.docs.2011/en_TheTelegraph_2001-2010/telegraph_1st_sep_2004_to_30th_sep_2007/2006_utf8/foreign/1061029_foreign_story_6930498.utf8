 Volver role my hardest ever, says Cruz

 Intoxicating Mix

 Los Angeles, Oct. 28 (Reuters): Penelope Cruz calls it the hardest role shes ever played, and if early reviews and award buzz hold up, her portrayal of an abused girls mom in Volver could win Cruz the first-ever Oscar for a Spanish actress.

 The movie debuts in major US cities on November 3, and it reunites Cruz with award-winning director Pedro Almodovar, who cast the then relatively unknown Spanish beauty in his 1997 movie Live Flesh and later in All About My Mother.

 In English, Volver translates into coming back, and Almodovar returns to exploring the lives of Spanish women which characterised his early films and to his quirky sense of humour after more dramatic fare like 2004s Bad Education.

 Despite the funny moments in Volver, viewing sexual abuse with anything but a serious mind is hard, and getting the right mix of comedy and tragedy challenged 32-year-old Cruz.

 Its the most difficult and complex character somebody has put in my hands, she said. I know women who have gone through things that could have destroyed them, but they kept fighting. ... My character is not a victim.

 Of course, numerous movies have yet to be seen before the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences gives out its coveted awards in February, and Cruz faces stiff competition from the likes of Helen Mirren in The Queen and Kate Winslet for Little Children, among others.

 But Cruz has several factors in her favour including global star power and an increasingly strong resume that varies from box office winners like Gothika to art-minded Vanilla Sky and critically lauded Italian film Non Ti Muovere, or Dont Move, in which she played a poor, small town waitress.

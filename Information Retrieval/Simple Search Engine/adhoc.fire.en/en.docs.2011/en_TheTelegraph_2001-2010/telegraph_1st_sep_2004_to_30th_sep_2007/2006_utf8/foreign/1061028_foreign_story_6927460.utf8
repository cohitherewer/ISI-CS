 US gains hour

 Washington, Oct. 27 (AP): Most Americans will get a chance at an extra hour of sleep this weekend, as the clocks fall back to standard time.

 Its the last time this will happen in October.

 Thanks to a law passed last year, Daylight-Saving Time will start earlier and end later beginning in 2007. It will last from the second Sunday in March to the first Sunday in November.

 Brazil band on tour

 New York, July 23 (Reuters): Nirvanas Kurt Cobain was a big fan, while Beck and David Byrne have paid homage. Nearly 30 years after it broke up, Brazilian psychedelic rock band Os Mutantes launched its first US tour on Friday in New York.

 offshoot of Brazils Tropicalia movement of the late 1960s that emerged in reaction to a US-backed military dictatorship and led by artists such as Caetano Veloso, Gilberto Gil and Tom Ze, Os Mutantes (The Mutants) combined various unlikely influences. Formed by a trio of Sao Paulo teenagers, Os Mutantes irreverence shocked and irritated the leftist university crowd, Brazilian music critic Carlos Calado wrote.

 The group won an offbeat reputation by synthesizing the Beatles Sergeant Pepper style with traditional Brazilian folk rhythms and classical music. It even used insecticide sprayers as instruments to create affffft sound.

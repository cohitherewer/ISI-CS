 Battle lines drawn on Rumsfeld

 Rumsfeld: Under glare

 Washington, April 16 (Reuters): Senior Democrats sought to raise the heat on embattled defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld today as Republicans and the Pentagon came together to defend him and the way he has conducted the war in Iraq.

 The battle of words over Rumsfeld, his relations with military leaders and the Iraq war followed unusual public calls in the past week for his resignation from six retired generals, which prompted a rebuke from the Pentagon.

 My view is that the secretary should step aside, New Mexico governor Bill Richardson, a potential Democratic presidential candidate, said at CBSs Face the Nation programme. Besides the fact that the Iraq war has been mismanaged... we should listen to what these generals say.

 Those urging Rumsfeld to step down include Major Gen. John Batiste, who commanded the 1st Infantry Division in Iraq, and Major Gen. Charles Swannack, who led the armys 82nd Airborne Division in Iraq, and former NATO commander Gen. Wesley Clark.

 These are six distinguished military officers, Richardson said. 

 They basically are saying that secretary Rumsfeld, on issues relating to military strategy... didnt listen to them.... This reaches a new level... of not being willing to admit mistakes, not being willing to change a course, policy that is just not working.

 Kentucky Republican senator Mitch McConnell told Fox News Sunday that the US had wiped out a lot of the people who would do us harm during Rumsfelds tenure. 

 I think the important thing to remember here is that we havent been attacked at home since September of 2001, he said.

 The New York Times reported today that the Pentagon had issued a memorandum to civilian military analysts and former top military commanders, some of whom appear often on television, to challenge criticism that Rumsfeld was deaf to the views of military leaders.

 US senior military leaders are involved to an unprecedented degree in every decision-making process, it said, noting Rumsfeld had held 139 meetings with the joint chiefs of staff since 2005.

 Republican senator George Allen of Virginia said the criticism of Rumsfeld amounted to scapegoating and that firing him would not resolve the Iraq situation. What difference would it make? he asked. 

 Would that mean anything to the terrorists? A lot of this focus on an individual is a way of maybe criticising the president.

 Sen. Christopher Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat, said the critical comments from the retired generals could be considered a reflection of current senior officers not permitted to criticize Rumsfeld or Bush.

 We need a new direction in Iraq, he said.Were looking at some incompetency in addition to the arrogance issues that have been raised. ... (Secretary of State) Condoleezza Rice talked about a thousand tactical mistakes the other day in Iraq the other day. Thats not exactly a ringing endorsement.

 Richardson, who served in President Bill Clintons Cabinet, said the continued high level of violence in Iraq and failure of its leaders to form a government suggests the U.S. presence in Iraq is counterproductive.

 What youre seeing is deep frustration in the military, he said,deep frustration within our troops who are not getting enough armor. ... It is obvious that Secretary Rumsfeld did not listen to them. ... Thats why were in this morass.

 Our presence there is leading to increasing danger to our troops but also to our objectives in the Middle East.

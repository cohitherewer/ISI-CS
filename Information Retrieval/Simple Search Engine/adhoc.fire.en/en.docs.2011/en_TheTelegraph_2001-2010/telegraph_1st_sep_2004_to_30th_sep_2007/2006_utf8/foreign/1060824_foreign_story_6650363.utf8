 UK diesel car breaks record

 London, Aug. 23 (Reuters): 

 A British diesel-powered car has broken its own land speed 

 record, reaching 564 km per hour a day after it shattered 

 a three-decade-old record, a team spokesman said.

 Driver Andy Green hit 530 kmph on the Bonneville salt flats in Utah in the JCB Dieselmax yesterday, before setting the new record today.

 The previous record for a diesel car, 380 kmph, was set in 1973 by Virgil Snyder in the Thermo King Streamliner.

 Green: Need for speed

JCB Dieselmax spokesman Jonathan Gill said he did not expect the team to try again.

 The vehicle is powered by two specially tuned diesel engines normally found in JCB diggers and tractors.

 Boasting twin JCB444 common rail injection diesels with turbochargers and intercoolers, the JCB Dieselmax generates an impressive 750 brake horsepower at 3,800 revolutions per minute.

 At just over nine metres long, the sleek vehicle has a drag co-efficient of 0.174 which compares with a typical family saloons drag co-efficient of about 30.

 Green is no stranger to speed. Not only is he a Royal Air Force jet pilot, but he holds the overall land speed record of 1227.99 kmph, set in 1997 with the jet-propelled ThrustSSC car.

 It was the first land vehicle to break the sound barrier. The car was driven in the Black Rock desert in Nevada.

 It was powered by two afterburning Rolls-Royce Spey engines as used in British F-4 Phantom II jet fighters. 

 It is 16.5 metres long, 3.7 metres wide and weighs 10.5 tons.

 In 1983 Richard Noble had broken the world land speed record with his car Thrust2, which reached a speed of 633 mph. 

 Both ThrustSSC and Thrust2 are displayed at the Coventry Transport Museum in Coventry, England.

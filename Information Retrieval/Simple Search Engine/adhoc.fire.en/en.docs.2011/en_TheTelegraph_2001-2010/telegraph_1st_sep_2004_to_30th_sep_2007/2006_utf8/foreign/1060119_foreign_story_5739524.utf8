 India benefits more than Pak in strategic US ties

 K.P. NAYAR

 Christina Rocca: Replaced

 Washington, Jan. 18: Pakistan may be Americas non-Nato military ally (NNMA), but it is India which is increasingly benefiting from its strategic co-operation with the US even as President George W. Bush is preparing to visit New Delhi.

 Among the series of steps taken by the Bush administration as follow up to the Next Steps in Strategic Partnership (NSSP) with India and the Indo-US nuclear agreement of July 18 last year, is a landmark decision by the commerce departments Bureau of Industrial Security (BIS) to do away with mandatory import certificates for selling dual use equipment by American companies to India.

 The decision taken last month is now beginning to impact on trade between India and the US in American equipment and technology that can be put to both civilian and military use in India, according to companies here which want to build up such trade.

 But what is significant about the decision is that for the first time since independence, India is being equated by Americas ultra-sensitive industrial security administration with Washingtons NATO allies.

 The BIS announcement said export certificates were being done away with for Slovakia, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Romania because they are Nato members.

 But in the case of India, this is being done because of the NSSP, which was launched by Bush together with former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.

 The six former satellites of the USSR are also members of various arms control and non-proliferation regimes such as the Wassenaar Arrangement, the Australia Group, the Missile Technology Control Regime and Nuclear Suppliers Group. 

 India is not a member of these and is trying to get into some of these exclusive clubs as a nuclear weapons state. Yet, for the first time, India is being treated on par with members of such international regimes.

 One senior Bush administration official said the decision was a recognition here that India is a country that is trusted by the US with sensitive material and technology.

 The official compared the decision to removing a stop sign on the highway of trade in dual use equipment and technology, which has long eluded the two countries.

 Meanwhile, the White House yesterday announced its intention to remove from her post Christina Rocca, who served as assistant secretary of state for South Asia for about five years.

 Rocca will be replaced by Richard Boucher, a career diplomat who was the state departments spokesman until early last year. 

 He has the rank of a career minister. Boucher will have to be confirmed by the Senate.Bouchers appointment is part of a process to refashion the state department in the image of the secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, who replaced Colin Powell last year.

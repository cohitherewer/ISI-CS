 Cheney to end silence on shooting

 Corpus Christi (Texas), Feb. 15 (Reuters): US vice president Dick Cheney will break his silence over the shooting of a Texas lawyer in a hunting accident, with a television interview announced by the White House.

 Doctors kept a close eye on Cheneys victim, who was in stable condition a day after experiencing a minor heart attack caused by the shooting.

 Cheney sprayed Harry Whittington, 78, with birdshot while hunting quail in Texas on Saturday, but has stayed silent on it except for brief statements from his office.

 Its an opportunity for the vice president to talk about the questions relating to this issue and also to talk about his concern for his friend Mr. Whittington, said McClellan, who was travelling with President George W. Bush in Columbus, Ohio.

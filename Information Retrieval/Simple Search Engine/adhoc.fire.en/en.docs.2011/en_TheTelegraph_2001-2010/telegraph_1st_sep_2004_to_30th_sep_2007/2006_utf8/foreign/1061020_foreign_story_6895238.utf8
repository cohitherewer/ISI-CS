 UK tribunal backs teacher over veil 

 London, Oct. 19 (Reuters): A British tribunal ruled today that a Muslim teaching assistant had not been discriminated against when the school where she worked asked her to remove her veil.

 The case of 24-year-old Aishah Azmi against Kirklees Council in West Yorkshire, northern England, has attracted nationwide interest after former foreign minister Jack Straw said Muslim women who wore full veils made community relations difficult.

 The veiled Azmi said afterwards that her veil, which leaves just the eyes exposed, had never hindered her teaching. The veil does not cause a barrier. I can teach perfectly well with the veil on, she said.

 Headfield Church of England Junior School in Dewsbury had said Azmi should remove the veil in order to communicate. When she refused, they suspended her.

 Today, a Kirklees Council official said Azmis claims of direct and indirect discrimination and of harassment had been thrown out by the employment tribunal. 

 But, Azmi was awarded 1,100 for victimisation and because the council failed to follow grievance procedures correctly.

 Maoists reveal force strength

 Kathmandu, July 11 (Reuters): Nepals Maoists have revealed for the first time how many soldiers they have ? 36,000 ? in remarks published today, a week after Kathmandu invited the UN to monitor arms of insurgents and the state army.

 We are about 36,000 (fighters) in the Peoples Liberation Army now, Bibidh , a Maoist commander was quoted by the Nepali daily, Kantipur, as saying. This keeps on changing at the time of fighting.

 It was the first time the Maoists have disclosed the number of their fighters since they began fighting against the monarchy in 1996 in a conflict which has killed more than 13,000 people.

 Nepali security officials have estimated rebel strength at around 15,000 combatants versus a government army of 100,000. Last week, the government wrote to the UN asking it to monitor arms ahead of a planned election next year.

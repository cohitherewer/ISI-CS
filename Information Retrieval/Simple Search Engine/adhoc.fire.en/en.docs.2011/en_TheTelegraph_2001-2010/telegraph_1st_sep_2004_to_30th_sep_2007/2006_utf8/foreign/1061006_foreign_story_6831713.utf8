 Harvard religion

 Boston, Oct. 5 (AP): Harvard University, founded 370 years ago to train puritan ministers, should again require all undergraduates to study religion, along with US history and ethics, a faculty committee is recommending.

 The surprisingly bold recommendations come after years of rancourous internal debate over what courses should be required of all Harvard students. The current core curriculum has been criticised for focusing on narrow academic questions rather than real-world issues students would likely confront beyond the wrought-iron gates of Harvard Square.

 The report calls for Harvard to require students to take a course in reason and faith, which could include classes on topics such as religion and democracy, Charles Darwin or a current course called: Why Americans love God and Europeans dont.

 Harvard is no longer an institution with a religious mission, but religion is a fact that Harvards graduates will confront in their lives, the report says, noting 94 per cent of incoming students report discussing religion and 71 per cent attend services.

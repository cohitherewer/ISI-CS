 Berlin, June 12 (Reuters): A 200-kg German man discovered that being overweight can be good for your health ? if you get run over by a car.

 German police said the extra body mass prevented the 30-year-old man from suffering potentially fatal injuries when a Volkswagen Polo drove over him after he braked suddenly on his bicycle and fell in front of the car. The man dislocated his hip, which local doctors put back in place.

 Bomber unleashes carnage in Baghdad

 Baghdad, Jan. 4 (Reuters): A suicide bomber caused carnage at a Shia funeral and gunmen ambushed a vital fuel convoy outside Baghdad amid a wave of attacks that killed more than 50 people today, the bloodiest day in Iraq for weeks.

 The funeral attack was the bloodiest single incident since the vote, killing 36 and wounding 40.

 It happened in Miqdadiya, 100 km northeast of the capital, where people were mourning a bodyguard to a local leader of the Dawa party, headed nationally by Shia Islamist Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari.

 Assailants fired mortars on the mourners, forcing them to take cover in the cemetery. A bomber wearing an explosive vest then blew up among them, security officials said.

 Soon afterwards, rebels armed with rocket-propelled grenades and machineguns ambushed 60 fuel tankers on a road north of Baghdad, destroying 20 of them, police and oil officials said.

 A group called the Islamic Army in Iraq claimed responsibility for the assault in an Internet statement, saying the convoy belonged to the enemy occupier, a reference to the 150,000 US troops stationed in the country.

 The statement did not mention casualties and the oil ministry in Baghdad said only one tanker had been destroyed, by a bomb planted at the side of the road.

 The convoy was part of a major government effort to ease fuel shortages in the capital following the recent closure of Iraqs main refinery at Baiji in the north. Supplies were halted for 10 days because of sabotage to a pipeline and threats to tanker drivers before it re-opened again on Monday night.

 At least 13 people were killed and 27 injured in Baghdad in the capitals first fatal car bomb attacks of 2006.

 Five died when a vehicle detonated in the northern Shia district of Kadhimiya and eight perished in a second bombing close to a busy commercial market in the southern area of Doura, police and hospital sources said.

 The bombers defied a major security operation which the police said they launched to find the kidnapped sister of the interior minister.

 The violence came as Shia, Sunni and Kurdish politicians pledged to plough on with efforts to form a national unity government capable of stemming the bloodshed, which has been mounting in the area where the suicide bomber struck.

 Security officials have said hardline Sunni groups such as al Qaida have been increasingly active in the area, centred on the provincial capital Baquba.

 Blair grilled in honours inquiry

 London, Dec. 14 (Reuters): Britains Tony Blair was quizzed as a witness today by police probing claims that political parties awarded state honours in return for loans, and analysts said it was a fresh embarrassment for a damaged Prime Minister.

 Blair was not cautioned by police about his rights before the interview, suggesting officers do not believe he has charges to answer. The Prime Minister talked to the police today, Blairs spokesman said. This was not under caution, nor was he accompanied by a lawyer. Police launched an inquiry in March into allegations that Blairs Labour Party had nominated people for House of Lords seats in exchange for party funding.

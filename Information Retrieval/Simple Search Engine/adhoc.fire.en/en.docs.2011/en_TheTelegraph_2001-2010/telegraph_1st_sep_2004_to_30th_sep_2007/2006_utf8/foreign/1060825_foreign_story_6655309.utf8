 Apple to recall 1 m laptop batteries

 San Francisco, Aug. 24 (Reuters): Apple Computer Inc. will recall 1.8 million lithium-ion notebook computer batteries after nine devices overheated, causing minor burns to two users, US safety regulators said today.

 The recall is the second-biggest in US history involving electronics or computers. Just last week, number one PC maker Dell Inc recalled 4.1 million lithium-ion batteries. In both cases, the batteries had power cells made by Sony Corp.

 Sony said the Apple and Dell recalls would cost Sony between 20 billion yen and 30 billion yen ($172 million to $258 million).

 Cupertino, California-based Apple will recall 1.1 million batteries sold with notebook computers in the US and 700,000 abroad, the US Consumer Product Safety Commission said. They were sold with Apple iBook G4 and PowerBook G4 computers from October 2003 through this month.

 Bangla anger over prices 

 Dhaka, April 12 (Reuters): At least one man was killed in clashes between police and thousands of people protesting in a northern town today against shortages of basic commodities and the high price of utilities, police and witnesses said.

 They said several protesters were injured when police fired teargas shells and rubber bullets to disperse them.

 Unconfirmed reports by reporters on or near the scene said up to four protesters died today, taking the number of deaths to 14 since the trouble began in January.

 Demonstrators gathered in Kanshat, some 350 km from Dhaka, attacked policemen with stones and sticks, wounding five of them, a police officer said.

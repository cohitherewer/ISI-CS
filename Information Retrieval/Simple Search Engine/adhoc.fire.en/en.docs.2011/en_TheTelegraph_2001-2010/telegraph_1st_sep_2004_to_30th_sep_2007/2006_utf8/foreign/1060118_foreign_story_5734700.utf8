 Heck! Bush spurns Hell

 FRANCIS HARRIS

 Washington, Jan. 17: Its a heck of a thing but President George W. Bush cannot bring himself to mention the underworld.

 Spurning the often expletive-packed language of his predecessors, Bush regularly reaches for heck to replace the word Hell. So frequently does he use the word that it has become a sort of verbal signature for the evangelical Texan.

 His enemies have zeroed in on heck, particularly since he uttered it in the days after Hurricane Katrina. Brownie, youre doing a heck of a job, he told Michael Brown, the federal emergency director, after New Orleans was almost wiped from the map. Days later Brown was sacked.

 Now the Internet is packed with suggestions that a new political formula has been discovered. It has several versions but its essence is heck + (anyones name) = instant dismissal.

 Whole cities have been lauded with the term. This weekend Bush described the re-emerging city of New Orleans as a heck of a place to bring your family. 

 Peace processes have also been described with an artful heck, as when he noted in October that he was a heck of a lot more confident about the fate of West Asian talks than he had been before. 

 Linguistic experts say the term is common American usage to link the President to the common man. But heck is also an alternative to Hell and Americans, unlike Britons, frown on blasphemy. Most use heck rather than Hell and gosh or gee as an expression of surprise rather than God.

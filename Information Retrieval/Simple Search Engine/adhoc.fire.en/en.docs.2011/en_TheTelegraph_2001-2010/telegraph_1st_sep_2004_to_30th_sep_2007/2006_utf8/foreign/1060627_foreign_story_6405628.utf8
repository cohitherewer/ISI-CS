The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Moscow is costliest city

 London, June 26 (Reuters): Moscow has surged past Tokyo and London to become the worlds costliest city with a cost of living almost 25 per cent higher than in New York, Mercer Human Resource Consulting said today in its annual survey.

 Designed as a reference guide for staff on international placements, the survey allocates New York 100 as its benchmark and ranks every other city against it.

 On that basis, Moscow surged three places from 2005 to come in top of the league with 123.9, followed by Seoul, also up three places on 121.7, and Tokyo, last years leader, on 119.1. Hong Kong climbed five places to fourth on 116.3, with London down two to fifth place on 110.6.

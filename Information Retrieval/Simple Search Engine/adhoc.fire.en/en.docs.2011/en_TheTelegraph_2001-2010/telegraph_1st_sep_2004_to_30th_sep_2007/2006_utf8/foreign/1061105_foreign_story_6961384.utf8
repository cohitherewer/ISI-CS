 For decades, the debate among 007 fans has been who is the best Bond Sean Connery or Roger Moore.

 Now a new contender has arrived, in the shape of Daniel Craig the blond 38-year-old, who despite being a cold-blooded killer, manages to fall in love with his Bond girl and show emotional vulnerability.

 The critics were struggling to contain their excitement last night, ahead of the first British screening of the 21st Bond film, Casino Royale. And when they came out of the showing, they were thrilled. The 57 million production is perhaps the most eagerly-awaited Bond film ever. The film begins in black and white, but then the credits roll and amazing technicolour returns.

 The excitement has been building for more than a year, since Craig, wearing a Savile Row suite and lifejacket, was escorted down the Thames in a dinghy by the royal Marines after it was announced he had won the part. It was not the best of starts. As he got out of the boat, Craig admitted the ride had scared him. 

 Connery played the first Bond in 1962 and he played him sexy and tough. Moore, with his trademark arching eyebrow movement and knowing glances, was sexy and humourous. But last night, there were no doubts Craig who has been romantically linked to Sienna Miller and Kate Moss possesses the hard-man credentials which might make him many millions more fans.

 Its terrific, said one critic. This is going to be the prequel to all other Bonds. There are a lot of fans who prefer either Moore or Connery but Craig could be better. This will make Craig a worldwide star. 

 Casino Royale is the story of how Bond got started, before he became 007, he said. Daniel Craig is such a good actor. He plays him as strong but emotionally vulnerable. For the first time you see Bonds sensitive side. There is no sexual innuendo in this film; Craigs Bond is more sophisticated than that. And the film makers have been sure to show the consequences of violence he bleeds. Ian Fleming introduced the fictional British spy in 1952 with Casino Royale, which was the first Bond novel.

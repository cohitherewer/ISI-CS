 Bangla hails militant arrests

 Dhaka, March 7 (Reuters): The capture of a second top Islamic militant in Bangladesh in less than a week won praise today from media, analysts and ordinary citizens fed up with a bombing campaign that began in August and has killed at least 30 people.

 Siddikul Islam Bangla Bhai was captured yesterday after a gunbattle in a northern district hideout, four days after Shayek Abdur Rahman surrendered following a siege further northeast.

 The men are respectively the leaders of the outlawed Jagrata Muslim Janata Bangladesh and Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen groups, banned early last year.

 Tourists defiant after carnage

 Dahab (Egypt), April 25 (Reuters): Defiant holidaymakers described scenes of carnage in Egypts Sinai resort of Dahab today after three bombs killed at least 23 people in the latest attack on the countrys vital tourist industry.

 A security source said 10 people, all of them Egyptians, had been detained in connection with yesterdays bombings, but gave no details on what their involvement may have been or if they were connected to a specific group.

 Despite the attacks, which also wounded around 60 people, most tourists said they planned to stay on in Dahab, a popular resort for diving, especially among backpackers.

 Egypts tourism industry generates more than $7 billion a year and employs around 10 per cent of the workforce, making it an economic linchpin. About 100 Egyptians and foreigners marched through Dahab today chanting: We love everyone in an apparent effort to rally support for the industry.

 We dont think were going to change our plans. You end up thinking that it could happen anywhere these days, Swiss holidaymaker Matthias Barlocher said before the march.

 (But) it doesnt feel right to be enjoying a holiday when you can see bloody footprints everywhere.

 Trails of blood remained on a long stretch of Dahabs beach promenade, which is lined with restaurants and souvenir shops. In other places, shopkeepers washed away bloodstains with salt and water and attempted to go back to business. Security officials said the explosions were probably caused by bombs attached to timers rather than suicide bombers.

 There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blasts, which bore the hallmarks of previous coordinated blasts in the region by local militants.

 A little-known, Sinai-based group is believed to have carried out two other, similar-style attacks on Egypts Red Sea coast in the last two years, killing around 100 people ? one in the resort of Taba and another at Sharm el-Sheikh.

 Security experts downplay possible links to external militant groups such as al Qaida but say they may serve as inspiration for the local attackers. One witness to yesterdays bombing, Australian Steve Torokfalvy, said he administered first aid to victims after one explosion smashed windows and blew out doors in his hotel. 

 There was one guy who was in a really bad way, who when we turned him round, I saw half his face was missing, we just tried to comfort him until we could get more help, he said. From the top of the hotel you could see body parts on the roofs of the shops ... It was horrible, it was really horrible. Egypts interior ministry said a German child was killed in the blasts, along with two other foreigners.

 Inspired by Dahl, a park of chocolate

 Amsterdam, June 29 (Reuters): Amsterdam will get a theme park dedicated to chocolate and inspired by Roald Dahls childrens book Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, city officials and entrepreneurs said today.

 Just like Dahls fictional Chocolate Factory owned by Willy Wonka, the main part of the sweets park will be located underground, in a disused railway tunnel which was handed over by the city of Amsterdam in a ceremony today.

 The attraction, which is expected to open to the public in two to three years, will feature a glass elevator and a chocolate fountain, similar to the book. Ten years ago I made a radio play of the Chocolate Factory and ever since Ive been fascinated by it, said publisher Maurits Rubinstein who started the project.

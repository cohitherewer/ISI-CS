 Musharraf: Letter lash

 Islamabad, July 23: In a rare act of political courage, a number of retired generals, politicians and intellectuals have asked President Pervez Musharraf to doff his uniform and disengage the military from politics to strengthen democracy in Pakistan. 

 The signatories of the letter written to Gen. Musharraf include Lt Gen. (Retired) Asad Durrani and Lt Gen. (Retired) Hameed Gul, two former heads of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), the agency which has been instrumental in making and breaking political parties.

 Being a constitutional office, the office of the president is a political office. Combining the presidency with the office of chief of army staff politicises the latter as well as the army, said the letter, copies of which were sent to Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz and former prime ministers Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif.

 Democracy could only be authentic when there is real separation of powers and when all institutions abide by the role assigned them by the Constitution, said the letter, also signed by former interior minister Lt Gen. (Retired) Moinuddin Haider. He was handpicked by Musharraf after his 1999 coup that toppled Nawaz Sharif.

 The signatories also called for the next general elections to be held under caretaker governments at the centre and in the provinces, and demanded that the chief election commissioner be given control of district administrations for free and fair polls.

 The letter comes at a time ministers of the pro-Musharraf ruling party, the Pakistan Muslim League (PML-Q), are saying that the present National Assembly is entitled to reelect Musharraf for a second term in the latter part of 2007. 

 But opposition parties have threatened to resist such a move, with the religio-political alliance, the MMA, declaring that it would ask for dissolution of the two provincial assemblies it controls.

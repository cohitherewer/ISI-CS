 Mecca, Jan. 6 (Agencies): At least 76 people died in the collapse of a Muslim pilgrims hostel in Saudi Arabia, the first tragedy to beset the Haj pilgrimage this year, a Saudi official said today.

 Interior minister spokesman General Mansour al-Turki said the number of dead could rise as rescue teams clear the rubble of the building, which collapsed yesterday in Mecca where more than a million pilgrims have gathered.

 The spokesman gave no breakdown of the nationalities of the dead, which included at least eight women. But survivors said most pilgrims staying in the hostel came from India, Libya, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates.

 Saudi authorities had said at least 18 people were killed in the incident which took place during the mid-day bustle of a narrow market street.

 The official put the number of injured at 62. The building was at least six storeys high and 30 years old. The tragedy occurred days before Sundays start of the five-day Haj, when 2.5 million Muslims cram into the mountain city where Islam was born. 

 Under spotlights, hundreds of men worked with cranes and other tools through the night to remove huge slabs of concrete from the site of the collapse. Some workers cut through steel girders with blow torches and others used microphone to listen for signs of life.

 I believe that people are trapped and I still hope to find some survivors, said Brigadier Hamad al-Ahmadi, who oversaw the night operation. Fortunately the building was almost empty when it collapsed, because most of the residents were in the holy shrine, Major General Alwani told state-run al-Ekhbariya television.

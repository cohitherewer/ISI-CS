 Jerusalem, July 25 (Reuters): Israel said today it was determined to pursue its war against Hizbollah and would establish a no-go zone for the guerrillas in southern Lebanon until an international force arrives.

 After meeting US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice, Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said both agreed that disarming Hizbollah and deploying a foreign force in its place were key to resolving the two-week-old crisis.

 The war will take centre stage at an international conference in Rome tomorrow where Arab and some European nations are expected to call for an immediate ceasefire over Washingtons objections. 

 Defence minister Amir Peretz, who held separate talks with Rice, said Israel would control a security strip along the 80 km frontier and fire at anyone who entered.

 He did not say how wide it would be. Israeli government sources estimated the zones width at 3-4 km . Israel currently has full control over only one Lebanese border village after a week of fierce ground fighting. 

 While it was not immediately clear whether Israel planned to control the area by putting more troops into Lebanon, such talk will revive memories of Israels occupation of southern Lebanon for 22 years until it withdrew in 2000. 

 On the battlefield inside southern Lebanon, Israeli troops and tanks fought Hizbollah in the guerrilla stronghold town of Bint Jbeil. 

 Israel said it killed up to 30 fighters.

 Israeli warplanes bombarded south Beirut and launched 100 strikes across south Lebanon. One attack killed a family of seven, Lebanese security sources said. Hizbollah rockets killed a 15-year-old girl in an Arab Israeli town in Galilee, medics said.

 A total of 413 people in Lebanon and 42 Israelis have been killed in a conflict that erupted after Hizbollah abducted two Israeli soldiers in a July 12 cross-border raid.

 President George W. Bush said Rice was telling West Asian leaders: We care about the (Lebanese) people. We will help to get aid to the people. And that we want a sustainable cease-fire. We dont want something thats, you know, short term in duration.

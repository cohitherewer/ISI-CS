 Interpol notices for Benazir, husband

 Islamabad, Jan. 27 (Reuters): At the request of Pakistans military-led government, Interpol has issued notices confirming that bona fide warrants exist for the arrest of former Prime Minister and Opposition leader Benazir Bhutto and her husband.

 The international police organisation stressed that the so-called red notices it had issued for the couple, who live in self-imposed exile, were not international arrest warrants.

 In response to questions, Interpol said they were notifications that bona fide arrest warrants existed in one of the organisations 184 members states. It said the notifications were issued following a request from the Pakistani authorities.

 Interpol said many of the 184 members considered red notices valid requests for provisional arrest, especially if they were linked to a bilateral extradition treaty.

 However, it noted that members states could challenge their validity if they believed they contravened Interpol rules forbidding political, religious, military or racial intervention.

 Accusing the military regime of misrepresenting facts to get the red notices against her and Zardari, Bhutto said in Washington that she was not evading arrest and no court in Pakistan had asked for her presence in the 10 cases of corruption booked against her. My husband and I have faced these scurrilous, baseless, malicious, and politically motivated charges for the past nine years. And by the grace of god, theres not a single conviction against either my husband or myself for fraud or for corruption, Bhutto told Voice of America radio.

 Bhutto, who served twice as Pakistani Prime Minister, has been living in self-imposed exile in Dubai and Britain for the past six years.

 She faces a raft of charges of corruption and misrule should she ever return to Pakistan. Bhutto and Zardari, who served as investment minister in his wifes cabinet, also face charges of corruption abroad.

 These relate to accusations dating back to the 1990s that the two accepted commissions for awarding contracts to two Swiss firms to do business in Pakistan.

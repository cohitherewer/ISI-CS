Kathmandu, April 22: We want independence from the king, sir. We dont want this bloody king, said 21-year old Vikas Jha politely while consigning a tyre to the flames at Basundhara on Chakrapath or Ring Road.

 Why did he not want the king? This bloody King is a dictator sir, he replied.

 A civil engineer assigned to broaden the Ring Road, he said that now he was using the boulders meant for that to block the road. 

 Was he a Maoist? No sir, I am an engineer, he replied innocently.

 Those who had got up in the Nepalese capital this morning thinking that the anger of the people had boiled over were in for a rude awakening. Tens of thousands poured into the streets shouting against the kings deception.

 The anti-monarchy sentiment on the street was explicit. As the situation got out of hand, curfew was reimposed at mid-day. The protesters burnt tyres, felled trees and blocked roads with boulders and logs. They whistled, danced and sang.

 Their slogans were radical. They shouted: Shahi Sena kharij kar (Get rid of the Royal Nepal Army), Rashtriya sena nirmaan kar (Create a national army) and they said to King Gyanendra: Natra bhane gaddi chhod (Otherwise, leave the throne).

 Others demanded the creation of a Constituent Assembly. If the Maoists had not won the battle for Kathmandu, they had certainly won the battle for correct slogans.

 Rajendra Sapkota, a student, said: We dont only want democracy but a democratic republic. Gantantra. Not Jantantra, he said emphasising the difference.

 Nirmala Adhikary, a 30-year old housewife, said: I am going to protest to ensure a better future for my children in a democracy. 

 She was angry with King Gyanendra and argued: What is the use of his being there if the people are suffering?

 Bhaktaraj Basnet, a 24-year old casino worker, had been hit on the head in a baton-charge yesterday. He was back protesting with a bandage shouting: Todays programme is to bring in the republic today itself.

 Clearly, the anger of the Nepalese people against King Gyanendra had erupted in an unprecedented manner. From Gongabu, they marched towards Girija Prasad Koiralas house in Maharajganj. The leaders of the seven-party alliance were meeting there. They did not want them to compromise.

Those who reached the house shouted: Durabar 

bhitra chor hi chor, chor hi chor. Gyane chor, desh chhod (The palace 

is full of thieves. Gyanendra thief, leave the country).

 Mel Gibson arrested for drunken driving

 Gibson: Deadly drive

 Los Angeles, July 29 (Reuters): Oscar-winning director and actor Mel Gibson was arrested in Malibu for suspicion of drunken driving, an official said yesterday.

 He was arrested for suspicion of driving under the influence, said Los Angeles police spokesman Steve Whitmore.

 Gibson, 50, whose 2004 film The Passion of the Christ was a smash hit, was stopped at 2.36 am (local time) yesterday for speeding on the Pacific Coast highway, and officers smelled alcohol on his breath. He was given a sobriety test, taken into custody and released later that morning after posting $5,000 bail.

 Whitmore said Gibson was given a citation, and the matter will be reviewed by detectives to determine if drunken driving charges will be filed at a future date, Whitmore said.

 Gibsons spokesman could not be reached for comment.

 The actor rocketed to fame in the late 1970s in the movie Mad Max and scored huge box office hits playing a cop in the Lethal Weapon movies.

 In 1995, he acted in and directed Braveheart, about 13th-century Scottish rebel William Wallace. The movie earned 10 Oscar nominations and won five of the awards including directing for Gibson and best picture of the year.

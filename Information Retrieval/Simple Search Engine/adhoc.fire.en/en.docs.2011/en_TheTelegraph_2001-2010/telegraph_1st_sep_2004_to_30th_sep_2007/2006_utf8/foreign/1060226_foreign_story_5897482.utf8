 BlackBerry averts shutdown

 Washington, Feb. 25 (AFP): The maker of the BlackBerry wireless device, Research in Motion, averted a potentially catastrophic US shutdown as a judge declined to issue an injunction in a long-running patent case.

 Judge James Spencer took no action at the hearing but urged BlackBerry maker, Canadian-based RIM and patent-holding firm NTP to settle their dispute, company officials said after yesterdays hearing in Richmond, Virginia.

 NTP argued for an immediate injunction and payment of $126 million in damages. RIM, citing the US patent, urged the judge to wait. We are grateful to the court for its time, and look forward to a final outcome, NTP said.

 We presented a very strong case and believe, based on the closing remarks of Judge Spencer, that the court was receptive to the merits of our arguments. RIM chief executive James Balsillie said after the hearing that settlement talks will continue.

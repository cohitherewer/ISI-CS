 Fine Print

 Meryl feet

 Paris, Sept. 24 (Reuters): Meryl Streep, who plays a tyrannical fashion magazine editor in the film The Devil Wears Prada, does not wear shoes by the Italian fashion house.

 I own one pair of Prada shoes. They make my feet hurt, the US actress said. Its not the shoes fault: they are exquisitely made. I blame my feet. Ive got my mothers feet.

 The film is based on a best-selling book written by a former staffer at Vogue magazine.

 Cell music

 Toronto (Reuters): Its one musical performance where your cell phone can and should ring.

 US jazz composer David Baker is encouraging people to use their phones during the debut performance of Concertino for Cellular Phones and Orchestra that will open the 20th anniversary season of the Chicago Sinfonietta classical music festival next month. The audience will be asked to use their cell phones at various points with red and green lights telling them when to turn their phones on and off.

 Barber PM

 Stockholm (Reuters): Swedens new Prime Minister ended 12 years of social democratic rule in last Sundays elections and now looks set to cut short an even older tradition.

 At 41, Fredrik Reinfeldt is one of Swedens youngest Prime Ministers and sports one of the shortest hair styles. But its his do-it-yourself attitude that makes him unlikely to follow his seven predecessors to Herbert Patzers barbershop. 

 He (Reinfeldt) usually cuts his hair himself, so I dont think he (Patzer) can count on a visit, a spokesman said. Patzer has shorn the locks of every Swedish Prime Minister since the late 1960s.

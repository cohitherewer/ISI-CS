 Indonesia, China report flu deaths

 Jakarta, March 4 (Reuters): A three-year-old boy from Indonesias central Java province has died of bird flu, a senior health official said today while a man died of suspected flu in China.

 If confirmed by a UN-recognised laboratory, the boy would be Indonesias 21st death from the H5N1 virus, which is now endemic in poultry in the worlds fourth most populous nation.

 A local test of (the boy) who died yesterday or a day before yesterday, was positive, Hariadi Wibisono, director of control of animal-borne diseases at the national health ministry, said.

 A sample of the boys blood has been sent to a laboratory in Hong Kong recognised by the WHO for confirmation, he added. The boy had been in contact with fowl, according to initial information. Contact with infected birds is the most common means of transmission of the H5N1 virus to humans.

 The health department of Guangdong province and ministry of health told the Hong Kong government that a 32-year-old Chinese man developed fever and pneumonia on February 22 and died on March 2, the centre said in a statement late yesterday.

 The risk of avian influenza appearing in people in Hong Kong was also increasing, the head of the Centre for Health Protection, Leung Pak-yin, said.

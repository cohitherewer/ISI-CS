 Bonds Royale nemesis picked

 Mikkelsen: Evil genius

 Los Angeles, Feb. 16 (Reuters): The cast of Sonys Casino Royale remake is near completion.

 Mads Mikkelsen will fill the shoes of James Bond nemesis Le Chiffre, sources confirmed. The Danish actor joins Daniel Craig and Judi Dench in the Martin Campbell-directed film, which began shooting on January 27 in Prague. 

 All thats missing now is a leading lady for the martini-loving agent. The studio is expected to make an announcement within days.

 In the book, which was Ian Flemings first in the long-running series, Bond matches wits with Le Chiffre while playing high-stakes baccarat. The evil genius, also known as the Number or the Cipher, is a banker for terrorists and criminals with a penchant for torture. Baccarat is a gambling card game in which players bet against a banker. 

 Le Chiffre is rumoured to have been inspired by British occultist Aleister Crowley. Orson Welles played the role in the star-studded 1967 film adaptation of Flemings novel. 

 Mikkelsens casting had been widely expected after reports surfaced this week that the actors taxi driver father told fares that his son had won the coveted role. Mikkelsens credits include King Arthur, The Green Butchers and Wilbur Wants to Kill Himself.

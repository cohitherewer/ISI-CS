 Saddam trial

 Baghdad, April 4 (Reuters): Former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein will stand trial on new charges of genocide against Kurds in the late 1980s, the court trying him for crimes against humanity said today.

 Prosecutors said Saddam, facing possible death sentence, could be brought to account as early as next month for the killing of thousands of Kurds.

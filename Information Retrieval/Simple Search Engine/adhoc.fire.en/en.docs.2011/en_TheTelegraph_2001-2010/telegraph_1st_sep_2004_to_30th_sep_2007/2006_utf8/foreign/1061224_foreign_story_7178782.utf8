The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Britney tops

 London, Dec. 23: Britney Spears, the weather and Bebo attract the most searches on the Internet, according to the top search engines.

 Yahoo!, AOL and Google have all released their top search terms for 2006 and the lists appear to offer an eclectic guide to the interests of Web users. However, bloggers and search experts are cynical about the lists, saying they are heavily edited marketing tools. If you trust the figures, Google users are trendsetters, hunting for cutting edge websites such as Bebo, a social networking site; Metacafe, a video sharing site; and Wikipedia, the online encyclopaedia. However, a technology blog titled Techdirt says: How Web savvy can you really be if you need Google to find those sites? AOL users appear to be more traditional and practical, with the weather, dictionaries and dogs figuring in their top 10. Even the presence of tattoos in the list suggests an older audience.

 Crow splits up with Armstrong, says journal

 Armstrong: Tough decision

 Los Angeles, Feb. 4 (Reuters): Seven-time Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong and Grammy-winning pop star Sheryl Crow have split up, scrapping plans for a Texas wedding after two years of dating, People magazine reported today.

 After much thought and consideration we have made a very tough decision to split up, a joint statement by the couple issued to the magazine said. We both have a deep love and respect for each other, and we ask that everyone respect our privacy during this difficult time.

 A publicist for Crow said he was not aware of the statement and had no immediate comment. Armstrongs agent could not be immediately reached for comment.

 Crow had recently posed for Allure magazine trying on a wedding dress and had told the publication that she and Armstrong planned to marry in his hometown of Austin.

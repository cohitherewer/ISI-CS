 Fine Print

 Tacky Britney

 Los Angeles, Jan. 11 (Reuters): Britney Spears yesterday topped an annual Hollywood worst-dressed list compiled by a fashion designer who called her anover-the-hill Lolita.

 Blackwells list, which also slammed starlets Mary-Kate Olsen, Jessica Simpson, Lindsay Lohan and Paris Hilton, summed up 2005 as a particularly bad year for couture chaos, wardrobe wrecks and stylistic sleaze.

 Spears, who gave birth to her first child last year, has been a favourite on Blackwells list for the past five years. He described her yesterday as going from princess of pop to the ultimate fashion flop.

 He called Simpson, 25, a cut-rate Rapunzel slingin hash in a Vegas diner and said Lohan, 19, was drowning in grown-up groaners that added 30 years to her looks.

 Fair dummy

 Stockholm (Reuters): The first uniquely 

 female dummy for use in car safety tests is being developed 

 in Sweden, researchers said on Wednesday. All current crash 

 test dummies are based on how mens bodies react in 

 collisions and other accidents. Chalmers University of Technology 

 in Gothenburg and the National Road and Transport Research 

 Institute are researching how a female body moves as a first 

 step in building the dummy. 

 Wreck shot

 Mexico City (Reuters): Vandals who broke into and wrecked a northern Mexican primary school over the Christmas holidays were thoughtful enough to leave the photocopied mug shot of one of their gang at the scene of the crime. Mexican television showed a black-and-white print on Tuesday of the squashed, chubby face and hands of a young boy. The photocopy was made at the school in the northern city of Monterrey and left among smashed chairs and torn books. 

 Cow chase

 Salmon, Idaho (Reuters): A cow that 

 escaped last week from a Montana slaughterhouse, leading 

 workers and police on a six-hour chase, will be spared following 

 a wave of popular support, officials said on Tuesday. Del 

 Morris, manager of Mickeys Packing Plant in Great 

 Falls, said he decided to let the cow live the instant he 

 saw it cross the Missouri River through Great Falls. Town 

 residents will now decide through a poll whether the cow 

 will remain a resident of Montana, living in a pastureland, 

 or be shipped to an animal sanctuary in Seattle.

 Ill Castro speaks to officials

 Havana, Dec. 16 (Reuters): Ailing Cuban President Fidel Castro has spoken by telephone to a meeting of Cuban officials, the ruling Communist Party newspaper Granma said today in the first official word on the 80-year-old leader in 11 days.

 The commander in chief Fidel Castro spoke by telephone to a work session of the Provincial Assemblies of the Peoples Power, the newspaper said. Castro listened to a summary of discussions at the meeting held yesterday and got a warm round of applause, the newspaper said, giving no further details.

 Castro has not been seen in public since he underwent emergency surgery for intestinal bleeding that forced him to hand over power to his brother Raul Castro in late July. His absence has fuelled speculation that he is dying.

 His closest ally, Venezuelan President Hugo, said yesterday that Castro does not have cancer, but is fighting agreat battle against a very serious illness.

 US intelligence chief John Negroponte said in an interview with The Washington Post published yesterday that Castro was near death and had months, not years to live.

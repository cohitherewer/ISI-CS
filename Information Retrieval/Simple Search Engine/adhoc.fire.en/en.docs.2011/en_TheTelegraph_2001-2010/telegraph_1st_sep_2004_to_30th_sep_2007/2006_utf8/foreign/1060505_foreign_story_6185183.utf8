 Cheney in harsh attack on Russia

 Vilnius (Lithuania), May 4 (Reuters): Vice-president Dick Cheney accused Russia today of backsliding on democracy and urged it to stop using its vast energy supplies for blackmail in one of Washingtons sharpest rebukes to Moscow.

 Russia has a choice to make, Cheney told Baltic and Black Sea leaders at a summit in Vilnius, calling on Moscow to return to democratic reform at a time of increasingly chilly relations between the two former Cold War rivals.

 However, the Kremlin in Moscow rejected Cheneys remarks as completely incomprehensible.

 The speech of Cheney in our opinion is full of a subjective evaluation of us and of the processes that are going on in Russia. The remarks ... are completely incomprehensible for us, said Kremlin deputy spokesman Dmitry Peskov.

 Cheney also took aim at Moscows power politics with its energy reserves at a time of record world prices, a trend Washington says Russia is using to bully its neighbours.

 Cheneys harsh remarks could further antagonise Russia, which holds a veto in the UN Security Council where Washington intends to push a resolution demanding that Iran curb its nuclear ambitions. It could also lead to tense moments when Russian President Vladimir Putin hosts his first summit of the G-8 industrialised nations in July.

 China in spring flu fear

 Beijing, March 16 (Reuters): China faces an uphill struggle to contain bird flu ahead of an expected spike in infections during spring, hampered by surveillance problems, ignorance and the countrys sheer size, health and government officials said.

 Though China is taking the health risks seriously and has learnt its lesson from Sars, when an initial cover up of the respiratory disease in 2003 led to panic, much work remains to be done, they said.

 Few doubt the seriousness of the situation, especially as spring is arriving and migrating birds, some of them believed to be carriers of the H5N1 avian flu virus, are heading back north to their summer nesting grounds.

 Chinas agriculture minister, Du Qinglin, last month warned of a massive threat from bird flu in a country where 10 people have died from the H5N1 strain and there have been more than 30 poultry outbreaks in a dozen provinces in the past year.

 Now the virus is becoming crazy. The virus is becoming unpredictable, said Noureddin Mona, the Food and Agriculture Organisations representative in Beijing, referring to bird flus rapid spread in recent weeks deep into Europe, Africa and other parts of Asia.

 They are doing their best, he added, speaking of Chinas efforts to contain the virus, which has killed about 100 people in Asia and West Asia since 2003.

 Yet experts say with only half of Chinas population able to afford health care, sick people might not even go to a doctor, which could mask human cases.

 The surveillance system depends on people showing up in hospitals or health care centres. The ministry of health recognises this is an issue, said Julie Hall, who oversees the World Health Organisations fight against bird flu in China. But they admit investigative capacity at the grass roots level does require strengthening, she said.

 Human cases now being reported in areas with no apparent poultry outbreaks is another concern.

 For example, earlier this month experts began questioning if apparently healthy but infected birds might be the culprit when a man died in Guangdong province after visiting several poultry markets to carry out a market survey.

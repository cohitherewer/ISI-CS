 Subway foot freak

 New York, May 13 (Reuters): A 23-year-old with a foot fetish has admitted he tried to kiss, fondle and lick the legs and toes of more than 70 women on the New York subway over the last three years, prosecutors said on Wednesday.

 In a handwritten confession to police released by 

the Manhattan district attorneys office, Joseph Weir said his aim was to 

make them laugh and smile and open to talk to me. Weir, who was arrested 

late last week after attacking a woman on a subway in lower Manhattan, is charged 

with forcible touching, sex abuse and unlawful imprisonment ? the latter charge 

referring to his habit of grabbing his victims legs and not letting go. 

 In a rambling confession, Weir, who lives in Brooklyn, 

detailed how he accosted the women while riding the subways between Manhattan 

and the borough of Queens. 

Ghastly toothpicks

 London (Reuters): More than 

 60 per cent of Britons use items such as screwdrivers, scissors 

 and earrings to remove food from between their teeth, according 

 to a survey published on Friday. The National Dental Survey 

 found that, when it came to oral hygiene, people used whatever 

 was close to hand to pick their teeth. More than 60 per 

 cent questioned by the British Dental Health Foundation 

 said they used makeshift items, including knives, keys, 

 needles and forks.

 Scooterist menaces town

 Berlin (Reuters): A man on a scooter 

 menaced a German town until angry locals performed a citizens 

 arrest on him at the scene of his third crash in two hours, 

 police said on Friday. The 22-year-old man first crashed 

 the scooter as he took a corner in the western town of Herzogenrath, 

 losing his helmet in the process, police in nearby Aachen 

 said. Unfazed, the man remounted and ploughed straight into 

 the back of a parked car. He flew head over heels through 

 the back window, landing inside and causing some 2,000 euros 

 in damage.

 Fine Print

 No job haircut

 Berlin, Dec. 19 (Reuters): An unemployed mason famously told to get a haircut by the head of Germanys Centre-Left Social Democrats (SPD) has turned down a personal invitation to receive job offers, Bild newspaper reported today.

 SPD chairman Kurt Beck had told Henrico Frank he would help him find work if he got a haircut after Frank berated him in public about cutbacks in unemployment benefits.

 Frank got a haircut, shaved his straggly beard and also removed two nose rings. But he turned down Becks personal invitation to meet him at his office in Mainz, where Beck had lined up eight job offers with local companies.

 Hot burger

 Jakarta (Reuters): A hotel in Indonesia is dishing out a hamburger that costs more than twice the monthly minimum wage in some parts of the country. The $110 hamburger offered by the Four Seasons is made of Kobe beef with foie gras, Portobello mushrooms and Korean pears served with french fries, of course. Theyre not exactly selling like hotcakes yet, but the hotel says it has sold 20 of the 1 million rupiah ($110.1) hamburgers since they were launched this month. 

 Hit spoof

 Jerusalem (AP): Like moviegoing masses around the world, Israelis have crowded theatres to watch the hit spoof Borat. But they are laughing for another reason: They actually understand that the anti-Semitic Kazakh journalist is not speaking Kazakh, but rather Hebrew.

 Army out in Kathmandu to tackle rising crime

 Kathmandu, May 29 (AP): Nepalese troops patrolled the streets of Kathmandu today and were stationed around the citys perimetre to help police control rising crime amid a spate of armed robberies and murders, officials said.

 Our soldiers have begun normal patrolling in the key areas under standard operating procedure, Nepal Army spokesman Brigadier General Nepal Bhusan Chand said.

 A spike in criminal activity in Kathmandu in recent days, including armed robberies and murders, prompted the army to help the police, Chand said.

 The army has been largely inactive since King Gyanendra gave up his control of the country and military last month and appointed a new government following weeks of violent protests against his rule. Since then, the government has joined a ceasefire and peace talks with communist rebels.

 Parliament already has approved a government proposal stripping King Gyanendra of his supreme command of the army, and has changed the name of the Royal Nepalese Army to the Nepal Army.

 Troops began patrolling the streets of Kathmandu last evening just after army chief General Pyarjung Thapa, in his first public comments since the change of power, said they would support and obey the new government.

 Nepal Army is committed to following the directives of the Nepal government, which is moving ahead with the objectives of creating a prosperous Nepal by strengthening multi-party democracy

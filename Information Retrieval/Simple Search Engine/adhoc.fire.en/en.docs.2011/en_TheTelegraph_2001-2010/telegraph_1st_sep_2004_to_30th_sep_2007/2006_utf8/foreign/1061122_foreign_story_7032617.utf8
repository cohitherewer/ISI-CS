 Ex-spy poisoning radioactive: Doctor

 London, Nov. 21 (Reuters): A former Russian spy fighting for his life in a British hospital may have been poisoned by a radioactive substance which he probably swallowed, the toxicologist treating him said today.

 Russia has dismissed claims that its security agents may have poisoned former agent Alexander Litvinenko, 41, a persistent critic of President Vladimir Putin, to try to silence him. But friends say he is the victim of a Kremlin-backed plot.

 Britains anti-terrorism police are investigating the case, which could have far-reaching consequences for diplomatic relations at a time of mounting concern in the West over Moscows human rights record.

 Toxicologist John Henry, who is treating Litvinenko for thallium poisoning, said he now thought the poison was swallowed and may have been in a yet more deadly radioactive form.

 Mr Litvinenko has got some symptoms consistent with thallium poisoning, and he has also got symptoms consistent with some other type of poisoning so its not 100 percent thallium, Henry said outside University College Hospital (UCH) where the former spy is in intensive care. It could be radioactive thallium.

 Litvinenko said he fell ill after meeting a source at a London sushi restaurant while investigating the killing of Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya, another vocal Putin critic gunned down at her Moscow apartment last month. Litvinenko checked into a hospital in early November after falling ill and was moved to UCH when his condition worsened.

 Toxicology reports show he was poisoned by thallium, a chemical element that can cause a slow, painful death over the course of weeks or months, even with treatment. 

 Henry said the possibility that the poison may have been radioactive adds a new dimension to the case.

 He also said doctors may never know the exact composition of the poison. It may be too late, Henry said. 

 If it was a radioactive poison with a short half-life, it may have gone. Radioactive thallium degrades very rapidly, so that by now we have missed the chance (to detect it).

 Alexander Goldfarb, a Russian dissident and close friend of Litvinenko, repeated his claim that Litvinenko was poisoned in a Kremlin-backed operation of Russian intelligence services.

 Moscow has dismissed such claims as pure nonsense and today its foreign intelligence service said it wished Litvinenko a speedy recovery.

 Litvinenko, now a British citizen, co-authored a book in 2002 entitled Blowing up Russia: Terror from Within, in which he alleged Federal Security Service agents co-ordinated apartment block bombings in Russia that killed more than 300 people in 1999.

 Kiss goodbye to gossip, if celebrities have their way

 London, Feb. 12: The revelation that Ralph Fiennes had cheated on his older lover, Francesca Annis, with a Romanian singer was an archetypal kiss-and-tell story. 

 Cornelia Crisans tales of champagne-fuelled sexual encounters with the star of Schindlers List were lapped up by newspapers. An unexpected fall-out, however, may be the beginning of the end for the celebrity gossip tale. 

 Annis, who starred in Roman Polanskis Macbeth and opposite Johnny Depp in The Libertine, is following in the footsteps of Naomi Campbell and Princess Caroline of Monaco and is taking legal action to protect her right to privacy. 

 The actress, who fell in love with Fiennes in 1995 during a production of Hamlet, has taken offence at a daily newspaper story that claimed to detail her own reaction to Fienness sexual liaisons at the Dorchester Hotel, London. 

 She has asked lawyers to sue for defamation and invasion of privacy. But significantly, she claims breach of privacy while maintaining that the comments attributed to her and her friends in the Daily Mail story were not even true. 

 Anniss action is also unusual because she has complained post-publication. Most complaints are now lodged prior to publication to ensure that intrusive stories never see the light of day. 

 Legal complaints based around the right to privacy were virtually unheard of five years ago. Now they are rapidly replacing libel actions as a celebritys most effective defence against an intrusive press. Campbell successfully sued the Daily Mirror for breach of confidence after it printed pictures of her outside a drug addiction clinic. 

 Lawyers say the traditional idea that people who court publicity for a living have thereby forfeited their right to privacy is dead in the water. The balance of power, which used to be strongly tilted in favour of the press, has been upset by the introduction of the Human Rights Act 1998. 

 Even seemingly harmless intrusions could cost papers dearly. In 2004, Princess Caroline of Monaco successfully complained about a breach of privacy to the European Court of Human Rights after pictures of her shopping and skiing appeared in a German newspaper. 

 Last year the Sunday Telegraph revealed Prince William was studying the implications of the case with regard to the privacy of himself and his girlfriend Kate Middleton. 

 But it is an action brought to the high court by the Canadian folk singer Loreena McKennitt, which most alarms newspapers. In December last year, McKennitt brought an action for breach of confidence against her friend Niema Ash over publication of the book Travels with Loreena McKennitt: My Life as a Friend. Her victory in the case has sent shock waves through the legal profession and has already led to expos?s on other celebrities being spiked. 

 Justice Eady ruled that not only were readers not entitled to know everything about celebrities but that newspapers could not justify publication merely by citing an accusation of hypocrisy. 

 Philip Conway, a lawyer with Davenport Lyons, which acts for some leading newspapers, said that such rulings were already making their presence felt. It is having an impact on the world of kiss-and-tell and these kinds of stories are going to get more and more difficult, he said.

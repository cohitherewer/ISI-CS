 US, Europe seal deal on passenger data

 Luxembourg, Oct. 6 (Reuters): The US and Europe clinched a deal today giving US law enforcement agencies easier access to personal data on transatlantic air passengers to fight terrorism, ending a legal limbo for airlines. 

 The EUs top court struck down an existing agreement after a challenge by the European Parliament out of concern to protect privacy. The invalidated accord expired last Saturday, creating a legal vacuum which airlines feared could expose them to breach of privacy suits. 

 This new agreement will provide a possibility of giving passenger data to the US authorities while guaranteeing sufficient data protection according to the commitment of the American customs and border control authorities, quot; Finnish justice minister Leena Luhtanen said. 

 European airlines must pass on 34 items of data, including passenger addresses, telephone numbers and credit card details, to be allowed to land at US airports. The new pact, which EU governments should formally approve next week, will apply only until July 2007. The two sides will negotiate a long-term agreement in the meantime. 

 EU justice and security commissioner Franco Frattini said the new deal would make it easier for US agencies to obtain the information without giving them automatic electronic access.

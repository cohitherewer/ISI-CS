 Claudias dogs terrify village

 Canine mayhem 

 London, Sept. 8: Dogs belonging 

 to the model Claudia Schiffer and her film producer husband 

 are causing mayhem in a quiet village, claim residents.

 The police say they want to speak to Schiffer and Matthew Vaughn after complaints to the parish council that their German shepherd and Irish wolfhound attack other dogs and terrify villagers using a public footpath alongside their Elizabethan manor house.

 Oscar, the German shepherd, has taken a nip at the postman and is accused of chasing a deer.

 Most of the problems, however, stem from the footpath running along the front wall of the 5 million house, Coldham Hall, in Stanningfield, Suffolk. 

 The couple have tried, and failed, to get it closed. It was on this path that Roxy, the wolfhound, attacked an elderly Jack Russell being walked by its owner and her grandchildren. The dog was seriously injured but recovered after surgery costing several hundred pounds, which the couple paid for.

 The Jack Russells owner complained to the police, resulting in a visit by an officer to Coldham Hall. Some locals claim they are too scared to use the footpath that goes along the houses 600-yard drive and across the 40 acres of parkland.

 Several villagers have written to complain to Schiffer, 36, and Vaughn, 35, who produced the Guy Ritchie films Snatch and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. 

 The couple, however, insist the dogs are now under control. A spokesman for Schiffer said: It was taken very seriously. The household has taken various precautions to ensure public safety. This included sending the dogs for re-training and keeping them in an enclosed area.

 But a villager said: The dogs are still getting out and can be quite aggressive. The wolfhound is worse because it is the size of a small pony. She charges at people barking and puts her head close to yours.

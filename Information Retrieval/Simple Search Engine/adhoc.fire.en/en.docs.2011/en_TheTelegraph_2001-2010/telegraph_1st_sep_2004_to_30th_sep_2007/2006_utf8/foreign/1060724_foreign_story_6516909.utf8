 Washington on crime emergency

 Unsafe capital, Mr President? (Reuters)

 Washington, July 23: Police in Americas capital city have ordered young people below the age of 16 to remain indoors after 10 pm ? even on weekends ? as part of a crime emergency that has been declared in Washington to combat a crisis caused by murder, robberies and sexual assaults on the streets.

 Ninety-six people have been killed in Washington this year till July 18, while 2,140 people have been robbed on the citys streets. Another 1,862 people have been attacked with deadly weapons and 170 women have been sexually assaulted during the same period.

 Washingtons police chief Charles Ramsey declared the emergency after the sensational murder a few days ago of Alan Senitt, a 27-year-old visiting Briton, whose throat was slit while walking a woman friend home in the capitals fashionable Georgetown area. Senitts friend was nearly raped in the incident.

 A day earlier, Chris Crowder, 44, a black community activist and mayoral aspirant, who was paralysed from the waist down and on a wheelchair, was shot seven times in a city park.

 What has alarmed Washingtons mayor and Ramsey is that robberies and sexual assaults have lately spread to areas frequented by tourists, which were hitherto considered safe.

 Along the National Mall, which houses most of this citys famed museums and monuments, a stones throw from the Capitol, hold-ups and attempted rapes have become daily occurrences.

 For the first time, Washington city authorities began installing surveillance cameras in residential areas in response to the rise in crime. The cameras will be recording 24 hours a day.

 But the police chief has more than crime on his hands to deal with. The very day he declared a crime emergency, Ramsey was forced to transfer a senior police official for making a racially insensitive remark at a community meeting in Georgetown that was called to bolster the confidence of residents.

 Asking the crowd to report suspicious-looking people in their neighbourhood, Solberg, the commander of the 2nd Police District, said: This is not a racial thing to say that black people are unusual in Georgetown. This is a fact of life.

 Rising crime is a nation-wide problem in America. In the first half of this year, the tourist magnet of Orlando witnessed 33 murders, more than its usual annual total for several years. Jacksoville retained its dubious reputation as Floridas murder capital for 12 of the past 17 years with 130 murders last year, according to FBI statistics.

 In Washington, mayor Anthony Williams yesterday signed into law an emergency crime bill, which will enable prosecutors to have robbery suspects held without bail and try more upper-age teenagers as adults for violent crime.

 He has also formed a new Violent Crime Task Force, which will include the local police, the FBI and the US Attorneys Office.

 They are together planning a Violent Crime Summit here in the next 60 days.

 Merkel riddle

 Berlin, Nov. 20 (Reuters): German Chancellor Angela Merkel was concerned about a group of visitors to her chancellery who refused to say who they were until an adviser told her they were intelligence agents.

 Merkel encountered the group touring her office building recently. She walked over to them and asked in German: Where are you from? Bild am Sonntag newspaper reported yesterday.

 No one answered her friendly query so she asked again in English. Surprised by their silence, she was about to try a third time in Russian when a member of her staff solved the riddle by explaining to her they were from Germanys Bundesnachrichtendienst spy agency.

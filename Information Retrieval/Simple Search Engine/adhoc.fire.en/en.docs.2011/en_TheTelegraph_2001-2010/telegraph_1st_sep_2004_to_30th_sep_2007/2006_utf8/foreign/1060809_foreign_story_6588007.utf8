 Joint Nepal letter to UN planned

 J. HEMANTH

 Kathmandu, Aug 8: The Nepal government today announced that a joint letter, bearing the signatures of Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala and Maoist chief Prachanda, would be sent to the UN tomorrow asking the world body to monitor the arms of the Nepal Army and the Maoist rebels during the coming elections.

 The announcement was made at the Kathmandu press club today by the minister for culture, tourism and civil aviation, Pradip Gyawali. He said 

 Koirala had urged the governments talks team to reach a consensus with the Maoists on the arms issue and finalise the letter by tomorrow afternoon. 

 The government announcement comes a day after the Maoists criticised Koirala for advising a role for King Gyanendra in the new political set-up. The rebels also said that the Prime Ministers comments had put a question mark over the peace process.

 Even as the newspapers played up the Maoist comments this morning, Koirala convened a high-level meeting with senior army officials to discuss the management and monitoring of arms.

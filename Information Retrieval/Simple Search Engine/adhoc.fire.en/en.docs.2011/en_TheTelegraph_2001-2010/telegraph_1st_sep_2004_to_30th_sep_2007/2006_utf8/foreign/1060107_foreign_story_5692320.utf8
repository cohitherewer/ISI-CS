 Exclusive US club Tigerless

 HARRY MOUNT

 Woods: Too famous

 London, Jan. 6: Tiger Woods is buying a 10-acre Florida waterfront estate for ?23 million but is unlikely to be made welcome at the local golf club.

 Woods, 30 last week, is certainly the worlds best golfer but it is still doubtful that the ultra-exclusive Jupiter Island Golf Club will invite him to be a member. Theres a long list and membership is by invitation only, said Debbie Squires, membership secretary at the club.

 One of his new neighbours, who did not want to be named, thought the chances that Woods would ever be asked to join remote: No way. They dont want anybody famous. Woods will be able to play on the course but only as a guest. In the past he has practised on the idyllic course, on a barrier island bounded by the Indian river to the west, the Atlantic to the east, a wildlife refuge to the north and the Blowing Rocks preserve to the south. 

 Also out of Woodss reach will be the clubs 14 tennis courts, gym, saltwater pool, game-fishing facilities and its guesthouses and cottages along the ocean front and river. Woods had better treatment at his previous home in Orlando, also in Florida. 

 The Isleworth Country Club not only welcomed his membership but modified the golf course for him. 

 But on Jupiter Island, north of Miami, he will just have to be content with all the lavish non-golfing facilities his new home provides. It may lack an accessible golf club but it is still right at the heart of what Forbes magazine calls The Worlds Most Expensive Zip Code.

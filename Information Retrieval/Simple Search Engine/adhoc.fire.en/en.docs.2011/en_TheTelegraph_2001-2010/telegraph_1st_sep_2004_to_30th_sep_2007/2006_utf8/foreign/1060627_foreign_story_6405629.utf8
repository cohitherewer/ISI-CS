 Plants pay for lack of soccer loos

 London, June 26 (PTI): The scarcity of toilets for millions of football fans in Germany is proving costly for plant life in the country.

 World Cup organisers seem to have miscalculated the number of toilets needed, providing just 280 Port-A-Loos for more than 700,000 fans who congregate on the fan mile in Berlin to watch matches on giant screens. As a result, thousands of fans are resorting to emergency measures ? peeing in the surrounding bushes.

 Biologists have warned that plant and tree life in the area is in serious danger because of the 100,000 litres of urine being dumped every day.

 The urea sinks into the ground as ammonia. In small quantities this is a good fertiliser. But too much acidity is bad for the soil, biologist Tilman Lamparter of Berlins Free University said.

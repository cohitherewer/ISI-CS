 Taiwan scraps reunification panel

 Taipei, Feb. 27 (Reuters): Taiwan President Chen Shui-bian scrapped today a policy-making body on unification with China and 15-year-old symbolic guidelines on eventual unification, a move that has riled Beijing and alarmed Washington.

 While the move was almost certain to complicate reunion and fuel tensions, Chen said it did not mean Taiwan would push for formal independence.

 Taiwan has no intention of changing the status quo and firmly opposes any use of non-peaceful means that will cause the status quo to change, Chen said after a meeting with his top national security advisers.

 Chen, keen to shake off Beijings claim of sovereignty over the self-ruled island, declared the National Unification Council has ceased to function and guidelines on unification have ceased to apply.

 Chinese newspapers published a statement by the policy-making Taiwan Affairs Office today, warning the move would certainly spark a serious crisis in the Taiwan Strait and sabotage peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region.

 Beijing and Taipei split at the end of their civil war in 1949, but China regards Taiwan as sovereign territory and threatens force to return it to the fold.

 We dont think there will be immediate conflict between Taiwan and mainland China, but it will put increasing pressure on Taiwan against declaring independence, George Leung, chief economist for Greater China at HSBC in Hong Kong, said.

 If Taiwan continues to take unilateral action, pressure will be piled upon it, even from the US, Leung said.

 Taiwans stocks and currency rebounded today after falling last week over Chens expected move. But local businessmen, who have poured up to $100 billion into China, remained nervous over repercussions.

 I dont understand why he tries to stir up cross-Strait tensions and make our lives difficult, said Tony Cheng, a Taiwan businessman in Chinas southern coastal city of Shenzhen.

 The Taiwan Affairs Office statement did not say whether China would view the scrapping of the council and its guidelines as a declaration of formal independence, but it did say China would exert its utmost effort and sincerity to achieve peaceful unification.

 Chinas parliament passed an Anti-Secession Law in March last year, authorising war if the island formally declared statehood. Chens plan to scrap the council has alarmed the US, which has warned both sides not to rock the boat in what is potentially one of Asias most dangerous flashpoints.

 Kims back in Eminems life

singer reunites with former wife 

 Kim

 Rochester Hills, Michigan, Jan. 15 (Reuters): Rapper Eminem and his former wife remarried yesterday, five years after an ugly divorce ruptured their turbulent relationship.

 Eminem, whose real name is Marshall Mathers III, and Kimberly Mathers exchanged vows in a small and tightly guarded ceremony at Meadow Brook Hall in Rochester Hills, near Detroit.

 Journalists and fans crowded the entrance to the grounds around the hall as guests began arriving in the afternoon.

 Little information was available from inside but Eminems publicist, Dennis Dennehy, confirmed that the wedding had taken place.

 Among other guests, rapper 50 Cents G-Unit hip-hop group arrived in an entourage of four sport utility vehicles.

 Eminem, 33, arrived in a black limousine, sporting a red baseball hat.

 The hip-hop superstar, whose 2000 hit Kim is a graphic rap fantasy about his wifes death, told a Detroit radio station last month the couple had reconciled and would probably remarry.

 The Mathers first married in 1999 and their divorce, which prompted a custody battle over their 10-year-old daughter, was finalised in 2001.

 Last year, Eminem was treated for addiction to a sleep medication and had to cancel his European tour. His greatest hits collection, Curtain Call, was released in December.

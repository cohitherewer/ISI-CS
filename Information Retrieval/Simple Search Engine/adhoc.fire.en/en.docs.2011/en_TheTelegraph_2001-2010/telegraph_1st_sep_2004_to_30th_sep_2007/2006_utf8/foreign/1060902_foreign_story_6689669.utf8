 Mexico braces for hurricane

 Los Cabos (Mexico), Sept. 1 (Reuters): Powerful Hurricane John roared toward one of Mexicos most exclusive beach resorts today, forcing hundreds of foreign tourists to flee ahead of howling winds, angry seas and lashing rain.

 Five-star hotels set up refugee shelters for mostly US guests who abandoned plans to play golf, swim or go boating at the Los Cabos resort in Baja California.

 John picked up power overnight to become a dangerous category 3 storm and was expected to brush the corner of the peninsula to the west of Los Cabos later in the day.

 Rescue workers evacuated hundreds of residents from low-lying areas to temporary shelters and said they may send more away from the danger area.

 Many vacationers took no chances and flew home, creating long lines at Los Cabos airport. Others waited in their hotels.

 American sports fisherman Randy Hinton, 42, facing his fourth hurricane in Los Cabos where he comes every three weeks, said he had moored his brand new million-dollar yacht in the town marina, hoping it would be safe.

 If mother nature wants to take it then let her take it. Im not going to die for it, he said.

 Stores had boarded up windows and municipal authorities banned the sale of alcohol.

 Were prepared, said 17-year-old hotel cleaner Benjamin de la Cruz as he walked to work. Residents lined up to buy food, water and petrol as drizzle fell on the resort, made up of the towns of Cabo San Lucas and San Jose del Cabo. Theres a bit of panic, said a senior Red Cross official.

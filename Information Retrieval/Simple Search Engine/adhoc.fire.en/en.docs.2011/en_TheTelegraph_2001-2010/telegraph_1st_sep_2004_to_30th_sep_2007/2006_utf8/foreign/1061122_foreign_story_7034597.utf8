 Dhaka, Nov. 21 (Reuters): Three people were killed and around 150 wounded in clashes between rival activists in Bangladesh today although officials said the political crisis gripping the country could soon be resolved.

 The casualties occurred across the country as a transport blockade called by a 14-party alliance demanding the removal of election commission officials paralysed the country for the second straight day.

 Two men were killed and 30 others were wounded at Patiya town near Chittagong. Nearly 50 more were hurt in the Pahartali suburb of the port city, where police quelled the violence by using batons and tear gas.

 A third man died in southern Laxmipur district town.

 Fighting also broke out at Dhaka University in which several students were wounded, police said.

 In Bogra town, 250 km north of Dhaka, police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse stick-wielding and stone-throwing rival activists. More than 40 people were hurt.

 But demands that chief election commissioner M.A. Aziz and his deputies quit ahead of a January election were bolstered after government advisers negotiating a way out said they could now see light at the end of the tunnel.

 The negotiators, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said it was likely that Aziz would meet President Iajuddin Ahmed and either quit or go abroad on leave.

 A solution is possible within 24 to 48 hours from now, Mahbubul Alam, adviser in charge of the information ministry, said late yesterday.

 The transport blockade was called by an alliance led by Sheikh Hasina, chief of the Awami League, who says a January general election cannot be free and fair under the current election officials.

 The Bangladesh Nationalist Party of Begum Khaleda Zia, who resigned as Prime Minister last month at the end of her five-year mandate, has opposed the demand.

 In a statement today, Hasina accused the BNP and its ally Jamaat-e-Islami of conspiring to foil the coming election.

 I hope the caretaker government would soon remove the controversial election officials, heeding to popular demands, Hasina said.

 Under Bangladesh law, elections are conducted by a caretaker government in this case headed by the President. 

 But Hasina has alleged that Iajuddin had not yet proved his neutrality and was being dictated to by Khaleda.

 The alliance also accuses election commissioner Aziz and his deputies of being biased towards Khaleda and her BNP. The BNP has refuted the alliances charge. It has asked the President not to listen to Hasina and has also demanded the immediate announcement of a timetable for the election.

 The President yesterday sent three of his advisers to the election commission to seek a way out of the impasse.

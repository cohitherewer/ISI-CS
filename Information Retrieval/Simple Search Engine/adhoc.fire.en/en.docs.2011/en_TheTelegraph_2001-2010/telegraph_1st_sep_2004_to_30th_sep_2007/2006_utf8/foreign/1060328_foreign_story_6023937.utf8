 Condi plays golf with Wie

 Washington, March 27 (AFP): The worlds second-ranking woman golfer, Michelle Wie, recently played with Condoleezza Rice and said the US secretary of state uses her driver really well, Time magazine reported in its latest issue.

 I cant believe I played nine holes with her, the 16-year-old golfing sensation said. She said that she had been in charge of driving Rice around in a golf cart.

 I was like, If I crash, the secretary of state goes down with me, Wie said.

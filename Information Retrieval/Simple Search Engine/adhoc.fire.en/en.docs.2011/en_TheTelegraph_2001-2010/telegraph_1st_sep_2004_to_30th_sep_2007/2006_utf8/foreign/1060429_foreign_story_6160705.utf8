 Clooney urges action in Darfur

 Washington, April 28 (Reuters): Joined by senators from the Left and Right, Oscar-winning actor George Clooney used his star power yesterday to focus attention on Sudans Darfur region, where he said the first genocide of this century was taking place.

 Clooney told heart-breaking stories of visiting the border area between Chad and Sudans Darfur region last week, where he watched refugees spilling into sordid camps and women foraging for food who faced the threat of rape or death. Clooney urged the public to attend rallies across the US this Sunday to pressure Khartoum to stop what Washington says amounts to genocide in Darfur.

 Hollywood actors, political, religious leaders and sporting personalities will be among those at the rallies, which are expected to draw hundreds of people.

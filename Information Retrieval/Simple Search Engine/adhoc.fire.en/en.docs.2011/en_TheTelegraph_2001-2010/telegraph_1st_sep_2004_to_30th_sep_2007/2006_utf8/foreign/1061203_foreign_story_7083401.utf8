 Blair call to lift condom ban

 JONATHAN PETRE

 Reality Check

 London, Dec. 2: Prime Minister Tony Blair risked a confrontation with the Roman Catholic Church yesterday by saying that religious leaders needed to face up to reality and drop their ban on condoms if they were to fight AIDS effectively.

 Blair also disclosed that he and his wife Cherie, a Roman Catholic, had warned their children about the dangers of unprotected sex.

 His comments on condoms will be seen as a strong attack on the Vatican, which has so far refused to relax its ban on the use of artificial contraception.

 Pope Benedict XVI has, however, ordered a review of the Churchs stance on condom use by those with AIDS after senior cardinals described them as the lesser evil in some circumstances.

 Blair said in an interview with the MTV music channel for World AIDS Day: I think if all the Churches and religious organisations were facing up to reality, it would be better.

 The danger is if we have a sort of blanket ban coming from the religious hierarchy saying its wrong to do it, then you discourage people from doing it in circumstances where they need to protect their own lives.

 The danger of them not doing so is that you get people who are sexually active and sometimes in circumstances where they may be forced into the sex trade, for example.

 The Prime Minister said that the government would increase the number of condoms being distributed.

 We are spending 1.5 billion over the next few years, trying to fight AIDS, he said. It is also very important that we work on prevention and we are planning to uplift the amount of condoms that we will be distributing too.

 They may be sex workers, they may be women in a difficult situation. If they dont get that help, theres no point in being prissy about it if they dont get the help then they end up with AIDS.

 But the traditional birds and bees talk had changed since his generation.I think what it is about now is telling them about the dangers of having unprotected sex.

 Tehran to UN: Rein in US

 Tehran, May 1 (Reuters): Iran today called on the UN to stop the US threatening the Islamic Republic with a military attack against its nuclear programme, the official Irna news agency said.

 Irans ambassador to the UN, Javad Zarif, sent a letter to UN secretary general Kofi Annan, calling on him to take immediate measures against illegal and reckless threats by US officials, the agency said. The UNs past negligence in responding to these illegal and unjustifiable threats is regrettable.

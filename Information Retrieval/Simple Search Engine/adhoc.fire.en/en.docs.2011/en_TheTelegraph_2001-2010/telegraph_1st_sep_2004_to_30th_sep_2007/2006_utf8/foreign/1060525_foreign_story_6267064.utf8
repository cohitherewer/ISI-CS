 Kunming (China), May 24: The environmentally reckless development of Chinas provincial cities, such as this scenic capital of southern Yunnan province, is devastating vast swathes of the country, especially its lakes and rivers. 

 Over the last decade this sleepy city, that had just 1.5 million residents in 1995, has been transformed by local planners into a regional metropolis where more than 6 million people are expected to live by 2010. 

 But the clumsiness with which this and other similar GDP-growth-triggering projects have been implemented across China is forcing Beijing to reconsider its development priorities.

 An environmental crisis is coming to China earlier than expected, especially water pollution, said Pan Yue, the vice-chairman of Chinas State Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA) in Beijing. Two-fifths of the seven major rivers basins in China are basically polluted, and 90 per cent of rivers running through cities suffer from very severe pollution problems. We will face tremendous problems if we do not change our development patterns.

 However, the actions of many local and provincial governments continue to fly in the face of such concerns in Beijing, underlining how the central government is losing control of provincial party bosses who now rule their fiefdoms with the same impunity as the mandarins of ancient times.

 For example, SEPA has been pushing local governments to clean up polluted sites but authorities in Yunnan continue to allow local factories to dump untreated waste into the Dian lake 16 km south, which was once the main source of all Kunmings drinking water.

 Even Kunmings city government, squeezed as all other local governments are by reductions in direct financial support from Beijing, has stopped treating the sewage it empties into the lake, said Yu Xiao Gang, director of Green Watershed, a local environmental NGO. 

 As a result, Dian Lake has been turned into a cesspool of sewage and toxic waste. The stench from its water is so strong that it smothers the area around it. 

 Villagers along Dians shores say the death of the lake that once gave them most of their livelihood has cast a long shadow over their lives. 

 We catch less fish in the lake now,said Wang Cheng, 40, as he emptied a pail of live carp-like fish into a concrete fish tank at a local store. Sales have also gone down quite a bit as people think theyll have health problems if they eat fish from here.

 Significantly, though there are six water-treatment plants along Dians shore that could mitigate a lot of these problems, none of them are being used. The government says it doesnt have the money to operate them, said Yu. Therere like giant showpieces and only switched on when investors or officials from Beijing visit.

The reason such mismanagement of environmental problems 

are roiling China is because local people are still denied a real voice in governance, 

he added.

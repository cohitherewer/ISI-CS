 San Francisco, July 15 (AP): 

 Wistful music plays in a darkened room as visitors file 

 past glass cases displaying the remains of a tragedy.

 The items may seem unremarkable at first ? a pair of old-fashioned spectacles, a battered bowler hat ? but these are relics from the Titanic, material links to the human side of that iconic event.

 Its just a story that has thousands of human stories inside it, said John Zaller, designer of Titanic: The Artifact Exhibition, which recently sailed into San Francisco.

 Six years shy of its centennial, it would seem that everything has already been said about the April 15, 1912, sinking of the practically unsinkable Titanic. But while other disasters have faded quietly into the pages of history, Titanic lives on.

 Every element of what it means to be human is encapsulated in that vessel after the iceberg hits, said Zaller. Every human emotion is evoked in the decision of whether you get in the lifeboat or whether you stay behind ? how you say your goodbyes and how you meet your end.

 The show, which runs here till September, highlights the human element, handing out replica boarding passes at the entrance that carry a short biographical sketch of an actual passenger.

 The tour begins with the sombre room displaying personal belongings recovered from the ship. Around a corner, the mood is brighter as period music plays and posters, written descriptions and a replica deck of authentically squeaky planks highlight the planning and construction of the ship.

 A reproduction of the grand staircase, similar to one that figured in the 1997 James Cameron movie, highlights the glamour of the ship. 

 The exhibition was created by RMS Titanic Inc., a company formed under a 1994 federal court ruling to explore and salvage the wreck of the Titanic.

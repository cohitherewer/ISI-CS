 Fine Print

 Caught by call

 Stockholm, Jan. 3 (Reuters): Swedish police caught a burglar after he answered a phone he had just stolen and did not hang up, letting them eavesdrop on his getaway ride in a taxi.

 The man broke into a house in Overtornea in the far north of Sweden, stealing a mobile phone and other possessions.

 The police rang the stolen phone and heard him swearing about the late arrival of a taxi which he had ordered to take him to neighbouring Kalix, 60 km away.

 The thief answered the phone but then just put it away without turning it off, said Overtornea policeman Kurt Paavola. 

 Tasty raid

 Washington (AP): Lewis had gourmet taste: 

 whenever the dry season browned grass in his Kenyan sanctuary, 

 he would abandon the other elephants and race 40 km to the 

 mountains ? to raid farmers corn fields under cover 

 of night. A 30-cm-long hair plucked from his tail, and GPS 

 technology, tell the story. Its a new way to track 

 elephants dietary needs and roaming habits that scientists 

 hope ultimately could help the endangered species survive.

 Lion rules

 Los Angeles (Reuters): The family fantasy The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe returned to the top of the North American box office during the New Year holiday weekend, ending the two-week reign of King Kong, according to studio estimates issued on Monday.

 Burqa bar on 2 Bonn girls

 Dusseldorf (Germany), April 28 (Reuters): A high school in the German city of Bonn has suspended two Muslim girls for wearing burqas, an all-enveloping cloak worn by women in central Asia, an education authority official said today.

 The two teenagers were considered to have disturbed the peaceful running of the school and were handed initial suspensions of two weeks, the official said. Their choice of clothing had spurred disruptive debate in the school and what the official described as the girls Islamic-fundamentalist behaviour had prevented normal classes from taking place.

 The two were free to return to school if they stopped wearing them, the official added. Burqas cover the entire body and head and wearers can see through a shroud or grill which covers the face. Some of the cloaks leave the eyes free.

 Afghanistans Taliban regime, which was overthrown by US-led forces in late 2001, introduced a law making it compulsory for all women to wear the garments.

 France, home to Europes largest Islamic minority, banned Islamic headscarves and other conspicuous religious signs in state schools in 2004 in a move aimed at stemming what it said was the rising influence of Islamists.

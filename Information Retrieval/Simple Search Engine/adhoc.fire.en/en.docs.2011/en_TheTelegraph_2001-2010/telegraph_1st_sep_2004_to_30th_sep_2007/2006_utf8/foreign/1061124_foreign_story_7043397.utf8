 Beirut mourns leaders death

 Beirut, Nov. 23 (Reuters): Tens of thousands of Lebanese paid tribute to assassinated Christian politician Pierre Gemayel today, turning his funeral in central Beirut into a display of defiance towards Syria and its Hezbollah allies.

 Raucous crowds carrying Lebanese flags and those of Christian factions, including Gemayels Phalange Party, swarmed around St George Maronite Cathedral, where Patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir conducted the rites.

 Sunnis, Druze and Christian leaders, standing together behind bullet-proof glass, called for solidarity in the struggle against Syria and its allies in Lebanon. National unity is stronger than their weapons and their crimes.

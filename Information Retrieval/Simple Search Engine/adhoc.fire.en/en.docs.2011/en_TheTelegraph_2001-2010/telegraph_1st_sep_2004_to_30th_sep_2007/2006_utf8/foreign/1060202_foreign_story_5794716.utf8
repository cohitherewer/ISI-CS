 Stop oil addiction

 Washington, Feb. 1 (Reuters): President George W. Bush said yesterday America is addicted to oil from West Asia and must break its dependence, in a State of the Union speech that promised aggressive US engagement around the world in defiance of critics.

 The former oilman outlined a green agenda in a 52-minute speech that was interrupted at least 60 times by applause. He called for improving technologies in order to reduce US oil imports from West Asia 75 per cent by 2025.

 Looking to restore confidence in his leadership, Bush stood before members of the US Congress and the rest of Washingtons power elite in the House of Representatives chamber to map out an election-year agenda for Republicans with a speech that was at times optimistic and at others combative.

 And while he vowed to work to improve the tone of debate in Washington, he stuck to national security themes that may be crucial to Republican hopes in November, defending a domestic spying programme that has Democrats outraged, and telling his critics on Iraq that second-guessing is not a strategy.

 With three years left in office, Bush is hoping to lift his political fortunes and those of his Republican allies in an election year with control of Congress up for grabs. He is coming off one of the toughest stretches of his presidency, and his job approval ratings hover in the high 30s to low 40s in most polls.

 America is addicted to oil, which is often imported from unstable parts of the world, Bush said. The best way to break this addiction is through technology.

 Iran war of words

 On the nuclear standoff with Iran, Bush said Tehran was held hostage by clerical leaders who repress their people, and urged the world not to allow Tehran to gain nuclear weapons. 

 In the Iranian port city of Bushehr, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad mocked Bushs call. In a defiant speech, he said: I am telling those fake superpowers that the Iranian nation became independent 27 years ago and ... on the nuclear case, it will resist until fully achieving its rights.

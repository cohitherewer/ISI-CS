 Costly flush

 Beijing, Dec. 1 (Reuters): A Chinese airline has calculated that it takes a litre of fuel to flush the toilet at 30,000 feet and is urging passengers to go to the bathroom before they board.

 As Chinese airlines come under increasing pressure to cut fuel expenditures, China Southerns latest strategy is to encourage passengers to spend their pennies before boarding the aircraft, Xinhua news agency reported.

 Steep doze

 Nashville (AP): A window washer working 

 on a downtown Nashville high-rise building apparently fell 

 asleep on the job, authorities say. The man, whom fire officials 

 did not immediately identify, was cleaning the glass on 

 the 20th floor of the Fifth Third Bank building on Friday 

 when several onlookers noticed he was not moving. He came 

 to after firefighters tugged on his ropes, then held up 

 a sign from inside the window to get his attention. The 

 worker lowered himself to the sidewalk, where he was examined 

 by paramedics.

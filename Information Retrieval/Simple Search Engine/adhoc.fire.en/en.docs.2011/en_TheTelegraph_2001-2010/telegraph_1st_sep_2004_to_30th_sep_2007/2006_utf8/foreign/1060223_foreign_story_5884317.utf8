 Shrine blown up in Iraq

 Samarra, Iraq, Feb. 22 (Reuters): A dawn bomb attack devastated a major Shiite shrine in Iraq today, sparking sectarian reprisals and an appeal from the President not to allow the country to slide into civil war.

 The apparently bloodless attack on the Golden Mosque in Samarra, one of Shiite Islams holiest sites, provoked more violence than Sunni rebel attacks that have killed thousands and the Shiite-led government and religious leaders urged calm.

 Three Sunni clerics were among six people killed, police said, at 27 Sunni mosques in Baghdad attacked by militants. Much damage was minor but at least two mosques were burnt out. There were sectarian clashes in other cities and in Baghdad fearful residents rushed home before dark, some stocking up on food.

 President Jalal Talabani, an ethnic Kurd, accused the attackers of trying to derail negotiations on a national unity coalition: We must... work together against... the danger of civil war. 

 The US has pressured Shiite leaders to bring Sunnis into government after they took part in an election in December; a top Shiite politician accused the US envoy of encouraging the bombers by supporting Sunni demands.

 Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad, urging Iraqis to unite against terror, said the US would help repair the shrine and accused al Qaida of a deliberate attempt to foment sectarian strife in Iraq.

 Beatle wife-beater

 Paul and Heather: When we were fab

 London, Oct. 18 (Reuters): Paul McCartney vowed today to defend himself in court against accusations published in a British newspaper that he physically attacked his estranged wife Heather during their four-year marriage.

 Our client will be defending these allegations vigorously and appropriately, the former Beatles lawyers Payne Hicks Beach said. 

 Mills lawyers, Mishcon de Reya, also refused to comment on the leaked court documents that splashed details of alleged abusive behaviour by McCartney in the media. 

 But Mills representatives said in a statement that she stands by everything that has been filed at court on her behalf.

 The Daily Mail reported that Mills had claimed in court papers lodged by her lawyers that McCartney had stabbed her in the arm with a broken wine glass and grabbed her by the neck to choke her.

 McCartney, 64, and former model Mills, 38, announced their separation in May, blaming media intrusion for the failure of one of the most high-profile marriages in show business.

 The newspaper reported claims that he used illegal drugs and drank excessively, hurled abuse at Mills and made her cancel an operation on the leg she lost in a traffic accident before they married because it interfered with his holiday plans.

 She claimed that McCartney did not want her to breast-feed their baby daughter, saying they are my breasts, the paper reported.

 Heathers media spokesman Phil Hall said she was shocked to see the allegations published.

 She has kept a dignified silence. She has not spoken about anything and that is still her view. She wont speak about anything, he said.

 The divorce has turned into a public battle for sympathy. In an echo of the bitter fight between Prince Charles and Princess Diana, McCartney and Mills have hired the same lawyers that represented the heir to the throne and his late wife.

 McCartney could lose up to a quarter of his estimated 825 million ($1.55 billion) fortune. That would equate to about 1 million for each week of their four-year marriage.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Get warrant for spying, says judge

 FRANCIS HARRIS

 Washington, Aug. 18: American electronic espionage operations against suspected al Qaida terrorists were thrown into chaos yesterday after a judge ruled that eavesdropping without a warrant is unconstitutional and ordered an immediate halt.

 Judge Anna Diggs Taylor said the spying violated the right to privacy and free speech enshrined in law by Americas founding fathers.

 The national eavesdropping programme is a centrepiece of President George Bushs war on terrorism. It involves secretly listening to conversations between people in the US and people in other countries.

 According to the ruling: The public interest is clear in this matter. It is the upholding of our constitution.

 The judges decision requires 

 that the National Security Agency immediately stops intercepting 

 the telephone and e-mail communications of anyone living 

 in America unless they secure a warrant.

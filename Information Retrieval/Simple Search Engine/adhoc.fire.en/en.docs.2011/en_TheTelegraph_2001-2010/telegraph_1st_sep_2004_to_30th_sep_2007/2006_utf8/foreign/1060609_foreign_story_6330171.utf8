The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Oil prices fall

London, June 8 (Reuters): Oil fell below $70 

a barrel after Abu Musab al-Zarqawi was declared killed today, raising faint hopes 

for a let-up in attacks on Iraqs wrecked oil industry.

 US oil was down $1.22 at $69.60, lowest in two weeks.

Irans willingness to talk to opponents of its 

nuclear policy was another factor pushing oil away from its record high of $75.35 

a barrel.

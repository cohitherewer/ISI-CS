 Sex scandal raid on President 

 Katsav: Lurid details

 Jerusalem, Aug. 22 (AP): Police seized computers and documents from the official residence of Israels President as part of a probe into allegations he sexually harassed two female employees and received money for pardons, police officials said today.

 Police, who conducted the raid last night, plan to question President Moshe Katsav at his residence tomorrow, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said.

 At least two women have accused Katsav of harassing them. One of the complainants reportedly also alleged that Katsav received money for granting pardons. 

 Katsav has denied wrongdoing. The Presidents office wouldnt comment on the raid. Katsavs office said he would cooperate with the probe.

 A police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said investigators seized Katsavs personal computer. Investigators are to review Katsavs e-mail traffic as well as the pardons he granted during his term.

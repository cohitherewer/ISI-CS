 Abuja, Nigeria, Oct. 29 (Agencies): The leader of Nigerias Muslims was one of about 100 people killed today when a domestic airliner crashed in bad weather shortly after takeoff from the capital Abuja, authorities said.

 An ADC Airlines official said 105 people were on board the Boeing 737 flight to the northern city of Sokoto when it ploughed into a corn field about 2 km from the runway. No more than five people survived the crash.

 A Reuters reporter saw burned bodies, some missing limbs or heads, being loaded onto trucks amid the smouldering remains of the fuselage.

 The plane crash... led to the death of our beloved Sultan... among about 100 people, the governor of Sokoto state, Attahiru Bafarawa, said.

 Bafarawa declared six days of mourning for Ibrahim Muhammadu Maccido, who led an estimated 70 million Muslims in Africas most populous country.

 Maccido, who as Sultan of Sokoto was also the top traditional ruler of northern Nigeria, helped curb religious bloodshed in the central state of Plateau in 2004.

 The sultans son, Muhammed Maccido, a senator, was also aboard, along with Abdulrahman Shehu Shagari, son of former Nigerian President Shehu Shagari.

 Only the planes tail, an engine and part of a wing were still recognisable at the crash site, an area the size of a football field littered with body parts, smouldering fires, clothes, boxes and bags. The smell is something you dont want to remember, said Steve Noble, a British diplomat.

 Five possible survivors were rushed to a hospital in Abuja. 

 The governor of Abuja, Nasir el-Rufai, said there was bad weather at the time of the crash, but added that only a detailed investigation could determine the cause. The operator, ADC, is a popular domestic airline with an ageing fleet of Boeing jets.

 The office of President Olusegun Obasanjo issued a statement calling for a full investigation.

 It was the fourth significant air crash in Nigeria in just over a year. 

 In October 2005, 119 people died when a Bellview Airlines Boeing 737 crashed shortly after takeoff from Lagos.

 Last December, a Sosoliso Airlines DC9 crashed on landing in Port Harcourt, killing 106 people. And in September, 12 Nigerian military personnel were killed in a plane crash in Benue state.

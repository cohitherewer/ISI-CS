 Bush gaffe at G8 summit

 St Petersburg, July 17: 

 President Bush was in no mood for diplomatic niceties at 

 the G8 summit, judging by remarks made to Tony Blair as 

 the leaders of the worlds most powerful industrial 

 democracies sat down to lunch today.

 Unaware that a microphone at the summit was switched on, Bush, chomping a piece of bread, used the opportunity to suggest a way out of the latest criss in West Asia. 

 See, the irony is what they really need to do is to get Syria to get Hezbollah to stop doing this s***, he said. Bush also hinted that Condoleezza Rice, the US secretary of state, would take a bigger role, and appeared to express frustration about UN secretary heneral Kofi Annan. 

 I think Condis going to go pretty soon, Bush said. Rice is widely expected to travel to the region after a UN fact-finding team returns. Blair, whose remarks were not as clearly heard, appeared to be pressing Bush about the importance of getting international peacekeepers into the region.

 The comments were carried on the G8s official television channel, which normally transmits images with sound that does not allow reporters to pick out individual comments. 

 The recording also showed Bush, apparently expected to make remarks, declaring: Im just going to make it up. Im not going to talk too damn long like the rest of them. Some of these guys talk too long.

 Much of the G8 summit has been 

 devoted to discussing the Middle East crisis centring on 

 Lebanese Hizbollah militant attacks on Israel and Israeli 

 bombing of Lebanon. Washington and its allies say Hizbollah 

 is backed by Syria.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Face to face with a brutal business

 LUKE BAKER

Jerusalem, June 8 (Reuters): I never met Abu 

Musab al-Zarqawi, but he nearly killed me twice.

 The first time was in Kerbala, a city south of Baghdad where Shia Muslims gather each year to mark the death of Imam Hussein, the Prophet Mohammads grandson, 1,300 years ago.

 It was March 2, 2004, and Kerbalas narrow streets were packed with more than one million pilgrims, many of whom beat themselves with chains to recall Husseins bloody demise.

 It was the first time the ceremony, known as Ashura, had been freely marked in decades as Saddam Hussein, a Sunni Muslim, did not allow the open celebration of Shia festivals.

 That sense of religious freedom had greatly enhanced the fervour of the crowds and perhaps contributed to Zarqawis desire to scar the ceremonies in the most extreme way possible.

 At about 10.30 am, a first explosion shook the city. Unsure what had happened, myself and a Reuters cameraman ran to the site of the blast, dodging through a panicked throng of people as they dashed in the opposite direction.

 A second explosion went off seconds later about 15 metres ahead of us. It tore through the crowd in front of us, scattering human remains in every direction, instantly killing perhaps 20 people and wounding dozens more.

 The only reason we werent struck down was because of the density of the masses around us. People just a few metres ahead were killed or maimed, left lying helpless in the street.

 We turned to run and to our left another bomb detonated. In all 120 people were killed in Kerbala that day as five bombs detonated across the city in a matter of minutes. Zarqawi later claimed responsibility.

 At the time it was the deadliest attack by his group, but hundreds more were to follow, with suicide bombers targeting Iraqi security forces, American troops and civilians almost daily across the country in the past two years.

 In November last year, in Amman, I again came face-to-face with his brutal methods. I was staying at the Hyatt hotel. On the floor above, a bomber strapped with explosives had blown himself up in the lobby. At almost exactly the same time, two other bombers detonated themselves at two other hotels, killing 60 people.

His death may have removed the mastermind behind such 

violence, but with an apparently endless supply of men willing to kill themselves 

for his cause, its unlikely that deaths in his name have ended.

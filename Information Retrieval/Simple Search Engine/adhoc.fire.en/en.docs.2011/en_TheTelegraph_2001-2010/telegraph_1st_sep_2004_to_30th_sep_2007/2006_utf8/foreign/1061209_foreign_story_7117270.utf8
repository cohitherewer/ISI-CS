 Brash Britney

 Under Cover

 Los Angeles, Dec. 8 (Reuters): Britney Spears back in the headlines for partying every night and ditching her underwear admitted yesterday that she probably did take my new-found freedom a little too far.

 But in a posting on her website (www.britneyspears.com), the Oops! I did it again! singer said she was just getting started and said she was looking forward to a new year, new music and a new me.

 In a reference to the furore caused by photos showing her wearing no underpants under her miniskirts, Spears wrote Thank God for Victorias Secrets new underwear line! Spears, who turned 25 last weekend, has raised eyebrows by hitting the party circuit with Paris Hilton, shortly after filing for divorce from husband Kevin Federline.

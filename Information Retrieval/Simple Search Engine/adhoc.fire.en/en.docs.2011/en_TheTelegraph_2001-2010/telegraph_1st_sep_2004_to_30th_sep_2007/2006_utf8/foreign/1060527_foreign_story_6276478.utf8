 Dracula Castle in royal hands

 Bran (Romania) May 26 

 (Reuters): Romania returned a medieval fortress known as 

 Draculas Castle today to its pre-World 

 War II owners, the former royal family of Habsburg who were 

 chased out by the communist regime almost 60 years ago.

 Perched among forests on the foothills of the Carpathian mountains, the Bran Castle is one of the first prominent pieces of real estate given back by the Bucharest government under Romanias troubled property restitution law.

 Its handover, following a five-year legal battle, raises hopes for many Romanians still waiting to win back the houses, factories and land they lost to wartime fascists or post-war communists who tried to dismantle capitalism.

 I cant believe this is actually happening. I have goosebumps. This was my home and I havent been here since 1948, Dominic von Habsburg, heir to 1920s rulers King Ferdinand and Queen Mary, said. Its been a very long and slow road ... Everyone wants to go home eventually, said the 69-year-old architect.

 Now a museum and major tourist attraction in Romania, the fortress was built in the 14th century to guard the nearby city of Brasov from attacks by the Ottoman Turks.

 Jagged towers and remote surroundings have earned the castle its famous name. But the fortress was never part of Bram Stokers novel Dracula, although Romanias notorious 15th century ruler Vlad Tepes, or Vlad the Impaler, whose life inspired the book, may have set foot there briefly.

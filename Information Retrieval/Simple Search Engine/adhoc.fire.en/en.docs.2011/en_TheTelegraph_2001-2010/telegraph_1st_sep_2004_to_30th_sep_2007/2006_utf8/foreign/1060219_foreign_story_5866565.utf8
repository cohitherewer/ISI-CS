 Maoists call for strike

 Kathmandu, Feb. 18 (Reuters): Nepals Maoist rebels called today for an indefinite nationwide general strike from April 3 in an intensified campaign against King Gyanendra who sacked the government and seized absolute power last year.

 Maoist chief Prachanda, who uses only one name, and his deputy Baburam Bhattarai said the rebels would also enforce a blockade of Kathmandu and other main towns from March 14 to try and bring down king.

 We believe the blockade and the strike, though temporarily painful, will give lasting relief for generations to come, the underground rebel leaders said in an emailed statement.

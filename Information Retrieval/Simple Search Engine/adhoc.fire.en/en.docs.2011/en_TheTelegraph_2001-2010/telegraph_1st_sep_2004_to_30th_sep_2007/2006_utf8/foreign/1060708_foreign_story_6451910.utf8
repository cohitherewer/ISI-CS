 Moscow, July 7: President Vladimir Putin presented the new face of the Kremlin yesterday as he chatted with his people during a two-hour Internet broadcast.

 The Russian leader faced questions about his KGB past and the future of democracy in Russia but most people, it seemed, wanted to know just why he had lifted a boys T-shirt at the Kremlin and kissed his tummy.

 They witnessed a remarkable performance, one in which their leader occasionally interspersed his normal dourness with the odd joke and even a bit of soul-searching about his past as a spy.

 We lived in a different country back then, you have to realise that, he said. We carried out our duties to protect the interests of our country. Thank God its all now in the past.

 The webcast was the culmination of a public relations exercise ahead of next weeks G8 summit in St Petersburg to show that Russia is not an autocratic bully, as some in the West have suggested. Perhaps tired of Putins annual phone-in with his people, a carefully scripted event, many Russians seized on the opportunity to talk directly to their President.

 Looking slightly embarrassed, the President said he was overcome with emotion last week at seeing a young boy, Nikita, who appeared both serious and defenceless, looking lost among a group of tourists.

 I tell you honestly, I just wanted to stroke him like a kitten, he said of the boy, who has reportedly refused to wash since the kiss. He just seemed so nice. There was nothing else behind it.

 Not all Russians are convinced ? seeing in the act the work of Ketchum, the New York-based public relations company hired to burnish the governments tarnished image ahead of the G8 summit. Since the company began work, there has been a dramatic change in atmosphere in the Kremlin, which has regained its Soviet-era reputation for secrecy.

 Now though, Kremlin aides rarely seen in public are suddenly hosting press conferences. Refuting point by point the most commonly heard criticisms in the West, they insist that Russia does not use its energy supplies as a political weapon and certainly does not bully its neighbours. 

 Speculation has mounted that the PR men from Ketchum have got to work on the President too. After all, Putin is awkward with members of the public, especially children, who have been known to burst into tears at his approach. 

 The Russian President, the argument 

 goes, had been instructed to be more friendly towards children. 

 He just didnt get it quite right. The event was hosted 

 by Russian portal Yandex.ru and the BBC.

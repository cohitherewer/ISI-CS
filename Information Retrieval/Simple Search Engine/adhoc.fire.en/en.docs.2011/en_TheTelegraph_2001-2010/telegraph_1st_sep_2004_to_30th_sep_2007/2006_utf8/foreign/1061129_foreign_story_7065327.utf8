 Pope olive branch to Turkey

 Ankara, Nov. 28 (Reuters): Pope Benedict today backed Ankaras EU entry bid and said Islam was a religion of peace in a bid to soothe rows over his views in the mostly Muslim state.

 Benedict received a red carpet welcome on arrival in Turkey with Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan greeting him at the steps of the plane a break from protocol and a show of warmth from a leader who initially said he was too busy to meet the 79-year-old Pontiff.

 Benedict, who before his 2005 election as pope had opposed Turkeys EU ambitions, made his comments during their talks, Erdogan said before leaving for a Nato summit in Riga. He said we are not political but we wish for Turkey to join the EU, the Prime Minister told journalists.

 Erdogan, who began his career in Islamic politics, added: The most important message the Pope gave was towards Islam, he reiterated his view of Islam as peaceful and affectionate.

 Vatican officials were not immediately available to comment on the Popes remarks, which Turkish commentators welcomed. The Pope said today ... that he supported Turkeys EU bid. That means he elevated Turkey from a second class membership into a first class membership, Cemal Usak, a Turkish Muslim activist, told CNN Turk.

 His Regensburg (Germany) speech supported a clash of civilisations but now in todays remarks he apparently backs an alliance of civilisations, said Usak, who is active in interfaith dialogue.

 Benedict travelled to Turkey with two strikes against him, his well-known opposition to Turkish EU membership and the September speech in Germany that many Muslims said insulted Islam by using a quote that described the religion as violent and irrational. 

 He has denied he sees that link but has not withdrawn his words.

 Security was heavy for Benedicts first visit to the Muslim world, with sharpshooters on the roof of the arrivals building and troops guarding the airport.

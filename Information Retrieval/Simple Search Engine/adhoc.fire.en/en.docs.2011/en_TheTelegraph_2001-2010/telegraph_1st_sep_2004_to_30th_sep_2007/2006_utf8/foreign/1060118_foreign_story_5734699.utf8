 SA Indians letter in racist row

 Durban, Jan. 17 (PTI): Racial remarks by an Indian-origin minister of the African National Congress (ANC)-led provincial government in Kwazulu-Natal has sparked a furore in the state with increasing demands for his removal from the ministry.

 Amichand Rajbansi, leader of the ANC ally, Minority Front, was accused of writing an article in a community newspaper which said that Africans should not be allowed to move into low-cost houses in the township of Chatsworth in Durban.

 Rajbansi denied that he wrote the article calling South Africans rapists and killers, but blamed a junior party worker for creating the fiasco.

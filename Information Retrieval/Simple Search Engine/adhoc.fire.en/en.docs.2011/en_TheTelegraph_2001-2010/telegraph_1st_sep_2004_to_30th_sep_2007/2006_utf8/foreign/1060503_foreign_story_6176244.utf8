 Berlusconi resigns as PM

 Rome, May 2 (Reuters): Italys Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi handed in his resignation today, ending weeks of political uncertainty and opening the way for Centre-Left leader Romano Prodi to form a new government.

 Berlusconi had contested Prodis razor-thin victory in a national election last month but was forced to concede after lawmakers elected Centre-Left speakers for parliament at the weekend, showing Prodi can control the Assembly with his slim majority.

 The resignation marked the end of a turbulent five-year spell as Prime Minister for the billionaire media magnate who won power promising an economic miracle but instead presided over a long period of stagnation.

 It also signalled the start of a swing to the Left for the euro zones third largest economy.

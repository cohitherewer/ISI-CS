 US pastor resigns in gay sex scandal

 Haggard: Faithful to wife

 Colorado Springs (Colorado), Nov. 2 (Reuters): The president of the US National Association of Evangelicals, who has had regular talks with the White House and vocally opposes gay marriage, resigned yesterday after being accused of having a sexual relationship with a male escort.

 Ted Haggard, who denied the accusation, also temporarily stepped down as senior pastor of the New Life Church in Colorado Springs, the church said in a statement.

 Ive never had a gay relationship with anyone, Haggard said in an interview with Denver television station KUSA on Wednesday night. Im steady with my wife. Im faithful to my wife.

 The New Life Church statement quoted Haggard as saying that he could not continue to minister under the cloud created by the accusations.

 Mike Jones, who said he was a male escort, said he had had a three-year sexual business relationship with Haggard.

 Haggard, who is often credited with rallying conservative Christians behind President George W. Bush for his 2004 re-election, talks to Bush or his advisors every Monday.

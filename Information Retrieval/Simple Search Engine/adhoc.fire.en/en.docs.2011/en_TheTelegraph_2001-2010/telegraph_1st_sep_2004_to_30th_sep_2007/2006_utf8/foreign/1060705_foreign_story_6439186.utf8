 Signs of speed

 London, July 4 (Reuters): British motorist John Hopwood concocted a novel scheme to avoid payment when he was given a speeding fine ? simply switch the road signs.

 Hopwood, 44, had been snapped by a speed camera breaking the 50 km per hour limit.

 So he went to a 65 kmph area, removed a red 40 warning sign, drove back to the 30 mph area, attached it to a lamp post and took a photo as proof that his offence of driving at 77 kmph had not been so bad.

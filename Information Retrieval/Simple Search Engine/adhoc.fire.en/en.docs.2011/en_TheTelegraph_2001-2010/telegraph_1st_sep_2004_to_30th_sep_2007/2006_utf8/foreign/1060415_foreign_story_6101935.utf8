 Holocaust the target again

 Ahmadinejad: Myth theory

 Tehran, April 14 (Agencies): Irans firebrand President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said today there was a serious doubt that the Jewish holocaust during World War II ever took place.

 If there is serious doubt over the holocaust, there is no doubt over the catastrophe and holocaust being faced by the Palestinians, he told a conference in Tehran on the Palestinian issue.

 Certain western powers believe that during World War II a large number of Jews were exterminated, and to compensate for this crime this regime (Israel) was created, he said.

 If this catastrophe was real, why should the people of the region pay the price?

 Ahmadinejad has already caused international outrage by insisting that the holocaust ? the killing of an estimated six million Jews by the Nazis and their allies during World War II ? was a myth used to justify the creation of Israel.

 He has also said the Jewish state must be wiped off the map or moved as far away as Alaska ? comments that have provoked anger in the West and even condemnation from the UN Security Council. 

 Ahmadinejad also said that the existence of the Zionist regime, Irans term for Israel, was a threat to the Islamic world. But the tone of his speech at the conference was slightly more moderate than fiery rhetoric last year.

 The existence of the Zionist regime is tantamount to an imposition of an unending and unrestrained threat so that none of the nations and Islamic countries of the region and beyond can feel secure from its threat, Ahmadinejad said today.

 In February, foreign minister Manouchehr Mottaki had said Ahmadinejads October comments had been misunderstood and that he had been speaking about the Israeli regime not the country.

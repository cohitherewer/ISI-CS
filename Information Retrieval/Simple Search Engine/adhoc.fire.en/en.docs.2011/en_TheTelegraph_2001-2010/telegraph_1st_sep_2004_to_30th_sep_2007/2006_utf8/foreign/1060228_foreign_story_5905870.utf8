 George Michael held for drug possession

 Michael: Faithless

 London, Feb. 27 (Reuters): George Michael was arrested yesterday on suspicion of possessing drugs after he was found slumped in a car in central London, a police source said.

 Michael, 42, who has sold more than 80 million records worldwide during a 25-year career, was arrested in the Hyde Park area of the capital early yesterday, the source said.

 A London police spokesman issued a statement saying a 42-year-old man had been held on suspicion of possessing Class C drugs, a group in British law that includes cannabis, tranquillisers and some painkillers.

 We were called by a member of the public to a man seen slumped over the steering wheel of a car, the statement said. He was arrested on suspicion of possession of controlled substances. He was bailed to return to a police station in late March pending a police investigation.

 Michaels manager and publicist could not be reached for comment.

 Under British law, anyone convicted of having Class C drugs can be jailed for up to two years and face an unlimited fine, according to the home office (interior ministry) website.

 In a front page report, the Sun newspaper said the singer was found in a dark-coloured Range Rover parked on Hyde Park Corner, one of central Londons busiest intersections.

 The unsourced report said he was taken into police custody and was examined by a doctor. He had his photograph and fingerprints taken and was released after more than seven hours, the report said. It is not the stars first brush with the law.

 Michael was arrested in April, 1998, for engaging in a lewd act in a public toilet in Los Angeles, after which he ended years of speculation by announcing that he was gay.

 He said in an interview last year that he was giving up the world of pop, saying he found the media attention unbearable.

 The singer had a string of hits in the 1980s with the band Wham! before forging a successful solo career with albums such as Faith, Listen Without Prejudice, Vol. 1 and Patience.

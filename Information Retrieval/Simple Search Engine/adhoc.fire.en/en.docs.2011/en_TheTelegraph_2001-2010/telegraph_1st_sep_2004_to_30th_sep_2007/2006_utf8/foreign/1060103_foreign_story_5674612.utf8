 Beijing, Jan. 2 (Reuters): A Shanghai court has ruled that a Chinese coffee company infringed the copyright of coffee chain Starbucks Corp, state media said today, as the countrys battles to rein in intellectual property theft.

 The court ordered Shanghai Xingbake Coffee Co. Ltd. to pay compensation of 500,000 yuan ($61,900) to Starbucks, whose Chinese name translates as Xingbake, the China Daily reported.

 Beijing has pledged to protect intellectual property rights, but with piracy of everything from handbags to software rampant, the issue has become a thorn in relations with the US and other countries that accuse Chinese firms of copying western products.

 The court ruled that Shanghai Xingbake Coffee Co. Ltd. constituted illegitimate competition by using the Chinese translation of Starbucks in its company name and ... a similar design motif for its coffee houses, the report said.

 Shanghai Xingbake registered in 1999, after Starbucks had registered its trademark in China, but before it registered as a joint venture in Shanghai in 2000, the newspaper said.

 Starbucks brought the case in 2003 claiming copyright infringement against the Shanghai company, whose logo shares the same white and green design as that of the Seattle-based chain.

 Censor heat

 Censors have told Chinese media to stop discussing plagiarism claims against the Communist Partys star legal scholar, who is accused of copying parts of his new book from the writings of a once-jailed dissident.

 Reporters and scholars involved said propaganda officials last week ordered no more reporting of the claims against Zhou Yezhong, a professor at Wuhan University in central China. 

 A month ago, two Chinese newspapers accused him of unacknowledged copying from Wang Tiancheng ? a former Peking University lecturer who spent five years in jail from 1992 for trying to establish an Opposition party.

 Touch of black on French TV

 ADAM SAGE

 Paris, July17: France will pass a cultural landmark when a black presenter reads the evening news bulletin on the countrys most popular television channel for the first time.

 The arrival of Harry Roselmack on the private TF1 station comes after a call by President Chirac for the media to promote members of ethnic minorities as part of a policy of racial integration.

 Although Roselmack, 33, who is from Martinique in the French West Indies, has been appointed only as a stand-in during the holiday season, his rise is being hailed as a potent symbol in a country unused to seeing black faces in high-profile positions outside sporting competitions.

 As a result, TF1 is expecting a large audience for its 8pm news this evening and advertising slots are believed to have sold at a premium rate. The evening bulletin attracts an average of 8.8 million viewers, 44 per cent of the viewing public, and is widely seen as the countrys most influential news programme.

 The burden on Roselmacks shoulders is heavy, with black groups hoping that he will help to lead them from the margins to the mainstream of French society. Amirouche Laidi, chairman of Averroes, the black journalists association, described his appointment as a bombshell.

 Head-hunted after Novembers riots, which forced the Parisian establishment to confront the taboo issue of race, Roselmack is being portrayed as proof of the French medias new-found commitment to equal opportunities.

 Although the countrys ethnic minorities represent almost 10 per cent of the population, few have prominent roles on television. Dominique Wolton, a sociologist, described Roselmacks debut as a real event.

 Roselmack said that he did not want to be seen as a representative of black people, but of all communities which are not represented as they should be in French society. If part of the French population does not feel accepted, its because they are not represented, he said.

 Frances venture into equal 

 opportunities remains tentative compared to those of countries 

 such as Britain and the US, and Roselmack cannot yet claim 

 to be a Gallic version of Sir Trevor McDonald.

 Kathmandu, Nov. 27: Nepals multi-party government today handed over (Nepal) Rs 100 million ($1.4 million) to the Maoist rebels for the setting up of camps which will keep seven cantonments of the Peoples Liberation Army (PLA). 

 The decision was taken at a meeting of the Nepal cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala this morning and follows the rules laid down in the peace accord signed by Koirala and Maoist chief Prachanda last week. 

 Speaking to reporters after the cabinet meeting, minister for physical planning and works Gopal Man Shrestha said the government would release the amount to the Maoists soon. The monetary assistance will be used for the immediate management of PLA cantonments due to be constructed in seven places across the country, he said. This is in addition to the (Nepal) Rs 70 million given to the Maoists by the government on Thursday last week.

 The Maoists have sought (Nepal) Rs 560 million from the government for the management of the PLA camps. 

 Shrestha said the cabinet also constituted a five-member committee, with deputy Prime Minister K.P. Oli as chairman, for the implementation of the Rayamajhi commissions report on the suppression of pro-democracy protesters in April.

 Soviet hand in Pope attack

 Rome, March 2 (Reuters): Leaders of the former Soviet Union were behind the assassination attempt against Pope John Paul II in 1981, an Italian parliamentary investigative commission said in a report.

 A final draft of the report was made available to Reuters today by the commission president, Senator Paolo Guzzanti. This commission believes, beyond any reasonable doubt, that the leadership of the Soviet Union took the initiative to eliminate Pope John Paul, the report said.

 They relayed this decision to the military secret services for them to take on all necessary operations to commit a crime of unique gravity, without parallel in modern times, it said.

 China restraint call to Korea

 Seoul, Oct. 4 (Reuters): China, the closest North Korea has to an ally, today called for restraint after the reclusive state said it planned a nuclear test in a move the US said would threaten world peace.

 We hope that North Korea will exercise necessary calm and restraint over the nuclear test issue, foreign ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao said in a short statement today on the ministrys website (www.fmprc.gov.cn).

 Liu urged a negotiated settlement, saying countries should not take actions that escalate tensions. The US, France and Japan have all pressed for the issue to be dealt with at the UN.

 But Beijing wants it resolved through six-country talks set up to end North Koreas nuclear weapons programme. North Korea has snubbed Those talks involving the two Koreas, China, Japan, Russia and the US for almost a year.

 It has refused to return until the US ends a crackdown on North Korean offshore bank accounts, which Washington says is aimed at ending suspected illicit activities.

 Analysts and officials said Pyongyangs nuclear test announcement yesterday could well be an attempt to push the US into direct talks about ending the crackdown.

 South Koreas unification minister, Lee Jong-seok, said he saw a strong element of trying to apply pressure on the US. In the event efforts to resume the six-party talks break down, the possibility of a North Korean nuclear test is high, Lee said.

 Analysts say North Korea probably could make a nuclear weapon but lacks the technology to make it small enough to fit on a missile. They also note that in its July test, North Koreas long-range missile fizzled out just after take-off.

 Tension on the divided Korean peninsula has risen sharply since July when Pyongyang defied international warnings by test-firing missiles. 

 North Korea argues that its hand has been forced by what a North Korean diplomat called Washingtons proclamation of war by threatening economic sanctions.

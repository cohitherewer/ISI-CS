 Nepal defiance

 Kathmandu, Jan. 17 (Reuters): Nepals main political parties said today they would go ahead with a planned anti-King rally in Kathmandu on Friday despite a ban on protests by the royalist government.

 The seven parties plan the protest to oppose next months municipal elections and to press King Gyanendra to hand back power to an all-party government.

 But yesterday, the government banned rallies anywhere in the capital, saying anti-monarchy Maoist guerrillas could infiltrate such gatherings and spark trouble.

 Rallies in the heart of the capital were banned last year.

 It is our right to protest peacefully ... We are not going to be cowed down, said Ram Chandra Poudel, a leader of the biggest party, Nepali Congress.

 The parties say the municipal polls are aimed at legitimising the kings absolute power. The rebels ? fighting for a single-party communist republic ? say they will stop the vote.

 Last week, the seven parties gathered more than 100,000 people in the southeastern town of Janakpur in the biggest pro-democracy rally since King Gyanendra sacked the government, suspended civil liberties and curbed media freedom last February.

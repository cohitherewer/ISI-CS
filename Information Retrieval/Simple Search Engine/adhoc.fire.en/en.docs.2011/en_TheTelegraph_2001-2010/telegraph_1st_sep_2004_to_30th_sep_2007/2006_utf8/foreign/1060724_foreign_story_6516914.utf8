 Taliban suffer losses 

 Kandahar, July 23 (Reuters): Nato-led British and Afghan troops killed 19 Taliban guerrillas today, a local official said, as militants vowed more suicide attacks a day after a deadly double strike in the south. 

 Afghanistan is going through the bloodiest phase of violence since the fall of the Taliban government in 2001, with most attacks occurring in the south where Nato-led forces will assume security responsibilities from a US-led coalition in just over a week. 

 Race murder 

 London (Reuters): Police investigating the racist murder of an Asian man during a brawl between about 40 Asians and whites have arrested eight men, two of them on suspicion of murder. 

 Pak prisoners 

 London (Reuters): Pakistan handed over 58 prisoners to the Afghan authorities on Sunday, a week after a crackdown aimed at catching Taliban fighters living around the western city of Quetta. The Afghan authorities will investigate the prisoners before releasing them to see if they include any Taliban, said inspector Munsif Khan. Last week, police arrested 250 Afghans on grounds that they lacked proper documents.

 Paris in drink trouble

 Hilton: Just one margarita

 Los Angeles, Sept. 7 (Reuters): Celebrity Paris Hilton was arrested in Hollywood early today for suspected drunk driving, but she said the incident had been blown out of proportion and that she may have been speeding to get a late-night burger.

 Hilton, 25, the heiress to the Hilton hotel dynasty known for her hard-partying lifestyle, was pulled over by police in Hollywood around 1 am (local time) for driving erratically.

 She told KIIS-FM radio in an interview this morning that she had been to a charity fundraiser party after a long day shooting a music video and had just one margarita. A margarita is a popular cocktail made with tequila, lime juice and orange liqueur.

 I had one margarita (and) was starving because I had not eaten all day, she said. Maybe I was speeding a little bit and I got pulled over. I was just really hungry and I wanted to have an In-N-Out Burger.

 The star of reality show The Simple Life, said that as usual there were a lot of photographers around.

 I think they (the police) wanted to make a statement. They even said: There are a lot of people watching. We dont want them to think we are giving you special treatment, Hilton said. 

 Police said Hilton failed a sobriety test but she has not been charged with any offence.

 Cate prowls in Ibsens classic play

 Blanchett: Theatrical

 New York, March 3 (AP): In the Sydney Theatre Companys jangling, tension-filled production of Henrik Ibsens Hedda Gabler, Cate Blanchett doesnt just walk. She strides ? fiercely. 

 Pacing and prowling the confines of Heddas stifling bourgeois home with the energy of an elegant, yet caged animal. Its her glam ferocity that propels this revival of the Ibsen classic, which the Australian troupe has brought to the Brooklyn Academy of Musics Harvey Theatre for a four-week run.

 The actress is eminently watchable. Blanchett, known for such films as Elizabeth and her Oscar-winning role in The Aviator, is more than a movie star. She has a strong, robust stage voice and the savvy to know how to use it.

 Washington, Sept. 15: American doctors yesterday introduced the worlds first bionic woman and estimated the cost at just one per cent of the price tag for the fictional Six Million Dollar Man.

 Appearing for the first time in public yesterday, Claudia Mitchell, 26, said that her new $60,000 thought-powered arm was really cool and had allowed her to reclaim her life.

 It helps overcome the psychological effects of amputation. It feels like Im on the edge of technology, she said.

 Mitchell said that when her middle-aged doctors first dubbed her the Bionic Woman, she had not understood the reference to the 1970s TV series that originated with The Six Million Dollar Man.

 She said the artificial arm operated like a normal human limb: I just think, I want my hand open, and it happens. Doctors said Mitchell, a former US Marine, had first made contact with them after reading about early bionic experiments on male patients. The victim of a motorcycle accident that resulted in the amputation of her left arm, the device has changed her prospects. Next year, she plans to go to university.

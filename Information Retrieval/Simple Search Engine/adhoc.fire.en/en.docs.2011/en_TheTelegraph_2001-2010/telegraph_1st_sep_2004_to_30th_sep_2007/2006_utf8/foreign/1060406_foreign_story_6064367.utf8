 Mac packs Windows

 New York, April 5 (Reuters): Apple Computer Inc., the maker of the Macintosh computer and iPod music device, today rolled out a first-ever software patch to run Microsofts dominant Windows operating system on its PCs, a move that could draw millions of new buyers.

 By enabling the move to Windows, the worlds number one operating system, Apple hopes to draw people who want Macs, considered by many as easier to use and more stylish, but prefer the Windows operating system.

 Apple shares rose 5.7 per cent in early trade on Nasdaq.

 Apple said the Boot Camp software, available immediately as a download, enables Macs powered by Intel Corp. chips to run either Windows XP or Apples Mac OS operating system software.

 Apples rivals Dell Inc. and Hewlett-Packard Co. primarily use Microsoft Corps Windows software.

 We think Boot Camp makes the Mac even more appealing to Windows users considering making the switch, said Philip Schiller, Apples senior vice-president of Worldwide Product Marketing, in a statement.

 In addition, with the patch, Macintosh users will now likely be able to run some games and other software on their Mac OS X computers without buying a separate Windows based computer.

 The final version of Boot Camp will be available as a feature in the upcoming Mac OS X version 10.5 Leopard personal computer. 

 Apple said it will not provide support for installing or running Boot Camp and does not sell or support Microsoft Windows software.

 Cupertino, California-based Apple said last June it would shift to microprocessors made by Intel, the worlds biggest chipmaker, from those made by IBM. It plans to move its entire Macintosh line to Intel chips by the end of 2007.

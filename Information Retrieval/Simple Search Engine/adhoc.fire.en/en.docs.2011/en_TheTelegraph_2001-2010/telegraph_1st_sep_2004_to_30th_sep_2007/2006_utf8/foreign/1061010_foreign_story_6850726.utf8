 An atomic threat? Not yet

 Vienna, Oct. 9 (AP): North Korea may have the bomb. But the twin complexities of developing nuclear warheads from a successful test explosion and the ways of delivering them means the country may be years away from posing an atomic threat to the rest of the world.

 The mere fact that the North has apparently managed to set off an underground nuclear blast is alarming enough because it not only moves the volatile communist nation a giant step closer to having atomic arms but also demonstrates its determination not to be swayed by worldwide pressure to step back from the brink. 

 In testing its device, North Korea would even be ignoring China, its closest ally, most important economic partner and the Norths guarantor of oil. 

 Its all a bit jaw-dropping, in terms of how swiftly the test has been conducted, said Alex Neill, head of the Asian security programme at the Royal United Services Institute, a British defence think thank. 

 He said expectations had been that there would be a six- to 12-month hiatus between the regimes October 3 announcement of its intended test and the actual blast today.

 Still, a test is just that an experiment that needs years of development before it turns into the finished product. 

 In this case, that product would be nuclear weapons that could menace and hit not only the Norths neighbours but enemies like the US thousands of kilometres away. 

 The secretive North is an enigma as far as its military capabilities are concerned. 

 And its nuclear development also remains shrouded in mystery since it kicked out inspectors of the International Atomic Energy Agency and then withdrew from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in early 1993.

 Still, both its nuclear and missile technology are believed to be lacking the sophistication needed to develop warheads and the ways to deliver them. 

 The power of the blast appears to back that assumption. 

 Ahead of todays reported explosion, former UN nuclear inspector David Albright, president of the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security, speculated that the test bomb would have a yield three to four times weaker than the bombs that destroyed the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II because of the North Koreans inability to produce a stronger weapon.

 How ape-man was killed

 Johannesburg, Jan. 13 (AP): An American researcher believes he has solved the mystery of how one of the most important human ancestors died nearly 2 million years ago: an eagle killed the three- and-a-half-year-old ape-man known as the Taung child.

 The discovery suggests small human ancestors known as hominids had to survive being hunted not only by large predators on the ground but fearsome raptors that swooped from the sky, said Lee Berger, a senior palaeoanthropologist at Johannesburgs University of the Witwatersrand.

 The discovery of the partial skull of a juvenile ape-man, or australopethicus africanus, in South Africas North West province in 1924 is regarded as evidence of the missing link in human evolution. The find led many researchers to believe humans evolved in Africa, instead of Asia or Europe.

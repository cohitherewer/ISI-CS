 Iran refuses to stop enrichment

 Tehran, April 29 (Reuters): Iran refused today to stop uranium enrichment after a UN report said it had done little or nothing to prove it was not developing nuclear arms.

 Instead, it repeated a long-standing offer to let international inspectors make unannounced checks as long as the UN Security Council dropped the case.

 Mohamed ElBaradei, head of the UN International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), delivered a report yesterday saying UN checks in Iran had been hampered and Tehran had rebuffed requests to stop making nuclear fuel.

 Mohammad Saeedi, deputy head of Irans Atomic Energy Organisation, told state television that Iran wanted the Security Council, which has the power to impose sanctions, to pass the case back down to the IAEA. If the case returns to the agency again, we will begin the section that concerns the Additional Protocol, Saeedi said.

 Clooneys women ache

 New York, Dec. 12 (AP): Lets get real: George Clooney is a two-time winner of People magazines sexiest man alive. 

 He can woo practically any woman he wants right? Um, ah, no, because I also wake up and my knees hurt and I think, Im 45, he tells Newsweek in its December 18 issue.

 The actor-director, who was married in the early Nineties to actress Talia Balsam, is one of Hollywoods most famous bachelors. He won Peoples sexiest man alive title in 1997 and again this year, and is now tied with his good friend Brad Pitt. Though he won an Oscar for his role in 2005s Syriana, Clooney says he feels more at home in the directors chair. Directing is the key to filmmaking. Everything else is just paint, says Clooney, nominated for an Oscar for directing Good Night, and Good Luck. Does he have a bullhorn?

 No, Im very modern, he says. I have someone that I yell at and they yell it out loud. Clooneys latest film, The Good German, directed by Steven Soderbergh, will be released by Warner Bros. on December 22.

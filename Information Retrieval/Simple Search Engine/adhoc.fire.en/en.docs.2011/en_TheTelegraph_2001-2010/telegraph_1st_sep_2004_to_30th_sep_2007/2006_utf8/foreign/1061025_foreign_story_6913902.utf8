 Slur on looks irks Hillary

 (Top) Hillary in 

 1965 and in 2006 

 Albany (New York), Oct. 

 24 (AP): Democratic Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton 

 said yesterday that Republican challenger John Spencer was 

 treading into swampy territory with his reported 

 comments that she wasnt very attractive when she was 

 younger and may have had a lot of work done to improve her 

 looks.

 Its unfortunate that, when you dont have anything positive to say about the issues, that we can get off in some pretty swampy territory, Clinton said during a campaign stop at a senior citizens centre.

 Polls have shown Clinton far ahead of Spencer in the Senate race. Elections are on November 7.

 Spencer, in an interview, flatly denied making such comments to a reporter-columnist for the New York Daily News during a flight on Friday from New York city to Rochester for the first of two weekend debates between the Senate contenders.

 Its a fabrication. I would never call Hillary Clinton ugly, he said. Thats outrageous. I didnt do it.

 Spencer acknowledged talking to reporter Ben Smith on the flight. Smith said Spencer made the comments during a flight in which Spencer, his wife and Smith sat together.

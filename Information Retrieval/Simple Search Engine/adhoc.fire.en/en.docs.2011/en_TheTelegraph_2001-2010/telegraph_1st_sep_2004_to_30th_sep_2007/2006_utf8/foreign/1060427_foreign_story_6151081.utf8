 Karachi, April 26 (Reuters): Relatives of a 14-year-old Pakistani girl kidnapped her and shot her four times in an attempted honour killing, a senior police officer said today.

 Nur Jehan was shot in the stomach, leg, knee and arm outside Karachi and left for dead by her cousins, who accused her of having sex with a man. Lying in a government hospital ward protected by armed policemen, she said how she had been driven to Gadap, a low-income neighbourhood, to be executed.

 Nur Jehan said she crawled out of the ditch to a road and screamed for help. They will try to kill me again, said the waif-like girl.

 She also feared for the lives of her parents and siblings, who were also kidnapped by her attackers.

 Nur Jehan was declared a kari, or black woman, by her cousins who accused her of having sexual relations with a man in Mirgoldop, a village in the southwestern province of Baluchistan where her father was a farmer.

 Investigating police officer Raees Ahmed Ghani said her cousins had also killed the man with whom she was accused of having sex. Fearing for his daughters life, Nur Jehans father moved the family to Karachi after she was declared a kari.

 But on April 19, Nur Jehan was kidnapped and shot. I fear for my father who didnt want to kill me when the relatives declared me a kari, she said.

 The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan says an average of 1,000 women are killed every year in Pakistan over family honour. 

 Most of these women are killed by their husbands and male relatives after being accused of having sex outside marriage.

 UN: Emissions by rich nations at highest level

Oslo, Oct. 30 (Reuters): Greenhouse gas emissions 

by industrialised nations rose in 2004 to the highest levels since the early 1990s, 

and governments must do more to fight global warming, the UN climate change secretariat 

said today.

 Emissions by 40 nations, including backers of caps under the UNs Kyoto Protocol and outsiders led by the US, rose to 17.9 billion tonnes in 2004 from 17.8 billion in 2003 and 17.5 billion in 2000, it said.

 Economic revival in Russia after a downturn since the collapse of the Soviet Union contributed to stoke emissions, it said in an annual report. But emissions also rose since 2000 in the EU, Japan, the US and Canada. Industrialised countries will need to intensify their efforts to implement strong policies which reduce greenhouse gas emissions, said Yvo de Boer, the head of the UN climate change secretariat in Bonn. 

 A British report today also said that ignoring climate change could lead to an economic downturn on the scale of the 1930s Depression far more than the costs of acting to head off the problem. The climate change secretariat said the 2004 rise put overall emissions, mainly from burning fossil fuels in power plants, factories and cars, just 3.3 per cent below 18.6 billion tonnes in the Kyoto benchmark year of 1990. And 2004 emissions were the highest since just after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, defying efforts at cuts meant to avert disastrous changes such as more floods, erosion, heatwaves and higher sea levels.

 Thirty-five countries have agreed to cut emissions under the Kyoto Protocol by about 5 per cent below 1990 levels by 2008-12. Ministers will review Kyoto in Nairobi at annual climate talks from November 6-17.

 President George W. Bush pulled out of Kyoto in 2001, arguing that it was a straitjacket that would damage the US economy and wrongly excluded developing nations. The US is the worlds number one source of emissions.

 In 2000, before the revival in Russian industry was felt, overall emissions had been 5.6 percent below 1990 levels. De Boer said it was aworrying fact that emissions in former communist nations had risen by 4.1 percent from 2000-04. Despite the rises, De Boer said that Kyoto countries still had a good chance of meeting their pledged cuts.

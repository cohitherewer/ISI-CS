 Study: Smog bad for sperm

 London, March 23 (Reuters): Smog is not just bad for the lungs. It can hit a mans sperm count too, a Californian study revealed yesterday.

 The University of Southern California looked at the sperm counts of 48 men.

 Using air pollution measurements from the area where each man lived, Rebecca Sokols team estimated how much pollutant they were exposed to in the days leading up to each donation.

 The team found that ozone formed in smoggy air was the only pollutant that appeared to be linked to decreased sperm production.

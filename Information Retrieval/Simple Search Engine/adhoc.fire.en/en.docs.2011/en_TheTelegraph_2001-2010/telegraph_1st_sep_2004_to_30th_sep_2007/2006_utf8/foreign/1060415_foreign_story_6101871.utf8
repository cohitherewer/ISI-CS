 US generals call for Rumsfelds ouster

 Rumsfeld: Under attack

 Washington, April 14: A whispering campaign against Donald Rumsfeld has burst into the open with two generals who helped him plan the Iraq war denouncing his leadership and calling on him to resign.

 Major General John Batiste, who commanded a division in Iraq last year, became the fourth recently-retired general to attack the defence secretary for his handling of the war and demand new faces at the Pentagon.

 I believe we need a fresh start at the Pentagon, he told CNN, adding that many of his peers agreed. It speaks volumes that guys like me are speaking out from retirement about the leadership climate in the department of defence.

 His criticism carried all the more weight because before serving in Iraq he was the senior military assistant to Paul Wolfowitz, the deputy defence secretary from 2001 to last year.

 The Pentagon has long sought to belittle criticism from former generals as the carping of an old guard.

 Generals have been muttering about Rumsfeld almost since he took up his post in 2001, for the second time in his career, pledging to overhaul the bureaucracy and make the military lighter on its feet.

 But in recent days accusations that he is a micro-manager who bullies and ignores his generals have become much more public and personal.

 In a striking mea culpa, Lieutenant General Greg Newbold, the Pentagons top operations officer from 2000 until October 2002, said at the weekend that he and other generals had failed their soldiers by not challenging the war hawks.

 Never again, we thought [after Vietnam] would our militarys senior leaders remain silent as American troops were marched off to an ill-considered engagement, he wrote in Time magazine.

 Its 35 years later and the judgment is in: we have been fooled again.

 He accused the politicians of distorting intelligence before the war, failing through arrogance to send in enough troops and denying the seriousness of the insurgency.

 The commitment of our forces to this fight was done with a casualness and a swagger that are the special province of those who have never had to execute these missions ? or bury the results.

 He concluded with a swipe at generals who know the hard consequences of war but with few exceptions acted timidly when their voices urgently needed to be heard.

 Tom Donnelly, the editor of the Armed Forces Journal, said the new attacks were a grave development. There is a lot of anger and frustration among army and marine officers.

 Fine Print

 Iron Age gel

 London, Jan. 7 (Reuters): The preserved remains of two pre-historic men discovered in an Irish bog have revealed a couple of surprises ? one used hair gel and the other stood 6 feet 6 inches high, the tallest Iron Age body discovered.

 He would have been a giant... the other man was quite short, about 5 feet 2 inches, said Ned Kelly, head of antiquities at the National Museum of Ireland.

 The shorter man appeared to attempt to give himself greater stature by a rather curious headdress which was a bit like a Mohican-style with the hair gel, which was a resin imported from France, Kelly told BBC radio.

 Bacterial conditions found in the peat bogs preserved the remains so that even fingerprints were clearly visible.

 The fashion-conscious gel wearer has been named Clonycavan Man and the other was dubbed Oldcroghan Man. 

 Word truth

 Albuquerque, New Mexico (AP): A panel 

 of linguists has decided the word that best reflects 2005 

 is truthiness, defined as the quality of stating 

 concepts one wishes or believes to be true, rather than 

 the facts. The American Dialect Society chose the word on 

 Friday after a runoff with terms related to Hurricane Katrina, 

 such as Katrinagate, the scandal erupting from 

 the lack of planning for the monster hurricane.

 Kilt change

 St Louis, Missouri (AP): A southeast Missouri student who was told to change out of his kilt at a high school dance can wear the garment to future school functions, a lawyer for the district said. He can wear that kilt to school if he wants,, Jackson school district lawyer Steve Wright said on Friday. But Wright cited one exception. Though he said its not anticipated, student nathan warmack could be asked to change if the kilt-wearing somehow resulted in a problem or disruption.

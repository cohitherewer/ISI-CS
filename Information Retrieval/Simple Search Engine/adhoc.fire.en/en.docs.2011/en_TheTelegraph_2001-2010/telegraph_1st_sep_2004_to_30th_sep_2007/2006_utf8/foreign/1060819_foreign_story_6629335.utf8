 Aniston annoyed

 New York, Aug. 18 (AP): Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn engaged? Dont be ridiculous, Aniston says.

 The Friends actress told People magazine that reports of her engagement to the Be Cool actor, including an article in Us Weekly, are false, calling the stories insane.

 Im not engaged, and I dont have a ring, and I havent been proposed to, Aniston, 37, told People, according to an article appearing on the magazines website on Wednesday. Us reported in an August 9 cover story citing anonymous sources that Vaughn had proposed to Aniston on June 27 on a private jet after a trip to Mexico. 

 Japans obese island

 Tokyo (Reuters): Burgers and booze have 

 bloated waistlines so much in Japans southern island 

 of Okinawa that authorities in the capital have launched 

 a slimming competition. Girths are growing across Japan 

 as lifestyles and diets have become more westernised. But 

 the problem is at its worst in the island of Okinawa, where 

 45.4 per cent of men are obese.

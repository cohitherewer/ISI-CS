The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Murder scare for Mills

 Mills: Beatlephobia

 London, Dec. 17: The estranged wife of Sir Paul McCartney has been warned by police that her life may be in danger from two violent Beatles fans. 

 Heather Mills was visited twice in two days by Sussex detectives last week and told that they have received a tip-off that two Liverpudlian men, both with criminal records, could be seeking to murder her. 

 The move appears to be linked to her fall-out with McCartney, the former Beatle who is revered in his home city of Liverpool. The officers named two men who they fear may be targeting Mills. Neither is known to her. 

 Friends of Mills, 38, a former model, say she is really worried by the threat, both for herself and, even more so for her three-year-old daughter, Beatrice. 

 One friend said: Heather was visited on Thursday by police who said they had very serious intelligence that her life was at risk. They said they thought they knew who was behind it. 

 The motive appears to have a link to some of the more extreme stories that have appeared about her, including the false report that she has turned down a divorce settlement of up to 30 million. This is not even true. She has not been offered anything (as settlement). 

 Mills has stirred up strong and mixed public emotions over her troubled relationship with McCartney: the couple separated in May after a four-year marriage. While her supporters say she is a caring mother and a wronged wife, her critics says she is unstable, and portray her as a money-grabber and a fantasist.

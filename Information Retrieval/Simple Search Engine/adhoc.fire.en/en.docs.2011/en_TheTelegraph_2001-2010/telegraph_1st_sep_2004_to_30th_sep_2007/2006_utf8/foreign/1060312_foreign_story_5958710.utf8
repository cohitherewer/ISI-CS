 Kathmandu, March 11: Nepals very own Little Buddha, Ram Bomjan, who had been meditating for the last 10 months in a forest in southern Nepal, has been reported missing since this morning.

 According to reports reaching here from the 16-year olds home in Bara district, Bomjan left with a disciple early this morning. He had reportedly moved to another site within the Ratnapuri forest where he planned to continue with his meditation peacefully.

 Bomjan had been bothered by the constant public and media attention every since a Kathmandu-based daily reported about him and his unique feat of meditating without food and water for several months. The media instantly dubbed him as the Little Buddha as he had adopted the same meditation posture as Buddha and chose a peepal tree for his penance.

 The media had also quoted his mother Maya as saying that he showed all the characteristics as Buddha did since a very tender age. She claimed that Bomjan would attain enlightenment after six years of meditation.

 Following the media glare, the government asked the Lumbini Development Board and the Royal Nepal Academy of Science and Technology to investigate the boys achievements. The board constituted a team which is yet to submit its findings.

 Today, Ram Lama, secretary of the special committee formed to manage the devotees visiting Ratnapuri to seek the blessings of the young boy, said he did not have any idea about Bomjans whereabouts. He, however, dismissed reports saying that Bomjan may have been abducted. He has left along with one of his colleagues. He must have gone in search of a quieter place, radio reports quoted Lama as saying. Visitors were only allowed to see him from 50 metres away and the boy was hidden from public view at night behind a curtain drawn by his followers. The police in Bara district said they had launched a search to locate Bomjan. However, some reports said that the boy had left as he was perturbed after a mysterious fire broke out near his meditation site few days ago. Locals said that Bomjan was unaffected by the fire.

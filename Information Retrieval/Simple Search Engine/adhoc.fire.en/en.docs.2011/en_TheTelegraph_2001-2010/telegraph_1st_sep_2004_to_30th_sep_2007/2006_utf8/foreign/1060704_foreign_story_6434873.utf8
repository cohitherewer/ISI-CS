 Credit cards bearing death

 AMIT ROY 

 London, July 3: The parallel with impoverished Indian farmers, who have committed suicide, is not exact but the tragedies in India have some painful similarities with the case in Britain of Richard Cullen, who killed himself after failing to pay his debts. 

 An investigation on BBC televisions flagship Panorama programme last night revealed that while one part of the Royal Bank of Scotland was hounding Cullen, a 65-year-old mechanic, to pay back his debts, another part of the same bank was tempting him with ever more credit. No one here in Britain is suggesting that individuals do not have responsibility for exercising restraint over their spending but what is being questioned is the lending policies of banks and other financial institutions who give with one hand and seek to take away with the other. 

 The upshot is that, in the case of Cullen, now that it has been exposed by the media, the Royal Bank of Scotland, as solid and conservative an organisation as it is possible to find in Britain, is to be investigated by the Banking Code Standards Board. 

 In January last year, Cullen, from Wiltshire, killed himself after building up debts of ?130,000 on credit cards. When he died, he had 22 different credit cards with several different lenders. 

 Cullen owed the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) more than ?35,000 through four different cards, despite having an annual income of just ?15,000. In November, 2004, two weeks after he was pursued for arrears on his Mint card, which is operated by the RBS, the credit limit on his Tesco Personal Finance card, also run by the RBS, was increased by ?1,000 to ?7,700. Shortly afterwards, he was found dead in his garage after inhaling exhaust fumes. 

 The four credit cards Cullen held with the RBS cost him more than ?4,300 in interest and charges alone during the last year of his life ? nearly a third of his annual income. 

 The investigation now will examine whether the banks lending policies require revision. Seymour Fortescue, chief executive of the Banking Code Standards Board, which runs the industrys voluntary code of practice, said he would investigate the case to see if the code had been breached. 

 He said: We have to talk to Royal Bank of Scotland to see if a breach of the Banking Code occurred. If that appears to be so, then we would start a disciplinary process, but we are not at that stage yet. He found it extraordinary that such a situation had been allowed to develop, adding that it appeared to be a case of the right hand not knowing what the left hand is doing.

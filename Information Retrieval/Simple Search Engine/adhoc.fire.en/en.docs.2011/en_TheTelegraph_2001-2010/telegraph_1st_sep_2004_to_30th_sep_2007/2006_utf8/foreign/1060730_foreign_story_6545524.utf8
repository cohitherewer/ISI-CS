 UK blackout makes Indians feel at home

 London, July 29: The British seem to be going out of their way to make Indian visitors, especially those from Calcutta, feel at home.

 Not only has the temperature in London been higher than in Calcutta but the British have thoughtfully introduced another Indian custom ? load shedding. All in all, the natives in London are getting a trifle restless.

 On Thursday, as demand for air-conditioning soared because of the continuing heat wave, parts of Oxford Street and Regent Street were plunged into darkness. Even the neon signs in Piccadilly Circus were switched off.

 And today, the power supply group EDF warned that thousands of homes and businesses in London may have to get used to load shedding. EDF Energy, formerly London Electricity before being bought by French power firm EDF, has about five million customers mostly in London and southeast England. 

 The only thing remaining is for the engineers in London to send an SOS to their colleagues in Calcutta.

 The supply situation has been exacerbated by faults in central London which have increased pressure on the London grid, with EDF appealing to customers to dim their lights and switch off air-conditioning just when the latter is needed most in near 38 degree Celsius temperatures. EDF Energy appealed in a statement: Prudent use of power by those in the affected area, for example turning off air-conditioning wherever possible, will help this situation. 

 Furious traders along Oxford Street and Regent Street, favourite haunts of well-heeled tourists from India, were forced to close when the shutdown wiped out tills, lighting and air-conditioning.

 Oxford Circus Tube station, one of the busiest in London, was closed for almost an hour and a half and big name shops were among those forced to close temporarily.

 Florence Torrens, head of communications and marketing at Liberty of London, in Regent Street, said: All the systems went down. So many businesses and shops were affected in this area of central London.

 Jace Tyrrell, spokesman for the New West End Company which represents businesses on Oxford Street and Regent Street, said: This is bad news for business and bad news for shoppers in the West End. We are very disappointed on behalf of businesses. It is even more disappointing for shoppers who turn to stores to escape the heat. Retailers took a view that in most cases they had to close for security reasons.

 Network Rail revealed that about 1,800 trains were affected by the power cut. South London was hardest hit and Transport for London said 60 per cent of the Tube network was affected. 

 London Fire Brigade took 400 calls and rescued about 100 people stuck in lifts. 

 The mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, estimated that at least 250,000 people were affected and said the situation showed the need for a serious look at the National Grid and why power went down for so long. 

 Weve never had this catastrophic failure before and we clearly cant have it again, he commented.

 St Thomass Hospital, in southeast London, was among establishments which had to rely on back-up power generators. The power cuts come three days after EDF Energy announced its second price rise this year. From early next week the company will charge 19 per cent more for gas and eight per cent for electricity. This will affect 1.3 million gas and 3.5 million electricity customers.

 The company raised its prices in March, when its electricity went up 4.7 per cent and gas 14.6 per cent. EDF blamed the increases on soaring wholesale fuel costs something likely to affect all economies.Meanwhile, a lady visitor from Calcutta, a journalist, who went shopping for a pair of fancy shoes, ended up by buying a pair of made in India chappals.

 Fruit fly theatre

 Providence (Rhode Island), Dec. 9 (AP): Play or plague?

 Producers of the Jean-Paul Sartre play, The Flies, at Brown University will subject the audience to 40,000 fruit flies to bring to life the existentialist work about flies sent to plague the city of Argos in ancient Greece.

 Production Workshop, the student-run theatre producing the play, built a cage of netting 3 meters high by 4.8 meters by 6.6 meters to surround the stage and about 70 audience members, and to keep the flies from infesting the theatre.

 Irkutsk, Russia, July 9 (Reuters): A Russian airliner veered off the runway after landing in Siberia today, ran into nearby buildings and burst into flames, killing at least 122 people, emergency officials said.

 More than 50 others were injured, many suffering from burns.

 Survivors told Russias NTV that passengers had applauded a smooth landing when the overnight long-haul flight from Moscow touched down in Irkutsk. But the plane did not slow down and crashed through a wall and into a garage.

 Many of the 204 people on board were children, including 14 pre-teen children, flying for holidays on Lake Baikal, a popular Siberian spot in summer. Three people on board were not on the official register of passengers, emergencies ministry said.

 At least 122 bodies had been recovered and 55 people were in hospital being treated for burns, trauma and the effects of smoke inhalation. The fate of 12 passengers was unknown.

 It was awful. I saw people burning, they were burning, Margarita Svetlova, who survived the crash, said. I probably lost consciousness for a minute... I unfastened my seat belt. I ran and started shouting and swearing, looking for an exit.... The inflatable escape chute wouldnt inflate, but I jumped all the same. I was lucky, I just hurt my leg a bit. 

 Sibir airlines flight 778 from Moscow to Irkutsk, an Airbus A-310, overshot the runway at around 2.50 am Moscow time (2250 GMT). 

 The only surviving stewardess opened an emergency exit, enabling passengers in the rear of the plane to jump to safety. 

 I heard a bang and the earth shook, Mikhail Yegerev, a witness, said. I went out and saw plumes of smoke and the planes tail.

 Some 600 workers used cutting gear to recover bodies after taking two hours to douse the burning Airbus fuselage.

 Kathmandu, Aug. 26 (AP): Cheered by scores of wedding guests, two gay men exchanged garlands today in the first public same-sex marriage in tradition-bound Nepal.

 The guests, mostly activists from gay and lesbian rights groups and a few relatives applauded as Anil Mahaju, 25, and Diya Kashyap, 21, exchanged vows in Kathmandu. The marriage, however, will not receive official approval, as Nepali laws do not recognise same-sex unions, said Suni Pant, who heads the Blue Diamond Society, a nongovernmental organisation.

 There was no Hindu priest present to conduct the marriage. They have decided to get the marriage registered but I think they will have to wait for a new constitution that would legitimise same sex marriages, Pant said.

 Rights groups are hoping a new constitution, currently being prepared by experts, would provide Nepals gay and lesbian community with their civic rights.

 Although there are no official figures, Pant said there were around 20,000 gay men and 1,000 lesbians in Nepal a country with a population of around 25 million where homosexual sex is a crime punishable by up to two years in prison.

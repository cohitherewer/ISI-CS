 Medics get death for HIV in children

 Tripoli, Dec. 19 (Reuters): A Libyan court sentenced five Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor to death today for deliberately infecting hundreds of children with the virus that causes AIDS, provoking a chorus of western condemnation.

 The ruling in a deeply politicised case could set back oil producer Libyas hopes of better ties with the West, which meant a deal that saves the six from execution was still likely, analysts said.

 The childrens relatives broke down in tears and hailed the ruling that ended a seven-month retrial as a welcome act of defiance of the West. Justice has been done. We are happy, said Subhy Abdullah, whose daughter Mona, 7, died from AIDS contracted at the hospital in the town of Benghazi where the medics worked. They should be executed quickly.

 The six deny infecting 426 children, more than 50 of whom have since died, with HIV at the hospital in the late 1990s. 

 The defendants main lawyer said they planned to appeal to the supreme court against their latest conviction, which some analysts say Libya may use to strengthen its hand as it seeks foreign financial compensation in order to placate the families.

 Libya said the fate of six might end up in the hands of a body senior to the supreme court, a so-called high judicial council which is led by justice minister Ali Omar Hassnaoui.

 Whatever the verdict of the supreme court, the defendant has a chance before the high council, Hassnaoui said.

 The six were first found guilty in a 2004 trial and sentenced to death by firing squad. 

 But the supreme court quashed the ruling last year, citing unspecified failings in the case, and ordered a retrial.

 I am so sick I had to take pills today to go through this new ordeal, said Zorka Anachkova, mother of convicted nurse Christiana Valcheva.

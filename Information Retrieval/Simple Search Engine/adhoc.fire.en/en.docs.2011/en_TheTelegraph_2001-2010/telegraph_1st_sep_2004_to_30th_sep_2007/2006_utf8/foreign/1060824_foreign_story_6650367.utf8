 Islamabad, Aug 23: A united Pakistan Opposition today submitted a no-confidence motion in the National Assembly against Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz.

 The motion has been submitted with signatures by 141 Opposition members, chief of the six-party Islamic alliance, Mutahida Majlis-e-Amal (MMA), Qazi Hussain Ahmad, said after reading out the notice.

 It also contains a 500-page chargesheet highlighting corruption and irregularities of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League (Quaid-e-Azam). 

 According to the Pakistan constitution, a resolution for a no-confidence vote against the Prime Minister must be moved by at least 20 per cent of the members of the House and voted upon after a minimum of three days but not later than seven days. The Prime Minister must cease to hold office if the resolution is passed by a majority of the total members of the House.

 However, since the ruling coalition enjoys the support of 201 members of the 342-seat National Assembly against the Oppositions 141, there is hardly any chance of a change in the present set-up. The Shaukat Aziz government also enjoys the full support of the army.

 But it could prove an embarrassment for Aziz, a former banker and finance minister picked to head the government in 2004 by President Pervez Musharraf.

 It could also give heart to those opposed to Musharraf, the army chief who seized power in a bloodless military coup in 1999, in the run-up to a general election next year, analysts said. 

 Conservative religious parties and liberal supporters of former Prime Ministers Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif joined forces to submit the motion. All the leading Opposition parties and alliances including the MMA, the Alliance for Restoration of Democracy, Pakistan Oppressed Nations Movement , are united on one point the military has nothing to do with politics and running governments, Ahmad said.

 Aziz, a former Citibank executive, has been credited with pushing through economic reforms that have turned the economy around. Gross domestic product growth was 8.4 per cent last year and is expected to come in at 6.6 per cent this year. But poverty is still widespread and many Pakistanis complain about rising prices.

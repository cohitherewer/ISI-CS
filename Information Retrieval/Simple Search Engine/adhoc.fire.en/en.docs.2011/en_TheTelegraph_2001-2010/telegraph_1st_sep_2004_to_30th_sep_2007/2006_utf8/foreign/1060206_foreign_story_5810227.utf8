 Moss and Quinn: Beauty beyond ages 

 London, Feb. 5 : Kate Moss is to be immortalised as Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love, by the artist who sculpted a naked, disabled and pregnant woman on a plinth in Trafalgar Square. 

 Marc Quinn is working on five life-size bronzes of the supermodel in contorted yoga positions with her feet behind her ears. 

 Quinn is best known for his 12-ft marble sculpture, unveiled in September, of a naked Alison Lapper, who was born without arms and with shortened legs. 

 His statues of Moss, who he describes as the iconic beauty of our age, will be unveiled at a gallery in Groningen, Holland, in a fortnight. They are also expected to be a highlight of Quinns exhibition at the Mary Boone gallery in New York in April next year. 

 As an art world taster, Quinn has created a model statue of Moss in marble, called Sphinx, which he has sent to the gallery. It shows her in a leotard with a serene expression and her legs behind her head. 

 The gallerys director, Ron Warren, said: Its not meant to be titillating, its meant to show how the body can be malleable. 

 Quinn wants the statue to encapsulate Mosss beauty for ever. Shes a kind of Aphrodite figure of our age, he said.

 Moss, who was interviewed by police last week over allegations of cocaine use, has been a favourite for British artists for a decade. Lucian Freud sold a portrait of her for ?4 million in 2004.

 Moss back to rule after fall

Madrid, Aug. 10 (Reuters): A year is a long 

time in fashion.

 Last September, Kate Moss was persona non grata after a British newspaper printed pictures of her apparently snorting large amounts of cocaine. High street fashion chain Hennes amp; Mauritz temporarily pulled an advertising campaign featuring the British supermodel, Parisian fashion house Chanel said they would not renew her contract and she was notable for her absence from Burberry ads.

 Fast forward almost a year and Moss is not only back, she dominates the fashion world once again.

 Pick up the hefty new issue of British Vogue and a glowing Moss graces the cover. Flick through the ads for the new autumn collections and the cheekbones that made her millions appear for eight different labels a huge number for one magazine. From a sleek Louis Vuitton ad to a supermodel-inspired photo for Versace to a languid nude shot for Longchamp and a return to the British house of Burberry, the 32-year-old is ubiquitous.

 Her fall was significant and it is interesting to see her rehabilitation, said Jay Fishman, managing director of Financial Research Associates, adviser to celebrity businesses.

 In some ways it shows us how tolerant people can be of celebrities foibles if they do what they are supposed to do to get out of it. A lot of people buy into the story of Ive overcome my demons and Im back, he added.

 After the photographs were printed, Moss went to a US drug rehabilitation clinic and issued an official apology for her behaviour, although she made no direct reference to the Daily Mirror allegations she took illegal drugs.

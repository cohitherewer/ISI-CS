 Quest for a Jolie shot

 Windhoek (Namibia), April 25 (Reuters): Its the million-dollar shot.

 An exclusive photograph of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie with their newborn, especially one taken in the far-flung African state of Namibia where they are staying, would be gold dust to the lucky snapper.

 Little wonder paparazzi from around the world are lurking outside the Burning Shores Lodge in the seaside resort of Langstrand where the couple are staying ahead of the birth, due in mid-May. It would be one of the biggest celebrity pictures of all time if there was a genuine exclusive, said Darren Lyons, founder of London-based Big Pictures, one of the biggest celebrity photo agencies. It would be over a million dollars.

 He confirmed he had a team in Namibia, a sparsely populated land with deserts, huge sand dunes and game reserves, but would give no other details. He, like many others, believes, however, that the odds are stacked high against a genuine scoop. Not only must the paparazzi contend with cloth screens surrounding the luxury resort.

 The police have joined private security guards to protect Jolie, 30, and Pitt, 42, from prying lenses. The couple may also throw a spanner in the paparazzis works by posing for a selected media outlet. South Africas Sunday Times reported that Jolie had sold exclusive rights of the first pictures of the baby to US celebrity magazine People, which would in turn donate $3.5 million to Unicef. This could not be independently confirmed.

 People magazine also reported that the couple have an aircraft on standby should they decide to have the baby elsewhere, though doctors usually advise against flying late in pregnancy.

 US television news magazine Dateline NBC has already had access to the couple, with correspondent Ann Curry travelling to Namibia for an exclusive interview with Jolie.

 Few will find the going so easy.

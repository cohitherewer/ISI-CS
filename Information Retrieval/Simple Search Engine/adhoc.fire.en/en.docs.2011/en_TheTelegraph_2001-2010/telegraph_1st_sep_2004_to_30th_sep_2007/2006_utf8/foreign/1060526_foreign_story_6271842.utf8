 Kathmandu, May 25: The Nepal government today began preparing the ground for talks with the Maoist rebels by releasing all detained members of the outfit from various prisons all over the country. 

 The decision to release the detainees was taken at a cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala here today. 

 The cabinet has decided to release all Maoist detainees in order to create a conducive environment for talks, home minister Krishna Prasad Sitaula said after the meeting.

 The cabinet also formally added the names of minister for culture, tourism and civil aviation Pradip Gyawali and minister of state for transport and labour management Ramesh Lekhak to the team which will represent the government at the talks with the Maoists. The team is headed by Sitaula himself.

 The home minister said it was decided at the meeting to form a committee to trace all those who were reported missing after being taken into custody by the security forces. The Maoists claim that about 1200 of their colleagues are in government custody.

 The rebels have already formed a three-member team for the talks headed by Maoist spokesman Krishna Bahadur Mahara. They have also promised to consider the code of conduct compiled by the Seven-Party Alliance, to be followed by both sides during the talks.

 Mao-style China code for youth 

 Beijing, March 17: The Chinese leadership has issued an eight-point ethical code to instil civic virtue in the countrys wayward youth.

 In a throwback to campaigns of the Mao Zedong era, the to do list mixes slogans from the early years of the communist revolution with the carefully worded pragmatism that is the mark of the current Communist Party general secretary, President Hu Jintao.

 Serve the People! ? Chairman Maos most famous motto ? becomes the more specific Serve and do not disserve the People!.

 Maos Preserve modesty and prudence become Know plain living and hard struggle.

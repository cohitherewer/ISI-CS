 Chavez to Condolences: Dont mess with me

 Chavez: Blunt

 Caracas, Feb. 20 (AFP): Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has launched a new verbal attack against US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice, bluntly warning her: Dont mess with me, girl.

 Responding yesterday to Rices remarks before the US Congress last week in which she called the Venezuelan President a challenge to democracy in Latin America, Chavez warned the top US diplomat to back off.

 She messed with me again, he said in his weekly Hello President television show, deliberately mangling her name as Condolences. Dont mess with me, girl.

 Last week, after her US Congress testimony, Chavez dismissed Rice as the imperial lady.

 He vowed yesterday that Washington would fail in its bid to arouse international opinion against Caracas, and accused the Bush administration of fomenting transit strikes and other unrest to destabilise his country.

 Venezuela is free and however much they may try to instigate internal movements here, we will defeat them, he said.

 On Friday, Chavez had warned that he was taking steps to potentially cut off oil shipments to the United States if Washington attacks his country.

 Iran twin assurances to Annan

 Annan: Negotiator

 Tehran, Sept. 3 (Reuters) - Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad today told UN secretary-general Kofi Annan that he supported a UN resolution on Lebanon and was determined to negotiate an end to Tehrans nuclear standoff with the West.

 Annan said the comments came at a meeting in Tehran during the UN chiefs tour of West Asia to shore up the ceasefire that halted a 34-day war between Israel and Iranian-backed Hizbollah.

 Annan said Ahmadinejad reaffirmed Irans support for the ceasefire.

 On the nuclear issue, he reaffirmed Irans determination to negotiate and find a solution to the crisis, Annan said. But the president also said Iran would not suspend enrichment before talks as demanded by the UN.

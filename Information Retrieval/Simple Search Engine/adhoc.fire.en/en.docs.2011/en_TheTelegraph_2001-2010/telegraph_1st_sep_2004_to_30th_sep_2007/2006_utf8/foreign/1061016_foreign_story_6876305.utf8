 Pristina, Serbia, Oct. 15 (AP): Pledging to provide a voice for the troubled province, Nicole Kidman has begun a tour of Kosovo, her first as a UN goodwill ambassador to support womens rights.

 Kidman yesterday arrived in Kosovos capital, Pristina, after attending the premiere of her new movie Fur at the inaugural Rome Film Festival. She was scheduled to spend two days in the province.

 Im here... to learn so that I can help your country at this crucial, crucial time for the future, she said. To meet people, hear their stories and educate myself, and I suppose be a voice for you if you need it.

 Dressed in black pants and a blouse, Kidman shook hands with Kosovos top UN official, Joachim Ruecker, dozens of local leaders and diplomats attending a welcome reception.

 She was named goodwill ambassador of the UN development fund for women, or Unifem, in January.

 The Hollywood star is expected to travel today to the town of Djakovica, among the hardest hit areas during the 1998-99 war. 

 Some 1,000 men went missing from the town in the conflict.

 Kosovo, which formally remains part of Serbia, has been run by a UN mission since mid-1999, when Nato forced Serb forces to halt a crackdown on independence-seeking ethnic Albanians.

 Kidman visited the province at a sensitive time, with ethnic Albanians and Serbs are engaged in tense negotiations over the future status of Kosovo. Ethnic Albanians want full independence for the province of 2 million, while Serbia insists Kosovo should remain under its sovereignty.

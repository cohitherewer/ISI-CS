 Blair critic quits Labour

 London, Oct. 20 (Reuters): Former minister Clare Short, a vocal critic of Britains decision to join the Iraq invasion, quit the Labour Party parliamentary group today, accusing Tony Blair of running an error-prone government.

 The outspoken Left-wing parliamentarian said she would remain a MP but had resigned its whip, meaning she would no longer be a part of its faction in parliament.

 Ex-workers of WTC eatery open restaurant

 New York, Jan. 6 (Reuters): Former workers from the opulent Windows of the World eatery, which once graced the 107th floor of the World Trade Center, saw a dream become reality yesterday with the opening of their own restaurant in Manhattan.

 More than four years after the September 11 attacks that destroyed the World Trade Center and killed 73 of their co-workers, chefs, waiters, bartenders, busboys and dishwashers who worked at Windows have come together to run an upscale restaurant named Colors.

 This restaurant is about diversity, bringing together different cultures, assistant chef Francesco Palmieri said as he stirred a Caribbean-style conch stew. The restaurant, a few doors down from Greenwich Villages Public Theater, is about a 20-minute stroll from where Windows on the World was located.

 There are no tributes to the scenic Windows restaurant that once seemed to float atop the trade centers north tower, but the old haunt was still on the minds of many.

 Sometimes I think about it, said line cook Kissima Saho of Gambia, West Africa, as he chopped lobsters. I miss my crew members who lost their lives. I miss them. I miss the money I used to make.

 Sous chef Jeane Pierre said:There are a lot of Windows people here. ... We were tight. From 9/11 we have a bond. Pierre, a native of Haiti, said the 50-member cooperative of former Windows on the World employees was trying to help New York build another restaurant.

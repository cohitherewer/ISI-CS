The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 Fresh warning 

 London, Aug. 13 (AP): Authorities 

 today warned Britons to remain vigilant, saying they may 

 still be in the crosshairs of Islamic terrorists after security 

 forces foiled an alleged plot to bring down packed trans-Atlantic 

 planes.

 Home secretary John Reid said authorities were conducting two dozen separate counterterrorism investigations in Britain, and there was no guarantee the government would be able to thwart every plot.

 We believe we have the main targets from this particular surveillance and plot, Reid said. (But) there are still people out there who would carry out attacks.

 Those sentiments were echoed by US homeland security chief Michael Chertoff, who said there was a risk that other groups might try to strike on the false assumption that security forces might be distracted.

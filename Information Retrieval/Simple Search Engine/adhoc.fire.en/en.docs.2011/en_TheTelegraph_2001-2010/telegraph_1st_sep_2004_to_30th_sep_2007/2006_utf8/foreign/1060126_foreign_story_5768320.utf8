 Hamas set to gain in elections

 Ramallah (West Bank), Jan. 25 (Reuters): Palestinians voted today in their first parliamentary election in a decade, with the Islamic militant group Hamas expected to dent Fatahs near-monopoly on power and further complicate any prospects for peacemaking with Israel.

 A senior source with one of several groups conducting exit polls said Hamas looked set to get over 30 per cent with more than 40 per cent for President Mahmoud Abbass Fatah. Fatah said its own figures gave it 46 per cent of the vote to about 32 per cent for Hamas. Hamas said it doubted the figures were correct.

 But pollsters caution that there is a big margin for error in their calculations, not least because of the complicated Palestinian electoral system under which half the seats are chosen from party lists and the others on a district basis.

 Amid tight security, Palestinians queued at polling stations across the West Bank and Gaza Strip where they voted after their index fingers were daubed in blue ink to prevent fraud.

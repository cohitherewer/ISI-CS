 Paris, April 5 (Reuters): French trade unions stepped up calls for President Jacques Chirac to ditch a disputed youth jobs law today, their cause bolstered by mass street protests and the sliding poll ratings of Chiracs government.

 As fears grew about the impact of the dispute on the euro zones second largest economy, union leaders were to give ruling conservatives until Monday to agree to repeal the law or risk new protests and strikes, union sources said.

 We want just one thing, that is the withdrawal of the CPE, Rene Valladon of the Force Ouvriere union, told LCI television after a strategy meeting in Paris of Frances 12 main unions. He set a final deadline of April 15 for the repeal of the law.

 Such a move would further weaken Villepin, who fast-tracked the measure through parliament.

 Though most marches passed off peacefully during rallies across France yesterday, 383 people were arrested in clashes in Paris. Arrests were also made in the western city of Rennes after youths stoned police.

 Chiracs office issued a statement with the President urging students and schoolchildren to go back to their classes, but protests continued in parts of France today.

 Hundreds of students erected makeshift blockades on major routes into the western cities of Poitiers and Rennes, causing traffic jams of up to several kilometres .

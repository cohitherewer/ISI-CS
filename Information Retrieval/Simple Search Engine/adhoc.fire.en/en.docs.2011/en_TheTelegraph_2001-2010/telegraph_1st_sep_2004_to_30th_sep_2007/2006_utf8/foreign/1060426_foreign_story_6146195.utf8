 Iran UN threat

 Tehran, 

 April 25 (Reuters): Iran said today it would freeze 

 ties with the UN nuclear watchdog and speed up its atomic 

 programme if it were hit by international sanctions.

 If you impose sanctions, Iran will suspend its relations with the (IAEA) agency, chief nuclear negotiator Ali Larijani said on nuclear issues in Tehran. Suspension means we will accelerate our activities.

 US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice, who like other western leaders accuses Iran of having a secret programme to build nuclear weapons, said in Greece: I suppose the Iranians can threaten but they are deepening their own isolation.

 The verbal sparring preceded an influential report on Iran that International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) head Mohamed ElBaradei is to deliver to the UN Security Council on Friday. Rice called for credible steps to curb Irans nuclear work and said the UN Security Council had to take action in light of Irans continued defiance of international norms.

 Larijani said Irancannot be expected to act transparently in its nuclear activities if it was attacked militarily ? a last-resort option the US has refused to rule out.

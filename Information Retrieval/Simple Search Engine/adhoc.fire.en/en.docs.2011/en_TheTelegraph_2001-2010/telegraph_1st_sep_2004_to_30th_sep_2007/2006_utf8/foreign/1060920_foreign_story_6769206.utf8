 Scarlett mystery

 Johansson: Curvy confidence

 New York, Sept. 19 (AP): 

 Scarlett Johansson shows off in cleavage-baring dresses 

 on the red carpet, but in real life, she would rather remain 

 a mystery.

 I cant stand those articles where people spill their life story, Johansson says in the October issue of InStyle magazine. 

 After a while I feel like I know more about them than their best friend does and thats weird. Its better when you dont know everything.

 The 21-year-old actress, whose screen credits include Lost in Translation and Match Point, plays a former prostitute in The Black Dahlia, opposite Hilary Swank and Josh Hartnett.

 Johansson says: Do I ever get nervous about this, right now, being the pinnacle of my career? Yeah, I do. At the end of (filming) every movie I think: Wow this is the last one! Nice working with you.

 Shes more confident about her hour-glass figure. Im curvy Im never going to be 511 and 120 pounds. But I feel lucky to have what Ive got. And, given the chance, shed like to trade lives with President George W. Bush. 

 Whose life would I like to step into for the day? The Presidents. I could probably get some things done in the Oval Office.

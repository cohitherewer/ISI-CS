 Hello! Babys on the Net

 Jolie: Photo leak

 London, June 7 (Reuters): The celebrity magazine Hello! today launched legal action against Internet sites that printed a leaked exclusive shot of Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt with their infant daughter.

 Just as People magazine announced it had landed exclusive North American rights to the first pictures of the baby, an image of the newborn Shiloh Nouvel Jolie-Pitt and her parents popped up on at least two websites as the cover shot for Hello!

 We were very shocked and horrified to see that this embargo has been breached, Juliet Herd feature editor for Hello! magazine, which sells in Britain, Spain, Turkey, Russia, Dubai, Thailand and Greece, said. Hello! is taking legal action around the world to stop Internet sites and everyone else who may seek to publish, she said. We are sending out legal cease and desist letters to each of these sites.

 Herd added: It is very difficult to control the web and this proves how rampantly out of control it is. We have absolutely no idea how the picture was leaked. 

 The couple announced on Monday that they had agreed to let photo agency Getty Images market pictures of their newborn with all proceeds going to help the less fortunate.

 Experts said worldwide rights to the pictures could sell for anything between $5 million and $7 million.

 The picture surfaced on celebrity-lampooning Defamer.com and the LiveJournal gossip blog (www.community.livejournal).

 Defamer.com, whose image portrays the baby in a golden glow, said: Mere moments after staring upon the Chosen Ones image, we felt as if we were bathed in the same golden light that surrounds the infants still frail form.

 Alison Crombie, spokeswoman in London for Getty Images, said: Our legal team is looking into it and we will take it from there. But I really dont think it will devalue the pictures as everyone is dying to see the full set.

 Other deals are still being negotiated, she said.

 The baby was born on May 27 in a hospital in Namibia where an army of paparazzi had descended, hoping to capture their own photos of the child.

 For celebrity magazines and photo 

 agencies, there is increasingly cut-throat competition to 

 land exclusives and sate the appetite of readers obsessed 

 by the lives of the stars.

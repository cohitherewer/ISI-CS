 Prodi polls

 Rome, April 11 (Reuters): Centre-Left leader Romano Prodi claimed victory in Italys election today but his tiny margin raised fears of political paralysis and Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconis allies demanded a review of the count.

 Prodis alliance won narrowly in the lower house and Sky Italia TV projected that it would have a majority of one or two seats in the upper house Senate thanks to votes of Italians abroad that were still being counted.

 We can govern for five years, Prodi said. Of course well need cooperation, but last night I said we would work for all Italians, not just some of them.

 However, the victory margin was so slim that the Centre-Right refused to concede.

 In the lower house Chamber of Deputies Prodis winning margin was around 25,000 votes, a tiny fraction of the 47 million eligible electors.

 In the Senate, the Centre-Left was set to have a one or two seat majority.

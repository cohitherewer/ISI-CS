 Jacko rocks Japan

 Tokyo, May 27 (Reuters): Michael Jackson appeared in public in Tokyo today for the first time since his acquittal on sex-abuse charges last year, accepting a music award and thanking all the people who believed in me.

 Introduced to an adoring crowd at a Tokyo stadium as the king of pop, the king of rock and the king of soul, Jackson flashed a quick peace sign as he walked onstage to the sound of one of his biggest hits, Thriller.

 Id like to say to the Japanese people from the bottom of my heart: I love you very, very much, the 47-year-old entertainer said. Receiving a Legend Award at MTVs Japan Video Music Awards ceremony, Jackson said: I thank the fans around the world and I thank the fans in Japan. I promised myself I wouldnt be emotional when I got up here, he said, as his voice cracked and trailed off. Then he added,I think you are very sweet, generous and kind people.

 Japan bill for woman in throne

 Tokyo, Jan. 20 (AFP): Japans Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi pledged today to submit a bill to parliament early this year to allow women to ascend the Chrysanthemum throne for the first time in centuries.

 In order to make sure the imperial throne will have stable succession in the future, I will submit a bill to revise the Imperial House Law in line with the report, Koizumi said. The report was issued last November by an advisory panel. He made the comment in a policy speech to parliament.

 No boys have been born to the imperial family since 1965, putting the royal tradition of male-only succession in a crisis. Crown Princess Masako, whose only child is four-year-old Princess Aiko, has come under intense pressure to produce a male heir. 

 Proposed changes to succession laws enjoy strong public support. However, the proposals have been vocally opposed by traditionalists.

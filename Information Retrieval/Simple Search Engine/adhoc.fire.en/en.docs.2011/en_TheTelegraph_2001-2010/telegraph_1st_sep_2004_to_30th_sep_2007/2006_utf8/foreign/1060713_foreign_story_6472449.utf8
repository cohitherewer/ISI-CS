 Israel soldiers kidnapped

 Qasmiyeh (Lebanon), July 12 (Reuters): Hizbollah guerrillas captured two Israeli soldiers and killed up to seven Israelis today, in what Israel described as an act of war by Lebanon that would draw a very painful response.

 Israel mobilised a reserve infantry division and Hizbollah declared an all-out military alert.

 Two Lebanese civilians were killed in an Israeli air strike on a coastal bridge at Qasmiyeh. Four other bridges in the south were hit.

 The sources said the Israeli soldiers had been seized at around 0600 GMT across the border from Aita al-Shaab, some 15 km from the Mediterranean coast.

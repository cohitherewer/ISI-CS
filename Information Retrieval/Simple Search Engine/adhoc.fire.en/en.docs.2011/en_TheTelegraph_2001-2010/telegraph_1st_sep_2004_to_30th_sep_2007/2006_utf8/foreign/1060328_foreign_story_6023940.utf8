 Voyage of Lennon

 London, March 27: A ships log depicting a remarkable voyage in which John Lennon steered a yacht to safety amid a tropical storm is to be auctioned next month. The log is one of three lots which represent important moments in Lennons life, reports The Daily Telegraph.

 The 1980 sea voyage is especially significant because it marked an end of the former Beatles 10-year writing block and led to his final solo album, Double Fantasy.

 Lennon had always dreamed of making an Atlantic crossing. When a visit to an oracle in South Africa suggested that the safest voyage would be in a south-westerly direction, Lennon decided to charter the 44 foot schooner Megan Jaye and make for Bermuda. 

 Just hours after leaving Newport, Rhode Island, the vessel found itself in the middle of a ferocious tropical storm and, one by one, members of the crew fell ill. When the final crew member, the ships cook, also succumbed, Lennon lashed himself to the wheel and steered the vessel to safety.

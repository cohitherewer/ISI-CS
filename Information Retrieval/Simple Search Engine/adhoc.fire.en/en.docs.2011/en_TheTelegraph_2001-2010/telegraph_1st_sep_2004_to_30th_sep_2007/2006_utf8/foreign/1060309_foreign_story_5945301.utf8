 Lover glasses

 London, March 8 (Reuters): Researchers have come up with a novel way to keep long-distance lovers in touch ? high-tech wine glasses that glow warmly however far apart the pining couple are.

 When either person picks up a 

 glass, red light-emitting diodes glow on their partners 

 glass. When one puts a glass to their lips, the other glass 

 glows brightly. Distance is not a problem as liquid sensors 

 and wireless links have been built in to the glasses. 

 Massachusetts Institute of Technology researchers said communal drinking is a vital part of social interaction that lovebirds miss out on when separated.

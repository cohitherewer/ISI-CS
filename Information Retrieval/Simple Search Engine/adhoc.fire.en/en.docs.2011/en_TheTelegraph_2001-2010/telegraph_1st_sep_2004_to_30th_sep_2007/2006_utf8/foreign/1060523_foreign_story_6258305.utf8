 WHO chief dies after blood clot

 Lee Jong-wook: Tragic

 Geneva, May 22 (Reuters): World Health Organisation chief Lee Jong-wook of South Korea died today two days after suffering a blood clot on the brain, the UN agency said.

 Lee, 61, was spearheading the organisations fight against global threats from bird flu, AIDS and other infectious diseases. WHO director-general since 2003, Lee was his countrys top international official.

 I am sorry to tell you that Dr Lee Jong-wook, director-general of the WHO, died this morning, Spanish health minister Elena Salgado, who was chairing the session, told the opening meeting of the agencys annual assembly.

 Her voice trembling, Salgado described Lee as an exceptional person and an exceptional director-general.

 UN secretary-general Kofi Annan called Lees death devastating and noted his deep commitment to fighting scourges such as AIDS and malaria and preparing the world for a possible bird flu pandemic.

 Not only was he valuable leader to WHO staff the world over, but a cherished colleague and friend to me personally, Annan said. Work at the annual Assembly, which runs until Saturday, was briefly suspended. Flags at the UNs European headquarters, where the Assembly was being held, flew at half mast.

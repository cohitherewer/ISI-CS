The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 ?100-million test for Madonna

 Madonna: Global jaunt

 London, May 7: Madonnas forthcoming world tour is set to be the most lucrative series of shows ever staged by a female performer, despite being scheduled around her childrens school holidays and, much to the annoyance of some fans, is due to visit only 11 countries. 

 The Confessions On A Dancefloor tour, which includes 54 dates in three months, is about half the size of global tours mounted by bands such as U2 and the Rolling Stones. But music industry experts believe that Madonnas tour, which starts in Los Angeles at the end of this month, will earn more than ?100 million and see her topple Cher ? whose recent two-year tour made ?90 million ? as the female artiste whose tour raises the largest amount of money. 

 Madonnas shows are expected to earn more because of high ticket prices ? British fans will pay between ?80 and ?170 ? and restricted appearances, to keep down touring costs. Aside from two dates in Japan, the tour will be confined to America and Europe. 

 This has provoked criticism, not least from Australian fans, who believe that they have been unfairly excluded.

 Molly can stay in Pak till decision

 Islamabad, Dec. 8 (Reuters): A girl at the centre of a tug-of-love between her British mother and Pakistani father was ordered today to remain in Pakistan for another month while the countrys supreme court decided her fate.

 The father of 12-year-old Molly Campbell filed an appeal with the supreme court yesterday after a high court last week ordered that she be returned to her mother in Scotland.

 Supreme court chief justice Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry suspended that order today pending the outcome of the appeal. The status quo shall be maintained. The minor will not be removed from Pakistan, the judge announced on the first day of the hearing. The case was adjourned until the second week of January.

 Police in Britain launched an investigation in August after Campbell left her mother in the Western Isles of Scotland to travel to the Pakistani city of Lahore to be with her father.

 Campbell, known by the Pakistani side of her family as Misbah Irum Ahmed Rana, says she wants to stay in Pakistan with her father. She was not present in court when the decision was announced but later said she was happy.

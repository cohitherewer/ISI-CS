 Iran tests missile that can evade radar

 Tehran, March 31 (Reuters): Irans armed forces today successfully test fired a domestically-produced missile which can evade radar, state television reported.

 According to analysts the development can be worrying for western forces in the Gulf.

 Western nations have been watching developments in Irans missile capabilities with concern amid a standoff over the Iranian nuclear programme, which the West says is aimed at building atomic bombs. Iran says the programme is civilian.

 The missile command of the air force of the Revolutionary Guards has successfully tested a new generation of missiles, Hossein Salami, head of the Revolutionary Guards air force, said.

 This missile can evade radar and it can evade anti-missile missiles, he said.

 This technology is completely new, without copying any other missile systems that may exist in other countries, he said, adding that the missile could carry multiple warheads. State television said the type of missile tested was called Fajr-3. Fajr is the dawn prayer.

 Lee Willett, head of the military capabilities programme at Londons Royal United Services Institute, a defence think-tank, said the missile could be a worry for western navies in the Gulf, wary of threats that could cut off shipping lanes.

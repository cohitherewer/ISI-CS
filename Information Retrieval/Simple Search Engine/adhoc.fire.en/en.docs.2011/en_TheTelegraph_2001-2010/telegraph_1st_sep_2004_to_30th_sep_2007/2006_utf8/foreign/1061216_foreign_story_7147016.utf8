 Blair admits ending probe

 London, Dec. 15 (AP): Prime Minister Tony Blair has defended a government decision to halt an investigation into alleged bribery in a multibillion dollar arms deal between BAE Systems PLC and Saudi Arabia, saying today that he took full responsibility for the controversial move.

 Blair said advising the Serious Fraud Office to drop its long-running investigation was necessary to ensure national security. 

 The fraud office was probing allegations that BAE ran a 60 million slush fund offering sweeteners to officials from Saudi Arabia in return for lucrative contracts as part of the Al-Yamamah arms deal in the 1980s.

 Costner to return to Field of Dreams 

 Des Moines (Iowa), Aug. 2 (AP): Kevin Costner has been pretty much a ghost in Dyersville since starring in Field of Dreams in 1989.

 He has not returned to the eastern Iowa town since its famous cornstalks resurrected Shoeless Joe Jackson and other long-dead ballplayers on the big screen 17 years ago.

 But now comes word that Costner will return. 

 The star will appear on August 11 at the baseball field in Dyersville as part of a Rolling Roadshow tour, in which 10 classic movies are being shown at the sites of their filming.

 Netflix, an online movie rental service that organised the tour, confirmed this week that Costner will make an appearance before the movie is shown on a 9-metre inflatable screen in the outfield. Costner will play a free concert with his unnamed rock band, followed by the movie. 

 Field of Dreams was an Academy Award nominee and featured one of the most famous movie lines ever: If you build it, they will come.

 Returning to the Field of Dreams location to play a concert ... has special meaning for me, Costner said. The movie was significant in my career, and the band is an important part of my future.

 Space probe to hunt planets

 Paris, Dec. 27 (Reuters): European scientists launched a satellite today to seek out new Earth-like planets beyond the solar system and to explore the interior of stars, the European Space Agency (ESA) said.

 The French project, dubbed Corot (COnvection, ROtation and planetary Transits), sent into orbit a telescope capable of detecting planets smaller than is currently known some maybe just a few times the size of Earth and rocky, rather than the larger, gaseous types, ESA said.

 An ESA spokeswoman said Corot launched smoothly from Kazakhstan but officials would only know whether the satellite had separated from its launcher correctly at around 1630 GMT.

 Corot will be able to find extra-solar planets of all sizes and natures, contrary to what we can do from the ground at the moment, Claude Catala, one of the researchers associated with the project, said.

 We expect to obtain a better vision of planet systems beyond the solar system, about the distribution of planet sizes, Catala said. And finally, it will allow us to estimate the likelihood of there existing planets resembling the Earth in the neighbourhood of the sun or further away in the galaxy.

 Planets have been found orbiting stars other than the sun but they have never been seen. Instead, scientists have deduced they are there based on the stars wobble, the result of the gravitational pull of planets revolving around them.

 Corot, a project of the French National Space Studies Centre in which ESA is participating, will be able to detect smaller, rocky planets by using a different method.

 It will measure the light emitted by a star and detect the drop in brightness caused when a planet passes in front of it. Like the larger planets found so far, however, these new ones will have to be orbiting close to their star.

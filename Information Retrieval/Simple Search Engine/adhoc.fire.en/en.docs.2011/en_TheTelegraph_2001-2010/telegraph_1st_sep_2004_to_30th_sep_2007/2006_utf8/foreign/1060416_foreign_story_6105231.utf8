 Rumsfeld play a big success

 Rumsfeld: Stuff Happens

 New York, April 15 (Reuters): A play that skewers US defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld as arrogant and war-mad has opened to a largely favourable welcome in New York this week, even as former generals turn against him in Washington.

 In Stuff Happens, by British playwright David Hare, Rumsfeld is described as a velociraptor and at one point his character says: I could eat a baby through the bars of a crib.

 The growing number of retired US generals who have called for his ouster has not gone that far describing Rumsfeld, but the arrogance and failure to heed military advisers that they accuse him of are given dramatic life in Hares play.

 The play casts Rumsfeld and vice-president Dick Cheney as driving President George W. Bush in a rush to war in Iraq, and portrays former secretary of state Colin Powell as clashing with the others over the need for war.

 The play superbly captures the decision making, manipulations and miscalculations that have by now been thoroughly documented, the New York Post said in its review of the play. Stuff Happens is a riveting piece of theatre that well justifies the playwrights description of it as a history play, in the Shakespearean tradition.

 First produced in London in 2004, Stuff Happens takes its title from Rumsfelds quip dismissing the looting after US troops entered Baghdad. Drawing on recorded quotes from Bush and his closest aides, the play recreates the build-up to the March 2003 invasion of Iraq, including many closed-door scenes that Hare imagined entirely.

 In contrast to Post and the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal panned Stuff Happens. As a documentary, it said, the play was a flop, full of coarse caricatures and stiff with smugness, that stroked the preconceptions of an audience that sniggered from start to finish.

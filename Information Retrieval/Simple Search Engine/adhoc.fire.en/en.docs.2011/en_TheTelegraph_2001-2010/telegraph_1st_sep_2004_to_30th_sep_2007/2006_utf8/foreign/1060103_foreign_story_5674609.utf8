 Film buff Hollywood would like to clone

 London, Jan. 2: The average American goes to the movie theatre fewer than six times a year, which makes Richard Troncone way, way above average. 

 In his West Los Angeles home, the 54-year-old computer wizard keeps a careful list of every film he has seen during the last 40 years. Since 1988, he has watched 2,445 movies, averaging more than 135 films a year ? all of them in a theatre. 

 But last year, Troncone decided to go for a personal best by trying to top his record of 176 movies set in 1972 (and confirmed by nobody but him). He knew he had have to sit through some duds. 

 I dont want to come across as a nut case, he said when asked what drove him to take in such lacklustre offerings this year as the sequel Miss Congeniality 2 ? Armed and Fabulous and the futuristic muddle The Island. I just love movies. I guess thats an understatement.

 If there were ever a year that Hollywood executives would pay to clone Troncone, 2005 would be it. With domestic box-office receipts down 5 per cent from 2004, some in the movie industry fear that Americans young and old are permanently altering the way they consume entertainment. Whether or not such a sea change is underway, one thing is clear: For many, the lure of the big screen is no longer enough. 

 Thats where Troncone could teach Hollywood a thing or two. Of the 400 or so movies released last year, he has watched more than a third of them, supplementing his total with classics such as Goldfinger and Klute. Not counting Twizzlers, his snack of choice, Troncone spent about $1,700 last year at first-run and revival theatres. 

 Movies are supposed to be larger than life, he said, calling going to a theatre not just a communal experience but an event. 

 Asked to name his top 10 films, however, he scrunched up his face and wrung his hands, embarrassed, before giving up. Its like having 10 kids and asking me to choose my favourite.

 Troncone is no critic. He is a moviegoing everyman ? a former soldier who has been married for 30 years, drives a 2004 Saturn and has a particular weakness for slash-and-stab horror flicks. The client-services technician at AIG SunAmerica Asset Management Corp. reads film reviews but doesnt let them dictate his viewing. I like to make up my own mind, he says. To that end, he sees almost everything, and what he likes and dislikes doesnt always jibe with commonly held ideas about which movies appeal to different genders and generations. 

 For example, despite being four decades older than the movies targeted demographic, he admired how faithful Sin City was to Frank Millers graphic novel by the same name. The political thriller Syriana ? which marketers aimed squarely at college-educated adults like Troncone ? was enjoyable, he said: But I didnt know what the hell was going on. He thought Good Night, and Good Luck was fabulous and predicted that the film would win an Academy Award.

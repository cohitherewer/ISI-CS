 Slapper in slammer

 Bogota, Feb. 25: A Colombian man has been sentenced to four years house arrest for slapping a womans bottom as he rode by her on his bicycle, sparking debate on whether the punishment fit the crime.

 Showing re-enactments of the incident, television news shows were filled yesterday with legal experts offering opinions about the judgment handed down earlier in the week by Bogotas district court.

Some said that to confine bicycle messenger Victor Garcia to his home for four years for smacking Diana Marcela Diazs buttocks was excessive. Others said it would deter other men. One programme showed three models having their denim clad bottoms smacked so hard by a phantom hand it could be clearly heard by television viewers. The women said they hoped the case would mean they would be safer while on foot.

 New York (AFP): The world record for 

 a musical instrument sold at auction could come under threat 

 in May, when Christies offers a rare Stradivari violin 

 for sale in New York. The violin, known as The Hammer 

 after the 19th century Swedish collector Christian Hammer, 

 has been given a pre-sale estimate of $1.5 million.

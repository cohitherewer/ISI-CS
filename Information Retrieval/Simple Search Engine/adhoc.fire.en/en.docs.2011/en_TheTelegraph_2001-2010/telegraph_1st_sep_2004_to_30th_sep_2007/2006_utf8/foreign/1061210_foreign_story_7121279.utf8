 Moscow, Dec. 9 (Reuters): 

 A fire at a Moscow drug rehabilitation clinic today killed 

 45 female patients and staff whose attempts to flee were 

 hampered by metal grilles blocking escape routes, emergency 

 services said.

 The fire, which broke out in the early hours of the morning, was likely caused by arson, a senior firefighter said . The number of victims has reached 45, deputy emergencies minister Alexander Chupriyan said outside Drug Treatment Hospital No. 17 in southwest Moscow.

 Judging by the position of the bodies, people tried to get out but there was only one fire exit available.

 Crying relatives of the dead arrived to the hospital as ambulances hurried to and from the yard of a two-storey building with white grilles on windows. 

 Some windows had their glass smashed as patients tried to break out of the building but grilles were intact. 

 All the victims were women. Most were patients undergoing treatment for drug and alcohol addiction. Two were clinic staff.

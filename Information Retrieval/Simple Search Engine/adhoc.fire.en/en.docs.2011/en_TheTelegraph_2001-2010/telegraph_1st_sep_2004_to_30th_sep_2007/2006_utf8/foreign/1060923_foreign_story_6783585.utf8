 Pervez loses India excuse

 K.P .NAYAR 

 Washington, Sept. 22: By accident or by design, Indias agreement in Havana to institute a joint anti-terror mechanism with Pakistan could have a damaging effect on elements in Pervez Musharrafs government who continue to export terror.

 Because of the agreement between Musharraf and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Pakistans President was unable to hide behind India when President George W. Bush tackled the general on terrorism at their White House meeting today.

 The US-Pakistan summit today was the lowest point in the anti-terror alliance the two countries forged after September 11, 2001. It was held in the backdrop of a public spat between Bush and Musharraf.

 Bush shocked friends of Pakistan here on Wednesday when he said on TV he would not hesitate to violate Pakistans sovereignty in Americas war on terror. He said he would absolutely order military operations inside Pakistan if Osama bin Laden was located there.

 Musharraf, who was then at the UN General Assembly, immediately said at a news conference that he rejected the idea and asserted that we will do it ourselves.

 Musharraf further differed with the US and its allies on Afghanistan, when he said the presence of foreign forces was contributing to the resurgence of the Taliban.

 He followed up on that yesterday by accusing the Bush administration of threatening to bomb Pakistan back to Stone Age if Islamabad did not cooperate with the US in dislodging the Taliban from power in Afghanistan.

 In the past, when Bush and his officials have demanded more from Pakistan in the war on terror, Musharraf has cited his inability to do so because of problems with India.

 He has pleaded for some leeway because of the popular Pakistani need to support those in Kashmir fighting for freedom from Indian occupation.

 He has also argued that tension with India made it necessary for him to retain troop levels along the India-Pakistan border, making it impossible for any more of the Pakistani military to be deployed along the border with Afghanistan or in areas within Pakistan with a Taliban or al Qaida presence.

 But today, that argument did not hold water.

 Bush said at a joint news conference with Musharraf: I am encouraged by the meetings that the President (Musharraf) and the Prime Minister of India have had. It is an indication that there is desire at the leadership level to solve this long-standing problem.

 The two men papered over their differences. Bush said: We are on the hunt (for Osama) together.

 Musharraf added: Let us not get involved in how it (hunting Osama) ought to be done, by whom it ought to be done.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : International

 2 held over Britain murders

 London, Aug. 23 (Reuters): Police investigating the killings of a woman and her three children whose bodies were found at a house in Cheadle Hulme said today they had arrested a 40-year-old man and a 35-year-old woman on suspicion of murder.

 The police, who are still looking for the husband and father of the murdered family, Rahan Arshad, said the two had been arrested in the Greater Manchester area.

 The arrests come two days after detectives found Arshads car at Heathrow. Police said today they believe he left the country on July 29 and they are liaising with international agencies in a bid to trace him. 

 We are still actively looking for Rahan Arshad, detective superintendent Martin Bottomley of Greater Manchester police said. 

 The bodies of Uzma Rahan, 32, and her children Adam, 11, Abbas, 8, and Henne, 6, were found on Sunday night at their home in Cheadle Hulme.

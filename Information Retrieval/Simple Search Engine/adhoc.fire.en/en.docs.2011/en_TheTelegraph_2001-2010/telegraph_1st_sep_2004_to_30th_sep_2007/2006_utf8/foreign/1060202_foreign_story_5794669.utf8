 New system to fight malaria

 London, Feb. 1 (Reuters): An early warning system based on climate models, average rainfall and data on seasonal malaria can predict the risk of an epidemic of the killer disease five months in advance, scientists said today.

 The system has been devised by researchers in the US, Britain and Botswana.

 We can give warnings of high risk of an epidemic to the health agency and officials in the country ahead of the rainy season, said Tim Palmer, a climate modeller at the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts in Reading, England.

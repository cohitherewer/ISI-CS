 Spoilt brats at home? Send them to China

 PETER SIMPSON 

 Tough time

 Beijing, Aug. 13: Strapped into a safety harness, the small, plump, 10-year-old boy is clinging for dear life, 20ft up a pole on a military assault course on the outskirts of Beijing. Hao Yi, whose double chin is being pinched by the strap of his hard hat, is frozen in fear and he has wet himself. 

 Come on, Meatball, you can do it! bellows his no-nonsense instructor, Jing Huang, dressed in fatigues. Hao Yi has to negotiate an impossibly narrow plank suspended high above the ground. The childs face is twisted with exertion and anxiety. I cant do it, he cries. 

 Hao Yi a Little Emperor product of Chinas single-child policy was happy at home last Monday, watching DVDs, playing computer games and being pampered by two sets of indulgent grandparents, who fed him sweets and meals on demand. 

 Then on Wednesday, to loud protests, he was packed off to hell otherwise called the Golden Dream Summer Camp. Here, anxious middle-class parents such as Hao Yis his are bankers have paid 2,000 yuan (132) to inflict a 10-day short, sharp shock upon their spoilt, domineering children. 

 There are 60 children aged eight to 13, mostly boys, at this summer boot camp, which enjoys full use of the facilities of the Armoured Engineering Academy, where China trains tank crews. It is one of scores of similar camps that have sprung up across the country. 

 At Golden Dream, the children are woken at dawn and fed a meagre breakfast of rice porridge. Lights out is at 9.30 pm. They have suffered from too much love, says the camps director, Song Hao. They lack discipline, are lazy, selfish and expect to be waited upon. 

 Chinas single-child policy was introduced in 1979 to curb rapid population growth, which means that some of the childrens parents were also indulged only children. The parents were over-pampered, said Song, but the latest generation is worse because they have been spoilt rotten. Parents and grandparents who look after them cant cope, so they send them here. 

 We are here to instill confidence, says Song. 

 Conditions are somewhat spartan. The children are stripped of mobile telephones, MP3 players and pocket money on arrival. They live in cramped, bare dormitories with no television sets or air-conditioning. A single, noisy fan whips round the humid air and empty crisp packets. 

 The beds are really hard, theres mosquitoes and no TV or computers, and we have to do our laundry by hand, says 11-year-old Feng Yi, lying on his messy bunk reading a comic during his lunch break. But its sometimes fun. 

 Mr Song believes that it is not only the children who lack discipline. During one camp, a girl who managed to hide her mobile phone summoned her parents to rescue her. Three friends did the same. 

 The following day, four mothers arrived in a BMW and began haranguing Mr Song over the allegedly rough treatment being meted out to their children. 

 quot;I couldnt tell the difference between the behaviour of some of the mums and their children, quot; he says. quot;When you see a mother argue with their son or daughter, its like watching two six-year-olds. Neither has developed their emotions properly. quot; 

 Last year, he started a day camp for parents. quot;They come to learn how to discipline their kids and learn how to say no to them, quot; he said. 

 quot;They also discover how they were denied a proper childhood because they were not allowed to learn to fend for themselves. We are trying to get the two generations to grow up together. quot;

 Pakistan follows Bengal model for English study

 IMTIAZ GUL 

 Islamabad, Dec. 8: What Bengal thinks today, Pakistan thinks tomorrow.

 The English subject will be compulsory from class I onwards all over Pakistan from the next academic year which begins on September 1, 2007, the English-language Dawn newspaper quoted education minister Javed Ashraf Qazi as saying in Islamabad.

 Pakistan has travelled the same road, a few steps behind Bengal, where the Left Front government withdrew English from primary schools after taking power in 1977, only to reinstate it some two decades later. 

 General Zia-ul-Haq had switched the medium of instruction to Urdu in the early 1980s. Zia had contended that only 1.4 per cent of public sector institutions teach their students in English. 

 The Pakistan government has decided to gradually switch to English from Urdu as the medium of instruction in educational institutions to help students improve their language skills and excel in higher studies. 

 Qazis remarks came after severe criticism by leading educationists who said that changing the medium of instruction to English will not achieve the required results till the government changes the outdated system of education. 

 It will be an uphill task for the government to produce a corps of capable teachers with good command of the English language, especially in a country where the literacy rate is not even 60 per cent, educationist and former education minister Anita Ghulam Ali told The Telegraph. Ali, who hails from the southern Sindh province and has vast experience in education, said English should be taught from class VI onwards as is the practice now. 

 She added that Urdu should remain the medium of instruction at primary levels as it helps students understand subjects like mathematics, physics and chemistry better. 

 The former minister said the government was trying out various plans as it did not really know what to do. 

 The government should realise that teaching English as a subject and using it as a medium of instruction are two different things, she said. Any imprudent decision might prove lethal in the absence of a strong base and robust education system.

 Whaling ban 

 Frigate Bay (St Kitts and Nevis), June 19 (Reuters): Japan and other whaling nations yesterday for the first time in more than two decades got a whaling group to criticise a global whaling ban. 

 The approval of a non-binding pro-whaling declaration by the International Whaling Commission (IWC) does not immediately threaten the 1986 moratorium on commercial whaling. 

 But in backing by 33 votes to 32 a statement that said the whaling ban was no longer necessary, the IWC boosted Japans hopes of chipping away at the ban. 

 Pak water 

 Parachinar, Pakistan (Reuters): Rival Pakistani villagers battled each other for water on Monday, using rifles, mortars and rocket-propelled grenades after one group tried to divert an irrigation canal. 

 Sobhraj case 

 Kathmandu (PTI): Nepals supreme court will review the murder case involving Charles Sobhraj, who is serving a jail term in the Himalayan nation. Two judges on Sunday decided to summon the government attorney to begin a hearing after Sobhraj himself submitted a petition, his lawyer said.

 Veil swipe

 London, Oct. 5 (Reuters): 

 A senior British cabinet minister said Muslim women who 

 wore full veils made community relations more difficult, 

 sparking criticism from Islamic groups.

 Former foreign secretary Jack Straw, now leader of the House of Commons, said a veil was a visible statement of separation and difference and that he felt much more comfortable dealing with people with their faces uncovered. Straw said he was concerned that wearing the full veil was bound to make better, positive relations between the two communities more difficult.

 Germany mishap toll

 Bad Reichenhall (Germany), Jan. 3 (Reuters): An ice rink whose roof collapsed killing up to 15 people, including children, could cave in completely, hampering efforts to reach those still trapped, German rescue services said today.

 Schools in the region were on holiday and many children and their parents were inside the building in the Bavarian town of Bad Reichenhall when the roof, weighed down by masses of snow, fell in yesterday. Rescuers worked through the night to remove wreckage.

 We have found the external walls have moved outwards ... if they go any further then we will have to suspend the rescue effort, said chief fire officer Rudi Zeif.

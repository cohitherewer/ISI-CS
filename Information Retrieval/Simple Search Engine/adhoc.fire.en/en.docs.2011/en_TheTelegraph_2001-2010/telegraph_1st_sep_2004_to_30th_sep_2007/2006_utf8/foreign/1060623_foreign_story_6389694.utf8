 Time tops noun list

 London, June 22 (AP): For those who think that society is obsessed with time, the Concise Oxford English Dictionary added support to the theory today in announcing that the word is the most commonly used noun in the English language.

The is the most popular word overall, 

followed by be, to, of, and, a, in, that, have and i. On the list of the top 25 

nouns, time is followed by other indicators of the movement of the 

clock: year is in third place. The compilers used the Oxford English 

Corpus ? a research project into English in the 21st century ? to come up with 

the lists.

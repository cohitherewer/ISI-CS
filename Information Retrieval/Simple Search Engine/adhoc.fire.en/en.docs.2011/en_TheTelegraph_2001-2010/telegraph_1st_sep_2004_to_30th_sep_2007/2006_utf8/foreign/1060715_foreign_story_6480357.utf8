 Convent change

 New York, July 14 (PTI): A quarter century after he stole jewellery and watches from a US convent, a thief appeared to have a change of heart and returned the items along with an explanatory letter.

 Last week, Reverend Joseph Keil of Our Ladys Help of Christians parish in Newton, Massachussetts, received a package containing pocket watches, crucifixes and a wristwatch.

 The package also contained a note explaining that the items had been stolen from the nearby Maria convent in 1981, Keil said.

 Lazy post

 Berlin (Reuters): A Berlin postal worker 

 who was caught with more than several thousand undelivered 

 letters in his basement has admitted he was overwhelmed 

 by the job but insisted he planned to deliver them soon. 

 Police recently found 90 boxes of post stacked in his basement. 

 The postal worker, 36, identified as Thomas H., told Bild 

 newspaper on Friday he was only temporarily storing the 

 post at his house. 

 Star maze

 London (Reuters): A British fan of the 

 cult TV show Star Trek has boldly gone where no man 

 has gone before and created a giant maize maze dedicated 

 to the programme. Trekkie Tom Pearcy used satellite technology 

 to help him cut the maze in the corn field at his farm near 

 York, northern England, to celebrate 40 years since the 

 shows first episode. The maze, whose design includes 

 images of character Spock and the USS Enterprise 

 spaceship, used 1.5 million maize plants.

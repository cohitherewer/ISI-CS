 Islamabad, Oct. 30: Pakistani army helicopters today killed 80 suspected militants in a dawn attack on a madarsa in the Bajaur region of the North West Frontier Province (NWFP).

 The madarsa was run by pro-Taliban commander wanted for harbouring al Qaida fighters, military spokesman Major General Shaukat Sultan said.

 The army said the madarsa in Chenagai, 10 km north of Khar, the main town in the Bajaur tribal region bordering Afghanistan, was being used as a militant training camp. The strike killed almost everyone present in the madarsa, although at least three wounded were taken to hospital in Khar. 

 The compound has been destroyed, Sultan said. According to our local sources, up to 80 deaths have been confirmed, he said. No ground troops were sent in to mop up.

 Residents said they had seen three or four army helicopters flying over Chenagai at around 5 am.

 No prominent militant was believed to be in the compound when it was attacked, Sultan said. Security officials said one of those killed was Maulana Liaqatullah, the proTaliban commander who ran the madarsa. Sultan said there were no women or children present.

 Some villagers said there were young children among those killed, but Maulana Faqir Mohammad, a militant commander at the target site, said that the dead were aged between 15 and 25.

 The operation triggered strong protests in Khar and elsewhere in NWFP. 

 Senior minister and provincial chief of the Jamaat-e-Islami, Pakistans most influential islamist party, Siraj- ul-Haq resigned from his cabinet post and called for national protests tomorrow to condemn the killing of innocent civilians.

 I cannot hold the portfolio of a senior minister... what happened in Bajaur today was condemnable, he told a news conference in Peshawar, the NWFP capital.

 He said the religious alliance Muttahida Majlis-e-Ammal (MMA) would protest against the killing all over Pakistan tomorrow.

 The Jamaat-e-Islami is one of the nine parties in the MMA alliance. It is in power in NWFP but occupies the Opposition benches in Islamabad.

 Last January, Liaqatullah was believed to have had contacts with al Qaida number two Ayman al-Zawahri that led to a missile attack on Damadola village in Bajaur. Zawahri was not present at the time but some al Qaida operatives were killed.

 Pakistans lawless tribal belt along the Afghan border has been a haven for Islamist militants for decades. Many al Qaida and Taliban guerrillas took refuge there after fleeing the US-led hunt for them in Afghanistan after the September 11 attacks on US cities.

 Todays attack came two days after 3,000 militants held a rally near Khar, chanting support for Osama bin Laden and Mullah Omar.

 Talks between tribal elders and militants to reach a peace deal along the lines of the one struck in North Waziristan last month appeared to have failed, local clerics said.

 A mountainous region that is difficult to access, Bajaur lies opposite Afghanistans eastern province of Kunar, where US troops are leading the hunt for al Qaida and Taliban fighters.

 Bajaur is the most northeasterly of seven semiautonomous tribal regions that make up Pakistans Federally Administered Tribal Areas and are home to around 3.5 million people.

 An MP from Bajaur Haroonur Rashid claimed that the troops of the US-led coalition in Afghanistan took part in the operation. However, Sultan denied the claim.

 Pakistani security forces 

 conducted the operation on confirmed intelligence information 

 about presence of 80 militants in a religious seminary, 

 he said.

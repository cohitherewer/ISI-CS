 Travellers to be tagged

 London, Oct. 13: Airline passengers could in future be tagged as part of anti-terrorism measures.

 Travellers would be tracked through airports via chips in plastic wristbands emitting radio signals, and could be watched on cameras. Scientists at University College London are helping to develop the Optag system.

 A trial is planned for a Hungarian airport. If successful, the system could be operational within two years. Passengers would be tagged on entering an airport or at check-in. 

 Sensors, accurate to three feet, linked to a database of passenger information, could update locations every second. Officials could track people under suspicion.

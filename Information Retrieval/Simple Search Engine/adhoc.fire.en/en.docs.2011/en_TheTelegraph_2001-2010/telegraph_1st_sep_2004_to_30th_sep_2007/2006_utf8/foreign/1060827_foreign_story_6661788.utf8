 War paper casts doubt on Grass account

 Grass: Memory loss

Berlin, Aug. 25 (AFP): A World War II document casts doubt on the accuracy of German author Gunter Grasss account of his time serving with the notorious Waffen SS elite Nazi forces, a news magazine said today.

 The online edition of Der Spiegel weekly (www.spiegel.de) said a military record of war injuries showed that Grass was drafted into the Waffen SS two months later than he claims in his autobiography Peeling Onions.

 It contradicts Grasss statement that he became a Waffen SS soldier in September 1944... According to the document, he was only conscripted on November 10, 1944, the magazine said.

 It claimed that the record also challenges the accuracy of other parts of Grasss recollection of his SS service, including to which division he belonged.

 According to Der Spiegel, the document also provides details which the author concedes he cannot remember clearly. The 78-year-old Grass, a Nobel literature laureate, drew an avalanche of criticism when he revealed for the first time earlier this month that he briefly served in the elite force which ran the Nazi death camps.

 Sofia baby dies of cold

 Sofia, Jan. 27 (Reuters): A tiny baby was one of the latest victims of a European winter cold snap which has killed more than 100 people and caused chaos from Moscow to Milan.

 Bulgarian police would not release the name of the six-month old girl from the central town of Stara Zagora, but said her parents told them she died because heat cost too much. Its very sad. Her family was very poor and couldnt afford to heat their house, police spokeswoman Ionka Georgieva said today.

 The cold weather has knocked temperatures to as low as minus 30 degrees Celsius in parts of Europe, disrupted transport and highlighted the regions gas supply problems. Many of Bulgarias 7.8 million people try to keep their costs down by heating only one room in the house during a bitter Balkan winter.

 Smoking ban hailed in UK

 London, Feb. 15 (Reuters): Jubilant health campaigners hailed parliaments decision to ban smoking in pubs and clubs, saying today many lives would be saved and that hundreds of thousands of smokers would quit.

 The House of Commons voted in favour of the ban by a wide margin yesterday after MPs were given a free vote to stave off possible defeat for the government.

 The bill, passed by 384 votes to 184, followed months of heated debate over the extent of a ban that had divided the Labour government. The result means that, 50 years after British scientists became the first to establish a link between smoking and lung cancer, England joins the growing list of countries to ban workplace smoking.

 But while anti-smoking campaigners celebrated and pub owners pondered the implications for business, critics condemned the government for interfering and denying people choice.

 The anti-smoking group ASH said in a statement: We are absolutely delighted that MPs have listened to the arguments, looked at the evidence and decided that comprehensive smoke-free legislation is a cause whose time has come.

 This vote will save thousands of lives, as non-smokers are protected from other peoples smoke and as smokers quit in their hundreds of thousands. The bill now passes to the House of Lords where it is expected to pass without amendment. If so, it will become law by mid-2007.

 This is the most important advance in public health since Sir Richard Doll identified that smoking causes lung cancer 50 years ago, said Alex Markham, head of Cancer Research UK, in a statement. But pro-smoking lobbying group Forest condemned the ban.

 We think it is totally unnecessary and completely illiberal, it said. Unfortunately, members of parliament got it into their heads that because Ireland had chosen an utterly draconian ban, it was inevitable it should happen over here.

 Ireland banned smoking in restaurants, pubs and workplaces in 2004.

 Kerrys Iraq joke draws Bush ire

 Washington, Nov. 1 (Reuters): Democratic Senator John Kerry drew election-year fire from President George W. Bush and other Republicans yesterday for saying college students could get stuck in Iraq if they do not study hard.

 But Kerry, who unsuccessfully challenged Bush in the 2004 presidential election, refused to apologise and said his remark was a botched joke aimed at the President, not U.S. troops.

 With the Iraq war a dominant issue in the November 7 elections, Kerrys comment on Monday gave Republicans, struggling to maintain control of the US Congress, a chance to fight back.

 Kerrys office said later the Massachusetts Democrat had misread his prepared remarks that included the words Just ask President Bush, which he omitted.

 Kerry, who was criticised for mishandling national security issues during his losing White House campaign, angrily accused Republicans who have never been in war of making unfounded attacks.

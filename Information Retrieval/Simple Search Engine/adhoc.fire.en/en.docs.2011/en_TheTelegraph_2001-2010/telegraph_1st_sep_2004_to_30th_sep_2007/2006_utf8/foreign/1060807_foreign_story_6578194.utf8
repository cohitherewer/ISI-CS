 China axe on karaoke

 Beijing, Aug. 6: To the finely tuned ear, the discordant warbling that pours out of Chinas karaoke lounges would be reason enough for the government to pull the plug on the singalong craze, reports The Sunday Telegraph. 

 It is not the tortured octaves that have offended the ruling Communist Party, however, but the lyrics. 

 The ministry of culture has issued new rules to prevent unhealthy karaoke songs from polluting the nations morals and millions of amateur divas, who croon with friends and family down at the local KTV (karaoke music video) parlour, are about to have some of their favourite songs struck off the play list. 

 But it is not the snarling ghetto prose of disenfranchised rappers, nor the rallying cries of disaffected hoodies, that have irked the state censors. 

 According to the state-run Heaven and Earth magazines Top 10 Unclean Songs, tunes most popular with Chinas middle-class and middle-aged masses could be first for the chop. 

 All of Chinas estimated 100,000 KTV lounges will have to buy songs from a central database approved by the government.

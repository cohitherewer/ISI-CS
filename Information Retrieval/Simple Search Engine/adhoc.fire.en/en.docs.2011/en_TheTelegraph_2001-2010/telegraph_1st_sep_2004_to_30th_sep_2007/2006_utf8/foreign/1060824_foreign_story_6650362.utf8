 Dylan slams modern recordings

 Los Angeles, Aug. 23 (Reuters): Bob Dylan says the quality of modern recordings is atrocious, and even the songs on his new album sounded much better in the studio than on disc.

 I dont know anybody whos made a record that sounds decent in the past 20 years, really, the 65-year-old rocker said in an interview with Rolling Stone magazine.

 Dylan, who released eight studio albums in the past two decades, returns with his first recording in five years, Modern Times, next Tuesday.

 Noting the music industrys complaints that illegal downloading means people are getting their music for free, he said: Well, why not? It aint worth nothing anyway.

 You listen to these modern records, theyre atrocious, they have sound all over them, he added. Theres no definition of nothing, no vocal, no nothing, just like ... static. Dylan said he does his best to fight technology, but its a losing battle. Even these songs probably sounded ten times better in the studio when we recorded em.

 Pause in convert case

 Rahman

 Kabul, March 26 (Reuters): The judge presiding over the case of an Afghan man who could face the death penalty for converting to Christianity said today the case was flawed and would be sent back to prosecutors.

 The row over the man, Abdur Rahman, 40, jailed this month for abandoning Islam, threatens to create a rift between Afghanistan and the US and other western backers who have been calling for the mans release.

 The case, because of some technical as well as legal flaws and shortcomings, has been referred back to the prosecutors office, the judge, Ansarullah Mawlavizada, said.

 He declined to say if the review would delay the trial, which had been due to begin in coming days.

 A prosecutor said Rahmans mental state would be examined tomorrow following suggestions that he may be mentally unstable.

 Rahman, detained this month for converting to Christianity, told an Italian newspaper from his Kabul jail cell that he was ready to die for his new faith.

 Death is the punishment stipulated by Shariat, for apostasy ? abandoning the faith. The Afghan legal system is based on a mixture of civil and Shariat law.

 The government is trying to satisfy western demands for the mans release, while not angering powerful conservatives at home.

 Officials in President Hamid Karzais government refused to comment. Im hopeful something will work out, said one. The officials do not think Rahman will be executed. 

 A spokesman for the Supreme Court said the mental examination had been ordered after Rahmans relatives said he suffered from mental problems ? something he denies.

 Checks also had to be made to see if Rahman had a second nationality, the spokesman said, without elaborating.

 Rahman told a preliminary hearing 10 days ago that he had become a Christian while working for an aid group helping Afghan refugees in Pakistan 15 years ago. He later lived in Germany before returning to Afghanistan.

 He was detained after his family told authorities he had converted.

 US President George W. Bush has urged Afghanistan to show it respects religious freedom.

 US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice was asked on NBCs Meet the Press about a report that the case had been dismissed. The Afghans are working on it, she said. America has stood solidly for religious freedom as a bedrock, the bedrock of democracy, and well see, but I cant confirm that story.

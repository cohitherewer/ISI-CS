 Runway dogs

 Skopje (Macedonia), Feb. 9 (Reuters): Two passenger planes of Macedonias national carrier MAT were stacked above Skopje airport until a pack of stray dogs could be cleared from the runway to let them land safely, officials said today.

 A flight from Vienna and another from Zurich were ordered to circle the airfield yesterday after security noticed the dogs playing around on the airfields only runway. The plane coming from Zurich was less than one kilometre from landing when the pilot was told to abort and pull up.

 Passengers were upset when they heard the roar from the engines as I pulled up, chief pilot Blagoja Kukulovski said. To calm everyone down we had to explain what was the reason.

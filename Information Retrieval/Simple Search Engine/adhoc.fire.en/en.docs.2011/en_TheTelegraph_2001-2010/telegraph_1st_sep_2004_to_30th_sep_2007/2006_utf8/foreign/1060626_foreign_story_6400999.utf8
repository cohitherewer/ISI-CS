 Nepal rebels assess opinions

 J. HEMANTH

 Kathmandu, June 25: Maoist chief Prachanda and his number two, Baburam Bhattarai, arrived here late last night for t alks with politicians and prominent citizens ahead of the next summit with Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala.

 The two Maoist leaders had been touring Doti district in western Nepal for a week, briefing cadre on the recent political developments, including the June 16 talks with Koirala and the pact with the seven-party alliance to form an interim government together.

 Prachanda and Bhattarai met CPN (UML) general secretary Madhav Kumar Nepal at an undisclosed location this morning and discussed the controversy over the war of words between the Maoist chief and the army brass.

 Prachanda had suggested on June 16 that since the army couldnt possibly fight the Indian or Chinese forces, it should be downsized to around 20,000 personnel from its present strength of 90,000. Following an army rejoinder stressing its commitment to protecting the countrys sovereignty and territorial integrity, the government accused the force of trying to sabotage the peace process with the rebels.

 The three leaders today also discussed the statements by various people, including members of the Koirala government, on the proposal that the United Nations should manage the weapons of the rebels and the army.

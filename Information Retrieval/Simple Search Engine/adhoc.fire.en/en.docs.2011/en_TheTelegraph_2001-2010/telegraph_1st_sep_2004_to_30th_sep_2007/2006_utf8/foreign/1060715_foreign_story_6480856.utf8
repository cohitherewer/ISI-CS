 UK honour killers get life term

 Samaira Nazir: Barbaric

 London, July 14 (Reuters): A brother and cousin of a London woman, who murdered her in front of other family members including two young nieces because she wanted to marry an unsuitable man, were jailed for life today.

 Samaira Nazir, 25, suffered 18 stab wounds during the barbaric honour killing, Londons Old Bailey court heard today.

 She was killed because she had fallen in love with an asylum seeker from Afghanistan and rejected suitors her family wanted her to marry.

 She bled to death after the frenzied attack during which her throat was cut, and witnesses reported she had been dragged back by her hair into the familys home in west London as she cried for help and tried to escape.

 Her killers were her businessman brother Azhar, 30, and her 17-year-old cousin Imran Mohammed. Her father was also charged with murder but is thought to have gone into hiding in Pakistan.

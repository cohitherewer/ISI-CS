 Official: Fidel on the mend

 Havana, Aug. 5 (Reuters): Cuban leader Fidel Castro is recovering satisfactorily from stomach surgery, the countrys vice-president said today, while government sources said he had started to eat and sat up in bed.

 Brazilian officials denied a newspaper report they had been told by Cuban authorities the veteran revolutionary had a malignant stomach tumour and may never be able to return fully to power.

 Vice-president Carlos Lage, speaking on a trip to Bolivia, was the third Cuban official in the past two days to reassure the Caribbean island that the man who has ruled it for 47 years was on the mend from surgery for internal bleeding. But he gave no further details in the report by the Cuban state news agency Prensa Latina.

 In Havana, where residents were stunned by Mondays announcement that the Comandante had temporarily ceded power to his younger brother, Raul Castro, sources who had spoken to government officials said that while he may not be out of the woods, Fidel Castro was doing well for a man of 79.

 I was told Fidel is doing better, he has eaten something and sat up, one source said, asking not to be identified.

 Neither of the Castro brothers has been seen since the handover of power, triggering uncertainty about Cubas future and speculation that Fidels rule could be drawing to a close.

 In densely populated and crumbling Central Havana, some residents set out for the beach to escape the heat today, the anniversary of riots in 1994, the worst outburst of civic violence communist Cuba has seen.

 The streets were calm, but plainclothes policemen stepped up their vigilance, ready for any trouble.

 The riots led Castro to open the doors to migration, and more than 35,000 Cubans fled to the sea in precarious crafts and rubber tires.

 In Brazil, the Folha de S.Paulo newspaper reported that Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and members of the ruling Workers Party had been told by Cuban officials that Castro had a malignant stomach tumour, and his condition was worse than has been publicly admitted.

 A Brazilian government spokesman said there was no basis to the report.

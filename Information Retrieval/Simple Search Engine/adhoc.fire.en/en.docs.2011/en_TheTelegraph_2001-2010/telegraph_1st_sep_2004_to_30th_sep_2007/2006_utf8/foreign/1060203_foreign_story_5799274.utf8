 UK raise in tobacco age likely

 GEORGE JONES 

 London, Feb. 2: The government is preparing powers to allow the age for buying cigarettes to be raised from 16 to 18.

 Amendments to the Health Bill will let ministers take swift action if consultation on raising the minimum age favours a move to 18, the same as for buying alcohol.

 The government has also tabled amendments to the bill allowing MPs a free vote on whether there should be a total ban on smoking. 

 The legal age limit for buying cigarettes and tobacco was set at 16 more than 70 years ago. In December, the government announced that it would consult on raising the minimum to 18. Ministers believe the move would curb the sale of cigarettes to young people.

 Campaigners argue that bringing the law on cigarettes into line with that on alcohol would reduce under-age smoking.

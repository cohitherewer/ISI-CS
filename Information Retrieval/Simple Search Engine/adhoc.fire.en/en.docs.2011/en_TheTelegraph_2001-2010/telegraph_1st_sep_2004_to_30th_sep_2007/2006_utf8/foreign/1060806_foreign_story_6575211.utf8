 Israel: Time running out

 Jerusalem, Aug. 5 (Reuters): Time is running out for Israels military campaign in Lebanon following the completion of a draft UN Security Council resolution on a cessation of hostilities, an Israeli cabinet minister said today.

 We have the coming days for lots of military moves. But we have to realise the timetable is getting shorter, tourism minister Isaac Herzog, a member of the security cabinet, said on Channel 1 TV in Israels first response to the draft resolution. It is a fact that we have to accept and act in accordance with, he said.

 Herzog spoke after the US and France completed the draft resolution calling for fighting between Israel and Hizbollah, which began on July 12, to end.

 The full 15-member council has to review and accept the text. A vote is anticipated on Monday or Tuesday.

 A second resolution is envisaged a week or two after the first is adopted, setting down conditions for a permanent ceasefire and authorising an international force for southern Lebanon.

 Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said in an interview on Wednesday that Israel would stop fighting when an effective international force deployed in southern Lebanon.

 Laughter oasis

 Al-Madinah Theatre was supposed to show a series of art films and host school shows this summer. Instead, the theatre has become home to scores of refugees and its stage, gallery and halls a cultural oasis where their children can act, draw and watch movies.

 Every day, volunteers show up at the theatre on Hamra Street in Beirut away from Israels relentless bombardment of the capitals southern neighbourhoods and give art and drama workshops to help the displaced youth channel pent-up fears and anger into creative expression.

 On the stage of the main theatre, children scamper around the drama teacher, their giggles echoing through the cavernous theatre. On a lower floor, another group of children bend over sheets of paper, drawing trees and butterflies.

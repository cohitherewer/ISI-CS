 Ershad missing

 Dhaka, Dec. 17 (Reuters): Bangladeshs former army ruler Hossain Mohammad Ershad was missing or hiding today, three days after the high court confirmed a two-year jail sentence against him, his associates said.

 He (Ershad) has remained unreachable since Sunday morning, said his brother, G.M. Quader, a former lawmaker and senior leader of Ershads Jatiya Party.

 Another party leader Kazi Zafar Ahmed, a former Prime Minister, said Ershad was in a hospital in his home town of Rangpur for rest and medical check-ups. Hospital officials told reporters that Ershad had not been admitted.

 Kazi Feroze Rashaid, another leader of the Jatiya Party, said: Our chairman is at his home, taking a rest. 

 Some people said he might be trying to escape arrest after the confirmation of his sentence. Ershad was sentenced by a lower court years ago for squandering state funds in a deal to purchase patrol boats from Japan while he was in power from 1982 to 1990.

 Ershad will not be able to contest the January 23 parliamentary election unless the high court ruling is overturned by the Supreme Court, legal officials said.

 His supporters staged a half-day strike in five northern districts today, demanding a repeal of the court ruling.

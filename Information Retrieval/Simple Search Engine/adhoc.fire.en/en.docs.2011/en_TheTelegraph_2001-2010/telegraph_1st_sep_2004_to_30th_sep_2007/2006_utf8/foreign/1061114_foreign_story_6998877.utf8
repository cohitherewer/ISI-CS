 Paris alert

 Paris, Nov. 13 (Reuters): Some 3,000 people were evacuated from the Tour Montparnasse, one of the tallest buildings in Paris, after a bomb alert, police said today.

 An official from the Paris police department said a bomb warning was called in at around 1530 GMT. Sniffer dogs and bomb experts were searching the building.

 Both SNCF, the French railway operator, and RATP, the Paris local transport authority, said services were not affected.

 Both the Montparnasse train station and the large metro station are next to the building. (Additional reporting by Kerstin Gehmlich)

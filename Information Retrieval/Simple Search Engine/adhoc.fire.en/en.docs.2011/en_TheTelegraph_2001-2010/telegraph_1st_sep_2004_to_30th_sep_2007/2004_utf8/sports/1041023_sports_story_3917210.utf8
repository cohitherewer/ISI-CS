Dhaka: Daniel Vettori captured six wickets as New Zealand completed a hattrick of victories over Bangladesh after clinching the opening Test by an innings and 99 runs on Friday. 

Bangladesh, trailing by 225 runs, were bundled out for 126 in their second innings on the fourth afternoon. They thus suffered their 28th defeat in 31 matches since gaining Test status four years ago. The remaining three matches were drawn. 

New Zealand, who won the previous two Tests against Bangladesh also by an innings margin at home in 2001, comfortably made it three-in-a-row as they needed just 33.5 overs to claim the last eight wickets after the hosts had resumed at 41 for two. 

Vettori (six for 28) and off-spinner Paul Wiseman (three for 64) made batting difficult for Bangladesh with their turn and bounce on a turning track. They triggered the collapse which saw the hosts lose their last seven wickets for 39 runs.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 ?My role is going to evolve over time?

 - For Sunil Gavaskar, innings as consultant begins in very city where he finished his Test career

Bangalore: If the newest India-Australia series 

will have much to do with mind-games then, courtesy Sunil Manohar Gavaskar?s appointment 

as consultant, the hosts have taken more than a head start. 

However, while this Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) move cannot but be welcomed, questions have surfaced. One, of course, is exactly who is going to call the shots? And, just as important, who will take the credit? 

Is it going to be captain Sourav Ganguly (who took the initiative), Gavaskar or coach John Wright? 

?I?m a consultant for the four Tests and don?t see an overlap (of responsibilities),? clarified the former India captain who enjoys iconic status in the fraternity and beyond. 

Gavaskar, by the way, has begun a different innings in the very city he played his last Test, back in March 1987. He came to the Chinnaswamy Stadium in the team bus, on Tuesday morning, and described that experience as ?emotional?. 

It couldn?t have been otherwise. 

According to Sourav, BCCI supremo Jagmohan Dalmiya called around 8.30 pm on Monday to convey that Gavaskar was on his way. It?s not clear whether Wright was the recipient of a similar message. 

In fact, The Telegraph learns that while Wright?s contract has been extended till the end of the season, nothing is in writing. The New Zealander, who is a month away from completing four years, apparently didn?t insist on anything in black-and-white. 

It?s okay when a Bruce Reid becomes part-time bowling coach, but the script will read differently when somebody of Gavaskar?s stature joins Team India. 

For the next month, there?s going to be as much attention on the Rahul Dravids and Harbhajan Singhs as on Gavaskar himself. A longer stint, clearly, is a distinct possibility. In any case, it?s trendy to have a consultant on the rolls. 

In whites (wearing the National Cricket Academy, of which he is the chairman, cap) for the first time since the ?replay? of the tied Test, in March 2001, Gavaskar was more of an observer during nets. He did demonstrate an aspect of front-foot play to Sourav, though. 

?I?ve made notes and will definitely offer inputs at the (pre-Test) team meeting... Basically, my role is going to evolve over time,? Gavaskar said, adding: ?I do have ideas for the series, but it?s best to discuss with the boys.? 

He accepted it was ?tough? coming on board hours before a huge series, but pointed out he had recently watched the Souravs from close. So... 

Speaking about the Australians, Gavaskar felt they had ?lost a massive amount of experience? with Steve Waugh?s retirement and Ricky Ponting?s non-availability (through injury) for the first two Tests. 

?It?s not easy to recoup,? he emphasised. But, then, the Indians will be without the tennis elbow-plagued Sachin Tendulkar in Test No. 1. 

?I don?t have a degree in medicine, but doubt if the weight of his bat is a factor... Particularly in long innings, there?s a tendency to grip the bat harder and, then, the top hand (left for right-handers) gets to be used more...? Gavaskar explained inimitably. 

Incidentally ? and, perhaps, deliberately ? the Australians have chosen not to show unusual interest in the Gavaskar-development. 

Talking exclusively, stand-in captain Adam Gilchrist maintained: ?Technically, he?s the best around and, so, it?s not a surprise... Only, we aren?t taking much notice... We?ve got a job to do...? 

Gavaskar, who briefly stepped into Ajit Wadekar?s (cricket manager) shoes a decade ago in Sharjah, too has a job: Help eliminate the technical flaws of batsmen and make Team India tougher in the mind.

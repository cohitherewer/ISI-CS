 Cairns, Harris to join squad

Sydney: Chris Cairns and Chris Harris will join the New Zealand touring party for their limited-overs series with Australia after the selectors named a 14-man squad on Wednesday. 

The two one-day specialists have been included for the three-match Chappell-Hadlee series starting next month. 

New Zealand coach John Bracewell said there were no surprises in the squad. 

?This is a squad that has performed pretty well during the last 12 months. They have hardly lost a one-day match and there is a degree of confidence,? he said. 

?Cairns and Harris always add value to the squad on and off the field and they have been keeping cricket-fit by playing in the New Zealand Academy warm-up matches following their involvement in the one-day series against Bangladesh.? 

The Black Caps, thrashed by Australia in the first Test in Brisbane, tackle the world champions in the second and final Test in Adelaide starting on Friday before the one-day tournament begins on December 5.

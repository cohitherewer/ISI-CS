 Dhoni ready to bat in any position

Chittagong: Mahendra Singh Dhoni, all set to make his debut when India take on Bangladesh in the first one-day International on Thursday, is willing to bat in any position to suit the needs of the team. 

The 23-year-old will have some standards to maintain as he steps in for Dinesh Karthik who has done well behind the stumps in the longer version of the game. 

However, it is his ability with the bat that will be closely watched as the team looks to move beyond vice-captain Rahul Dravid in the double role as a wicketkeeper and still find the right balance in the shorter version of the game. 

What will then come handy to Dhoni is flexibility to bat at any position in the line-up since India?s opening pair is set. 

?For India A I have opened the innings and also batted at No. 3. But throughout my career, I have batted at seven-eight,? said Dhoni. ?I am open to bat at any position to suit the team?s needs. I can bat in the middle order. At times, the team may want me to go up as pinch-hitter, I have done that also,? said the player who was the cynosure of all eyes during India?s brief net session here. 

As he caught a few hits, batted and even bowled, he drew attention, more than Yuvraj Singh, not long ago the blue-eyed boy of Indian cricket. 

Adding to Dhoni?s charisma were the funky locks that bounced in the golden twilight as he ran in. 

Dhoni was brought up in Almora, Uttaranchal, but his parents hail from Uttar Pradesh. (PTI)

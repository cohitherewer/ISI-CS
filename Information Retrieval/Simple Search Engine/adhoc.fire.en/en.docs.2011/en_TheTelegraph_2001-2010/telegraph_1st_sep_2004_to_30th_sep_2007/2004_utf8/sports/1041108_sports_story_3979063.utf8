Calcutta: Top seed GM Aleksej Alexandrov of Belarus with an Elo rating of 2659 is the favourite in the International Open, which gets underway at Alekhine Chess Club, Gorky Sadan from Monday. 

Alexandrov, who arrived in the city on Sunday used to be a second of BrainGames champion Vladimir Kramnik. 

?He is well versed in the opening,? said city-based GM and national champion Surya Sekhar Ganguly adding, ?He is also a specialist in the Berlin defence. 

He helped Kramnik beat Kasparov with the Berlin defence in the Brain Games World Championship.? Another player to watch out for will be Nguyen Anh Dung who won a medal in the Olympiad, added Surya Sekhar. 

An in-form Surya Sekhar ? fresh from his outing with the Indian team in the Chess Olympiad where the men finished sixth ? who will spearhead the country?s challenge is non-committal about his own chances. 

?The Olympiad was tiring, but I have recovered and am looking forward to this meet on home turf,? the Grandmaster said. 

Second seed Ni Hua of China, a former world rapid boys champion is a sharp player and can prove to be a tough contender. 

Oleg Romanishin of Ukraine, at 52, is the oldest participant in the meet. 

He has won several international meets, notable among them being Beil Open in 1987, and Bad Godesberg in 1994. 

Other Indian GMs in fray are Sandipan Chanda, Abhijit Kunte, Dibyendu Barua and Tejas Bakre. 

While IM D.V. Prasad (with two GM norms under his belt) will be looking for his third and final GM norm, IM Lanka Ravi will be gunning for his second. 

Reefat Bin Sattar and Abdulla al-Rakib, both IM?s from Bangladesh have two GM norms, and will be aiming for their third and final norm. 

Amongst local hopefuls are IM Neelotpal Das, who has recently bagged the national rapid chess title and Saptarshi Roy, runners-up in the national B chess championship.

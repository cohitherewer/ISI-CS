 ICC not to allow intrusive ads

New Delhi: The International Cricket Council (ICC) is all for clean cricket viewing and wont allow its broadcasters to clutter the screen with advertisements as it happened during the recent Asia Cup meet in Sri Lanka. 

ICCs commercial manager Campbell Jamieson, here to invite sponsorship and broadcast rights for the inaugural Super Series, on Wednesday said the games governing body would not allow broadcasters to intrude on viewers through too much of on-screen appetisers. 

The Asia Cup telecast was a case in point. There was a teapot bobbing up and down on the screen and at one time the viewers could not see whether a catch was taken or not. The ICC World Cup in South Africa had nothing of this kind, Jamieson said at an informal interaction here. 

The Olympics too provided clean viewing. Our aim is similar. There would be the usual commercial breaks after every over but we are against crowding of the screen, he said, adding that care would be taken so as to ensure the interest of the broadcasters is not jeopardised. 

In a deviation from the set pattern, the ICC is also inviting bids for the title rights of the Super Series to be staged next year in Australia. 

We do not have title sponsors for the World Cup or for the Champions Trophy. But for the Super Series we would like to invite bids for the naming rights as well, Jamieson said. 

The Super Series, billed as crickets third major, comprises three one-dayers and a six-day Test match to be played between the top ODI/Test team of the world as on April 1, 2005 and a Rest of the World team to be selected by an elite panel.

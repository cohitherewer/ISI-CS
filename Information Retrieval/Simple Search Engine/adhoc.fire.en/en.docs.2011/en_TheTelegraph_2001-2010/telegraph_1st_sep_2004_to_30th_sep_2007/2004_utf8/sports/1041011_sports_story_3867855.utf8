Suzuka: Ferrari?s Michael Schumacher powered to an easy victory in the Japanese Grand Prix on Sunday for his 13th win of the season. 

The race took place in bright sunshine after a typhoon and torrential rains forced Saturday?s qualifying to be postponed until the morning of the race for the first time in Formula One history. 

Michael took it all in his stride, securing pole position before running away with his 83rd career win and sixth at Suzuka. 

The all-conquering German, who had already clinched an unprecedented seventh world title in August, finished 14 seconds ahead of younger brother Ralf?s Williams after slowing down at the end. 

?Qualifying pre-determined the race I think,? said Michael. ?We had to be flat-out until the pit-stops but we have dominated all year and I didn?t expect anything different here. We were superb.? 

Britain?s Jenson Button finished third ? his 10th podium of 2004 ? for BAR in their 100th race since joining Formula One in 1999. 

Japanese teammate Takuma Sato was fourth as BAR virtually secured second place in the constructors? standings ahead of Renault. 

BAR have 116 points to 100 for Renault with just the Brazilian Grand Prix remaining. 

Renault scored just four points, with Spaniard Fernando Alonso fifth and Canadian Jacques Villeneuve 10th and out of the points again in his second race for the team since he replaced Italian Jarno Trulli. 

France?s Olivier Panis, in a Toyota, ended his Formula One career with 14th place. 

Michael?s runaway victory gave constructors? champions Ferrari a record-equalling 15th win of the season with Brazilian Rubens Barrichello winning the last two races at Monza and Shanghai. 

Barrichello?s hopes of a hattrick ended when he collided with McLaren?s David Coulthard at the fastest part of the circuit, forcing both cars off the track. 

Earlier, Michael took pole position after clocking a lap of 1:33.542 to beat Ralf by just over half a second on a track still wet after Saturday?s qualifying was postponed after a powerful typhoon swept through Suzuka on Friday night and Saturday morning. 

Practice on Friday was severely affected by the weather as torrential rain lashed the Suzuka circuit causing several drivers to skid off the track. 

?The circumstances are very unusual and I think I was lucky to run second to last,? said Michael. ?Qualifying on the same day is rather awkward.? 

It was the 63rd pole of Michael?s career, two short of Brazilian Ayrton Senna?s Formula One record, and the first time this season that the two Schumachers have started together on the front row.

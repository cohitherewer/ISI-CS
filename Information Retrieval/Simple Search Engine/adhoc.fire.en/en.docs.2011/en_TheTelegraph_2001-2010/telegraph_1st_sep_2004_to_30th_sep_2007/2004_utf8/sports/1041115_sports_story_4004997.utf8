 Fleming still battling virus

Sydney: New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming said he was still suffering the effects of a virus and was not certain of playing in this week?s opening Test match against Australia in Brisbane. 

Fleming revealed on Sunday that he has been sleeping up to 20 hours a day after being laid low by the illness contracted during his team?s recent tour of Bangladesh. 

He arrived here on Saturday after resting up at home from the debilitating virus and said he would make a decision on his availability by Wednesday. 

But New Zealand?s highest-scoring Test batsman rated himself a ?pretty strong chance? of playing at the Gabba. 

?I will leave it pretty late, but I will give (coach) John (Bracewell) and the team pretty honest indications the entire way through,? he said.

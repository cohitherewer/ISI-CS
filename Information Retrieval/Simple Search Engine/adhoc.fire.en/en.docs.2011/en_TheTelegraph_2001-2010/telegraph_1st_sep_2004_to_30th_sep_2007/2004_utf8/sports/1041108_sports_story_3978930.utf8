Dhaka: Mathew Sinclair and Scott Styris hit half-centuries to set up New Zealand?s 83-run victory over Bangladesh on Sunday as the tourists wrapped up the three-match ODI series 3-0. 

Opener Sinclair top-scored with 66 while Styris made an impressive 51 as New Zealand posted a challenging 250 for seven after electing to bat in the day-night game. 

The tourists then restricted Bangladesh to 167 for seven led by left-arm spinner Daniel Vettori, who never allowed the Bangladeshi batsmen to get away as he finished with three for 25 off 10 overs. 

?It was a nice finish,? said New Zealand stand-in captain Vettori. ?It?s a good preparation for our tour to Australia.? 

A minor consolation for Bangladesh was Mohammed Rafique?s fine all-round performance. 

The left-arm spinner finished with a career-best haul of four for 63 to become Bangladesh?s leading wicket-taker in one-dayers, surpassing Khaled Mahmud?s 54 victims. He has so far grabbed 56 scalps. 

Rafique then played a cameo of 21 after being promoted as an opener. He smashed four boundaries, including two in a Kyle Mills over, before becoming one of the three leg-before victims. 

Khaled Mashud (40 not out) and Nafis Iqbal (40) were the other main contributors, but Bangladesh never got into their stride after losing the first three wickets for just 48 runs. 

New Zealand had boosted their chances with a steady batting performance despite Rafique?s impressive bowling effort. All-rounder Chris Cairns helped his team set a tough target with his big hitting in the closing overs, smashing three sixes and two fours. New Zealand plundered 99 in the last 10 overs. 

?It was a hard job for us after they scored nearly 100 in the last 10 overs. But they played better cricket,? said stand-in Bangladeshi skipper Mashud, who led in the absence of unfit Habibul Bashar. 

New Zealand survived a Rafique scare as Styris put on 86 for the fifth wicket with Craig McMillan (39). Styris became Rafique?s fourth victim, but not before pulling his team out of trouble with his 10th half-century. (AFP)

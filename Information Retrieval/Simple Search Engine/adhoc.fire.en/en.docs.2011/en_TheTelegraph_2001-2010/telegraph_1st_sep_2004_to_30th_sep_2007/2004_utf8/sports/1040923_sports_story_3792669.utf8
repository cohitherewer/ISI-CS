The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Ricky Ponting to miss Bangalore Test, at least

 - Injured Aussie captain flying to Sydney for ?expert medical consultation? on fractured left thumb 

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI 

 Ponting was in 'considerable pain' throughout the night

 Southampton: Even as Ravi Shastri wants a ?shake 

 up? in the Indian ranks ahead of the forthcoming home series, 

 Cricket Australia has announced that captain Ricky Ponting 

 will (at least) miss the first Test, in Bangalore from October 

 6. 

 Ponting injured his left thumb while fielding in Tuesday?s 

 Champions Trophy semi-final, versus England, and a scan 

 on Wednesday revealed a fracture. 

So, instead of travelling to Mumbai via Dubai, Ponting is now heading home for ?expert medical consultation.? Specifically, he?s going to reach Sydney on Friday. 

It?s expected that vice-captain Adam Gilchrist will be elevated to the captaincy ? not that he hasn?t led Australia before ? and a replacement named in a day or two. 

Very disappointed, Ponting said: ?I have faith in my teammates to do the job in my absence... I?ll do everything I can to get back as quickly as possible, but I?ve got to be guided by the experts... 

?I desperately want to be in India and, if everything goes according to plan, I?ll still be able to play some part in the series ? sooner, I hope, than later... The series means so much to us all and could be one of the biggest ever played...? 

Long-serving physio Errol Alcott had this to say: ?Ricky was in considerable pain throughout the night and wasn?t able to sleep well... We can?t make bold predictions about a return-date until he has seen a hand specialist back home.? 

Ponting had a poor Test series on the last tour of India, in 2000-01, but was the most prickly thorn when we visited Australia last season. 

 In fact, in a recent chat with 

 The Telegraph, former captain Greg Chappell had felt Ponting 

 may make the difference in the latest duel for the 

 Border-Gavaskar Trophy. 

 Owing to an unfortunate ?twist? in the script, that?s 

 in some doubt.

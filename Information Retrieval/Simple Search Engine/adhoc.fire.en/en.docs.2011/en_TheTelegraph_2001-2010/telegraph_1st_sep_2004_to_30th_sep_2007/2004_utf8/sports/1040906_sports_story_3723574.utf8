The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Srinath tips helped Paul

 - Medium-pacer impresses on maiden tour 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Shib Shankar Paul 

Calcutta: Bengals No. 1 medium-pacer Shib Shankar Paul (as adjudged by the Cricket Association of Bengal at their annual awards function) has, of late, emerged the best in the India A side. In the recently concluded tour of Zimbabwe and Kenya he finished with a haul of 30 wickets in 11 matches. 

The prospect of Paul playing for the country is definitely bright, but Paul is keeping a cool head. I dont think that way, Im just concentrating on my job and the rest will fall into place, Paul told The Telegraph, on reaching the city after a 58-day tour. 

I got in touch with my favourite bowler Jawagal Srinath in Nairobi, where he provided few tips which has really changed me a lot, he said. 

Srinath has reportedly told the Bengal pacer to concentrate on the slower deliveries. He advised me to concentrate on the delivery at nets and try it more often in a match as this is the best weapon in the limited-overs cricket these days, Paul said. 

Paul was introduced to Srinath at Team Indias conditioning camp in Bangalore. Maharajda (Sourav Ganguly) introduced me to him and from then he has been giving me valuable tips which, with the passage of time, has transformed me into a better bowler, Paul said. 

Paul said he received constant encouragement from coach Sandeep Patil and other senior members on his maiden overseas tour. Sandeepbhai, Sairaj (Bahutule), Rohan (Gavaskar) and all other players backed me well throughout the series. 

Paul took 14 wickets in nine tri-series matches in Kenya, also involving Pakistan A. He is now focussed on the new season. 

Paul hasnt decided about his local club yet. I havent made up my mind to play for any club. However, sources revealed that he has good offers from both East Bengal and Mohun Bagan.

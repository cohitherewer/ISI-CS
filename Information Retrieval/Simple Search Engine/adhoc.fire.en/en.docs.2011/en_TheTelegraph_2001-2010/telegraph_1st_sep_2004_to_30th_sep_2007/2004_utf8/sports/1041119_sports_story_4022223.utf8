Athens: Disgraced Greek sprinters Costas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou have been charged with missing a drugs test on the eve of the Athens Olympics and faking a mystery motorcycle accident. 

Thursday?s charges against the Olympic medallists, their coach and doctors who treated them after the alleged crash end a three-month investigation into the incidents that cast a shadow over the Games just hours before the opening ceremony. 

Prosecutors Spyros Mouzakitis and Athina Theodoropoulou said the athletes had repeatedly obstructed doping officials after they failed to appear at scheduled tests in Chicago and Tel Aviv shortly before the Games, and then again in Athens on August 12. 

Kenteris, who was chosen as the ceremony?s final torch-bearer before being replaced after the crash, and Thanou are unlikely to be jailed if found guilty, a judicial source said. 

Kenteris was a shock winner of the men?s 200m gold in Sydney four years ago and Thanou won the women?s 100m silver. Prosecutors also charged the athletes? former coach Christos Tzekos with obstructing tests and owning, storing and trading banned substances found at his nutrition supplements company. 

A witness to the midnight crash of a motorcycle Kenteris said he was driving with Thanou as his passenger has been charged with perjury. 

?They have now been officially charged and if found guilty they could face fines or short jail sentences which can either be paid off or suspended,? a judicial source said.

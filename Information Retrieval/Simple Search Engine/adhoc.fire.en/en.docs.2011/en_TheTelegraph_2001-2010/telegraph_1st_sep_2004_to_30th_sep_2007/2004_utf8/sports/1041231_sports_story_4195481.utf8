 Fernando Morientes 

London: Real Madrid striker Fernando Morientes, who helped Monaco to the Champions League final last season, has said he will be joining premiership side Liverpool. 

Although he returned to the Bernabeu this season, the Spain international is down the pecking order behind Ronaldo, Raul and former Liverpool striker Michael Owen. 

Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez is desperate to bolster his attack after summer signing Djibril Cisse broke a leg earlier this season. 

?Yes, I am going to England ? I have decided,? Morientes was quote as saying on Liverpool?s website, www.liverpoolfc.tv. ?I will go to Liverpool. The main reason is the coach Rafa Benitez. He is Spanish and knows me perfectly, which is worth a lot for a professional. 

?We have asked Real Madrid to make a fast solution and I don?t want to expand any further.? (AFP)

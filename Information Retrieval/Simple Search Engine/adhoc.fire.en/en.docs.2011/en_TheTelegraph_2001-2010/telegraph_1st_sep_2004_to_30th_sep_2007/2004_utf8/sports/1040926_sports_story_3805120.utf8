 AIFF asks EB to show cause

 A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) has issued a showcause notice to East Bengal club for refusing to release players for the national camp. 

East Bengal declined to release their national players before the World Cup qualifying home match against Japan while the camp was on in SAI, Calcutta. East Bengal players were undergoing training under their British physio Peter McNight and hence the players joined the camp late. 

Meanwhile, the AIFF has reportedly demanded Rs 14,500 from East Bengal or Mohun Bagan club for issuing the clearance of Habibur Rehman Mondal. 

A letter to this effect has reached the Indian Football Association (IFA) on Saturday. It is learnt that the AIFF had demanded the money owing to the fact that it had to bear the expenses of fighting the case after Mohun Bagan made them a party in the Habibur issue. AIFF had originally issued the clearance in favour of East Bengal, but Bagan went to court citing that Habibur had taken money beforehand from the club. They made AIFF a party to the case. 

Later, Bagan withdrew the case and issued a no objection certificate wherein Habibur became a free player.

 Limited exposure Kenya?s bane

 - Their one-day status has consigned the country to limbo 

 DEREK PRINGLE 

The International Cricket Council?s drive to spread cricket around the globe has not always been accompanied by proper support. Money, which the current Champions Trophy does much to provide, is handy for funding development, but playing regular cricket against decent opponents is just as important, as Kenya are finding to their cost. 

Despite being awarded one-day status by the ICC in 2002, Kenya have barely played a competitive match since reaching the semi-finals of the last World Cup, 18 months ago. 

While few would disagree that good fortune eased their passage then, they also beat three Test teams, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and a full strength Zimbabwe side, before being stopped by India in the semis. Last Saturday, India beat them again, this time in the Champions Trophy, a not unexpected result, except that Kenya?s cricket showed signs of stasis rather than improvement. Given that most fledgling teams improve when regularly exposed to top-level competition, their isolation is obvious and regrettable. 

The principle reason for their inertia is a lack of cricket. Instead of their giant-killing spree in the World Cup making them the ideal third side for triangular tournaments around the world, their only outings have been the Cherry Blossom Cup in Sharjah 17 months ago and the Red Stripe Bowl, the domestic one-day competition in the West Indies. Considering the current state of West Indies cricket, playing the various islands will not prepare you for India, Australia or England. 

The problem is their one-day status, which if intended as encouragement by ICC, has actually consigned them to limbo. The ICC?s Future Tours Programme is based on Test series, to which one-day series are then attached. In an already crowded calendar, Kenya have little chance of playing in a bilateral set of one-day games without first becoming a Test playing country. 

Their board, the Kenya Cricket Association, is another impediment. The KCA really need to lobby full member countries and forge stronger links with them, though allegations of corruption within has made many wary of entering into deals where substantial sums of money are generated. Outside official ICC tournaments like the World Cup and the Champions Trophy, there is no easy remedy to Kenya?s paucity of competitive cricket. The Daily Telegraph

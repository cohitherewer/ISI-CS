The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Sachin scan in London today

 - Fingers crossed on star batsman being fit for the series against Australia 

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI 

London: Star batsman Sachin Tendulkar, ruled 

out of the Champions Trophy as well, will undergo a scan on his left elbow on 

Tuesday. Thats going to be done here itself and its likely that he will remain 

in London for the next couple of weeks. 

We dont suspect anything nasty, but Sachin himself 

wishes to rule out the possibility of something more than a tennis elbow, Team 

India physio Andrew Leipus told The Telegraph on Monday evening. 

He added: Sachin is in excellent hands but, then, one can never put a date on somebodys complete recovery from a tennis elbow problem... However, we expect him to be fit for the four-Test series against Australia, which begins in exactly a month (in Bangalore). 

Sachin, incidentally, is being joined by his immediate family. In any case, his mother-in-laws roots are in England. 

While Leipus wasnt keen on identifying the doctor who is treating Sachin, one learns he is Australian Chris Bradshaw, a leading sports medicine specialist. 

Sachin, it may be recalled, felt some pain while practising in Mumbai in the build-up to the tri-series in Holland. That aggravated on arrival in Amsterdam and, well, he hasnt held a bat for over two weeks. 

The difference his absence has made, to Team India, 

has been all too evident.

 David Hookes used ?forceful? language

Melbourne: Former Australian Test cricketer and radio host David Hookes threatened to criticise a hotel on air for throwing him out, minutes before the fight that led to his death, a court heard on Tuesday. 

South Australian cricket coach Wayne Phillips told a committal hearing for a bouncer charged with manslaughter that Hookes used ?forceful? language when told by a bouncer that his group was being too loud. 

Hookes, 48, died on January 19 after he hit his head on the ground during a fight outside the Beaconsfield Hotel in the Melbourne suburb of St Kilda. 

Bouncer Zdavko Micevic, 22, is charged with manslaughter and assault over the incident. 

Defence lawyer Terry Forrest asked Phillips whether Hookes told a bouncer that he was a radio personality and threatened the business would ?cop it? the next day. 

?I assume that was the tack he was taking,? Phillips told the Melbourne Magistrates? Court. 

Hookes was then grabbed forcefully by two or three bouncers and ejected from the bar, Phillips said. 

?I thought he was held rather forcefully,? Phillips said. 

Phillips denied that he or other cricketers were involved in a struggle between the bouncers and Hookes. ?I didn?t see that and I certainly didn?t get involved in any grapple with security staff,? Phillips said. 

The cricketers had gone to the hotel after an inter-state match.

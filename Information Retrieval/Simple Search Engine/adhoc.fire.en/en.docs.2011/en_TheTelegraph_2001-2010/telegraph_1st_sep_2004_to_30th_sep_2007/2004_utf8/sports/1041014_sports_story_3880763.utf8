 Kozhikode: All India Chess Federation (AICF) secretary P.T. Ummer Koya has been nominated as chairman of the appeals committee for the Chess Olympiad beginning in Spain from Thursday. Koya, who is serving as Fide vice-president since 1996, is the first Asian to be selected to the post, according to a release issued by the AICF here.

 India will be represented by a six-member men?s team, led by Grandmaster Viswanathan Anand, and a four-member women?s team, led by GM Koneru Humpy. Koya had also represented many international competitions in various capacities, including president of the Commonwealth Chess Association and member of the world women?s chess championship appeals committee, the release said. 

 Islamabad: Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf has announced a cash prize of Rs 2 million to Sohail Abbas for becoming the highest goalscorer in the world. Musharraf, who also congratulated the Pakistan hockey team for registering a 4-2 series win over India, would hand over the cash prize to Sohail at a formal ceremony expected to be held soon.

 Sohail achieved the feat in the seventh Test against India in Amritsar last week when he scored with his favourite shot ? the drag flick ? to surge ahead of Dutchman Paul Litjens? record 267 goals.

 Appreciating Sohail?s performance, Musharraf said his ?scintillating form has been a major factor in the team?s success? in recent times. 

 London: Marathon world record holder Paula Radcliffe, undaunted by her disastrous showing at the Athens Olympics, hopes to run in Beijing in four years and possibly even at the 2012 Games. Radcliffe, 30, pulled out of the marathon and 10,000m in Athens in August and was subjected to a storm of criticism in the media back home in Britain.

 ?It was never a case of if I get what I want in Athens I will back off,? Radcliffe was quoted as saying in Wednesday?s Daily Mail newspaper.

 London: Mika Hakkinen, the 1998 and 1999 Formula One world champion, tested a Mercedes DTM touring car on Wednesday amid speculation that he could make a racing comeback in the German series. However Mercedes motorsport director Norbert Haug suggested such talk remained premature.

 ?He has lost nothing from his speed but there is no further agreement,? he said. ?Mika has been following the DTM for a long time and it was always a point of talk during our cooperation,? said Haug of the 35-year-old Finn, who won his Formula One crowns with Mercedes-powered McLaren. Hakkinen, who retired in 2001, was also linked to a possible Formula One comeback earlier in the year.

 ?This season Mika became a fan of the DTM, watching it on TV, and we offered him the opportunity to test the current C class,? said Haug.

 Valencia win 5-1

Madrid: Italy forwards Bernardo Corradi and Marco di Vaio each scored as Valencia hammered Deportivo la Coruna 5-1 and rose to the top of the Spanish league. 

Midfielders Vicente Rodriguez, Francisco Perez Rufete and Ruben Baraja also scored for the reigning champions who took a shock 4-0 lead by halftime at Deportivo?s Riazor Stadium Wednesday. 

In other fourth-round games, Espanyol and Atletico Madrid?s hopes of moving into first place were dashed when they lost to newly promoted teams. Espanyol went down at Getafe 0-1, while Atletico fell at Levante 0-1. 

Elsewhere it was Real Betis 2 Athletic Bilbao 1; Real Sociedad 0 Racing Santander 1; Malaga 4 Numancia 1; Villarreal 0 Sevilla 0; and Albacete 0 Mallorca 0. 

Valencia have 10 points from four games, one more than Real Madrid who beat Osasuna 1-0 Tuesday. FC Barcelona have seven and are above Zaragoza, Espanyol, Atletico, Osasuna, Malaga, Sevilla and Levante on goal difference. 

Valencia ripped Deportivo apart in the first half and piled more problems on coach Javier Irureta, whose side has been well below its best so far this season. 

Messina upset Milan 

In Serie A, newly-promoted Messina upset defending champions AC Milan 2-1 at San Siro, while Juventus continued their perfect start to the season and remained alone atop the standings. 

Juventus got goals in a 3-0 win over Sampdoria from their three world-class strikers ? Alessandro del Piero, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and David Trezeguet. 

Lazio, who beat lowly Brescia 2-0, and Messina share second with seven points each. Newly promoted Cagliari come next with six points after beating Siena 2-0 in Sardinia. 

Six clubs have five points, including Inter Milan, which defeated Atalanta 3-2 on Adriano?s 87th-minute strike, the Brazilian?s eighth goal in six official matches so far this season. (AP)

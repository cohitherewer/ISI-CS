 London: Ferrari?s Michael Schumacher, already the most successful driver in Formula One history, can become a champion of champions on Saturday.

 The 35-year-old German, winner of an unprecedented seven Formula One titles, takes on world rally champion Sebastien Loeb and the best that America can offer in a charity ?Race of Champions? at the Stade de France in Paris.

 On Sunday Schumacher will take to the streets of Paris to support a new brain and spinal research centre. He will drive his Ferrari down the Champs Elysees in a parade alongside Loeb, Ferrari manager Jean Todt, film director Luc Besson and former Ferrari driver Patrick Tambay. The event is in support of France?s new brain and spinal research centre, the ICM institute. 

 Muzaffarpur: A sterling performance by skipper Sanjeev Kumar powered India to a 46-34 win over Bangladesh in the last tie here Thursday to record a 6-0 sweep over their opponents in the six-Test kabaddi series.

 India dominated Bangladesh throughout the match both in raiding and catching skills at the Khudiram Bose Stadium. Sanjeev Kumar was adjudged Man of the Match. 

 Paris: France goalkeeper Fabien Barthez will be out of action for at least two weeks after undergoing skin surgery, his club Olympique Marseille said on Friday.

 ?I spoke to Fabien and the operation went well,? Marseille?s new coach Philippe Troussier said in a statement on the club?s website. ?His recovery will need time but we hope he will be back soon.?

 Troussier did not reveal the nature of the operation that took place on Thursday.

 Provincial newspaper La Provence reported on Monday that Barthez?s operation was to remove a non-malignant skin tumour.

 Paris: Zinedine Zidane says Spain is ?not a racist country? despite the abuse hurled at black players during domestic and international matches last month.

 ?I really don?t have the feeling that Spain is a racist country,? the Real Madrid playmaker was quoted as saying by l?Equipe on Friday.

 ?I think that a big majority of Spaniards are rather welcoming, rather tolerant. It would be stupid to say that Spain is a racist country.? 

 Buenos Aires: Argentina forward Carlos Tevez has completed his $18 million move from Boca Juniors to Brazilian side Corinthians, Boca president Mauricio Macri said. The surprise transfer, made possible after Corinthians signed a multi-million dollar partnership deal with a London-based group of investors last week, is a record for a Brazilian club. 

 London: Arsenal may consider signing French midfielder Emmanuel Petit as a stop-gap solution to their midfield injury problems, manager Arsene Wenger says.

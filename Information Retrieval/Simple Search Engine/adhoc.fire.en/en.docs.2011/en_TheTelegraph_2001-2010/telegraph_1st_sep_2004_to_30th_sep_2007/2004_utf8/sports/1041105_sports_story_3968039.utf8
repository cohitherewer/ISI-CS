Dhaka: Bangladesh skipper Habibul Bashar has just one target for his batsmen in Friday?s second one day International against New Zealand ? bat for the full 50 overs. 

?Our target is to play all the 50 overs of the match,? Basar said on Thursday after a practice session. 

The one-dayer will be played at Dhaka?s Bangabandu National Stadium. 

In Tuesday?s opening match in Chittagong, Bangladesh dismissed New Zealand for 224 with four balls to spare. 

But Bangladesh?s batsmen did not far so well as the home side was dismissed for 86 in just 31.5 overs. 

Bangladesh lost four top-order batsmen within the first 15 overs for just 27 runs. It was the 11th consecutive match in which Bangladesh lost four top-order batsmen within the first 15 overs with scores less than 30. 

?We want to perform well in the next two matches. My message to the boys is ?stay at the crease as long as possible and make runs?,? Bashar said. 

New Zealand, led by acting skipper Daniel Vettori, returned from Chittagong late Wednesday. Vettori took charge of New Zealand for regular skipper Stephen Fleming, who returned home after leading last month?s 2-0 Test series sweep against the hosts.

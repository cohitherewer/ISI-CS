 ?Terror? set to strike 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: With trainers Vijay Singh having only a casual interest in Wednesday?s race card, his fellow-professionals Daniel David and Errol Bhungard may have a field day. Even trainer Bharath Singh?s substantial representation in the day?s six events may not cause much worry to the Daniel-Errol combine might. Bharath?s runners on the cards have not been living up to expectations in recent weeks.

 Daniel?s Tagged For Terror gets the first call in the afternoon?s main event, the 1,200m Mica Empress Cup for horses in Class II. The five-year-old ran a poor race in the lower class, thanks to his heavy impost of 62-kg. Earlier in the season he had won in the present class with 47-kg on his back. With 53-1/2 kg to shoulder and Imran Chisty to guide, the Cristofori-Cryptic son may not disappoint his backers.

 Daniel?s Autumn Fantasy and Amazing Blaze are also expected to start as favourites in their respective events and deliver the goods too. Errol, on the other hand, banks heavily upon Splendid Quest in the 1,200m Young Lady Handicap as the six-year-old mare is back to her favourite trip.

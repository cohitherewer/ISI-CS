As Subrata Pal?s ?hand? in the death of Dempo?s Brazilian striker Cristiano Junior came under the scanner, Mohun Bagan claim they had disciplined the goalkeeper after the Durand Cup final. 

Acting on an All India Football Federation (AIFF) move, the club docked him 15 days? salary and also warned him to play within the rules. 

Commenting on Pal?s past records of violent conduct on the field, AIFF secretary Alberto Colaco said he had asked Mohun Bagan officials to ?take action against their goalkeeper? after watching the Durand final on TV on November 10. 

He also said that the club and the player had been given 15 days to reply but there no communication has been received till now. 

Colaco also maintained that despite Pal?s ?questionable behaviour? in the Durand Cup final, ?there was no reason to ban him? in the Federation Cup. 

?How can I? There was no referee?s report on his behaviour, nor was any card issued against him. I just acted on this as the AIFF secretary and expected Mohun Bagan to take action,? Colaco said. 

When contacted Mohun Bagan assistant secretary Balaram Chowdhury admitted on Monday that Pal was docked 15 days salary as well as given a warning . 

?Having been intimated by the federation to check on Subrata?s behaviour during the Durand Cup final, we promptly acted and subsequently informed the federation of our decision,? Chowdhury clarified. 

The Mohun Bagan official further said that ?action against Subrata was taken because he was arguing with the referee (P.K. Bose).? 

According to Chowdhury, Pal?s conduct in the Durand Cup final had nothing to do with the Federation Cup. 

?Junior?s death is a tragedy, but we are behind our goalkeeper. It?s just an accident and he didn?t do anything intentionally,? the official remarked. Colaco, meanwhile, has sought a report on the match and video recording. He would brief the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) about the match and Junior?s death. 

Colaco also hoped that Junior?s death should not lead to a backlash against Pal, when Mohun Bagan take on Dempo in the forthcoming National Football League (NFL) staring on January 9. 

?I?m yet to get the post-mortem report, but this blame game has to stop. Let there be a detailed investigation, let Fifa also conduct an independent probe into it,? Colaco said.

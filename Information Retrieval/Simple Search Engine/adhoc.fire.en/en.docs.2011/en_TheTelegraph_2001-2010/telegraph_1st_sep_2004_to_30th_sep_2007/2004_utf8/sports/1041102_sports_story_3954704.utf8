 McGrath flu, Lee cut ?not serious?

Mumbai: While regular Australian captain Ricky Ponting gets ready to take over the reins from Adam Gilchrist, and as the visitors look forward to a 3-0 victory from the fourth and final Test starting here on Wednesday, news came in Monday of speedster Brett Lee having cut himself above the left eye and of Glenn McGrath catching the flu. 

Lee suffered a cut while boxing with teammate Justin Langer in a gymnasium. He got a nasty blow when Langer, wearing a helmet, head-butted into the fast bowler. 

The Aussie medical team was kept busy as McGrath was also down, suffering from a bout of flu. 

Australian team?s media manager Jonathan Rose said the matters were not serious and the duo would be available for selection. 

Meanwhile, Ponting warned his team will settle for nothing less than a 3-0 verdict in the series. ?We have been at the receiving end here a few times, and I think the guys would be keen to finish off the series the way we started,? Ponting said on Monday. 

Ponting missed the first three Tests against India due to a thumb injury. 

?I don?t think our performance will slip,? said Ponting, who will replace the injured Darren Lehmann. 

Lehmann, who tore a right hamstring in the third Test in Nagpur is set to leave for Australia before the start of the final Test. 

Australia have already clinched the four-match series taking an unassailable 2-0 lead with a comprehensive 342-run victory in Nagpur, following their 217-run victory in the first Test in Bangalore with the Chennai Test being drawn. 

Ponting was pleased with the way his team adjusted to the varying conditions at different venues. 

?This is probably the toughest series because the conditions vary from one venue to another. 

?In Bangalore, it was a turning track, in Chennai it was very humid while in Nagpur it was quite pleasant, and to adjust to these conditions quickly is pretty tough.? 

The Aussie captain was all praise for speedsters Glenn McGrath, Jason Gillespie and Michael Kasprowicz, as well as Adam Gilchrist, who led the side in his absence. 

Hinting that Lee might play in the Mumbai Test, regular captain said, ?He (Lee) has not played in any of the Tests on this tour and is likely to do so in the last Test here.?

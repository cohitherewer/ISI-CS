The Telegraph - Calcutta

 ?In my book any captain who accepts challenges head-on, gets top marks?

 - A Telegraph exclusive - World Cup-winning captain Imran Khan, now a politician, 

speaks about leadership 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: Imran Khan retired a dozen years ago, but is still saluted as having been an outstanding captain (and, of course, allrounder). Now a Member of the National Assembly, Imran spoke to The Telegraph (from Hong Kong) exclusively on captaincy and leadership. Incidentally, the 1992 World Cup-winning captain heads the eight-year-old Tehrik-e-Insaaf party. 

The following are excerpts 

On captaincy 

Captaining a cricket team, specially, is different from leading in other sport? A captain has both a bigger role and more pressure? On occasions, decisions have to be made on every ball and, it may happen, one could cost the match? No matter how well prepared a captain is ? perhaps with significant inputs from the coach ? certain decisions simply have to be taken on the spur of the moment? That?s when a captain?s skills are on test. 

On the impact a captain can have 

Believe me, leadership alone may inspire a weak team to knock off a much stronger one? Bold moves? The captain himself leading from the front? A number of factors can come into play? Probably more than any other sport, cricket allows a captain to lead from the front? The range of expression, potentially, is huge. 

On the challenges he faced as captain 

(Laughs) I had one problem which wasn?t faced by captains elsewhere: Because of the poor quality of domestic cricket, it was difficult judging somebody wholly on how he did in domestic matches. So, I had to back players only on my judgement? Rely on my instinct? It was tough. 

On his style of captaincy 

Look, no captain knows everything? I tapped Javed Miandad, Mudassar Nazar, Abdul Qadir? Later, Rameez Raja and Wasim Akram? Was I a democrat? Yes? I encouraged players to participate in team meetings and offer suggestions. Eventually, every decision was mine, but I listened to others. I recall bringing Wasim back in the middle stages of the 1992 World Cup when, in fact, my teammates wanted me to hold him till the end? As it turned out, that clicked? It?s important to involve the team, or else some may feel they don?t have any role in what essentially is a common objective. 

On respect 

Has to be commanded, not demanded? And, once respect is there, discipline too will be as it ought to be. 

On whether he was an instinctive captain 

Some moves were definitely instinctive, others calculated? It?s not that I didn?t plan? Actually, a lot of planning went into my captaincy? 

On the presence of temperamental characters in the dressing room 

But, then, part of any captain?s job is to ensure egos don?t get bruised? That?s man management? It helped, I think, that I had the players? respect. 

On his role model captain 

Ian Chappell? He led from the front, getting runs when Australia needed them, and wasn?t afraid to take risks? Ian fought hard and gave that hundred per cent each time he took the field? It?s because he gave it all that his players respected him. Also, he didn?t shy away from big decisions. 

On whether he admired a contemporary captain 

Martin Crowe? He was superb in the 1992 World Cup? Innovative? Courageous? (After a pause) Sunil Gavaskar, I felt, was also good and Allan Border got better after I retired. 

On the captains who have impressed him after his retirement 

Steve Waugh, certainly? A terrific competitor with plenty of guts? He deserves much of the credit for moulding Australia into such a fine team? Then, I quite admire New Zealand?s Stephen Fleming? He loves leading from the front and, in my book any captain who accepts challenges head-on, gets top marks. 

On Sourav Ganguly 

I really haven?t seen much of him, but he did captain well in Pakistan? I do know Rahul Dravid was leading in the Multan Test but, when it came to declaring with Sachin Tendulkar on 194, I got the impression that bold decision was collectively taken? It certainly made a strong statement: That the team was above everything else. 

On Inzamam-ul Haq 

He?s learning? His problem is that he?s the insular type? As captain, though, he is getting better and captaincy hasn?t affected his batting. 

On the one lesson learnt as captain which is coming in handy now too 

(Laughs again) A political party also has the element of man management? Neither players nor party workers are employees and, because of the relationship, their handling has to be similar. Bottomline is that respect has to be earned. 

On what separates a good captain/leader from an ordinary one 

The ability to take big decisions and carry the team/people along? For me, that?s the hallmark of an outstanding leader/captain? The leadership ? be it on the field or in the political arena ? must have guts. 

On the one politician he admires 

Nelson Mandela? There?s much to learn from his life? A true statesman should have a vision; Mandela had one. 

Finally, his message to aspiring captains 

Where I?m concerned, you must not aspire to be the captain? Shouldn?t have ambitions whereby the captaincy becomes everything? If that is so, you?re bound to compromise. Once compromising begins, then? Remember, I quit the captaincy twice on my own terms? Similarly, there?s no point just aspiring to be Prime Minister and, in trying to become one, compromising all along the way? Any position must only be seen as an opportunity to do better and not an end in itself.

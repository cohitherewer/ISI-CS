 Miller was a one-off: Benaud

 Steve feels Miller was one of Australias 

best 

Melbourne: Australia?s most respected cricket commentator Richie Benaud led tributes to one of the nation?s most loved sports heroes Keith Miller, who died on Monday aged 84. 

Miller, who took 170 wickets and scored 2,958 runs in 55 Tests, would have cast an even bigger shadow on Australia?s sporting landscape had he played during the age of television, Benaud said on Tuesday. 

?No-one is even close to him in the modern era. Miller was a one-off. There was a golden aura about him,? Benaud said. ?He?s as much loved in England as was the case in Australia. In England they had television, whereas television didn?t start here until 1956 so we lost Miller because he retired in that year. To have Miller on television would have been absolutely outstanding. Miller was sensational. Around the world, there will be a real sadness that Keith has gone.? 

Former Test captain Steve Waugh said: ?He was one of our great allrounders, someone who could open the bowling and bat at No. 3 .? 

In Sydney, Australian captain Ricky Ponting said: ?I was very saddened to hear about the passing of Keith Miller, who is undoubtedly one of the greatest Australian cricketers of all time. The impact he had on Australian cricket ? and the broader community ? was enormous, and has certainly been evident with the number of tributes being paid to him.? 

?It disappoints me greatly to say that I never had the opportunity to meet him, as it would have been a privilege to sit down with him and hear stories about his life as an Australian cricketer,? Ponting said. ?Australian cricket has lost one of its greats, but I am sure his memory and the impact he had on our great game will last forever.? 

In Chennai, the touring Australian also said the allrounder will be remembered as one of the game?s all time greats. 

?Like Sir Don Bradman, Keith Miller will be remembered as one of the greats. I would have loved the opportunity to watch him play. The day I met him will remain for ever as a career highlight,? a condolence message from captain Adam Gilchrist on behalf of the team said on Tuesday. ?He will be sadly missed. Our hearts go out to his family.?

 Shoaib hits out at too much cricket

 - Pak quick feels standard of wickets is responsible for slowing down express bowlers 

 Shoaib Akhtar 

Perth: Pakistan pace spearhead Shoaib Akhtar feels that if something is not done about the packed playing schedule and the standard of wickets around the world, express pacemen will become extinct. 

Shoaib, presently in Australia preparing for a three-Test series starting December 16, said the growing number of injuries among top fast bowlers is proof that scheduling and conditions are taking a toll. ?How many genuine fast bowlers are playing Test cricket right now? not many,? Akhtar was quoted saying in The Australian newspaper. 

England?s Steve Harmison and Pakistan?s Mohammed Sami are about the only two who regularly played Test cricket in 2004, he said. 

?Earlier, there used to be at least nine or 10 fast bowlers around the globe who terrorised batsmen,? he said. ?Getting runs in Test cricket has never been easy, but now it is comparatively easier.? 

Akhtar said top cricketers are sometimes playing up to 12 Test matches and dozens of limited overs internationals each year and tours are getting arduous. 

?We have two-and-a-half months here, then after 10 days we are going to India for two months for two Tests and five one-dayers. 

?Then 10 days after that, we are off to the Caribbean. 

?No matter how tough you are, even if you are an iron-man, you are still going to bend it. Even a Ferrari sometimes needs to stop after two laps for a workshop.? 

Cricket administrators ?don?t realise they are finishing off fast bowlers,? added Akhtar, who has been besieged by injuries and scrutiny over his bowling action. 

Australian Brett Lee, who bowled the second-fastest delivery of all time, hasn?t been able to force his way back into the Australian Test line-up since returning from a long absence following surgery. 

A showdown between Lee and Akhtar on a fast pitch in Perth could be one of the highlights of the upcoming series, although Lee isn?t sure of getting a recall for the Australians unless one of the other fast bowlers is injured. 

New Zealand lost 0-2 in the Tests to Australia in the injury-enforced absence of pace spearhead Shane Bond and other top-line fast bowlers.The Pakistan speedster said rules limiting short-pitch bowling and wickets that favour batsmen are also blunting the influence of fast bowlers. 

Cricket administrators ?want to put up a show for people, but people enjoy fast bowling,? Akhtar remarked. ?It is one of the charms of cricket and they are slowing it down.? 

Meanwhile, Inzamam-ul Haq said hed likely rest Shoaib and Mohammed Sami for Tuesdays limited-overs match against an Australian Chairmans XI as Pakistan continues to ease its pace bowlers into the tour. 

Shoaib, the fastest bowler in cricket, bowled only 10 overs in the tour-opening loss to a second-string West Australian team on the weekend and Sami bowled 16 overs. 

The only remaining tune-up before the three-Test series starts December 16 is a four-day encounter against Western Australia starting Thursday. Shoaib quot;is not playing (against the Chairmans XI). He will play the four-day game, quot; Inzamam said. (AP)

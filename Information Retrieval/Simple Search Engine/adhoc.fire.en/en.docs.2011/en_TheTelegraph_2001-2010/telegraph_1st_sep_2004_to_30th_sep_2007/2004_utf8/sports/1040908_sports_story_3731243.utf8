The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Indian coaches turn students

 A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: If there is an international match around, can our football fraternity be far behind in eating, drinking and enjoying it? 

As Japan, under Zico, entered Salt Lake Stadium to sweat it out on the eve of their match against India, the likes of Amal Dutta, Subrata Bhattacharya and Mridul Banerjee turned attentive students, observing their practice. 

Subrata had a piece of advice for Debjit Ghosh. We should keep the ball close to each other, try to pass it around as long as possible. Even taking into consideration the high-profile opponents, we may win the match, only if plans are executed perfectly on the field, opined the Mohun Bagan coach. 

Meanwhile, about 5,000 Japanese fans, coming from all corners of India, thronged the stadium while the team was practising. 

The IFA believes the 120,000-capacity stadium will be packed to the brim on Wednesday as demand for tickets reached fever-pitch. 

In another move, the IFA has issued special identity cards for personalities from the tinsel town and some of them will add more glamour to the stadium during the match.

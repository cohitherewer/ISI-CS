 Inzamam plans Id gift for nation

 Inzamam 

Lahore: Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq has been warming up for the one-day clash with India by taking part in tableeghi or preaching tours of Sialkot and other parts of Punjab. 

Inzamam, who reported for a day?s training session in Lahore on Tuesday ahead of the team?s departure for Calcutta on Wednesday for Saturday?s match, has been taking part in religious congregations and also in tableeghi tours with other Pakistan players and religious scholars. 

?We have won all three previous matches against India and (coach Bob) Woolmer has made a difference in our overall showing,? Inzamam said. He also praised the players for executing the coach?s plans. 

Since Woolmer took over in June, Pakistan have beaten India by 59 runs in an Asia Cup match in Sri Lanka in July. This was followed by a 66-run win in Amstelveen in August and a three-wicket victory in the ICC Champions Trophy in England in September. 

?Since losing to India on home grounds we have shown improvement but we still haven?t achieved the desired results,? said Inzamam, one of only four players in the line-up to have toured India in 1999. 

?Wins in the last three matches have raised our confidence but a one-day match between India and Pakistan is always a new challenge for both the teams,? Inzamam said. 

?When you play before a crowd of over 100,000 at Eden Gardens, it?s real tough for the touring team. But we will do our best to give an Id gift to the nation by winning the match,? he said. According to a report in The News, Inzamam went to Sialkot accompanied by former players Saeed Anwar and Mushtaq Ahmed and others following the conclusion of the engagements with Sri Lanka at home. 

?One can play cricket and also take part in congregations and tableeghi tours. The advantage is that when people see prominent cricketers, who are thought to enjoy lavish lifestyles, taking religion so seriously, it does leave a positive impression on their minds,? Anwar said. 

He said Inzamam, Mushtaq and Saqlain have been very enthusiastic about such tours and vocal about how important religion has been for them as human beings and cricketers. 

?When Saqlain came down recently to Pakistan from England, he also took part in religious congregations and is doing a lot of good work in England among the Muslim community,? Anwar was quoted as saying by the daily. 

In the last three years, a number of Pakistan players have taken to religion in a big way and have been taking active part in congregations and tableeghi tours. 

Anwar was the first prominent national player to grow a beard and turn to religion after the tragic death of his daughter in 2001. He was later followed by others like Mushtaq, Saqlain, Inzamam, Salim Malik and Shahid Afridi.

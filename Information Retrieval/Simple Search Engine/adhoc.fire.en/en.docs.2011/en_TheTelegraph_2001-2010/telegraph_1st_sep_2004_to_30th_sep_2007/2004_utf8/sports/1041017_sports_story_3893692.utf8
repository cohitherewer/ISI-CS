Chennai: Half an hour after the third day?s play got over, John Buchanan was glued to his laptop in the balcony near the players? dressing-room. The Australian coach was still trying to figure out the vital statistics that would help him remove the anomalies in team strategy. 

The Aussies are already feeling the heat on and off the field. Having to field in temperatures close to 40 degrees and energy-sapping humidity for one-and-a-half days has left them drained. So much so that even during drinks breaks, batsmen are sitting under garden umbrellas brought to the middle by reserve players. 

If being 141 runs in arrears on the first innings was not enough, the visitors ? after seeming to be cruising at 121 for two ? lost another couple of vital wickets (Simon Katich and Adam Gilchrist) towards the close to be ahead by only nine runs. 

The stand-in captain?s promotion in the order was aimed at unsettling the bowlers. He didn?t manage that but, nevertheless, produced 49 vital runs. 

The Indians could have been in a better position had Parthiv Patel and the close-in cordon managed to take all the catches. Patel?s good work with the bat ? he made 54 before falling to Shane Warne ? was undone by his misses behind the wicket on this turning track. He often misjudged the bounce and his collection has been poor. 

Anil Kumble added three more wickets ? Justin Langer, Matthew Hayden and Gilchrist ? to take his kitty to 10 (for the sixth time) in the match. But it was Harbhajan Singh who kept the pressure on the batsmen with his subtle mix of pace while extracting bounce and turn from the wicket. 

?Hopefully, we?ll be able to finish them by tea tomorrow,? Harbhajan said. 

That the Indians managed to add another 85 runs to their overnight score of 291 for six was mainly due to the efforts of Mohammed Kaif and Patel. The pair added 102 for the seventh wicket. Patel ?walked? half-an-hour before lunch, misreading a Warne delivery. But Kaif showed great application and determination as he kept going. 

Kaif?s run out was under unfortunate circumstances. Having retired at lunch-time because of acute dehydration leading to cramps all over his body, he was forced to come out with a runner (Yuvraj Singh) following the quick dismissals of Kumble and Harbhajan. But, as luck would have it, he fell rushing out of his crease on impulse after playing a reverse sweep against Warne. 

Kaif, writhing in pain, failed to beat the throw despite a valiant dive. Cramps had left the most energetic and enthusiastic of Indian fielders almost immobile. Non-striker Zaheer Khan and runner Yuvraj had completed the run, but Kaif could not make his ground. 

The Australians could have shown some restraint, keeping in mind the spirit in which this Test match has been played, but that was not to be and their appeal was upheld. 

Kaif?s 64 off 157 balls was a valiant effort. There was no grandeur in his approach, just pure commitment. His body was alive with the challenge of the moment, and he enjoyed the pressure situation. Back in the Test side after three years and having walked in at 213 for five, he knew he had to perform for himself and the team. 

?I didn?t drink enough water and also had viral fever in Bangalore. It was all a result of weakness,? Kaif said later. 

He termed his dismissal as funny. ?I kind of lost myself? wasn?t focused enough. It was a lapse in concentration under tough conditions,? Kaif explained. 

However confident the Indian might have been of Warne, given his past performance, the world record-holder finished with his first five-wicket haul against India (28th overall). 

The careful planning for Warne by Buchanan this time has finally come good. 

Buchanan believes that in 2001, Warne?s main problem was that he was asked to restrict runs as well as take wickets. Performing these two tasks simultaneously proved a bit too difficult for him in these conditions. 

The dual role was ruled out this time at the very outset. While it was envisaged that he would benefit from an attacking gameplan, Glenn McGrath, Jason Gillespie and Michael Kasprowicz were expected to restrict the run-flow at the other end. It also meant less workload for Warne, thereby not wearing him down. 

His six for 127 is the first hint of success for Warne against India. He has already acknowledged that he is bowling better than on his two previous visits. 

Warne will have to reproduce the same magic if the Auusies harbour any hopes of keeping their lead going into the Nagpur Test.

 Tollygunge storm into last 4 

 Gouranga Dutta scored the first 

Bangalore: Tollygunge Agragami blanked Fransa Football Club 3-0 to storm into the semi-finals of 26th Federation Cup football championship on Sunday. 

After a goalless first half, Gouranga Dutta opened the account in the 51st minute, while defender Tarif Ahmed increased the lead 14 minutes later before Surajit Bose consolidated the team?s position in the 82nd minute. 

In a late surge, Tollygunge struck the first goal through Dutta in a goal mouth scramble. Ahmed missed his shot and it rebounded of Fransa custodian Kalyan Chowbey. An alert Gouranga, who was waiting near the goalmouth, got possession of the ball and slammed it into the net. 

Dominating the proceedings in the second session, Tollygunge increased the lead when Ahmed succeeded in netting the ball off a cross from Akeem Abalonlee. 

Fransa, which demolished the last year title-holders Mahindra United in the pre-quarters, opened their quarter-final campaign on a promising note, dominating the proceedings in the first half. The Goan outfit miffed a golden opportunity in the 25th minute when defender Jules Claudio Dias Alberto, failed to score from a free-kick awarded to the team near the goalmouth. 

Naushad Pari made a good effort in the 32nd minute for Fransa, but Tollygunge?s keeper Arindam Ghosh effected a save.

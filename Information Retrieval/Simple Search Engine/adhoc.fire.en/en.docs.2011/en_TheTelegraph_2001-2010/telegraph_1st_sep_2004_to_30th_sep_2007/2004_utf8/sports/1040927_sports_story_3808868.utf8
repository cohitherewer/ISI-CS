The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Bhowmick eyes winning every match

 A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Despite offering his resignation on Saturday following the debacle in the AFC Cup quarter final against Al Jaish, East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick was, however, present during practice at the club ground on Sunday. 

The team had a one hour training under heavy downpour ahead of their Monday?s CFL Super division league clash against George Telegraph. 

Bhowmick said he wanted to resign from the coach?s position, but his request has been turned down by the club officials. 

?The loss to Al Jaish is still haunting me and the only way that we can compensate this defeat is winning every match,? the coach said. 

Meanwhile, East Bengal have decided not to release Subhas Chakraborty for the national camp to be held in Margao from October 3. Chakraborty, who had an injury, has only started post-operative training. 

Club officials informed that they are going to inform the AIFF about the player?s injury. The club will also reply to the AIFF?s showcause notice by October 10.

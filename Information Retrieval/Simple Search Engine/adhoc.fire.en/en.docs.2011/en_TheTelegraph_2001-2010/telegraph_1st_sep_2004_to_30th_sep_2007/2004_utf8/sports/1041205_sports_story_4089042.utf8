 Patel, Modi frustrate Railways

Ahmedabad: A sparkling unbeaten century by Niraj Patel helped hosts Gujarat reach 201 for two on the first day of the elite A Ranji Trophy cricket tie against Railways at Motera Stadium on Saturday. 

Though opener Nilesh Modi gave a lightning start to the team with a fine 72, the other opener Akash Christian could not keep up the tempo and was sent back to the pavilion after being trapped lbw to Railways seamer J. P. Yadav. 

Christian?s dismal score was compensated by Patel, who scored 107 not out with 16 hits to the fence.

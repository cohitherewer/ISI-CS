Madrid: Top seed Tim Henman finally won a match at the Madrid Masters on Wednesday, producing a classy display to beat Spain?s Albert Costa 6-4, 6-2 and reach the third round. 

The Briton, who had lost his two previous contests in the Spanish capital, moved 5-1 ahead in the first set and took it after a minor wobble. 

Costa held his opening service game in the second set but Henman?s greater consistency took him to victory in one hour and 25 minutes. 

Fifth-seeded Chilean Nicolas Massu lost 3-6, 6-3, 3-6 to American Taylor Dent in the tournament?s biggest upset. 

Thai Paradorn Srichaphan secured a 7-6, 6-3 victory over Spaniard Alex Corretja to book a third-round match against fourth seed David Nalbandian. 

Henman will face Ivan Ljubicic, who defeated Germany?s Rainer Schuettler 6-3, 6-0. The Briton has only beaten the big- serving Croatian once in three matches. 

?These will be conditions that suit him (Ljubicic) well,? Henman said. ?He?s got a huge, huge serve.? 

Henman broke Costa twice early in the match to move 3-0 ahead as the former French Open champion?s weak serve offered easy pickings. 

Henman extended his lead to 5-1 before his concentration wavered and Costa regained his nerve to claw back three games. Serving for the set for the second time, Henman regained his focus, and after saving a break-point produced a forehand winner which wrong-footed Costa. (REUTERS)

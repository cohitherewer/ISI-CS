Karachi: Pakistan batsman Younis Khan will keep wicket again against Sri Lanka on Wednesday after Moin Khan was ruled out of the third match of a triangular one-day tournament. 

Captain Inzamam-ul-Haq, however, who also missed the previous game against Zimbabwe, will play after recovering from a groin strain while fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar and allrounder Abdul Razzaq return after being rested. 

?Younis will keep wicket because Moin has still not recovered,? Inzamam said on Tuesday. Younis played as ?keeper against Zimbabwe in Peshawar on Sunday after Moin went down with flu and won the Man-of-the-Match award after making 77 off 86 balls. 

Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer has suggested Younis could be moulded into a ODI wicketkeeper in the future. 

Inzamam said the absence of Sri Lanka spinner Muttiah Muralidharan, the world?s leading Test wicket-taker who is recovering from a shoulder operation, would make a difference. 

?He is a great and match winning bowler. Obviously they will miss him. But I think they still have a strong bowling line-up,? he said. 

Pakistan beat Zimbabwe in the first two games of the tournament. 

?It is going to be a tough game for us as Pakistan are difficult opponents but I think we have a balanced side and we have been playing well,? Sri Lanka skipper Maravan Atapattu said.

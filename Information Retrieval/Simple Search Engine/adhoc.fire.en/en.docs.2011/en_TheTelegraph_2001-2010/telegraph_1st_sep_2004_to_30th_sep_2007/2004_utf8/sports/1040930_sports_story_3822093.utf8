Multan: Pakistan cricket captain Inzamam-ul Haq is confident his team can win their first one-day tournament at home ahead of their tri-series opener against Zimbabwe on Thursday. 

The hosts? real test is expected to come from Asian champions Sri Lanka, the third team in the series, where all sides face each other twice with the top two playing in the October 16 final. 

Pakistan never won a one-day tournament at home after failing in the 1987 and 1996 World Cups and in a tri-series in 1994 and a four-team tournament in 1997. 

?I am confident that we will win our first one-day title at home,? said Inzamam, adding, ?Although Zimbabwe are rank outsiders, we will not take them lightly.? 

The current Pakistan side has shown remarkable improvement under new coach Bob Woolmer. Since Woolmer?s induction in June this year, Pakistan won four of their five matches in the Asia Cup in July in Sri Lanka followed by a runners-up finish to Australia in the tri-series in Amstelveen, Holland. 

They also came close to defeating Australia in a one-off limited overs international at Lord?s before losing to the West Indies in the semi-final of the ICC Champions Trophy in England. 

?We have shown improvement, but the real thing is the winning finish where we have shown weakness and need to sort out that problem,? said Inzamam. ?We lost to Sri Lanka in the Asia Cup and now need to beat them to win the title.?

 on Wednesday

Zimbabwe drew a two-day tour opener in Pakistan before suffering an innings defeat in a four-day match last week. 

?We are a young team but we can take inspiration from our good showing against Sri Lanka in England earlier this month where we gave them a run for their money,? said Zimbabwe captain Tatenda Taibu. ?We have set targets for ourselves so it?s a process of learning.? 

Pakistan again face Zimbabwe in the second match at Peshawar on October 3 before their October 6 game against Sri Lanka, who arrive on Monday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Bagan desperate for win versus JCT

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Mohun Bagan go into their Federation Cup quarter final against JCT in Bangalore on Tuesday knowing that a loss could compound matters further in the trouble-torn club. 

Having narrowly missed out winning the IFA Shield, Durand Cup and the CFL Super Division, the green-and-maroons are desperate to win some silverware, admitted coach Subrata Bhattacharya while talking to The Telegraph over phone from Bangalore. 

His main worry still remains the central defender?s position. With Eduardo Coelho not having made the trip to Bangalore due to injury, the coach has to make do with Noel Wilson or Dulal Biswas. 

?JCT is a good team, but I am not thinking of anything other than a win,? Bhattacharya said. 

Dempo up 

PTI adds from Bangalore: Dempo advanced to the last four with a 1-0 win over Churhill Brothers at the Kanteerava Stadium Monday. Dempo will meet Tollygunge Agragami. 

Brazilian Cristiano Junior scored the all-important goal in the 80th minute, after Churchill goalkeeper Mark Mascarenhas failed to cleanly collect a shot from Ronty Soleye Martins. 

As the ball popped out of his hands, Brazilian striker Junior made no mistake with the rebound.

 Kenteris lawyer rubbishes Balco claim

Athens: The lawyer of disgraced Greek sprinters Kostadinos Kenteris and Ekaterina Thanou rubbished claims that they were supplied with the once-undetectable steroid tetrahydrogestrinone (THG) by the Balco laboratory. 

Mihalis Dimitrakopoulos was responding to claims that an e-mail included in papers filed on Friday by prosecutors in the United States featured Balco founder Victor Conte making a reference to THG being used by the Greek athletes. 

Their lawyer, however, branded the claim as an ?enormous lie? by Balco in a bid to gain publicity. 

?The lie is proven by the report from the American judge dealing with the Balco affair and which says nothing of note regarding the two Greek champions,? said Dimitrakopoulos, who did not deny the existence of the e-mail. 

The athletes? coach Christos Tzekos also claimed that Conte had wanted ?to generate a huge amount of publicity? by using the names of the sprinters. 

?There?s nothing new, the bid to implicate us in the Balco affair is old,? added Tzekos, who recently parted company with Kenteris. 

Kenteris, a Greek hero after winning gold in the 200m at the Sydney Olympics, and Thanou, silver medallist in the women?s 100m four years ago, withdrew from the Athens Olympics in August after missing a doping test. 

The two athletes and the controversial Tzekos have been accused of obstructing International Olympic Committee (IOC) testers and making false statements about an alleged motorbike accident. 

Names of the Greek sprinters were found on a document that was part of a filing to rebut a defence motion in the case against Conte. 

The message to a track coach said that ?Kenteris? and Thanou ?have access to both agents?, a reference investigators say refers to THG and a testosterone cream, a newspaper reported.

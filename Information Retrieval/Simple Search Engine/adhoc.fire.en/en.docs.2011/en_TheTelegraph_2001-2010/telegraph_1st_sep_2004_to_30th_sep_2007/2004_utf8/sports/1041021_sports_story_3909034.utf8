The Telegraph - Calcutta

 The Rach debate rages

 - Problems remain on the long-term fate of the Indian coach

Calcutta: The debate over the tenure and credibility of India chief hockey coach, German Gerhard Rach, rages. Just the other day the Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) made it clear that the coach will be given more powers to choose teams, and on Wednesday, his tenure is up to question. 

A PTI story of Wednesday, from New Delhi, quoted ?sources? in the IHF as saying that Rach could face the axe if India do not finish among the top four in the Lahore Champions Trophy. When The Telegraph contacted IHF secretary K. Jyothikumaran over phone on this, he flatly denied any such move as ?sheer imagination of whoever the ?sources? were.? 

?There is definitely no such move on, and the IHF keeps full faith in Gerhard Rach. That is why we have given him the responsibility of the developing team in the first place. 

[?I want to make it clear that the IHF does not expect a great result from the Lahore Champions Trophy. We expect to give off a great display in the Chennai edition of the meet and in the 2006 World Cup,? Jyothikumaran said. ?This is a new, developing team, a team that we are concentrating on building. We have a long term view on this.? 

Jyothikumaran said that Rach will not be present at the opening of the camp in Chandigarh on October 27. ?Rach will be back from home on November 6. But this will not create a problem, because anyway in the first week of any camp it is mainly physical training.? 

Whatever the rumours are, though, another IHF source told this correspondent Wednesday that a ?long-term outlook will indeed have to be developed when the Union sports ministry and IHF president K.P. Gill sit down to discuss policy.? 

Hence, while the Lahore Champions Trophy stricture has been clearly rubbished by the secretary, problems do remain on the fate of Rach on the long term, whatever Jyothikumaran says on a ?development team?. 

So far, Rach does not have a contract that runs for any decent period of time uninterrupted. His contract after the Olympic Games was for the India-Pakistan Test series, and that has been renewed for an unknown period for the Champions Trophy. ?Since now there is enough time, the bosses will take their time in deciding on the issue,? the source told this correspondent. 

PTI had quoted its ?sources? as saying that several applications do lie with the IHF, including that of Rick Charlesworth. This, though, is not news. These applications have been around for some time, and not much has come off them anyway. In fact, the Charlesworth application came through way back, during the Madrid qualifiers. There is major doubt as to how good this appoint can be, because even the Australians have not allowed him back into any post of consequence (after he had been successful with the women?s team). 

Jyothikumaran refused to see any meaning into this and said that those issues were not even on anybody?s minds now. ?We are simply focused on the job at hand and the development thereafter,? he said.

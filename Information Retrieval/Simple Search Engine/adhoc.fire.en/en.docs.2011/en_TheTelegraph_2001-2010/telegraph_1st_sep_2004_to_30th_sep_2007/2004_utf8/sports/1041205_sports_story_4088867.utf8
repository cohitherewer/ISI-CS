The Telegraph - Calcutta

 ?Greed for money was Cronje?s weakness?

 Cronje tried to organise the ?perfect fix?, says Kirsten 

Durban: Former South African opener Gary Kirsten had heard rumours about match-fixing but it was a simple conversation about a burger with his captain Hansie Cronje that made him realise ?someting had gone very wrong? with the game. 

In some startling revelations, Kirsten talks about Cronje?s obsession with money and how he tried to involve the whole South African team in match-fixing in his autobiography ?Gazza? ? co-authored by South Africa-based journalist Neil Manthorp. 

According to excerpts in a Brisbane-based paper, Kirsten says he was tipped off about the enormity of the scandal during the team?s tour of Dubai in 1999. 

He reveals how Cronje tried to orchestrate cricket?s ?perfect fix? in a one-day International against India in Mumbai in 1996-97 (it was Mohin Der Amarnath?s benefit match) by calling the full squad to his room ? without coach Bob Woolmer ? to discuss an offer from a local bookmaker. 

[Incidentally, Woolmer had this to tell The Telegraph in a recent interview: ?I was asked to join a meeting called by the players and, on hearing of the agenda, I insisted they spurn the offer and steer well clear of dubious people. Did I know what the meeting would be all about? No. I?m not aware if the players met again, but the approach was rejected at that meeting. At that time, nobody wanted to get involved.?] 

? ?We have been offered a lot of money to throw a game?, he said. I swear you could have heard a pin drop at that moment,? Kirsten reveals. 

?I listened but it was out of respect for the captain and a strange fascination with what he was saying rather than any intention to carry out instructions. 

?He had been asked to create the perfect fix. He spelt out the details of how the match had to pan out, with a spread of scores we needed to be within every five overs. 

?There was just a bit too much banter about the subject around the team. The captain of six years? standing was talking about match-fixing a lot and joking to his players about being involved. 

?The power of wealth and the greed for money were his weaknesses, and he was more heavily addicted than any of us knew. Perhaps as a senior player I should have acted but hindsight is a perfect science and life isn?t.?

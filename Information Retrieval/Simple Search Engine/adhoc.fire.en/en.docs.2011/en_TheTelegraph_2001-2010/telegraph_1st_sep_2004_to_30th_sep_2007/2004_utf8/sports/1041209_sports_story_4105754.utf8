 McGrath the danger man, says Youhana

Perth: Pakistan batsman Yousuf Youhana has pinpointed fast bowler Glenn McGrath as Australia?s danger man ahead of the upcoming Test series. 

Youhana, who forms the backbone of the tourists? batting along with captain Inzamam-ul Haq, said he rated McGrath as the ?perfect? bowler and Pakistan?s greatest obstacle in the three-Test series. 

?I think McGrath is the best bowler I?ve faced. Except for Wasim (Akram), I think he?s the best,? Youhana said. 

?But McGrath is the perfect bowler for me.? 

The right-hander scored 95 and 75 in his maiden Test in Australia ? in Brisbane in 1999-2000 ? but found hard to get runs thereafter, scoring just 37 in four subsequent innings. 

?After (Brisbane) they planned (for) me. But hopefully I will make some runs this time,? he added. 

Youhana and Inzamam refused to speculate on whether Australia might select pacer Brett Lee alongside McGrath and Jason Gillespie for the first Test starting Thursday on Perth?s fast and bouncy wicket. 

But they agreed that both have to be among runs if Pakistan is to post big first-innings scores and beat Australia at its own game.

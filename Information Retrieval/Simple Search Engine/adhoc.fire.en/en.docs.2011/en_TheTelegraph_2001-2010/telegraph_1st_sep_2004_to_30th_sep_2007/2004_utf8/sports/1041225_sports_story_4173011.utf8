 Dujon Jamaica?s coaching director

 Kingston: Former West Indies wicketkeeper Jeffrey Dujon has been selected as Jamaica?s national coaching director, an official said. 

Brian Breese, Chief Executive Officer of the Jamaica Cricket Association, said Thursday Dujon will supervise coaching across the island, with emphasis on the under-15 level. He did not say when Dujon will begin. 

Breese said the 49-year-old Dujon will also work with Jamaican senior team coach Robert Haynes and with the chairman of the senior selection panel, Ruddy Williams. 

A stylish right-hander, Dujon made his debut for the West Indies against Australia in 1981 and is considered one of the best wicketkeeper-batsmen to play the game. He scored 3,322 runs in 81 Tests for the West Indies including five centuries, taking 265 catches. (AP)

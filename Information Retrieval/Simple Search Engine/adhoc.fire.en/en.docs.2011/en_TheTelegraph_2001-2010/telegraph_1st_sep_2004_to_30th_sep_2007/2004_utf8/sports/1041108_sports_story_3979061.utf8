New Delhi: Junior international goalkeeper Subrata Paul emerged as Mohun Bagan?s hero, lifting them to the final of the Durand Cup football tournament. 

Paul stopped a penalty from Nigerian forward Felix Ibrebru in regulation time and then again foiled the striker?s second attempt in penalty shoot-out to enable Mohun Bagan defeat holders Salgaocar 5-4 on Sunday. 

It is the green-and-maroon outfit?s 26th entry in the title final and the first since 2000. The final will also be Subrata Bhattacharya?s second as coach. It was under his tenure that the glamour side had won Durand Cup the last time in 2000. 

The match was also sweet revenge for Bagan?s 0-2 loss to Salgaocar in the 1999 Durand semi finals. They will now take on either East Bengal or JCT in the final on Wednesday. 

With the score remaining goalless at the end of extra-time, the semi-final had to be decided on penalties. Bagan converted all five attempts. Jerry Zirsanga, Mehtab Hussain, Sunil Chhetri, Dulal Biswas and Dharamjit Singh finding the net. While for Salgaocar, Bello Rasaq, Jothi Kumar, Freddy Mascarenhas and Samson Singh were on target. 

In the absence of any volunteers, the onus to take Salgaocar?s last shot fell on Felix. He tried to change direction by taking the kick to the right of Paul. But the Bagan custodian anticipated well and palmed the ball to safety. 

Despite the defeat, credit must be given to the young Goan team for stretching Bagan. However, they were down to 10 men after midfielder Micky Fernandez was shown the red card for a vicious tackle on substitute Tomba Singh in the fourth minute of extra time. 

Despite the numerical advantage, the Calcutta outfit failed to find a breakthrough thanks to some excellent defending from former international Roberto Fernandez. 

The first half was listless, as both sides packed the midfield and opted for safety-first tactics. Bagan coach, who had resisted using his national players Tomba and Zirsanga ? who returned on Sunday morning after playing a friendly in Kuwait ? in the starting line up. Their introduction later in the game brought some spark in the team. However, Chhetri and Dharamjit squandered the chances that fell their way. 

Salgaocar attacked in spurts and got a lucky penalty kick in the 78th minute. Following a corner, Felix at the near post headed across the goal and both Chhetri and Rassaq went for the ball. Rassaq took a tumble and the referee awarded a penalty. However, Felixs attempt was kept out by Paul.

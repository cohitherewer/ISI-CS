 Pekerman takes over from Bielsa

Buenos Aires: Argentina named triple World Youth Cup winner Jose Pekerman as their new national coach on Thursday, 48 hours after the shock resignation of Marcelo Bielsa. 

?We wish him all the best, we know who he is, he has a great track record and personally I?m very happy he?s back with us,? said Argentine Football Association (AFA) president Julio Grondona. 

Pekerman, an exponent of flowing football, all-out attack and fair play, was in charge of Argentina?s under-20 team from 1994 to 2002, when they won the World Youth Cup in 1995, 1997 and 2001. 

Bielsa, who led Argentina to their first Olympic soccer gold medal last month, left on Tuesday, saying he had run out of energy after six years in the high-pressure job. 

Pekerman was second choice to step into the void, but was given his chance after former Boca Juniors coach Carlos Bianchi turned down the job, saying he had other priorities outside football. 

?I?m happy to be here again and I hope to repay the confidence which Julio Grondona has placed in me,? Pekerman said. ?I?m aware of the responsibility I?m taking.? 

Pekerman inherits a team brimming with young talent, much of which he helped develop as the under-20 coach. 

His proteges include Pablo Aimar, Juan Roman Riquelme, Javier Saviola, Walter Samuel, Esteban Cambiasso and Fabricio Coloccini. 

Bielsa?s resignation came after he had managed to blend a team containing several players in their early 20s along with members of the older generation such as Javier Zanetti, Cristian Gonzalez and Roberto Ayala. 

Twice world champions Argentina are second in the South American World Cup qualifying group. 

Pekerman faces a tough start to his reign with World Cup qualifiers against two of Argentina?s fiercest rivals in four days. They host Uruguay on October 9 and travel to Santiago to meet Chile on October 12. (Reuters)

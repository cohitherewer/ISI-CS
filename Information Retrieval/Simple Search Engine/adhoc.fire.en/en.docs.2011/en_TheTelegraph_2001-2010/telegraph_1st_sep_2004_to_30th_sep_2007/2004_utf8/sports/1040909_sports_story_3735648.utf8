Calcutta: There was no miracle. No story with a mind-over-matter script was told. In the end, Japan handed Stephen Constantine?s India a clear and sound verdict in their World Cup qualifier at the Salt Lake Stadium on Wednesday that was real and therefore, more reliable: that the gap between the two nations remain at least four goals. 

Perhaps in a connotation of all this, darkness suddenly descended on the stadium due to a power failure during the half-time, much to the disgrace of the organisers and the nation as a whole. By then, Japan were leading by Takayuki Suzuki?s goal. Play resumed after half-an-hour, but there was no more light visible on the face of Indian football as the visitors out-muscled, outwitted and outmanoeuvred Debjit Ghosh amp; Co. 

Shinji Ono, Takashi Fukunishi and captain Tsuneyasu Miyamoto completed the rout in a ravaging second-half, plunging Constantine?s boys into hopelessness. India are now certain to suffer from digestive problems after swallowing the bitter pills of 16 goals in their last three matches (including the 0-7 humiliation against the same rivals in Saitama in June and 0-5 to Oman before that). 

Debjit, soon after taking the rein from injured Bhaichung Bhutia, admitted that losing by three to four goals would be ?acceptable and creditable? for his team. His assessment of his team turned out right, but the scar will surely take a long time to get healed. 

On a night, when the players in blue were supposed to show grace and guts under pressure, they surprisingly caved in with no combativeness and left black-and-blue by Zico?s speedy, spectacular team. Despite all those promises of defensive resilience, the back-line was simply chilled by the brutal experience of one Japanese surge after another as the visitors from the land of sunrise struck at the heart of the Debjits and Dipak Mondals with painful intensity. Dipak might have stood out with a disciplined performance, but his teammates had no clue on how to check the marauding force. 

Constantine showed a great degree of courage in his line-up, starting with Abhishek Yadav and R.C. Prakash upfront. The obvious aim was to capitalise moves on the break. 

On the other hand, there was no Japanese tsunami at the outset as well. Zico planned the build-up with initial focus on understanding the alien land and atmosphere. 

Despite this, Japan earned as many as four corners inside the opening ten minutes, but the Indian defence managed to keep the attackers in control. In fact, Jatin Bist came up with a feeble attempt on the break on one occasion. The midfield was showing promise and S. Venkatesh was directing the traffic with vigour. The medio even tested the rival defence once with a brilliant solo run. 

India matched the fancied Japanese move by move, step by step till the visitors accelerated the speed and urgency to make things happen. It could have been anywhere anytime, as it seemed, but Sandip Nandy acrobatically denied Naohiro Takahara in the 22nd minute and Cimax Lawrence came just in time in the way of Ono?s thumping right-footer. 

Then in the 42nd minute, India yielded another move on the break. Sameer Naik released for Venkatesh, who darted forward, only to be blocked near the box. The ball went to Bist, who promptly crossed towards other end. But Prakash was nowhere near it. 

Two minutes later came the first blow. Alessandro Santos wove his way through the dual challenge of Naik and Debjit and Sandip partially managed to parry the left-half?s attempt. Suzuki pounced on the rebound with a right-footer. 

Then came the delayed second-half and with it, the Japanese tsunami in its full flow. Ono made it 2-0 within 13 minutes, with a low well-directed free-kick as India gradually lost the head and heart out of the match. 

Under the avalanche of attacks, the defence looked tired and exhausted. The midfield?s early signs of resilience vanished and Abhishek never seemed intent on justifying his role. 

It was also an experience to see of how the Japanese captain had influenced the events from the deep. Some of his long passes were so exquisite that the ball was directed firmly to the friendly feet without risk of interception. 

The third goal, in fact, originated from one of these passes from Miyamoto when he fed the substitute Tatsuhiko Kubo in the middle. The latter released it for Santos on the left whose floater was deftly headed in by Fukunishi. 

Three minutes from time, the demolition came to an end when the captain himself finished acrobatically following a corner. 

In a bizarre incident, Syrian referee Basel Hajjar took the red card out of his pocket against a mild foul on Lawrence by Toshiya Fujita in the 77th minute. Fujita was shocked. Realising later his mistake, Hajjar changed his mind to yellow.

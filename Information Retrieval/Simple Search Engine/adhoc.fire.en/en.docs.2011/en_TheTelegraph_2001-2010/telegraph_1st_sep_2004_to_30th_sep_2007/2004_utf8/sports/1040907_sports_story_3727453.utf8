The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Rennedy injury the latest blow 

 - Hope team gives 101 per cent: Bhaichung

Calcutta: First, it was Ashim Biswas. Then Bhaichung Bhutia. And now it may be Rennedy Singhs turn to sit on the sidelines with injury. True, Indias build-up to the World Cup qualifier against the Asian Cup champions Japan could not be worse than this. 

During practice at the Salt Lake Stadium on Monday, two days ahead of the match, Rennedy suffered an injury on his right ankle and was forced to quit the training session. 

Coach Stephen Constantine didnt talk to the reporters on the issue. And team doctor Manab Bhattacharya remarked that its not much to worry but also added that it would be too early to say whether he would be cent per cent fit before the match. 

Thus, after injury had taken the sheen out of the Indian upfront through the absence of Bhaichung and Ashim, the recent mishap (of whatever nature it may be now) appears to be an out and out blow to the Indian thinktank. 

The task will become more difficult if India miss Rennedys service. This is unfortunate, particularly for Constantine, since the player forms an integral part of the coachs strategy. After a 0-7 drubbing in the away outing, in Saitama in June, Debjit Ghosh and companys ambition of putti ng up a better show is hitting one hurdle after another. 

National selector V.P. Sathyan, however, exuded confidence. The boys are upbeat. This time well surely play better than the last time, he said. Unlike last time, we have the home advantage. Its a known turf for our boys. A large number of spectators will be roaring for us here as well, he added. 

Constantine, like other days, concentrated on defence. A bulk of his one-hour practice at the stadium centred around setpiece movements and long ball attacks. 

Meanwhile, Bhaichung showed up at the ground to cheer his teammates. I hope they give 101 per cent on theday, Bhaichung said. He also informed that he would take another four weeks to return to the field. 

Later in the team hotel, Japan team secretary Matsumoto was seen making last minute preparations for Zico amp; Co. I always reach the venue two days before a match, so that the players and officials dont find it difficult to adapt with the situations, Matsumoto said. According to the team secretary, he has brought miso (Japanese soup), Japanese rice and few other ingredients for their 18-hour stay in the city. 

Matsumoto said Shunsuke Nakamura has been dropped from the Japanese squad due to lower back pain. 

AIFF secretary Alberto Colaco said that the federation was planning to form a junior side to serve as a supply line for the seniors. We will form an under-22 side to act as a feeder line for the national squad in case of injury-induced lay-offs of frontliners, quot; he said.

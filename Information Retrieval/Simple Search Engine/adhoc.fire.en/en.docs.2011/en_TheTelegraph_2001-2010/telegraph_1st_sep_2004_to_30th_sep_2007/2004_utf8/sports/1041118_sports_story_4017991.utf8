The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Anand nod for players? body

A CORRESPONDENT

 Viswanathan Anand 

Calcutta: Indian Super Grandmaster Viswanathan 

Anand has finally decided to join the proposed Chess Players? Association of India, 

and so has GM Krishnan Sasikiran, boosting the morale of the proposed body that 

has protested the AICF?s decision to cut prize money by ten per cent. 

The first open protest was at the Pune International 

meet where the players wore black badges. At the just-concluded International 

Open here, the body took a proper shape and formal acknowledgements from the players. 

Abhijit Kunte, the champion of the International Open, 

told The Telegraph on Wednesday: ?The association will work for the betterment 

of Indian chess. As of now, we plan to restrict membership to players having Elo 

rating of 2300-plus. We do not want to go into any confrontation with the federation. 

?AICF secretary P.T. Umer Koya has promised to reconsider 

its decision at the general body meeting to be held in Kochi Friday. I sincerely 

hope that the AICF won?t force us to take drastic measures.?

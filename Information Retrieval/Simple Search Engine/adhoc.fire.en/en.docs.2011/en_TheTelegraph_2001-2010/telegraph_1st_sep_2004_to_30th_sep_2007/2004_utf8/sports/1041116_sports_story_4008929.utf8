 Age no bar for Immaculate 

 STAR RACER

 Eight-year-old Immaculate proved that age is no bar when he made capital use of his light-impost to score an easy victory in last Wednesday?s feature event, the 1,200m Hilliard Cup. The less-fancied Errol Bhungard-trainee had been, of course, knocking at the door during his monsoon season campaign and was also given a lung opener on November 5. Above all, it was his handicap advantage that did the trick against fancied runners like Gypsy King, Anokato and Announcer. 

 Jockey Paul Kujur was right on target soon after the start. He allowed Daniel David?s duo of Brighter Future and Anokato to cut a sizzling hot-pace till 300m from home before shooting into a commanding lead which could not be narrowed by the ?ring? favourite Gypsy King.

 The victory of Immaculate had also helped Errol to complete a long-priced double. Earlier in the afternoon, trainer?s quiet fancy Chief Commissioner had landed the 1,400m Stand Off Handicap. But it was a close call for the 5-1 chance as stable?s Legendary Lover looked like delivering the goods after assuming charge of the running from Scent Of Victory 250m from home. However, it was apprentice Gajender Singh?s calculated effort on the winner that gained the advantage virtually at the post. 

 Make a note of the third-placed Scent Of Victory?s forward run, which points to his return to form. The three-year-old is at such a handicap mark that he may strike soon enough, albeit if ridden in a check.

 If Gajender was at his enterprising best on Chief Commissioner, his riding on the Daniel?s Secret Prospector, in the 1,200m Rising Star Cup, left lot to be desired. In fact, he allowed stable?s better-fancied runner Amazing Career to win. Gajender was seen applying negative tactics on Secret Prospector in the final furlong of the race and yet finished only half-a-length behind the winner. He was rightly suspended for six race meets after stewards? inquiry.

 Trainer Vijay Singh otherwise, ruled the afternoon. He not only cleaned off rest of the card, but he also proved a point that all youngsters don?t disappoint when pushed from sprints to a mile. Under similar circumstances, on November 5, Corvino had let down a big following. 

 Interestingly, Alashaan was ridden in almost Corvino?s manner to profit in the 1,600m Zifi Handicap. His fluent four-length-plus victory, in the hands of C. Alford was promising enough to suggest that the Diffident-Take A Powder son may strike again.

 In the Ardiles Cup, Vijay?s Apprise was also a facile winner despite his near eight-month?s lay-off from the track. The Don?t Forget Me-Sterling Lass four-year-old was held back a handy fourth by Alford and pushed into the lead bisecting, Sea Legend and Ballet Master, 200m from home. Alford sat tight, thereafter, to the frustration Royal Bounty and his rider Gajender.

 The third win of the Vijay-Alford-combo was a thriller but Annabee?s superior finishing prowess notched up the issue from stable-fancy Shalom. More importantly, Shalom was brought the shortest way home while Annabee took the circuitous route and yet scored.

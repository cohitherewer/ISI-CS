The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Boof vs Rig for charity

 Darren ?Boof? Lehmann 

 Adelaide: In what promises to be a spectacular 

 show, a charity race between the two slowest members of 

 the Australian and New Zealand cricket teams, has been arranged 

 with full-length body suits. 

 Black Caps? opening batsman Mark Richardson has thrown 

 the gauntlet at senior Australian batsman Darren Lehmann 

 to a mouth-watering 100m race at the Adelaide Oval after 

 the second Test, which gets underway on Friday. 

A figure-hugging, full-length bright yellow and green body suit is being sent from New Zealand for Lehmann ? known as ?Boof? ? to wear, while Richardson, not to be outdone, will sport a skin-tight 1980s beige and brown NZ one-day outfit, complete with Cathy Freeman-style hood. 

Dour left-hander and noted prankster Richardson, who is nicknamed ?Rig? (as in rigor mortis), regularly challenges the slowest member of the opposition after every New Zealand Test match series. 

 The ?Boof versus Rig? race was given the green light 

 last Wednesday when Lehmann said he would, fitness permitting, 

 answer Richardson?s challenge.

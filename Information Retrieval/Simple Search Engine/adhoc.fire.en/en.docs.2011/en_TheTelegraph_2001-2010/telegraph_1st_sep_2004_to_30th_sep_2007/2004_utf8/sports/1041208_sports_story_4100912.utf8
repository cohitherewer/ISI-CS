The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Toss played a big role, says Gavaskar

A STAFF REPORTER

 Rohan Gavaskar is against too many changes in squad 

Calcutta: Both Bengal coach Karsan Ghavri and captain Rohan Gavaskar are averse to the idea of carrying out a major reshuffle in the Bengal squad prior to their next Ranji Trophy clash against Andhra Pradesh. 

Ghavri was critical of his batsmen for showing lack of application in Bengal?s defeat to Mumbai by an innings and 132 runs on Tuesday. 

?To me, some guys are wasting their place. The selectors have already got the message and it?s up to them to decide on carrying out any change (in the squad),? he said after the match at the Jadavpur University?s Salt Lake campus ground on Tuesday. 

He, however, clarified that ?a wholesome change with new faces? was not the need of the hour. ?After this defeat, it?s all about surviving relegation. So we need to bank on experienced guys who can endure pressure,? reasoned Ghavri. 

?We don?t have a good reserve bench? We need to have players like Subhamoy Das and Shib Sagar Singh in the team,? he added. 

Describing the team?s manner of defeat as ?very disappointing?, Gavaskar, however, said the toss had played a big role in the outcome of the match. 

?Had we won the toss, things could have been different? We didn?t have to bat on the last two days in that case. But this is an excuse. We lost because we played badly,? maintained Gavaskar. 

The Bengal captain said he?s ?not going to advocate too many drastic changes in the squad? in the selection meeting scheduled on Wednesday for the match against Andhra Pradesh. ?Unfortunately, our club cricket has just begun. So finding replacement isn?t easy,? the Bengal captain said.

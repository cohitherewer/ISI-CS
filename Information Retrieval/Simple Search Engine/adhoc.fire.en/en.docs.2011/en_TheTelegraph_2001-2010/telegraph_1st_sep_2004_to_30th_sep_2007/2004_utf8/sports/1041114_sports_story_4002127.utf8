 Players ready for bad wickets: Jennings

Jaipur: South Africa?s coach Ray Jennings has thrown the gauntlet up at the Indians, saying his players were ready to face every hurdle including ?bad wickets? in their quest to win the two-match Test series in the country. 

Jennings, who was appointed in place of Eric Simons only last month, took a dig at the under-prepared pitch in Mumbai during the recent Australian series and said his team was looking forward to take on the challenges the hosts could throw at them. 

?The Indian players gave me the impression that they could not play on their own pitches. From my side, whatever pitch you produce, I am ready for it, from cement pitch to sand pitch, it doesn?t really matter,? Jennings said. 

?I just look at the game, I am going to bat on it, and you are going to bat on it. It is just about who handles the pressure better, and who creates the pressure more,? the 50-year old former wicketkeeper-batsman said. ?I am quite excited to see how bad they can get the wickets. Get it as bad as you want, I am quite ready for it, ready for the heat. I am excited to see how much pressure India can create on a side. 

?I can walk away and say I have done my job as a coach mentally, technically. And if things go wrong, we can say there was weakness in our technique, our mental state. So I am waiting to see what the Indian cricket board can set up for us.? 

Jennings said his side has made plans to tame star batsman Sachin Tendulkar but was sure that the ever-demanding home crowd would make his work easier. 

?Tactics (against Tendulkar), yes, but I am not going to mention it. I can create pressure only when we get to bowl. But there is pressure sometimes even before you go into bat,? he said. 

?I don?t need to create the pressure, the Indian public will take care of it. The fans want him to score a six off every ball, they will create the pressure. 

?Basically as a cricketer he has been there, scored enough runs, and knows what to do. He is a tougher guy. Lot of world class batsmen are tougher guys, when they get into bad form they know how to pull themselves out of it.? 

Jennings said he would like to see his players dominate the proceedings for the better part of both the Test matches. ?From my side, I want the players to get their skills right. If they are losing one day and winning four days, I am happy. My skills are going to be right.? 

Jennings, who was regarded South Africa?s best keeper but played all his cricket when the country was in isolation, has raised his eyebrows even among his own countrymen with his radical approach to coaching. 

Soon after his appointment, he said the senior players ?needed a kick up the backside? and that he would make sure the players, if they asked for cola, got warm fluids. 

But there is a coldness also to the man who three years ago, as coach of eastern provincial side, asked pacer Andre Nel to bump the legendary Allan Donald when the latter came into bat. Donald was hit on the head and suffered concussion. 

?I told my fast bowler to hit Donald in the head, and I will tell my next fast bowler the same. If I see any weakness in the batsman and have a fast bowler to knock his head off, I will tell the fast bowler to knock his head off.? 

?It is all part of the game, to have a go at the opponent?s strengths and weaknesses. That is how I play the game. I sometimes play the game very hard,? Jennings said. 

The coach said he was reliving his dream of visiting India after missing out on the 1991-92 tour, South Africa?s first series after readmission into world cricket. 

?I think I am living my dream at the moment. It doesn?t really matter that I did not play, I am playing at the moment. 

The South African squad includes five non-white players, selected under the quota system but Jennings said he looked only at their skills and not the colour of the skin. 

?I don?t look at them as so called black players. They have come up to a level now where they are good enough to play international cricket. 

Jennings said Jacques Kallis was on his way to becoming the world?s No. 1 allrounder and warned the Indians of the threat Kallis? bowling was about to pose to them. 

?Kallis will come hard against India with his bowling. The Indian players must be careful that Kallis is ready to show up as a bowler. 

?There is no doubt in my mind that when I look up at the bowling (strengths), Kallis is here, and the Indians are going to see... A new Kallis. 

He said it was important for South Africa to allow younger players to grow if they were to get back to the top of the ICC rankings. 

?The aim is to bring new energy into the side. The old energy can be at times sluggish and it drops of from one to the other. And then South African cricket will get back to the ranking they rightly deserve.? (PTI)

 Warne?s googly to spin duo

 - ?I think we will dominate Harbhajan and Kumble?

Bangalore: Sounding a warning to Indian spinners Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh ahead of the first Test starting here on October 6, leg-spinner Shane Warne on Sunday said Australian batsmen will try to dominate the spin duo. 

?Our batsmen are in better shape against spinners than they have been at any other time. I think they are going to really try and dominate both Harbhajan (Singh) and Anil (Kumble),? Warne said. ?It?s going to be a great contest.? 

The Australian team arrived in Bangalore from Mumbai on Sunday. 

Earlier, during a promotional event, Australia?s stand-in skipper Adam Gilchrist said the tourists want to win the four-Test series with a ?tag of legitimacy? by taking on a full-strength Indian side that has Sachin Tendulkar in it. 

Gilchrist said he ?suspects? Sachin will play in the series-opening Test, beginning here on Wednesday, and his players also wanted that as they were keen to win ?legitimately?. 

?I think he (Sachin) will be there (for the first Test). Obviously, everyone would love to see him. He is the best batsman that I think I have ever seen. So, if we are going to win here (India) legitimately, it?s nice to play the best team possible,? Gilchrist said. 

The stand-in captain said his side was aware of India?s strengths at home but his players had planned well this time to counter the challenge. 

He said the Australians were aware as to how tough ?India is in home conditions, and by playing well in the last away series, they also proved how tough they are in Australian conditions as well. 

A point raised by Warne when he praised Irfan Pathan, saying: ?We have seen him over the last 6-12 months how good a bowler he is in both forms of the game. I think his battle with Matthew Hayden will be one to look out for.? 

Gilchrist said: ?We have utmost respect for the Indian team. (But) we have planned well. We are thorough. We have a very, very well balanced squad. It really comes down to preparations, and we should really play well.? 

Predicting an exciting and terrific series, he joked when asked what he has been telling the players as Australia have not won a series in India for 35 years. ?Having not won in 35 years, we have nothing to lose. No expectations that we are going to win,? he said. 

The Aussie ?keeper said his players were keen not to repeat the mistakes of 2001 when they lost the series 1-2. 

?We want to make sure that we get into the game and learn from the previous tours. We made a few mistakes last time around and lost the series. But there were some positives (in the one-day series) as well,? he said, recalling the historic series. 

Gilchrist said Australia has ?plans? for V.V.S. Laxman and Rahul Dravid, but those were nothing special and different. 

?Obviously, we put a lot of time and efforts in those guys who have been successful.? 

Describing Ricky Ponting?s absence from the first two Tests as disappointing, Gilchrist said the team nevertheless had the talent to ?cover up? for the setback. 

Gilchrist did not have a good series when Australia toured here last and he said he has given it a long and hard thought. ?Perhaps I did not had a right match plan,? he said adding that other players including himself have been talking to Matthew Hayden, who was hugely successful in 2001.

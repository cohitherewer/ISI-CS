The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Davenport in no hurry to quit

 - ?This isn?t going to be like the nail in the coffin? 

 Lindsay Davenport in action against Svetlana Kuznetsova at Flushing Meadow on Friday 

New York: Lindsay Davenport exited the US Open disappointed but not downhearted after her hopes of a second title were ended in the semi-finals by Russian Svetlana Kuznetsova 6-1, 2-6, 4-6 on Friday. 

Limping between points in the third set due to a hip injury suffered in practice, Davenport?s 22-match winning streak came to an end on Arthur Ashe Court, but the 28-year-old American said she would not be making hasty decisions about her future. 

?I?m just going to see how I feel in the next few weeks and how my body feels and mentally how I feel and what my motivation is,? she told reporters on Friday. 

?It?s really (too) soon to say (if she?ll return to the US Open). Twelve months is really far. 

?It?s been a wonderful last few months, and I?ve enjoyed competing very well. Something like this happens to everybody in all sports and I?ve overcome many injuries, so this isn?t going to be like the nail in the coffin. 

?I don?t need surgery and I don?t have to be out for months and months. 

?I was excited to play this summer and play here. I thought I had a great opportunity. If I feel like I have a great opportunity and can challenge for the title in Australia, I?ll go. If I feel like, ?okay, maybe not totally into it,? it?s going to be tough.? 

Having struggled with injuries since her last appearance in a Grand Slam final, at the 2000 US Open when she lost to Venus Williams, Davenport reached the Wimbledon semi-finals before embarking on a 17-match winning streak to take titles in Stanford, Los Angeles, San Diego and Cincinnati. 

After reaching the semi-finals at Flushing Meadow without losing a set, Davenport looked on course for a place in the final when she cruised through the first set against Kuznetsova in just 23 minutes. 

The Russian lifted her game to level the match, though, and as Davenport?s mobility worsened in the third set, the Russian came from 0-3 down to reach her first Grand Slam final. 

?I?m fine with losing, it?s not the losing part,? Davenport said. ?I just wish that I had lost because, you know, I was terrible or I didn?t play well and she played great. 

?I?m just disappointed that I didn?t get the opportunity to either win or lose at 100 per cent. I was thinking, ?well, maybe it?s going to keep going well.? But eventually, my body just didn?t handle it.? 

Davenport admitted that her improved form made it tough to consider retirement right now. 

?I feel a lot better about myself this year than I did last year at this time when I felt like I was, you know, barely hanging on, lucky to get to the semis. Now I feel like I could have won here. It?s a lot different. 

?It would be tough to walk away knowing that, ?Oh, I still could have won a Slam? or, ?I was still at the top. I was ranked 2, 3 or whatever.? That probably makes it a little bit more challenging of a decision.?

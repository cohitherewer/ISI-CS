 ?5 opportunities to impress?

 Vaughan is clear on where the team should concentrate 

Windhoek: England captain Michael Vaughan considers his team?s tour to Zimbabwe as ?five opportunities to impress on the field,? he told reporters Saturday. 

The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) had come under fire to scrap the five one-dayers because of the political situation in the troubled African country and a dispute between top players and the Zimbabwe Cricket Union. 

England strike bowler Steve Harmison opted out of the tour on moral grounds. 

Vaughan said his players had not discussed the Zimbabwe issue among themselves and hoped his players would not have to deal with political issues in public. ?There hasn?t been a mention of it at all, we?ve just been working hard on our fitness,? he said. ?We?re not particularly looking forward to it, but it?s five opportunities to impress on the field.? 

England play two warm-up matches against Namibia Sunday and Tuesday to prepare for the Zimbabwe tour starting later this month. 

?If I?m being asked questions that deal with matters other than cricket, then it?s not a normal tour but I want the guys to concentrate on the cricket, it?s crucial that they focus on winning matches,? Vaughan added. 

Allrounder Andrew Flintoff and opener Marcus Trescothick have been rested from the Zimbabwe tour but the British media has reported that Flintoff would have joined good friend Harmison in boycotting the trip anyway. 

Fast bowler Darren Gough has also been quoted as saying none of the England players wanted to travel. 

Rain in Namibia has hampered England?s preparations, but Vaughan still expects his team to deliver. ?We?ve only had two outdoor practices, so we?re going in slightly rusty,? he said. ?But we?ve got a good young team and I expect them to perform to a decent standard.? (Reuters)

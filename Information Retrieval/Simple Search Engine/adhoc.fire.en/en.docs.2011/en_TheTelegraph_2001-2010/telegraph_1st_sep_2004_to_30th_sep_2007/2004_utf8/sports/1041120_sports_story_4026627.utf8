- Jacob Oram blasts career-best 126 not out

Brisbane: New Zealand took control of the first Test against Australia on Friday after Jacob Oram scored an unbeaten century and the bowlers ripped through the Australian top-order. 

Oram blasted a career-best 126 not out to help the Black Caps amass a healthy first innings total of 353. 

The New Zealand bowlers then reduced the world champions to 197 for four in reply, 156 in arrears when stumps were drawn early on Day II because of fading light. 

Damien Martyn, named Player of the Series in Australia?s recent tour of India, continued his good form with an unbeaten 59, while new sensation Michael Clarke was batting on 31. 

The Australians still have Adam Gilchrist to come on a Gabba pitch favouring the batsmen but have already lost Matthew Hayden (8), Justin Langer (34), Ricky Ponting (51) and Darren Lehmann (8). 

Hayden was given out leg-before to a ball that hit him above the knee roll but Langer and Ponting steadied the ship with a second-wicket stand of 69, before Langer was struck on the pads by left-arm spinner Daniel Vettori for 34. 

Ponting was unusually hesitant in the initial stages of his knock, but slowly grew in confidence and brought up his half-century with a straight drive for four off Chris Martin He was caught by Nathan Astle at square leg next ball. 

Australia slumped to 128 for four when Lehmann top-edged Vettori to wicketkeeper Brendon McCullum but Martyn and Clarke came to the rescue with an unbroken partnership of 69 at almost a run per minute. 

Earlier, Oram staged his own rescue mission to complete his second Test century, cracking 12 fours and three sixes to eclipse the unbeaten 119 he made against South Africa earlier this year. 

?It?s only my second Test century but this one means a lot more to me. It was against Australia, the best team in the world, in their backyard and also the time I went into the wicket,? the giant allrounder said. ?We were in a spot of bother when I came in so to play a leading hand in turning the ship around was very special to me.? 

He was well supported by Mills, who chipped in with a gritty 29, and last man Chris Martin, who failed to score but batted for half an hour to allow Oram to go from 92 to 126 not out. 

The Black Caps resumed on 250 for seven and their hopes of making 300 seemed doomed when they lost Vettori for 21 with the total on 264, edging fast bowler Michael Kasprowicz to Shane Warne at first slip before the tail wagged again. 

Warne eventually removed Mills and Martin to share bowling honours with Kasprowicz, both men taking four wickets, though the damage had already been done.

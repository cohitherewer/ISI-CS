The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Rohan ready for Pak test

 - ?For me, every match is a big game? 

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI 

Birmingham: ?For me, every match is a big game... Every match is like a World Cup final... So, it?s not that Sunday?s game against Pakistan is going to be different for me. Moreover, there?s no point inviting extra pressure,? remarked Rohan Gavaskar. 

Rohan, who will return to the XI after two matches, told The Telegraph that while he hasn?t won a game for Team India, he has often taken guard in choking conditions. In other words, weighed down by a big ask. 

Speaking at the Crowne Plaza on Saturday, the Bengal captain said: ?I?m not making an excuse but, more than once, I?ve been pitchforked into the toughest of situations...? 

Rohan added: ?Of course, I?ve been trying my hardest and, hopefully, the day isn?t far off when I can play a leading hand in the side?s victory.? 

The 28-year-old, who made the Champions Trophy XIV as Sachin Tendulkar?s replacement, has played ten ODIs with a batting average of a shade over 19. His highest remains the 54 versus Zimbabwe in last season?s tri-series Down Under. 

 Warwicks keen on Harbhajan 

Meanwhile, Harbhajan Singh has been approached by Warwickshire to play as one of the overseas pros next summer. The offie, though, is going to accept the offer only if it pertains to the second half. ?The entire season with any County is out,? he informed late on Saturday.

 Murali bender to Lee, Gillespie

Melbourne: Sri Lankan spinner Muttiah Muralidharan, who previously accused Glenn McGrath of bending his arm beyond the limit allowed under current ICC regulations, has now also named Australia?s Brett Lee and Jason Gillespie in that list. 

Cricket Australia (CA), however, shot back saying it was a ?gross distortion? to label the trio as ?chuckers? based on the ICC report. 

Muralidharan, who endured controversy over his bowling action throughout his 532-Test wicket career, on Monday said the Australian trio of Glenn McGrath, Brett Lee and Jason Gillespie were all flexing their arms beyond the legal limit. 

The chucking debate reared its head again last week when proposed changes in rules going before the International Cricket Council (ICC) for consideration next February were seen as allowing Muralidharan to resume bowling his controversial doosra. 

Muralidharan, who is recovering from shoulder surgery, believes 99 per cent of bowlers are chucking, including McGrath, Lee and Gillespie. 

The Lankan off-spinner said almost all bowlers flexed their arms, including the Australians. 

?McGrath is flexing about 13 (degrees), Gillespie about 12 and Brett Lee about 14 or 15, so what about them then, the Australian players?? Muralidharan said in a radio interview. ?What about other international players?? 

Muralidharan?s accusations, meanwhile, has been countered by CA. ?It is unfair on individual players for their names to be used in emotional public debate which does not take account of the complex science behind what the ICC is examining,? CA chief executive James Sutherland said in a statement on Monday. 

?In standing behind the good name of current players such as McGrath, Gillespie and Lee, and former Australian players who have picked up newspapers to read their names in this current debate, CA calls on all observers to examine the detail of the ICC?s draft findings. 

?This includes the ICC?s own comment that it is false to suggest its expert bowling panel?s work has labelled a number of great bowlers as ?chuckers,? the statement read.

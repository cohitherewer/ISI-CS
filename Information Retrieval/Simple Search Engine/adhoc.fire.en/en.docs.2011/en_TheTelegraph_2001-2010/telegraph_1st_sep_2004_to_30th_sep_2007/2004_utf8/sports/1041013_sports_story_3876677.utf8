 Indians inspired by Armstrong 

Chennai: The hosts? determination to bounce back from their huge first Test defeat in Bangalore was evident when Team India skipper Sourav Ganguly said Tuesday that the team members were seeking inspiration from cyclist Lance Armstrong, who overcame cancer to win the Tour de France title six times. 

It was a full and fiesty demo with Sourav wanting his teammates, who watched a documentary on Armstrong on Monday, to imbibe the fighting spirit of the cyclist in the remaining matches of the series. 

?Few sportsmen inspire as much as the great man. His determination and single-minded devotion to his sport is what anyone would want to emulate,? Sourav said. 

Sourav is looking to his batsmen to rise to the occasion if the hosts hoped to square the four-match series with Australia. 

?We lost the first Test by the third day when we were bowled out for 246 and gave Australia a lead of over 200 runs. I am convinced that if we can put up runs on the board we will do it,? Sourav said. 

?The wickets for the remaining three Tests will have more bounce than the Bangalore track and that will help our spinners. I think the bowlers did well, it is now the turn of the batsmen to deliver.? 

Sourav said India still could make a comeback and win the series. ?We have done it before and I am sure we will do it again.? (PTI)

 Real Madrid face elimination

 Zinedine Zidane is likely to play versus AS Roma 

London: Nine-time European Cup champions Real Madrid have dominated the continental competition since it was devised 50 years ago. On Wednesday, they could be eliminated from the Champions League in the eerie atmosphere of an empty stadium. 

In their final group match, the Spanish giants will try to beat hosts AS Roma with not a single fan in Rome?s Olympic Stadium to see the ?Galaticos? attempt to qualify for the last 16 of the competition. 

That?s not Madrid?s fault. 

Uefa has banned fans from attending Roma?s home games after Swedish referee Anders Frisk was hit on the head by an object thrown from the crowd during a match against Dynamo Kiev. 

But a Madrid loss will mean that the competition?s most fancied club won?t be joining the other powerhouse teams in the second round. 

So far, nine clubs have advanced from the first round, Italian clubs Juventus, AC Milan and Inter Milan, England?s Manchester United and Chelsea, Spain?s FC Barcelona, Germany?s Bayern Munich, France?s Lyon and the Netherlands? PSV Eindhoven. 

While Madrid goes to Rome, Bayer Leverkusen hosts leader Dynamo Kiev in the other group B match. Dynamo leads Leverkusen and Madrid by two points, with Roma in last place and already eliminated. 

Madrid drew 1-1 with Villarreal on Sunday, but hope to use Zinedine Zidane, Luis Figo, Jose Maria ?Guti? Gutierrez, Raul Gonzalez and Roberto Carlos, who were either injured, suspended or rested. 

?We know we?re playing for our lives and we have to win,? said Madrid?s Argentine defender Walter Samuel, who used to play for Roma. ?This is the only result that will assure qualification, because if we draw we will have to wait and see what happens in the other game. (AP)

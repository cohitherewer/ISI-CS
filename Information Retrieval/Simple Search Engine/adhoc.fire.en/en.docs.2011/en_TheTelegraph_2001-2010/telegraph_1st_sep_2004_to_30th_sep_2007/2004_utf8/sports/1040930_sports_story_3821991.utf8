The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Mohun Bagan to go all out vs Myanmar today

 - IFA SHIELD 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: East Bengal and Mohun Bagan fans will miss watching action on giant screens at the Salt Lake Stadium if the two teams clash in the semi-final or final of the IFA Shield, Indian Football Association (IFA) secretary Subrata Dutta informed during the managers? meeting for the 110th IFA Shield on Wednesday. 

The secretary said security concerns have forced the IFA not to use the giant screens during the match of the big two. 

Meanwhile, defending champions Mohun Bagan will take on Myanmar Finance amp; Revenue Football Club in the opening match of the Shield on Thursday. 

The manager of the Myanmar side, U. Khin Maung Kyaing informed that the squad has nine national team players. The team also has eight players who played for the national team against Mohun Bagan when they visited the neighbouring country recently. Mohun Bagan lost that match 0-4. 

?Mohun Bagan are a good side, a professional team, but they didn?t play well in that match,? Kyaing said. 

The manager, who had a view of the Salt Lake Stadium turf, felt that stadium is better than they have back home. 

Incidentally, the 104-year old Myanmar club had participated in the IFA Shield way back in 1929 and had finished runners-up. They are defending league champions in their country. 

Mohun Bagan, back in the city after their residential camp in Kalyani would hope to make good use of the familiar terrain. Coach Subrata Bhattacharya, when asked about the defeat to the Myanmar national side said, ?That time we did not have nine of our regular players. We will definitely go all out for a win on Thursday.? 

The coach added that they have had a satisfactory stint at the camp. However, the players were a bit peeved that the league and Shield have got entwined. The players had a workout Wednesday evening as well before leaving for the city.

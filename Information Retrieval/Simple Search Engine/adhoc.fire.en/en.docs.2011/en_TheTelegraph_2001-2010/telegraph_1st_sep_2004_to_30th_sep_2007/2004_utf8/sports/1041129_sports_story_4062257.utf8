The Telegraph - Calcutta

 I?m always hungry... Always aiming for excellence: Kumble

 - ?I?ve made the most of the ups and that has taken care of the times I haven?t done well? 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: Anil Kumble is only the second bowler, after Jim Laker, to bag all ten wickets in a Test innings, but the hot-shot leggie himself rates his six for 53 in the second innings of the Wanderers Test (1992-93) as his most satisfying performance. Unusual but, then, the 34-year-old has never answered to a stereotype. Kumble, who spoke to The Telegraph in the lead-up to the ongoing Test, is four short of equalling Kapil Dev?s India-record of 434 wickets. 

The following are excerpts 

On his 15th year in the big league 

It?s probably cliched, but playing for India remains the biggest motivation... The enjoyment is there too... Enjoyment, in fact, makes it easier. 

On what he has learnt most in the past decade-and-half 

To be patient... To always believe in my own ability... To not get affected by the opinion of others... To be aware of what my strengths are. (After a pause) Besides knowing what you?re capable of, you should be able to minimise weaknesses. 

On staying rock-like mentally 

(Grins) I just try and keep the negative thoughts away... 

On how best to handle pressure 

Follow the normal routine and don?t think too much. Most important, keep things simple... That will allow the rest to fall into place. 

On how much of cricket is actually mental 

Most of it... It?s the mental make-up and attitude which shapes the career. 

On criticism 

One must learn from whatever is constructive... Sometimes, though, you need to block some of the criticism... (After a pause) Often, people have said I?m a matchwinner just at home. Well, at least I get the credit somewhere. 

On coming through the tougher periods 

I?ve made the most of the ups and that has taken care of the times I haven?t done well... During the downs, I?ve tried to keep the motivation level high, tried to be as disciplined... Gone about the same routine. (After a pause) I?ve accepted failures as simply that and looked ahead. 

On whether the shoulder surgery (January 2001) made him feel insecure 

It took me three months to lift my (right) hand and, so, plenty of doubts did surface... Of course, I got immense support from the family and friends... Indeed, it?s then I got to know who were really close... As I?d pointed out, that Sri (Jawagal Srinath) could make a successful comeback after surgery was inspirational. One can?t, perhaps, bowl the same way but one should be effective. The action, for example, keeps evolving... It changes... However, what counts is being effective... I went through a difficult period, but remained confident. 

On whether there?s a difference in his preparation (Tests vis-a-vis ODIs) 

The basics don?t change, no. 

On whether, having missed the last home series against Australia (owing to surgery), he was more hungry on their recent visit 

I?m always hungry... Always looking to improve... Always aiming for excellence... One sets goals and I?m happy at the way I bowled... The first Test (on home turf Bangalore) was crucial and getting wickets (five) helped. 

On whether any lesson learnt in the last series (2003-04 in Australia) came in handy 

Handy or not, we learnt that scoring even 705 (for seven declared), as we did in Sydney, doesn?t guarantee victory... (After a pause) Australia did well in Sri Lanka, earlier this year, and that lifted their confidence for the series in India. We needed to constantly keep them under pressure... Needed to make them work hard for every run. 

[Kumble, by the way, took 51 wickets in the last two series versus Australia.] 

On the manner cricket has evolved since his India debut 

Batting styles have changed... Fielding has improved... Wickets have got better and, nowadays, draws are few and far between. In fact, around 90 per cent of Tests produce a decisive result. 

On whether there?s a challenge confronting cricket 

Every sport faces challenges... Cricket, though, is being handled pretty well with more and more countries playing the game... Today, there are opportunities for the lesser teams and the onus is on them to make the most of the exposure. Having said that, domestic cricket is the key and the effort must be to make that strong. 

On whether he is driven by records 

Unfortunately, cricketers are only judged by statistics... I accept statistics do give an insight into how good a player one is, but that shouldn?t be the sole yardstick. 

On occasionally having to sit out in the ODIs 

It?s disappointing, but not my call... It?s not in my hands to pick the XI ? giving hundred per cent is. 

On the role spinners can play in ODIs 

Huge, with the change in pace probably making the biggest difference. My view is that spinners are going to continue playing a significant hand. 

On Sourav Ganguly telling The Telegraph that excluding him has always been the most difficult decision to make 

(After a pause) It?s not for me to make a comment... But, yes, it would be nice if both Bhajji (Harbhajan Singh) and I could (always) play together... 

Finally, what must young cricketers not do 

Ignore studies... Education, after all, has helped me deal with success and failure... Moreover, it has allowed a holistic view ? both of cricket and life itself.

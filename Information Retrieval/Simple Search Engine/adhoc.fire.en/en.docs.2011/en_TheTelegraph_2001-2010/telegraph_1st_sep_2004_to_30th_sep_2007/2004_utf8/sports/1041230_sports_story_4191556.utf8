Melbourne: Matthew Hayden and captain Ricky Ponting scored unbeaten half-centuries to guide Australia to a nine-wicket win over Pakistan in the second Test and a record fifth series win of 2004. 

Glenn McGrath and Shane Warne combined to take seven wickets in Pakistan?s second innings of 163, which left the home side chasing 126 to win. 

Australia started their innings shortly before lunch on Day 4, losing Justin Langer for five in the second over, caught-behind off Mohammed Sami. 

Hayden (56 not out) and Ponting (62 not out) added 116 in 102 minutes for the second wicket against an injury-depleted Pakistan attack as Australia reached 127 for one. 

Ponting clubbed leg-spinner Danish Kaneria over long-on for six to hit the winning runs in the 28th over. 

Australia, who won the first Test in Perth by 491 runs, hold an unbeatable 2-0 lead in the three-match series. The final Test starts in Sydney on Sunday. 

The home side had claimed a first innings lead of 38 with their total of 379 at the MCG, led by Man-of-the-Match Damien Martyn?s 142. 

Top-ranked Australia beat Sri Lanka 3-0 and 1-0 in March and July before claiming a 2-1 win in India in October-November for their first series victory there for 35 years. Ponting?s side also crushed New Zealand 2-0 in Brisbane and Adelaide last month. 

Ponting was delighted that his players achieved the win, especially since Pakistan had held the upper hand over the first two days of play. 

With Pakistan chalking up 341 in their first innings, the hosts had appeared to be in trouble when they were reduced to 203 for five. 

?When we have got into trouble we tend to play our best cricket and we did that yesterday. Damien Martyn?s innings was outstanding,? Ponting said. 

?We bowled extremely well and did what we had to do with the bat this afternoon. 

?It?s another great win for us, another great series win. This side keeps rolling along and breaking records so it?s a great team to be part of at the moment.? 

Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer said he hoped to regain injured captain Inzamam-ul-Haq for the Sydney Test but the touring side would be without Sami (bruised heel), Abdul Razzaq (dizziness) and Shoaib Malik (hand injury). 

?For two-and-a-half days, we were really competitive. In the first innings we (only) had three bowlers (with Razzaq in hospital following dizzy spells),? said Woolmer, adding Sami had bowled in pain during Australia?s second innings but would need two weeks of rest. 

?I take a lot of positives out of this game. It was a tremendously better result than Perth and we need to maintain the upward curve and learn how to play against teams like Australia.? 

Pakistan had resumed their second innings on 85 for five with an overall lead of 47 runs on Wednesday. 

Sami (11) fell leg-before to Jason Gillespie and wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal failed to settle as he was out for a duck to leave the visitors on 101 for seven. 

Allrounder Malik scored a courageous 41 with four fours and two sixes, despite a split webbing in his right hand. 

Malik?s knock came to an end when he misjudged a delivery from Warne (three for 66) and was caught at mid-on, lifting the world record-holder?s tally to 561 victims. 

In the following over McGrath (four for 35) struck with his second ball of the day, removing Razzaq for 19, and four overs later bowled Shoaib Akhtar for 14 to end the innings.

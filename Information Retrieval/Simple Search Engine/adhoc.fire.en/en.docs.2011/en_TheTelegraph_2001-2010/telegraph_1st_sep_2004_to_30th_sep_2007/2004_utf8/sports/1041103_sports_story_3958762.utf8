 Paddlers to tour Europe 

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: The Table Tennis Federation of India (TTFI) has organised European tours for senior players this month. While the Soumyadeep Roys and S. Ramans will leave for the Austrian and German Opens next week, a women?s team will embark on a pro-cum training tour in Europe at the month-end. 

The TTFI vice-president Prabir Mitra, when contacted on Tuesday, however said that the list of the players, to be on the tour, is yet to be finalised. 

This, however, means the state championship, to be held at the Netaji Indoor Stadium, may see absence of some stars. It will be held from November 12-16. A number of leading players from the state will also be seen in action in the inter-district meet, to be held at Naihati from November 21-22. North 24 Parganas Table Tennis Association is organising the meet. 

Meanwhile, Mitra said that the decision of setting up the National Academy for the paddlers here and four other zonal academies will come up for discussion in a TTFI meeting early next year. Kamlesh Mehta as the national coach will also be discussed. 

?All this is already in the pipeline and a final decision is expected early next year,? Mitra said.

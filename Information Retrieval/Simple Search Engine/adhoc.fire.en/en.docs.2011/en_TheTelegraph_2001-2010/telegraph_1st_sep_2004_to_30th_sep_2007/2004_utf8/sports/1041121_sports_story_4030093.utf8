The Telegraph - Calcutta

 India series acid test for Jennings

 - Hunt for full-time SA coach begins next month 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Kanpur: Come next month and the United Cricket Board of South Africa (UCBSA) will advertise internationally, as is fashionable nowadays, for Eric Simons? full-time successor as coach. 

For now, of course, the job is being done by former wicketkeeper Ray Jennings. In fact, he?s going to stay till next May, when the tour of the West Indies ends. 

According to a source in the UCBSA, Jennings too is eligible to apply. 

?Depending largely on how this visit goes, as also the home series versus England, Jennings will either be strongly or poorly placed...? the source told The Telegraph on Saturday afternoon. 

Jennings, known as a go-getting coach at the provincial level, is a selector as well. 

The series against England (five Tests, seven ODIs) is going to be followed by two Tests and three ODIs versus Zimbabwe, again at home, and the trip to the West Indies (four Tests, five ODIs). 

Despite an excellent rapport with captain Graeme Smith, Simons ? who succeeded Graham Ford in mid-2002 ? quit recently as he ?wasn?t getting the entire team?s support.? 

The source added: ?Actually, a bit of frustration crept in and Simons probably thought fresh ideas were needed... It?s difficult for a coach to continue if...? 

Meanwhile, UCBSA president Ray Mali may visit Calcutta during the second (and last) Test there, from November 28. The chief executive, Gerald Majola, is already here for Test No. 1. 

Indeed, it has become a tradition for the UCBSA to be represented by a key official on every tour. Dr Ali Bacher, the former managing director, started it in 1991-92, when South Africa?s pariah status ended. That continues. 

Incidentally, chief selector (or convenor of selectors) Omar Henry is also around.

London: London: Andrew Symonds crafted an unbeaten century and Michael Kasprowicz took five wickets to give Australia a 10-run win over Pakistan in a one-day International at Lords on Saturday. 

Pakistan were bowled out for 259 with 10 balls remaining in a tense finish, Kasprowicz grabbing five for 47. 

Yousuf Youhana struck 88 and captain Inzamam-ul-Haq made 72. Together they kept Pakistan in the hunt, but both were caught by Shane Watson to effectively seal the fate of the match. 

Dangerman Abdul Razzaq was caught-and-bowled by Kasprowicz. The seamer then sealed the win by clattering Mohammad Samis furniture. 

Symonds earlier smashed 104 in 103 balls, his second one-day hundred, to lead Australia to 269 for six after Pakistans attack had threatened to peg back the world champions. 

However, the right hander was dropped on 24 and 82 by Rana Naveed-ul-Hasan and Youhana both in the deep with Pakistan looking poor in the field. 

It got a lot closer than we thought but we hung in there and took a couple of crucial wickets, Australian captain Ricky Ponting said. Andrew Symonds played beautifully and made a sensational hundred. 

Michael Clarke also struck 31 in a 88-run stand with Symonds but skied Shoaib Akhtar to Shoaib Malik three overs from the end. 

Wicketkeeper Brad Haddin, deputising for Adam Gilchrist, opened and made 13 before he looped a simple ball off Sami to Malik at short cover. 

Paceman Sami then trapped Ponting for four before Damien Martyn (26) joined Matthew Hayden (52) to push Australia on. 

Darren Lehmann was run out for nine backing up when bowler Malik diverted Symonds straight drive on to the stumps. 

Australia rested Glenn McGrath for the one-off game in preparation for next weeks ICC Champions Trophy. Gilchrist will also return to the side for the 12-team tournament after his wife recently gave birth. 

Andrew Symonds crafted an unbeaten 104 and Michael Kasprowicz grabbed five wickets to script a 10-run victory for Australia against Pakistan in an one-day International at Lords on Saturday. 

Australia posted 269 for six thanks in part to some poor Pakistan fielding with Rana Naveed-ul-Hasan and Yousuf Youhana both dropping Symonds in the deep. 

Youhana atoned with 88 in a 162-run stand with captain Inzamam-ul Haq (72) but Pakistan were bowled out for 259 with 10 balls remaining, Kasprowicz taking five for 47. 

The world champions rested Glenn McGrath for the one-off game in preparation for the ICC Champions Trophy, which starts in England next Friday. 

This was Symonds second ODI century. 

Australia were 148 for five off 34 overs when Symonds and Michael Clarke, who made a run-a-ball 31, came together and put on 88 to revive the innings. 

Symonds led an onslaught that saw 50 runs come off the last five overs. 

He was particularly severe on Shoaib Akhtar, the Rawalpindi Express seeing his eight overs cost 70 runs. 

Earlier, Mohammed Sami, with the ground bathed in sunshine, struck twice in a spell of two wickets for three runs in 10 balls to leave Australia 30 for two. 

Hayden looked out of touch early on but pressed on to a 78-ball fifty with six fours. 

But on the left-hander, playing forward to leg-spinner Shahid Afridis fourth ball, got a faint inside edge and was bowled to leave Australia 99 for three in the 21st over. 

And 10 runs later Damien Martyn (26) dragged a drive against off-spinner Malik to Imran Farhat at short mid-on. 

Martyns exit brought in Symonds for what turned out to be a second rescue mission against Pakistan. In Johannesburg last year Australia were 86 for four when Symonds came to the crease and unleashed his whirlwind century. 

But he should have been out when Rana Naveed, sliding in on his knees from long-on, failed to hold a catch off Malik. 

But four balls later the bowler ran out Darren Lehmann (nine), backing-up, when after fielding a Symonds drive his back-flick throw hit the stumps. 

Clarke went when his skied hook off Akhtar was well caught at mid-on by Malik before Symonds cut to third man off the same bowler was dropped by Yousuf Youhana. 

Symonds then hooked the first ball off the last over, from Akhtar, for six and two balls later stepped outside his leg-stump to cut a four to go to 99 before a two took him to his hundred.

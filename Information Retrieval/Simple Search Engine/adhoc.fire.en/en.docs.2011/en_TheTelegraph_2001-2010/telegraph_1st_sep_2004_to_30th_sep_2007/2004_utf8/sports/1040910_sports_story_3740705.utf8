The Telegraph - Calcutta

 US hope to put up good show

 - TIE vs NEW ZEALAND 

London: Defeats in cricket matches are sometimes labelled a ?tragedy? for the losing team; really heavy reverses may even be called a ?massacre?. 

But Richard Staple, the captain of a US team that is predicted to go down to a series of one-sided losses in the ICC Champions Trophy, knows better than most the ultimate unimportance of any cricket match. Three years ago he was in his New York office, only one block away from the World Trade Center, when the first plane struck in the September 11 attacks. 

And as he made his way towards the twin towers he witnessed the second plane collide in an incident that saw his friend Nizam Hafiz, a former US cricketer, among those killed. 

?I was there when it happened and I spoke to one of my friends just before who was one of the USA team and who died there,? Staple said on Thursday at the Metropolitan Police Sports Ground. 

?It certainly puts cricket into context. I was asked how facing Brett Lee would compare to a situation like that and there is no comparison. That was a question of life and death.? 

The US begin their Champions Trophy campaign against New Zealand at The Oval on Friday, a day before the third anniversary of the attack. 

But off-spinner Staple, who has played first-class cricket for his native Jamaica, insisted his team was looking forward to taking part. 

 ?We are privileged to be here, so we will give it our best and hopefully we?ll come away with some positives. I?ve played for Jamaica for five years, so hopefully between myself and Clayton Lambert we can help the team come together in this tournament.? 

Former West Indies batsman Lambert, now 42, made his name during England?s tour of the Caribbean in 1997-98 where, alongside Philo Wallace, he repeatedly savaged Mike Atherton?s attack.

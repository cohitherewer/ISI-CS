 A sweet moment in time for Pierce

New York: They were 78 feet and a generation apart. On one end of the Arthur Ashe Stadium court stood Maria Sharapova, the 17-year-old Wimbledon champion with a future as bright as her usual smile. On the other end was 29-year-old Mary Pierce, a former major tournament winner whose smile told you that she still had a future. 

Sharapovas shoulders were slumped and she wiped her brow, her brilliant summer having come to an end. Pierce pumped her fist and flashed a set of pearly white teeth, the unmistakable gestures of victory. 

Pierce, the 27thseed, ousted Sharapova, the seventh, from the US Open on Saturday with a 4-6, 6-2, 6-3 victory, one that is especially sweet considering it comes so late in a career that has had its share of turmoil and triumph. It is why, as she reached her chair, she kneeled and said a prayer. 

After everything Ive been through, and the last few years have been really difficult, those moments just are a lot sweeter and mean a lot more to me, Pierce said. I love what I do so much more now than I did before, and I just appreciate it so much more. 

In a way, Pierce was Sharapova once, a tall teen armed with a big serve, heavy ground strokes and great expectations. Though Sharapovas sudden march to a victory at Wimbledon was unexpected, she clearly was on the rise. 

It took Pierce longer to get where she was going, and she had to navigate amaze of domestic strife with a father, Jim, who could be abusive. But she managed to overcome the off-court troubles with a victory in the 1995 Australian Open and a very precious win in the 2000 French Open at Roland Garros. She holds American and French citizenships. 

But from 2000 until Saturday was an eternity for Pierce. She lost nearly the whole of 2001 to a lumbar spine inflammation that cast doubt on whether her career would continue. Finally overcoming the pain in her back, she played a little more than half of the 2002 season until an abdominal strain ended it. Her 2003 year was unspectacular, but she was at least playing again. Then this year, for the first time in more than four years, she won a tournament at Hertogenbosch. 

Its also nice because I believe in myself and its nice to have that confirmation actually happen in reality, Pierce said. 

Sharapova, who double-faulted 14 times, wont let this loss diminish all that shes accomplished, and she also saw it in the light of the terrorist attack on a school in her native Russia that left hundreds dead. She wore a black ribbon on her silver tennis dress to honour the victims. In Russia, it is terrible whats going on, she said. First of September is when so many kids go to school. They go in with the flowers and the whole family. All of the kids and the teachers have this big party. 

Unfortunately, the terrorists decided to do something bad with those families and kids. Whats going on in the world today, my loss, you know, its a little thing.

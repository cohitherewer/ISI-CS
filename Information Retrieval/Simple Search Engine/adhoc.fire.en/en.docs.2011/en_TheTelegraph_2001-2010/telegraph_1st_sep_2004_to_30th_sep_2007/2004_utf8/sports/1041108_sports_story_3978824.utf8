The Telegraph - Calcutta

Thankfully, Mumbai Test wasn?t a decider

 Dinesh Karthiks super cool debut cant 

be overlooked

Australians of all types loved it, I even had text 

messages from people renewing their faith in Test cricket because for two days 

they could not leave their seats or cars wherever they were witnessing the gripping 

spectacle which was the fourth Test.

However, if I wanted to see a two-day hit and giggle, 

I would rather watch 22 low grade clubbies go round the local park. I simply can?t 

come to grips with the fact that one of the world?s best stadiums resembled that 

very park which could not even be trusted by the amateurs.

Players who have participated at this level know that 

this was a stuff of the highest order and thankfully the fourth Test wasn?t a 

decider.

India fought back well not only from the series loss 

but also a tough first innings batting and finally threw the shackles away to 

play reasonably naturally. Laxman and Tendulkar took control of the high class 

Aussies for just long enough in the second innings.

If ever the Indian team are to be world class they 

must learn to play like this when a win is crucial, especially against the champs. 

They can start again now against the South Africans in a bid to become better 

cricketers. 

I was part of the Australian team which won a dead 

Test against the champion West Indies in 1991 and grew enormously in confidence 

from there on. We competed much better in the next series two years later at home 

only to lose by one run before finally defeating a rebuilt developing side in 

1995. Continued improvement, especially consistency is paramount now for the Indians, 

if they are to be feared worldwide as a team.

This crunch series at home for India produced turmoil 

in so many different areas and must be addressed for cricket to be successful 

in a world stronghold. Groundsmen being told what to prepare by administrators 

and captain of the home team and not bowing to those requests. The Nagpur wicket, 

which was the greatest source of such controversy, was the best of the series 

which favoured batsmen and bowlers equally .

The final wicket was a disgrace, hopefully because 

of incompetence and not underhandedness. 

The biggest problem for India for this series, however, 

was their injury toll accompanying the lack of batting intent. We have to look 

harder in a low scoring match to discuss good performances but there are plenty 

to highlight from Mumbai. The umpires are the first to rate a mention from me. 

They were decisive in tough circumstances and skilful. Pressure packed decisions 

in low scorers must be nerve-racking but Aleem Dar and Rudi Koertzen impressed. 

The mastery of tough conditions by batsmen was going to be brief and fifties will 

rate highly by the men who scored them.

Remarkably it was Tendulkar, who has picked up fewer 

bats than me in the last months, who found his feet. Martyn for Australia has 

been full of answers to whatever the spinners have tried. 

Murali Kartik will grow from this match. He tried 

different paces, flights and spins superbly and cracked the top order quickly.

No one could overlook the super cool debuts of Dinesh 

Karthik and Nathan Hauritz either. To keep so crisply in such tough conditions 

to the hardest of spinners was spectacular by Karthik. 

It was sparkling and fresh to see some levity behind 

the stumps and he really wanted every ball. He had his helmeted head and eyes 

over everything, even the balls that were full and down legside in the rough. 

Tremendous performance which disguised the fact that it was his first.

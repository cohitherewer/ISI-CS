The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Dhoni in contention

 - TOUR OF BANGLADESH 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Dhoni 

Calcutta: Jharkhand wicketkeeper Mahender Singh Dhoni is very much in contention for a berth when the national selectors choose XVI for the Bangladesh tour ? featuring two Tests and three ODIs. 

According to The Telegraph?s sources, Dhoni (who has been losing out to Dinesh Karthik) has come into the frame as he could also be the one for the specialist keeper?s slot in ODIs. In any case, Karthik hasn?t helped his cause by dropping two catches on the second day of the ongoing Test here. 

Though there was talk that the selection committee meeting ? scheduled for Tuesday ? may be deferred, Board secretary S.K. Nair confirmed it would be on schedule. 

Apparently, opener Dheeraj Subhas Jadhav and middle-order bat Yalaka Venugopal Rao are going to come into the picture as the selectors could be ?advised? to include a few rookies. 

Actually, the selectors (with Kiran More in the chair) should. 

Till late on Monday, none of the seniors had informed the Board about wanting to take a break.

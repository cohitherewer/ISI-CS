The Telegraph - Calcutta

 McGrath back, Kasprowicz rested

Sydney: Australia have recalled fast bowler Glenn McGrath and rested Michael Kasprowicz for Wednesday?s second one-day International with New Zealand. 

McGrath missed Sunday?s series-opener in Melbourne, which New Zealand won by four wickets, but will play in the second match at the Sydney Cricket Ground. 

Australia need to win in Sydney to keep the series alive. The final match of the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy series takes place in Brisbane on Friday. 

The home side looked to be cruising to victory in Melbourne, with New Zealand needing 32 runs from the last 18 balls. 

But the Black Caps suddenly seized control by smashing 22 runs off the third-last over from Kasprowicz to reduce the target to 10 off the last two overs, securing victory with two balls to spare. Chief selector Trevor Hohns said nothing should be read into Kasprowicz?s absence and he expected the big Queenslander to return for the final one-dayer in Brisbane on Friday. 

?The plan was to give him a blow (rest) at this stage come what may,? Hohns said. ?There?s nothing to be read into him missing Sydney. ?Kasprowicz has been an outstanding performer over the last 12 months and he went for a few runs in one over in a one-day game and that can happen to anybody at anytime,? Hohns said. (Agencies)

 Rio de Janeiro: Romario has denied he was quitting soccer, a day after Brazilian media reported that he was retiring, local news agencies said.

 ?I?m not quitting,? Romario said Wednesday.

 On Tuesday, the 38-year-old striker was quoted by O Globo news agency as saying he ?can?t do it anymore.?

 Romario also said he planned to play one final game to say farewell to fans at the Maracana Stadium some time in the second half of 2005. But on Wednesday he clarified his comments. ?I said I was more or less without desire, but that doesn?t mean I am quitting,? he said, reported Agencia Folha.

 ?I have the physical and technical conditions to play at least one more year,? Romario said, adding he wanted to dispute the Rio de Janeiro state championship for Vasco, where he began his career. 

 Tokyo: The second leg of a Tiger Cup semi-final has been postponed after the weekend?s deadly Asian tsunami, South-east Asian soccer officials said on Thursday. Malaysia and Indonesia, both hit by the devastating tidal waves that swept the Indian Ocean on Sunday, were scheduled to meet in Kuala Lumpur on New Year?s Day. However, the match will now be played 48 hours later, on Monday, as a mark of respect for the victims following a plea from Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi. Malaysia lead Indonesia 2-1 after the first leg.

 Dubai: Prize money for next year?s Dubai Desert Classic has been increased to a record $2.2 million, organisers said on Wednesday.

 The European Tour event, which this year attracted a strong field including Tiger Woods and twice winner Ernie Els, will be played at the Emirates Golf Club?s Majlis Course from March 3-6 next year.

 ?In recent years, the prize-money fund has increased by more than 35 percent which underlines our commitment to the sport in this part of the world,? M.A. Al Ghurair, managing director of the tournament?s main sponsors, said in a statement.

 South Africa?s world No. 3 Els, the winner in 1994 and 2002, has already confirmed participation.

 Wellington: Former Australian and French Open champion Mary Pierce has pulled out of next week?s Auckland Open, officials said on Thursday.

 Pierce, ranked 29th in the world, was seeded third for the tournament but withdrew because of an undisclosed medical problem.

 Pierce notified tournament officials through her manager but did not indicate whether the injury would force her out of the Australian Open starting in Melbourne on January 17.

 ?Mary?s withdrawal is extremely disappointing however it is a reality in sport at all levels that players do get injured,? tournament director Richard Palmer said. 

 Kozhikode: Shardul Gagre of Maharashtra and B. Prathyusha of Andhra Pradesh lifted the boy?s and girl?s titles, respectively, in the national under-7 chess meet which concluded here on Thursday.

 Prathyusha (8 points) finished half a point ahead of Navya Vyshnavi and J. Sahari.

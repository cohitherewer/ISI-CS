Chennai: The Chennai Test is going to be a humdinger. Indications are already there, if one goes by the early star presence at the Chidambaram Stadium here Monday. 

Both, the Indian team members and the Aussies arrived here for the second Test, but Team India skipper Sourav Ganguly reached way before, in the morning. 

It was no courtesy visit for the skipper, the way he went straight to the ground and was down to business immediately. 

He inspected the pitch and talked to groundsmen, trying to make sure the batting debacle of Bangalore isn?t repeated. 

While the Australians are likely to have their net practice on Tuesday afternoon, India coach John Wright will talk to Sourav before deciding on the practice schedule. 

India are 0-1 down in the four-Test series after losing the first match by 217 runs. 

Sachin Tendulkar, too, injury and all, reached Chennai. The country expects him to be able to play. 

But he will, anyway, be busy off the pitch, soon. 

He will take part in the shooting of a documentary film, scripted and directed by Mani Ratnam, here on Tuesday to promote the cause of the physically challenged. 

The film, being made for city-based Shakthi Foundation which works for the cause of physically challenged and underprivileged sections, seeks to sensitise people on the issue of providing ramps in public places to ensure a barrier-free environment for physically challenged persons. 

?Seeing the struggle of a child in a wheelchair devoid of movement propelled me to want to form a human network strong enough to lobby for ramps,? Tendulkar said in a message. 

He also appealed to fellow citizens to support the foundation in its efforts to help more children come out and live a quality life. (PTI)

 Harikrishna steals show

 Harikrishna defeated Azmaiparashvili 

Pune: P. Harikrishna defeated Zurab Azmaiparashvili of Georgia in the second round of the category 16 Super GMs tournament in the Pune International chess festival here on Saturday. 

After the first two games of this nine round event, Harikrishna, Sutovsky, world champion Rustam Kasimdzhanov of Uzbekistan and Sandipan Chanda are in lead with 1.5 points, followed by top seed Liviu-Dieter Nisipeanu of Romania, K. Sasikiran and Zurab who all have one point apiece. 

On a day that witnessed mixed results for the Indian hopefuls yet again, GM Emil Sutovsky proved why he is rated as a ferocious player. The Israeli outwitted former British champion GM Abhijit Kunte to be among early leaders. 

Another half point adrift are Surya Shekhar Ganguly and Alexander Beliavsky of Slovenia while Kunte is yet to open his account. 

Sutovsky, the former world junior champion showcased his class as he crashed through the defences of Kunte from a Sicilian defence wherein the Indian played black. 

The other games of the day were all drawn. Kasimdzhanovs wounds took a quick draw with Sasikiran who had beaten him in their last encounter just a few days before at The Netherlands. 

Chanda faced the Sicilian Sveshnikov by city-mate Surya Sekhar and got nothing out of the opening. The truce was agreed to in just 21 moves. 

Nisipeanu tried to make a foray in the solid defences of Alexander Beliavsky to no avail. (PTI)

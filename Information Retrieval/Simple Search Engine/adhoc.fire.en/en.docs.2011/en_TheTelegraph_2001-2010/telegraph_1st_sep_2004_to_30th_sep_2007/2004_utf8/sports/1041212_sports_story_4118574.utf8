The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Everton beat Liverpool

London: Midfielder Lee Carsley fired Everton to a 1-0 victory over Liverpool and second place in the Premier League in the 200th Merseyside derby on Saturday. 

Carsley steered home a shot from 25 metres after 68 closely-fought minutes at Goodison Park to give the hosts, who were tipped for relegation pre-season, their first win over Liverpool for five years. 

Their seventh 1-0 victory in a remarkable season gave Everton 36 points, two ahead of champions Arsenal, who host league leaders Chelsea (39) on Sunday. Liverpool, who had been hoping to make it a perfect week after booking their place in the Champions League knockout stage on Wednesday, stay seventh on 24 points. (Reuters)

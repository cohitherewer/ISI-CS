 Most bowlers chuck: ICC report 

 - Not since Bodyline has cricket caused so many political sparks to fly

 Even Glenn McGrath bends his arm as much as 12 degrees 

It is bound to have Fred Trueman spluttering in disbelief, but recent research collated by the International Cricket Council (ICC) suggests that 99 per cent of bowlers in history have been chuckers. 

Chucking, as opposed to bowling a cricket ball, has always been an emotive issue within cricket, much to the bemusement of the wider public. Recently, Sri Lanka?s controversial spinner, Muttiah Muralidharan, refused to tour Australia after the country?s Prime Minister, John Howard, an avowed cricket fan, proclaimed his action illegal. 

Not since Bodyline in 1932 has cricket caused so many political sparks to fly. Under the present laws of the game, which state that there should be no straightening or partial straightening of the arm during delivery, Howard?s assessment is undeniably true. But what the ICC?s research can reveal is that Muralidharan, far from being in a minority of law-breakers with his unique action, is actually part of an overwhelming majority at least when scrutinised by scientific instruments rather than the naked eye. 

Ever since Christina Willes first bowled over-arm to her brother John in the early 19th Century, a technique she used to prevent the ball from catching in her skirts, cricketers have been bound by stringent laws designed to keep their bowling actions pure. 

Now it appears that the boffins have discovered even bowlers with textbook actions, such as Glenn McGrath and Shaun Pollock, bend their arms as much as 12 degrees under match conditions. Using data assembled by three leading bio-mechanists, this is the most extensive study yet into bowling actions, as well as its most revealing. But far from providing a charter for chuckers, cameras filming at 250 frames a second (TV cameras shoot at 25) have revealed a complex chain of movements such as adduction and hyperextension, all of which can give the illusion of a bent arm. 

The detection of a kinked elbow with the human eye only happens at around 15 degrees. Anything less requires guesswork. Before the findings, the ICC had introduced tolerance levels five degrees for spinners, seven and a half for medium-pacers and 10 for quick bowlers. That will be extended to 15 degrees whatever speed you bowl at, though it will still be left to umpires and Match Referees to lodge their suspicions in writing to the ICC before anyone is investigated. 

Some things are set to change and those exceeding the new threshold will no longer be under the care of their home board. Instead, their rehabilitation will be the responsibility of a new body, due to be set up by the ICC. Though complex, the scope and thoroughness of ICC?s research is impressive.

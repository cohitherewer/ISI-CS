 Akram advice for Pathan

Bangalore: Former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram has advised Irfan Pathan to concentrate on bowling and not put pressure on himself by trying to be an allrounder. 

Akram said the hectic schedule of modern cricket made being an allrounder almost impossible and the 20-year old Indian should remember that batting was his secondary task. 

?He (Pathan) should know that he is a bowler who can bat. He should concentrate on that,? said Akram who is in the city on a promotional visit. 

?It?s hard work to be an allrounder now as we play so much cricket. Allrounder can sort of, at times, sort of get tired.? 

Akram agreed that there was ?too much hype? about Pathan. ?Yes, this (hype) had to happen?, he said.

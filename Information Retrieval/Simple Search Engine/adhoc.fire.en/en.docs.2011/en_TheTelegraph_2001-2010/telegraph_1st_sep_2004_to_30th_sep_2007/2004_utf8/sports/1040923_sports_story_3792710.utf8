The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Hamilton may be positive

 Gold medallist Tyler Hamilton 

 vows to fight on till the end.

London: Waking up on the morning after he won Olympic gold in Athens, Tyler Hamilton leaped out of bed to check no one had stolen the medal from his suitcase. 

Just five weeks later the American may be forced to hand back that time trial gold if it is confirmed he is the first athlete to fail a doping test for an illegal blood transfusion. 

The 33-year-old protested his ?100 percent innocence? on Tuesday after cycling?s ruling body told him he had failed an initial test during the current Tour of Spain. 

Hamilton said the IOC also said he had fallen foul of a new dope test in Athens. The IOC is yet to make an official statement on Hamilton?s case. If Hamilton also failed the B test, he will be stripped of the gold and face a two-year ban, effectively ending his career. 

?I can guarantee you the gold medal will be staying in my living room until I don?t have a cent left,? Hamilton said on Tuesday. ?I?ve worked hard for it and it?s not going anywhere.?

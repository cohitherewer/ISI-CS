 Big season from Thursday 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: The lush green grass on the winter track resembles a carpet, signalling the resumption of the big season at the RCTC ground. The 30-day cold weather season starts on Thursday. 

 The club officials are bubbling with confidence that the season is going to be a big success. With horse-strength at the Hastings stables shooting up to 350, from a depleted 200-odd during the monsoon season, the club management is expecting everything to fall into place. The figure includes 88 two-year-olds who will make their debut from the middle of November. Add another 25 to the horse-count who may arrive late in November for the season?s plum.

 Understandably, there has not been any increase in the stake-money. About Rs 3.1 crore in stakes offered for the season is almost the same which was paid out last winter. The freeze follows a big investment made by RCTC towards live telecast of city racing and it could take some time before the club reaps the harvest through the new venture. The good news is, most of the RCTC race days would be shown live by almost all outstation turf centres.

 The club has also reduced the race-fixtures to 30 days as against 31 meetings during the 2003-04 season. Again, the good news is that the number of events have been increased to 224 compared to 186 staged last winter. There would be seven or eight-event cards on weekends and holidays to achieve the targeted 224 events. Further, a record 96 trophy events will be held during the season.

 Racing is also expected to be competitive in view of fresh arrivals from the southern and western turf centres. A quick glance at the opening day?s card does suggest so. But trainers Daniel David and Singh-brothers ? Vijay and Bharath ? are the ones to follow. 

 First race starts at 2 pm.

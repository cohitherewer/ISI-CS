 Nine WI players arrive for camp

Bridgetown: West Indies? dissident cricketers began arriving at a training camp in Barbados even as a judge was named to arbitrate their contract dispute with national administrators. 

Most of the victorious Champions Trophy squad, including captain Brian Lara and deputy Ramnaresh Sarwan, were barred from the camp last week when they refused to sign on with the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) because of a conflict over personal endorsements. 

With the tour to Australia jeopardised, the board and the West Indies Players Association agreed through mediation last Friday to reopen the camp to the dissenters, and allow an independent arbitrator to resolve the dispute by December 15, with his decisions binding. 

Lara arrived in Barbados on Sunday, but left for Trinidad again, and was expected to be back soon. 

Courtney Browne, Ian Bradshaw, Pedro Collins and Ryan Hinds arrived on Monday. They were followed by Ricardo Powell, Dwight Washington, Xavier Marshall, Reon King and Narsingh Deonarine. 

The 25 players have till Tuesday to report to the three-week camp. (AP)

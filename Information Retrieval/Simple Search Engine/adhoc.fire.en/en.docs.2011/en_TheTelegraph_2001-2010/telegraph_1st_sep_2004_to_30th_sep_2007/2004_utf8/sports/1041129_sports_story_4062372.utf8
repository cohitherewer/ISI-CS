 Shoaib puts signing on hold

 Woolmer 

Karachi: Pakistan speedster Shoaib Akhtar has refused to sign a central contract with the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) due to concerns over individual sponsorship and commercial contracts. 

The contracts, offered to Pakistan players for the first time, were signed by 14 of the 17-man squad that will tour Australia next month, including captain Inzamam-ul Haq and vice-captain Yousuf Youhana. 

?Shoaib has not signed the contract as yet. He said he wanted the document to be vetted by his legal adviser,? Mushtaq Ahmed, the PCBs general manager of finance said on Sunday. 

Meanwhile, Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer brushed aside previous performances against Australia and said his team could spring a surprise if they played to their potential in the upcoming tour. 

?I don?t really study the past because the past is history and the most important thing is not to look back and be negative,? Woolmer said on Sunday. ?I think that if we play up to our potential we can spring a surprise.? 

?We can?t go there with the thought that other teams are being beaten by Australia and we are the same,? he said.

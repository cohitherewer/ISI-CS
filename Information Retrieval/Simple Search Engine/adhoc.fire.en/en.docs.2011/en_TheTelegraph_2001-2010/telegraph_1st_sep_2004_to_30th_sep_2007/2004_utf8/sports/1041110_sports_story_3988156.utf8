 Holyfield chasing impossible dream

 Holyfield facing uncertain future 

Las Vegas: Evander Holyfield broke camp in Houston, heading toward New York and an uncertain future. 

Holyfield fights on Saturday night at Madison Square Garden for the 48th time in a professional career that began 20 years ago almost to the day. His opponent is the undistinguished Larry Donald, though the name is of little concern to the former four-time heavyweight champion. 

At 42, Holyfield is chasing the impossible dream of becoming the undisputed heavyweight champion once again. His reflexes are suspect, and he took a beating in his last fight, but Holyfield is determined to fight on anyway. 

This time it will be in the unfamiliar role of an undercard fighter, on a night that features heavyweight title bouts between Chris Byrd and Jameel McCline, and between John Ruiz and Andrew Golota. 

And this time it will be without long-time trainer Donald Turner, who made the mistake of waving a white towel to save his fighter from further punishment when James Toney was hitting Holyfield at will when they fought 13 months ago. 

?He thought I was old,? Holyfield said. ?I thought I wasn?t.? 

To the casual observer, Holyfield doesn?t look old. His body is still chiselled, just as it was when he beat Mike Tyson eight years ago in one of the biggest upsets in boxing history. 

But he?s won only two of his last eight fights, and many in boxing wonder why he doesn?t just quit. 

In a heavyweight division lacking big stars, Holyfield might be the biggest name on a card that includes defences from IBF titleholder Byrd and WBA champion Ruiz. But his name is one that lives in the past, bringing back memories of wins over Tyson and wars with Riddick Bowe. 

It could be argued that Holyfield peaked in November 1996, when he stopped Tyson in the 11th round. He hasn?t looked impressive since and seemed to hit bottom in October 2003, when Toney took him apart before knocking him down in the ninth round, and Holyfield?s corner called it quits. 

Plenty of time has passed since that fight, though, and now Holyfield sees it in a different light. He believes he was too aggressive and didn?t pay enough attention to defence, something his new trainer, Ronnie Shields, has been working on with him. 

Even if Holyfield does have something left, and most in boxing feel he doesn?t, his goal of winning the undisputed title again is more of a dream than anything else.

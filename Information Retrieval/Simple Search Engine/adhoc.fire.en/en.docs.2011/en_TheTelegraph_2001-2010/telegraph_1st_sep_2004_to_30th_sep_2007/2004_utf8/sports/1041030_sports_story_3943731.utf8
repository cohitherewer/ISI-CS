Chittagong: Left-arm spinner Daniel Vettori featured in New Zealand?s biggest-ever win in Test cricket as they beat Bangladesh by an innings and 101 runs at the M.A. Aziz Stadium here on Friday. 

Vettori bagged the remaining two wickets as Bangladesh, overnight 210 for eight, were bowled out for 262 early on the fourth day. They were following on after conceding a 363-run first innings lead. 

Vettori grabbed six for 100 in the second innings for his 10th five-wicket effort in Tests following his six for 70 in the first essay. He took his haul to 20 in two Tests and clinched the Man of the Series award. 

But the 25-year-old left-armer was denied registering his Test best by an aggressive Tapash Baisya.

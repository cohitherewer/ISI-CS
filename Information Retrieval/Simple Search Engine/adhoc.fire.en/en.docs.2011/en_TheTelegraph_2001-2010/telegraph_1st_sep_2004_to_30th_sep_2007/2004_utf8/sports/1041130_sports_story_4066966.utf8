Madrid: Real Madrid gave a stunning exhibition of finishing power to crush Levante 5-0 at the Bernabeu in the Primera Liga on Sunday. 

The home side had struggled to impose themselves on their modest opponents for most of the first half, but burst into life two minutes before the break when Ronaldo fired in at the near post after a precision pass from David Beckham. 

Real then put the result beyond doubt with a devastating three-goal salvo at the start of the second half featuring spectacular strikes from Luis Figo and Beckham and a second goal from Ronaldo. Substitute Michael Owen completed the rout three minutes from time. 

The win kept Real in second place, seven points behind leaders Barcelona who claimed a nervous 2-1 win over Getafe on Saturday. Espanyol are in third, a further two points behind and Real Betis moved up to fourth after their 2-1 win at home to Villarreal. 

With Zinedine Zidane missing through a back injury, Real coach Mariano Garcia Remon opted to reshuffle his midfield, switching Beckham to the right, Figo to the left and bringing Albert Celades into the middle. 

The move gave Guti more space in the centre, but Real struggled to manufacture any clear chances in the first half hour. But just as the crowd was getting restless, Ronaldo began the goal spree with a trademark finish in the 43rd minute. 

Beckham wafted a perfectly weighted pass to the edge of the area, the Brazilian controlled with his chest, shook off the attentions of a defender and then fired in at the near post. 

Real then floored their opponents with three goals in the space of five second-half minutes. Figo made it 2-0 when he let fly from 30m out after the Levante defence had backed off when he picked up the ball on the halfway line. 

Levante were still reeling from the blow when Ronaldo hit them again, slotting home from 10m after controlling a pass from Celades with his toe. 

Not to be outdone, Beckham added a third with an action-replay of the Portuguese midfielder?s strike, cutting inside former Leeds United defender Ian Harte before firing into the top of the net from the same distance. 

England teammate Owen, who had replaced Raul midway through the second half, completed the rout three minutes from time with a cool finish after Guti had poked the ball into his path. 

In Italy, Inter Milan fought back from two goals down to draw 2-2 with leaders Juventus in the ?Derby d?Italia? at the San Siro stadium with Brazilian Adriano grabbing an 85th minute equaliser. 

Although Inter maintain their record as the only unbeaten side in Serie A, their 11th draw from 13 matches leaves them down in seventh place still 15 points behind Juventus. 

The happiest team on Sunday were second placed AC Milan who won 1-0 at Chievo with a Hernan Crespo goal and were able to close the gap on Juventus to four points. 

Juventus have 32 points, Milan are on 28 and Udinese, who won 2-1 at Livorno on Saturday, are in third place on 22 points.

 England crush Zimbabwe

London: Paul Collingwood hit an unbeaten 80 before impressing in the field as England cruised to a 152-run win over Zimbabwe in their ICC Champions Trophy match at Edgbaston on Saturday. 

The game was held over after rain disrupted play on Friday but England took little time in polishing off their opponents, bowling them out for 147 in 39 overs.

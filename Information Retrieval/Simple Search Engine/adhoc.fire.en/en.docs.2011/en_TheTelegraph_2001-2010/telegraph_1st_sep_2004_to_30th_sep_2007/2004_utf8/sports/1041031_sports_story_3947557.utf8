The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Fast-paced game on cards

NOVY KAPADIA

New Delhi: When Punjab last met Kerala in the Santosh Trophy final, it was I. M. Vijayan?s first appearance for his state team. It was in 1987-88 in Quilon and the match ended goalless, but Punjab won the penalty shoot-out 5-4, for their sixth Santosh Trophy title. 

The two meet again in the final of the 59th Indian Oil Santosh Trophy here Sunday. I.M. Vijayan in the twilight of his career will be present in the stands, but not knowing which team to support. He plays his club football with JCT and knows many of the Punjab players personally. There are 11 JCT players in the Punjab squad. It is Kerala?s 12th final entry and Punjab?s 11th. Both came to the forefront of Indian football in the decade of change, the 1970s. Punjab won their first ever Santosh Trophy in 1970 at home in Jalandhar, beating Karnataka 3-1 in the final. Three years later in Ernakulam, Kerala annexed their first ever crown overcoming Railways 3-2 in a nail-biting clash. 

Since then Punjab have been champions six times and runners-up four times. They last won the trophy in 1987-88. 

Kerala have been four-time champions and seven time runners-up. They were last champions in Mumbai in 2001 beating Goa 3-2. 

The sides will miss a key player each due to red cards. Kerala will be without junior international N. P. Pradeep. Punjab will miss hardworking midfielder Parveen Kumar, who scored the only goal against Manipur. 

Kerala stopper Abdul Basheer carrying a strained thigh muscle, but coach Peethambaram is confident that he will be fit for the final. 

It will be a clash of two contrasting styles. Punjab rely on the long ball and quick counter-attacks. Kerala?s build-up is based on one-touch passes but with a lot of variety. 

Kerala?s defence will have to be alert against the aerial and physical threat of speedy Atwal and Harvinder Singh. Punjab?s defensive midfielder Sukhjinder Singh?s role will be crucial, to try and shackle the wily Kerala playmaker Abdul Naushad. A fast paced final is expected.

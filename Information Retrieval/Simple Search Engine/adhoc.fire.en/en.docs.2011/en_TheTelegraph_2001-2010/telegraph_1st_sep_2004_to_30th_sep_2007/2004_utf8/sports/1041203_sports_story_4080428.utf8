The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Bagan, Tollygunge face high hurdles

 - FEDERATION CUP 

 Bagan will bank heavily on ?Beto? 

Bangalore: Calcutta outfits Mohun Bagan and Tollygunge Agragami will look to ouster Goa?s Dempo Sports Club and Sporting Clube de Goa for a place in the 26th Federation Cup football tournament final. The teams will lock horns in the semi-finals on Friday. 

Mohun Bagan will take on Sporting Clube de Goa, who shocked East Bengal 1-0 in the quarter final. Tollygunge Agragami, meanwhile, will face Dempo for a place in Sunday?s final. 

Eleven-times champions Bagan will bank heavily on their Brazilian striker Roberto Mendes Silva ?Beto?, who scored a brace in their 4-1 quarter final drubbing of JCT Mills. 

Defensive worries in the absence of Brazilian defender Eduardo Coelho notwithstanding, the green-and-maroon brigade put on a convincing show in their last match and look determined to bring home the season?s first trophy. 

Their main job would be to take care of Sporting Clube?s Nigerian striker Dudu Omagbemi, who scored the all-important winner against the red-and-golds. 

Tollygunge Agragami, the surprise entrant in the semi-finals will hope to carry on their run against Dempo. The Goan team will look to Brazilian Cristiano Junior to spearhead their challenge against Tollygunge. 

In the quarter finals, Dempo had beaten Churchill Brothers 1-0, while Tollygunge blanked Goan outfit Fransa Sports Club 3-0.

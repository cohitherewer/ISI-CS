 Jerusalem: Nili Natkho, a member of Israeli women?s basketball team, was killed in a car crash on Friday, police said.

 Natkho, 22, was killed when the car she was driving collided with an oncoming vehicle in northern Israel. Her sister and another relative also died. Natkho was a member of Israel?s tiny Circassian community, a Sunni Muslim sect numbering some 3,000 people. She was one of the top shooters in the Israeli league and played for leaders Elitzur Ramle. 

 London: Romanian striker Adrian Mutu has apologised to Chelsea fans after being sacked by the Premier League club for taking cocaine.

 The 25-year-old, dismissed by Chelsea last week, was banned from the game for seven months by the Football Association (FA) on Thursday.

 ?I?ve made a mistake and I am sorry,? Mutu told the BBC on Saturday.?Who doesn?t make mistakes in this life? I?m really sorry.

 ?I know I have disappointed them. I wish them all the best, and I wish to see Chelsea at a good level. I?m very sorry for what I have done.?

 Sydney: Former Australia captain Johnny Warren died on Saturday after a long battle with cancer. He was aged 61.

 Warren was regarded as the face of Australian soccer for more than three decades after captaining his country at their only World Cup finals appearance in 1974. ?It?s an enormous loss, this is a tragic day,? Australian Soccer Association chief executive John ONeill told Australian television. ?This sport has had no greater ambassador. His loss is just enormous.? Nicknamed ?Captain Socceroo?, Warren played 62 matches for Australia including 42 full internationals between 1965 and 1974.

 London: The Ferrari that Michael Schumacher drove to victory in the first five races of the 2004 Formula One season is to be auctioned off at the Italian team?s Maranello headquarters in May 2005. 

 Auctioneers Sotheby?s announced they will hold a sale of cars and Ferrari memorabilia on May 23, with the F2004 racer one of the star lots, in the first auction of its kind to be supported by Ferrari.

 Schumacher won a record 13 races this year on his way to an unprecedented seventh world title.

 A 1958 Ferrari 412S, once driven by 1961 world champion Phil Hill of the United States and compatriot Richie Ginther, will also be sold.

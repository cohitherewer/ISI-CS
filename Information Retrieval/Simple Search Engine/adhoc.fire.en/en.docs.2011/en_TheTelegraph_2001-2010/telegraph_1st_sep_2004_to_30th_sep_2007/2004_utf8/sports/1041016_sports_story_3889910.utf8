The Telegraph - Calcutta

 My best in India yet: Warne

 - I knew it was a matter of one innings, says Virender Sehwag 

 INDRANIL MAJUMDAR 

 Virender Sehwag tries his hand at a reverse sweep against Australia in the second Test in Chennai on Friday 

Chennai: The raised hand was meant for wife Simone in the stands before Shane Warne got huddled by teammates. It was two minutes past 11 at the Chepauk as the wait finally got over. 

The departure of Irfan Pathan meant wicket No. 533 for the Australian and the world record. Muttiah Muralidharan is now world No. 2. 

?It?s a very proud moment for me. When I started off in Sydney against India in 1991-92, I never thought I would reach this far. I?m reminded of my grandparents. Let the feeling settle down?? Warne, playing his 114th Test, said a bit emotionally. 

The leg-spinner, who later dismissed Virender Sehwag, is disappointed at not getting more wickets. ?I think today I bowled the best I?ve ever done in India. There were a few dropped chances. Most of them, though, will go down as half chances. I don?t blame the fielders since they toiled hard in extremely humid conditions. 

?It?s been a fascinating Test match thus far. Hopefully we can make amends and fight back tomorrow. If we can manage a lead of around 250 it should be great game.? 

Warne hoped he could hold on to this feat ?for a week or a month? after overtaking Muralidharan for the first time. Muralidharan broke Courtney Walsh?s record (519) in May this year to be at 527 after the series in Zimbabwe. Warne took 10 wickets in the two-Test series against Sri Lanka at home in July to be on equal terms. 

But Murali again overtook Warne at Galle (against South Africa in August) to be on 532 after the series. Warne now has 534 victims. 

?I hope this is something I can hang on to and narrate to the others. It?s a great achievement.? Warne felt it?s ?all about enjoyment? that has kept him going. ?The success of Kumble, Harbhajan, Saqlain and myself has proved that there is still place for spinners in Test cricket. 

?I felt proud when Dravid came up to me and shook hands even before facing a ball. Murali Kartik congratulated me at the break. The other Indians also followed. It showed the great spirit between the two sides. I am grateful to my teammates for all the encouragement,? he remarked. 

The Australians accorded him a ?guard of honour? at the end of the day, but haven?t yet decided on any formal presentation. 

Warne said he wishes ?to be remembered as one of the great entertainers of the game?. ?The good times always inspires me. I?ve been playing first class cricket for 15 years with a lot of success. I am 35 and have three kids. I?ve learnt my lessons on and off the field. Hopefully, this achievement can inspire my teammates to winning the series here. 

?My inconsistent performance in India has been due to combination of factors ? a shoulder operation, the injury to the spinning finger. But if I can bowl like today I can cause problems to them. They couldn?t read my deliveries today, which way it was going?? 

Warne was all praise for Virender Sehwag. ?He had a few close shaves today but I will give him the credit.? 

Sehwag, too, was effusive in his praise for the world-record holder after his 155. ?He may not have had great success here but this has been a huge achievement. He is a great bowler.? 

The Indian, who was back among after a string of low scores in one-dayers, said it was ?very tough mentally? to go through this bad phase. ?But I knew it was a matter of one innings. If I could reach 50, then a century would be in the taking. I was unfortunate in Bangalore.? 

Sehwag told The Telegraph that he would like to dedicate this innings to ?wife Aarti and family members?. 

?There was no change in my gameplan. The idea was to survive the first session. I played my natural game. The idea was to wait for the loose balls and minimise the risk factor. I am happy that the century has come against the world champions. 

?I started playing shots once I reached my hundred but am not happy with the shot selection. Often I was picking the wrong ball,? he explained.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Wenger fined ?15,000 by FA

London: Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has been fined ?15,000 ($29,220) for improper conduct for comments he made after the champions? 2-0 defeat by Manchester United in October. 

Wenger was also ?severely reprimanded and warned to his future conduct?, the Football Association (FA) said on Thursday following a personal hearing. 

The Frenchman had faced charges after reportedly calling United?s Dutch striker Ruud van Nistelrooy a ?cheat?. Wenger has denied the charge. 

United?s win at Old Trafford, secured by a controversial Van Nistelrooy penalty and a late goal by England striker Wayne Rooney, ended Arsenal?s record 49-match unbeaten league run and triggered a slump in form. 

Wenger was also investigated by the FA over comments he made about referee Mike Riley?s decision to award the penalty. 

The FA also looked into reports that food was thrown at United manager Alex Ferguson in the tunnel after the game. 

Arsenal hotly contested the 73rd-minute penalty after Rooney appeared to trip over Arsenal?s England defender Sol Campbell. 

Van Nistelrooy, who missed a penalty when last season?s corresponding fixture ended 0-0, made no mistake from the spot, and Rooney scored United?s second goal in stoppage time on his 19th birthday. 

Van Nistelrooy was suspended for three matches for a high tackle on Arsenal defender Ashley Cole during the same game. 

United and Arsenal have dominated English football in recent years. 

Their rivalry has been particularly intense, since last season?s Old Trafford match descended into a fracas which led to four Arsenal players being banned and the club fined.

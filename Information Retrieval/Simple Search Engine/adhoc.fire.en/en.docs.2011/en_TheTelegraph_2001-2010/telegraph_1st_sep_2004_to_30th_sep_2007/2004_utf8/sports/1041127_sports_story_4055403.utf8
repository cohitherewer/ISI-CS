Calcutta: Kapil Dev hopes Anil Kumble will become the first Indian to reach the 500-wicket mark and do so before the 2007 World Cup. 

The 1983 World Cup-winning captain, who was presented with the Castrol Lifetime Achievement in Cricket award here on Friday, said the leg-spinner had it in him to carve a niche for himself in world cricket. 

Kapil holds the Indian record of 434 Test victims. Kumble?s current tally stands at 430. On receiving a special award from the legendary allrounder for becoming the second Indian to bag 400 wickets, Kumble revealed that Kapil had called up to congratulate him and, at the same time, urged him to go for 500. 

As the duo prepared to leave the dais, Kapil suddenly asked the leg-spinner how long he would take to reach 500. Without letting Kumble answer, Kapil told him to do the job before the World Cup. 

In a lighter vein, Kapil thanked the Indian board for allowing him to represent the country, and ?not the BCCI.? 

He hoped that the Eden Gardens wicket for the second Test would last all five days. 

The Cricketer of the Year (2003-2004) award was jointly bagged by Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid. The Junior Cricketer of the Year was conferred on the under-19 World Cup opener Shikhar Dhawan while Virender Sehwag was specially honoured for becoming the first Indian to score a triple century in Tests. 

Also felicitated was the Sambaran Banerjee-led Bengal team, which won the Ranji Trophy in 1989-90.

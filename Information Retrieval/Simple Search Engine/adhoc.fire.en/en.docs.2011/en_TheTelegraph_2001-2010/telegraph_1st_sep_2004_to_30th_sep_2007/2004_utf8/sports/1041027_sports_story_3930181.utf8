Chittagong: Captain Stephen Fleming struck a sparkling century as New Zealand took control of the second and final Test against Bangladesh on Tuesday. 

Fleming became his country?s highest run-getter in Tests during an unbeaten 137 as New Zealand reached 338 for three after electing to bat at the M.A. Aziz Stadium. Nathan Astle was the other not out batsman on 34. 

Fleming was associated in a dominating 204-run partnership for the third wicket with Scott Styris (89) that put paid to the home side?s hopes of fighting it out on a pitch aiding turn. Fleming, who got past Martin Crowe?s aggregate of 5,444 runs with an uppish boundary through cover off Mohammed Rafique when on 78, was positive from early on and was not afraid to play lofted shots. 

The 31-year-old left-hander also set a new mark of Test caps for New Zealand as he was tied at 86 matches with legendary seamer Richard Hadlee before this match. 

?I had those records in mind when I went out to bat today,? said Fleming, who hammered 15 fours in his eighth Test century. 

Styris, dropped by wicketkeeper Khaled Mashud off Enamul Haque (junior) on 24, himself hit 10 fours and a six during his fifth fifty. He looked set for a century but failed to read a slower delivery and gave a soft return catch to Rafique. 

The visiting side got off to a brisk start through openers Mark Richardson (28) and Matthew Sinclair (23) before left-arm spinners Rafique and Haque took a wicket each. 

Sinclair was bowled by a delivery from Rafique that turned away nicely, while left-hander Richardson top-edged a sweep to Mushfiqur Rahman at square-leg off Haque. 

New Zealand made one change, bringing in batsman Hamish Marshall for paceman Ian Butler. (AFP)

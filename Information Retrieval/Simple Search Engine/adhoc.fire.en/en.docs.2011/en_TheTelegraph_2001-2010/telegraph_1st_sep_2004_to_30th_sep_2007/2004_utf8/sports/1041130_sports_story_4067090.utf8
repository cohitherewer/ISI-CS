The Telegraph - Calcutta

 NZ looking down barrel

Adelaide: Australia set New Zealand 464 to win and then ripped through the touring side?s top order to leave the Kiwis struggling on 149 for five at the end of the fourth day of the second Test on Monday. 

Australia captain Ricky Ponting declared after the lunch break with the hosts comfortably placed at 139 for two, handing the Black Caps an almost near-impossible task of batting through nearly five sessions, to save the Test against the world?s most potent bowling attack. 

Expectedly, New Zealand limped to tea break at 36 for four at Adelaide Oval, with their leading run-scorer and captain Stephen Fleming already dismissed for three. 

Nathan Astle and all-rounder Jacob Oram put on 63 for the fifth wicket before Astle was caught by a diving Justin Langer off part-time spinner Darren Lehmann for 38. Oram remained unbeaten on 40. 

Wicketkeeper Brendon McCullum hit leg spinner Shane Warne for an effortless six over mid-wicket in scoring a quickfire 34 not out from 36 balls including five fours, to give the Kiwis some hope of saving the match. 

Australia lead the two-match series 1-0. 

Earlier, pacemen Jason Gillespie and Glenn McGrath, who shared seven wickets between them in New Zealand?s first innings, were quick to break through again on Monday. 

Gillespie trapped Mathew Sinclair for two in the fourth over, before McGrath knocked over Fleming?s off-bail just six balls later. 

Michael Kasprowicz had Mark Richardson caught at third slip by Langer for 16 at 34 for three, and one ball later, Warne removed Scott Styris for eight, caught at slip by Michael Clarke. 

Australia had begun the day with some cautious batting, resuming on 57 for no wicket and adding just 82 runs in 35 overs for the loss of two wickets. Ponting was not out 26 while Damien Martyn was unbeaten on six. 

Langer (46) and Matthew Hayden (54) shared an opening stand of 93 on Monday after putting on 137 for the first wicket in Australia?s first innings, their 13th century stand.

Calcutta: Karsan Ghavri feels it?s high time for the batsmen to deliver as Bengal host Mumbai in a crucial Ranji Trophy Elite group A match at the Jadavpur University?s Salt Lake campus ground from Saturday. 

While the visitors start favourites with a good balance in batting and bowling, Bengal look desperate to turn the tide. 

?We can?t afford to lose the match. It?s good to have two points at the end of the day, but we?ll try and push for an outright win,? Ghavri said on Friday. 

For those two points, Bengal have to ensure the first-innings lead. But the way the top-order failed to convert their good starts into big scores against Gujarat in the last match in Siliguri, must have left a few more wrinkles on Ghavri?s forehead. 

?We?ve got to have a balance in the team. We?ve got to fire. Mumbai are a very good side and we expect a tough match against them,? maintained the Bengal coach. 

For his part, captain Rohan Gavaskar ? the solitary man to shine with bat in Siliguri (80 and 111 not out) ? had this to say: ?We don?t look back to the past, nor look forward to the future. It?s the present that?s we are concentrating on.? 

Ranadeb Bose is the other player to have come back with something to cheer ? a match-haul of 11 wickets ? from that two-wicket loss to Gujarat. 

However, Ghavri is learnt to have taken strong exception to the way some players had failed to deliver under pressure and a reshuffling in the XI looks likely against Mumbai. 

Under-pressure off-spinner Sourashish Lahiri may be replaced by young Ritam Kundu while Anustup Majumdar is likely to debut in a bid to strengthen batting. 

Mumbai coach Chandrakant Pandit also felt that Bengal will be a ?dangerous? proposition to deal with. 

?Bengal will be more dangerous at home, particularly after a loss. We are expecting them to bounce back with more aggression. So any question of taking anything for granted is absolutely ruled out,? the former India wicket-keeper pointed out. 

Mumbai skipper Sairaj Bahutule also admitted that the tie versus Bengal was ?crucial? for them. 

Mumbai have so far collected seven points (including one bonus point) against Bengal?s four. But Pandit said the group ?is still wide open.? 

?There are still four matches to go. Both Delhi and Gujarat are on six points each. So nothing is certain now,? he remarked. 

Vinod Kambli (down with jaundice) and Aviskar Salvi (shoulder injury) could not make it to the Mumbai squad. 

Team India captain Sourav Ganguly sprang a surprise by playing Bengal?s season-opener versus Karnataka at the same ground and his presence proved to be a big motivation for the hosts who started with a win. 

Since then, Ghavri?s boys have failed to keep the momentum going, drawing with Railways and losing to Gujarat. 

?He (Sourav) is a great motivator and his presence certainly played a key role in that win,? said Pandit. But with a balanced team at his disposal, he was least concerned about the nature of the wicket. ?Pitch may favour the spinners but it shouldn?t be a worry,? he added. 

Pandit further said the XI would be picked after seeing the wicket before the match started. 

However, pacer Ajit Agarkar along with the spinning trio ? Bahutule, Ramesh Powar and Nilesh Kulkarni ? are certain to take care of Mumbai?s bowling. 

Both teams skipped practice on the match-eve because of the strike. Pandit said it won?t affect his team, but the same can?t be said about the hosts. 

It?s really surprising that no initiative was taken to arrange for practice on the eve of a crucial match, which happened to have coincided with a strike. 

May be Sourav needs to spring another surprise to help Bengal tide over the crisis.

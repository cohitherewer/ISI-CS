 Ali?s greatest miracle

 - 30 years after Rumble in the jungle

BOB MEE 

 ?Don?t talk,? Ali had said, ?I know what I?m doing? 

The Rumble in the Jungle was Muhammad Ali?s greatest miracle, and remains a perfect example of the psychological essence of boxing?s mysterious art. 

It has become fashionable to assess boxing as a crude relic of less civilised times, a sport that lacks the subtleties and nuances of more ?advanced? activities.Not so. Ali?s eight-round destruction of George Foreman, the supposedly monstrous, invincible George Foreman, at around 4am on Oct 30, 1974, was as complete a demonstration of sporting excellence as is possible. 

First the background: Foreman had knocked down Smokin? Joe Frazier six times in two rounds to win the world heavyweight championship, then defended it with ruthlessly swift wins against Joe Roman and Ken Norton. He had won all 40 of his professional fights and was still only 25. 

By contrast, Ali had won and lost on points against both Frazier and Norton. The latter had broken his jaw. Ali was 32, no longer the dancing genius of his great years between 1964 and 1967. 

Most critics who made the arduous journey to Zaire were of the opinion they were gathering to witness Ali?s wake. Even the fact that Foreman?s preparations were spoiled by a cut eye, which caused a five-week postponement, didn?t alter this view. 

Ali postured. He offered rhymes and he delighted in entertaining the fans ? at one sparring session he opened his fist to the crowd and a sparrow flew out.Boxing at this level is always bizarre, often absurd. President Mobutu Sese Seko gave Foreman a lion cub. The champion, who already had a dog called Daggo, said when he finished boxing he would really like to become a vet. 

And so to the fight: everyone could picture it. Foreman would walk in, let go the punches that could knock down walls, and Ali would dance... and hope to keep on dancing for 15 rounds. 

Except that when the bell rang, Ali planted his feet and began hitting Foreman with right hands. The point made, in the second he began resting on the ropes.In his corner at the end of the round, one of the team yelled: ?Dance, you?ve got to dance.? 

?Don?t talk,? said Ali. ?I know what I?m doing.?Foreman was programmed to put Ali on the ropes and throw his big, arcing punches. But the twist was magnificent, courageous, the ultimate gamble.Ali had deliberately gone there himself, and in doing so had control of the moment. The subtlety was lost on big George, who as we all know whacked away until he grew tired. 

Ali cupped his gloves around his head and let him hit his body and arms ? and, yes, the side of the head. All the time he talked. ?Hit harder, George, that the best you got? Show me something, you ain?t got nothing. Show me... you ain?t hurt me yet.? 

Later, after he had sent Foreman spinning to defeat in that tumultuous eighth round, Ali basked in the glow of being right when the world was wrong and recalled how he leaned on George to wear him out even more. ?I?m leaning on him and whisperin?, ?Man, you so tired?. Come on chump, come and get me.?

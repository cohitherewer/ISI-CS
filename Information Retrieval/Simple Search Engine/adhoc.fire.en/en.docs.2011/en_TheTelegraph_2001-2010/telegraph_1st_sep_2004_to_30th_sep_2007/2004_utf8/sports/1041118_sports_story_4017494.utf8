 Lausanne: The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) has set new dates for hearings on the doping cases of American sprinters Tim Montgomery and Chryste Gaines. Montgomery?s hearing will start June 6 in San Francisco and Gaines? case will begin July 10 in New York, CAS secretary-general Matthieu Reeb said on Tuesday. CAS recently postponed the hearings at the request of all parties.

 Montgomery ? world record holder in the 100m ? and Gaines are accused of doping violations by the US Anti-Doping Agency and could be banned from competition.

 Havana: Former Olympic long jump champion Ivan Pedroso anticipates a long career ahead of him, and that he will continue in his quest for a fifth world championship next year in Finland.

 ?The idea of retiring hasn?t even entered my head,? Pedroso said on Tuesday after training. ?I am going to continue as long as I have a strong mind and the desire to jump.? Pedroso, who turns 31 in December, said that: ?After 30 years of age a long jumper reaches plenitude, he has experience and shrewdness.?

 The Cuban has dominated the long jump since Americans Mike Powell and Carl Lewis retired. Powell still owns the world record of 8.95m (29 feet, 4 1/2 inches) set in 1991.

 Moscow: Russian President Vladimir Putin called up teen tennis sensation Maria Sharapova to congratulate her on the spectacular win in WTA Championships final over Serena Williams. ?President Putin also wished Sharapova new successes,? the Kremlin press office said.

 Sharapova defeated the American 4-6, 6-2, 6-4, in the final game of the year-end WTA Championships in Los Angeles on Monday to become the first Russian woman to win the coveted title. The 17-year-old, who won the Wimbledon title earlier this year, currently ranks fourth in the world after starting the year at No. 32

 Oslo: Norwegian soccer champions Rosenborg Trondheim are violating sex equality laws by barring female journalists from the changing room, Norway?s gender equality watchdog said on Wednesday.

 ?Women and men must have the same working rights,? said Kristin Mile, Norway?s official in charge of overseeing gender equality.

 Rosenborg let male reporters into the changing rooms to talk to players after matches but keep women out.

 ?The practice is illegal unless Rosenborg have a very good reason to keep female journalists out of the changing room,? she said. Mile said she understood that Rosenborg players might not want women around while they were taking a shower. If that were the case, meetings with all reporters should be held outside the changing rooms.

 ?The point is not that women must be allowed into the changing room, but that media must have equal access,? she said.

 Rio de Janeiro: Santos? title chances were dealt a blow on Tuesday when they received their third home ban of the season after fans threw firecrackers and coins on to the field during a Brazilian championship game. Brazilian soccer?s disciplinary tribunal ordered the club to play next month?s match against Gremio at least 150km from their Vila Belmiro stadium following the incidents during a 1-1 draw with Corinthians in October.

 The tribunal has handed out a number of bans in the last month in an attempt to cut down on missile-throwing.

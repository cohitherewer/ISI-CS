 Akram: Overseas coaches don?t have personal agenda

 - Ashish Nehra injury-prone says Pakistani legend 

Mumbai: The reason why coaches from overseas have been welcomed and proved successful in their stints in the sub-continent is ?they do not have a personal agenda?, Pakistan fast bowling great Wasim Akram said on Thursday. 

?As a player I felt comfortable with a foreign coach because they don?t carry personal agenda,? the former Pakistan skipper said here after extolling the virtues of physical exercise during an interactive session with hundreds of admiring school children. 

?I feel the sub-continent players are also confident under a foreign coach as they are neutral and we can trust them,? said the great left-arm paceman. All four countries of the sub-continent currently have coaches from outside the region. India have John Wright as coach, Pakistan are guided by Bob Woolmer, Sri Lanka have appointed John Dyson and Bangladesh are coached by Dav Whatmore. 

Akram also welcomed the role taken on by another former Pakistan captain, Intikhab Alam, who would be coaching the Punjab Ranji Trophy team this season. 

?I welcome it. He?s trying to guide the youngsters. I would welcome anyone trying to guide under 15 and 17 players,? he said before having a dig at his former teammate and coach Javed Miandad. 

?At least he?s not like Javed and wants to coach only a national team,? Akram said. 

Akram did not agree with the generally held view that fast bowlers are breaking down more often now than in the past. ?We too have had breakdowns in our times. There?s no specific reason for this,? he said. 

When the case of Ashish Nehra was pointed out, Akram agreed that the Indian left-arm paceman did seem to be very injury-prone. 

?He seems to break down every second day, does he not,? he asked, but pointed out that Irfan Pathan has continued for over a year without injury problems. (PTI)

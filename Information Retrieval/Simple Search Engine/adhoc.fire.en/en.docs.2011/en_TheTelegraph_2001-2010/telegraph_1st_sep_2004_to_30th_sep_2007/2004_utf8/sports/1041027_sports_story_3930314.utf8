 No plans to quit: Constantine 

A CORRESPONDENT

 Constantine 

New Delhi: National coach Stephen Constantine isn?t quitting, after India?s last World Cup qualifier on November 17 in Oman. He said he allows the AIFF to determine his future. 

He is Delhi for a preparatory camp before the national team departs on November 2 for a friendly in Kuwait City on November 5. The team returns for further training before leaving for Oman. Plans for friendlies in the UAE and Singapore didn?t materialise. 

He said players spotted from the current Santosh Trophy semi-finalists (Kerala, Services and Punjab) were not called for the camp because there wasn?t enough time. 

He expressed surprise that India?s champion club East Bengal allowed Bhaichung Bhutia to play for his state in the Santosh Trophy but not for his country. 

In Santosh Trophy, Bengal salvaged some pride, beating Uttar Pradesh 1-0. Teenager Sankha Roy Chowdhury headed in Gouranga Dutta?s right flank cross in the 42nd minute. 

Punjab entered the semi-finals topping group D. Tuesday they beat Tamil Nadu 1-0, Harvinder Singh scoring.

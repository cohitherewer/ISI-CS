 Teammates should back Sourav: Jadeja

New Delhi: Ajay Jadeja has criticised Sourav Ganguly?s teammates for not coming out in support of their captain after Clive Lloyd?s ?verdict? for slow over-rate during Saturday?s match against Pakistan. 

?It is sad that nobody has supported Sourav. In 50 years no other captain has done so much for his boys,? Jadeja said at a press conference. ?Sourav stands by teammates whenever required but none has come forward for him. It is not surprising, in fact, it is sad,? said the Delhi captain. 

Kapil Dev and Zaheer Abbas, who were also present, felt the punishment was harsh. ?From a cricketer?s point of view, this punishment is really harsh. But every game has its rules and players have to follow that,? Kapil said. 

Zaheer said: ?It is sad for cricket but it has to happen because there are rules and regulations for every game. It applies to every game.? (PTI)

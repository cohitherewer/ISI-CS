The Telegraph - Calcutta

 We will be underdogs: Roddick

 - DAVIS CUP 

- US finish 4-0 vs Belarus; Spain make it 4-1 over France 

 Andy Roddick returns a volley to Alexander Skrypko in Charleston on Sunday. Roddick won 6-4, 6-2 

London: World No. 2 Andy Roddick says the US will probably be the underdogs in the Davis Cup final against hosts Spain in December. 

The US clinched their place in the final with a 4-0 win over Belarus here on Sunday while Spain went through for the third time in five years, thanks to a 4-1 victory over France in Alicante. 

The US and Spain have met six times in the Davis Cup, with the Americans 4-2 up. Both Spanish wins have been at home on clay, the likely surface for the December 3-5 final. Spain triumphed in the 2000 semis and in the third round in 1965 but also lost to the US at home on clay in 1972. 

?On paper, if you look at (all) clay-court results, we?re probably the underdogs,? Roddick said after winning his two singles matches against Belarus. ?But I definitely think we can give ourselves a chance to win. 

?It?s definitely on my list of...big goals,? the hard-serving Roddick said. ?And to kind of know we?re nine sets away from doing that, it feels pretty good.? 

After all, he said, it is time to erase the stigma of never having played in a Davis Cup final. The US have not been in the final since 1997, and have not won the title since 1995. Spain moved into the final after Rafael Nadal used his youthful exuberance to charge past France?s Arnaud Clement on Sunday. 

The teenager, drafted in to replace a below par Carlos Moya took all the big points in a 6-4, 6-1, 6-2 victory, giving Spain an unbeatable 3-1 lead and a place in the final for the third time in five years. 

?We?re going to celebrate with champagne and cakes,? said triumphant Spanish captain Jordi Arrese.?Then we?ll start thinking about the final. 

Spain?s Tommy Robredo beat Paul-Henri Mathieu 6-4, 6-4 to give his country a 4-1 win in Alicante and complete an excellent comeback after Moya?s shock opening day defeat by Mathieu. 

The US, champions a record 31 times, beat Belarus 4-0 in the other semi-final. The fifth and final rubber in Charleston, South Carolina between Mardy Fish and Andrei Karatchenia was abandoned due to rain. 

?When I saw the draw early on, and I saw what the potential was, I was excited about going to Spain for the final,? US captain Patrick McEnroe said.

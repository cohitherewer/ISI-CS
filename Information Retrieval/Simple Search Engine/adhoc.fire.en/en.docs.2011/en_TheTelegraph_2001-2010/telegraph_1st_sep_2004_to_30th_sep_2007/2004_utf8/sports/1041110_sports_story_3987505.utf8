 MCG may lose Boxing Day Test

Sydney: The Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) is in danger of losing its annual Boxing Day Test this year because of delays with redevelopments at the ground. 

Officials insist the MCG, cricket?s oldest Test venue, will be ready for the second Test against Pakistan starting on December 26 but have booked the nearby Docklands Stadium just in case. 

?We?re on schedule and I think we?re okay... but in all good planning arrangements you?ve got to have a back up,? MCG chief executive Stephen Gough told Australian Broadcasting Corp radio on Tuesday.

 Yuvraj, Kaif among Jonty?s favourites

Mumbai: Jonty Rhodes, one of the best fielders of all times, rated Yuvraj Singh and Mohammed Kaif among the 11 top fielders he had seen during his career. 

Asked to name his 11 personal best fielders, Rhodes mentioned his name, ?since I know myself better than others?, Fanie de Villiers, Brett Lee, Mark Waugh, Mark Taylor, Ricky Ponting, Herschelle Gibbs, Justin Ontong, Upul Chandana, Kaif and Yuvraj. 

?My fielding was a bit different to (former South African) Colin Bland?s. Bland?s speciality was hitting the stumps with accuracy. I relied more on anticipation, on the body language exhibited by the batsman. Ponting comes closest to my style,? Rhodes said. (PTI)

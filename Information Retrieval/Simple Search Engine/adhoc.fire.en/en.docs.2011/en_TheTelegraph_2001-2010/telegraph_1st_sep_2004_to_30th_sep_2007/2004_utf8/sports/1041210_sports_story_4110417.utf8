Calcutta: The under-fire Mohun Bagan custodian Subrata Pal will continue to play even if his family decides otherwise. 

?Under no circumstances, I am going to leave the game as I cannot live without football,? Pal said after the club?s first practice session since the Federation Cup loss to Dempo SC. 

Days after Pal was put under fire for Brazilian Cristiano Junior?s death in the Federation Cup final in Bangalore, his family had made it clear that they would prevent Pal from pursuing with the game after last Sunday?s incident. 

Repeatedly claiming his innocence over Junior?s death, Pal seemed unmoved with the incident. ?I did whatever required to save the goal,? he said. But he completely denied about his intention to hit Junior when the ball was already placed into the goal. 

Pal has been assailed by a section of the football fraternity including some top players after television replays showed that he had hit Junior after the Brazilian had scored the second goal for Dempo. 

Asked why he was repeatedly getting involved in on-field disturbances, Pal said: ?I give hundred per cent under the bar. I get so much involved in the game that it seems that I am aggressive?. 

?But I feel terribly bad for Junior. I wept a lot when news of his death reached me,? he said. 

But he made it clear that he was not under any psychological pressure following the sad episode. ?I want to focus only on playing the game to the best of my abilities. The other matters will be taken care of by my coach and club officials?. 

The 19-year old goalkeeper, who hails from Sodepur, said his next target was to turn out for the green-and-maroon shirts in the National Football League. ?I also have the dream of turning out for India,? he said during a press conference at the club tent on Thursday. 

However, his teammates are standing by their goalie. 

Mehtab Hussain was one of them who openly came out in Pal?s support. 

?No one has the right to pull him up for the incident, any goalie would do the same thing in a one-on-one situation,? he said. Mehtab also pointed his finger to East Bengal?s Debjit Ghosh and Madhab Das. 

?They also play rough football, why don?t you take action against them,? he said.

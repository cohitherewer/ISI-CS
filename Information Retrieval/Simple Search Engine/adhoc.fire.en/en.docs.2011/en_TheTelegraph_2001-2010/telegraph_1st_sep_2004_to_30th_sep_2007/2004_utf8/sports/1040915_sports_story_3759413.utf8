 Kin begs Diego to stay

 Maradona 

Buenos Aires: Diego Maradona?s brother has said that family members have tearfully urged the former soccer great to drop his intentions of travelling to Cuba for medical treatment. 

Maradona?s brother Raul, speaking during a television interview late Sunday night, said the two daughters of the former World Cup champion have practically ?begged him crying? to cease his efforts to leave Argentina. 

An admitted cocaine addict, the former Argentina captain had until recently been barred from leaving the country after family members sought an injunction to keep him from leaving without their consent. 

Last week a judge said the family had accepted his request to seek treatment abroad as long as he was accompanied by a family member. Maradona has said he prefers treatment in Cuba because of greater privacy. 

Asked about those developments, Raul Maradona told America TV that the family really doesn?t want the hero of Argentina?s 1986 World Cup title team to leave at all. 

?We are doing everything we can to try to keep him here,? Raul Maradona said. Raul said several family members, including Maradona?s ex-wife Claudia, remain doubtful that Cuba is a suitable destination at this time for Maradona. 

Maradona was twice hospitalised here with heart and lung problems earlier this year before being confined to a psychiatric hospital three months ago for treatment. 

Besides the 1986 World Cup title, Maradona led Argentina to the 1990 World Cup final before retiring in 1997. 

On Saturday, Maradona briefly returned to a private clinic with a fever and an apparently respiratory problem but left within hours, according to local television and news reports. (AP)

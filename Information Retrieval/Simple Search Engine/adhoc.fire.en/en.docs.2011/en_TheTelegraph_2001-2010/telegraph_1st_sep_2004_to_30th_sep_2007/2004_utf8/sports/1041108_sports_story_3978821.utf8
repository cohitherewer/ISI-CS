The Telegraph - Calcutta

 ?I made up my mind to play last night? 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: In a surprise move, Team India captain Sourav Ganguly turned out for Bengal in the Ranji Trophy match against Karnataka on Sunday. He, however, decided to keep mum on issues relating to his fitness. ?Whatever I have to say, I will tell after the fourth day,? Sourav said. 

Sourav, who remained unbeaten on 12 in a 79-minute stay, looked a bit uncomfortable in the beginning, but left the field with signs of confidence. 

Bengal coach Karsan Ghavri had this to say: ?We came to know about this only last night and so accordingly the selectors accommodated him. 

?I made up my mind last night that I would play,? Sourav also said when asked. 

However, according to the team sources, Sourav?s inclusion in the squad was kept under the wrap till Sunday morning. ?We didn?t know about such a development last night,? a source, attached to the Bengal squad, said. 

The Bengal selectors eventually omitted Nikhil Haldipur to accommodate Sourav in the XI. 

Sourav?s decision apparently aimed at giving him a much-needed practice ahead of India?s ODI against Pakistan at Eden Gardens on November 13, as a part of BCCI?s platinum jubilee celebrations. 

The CAB president Jagmohan Dalmiya, however, said: ?He (Sourav) felt he was fit and that?s why he decided to play.? Ghavri termed Sourav?s inclusion as a morale booster for the team. 

According to the BCCI?s provision regarding the payment to Ranji players, only 15 in a squad are paid. Since Sourav?s inclusion has made Bengal a 17-member squad, the organisers have decided to pay the match fees to the extra players, a CAB official, who wished to remain anonymous, said. 

During the match, when Bengal were well-paced at 199 

for no loss, Sourav also opted for a net session with Ranadeb Bose and Sabir Ali.

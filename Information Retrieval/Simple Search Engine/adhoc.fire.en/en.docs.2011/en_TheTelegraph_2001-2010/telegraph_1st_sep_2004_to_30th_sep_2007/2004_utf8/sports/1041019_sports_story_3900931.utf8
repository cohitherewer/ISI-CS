 Indian men get past Philippines 

 Surya Sekhar?s efforts paid off 

Mallorca: Thanks to a resurgent Abhijit Kunte and Surya Shekhar Ganguly, the Indian men cruised to a 3-1 victory over Philippines in the third round of the 36th Chess Olympiad here at Gran Casino. 

The win took the men?s tally to nine points from three outings in the competition, which is being led by Ukraine who came up with yet another fine performance to trounce Czech Republic 4-0. 

It turned out to be a good day for Kunte who scored a valuable point with black pieces against IM Emmanuel Senador. Playing the Berlin Defence, Kunte was pleasantly surprised when Senador went for the closed set-up and duly punished a rather sluggish attack later in the middle game. 

Senador then went for the queen and minor piece endgame with one pawn less but found Kunte?s technical handling perfect too. The game lasted 46 moves. 

Surya Sekhar, who was highly successful in the previous edition of the Olympiad at Bled, Slovenia, scored over GM-in-waiting Mark Paragua in a Sicilian Nazdorf game. 

Playing white, Surya Sekhar, who had beaten Paragua in their last three meetings, calculated perfectly in a dangerous-looking endgame and his efforts paid-off well. 

With Viswanathan Anand opting out for the second time in three days, Sasikiran took charge of the top board and had a better position to boast off against veteran Eugene Torre from a Nimzo Indian Defence game where the latter played black. 

3-in-row for women 

Putting up yet another fine show, the women?s team downed Bulgaria 2-1 to register its third straight victory. 

Silver medallist in last two Olympiads, S. Vijayalakshmi, provided the winner after both Koneru Humpy and Dronavalli Harika drew in the third round of the competition Sunday. 

It was a tough call for GM Humpy on the top board against world women champion Antoaneta Stefanova. 

Having lost in the semi-finals of the world championship against Ekaterina Kovalevskaya at Kalmykia earlier this year, Humpy wanted to have a full bloodied battle against the Bulgarian but Stefanova?s opening choice surprised her a great deal.Top seed and defending champions China crushed overnight joint leader Latvia to join Germany at the top of the table on 8.5 points after the third round. 

Second seed Russia, third seed US and the 13th seed Hungary shared the third spot on 7.5 points each while the Indians were half a point behind them on seven points sharing the 6th spot with Sweden, England, Slovakia, Holland, Ukraine and Poland. (PTI)

 Paris: Andre Agassi and David Nalbandian pulled out of the Paris Masters on Monday because of injuries, organisers said. American Agassi was seeded fifth while Argentine Nalbandian was the eighth seed in the penultimate tournament of the season. Agassi said he was suffering from a recurrence of a hip injury while Nalbandian?s injury was not immediately clear. The Argentine was planning to see the tournament doctor. Neither is now likely to qualify for the season-ending Masters Cup in Houston and will be replaced in the Paris draw by lucky losers.

 Dublin: Former England striker Stan Collymore says he was beaten up by six rugby union players after one of them racially abused him at a night club.

 Police said today they were investigating the incident. Officials from the players club, Bath, said they wouldn?t comment until they had heard all the details. The English Rugby Football Union said it was ?monitoring? the case. Collymore, who played for Liverpool and Aston Villa before retiring to pursue a TV career, told the Daily Mirror he sustained a boken nose, bruised ribs and a suspected elbow fracture in the fight.

 Liverpool: Liverpool and France striker Djibril Cisse has been ruled out for the rest of the season after breaking his leg in Saturday?s 2-2 draw at Blackburn Rovers. Liverpool?s official website reported that the 23-year-old had a successful operation on Sunday but would not play again this season. He is expected to remain in hospital for five or six days. Cisse collapsed to the ground screaming in agony after his leg crumpled following a challenge by Blackburn defender James McEveley 30 minutes into the game at Ewood Park.

 Sydney: Australian soccer officials have unveiled plans for an elite national club competition to start next year. The competition, to be named the A-League, replaces the National Soccer League that was scrapped last season as part of a major overhaul of the way the game is run in Australia.

 Just eight clubs ? one each from Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, Adelaide, Newcastle, Central Coast and Auckland in New Zealand ? were included in the new league but there are plans for further expansion, possibly into Asia.

 Beijing: China?s top national football league headed off a threat by top clubs to boycott it over the weekend after allegations that referees had accepted bribes. ?The rest of the season should continue without any hitches,? China Football Association (CFA) spokesman Dong Hua said. ?There are no problems.?

 Seven clubs complained that corruption in the new Chinese Super League was rife and the boycott threat was averted only after emergency talks with the CFA.

 Amsterdam: Andorra?s World Cup Group One ?home? qualifier against The Netherlands will be played at the Mini Estadi in Barcelona on November 17. A Dutch FA (KNVB) spokesman told Reuters that it and world football governing body Fifa had agreed a request to switch the match to Spain.

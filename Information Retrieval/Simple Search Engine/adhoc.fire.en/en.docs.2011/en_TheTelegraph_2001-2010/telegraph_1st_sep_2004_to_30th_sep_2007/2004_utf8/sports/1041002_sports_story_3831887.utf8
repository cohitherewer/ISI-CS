 Bhowmick all praise for ground

Calcutta: Subhas Bhowmick wore a satisfied look after his team?s 4-1 rout of Mohammedan Sporting in the IFA Shield match on Friday and he admitted much of it owed to the better ground conditions of the Kalyani Stadium. 

?It?s a crime not to play good on this ground. I?m satisfied that the boys played a very good brand of football,? East Bengal coach told reporters in a post-match conversation. 

His opposite in Mohammedan Sporting, Mridul Banerjee, conceded as much. ?The result was unexpected, particularly after the team?s 2-2 draw with Mohun Bagan in the last match. I must say we didn?t deserve to win,? he said. 

Even basking in celebration times, Bhowmick, however, had a word of disgust as well. He accused some of his wards of ?playing around? in their quest for more goals towards the end of the match. ?Some of my players were too keen to score and in doing so, they forgot their basic roles in the match. I?ll definitely give them a piece of mind in tomorrow?s practice,? he said. 

He was, though, soon back to his praise of the ground. ?I feel more matches should be allocated here. This is a very well-maintained ground. It will automatically inspire you to play better. The more matches you will play in such grounds, the better for football as a whole,? Bhowmick opined. 

Making an uncharacteristic departure from his stand, Bhowmick hailed Dipak Mondal?s goal in the match, saying: ?Seeing such goals gives me immense pleasure.? 

Asked whether Shylo Malsawmtluanga had left his shooting boots back home, the coach admitted the player had been having some problem in converting, but hastened to add, ?it will be sorted out soon?.

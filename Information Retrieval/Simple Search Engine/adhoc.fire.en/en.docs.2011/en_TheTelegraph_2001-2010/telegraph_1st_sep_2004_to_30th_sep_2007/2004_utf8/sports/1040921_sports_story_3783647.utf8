The Telegraph - Calcutta

 ?Pakistan built on Sachin absence?

 - It?s nice to be recognised by the world body, says Venkatraghavan 

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI 

Birmingham: ?Whether he scores or not, Sachin Tendulkar?s presence itself makes a difference... His absence gave Pakistan a big psychological boost and they went forward from there,? observed former India captain Srinivas Venkatraghavan. 

Looking back on Sunday?s Champions Trophy ?quarter final? at Edgbaston, which saw India knocked out, Venkat added: ?Our batsmen should have built their innings instead of going for airy-fairy shots right at the beginning and flicking straight to a fielder... 

?Then, in the second session, we ought to have attacked when Pakistan?s best batsmen (Inzamam-ul-Haq and Yousuf Youhana) were doing a repair job... Indeed, we couldn?t have contained Pakistan and, so, should have been more aggressive with field placements.? 

Speaking to The Telegraph on Monday afternoon, Venkat maintained that the toss did make a difference, although Sourav Ganguly publicly declared he would himself have batted. 

Not surprisingly, Venkat had much praise for Irfan Pathan and his terrific opening burst which fetched three wickets: ?He was, to my mind, brilliant... Obviously, he?s a huge talent and must be looked after.? 

Venkat, honoured by the ICC (after the Pakistan game) for his contribution to umpiring, said he is ?happy? to have put Indian umpiring ?on the world map.? 

A former Match Referee too, Venkat retired from the Elite Panel earlier this year. 

?It?s nice to be recognised by the world body... After all, umpiring is a thankless job... In fact, I?m happy for the steady Simon Taufel, who recently received the (ICC?s) Umpire of the Year award,? Venkat remarked. 

Asked whether he approved of technology getting to play a bigger role, Venkat responded: ?Look, I certainly don?t endorse the third umpire calling the no balls... The pace slows down and, more important, doesn?t give the batsman time to capitalise... 

?However, where umpires being wired to pick up snicks and edges is concerned, the technology should be foolproof to allow the cricket-related sounds only to come through... Otherwise, the purpose is going to be defeated.? 

Incidentally, the Board back home has appointed Venkat to head the umpires? academy or, in other words, be the national director for umpiring. He hasn?t received anything in writing, though.

 Brazil recall 5 ?rebels? for tie vs Venezuela

 - World Cup qualifiers 

 Parreira is more worried about Venezuela than Argentina or Germany 

Rio De Janeiro: Brazil coach Carlos Alberto Parreira is more worried about rank outsiders Venezuela than the likes of Germany or Argentina. 

The world champions have never lost to Venezuela, who they face in their next World Cup qualifier on October 9, and won 6-0 on their last visit to Maracaibo ? the steamy oil city where the match will be played ? four years ago. 

But Parreira is still not relishing the trip. 

?If we win 3-0, people will just say we?ve done our duty,? he told reporters on Thursday after announcing his squad for the game and the following match at home to Colombia in Maceio on October 13. 

?If we just win 1-0, people will say it?s a disaster. 

?I worry more about this than playing Argentina or Germany. They (Venezuela) stay back in defence, they try to stop us playing and they try to catch us on the break. 

Brazil lead the South American World Cup qualifying group with 16 points from eight games, while Venezuela are sixth with 10. 

The Venezuelans, who have enjoyed a vast improvement under coach Richard Paez, have won three games, including matches away to Colombia and Uruguay. 

?It?s a team which has gained in personality,? said Parreira.?They?re much better than they were. They?ve got used to winning, they?ve got good players, they?re well organised and at home they?ve always got a chance of winning. ?We have to take this game seriously and make sure we?re well motivated so that we don?t get caught out.? 

Parreira recalled the five players who were axed from the national team for refusing to take part in a friendly international. 

AC Milan?s Kaka, Dida and Cafu, as well as Lucio and Ze Roberto, who play in Germany with Bayern Munich, had been punished for snubbing the friendly against Haiti in August and were dropped from the last qualifier against Bolivia. 

Parreira said the qualifiers were also a good opportunity for striker Ronaldo and fullback Roberto Carlos to put their Real Madrid troubles behind them.?It?s a chance for them to prove that Real Madrid?s one thing and the Brazilian national team is another,? he said. ?They can prove that, if there is something wrong, it isn?t here.? 

Dutch-based full back Maxwell was the only uncapped player included while reserve goalkeeper Julio Cesar is the only player of the 22 who is based in Brazil.

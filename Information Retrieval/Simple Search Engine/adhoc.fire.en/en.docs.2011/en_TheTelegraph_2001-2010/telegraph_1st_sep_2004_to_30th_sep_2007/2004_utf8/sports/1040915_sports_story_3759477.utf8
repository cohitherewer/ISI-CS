 London: Fifa has won a six-year legal battle over the unauthorised use of its World Cup trademark in website domain names by a US network.

 Former network StarMedia and its successor Cyclelogic Inc. have been ordered to remove websites using the domain names CopaMondial.com and CopaDoMundo.com. ?StarMedia?s use of the domain names involving the unauthorised use of Fifa?s protected World Cup marks in association with Fifa?s flagship event was ended through a final judgement issued by the US District Court for the Southern District of Florida,? Fifa said in a statement on Tuesday.

 The judge ordered the American network to pay legal costs.

 Brussels: Moroccan international Rachid Belabed has been sacked by his Belgian first division club La Louviere for assaulting a journalist, it was announced here. 

 The 23-year-old took fierce exception to remarks made by journalist Claude Moniquet during a televised debate on terrorism and assailed him with several blows accusing him of being racist and an enemy of Islam. 

 Belabed, who started his career at Anderlecht, had already attracted adverse publicity when he disappeared without trace for six weeks last year.

 New Delhi: Sixth seed Mustafa Ghouse and eighth seed Ajay Ramaswami were shown the door while three other seeds were given a run for their money in the first round of the $10,000 Indian Oil ITF men?s Futures tournament here on Tuesday.

 Qualifier and local lad Gurmeher Singh rallied superbly to sent Ramaswami packing 1-6, 6-4, 6-3, before Vijay Kannan upset Ghouse 6-3, 6-4.

 Top seed Norikazu Sugiyama of Japan, second seed Sunil Kumar Sipaeye and fourth seed Aqeel Khan of Pakistan were stretched by relatively unknown players before moving into the second round.

 In other matches, third seed Vishal Uppal thrashed Takeshi Itoh of Japan 6-3, 6-4 while fifth seed Vinod Sridhar defeated Shivang Mishra 6-3, 6-3. 

 Sydney: Mark Philippoussis has withdrawn from Australia?s Davis Cup team for the World Group play-off against Morocco later this month.

 The former Wimbledon and US Open finalist injured his gluteal muscle and had to retire in his US Open match against Nikolay Davydenko earlier this month. He said he wouldn?t be fit in time for the September 24-26 match in Perth against the Moroccans.

 Wayne Arthurs will probably fill the second singles spot, with Lleyton Hewitt playing the first singles.

 Hyderabad: Hosts India made an early exit while last edition?s runners-up Qatar failed to qualify for the knock out phase of the 9th Asian handball championship at the KVBR Stadium here on Tuesday.

 Defending champions Kuwait, Japan, Iran and South Korea qualified for the semi-finals beginning on Wednesday.

 Bangalore: Reigning champions China began their title defence on a shining note crushing Saudi Arabia 84-56 in a group B match in the 18th junior men?s Asian basketball championship which began here on Tuesday.

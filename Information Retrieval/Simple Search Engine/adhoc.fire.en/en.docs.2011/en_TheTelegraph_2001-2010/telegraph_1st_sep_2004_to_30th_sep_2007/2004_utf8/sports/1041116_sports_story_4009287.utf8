 I?ll nail Fleming: Warne

 - FIRST TEST 

- Glenn McGrath to target Nathan Astle 

 Warne feels Fleming can hold the whole innings together 

Melbourne: Australian leg spinner Shane Warne said he will make New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming his top target for Thursday?s first Test. 

?For me Stephen Fleming is the man I?m nailing,? Warne said on Monday. We?ll enjoy a beer afterwards but I?m going to try and nail him,? added Warne, who has taken a world record 541 wickets in 115 Tests. 

?No more nice guy to him. No way, I?m giving it to him. We?re going to test him out and see how he?s going. He?ll be one of their most important players because if he does open or bat at number three (and) gets through the new ball he can hold the whole innings together.? 

The 31-year-old Fleming, who is in some doubt for the Brisbane Test owing to a viral infection, averages 39.75 in his 87 Tests. 

In another development, New Zealand?s preparations for Thursday?s Test against Australia received a boost Monday when batsman Nathan Astle said he was a likely starter in the match despite a back complaint. 

The 33-year-old Astle missed the tourists? nine-wicket loss to New South Wales in Sydney last week because of the injury, but said he had an 80 per cent chance of playing in Brisbane on Thursday. 

?It?s still a little bit sore,? Astle told reporters at Brisbane airport on Monday. ?But it?s got a little bit better,? added Astle. 

?It?s just short, sharp pains and a general ache as far as twisting, turning and running. If I get a jab (injection) that will help me.? 

 Stephen Fleming

Paceman Glenn McGrath has said his main target would be the 33-year-old Astle, who made 156 not out in the Perth Test against Australia three years ago. 

Captain Stephen Fleming (viral infection) and spinner Daniel Vettori (sore shoulder) also missed the four-day match in Sydney. 

However, Australia?s big-hitting opening batsman Matthew Hayden said he would be keen to put Vettori under pressure. 

?He?s not going to be able to turn the ball as much as he will do in Adelaide (in the November 26-30 second Test),? Hayden said. ?He?s a key to their attack who will be under pressure here.? 

Hayden has also accused international bowlers of dodging him by adopting ultra-defensive tactics, adds another report from Sydney. 

Hayden said New Zealand might follow India?s tactics by bowling deliveries well outside off-stump and waiting for the 33-year-old to perish. 

Craig McMillan will stay with the New Zealand team, officials said Monday, adds another report from Sydney. He was summoned as cover when New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming delayed his arrival in Australia because of a virus.

Ernie Els, who was feeling as low as he has ever felt when playing up the mountain at Crans Sur Sierre a month ago, is back on track following a 64 through the worst of the weather in the American Express World Golf Championship. 

With a two-round aggregate of 133 over the Mount Juliet course, the South African is two clear of Todd Hamilton and Miguel Angel Jimenez. 

In Switzerland, Els owned up to ?a feeling of failure? after coming close to winning all four Majors but making off with none. In the last couple of weeks, however, he has made an effort to put a different spin on his situation. 

?Since I was right there right to the death in three of the four Majors, I definitely did something right,? he said. ?I?ve got to feel encouraged by what happened rather than discouraged. Anyhow, I?m fine, now.? 

No one was about to argue with that assessment as he went about his business on a day of vicious squalls broken by the odd spell of sunshine. After 13 years of visiting the European Tour, Els says he knows how to handle the weather. 

?You start learning after a while and now, when there?s a day like this, I see it as a chance to catch up,? he explained. 

He avoids the aggressive approach and instead takes his time on every shot. The catching up started at the first, where he made the first of four successive birdies on these exquisite Irish greens. Five under at the turn, he made it eight at the 534-yard 17th where, having landed in the rough to the right of the green in two, he fashioned a near perfect chip to nine inches. ?A bit more steam and it was in,? said his caddie, Ricci Roberts. 

At the last, where he caught the rough off the tee and left himself with a rather longer chip, he hit to eight feet and holed one more good putt for his inward 34. ?A 64 in these conditions adds up to one of the better rounds I?ve played this year,? he agreed. 

Freddie Couples had been the first to show that a low score was on the cards when he emerged from the rain with a 67. Afterwards, he talked about his own bad back along with Tiger Woods?. 

He had watched snatches of Woods? Thursday 68 on television and marvelled at how he had managed to complete the 18 holes. 

?I know what it?s like when your back goes into spasm and gets stiff. Just watching him was brutal for me,? said Couples, who has had problems for most of his career. 

Woods, who added a 70 to his opening 68, was a little looser Friday. He had started his early morning practice session by hitting from an indoor bay before moving to the practice putting green where, unlike on Thursday, he was bending over from the waist to retrieve his ball from the hole rather than the knees. 

That he was feeling better overall was obvious from the way he was beaming on the two fellows who were busy hovering up the leaves as he was trying to putt. 

The noise of the machinery was probably the last thing Woods needed before he set out but he was far too polite to say anything to deter them. 

Woods started his second round with a drive which disappeared into a copse. But he got up and down from short of the green for par and was soon making the first of three birdies in an outward 33. Friday, it was putting which was doing most to make him wince. 

?It was terrible,? Woods said, in a reference to two three-putt greens and a couple of missed tiddlers. 

Todd Hamilton, who finished alongside Miguel Angel Jimenez on 135 to Els? 133, described Friday?s weather as an irritation more than anything else. 

He spent the first seven holes putting on his waterproofs and taking them off and then, at the eighth, he and Jimenez were in trouble for slow play. 

 explained to the referee about all the dressing and undressing but without getting much in the way of sympathy. The hope was that Hamilton would be playing alongside Els Friday. 

As it turned out, Jimenez and Els were drawn together and Hamilton was suitably grateful. ?I think Ernie?s probably got it in for me,? he said, in a reference to what happened in the Open at Troon.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

Powar spins Mumbai to huge victory

 Powar bagged five wickets 

Mumbai: Ramesh Powar and Nilesh Kulkarni spun Karnataka out for a paltry total for the second time in the match to bowl holders Mumbai to a comprehensive 205-run victory on the fourth and final day of the Ranji Trophy Elite Group A tie Saturday. 

Off-spinner Powar was the wrecker-in-chief in the meagre Karnataka second innings total of 185, chasing 391, with a haul of five for 84. 

Gangling left-arm spinner Kulkarni, who had taken five wickets in the Karnataka first innings total of 166, gave his younger partner good support with figures of three for 53. 

Barring skipper Sujith Somasunder?s 40 and a defiant, hard-hitting unbeaten 45 from Sunil Joshi, there was little of note in the Karnataka second innings. 

Joshi, in particular, played with ease on the spinning track against a Mumbai attack weakened by the absence of injured captain Sairaj Bahutule. 

Earlier, Mumbai declared their second innings at their overnight score of 264 for eight. 

Mumbai secured four points and increased their tally to 21 with a match in hand against Delhi while Karnataka went out of contention for a semi-final berth after failing to get a point.

 ?Minor flaw? in Malik action: PCB panel

Islamabad: Young spinner Shoaib Malik has a ?minor flaw? in his bowling action and will have to undergo corrective measures, a PCB advisory panel has observed. 

The panel, which includes former players Aaqib Javed, Iqbal Sikander and Ejaz Faqih along with PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan, met in Lahore on Friday and reviewed the video footage of Malik?s action. 

?The footage has been viewed and studied in detail. We also felt that there is a minor flaw in his action which is not serious at all and can be corrected in a few days time which is good news for Pakistan cricket,? local daily The News quoted a member of the panel as saying. 

?We have endorsed the ICC view that Shoaib needs to consult bio-mechanic and bowling experts to make the slight correction. We have sent these recommendations to the PCB,? he said. 

Malik was reported by umpires Aleem Dar and Simon Taufel and Match Referee Jeff Crowe to the ICC last month for a suspect bowling action after the one-day final against Sri Lanka in Lahore. 

This was the second time during Malik?s career that he was reported for a suspect action by the ICC, the first being in 2002 after a tournament in Sharjah. (PTI)

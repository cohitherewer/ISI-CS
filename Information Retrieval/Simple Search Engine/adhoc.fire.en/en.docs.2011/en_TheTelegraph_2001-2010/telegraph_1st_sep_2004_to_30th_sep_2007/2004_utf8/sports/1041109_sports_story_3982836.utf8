 Harbhajan raises the Perth issue

New Delhi: India?s ace off-spinner Harbhajan Singh is livid over all the talk about the Wankhede wicket. 

?I wonder if they had still whined if Australia, and not India, had won the Mumbai Test,? Harbhajan said from Mumbai, where he helped skittle out Australia for only 93 runs last week and script a 13-run win for India. With the track continuing to draw flak from past and present Australian cricketers, Harbhajan says enough is enough. 

?When we go to Australia, we never complain about the Perth pitch. Or if we are in England, we don?t cry from the rooftop about the grassy and seaming conditions. So why this outcry now?? retorted Harbhajan in his inimitable style. 

Harbhajan, who took 21 wickets from three Tests in the series, including the match-winning five for 29 as the Australians failed to chase a meagre 107 for win, said Mumbai has always provided a pitch where the ball grips the surface and offers bounce. 

?It has always been the case in Mumbai. Why, I remember when we played a one-dayer against Australia on their last visit in 2001, we couldn?t chase 240 batting second because it spun big-time. We never complained about the quality of the pitch then.? 

Harbhajan believes the Australians did not have the right defensive technique and judicious selection of strokes in the last innings of the match. 

Meanwhile, Harbhajan may join Surrey, who are awaiting BCCI?s approval before announcing the spinner as their overseas signing for 2005. Harbhajan would join the club as a replacement to Pakistan?s Saqlain Mushtaq, who has had operations on both his knees and has barely played in 2003. (PTI)

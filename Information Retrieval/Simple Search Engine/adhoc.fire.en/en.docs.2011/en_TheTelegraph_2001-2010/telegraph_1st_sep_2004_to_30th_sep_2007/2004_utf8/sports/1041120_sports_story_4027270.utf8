 St John?s: China has pledged another $3 million to build a new cricket stadium in Antigua to host matches in the 2007 World Cup in the Caribbean, officials said. Last year, China promised an initial $20 million to build the new stadium.

 ?We took the opportunity to finally sign off on the cricket stadium where the government of China is assisting almost 100 per cent in constructing,? Prime Minister Baldwin Spencer told state-run radio Antigua Broadcasting Service. The funds will come from a grant and an interest-free loan, said David Shoul, Antigua and Barbuda?s ambassador to China. 

 London: Liverpool striker Milan Baros will be out of action for up to four weeks with a hamstring injury, the Premier League club?s website reported on Thursday. Baros sustained the injury playing for the Czech Republic in a World Cup qualifier against Macedonia on Wednesday.

 ?Milan returned to (training ground) Melwood this afternoon (Thursday) and underwent a scan,? a club spokesman said. ?Unfortunately that has shown a pull in the hamstring of his left leg and he is likely to be out for between three and four weeks.? 

 Seoul: South Korea would consider sending a unified Korean team to the 2006 World Cup if the North made a formal request, South Korean officials said on Friday.

 North Korea coach Yun Jong-su said that he wanted to see a united Korean team if both North and South qualified for the finals in Germany.

 ?If the North makes a formal request for a unified team, we would be willing to consider it,? Korea Football Association (KFA) public relations director You Young-cheul said. 

 North Korea coach Yun advocated a joint team after his side was beaten 0-1 by the UAE in an Asian Zone World Cup qualifier in Dubai on Wednesday.

 Canberra: Five Australian athletes from Olympic sports tested positive for drugs leading into the Athens Games, while every Australian Olympian was subjected to random test, the national sports drug agency reported. The Australian Sports Drug Agency (ASDA) revealed it conducted 1,644 tests between January 1 and August 13 this year on athletes who were available for Olympic selection, resulting in seven adverse findings involving five athletes. None of the athletes competed at Athens.

 The ASDA?s annual report said it conducted 6,615 doping tests in 63 Olympic and non-Olympic sports in the past year with 14 athletes flunking doping tests and five failing to comply to testing.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Chanu accuses IOA of double standards 

 - The whole episode is a disgrace... everything has fallen apart: Malleswari 

 Karnam Malleswari feels upcoming lifters will be able to undo some of the damage 

 New Delhi: Lifter Sanamacha 

 Chanu, who was slapped a life ban by the Indian Olympic 

 Association (IOA), on Wednesday accused the authorities 

 of adopting double standards saying they should have followed 

 the same yardstick while dealing with other dope-related 

 allegations against athletes. 

?I never took anything. But if they have banned the three of us (Sunaina and Pratima Kumari being the other two), they should also ban those who had tested positive earlier like N. Kunjurani Devi, Sateesha Rai and C. Sailaja,? Chanu said here. 

Chanu and Pratima were banned for life for testing positive for banned substances during the Olympic Games in Athens. Sunaina had tested positive during the Asian championship in Almaty, Kazakhstan. 

Chanu said she should not have been given the harsh punishment since the decision to impose life bans on lifters for their first doping offence was taken by the Indian Weightlifting Federation (IWF) on September 12, much after the conclusion of the Olympics. 

?I tested positive in the Olympics and the decision to impose life ban was taken after the Games. If my case was considered, then what about others who had tested positive in earlier meets? Moreover, the international federation does not prescribe life ban for first-time offenders,? she said. 

Chanu said despite the ban, she would continue her fight to clear her name. ?I will not sit quiet. I don?t know the test results of the injection vial which I had submitted to the inquiry commission. If the results shows something, I won?t sit quiet.? 

Pratima, meanwhile, declined to comment anything on her ban but said she was hurt that no one raised her concerns before the IOA. ?I don?t want to say anything as nobody raised any point in my favour,? she said. ?I am disappointed that those who came to me after the Athens doping results, did not come forward for my cause,? she said. 

Meanwhile, Sydney Games bronze medallist Karnam Malleswari said the whole doping episode had been a ?disgrace for both the sport and the nation?. 

 ?We struggled a lot and worked hard to bring India 

 a good name, but now everything has fallen apart. It will 

 be very difficult for us to start all over again. But I 

 am confident that upcoming lifters will be able to undo 

 some of the damage,? she said.

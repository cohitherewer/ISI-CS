The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Bengal falter

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Tuesday?s fine performances of their spinners, Murtaza Lodhgar and Sourashish Lahiri ? and another wicket added Wednesday for Lahiri ? got Bengal a 46-run first innings lead over Andhra Pradesh in their their Elite Group A Ranji Trophy match in Visakhapatnam. But the tourists? batsmen faltered thereafter, as eight wickets were down with only 144 on the second innings board. 

Four Bengal wickets fell to S.K. Sahabuddin (for 25 runs) and to D. Kalyankrishna (for 20), each picking up two wickets. 

Earlier, Andhra Pradesh folded up for 188. 

According to information received here, at stumps on the penultimate day, Sanjib Sanyal (24) and Sabir Ali (1) were at the crease. Sanyal in his 125-minute stay resisted from taking any rash shot.

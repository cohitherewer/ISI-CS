 Madrid: Barcelona striker Henrik Larsson has undergone an operation in the United States to repair a knee ligament injury that will leave him on the sidelines for the rest of the season.

 ?The operation was highly satisfactory,? the club said in a statement. ?His anterior cruciate ligament has been reconstructed.?

 The 33-year-old Swedish international, who sustained the injury during his side?s 3-0 victory over Real Madrid on November 20, had originally feared the injury might bring a premature end to his career.

 The former Celtic player has since said he is determined to play again and Barcelona have extended his contract for another season in the belief he will make a full recovery.

 Fitness test for Murali

Colombo: Sri Lanka have abandoned plans to take off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan on the first leg of their New Zealand tour. 

Muralidharan, recovering from a shoulder injury, was to have travelled with the team, but will instead need to prove his fitness before joining them. (Reuters)

 Warne threat on Adelaide turner

 - SECOND TEST 

- Australia eye clean sweep vs New Zealand

Adelaide: Australia are looking to bury New Zealand under an avalanche of runs before unleashing the spin menace of Shane Warne in the second Test to sweep their series against New Zealand. 

The signs don?t look promising for the Black Caps, who were smashed by an innings and 156 runs in the first Test. The visitors controlled the first two days before being skittled out for a record low 76 in their second innings. 

 The Adelaide Oval traditionally offers a batsmen-friendly wicket which takes turn later and with scorching hot weather forecast for the entire five days, the emphasis will be on spin. 

Warne, Test cricket?s leading wicket-taker with 549, will be Australia?s trump card, while New Zealand will use two spinners ? Daniel Vettori and Paul Wiseman. 

Warne revels on the Adelaide Oval where in 10 Tests he has taken 41 wickets at 28.97 but the New Zealanders warn about over-emphasising his influence. 

?Warne got eight wickets in Brisbane, six of the tail... Look, we can play him better, he?s the world?s leading wicket-taker, so he?s going to provide some skills,? skipper Stephen Fleming said on Thursday. ?While it is a focus, it?s not the be-all end-all, there are other areas where we didn?t do so well in, so we have to concentrate on them as well.? 

Australia score heavily in Adelaide where they have not gone under 400 in their first innings in their last five Tests. 

Yet, even though they amassed 556 in last year?s Test against India, they went down by four wickets after a sloppy second innings of 196 gave the Indians a window of opportunity. ?We respect the fighting qualities of the New Zealanders, they have achieved some good things over the last couple of years in both forms of the game,? Australian skipper Ricky Ponting said. 

Fleming, who scored a duck and 11 at the Gabba, has called on his top-order batsmen to take the lead in Adelaide. ?If we are going to compete in this series we need to score 350-400 minimum, so we need two good innings,? he said. 

Brett Lee was again left out of the Australian XI as Glenn McGrath, Jason Gillespie and Michael Kasprowicz continue their fine bowling form. 

?Brett?s frustrated with the way his season is going, but the good thing is that he has been able to go back to New South Wales and play a couple of games, so he?s got a bit of bowling under his belt,? Ponting said. 

New Zealand effected two changes in their XI. Left-arm swing bowler James Franklin has been brought back in place of Kyle Mills and Craig McMillan replaces Wiseman.

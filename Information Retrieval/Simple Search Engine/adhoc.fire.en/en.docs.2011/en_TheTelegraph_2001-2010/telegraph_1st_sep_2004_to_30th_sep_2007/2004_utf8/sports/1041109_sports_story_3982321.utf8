The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Utpal has been Lodhgar?s guide

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: After Making his debut, Murtaza Lodhgar had to wait five years to play his second match for Bengal when he saw his name among the XI against Karnataka on Sunday. ?I have played a few one-dayers but not a four-day match,? Murtaza said. 

Murtaza, on the day when he stepped up to fill the vacuum created after veteran Utpal Chatterjee?s retirement, gave much of the credit to Utpal. ?He has been guiding me since I was a kid,? Murtaza stated. 

?Since my Ranji Trophy debut against Tripura in 1998-99, I have been following Utpalda.? 

Murtaza informed that on Sunday Utpal too turned up and they had a brief chat about how to bowl on this wicket, which offers very little help to the bowlers. 

Captain Rohan Gavaskar and coach Karsan Ghavri had also showered a lot of praise for the new hero. ?I don?t want to call him a new comer as he has been around for last few years and whatever he did today was the result of hard work,? Rohan said. 

Rohan also enjoyed the time in the field with Sourav Ganguly coming up with valuable suggestions quite often. ?Being the India captain, he always offered me tips regarding field-placements and bowling changes, that was very nice of him.? 

But both Ghavri and Rohan don?t want to set any target now as they feel only half of the work is done and they have to finish it in style. ?We will have to bat well tomorrow and put up a good score,? Ghavri said.

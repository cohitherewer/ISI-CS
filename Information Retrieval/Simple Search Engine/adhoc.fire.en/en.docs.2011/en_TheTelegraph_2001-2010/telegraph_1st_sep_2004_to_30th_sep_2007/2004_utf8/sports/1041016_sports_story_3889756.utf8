The Telegraph - Calcutta

 City-based SAI doctor in the dock

 RAJEEB MUKHERJEE 

Calcutta: A doctor of the Sports Authority 

of India (SAI) eastern region, designated as a junior scientific officer, is in 

the dock for making indecent approaches towards female hockey players under the 

guise of carrying out tests. 

The allegation pertains to the medical test conducted 

by one of the two male doctors of SAI eastern region on a group at Government 

Girls? High School, Ranchi. 

In the camp, held from March 17 to 19, some of the girls were ?harassed? by the doctor under scrutiny. The others then refused to undergo tests under him and demanded a lady doctor be present. That eventually led to the camp being called off. 

The girls also filed a written complaint with the 

principal of the school, Ms Sumanlata Balihal. The principal (according to documents 

available with The Telegraph) wrote a letter to SAI?s New Delhi-HQ, complaining 

about the doctor?s behaviour. New Delhi then directed Calcutta to seek an explanation. 

It also directed that, henceforth, medical tests of female sportspersons be carried 

out only by a lady doctor. 

Accordingly, the city-based doctor was told to furnish an explanation by September 10. Now, the ball is in New Delhi?s court. ?The (doctor?s) reply has been sent to New Delhi for action,? explained SAI eastern region?s acting director, H.K. Borgohain. 

When contacted by this paper, however, the doctor denied being involved in any indecent activity. 

Incidentally, Borgohain is at his wits? end trying to implement the SAI directive of letting only lady doctors handle women sportspersons. 

?At present, SAI Calcutta has only one lady doctor. Then, the other male doctor is associated with the national football team and often has to stay away (from SAI) for a long duration. This makes it difficult for the lady doctor alone to handle all the cases pertaining to females? In her absence, the boarders, for example, have no option but to visit the doctor accused of making indecent approaches,? the acting director said. 

Borgohain is contemplating seeking the services of 

lady doctors from outside its rolls during outstation camps.

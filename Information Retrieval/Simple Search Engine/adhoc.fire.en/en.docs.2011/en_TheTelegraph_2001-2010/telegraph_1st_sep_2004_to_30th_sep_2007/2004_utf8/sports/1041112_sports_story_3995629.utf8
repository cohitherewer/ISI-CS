The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Afridi: No clear favourites

 Shahid Afridi at the Eden on Thursday. 

Calcutta: Shahid Afridi felt that the Saturday one-dayer between the arch-rivals will be a close one with no clear favourites. 

?Any team can win on the day,? the Pakistani allrounder said at a city hotel on Thursday. 

India and Pakistan will clash in the day-night encounter at Eden Gardens as part of Board of Control for Cricket in India?s (BCCI) Platinum Jubilee celebrations. 

Despite admitting the Indians have the home advantage to go with their strong batting line-up, Afridi expressed confidence that they will be able to continue their winning spree against the hosts. ?We have won the last three matches and the boys are fired up to make it four in a row,? Afridi remarked. 

The allrounder, meanwhile, was all praise for speedsters Irfan Pathan and Zaheer Khan. 

?They have been quite impressive off late?, he added.For Afridi, this is the second trip to the city in a year?s time. He led the Pakistan-A side in the tri-series last December involving A teams from India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. 

Dravid my hero: Younis 

?Rahul (Dravid) is my idol?, quipped Pakistan wicketkeeper-cum-batsman Younis Khan. ?I know how difficult it is to play the dual role (?keeper and batsman) and Dravid has stood up to the task brilliantly,? Khan said. 

Khan is all fired up for his first outing at Eden Gardens. ?I want to win the Man-of-the-Match award here,? he added. 

Khan feels coach Bob Woolmer has made a huge impact in the team and his performance. ?Earlier, I was only a batsman, but it was on Woolmer?s insistence that I took up the big gloves. And now I am enjoying both?.

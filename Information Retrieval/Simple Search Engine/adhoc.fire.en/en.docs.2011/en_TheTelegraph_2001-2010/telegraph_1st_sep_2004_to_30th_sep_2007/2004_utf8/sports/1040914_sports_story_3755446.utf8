 Ortega ends soccer exile

Buenos Aires: Argentine World Cup forward Ariel Ortega ended his 19-month exile from soccer on Sunday, making a quiet comeback for Newell?s Old Boys in their 1-1 home draw with Banfield. 

Ortega showed flashes of his genius but was unable to inspire Newell?s in a fixture between two teams who regularly occupy positions in the middle of the table. 

A 30,000 crowd saw the match in Rosario, his first since he last played for Argentina in a friendly in the Netherlands in February last year. 

Ortega had a hand in the move, which led to striker Ignacio Scocco scoring Newell?s equaliser in the 22nd minute, five minutes after Rodrigo Palacios had put the visitors in front. 

Newell?s, coached by Argentina?s 1978 World Cup midfielder Americo Gallego, are seventh in the Apertura championship with eight points from five games. 

Ortega, who was suspended by Fifa in February 2003 and ordered to pay $11 million in compensation to Turkish club Fenerbahce for breach of contract, has been given a temporary 10-day licence by the world governing body while the two clubs finalise his transfer. 

The 30-year-old Ortega, who made 86 appearances for Argentina and scored 17 goals, joined Fenerbahce from River Plate after playing in his third World Cup in 2002. The $7.5 million deal was one of the Turkish club?s biggest transfers. (Reuters)

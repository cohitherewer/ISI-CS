 India to bid for under-17 World Cup

A CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: India will bid for the 2007 under 17 World Cup, according to the AIFF president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi. The decision was taken at a general body meeting in the capital on Sunday. 

India has to officially bid for the event before December 31. Das Munshi will meet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and seek government?s support. 

Meanwhile, the AIFF ratified a proposal to revamp the constitution on recommendation of the Vision India report. 

In order to bring a more professional feel, the AIFF will do away with the post of an elected secretary after federation?s elections in December. Instead a general secretary (who will not hold an honorary post) will be appointed on contractual basis. 

The new-look AIFF will have 19 members in its executive body, including an elected president and treasurer, five vice-presidents and two members each elected by the five zones (East, West, North, North-East and South). 

Four new bodies were also set up; disciplinary committee, arbitration tribunal, appeals committee and players? status committee. 

A decision on Stephen Constantine?s future will be taken only after India finish their pre-World Cup campaign against Oman on November 17.

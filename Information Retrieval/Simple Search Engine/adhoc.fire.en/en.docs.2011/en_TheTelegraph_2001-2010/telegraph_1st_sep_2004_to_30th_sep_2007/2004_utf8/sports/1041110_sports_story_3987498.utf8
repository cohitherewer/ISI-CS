Calcutta: Bengal enjoy a slight advantage going into the final day against Karnataka in the Ranji Trophy Elite Group tie at the Jadavpur University?s Salt Lake campus ground on Tuesday. 

Chasing a target of 343, the visitors were 41 for one when stumps were drawn. Bengal need nine wickets while their opponents require 302 to start the season on a winning note. 

In reply to Bengal?s 315 in the first innings, Karnataka were skittled out for 179, thereby conceding a 136-run lead to the hosts. But Bengal also failed to get their act right and could only reach 206 in their second essay. 

Bengal received an early jolt this morning when first innings centurion Arindam Das was run out for three. Little later, Deep Dasgupta was bowled by a Dodda Ganesh delivery, which just skidded onto the stumps from a fuller length. 

Rohan Gavaskar?s cameo of 24 off 20 balls may be appreciated in limited overs? game, but not in a four-day contest. He hit four boundaries but on his fifth attempt when he came charging down the wicket he missed it. Wicketkeeper Naidu had no problem to knock the bails off. 

Before lunch, Bengal also lost their fifth wicket in Team India captain Sourav Ganguly. Sourav started well driving Joshi through the covers. The left-arm spinner ultimately had the last laugh. Trying to lift a flighted ball over mid-off, he failed to clear Shyam Ponnappa and departed after scoring only five. Laxmi Ratan Shukla then joined Devang Gandhi in the middle. 

Devang stayed there in the middle to consolidate the Bengal innings, but when he started looking good, he was trapped leg before by Joshi. The decision by umpire Jamula seemed a bit harsh. 

Enter Sanjib Sanyal. Shukla (60) and the Bengal allrounder appeared to be in prime form and the 57-run stand was highest of the innings. Shukla played some very good shots on the off side. Sanjib (21) also extended a helping hand and when the pair looked in absolute command, came another shocking decision, this time from umpire Saheba. It looked, the ball wrapped on to Shukla?s pads before landing in Soma Sundar?s hands. 

Thereafter it was just a formality to wipe off the Bengal tail. Murtaza Lodhgar (22), though, played his part to take the total to 206. 

The Karnataka openers ? J. Arun Kumar and Barrington Rowland were also cautious and it required Sourav to take charge of the proceeding for a breakthrough. 

Just before the sixth over, the Team India captain brought the deep square leg fielder Sourashish Lahiri a bit inside and had a brief chat with Paul. Paul pitched the first delivery short and the Karnataka captain pulled to find Sourashish. 

Rohan cautioned 

Meanwhile, Match referee Sunil Chaturvedi of Uttar Pradesh has cautioned Rohan after the third day?s play. This was after Paul had an exchange of words with Karnataka captain Arun Kumar. ?Rohan was told to keep Paul and other bowlers in check, but neither the team nor the bowler was penalised for that,? a source said.

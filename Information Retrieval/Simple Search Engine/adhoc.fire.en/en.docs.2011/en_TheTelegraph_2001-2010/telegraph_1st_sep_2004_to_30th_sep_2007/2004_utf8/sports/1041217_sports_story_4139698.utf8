The Telegraph - Calcutta

 I do things my way, says Karthik 

Chittagong: Sprightly wicketkeeper Dinesh Karthik idolises Adam Gilchrist, but insists that he has his own way of achieving suc- cess with the gloves and the bat. 

?It is not easy. Gilchrist is a class act and what he has done as a ?keeper and batsman will be difficult to emulate, but I have my own way of doing it,? the 19-year-old said on the eve of the second Test on Thursday. 

Team India coach John Wright feels Karthik has adapted to international cricket well enough. 

?He has filled in well. We see a potential here. He has brought an energy to the side and the players enjoy having him around,? he said of the teenager. 

On his not being part of the ODI side, the Indian ?keeper said, ?It is pretty disappointing but the selectors expect me to get some runs and that is OK.? 

There are some shortcomings in his game and Karthik feels he needs to work on low gathering. 

?Yes, sometimes the ball just shoots through. The low takes are pretty difficult and I am working on it. It is a matter of footwork and watching the ball more closely,? he said.

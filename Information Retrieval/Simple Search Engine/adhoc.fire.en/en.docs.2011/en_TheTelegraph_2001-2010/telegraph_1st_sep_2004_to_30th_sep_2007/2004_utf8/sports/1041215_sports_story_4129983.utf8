 Roddick fires coach Gilbert

 Roddick won nine titles with Gilbert 

New York: Andy Roddick fired coach Brad Gilbert this weekend after one and a half years together that yielded a US Open crown and the No. 1 ranking. 

No specific reason was given for the split in a statement Roddick released on Monday through SFX Sports group. 

?The decision not to continue with Brad Gilbert for the 2005 season is based on what I think is best for my game at this point of time,? Roddick said. 

?Any more on this situation is a private matter between coach and player. I enjoyed my time with Brad and wish him continued success in his future.? 

Roddick won nine titles with Gilbert, including his first Grand Slam at Flushing Meadows last year. Roddick finished 2003 atop the ATP Tour rankings to become, at 21, the second-youngest American to end a season there. 

But he was relegated to No. 2 this year behind Roger Federer, who became the first man since 1988 to win three majors in a season. Federer, who hasn?t had a coach since firing Peter Lundgren at the end of last year, beat Roddick for the Wimbledon title and in two other tournament finals to improve to 8-1 against the American. 

It wasn?t immediately clear who might replace Gilbert. He did not travel to Spain with Roddick for the Davis Cup final this month. 

?I have enjoyed my time with Andy. He has been a great student of the game during the time that we worked together and I am very proud of the results we?ve achieved,? Gilbert wrote on his web site. 

?While I believe that there is still a great deal of work to be done, Andy clearly does not feel that way.? 

After losing in the first round of the 2003 French Open, Roddick parted with longtime coach Tarik Benhabiles and hired Gilbert, who had helped Andre Agassi resurrect his career.

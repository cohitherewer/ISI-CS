The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Whatmore pained at being outclassed

 - Lara says Bangladesh have a future yet 

 Lara says Bangla have a special place in his heart 

Southampton: Disheartened Bangladesh coach Dav Whatmore admitted he found it hard to watch as his outclassed team suffered a 138-run mauling at the hands of the West Indies in the Champions Trophy here. 

This was even as West Indian captain Brian Lara saying that he believed Bangladesh are making improvements as a cricketing nation, despite that heavy defeat. Lara also talked about a boost in morale for this team. 

?I really thought we would put up a better showing. I found it painful to watch and it was painful for everyone connected with Bangladesh cricket,? Whatmore said. 

?We let the West Indies get too many runs after putting them in and then some batting indiscretions early in our innings handed it to them. We did not use the new ball as we should have done.? 

The West Indies smashed 269 for three off their 50 overs before Bangladesh were shot out for just 131 with 10 overs to spare. 

In contrast to Whatmore, who took Sri Lanka to the 1996 World Cup, Lara was a relieved man after the Rose Bowl victory. Defeats in Test and limited-overs internationals had threatened to damage Caribbean morale but the win over a weak Bangaldesh side raised confidence in time before the crunch clash with South Africa. The winner of that match will book their place in the semi-finals of the Champions Trophy. 

?A win was very important to us after recent results. A win against any opposition was good for us,? said Lara. ?We won easily in the end but we always felt it was going to be tough and it will be again when we play South Africa. We have an inferior run-rate than South Africa, but we will be unlucky if it rains when we play them.? 

?If it does, so be it,? Lara said. 

?I saw a banner when we came off the pitch held aloft by their (Bangladeshi) supporters which said ?Bangladesh World Cup winners 2019? and you never can tell,? said Lara. 

?Bangladesh are a young side and they will learn from playing against sides like ourselves and South Africa. I thought they did well against us in the Tests and Internationals in the Caribbean and some of the matches were closer than they appeared. 

?I told them that they must play as a team and it is important that each of them nips in with a contribution. They need a collective effort but there is not reason why they cannot succeed. Bangladesh hold a special place in my heart.? 

There were some positive comments from Whatmore too. Pace bowler Nazmul Hossain, 16, received a special mention but there were others to catch the coach?s eye. 

?Our captain, Rajin Saleh is only 20 and he will have learned how tough it is at this level. I thought in both matches he was terrific with the field and he made good bowling changes. (AFP)

 Korea beat Vietnam

Kuala Lumpur: World Cup semi-finalists South Korea recovered from having a man sent off and a one-goal deficit to beat Vietnam 2-1 in a World Cup Asian zone group VII qualifier in Ho Chi Minh on Wednesday. 

The unconvincing victory maintained Korea?s one-point lead over Lebanon, who defeated minnows Maldives 5-2 in Male. Coach Jo Bonfrere criticised his side, despite the comeback, and instead praised the commitment of the Vietnamese. ?If our players had the same mindset and level of hard work as the Vietnamese, we would have won this game 5-0,? Bonfrere said. 

Striker Cha Du-ri was dismissed in the 11th minute. Five minutes after the break, Vietnam went ahead when Park Jae-hong put the ball into his own net. Striker Lee Dong-gook equalised after 64 minutes before Lee Chun-soo hit the winner in the 77th minute from a free-kick. 

Oman downed hosts Singapore 2-0 in group III. Yousef Shaaban scored after three minutes, Hamdi Hubais added a second eight minutes from time. Oman thus moved into second place with nine points from four matches. Japan are on top with the maximum 12 points.Olympic semi-finalists Iraq continued their excellent form with a 4-1 away win in Taiwan in a group II encounter. Salih Sadir scored twice in the first half for Iraq and Saad Attiya added a third with eight minutes left, before Hui Kai Tsai pulled one back for the home side. 

Razzaq Farhan restored Iraq?s three-goal advantage with a final-second strike. 

Iraq top the standings with eight points from four matches but Uzbekistan can reclaim the lead with a win over Palestine. 

Qatar gave new Bosnian coach Dzemaluddin Musovic a rousing victory in his first World Cup game in charge by mauling Laos 6-1 in Vientiane.

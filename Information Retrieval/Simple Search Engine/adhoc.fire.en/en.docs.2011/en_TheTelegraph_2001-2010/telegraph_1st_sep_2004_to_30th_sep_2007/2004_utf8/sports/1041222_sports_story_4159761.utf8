The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Rohan amp; Co. in battle for survival vs powerful Delhi 

 - Ranji Trophy

 - Krishnan, Tewari may make cut; Jadeja hopes for victory 

A STAFF REPORTER

 Shib Shankar Paul and Akash Chopra take a break during practice at the Eden on Tuesday 

Calcutta: A magic wand is what Bengal need to revive their sagging fortunes in the Ranji Trophy and the team management is hoping Jagmohan Dalmiya?s pep-talk will do the trick this time too. 

Last season, the hosts managed an outright victory against Hyderabad after the CAB president had ignited the players? passion in almost similar circumstances, but Rohan Gavaskar and Co. know the task will be difficult this time around. 

Delhi are no pushovers ? despite having garnered only eight points in their five matches ? and with an inexperienced bowling that has shown very little penetration when it matters, the hosts will find it tough to call the shots. 

Bengal, who have four points from five games, need at least two points from this match to keep their chances of staying in the Elite group A alive. 

The return of Shib Shankar Paul may be encouraging but the medium-pacer had hardly made much of an impact in the three matches he has played so far. How much of a difference his ?stint? with Team India in Bangladesh has done to his talent will be interesting to watch. 

The Eden Gardens pitch, earmarked for this match, has a ?hard look? about it with a tinge of grass. The ball will seam around in the first session, providing the pacers with enough food for thought. Delhi coach Madan Lal felt it would be wise to bat first on winning the toss. 

Karsan Ghavri acknowledged that the team?s confidence was at a ?low ebb? and playing Delhi in a crunch tie will ?invite that extra pressure? bit. The coach has spoken to the players individually and hopes ?the best will come out? in this game. 

Batting has been Bengal?s Achilles Heel this season and the coach has no ready solution at hand. ?A mere 30 or 40 won?t help. It?s time they understand that they should start delivering,? Ghavri said. 

Rakesh Krishnan is likely to make his debut along with allrounder Manoj Tewari, who played in the one-dayers last season. The former is expected to bat at No.3. 

For Delhi, though, it?s more or less a settled line-up. Gautam Gambhir?s arrival will further strengthen their batting. Stand-in captain Ajay Jadeja is not willing to read much into the past. 

?Every game is a new game. It doesn?t matter whether you have scored a hundred in the last match because you?ll have to start from zero. Similarly, your form, too, doesn?t matter much since a couple of balls can change your fortunes,? the former India star said. 

Delhi haven?t won a match this season and Jadeja hopes ?it will happen here?. 

The confidence, though, isn?t because of Bengal?s track record. ?I don?t look back at past games. I think Bengal will come out fighting here. They have a few youngsters and they will be eager to prove themselves. You cannot always lose in life, you will also come back and win sometimes,? Jadeja said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 ?Tough? task for Taufel

A STAFF REPORTER

 Simon Taufel 

Calcutta: The International Cricket Council?s (ICC) Elite Panel umpire Simon Taufel, believes the use of technology in the game is okay, but that shouldn?t go too far. 

?On-field umpires are in the best position to judge which is out and which is not,? Taufel, one of the umpires for Saturday?s ODI, said. 

According to Taufel, the onset of TV replays has made the job of on-field umpires difficult. ?Now you face a lot of pressure when giving a verdict,? he said. 

Eden Gardens ranks among his favourites. ?I have heard that a lakh people watch the proceedings here and I am looking forward to this one-dayer,? he said. 

Ticket sale 

Ticket sales have been encouraging, according to a senior CAB official. 

The Rs 700 and 900 denomination tickets have been sold out while 30 per cent of the Rs 1500 denomination ones remain.

 Bengal spinners strike back

 - Ranji match vs AP 

 Lodhgar took 4/34 

Visakhapatnam: Bengal took a firm grip over Andhra Pradesh at close on the second day of their Ranji Trophy Elite group A match on Tuesday. 

After having been bundled out for 234 in the first innings, Bengal struck back with a vengeance to reduce Andhra Pradesh to 160 for eight. After Sabir Ali and Ranadeb Bose had struck early to reduce the hosts to 11 for two, left-arm spinner Murtaza Lodhgar ran through their middle-order to return with a haul of four for 34. 

Earlier, unbeaten Laxmi Ratan Shukla was bowled by Sahabuddin after adding just six runs to his overnight score. Sourashish Lahiri battled for his 22 but found very little support at the other end. 

Sahabuddin claimed four wickets while Venugopal Rao took three. 

Ranadeb and Sabir were on target from the outset. Venugopal came good with the bat, too, being the top scorer of the side with 39. Ranadeb, who has had a good season so far, was the pick among the Bengal pacers. 

On a pitch that is already showing signs of crumbling, the spinners took charge. Sourashish Lahiri also took two wickets. 

Lodhgar bowled a tight line, and with Sourashish also being in his elements, the Andhra batsmen found the double-spin attack tough to handle. (Agencies)

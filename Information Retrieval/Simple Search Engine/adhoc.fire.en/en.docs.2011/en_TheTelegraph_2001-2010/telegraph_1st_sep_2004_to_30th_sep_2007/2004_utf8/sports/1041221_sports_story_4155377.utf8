The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Moitra quits as trainer

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Bengal?s Ranji Trophy squad was dealt a blow when fitness trainer Ranadeep Moitra decided to call it quits. Moitra did not accompany the side to Visakhapatnam and will not be available in the last two matches against Delhi and Madhya Pradesh. 

Ranadeep is playing in the local league for Dakshin Kalikata Sansad (DKS). He is also busy with office work, and hence, doesn?t wish to continue in the absence of ?any long-term contract?, according to a source. 

Assistant coach Satinder Singh is doing the job of a fitness trainer at the moment. 

CAB joint secretary Bablu Kolay, however, felt that since Bengal are playing back-to-back matches there is very little role for a trainer. ?It is very important for the squad to have a trainer at the beginning of the season,? Kolay said. 

Meanwhile, CAB president Jagmohan Dalmiya met the 14 players chosen to play versus Delhi along with coach Karsan Ghavri. 

?Mr Dalmiya has appealed to the players to give off their best in the two matches and press for victories,? a source said. 

Dalmiya also asked the players to sort out all their problems and come out with flying colours . 

Dalmiya had earlier spoken to the state selectors, captain Rohan Gavaskar and coach Ghavri. 

Shib Shankar Paul and Delhi?s Gautam Gambhir arrived in the city late in the evening. Paul along with Manoj Tewari and Rakesh Krishnan are likely to make the final XI on Wednesday.

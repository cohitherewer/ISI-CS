Calcutta: They call themselves the Army club of Syria. Indeed, discipline is their forte. As Al Jaish held East Bengal 0-0 in their AFC Cup quarter final first-leg tie at the Salt Lake Stadium on Wednesday, one could see the slushy field had forced a set plan and the idea was to stick to it. The evening was for scoring strategic points, not collecting plaudits. They wanted that all-important away draw and got it. 

In between, an East Bengal ?goal? was disallowed and an Al Jaish effort got the wrong side of the mud. 

The home team began well, creating chances that almost always began with the midfielders and ended with them. Subhas Bhowmick?s now all too often complaint of ?I don?t have anyone to score? was sounding so true. With Bijen Singh the sole man upfront, crosses from Dipankar Roy and Alvito D?Cunha from the flanks were often falling flat. 

On the other side of the field, the two Al Jaish forwards Mohammed Zenou and Zyad Shaabou were not proving too effective either. Shaabou would often switch sides with his fellow striker, fall deep to retrieve a ball, but all his 22 goals this season seemed a thing of the past. 

In midfield, Douglas da Silva was making his presence felt. Despite playing with an injured ankle, the Brazilian was using his height to perfection. In fact, Al Jaish coach Costica Stefanescu also had a word of praise for Douglas at the post-match conference. ?Your No. 15, the Brazilian, was very good,? he remarked. 

In the 41st minute, the match recorded its most dramatic moment. Alvito came rushing from the left into the box. An accurate cross met Dipankar right in front of goal as Al Jaish goalkeeper Radwan Al Azhar took a bold decision to come out of his line and challenge him. 

The diminutive midfielder took a weak shot, almost as if the sight of an empty goal embarrassed him. Captain Tarek Mohammed Jabban managed a desperate goalline save, but Bijen was lurking in the area to neatly slot it in. 

The 25,000-odd diehards erupted, Uzbek referee Lutfullin Nail signalled goal. Seconds later, after an Al Jaish protest and a conference with his assistant, Nail changed his mind ? for an obstruction on the goalkeeper by Dipankar. And rightly so. 

Al Jaish were more effective in the second half. Stefanescu revealed an inch of attacking idea when he replaced the ineffective Shaabou with the strong-built Mohammed Mansour. Within a minute, a short pass from the corner was floated into the box by Mansour, but headed out by Zenou. A clear chance for Al Jaish and Zenou should have scored. 

By the 78th minute, Bhowmick seemed to have resigned to a draw, replacing Dipankar with Debjit Ghosh. He had already introduced Shylo Malsawmtluanga in place of Bijen. 

Almost immediately Stefanescu also made a substitution, replacing Zenou with Majed Al Haj. Soon, Al Jaish got their best chance. As Dipak Mondal and Madhab Das got themselves involved in a terrible misunderstanding, Majed coolly collected the ball and beat Sangram with a neat placement. To the Syrians? misfortune, the ball slowed down on the heavy field and never reached the goal. 

Into injury time, East Bengal got their last chance when an unchallenged Malsawmtluanga made a surging run from the left into the box. Instead of taking the shot himself, he placed it for Alvito. The medio looked for fellow-Goanese Climax Lawrence who came running into the box but failed to reach it. 

East Bengal played better football, but failed to breach the Al Jaish gameplan. As expected, it wasn?t about tactics or skill, but strength and discipline. Hopefully we?ll see a different game in Damascus next Wednesday.

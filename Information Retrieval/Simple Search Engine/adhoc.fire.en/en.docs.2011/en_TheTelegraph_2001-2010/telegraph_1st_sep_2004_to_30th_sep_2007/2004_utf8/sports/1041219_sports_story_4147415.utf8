 Strauss puts England on top

 Andrew Strauss celebrates his century on Saturday 

Port Elizabeth: Andrew Strauss joined an elite band of players to score centuries in their first Tests both home and away on Saturday as England took firm control of the first Test against South Africa in Port Elizabeth. 

England ended the second day on 227 for one, in reply to the home side?s first innings of 337, with Strauss batting on 120. Mark Butcher was at the other end on 24. 

South African-born Strauss was at the crease for almost five hours, facing 215 balls and hitting 16 fours, as the home attack dropped short throughout the day to feed his favourite pull and cut shots. 

The left-hander, playing his eighth Test and who scored 112 in his first Test against New Zealand at Lord?s in May, looked in peerless form by the end after putting on 152 with Marcus Trescothick (47) for the first wicket. 

Only six other players have made hundreds in their Test debuts home and away, with Michael Clarke achieving the feat for Australia earlier in the year. Strauss also became the first player in Test history to score a century in his maiden Test against three different countries. He has yet to lose a Test, with England seeking a national-record eighth win in a row in Port Elizabeth. 

South Africa had resumed on 273 for seven and were dismissed just before lunch, with Boeta Dippenaar making 110. 

Marcus Trescothick and Strauss then rode out tight and aggressive opening spells from fast bowlers Shaun Pollock and Makhaya Ntini before scoring more freely off the rest of the attack. 

Earlier Dippenaar reached his century in the 14th over of the day with an uppercut for four through backward point off strike bowler Stephen Harmison. He was out four overs later when he edged a drive off fast bowler Simon Jones and was caught by Trescothick at first slip to end an eighth-wicket partnership of 63 with Thami Tsolekile. (REUTERS)

 India miss Sachin, we too miss Ponting: Gilchrist

Chennai: Australia?s stand-in skipper Adam Gilchrist said Tuesday if India were missing the services of Sachin Tendulkar, then his side too was missing the services of regular skipper Ricky Ponting, who is recovering from a broken finger in Australia. 

?If India are missing Sachin, Australia too are missing Ponting. He has been going through a series of scans and other tests to assess his fitness and to see whether he would be available for the next Test,? Ghilchrist said. 

The Australian was speaking to the media during a visit to a slum community, supported by World Vision, in suburban Otteri. World Vision is a relief and development organisation working towards ?a full life? for girls and boys around the country. Gilchrist has joined the organisation as its ambassador. 

Asked whether he would bat or bowl first, if he won the toss in the second Test starting here Thursday, he said it was too early to say. ?I am yet to inspect the pitch.? 

Talking about Australia?s success, he said it was due to ?meticulous planning and the system of training, competition and selection that are in place in our country. We are still looking for sports herbs and spices to channelise talent.? 

On the current series and his role as the captain, he said ?it is one of the biggest series for us and for me as captain.? 

Speaking about the slum programme, Gilchrist said: ?I am doing what my parents have been doing. They have adopted a child from the same NGO.? 

He said former Australian captain Steve Waugh had told the players about the popularity of cricket in India among the masses, including the underprivileged. 

?Waugh wanted us to channelise in doing something for them in this country. I am hoping my visit will increase awareness of the need for Indians and Australians to support organisations like World Vision who are working to help children build a better life,? he said. 

Gilchrist also played ?mock? cricket with the slum children. 

Captaincy issue 

Meanwhile, Gilchrist has said that he has no ambition to replace Ricky Ponting on a full-time basis, adds a report from Sydney. 

The 32-year-old wicketkeeper-batsman told the November issue of The Wisden Cricketer magazine: ?It?s a bit too much to take on but the main reason is I don?t have a huge interest in captaincy. There are a number of other guys like Ricky, Shane Warne and Darren Lehmann who are so astute in their cricket knowledge. 

?I don?t see myself like that.? 

Made vice-captain in August 2000, Gilchrist has captained Australia four times as a stand-in during his 57 Tests, winning three of them. His one slip-up came against England in 2001 when, standing in for the injured Steve Waugh, he made a sporting declaration only for Mark Butcher to score a match-winning 173 not out. Australia won the five-match series 4-1. 

On coach John Buchanan, regarded as one of cricket?s most innovative thinkers, Gilchrist told the magazine: ?He has some amazing ideas and he?s got some absolutely rubbish ones as well, which we tell him. But he?s got a hell of a lot more good than rubbish. He never forces anything on you.? (Agencies)

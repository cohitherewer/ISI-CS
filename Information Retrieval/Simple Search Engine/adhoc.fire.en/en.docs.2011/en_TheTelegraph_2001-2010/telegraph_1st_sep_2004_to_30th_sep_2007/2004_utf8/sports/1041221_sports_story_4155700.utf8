 ?Need to carry on in same vein?

 - ODI series will be a new start: Sourav

Chittagong: Indian captain Sourav Ganguly Monday asked his players to carry forward the success of 2004 to the coming season after the visitors finished the year on a high note with a 2-0 Test series whitewash against Bangladesh. 

India ended the season with six wins from 11 Tests which included three series wins ? against Pakistan, South Africa and Bangladesh. 

?We played very well in 2004, especially in Test cricket. We need to continue in the same vein. We are playing well for the last two and-a-half years. We must carry on,? Sourav said after India?s innings and 83-run win over Bangladesh in the second and final cricket Test here. 

The Indian captain, though, said the team needed to be a little more consistent in one-dayers. ?They have all done very well. It?s really difficult to single out any one person. (Virender) Sehwag, Rahul (Dravid), Sachin (Tendulkar), (V.V.S.) Laxman and (Gautam) Gambhir all played well. 

?There were failures here and there but that is part and parcel of the game. (Irfan) Pathan was also outstanding,? he said. ?We have been a bit inconsistent in one-dayers. Fielding needed to be a bit better. We need to apply ourselves more in the one-dayers,? he said. 

Although Bangladesh crashed to their 31st defeat in 34 Tests, Sourav said the minnows have the talent to make a place for themselves at the highest level. 

Pathan, who bagged the Man of the Series award for his 18-wicket haul in the two Tests, said he was happy the way his career has progressed since making the debut against Australia. 

?Everything is going in the right direction. It?s very good so far and I am happy with my performance. But this is due to the support I have been getting from the team,? Pathan said. 

On the ODI series, Sourav said: ?It is difficult to say (predict the outcome). It is going to be a new start, and what happened in the last game has not much significance.?

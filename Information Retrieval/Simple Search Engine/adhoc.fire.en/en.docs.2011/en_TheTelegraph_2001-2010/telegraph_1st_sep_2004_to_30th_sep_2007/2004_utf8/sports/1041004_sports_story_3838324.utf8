 Intikhab Alam takes over as Punjab coach

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

Mohali: Intikhab Alam has taken charge of the Punjab Ranji Trophy team. It was, in a way, a ?homecoming? for the Hoshiarpur-born former Pakistan captain. 

?I am not saying I will transform the Punjab team into a winning combination overnight, but I will try to remove the technical problems players may have which is hampering their performance,? Intikhab said here Sunday. 

To begin with, Intikhab will hold a camp comprising 15-20 players. ?The idea would be to get to know them individually,? he said. 

Renewing his call for more sporting ties between India and Pakistan, Intikhab said: ?I would like to see the Ranji champions meeting the Qaid-e-Azam Trophy winners every year. Both governments should also allow visa-free travel for students who could take part in school championships.?

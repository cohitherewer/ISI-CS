 Henry target of racial taunts 

London: Arsenal striker Thierry Henry says he was the target of racial taunts in this week?s Champions League game against Panathinaikos at Highbury. 

The France international scored from the penalty spot as Arsenal drew 1-1 with the Greeks on Tuesday, but instead of celebrating the goal he stood stock still staring at the visiting fans. 

Explaining his behaviour Henry told Saturday?s edition of the Sun: ?Of all the 162 goals I have scored for Arsenal, I have not celebrated two of them ? and that was against Panathinaikos, and there is an explanation for that. 

?They were making monkey noises at me? he said.

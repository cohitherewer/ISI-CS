 Vijay strikes four on Day I 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: With four of the six favourites delivering the goods on Thursday, the opening day of the winter season could not have provided a better start to RCTC punters. 

 The two loser were, however, unfortunate. A friendless Louis Cyphre had a virtual cakewalk with his light impost to leave the favourite Reminiscent struggling with her topweight in the opener, the 1,600m Sholay Handicap, while stars were, perhaps, heavily against another hot-property, Thrilling Proposal, who came a cropper soon after the start in the RWITC Cup, the feature event. All three hailed from Vijay Singh?s yard. But, Vijay amply made up for the losses with a day?s haul of four. His other winners were Almara, Mega Role and Alashaan ? all favourites, ridden by C. Alford.

 Vijay?s loss in the main event was his brother?s, Bharath?s, gain when a less fancied Magic Mantra decided to put his best foot forward in the hands of apprentice Md Islam. Trainer D. David, too, opened his account with the victory of Beyond The Clouds.

 Fulham shock Newcastle

London: Midfielder Steed Malbranque scored twice as Fulham shocked Newcastle United 4-1 in the Premier League on Sunday to hand manager Graeme Souness his first home defeat since taking charge two months ago. 

In other matches, Manchester United were held to a goalless draw by Manchester City, while Dutchman George Boateng volleyed an equaliser two minutes into stoppage time to salvage a 1-1 draw for Middlesbrough against 10-man Bolton Wanderers at the Riverside. 

Bolton held on to fourth spot with 22 points, three ahead of fifth-placed Boro after 12 matches, while Newcastle remained ninth, 13 points off the pace. 

Chelsea, who beat Everton 1-0 at home on Saturday, are top on 29 points, two ahead of second-placed Arsenal, who were held 1-1 at Crystal Palace. Everton remain third with 23 points. With the drawn result, United are 11 points adrift of Chelsea. 

Fulham?s outstanding player was former Nottingham Forest and Boro goalkeeper Mark Crossley, who made a string of superb saves including three in the opening quarter of an hour as Newcastle put the visitors under siege. 

Striker Collins John gave Fulham the lead against the run of play when he broke away in the 28th minute to steer a ball from Pape Bouba Diop through keeper Stephen Harper?s legs. 

Malbranque put the nails in Newcastle?s coffin with two goals in six minutes, netting Andy Cole?s pass in the 65th and adding a 71st-minute penalty. Luis Boa Morte added the fourth. (Reuters)

The Telegraph - Calcutta

Rooney could be our greatest

- The youngster is unselfish, has a good football mind and great awareness 

Guest Column

Gary Lineker

After Wayne Rooney?s unbelievable debut for Manchester 

United, it is inevitable that people are measuring his talent against that of 

Paul Gascoigne. But as much as I loved Gazza, there is no comparison between the 

two.

Paul was probably the best of his generation. But 

he burned out too quickly and after the 1991 FA Cup Final injury, we only got 

fleeting glimpses of his best stuff. But if Rooney avoids injury and the pitfalls 

of fame, there is no doubt that he could become the greatest player this country 

has produced. 

As a striker, he is obviously a different player to 

Gascoigne, but I have to say that, although Paul was a fantastic dribbler, he 

would often overdo it by taking on one player too many and he was also selfish, 

giving you the ball only in a position where your only option was to give it back 

to him. So he often made the wrong decision, whereas Rooney always chooses the 

right option, he is unselfish, has a good football mind and great awareness. 

On top of all that, he is a great finisher. And in 

at least half of the games he has played for England, he has been head and shoulders 

above the rest. That is remarkable for a kid who will not be 19 until later this 

month. 

I cannot think of any striker in the world, past or 

present, who would not have relished playing alongside him because, as well as 

being the best finisher in the England team, he also links up the play brilliantly. 

And he can adapt to whatever situation he finds himself in.

For example, you only have to go back to the opening 

game against France in Euro 2004, when England used two lines of four, all playing 

very deeply, Rooney had huge ground to recover when he lost the ball, which should 

not really have been his job. But he did it, kept going and looked incredibly 

comfortable against some top French defenders. 

Then, having done everything but score against France, 

he got two against Switzerland in the next game, when he virtually won the game 

on his own. 

Worryingly, we also discovered how much we rely on 

Rooney when he went off after 27 minutes against Portugal in the quarter final. 

As soon as he went off, we didn?t know what to do, we lost all shape and there 

was no link man to the forwards. Rooney was the sensation of the tournament. 

Rooney should not be saddled with extra pressure

He is the new boy wonder and his return of nine goals 

in 16 internationals is even better than Michael Owen?s. 

Not that I am jumping on the bandwagon of those who 

want to see Owen dropped in favour of Jermain Defoe. It is clear Owen is just 

a goal-poacher, a bit like me, who is not going to beat four players and score. 

Yet he has always delivered and you don?t tend to drop a player with a scoring 

ratio of 27 goals in 63 games. Sven-Goran Eriksson knows that an important part 

of management is showing loyalty to players who have done well for you until there 

is a genuine reason to leave them out. 

The real bonus is that, whereas we have bemoaned the 

fact that England have no option other than Owen, we now have a brilliant one 

in Defoe, another youngster who will push him all the way. And that can only be 

a good thing for Eriksson and England. In fact, I have not been so optimistic 

about England since I threw my last Three Lions shirt into the wash. We have got 

three top strikers to choose from ? Frank Lampard is playing so well for Chelsea 

that he is closing in on world-class status and Eriksson has finally solved the 

puzzle in left midfield by doing what many of us have been urging for three years 

by using Wayne Bridge and Ashley Cole. 

At the back, we are blessed with five top-class defenders. 

And as only two can play at any one time, Eriksson could try another piece of 

lateral thinking by using Ledley King as the holding player in midfield. Not only 

would that solve another problem position, it would allow Lampard to play as an 

attacking midfielder. 

As for Rooney, he deserves all the over-the-top praise 

that has come his way. We are entitled to get carried away with someone of his 

talent. He is a special player and if he looks after himself, he will go on to 

become one of the great players of world football. It is almost impossible to 

predict just how big he could become, and I am not talking about his weight.

 School from Dimapur reach semis

 A CORRESPONDENT 

New Delhi: Government Senior Secondary School, Dimapur routed debutants St. Stephens School, Chandigarh, 5-0 to storm into the semi-finals of the 2004 Subroto Cup meet on Friday. 

In the last quarter final (U-17 section), the Dimapur school struck early in the second minute when nippy striker Lemtong beat the offside trap to score first of his three goals. 

In the 26th minute, skipper Saku bulged the net with a long-ranger. After the interval, the swifter and more skilful Dimpaur school completely dominated proceedings. Lemtong scored a brace and midfielder Peter added another from close in the 49th minute. 

In the first semi-final to be held on September 28, Govt SSS Dimapur will face Govt Higher Secondary School, Malacca, Car Nicobar. 

Meanwhile, the malaise of over-aged players continues to haunt the Subroto Cup. In the U-14 category, eight players from Tripura Sports School, Badharghat, Agartala were found over-aged and scratched. 

Despite this, the Tripura school, coached by Suvenjit Saha, reached the quarter finals with just eight players, beating St, Mary?s school Bhavnagar, Gujarat 10-0. 

The organising secretary, Wing Commander Rahul Pathak, today confirmed that a record 125 players were found over-aged in this edition of the Subroto Cup.

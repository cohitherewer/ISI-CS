 Sydney: Australian rower Catriona Oliver was given a two-year suspended ban on Saturday for slapping teammate Sally Robbins at an Olympic function.

 Rowing Australia president Pat McNamara said Oliver had admitted hitting Robbins on the shoulder after the team was welcomed home from Athens at a dinner in Sydney two weeks ago.

 A disciplinary committee ruled that Oliver be banned from representing Australia for the next two years but the penalty was later suspended because of her previously clean record.

 Relations between Robbins and her team mates have become increasingly strained since she stopped rowing during the final of the women?s eight in Athens, ending the team?s chances of a medal.

 Chennai: India defeated Sri Lanka in straight games on Saturday to finish seventh in the 12th Asian junior women?s volleyball championship being played in Colombo.

 Colombo: Former Test opener Brendon Kuruppu has been appointed manager for Sri Lanka?s tour to Pakistan in October and November. The 42-year-old will take over on a temporary basis from Ajit Jayasekera, who had requested a break to spend time with his family after a four-year spell in charge.

 ?Brendon Kuruppu has been appointed on an interim basis and his name has been sent to the sports ministry for ratification,? Sri Lanka Cricket chief executive Duleep Mendis said on Saturday.

 Atlanta: Laila Ali, daughter of former heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali, won the International Women?s Boxing Federation light heavyweight championship by knocking out Gwendolyn O?Neil at 1:59 of the third round.

 Dallas: A Dallas company that specialises in underwriting prize money is withholding a $5 million bonus to Lance Armstrong until it investigates claims that the Tour de France champion used performance-enhancing drugs.

 SCA Promotions Inc. said it will wait to pay the bonus to Armstrong for his sixth Tour victory amid claims in the unauthorized biography LA Confidential: The Secrets of Lance Armstrong that the American used banned drugs.

 The book, written by journalists Pierre Ballester and David Walsh, contains statements from a former masseuse for Armstrong?s US Postal team who made the doping allegations against the American cyclist.

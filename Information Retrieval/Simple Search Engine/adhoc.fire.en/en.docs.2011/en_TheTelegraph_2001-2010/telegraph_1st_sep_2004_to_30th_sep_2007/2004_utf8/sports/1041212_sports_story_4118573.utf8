 Collins banned

Salvo (North Carolina): Former world indoor 200 metres champion Michelle Collins was suspended for eight years on Friday after being found guilty of doping charges in connection with the BALCO scandal. 

The US sprinter?s suspension should provide athletes who do not cheat with ?a renewed hope? they have an equal chance of winning, the US Anti-Doping Agency?s (USADA?s) top lawyer said on Friday. An arbitration panel found former world indoor 200 metres champion Collins guilty of doping on Friday although she never failed a drugs test. 

The 33-year-old Collins becomes the first athlete in the international doping scandal surrounding BALCO to be suspended without a positive test or an admission of using banned performance-enhancing drugs. 

The ruling confirms ?that there is a fair process and that sport is not going to tolerate those that cheat,? USADA director of legal affairs Travis Tygart said in a telephone interview from his office in Colorado Springs, Colorado. 

A panel of the American Arbitration Association (AAA)/North American Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) found ?USADA has proved, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Collins took EPO, the testosterone/epitestosterone cream, and THG, and that Collins used these substances.?

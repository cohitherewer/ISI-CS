 No pressure from anybody: Vaughan

London: England?s cricketers flew out for their no-win tour of Zimbabwe Monday with captain Michael Vaughan saying they did not condone president Robert Mugabe?s crippling economic policies but had not been bullied into playing. 

?We certainly don?t condone anything that?s going on in Zimbawe. But we are professional cricketers and we are going out there to play cricket and then go to South Africa,? Vaughan told reporters at Heathrow airport before flying out. 

?We do understand that we have an obligation to get out there and we do have a big worry for what?s going on in Zimbabwe.? 

Vaughan and his players have come under huge pressure to refuse to play England?s five one-day games in Zimbabwe. 

Paceman Steve Harmison dropped out on moral grounds and Andrew Flintoff, having already been rested for the Zimbabwe leg of the tour, said he would not have gone either. 

England Test batsman Graham Thorpe, who is no longer a one-day player, accused the International Cricket Concil of ?bullying? the ECB into sending a team by saying it ran the risk of fine and suspensions by pulling out. The left hander said the ECB then forced the players to go. 

Darren Gough, who is on the tour, said that few of the players would have gone if ICC had not threatened England with fines. The veteran paceman said he would refuse to shake Mugabe?s hand. 

Vaughan, who is captain to both the Test and one-day teams, denied the players were forced to tour. 

?As soon as I knew an England team would travel to Zimbabwe as captain I made myself available. I didn?t want someone else to captain England for what?s going to be a tricky 11 days. 

?I?m not particularly looking forward to it but we?ll get the job done and look forward to a real good part of the winter which is South Africa.? 

After eight days preparation in Namibia, England go to Zimbabwe two days before the first of the five games starts on November 26 in Harare. 

In early December, England fly to South Africa for five Tests and seven one-day Internationals when Thorpe, Harmison and Flintoff are expected to join the tour. 

?I don?t think any of the players are too happy about going,? Vaughan said. ?We are just looking to get the games out of the way and look forward to the South Africa Test series.?

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Yuvraj likely if Sourav loses appeal

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Kanpur: It?s not official, but Yuvraj Singh is expected to replace Sourav Ganguly in the Team India XIV for the Calcutta Test in case the captain?s appeal against a two-Test suspension isn?t upheld by Appeals Commissioner Tim Castle. 

The hearing, via a tele-conference, is fixed for noon on Thursday. 

?If the need arises, Yuvraj is the one who is surely going to be recalled,? a source told The Telegraph on Wednesday evening. Somewhat in the ?running?, by the way, is Sridharan Sriram. 

Meanwhile, as expected, the national selectors have retained the first Test?s XIV. The second, at the Eden, gets underway on Sunday. 

The selection of the Bangladesh-bound squad, as of now, is scheduled for November 30.

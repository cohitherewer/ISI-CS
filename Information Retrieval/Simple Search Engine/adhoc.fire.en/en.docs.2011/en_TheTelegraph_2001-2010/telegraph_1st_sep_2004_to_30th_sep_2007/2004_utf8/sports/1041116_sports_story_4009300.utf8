 Bengal take on Railways

New Delhi: Bengal will take on Railways in the Ranji Trophy elite group A match from Tuesday at the Karnail Singh Stadium. 

Bengal coach Karsan Ghavri said Sourav?s unavailability would not affect the team?s performance as it was on a high after claiming four points from their win against formidable Karnataka in the opening tie. 

?We have been playing all these years without Sourav. He is a great player and an inspiration for the entire team. His presence would have been a morale booster to youngsters,? Ghavri said. 

Ghavri was pleasantly surprised by the track, wh- ich wore a green look as against its dust bowl reputation. 

?The players are quite confident after the win against Karnataka. We are not taking our opponents lightly though as they have made it to the final a number of times in recent years.?

Mumbai: Mumbai relied on their two seasoned campaigners ? Wasim Jaffer and Amol Muzumdar ? to come out of an early slump inflicted by a tight Australian bowling on the second day of the three-day warm-up game at the Brabourne Stadium on Friday. 

Jaffer made a defiant 48 while Muzumdar cracked an unbeaten half-century to help Mumbai close the day at 150 for four in 57.2 overs after an extended last session of play to make up for lost time on the opening day. 

Earlier, the visitors made 302 for seven declared, built around a solid 71 by Damien Martyn, to make most of the only warm-up match of the tour. 

In reply, Mumbai were tottering at 80 for three before Jaffer and Muzumdar pulled the team out of the hole. 

Muzumdar completed his half century towards close to remain unbeaten on 50 off 92 balls. Vinod Kambli (26) fell in the last over of the day in fading light to Shane Watson after he and Muzumdar added 70 runs for the fourth wicket in 21 overs. 

This was after opener Jaffer had defied Aussie pacemen Glenn Mcgrath, who was penetrative as well as economical, and Brett Lee for over two-and-a-half hours after the early loss of opener Vinayak Mane. 

Jaffer batted resolutely in his 116-ball knock before he was trapped leg before by McGrath, who also accounted for his opening partner Mane, having him caught at square leg. 

Muzumdar batted with confidence and struck five fours, while Kambli was kept on a tight leash by the Australian bowlers before he perished, signalling the end of the long day?s play. 

Earlier, Australia declared their first innings 26 minutes after lunch, after resuming at their overnight total of 159 for three. 

Martyn looked at ease against the slow bowlers on a pitch affording good turn, while captain Adam Gilchrist made a brisk 42 off 76 balls with two sixes. 

The Aussies, 282 for six at lunch, declared their innings at the fall of their seventh wicket in Brett Lee (11), who was caught by Vinit Indulkar off Ramesh Powar after adding 54 runs in only 59 minutes with Gilchrist. 

The left-handed Gilchrist, who looked a bit suspect against spin bowling initially, opened out later and smashed some cracking shots. 

The Mumbai bowlers struck in the second hour of the morning, removing Brad Hodge for 30 after he resumed at his overnight eight. The batsman was dismissed by Ramesh Powar, Vinit Indulkar taking a catch at short leg. 

Indulkar showed fine reflexes to run out Michael Clarke for 10, flicking the ball back as the batsman stepped out to left arm spinner Nilesh Kulkarni. 

Watson was trapped leg before by a Kulkarni armer. In fact, all the three Mumbai spinners on view finished among wickets with Powar and Kulkarni grabbing two wickets apiece while captain Sairaj Bahatule picking one, the wicket of Matthew Hayden yesterday. 

When Mumbai batted, Mane and first class debutante Vinit Indulkar could not prosper in the face of some hostile bowling from the Aussies, especially McGrath, who grabbed two of the three wickets that fell in his two spells of six and seven overs, respectively. (PTI)

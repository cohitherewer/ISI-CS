 Arjen Robben recalled

Zeist (Netherlands): Premier League duo Arjen Robben and Mario Melchiot were recalled to the Dutch squad on Friday for next Wednesday?s World Cup group I qualifier against Andorra in Barcelona. 

Robben has impressed coach Marco van Basten in the few matches he has played for Chelsea. The 20-year-old winger, whose last international was the Euro 2004 semi-final defeat by Portugal, has scored in his last three games for the London club. 

Melchiot left Chelsea after five years in July and has impressed at new club Birmingham City. Van Basten had some concerns about the form of others in the squad as seven of the team who started in last month?s 3-1 home win over Finland have lost their places in their club first teams.

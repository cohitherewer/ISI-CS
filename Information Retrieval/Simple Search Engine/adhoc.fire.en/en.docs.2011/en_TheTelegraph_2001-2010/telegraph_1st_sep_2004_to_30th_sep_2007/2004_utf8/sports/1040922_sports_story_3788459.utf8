 Windies, Pakistan hope to redeem summer

 Lara would like to end on a high 

London: The West Indies want to redeem a disappointing summer with a place in the Champions Trophy final, while Pakistan are equally eager to continue their resurgence under coach Bob Woolmer. 

The two sides meet in the second semi-final of the Champions Trophy at The Rose Bowl in Southampton on Wednesday. The winner will meet England in the final at The Oval on Saturday. 

Brian Lara?s team has had a poor season this year, drubbed 0-4 by England in the Test series in August. It?s consolation was reaching the NatWest triangular series final at the expense of England in July, but the team lost to New Zealand in the final. 

?We would like to end on a high,? Lara said. ?It has been a very long summer, and we suffered a lot during the Test series. We got to the final of the NatWest series, and it will be really nice if we can get one stage further ? although we know we are up against tough opposition.? 

Pakistan beat India by three wickets on Sunday to reach the Champions Trophy semi-final. They also had a disappointing summer, losing to Sri Lanka in the final of the Asia Cup in July. 

Former England opener Woolmer, who?s also coached South Africa, said he was impressed by the leadership of Inzamam-ul-Haq since taking over in mid summer. 

Inzamam on the other hand said he is relishing captaincy. ?I think I?ve concentrated more and that?s helped my batting and I take more responsibility,? he said. 

?Lara is a dangerous man and he is a great player with a lot of achievement in international cricket. The West Indies are a good team and their batting is very dangerous,? Inzamam added. 

The West Indies had a hard time reaching the final four, needing two days and a rain-shortened match to get past South Africa. 

?I think it will be an exciting match,? Lara said. ?Both teams have played well so far ? and although it is known here that the pitch is not going to be all that batting friendly, the game should be very well-contested.? 

The only injury worry for the Windies is pace bowler Mervyn Dillon, who took a career best five wickets against Bangladesh before being sidelined with a shoulder injury. 

?It will be a very different surface to the one at Edgbaston. We have to bear that in mind and concentrate hard,? Woolmer said. Inzamam said the pitch wasn?t a ?good batting wicket in my opinion, it?s a difficult track.? And he should know.

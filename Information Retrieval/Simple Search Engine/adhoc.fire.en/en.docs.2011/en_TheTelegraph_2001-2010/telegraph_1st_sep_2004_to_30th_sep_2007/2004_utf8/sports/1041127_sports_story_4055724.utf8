The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Enjoying myself more: Pollock 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Former South African captain Shaun Pollock is enjoying his game thoroughly. The speedster, who was replaced by Graeme Smith at the helm after the 2003 World Cup, said there?s less pressure on him. 

?I am enjoying myself more. The responsibility is definitely less and I am using my energy to guide youngsters in the team,? Pollock said at a joint press conference with Jacques Kallis at the Eden on Friday. 

Neither Pollock nor Kallis have played at Eden and are awaiting the ?experience?. ?I had a talk with Sachin (Tendulkar) last night and he was telling me about the crowd and how passionate and noisy they are. We are looking forward to it,? Pollock said after the Proteas had a two-hour training session at Eden. 

The speedster is on the verge of a record. He has already reached 300 Test wickets. And now the former captain is just 24 runs short of the 3,000 runs in Tests. 

Pollock, who has played 86 Tests till date, is hoping to reach the landmark in the second and final Test against India at the Eden starting Sunday. 

 The pacer can become be the first South African to achieve this ?double?. He has 351 Test wickets so far. ?I am obviously looking forward to it,? Pollock said, adding, ?I wish to carry the team to a position of strength.? 

Pollock felt the Eden pitch is similar in nature to that of Kanpur. Both he and Kallis said the youngsters performed well in the last Test and they can look to consolidate on that. 

Kallis, meanwhile, said he has recovered from the side strain. ?I am now fit to bowl a few overs,? he said when asked whether he would be bowling at Eden. 

Incidentally, ticket sales are yet to pick up for the second Test.

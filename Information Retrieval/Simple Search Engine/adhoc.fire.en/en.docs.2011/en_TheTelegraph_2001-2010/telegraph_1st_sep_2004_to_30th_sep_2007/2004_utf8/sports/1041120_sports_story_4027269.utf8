 Socrates? second coming 

London: Brazilian Socrates arrived in England on Friday and is ready to resume his playing career at the age of 50 with minor league side Garforth Town. 

Socrates captained the 1982 Brazil World Cup side, which included Zico, and will go straight into action on Saturday in a Northern Counties East League Division I clash with Yorkshire rivals Tadcaster. Around 3,000 spectators are expected to pack Garforth?s Wheatley Park to see a player who in his prime was more used to playing in front of 80,000 in the Maracana. He retired in 1990. 

?I am really looking forward to putting on the Garforth Town strip. I don?t know anything about the place and I?ve never been to the north of England, but I?m always up for new experiences,? said Socrates, who has signed a one-month deal with the side from a former pit village near Leeds. 

?It will be fun to see what the quality of the game is like against Tadcaster. I?m not sure how long I?ll manage but I?ll give it my best shot. I?m 50 years old, so I evidently won?t be the fastest man on the pitch. But I?m sure I can remember a few tricks.? 

Garforth Town, second in their division, are owned and managed by businessman Simon Clifford who runs a network of Brazilian soccer skills schools around the world. Clifford?s obsession with Brazilian football started when he became friends with former Middlesbrough midfielder Juninho and was introduced to Futebol de Salao, an indoor version of the game played in Brazil which improves ball skills. 

Socrates? arrival is part of Clifford?s 25-year plan to take Garforth to the Premier League title in 2028. They are currently on one of the lowest rungs of English soccer?s league structure. (Reuters)

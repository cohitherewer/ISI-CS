 Germany hand over opener to Brazil 

 - Klinsmann declines to train at Leverkusen 

 Klinsmann hopes to turn Germany?s fortunes 

Hamburg: Germany declined the opportunity to play in the opening game of the 2006 football World Cup and instead passed the honour to Brazil. 

The decision follows a World Cup tradition, which began in 1974, that will see the defending champions contest the June 9, 2006 match at Munich?s Allianz Stadium. 

?We?ll make way for Brazil. The defending champions can open the World Cup,? Germany team manager Oliver Bierhoff said on Sunday. 

Germany are likely play to play their first match three days later at Berlin?s Olympiastadion, the site of the final. 

The move was the latest shake-up by Germany coach Juergen Klinsmann, who upset some by announcing his team won?t hold its World Cup training camp at Bayer Leverkusen?s Bayarena despite an agreement with the Bundesliga club. 

?We know there?s promises to Leverkusen,? Bierhoff said. ?But the first glance shows the solution isn?t optimal. Not because of Leverkusen?s stadium, but because of the distance between the hotel and stadium.? 

Leverkusen reacted angrily, noting that club owner and chemical giant Bayer AG had been a major supporter of Germany?s effort to bring the World Cup to the country. Since Bayarena holds only 22,500 spectators, not enough to host a World Cup match, Leverkusen and Bayer AG?s reward was the training camp. 

Bayer AG sports director Meinolf Sprink accused Klinsmann and the German Soccer Federation (DFB) of lacking style in making the change, as well as breach of contract. ?We have a clear written agreement. I think it?s sad that we found this out through the press,? Sprink said. 

Bierhoff said the Germany team may turn to a different part of the country in search of a new training camp. 

Klinsmann has made several changes within German soccer since taking over the three-time World Cup champions last month, changing methods and personnel in a way that has often been described as ?uncompromising? and ?ruthless.? 

The former forward has vowed to turn the team?s fortunes, ? eliminated in the first round at the European championship in June ? in time to win the 2006 World Cup.

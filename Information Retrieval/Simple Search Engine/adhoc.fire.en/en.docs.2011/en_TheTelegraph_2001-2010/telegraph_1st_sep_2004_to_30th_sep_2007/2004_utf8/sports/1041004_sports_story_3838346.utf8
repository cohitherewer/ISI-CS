 6-nation meet may be revived

 A CORRESPONDENT 

New Delhi: It promises to be an action packed 

season for Indian hockey in 2005 with the start of the inaugural national league 

in January and the revival of a six nation international meet in March. 

This was announced on Sunday by the Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) president K.P.S. Gill. 

He said IHF had approached several countries to take part in the six-nation meet in March 2005 on the lines of the Indira Gandhi International Tournament, which was last held in 1996. 

The IHF chief said the senior national championships would be held in Mumbai after four years in November-December 2004. 

The junior nationals will be played on grass in Jabalpur later this month, he said. 

Revealing plans for the much-hyped National Hockey League, Gill said all the matches will be played under floodlights in Hyderabad during the first three weeks of January 2005. 

Among the 11 teams that will participate, five would be in ?tier one? and six teams in ?tier two?. 

The format will be a round robin league one.

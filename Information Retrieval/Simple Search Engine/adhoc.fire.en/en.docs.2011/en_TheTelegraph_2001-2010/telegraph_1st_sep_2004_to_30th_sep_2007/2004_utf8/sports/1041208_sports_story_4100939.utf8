The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Meet in city next September

A STAFF REPORTER

 Bhupathi kept his promise 

Calcutta: Mahesh Bhupathi is all set to fulfil a promise: that of gifting Calcutta a top-class tennis event in 2005. 

His company Globosport, in association with the state government, will organise a WTA Tour event from September 19-25. 

The Sunfeast Open, as it has been christened, will be a Tier III tournament of the women?s Tour, with a prize-money of $170,000. Globosport also runs the WTA Hyderabad Open, but that is a $140,000 Tier IV meet. 

The dates allotted to the Calcutta meet being what they are, it will be too risky to have it outdoors. 

The organisers were left with no choice but the Netaji Indoor Stadium. With Bhupathi enjoying the blessings of the West Bengal government, it wasn?t too much of a problem in clinching the stadium deal. 

The last time the Netaji Indoor hosted a tennis event was way back in 1978, when Frenchman Yannick Noah won the men?s Grand Prix. 

This newly-introduced event in the WTA calendar is the fifth Tier III meet in Asia. Tokyo, Bangkok, Guangzhou and Bali are the other cities on the 2005 WTA roster. 

Bhupathi has ensured the appearance of Mary Pierce at his Hyderabad event. As for the inaugural Calcutta meet, he has gone on record as saying that three top-20 women will be in the draw. 

Well, at least a couple of big names are definitely necessary to draw the crowds to the Netaji Indoor Stadium.

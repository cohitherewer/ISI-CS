 Sourav let-off surprises Steve Waugh

Thiruvananthapuram: Former Australia captain 

Steve Waugh said on Friday he was surprised to hear that Sourav Ganguly had won 

his appeal against the two-Test ban. 

?It came as a pleasant surprise? Ganguly must have put up a good defence,? said Waugh, who is in India as brand ambassador of an insurance company. ?Anyway, it?s a positive thing for the Indian captain and the team. 

?I thought the ICC will make an example through this punishment. Maybe, the ICC had good reasons to backtrack,? Waugh added. 

The Team India captain had appealed against Match Referee Clive Lloyd?s verdict after the November 13 ODI versus Pakistan at the Eden Gardens. 

Waugh felt it was the captain?s responsibility to 

maintain a good over-rate and that every team must be aware of the penalty awaiting 

them in the event of not completing the quota in time. (PTI)

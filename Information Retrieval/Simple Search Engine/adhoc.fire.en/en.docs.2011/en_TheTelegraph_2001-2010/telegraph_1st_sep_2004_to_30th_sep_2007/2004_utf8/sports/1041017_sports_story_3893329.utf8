 Arsenal whip Villa 

London: Robert Pires and Thierry Henry combined to give champions Arsenal a classy 3-1 victory over Aston Villa at Highbury on Saturday. Arsenal?s record 48-match unbeaten league record was briefly under threat when Lee Hendrie gave Villa an early lead but two goals by Pires either side of an Henry strike gave Arsene Wenger?s team three deserved points. 

After nine games Arsenal lead the table on 25 points and they are 11 points clear of fourth-placed Manchester United who were held 0-0 at Birmingham City. 

Everton stayed third on 19 points after a 1-0 home win over Southampton. Ten-man Liverpool fought back from 2-0 down to win 4-2 at Fulham, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink hit a hattrick in Middlesbrough?s 4-0 win at 10-man Blackburn and Bolton beat Crystal Palace 1-0. 

United dropped two more points at St Andrews. United had all four strikers ? Van Nistelrooy, Alan Smith, Louis Saha and Wayne Rooney ? in the second half, but still could not break the deadlock. (Reuters)

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Indians have to play tough, like Harbhajan

 - Teams don't need to be changed

Stump Vision 

Ian Healy

 There should be no changes in 

 either side for the second Test. Underperformers must be 

 given a chance to redeem themselves and neither team needs 

 to blood new players. Form may have eluded the classic Indian 

 batsmen, but we all know how easily that changes with some 

 good old-fashioned intensity and attitude.

 Back-to-back Tests are physiologically 

 unsafe, especially for bowlers, but its a thing of the future, 

 because touring teams wish to shorten tours so dramatically. 

 This time the bowlers know there is a seven-day break before 

 the Nagpur Test, so efforts should sustain.

 I am hopeful of greater impact 

 for the Indian quicks and the team?s part-time options. 

 Yuvraj Singh, Virender Sehwag and Sourav Ganguly, if fit 

 enough, should be rotated cleverly. Not just to ease the 

 burden on Harbhajan Singh and Anil Kumble, but for good 

 effect.

 Patel after practice at the Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai 

 on Wednesday 

Coupled with their reasonable 

 ability, they need to be aggressive in their thinking for 

 short bursts. Ganguly was quite stereotyped in his roster 

 last week and only he will know why. Sometimes it can be 

 a sign of being pre-occupied, having to worry about others. 

 Or maybe the brisk first day by Australia was too much for 

 him.

 Adam Gilchrist, on the other hand, 

 was full of beans and direction. He was not afraid to play 

 ugly defensive cricket at times but quickly pounced when 

 the jugular was exposed. 

 Many unknowns for this Test go 

 back into the melting pot. What would a contest between 

 these two be without excessive speculation and debate?

 Will Warney and Kumble discover 

 some bounce, so their accuracy can be truly rewarded? Possible 

 batting line-up changes for India, tactical changes to look 

 out for as bowlers possibly admit they were wrong in the 

 first instance.

 New plans, new body language and 

 positive thoughts for a new day as players convince their 

 own brains that they can do it. One week of massive effort 

 and a break can be had. 

 Simon Katich was unsung, yet steadied 

 such a big ship expertly for a novice. Triple figures would 

 be appropriate next time he gets close. 

 Damien Martyn and Darren Lehmann, 

 now locked in a private battle, need to forget all that 

 and put the team?s plight first, in order to relax and play 

 great.

 I am sure they will not forget, 

 but India did not get hurt by one of the best opening pairs 

 around and they better not expect that to happen often.

 Parthiv Patel demonstrated that 

 he has been working hard and effectively on his wicketkeeping. 

 He was consistently much lower and totally focussed on the 

 ball when keeping over the stumps than ever before.

 Swinging backlifts and strokes 

 can easily distract a ?keeper but that is where the skill 

 comes in and Parthiv has already improved.

 I have never heard Australians 

 complain about an opposition sledger, and certainly don?t 

 approve it, but it is a sign that Harbhajan is in it for 

 real ? that?s for sure. 

 He might not enjoy the end results 

 but he is willing to put himself on the line in the hope 

 of ruffling some feathers.

 It did not pay off for him but 

 only because he lacked colleagues willing to do the same. 

 No team will beat Australia nicely, it will have to be tough 

 and uncompromising as the champs will fight back from anywhere, 

 so get used to it. Skill needs to be produced while the 

 needle is on and only Harbhajan was up to it.

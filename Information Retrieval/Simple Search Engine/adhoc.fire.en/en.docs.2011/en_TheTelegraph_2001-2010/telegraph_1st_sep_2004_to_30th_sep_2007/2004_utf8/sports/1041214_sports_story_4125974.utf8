 Whatmore wants fans to be patient

 Whatmore feels there has been some improvement 

Dhaka: As Bangladesh suffered yet another ignominious defeat on Monday, coach Dav Whatmore requested the fans to be more patient. 

?We came very close in Multan (of a victory against Pakistan). I can understand the frustration of all in Bangladesh. But I plead with everyone to have more patience,? Whatmore said after his team was thrashed by India in the first Test. 

?The boys are working hard and there has been some degree of improvement,? said the coach who led Sri Lanka to their maiden World Cup victory in 1996. Whatmore dismissed criticism that Bangladesh did not deserve their Test status. 

?It is absolute rubbish, a shallow view. People need to understand the game and Bangladesh cricket, those are dangerous comments,? he said. 

Team India captain Sourav Ganguly also had some encouraging words for the hosts. 

?They played well in patches. They bowled well on the second morning.? (PTI)

Calcutta: Indias disgraceful showing at the just-concluded Athens Olympic Games could have been different had chess been a part of the quadrennial showpiece. Naresh Kumar aptly summed up the feelings of the packed Gorky Sadan audience at Tuesday evenings prize distribution function of the 17th The Telegraph Schools Chess Championship. 

The chief guest of the hour-long function noted that India finished 66th in the medals tally, on a par with tiny Hong Kong. Thats quite pathetic I am sure if chess was among the Olympic disciplines, we would have won a few gold medals, the former Davis Cup captain remarked. 

Congratulating the prize-winners, Kumar hoped the sport will, one day, be included in the Olympic fold. I know there is a Chess Olympiad, but lets hope it becomes part of the Olympic Games. Once that happens, I am sure some of todays winners here will stand a good chance of winning gold medals. 

The chief guest made another very pertinent observation. I want to congratulate the parents for the wonderful support they are providing to these boys and girls without the familys backing, the kids wouldnt have been able to pursue their game so single-mindedly. 

Egging on those who failed to find a place in the prize-winners list, Kumar said: You must persevere, thats the most important thing. 

An incredible 26 unrated players got part-Fide ratings from this tournament, while as many as 10 increased their ratings. 

Jain Shrenhik Daklia, the champion, improved his Fide rating by 89 points. 

Daklia nearly missed the championship because of his school examinations. The principal of Yugantar Public School, in Rajnandgaon (Chhatisgarh), made an exception and allowed him to come to Calcutta. Seeded 23rd, and hardly among the pre-tournament favourites, Daklia surprised all by scoring 10 points in 11 rounds. 

St James Calcutta won the best school prize for the fourth straight year. Sunbeam School, Benaras, got the second-best school prize. 

Kumar apart, Vycheslav Eromaley, vice-consul general of the Russian federation, and Alekhine Chess Club president Asoke Ghosh were among those present at the function.

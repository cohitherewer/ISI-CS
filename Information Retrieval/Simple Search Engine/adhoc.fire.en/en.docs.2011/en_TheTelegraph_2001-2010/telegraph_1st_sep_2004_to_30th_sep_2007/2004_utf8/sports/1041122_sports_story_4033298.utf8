 Hall cracks maiden ton, debutant De Bruyn hits 83 as Indian

Kanpur: Andrew Hall gave a remarkable display of patience and concentration to crack a record-breaking maiden century as South Africa hemmed and hawed their way to a commanding position in the first Test against India on Sunday. 

The right-handed Hall slipped into the new role of an opener with consummate ease to score a career-best 163 and took the tourists to a comfortable 459 for seven in their first innings at close on a dreary second day. 

The 29-year-old occupied the crease for a marathon 588 minutes and achieved the milestone of becoming South Africa?s highest individual Test scorer on Indian soil on a highly frustrating day for the hosts who managed just three wickets. 

Debutant Zander de Bruyn also made it a memorable Test for himself as he mixed caution with aggression to score a 206-ball 83, which included six fours and three sixes on a lifeless track. Shaun Pollock was batting on 31 and wicketkeeper Thami Tsolekile was giving him company on five at stumps. This was the highest first innings total recorded by any visiting team in Kanpur. 

The Indian bowlers were made to toil hard on the placid track though veteran leg-spinner Anil Kumble had the satisfaction of recording his 28th five-wicket haul in Test matches. The much-hyped Indian batting line up now must fire collectively to chase a mammoth first innings total. 

With three full days left, it remains to be seen whether the South African captain Graeme Smith declares by the first hour?s play on Monday to have a go at the Indian batsmen, who have been a pale shadow of themselves in recent times. 

Resuming at the overnight score of 230 for four, the South Africans lost Boeta Dippenaar (48) early in the day but it turned out to be tough going for the hosts from there on. 

The Indians took the second new ball after 93 overs and both Zaheer Khan and captain Sourav Ganguly obtained some movement from the slow track to repeatedly beat the batsmen in the first hour?s play. 

Sourav claimed the wicket of Dippenaar, inducing him to edge an outgoing delivery to Dinesh Karthik. 

De Bruyn appeared a trifle shaky in the initial stages but grew in confidence to ensure that no more wickets fell in the pre-lunch session, which saw the visitors adding 72 runs to their overnight tally. The Proteas managed to add just 28 runs in the first hour?s play but accelerated to some extent after the drinks break. 

Hall swept Kumble to the fine leg fence to notch up his maiden century after batting for a marathon 436 minutes. He eclipsed his previous highest score of 99 not out achieved against England in 2003. 

Harbhajan Singh was introduced immediately after the drinks break but the off spinner failed to make any impact against the two well-set batsmen. The wily Kumble brought an end to his vigil by knocking down his stumps around the legs, much to the relief of the home team, which toiled hard to break the sixth-wicket stand. 

The pair of Hall and De Bruyn stitched 144 runs for the sixth wicket to put their team in the driver?s seat. 

Kumble recorded his 28th five-wicket haul in Test cricket when he dismissed Hall.

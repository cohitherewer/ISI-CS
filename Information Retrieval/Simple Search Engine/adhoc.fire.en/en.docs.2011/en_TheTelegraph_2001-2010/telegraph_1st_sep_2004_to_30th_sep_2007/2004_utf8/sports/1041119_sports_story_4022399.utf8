Brisbane: Mathew Sinclair and Jacob Oram completed half-centuries to help New Zealand recover from an early batting collapse and reach 250 for seven at stumps on Day I of the first Test with Australia on Thursday. 

Sinclair made a patient 69 in almost four hours while Oram blasted an unbeaten 63 to guide the Black Caps to a respectable position after they had seemed destined for a much lower total. 

?This is day I of a five-dayer and this is building towards a very good Test match,? Sinclair said later. 

?We?ve got to pick up what we can and look to carry on but we?ve got a good building block and we?ve still got some good batsmen to come in.? 

Things were looking grim for the tourists when they limped to 142 for five at tea after Michael Kasprowicz had ripped through the top order with an inspired display of fast bowling on a Gabba pitch ideal for batting. 

But the New Zealand lower order added 108 runs for the loss of just two wickets in the final session to deny the Australians a quick kill. 

New Zealand had made a bright enough start after winning the toss before Kasprowicz snapped up two wickets in four balls to leave them reeling at 26 for two. 

Opener Mark Richardson fell for 19, fending a ball that moved away from him to Ricky Ponting at second slip. Captain Stephen Fleming departed for a duck when he edged to Shane Warne at first slip. 

Sinclair, who had averaged just 12 in his previous six Tests against Australia, slowly set about rebuilding the innings, sharing successive half-century partnerships with Scott Styris then Nathan Astle. 

Styris was dismissed for 27 after the lunch break when he nicked Kasprowicz to Adam Gilchrist. Astle then was run out for 19 after Michael Clarke threw down the stumps from 30 metres away in a brilliant piece of fielding. 

Sinclair was almost run out by Clarke on 13 but survived and held the Australians at bay for most of the day until his innings eventually came to an end. Ponting held a low catch off Gillespie at slip, albeit the judgment was delivered after third umpire Peter Parker was called on to confirm the ball had carried through.

 Gibbs, Boje respond

Durban: South African cricketers Herchelle Gibbs and Nicky Boje have replied to the Delhi police?s questionnaire on match-fixing and corruption allegations regarding South Africa?s tour of India in 1999-2000. 

The United Cricket Board of South Africa (UCBSA) said in a statement on Friday that its chief executive Gerald Majola has forwarded the players? responses to the Indian High Commission in Pretoria. 

The questionnaires were sent after repeated requests from the UCBSA following uncertainty over whether Boje and Gibbs would be interrogated if they tour India as part of South Africa?s squad for the two-Test series. 

Majola said the board would co-operate with the ongoing investigation and stressed that it would continue to seek clear and binding assurances that should the two players travel to India, they will not face the risk of detention. 

?It is hoped that there will be a swift response from New Delhi and that the process will be completed before the team is selected in November,? he said.

 Jiri Novak to skip meet

Prague: World No. 24 Jiri Novak says he will take all of January off, including the Australian Open, to spend more time with his wife and three children. 

?I have had a strenuous season and I am taking a rest and am definitely not going to Australia,? Novak told Czech media on Thursday. 

This year, the Czech No. 1 won two singles titles, in Basel and Tokyo. 

He reached the semi-finals in Melbourne two years ago for his best Grand Slam result so far. 

Novak has denied he planned to end his 11-year professional career soon but added he would enter only a limited number of tournaments in 2005. 

?I still do not know when I am going to return to the circuit,? he said. 

?I will travel less so that the family does not suffer as much ... My advantage is that there are more important things for me. Tennis is my hobby.?

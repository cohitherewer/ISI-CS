 Road Runner fancied 

 HONKY DORY

 Of the four horses running for the 3,200m Suresh Mahindra Trophy, in Pune on Saturday, Road Runner and Allodium appear to be ideally cut out for the longest race in the country?s racing calendar. However, age favours the M.K.Jadhav-trained Road Runner who will be partnered by C. Rajendra.

Amritsar: Down 1-3, India will have to raise their game in the penultimate match of the friendship hockey series here on Friday to prevent Pakistan from running away with the title. 

The holy city, which will be hosting an Indo-Pak test for the first time, is expected to see a riveting contest. 

A win for India, who have won one, drawn two and lost three matches, would boost to their chances of levelling the eight-match series, the last tie of which is to be played under floodlights in Hyderabad on Sunday. 

Pakistan, who were hoping to wrap up the series in the previous match at Chandigarh, must also be under pressure as another patchy performance may land them in trouble. 

India must consider themselves unlucky for not having scored the winner in their 1-1 draw in Chandigarh despite getting a number of chances. 

To have any chance of making a comeback, they must improve their scoring rate. 

Captain Dilip Tirkey, who was hit on his wrist and face in the return leg-opener in Delhi and missed the Chandigarh tie, has suffered a hairline chin fracture, the Indian Hockey Federation said tonight. 

?Medical tests have confirmed a hairline fracture in his right cheek bone,? an IHF spokesperson said. Even the Hyderabad Test is in doubt for the skipper. Hence the team will miss him again and the young defenders will have to burden extra responsibility. 

?We are feeling Dilip?s absence, he is a class act. It?s very hard to find a replacement for a player of his calibre,? India?s chief coach Gerhard Rach said. The German-born coach was a trifle worried by the players? failure to convert, particularly the penalty corners, but more than the players he blamed a tight schedule for the misses. 

?In Athens we had little time to prepare for penalty corners. Here also we have no time to practice. We are just playing and travelling without any break,? Rach said. 

?This is something which needs a lot of practising and it?s not possible to improve without practice.? 

The Indians are trying to take the positives from Wednesday?s draw as barring the scoring lapses, they did reasonably well in other aspects of the game with Viren Rasquinha admirably leading the team in the absence of Tirkey. 

Most of the players ? defenders, midfielders and forwards ? had a good game as they played as a cohesive unit rarely giving their opponents a chance to dominate the game. 

?It was a good game and the team played with a lot of spirit. They must put in the same effort in the next match,? Rasquinha said. 

Pakistan, on the other hand, were looking to their forwards to go full throttle and secure a win for the side, playing a bilateral series with India after a gap of five years.

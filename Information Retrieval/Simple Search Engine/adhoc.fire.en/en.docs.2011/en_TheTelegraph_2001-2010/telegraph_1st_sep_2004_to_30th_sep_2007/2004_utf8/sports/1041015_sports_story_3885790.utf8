The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Ashok Kumar in lead 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Ashok Kumar is in a stunning form. His consistency, which saw him winning three titles in a row earlier in the Amby Valley PGAI Tour, was at it again at the ONGC-Noida Open on Thursday. He fired ninth successive under-par score to take his two-day tally to ten-under 134 in Noida. 

According to information received here, S Madhaiah of Bangalore, however, returned the best card of the day, a six-under 66, which propelled him into the sole second position, one stroke behind Ashok. 

Twice Indian Open winner Ali Sher made a welcome return to form with a round of 69, lying at third position at 139. 

Meanwhile, Delhi?s Brijpal Singh fired a fine hole-in-one on the par-3 fifth. 

The cut was applied at eight-over 152 with 53 professionals and seven amateurs making it to the deciding rounds.

 London: The Uefa Cup tie between Maccabi Petah Tikva and Heerenveen will be decided in the second leg in The Netherlands next week after the first leg in Israel was cancelled, Uefa said on Wednesday.

 The first leg of the first round tie, which was to have been played on Wednesday, was cancelled by European soccer?s governing body on Tuesday because of a general strike in Israel which prevented the Dutch team and match officials from flying to Tel Aviv. ?The second leg remains and the tie will be decided then,? a Uefa spokesman said from Switzerland. He said full details about the single match on September 30 to which the tie has been reduced would be issued later. 

 Zurich: Pele and Franz Beckenbauer will be awarded Fifa?s Centennial Order of Merit on Thursday. The award ceremony was originally scheduled to have taken place at Fifa?s Centennial Congress in Paris in May but Pele was recovering from an eye operation and could not attend.

 The awards are being given to mark their outstanding lifetime contributions to the sport. 

 After the ceremony, due to be held at Fifa?s headquarters, the two men will be part of the panel to choose their three favourite Fifa Centennial stamp designs from over 70 submissions from the postal services of Fifa member associations. 

 Buenos Aires: Argentine soccer great Omar Sivori is in hospital suffering from a stomach illness, local media have reported. The 68-year-old, who had a memorable attacking partnership at Juventus with Welshman John Charles, was rushed to hospital with inflamation of the pancreas, the state news agency Telam said.

 Sivori, the European Footballer of the Year in 1961 and who played for both Argentina and Italy, made his first division debut for River Plate at 17 in 1954 and won two Argentine championships with his club.

 Raleigh (North Carolina): World 200 metres champion John Capel was given a public warning by the US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) on Tuesday because of a positive test for marijuana.

 The positive test prompted the US to remove him from their 4x100 metres relay team at the Athens Olympics. Capel tested positive at a meeting in Munich on August 8, USADA said.

 He received a public warning and was stripped of his second-place finish in the 100 metres in Munich in accordance with International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) rules for first offences, USADA said. A second positive would result in a two-year ban. 

 Athens: Two powerlifters from Azerbaijan have been banned for life after testing positive for banned steroids in out-of-competition tests at the Athens Paralympics.

 Urine samples from Gunduz Ismayilov showed traces of stanazolol while Sara Abbasova tested positive for nandrolone. They were the second doping offences for both athletes.

Calcutta: Bengal let Delhi off the hook through some sloppy fielding and unimaginative bowling on the second day of their Ranji Trophy Elite group A tie. Having lasted only 5.5 overs before being bowled out for 240, Shib Shankar Paul and Ranadeb Bose utilised the early life on the wicket to reduce Delhi to 51 for three. 

Sensing an improbable chance of grabbing the vital first innings lead, Bengal intensified the pressure. However, the experience of Mithun Manhas and Vijay Dahiya came to the fore as they held fort thwarting the Bengal bowlers? challenge with grit and determination. 

Their unbroken fourth wicket partnership may have yielded just 133 runs in 271 balls but at close they managed to put the confidence back in the minds of the Delhi batsmen. With Ajay Jadeja still to bat, Delhi are on a firm footing. The stand did not provide the best of entertainment, though, it did come as an eye-opener to the Bengal batsmen on how to build an innings. 

It is this inadequacy that has been Bengal?s bane this season. The temperament and resolve has just been missing. The seniors have failed to deliver with the bat when it mattered while the juniors have crumbled under pressure. The failure of the openers ? except for the opening game against Karnataka ? has created unnecessary burden on the middle-order. 

In the absence of Devang Gandhi, Deep Dasgupta should have taken the initiative in restoring confidence in the ranks. But he failed miserably and has even prompted a rethink in the selectors? minds ahead of the final game against Madhya Pradesh. 

To make matters worse, Deep dropped a regulation chance of Manhas on 21. The Delhi batsman survived second time on 63 in the deep. 

This was the second successive day, when play had to be called off early due to bad light. 

The Bengal camp had a visitor in Utpal Chatterjee at the end of the day, and he stressed on the need to revert back to three-day matches in the CAB league. That will be looked into the future. The damage has been done as Bengal are struggling to stay afloat in the Elite group this season. 

?The first innings hasn?t still been decided and so it?s difficult to comment on the state of the match. The gameplan will come into effect once that is decided,? Madanlal said. 

The Delhi coach, though, had reasons to be satisfied. Manhas may have top-scored with an unbeaten 79 but it was Dahiya (68 batting) who held the innings together. 

The former India stumper was a bundle of confidence as he negotiated the attack. No false stroke was offered and he played within his limitations. 

Ranadeb was certainly the most effective of the Bengal bowlers and looked threatening. Shikhar Dhawan was his first victim and then in the first over of his second spell he removed Gautam Gambhir. 

The India opener failed to negotiate the movement and was caught at second slip. Unfortunately, Ranadeb was sparingly used and longer spells could have done Bengal a world of good. 

Paul?s inconsistency cost him dear. Trying for extra pace, he sacrificed on his line. 

None of the other bowlers failed to impress. Laxmi Ratan Shukla is more of a batsman than a bowler these days and the spinners never looked like managing a breakthrough. Rohan Gavaskar?s over-reliance on his spinners defied logic on this wicket. 

Nine of the Bengal wickets went to the mediumpacers, with Amit Bhandari returning figures of five for 55. 

Subhomoy Das, despite an injured lower back, came out to complete his fifty before running out of partners.

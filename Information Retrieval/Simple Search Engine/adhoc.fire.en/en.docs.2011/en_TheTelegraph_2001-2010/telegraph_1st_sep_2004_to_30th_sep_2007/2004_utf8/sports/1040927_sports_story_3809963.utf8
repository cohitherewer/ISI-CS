 Agassi to continue another year: Graf

Berlin: Former world No.1 Andre Agassi will carry on playing professional tennis for at least another year, says his wife Steffi Graf. 

?He has told me that, after the indoor season, he definitely intended to play for another full year,? Steffi Graf said in Berlin on Saturday. 

Many have suggested this year could be Agassi?s last on the professional tour, although the 34-year-old American has repeatedly said his plan was to continue playing until he could no longer compete at the top level. 

The eight-time Grand Slam champion reached the semi-finals of this year?s Australian Open and the quarter finals of this month?s US Open. His hopes of another major at Flushing Meadows were however dashed by world No.1 Roger Federer. 

Graf, a former world No.1 who retired from competitive tennis in August 1999, was in Berlin to play an exhibition match against Argentine Gabriela Sabatini. 

?I haven?t been on a court for so long for years and I was a bit nervous,? said the 35-year-old after beating her former rival 6-1 7-5. 

Sabatini was impressed with the German?s performance. ?She can make a comeback straightaway,? said the Argentine. ?I can?t believe she hasn?t played for five years.? 

Graf?s three-year-old son, Jaden Gil, was watching from the stands. Graf, who won 22 Grand Slam singles titles, and Agassi were married in October 2001. 

They also have a daughter, Jaz, who is 11 months old.

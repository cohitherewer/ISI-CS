 Ronaldinho chances bright

Teresopolis: Brazil remain optimistic over striker Ronaldinhos chances of being fit for Sundays World Cup qualifier against Bolivia. 

Ronaldinho missed Barcelonas opening match of the Spanish league season this weekend with an ankle injury. Despite being rested from Tuesdays training session, team doctor Jose Luis Runco said the forward was improving quickly. 

Hes going to continue receiving treatment and we hope he will be able to train on Thursday, Runco said. Hes got a good chance of playing. 

Elsewhere, injury problems continued to mount for the world champions. 

Central defender Juan was reported as doubtful while Gustavo Nery, reserve to Roberto Carlos at left-back, pulled out of the squad with a broken wrist. Runco said Bayer Leverkusen defender Juan, who is due to arrive later this week, had suffered a head injury during a Bundesliga match at the weekend. 

Juan had won a place in the centre of the defence with his performances at the Copa America in Peru in July, where Brazil won the title. 

Uncapped Leandro from Brazilian champions Cruzeiro was on Tuesday named the replacement for Gustavo Nery, who plays for German champions Werder Bremen. 

Brazil have already lost striker Luis Fabiano and midfielder Diego through injury. 

Meanwhile, five players AC Milan trio Kaka, Cafu and Dida and Bayern Munichs Ze Roberto and Lucio were not selected in an apparent reprisal after they missed the so-called Peace Match away to Haiti two weeks ago. 

Obviously, in these circumstances and with everything that has happened, this game is going to be more complicated than the others, coach Carlos Alberto Parreira said. 

Brazil lead the South American World Cup qualifying group with 13 points from seven games. Bolivia, who have conceded 11 goals on their last two visits to Brazil, are at the bottom with six. 

Ronaldo took his new girlfriend to watch him train with Brazil on Tuesday, while coach Carlos Alberto Parreira thanked her for helping the Real Madrid forward lose weight. Daniela Cicarella sat on the touchline as the world champions began preparing for Sundays World Cup qualifier at home to Bolivia and her presence seemed to distract Ronaldo, who repeatedly looked in her direction. 

But Parreira said he had no objections and spent several minutes talking to her. I thanked her, he said. Ronaldo is happy, slim and in form. 

Three months ago, Ronaldo was repeatedly having to fend off questions about his weight and stormed out of a news conference when an Argentine journalist handed him a book on dieting. 

If I dont score goals, its because Im fat, he said at the time. If I score, its because Ive lost weight. 

Ronaldo, who split up with his first wife Milene Domingues last year denied another wedding was in the air. When I get married, youll know about it, he said.

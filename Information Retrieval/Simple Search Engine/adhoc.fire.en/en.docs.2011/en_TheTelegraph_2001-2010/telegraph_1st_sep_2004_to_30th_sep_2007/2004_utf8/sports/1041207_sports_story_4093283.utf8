The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Indians lack consistency

PARGAT SINGH

A vastly improved performance was still not enough to get India a win as they lost 4-5 to Holland in their second match of the Champions Trophy in Lahore on Sunday. 

The encouraging part was that this performance came against a side of the calibre of Holland, but the sad part was that for the umpteenth time India lost a match they could have won, or at least should have drawn. In international hockey at this level, a single goal can spell the difference between fighting for a medal and being left out in the cold among also-rans. 

Against Holland, one defensive lapse cost us a goal, and then one miss in the closing stages meant even a draw eluded India. 

Consistency, that one important word in sport, is what is missing right now. Once the team finds that, rest will follow. But for that to happen, there ought to be a plan. 

India and Holland have always had high-scoring matches. And almost always the Dutch manage to pull off the win in the end. It happened in the Champions Trophy in Amstelveen in 2003 and now again in Lahore. 

One major positive from this match was that the players did not let the first defeat against Spain linger on their minds. They simply put it aside and played afresh, and that is what is required of them. 

They attacked well, defended well too, and had a lot of good moves to speak about. Even more encouraging was the fact that they did not give up at any stage. 

They kept fighting despite trailing at various points. Further, carrying on with the pluses, they did not run out of steam in the last quarter. 

Having noticed all the positives, it is imperative to mention that there were some areas of concern which needs to be addressed. (PTI)

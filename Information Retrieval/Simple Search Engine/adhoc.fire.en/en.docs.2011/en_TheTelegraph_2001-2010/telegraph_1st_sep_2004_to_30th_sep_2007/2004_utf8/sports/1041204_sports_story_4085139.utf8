 Mani to hear England players

Bulawayo: Ehsan Mani, president of the International Cricket Council (ICC), has agreed to meet England?s players and hear first hand their grievances over their controversial tour of Zimbabwe. Michael Vaughan?s team face Zimbabwe in the third of four one-dayers here Saturday with the final match taking place Sunday before they make a hasty retreat to South Africa. 

However, before they make their eager departure, Mani is determined to sit down with the squad and hear what they have to say. ?I want to see them because it is very important to hear their views,? said Mani. 

?I want to know what they think about the level of cricket in Zimbabwe and their experiences in the country so far.? 

Mani, whose organisation had the power to fine or even suspend England if they had pulled out of the trip, insisted he appreciated the players? worries over being dragged into a political war of words over the Robert Mugabe regime. 

Vaughan had insisted his players would withdraw from the tour if it became politicised. ?I felt it was important for me to be here because there have been concerns about this tour and I wanted to see it for myself,? Mani told reporters. 

The ICC chief also said that England?s reputation in world cricket has been enhanced by their decision to go ahead with the tour and that David Morgan, the chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), should be praised for his work.

 Real, Roma face-off in Madrid today

London: Two clubs seemingly vying to make Europe?s most miserable start to a season, Real Madrid and AS Roma, will meet this week on their return to Champions League duty. 

Tuesday?s game at the Bernabeu is one of the highlights of matchday two, along with a classic German-Dutch battle between Bayern Munich and Ajax Amsterdam, and the trip by holders Porto to face their former boss Jose Mourinho at Chelsea. 

Manchester United, who are set to give a debut to teenage striker Wayne Rooney, have a score to settle with Fenerbahce, while 2003 winners AC Milan host Celtic at the San Siro and Juventus meet Israel?s Maccabi Tel-Aviv. 

Few teams will be in such desperate need of a good result, though, as Real or Roma, whose performances have triggered the early departure of both their coaches. 

Real?s Jose Antonio Camacho quit last week in the wake of a humiliating 0-3 drubbing by Bayer Leverkusen and an appalling display in their Primera Liga 0-1 loss at Espanyol. 

Though Camacho?s deputy Mariano Garcia Remon watched them beat Osasuna 1-0 in another disappointing display, lightened only by David Beckham?s match-winning free-kick, it was back to the bad times in Saturday?s 1-2 defeat by Athletic Bilbao. Roma?s Rudi Voeller has fared no better, resigning after less than a month in charge following Saturday?s hugely embarrassing 1-3 loss to nine-man Bologna. 

His deputy, Ezio Sella, was placed in interim charge after Italy?s 2001 champions managed only four points in as many games under their former Germany coach. 

In Europe, Roma have been shamed by a missile from their home crowd which struck Swedish referee Anders Frisk and led to their Champions League opener with Dynamo Kiev being abandoned. 

Uefa later awarded Kiev a 3-0 victory and ordered Roma to play their next two home European games at the Olympic Stadium behind closed doors. 

Decades of intense rivalry between their national teams will provide the backdrop for Bayern?s game with Ajax in Munich. Ajax will need to keep an eye on Bayern?s Roy Makaay, who scored one and made another in their 3-1 win over SC Freiburg at the weekend. 

Ajax needed a winner two minutes from time to beat Roda JC Kerkrade 1-0 and stay second in their domestic league. 

Chelsea also snatched a late 1-0 win, beating Middlesbrough on Saturday, and Mourinho made it clear there would be no mercy on the team he guided to consecutive Uefa Cup and Champions League successes. 

Deportivo La Coruna fullback Enrique Romero will miss his side?s match away to Monaco on Tuesday after falling off a bicycle at the weekend. 

Club doctor Cesar Cobian said that the Spanish international suffered heavy bruising on Sunday when he crashed a bike at a friends house after a dog ran across his path. 

Youth team player Carlos Pita has been drafted into the squad to replace Romero. 

Rooney should play his much-awaited first game since England?s Euro 2004 quarter final exit to Portugal, following a broken bone in his foot.

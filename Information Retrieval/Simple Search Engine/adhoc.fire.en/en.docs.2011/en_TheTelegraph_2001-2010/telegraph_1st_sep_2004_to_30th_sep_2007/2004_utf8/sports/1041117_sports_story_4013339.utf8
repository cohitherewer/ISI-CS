Calcutta: At least for a day, leave aside the debate over how big East Bengal?s victory margin against Tollygunge Agragami could have been and the accompanying joy of reclaiming the top position in the CFL Super Division. 

Instead, let us all stand up and bow to the fight, Sasthi Duley and Dipankar Roy began at the Kalyani municipality ground on Tuesday, to leave their worst crisis in life behind. 

Sports, they say, bask in heroes and their heroics. But Sasthi and Dipankar?s battle may be more than this. It?s about readjusting the focus and mental intensity, about proving themselves, about telling the whole world that they are heroes who live in the hearts of people and not in darkness. 

Dipankar?s goal, just seconds away from the final whistle, completed East Bengal?s 4-0 rout. And this is the stuff sporting folklores are made of. 

When Paolo Roberto da Silva set him free into the box, Dipankar stopped for a while, then let the Tollygunge custodian Arindam Ghosh come forward and finally came the moment for him when his deft placing saw the ball nestling into the net. 

He rushed to the crowd and folded his hands as if urging them to pardon him. 

Coach Subhas Bhowmick clapped and jumped in joy. So was Shylo Malsawmtluanga, Debjit Ghosh, Chandan Das and everybody. The opponents also shook hands with him. 

It was a beautiful example of how sports could help a player beat the demons and discover the hero in him. 

Smile was back on Dipankar and Sasthi?s face. The latter, in fact, was in the starting line-up and could have made their comeback more cherishing had he converted a sitter in the first half. Sasthi also looked rusty, quite understandably though, and himself sought to be substituted in the 36th minute. 

Dipankar was the 89th-minute replacement of Malsawmtluanga and his very first touch of the ball opened the doors to goal for him. He dodged past three Tollygunge players and faltered while trying to get past the goalkeeper as well. 

But forget about those mistakes and let?s set the record straight. Forget about a brilliant Paolo coming out with a hattrick. November 16, 2004 will solely be remembered as a story of the two, who made their return to the ground, to hear the cheers and not languish in darkness. 

The duo last played in the IFA Shield semi-final on October 8. 

Bhowmick, who didn?t let them talk to the press, admitted it was a tough journey for them. ?They need more time to settle down. Both physically and mentally, they are still not in their shape,? he said after the match. 

He informed about a Rs 800 award for Dipankar?s goal ? Rs 500 from him and the rest from his assistant Bikash Panji. 

A nice little gesture, but a very big motivation for Sasthi and Dipankar to move forward from those days of evil.

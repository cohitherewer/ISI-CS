London: Striker Bonaventure Kalou scored twice to send AJ Auxerre through to the first knockout round of the Uefa Cup at the expense of Rangers on Wednesday. 

The stylish French side?s 2-0 win at Ibrox in their final group F clash put them into the last 32 and eliminated the Scottish side after Austria?s Graz AK did enough to seal their passage with a 2-0 home victory over group winners AZ Alkmaar. 

Rangers had won their first two games and even after a defeat by Alkmaar needed only a point against Auxerre to progress, but their hopes were dashed by the Ivory Coast striker scoring early in both halves. 

Middlesbrough, AZ Alkmaar, VfB Stuttgart and Lille went through as group winners and will avoid one of the eight sides dropping down from the Champions League in Friday?s draw. 

Auxerre made the perfect start on a mild night in Glasgow when Kalou scored at the second attempt after his initial effort from Benjani?s chip had hit the crossbar after nine minutes. 

Croat Dado Prso wasted several chances to haul Rangers level before Kalou put the game beyond Rangers soon after the restart when he stepped around French international centre-back Jean-Alain Boumsong and scored with ease. 

Rangers? elimination means Scotland?s top two sides will not be involved in any European competition with Celtic already out of the Champions League. 

Middlesbrough kept their European bandwagon rolling by sealing top spot in group E. The Premier League side, in their debut season in Europe, coasted to a 3-0 victory over Partizan Belgrade at the Riverside with first-half goals from Szilard Nemeth and Joseph Desire-Job and a late effort from James Morrison. 

Partizan, who travelled with their passage already assured, finish third in the group. Last season?s semi-finalists Villarreal took the runners-up spot, ending their programme by demolishing Greek side Egaleo 4-0. 

Meanwhile, Germany?s VfB Stuttgart and Heerenveen from The Netherlands grabbed the final two spots from group G. 

Stuttgart edged to a nervy 2-1 win at home against Dinamo Zagreb to leapfrog Benfica at the top. Christian Tiffert did well to control a through ball from Kevin Kuranyi and clip a shot across keeper Vladimir Vasilj for the opener after 15 minutes. 

The visitors hit back in the 66th mniute when Ivan Bosnjak stole in to convert Ante Tomic?s free-kick but Fernando Meira?s 75th minute strike clinched victory. (Reuters)

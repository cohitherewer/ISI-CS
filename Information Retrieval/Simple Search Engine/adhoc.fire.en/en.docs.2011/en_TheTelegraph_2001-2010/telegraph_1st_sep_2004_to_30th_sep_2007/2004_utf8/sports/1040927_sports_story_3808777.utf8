 Struggling Vijai stays two shots clear

Farmington: World No.1 Vijai Singh stayed two shots clear of the field after struggling to a level-par 72 in the third round of the $4.2 million Pennsylvania Classic on Saturday. 

Singh finished on 12-under-par 204, two shots better than US Ryder Cup team member Chris DiMarco, who carded a one-under 71. Jonathan Byrd and Matt Gogel shared third place another stroke back. 

Zach Johnson and Kent Jones were tied for fifth on 208 while DiMarco?s Ryder Cup colleague Stewart Cink was among a group of seven players in joint seventh place on 209 following a round of 67. 

Former British Open champion Ben Curtis, who was two strokes behind Singh after the second round, slumped to a nine-over 81. Singh played the front nine at the Nemacolin Woodlands Resort?s Mystic Rock course in two under par but his game deteriorated on the inward half. 

The Fijian bogeyed the 11th and the par-three 17th when his tee shot came to rest against a collar of high grass around a greenside bunker. 

Singh?s chip ran 15 feet past the hole and his par putt slipped beyond the cup. That left Singh only one shot ahead of DiMarco, who also bogeyed the 17th. 

At the 18th, Singh hit one of his best shots of the day, an eight-iron from a fairway bunker that stopped 12 feet from the hole. DiMarco was short of the green with his second, then chipped inside Singh. Singh missed his birdie putt but tapped in for par while DiMarco two-putted for bogey, his third dropped stroke in the closing five holes. 

?I had a good start and just couldn?t get it going,? the Fijian said. ?My rhythm was not there today. I was just struggling. I?m still in the lead by two so I?m not that disappointed,? added Singh, who is chasing his fifth victory in six starts and his eighth PGA Tour win of the season. ?I?m still feeling pretty good about my ball play. You got another day to make up.? (Reuters)

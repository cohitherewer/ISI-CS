The Telegraph - Calcutta

 None else will reach 500, says Benaud

 - Warne?s the ultimate wicket-taking machine: Steve 

 Shane Warne gets a pat on the back from Adam Gilchrist after dismissing Harbhajan Singh in Chennai on Saturday 

Sydney: Former Australia captain Richie Benaud does not feel the new world No. 1 Test wicket-taker Shane Warne is safe in his position. 

?Beware of Murali?, is the caution word from one of the cricketing heroes of yesteryears as he genuinely feels the Sri Lankan off-spinner would challenge the Aussie. Warne, it may be recalled, had equalled Muralidharan?s world record three months ago. 

?I believe Muttiah Muralidharan will challenge again,? Benaud said. 

But Benaud does not give a chance to other bowlers to cross the magic 500-wicket mark in the near future as Glenn McGrath (446) and Anil Kumble (412) are way behind and not growing any younger. 

?I can?t really believe anyone else will realistically reach the 500 mark,? he was quoted as saying in a Melbourne paper on Saturday. 

Murali, who has had a shoulder operation similar to the one Warne had, would come back fully fit, Benaud felt. 

Hailing the way Warne claimed the top slot, he said the dismissal of Irfan Pathan to a first-slip catch by Matthew Hayden was a fitting way to claim the record. 

?It was a beautiful ball. It?s always nice if you?re going to do something like that to do it with a good delivery,? Benaud said. 

?That was close to perfect. It drifted away in the air and found the edge.? 

Warne?s coach Terry Jenner, who was ecstatic at his disciple?s world record feat, said: ?It?s a reward for Shane, for what has been a magnificent service to spin bowling.? 

Steve showers praise 

Meanwhile, Former Australia captain Steve Waugh has hailed Shane Warne as the ?ultimate wicket-taking machine? and said only a handful of batsmen tackled him with some success. 

Waugh, in his column, named Sachin Tendulkar, Hansie Cronje, Navjyot Singh Sidhu, Salim Malik, Brian Lara and Graham Gooch as a handful of players who could say they have come out on level terms or better than him. 

All praise for his former teammate, Waugh observed 

that Warne never got tired of working on improving his genius. ?It?s not unusual 

for Warney to get a tape of the day?s play and watch every ball he?s bowled in 

the quest for improvement. Shane never allows a batsman to feel settled, changing 

field settings, engaging in chat with the captain or ?keeper, going around the 

wicket to change the angle and he always delivers the batsman an assortment of 

body language and banter to keep him guessing.? (AGENCIES)

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Crown for Gopi

Hyderabad: Former All England champion Pullela Gopichand celebrated his comeback after a long injury layoff with a clinical victory in the final of the $10,000 Asian Satellite badminton championship on Wednesday. 

Gopichand thrashed compatriot J.B.S. Vidyadhar Rao 15-6, 15-1 in the men?s singles final. 

The women?s singles title went to Soratja Chansruisukto of Thailand, who defeated compatriot Meemek Monthila 11-9, 11-3. 

A beaming Gopichand said the victory had given him a ?good boost? and he would now be playing in the Singapore Open next month. 

With this win Gopichand gained 200 points in international rankings. 

Gopichand and Vidyadhar, who know each other?s game very well, dished out a quality performance, which however was marred by arguments with the chair umpire. 

In the first game, despite some quality shots from Vidyadhar, Gopichand steadily reached 13-1, when some slackness sneaked into the 31-year-old champion, and the youngster smashed his way to pick up five more points. But Gopichand regrouped to settle the issue at 15-6. 

Changing strategy in the second game, Vidyadhar succeeded in drawing Gopichand from one flank to the other and attacking the vacant end with cross-court smashes. But a heated argument with the chair umpire when the score read 4-1 in favour of Gopichand broke the tempo of the game. 

In the all Indian men?s doubles final, Jaseel P. Ismail and V. Diju defeated Rupesh Kumar and Sanave Thomas 15-9, 15-1 while women?s doubles title went to Mundiastiri Rani and Apriliana Rintan of Indonesia, who beat Soratja Chansrisukot and Meem- eak Molthila of Thailand 15-4, 15-5.

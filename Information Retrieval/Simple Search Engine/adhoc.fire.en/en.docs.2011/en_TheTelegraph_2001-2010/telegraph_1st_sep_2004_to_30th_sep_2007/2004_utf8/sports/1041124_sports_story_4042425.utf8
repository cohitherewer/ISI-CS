 Akram: ICC being stupid 

Mohali: Wasim Akram on Tuesday slammed the recent research on bowling action by the International Cricket Council (ICC) saying the game?s world governing body was ?being stupid? in proposing that bowlers be allowed to bend their arms up to 15 degrees. 

?ICC is being stupid. It?s a stupid theory. It (flexion) can?t be 11 degrees or 15 degrees. There seems to be no brains there,? the legendary Pakistani allrounder said. 

The 38-year-old former Pakistan captain said the ICC must not adopt an in-between path while dealing with players with suspect bowling action. ?Either you chuck or you don?t.? 

While Akram had brickbats for ICC, he was sympathetic of controversial off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan. ?I think Murali is a great bowler. Sometimes you are unfair to him.? 

Akram was critical of Indian spinners, particularly Harbhajan Singh for criticising the Kanpur pitch. ?This is the problem with your spinners that they start expecting the pitch to turn from day one itself. 

?Harbhajan is a great bowler and he should stop blaming the wickets. I think a Test wicket should be like the one at Kanpur. It should not be like the Mumbai track where players like (Michael) Clarke can take six wickets,? he said. 

Akram also favoured including Yuvraj Singh in the Test team. ?Yuvraj is a better player. He should be in the Test squad?, he said. 

Akram came to the defence of beleaguered Sourav Ganguly saying that the Indian captain needed to be backed up by his teammates. 

 Pak contract 

Pakistan is set to introduce a contract system for cricketers with maximum yearly salaries of around $42,000, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said in Karachi on Tuesday. 

?It is finally confirmed that top players will sign central contracts before leaving for Australia on Saturday,? PCB spokesman Abbas Zaidi said.

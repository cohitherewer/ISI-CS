 Berlin: German television viewers voted seven-time Formula One world champion Michael Schumacher the country?s sportsman of the 20th century on Friday. Eight-time Olympic canoe gold-medallist Birgit Fischer was second and tennis champion Steffi Graf third in the poll, carried out some four years after most of the rest of the world decided their favourites. Schumacher, 35, has won the world championship seven times while Fischer, 42, won her eight gold medals for both East German and reunited Germany in Olympics over 24 years dating back to Moscow in 1980.

 Graf, 35, won 22 Grand Slam titles and was ranked No. 1 in the world for a record 186 consecutive weeks. She held the top ranking for a total of 377 weeks ? another record. ?I never would have expected an honour like this,? said Schumacher, who won his seventh title this year. ?It?s a total surprise.?

 Mumbai: Title-favourites India overpowered minnows West Indies 60-42, after leading comfortably at 36-23, in their second league match from pool A in the first-ever kabaddi World Cup here on Saturday.

 The hosts, who had comfortably beaten Thailand 50-29 in their first match on Friday, looked much faster and fitter than their opponents and literally toyed with them before recording the comprehensive win. Vikas proved hero for India. He excelled both in defence and attack and was always a threat to his rivals. He notched up seven useful points after India took a 15-5 lead in the early part of the match. With Navneet Chauhan and Shailesh Sawant also chipping in with five points each the hosts took a comfortable 28-12 lead and were sitting pretty at 36-23 at the break.

 Bucharest: Anghel Iordanescu resigned as Romania coach on Friday after coming under intense criticism for his side?s draw against Armenia in a World Cup qualifier on Wednesday. Romania, depleted by injuries and suspensions, lost top spot in Group One after a 1-1 draw in Yerevan which handed Armenia their first point in five matches. ?I resign as Romania coach after the result in Yerevan,? Iordanescu said. ?I assume complete responsibility for my team?s poor performance.?

 Rio de Janeiro: Police say they will file murder charges against Sao Caetano club officials for the death of defender Serginho, who collapsed on the field and died of heart failure last month. The club?s president and doctor knew Serginho had heart trouble but let him play anyway, the police said on Friday.

 Murder charges will be filed against president Nairo Ferreira de Souza and doctor Paulo Fortes, police said. 

 London Colney: Manager Arsene Wenger says Arsenal could offer 35-year-old Dutch forward Dennis Bergkamp a new one-year contract for next season. Wenger said on Friday: ?For Bergkamp, the case is quite simple. We always sit together in April or May and we have a frank discussion ? and that will happen.? 

 New Delhi: Indian Railways team won the first-ever gold medal in the 16th world railway chess championship held in Slovakia. The seven-member Indian team won all seven rounds by defeating Slovakia, Chorvatsko, France, Poland, Bulgaria and Nemecko in the championship that had contestants from 22 countries.

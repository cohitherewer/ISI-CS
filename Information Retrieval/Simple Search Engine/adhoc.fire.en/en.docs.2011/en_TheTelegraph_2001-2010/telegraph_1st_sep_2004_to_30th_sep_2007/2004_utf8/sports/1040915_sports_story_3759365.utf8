 Pakistan face Kenya 

Today 

Birmingham: Heavy rain forced the Champions Trophy match between Pakistan and Kenya at Edgbaston on Tuesday to be postponed until Wednesday. 

Kenya lost their opening pool C match against India by 98 run on Saturday, while Pakistan are still waiting to begin their campaign. 

Rain halted play between England and Zimbabwe at Edgbaston last Friday, meaning the sides had to complete the match Saturday. England won by 152 runs.

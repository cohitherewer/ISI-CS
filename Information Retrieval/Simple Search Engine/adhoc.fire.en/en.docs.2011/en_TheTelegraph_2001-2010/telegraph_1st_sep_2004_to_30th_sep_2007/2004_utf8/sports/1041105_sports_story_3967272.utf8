 Five in a row for Anand

 - Corsica masters - Rublevsky no match for world No. 2 

 Anand asserted his superiority with ease against Rublevsky 

Bastia: World No. 2 Viswanathan Anand won his fifth consecutive Corsica Masters chess title beating Russian Sergei Rublevsky in the final on Thursday. 

Anand collected the winner?s cheque of Euro 20,000 while Rublevsky got the runners-up cheque of Euro 12,000. 

Earlier in the semis, Anand defeated French hope Etienne Bacrot 2-0. 

Anand?s win in the Euro 100,000 prize money tournament comes right on the heels of the biennial Chess Olympiad in Spain. Anand, leading the Indian team from the top board, had signed off with a fine performance and headed straight to Bastia. 

Keeping a clean slate Anand completed a 2-0 whitewash of Rublevsky making the score look no different from his earlier two rounds, where he defeated Bacrot and Gurevich. 

Anand asserted his superiority with ease, as he took the first game of the final with black pieces. 

Rublevsky known for his theoretical strength, chose the scotch ending and was made to eat the humble pie in just 23 moves. 

In the second game, Anand faced Rublevsky?s Silian Paulsen and took control of the game early. Seizing the initiative, Anand completed a rout of the Russian. 

In the semi-finals, Anand had signed off with a fine performance. Showing no signs of fatigue from the Olympiad, Anand, employing the Ruy Lopez, scored a fine victory with black pieces in the first game. 

Anand then won the reverse game with white pieces rather comfortably. Bacrot tried out the 2b6 in the Sicilian, but Anand took the centre early and his knight sacrifice in the 17th turn split the black territory. 

The Frenchman obliged immediately, blundering his queen for two minor pieces in the very next move. 

Making his moves in double quick time, Anand gave his rook for a centralised knight and completed a 2-0 victory by 30th move. 

In the second semi-final, Russian Grandmaster Rublevsky came up trumps against countryman Motylev. Drawing the first game with white pieces, Rublevsky found the right energy in the second Sicilian game.

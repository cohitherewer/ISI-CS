 Kambli, Agarkar rescue Mumbai

 Vinod Kambli 

Mumbai: Stand-in skipper Vinod Kambli cracked an unbeaten half century and teamed up with Ajit Agarkar to resurrect the Mumbai first innings on the second day of the Ranji Trophy Elite Group A match here Wednesday. 

After restricting Madhya Pradesh first innings to 255, the hosts were in the dumps at 87 for five before Kambli (68 not out) and Agarkar (unbeaten 37) pulled out of the hole to close the day at 171 for five. 

The two had put on 84 runs in 19.2 overs for the unbroken sixth wicket partnership when umpires Francis Gomes and K.G. Lakshminarayanan called off play with 6.4 overs left due to poor visibility. The defending champions are still 84 runs adrift of the visitors first innings total. 

Kambli entered the scene when the hosts and reigning champions were gasping at 38 for three. Two more wickets fell before Agarkar joined him to help Mumbai with some fine batting. 

The hosts were rocked by a three-wicket burst from first change bowler Sunil Dholpure who sent back opener Wasim Jaffer (22), Amol Muzumdar (6) and Wilkin Mota (9) after the early damage had been done by new ball bowlers S. Pandey and Shantanu Pitre. 

Earlier, resuming at the overnight 164 for 7, Madhya Pradesh kept the hosts on the field for the entire first session before finally being dismissed 16 minutes after lunch.

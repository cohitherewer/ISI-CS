 Anand, Surya rested in 1st tie

 Sasikiran to lead team on board one vs Uruguay 

Mallorca: Viswanathan Anand will not be fielded in India?s first-round match against unfancied Uruguay in the 36th Chess Olympiad here, giving a chance to Krishnan Sasikiran to lead the team on board one. 

The biggest chess event has 124 teams in fray with 14 rounds in all to determine the winners. Russia once again are the top seeds in the men?s section despite the absence of two big guns ? Garri Kasparov and Vladimir Kramnik. Ukraine, Israel and Armenia are seeded second, third and fourth, respectively. 

It is expected to be an easy outing for fifth seeded Indian men when they take on Uruguay. 

The Uruguay team has just one Grandmaster ? Andres Rodriguez ? in their ranks and he will take on Sasikiran with white pieces. 

On the remaining three boards, P. Harikrishna will play as white against International Master Bernardo Mailhe Roselli, Abhijit Kunte will have black against Fide Master Curi Gabriel while Sandipan Chanda will have the favourable colour against FM Alejandro Bouza. 

The other Indian to take rest apart from Anand in the first game is national champion Surya Sekhar Ganguly. 

In the women?s section, India, seeded sixth, will take on Mexico in the first round . Koneru Humpy will lead the Indian challenge. (PTI)

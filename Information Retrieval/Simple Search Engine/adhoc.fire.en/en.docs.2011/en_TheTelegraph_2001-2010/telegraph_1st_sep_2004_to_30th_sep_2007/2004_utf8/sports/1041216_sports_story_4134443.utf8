 Venkatesh upsets Surya Sekhar

 - NATIONAL A MEET 

- Sandipan in sole lead after round 15 

 Overnight leader Surya Sekhar Ganguly lost in 27 moves 

Visakhapatnam: Overnight leader and defending champion Grandmaster Surya Sekhar Ganguly was made to bite the dust by M. R. Venkatesh while GM Koneru Humpy went down to International Master Rahul Shetty in the 15th round of the 42nd National A chess championship on Wednesday. 

Ganguly?s loss turned out to be gain for GM Sandipan Chanda as he emerged as the sole leader with 10.5 points and the former now trails him by a half point with an extra game in hand. 

With just four rounds remaining in this 19-player event, GM Abhijit Kunte of PSPB is firmly glued to the third spot with nine points in his kitty along with Venkatesh. 

For Ganguly, it turned out to be a bad day with white pieces. Up against the Sicilian Sveshnikov of Venkatesh, he turned down a draw offer in the evenly poised middle game and strove harder. 

However, a few moves later the reigning national champion missed a tactical trick that was about to cost heavy material and lost in 27 moves. 

Earlier in the day, PSPB?s Chanda drew with teammate Neelotpal Das in quick time. 

Shetty, who had lost seven of his earlier games, came back strongly to beat Humpy, who was outdone in a Sicilian Paulsen game with black pieces. 

The IM grabbed a couple of pawns in the ensuing endgame and even though his endgame technique was not quite up to the mark, it proved enough as Humpy lost on time in 66 moves. 

In other important games of the day, GM Tejas Bakre of Indian Airlines drew with Prathamesh Mokal while former national champion IM P. Konguvel of PSPB accounted for Tamil Nadu?s Deepan Chakravarthy. 

Earlier in the 14th round, Surya and Sandipan Chanda of PSPB were in joint lead after splitting points on Tuesday. It was more of a shadow boxing in their Italian game. As soon as the middle game arrived, it was clear that none would be able to make much headway. The draw was a just result.

Calcutta: It was vintage East Bengal in full flow. Stunning. Spectacular. And arguably their best performance of the year so far. 

The brutality of their 4-1 demolition of Mohammedan Sporting in the IFA Shield match at the Kalyani Stadium, near here, on Friday was breathtaking, and deserved accolades with many more such adjectives. Paolo Roberto da Silva scored twice, Dipak Mondal and substitute Dipankar Roy poured more humiliation on the black-and-white outfit. Siddharth Thapa?s late reducer bore no meaning in the eventual course of the match as East Bengal were too good, too hot and too classy for the hapless opponents. 

The brilliantly manicured ground, however, had a big role to play in East Bengal?s absolute reign in the match. The likes of Shylo Malsawmtluanga, Climax Lawrence, Alvito D?Cunha, Sasthi Duley and Syed Rahim Nabi looked an inspired lot and with their jinking run down the flanks, their nice little one-twos with each other and natural use of the space, set the ground afire. 

On arrival in the city following the quarter final exit in the AFC Cup in Damascus, coach Subhas Bhowmick soundly and clearly had spelled out his agenda that he would eye winning every match from now on. 

His intentions were reflected in the team?s show right from the word go. In the sixth minute, a right-wing move involving Malsawmtluanga, Paolo and Nabi saw Climax collecting the ball inside the box. Only a timely tackle from Naushad Moosa denied him. But there was the new Brazilian recruit, operating with intensity and ingenuity near the box and six minutes later, he opened the floodgates. 

It was borne to another Malsawmtluanga?s jinking run down the right. He outsped left-back Syed Aga Abdul Wahid and squared from the goalline for Paolo to stab in. 

On came another move, in the 20th minute, almost out of nothing and Dipak loped up on an adventure. The East Bengal central defender played a quick exchange of pass with Malsawmtluanga to release himself down the middle. Dipak took guard as the rival defenders stood bewildered by the swiftness of the move and coolly placed in to Gopal Das? left side. Certainly the best goal of the match. 

Within six minutes, came another goal, but it was ruled off-side. Climax released Alvito on the left and his attempt was partially parried by the goalkeeper. Paolo was nearby to head home, but the assistant referee put the flag up, cancelling the Brazilian?s effort. 

Two minutes later, it was now Malsawmtluanga?s turn. He brilliantly dodged his way through the dual challenge of Moosa and Ratan Singh and with Gopal facing him, the diminutive Manipuri boy shot well over the crossbar. 

It was one-way traffic and the way once Louis Aniweta casually blocked Raman Vijayan back at the opposite end, should be brushed aside as aberration. 

There was no respite for Mridul Banerjee?s team even after the breather. Paolo?s free-kick hit the corsspiece, Nabi headed wide from close and Sasthi shot straight at Gopal from inside the six-yard box before the Brazilian found the target for the second time. 

It was again a Malsawmtluanga centre from the right. Climax flicked on for Paolo, who chested the ball down and blasted home on turn. 

In between there was a rare Mohammedan Sporting attack, but Aniweta came in Stanley Festus? way in time with Sangram Mukherjee failing to block a Henry Chukwukei pass. 

There was no such conviction in Mohammedan Sporting defenders as Dipankar, who replaced Alvito in the 68th minute, followed an inspiring through from Climax. His sudden pace left Wahid behind and took Gopal out of his line and his eventual placement was spot-on. As the East Bengal players went up to join the fun out there, Thapa collected a ball on a counter-move and beat Sangram to reduce the margin.

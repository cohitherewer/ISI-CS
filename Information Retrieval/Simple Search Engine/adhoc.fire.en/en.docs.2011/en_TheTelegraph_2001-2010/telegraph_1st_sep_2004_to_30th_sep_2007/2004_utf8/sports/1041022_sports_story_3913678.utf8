 Pratima seeks ?fair hearing? from IWF 

New Delhi: Banned weightlifter Pratima Kumari has sought a ?fair hearing? from the International Weightlifting Federation (IWF) claiming that she never took any banned substance knowingly or otherwise. 

The lifter has written to the IWF chief Tamas Ajan asking that she be allowed to present her case before the apex body. 

Pratima?s lawyer Sushil Salwan said on Thursday that the lifter has not raised any specific objection in the letter and has only sought a hearing according to the Wada and IOC rules. 

?She can either challenge the procedure or the findings of the Athens laboratory which carried out the tests,? he said. 

Salwan said Pratima has provided a ?brief draft? of the incidents that took place in the lead-up to the Olympics, including her training stint in Belarus to the world body. 

?She has also asked for the A and B sample ratio report,? he said. 

According to the content of the letter, which she despatched on Wednesday, the deadline for launching an appeal, Pratima has refuted ?all the allegations? made against her. Pratima has been banned for life by the Indian Olympic Association.?I can establish and demonstrate the same,? she said. (PTI)

 Chelsea, Arsenal win high-scoring derbies

London: Dutch winger Arjen Robben was again in inspirational form to keep Chelsea on top as the English club and Arsenal won high-scoring derbies in the Premier League on Saturday. 

Arsenal exploited some woeful Tottenham Hotspur defending to briefly go top with a 5-4 victory at their north London rivals before Robben scored the second for Chelsea in a 4-1 win at Fulham later in the west London derby. 

The champions ended a run of three league matches without a win in the joint highest scoring match in Premier League history through Thierry Henry, a Lauren penalty, Patrick Vieira, Fredrik Ljungberg and Robert Pires. 

Czech striker Milan Baros hit a hattrick, including a last-minute penalty, to give Liverpool a 3-2 win over improving Crystal Palace. 

Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger made light of his team?s defensive frailties after the victory. 

The champions returned to their attacking best in a match that equalled the highest goal tally in a Premier League fixture. But, without the injured Sol Campbell, the Arsenal defence has sprung some alarming leaks. 

?Sometimes derbies are very tight with no chances and sometimes they are crazy, this was the crazy version,? Wenger said. ?It is strange because last season we had the best defence in the league, the same defence, so I don?t know why suddenly it?s gone like this.? 

Thierry Henry cancelled out Noureddine Naybet?s opener in first-half stoppage time and Arsenal held a two-goal lead thrice. Each time, however, they allowed Tottenham back into the match and Wenger was a relieved man at the final whistle. (Reuters)

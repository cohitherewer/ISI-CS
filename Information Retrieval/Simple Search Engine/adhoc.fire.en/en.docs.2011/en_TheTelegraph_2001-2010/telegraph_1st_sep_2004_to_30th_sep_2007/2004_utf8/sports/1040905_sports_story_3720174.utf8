 Henman fights on

 ALIX RAMSAY IN NEW YORK 

 Tim Henman has a bad back 

It is all Tim Henmans own fault. If he had not been as successful at the French Open, he would not have been so tired. If he had not been so tired, he would not have taken quite so much time off after Wimbledon playing golf. And if he had not played so much golf, he would not have the bad back that was causing him problems as the US Open began. 

In hindsight, I wouldnt be surprised if another game, one with a small white ball, had something to do with it, he said with a rueful smile. 

I was pretty tired and, on reflection, I was pretty stiff and doing a lot of stretching. I think just using a different movement, one youre not quite used to, I think that had something to do with it. 

So far his back is improving daily Thursday was his first practice session and he was tentatively trying out the business of lunging for low volleys but the injury may prove to be a blessing in disguise. He now stands one match away from the fourth round, equalling his best showing at Flushing Meadow. 

As he made his way through the rounds of the French Open, he was feeling ill. A virus had felled him at the start of the event and his main concern was whether he had the energy to stand up to another long match. That, occupied his mind, leaving him no time to worry about his chances. As a result, he played out of his skin. His bad back here may just work the same magic.Because I know how I felt on Sunday morning, it feels like everything is a bonus, he said. There are times when Ive wanted to win too much and my focus has just been on winning and losing. 

Its highlighted when Im just unsure about whether Im going to finish the match or start the match. All of a sudden theres not even the slightest bit of concern about winning or losing because Im just thinking: am I physically fit to play? When Im on the court in that frame of mind, Im relaxed and then I play well. 

Michal Tabara is the next in line for Henman. The 25-year-old Czech qualifier normally earns his corn on the Challenger circuit and this year he has only played two matches on the main tour.

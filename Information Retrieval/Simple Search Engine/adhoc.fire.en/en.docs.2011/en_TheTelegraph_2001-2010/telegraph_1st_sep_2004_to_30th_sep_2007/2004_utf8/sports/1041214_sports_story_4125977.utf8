 Beware of Pakistan, says Gilchrist 

Perth: Australian vice-captain Adam Gilchrist has warned his team against writing off Pakistan ahead of Thursday?s first Test. 

?All of us have seen Pakistan blow hot and cold, whether it?s a tour match or an international game, so we?ll be wary of them,? Gilchrist said. 

Gilchrist echoed the sentiments of opening batsman Justin Langer who said Shoaib Akhtar, the world?s fastest bowler, remains the trump card for the visitors. 

?They have that ability and the attacking flair of their players and Shoaib is a prime example,? he said. 

?He?s done it to us before, you give him a bowling spell where he can come on, particularly with reverse swing at his pace, and he can take five for 20 in one spell and totally end an innings.? 

The 29-year-old Akhtar has a career average of 24.32, but his form against Australia is not as solid with an average of 40.10, although he did capture five for 21 against them in October 2002 during a Test in neutral Colombo. 

Akhtar has bowled little so far on this tour and completed only 17 overs during Pakistan?s 10-wicket rout by Western Australia. But the team management said he is fit. 

Langer said earlier this week he agreed with the way the speedster had been used so far, arguing that he puts everything he has into each delivery, making him a formidable opponent. 

?From what I?ve seen of their batting ? it has the flair where they can take it away from you in a short space of time,? Gilchrist said. (AFP)

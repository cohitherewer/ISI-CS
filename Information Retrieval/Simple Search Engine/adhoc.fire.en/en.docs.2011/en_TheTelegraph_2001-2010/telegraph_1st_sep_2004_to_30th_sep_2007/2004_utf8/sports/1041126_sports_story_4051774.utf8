 Lanka board cautions Murali

 Murali lucky to get away lightly 

Colombo: Sri Lanka spinner Muttiah Muralidharan has received an official caution from his board over contentious comments made in an unauthorised interview on an Australian radio show two weeks ago. 

Muralidharan, who is in Melbourne having his injured right shoulder assessed, stirred up controversy when he argued on air that the actions of Australian pacers Glenn McGrath, Jason Gillespie and Brett Lee could be deemed as illegal. 

Muralidharan has since denied the claim that he had labelled them ?chuckers?, saying he was misinterpreted by the media while arguing his point that the Australian trio, like many other international bowlers, flexed their arms more then currently permitted. 

Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) was annoyed by Muralidharan?s comments and wanted to take firm disciplinary action, but its lawyers recommended only a caution after concluding that current player contracts were too vague on the issue of unauthorised media interviews. (Reuters)

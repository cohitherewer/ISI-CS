 Roddick to lead US vs Spain 

 Roddick has a sparkling 14-3 Davis Cup record in singles play 

New York: World number two Andy Roddick will lead the US against Spain in the Davis Cup final next month. 

Mardy Fish and the doubles team of Bob and Mike Bryan complete the squad for the December 3-5 tie in Seville. 

?Playing against a Spanish team that includes two former world number one players and two French Open champions on a clay court before 15,000 fans is the ultimate challenge and test for our team,? US captain Patrick McEnroe, said in a statement. 

?Nothing would be sweeter and more satisfying than to win the Davis Cup in this environment and our guys are certainly excited about the opportunity that is in front of them.? 

Roddick, the former world number one who cracked a record 155 mph serve in the 4-0 US victory over Belarus earlier this year, will warm up for the Davis Cup by playing in next week?s ATP Masters Cup. 

The former US Open champion has a sparkling 14-3 Davis Cup record in singles play and has not lost a set in six singles matches this year. 

The United States return to the Davis Cup final for the first time since 1997 but has not won the competition since 1995 when Pete Sampras accounted for all three points in a 3-2 upset over Russia in Moscow. 

Spain won the Davis Cup in 2000 and reached the finals last year but lost to Australia in Melbourne.

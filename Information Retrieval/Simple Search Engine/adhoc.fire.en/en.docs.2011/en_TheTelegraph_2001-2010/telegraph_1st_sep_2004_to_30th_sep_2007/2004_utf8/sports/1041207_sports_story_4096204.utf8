 India eye points versus under-strength Germany

 - CHAMPIONS TROPHY 

 - Morale of the side is high, says Dilip Tirkey 

 Dilip Tirkey 

Lahore: The beleaguered Indian team would be seeking to earn their first points when they take on an under-strength Germany in the third round of the Champions Trophy hockey meet at the National Stadium here on Tuesday. 

After the battering they received at the hands of Spain and defending champions The Netherlands, India would like to believe that their toughest ties are behind them. But they would have to put in a far more inspired performance in the matches ahead to revive their sagging fortunes. 

Germany, who have sent an experimental side in order to focus on the 2006 World Cup and the 2008 Beijing Games, appear to be everyone?s favourite punching bag. 

They were pounded by both Pakistan and Spain in their earlier two games and seem headed for another last place finish like last year. 

India, who are yet to open the account and are ahead of Germany and New Zealand owing to a better goal difference, have everything to play for. 

However, putting on a brave face, Indian captain Dilip Tirkey on Monday said despite back-to-back losses, the morale of his side was high and the players were still focussed on finishing on top. 

?We were disappointed after our loss to Spain but we did well against Holland even though we lost it. We came close but could not force a point from the match and that was because we conceded several goals,? Tirkey said. 

?The morale of the players is certainly not down since they know their potential. The unfortunate part is that though we played well against The Netherlands, we still ended on the losing side,? he said. 

The Netherlands, hosts Pakistan and in-form Spain, who also resume action after Monday?s rest day, have six points each. 

A victory on Tuesday would not only act as a confidence-booster but also provide some relief to coach Gerhard Rach. 

If the first two outings were any indication, India have not played to their potential as yet. They made a number of ?silly mistakes? and paid the price through the nose. 

The forward line was pathetic in the first game against Spain when the strikers missed sitters, but against Holland, it clicked somewhat scoring four goals at crucial times to offer some challenge to the formidable European outfit. 

The defence, however, continues to be the worrying factor with captain Dilip Tirkey, on whom the team relies heavily, appearing off-colour. 

The terrible form of other defenders coupled with a series of errors by the two goalkeepers Adrian D?Souza and Devesh Chauhan, who were superb in the two-match Test series against Spain just a week ago, has compounded problems. 

India face Pakistan on Wednesday and New Zealand on Friday before Sunday?s classification matches. 

The Netherlands, seeking to win their third title in a row, look set to go all the way even though they are yet to face the two strong teams ? Pakistan (on Tuesday) and Spain. 

Pakistan, under captain Waseem Ahmed, could give a tough challenge to the Dutch supremacy as several of their players including ace drag flicker Sohail Abbas appear in good nick. 

Spain, the Olympic semi-finalists, are expected to steamroll New Zealand even though the team from Down Under has shown tremendous resilience despite their two defeats. 

?Having won two matches by a big margin is quite good and I am optimistic that my team will continue with the same form in coming matches,? Spanish captain Juan Escarre said, making his side?s intentions clear.

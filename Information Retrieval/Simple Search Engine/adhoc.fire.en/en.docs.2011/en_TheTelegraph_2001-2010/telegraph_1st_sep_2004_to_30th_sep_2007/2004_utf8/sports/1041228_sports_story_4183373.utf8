Durban: A brilliant 162 by Jacques Kallis enabled South Africa pile up a huge 193-run lead on the second day of the second Test on Monday. 

In reply to England?s first innings total of 139, the hosts were all out for 332. 

Earlier, South Africa were 233 for seven at tea, 94 runs ahead of England?s first innings of 139 all out. 

Kallis was unbeaten on 96, having hit 12 fours in 184 balls. Nicky Boje was giving him company on 11. 

Kallis and Shaun Pollock shared the biggest stand of the match by putting on 87 runs for the seventh wicket after South Africa lost three quick wickets for 38 runs in the morning session. 

England captain Michael Vaughan came on as part-time spinner in the absence of the injured Ashley Giles and six overs before tea dismissed Pollock for 43, when the South African allrounder edged a ball that drifted down the leg side to wicketkeeper Geraint Jones. 

South Africa had resumed the day on 70 for three and lost their fourth wicket in the sixth over of the morning when Martin van Jaarsveld dragged fast bowler Andrew Flintoff on to his stumps. 

Fellow paceman Steve Harmison, who took two for 20 on Sunday, struck for the third time 10 overs before lunch when debutant Hashim Amla gloved a stinger to Jones. 

Both batsmen took their time making just one run, Van Jaarsveld facing 17 balls in 27 minutes and Amla occupying the crease for 43 minutes and facing 31 deliveries. 

England bowled with discipline to restrict the South Africans to just 69 runs in the morning session but Kallis and Pollock scored more freely in the afternoon as England?s bowlers wilted in the heat. 

Both teams wore black armbands as a mark of respect for those killed by tidal waves in southern Asia.

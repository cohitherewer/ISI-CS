 Rebel Kenyans demand prize money

Nairobi: Rebel Kenyan cricket players have demanded their prize money from the 2003 World Cup and the Champions Trophy in England be paid in full by the Kenya Cricket Association (KCA) before they agree to any new deal. 

The players, who boycotted an ICC?s Continental Cup qualifier against Namibia last weekend in dispute over new contracts, met on Thursday after the Kenyan sports minister Ochilo Ayacko intervened. 

?We want all our outstanding allowances and salaries from last month to be paid in full before we start everything on a clean sheet ,? Steve Tikolo, former national team captain, said. (AFP)

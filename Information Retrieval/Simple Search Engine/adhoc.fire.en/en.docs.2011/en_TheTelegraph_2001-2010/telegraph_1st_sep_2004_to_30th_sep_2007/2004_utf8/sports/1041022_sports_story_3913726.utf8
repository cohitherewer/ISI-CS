 Ecclestone to sue Jackie Stewart

London: Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone is to sue Jackie Stewart, the president of the British Racing Drivers? Club (BRDC), for libel in the ongoing row about the future of the British Grand Prix. 

Ecclestone, who is set to remove the British GP at Silverstone from the 2005 F1 calendar after talks with the BRDC broke down over financial terms and contract length, was angered by comments Stewart made in a BBC radio interview on Wednesday. 

Ecclestone?s lawyers said in a statement issued on Thursday that the libel proceedings related in particular to Stewart suggesting that Ecclestone had ?reneged on alleged promises given to the (UK) minister of sport? which might have saved the race. 

?Mr Ecclestone, who has made it clear that he has tried hard to keep the British Grand Prix, and has explained his frustration at why this seems to be impossible in light of failed negotiations with the BRDC, is not suing the BBC, rather just its interviewee,? lawyer Simon Smith said. 

Meanwhile, talks with track owners the BRDC broke down over financial terms and contract length Thursday. 

The BRDC is looking for a two-year contract which would give them time to plan and secure the long-term future of the GP, but Ecclestone has demanded a seven-year contract.

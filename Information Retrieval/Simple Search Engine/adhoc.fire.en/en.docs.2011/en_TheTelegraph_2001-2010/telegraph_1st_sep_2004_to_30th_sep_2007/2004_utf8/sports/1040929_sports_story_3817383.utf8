The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Hectic lobbying against a ?rubber-stamp? presidency

 A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: As the hobnobbing on the eve of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) elections reached a feverish pitch, former president Inderjit Singh Bindra has called for a professional set-up of the body in running its affairs. 

Bindra, who heads the Punjab Cricket Association, said: ?The need of the hour is professional management within the Board. 

We need a whole-time CEO, which even smaller nations have. 

?If we had a professional system in place, this telecast crisis, for example, could have been dealt with in time.? 

On the PCA proposing Sharad Pawar?s name, Bindra quipped: ?I had got my nomination from the West when I became president. It?s our turn to return the favour. 

?To fight against Jagmohan Dalmiya you need a giant and not a pygmy. There were only two candidates (the other being Ranbir Singh Mahendra) and Pawar will definitely be doing a better job. He has for long been associated with the Maharashtra Olympic Association and more recently the Mumbai Cricket Association.? 

Bindra, who is in the city on a ?courtesy visit? after seven years, did not wish to get into the numbers game. 

?I have had my time and maintain my promise not to return to the fold. The best example of retiring gracefully is Biswanath Dutt. I only hope I can emulate him.? 

Bindra did not see any problems in mixing sport with politics. 

?There are number of politicians who head sporting bodies all over the world. I don?t find any harm in that,? he said. 

This, though, wasn?t what Ranbir Singh felt. ?Politics and sports should not mix,? he said, while sounding pretty confident of victory. 

Another former president, Raj Singh Dungarpur, who has been canvassing for Pawar, felt the ?presidency will be diluted? if Ranbir was elected to the post. 

?I?ve known Dalmiya and Ranbir for more than 20 years. We?ve got to see to it that we don?t have a rubber-stamp president. 

With Dalmiya as patron in-chief, the election of Mahendra as president would ensure that Dalmiya would be all over the Board. 

?We?ve to see to it that the line of control between the patron-in-chief and president is not breached.? 

Dungarpur felt Dalmiya for the first time in his life was ?facing defeat in the face? and also did not rule out any ?foul play? by the rival camp at the last minute.

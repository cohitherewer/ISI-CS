The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Vaughan confident of turning the tables

London: Michael Vaughan is confident his team can put an end to the miserable losing streak against Australia when they meet the world champions in the Champions Trophy semis. ?Australia are the best team and are playing some good stuff. We are looking forward to testing ourselves against the best team.? 

?We will try to play in a positive fashion. Many of our players have not played against Australia before so it will be a big experience. The Australians have been playing cricket on a different level and it is up to the rest of the world to catch up. ?We are looking forward to a big, tough game.? 

Not for the first time this summer, Andrew Flintoff was England?s messiah with a blistering century against Sri Lanka and the all-rounder admitted his heroics were achieved with a new bat. 

?I get a new bat every three weeks,? said Flintoff. ?There was something wrong with the last one I used. At the moment I am enjoying it all. I rode my luck early on against Sri Lanka when the ball was nipping about but it seems to be that sort of summer when everything is going right for me.? 

England, resuming from their overnight 118 for three after Friday?s play had been disrupted, went on to make a formidable 251 with Flintoff making 104. 

Sri Lanka struggled to 95 for five from 24 overs when rain ruined a potentially exciting finish though by then England were firmly in control. ?It is always disappointing when rain interrupts but we felt we were in command. To score 250 on that wicket was tremendous,? said Vaughan. 

?Steve Harmison and Darren Gough put the top order under pressure, as they always do, and I know Sri Lanka would have fancied their chances if it had not rained but we were confident of winning.? 

Maravan Atapattu saluted Flintoff. ?Flintoff was fabulous. He did a tremendous job getting England to 251.

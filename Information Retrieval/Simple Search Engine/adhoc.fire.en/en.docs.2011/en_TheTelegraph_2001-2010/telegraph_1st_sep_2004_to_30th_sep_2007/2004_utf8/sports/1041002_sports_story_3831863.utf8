 MCA to file petition at Calcutta HC

Pune: After being prevented from casting his voting in the elections for the BCCI president?s post, Maharashtra Cricket Association (MCA) chairperson Dhyaneshwar Agashe said a writ petition will be filed in the Calcutta High Court to challenge the decision. 

MCA would file a writ petition in Calcutta High Court because: ?I, as its representative, was prevented from voting in the election,? he said on Friday. 

Agashe said the MCA managing committee had passed a resolution authorising him to represent the body in the meetings of the BCCI. 

?In fact, I had attended two working committee meeting and one special AGM of the board on the basis of the authorisation,? he said, expressing surprise at the BCCI?s decision to prevent him from voting in Wednesday? elections.

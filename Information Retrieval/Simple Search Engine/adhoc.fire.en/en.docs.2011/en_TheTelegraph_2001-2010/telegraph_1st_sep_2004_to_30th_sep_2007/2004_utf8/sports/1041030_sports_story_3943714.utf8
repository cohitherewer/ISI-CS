The Telegraph - Calcutta

 India didn?t have the stomach for battle: Steve

Sydney: Former Australian captain Steve Waugh 

said India did not have the stomach for the battle and termed Australia?s series 

win as a ?triumph of team unity and attention to detail?. 

?Quite simply they didn?t have the stomach for battle and didn?t bear any resemblance to the rampaging unit that smashed us around in Australia last season,? Waugh, who led Australia on the 2001 tour of India, wrote in The Daily Telegraph website on Friday. 

Waugh, who famously declared four years ago that his world-beating side which won 16 Tests on the trot could not be called ?invincibles? until they conquered the Final Frontier, praised Adam Gilchrist?s men for their planning and discipline. 

?Australia were relentless, India were restless and the crushing defeat in this series was a triumph for team unity and attention to detail,? said the former captain with most number of Test wins. 

?The heavyweight battle turned into a lopsided contest as India?s much-revered batting order dissolved under Australia?s stifling pressure.? 

In 2001, Australia had won the first Test but V.V.S. Laxman and Rahul Dravid shared a record 376-run partnership in the second Test at Calcutta that marked the Indian turnaround and the hosts ultimately won the series 2-1. 

Waugh said he had ?mixed feelings? about Australia?s win in the third Test in Nagpur on Friday which gave them their first series win in India since 1968-69. 

?Last time around we had won 16 Tests in a row and were one wicket away from a series win before we ran into one of the all-time great partnerships. Perhaps we took it for granted. 

?This time around no stone has been left unturned and that has been the best lesson learned. 

?I have mixed feelings watching Australia?s great 

victory, with a part of me wishing I was there. But I also feel satisfaction knowing 

that I played a part in the development of such a great side.?

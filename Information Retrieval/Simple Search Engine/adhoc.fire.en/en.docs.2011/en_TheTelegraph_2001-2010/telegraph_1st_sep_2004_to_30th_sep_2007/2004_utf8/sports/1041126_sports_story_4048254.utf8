London: AC Milan, Barcelona and PSV Eindhoven all clinched their places in the Champions League knockout stage on Wednesday but only Milan did so with a victory. 

They qualified with a convincing 4-0 home win over Shakhtar Donetsk of Ukraine in group F with Hernan Crespo and Kaka each scoring twice, taking Milan to 12 points. 

Barcelona (10 points) made it through despite being held 1-1 at the Nou Camp by Scottish champions Celtic, who avoided defeat in an away Champions League match for the first time. 

African Player of the Year Samuel Eto?o put Barcelona ahead after 24 minutes as he powered through the Celtic defence to score but John Hartson equalised from a suspiciously off-side position just before half-time. 

Although Celtic (4) are out of the Champions League they can still clinch a Uefa Cup place if they match or better Shakhtar?s result against Barcelona on December 7, the night they face Milan in Glasgow. 

Shakhtar trail in last place on three points. 

PSV (10) qualified for the first time in their ninth Champions League campaign after drawing 1-1 at home to Arsenal (7), who had Lauren and Patrick Vieira sent off within 13 minutes of each other midway through the second half. 

Andre Ooijer headed PSV ahead after eight minutes, Thierry Henry equalised in the 31st but the English champions held on for a draw and will also qualify from group E if they beat eliminated Rosenborg Trondheim (2) at home in two weeks? time. 

Rosenborg drew 2-2 with Panathinaikos (6) at home leaving the Greeks still in with a chance of progressing depending on the last results. 

Arsenal will be without Lauren and Vieira against Rosenborg and should they slip up, Panathinaikos will leapfrog them and finish second if they beat PSV in their last match. 

PSV manager Guus Hiddink said that despite making sure of their place in the last 16, they would go to Panathinaikos looking for the win to guarantee first place in the group. Inter Milan (11), already through from group G, drew 1-1 at Werder Bremen (10), who will also advance if they avoid defeat in their last match at Valencia (7) on December 7. 

Valencia won 2-1 at Anderlecht, who have now lost all five matches, and the Spaniards can still qualify. Chelsea (13) dropped their first points of the competition in a 0-0 home draw with Paris St Germain (5), who are level on points with European champions Porto, 1-0 winners at CSKA Moscow (4).

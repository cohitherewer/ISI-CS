A CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: South East Central Railways (SECR) Bilaspur overcame District Football Association (DFA) Varanasi 2-1 in a vital group A league match of the 16th Lal Bahadur Shastri Memorial football meet here Wednesday. The outcome of this match favours Mohammedan AC who now need just a draw in their last match with Titanium on Thursday to qualify for the semi-finals. 

DFA and SECR are on three points from three matches. Mohammedan AC have three points from two matches. However, if the Calcuttans lose, they get eliminated because of an inferior goal difference, and SECR will qualify.

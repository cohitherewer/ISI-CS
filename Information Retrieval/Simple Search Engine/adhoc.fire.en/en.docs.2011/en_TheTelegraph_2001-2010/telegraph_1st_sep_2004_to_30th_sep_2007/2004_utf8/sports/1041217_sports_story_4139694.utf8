 Marion sues Conte for $25 m

 Conte?s claims a vendetta, says Marion Jones 

San Francisco: Triple Olympic gold medallist Marion Jones has filed a $25 million lawsuit against accused steroid peddler Victor Conte over his claims he provided her with performance enhancing drugs. 

The suit filed in US district court in San Francisco Wednesday, charges that ?Conte defamed Jones with malice, with intent to injure Jones in her character and reputation as one of the greatest female athletes of all time? because he was motivated by ?a vendetta?, ?self-interest? and ?a long-standing grudge.? 

Conte, the founder of the infamous Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative (BALCO), is one of four men indicted on criminal charges of illegally distributing steroids to elite athletes. 

Earlier this month, Conte said in an interview with ABC Television?s 20/20 programme that he supplied Jones with several banned drugs before she won five medals ? including three golds ? at the Sydney Olympics. 

He said he instructed her on how to use them and watched as she injected herself in the leg. 

Jones? lawsuit notes that Conte had previously said he didn?t provide her with banned drugs and suggests that his ?sudden about-face on the issue, just four months before his criminal trial is anticipated, appears motivated by a desire to curry favour with prosecutors, garner sensationalised media attention, bolster Conte?s own financial and other self-interests, and harm an individual against whom Conte has a long-standing grudge.? 

Jones ? who failed to win a medal at the Athens Olympics this year ? has repeatedly denied using banned drugs, and has never failed a dope test.

 London: Organisers of Wimbledon have salted away ?2 million ($3.87 million) to cover rain disruptions after the cost of insuring themselves against the British weather became too steep, it was revealed on Wednesday.

 A Championships Ticket Refunds Reserve has been set up by the Lawn Tennis Association (LTA) ? the governing body of British tennis and joint organisers of the grasscourt Grand Slam ? members were told at their annual general meeting.

 The reserve will be used to refund spectators who see less than an hour?s play due to poor weather at the All England Club. 

 Brussels: Kim Clijsters was still hopeful of playing in next month?s Australian Open despite reports she would not be fit.

 Tournament chief executive Paul McNamee said in Melbourne that last year?s runner-up had decided not to contest the year?s first Grand Slam after her wrist failed to respond to treatment. But her spokesman said in Brussels that she had simply delayed submitting her entry.

 ?The doctors are assessing her injury on a weekly basis and if there is no risk she could play. But if there?s the least risk she will stay away,? he added.

 The Australian Open begins on January 17.

 Kuala Lumpur: Japan will play North Korea in two politically charged matches after Thursday?s draw for the final round of Asian qualifiers for the 2006 World Cup. Iran and Bahrain were also in group B alongside Asian champions Japan and North Korea.

 South Korea, who reached the semi-finals of the 2002 World Cup, will play Saudi Arabia, Uzbekistan and Kuwait in group A.

 The top two teams from each group qualify automatically for the 2006 World Cup finals in Germany while the two third-placed teams will contest a two-leg playoff. The winner will then face a further play-off against a team from the Concacaf Zone for the right to become Asia?s fifth representative.

 London: Liverpool and Millwall have been charged by the English Football Association over the crowd trouble at their League Cup match on October 26.

 Objects were thrown and seats were ripped up in ugly scenes at Millwalls New Den stadium in south-east London during Liverpools 3-0 third round victory. 

 In a statement on Thursday, the FA charged second division Millwall with failing to ensure their supporters quot;refrained from racist and/or abusive behaviour quot; and failing to prevent them throwing missiles on to the pitch.

 Liverpool were charged with failing to prevent their supporters quot;conducting themselves in threatening and/or violent and/or provocative behaviour quot;.

 The two clubs face fines and a possible order to play behind closed doors if found guilty. 

 London: Former England midfielder Paul ?Gazza? Gascoigne has been forced to pull out of a celebrity ice-skating show after injuring himself while practising with his best friend Jimmy ?Five Bellies? Gardner.

 Gazza, who announced in October he wanted to be known as G8, was set to appear in the BBC?s Strictly Come Dancing in a festive ice-skating version of the hit show. Gascoigne will be replaced by David Seaman.

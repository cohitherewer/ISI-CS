The Telegraph - Calcutta

 ?Often, there?s no better place to bat than at the very top?

 - I was instinctive? once in the middle didn?t think too much, says former Aussie opener Michael Slater 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Mumbai: With over 5,000 Test runs (including 14 centuries), Michael Slater will always be remembered as an effective (and flamboyant) opener. Slater, who quit this year after fighting a losing battle against arthritis ? an ailment which didn?t quite become public knowledge during his eight years with the Australian side ? spoke to The Telegraph exclusively about opening on the eve of the fourth and final Test here. He is in town with the TV commentary line-up. 

The following are excerpts 

On the qualities needed by an opener 

It?s tricky facing the new ball and, so, a strong technique is required... Then, strong self-belief... Once that?s there, an opener is going to enjoy facing the new ball. (After a pause) Often, there?s no better place to bat than at the very top. Equally, an opener?s slot could become the most difficult... 

On who inspired him 

Actually, I didn?t open till I was 15-16... It happened in a club game in Sydney, during the Green Shield competition at Christmas... I was slotted at No. 6 in the first match and didn?t get to bat... In the next game, one of the openers opted out and the opportunity came my way... Initially, I was hesitant but, then, realised I would at least get to bat (as opener)! 

On his favourite openers at that time 

I enjoyed watching the West Indians... Gordon Greenidge, Desmond Haynes... They were aggressive, strong on technique and great to see... Really, the openers who appealed were those who played a few more shots. 

On whether specialists alone should bat at No. 1 and No. 2 

Look, in Australia, we?ve been pretty conventional in Tests though non-regulars have opened in the one-dayers... In my view, makeshift openers don?t fit into a Test XI... In fact, even in the one-dayers, if you have orthodox openers with the right style, the job will be done. 

On how he ?psyched? himself 

I used to hit a lot of balls in the lead-up... That was my thinking time, so to say... Then, the moment I put my pads on, for a Test or one-dayer, it used to be time to draw on my self-belief and make the best of the conditions... If the very first ball was a half-volley, I would still go for it... Basically, I was an instinctive opener and, once in the middle, didn?t think too much. 

On having been a success till a disappointing 2001 

(Grins) Well, even at my best, I did have occasions when I doubted my own ability... I used to prepare well, trained very hard... Fortunately, I had many highs and didn?t experience many lows... My preparation and attitude played a significant part. 

On deciding to quit not many weeks after announcing he still had the ?fire? in his ?belly? 

I realised I wouldn?t be fit before the 2004-05 season got underway... Also, negotiations had begun for contracts from New South Wales and... As it turns out, I had to decide quicker than I would have liked... Had my recovery been faster, I may have continued for two years. 

On not having been a hit in his last full series, in India, in 2000-01 

I was going through a divorce, there was a lot of pressure from the Media... I did get starts ? three 40s ? but didn?t convert even one into a big score. But, don?t forget, it was just a three-Test series... 

On the bowler he respected most 

Look, I respected everybody, but the hardest was Wasim Akram... His speed, swing and control... He would ?rush? batsmen... 

On his all-time favourite openers (in order of ranking) 

Greenidge: Was more flamboyant than Haynes and I can?t ever forget the way he pulled. 

Haynes: Very sound technique and, obviously, he loved opening. If Greenidge left early, Haynes ensured at least he got runs. 

Matthew Hayden: He hasn?t got big scores in this series, but is prolific and has an intimidating presence... Besides, he?s a good team man and a very fine competitor. 

Sunil Gavaskar: I hardly saw him in person but, from what I?ve watched (on videos) and read, he used to be determined with a capital D and put a heavy price on his wicket ? quite like Geoffrey Boycott. In any case, you can?t argue with his record. 

On somebody who has narrowly missed making his all-time list 

Virender Sehwag... I like his approach, but he needs to be consistent... I would like him to structure his innings better... Of course, he?s great for cricket and, when he?s on song, I do love his batting. 

On the Hayden-Justin Langer combination 

It?s awesome... They maximise their potential and have done so over a period of time. Having said that, as with the other Australian players, they?re constantly looking to improve. Langer wasn?t an attacking bat when he began his career, but has definitely become one... As for Matthew, I admire him. 

On having himself forged a superb partnership with Mark Taylor 

It helped that he was a left-hander... Generally, I was the more aggressive opener but, on his day, Mark too could move into top gear. Looking back, at times, my aggression probably encouraged him to come out of his shell... We did combine excellently and were close mates. 

Finally, on young Michael Clarke being a fan of his 

(Laughs) It was great to hear that at the start of this series... Michael has a terrific future and you?re going to see a lot of him.

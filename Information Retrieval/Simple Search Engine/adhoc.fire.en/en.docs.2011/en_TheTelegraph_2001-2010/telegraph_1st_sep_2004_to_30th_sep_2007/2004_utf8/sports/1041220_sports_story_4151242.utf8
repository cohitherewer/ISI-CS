The Telegraph - Calcutta

 A saga of Rathore?s guts and glory

 - 2004 review 

 -Turning point in history of Indian shooting 

 Rathore lived up to his billing 

New Delhi: The year 2004 could easily be rated as the best for Indian shooting after Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore lived up to his billing as one of the best in the business by claiming the ultimate prize ? an Olympic medal at Athens in August. 

As the focus of the nation turned to Indian shooters following Rathore?s achievement at the Markopoulo Olympic shooting centre, few heartbreaking failures by some of the pre-games favourites escaped the wrath of critics. 

Two medal prospects ? rifle shooters Anjali Vedpathak Bhagwat and Abhinav Bindra ? ended their campaign in contrasting styles with the Mumbai woman crashing out in the first round and Bindra missing a medal by a slender margin in a nerve wracking final in the men?s 10m air rifle competition. 

But as Rathore himself put it during a felicitation function organised on his return to the capital, with some more luck it would have been a windfall for the country. 

Representing the country at the world?s biggest sporting stage were a record number of eight shooters ? Abhinav Bindra, Anjali Vedpathak Bhagwat, Deepali Deshpande, Gagan Narang, Manavjit Singh Sandhu, Mansher Singh, Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore and Suma Shirur. 

The shooters, especially Rathore, deliberately avoided media glare in the run up to the games and in the end it was the media who got the biggest reason to celebrate. 

Rathore?s climb to the pinnacle came as a result of some meticulous planning and unwavering support from the Army which played its part to perfection in making the Rajasthani?s life comfortable. 

The world No.2 admitted later that he got more determined by disturbing comments from his own countrymen about an Indian?s chances in the Olympics. 

For Anjali, all the hard work came to a nought when she crashed out in the first round of women?s 10m air rifle scoring a poor 393 out of a possible 400. No one could really explain the shocking below par performance of Anjali, who had won the champion of champions title in 2003 winning the World Cup finals, in which only the world champion and the best performers of the season can compete. 

 Anjali's hard work came 

 to nought

Anjali, who finished a dismal 20th in her pet event ? the 10m air rifle ? after being touted as a bright hope, put up another below par performance to finish joint 13th with a tally of 575 points in a field of 32 in the women?s 50 metre rifle three-position. 

In Bindra?s case it was so near yet so far. The youngster, who was training in USA and India, disappointed in the final, finishing seventh. He qualified for the final in third place with a score of 597 but could not handle the pressure and shot poorly in the title round. 

The year also saw Suma Shirur, who was all along in Anjali?s shadow, etching her own name in the history books equalling the world record with a perfect 400 in the Asian shooting championship in Malyasia in February. 

Suma shot 400/400 in the qualifying round, which made her only the sixth shooter to achieve the feat. 

Though Suma did better than Anjali by reaching the final, she failed to repeat her feat in Athens and finished eighth among eight finalists. 

As the Olympic year came to an end, the national shot gun shooting championship held in Delhi announced the huge spurt in the popularity of the sport and the arrival of a new kid on the block. 

A product of Army?s infantry kids, 19-year-old Allan Daniel Peoples stunned the pundits when he won both the senior and junior skeet titles at the Dr Karni Singh shooting range. 

The Meerut boy humbled the experienced marksmen including defending champion Naveen Jindal who was relegated to the fifth place. 

Summing up 2004 is the easiest thing to do. 

As national coach Sunny Thomas put it the year will be a turning point in the history of Indian shooting. Rest assured that with better facilities and training, India will be able to produce worthy successors to Rathore.

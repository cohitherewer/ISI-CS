New Delhi: Fragile in defence and profligate in attack, 29-time champions Bengal received what they deserved on Sunday? a 1-2 loss to Services and premature exit from the Indian Oil (IOC) Santosh Trophy. 

Services, with the victory over Bengal, topped the three-team group A in the quarter final league with hundred percent success. Bengal?s last league match with Uttar Pradesh on Tuesday is now inconsequential, as both teams have lost to Services. 

Services now meet runners-up Kerala in the first semi-final on Thursday. On Saturday, Kerala had topped group C beating hosts Delhi 2-1. 

Holders Manipur are also through to the semi-final having topped group B with six points from two matches. They routed Sikkim (without an injured Bhaichung Bhutia) 5-1, with striker T. Narendra Singh scoring four goals inlcuding a hattrick. 

This is the third successive time that Bengal, the most successful team in the tournament history, have failed to reach the last four. The last time they had reached the last four was back in the 2000 Thrissur nationals. It seems the newly introduced domicile rule has had an impact on Bengal?s domination of the Santosh Trophy. 

It was the day of the underdogs. In a group D encounter, Goa with six internationals in the team were routed by a fitter and faster Punjab1-5. 

Punjab?s burly skipper, Gurjit Singh Atwal of the Border Security Force (BSF) scored four goals including a hattrick and his feat earned him the Man of the Match award, a cash prize of Rs. 5,000. 

Goa are on three points from two matches and are out of the Santosh trophy, as they have a disastrous goal difference of minus three. Punjab (a goal difference of plus four) need just a draw in their last match with Tamil Nadu on Tuesday to progress to the semi-finals. Tamil Nadu (which lost their opening match to Goa 0-1) will have to win by three goals to oust Punjab. 

To add to Bengal coach Syed Nayeemuddin?s woes, defender Madhab Das received marching orders towards the end of the match. 

Both the goals Bengal conceded were due to defensive errors. Services scored their opening goal in added time in the first half. Goalkeeper Abhijit Mondal rushed forward to collect a harmless diagonal from the right. Bengal defence was static as they felt the goalkeeper would grip the ball. Sadly Abhijit spilled his collection and Services striker Vijay Thapa lurking in the box squared to midfielder R. Rajesh to score. 

Bengal, however, dominated the proceedings before the setback. In the 36th minute, Chandan set Nabi through on the right and his low cross was mishit by Dipendu Biswas. Two minutes later, Mehtab wide on the left sent a measured cross, which Syed Rahim Nabi dashing in failed to connect. 

Eight minutes after half time, following a combined move from the left, Services striker Shaji A. D?Silva, later adjudged Man of the Match, shielded the ball from his marker Debkumar Sasmal and fired a low shot into the net. 

In the 63rd minute came the reducer. Substitute Amit sent a defence-splitting pass and Mehtab, who was about to shoot, was tripped inside the box by Anish Sharma. 

Skipper Dipendu converted the penalty kick. 

Bengal now camped in the Services territory but missed chances. Dipendu headed over a Dulal lob and his header struck the crosspiece following a Mehtab corner kick. 

In added time Mehtab put Nabi through but the latter was foiled by advancing Services custodian N. Abungobi Singh. 

Then in the 83rd minute, Madhab needlessly and brutally fouled Services midfielder Ramesh, about forty yards from goal. He was justifiably shown the red card.

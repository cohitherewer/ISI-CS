Lahore: Pakistan romped home to a 3-1 win over New Zealand to record their second straight win in the Champions Trophy on Sunday. 

Spain showed their big win Saturday over India was no fluke, claiming another prized scalp on Day II. The Spanish Armada rolled smoothly to a 5-2 victory over Germany. 

The hosts scored all their goals in a span of six minutes after New Zealand, coming up with yet another determined effort, had taken the lead four minutes into the second half. 

The win took Pakistan?s tally to six from two games. 

It was no cakewalk for Pakistan who were the favourites. 

After Wayne McIndoe gave New Zealand the lead in the 39th minute, Pakistan equalised through Shakeel Abbasi in the 49th minute before Sohail Abbas showed his class with two penalty corner conversions (53th and 55th) to take the match away from their rivals.

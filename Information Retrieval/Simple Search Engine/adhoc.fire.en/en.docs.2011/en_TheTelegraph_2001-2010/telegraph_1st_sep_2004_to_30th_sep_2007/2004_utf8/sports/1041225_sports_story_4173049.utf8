The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Mourinho provided a whole new dimension

 - Premier League

 - Arsenal?s year, but Chelsea emerged as a third force 

 Wenger?s team won the Premiership unbeaten without sacrificing style 

London: Arsene Wenger could never be accused of being a lucky manager. 

Having finally gained the upper hand in his long simmering duel with Manchester United?s Sir Alex Ferguson, Arsenal?s professional Frenchman might reasonably have anticipated being able to revel in the ascendancy for a little while. 

Instead, barely a month after leading FC Porto to the most unlikely of Champions League triumphs, Jose Mourinho had taken up residency on the other side of London and set about transforming Chelsea into an outfit that looks distinctly capable of preventing the Gunners from retaining the title ? an achievement that has eluded them since Wenger arrived at Highbury in 1996. 

Now, for the first time since the Premiership was launched a little over a decade ago, the English title race is a genuine three-horse affair and one that Chelsea are leading by a length. 

An intriguing 2005 beckons. But posterity will nevertheless record 2004 as Arsenal?s year. Not since the end of the 19th century had any side gone through an entire season in the English top flight unbeaten. 

The physical and psychological demands of the modern game had supposedly rendered a repeat of the achievement of Preston North End?s ?Invincibles? impossible. 

Yet Wenger?s cosmopolitan squad not only did it, they did it without sacrificing the style that has become the trademark of a club whose own fans once revelled in the capacity of their beloved ?boring, boring Arsenal? to grind out 1-0 wins with monotonous regularity. 

Such was their desire to erase the memory of their collapse in the final run-in of the previous season, few doubted the Premiership trophy was destined for Highbury. 

And the way Wenger?s men picked up where they left off at the start of the current season suggested it would be staying there. 

But the unbeaten run finally came to an end after 49 matches with a bruising 0-2 defeat by Manchester United at the end of October which concluded with Ferguson being showered with soup and pizza thrown from the Arsenal dressing-room. 

However, that victory at Old Trafford, like the FA Cup semi-final defeat of Arsenal six months earlier, represented slender consolation for United fans. 

Winning the FA Cup ensured silverware and the satisfaction of denying Arsenal the double many felt was inevitable. 

But United never seriously threatened to block the Gunners? in the Premiership and a second-round exit from the Champions League, at the hands of Mourinho?s Porto, added to the frustration. 

Despite their recent win over Arsenal, United have remained some way off the pace and Chelsea, in just three months under Mourinho, have climbed to the top ? no doubt bolstered by their manager?s self-confidence. 

 Mourinho is trying to transform Chelsea 

 into a winning unit

Mourinho, who labled himself ?the special one,? said days after arriving at Heathrow airport: ?If I wanted to have an easy job I?d have stayed at Porto. Beautiful blue chair, the Champions League trophy, god, and after god, me.? 

So, no shortage of self-belief there then. And Mourinho has continued in similar vein ever since, ensuring almost as much entertainment off the field as his team provided on it. 

Frustrated after watching Bolton relentlessly pump high balls towards Kevin Davies in a 2-2 draw in November, Mourinho demanded: ?What do you want us to do ? shoot the ball?? 

But while Mourinho has revived Chelsea, the gap between the Premiership?s elite clubs and the rest of the division has continued to widen. 

Despite Everton?s heroic start to the season, there seems little prospect of any club outside the big three claiming the title in the forseeable future. 

For teams like Newcastle and Liverpool, fourth ? and the access it provides to the riches of the Champions League ? has become the new first, while as far as the rest of the Premiership is concerned, survival is all and anything else a bonus.

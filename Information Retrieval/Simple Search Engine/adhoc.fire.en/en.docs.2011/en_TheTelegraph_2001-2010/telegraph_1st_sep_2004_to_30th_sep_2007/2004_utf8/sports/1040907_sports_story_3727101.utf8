The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Serena, Capriati set up first Open clash

 - Mauresmo inches closer to No. 1 spot; Paes-Rikl in quarters 

 Amelie Mauresmo celebrates her victory over Francesca Schiavone at Flushing Meadow on Sunday 

New York: Andy Roddick, Serena Williams and Jennifer Capriati provided a Labor Day weekend treat as they turned on the style at the US Open on Sunday. Capriati and Williams powered through their fourth round matches to set up a mouth-watering quarter final while Roddick blew away Guillermo Canas to set the pace in the mens draw. 

Two-time champion Serena, whose tennis is starting to talk as loudly as her raunchy outfits, blasted 12 aces to crush Switzerlands Patty Schnyder 6-4, 6-2 (as reported in Mondays Late city edition). 

Serena had a momentary scare early on as Schnyder, who won their previous meeting, threatened to break her opening service game. 

But from that point on it was plain sailing for the third seed who is relishing a first US Open meeting with Capriati, although the pair have met 16 times elsewhere. 

We always play each other, shes doing well and we both will to fight to get to the semis, said Serena who is yet to drop a set in the tournament despite being told by doctors to rest her suspect left knee rather than play at the Open. 

I wasnt supposed to come but I wouldnt have missed this for the world, She said. The doctors advice went in one ear and out the other. Usually the fans arent cheering for me but here its an unbelievable reception, it was really shocking to have all these people cheering for me. 

Capriati, who reeled off 10 of the last 12 games to beat 12th seed Ai Sugiyama 7-5, 6-2, was also looking forward to facing Serena, despite trailing 10-6 in head-to-heads. 

Defending champion Roddick got off to his trademark lightning start as he strong-armed his way to a 6-1, 6-3, 6-3 victory over Argentine clay-courter Guillermo Canas. 

Canas, enjoying a 13-match-winning streak, hardly got a sniff against the dominant Roddick who has lost just 18 games in nine sets here and only one in the opening sets. 

Its not a conscious thing (that I am starting so fast), I guess its the hype of the Open, said the 22-year-old, who will play Tommy Robredo for a quarter final spot. I had my game plan and took it to him. 

Equally impressive was fourth seed Lleyton Hewitt, who remains on a collision course with Roddick in the semi-final. The 2001 champion obliterated 30th seeded Spaniard Feliciano Lopez 6-1, 6-4, 6-2 in the last match of the day to book a clash with Slovakias Karol Beck one of six unseeded players to reach the last 16. 

Beck disposed of Russias Nikolay Davydenko 6-3, 4-6, 3-6, 6-1, 6-4 to reach the fourth round of a Grand Slam for the first time. Former top five player Tommy Haas launched the days play on Arthur Ashe with a straightforward 6-2, 6-3, 7-5 defeat of Brazilian qualifier Ricardo Mello, underlining his recovery from shoulder surgery that kept him out for the whole of 2003. 

Its just great to be back on the tennis court, the unseeded German said. After not playing for so long, its good to be back in the fourth round here and Im enjoying myself. 

Haas next faces 18-year-old Czech Tomas Berdych, the conqueror of Federer at the Olympics, who continued his impressive run to beat Mikhail Youzhny 2-6, 6-1, 6-3, 4-6, 6-1. 

There were defeats for all three Austrians left in the mens draw the countrys best showing here. 

Stefan Koubek lost to Swedens Joachim Johansson 7-6 (7-2), 6-7 (1-7), 1-6, 3-6, Alexander Peya was outclassed by No. 18 Robredo 6-3, 6-3, 6-2, and Frances Michael Llodra proved too strong for Jurgen Melzer, triumphing 6-3, 6-2, 7-5. 

Womens second seed Amelie Mauresmo, still searching for a first Grand Slam title, joined Capriati and Serena in the quarter finals with a classy 6-4, 6-2 stroll against Italys Francesca Schiavone. 

The French stylist could remove Justine Henin-Hardenne from the world No. 1 spot next week, but she said all her energy was focused on a first major breakthrough. 

The main thing for me is really to win a Slam, she said. The rest is going to come for example, if I win here I know Im going to be number one. 

Mauresmo faces French Open runner-up Elena Dementieva in the last eight after she recovered from a terrible start to beat an emotional Vera Zvonareva 1-6, 6-4, 6-3. 

Zvonareva looked on course for victory when she romped through the first set only to suffer an emotional meltdown, collapsing into fits of tears and smashing her racket as Dementieva won seven of the last 10 games. 

Paes-Martina in last 8 

In the mens doubles, Leander Paes and David Rikl upset top seeds Jonas Bjorkman of Sweden and Todd Woodbridge of Australia to reach the quarter finals. The Indo-Czech pair, seeded 13th, won 2-6, 7-5, 6-4 (as reported in Mondays Late city edition). 

The top seeds led 5-4 in the second set before losing three straight games. In the decider, the duo was ahead 4-1 before losing five games in a row. 

Paes also reached the mixed doubles quarter final with Martina Navratilova. 

The eight seeded pair beat Els Callens of Belgium and Martin Damm of the Czech Republic 6-3, 6-4 to set up a clash with Maria Sharapova and Max Mirnyi, who beat Cara Black and Wayne Black of Zimbabwe 6-3, 7-6 (7-4). 

Meanwhile, Mahesh Bhupathi and Lisa Raymond of the US went out of the mixed doubles losing to Woodbridge and Alicia Molik 6-7 (1-6), 6-7 (3-7) in the second round. 

In junior boys, Divij Sharan lost 4-6, 1-6 to Scoville 

Jenkins of the US in the first round. (Agencies)

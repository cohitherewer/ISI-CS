 Tough call for Indian men

Mallorca: It is going to be a tough call for Indian men when they take on second seeds Ukraine in the seventh round of the 36th chess Olympiad at Gran Casino here. 

The big test for India awaits in this all-important encounter and Viswanathan Anand will again be leading the Indian challenge against Ukrainian top board Vassily Ivanchuk. 

The Indian thinktank has decided to rest Surya Sekhar Ganguly and Sandipan Chanda and brought back P. Harikrishna who did not play in the team?s victory over the Netherlands before the rest day on Thursday. 

With Anand on top board, Sasikiran will have to tackle Ruslan Ponomariov with black and Harikrishna will have white against Pavel Eljanov. On fourth board, Abhijit Kunte has to face Sergei Karjakin. 

In women?s section, the Indian eves take on third seeds United States in the seventh round. The Indian prospects suffered a setback when GM Koneru Humpy lost her sixth round game and the Indian girls could only manage a 1.5-1.5 score against a depleted Hungary but with 8 more rounds still remaining, not much is lost for them as they still share the third spot on 12 points.

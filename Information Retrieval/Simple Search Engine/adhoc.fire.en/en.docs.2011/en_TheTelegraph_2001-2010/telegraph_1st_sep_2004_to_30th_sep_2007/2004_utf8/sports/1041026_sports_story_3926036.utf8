The Telegraph - Calcutta

 ?Another love interest a gross lie?

 Clijsters hits out at media over split with Hewitt 

Brussels: Former world No. 1 Kim Clijsters on Monday criticised the media attention surrounding her split with Lleyton Hewitt. She also denied rumours that another love interest was behind the break-up, only four months ahead of their planned wedding. 

Clijsters announced the separation from her fiancee last week and after initial shock, media have been searching to find out what was behind the sudden decision. 

?What is the world coming to when journalists camp in front of my house and follow the rest of my family? When there are people who claim to know that Lleyton or I already have someone else, which is a gross lie,? she wrote in her web diary on www.Kimclijsters.Com. 

Clijsters announced on Friday on her website that the planned February wedding had been called off and that the pair had split up. 

The Sunday Telegraph in Sydney reported Hewitt had been left ?angry, embarrassed and devastated.? 

Clijsters added she hoped the media attention would stop immediately. 

?Why are all these presumptions elevated to national news,? she said. ?I hope everyone will show a bit of respect and understanding for myself and the family.? 

The couple was to marry next February in Australia and organise a major celebration in an ornate castle for friends and family afterwards. 

Clijsters has been injured for most of the season while Hewitt, also a former No. 1, surged late in the year, reaching the final of the US Open last month, when he lost to Roger Federer. 

Hewitt and Clijsters got engaged last year.

 Lonard falls one short

Sydney: Australian golfer Peter Lonard has been told he cannot win this year?s Australasian Order of Merit, earning himself an automatic place in next year?s US and British Opens, despite leading the series heading into the final event of the season. 

Lonard has a big lead in the Order Of Merit after winning the New South Wales Open, Australian Open and Australian PGA in the last three we-eks. But officials told him on Tuesday that he was ineligible to win the title because he had not played enough events, falling one short. (REUTERS)

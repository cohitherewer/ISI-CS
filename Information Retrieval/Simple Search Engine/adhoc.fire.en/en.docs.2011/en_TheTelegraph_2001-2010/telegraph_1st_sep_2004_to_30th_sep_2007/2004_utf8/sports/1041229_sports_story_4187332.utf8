 Prasad closer to title

Bikaner: Former national sub-junior champion S. Arun Prasad played it safe against junior champion G. N. Gopal and quickly drew his ninth round match in the 27th Asian Junior chess championship now in progress. 

Despite the draw, Prasad maintained a full point lead over nearest rivals as former champion International Master Deepan Chakravarthy did not succeed in bridging the gap after Samakov Nurdin of Kyrgyzstan held him to a draw. 

With just two rounds remaining Prasad looks all set to win the crown. The Tamil Nadu youngster is sole leader with seven points followed by Chakravarthy, Gopal and Arghyadip Das, who caused a major stir beating top seeded IM Anton Filippov of Uzbekistan. 

On 5.5 points are IM M. R. Venkatesh, Abhijeet Gupta, IM S. Poobesh Anand, G. Rohit, T. U. Navin Kanna, Akshyaraj Kore and Nurdin. The hosts are looking forward to another landslide performance here and currently top eight slots are occupied by Indians. 

In the girls section, it is another story as Hoang Thi Bao Tram of Vietnam regained sole lead with a hard earned victory over defending champion Y. Pratibha. 

WGM and India?s best hope D. Harika fell back in the race for championship as she was held to a draw by Mary Ann Gomes in a game of fluctuating fortunes. 

With Tram jumping to eight points and Harika on 7.5, Soumya Swaminathan (7) made most of her opportunities and strengthened her third position after scoring over Bahar Hallaeva of Uzbekistan.

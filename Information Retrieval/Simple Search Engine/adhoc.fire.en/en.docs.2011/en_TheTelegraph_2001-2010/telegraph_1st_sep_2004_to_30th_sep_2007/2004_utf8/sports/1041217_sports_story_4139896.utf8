 Ritwik, Saurav in maiden final 

Chennai: India?s Ritwik Bhattacharya and Saurav Ghosal created history by making the final of the world doubles squash championships for the first time. 

The pair stormed into the title clash defeating American duo Jaime Crombie and Preston Quick 3-1 in the semi-finals on Thursday 9-5, 10-11, 11-9, 9-4. 

Initially, the Indians were heading for an easy win after they took the first game 9-5. But the US pair came back strongly in the second. Down 2-5, they levelled the score at 8-8 and then took 11-10. 

In the third game with Bhattacharya serving for the game at 8-7, the rivals went on to play one of the longest rallies witnessed in the match. Ghosal then muffed up an easy return from the backcourt to help the Americans not only to save a game point, but allowed them to level the score as well. 

The US pair raised their game and Crombie came up with some superb winners. 

Once again Bhattacharya served for the game, but Ghosal erred badly. With the score at 10-9, Ghosal served and a series of rallies followed. Ghosal drove in powerfully with his low backhand and the ball returned between Bhattacharya and Quick. The American misjudged and the Indian managed to win the third game. 

In the fourth game, the US pair was no match for the Indians as the latter won it 9-4 to clinch the match. 

In the final, Bhattacharya and Ghosal will take on the winner of the David Palmer and Anthony Ricketts (Australia) versus Byron Davis and Cameron White (Australia) match. (PTI)

 Fire damages Wanderers clubhouse

Durban: The clubhouse of the historic Wanderers cricket ground in Johannesburg was extensively damaged by a raging fire on Wednesday night. 

The fire reportedly started in the kitchen after a gas explosion. It took more than 35 firemen, with over 11 fire engines, to douse it throughout the night, Johannesburg emergency services spokesperson Steven Kirk said. 

?There has been extensive damage to the clubhouse. Only the main hall seems to have been saved,? he said. 

The offices of the United Cricket Board of South Africa, which is housed in the back of the clubhouse, was not affected. 

The clubhouse was established in the 1880s and was moved to its present site in the 1930s. 

The complex boasts of magnificent stadium, gymnasium, tennis courts and an 18-hole golf course. It has been a meeting place for the ?high and mighty? of Johannesburg for decades.

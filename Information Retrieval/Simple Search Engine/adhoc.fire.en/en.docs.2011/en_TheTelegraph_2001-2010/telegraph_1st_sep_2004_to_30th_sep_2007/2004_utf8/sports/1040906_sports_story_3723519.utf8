 Batting still a worry: Sourav

 - Bowlers were outstanding 

London: Indian skipper Sourav Ganguly on Sunday said the team did a great job in winning the final NatWest Challenge one-day International but was still far away from its best. 

We are a good one-day side and we know that we have the ability (to win). But we are still far from what we are capable off, Sourav said after India beat England by 23 runs here to end their poor run of form. 

The Team India captain, who also won the Man of the Match award for his gutsy 90, said the result would provide a much-needed boost to their confidence going into the ICC Champions Trophy. 

Sourav understandably gave a lot of credit to his bowlers for the victory but still sported a big crease on his forehead when talking about his batsmen. Our bowlers were outstanding, especially in the first 10 overs, said Sourav. But batsmen still are a long way from running into good form. 

We are not batting well and it is fair to say I didnt back ourselves when we came into the middle but the bowlers were outstanding. 

Sourav said he had pushed Sehwag down the order because of his constant failures and moved Laxman up the order because of latters past experience. 

England captain Michael Vaughan was also upbeat about his teams performance in the Champions Trophy saying they could beat any team in the world if they played the way they did in the current series. Vaughan said he was proud of the way the team played in the 2-1 series win over the Indians. 

Man-of-the-Series Steve Harmison said, in beating India, we have come out and proved to people that we are a good one-day side. (PTI)

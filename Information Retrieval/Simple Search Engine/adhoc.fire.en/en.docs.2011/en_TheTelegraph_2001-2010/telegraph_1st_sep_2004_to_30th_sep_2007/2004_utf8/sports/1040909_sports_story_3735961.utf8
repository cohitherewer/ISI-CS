 This could be a new beginning 

 - Time for Tiger Woods? peers to shrug off second-class tags 

 LEWINE MAIR 

 Tiger?s time for a new hunt 

There will be plenty to suggest that the loss of his status as world No. 1 proves what they have been saying for months ? Tiger Woods? best days are over. 

Woods no longer holds any of the major championships and Vijai Singh replaced him as No. 1 after a record span of 264 weeks when the Fijian finished first to Woods? share of second place in the Deutsche Bank Championship in Boston Monday. 

Yet, while many will see this as confirmation of Woods? decline, others will sense that this could be a turning point in the player?s career. Not since 1996, when he turned professional with nothing to lose and everything to gain ? and promptly won the 1997 US Masters by a record 12 shots ? will he have felt so unencumbered. And if, on a somewhat sadder note, he and his fianc?e, Elin Nordegren, are in the process of splitting up, that too could add to his feelings of new beginnings. 

No less pertinent is what the news of Woods? changed circumstances will do for his peers. Though they acknowledge what this winner of eight majors has done for the game, and for their finances, they never enjoyed his times of out-and-out supremacy. They felt second-rate, with some embarrassingly over-anxious that Woods should pay for his rare misdemeanours. 

A couple of years ago, when players on the European Tour were hoping to see Nick Faldo in trouble for his painfully slow pace of play, John Paramor, the European Tour?s head referee, revealed that the same applied to Woods in the States. His fellow competitors were forever putting their heads round the referee?s door and asking if Woods was going to be fined for, say, his spot of swearing in the 2000 US Open at Pebble Beach. 

True, the players gave Woods their vote as Player of the Year when it should really have gone to Singh last year, but that was more because they found it less painful to give it to Woods than to the Fijian. 

Their complaints about the latter, apart from the fact that he had been working harder and playing more solid golf than they had, included his comments about hoping that Annika Sorenstam would miss the cut in last year?s Colonial tournament. 

Woods seemed to have started to take stock long before Singh went ahead of him in the world order. 

When he was winning his Tiger Slam of all four majors in 2000 and 2001, he would hit the odd drive flat out, but only when he needed to. In 2003 and early 2004, he started resorting to irons and three-woods off the tee, but recently he decided he and his driver should work their way through the problems together. He is back hitting harder, and far from hitting further into trouble he has been catching more fairways. 

In his past 10 starts, Woods has had eight top-10 finishes, six of which have been top-fives. That is a great set of results by any standards, though as Woods said: ?You don?t get to No. 1 by finishing in the top 10. You have to win.? 

Woods, who surpassed Greg Norman?s long stint at the top of the rankings during the recent US PGA Championship at Whistling Straits, has been typically gracious in defeat. He feels that Singh deserves to be where he is. 

Singh, however, had better enjoy his position at No. 1 while he can. Toppling Woods is one thing, but having him at your heels could be a whole lot more taxing.

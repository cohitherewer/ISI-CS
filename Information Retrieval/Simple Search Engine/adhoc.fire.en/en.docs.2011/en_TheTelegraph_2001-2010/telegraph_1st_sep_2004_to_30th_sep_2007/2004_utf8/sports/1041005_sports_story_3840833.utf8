 Hyderabad: India?s Sania Mirza sailed into the women?s singles second round with a 6-1 6-2 win over Nikoian Ludmila of Armenia on the opening day of the $25,000 ITF Circuit meet being played in Nigeria.

 The 17-year-old played a fast paced game and forced her way to a thumping win in the first set after dropping just one game, according to information received here on Monday.

 The Armenian put up some resistance in the second set by winning two games but again found her rival a hard nut to crack as the Indian outplayed her.

 Coimbatore: Tata RC motorsport driver, Narain Karthikeyan, emerged from the two Barcelona races with two top five finishes in the world series by Nissan, racking up two valuable point hauls in the seventh round of the championship, according to a report from Catalunya.

 In the first race Narain was just about beaten by Renault Development drivers Heikki Kovalainen and Adrian Valles, the report said. French Le Mans racer Tristan Gommendy finished a mere fraction of a second ahead of Narain in third.

 The shorter race provided a fifth place, though again it was almost too close to call with less than five seconds separating the top five at the finish line.

 Dhaka: The first-ever women?s football tournament in mainly Muslim Bangladesh kicked off on Monday after organisers managed to pacify hardline Islamic groups initially opposed to the idea, an official said.

 ?We are starting our first-ever women?s football with the participation of eight local teams from today, although there were some (protests) from Islamic groups earlier,? Bangladesh Football Federation President S.A. Sultan said.

 ?The federation officials had some meetings with Islamic groups to explain the need for such an event and now they are pacified. Other Muslim countries like Pakistan and Qatar have also organised such tournaments,? Sultan said.

 Madrid: Barcelona?s Brazil defender Edmilson will be sidelined for at least six months after undergoing knee surgery on Monday, club doctors said. The Brazilian had damaged the front ligament of his right knee, and suffered a dislocation and breakage of the internal meniscus in the 1-0 weekend win over Numancia. Edmilson was on the operating table for over two hours, and will spend three days in hospital before heading home. A second-half substitute on Sunday, he was injured after just three minutes on the pitch, falling badly following a challenge for a header.

 London: Chelsea striker Didier Drogba could be out of action for four weeks with a groin injury, according to his club manager Jose Mourinho.

 Drogba already misses Ivory Coast?s World Cup qualifier against Benin on Sunday and Mourinho said on Chelsea?s official website on Monday that : ?He has a muscular injury which could take two, three or four weeks? recovery.?

 Drogba was substituted during second-placed Chelsea?s 1-0 home win over Liverpool on Sunday.

 Paris: Juventus striker David Trezeguet is set to miss France?s World Cup qualifiers against Ireland on Saturday and Cyprus next week because of a lingering shoulder injury.

 ?I?m afraid it?s over for both games, unfortunately,? said Trezeguet, who was replaced at half-time by Juventus in their 1-0 Serie A victory at Udinese on Sunday. He said he had dislocated his left shoulder six times in recent months and was considering surgery.

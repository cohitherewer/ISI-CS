 Benaud pays ultimate tribute

Melbourne: Australia captain Ricky Ponting and former skippers Richie Benaud, Bill Lawry, Ian Chappell and Steve Waugh were among mourners at the funeral of one of Australia?s favourite cricketers Keith Miller. 

?Miller?s name will live as long as cricket exists,? Benaud told the 1000 mourners at Melbourne?s St Paul?s cathedral on Wednesday. A former World War II bomber pilot who survived a crash landing, the Melbourne-born Miller went on to play in Don Bradman?s 1948 Ashes-winning ?Invincibles.? 

Tall and handsome, Miller took 170 wickets and scored 2,958 runs in 55 Tests. The Australian helped rejuvenate Test cricket after World War II before eventually retiring in 1956. ?He was a cricketer every boy wanted to be like,? local television personality Tony Charlton said in the main eulogy. 

John Bradman, son of Don, told mourners Miller was a close and special family friend. 

?He was wonderfully supportive when my dad died (in 2001),? said John Bradman. ?My dad said Keith was Australia?s greatest allround cricketer. My father told me that he never had a more loyal supporter than Keith Miller.?

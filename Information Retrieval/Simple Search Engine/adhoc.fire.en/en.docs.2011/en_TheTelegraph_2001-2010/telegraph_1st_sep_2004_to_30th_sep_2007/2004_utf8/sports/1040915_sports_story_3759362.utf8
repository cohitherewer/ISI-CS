Southampton: Greg Chappell isn?t yet quite the Elder Statesman of cricket, but his views carry punch and are respected. An outstanding batsman and a captain who sought to make a difference, Greg spoke to The Telegraph exclusively about the forthcoming India-Australia series. 

The following are excerpts 

Q Today, how do you expect the four Tests to 

go? 

A Should be exciting and I?m looking forward to them. 

In fact, more than anybody else, the players themselves must be looking forward 

to the contest... After all, at this moment, an India versus Australia face-off 

is the premier one in world cricket... India won the last series at home 

(2000-01) and had the upperhand in Australia last season... Australia, then, will 

be seeking to reverse that. 

You?ve placed the Border-Gavaskar Trophy a notch 

higher than even the Ashes... 

Well, purely in terms of the recent face-offs between 

the teams and current expectations. 

How can Australia reverse the trend, as you 

put it? 

By giving more thought to the challenge and preparing 

better... It?s a definite plus that both Glenn (McGrath) and (Shane) Warne are 

available and have been picked... Without them, Australia struggled to bowl India 

out twice last summer... 

Is Brett Lee going to be the trump card? 

He will be a factor and I think Ricky Ponting is going 

to use him in short bursts, particularly against the new batsmen. 

What are the lessons the Indians need to keep 

in mind from the last (drawn) series? 

To win, they have to play positively... They shouldn?t 

just soak the pressure, but put it back on Australia ? something done in Adelaide 

with dramatic results. Bottomline is India must be positive even while withstanding 

pressure. 

Of course, Ponting wasn?t the captain then, 

but is there something he ought to remember? 

The Australians don?t need to do anything too differently... 

I don?t think we played badly at home, only the Indians played very well. But, 

yes, Ponting and (coach) John Buchanan have to be clear about the line of attack 

for each frontline batsman... (After a pause) Lee, as I?ve said, will be 

an important part of the strategy. 

After the visit to Australia, India went to 

Pakistan while Australia toured Sri Lanka... 

(Interrupting) But neither side has played 

much Test cricket since Sydney... 

Is there a worry there?s going to be a one-day 

hangover? 

I do realise the first Test (in Bangalore) is just 

ten days after the Champions Trophy final, but both teams have experienced players 

who are professional enough to change gear. Still, the side which adjusts quicker 

will have the early advantage. 

Unfortunately, the question mark over Sachin 

Tendulkar?s fitness remains... 

I hope he?s available... India needs him, the series 

needs him... 

The selectors have picked three specialist 

spinners (Warne, Nathan Hauritz and Cameron White), but overlooked Stuart MacGill. 

Was that on the cards? 

My understanding is that with Warne fit, they don?t 

need another leggie in the XI... Moreover, when MacGill plays, the batting becomes 

somewhat unbalanced. 

Warne, however, hasn?t had it too good in India... 

Indeed, he has struggled and, if there?s a gap in 

his list of achievements, it?s that he hasn?t made a big impression in India.... 

I reckon he?s going to set that right. 

If Warne wasn?t available for the last series, 

India missed Harbhajan Singh in three of the four Tests. How do you rate him? 

Oh, he?s a quality spinner and the Australians are 

aware how big a factor (32 wickets in three Tests) he was in the last series in 

India... 

There?s likely to be a debate over Akash Chopra 

opening. What are your views? 

I favour specialists and specialists prove their worth. 

So, where will you put your money? 

(Laughs) It?s going to be a fifty-fitty contest... 

Better focus and a better game plan will make the difference. 

Who is the one Australian who may have the 

biggest influence? 

Probably Ponting... We haven?t seen the best of him 

and the near future could see that... He?s enjoying the captaincy, is comfortable 

with life... Actually, for Ponting, everything appears to be rosy... 

And, the one Indian? 

Sourav Ganguly, perhaps... Or, a combination of (Rahul) 

Dravid, Sourav and (V.V.S.) Laxman... Even Sachin, if he?s fit... (Again, after 

a pause) I can?t also rule out your spinners making the biggest impact. 

How should Sourav handle the enormous pressure? 

By being positive with his approach as a batsman, 

by being positive with his captaincy. I believe he allowed things to drift a bit 

in the Sydney Test by being conservative but, otherwise, stood up to the pressure 

exceedingly well. He must back his bowlers with aggressive field placements and, 

generally, pull out all the stops. My own opinion is that we haven?t yet seen 

the best of Sourav as captain. 

The last question: Do you still regret not 

having toured India? 

I do, yes... It?s a gap in my CV which can?t be filled... 

I?ve got to live with it.

 Safin eyes Federer crown

 Safin will get insider help from Federer?s ex-coach Lundgren 

Beijing: A resurgent Marat Safin could emerge as the best bet to challenge Roger Federer?s stranglehold on men?s tennis ? with a little insider help. 

The Russian giant won his first tournament in almost two years with a battling 7-6, 7-5 victory over compatriot Mikhail Youzhny in the China Open final at the weekend. 

Safin, who briefly topped the world rankings after capturing the 2000 US Open, paid tribute to his Swedish coach Peter Lundgren after breaking a 22-month title drought in Beijing. 

Lundgren guided world No. 1 Federer to his first Grand Slam title at Wimbledon last year before they parted company in December. He has been working with Safin since April. 

?This is my first title with Peter, hopefully it won?t be our last together,? said a tearful Safin. ?It?s not party time because I won.? 

While his talent has never been in question, Safin?s work ethic has been called into doubt before. 

The tempestuous Russian escaped a fine despite saying he gave up during his first-round defeat at this year?s Wimbledon. 

Safin created an unwanted slice of history at the 2000 Australian Open, when he became the first player to be fined for tanking, or not trying, at a Grand Slam tournament. 

The 24-year-old, known as ?Big Red? for his booming serves and imposing presence, insisted he was prepared to knuckle down and keep his famous temper in check under Lundgren. 

?I know it doesn?t help me at all to get crazy with myself on the court,? said Safin. ?In the past sometimes I did that, threw my racket or whatever. It?s no good.? 

Lundgren also coached former world No. 1 Marcelo Rios, another player with a fiery temperament. 

?Lundgren worked with Rios,? joked Safin. ?If he can deal with Rios, then he can understand me.? 

Safin, who slid out of the top-50 last year after an injury-plagued season, played with a steely determination in China. Not one racket was smashed in anger. 

He did not drop a set in Beijing and fought fire with fire in a pulsating final against fellow-Muscovite Youzhny. 

His hunger back, Safin edged above Andre Agassi into eighth spot in the ATP Champions Race after claiming his 12th title. 

For now, Safin has set his sights on being one of the eight players to qualify for the season-ending Tennis Masters Cup in Houston. But he warned that he could be ready to launch a real challenge to Federer in 2005. 

?This year, Federer is playing incredible,? said Safin, who was beaten by the all-conquering Swiss in the Australian Open final at the start of the year. 

?But next year, who knows? He has to keep this level and a lot of players want to beat him and be number one. Maybe me too.? 

Certainly, nobody ? not Safin, Agassi or Andy Roddick ? could stop Federer in 2004 as he became the first man to win three Grand Slam titles in a year since Swede Mats Wilander in 1988. 

With his confidence restored and his power clearly undiminished, Safin could be a serious threat to Federer next year. ?It feels great to be back,? said Safin. ?You forget the feeling (of winning). But I have the motivation now to work hard. I want to try to work hard and keep this feeling.?

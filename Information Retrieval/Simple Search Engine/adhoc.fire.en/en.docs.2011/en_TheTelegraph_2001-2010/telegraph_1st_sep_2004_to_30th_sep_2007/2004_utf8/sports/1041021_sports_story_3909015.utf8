 Gopichand to make comeback

 Gopichand 

Hyderabad: Former All England champion Pulella Gopichand, staging a comeback after a long injury lay-off, would be the star attraction at the eight-nation Asian Satellite Badminton tournament beginning here from October 25. 

The local hero has been out of action for over eight months due to a knee injury, and his return to the court will surely raise India?s hopes of landing a title in the men?s section. 

But in the women?s section, holder Aparna Popat would not be there to defend the title she won in Jaipur last year, as she has opted out due to personal reasons. Olympian and currently the top ranked Indian in the world, Nikhil Kanetkar, is the other absentee as the left-hander is playing for a club in German league. 

National champion Chetan Anand, Mauritius Open winner Abhinn Shyam Gupta, Trupti Murgunde and Manjusha Kanwar are the other top Indian contenders in the fray. 

About 100 shuttlers from Indonesia, Thailand, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Iran, Bangladesh and Nepal besides hosts India will be taking part in this grade A tournament with the winner acquiring 180 ranking points, runner up 150, semi-finalists 120 and quarter finalists 90 points, Andhra Pradesh badminton association president Durga Prasad said on Wednesday. 

Competition will be held in men?s and women?s singles and doubles as the organisers have done away with the mixed doubles event. 

THE SQUADS 

Men: Pulella Gopichand, B. Chetan Anand, Abhin Shyam Gupta, Utsav Mishra, Thomas Kurien, Anup Sridhar, J.B.S. Vidyadhar, Hemant Duggal, Sachin Ratti, Jaseel P. Ismail, V. Diju, Sanave Thomas, Rupesh Kumar, A. Pridvi, Marcos Bristow and Jaison Xavier.

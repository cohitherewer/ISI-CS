London: Champions Arsenal dropped their first points of the season when a late Henrik Pedersen equaliser earned Bolton Wanderers a 2-2 draw at Highbury on Saturday. The Danish substitute sent the ball home after 85 minutes to deny Arsene Wenger?s team their sixth win in six Premier League games. 

Arsenal, who nonetheless extended their unbeaten record to 46 league matches, led through a first-half effort by Thierry Henry. Tunisian defender Radhi Jaidi levelled with a header on the hour but Robert Pires quickly put Arsenal back in front. 

The draw meant Arsenal have 16 points, three clear of second-placed Chelsea who will take on Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday. Bolton are third with 11 points. 

Only two fine interceptions by Jaidi prevented the visitors falling behind before Henry ruthlessly dispatched his fifth league goal of the season in the 31st minute. 

Displaying instant control, the Frenchman exchanged passes with Patrick Vieira and his angled, left-footed finish rendered Bolton keeper Jussi Jaaskelainen a spectator.

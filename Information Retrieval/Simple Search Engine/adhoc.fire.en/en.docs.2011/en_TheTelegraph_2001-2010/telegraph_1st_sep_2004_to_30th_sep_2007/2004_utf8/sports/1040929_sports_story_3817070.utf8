 Trescothick, Flintoff left out

London: England have left out Marcus Trescothick and Andrew Flintoff from their squad for the tour of Zimbabwe. The pair will join Steve Harmison on the sidelines after the pace bowler asked not to be considered for the five-match one-day series starting in November before England move off to South Africa. 

Several of England players have expressed reservations about playing in Zimbabwe, including Andrew Strauss, although he has been picked. 

South African-born Kevin Pietersen, however, was included for the first time. The attacking right-handed batsman from Natal, has just become eligible for England after moving to Nottinghamshire in 2001. 

Meanwhile, England Cricket Board (ECB) chairman David Morgan said on Tuesday that England cricketers will not attend any state functions during their tour of Zimbabwe. ?I would like to re-emphasise that the team will not be involved in state functions during this tour,? Morgan said.

 EB decision after talking to players

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: East Bengal maintained on Tuesday that a decision about Sasthi Duley and Dipankar Roy, the duo who were arrested on charges of giving shelter to hatkata Dilip, after talking to the players. 

?We hope nobody is harassed unnecessarily and the actual guilty gets punished. We have had the relations with them (Sasthi and Dipankar) as players and they haven?t done anything on the field that calls for punishment. Still we believe law will take its own course,? club secretary Kalyan Majumdar told reporters after a lengthy meeting with officials on Tuesday. 

?We haven?t had chances to talk with the players extensively about their role in the incident. Once it is done, we?ll arrive at a decision,? he added. 

Coach Subhas Bhowmick, who was also present during the meeting, later admitted the team?s performance in the Durand Cup might be affected by the duo?s arrest. 

Meanwhile, East Bengal have released Suley Musah and the Ghanaian is set to join Tollygunge Agragami.

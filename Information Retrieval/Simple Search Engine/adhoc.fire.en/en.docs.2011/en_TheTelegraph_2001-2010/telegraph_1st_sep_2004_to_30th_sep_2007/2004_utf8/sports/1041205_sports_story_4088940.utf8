The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Surya earns neat victory

Visakhapatnam: Defending champion and top seed Surya Shekhar Ganguly of PSPB stole the opening day honours at the 42nd national A chess championship (that began a day late) Saturday at Waltair Club here. 

Surya earned a neat victory over WGM D. Harika. The last game to end in the day witnessed a Reti opening by the Andhra girl and Surya had a balanced middle game on board after the initial moves. Surya?s experience and excellent calculation enabled him to net a pawn complicated middle game and that was enough for him to romp home in 61 moves. 

GM Abhijit Kunte, however, survived a real scare before signing peace with teammate IM M. R. Venkatesh. 

While this one by relatively older-horse Surya lasted quite long after starting in the afternoon, the shortest game was played between A debutantes ? IM Deepan Chakravarthy of Tamil Nadu and Abhijit Gupta of Rajasthan. 

The only other decisive battle of the day was fought between Calcutta?s Roktim Bandyopadhyay and Indian Airlines? Rahul Shetty who only had himself to blame after an inexplicable blunder. Earlier, the two had fought a level battle in the King?s Indian defence where the former played white. 

GM Dibyendu Barua failed to convert a better middle game and endgame against his state mate Suvrajit Saha and had to settle for a draw .

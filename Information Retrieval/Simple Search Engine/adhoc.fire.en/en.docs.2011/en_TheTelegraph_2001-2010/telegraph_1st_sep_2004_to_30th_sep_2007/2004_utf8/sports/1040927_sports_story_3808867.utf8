 Berlin: Felix Limo extended Kenya?s dominance of the Berlin Marathon by winning the race in miserable weather conditions on Sunday. Limo gave Kenya their sixth successive victory in the event by covering the 42.195-km course across the German capital in two hours six minutes 44 seconds. Fellow Kenyan Joseph Riri came a close second in 2:06:49 and Joshua Chelanga completed a clean sweep for Kenya by taking third place in 2:07:05. Rain and wind prevented Limo from getting close to the world-record time of 2:04:55 set by his compatriot Paul Tergat in Berlin last year.

 Yoko Shibui gave Japan their fifth victory in succession in the women?s race in a course record 2:19:41. Hiromi Ominami, also of Japan, took second place in 2:23.26 while local favourite Sonja Oberem finished a distant third in 2:26.53.

 Sydney: Australia?s Jade Edmistone set a short-course world record of 29.90 seconds for the women?s 50 metres breaststroke at the Australian championships in Brisbane on Sunday.

 Edmistone shaved 0.06 off the previous best achieved by Sweden?s Emma Igelstrom at the 2002 world championships. Edmistone, 22, equalled Igelstrom?s world record in the semi-finals on Saturday, but was able to find another six-hundredths of a second in Sunday?s final to establish a new mark. 

 London: Gymnastics officials are planning ?drastic and fundamental changes? in judging methods in a bid to repair the damage from a controversy which marred the Athens Olympics. Measures include redrafting the sport?s code of points and banning judges who make mistakes for up to four years. International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) president Bruno Grandi told a special session of the body?s executive commission that he intended ?to bring drastic and fundamental changes in the way judging is carried out.?

 London: Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes says he is sticking by his decision to retire from international football, despite England manager Sven-Goran Eriksson?s attempt to change his mind. Scholes, 29, turned his back on England after Euro 2004 having amassed 66 caps, scoring 14 goals.

 ?I have no regrets about my decision to quit England ? none whatsoever,? Scholes told British newspapers on Sunday. 

 ?Sven-Goran Eriksson has said the door would always be open if I wanted to come back, and I am grateful to him for that, but I am not sure I will be taking up his offer.?

 When he announced his international retirement last month, Scholes said he planned to spend more time with his family and to prolong his club career. However, he now concedes that negative press coverage may have had a part in his decision.

 Memphis: Jamaican-born Glen Johnson knocked out American Roy Jones Junior in the ninth round here to retain the International Boxing Federation light heavyweight title.

 Johnson, who won the vacant title in February with a victory over Clinton Woods in Sheffield was leading on all three judges? cards when, at 48 seconds of the ninth, he nailed Jones with a right cross to the head, and followed up with a left hook to the shoulder as Jones was already crashing to the canvas.

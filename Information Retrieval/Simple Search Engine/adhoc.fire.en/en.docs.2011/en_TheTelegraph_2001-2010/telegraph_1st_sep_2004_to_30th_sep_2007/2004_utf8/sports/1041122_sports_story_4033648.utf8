Houston: World No. 1 Roger Federer will try to deny Lleyton Hewitt his third Masters Cup crown in Sunday?s final. 

Defending champion Federer won an epic tiebreak 20-18 to seal a 6-3, 7-6 semi-final victory over Russian Marat Safin on Saturday and take his unbeaten run to 16 matches. Earlier, Hewitt defused the hard-hitting American Andy Roddick 6-3, 6-2. 

Sunday?s showdown will give Hewitt an opportunity to take over as world number two and a last chance of scoring his first victory of the year over his Swiss rival. 

Federer has beaten the Australian in all five of their meetings this season, including a straight-sets demolition in the US Open final. ?The last few times things have been going my way,? Federer told reporters. ?I hope I can play at that level tomorrow. 

?But I am already quite happy. I was not quite sure how it was going to go this week because of my (thigh) injury and because I hadn?t played for a long time.? 

Safin might have hoped to have the edge on Federer, who is playing for the first time in almost a month after straining his left thigh. The 23-year-old Swiss, though, has returned to the sublime form that carried him to three Grand Slam titles this season. 

Federer?s competitive edge shone through in a gripping 26-minute tiebreak and he secured victory on his eighth match point when Safin, who had held six set points of his own, sent a return long. 

The tiebreak equalled the longest in singles history, matching those played by Bjorn Borg and Premjit Lall at Wimbledon in 1973 and by Goran Ivanisevic and Daniel Nestor at the 1993 US Open. 

?That tiebreak was very special,? said Federer. ?I?ve never played a tiebreak like that, not even in practice. That was really fun because it went back and forth.... the level of play was very high.? 

The first semi-final pitted the sport?s heaviest hitter against its consummate counter puncher. 

But back to his feisty, fist-pumping best, Hewitt took the best shots the big-serving American could offer as he swept the last five games and 20 consecutive points to dispose of the Texan in 58 minutes. 

Roddick, who earlier in the tournament became only the third player to serve more than 1,000 aces in a season, fired seven aces past Hewitt in the opening set. Hewitt, the Masters champion of 2001 and 2002, refused to be intimidated . 

The first opening came at 3-3 when the Australian?s pinpoint lob earned him a break of serve. The home crowd rallied round their fellow Texan in the second set, but Roddick never came close to matching the intensity of his inspired opponent. 

?As soon as the bell rang I was ready to play my best tennis,? said Hewitt, who committed only six unforced errors. ?I felt I was on his serve right from the start.?

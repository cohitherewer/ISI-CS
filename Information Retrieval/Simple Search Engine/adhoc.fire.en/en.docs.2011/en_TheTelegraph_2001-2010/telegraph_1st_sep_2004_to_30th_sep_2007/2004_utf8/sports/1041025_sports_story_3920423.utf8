 Budapest: Hungarian hammer thrower Adrian Annus, who was stripped of his Olympic title for a doping offence, has finally relinquished his gold medal.

 The Hungarian news agency MTI said Annus had handed his medal to national Olympic committee head Pal Schmitt who will, on Monday, take it in person to the International Olympic Committee (IOC).

 Annus had vowed to hang on to his medal but changed his mind when the IOC said it would suspend Hungary?s Olympic membership and withdrew its financial support.

 The IOC banned Annus for two years after analysis of the two urine samples he provided in Athens showed evidence of belonging to two different athletes. His teammate Robert Fazekas was also suspended after winning the hammer title for failing to provide a complete urine sample. 

 Rabat: Double Olympic champion Hicham el Guerrouj, the greatest middle distance runner of his generation, plans to retire in 2006 after trying to break the 5,000m world record next year.

 The 30-year-old Moroccan, who won both the 1,500- and 5,000m gold medals at the Athens Olympics in August, already holds the 1,500m, mile and 2,000m world records.

 El Guerruoj said 2006 would be ?the year of farewell? at a ceremony on Friday in Oviedo, northern Spain, where he received the 2004 Principe de Asturias prize, Spain?s top international sporting honour. 

 New Delhi: India lost to Hong Kong in their first match of the play-offs for the 9th-12th positions at the world junior team badminton championship in Richmond, Canada.

Slovenia were blanked by Russia 0-3 in their first match to finish within the top ten.

 Durban: A donation from a Dubai-based cricket fan will boost the development of the game among the disadvantaged in South Africa. The United Cricket Board of South Africa said it had received $10,000 from businessman Shyam Bhatia.

 Richie Ryall, a former domestic South African player, handed over the cheque to UCBSA chief executive Gerald Majola on behalf of Bhatia.

 Osnabruck: The presidency of the German soccer federation will be split between two men for the first time in the organisation?s 104-year history to avoid a power struggle heading into the 2006 World Cup.

 Theo Zwanziger, backed by the country?s amateur teams, was given a share of the office with incumbent Gerhard Mayer-Vorfelder, a Fifa executive committee member and largely seen as the voice of the professional Bundesliga.

 The general assembly of the six-million member federation approved the power-sharing agreement, which is to last until 2006, 249-4. 

 Sao Paulo: Ayrton Senna?s nephew Bruno drove the late world champion?s 1986 Lotus around his home circuit on Sunday to mark the 10th anniversary of the Brazilian?s death at Imola in 1994.

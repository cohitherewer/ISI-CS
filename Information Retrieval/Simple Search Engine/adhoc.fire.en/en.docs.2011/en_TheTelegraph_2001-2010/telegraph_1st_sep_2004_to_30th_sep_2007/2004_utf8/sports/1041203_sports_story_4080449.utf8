Nadal to take on Roddick

Seville: Teenager Rafael Nadal will shoulder Spain?s Davis Cup hopes against the world?s fastest server Andy Roddick on Friday after the hosts plumped for the 18-year-old rookie above Juan Carlos Ferrero. 

Former world No. 1 Ferrero, plagued by injuries and illness all year, had been widely expected to line up for Spain against the United States. 

Spanish coach Jordi Arrese had other ideas, however, and dropped the bombshell at Seville?s Olympic Stadium on Thursday. 

?It was certainly a surprise not to be picked,? Ferrero said. ?Physically I am at 100 per cent and I have had three days of good training. Obviously I am not jumping up and down with happiness, but you have to take things as they come.? 

Nadal, who was sidelined from April to July with a stress fracture of his ankle, was equally non-plussed. 

?I am surprised by this as well, considering the problems I have had,? he said. ?And I am a little bit nervous which is not surprising considering a match like this.? 

Roddick, too, was perplexed. ?Personally, I was expecting to play Ferrero,? he said. ?But at the same time, I think our team knows that they have four very capable singles players, and one of their strengths is that they do have options. You know, they can mix and match.? 

Nadal?s heroics in September?s semi-final against France probably proved decisive. He carried Spain through to their third final in five years with an assured straight-set victory over Arnaud Clement. 

Friday?s other singles will pit Carlos Moya against Olympic silver-medallist Mardy Fish. Moya, another former world No. 1 and claycourt specialist, will go into the match as favourite, although Fish has won two of the pair?s previous three meetings. 

Nadal is due to team up with Tommy Robredo to play the Bryan twins Mike and Bob in Saturday?s doubles with the reverse singles scheduled for Sunday. 

Nadal, playing his first year on Davis Cup, has won two of his three singles matches and is confident of continuing his form against Roddick. 

?I will just go and play tomorrow. I can do a good job,? he smiled. 

Roddick knows he faces a tough task against the left-hander in front of 26,000 vocal Spaniards. 

?He has a lot of game,? the world No. 2 said. ?You know, he hits the ball a ton, and he?s very competitive. In an atmosphere like this, he?s going to get the crowd going. I think Davis Cup might work well for him.?

 Klinsmann booster for older players

 Klinsmann 

Frankfurt: Germany?s neglected older players, such as midfielder Dietmar Hamann and striker Oliver Neuville should not give up hope of claiming World Cup places, coach Juergen Klinsmann said Wednesday. 

?Certainly, they still have a chance,? Klinsmann told a news conference when asked about the two 31-year-olds who have yet to feature in the five months since the new coach took over. 

?Age doesn?t matter. With some of the players we already know what they can do. We?re regularly keeping an eye on all of our candidates and are staying well informed about their performances. A lot is going to happen before the World Cup. 

?The fact of the matter is that the players who have recently been on the team have a slight advantage. The more experienced players out there know that they have to step on the gas now if they want to get back on the team.? 

Germany, who will host the 2006 World Cup, lost their unbeaten record under Klinsmann on their Asian tour, with a 3-1 defeat by South Korea coming between comfortable victories over Japan and Thailand. 

?I?m generally very content,? Klinsmann said when asked for an overall view on the progress made since his arrival following Euro 2004. 

?The players have quickly grasped our philosophy regarding the main goal of the 2006 World Cup. 

?For 2005, I hope we continue to go in the right direction. We don?t have to qualify for the World Cup but we have games against Argentina, Holland and France to test ourselves, as well as the Confederations Cup.?

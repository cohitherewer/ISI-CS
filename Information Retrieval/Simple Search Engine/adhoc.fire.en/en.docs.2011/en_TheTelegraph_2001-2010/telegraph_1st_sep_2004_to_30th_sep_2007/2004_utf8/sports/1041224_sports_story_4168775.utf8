A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta: Sanjeev Mehra 

 got a taste of his own medicine when he succumbed to Coimbatore 

 teenager Joseph Chakola on the 20th hole in the quarter 

 finals of the Goodricke Eastern India Amateur championship, 

 being played at the par-72 Royal Calcutta Golf Club (RCGC) 

 course on Thursday. The tournament is part of the Eastern 

 Swing of the Royal Challenge Indian Golf Tour. 

 In the other quarter final ties, Sandy Lehal upset Vikrant Chopra?s plan with a 2 amp;1 victory while Navtez Singh triumphed over H.S. Kang at a score of 1-up.

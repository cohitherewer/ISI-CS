 Zhao joins Hari on top

Kochi: Chinese junior champion Zhao Jun bounced back with a masterful win to share the lead with GM P. Harikrishna with 9.5 points after 12 rounds of the world junior chess meet here on Monday. 

On the top board, GM Yuri Drozdovsky of Ukraine drew with overnight leader Harikrishna in seven moves. It put the Indian GM in a must-win situation against top seed GM Berkes Ferenc of Hungary in the last round on Tuesday. 

Jun, close on the heels of the Indian since the eighth round, did well to defeat IM Quezada Perez Yunieski of Cuba in 50 moves. 

In the world girls under-20 championship, top seed WGM Korbut Ekaterina of Russia and Paehtz Elisabeth of Germany maintained their joint lead with 9.5. (PTI)

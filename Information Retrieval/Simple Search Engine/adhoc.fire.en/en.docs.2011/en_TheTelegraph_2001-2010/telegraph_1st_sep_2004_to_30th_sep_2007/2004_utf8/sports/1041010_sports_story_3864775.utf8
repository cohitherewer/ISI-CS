The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Lanka to probe Renown show

 A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: The Sri Lankan football federation, in a letter to the Indian Football Association (IFA) on Saturday, has pledged to hold an enquiry into the disastrous performance of Renown Sports Club in the ongoing IFA Shield. 

Renown conceded 19 goals in two matches ? nine against Mohun Bagan and 10 against Myanmar Finance and Revenue FC ? prompting IFA secretary Subrata Dutta to lodge a complaint to the Sri Lankan football federation. V. Manilal Fernando, chairman, Football Federation of Sri Lanka (FFSL) has termed the debacle as ?unfortunate?. According to him, he had given special permission to the club to include four foreigners to bolster the squad before their departure for India, but they chose not to do so, resulting in this debacle. 

Santosh Trophy camp 

The number of probables for Bengal?s Santosh Trophy camp increased to 21 at the SAI Complex on Saturday. Three from East Bengal joined the camp, Madhab Das, Selwyn Fernandes and Shylo Malsawmtluanga. Debjit Ghosh and Chandan Das, however, did not join on Saturday due to fatigue. The team will leave for New Delhi on October 13. 

Meanwhile, Bhaichung Bhutia on Saturday informed that he would be fit to make it to the East Bengal squad in the Durand Cup following his injury. The star striker also said that if Sikkim qualify for the Santosh Trophy quarter finals, he might turn out for his home state, for whom he has never played. 

Meanwhile, Mohun Bagan are unlikely to take part in the All Airlines Gold Cup scheduled to be held from mid-October. The tournament seems to be in jeopardy with East Bengal having already announced their intention of not taking part in the meet. 

East Bengal?s dependable defender M. Suresh may be out for the entire season. According to Dr Shanti Ranjan Dasgupta, only time will tell when Suresh ? who suffered an injury on his knee-joint ? will be able to return. The defender?s exact status will be known only when he joins practice.

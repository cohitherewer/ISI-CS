Harare: England players will not be expected to shake hands with Zimbabwean government officials during their controversial tour, captain Michael Vaughan said on Saturday. 

?It has been confirmed to us that we will not have to shake the hand of any government official,? Vaughan told a news conference in Harare where England play the first ODI of the four-match series on Sunday. 

England?s tour was delayed after a row over accreditation for majority of British journalists covering the tour. The team flew to Harare from South Africa on Friday after Zimbabwe said it would allow the barred journalists in. 

?For the last four days we have been doing things we?re not paid to do,? added Vaughan. 

?Now we need to play the four games and get out of here.?

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Indisciplined show to blame: Ghavri

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Karsan Ghavri feels a reshuffle is required in his squad before Bengal take on Andhra Pradesh in their next Ranji Trophy Elite group A engagement. 

As his team struggled to save the match against Mumbai, the Bengal coach lashed out at his batsmen for their indisciplined show. 

?A couple of wickets were simply thrown away. Both Laxmi Ratan Shukla and Sanjib Sanyal played very bad shots and got out. They must realise they are not playing club cricket,? Ghavri told reporters after the third day?s play. 

?Mumbai played very disciplined cricket. On our part, rather unfortunately, we had only indisciplined cricket on offer,? he added. 

Ghavri thought it?s now ?just a question of survival? for Bengal. ?The onus lies with the batsmen. 

?The wicket is not that bad. We?ve got to stay at the crease and bat for 90 overs. That?s the only way out for us to save the match,? he remarked. 

Ramesh Powar, the chief architect in Bengal?s collapse, however, had little doubt on the outcome of the match. 

?We?re going to win? we?re very optimist about it,? Powar, who took seven for 55, said. 

?Such a wicket with low bounce isn?t helpful for spinners. 

?I just bowled a good line, was patient and in the end, got the results. Of course, some of them played poor shots to help our cause,? the 26-year-old spinner said of his best performance so far. His previous best was six for 30 against East Zone in the Deodhar Trophy.

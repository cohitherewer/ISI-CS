The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Rs 500 more may have saved Junior 

 - Goa government orders fresh autopsy 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Bangalore: The obtusely tight-fisted Karnataka State Football Association?s (KSFA) unwillingness to pay an extra Rs 500 per day for proper medical facilities at the ground may have cost Dempo FC striker Cristiano de lima Junior?s death. 

While the buck passes swiftly, and while the callous AIFF in New Delhi found a fine scapegoat in referee Maheswaran Balu and suspended him from postings, down in this southern state capital, Dr Thomas Chandy, director of HOSMAT Hospital, the clinic ?responsible? for the medical treatment at the venue and where Junior was taken dead, revealed Friday that Rs 500 more would have allowed the hospital to provide a fully qualified doctor at the venue, instead of two physiotherapists. 

Meanwhile, the Goa government on Friday ordered a 

fresh autopsy on Junior, a day after his widow Juliana petitioned chief minister 

Manohar Parrikar asking for the same. 

Dr Chandy said, on November 22 B. T. Bhoopal, secretary Bangalore District Football Association, had gone to the hospital with a request for an ambulance, a physiotherapist and couple of stretcher boys. 

When told about a fee of Rs 1000 a day for a senior doctor, Bhoopal had said the KSFA could not afford it, but agreed to pay Rs 500 a day for the ambulance (including two physiotherapists). ?Our team went to the stadium and checked for medical facilities. There were no facilities, no medical room at the stadium,? he said. 

Another shocking revelation was that six days before his tragic end, Junior had been taken to the hospital with a bumps on his face and forehead (following a collision during a league match). The CT scan of his head and face was normal, but the striker was asked to visit the hospital the next day for an expert opinion by a neurosurgeon. 

Junior chose to ignore the doctor?s advice and did not turn up for subsequent tests, Dr Chandy said. 

And why the death despite the ambulance and the hospital? Dr Chandy said the HOSMAT ambulance was well-equipped with a ventilator, emergency drugs and ECG, but only an experienced doctor could have fitted the ventilator on Junior. 

However, the nearest hospital wasn?t the HOSMAT. The Mallya Hospital is just about across the street to the Sree Kanteerava Stadium. First there was this delay in calling in the stretcher boys and then the late CPR, and over 13 minutes had passed before he was at the HOSMAT. ?His body was cold from the beginning, without a heart beat or breathing,? Dr Chandy said. 

 Autopsy confirms cardiac arrest 

Meanwhile, the autopsy report, released Friday, said Junior?s death was a rare case of cardiac arrest. The report said: ?Death is due to cardiac arrest as a result of functional cardiac disturbances consequent upon overexertion and excitement.? 

The report ruled out injuries, toxic substances, barbiturates (drugs) or performance-enhancing drugs as likely cause for the death. ?Chemical analysis and histo-pathological tests of blood-urine samples and tissues of heart, lungs, brain and stomach do not indicate presence of volatile poisons or toxic metals,? doctors said at the Government Victoria Hospital here said.

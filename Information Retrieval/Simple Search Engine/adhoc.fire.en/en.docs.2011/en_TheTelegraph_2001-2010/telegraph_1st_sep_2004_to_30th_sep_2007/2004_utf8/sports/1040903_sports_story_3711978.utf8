 Jadhavs 163 n.o. buoys India A

New Delhi: Opener Dheeraj Jadhav hit an unbeaten 163 to put India A in a commanding position against Kenya in the first innings of their second and final tour match in Nairobi. 

Electing to bat, the Indian batsmen led by Jadhav pounded the Kenyan bowlers to pile up 344 for three at stumps on the first day of the three-day match the Simba Union ground on Wednesday. 

The early dismissal of opener Naman Ojha (17) with the total on 24 failed to put any pressure on the Indians as Jadhav and in-form Mahendra Singh Dhoni (78) added 132 runs for the second wicket to set the stage for a huge score. 

Dhoni, came up with an aggressive innings which saw him rush to his half century in just 30 balls with 10 fours. His knock came in 65 balls with the help of 13 boundaries before he was removed by Tony Suji, caught by Brijal Patel. 

S. Sriram (36) then joined Jadhav in the middle and the duo took the score to 282 before Steve Tikolo struck castling the Tamil Nadu player. 

But even Srirams dismissal hardly gave the home team any respite as the visitors prospered through Jadhav and Ambati Rayudu (39 not out). 

For the Kenyans, Peter Ongondo, Suji and Tikolo took a wicket each. 

Brief scores 

India A 344/3 (D. Jadhav 163 batting, M. S. Dhoni 78, A. Rayudu 39 batting) vs Kenya. Match to continue.

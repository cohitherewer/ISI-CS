 Federer assured of year-end No. 1 ranking

London: It is mid-September and Roger Federer has already guaranteed he will end the year as world No. 1. 

Winner of three of the four Grand Slams in 2004, the Swiss has built an insurmountable lead in the year-long Champions Race. He has 1,087 points compared with 647 for second-placed Andy Roddick of the US. 

The ATP said it believed this was the earliest in the year a player had locked up the No. 1 position in the professional era. Federer won the US Open last weekend to add to his Australian Open and Wimbledon crowns this year.

Port Elizabeth: South Africa hit back with two quick wickets to leave the first Test against England evenly poised on Monday. Simon Jones took four wickets in the afternoon session on the fourth day but England, chasing 142 to take the opening match of the series, then slumped to 11 for two. 

Fast bowler Jones claimed four for 39 from 13.1 overs as South Africa collapsed to a second innings total of 229. 

Shaun Pollock then had Marcus Trescothick caught-behind with the first ball of England?s second innings. Mark Butcher then survived a strong leg-before appeal from Pollock but England?s No. 3 was out for a duck soon after, caught low down at first slip by Graeme Smith off Makhaya Ntini. 

South African captain Smith had earlier scored 55 before top-edging a hook from Andrew Flintoff. Jones made good ground from fine leg and dived to complete a fine catch centimetres from the turf. 

Smith batted for three hours, faced 105 balls and hit five fours, and his dismissal ended a stand of 88 for the third wicket with Jacques Kallis. 

Three overs before lunch, first-innings centurion Boeta Dippenaar attempted to cut left-arm spinner Ashley Giles? third ball of the day and dragged it onto his leg stump to be bowled for 10. 

England squandered an opportunity to dismiss Kallis for 28 when Butcher dropped him in the covers off Hoggard. 

Jones struck in the sixth over after lunch when he trapped Kallis for 61.

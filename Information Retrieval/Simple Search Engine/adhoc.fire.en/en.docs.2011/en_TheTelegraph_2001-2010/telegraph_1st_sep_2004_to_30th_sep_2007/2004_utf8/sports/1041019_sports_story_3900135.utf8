The Telegraph - Calcutta

Win or lose, be on lookout for talent

Stickwork

Gurbux Singh

Surely this Champions Trophy opportunity is godsend. 

I hope India make full use of it. Frankly speaking, with a little better play, 

India should have in any case been there among the top five. This is considering 

India?s performance over the last two years.

Let us consider the India leg of the India-Pakistan 

Test series. Frankly, I will go for a positive picture. Like a lot of other people, 

I also had felt that the Indians would get a drubbing. I was under the impression 

that India did not possess a good second string, but I am happy that I have been 

proved partially wrong. 

But then, we must remember, that world hockey today 

does not begin and end with India and Pakistan. 

I believe that experimentation should go on. I have 

said this before and I am saying it again. Now is the time to do this, because 

I think out of this, many more youngsters will emerge in the limelight and we 

just might see another star.

Look at goalkeeper Adrian D?Souza. He is new. He did 

not have the No. 1 position. It was only after the Amsterdam meet, where we got 

a drubbing from Holland and Germany and Pakistan and with Devesh Chauhan?s failure, 

that Adrian was tried. 

Adrian?s ability to move fast is a plus. Because, 

according to the new rule, defenders are not allowed to rush during a penalty 

corner. Only the goalkeeper can charge out, because he is padded up. And Adrian 

quickly established his position.

The team is settling down. Dilip Tirkey?s considerable 

experience and ability is available, Viren Rasquinha is at hand, Prabodh Tirkey, 

William Xalco, Vikram Pillay? we have to see how many really are able to cement 

their places in the squad. We cannot really judge them versus Pakistan. The Champions 

Trophy will be the acid test. We have also to remember that even Pakistan will 

be a different team in the Champions Trophy, and at home.

If fit, Deepak Thakurs presence will add weight to the 

forward line

But we must not be overawed, we must keep on trying 

and go in with an open mind. I am absolutely not interested in the outcome of 

the Champions Trophy, vis-?-vis India. They must come out having given their best, 

that is all. And the team think tank will have to keep in mind that experimentation 

will be essential now.

The new players, of what I saw, may not be very skilful 

?I didn?t see many concerted, individual moves from the forwards ? but the free 

flowing nature, the enterprise, and the attitude of going all out and helping 

the defence and fast counterattacks were good. Many goals have come because of 

that. Though this usual poor Pakistani defence has helped it. 

Let?s not judge our new team?s strength by this Test 

series. Holland and Germany would not allow these counter-attacks. Also they don?t 

have the poor conversion rate of Pakistan. Yet, credit to Adrian and our defenders.

The lingering worry is lack of a good drag-flicker. 

We have to find a good one, and quick. We have to fill up the place left vacant 

by Jugraj Singh. Sandeep Singh has been okay, but he hasn?t got much of an opening. 

The reason for that is the fact that he has also to make himself good for the 

team as a player and not just as a drag-flicker.

We have a long way to go. Our midfield is very workmanlike, 

but it has to play a more dominant role.

One thing that has come out of this series is that 

in many matches we have practically played with five halves and three forwards, 

concentrating on counterattacks. There has been more emphasis on attacks from 

the flanks with a minimum of four, if not five, moving into the attack. I believe 

we must use the right flank more, in a more traditional way. More of dribbling 

and distribution there.

With the possible addition of Gagan Ajit Singh (if 

fit) and Deepak Thakur (also, if fit) there will be much weight added to the forward 

line. All said and done, Gagan Ajit is a feared forward in world hockey. 

I believe this Champions Trophy will be an open tournament, 

because everybody will be building teams. There will be retirements, thoughts 

on the next World Cup and Olympics, and generally free hockey with the pressure 

of the Olympics off. 

The next Champions Trophy, in India will surely see 

a stronger home team. The next two years is important in finding another Jugraj. 

He was a motivator who could handle the pressure of big time, like a giant and 

a scorer. He was par excellence even at that age. People started naming him along 

with Sohail Abbas. Jugraj was also a great defender, Sohail isn?t. 

In his youth, Dhanraj Pillay was also one of the motivators. 

He had his negatives but was a great player and motivator nevertheless. In fast, 

body contact games like hockey you need people like these.

Maybe we?ll find another.

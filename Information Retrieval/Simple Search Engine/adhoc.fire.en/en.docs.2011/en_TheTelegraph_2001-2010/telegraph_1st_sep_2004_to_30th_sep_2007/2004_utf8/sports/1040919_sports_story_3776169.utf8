 Kannan bags title

New Delhi: Unseeded Vijay Kannan produced some fantastic winners under pressure to upset fifth seed Vinod Sridhar in straight sets and clinch the $10,000 Indian Oil ITF men?s futures tennis title on Saturday. 

Kannan was stretched on numerous occasions by his higher-ranked opponent, but he managed to keep his nerve and carve out a 7-5, 6-3 win and pocket his first-ever futures title. 

The ONGC employee had an indifferent start with his serve deserting him for most of the first set. (PTI)

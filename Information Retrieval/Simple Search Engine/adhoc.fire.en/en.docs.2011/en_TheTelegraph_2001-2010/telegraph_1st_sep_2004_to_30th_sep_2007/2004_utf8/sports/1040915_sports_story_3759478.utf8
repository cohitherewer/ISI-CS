The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Ever-Ready whip Tolly

 - SUPER DIVISION CHAMPIONSHIP LEG 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Ever-Ready maintained their superb form in the Super Division championship leg with a classy 3-0 win over Tollygunge Agragami at the Howrah Stadium on Tuesday. 

Ever-Ready, who were third after the first phase of the league, moved to 29 points from 15 matches. Tollygunge?s tally is 25. 

Mohammedan Sporting, who had bowed to Ever-Ready the other day, returned to winning ways at the expense of George Telegraph. 

Playing at the Kalyani Stadium, the black-and-white brigade rode goals from Amjad Hussain and Rauf to full points. 

The margin would have been more convincing had Henry Chukwukei not spurned a penalty. 

Mohammedan Sporting took their tally to 23 points with three matches to play. George Telegraph stayed put on 22. 

Ever-Ready took the lead six minutes into the match with Tollygunge, Eugene Gray?s powerful side-volley finding the target after Jayanta Sen and Ernest Jeremiah had done the spadework. 

The trio toyed with the opposition, despite the presence of Isiaka Awoyemi at the heart of the Tollygunge defence. Twelve minutes after change of ends, Gray failed to utilise an inviting cross from Jeremiah, but Jayanta dispossessed a Tollygunge defender and scored with ease. 

With the game an hour old, it was Jeremiah?s turn to get into the scoresheet. He capped an excellent move with Gray with a clinical finish. 

Tollygunge did have their chances but were either denied by the woodwork or Ever-Ready custodian Gautam Das.

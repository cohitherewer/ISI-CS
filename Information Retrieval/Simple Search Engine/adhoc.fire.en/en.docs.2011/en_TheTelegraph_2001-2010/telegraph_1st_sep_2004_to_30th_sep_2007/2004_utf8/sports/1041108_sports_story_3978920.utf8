 Brazilian player shot dead

Stockholm: Brazilian soccer player Claudinei 

Resende has been killed in a gang-related shooting at a nightclub in his native 

city Belo Horizonte, the Swedish daily Expressen reported on Saturday. 

The 26-year-old midfielder for Brazilian club America, 

who was formerly with Swedish first division club Helsingborg, was shot in the 

head, according to witnesses. 

Four of Resende?s friends were hit, three of them suffering severe injuries, in an incident reportedly triggered by an argument at the club an hour earlier. 

?He was not involved in the argument,? Resende?s friend Samuel dos Reis was quoted as saying on television. ?They were coming for one of Claudinei?s friends but he wasn?t able to escape.? 

Police have arrested two suspects. (REUTERS)

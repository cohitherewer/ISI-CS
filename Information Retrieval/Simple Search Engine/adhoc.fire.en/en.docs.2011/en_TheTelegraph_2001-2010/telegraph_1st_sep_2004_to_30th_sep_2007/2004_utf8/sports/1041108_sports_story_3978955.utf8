 Windies drop Dwayne Smith

Bridgetown: Explosive batsman Dwayne Smith was a surprise omission as West Indies officials named a 25-member probables list for next year?s triangular one-day series in Australia. The 21-year-old smith scored a century on Test debut against South Africa at Cape Town last January and had been chosen in all the West Indies? squads since. 

But the powerful right-hander, who also bowls tidy medium pace, will miss a three-week training camp ahead of the Australian series after a disappointing summer tour of England. ?The selection was based on two things,? chairman of selectors Joey Carew said Saturday. ?The return of some of those who were on the injured or unavailability list, and secondly on performance in the regional one-day tournament.? 

THE PROBABLES 

Ian Bradshaw, Dwayne Bravo, Courtney Browne, Deighton Butler, Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Pedro Collins, Corey Collymore, Mervyn Dillon, Narsingh Deonarine, Sherwin Ganga, Daren Ganga, Chris Gayle, Ryan Hinds, Wavell Hinds, Reon King, Brian Lara, Xavier Marshall, Runako Morton, Ricardo Powell, Denesh Ramdin, Darren Sammy, Marlon Samuels, Ramnaresh Sarwan, Devon Smith, Dwight Washington.

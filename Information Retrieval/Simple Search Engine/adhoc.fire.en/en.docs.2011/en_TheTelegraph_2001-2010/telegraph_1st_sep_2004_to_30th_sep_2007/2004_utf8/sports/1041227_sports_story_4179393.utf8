Dhaka: Bangladesh captain Habibul Bashar hailed his team?s victory over India in the second one-day International on Sunday, sparking off a nation-wide celebration. 

?Beating India, it is a big win for us? It is definitely a dream win for us,? a delighted Bashar said after his unfancied side pulled off a 15-run victory to level the series 1-1 ahead of Monday?s decider. 

?I had not said so before the match because I wanted to be realistic. But now that we had won the match, we are all happy about it.? 

?Our fielding was significant,? Bashar said. ?We knew our total was not big and said in the dressing room that we had to field well.? 

Rajin Saleh led the effort with two run outs with direct hits and a catch for Bangladesh, who had won only five of their 99 previous one-day matches. 

Fans danced in the galleries as Bangladesh completed their shock win before thousands took to the streets to celebrate. People danced to drum beats and burst crackers in many parts of the country. Police kept a close watch to prevent violence. 

It was Bangladesh?s third against a Test playing nation. But it came in their 100th one-dayer and was their first win at home. 

Bashar, only player in the team to have played the inaugural Test against India in 2000, said a win being rare for his side, he would cherish all the six victories equally. 

?Every win is a win. I would not like to rate them. For Bangladesh each win has come after a long time,? he said. 

?It is a wonderful feeling. You must have seen the number of people outside and inside the stadium. To perform in front of so many people is great. Still winning is not a matter for us. We want to keep improving,? Bashar added. 

Team India captain Sourav Ganguly, on the other hand, said youngsters alone could not be blamed for the loss to Bangladesh. He hoped the team would be back in full strength for Monday?s series-decider. ?Youngsters in the side have to be given an opportunity when the selectors have picked them. And it is not just the fault of the youngsters, all the eleven members have to take the blame,? Sourav said. 

Sourav, however, agreed that his side has been through a rough patch in the one-dayers this season. ?Yes, we have struggled, but it is a one-day game. We have been beaten by a team that played better than us. We need to wake up and play well tomorrow.? 

Sourav said his side paid the price on Sunday for losing wickets at regular intervals. ?We did not play well, did not bat well. 230 was a gettable target, but we kept losing wickets at regular intervals. 

?Credit must be given to Bangladesh ... They are definitely an improved side since we played them last (in a Test) four years ago. They are a better bowling and fielding side. Of the three departments, they have definitely improved in these two areas.? 

Sourav, then, made it clear that there would be no more experiments in the team after the defeat. ?Of course, we will be back in full strength tomorrow. It is a series decider.? 

He defended Virender Sehwag who got out for zero in the first over of the innings. ?He has just had two or three bad games. We play lot of cricket and a couple of bad games are going to happen. He was in excellent form last season, and when he gets going, he is going to hurt every opposition.? 

Sourav also ruled out any complacency factor for the loss. 

Mashrafee Murtaza, who was declared Man of the Match for his allround performance, said he tried to maintain a good line and length in a bid to tie down the Indian batsmen. 

?I tried to bowl straight, with a good line and length. I am happy to do well in the first match since coming from injury,? he said. (Agencies)

Madrid: England striker Michael Owen continued his prolific scoring form with a fourth goal in as many games to help Real Madrid secure a flattering 2-0 win over Primera Liga newcomers Getafe on Sunday. 

The former Liverpool player, who scored the winners in the 1-0 victories over Dynamo Kiev and Valencia as well as weighing in with another in the midweek Cup victory over Leganes, got on the scoresheet with another well taken goal in the first half. 

His Brazilian strike partner Ronaldo helped disguise what was a disappointing performance when he made it 2-0 eleven minutes from time as Real scored more than once in a league match for the first time this season. 

Earlier, Real Zaragoza put a humiliating midweek King?s Cup exit behind them with a sparkling 3-0 win at home to high-flying Sevilla that propelled them into fourth spot in the table. The visitors? second defeat of the season meant they missed a chance to close the gap on Barcelona, who were held to a 1-1 draw at Athletic Bilbao on Saturday. 

Barcelona lead the standings on 23 points from nine matches, six ahead of Sevilla and seven ahead of Real Madrid, Zaragoza and Levante who are all level on 16 points. 

Levante, the surprise package of the early part of the season, inflicted a first home defeat this term on Osasuna with a spectacular goal from former Barca striker Sergio Garcia. 

In Premier League action, Bolton Wanderers continued their impressive start to the season as they battled to beat in-form Newcastle United 2-1 on Sunday. 

El Hadji Diouf put Bolton ahead in the 52nd minute, Darren Ambrose equalised spectacularly three minutes later and Kevin Davies claimed the close-range winner 20 minutes from time. The result leaves Bolton fourth on 21 points, two behind Everton and five adrift of the top two, Chelsea and Arsenal. 

The game at the Reebok did not catch fire until the second half but two goals in three minutes soon had the fans off their seats. 

In the 52nd minute Radhi Jaidi out-jumped Shay Given, collecting a broken nose from the goalkeeper?s right hook for his trouble, to flick on a Jay Jay Okocha long throw. 

Diouf pounced on the ball to score his first goal for the club he joined on loan from Liverpool at the start of the season. The Senegal striker was booked for removing his shirt in celebration and barely had time to tuck it in before Newcastle equalised. 

Ambrose, the 20-year-old midfielder who was a late addition to the starting line-up, skipped through two tackles before lashing an unstoppable, swerving 25-metre drive into the top corner. Bolton regained the lead in the 70th minute when Newcastle again failed to deal with a straightforward long free kick into the box and Davies slid in bravely to beat Given to the loose ball. 

Juventus maintained their five-point cushion at the top of Serie A on Sunday when they crushed Chievo Verona 3-0 at Turin?s Stadio delle Alpi, adds a report from Rome. 

Goals by strikers Marcelo Zalayeta and Zlatan Ibrahimovic and midfielder Pavel Nedved continued their unbeaten start to the season and gave them 25 points from nine matches. AC Milan are second after beating Sampdoria 1-0 on Saturday. Lecce, on 15 points, lie an increasingly distant third after their defence disintegrated in a 0-4 defeat to Fiorentina. 

Chievo started strongly against Juventus but when midfielder Manuele Blasi chipped the ball over their defence in the 24th minute, striker Zalayeta was ready in the box to turn the ball into the net for his fourth goal in five games. 

Goalkeeper Luca Marchegiani was powerless to prevent Nedved scoring midway through the second half, when the Czech unleashed a vicious, dipping shot from outside the area. 

Eleven minutes from time Ibrahimovic sealed the result when he muscled in front of defender Davide Mandelli and fired home a right-footed finish. 

Elsewhere, AS Roma made up for their midweek defeat by Juventus with a 5-1 demolition of promoted Cagliari.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Amittrajit second

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Calcutta boy Amittrajit Ghosh finished a creditable second, behind Delhi?s Gaurav Gill, in the JK Tyre National racing championship?s finals in Chennai Sunday. The two topped the Formula India Single Seater Maruti Engine (FISSME) category. 

According to information reaching here, Armaan Ebrahim and J.D. Madan were champions in the Formula LGB (1300cc) and salon class categories, respectively. 

On the Sriperumbudur race track near Chennai, there was fast action. Gill was going into the final two races with a three-point lead over Ghosh. The 1-2 was maintained in both races of the category which had as many as 20 entries. 

In the first race Gill, having qualified eighth, was well behind Ghosh, with Gaurav Dalal at pole. Dalal was out in a scorcher, racing to the top, but a crash behind reduced the race to eight laps with Gill moving ahead of Ghosh to finish second. 

In the decider race, presented by Speed and organised by Maruti with tech help from the Madras Motor Sports Club, Ghosh started alongside pole Dalal. Gill was right behind. But Dalal failed to repeat the first race performance and finished a poor fourth. Ghosh had stormed ahead, and took the chequered flag at 18:38.949. 

Gill finished on Ghosh?s heels. The finish was close enough for Gill to steal the championship slot despite Ghosh?s efforts to clinch maximum points.

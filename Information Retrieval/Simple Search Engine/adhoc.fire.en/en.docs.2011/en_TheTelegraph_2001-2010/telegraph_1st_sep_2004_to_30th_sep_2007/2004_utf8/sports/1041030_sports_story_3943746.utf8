New Delhi: Ten-man Punjab kept their nerve and booked a final berth for the 11th time, defeating Manipur 5-4 via penalty shootout in a Santosh Trophy semi-final on Friday. The match was tied at 1-1 during regulation time. 

Defending champions Manipur had only themselves to blame. 

In the closing minutes of extra time, with the match at 1-1, Manipur striker Tikken Singh?s shot entered the net but his boot also flew goalwards. Refreee S. Suresh disallowed the goal as it was a technical foul. It was construed that the flying boot obstructed the goalkeeper?s vision. 

Later, referee?s inspector and ex-Fifa referee Melwyn D?Souza admitted that in his four decades of experience he had never seen an incident like this. He felt that Tikken in his hurry to enter the field in the 74th minute probably did not tie his shoe laces tightly enough. 

The referee?s quick thinking was applauded by the match commissioner S.R. Deb. 

Ironically, it was Punjab?s Manipuri goalkeeper Kameshwar Singh (from Imphal) who made two smart saves and saw his side through. 

During the tie-break, Manipur?s substitute goalkeeper K. Bijen Singh (came on in extra time) saved Harvinder Singh?s first try. However, Punjab converted the next four through Harpreet Singh, Daljit Singh, Gurjit Atwal and Harish Sharma. 

N. Rajesh Meetei, Bijen Singh and Dharamjit Singh scored for Manipur but James Singh and Y. Raju Singh?s shots were saved. 

Both goals were scored during extra time. Midfielder Parveen Kumar put Punjab ahead in the 101st minute with a neat header off left back Harish Sharma?s diagonal pass. Manipur piled on the pressure with midfielders James Singh, Tomba Singh and Dharamjit Singh initiating moves with darting runs and long range shots. 

In the 115th minute, James dribbled his way to the top of the box and Parveen tripped him to get his second yellow in extra time. He was sent off and will miss the final against Kerala on Sunday. Tomba Singh, however, equalised with a curving free-kick from the edge of the box in the 115th minute. 

Punjab relied on depth in defence, the quick long ball and counter attacks. Manipur had more possession due to their short passes and clever movement off the ball. 

Despite having more possession, Manipur rarely got behind the sturdy Punjab back four. Crosses from the flanks and penetration down the centre were all cut off by Punjab?s central defenders Harpreet Singh (last year played for Mohun Bagan) and Jaspal Singh. 

In the regulation ninety minutes there were few openings. Punjab had the best chance when in the 84th minute Harish overlapped on the left and crossed to Atwal whose powerful header was saved by goalkeeper Noren Singh. 

In extra time, Manipur had more chances but they suffered due to poor finish.

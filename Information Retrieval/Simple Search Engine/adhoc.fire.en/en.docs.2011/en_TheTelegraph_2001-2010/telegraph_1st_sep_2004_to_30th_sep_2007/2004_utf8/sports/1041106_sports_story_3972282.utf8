The Telegraph - Calcutta

Top GM chess in city

A STAFF REPORTER

 Surya Sekhar will be the highest-rated Indian in fray 

Calcutta: Top class international chess will return to the city after a year?s gap, at Gorky Sadan, from Monday to November 17. An 11-round Swiss league meet, simply called the International Open Chess Tournament, will feature 17 Grandmasters, 14 International Masters and a Woman Grandmaster in the city?s Nisha Mohota. 

Announcing this at a press meet of organisers Alekhine Chess Club, club secretary Soumen Mazumdar said 13 countries will be represented, as will five of 11 Indian Grandmasters. Topping the fray, though, will be Belarussian Aleksandrov Aleksej, a GM with an elo rating of 2659 (among the top 50 players in the world today). Second on the list is China?s Ni Hua, once the world boys? rapid champion, and a member of the last Chinese Olympiad squad. He has a rating of 2611. The other player in the 2600 elo rating bracket is Thien Hai Dao of Vietnam (2601). 

Timur Gareev of Uzbekistan (2525) will be another show-stopper. He is in his 16th year and was the youngest Asian Grandmaster. This is a player to be watched, feel the organisers. 

GM Surya Sekhar Ganguly of Calcutta will be the highest rated Indian (2559) in fray. The other Indian GMs to play will be Abhijit Kunte (2550), Sandipan Chanda (2543), Dibyendu Barua (2525) and Tejas Bakre (2491). Mazumdar says there is a possibility that GM Pravin Thipsay might also join the fray. 

Of other Indian GMs, Krishnan Sasikiran is busy in a Spain tournament, P. Harikrishna and Koneru Humpy are at the world youth meet and R.B. Ramesh is in Germany. 

There is no title sponsor yet, as organising committee chairman S. K. Roy confirmed, but there is a decent prize money in store. Only Indian currency will be handed out, but being an international tournament prizes are as follows: $ 3,000 for the winner, $ 2,400 for the runner-up, $ 1,750 for third place, going down to $ 200 to each of the 11th to 15th place players. 

More importantly, there are four players on the brink of crucial norms from this meet. Neelotpal Das is looking for his first GM norm, Lanka Ravi for his second and D.V. Prasad and Mehmood Lodhi of Pakistan for their third norms. 

The countries to be represented are Bangladesh, Belarus, China, India, Iran, Nepal, Pakistan, Portugal, Russia, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan and Vietnam. 

Organisers said the idea was the make this tournament an annual affair, just like the Goodricke International was.

 Mahesh-Max wins in straight sets

New Delhi: Mahesh Bhupathi and Max Mirnyi kept their hopes of qualifying for the semi-finals of the ATP Masters at Houston alive with a straight set win in their second round-robin match in the Blue Group. 

The Indo-Belarussian pair defeated Argentine duo Gaston Etlis and Martin Rodriguez 6-3, 7-6 (7-5) in this season-ending showdown of the year?s top eight pairs, according to information received here on Monday. In their previous match, Bhupathi and Mirnyi had lost to Jonas Bjorkman of Sweden and Todd Woodbridge of Australia 3-6, 2-6. 

In another Blue Group match, Woodbridge and Bjorkman beat brothers Bob and Mike Bryan of America 6-3, 6-4. They have not lost a set in a 2-0 start in the 2004 circuit finale for which the playing field was finalised at the Paris Masters. 

The Bhupathi-Mirnyi team, which was No.2 behind the Bryans last year, has won only one title, at Ams Rome, this year. Mark Knowles of Bahamas and Daniel Nestor of Canada clinched the year-end world No.1 doubles ranking here with a 5-7, 7-6 (7-2), 6-4 win over Belgians Xavier Malisse and Olivier Rochus in a Red Group match.

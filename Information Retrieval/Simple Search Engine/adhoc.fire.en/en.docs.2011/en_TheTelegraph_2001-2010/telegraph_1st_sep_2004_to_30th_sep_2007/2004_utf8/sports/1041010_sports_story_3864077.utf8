 SLC to investigate players? misconduct

Colombo: Sri Lanka?s cricket board have launched an investigation into allegations of drunken misconduct by two of their cricketers during the Champions Trophy. 

Two unnamed players, both members of the squad now playing in Pakistan, were reported in local newspapers to have had a late-night drinking binge in their hotel room on the first night of Sri Lanka?s rain-interrupted first-round match with England. 

?Investigations have been started and we have requested full reports from the team manager,? cricket board president Mohan de Silva said. 

?We have instructed the disciplinary committee, headed by Michael de Zoysa, to look into these allegations and they are making preliminary enquiries now before the players return from Pakistan,? he added. 

No official complaint had been made by team manager Ajit Jayasekera after the tour, but The Island newspaper reported that ?well-informed sources? had tipped off top-level officials.

 Retief Goosen 1 shot ahead

New York: South Africa?s Retief Goosen fired a seven-under-par 65 to take a one-shot lead after the first round of the 36-hole PGA Grand Slam of Golf in Kauai, Hawaii, Tuesday. 

The reigning US Open champion moved ahead of US PGA Championship winner Vijai Singh on the final hole of the day after the Fijian world No. 1 three-putted for a disappointing par five for a 66, while Goosen made a birdie. 

US Masters winner Phil Mickelson also had a good 18th when his second eagle of the round completed a four-under-par 68, three shots off the lead. 

British Open champion Todd Hamilton carded a two-under-par 70 to stand a further two shots back in the elite four-man $1 million event.

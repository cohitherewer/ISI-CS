Calcutta: A mixture of young and old gives the Karnataka side a balanced look this season. The team from South is in the city to face Bengal in the opening fixture of their Ranji Trophy Elite Group on Sunday. 

Turning out for Karnataka will be youngsters Stuart Binny and Udit Patel ? sons of former Indian medium-pacer Roger Binny and former national chief selector Brijesh Patel respectively. Playing alongside them will be veteran Sunil Joshi and Dodda Ganesh. 

However, the burden of an illustrious father hangs heavy on the shoulders of Stuart, who was part of the Parthiv Patel-led Indian side for the under-19 cricket World Cup in New Zealand in 2001. 

?As Roger Binny?s son there?s tremendous pressure on me to perform,? said the 20-year-old allrounder, who is still waiting to break into the India A side. 

Sharing the new ball with Ganesh will be another newcomer N.C. Aiyappa, who won the inaugural speedster contest last year.

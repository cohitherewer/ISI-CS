 Mongia to lead Rest

 - IRANI TROPHY 

 Dinesh Mongia 

Chennai: Dinesh Mongia was named captain of the 14-member Rest of India team which will play Ranji Trophy champions Mumbai in the Irani Trophy match at Mohali from September 22 to 26. 

Announcing this at a press conference here, BCCI secretary S. K. Nair said, ?the team has been picked giving weightage to performance by India A players in the recently concluded tours of Zimbabwe and Kenya.? 

India ?keeper Parthiv Patel, left-arm paceman Zaheer Khan and Bengal medium-pacer Shib Shankar Paul were also named in the squad. 

He said Parthiv was picked although M. S. Dhoni, a wicket-keeper batsman from Bihar, had equal credentials because the committee wanted to assess Patel in a five-day game before the Indian team is picked to play Australia in the four-Test series at home later this year. 

On the omission of Hemang Badani, Nair said ?Badani has not given documentary evidence of having recovered from his injury, while the selectors perused the certificates submitted by Akash Chopra.? 

THE SQUAD 

Rest of India: Dinesh Mongia (captain), S. Sriram (vice captain, Tamil Nadu), Akash Chopra (Delhi), Gautam Ghambir (Delhi), Dheeraj Jadav (Maharashtra), A. T. Rayudu (Hyderabad), Parthiv Patel (Gujarat), Murali Kartik (Rlys), Shib Shankar Paul (Bengal), Zaheer Khan (Baroda), Y. A. Golwalkar (MP), Y. Venugopal Rao (AP), Joginder Sharma (Haryana) and Sidharth Trivedi (Gujarat).

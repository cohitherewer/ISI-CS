 London: British long-distance runner Paula Radcliffe will return to competition for the first time next month since failing to finish either the marathon or the 10,000m at the Athens Olympics. Radcliffe will defend her title in London?s annual 10km road race on November 8. ?After Athens it will be a real joy to come back to the capital and run again for the first time with all the support that London gives,? Radcliffe said. ?I have received some amazing support there in the past.?

 Radcliffe, who holds the women?s world record in the marathon, dropped out of both the marathon and the 10,000 in Athens. She said she had been struggling with an injury. 

 Indore: National Rifle Association of India secretary general Baljeet Singh Sethi on Tuesday said the Centre had agreed to bear the expenses of two foreign coaches Mark Russel and Lazlo Suzak.

 ?The NRAI really appreciates the government move in this regard as it is a big boost for the sport in the country,? Sethi said during a function to honour Olympic silver medallist Major Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore in Indore. Rathore said he would now aim to win a gold medal in the Beijing Olympics and was preparing a roadmap for it by assessing his requirements. Earlier in the day, Infantry College, Mhow organised various functions to honour Rathore, who is now posted at Delhi.

 Melbourne: Australia welcomed the return of Harry Kewell on Tuesday for a rare appearance on home soil in the Confederations Cup play-offs against Solomon Islands. The 26-year-old forward, who travelled after appearing for Liverpool in their 0-1 defeat by Chelsea in London on Sunday, has not played in Australia since 2001. Last season he had a chronic ankle injury and said it was aggravated by travelling long distances. He played for Australia in London last March.

 London: Premier League champions Arsenal announced a sponsorship deal with Emirates Airline worth a potential ?100 million ($178.2 million) on Tuesday, the biggest in English football history. The London club?s new 60,000-seat stadium, due to open in 2006, will be known as the Emirates Stadium and the Dubai-based airline will also sponsor the team?s shirts for eight years starting from 2006.

 ?This is a historic day in the life of Arsenal football club,? chairman Peter Hill-Wood said.

 London: Tottenham Hotspur?s Jamie Redknapp has been charged with serious foul play over a tackle on Everton?s Tim Cahill in their Premier League game on Saturday. Redknapp was cautioned by referee Graham Poll, but FA rules say if they are satisfied a player should have been sent off they can act. Cahill was the victim of an ugly-looking challenge on his knee. 

 Amsterdam: Arjen Robben, Kevin Hofland and Dave van den Bergh have pulled out through injury from the Dutch squad for the World Cup qualifiers against Macedonia on Saturday and Finland next week. The Dutch football association, KNVB, announced on Monday that Robben was deemed not fit enough yet for a national comeback.

Mumbai: Middle order batsman Amol Muzumdar slammed a patient 131 off 206 balls as champions Mumbai took a huge 235-run first innings lead over Gujarat on the penultimate day of their Ranji Trophy Elite Group A match here Wednesday. 

In reply, Gujarat were 102 for two and need 133 runs more to make the hosts bat again. 

In New Delhi, replying to the hosts? heavy first innings score of 427 for seven declared, Karnataka Wednesday managed the build haltingly on their overnight score of 32 sans loss, making 273 for eight as stumps were drawn on the third day of their Ranji Trophy Elite Group A match vs Delhi here. 

The Karnataka scoring was bolstered by Robin Uthappa?s 88 and S. Shinde?s 52. The rest, though failed to complement as Sarandeep Singh C. Nanda picked up two wickets apiece.

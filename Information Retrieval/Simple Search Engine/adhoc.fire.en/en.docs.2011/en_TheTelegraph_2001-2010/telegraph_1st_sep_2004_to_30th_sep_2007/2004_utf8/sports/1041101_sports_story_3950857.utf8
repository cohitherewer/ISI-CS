 2-year ban on Renown SC 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Sri Lanka Football Federation (SLFF) has suspended Renown Sports Club for two years from all international engagements. This was a fallout of the Indian Football Federation?s (IFA) protest to the Sri Lankan federation after the team conceded 19 goals in two matches in the IFA Shield. 

?The chairman of the SLFF, Manilal Fernando was in Delhi recently where he revealed the association?s decision,? IFA secretary Subrata Dutta said.

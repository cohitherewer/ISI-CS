Kanpur: Jacques Kallis has been ruled fit to play the first Test against India starting here from Saturday. 

The South African allrounder had a full practice session and batted without any discomfort at the Green Park Stadium. The visiting team?s media manager Gerald De Kock, however, indicated that Kallis might not bowl in the match. 

The 29-year old suffered a side strain on the second day of the three-day tour game against Board President?s XI in Jaipur earlier this week. 

?It is too early to say whether he will bowl, we can?t rush into a decision on that,? De kock said. 

Meanwhile, former South African captain and allrounder Shaun Pollock on Thursday said the hosts would be under more pressure to perform. 

Pollock said the Indians would start as favourites as they will be playing at home against a young team. 

?The pressure will squarely be on India. They are the favourites and must play well to beat us. We have an inexperienced team; we are just eager to make it count,? Pollock said. 

?It is a transition period in South African cricket. We have a lot of young guys who have come in. They are talented, so we have to give them some time to settle down. To build a good team, it takes some time,? he said in an interview. 

He said the team had prepared well, having practised on spinning tracks at the camp back home. ?We have prepared well and feel confident about handling Indian spinners?. 

As the senior-most member of the team, Pollock said he was willing to take the responsibility of grooming the youngsters, more so the fast bowlers. 

?On the field my role may not have changed much. You still have to go and perform. But off the field, the young guys look up to you for advice,? he said. 

In another development, the South African cricketers were stranded in the dark when the team bus carrying them from Lucknow airport to the venue of the match, broke down. 

The entire squad had a jittery one-hour in the middle of a road five kilometres from the airport last evening, till a replacement bus arrived. Confirming the incident, Gerald De Kock said the players reached Kanpur safely. 

Sachin Tendulkar, Zaheer Khan and physio Andrew Leipus were also affected as they were stranded at the Lucknow airport with no one to pick them up. (PTI)

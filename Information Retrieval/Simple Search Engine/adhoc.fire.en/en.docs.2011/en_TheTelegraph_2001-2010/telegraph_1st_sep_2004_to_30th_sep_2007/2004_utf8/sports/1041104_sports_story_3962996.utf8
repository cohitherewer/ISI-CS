 Balco link in Kenteris case

San Jose: Evidence in the Balco steroid case links Greek sprinters Costas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou to once-undetectable steroid Tetrahydrogestrinone (THG), the San Jose Mercury News reported. 

The newspaper reported Tuesday that an email included in papers filed Friday by prosecutors featured Balco founder Victor Conte making a reference to THG being used by the Greek athletics stars. 

Kenteris and Thanou withdrew from the Athens Olympics in August after missing a doping test. The two athletes and their controversial coach Christos Tzekos are accused of obstructing IOC testers and making false statements about an alleged motorbike accident when admitted to a hospital.

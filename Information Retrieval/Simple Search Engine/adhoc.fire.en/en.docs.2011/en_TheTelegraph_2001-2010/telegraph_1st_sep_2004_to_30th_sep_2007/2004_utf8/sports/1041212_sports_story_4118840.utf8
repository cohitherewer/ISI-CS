 Three ready to succeed Sohail

 Sohail Abbas 

Lahore: Not just one but three ?deadly? drag-flickers are waiting in the wings to fill in the shoes of Sohail Abbas in the Pakistan squad in case the world?s leading goal scorer announces his retirement from international hockey. 

According to coach Roelant Oltmans, these drag-flickers have shown a lot of promise and have the potential to serve the country for a long period. 

?We have Imran Warsi, Mohammed Imran and Ghazanfar Ali, all of whom are fine penalty corner specialists. They have shown tremendous potential and are doing very well at the moment,? Oltmans said. 

?They have got all they need to succeed at the highest level,? he said. 

Abbas, who also holds the Champions Trophy record of most number of goals, has already indicated that he was going to take a ?major decision? regarding his future after the ongoing six-nation tournament. 

People here in Pakistan may be worried about a further slump in the fortunes of the team if Abbas retires, but the player himself thinks otherwise. 

Abbas does not feel his retirement from international hockey will create a void in the Pakistani team. 

?These penalty corner experts are even better than me. They have the potential to come up with deadly drag flicks,? Abbas said. (PTI)

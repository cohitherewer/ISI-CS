New York: Roger Federer and Andre Agassi stayed on course for a quarter-final showdown at the US Open on Saturday, but Maria Sharapova and Carlos Moya were heading home after shock third-round exits (as reported in Mondays Late City edition). 

As the years final Grand Slam began to heat up womens top seed Justine Henin-Hardenne also advanced to the fourth round where she was joined by in-form Lindsay Davenport who notched her 20th consecutive victory. 

World No.1 Federer oozed class against unorthodox Frenchman Fabrice Santoro, winning 6-0, 6-4, 7-6 to move closer to becoming the first man to win three major titles in the same year since Mats Wilander in 1988. 

After a blip in the previous round against Cypriot qualifier Marcos Baghdatis, Federer was back to his flowing best to reach the last 16 where he will face Romanian Andrei Pavel. 

Today I was feeling good, my forehand was working and my serve was there when I needed it, said Federer, who is looking for revenge over Agassi after he was thrashed by the American in the fourth round in 2001. 

Its still a match away from it but it would be nice to play him here, at the Open, to get my revenge, added Federer, who has never been beyond the fourth round. 

Agassi, the oldest man in the draw at 34, demolished Czech Jiri Novak 6-4, 6-2, 6-3 to reach the fourth round for the 14th time of his extraordinary career. The sixth seed dished out a 92-minute lesson to Novak, who had no answer to the sixth seeds laser-guided groundstrokes. 

I turned a corner I needed to turn going into the second week, Agassi said. To beat a player like Novak in straight sets is a very good match for me. I felt I executed the meat and potatoes well today. 

The Sharapova bandwagon was brought to a shuddering halt on Arthur Ashe as Mary Pierce rolled back the years with a sensational 4-6, 6-2, 6-3 victory. 

The 17-year-old Wimbledon champion was expected to overpower the former French and Australian Open winner but Pierce had clearly not read the script. Sharapova won the first set convincingly but 29-year-old Pierce launched a fightback to go through. 

Sharapova, who wore a black ribbon in memory of the tragic events at Beslan where Chechen gunmen killed more than 320 people, tried to keep it all in perspective. 

Another Russian did progress, however, Nadia Petrova coming through a three-hour marathon against Silvia Farina Elia to set up a fourth-round meeting with top seed Henin-Hardenne. The Belgian battled to a 6-4, 6-3 victory over gritty American Lisa Raymond. 

Olivier Rochus, who had never won a singles match at the US Open before this year, completed a great day for Belgium when he hustled his way past third seed Moya. Rochus was inspired as he withstood all that Moya could throw at him to claim a 4-6, 6-4, 6-3, 6-7, 7-5 victory in three hours 38 minutes. 

In an eventful night session, Davenport survived a set point against Russian Elena Bovina to win 7-6, 6-2 and set up a last 16 match-up with Venus Williams. Venus was far from her best against Chanda Rubin, but did just enough for a 7-6, 6-3 victory. 

Two mens five setters had fans on the edge of their seats. 

Armenian Sargis Sargsian followed up his five-hour marathon against Nicolas Massu with another epic against Paul-Henri Mathieu, saving two match points to win 4-6, 4-6, 6-4, 6-2, 7-6 in fours hours 41 minutes to take his total court time to more than 12 hours. His reward is a fourth round match against Agassi. 

Fifth seed Tim Henman twice trailed by a set but kept his Open dream alive with a 4-6, 6-3, 5-7, 6-4, 6-3 defeat of Czech qualifier Michal Tabara to reach the fourth round where he will play Germanys Nicolas Kiefer. 

The last surviving qualifier in the womens draw fell when 17-year-old Anna Chakvetadze, who beat fellow Russian and French Open champion Anastasia Myskina in the previous round, lost to Greeces Eleni Daniilidou 6-4, 6-2. 

Mahesh-Max moves up 

Mahesh Bhupathi and Max Mirnyi of Belarus reached the pre-quarter finals without any effort as they got a walkover in the second round of the mens doubles on Saturday (as reported in Sundays Late City). 

The fourth seeds were slated to play Rainer Schuettler of Germany and Mikhail Youzhny of Russia, who did not turn up for the match. 

Bhupathi-Mirnyi will next meet Spanish duo of Rafael Nadal and Tommy Robredo in the third round.

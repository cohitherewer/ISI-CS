Lahore: India?s hopes of a podium finish came crashing down after they suffered a 2-3 defeat Sunday against Pakistan in a tension-filled bronze medal play-off match of the Champions Trophy hockey tournament. India thus failed to match their best-ever finish (third in Amstelveen, 1982) in the elite six-nation event. 

Sandeep Singh?s two goals were not enough for the eight-time Olympic champions as the hosts got through riding strikes by Sohail Abbas (4th minute), Rehan Butt (28th) and Mudassar Ali Khan (65th). 

The engrossing battle saw the home side finding the net twice to bounce back into the match after the Indians stunned the local supporters with a second-minute goal. A defensive lapse gave India an early penalty corner which was converted by Sandeep with a drag-flick. 

India?s joy was shortlived as Pakistan restored parity just two minutes later with Abbas adding to his world record tally. It happened to be his last international goal as Abbas announced his retirement after the game, along with captain Waseem Ahmed. 

Adrian D?Souza, who was fielded by Indian coach Gerhard Rach after the goalkeeper recovered completely from a hamstring injury he suffered two days back, had no clue to Abbas? rasping shot. 

D?Souza, who had been quite effective in countering Abbas? deadly drag-flicks, did not charge out early to stop the penalty corner specialist?s attempt and paid the price. 

India tried hard to regain the lead and almost scored a minute after conceding the equaliser, but Tushar Khandekar hit over the bar after the spadework had been done by Arjun Halappa. 

With both teams making frantic efforts to take control of the match, the game saw some end-to-end action. There were chances at both ends, but neither side was able to find the target. 

India made three attempts in a span of three minutes through Ignace Tirkey, Sandeep Michael and Halappa, but each time they were denied by goalkeeper Salman Akbar. 

Then it was Pakistan?s turn to step on the accelerator and they earned three more penalty corners. D?Souza, however, was on the ball and denied Abbas by leaving charge timely. 

The Pakistanis, though, didn?t have to wait much longer to take the lead. Rehan Butt ended his scoring drought with a stunning field goal. Shakeel Abbasi, off a counter-attack, took the ball inside the Indian circle before unleashing a reverse-flick which was deflected in by Butt. 

Pakistan looked a much-improved side in the second half with some purposeful play even though India battled hard to level the scores. 

The hosts made it 3-1, scoring from a variation from their seventh penalty corner. After Abbas came up with a carpet shot, Mudassar Ali deflected in with a deft touch to send the big crowd in a frenzy. 

With five minutes to play, it was a tough ask for India to bridge the two-goal deficit. They managed to reduce the margin when Sandeep converted the fourth penalty corner. 

However, the equaliser remained elusive as the determined Pakistanis sealed the bronze medal.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

Superset, models and a new generation

Serve Volley

It was 1977 when Kerry Packer stormed the cricket 

world languishing in flannels and old traditions with his concept of one-day cricket. 

Driven by irresistible consumerism and a spiralling appetite for higher levels 

of excitement with frequent climax, one-day cricket proved to be a great success, 

and is now a billion dollar industry. 

Now, another Australian entrepreneur Steven Duval 

feels that tennis ?isn?t currently changing to keep up with today?s requirements?. 

Duval?s remedy for a tired and stale tennis circuit 

is ?Superset Tennis? ? a one-day exhibition with only eight competitors. Launched 

with the slogan ? ?One Day. One Court. One Set. One winner,? with a winner take 

all, prize money of ?250,000. 

The champion will have to play only three sets during 

the whole day in two sessions, one in the afternoon and other in the evening. 

The tie-break will operate at 10 games all. 

When the concept was tried in the US last year, players, 

in McEnroe?s, words were so nervous that ?six or seven of these guys looked like 

they were about to fall over.? 

They were so tight because there was so much money 

to win and if you don?t win you don?t get anything. An independent video umpire 

will settle disputed calls and the players will be allowed to interact with their 

coaches during the 30-second changeover. Dissension and outbursts on court are 

encouraged to spice up the proceedings. 

Recently at Wembley, in a one day ?Superset? event 

McEnroe faced with a disputed call, which was contrary to his contention, pointed 

to the Hawk-Eye replay on the grant plasma screen and screamed ?That is not even 

accurate!?

He looked at the audience and explained, ?That?s in 

my contract?. Meaning dissent. When I first played at Wimbledon in 1949, I was 

told that it was considered bad manners to even look at the umpire if you got 

a bad call! How times have changed.

Also at the Wembley arena, Andrew Murray, the 17-year-old 

British hope, who won the US junior title was made to walk on to the court for 

his match with a blonde on each arm! Searchlights, blaring rock music and other 

trappings were comparable to the World Wrestling build up before a title fight! 

Duval believes that modern tennis lacks sex appeal. 

In the recent ATP Masters event held in Madrid the 

organisers recruited models as ball girls advertising ?Hugo Boss? products with 

?Boss? printed on tight fitting black tank tops and old-fashioned white knee-length 

skirts. 

It produced a pungent reaction from the Spanish Governments? 

Secretary for Equality calling on the organisers to refrain from using the models 

as it projected women as ?merely objects of decoration and entertainment?! 

Enforcing such a view could well bring entertainment 

to a halt worldwide. Like in Formula One motor racing the winner of the ATP Masters 

tournament in Madrid, Marat Safin was handed a bottle of Champagne with which 

he ritualistically sprayed the losing finalist Nalbandian, and a bevy of frolicking 

ball girl models lined up for the prize giving ceremony. 

There are some incursions into the staid world of 

today?s tennis. The foot is in the door. Tennis, or for that matter any game cannot 

for long hold back the thrust of the new generations, who want everything instantly 

and a never ending high. 

?One Day? or ?Superset? tennis will surely make an 

impact in the tennis world, though it will take time. It is reported that Duval 

has won the support of the representatives of players and the endorsement of British 

LTA, which are both very important factors. 

It will attract a new type of hippeyish younger tennis 

fans, which could well stimulate the game. 

Goran Ivanisevic the colourful Croatian former Wimbledon 

champion who has done many a crazy thing in his day played in the recent ?Superset? 

event at Wembley and said: ?This is good, all this craziness, but maybe there 

is little too much craziness?. 

How right he is, the craziness, alas is in all spheres 

of life and will drive old timers to despair in the coming years.

 Atwal stays tied 13th

 A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: India?s Arjun Atwal maintained his tied 13th spot in the second round with a brilliant 66 to post a ten-under 200 for the three rounds in the Valero Texas Open golf championship on Sunday. 

According to information received here, the leaders were Bart Bryant and Hunter Mahan, the former at a 16 under 194 (a superlative 60 in the third round) and the latter at a 13 under 197 (a fine 62 in the third round notwithstanding). 

Atwal hit six birdies in third round (second, third, seventh, tenth, eleventh and 13th holes), but the ubiquitous bogies did seep in (12th and 16th).Atwal?s third round follows fine 67s in the first two rounds.

 No action against Aussies, says FIH 

Lahore: The international hockey federation Friday ruled out any action against Olympic gold medallists Australia for their refusal to participate in the Champions Trophy now underway here. 

FIH president Els van Breda Vriesman said the game?s governing body could have hardly done anything to ensure Australia?s participation after they did not accept the invitation citing security reasons. ?They did not accept the invitation in the first place. They could not travel due to their government instructions. We in FIH don?t control governments,? Vriesman told reporters here. 

?No hockey federation, be it Australian, Pakistani or Indian, do not control its government,? she said. 

The Dwyer selection 

On the selection of Australian Jamie Dwyer as the Player of the Year even though his side did not participate, she said: ?Their absence only gave more credibility to the entire process. Dwyer won the award, announced Thursday, with an overwhelming 40 out of 85 votes pipping Sohail Abbas of Pakistan to second position. Santiago Freixa of Spain bagged the Young Player of the Year Award. 

India?s captain Dilip Tirkey, nominated in the category for second time in-row, and forward Gagan Ajit Singh, were ignored. Even Indian nomination for the Young Player award ?Adrian D?Souza ? was relegated to the background. (PTI)

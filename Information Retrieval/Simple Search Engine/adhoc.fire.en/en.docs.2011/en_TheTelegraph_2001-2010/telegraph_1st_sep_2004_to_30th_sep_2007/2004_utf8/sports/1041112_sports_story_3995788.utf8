 ?Recent form gives Pakistan the edge, but Sachin factor remains?

 - Too much of Indo-Pak cricket will reduce interest, feels Zaheer Abbas

Calcutta: In former captain Zaheer Abbas? view, Pakistan?s recent form against India gives them the edge in Saturday?s ODI, but the Sachin Tendulkar factor can?t be discounted. 

?Three wins in as many matches this season isn?t something to be ignored. Equally, Sachin didn?t play the last two ODIs (Amstelveen, Birmingham)... Now, of course, he?s back and has it in him to make a difference,? Zaheer told The Telegraph on Thursday. 

In the city as a Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) guest, he added: ?I don?t know the reasons, but India?s performances of late have been different from the tour of Pakistan earlier in the year... Then, the sense of purpose was very evident.? 

According to Zaheer, needle games ? and all Indo-Pak matches are potentially that ? demand exceptional mental toughness and physical fitness with a slip-up being fatal. ?No matter how good a coach, the players must themselves be up to it,? he pointed out. 

Incidentally, Zaheer is disappointed at the gifted Yasir Hameed?s exclusion from the squad for the one-off game: ?We?ve been struggling to get the first three positions right and, to make it worse, Hameed gets dropped...? 

Asked whether it?s time for Moin Khan to put away the big gloves, Zaheer replied: ?That?s a decision he alone has to take... But, yes, a comeback is going to be difficult. 

Zaheer, by the way, had a piece of advice for the administrators. ?We shouldn?t have too many Indo-Pak matches... An overkill will reduce interest and take some sheen off a great rivalry... In eight months, we?ve played eight ODIs... That?s a lot.? 

Did he support the Pakistan Cricket Board decision on Bob Woolmer? 

Well, Zaheer had this to say: ?No... I don?t wish to start a controversy, but only a Pakistani ? certainly not a foreigner ? is going to be most affected if the team doesn?t do well... Also, the communication element may come into play... 

?Moreover, I?m not sure of the difference a coach can make at the highest level... In our time, we never had a coach and didn?t suffer because of the lack of one... Coaches do have a role, but at the U-15 and 17 levels when grooming is a priority...? 

Zaheer, however, welcomed Sunil Gavaskar?s appointment as the Indians? consultant. ?The BCCI has made the right choice... Nobody is more familiar with the ins-and-outs than Sunil... Obviously, his presence could reduce the coach?s importance, but I?m confident an understanding would have been reached between him and John Wright.? 

Speaking about the rival captains, Sourav Ganguly and Inzamam-ul Haq, Zaheer said: ?Inzy is improving... In any case, at this point, I don?t find an alternative... As for Sourav, he?s good, but needs to be consistent with his own batting...? 

Even Sourav will agree.

 Imran lashes out at ICC

 - Stop over-policing officials, urges former Pak captain 

 Imran says selectors shouldnt be included in Code of Conduct 

Islamabad: Imran Khan on Tuesday lashed out at the International Cricket Councils move to bar honorary cricket officials from questioning wrong umpiring decisions, saying it was over policing. 

ICC should concentrate on disciplining the players, coaches and managers who are directly involved, even the heads of the boards can be checked but restricting officials like selectors is over-policing, Imran said. 

Barring officials from criticising does not make any sense, how will then the game improve, he said. 

I think ICCs plans to include selectors in its Code of Conduct is over the top. 

Imrans comments come after ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed warned chief Pakistani selector Wasim Bari over his outburst against English umpire David Shepherd during Pakistans 17-run defeat against Australia in the tri-series final in Amstelveen, late last month. 

Bari called for 63-year-old Shepherd to retire after he adjudged captain Inzamam-ul Haq and Yusuf Youhana out, derailing Pakistans victory march. 

Speed in a letter to Bari said his comments were inflammatory and out of order. 

The former Pakistan captain said elite umpires should be open to criticism. 

An elite umpire is in the limelight, more than before because they are paid more and should be open to criticism if they make fundamental mistakes which alter the course of the match like what happened in Holland, he said. 

Why are the umpires being made sacred cows, Imran said. 

Pakistan Cricket Board should have protested but I am told they have not which is surprising. 

He said the ICC had already robbed the game of some of its charm. 

A player cant appeal, show enthusiasm and celebrate before an umpire gives a decision. It is not understandable as it snatches the game of all the charms.

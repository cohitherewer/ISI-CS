 Kenya money dispute lingers 

Dubai: The Kenyan Cricket Association (KCA) has ruled out a ?serious dispute? with rebel players who are demanding full payment of prize money from the 2003 World Cup and ICC Champions Trophy before agreeing to a new deal. 

?We?re holding just $ 40,000 simply because we want the players to pay their taxes to the government first before they demand the remaining money,? said team manager Ramesh Bhalla. 

Kenya are currently in the United Arab Emirates to play their ICC Intercontinental Cup semi-final against Scotland, which starts in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday. 

?If the players, who were also receiving a salary of $1,000 each month under the old contract, don?t pay their taxes the government will hold us responsible and under the circumstances we have no option but to withhold their money, which anyway is pretty small,? Bhalla said Mon-day.

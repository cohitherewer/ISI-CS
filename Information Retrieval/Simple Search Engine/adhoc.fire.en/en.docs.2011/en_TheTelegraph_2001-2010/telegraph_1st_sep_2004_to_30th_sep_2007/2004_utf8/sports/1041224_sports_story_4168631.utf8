 Chittagong: Sourav Ganguly 

 said Bangladesh were ?never really in the game? after India 

 won the first one-day International by a mere 11 runs.

 ?We kept picking wickets at regular 

 intervals. They were never really in the game,? the Team 

 India captain said at the post-match presentation ceremony 

 on Thursday.

 Bangladesh came real close to 

 the target through an enterprising 39-ball 50 by wicketkeeper-batsman 

 Khaled Mashud after they were struggling at 160 for seven 

 in the 42nd over.

 ?We gave away some runs in the 

 end and that made it look close,? Ganguly commented.

 Asked about the newcomers who 

 were fielded in the one-dayer, the captain they played well 

 in patches and would improve with more exposure.

 ?It was the first game for them. 

 They did well in patches and will improve with time,? he 

 said, adding, every new player would get a chance to play 

 in at least two games in the three-match series.

 According to Ganguly, the wicket 

 was a little tricky to bat on and felt the players did well 

 to take the score to 245 in the end. 

 Bangladesh skipper Habibul Bashar, 

 meanwhile, admitted giving away too many runs in the last 

 three overs proved crucial for his side.

 ?We gave away too many runs in 

 the last three overs. But it was good to see the boys work 

 hard in the middle,? he said.

 ?We will try to put up a similar 

 fight in the remaining two games,? he concluded.

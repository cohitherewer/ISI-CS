The Telegraph - Calcutta

 That 281 changed my career, says Laxman

 - Team india's star middle-order batsman talks about the ones he admires 

most 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: Over three and-a-half years have gone since V. V. S. Laxman?s epic 281 at the Eden, against Australia. That?s an innings which will always be put in the top bracket anywhere. That knock also swelled his admirers? club. The 30-year-old hasn?t had a profitable 2004-05 season, but could quickly produce an outstanding innings. 

Laxman, who spoke to The Telegraph on the eve of the ongoing Test, picked his five favourite batsmen. 

The following are excerpts 

On the qualities he looks for in batsmen 

Commitment, the ability to work hard... Discipline 

and temperament... A good batsman needs to be calm in all situations... And, obviously, 

the technique element is there. Once the basics are right, even the most intimidating 

attack can be handled. 

On the batsmen who made the biggest impression 

when he was growing up 

Sunil Gavaskar, Greg Chappell, Viv Richards, David 

Gower... Then, when I made the U-16s in Hyderabad, I came into close contact with 

Mohammed Azharuddin... He too made an impact and, really, was such a wonderful 

player. 

On his top five batsmen (alphabetical order) 

 Azharuddin: Loved his timing, the wristy 

strokes... His ability to play shots from outside off to on wasn?t short of amazing. 

Even if five-six fielders were there, he still found gaps... That he got a number 

of big hundreds alone says much. 

Top tip received: Never look for shortcuts and don?t ignore fitness. 

 Chappell: Didn?t see any innings of 

his in person, but the video recordings have bowled me over... It?s not difficult 

understanding why people flocked to see him ? after all, his elegance was worth 

going miles to watch... Greg, in fact, also had a superb technique and terrific 

body balance. In my opinion, his on-side play remains unmatched. 

Top tip received: Be clear in the mind. 

 Gavaskar: Admired his technique and 

huge appetite for runs. Anybody with so many Test hundreds (11) versus the West 

Indies attack of the Seventies and Eighties, in any case, has to be great. I?ve 

always regarded him as a mobile manual. 

Top tip received: Keep the head still. 

 Richards: His power-packed strokes apart, 

what I liked most was the way he walked out to take guard... His arrogance was 

statement-making, meant to strike at the confidence of bowlers. He also made a 

statement by not wearing a helmet. 

Top tip received: Prepare well... Don?t leave anything to chance. 

 Sachin Tendulkar: I don?t need to elaborate 

that he has changed Indian cricket... Sachin?s strength is technique and temperament... 

In a way, he has Viv?s arrogance and, like Gavaskar, a big appetite for runs... 

In recent years, of course, he has become more mature and his shot-selection has 

improved tremendously. 

Top tip received: Stay positive. 

On how he looks back on his 281 at the Eden, in 

March 2001 

(Smiles) With huge satisfaction... It helped 

us end the Australians? run of victories... An innings which changed my career, 

establishing me as a middle-order batsman... Also gave me the confidence that 

I could play match-winning knocks. 

On how is pressure best handled 

By not thinking about it, by not encouraging negative 

thoughts... It?s best to not increase the anxiety level. 

Finally, on tips for emerging batsmen 

Have a big appetite for runs and prepare well.

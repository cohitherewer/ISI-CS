United end Arsenal?s unbeaten run

Manchester: Manchester United beat Arsenal 2-0 to end the champions? record run of 49 unbeaten Premier League matches and re-ignite their own title challenge. 

A controversial Ruud van Nistelrooy penalty and a late Wayne Rooney goal secured a priceless win for United, who became the first team since Leeds United on May 4 last year to beat the Gunners in the league. 

Meanwhile, at St James? Park, Manchester City suffered a 3-4 defeat to Newcastle United. 

Arsenal and United slugged it out in pouring rain without creating any clear cut chances until Rooney tripped over the trailing leg of his England teammate Sol Campbell with 17 minutes remaining. 

Van Nistelrooy, who hit the bar with a penalty in the goalless draw in last season?s fixture, found the target in the 73rd minute, sending goalkeeper Jens Lehmann the wrong way with a low shot to his left. 

Rooney completed the win ? and capped a memorable 19th birthday ? with a breakaway goal three minutes into injury time created by substitutes Louis Saha and Alan Smith. Rooney, coincidentally, had helped end a previous Arsenal unbeaten run when, as an Everton player, he scored the winner in a 2-1 victory over Arsenal in October 2002, which halted the Gunners? 30-match streak without defeat. 

Arsenal still lead the league on 25 points from 10 matches, two clear of Chelsea, but United are back in contention on 17 ? and have not lost in 13 league and cup matches since losing 1-0 at Chelsea on the first day of the season. 

It was Arsenal?s first defeat in any competition for 22 matches since Chelsea won 2-1 at Highbury in the Champions League quarter finals last April. Defeat also ended Arsenal?s astonishing unbeaten away league record of 27 matches stretching back to a defeat at Blackburn in March 2003. 

All the goals at St James? Park came in the second half as City fought back from 2-0 and 3-2 down to level at 3-3, only for Craig Bellamy to spoil their day.

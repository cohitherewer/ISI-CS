 Nothing but a win will do, says Shoaib

Faisalabad: Pakistan pacer Shoaib Akhtar played down the importance of his five-wicket haul in the first Test against Sri Lanka on Thursday. 

?I enjoyed taking the wickets and bowling with the new ball. But the match is not over as yet, there?s still a lot to be done,? he said after returning figures of five for 60, his ninth five-wicket haul in Tests. 

?I will not be satisfied until the Test is over and we can win it,? added the 29-year-old. 

?Mohammed Sami and I are looking to score around 70 or 80 runs more on the third day. We need a sizeable lead because the pitch is good for batting,? he said. 

Shoaib (6) and Sami (2) are batting together at the end of the second day?s play with Pakistan on 256 for eight, after bowling out Sri Lanka for 243. 

Sri Lanka?s Thilan Samaraweera said his century had been important for the team. 

?There is nothing wrong with the pitch, it is good for batting,? he said. ?But you have to settle down first. This was a memorable innings for me.? 

Samaraweera?s first three Test hundreds came at his home ground in Colombo. (Reuters)

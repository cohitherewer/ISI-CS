The Telegraph - Calcutta

 India beat Malaysia 

New Delhi: Indian colts registered a consolatory win over Malaysia to end their AFC under-17 championship campaign in Fujieda on Thursday. 

The Indians, who had lost both their earlier group encounters against Iran and Kuwait, were out of contention for the semi-final berth and Thursday?s 2-1 win would have come as little consolation. 

Poibang Pohshna gave India the lead in the 25th minute but the Malaysians drew level through Nizam. 

India pressed for a winner in the second half and were rewarded in the 52nd minute through Sanju Pradhan. (PTI)

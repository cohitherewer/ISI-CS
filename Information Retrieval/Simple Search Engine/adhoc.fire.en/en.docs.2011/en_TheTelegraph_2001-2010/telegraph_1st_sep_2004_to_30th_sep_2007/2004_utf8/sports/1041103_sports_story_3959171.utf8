The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Dravid my role model: Gambhir

 - ?As for openers, I?ve been a fan of Taylor? 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Mumbai: Despite being an opener, the left-handed 

Gautam Gambhir looks up to Rahul Dravid and, as it turns out, his Test debut will 

be under the Bangalorean. 

?Dravid has been my role model... As for openers, 

I?ve been a fan of Mark Taylor,? the somewhat shy Gambhir told The Telegraph 

on Tuesday afternoon. 

The New Delhi-based Gambhir, though, has already played in ODIs ? the Dhaka triangular soon after the 2003 World Cup. As in that tournament, state-mate Virender Sehwag is going to be his opening partner. 

?Of course, this (Test debut) will be the real thing... Yet, I?m not nervous... Nor, for that matter, am I thinking of the pressure. I just wish to enjoy myself,? the 23-year-old ONGC employee added. 

Gambhir?s immediate family (parents Deepak-Seema and younger sister Ekta) won?t be cheering in person, but an uncle and over-the-moon cousins are certainly going to be there at the Wankhede. 

Incidentally, wicketkeeper Dinesh Karthik will be the other debutant.

 Star Angel has it easy 

 STAR RACER

 Gallagher on Star Angel

 Calcutta: Daniel David?s classic hope Star Angel easily walked away with the 1,400m Gavin Johnston Cup, the main event in Friday?s race-card. The victory of the Placerville-Amazing Princess daughter was, however, made easy by the joint favourite Calorific who took the home turn 10 horses wide, therefore leaving the southern challenger with a clear advantage. Mark Gallagher partnered the winner who may run as a clear favourite in the 1,000 Guineas on November 26. RESULTS

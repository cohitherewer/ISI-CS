Auckland: A four-wicket haul by veteran allrounder Chris Cairns and a comprehensive 77 not out by Stephen Fleming set New Zealand up for a comfortable seven-wicket win with 17 overs to spare against Sri Lanka in a one-day International here Sunday. 

Sri Lanka?s lack of batting preparation for New Zealand conditions was underlined as they lasted just 42 overs before being dismissed for 141, and the Black Caps comfortably cruised to 144 in the 33rd over with the loss of only three wickets. 

After a dismal batting performance, the pressure was on the Sri Lankan bowlers to perform, but despite striking early to dismiss Nathan Astle they were at the mercy of the New Zealand batsmen thereafter. Backing Fleming?s unbeaten 77, Mathew Sinclair chimed in with 31 in a 57-run partnership for the second wicket, and Hamish Marshall was not out 14. 

It was New Zealand?s 19th win from 23 completed one-day Internationals and boosted their chances of overtaking Sri Lanka as the world?s second-ranked one-day side after Australia. 

Fleming, whose 77 in 92 balls included eight fours and two sixes, had fortune on his side from the start when he won the toss, put Sri Lanka in to bat and saw Daryll Tuffey dismiss Saman Jayantha with the third ball. ?It was pretty important we started well,? Fleming said. 

After only 10 overs at the crease, the Sri Lankan batsmen were obviously out of sorts and after 13 overs were 35 for four. 

Captain Maravan Atapattu said they should have adapted better to the conditions. 

?We didn?t really apply ourselves. We only have ourselves to blame,? he said. ?There?s a difference in these wickets and the wickets we have back home so we need to tighten up our batting a wee bit.? 

Only Sanath Jayasuriya (43) and Tillekeratne Dilshan (48), put up resistance, cautiously forging a 35-run partnership for the fifth wicket before Cairns outwitted Jayasuriya. 

He bowled two normal length deliveries which were duly despatched for four and six, and then followed with a bouncer which Jayasuriya skied to Marshall at mid wicket. 

Braving an ankle injury after a nasty tumble when delivering his third ball, Cairns finished with four for 33 off eight overs, including three for 13 in his second spell. 

He was eyeing his best one-day figures of five for 42 against Australia in 1997-98, but substitute fielder Ian Butler ran out Dilhara Fernando to end the innings. 

Earlier he was unlucky not to have Dilshan when the ball appeared to hit the top of the stumps but the bails remained firmly in place. 

New Zealand?s new ball bowlers Tuffey and Kyle Mills relished the early swing and seam movement on an overcast day. Tuffey took two for 17 off eight overs, including the wicket of Jayantha in the first over, while Mills took one for 24 off eight.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Federer wins 12th consecutive final

 Roger Federer celebrates his win over Andy Roddick in the Thailand Open final in Bangkok on Sunday 

Bangkok: Roger Federer defeated Andy Roddick 6-4, 6-0 to win the Thailand Open on Sunday, and joined Bjorn Borg and John McEnroe as the only players to win 12 consecutive finals. 

?When I came here I didn?t know what to expect,? said Federer. ?I took it easy after the US Open and was just hoping for a good tournament, and now I?ve won another one so that?s really fantastic. 

?I didn?t believe I could somehow reach 10 (titles) this year, and it just keeps on going. Obviously I?m very happy.? 

The Swiss world No. 1 dominated the American second seed, who received treatment in the second set for a right elbow injury. 

The opening game was drama in itself, with Roddick firing five aces, two double-faults and holding off three break points. Federer had to wait until the seventh game to take the lead, breaking for 4-3 when Roddick netted a forehand. 

Roddick had an opportunity to rescue the set at 5-4, holding two break points. But Federer responded with consecutive aces to get back to deuce. 

Federer maintained the pressure in the second set, as Roddick made a backhand error to give Federer a break for 1-0, and a further break for 3-0 sealed the American?s fate. 

The trainer then attended to Roddick?s elbow, but that did nothing to delay Federer?s march to victory. 

?I hurt my elbow Saturday against Marat Safin, but I don?t think that made a difference. Roger?s been beating people all year,? said Roddick. 

?I came out and gave it a shot, but when I went back to the room Saturday I started to feel something in one of the tendons in my elbow. 

?I probably just strained it, but it made it pretty tough out there. 

?I gave it the best shot I could, but once I got broken in the second I definitely didn?t feel too good about my chances. 

?I was playing with half a deck of cards and I have a bad record against Roger with a full deck of cards, so it was a little disappointing.?

 Andre Agassis strokes continue to sizzle 

 - I love the challenge, and I want to win just as bad

New York: Players, fans and television announcers all continue to marvel at the same wonder here at the US Open. They watch Andre Agassi, the oldest player in the mens singles draw at 34, and see his feet dance, his ground strokes sizzle. They wonder about his legs, his shoulders and his flexibility. 

Physically, former rival Jim Courier said, you have to wonder how he can still do it at this age. More intriguing, though, is why he still wants to. 

Agassi advanced to the third round at the US Open on Thursday, winning two of the first three sets before his opponent, Florian Mayer, retired with a hamstring injury. On a day when the French Open mens and womens champions lost and blamed their defeats on fatigue, a bouncy, energetic Agassi advanced to the weekend for the 14th time in 19 US Open appearances. 

He is considered a major threat to win here because he has maintained his foot speed, his reaction time and his legendary ability to return serve. He has also maintained his desire, which impresses peers most. There are a lot of times when it sort of hits you, how long youve been out here, Agassi said. But Im not retiring at the end of this tournament.... I still love what Im doing. 

Whenever he does retire from the ATP Tour, he will take a long legend with him. He has won more than 60 titles, including eight Grand Slams. He helped reinvigorate the mens game with his dynamic rivalry with Pete Sampras, who is a year younger than Agassi but has been retired for two years. 

He was one of the games most recognised players as a long-haired, loud-mouthed 17-year-old and now hes still one of the games most recognised players as a bald, mellow 34-year-old. His desire to win remains every bit as strong, he says. 

I love the challenge, and I want to win just as bad, Agassi said. Youve got a lot of guys out here with a lot of weapons that they bring to the table. I enjoy that. It really keeps me going. 

Agassis life is filled with signals to retire. Hes married to former tennis star Steffi Graf, and the couple has two children. His main longtime rival, Sampras, is no longer playing. 

Already at this US Open, Agassi has listened to two more younger players Wayne Ferreira and Todd Martin announce their retirements. Yet Agassi needs tennis and tennis needs him. 

Agassis the most popular player in the mens game, an ageing yet still graceful ball of energy with the singular ability to turn spectators into fans. 

When he won a close first set Thursday, the polite Arthur Ashe Stadium crowd erupted. Fans did the wave. They sang Ole. They chanted Agassis name until a befuddled chair umpire asked them no, begged them to quiet down. 

To me, Mayer said, they seemed very loud. Theyll only grow louder as this tournament progresses.

 Ashraful a big gain, says Bashar

Chittagong: Bangladesh captain Habibul Bashar said his side drew a few positives from the series loss to India. 

?One of them is Mohammed Ashraful, who is a fine player and came up with an outstanding performance in the first innings here,? Bashar said. ?We must work on our batting.? Ashraful said he had to concentrate hard while facing the Indian bowling. 

?It was not a easy wicket to bat on, especially against bowlers like Irfan Pathan, Zaheer (Khan), (Anil) Kumble and Harbhajan (Singh). I played ball by ball,? the 20-year-old middle order batsman said. 

 Mahmud for ODIs 

Former captain Khaled Mahmud has been included in the Bangladesh squad for Thursday?s first ODI against India. 

Mahmud was ignored for the two-Test series against India, which Bangladesh lost 0-2. Allrounder Talha Jubair was the only player to be omitted from the 14-man Chittagong Test squad.

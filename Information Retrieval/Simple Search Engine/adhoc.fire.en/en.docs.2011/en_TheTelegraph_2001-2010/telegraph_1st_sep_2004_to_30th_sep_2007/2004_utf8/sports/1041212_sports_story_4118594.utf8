 Trescothick backs England

 - TESTS vs SA - Opener tries to find rhythm overseas 

DEREK PRINGLE

 Trescothick tends to perform better at home 

With seven successive Test victories over the summer, Michael Vaughan?s team will set England?s greatest winning streak should they beat South Africa in Port Elizabeth next week ? some going for a young side who only really began to gel at the beginning of the year. 

But while the force is with them, history is not. In two previous tours here after South Africa?s sporting isolation, England have won just a single Test, the corruption-tainted match at Centurion almost five years ago that Hansie Cronje allegedly threw for a leather jacket. 

And yet South Africa, with injuries to key players and a reactionary coach, appear vulnerable, the opposite of England, who in a rare departure from the norm, act and speak like a side for whom confidence has become second nature. 

?We?ve definitely got it in us to dominate this series,? said Marcus Trescothick, one of England?s senior players, in Johannesburg yesterday. ?We?ve played so well over the past nine months that they are going to be worried.? 

?South Africa are not quite as experienced as in the past. But they?ve still got some very good players who are a real threat to us.? 

Two of them, new-ball bowlers Shaun Pollock and Makhaya Ntini, will be gunning for him now that his reputation for unfussy batting is beginning to rival that of former opener Graham Gooch. 

Like Gooch, Trescothick tends to perform better at home than away. It is quite a disparity and one he would like to start closing.

 Jacobs set to quit

London: Former West Indies wicketkeeper Ridley Jacobs is set to retire at the end of the domestic Caribbean season. 

?I think the upcoming season will be my last year in first-class cricket so I want to give it my best shot and come out on a high,? said Jacobs after being selected in the Leeward Islands side for the domestic season beginning next month. 

The 37-year-old, who played in 65 Tests and 147 ODIs for the West Indies, had knee surgery earlier this year and lost his place in the side. (Reuters)

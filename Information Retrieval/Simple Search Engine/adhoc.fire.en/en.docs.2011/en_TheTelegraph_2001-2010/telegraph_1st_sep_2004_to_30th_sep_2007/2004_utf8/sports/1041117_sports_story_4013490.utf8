Jaipur: South Africa conceded some psychological advantage ahead of the Test series as they suffered a batting collapse and just managed to avoid defeat against the Board President?s XI in the three-day cricket tour match at the Sawai Man Singh Stadium on Tuesday. 

Having conceded a first innings lead of 135, the visitors chose to experiment with their batting order but the decision backfired and they plunged to 150 for eight, only 15 runs ahead and 17 overs left in the day. 

It meant Jacques Kallis, who had suffered a side strain and was advised not to play, had to come out to bat at No. 10. 

Luckily Kallis (12) had captain Graeme Smith (6), who had come in at No. 9, for support and the two negotiated 12 overs before the match was called off with five of the mandatory overs remaining. 

The tourists would note with deep concern that 10 of their 13 wickets that were to fall in the match were picked by spinners. 

Mumbai off-spinner Ramesh Powar picked three for 50 while leg-spinner Sairaj Bahutule grabbed two for 68 for a match haul of seven for 133. 

The visitors, despite reshuffling their batting line-up, could do little to cope with the spin. 

There was little hint of trouble when Jacques Rudolph and Zander de Bruyn added 62 runs for the opening stand. 

Powar picked two wickets off successive balls when he had De Bruyn (35) caught at silly point by Y. Venugopal Rao before Shaun Pollock was caught behind the very next ball. 

The left handed Rudolph cracked three fours and a six for his 31 before he failed to get back to the crease in time and was run out by wicketkeeper M. S. Dhoni. 

Powar then struck the third blow when he took a return catch to dismiss Boeta Dippenaar (23). 

It was a procession thereon with the batsmen showing little willingness to stay at the crease. 

Earlier, resuming at 320 for five, president?s team called halt to their innings an hour into the morning session, immediately after the dismissal of centurion Dinesh Mongia at 361 for six. 

Mongia, 135 overnight, fell for 148 as he played all over and was bowled by Graeme Smith. The Punjab left-hander faced 289 balls during his six-hour and 19 minute stay at the crease and hit 18 fours. 

Mongia was adjudged Man of the Match and cash prize of Rs 35,000 for his effort. 

Hemang Badani remained unbeaten on 74 from 123 balls aided by 11 fours while the sixth-wicket partnership was worth 154 from 256 balls. 

Badani, meanwhile, said India have the psychological advantage going into the two-Test series against South Africa following the visitors poor show against the Board President?s XI. 

?I think we did very well, did whatever we could. We kept them on field for quite sometime, frustrated them and they couldn?t get us all out. That is as good as a psychological blow,? Badani said. 

Kallis doubtful 

Kallis is a doubt for the first Test starting on Saturday after suffering a side strain. The 29-year-old bowled three overs in the match and only batted, coming out at No. 10 and making 12 not out, to help the visitors save the match on Tuesday.

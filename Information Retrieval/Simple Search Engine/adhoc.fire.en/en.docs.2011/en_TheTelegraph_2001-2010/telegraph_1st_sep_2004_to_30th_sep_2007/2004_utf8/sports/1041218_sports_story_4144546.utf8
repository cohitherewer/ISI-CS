The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Thank God for the century: Gambhir

Chittagong: Indian opener Gautam Gambhir was happy, and in a way relieved, to have scored his maiden Test hundred (139) in the second Test versus Bangladesh here Friday. 

?Honestly I am very, very happy. Obviously it is a dream to get a first hundred. I was still nervous because it was my first Test hundred. Thank God that I got this century,? the Delhi batsman said after the match. 

Gambhir?s nervousness was understandable, having fallen short of the milestone by just four runs against South Africa in Kanpur recently. 

Rahul Dravid was full of praise for Gambhir, saying the way he played helped Dravid pace his innings the way he usually does. 

?He is a positive player and played really well. Runs were coming at a fairly decent clip. So it gave me an opportunity to settle in and bat the way I generally I tend to bat. It?s good to see him score his first hundred, I?m really happy for him and I hope it is the first of many.? (PTI)

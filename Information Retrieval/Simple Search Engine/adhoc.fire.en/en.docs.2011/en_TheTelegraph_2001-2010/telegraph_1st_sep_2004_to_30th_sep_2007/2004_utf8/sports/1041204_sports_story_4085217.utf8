The Telegraph - Calcutta

Bagan to meet Dempo in final

 Tomba Singh got Bagan?s matchwinner 

Bangalore: Nigerian import Ronty Soleye Martins scored a hattrick as Goan outfit Dempo prevailed over Tollygunge Agragami 4-3 to storm into the final of the Federation Cup football championship on Friday. In a later semi-final match, Mohun Bagan beat Sporting Club de Goa by a Tomba Singh goal scored in the 17th minute of extra time. 

The striking prowess of Brazilian striker Cristiano Junior, who scored the other goal for Dempo, and Martins came to the fore again in the enthralling encounter at the Sree Kanteerava Stadium. 

Dempo has made two final appearances in the past but has not won the tournament. 

It was Tollygunge who took the lead in the 14th minute thanks to a Surajit Bose header. Bose received the ball from Tarif Ahmed off a Saumik Dey shot. 

Stung by the reverse, Dempo attacked and came up with two goals to lead 2-1 by the 30th minute. 

First Junior found the target after rival goalkeeper Arindam Ghosh did not collect a Martins? hit cleanly. Martins struck again as Tollygunge defenders were caught napping. 

Nigerian striker Suleh Musah made it 2-2 for Tollygunge with a solo, splendid long shot giving no chance to the rival goalkeeper Satish Kumar. In the 45th minute, Martins? powerful shot found the target as Dempo led 3-2 at halftime. 

After the change of ends, the Goan team increased the lead to 4-2 with Martins scoring again. 

Two minutes before the final whistle, Awoemi Isiaka scored for Tollygunge but that was not enough to stop Dempo?s march into the title round. 

Bhowmick unfazed 

A Staff Reporter adds in Calcutta: East Bengal succumbed to the Federation Cup jinx yet again, but Subhas Bhowmick is hardly worried. 

?My team is going through a bad patch, it?s as simple as that. There?s nothing to be worried about? if I were to give so much importance to the result of one match, I couldn?t have been in the coaching job,? the East Bengal coach said Friday. 

East Bengal returned from Bangalore following their 0-1 defeat at the hands of Sporting Clube de Goa in the quarter finals. 

There were high expectations from the red-and-golds, especially after they clinched the Durand Cup and CFL Super Division titles. 

?These things happen? can?t afford to look back,? said Bhowmick who plans to resume training on Monday. His team has to finish off Super Division engagements with a match against Ever-Ready before training eyes on the big one, the National Football League (NFL). 

With the start of the NFL having been postponed to January, Bhowmick is not ready to talk about preparations just now. ?I haven?t thought about the NFL yet, let us first start training??

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Lights cloud Tolly vision

 - Musah likely to play in midfield versus Salgaocar 

A STAFF REPORTER

 Musah is an inspiration to the team, feels coach 

Calcutta: Tollygunge Agragami will begin their Federation Cup campaign against Salgaocar on the opening day of the tournament in Bangalore, Wednesday. 

The match will be played under lights and the coach, Biswajit Das, is worried on this count. 

?We have not played under the lights for a long time. We only came to know about this last night and got official confirmation during today?s managers? meeting,? Das said over phone from Bangalore. 

?We will surely be at a disadvantage. It?s difficult for players to get accustomed to the light after coming on. It would have been better if we had some practice beforehand,? he added. 

And if this was not enough, injury to some key players has kept the coach busy. 

?Isiaka Awoyemi has a hamstring problem, but I will be starting with him,? he remarked. Also in the list of injured players are striker Gouranga Dutta and defender Deb Kumar Sashmal, while midfielder Chinmoy Sarkar is out with a knee injury. But, Dutta and Sashmal will definitely play, the coach stated. 

Das plans to play Suley Musah in the midfield while Akeem Abolanle and Dutta will be the wing-halfs. ?Musah has been an inspiration to the team,? Das added. 

Asked whether the 0-4 drubbing at the hands of East Bengal in their last match of the CFL Super Division will have any effect on the team, the coach replied in the negative. ?I have a better organised team than it was last time. Though injury is a problem, still the rest are eager to give a good account of themselves. 

?We will have to win tomorrow if we want to qualify for the quarters and the boys know that. We are hoping for a good result,? the coach sounded off. 

The inaugural match will be played between defending champions Mahindra United and Fransa Club.

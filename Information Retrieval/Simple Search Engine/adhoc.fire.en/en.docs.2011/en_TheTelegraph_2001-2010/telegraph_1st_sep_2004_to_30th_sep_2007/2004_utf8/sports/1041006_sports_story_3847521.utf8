 Kallis among five feted in SA 

Durban: South Africa?s gifted world-class batsman Jacques Kallis has been named as one of the country?s five Cricketers of the Year 2004. 

Kallis was picked because of his five consecutive centuries against the West Indies in a home series and against New Zealand in New Zealand early this year. 

The prolific batsman was named along with Herschelle Gibbs, Andre Nel, Makhaya Ntini and a provincial player, Alan Dawson, at the SA Cricket Annual Cricketers of the Year awards ceremony in Johannesburg on Monday night. 

Colin Bryden, editor of the SA Cricket Annual, said the awards would give confidence to the players especially at a time when they prepare for the tough tour to India and the home series against England over the next few months. 

Gibbs, Nel and Ntini were recognised for their performance against the West Indies. Gibbs made three centuries in three Tests against the West Indies.

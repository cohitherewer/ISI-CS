The Telegraph - Calcutta

 ?Underground virus? hits Kanpur

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Kanpur: In these parts, it?s called the ?underground virus?. Usually, it strikes before an ODI but, this time, it struck on Saturday evening when all of Kanpur planned to be at the Green Park on Sunday. 

It?s a different story that those who couldn?t make it, didn?t miss anything. 

This virus, of course, almost exclusively affects the Uttar Pradesh Cricket Association (UPCA) brass. As a result, they become incommunicado to avoid having to say ?no? to the many requests for complimentaries. 

On Saturday evening, for example, UPCA secretary Jyoti Bajpai ? also the Board treasurer ? went ?underground? once requests began to pile up. In fact, The Telegraph learnt that senior managers of the team hotel also did a Bajpai. 

The general belief, after all, is that either Bajpai has the complimentaries or the hotel top guns. Denials aren?t taken seriously.

 Injured Taibu uncertain

 - Zimbabwe skipper to go in after fitness test today 

 Taibu has a minor hamstring tear 

London: Zimbabwe are sweating on the fitness of captain and wicketkeeper Tatenda Taibu ahead of their ICC Champions Trophy opener against England at Edgbaston on Friday. 

Taibu went for a scan on his right hamstring on Wednesday while his teammates were involved in a warm-up match against the United States. 

Doctors subsequently confirmed the 21-year-old had sustained a minor tear that will see him face a late fitness test on Friday morning. 

Following the scan, Taibu returned to the ground at Imber Court and said: ?I was told the injury was between grade one and grade two which is not bad, but I do have to have a late fitness test tomorrow. 

?I?m hopeful I will be fit and it shouldn?t be a problem, but it is an important area for me as the wicketkeeper because I?m moving up and down constantly.? 

And Taibu was certain that his little-regarded side were capable of making life tricky for England and fellow-pool D opponents Sri Lanka. 

?There is no doubt we have enough firepower to cause an upset because we?ve got some real talent and if it all clicks we can rock a few teams. 

?The guys try to learn all the time and they back me up completely so it is great to have a squad like that. I know we are underdogs, but I play every game to win and so do the rest of the boys and by doing that we can only get better.? 

Taibu, arguably Zimbabwe cricket?s most successful black player, was thrust into the captaincy back in April after a race row led to the axing of former skipper Heath Streak, an incident which led the ICC to launch an ongoing investigation into the fast bowler?s claims of racism. 

Zimbabwe coach Phil Simmons, the former West Indies batsman, insisted the side was just focusing on on-field issues rather than the wider economic and social problems confronting the troubled state. 

?All these players concentrate on is playing cricket and they try not to think about all the other things that are going on in Zimbabwe,? Simmons said. 

?We don?t have those kind of discussions in our dressing room, we only talk about how to get better at cricket. We start back playing Test cricket in January and it is all about working towards playing five day cricket again. 

?It would be nice to get one over England ahead of their scheduled tour. Even if England send a second team they still have to go and play the games, so we will be preparing for them. 

?I can?t decide which players are going to come and which ones are not: all I can do is get my players ready.?

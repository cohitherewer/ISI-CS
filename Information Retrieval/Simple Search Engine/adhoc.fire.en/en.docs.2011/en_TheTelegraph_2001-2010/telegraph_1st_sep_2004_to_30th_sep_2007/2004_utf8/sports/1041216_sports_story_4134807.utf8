The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Jasjeet moves into lead

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: On a day of high scores, Jasjeet Singh of Noida surged into the lead with a one-under 71 effort in the second round of the Royal Challenge RCGC Cup at the Royal Calcutta Golf Club Wednesday. His two-day tally stands at 140. 

In second place, three strokes behind the leader, was Gagan Verma who played a dismal second round of four-over 76. Forty two players made it to the final two rounds after the cut was applied at 18-over 162. 

Jasjeet?s journey to the top of the leaderboard comprised six birdies and five bogeys. The birdies came on the second, fourth, 12th, 15th, 16th and 17th holes. On the 15th Jasjeet hit a fine bunker shot that landed 15 feet from the pin. He then coolly birdie-putted. 

However, the bogeys were there, too, to negate the 26-year-old?s birdies. 

Overnight leader Gagan Verma had a disappointing day with the putter. His game on the greens, which was his strength on the opening day, let him down as he missed three consecutive eight-feet putts. 

Manav Das played a par, two strokes better than his first day tally to finish at third place with a two-day score of 146. 

Calcutta lad Ranjit Singh shot four-over 76 on the second day to lie tied-fourth along with Sandy Lehal and Navtez Singh.

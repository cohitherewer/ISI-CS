 Sohail Abbas sinks India

 - Champions Trophy

 - Pak drag-flicker erases Hager?s record; Holland in final 

 Pakistan?s Tariq Aziz is surrounded by Indian defenders during their Champions Trophy match in Lahore on Wednesday. India lost 1-2 

Lahore: Sohail Abbas scripted yet another record and guided Pakistan to a 2-1 win over arch-rivals India in their crucial league match in the Champions Trophy hockey tournament on Wednesday. 

The ace drag-flicker, coming to the match just one goal short of erasing Australian Mark Hager?s Champions Trophy record of 32 goals, slammed home from a penalty stroke in the 67th minute as Pakistan won the thrilling encounter at the National Stadium. 

The margin of defeat may appear thin but Pakistan was obviously a much better side in the contest and could have won by a much bigger score had they converted even half of the chances that came their way. 

Saqlain Muhammed?s 32nd minute strike was neutralised by India through Sandeep Singh in the 58th minute, but Abbas put the finishing touch to the match by scoring at a time when it looked like the game was heading for a draw. It was the star player?s fifth goal in the tournament. 

Goalkeeper Adrian D?Souza was the saving grace for the Indians by coming up with a fine performance under the bar but his attempts were not enough as India crashed to their third defeat from four matches. 

The loss also seriously affected India?s chances of playing for the 3-4 places as Pakistan took themselves a step closer for a berth in the final. 

Pakistan played better in the first half as they tested the Indian defence a number of times. The Indians, though made a few inroads but never got a chance to probe Salman Akbar as most of the moves fizzled out inside the circle or just outside it. 

Rehan Butt, struggling to get back into his goal scoring form, was the first to have a go at the Indian post as early as in the sixth minute but his reverse flick went over bar much to the disappointment of the home supporters. 

With the large crowd, probably the biggest in the competition so far, getting restless with Pakistan failing time and again to take the lead, Saqlain Muhammed slammed home. 

Pakistan went to the break with a 1-0 lead but resumed with more sting in their attack which was evident in the very first minute of the second half. 

A long run followed by a cross into the circle gave Pakistan the perfect chance to swell the lead, but Shakeel Abbasi failed to put the ball in. Soon after Rehan got a chance to give Pakistan a firm grip on the match, but the beleaguered forward, who had only D?Souza to beat, hit the ball wide. 

Sandeep Singhs equaliser from India?s first penalty corner enlivened the proceedings as the huge crowd cheered their team to go for the kill. 

Pakistan came close to take the lead when they got a couple of penalty corners more in the 59th minute, but their attempt from a variation did not work while Abbas hit the other wide.The last few minutes saw a lot of drama as Pakistan won a penalty stroke which was converted by Abbas to make the record his own and even though India tried hard to level the score they could not. 

The visitors won a penalty corner just four minutes before the hooter but Sandeep?s drag-flick could not beat the goalkeeper. 

Meanwhile, Holland got themselves into sniffing distance of claiming a hattrick of titles as they beat Spain 4-2 and booked a berth in the final. 

Holland, winners of the last two editions of the event, prevailed over Spain who came up with a relentless attack but failed to find the back of the net more than a couple of times. 

The win, their fourth from as many matches, took the Dutch to the top of the table with 12 points while Spain remained on nine from as many matches. 

An experimental German side came from behind to hold New Zealand 1-1 in another. 

The world champions, playing with a young and inexperienced side, struck through Jan Marco Montag in the 44th minute to neutralise New Zealands lead, which the team from down under had taken in the first half. 

Phillip burrows gave New Zealand the lead in the 26th minute by converting from a penalty corner. 

The draw enabled both teams to open their account in the tournament but they continue to languish at the bottom of the table with just one point apiece.

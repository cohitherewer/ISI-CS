Chennai: Aussie leg-spinner Shane Warne Tuesday said winning the Indian series was more important than him claiming the bowling world record. He said India remained an elusive domain for the Aussies and that his Test record would be an icing on the cake. 

?The series win is uppermost on our minds,? Warne said here. ?I have been playing for 14 or 15 years and we have won everywhere except here. It would be nice to finish your career with such a creditable achievement.? 

?Getting the world record is a nice opportunity for me but from the team?s point of view if we win this Test and take a 2-0 lead, it will be a great situation.? 

Off four first test wickets, Warne has moved to 531, one short of Sri Lanka?s Muttiah Muralidharan the record-holder. 

He said he might have finally got the measure of the Indian batsmen. ?I have worried the batsmen well enough. Initially, I was pretty ordinary and slightly impatient towards the end. After the first 50 overs, I was able to create half chances. I am pretty happy the way I bowled.? 

On the Chennai track, Warne said generally the wicket falls apart and spins a lot. ?I have played few Test matches and a couple of one-day games here. It generally, falls apart and spins a long way. The good thing here is the pitch is a bit faster as compared to Bangalore.? 

Meanwhile, Warne?s mentor Terry Jenner has said that the leg-spinner was trying to bowl too flat and fast and would need to change his tactics, adds a report from Sydney. ?I thought he tried to bowl too quickly and that was not natural for him,? Jenner was quoted as saying by The Courier Mail here Tuesday. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Rameez to defend himself publicly

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

Southampton: Former captain Rameez Raja, who quit as the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chief executive after the recent Asia Cup, intends to publicly defend himself against allegations levelled by former treasurer Naeem Ahmed. 

Ahmed, it may be recalled, slapped a number of charges against his one-time colleagues and the issue was even raised in the Senate. 

?The allegations have no basis... The chairman (Shaharyar Khan) has already made that clear. However, since I?ve been dragged into the whole thing, I intend calling a Media conference to clear my name,? Rameez told The Telegraph on Sunday. 

He hasn?t done so as yet largely because of very demanding TV commitments, but will do so on returning home after the Champions Trophy. 

Rameez?s successor hasn?t been named, but former diplomat (and friend of Khan) Abbas Zaidi is acting as the chief executive/secretary.

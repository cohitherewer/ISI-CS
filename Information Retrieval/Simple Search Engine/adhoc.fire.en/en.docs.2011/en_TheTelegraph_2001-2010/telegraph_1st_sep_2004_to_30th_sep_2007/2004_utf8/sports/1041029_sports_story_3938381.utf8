The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Bagan peeved at Gaurmangi 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Mohun Bagan are planning to issue a showcause notice to Gaurmangi Singh. The player, through a letter to special officer G.N. Ray which reached the club on Monday, has sought release from the club, where he has signed. 

The player from Manipur, who had taken an advance from Mohun Bagan before signing the inter-state for Dempo, later signed in favour of Bagan. However, he has again changed his decision. 

Incidentally, East Bengal?s Brazilian midfielder Douglas da Silva sent in his reply to the club?s show cause notice on Thursday. A club official has however, ruled out any action against the Brazilian.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Atwal back, but not ?for long?

SUJIT BHAR

 Arjun Atwal 

Calcutta: Back home, Arjun Atwal, who promised not to touch a golf club for a long time after his hectic 30-tourney US PGA Tour engagements throughout the season, will nevertheless be on the fairways at the Royal Calcutta Golf Club Saturday, as part of its 175 th year celebrations, held in association with The Telegraph and presented by Airtel. 

It is a four-ball meet where Arjun will pair with Indrajit Blahotia and Rahil Gangjee will pair with Shiv Kapur. 

While Arjun?s wife Ritika has visited Calcutta several times before, for his son Krishen this will obviously be the first. Arjun flew in from New Delhi (after a relative?s marriage) late Friday night, Ritika and son are expected to join on Sunday. 

Speaking to The Telegraph immediately after landing, Arjun said: ?Two years! It?s a great feeling to be back home after so long. I wish I were staying for a longer period, but I must leave on Wednesday for California and then I have this qualifying school?s final round to go through for a better Tour card.? 

So what about staying off golf? ?Frankly speaking, I did say I would stay off the sport, but a couple of weeks off it and I realised enough was enough and I did a bit of practice in New Delhi for a day on Thursday.? 

It is basically a matter of adjusting and living, for a brief while, with memories. ?Lots of people who I have known for a long time, lots of associations,? he said, pretty emotionally. ?Not long enough a stay, not long. 

?I know I have this event to play at the Royal and I know I have invitations for dinner and all that, but at this point of time I just want to have some good home-cooked food, at home, after a long, long time.?

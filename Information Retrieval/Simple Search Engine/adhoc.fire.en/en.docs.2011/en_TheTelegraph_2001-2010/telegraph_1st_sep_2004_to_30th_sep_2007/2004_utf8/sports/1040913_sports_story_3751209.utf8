The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sport

 Monday, September 13, 2004 

 New Delhi: It was so near yet so far for Sania Mirza as her dream of making it to the Australian Open was ruined after a heartbreaking loss in the women?s singles final of the Asian Tennis Championships in Tashkent on Sunday.

 With the $100,000 event carrying an automatic wild card into the Australian Open main draw for the singles winners, Sania was hoping to become the youngest Indian woman to enter a Grand Slam.

 But those hopes evaporated as she went down 2-6, 1-6 to Na Li of China in the final, according to information received here. The Chinese second seed never allowed the Indian to get into the match to lift her fifth title of the year. 

 Calcutta: Yuki Bhambri, brother of Sanaa and Ankita, will be the top seed in the boys? under-14 category of the Nutrine Naturo sub-junior tennis championships commencing at the BTA Complex on Wednesday, says A Staff Reporter. In girls? under-14, Likitha Devraj of Karnataka will get top billing. Yuki won both the under-12 and under-14 crowns of the Delhi leg last month. There is an added incentive for competitors as both the singles winners of the city leg will be sent to Australia to watch next year?s first Grand Slam event. Hyderabad and Pune have been added in the list of venues.

 Meanwhile, Bengal lass Danielle Jones has been selected in the under-14 Indian contingent to play an Asian Tennis Federation (ATF) meet to be held in Colombo from September 21-25.

 Monza: Renault have denied trying to undermine Italy?s Jarno Trulli since he announced he would be leaving the Formula One team at the end of the season.

 Trulli, winner of the Monaco Grand Prix, told Italian reporters after qualifying ninth for his home race that he suspected some people were playing mind games with him in the hope that he might quit early. ?I think Jarno is suffering from a syndrome,? Sunday?s Gazetta dello Sport quoted team boss Flavio Briatore as saying however. ?What interest could we have in making life difficult for him when we are still fighting for second place in the constructors? championship and we need to get both cars to the finish and among the points?

 Berlin: Tonique Williams-Darling and Christian Olsson crowned memorable seasons by each winning half the million-dollar Golden League jackpot on Sunday. The two athletes, who both won gold medals at the Athens Olympics, made sure of pocketing $500,000 each with victories in the final round of the series in Berlin.

 Toronto: Vincent Lecavalier?s goal 3:45 into overtime earned Canada a nail-biting 4-3 victory over the Czech Republic on Saturday and a place in the final of the World Cup of Hockey. 

 Canada will try to add the World Cup to their Olympic and world championship titles when they take on Finland in Tuesday?s gold-medal game.

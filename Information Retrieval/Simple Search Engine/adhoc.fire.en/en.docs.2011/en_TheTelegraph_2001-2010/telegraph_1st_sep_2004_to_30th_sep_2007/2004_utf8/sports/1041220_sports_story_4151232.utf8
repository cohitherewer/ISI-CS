 Mystery virus bugs Fleming

 Fleming says he?s sleeping too much 

Wellington: New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming said he is suffering from a mystery virus just a week out from his team?s first one-day International against Sri Lanka. ?I?m certainly not able to function to 100 per cent, because I sleep too much,? Fleming was quoted as saying in the Sunday News. 

Fleming?s health became an issue during a recent tour of Australia when he revealed he was battling a mystery illness contracted on the October tour of Bangladesh, but there was no mention of any problem when the squad for the series against Sri Lanka was named last week. 

Doctors have yet to diagnose the illness, but have ruled out malaria. 

?There was enough to say that it was viral fatigue. You?ve just got to take your time and let it work out of your system,? he said. 

Fleming had a forgettable tour of Australia, averaging 24.25 from four Test innings and nought and 34 in two one-dayers. 

He was caught on camera sleeping just before going out to bat during the second Test in Adelaide. Fleming said on the eve of the Australian series the illness had knocked him flat. 

?I just can?t stay awake, I?m sleeping all the time,? he said at the time. ?When I got back I started to feel fatigue-like symptoms and ever since I?ve slowly gone downhill.? (AFP)

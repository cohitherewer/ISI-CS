 Abhishek Yadav?s brace for 

Mahindra went in vain 

Calcutta: Tollygunge Agragami custodian Arindam Ghosh was brilliant under the bar as he saved Bello Rasaq?s penalty in the tie-breaker to carry his team to the quarter finals of the Federation Cup that kicked off in Bangalore on Wednesday. 

Tollygunge overpowered former National League champions Salgaocar 4-1 in the penalty shootout after the teams shared two goals till extra-time. 

According to information received here, the Calcutta side took the lead after 20 minutes when Surojit Bose headed in an Isiaka Awoyemi centre. The Goan outfit equalised through Rasaq 10 minutes before the long whistle. 

There was no addition to the scoreline in the half-hour extra-time and the tie-breaker ensued. 

In the shootout Tariq Ahmed, Suley Musah, Suman Datta and Akeem Abolanle netted for the winners. The Goans converted just one. 

Tollygunge Agragami coach Biswajit Das Tuesday expressed worry that they would have to play under lights. But on the Wednesday, they played their hearts out to secure a win. 

Tollygunge will next play Fransa Football Club of Goa on Sunday. 

Fransa FC produced a huge upset earlier in the day when they knocked out defending champions Mahindra United 3-2, PTI adds from Bangalore. 

Fransa, who were recently promoted to the elite National Football League, began their campaign in a rousing fashion, opening their account through Sebastiao Endro, who found the net from a solo effort. 

Mahindra, who seemed to be struggling with their passing, tried to score, but were unable to break the rival defence. 

The jeepmen managed to find the equaliser in the 43rd minute when star striker Abhishek Yadav bulged the net after intercepting a pass from captain Khalid Jamil. The teams were 1-1 at the break. 

Fransa dominated the proceedings in the second half and enhanced their tally when Jules C. Dias Alberto scored off a free-kick in the 75th minute. 

Mahindra levelled again in the 77th minute, when Abhishek headed home a clean lob from substitute Steven Dias. 

This signalled a battle for supremacy between the two teams, but success came to Fransa in the 84th minute when Peter Rodrigues scored off a pass from Sanjeev Maria. 

The Mumbai outfit made concerted efforts to find the equaliser, but in vain. 

Earlier, Karnataka chief minister N. Dharam Singh inaugurated the tournament. 

Meanwhile, Calcutta side Ever-Ready will face Dempo and Churchill Brothers will meet Vasco in the pre-quarter finals on Thursday.

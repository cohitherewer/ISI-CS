The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Wright will stay till end of season

 - Grey areas in contract sorted out 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 John Wright 

Calcutta: Despite strong indications that John Wright may not continue as Team India coach after the proposed tour of Bangladesh, it?s now confirmed he is at least going to remain till the end of his contract ? April 2005. 

According to The Telegraph?s sources, Wright met Jagmohan Dalmiya, technically (or constitutionally) still the Board of Control for Cricket in India president, in the city on Monday, and the possibility of his early (and permanent) return to New Zealand wasn?t on the agenda. 

Neither Dalmiya nor Wright was available for comment, but one understands some grey areas in the coach?s (fresh) contract ? actually supposed to be effective from after the Champions Trophy ? were sorted out. 

[Significantly, the contract remains to be inked, though.] 

Dalmiya, for his part, will be keeping the ?relevant quarters? informed about his deliberations with the coach. 

Wright was appointed during Dr A.C. Muthiah?s tenure as president, a shade over four years ago, but has dealt with Dalmiya since the 2001 AGM. 

Speculation about Wright?s immediate future surfaced after the 1-2 defeat at the hands of Australia, last month, with the former New Zealand captain telling confidants he ?wouldn?t continue? if the team just couldn?t move towards getting that ?ten per cent? required to climb up. 

Then, on the eve of the recent Test here (versus South Africa), Wright himself went on record to say: ?I want my team improving constantly? If, at any point, I feel I?m not helping achieve that, then someone else can take my place?? 

As has been well documented, Team India won the Test (and series), an effort which took Sourav Ganguly and Co. to a high of No.3 in the ICC rankings. 

Obviously, Wright is convinced the first steps towards that ?ten per cent? have been taken. 

Assuming the trip to Bangladesh is cleared, the seven-week tour by Pakistan ? tentatively slated to begin on February 25 ? is going to be Wright?s biggest assignment before the season ends.

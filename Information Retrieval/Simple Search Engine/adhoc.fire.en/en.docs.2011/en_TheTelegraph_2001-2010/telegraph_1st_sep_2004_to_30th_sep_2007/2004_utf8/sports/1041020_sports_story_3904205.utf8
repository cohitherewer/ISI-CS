The Telegraph - Calcutta

 2-day practice matches proposed

 A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Since the J. P. Atray meet in Chandigarh, the Bengal team has been practising (at the indoor training centre in CAB) only. That too has been hampered by the weather. So, the team thinktank has decided to be among matches as a build-up for Ranji Trophy. 

Two CAB teams have been formed as part of two planned back-to-back 90-over-a-side matches (both two-dayers) at the Jadavpur University ground in Salt Lake from October 26. 

One team will be led by Devang Gandhi while the captain of the other team is likely to be Deep Dasgupta. ?We have planned to do so as we have to be well prepared before the Ranji Trophy gets underway and have tentatively chalked out the teams too,? a source told The Telegraph on Tuesday. 

Rohan Gavaskar and Aniruddha Roy will miss the matches. Rohan is in Mumbai and is expected to be back at the end of the month while Aniruddha is indisposed. The idea, of course, needs the approval of the CAB top brass. 

LIKELY SQUADS 

CAB A (from): Devang Gandhi (captain), Nikhil Haldipur, Rakesh Krishnan, Rahul Dev (wicketkeeper), Subhamoy Das, Sanjib Sanyal, Ritam Kundu, Shib Sagar Singh, Sabir Ali, Ranadeb Bose, Ranabir Nath, Subhajit Paul, Dilip Yadav, Manoj Tewari. 

CAB B (from): Deep Dasgupta (captain), Arindam Das, Anustup Majumdar, Amitava Chakraborty, Mohammed Ziauddin, Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Sourashish Lahiri, Murtaza Lodhgar, Shib Shankar Paul, Sourav Sarkar, Dibyendu Chakraborty, Wriddhiman Saha, Avik Chowdhury, Anirban Chatterjee.

 Sachin more precious than Kohinoor: Sunil Gavaskar

 - ?it?s a moment to be proud of... right from the time I First saw him i knew He was Special? 

Dhaka: Sunil Gavaskar Saturday congratulated Sachin Tendulkar for equalling his world record of 34 Test centuries, saying he was more precious to the Indians than even the Kohinoor and must not stop before 50 centuries. 

?We may not have the Kohinoor but we have Sachin and to us Indians he?s worth far more and even more precious,? Gavaskar said in his congratulatory message to Sachin. He said Sachin once again gave everyone a moment to feel proud to be an Indian. 

?It?s a moment to be proud of as Indians and congratulations are also due to his family and friends who have helped him to be the cricketer and person he is.? 

Recalling the initial days of Sachin?s career, Gavaskar said, ?right from the time when I first saw Sachin play a flick shot wide of mid-on in the nets for Mumbai Ranji probables, I knew that here was a special talent.? 

Gavaskar also appreciated Sachin for enthralling spectators with his impressive knocks. ?Within a year he was playing for India and scoring runs in a manner that belied his age and delighted and excited the spectators. 

?My few weeks in the Indian dressing room as consultant allowed me to get a closer look at the temperament of the players and the way they prepare themselves for the stern battles on the field. 

?Sachin was most impressive that inspite of the huge expectations of him he was always at hand for the other players in the side and the manner in which he made newcomers feel at ease in his company. With millions of Indians I too hope he keeps doing that for years to come,? Gavaskar said. 

Former India captains Polly Umrigar and Dilip Vengsarkar have also lauded Sachin and described it as ?a fantastic feat?. (PTI)

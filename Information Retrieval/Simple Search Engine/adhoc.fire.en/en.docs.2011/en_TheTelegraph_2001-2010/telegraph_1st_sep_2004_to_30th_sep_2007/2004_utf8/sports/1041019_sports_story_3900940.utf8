 NZ?s series of opportunity

Dhaka: New Zealand?s Test series against Bangladesh will be an ideal opportunity for players to regain their confidence before they tour Australia, captain Stephen Fleming said on Monday. 

New Zealand were beaten 0-3 by England in a series earlier this year and embark on a tour of Australia next month after their Test and one-day series against Bangladesh, which begins on Tuesday with the first Test. 

Bangladesh have lost 27 of their 30 Test matches and lost their only two to New Zealand by an innings. 

?It may be a great chance to get back in winning track playing in Bangladesh, we played our last couple of Tests (against England) poorly,? said Fleming on Monday. ?(But) we think a series victory here will develop an atmosphere for our Australia tour.? 

Fleming will return to New Zealand after the two-match Test series, with left-arm spinner Daniel Vettori captaining the side for the three-match one-day series. 

Mashud to lead 

Wicket Keeper Khaled Mashud will lead Bangladesh team in the absence of injured captain Habibul Bashar in first cricket Test against New Zealand starting on Tuesday, officials said on Monday.

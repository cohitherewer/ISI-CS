Calcutta: John Wright feels Indians will have to take the initiative on the final day of the series to try and force a victory. 

?It?s up to us and a good first hour tomorrow will set it up in our favour. The boys are hungry to win this series,? the Indian coach said. 

He felt that any score ?was chaseable? and the fact that India has ?more depth in spin? gives them the advantage on the Eden wicket. 

?We don?t obviously have to chase a big total but time will be a factor,? said Wright. 

Despite being only 66 runs ahead with five wickets in hand, the South Africans are not losing hope. ?Nothing has changed. Our control is better? Whatever happens we?re prepared for it,? said Makhaya Ntini. 

The medium-pacer, who finished with four wickets in the first innings, felt Ray Jennings? presence in the side has led to this sort of attitude. 

?Jennings is this sort of a man? He himself is always upbeat and ensures that the players also feel the same.? 

Ntini felt that in sub continent conditions the ?fourth day of a Test match is always difficult?. After conceding a lead of 106 runs, the South Africans lost quick wickets to Harbhajan Singh and Anil Kumble on a turning wicket. 

Ntini had set up Virender Sehwag?s dismissal with a well directed bouncer on the third day and he was candid about it. ?He was struggling with the short ball and I tried to test him a bit?? 

On the fourth day, too, he was on target, getting the wickets of Irfan Pathan and Anil Kumble. One of his bouncers hit Kumble hard on his right hand. 

Even if he was tired after bowling 12 overs at a stretch on Wednesday, he did not wish to show it. ?If you?re a South African, it?s never tough to ball 12 overs on the trot.? 

Ntini echoed the team?s positive stance. ?Even a lead of 110 will be challenging for India. We are absolutely positive about our chances,? he said. 

Ntini also dismissed the Sehwag factor, saying, ?We dont have any problems with him. 

He may have some problems with us.? 

He even sounded a warning. ?I am prepared to take control on the last day. We will fight even with a low total. 

?Tomorrow is a new day. Today is past. It will be fresh business,? he added, hoping the remaining batsmen will make things tougher for the Indians.

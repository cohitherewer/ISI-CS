The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Bhupathi to pair with Woodbridge 

 - 2005 ATP Tour 

- Paes in search of a new partner 

AMITAVA DAS GUPTA

No Lee-Hesh reunion in 2005 

Calcutta: It?s official now. There won?t be another Leander Paes-Mahesh Bhupathi reunion, not at least in 2005. Both, however, will have new partners on the ATP Tour. 

Come January, Bhupathi will team up with the high-profile Aussie Todd Woodbridge. Paes is still in the process of finalising David Rikl?s replacement. 

?Todd and I will be together for the whole year, including the four Grand Slams,? Bhupathi told The Telegraph from New York where he is holidaying with wife Shweta. 

?Todd?s a great doubles player, his record speaks for itself? I?m really looking forward to this new association. He plays the right court, that suits me perfectly as I don?t have to adjust,? Bhupathi said. 

Woodbridge, the younger half of the legendary ?Woodies? team, has a record 82 doubles crown including 16 in Grand Slams. Even after Mark Woodforde retired at the end of 2000, Woodbridge continued his exploits with Swede Jonas Bjorkman. Now he will seek to continue that consistency with the accomplished Indian. 

Bhupathi?s hunt for a new partner began the day Mirnyi informed the Indian that he wasn?t keen on playing doubles regularly any more. Bhupathi?s first choice was one-time partner Leander Paes, especially after the two won their comeback Tour meet just before the Athens Olympics. 

?I brought up the issue in Athens and later in Bangkok, but he (Paes) was keen on continuing with Rikl,? Bhupathi said. 

Paes offered his explanation for turning down Bhupathi?s request: ?He did ask me if I was willing, but it was too premature at that time to decide on 2005? David and I were playing very well together and even reached the US Open final. I didn?t want to discontinue that partnership.? 

But Paes was forced on a rethink after Rikl decided recently that he wouldn?t play more than 16 weeks next year. ?That?s too few for the year? I decided then that I?d look for a fresh partner,? said the Davis Cup captain, who landed in the city Saturday afternoon to take part in the 175th year celebrations of the Royal Calcutta Golf Club. 

Paes has shortlisted ?a few? candidates. ?I am looking for someone who?s two-three years younger, one who plays a bit of singles also.? 

Despite the fact that he and Rikl failed to qualify for the year-end Masters Cup in Houston, Paes is satisfied with his form and fitness. ?I?m extremely pleased with the way I turned things around this year? I can tell you I?ve not been in better shape in quite some years.?

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Liverpool end winless streak 

London: Liverpool ended a run of three Premier League games without victory when they came from behind to beat Newcastle United 3-1 at Anfield on Sunday. 

The traditionally high-scoring fixture started quietly before bursting into life with three goals in a six-minute spell near the end of the first half. 

Patrick Kluivert fired Newcastle ahead from close range after 32 minutes, only for a Titus Bramble own goal and a clinical finish by forward Neil Mellor to swing the game in Liverpool?s favour.

 Fitness to be scanned today 

Chennai: Sachin Tendulkar?s fitness level will be assessed by a team of experts including Team India physio Andrew Leipus and trainer Gregory King in Mumbai on Wednesday. 

Sachin, racing against time to be fit for the third Test against Australia following an elbow injury, had a two-hour practice session on Tuesday morning in Mumbai and was said to be progressing well. 

Apart from King and Leipus, coach John Wright will also be present when Sachin?s fitness is assessed by the experts, according to the BCCI sources. 

The support staff left for Mumbai on Tuesday evening. 

The BCCI made it clear on Monday that Sachin would be named as a 15th man in the squad after the fitness test. 

Meanwhile in Mumbai, Sachin also said it was too early to state whether he would be fully fit ahead of the third Test starting October 26. 

?I have started using a lighter bat, but it is too early to say when I will be back,? he said after practising at the MIG Club. He came to the ground at about 6 am. 

?I am taking it step by step but I have to take the final step. I am feeling much better. But the doctor has said that this injury is such that it will take time to heal,? Sachin later said at the launch of sport cafe ?Sachin?s? at Mulund in north Mumbai. 

It was learnt that Sachin bowled a bit and also indulged in some fielding drills at the MIG Club ground, close to where he grew up as a young boy.

New Delhi: Legendary allrounder Ian Botham on Sunday held ?poor wickets? responsible for India?s pathetic batting display in the Test series against Australia and said such tracks were making the famed batting line-up frustrated. 

?The Indians have a very good batting line-up. Batting is their strength, but batsmen are frustrated by playing on poor wickets,? Botham, here to participate in the Legends? Cup golf tournament, said. 

 The former England player also 

 termed as ?confusing? the ICC?s decision to allow Sourav 

 Ganguly to play in the first Test against South Africa. 

 ?The ICC has a very confusing set of rules,? he said.(PTI)

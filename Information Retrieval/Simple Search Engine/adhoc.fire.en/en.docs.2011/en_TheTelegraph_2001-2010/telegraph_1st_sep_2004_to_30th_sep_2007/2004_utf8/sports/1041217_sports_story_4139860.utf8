The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Bengal?s third defeat in a row

A STAFF REPORTER

 Ranadeb?s efforts not enough 

Calcutta: Y. Gnaneswara Rao struck a fine 63 and guided Andhra Pradesh to a four-wicket win over Bengal in their Ranji Trophy Elite Group A match in Visakhapatnam on Thursday. 

Chasing 190 to win, the hosts achieved the target in 53.2 overs and bagged four crucial points, according to information received here. 

L.N.P. Reddy (49) and Y. Venugopal Rao (30 not out) were the other two major contributors for the hosts. Bengal medium-pacer Ranadeb Bose raised hopes, claiming three wickets and reducing the hosts to 143 for five, but R.V.C. Prasad and Venugopal took Andhra to their maiden win of the season. 

Earlier, Bengal?s second innings folded up without the addition of a single run. They were 144 for eight overnight. 

Bengal, who had bundled out the hosts for just 188 in the first essay, failed to capitalise on the first innings lead of 46 runs and came a cropper in their second innings. 

This was Bengal?s third defeat in a row. Earlier, they had lost to Gujarat and Mumbai, both at home.

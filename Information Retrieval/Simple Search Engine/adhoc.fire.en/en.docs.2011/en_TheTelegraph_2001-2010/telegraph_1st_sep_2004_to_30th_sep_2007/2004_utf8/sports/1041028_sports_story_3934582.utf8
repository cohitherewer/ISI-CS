London: The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has given the green light to England?s tour of Zimbabwe next month after expressing satisfaction with safety and security measures in the troubled African country. 

ECB chairman David Morgan said in a statement the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and also the British Embassy in the Zimbabwe capital Harare, would help monitor the on-going situation until the end of the tour. 

?We have satisfied ourselves that appropriate safety and security measures will be in place to protect the England touring party and officials,? Morgan said on Wednesday.

 Moin confident of a strong comeback

Islamabad: His place in the team may be under threat but an out-of-form Pakistan wicketkeeper Moin Khan is confident of making a strong comeback for the next two games of the ongoing triangular cricket series against Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe. 

Moin missed the last two games against Zimbabwe and Sri Lanka due to a chest infection and coach Bob Woolmer opted to give the gloves to batsman Younis Khan instead of trying out a specialist keeper. 

?Look, Younis is not a regular wicketkeeper and he was called up since I was ill. I don?t feel threatened by him and I am confident I will make a strong comeback in the last two games against Sri Lanka,? Moin said in The News. ?I am better now after taking antibiotics. Hopefully everything will settle down once I come back,? he added. (PTI)

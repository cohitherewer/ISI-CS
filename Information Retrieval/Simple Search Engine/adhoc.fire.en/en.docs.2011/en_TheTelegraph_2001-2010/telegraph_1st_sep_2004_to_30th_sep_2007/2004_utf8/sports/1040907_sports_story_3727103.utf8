New York: Hes got the same name as his famous father. Hes also got a lot of athletic ability. Only this Sergei Bubka is hoping to raise himself up with a tennis racket, rather than a fibre glass pole. 

Son of the 1988 Olympic champion and world record-holder in Pole Vault, Bubka made his US Open debut on Sunday in the junior championship. He lost in singles to Scott Oudsema of the US 4-6, 6-3, 6-2. He is still in the doubles event. Everything was working in the first set, Bubka said. The second set, I got a little more defensive. I think that carried through for the rest of the match. 

Chances are, hell hear from dad about that. 

He gives me mental tips, the 17-year-old Bubka said. Thats where he helps the most. Hell talk about doing everything to perfection, about always doing your best. 

Born in Ukraine, Bubka and his family live in Monte Carlo. His 40-year-old father has seen him only once this year, at a tournament in Italy. Hes very supportive, but he lets me do my own thing, the son said. He doesnt want to get in my way. 

Occasionally, they hit tennis balls together. Dad took up the sport after retiring following his sixth world title in the pole vault. He plays for fun. Hes all right for an amateur, young Bubka said. 

Bubka reached the semi-finals of the 2003 Wimbledon junior event, and has also twice played juniors at the Australian Open. This was his first visit to New York Its pretty big and hes already looking forward to playing at Flushing Meadow next year.Bubkas father dominated pole vaulting for more than a decade. His indoor record of 6.15m set in 1993, still stands; his outdoor mark of 6.14, done in 1994, also remains the record.There never was much chance that his son would scale those heights. I tried it once when I was young, after I had started playing tennis, Bubka said. It was pretty tough. I made it over the bar. But it wasnt very high. The pole didnt even bend. 

Good service 

 At only 17, Scoville Jenkins of the US got a rude 

welcome to the US Open a few days ago when Andy Roddick overwhelmed him with a 

tournament-record 152 mph (244 kph) serve. 

Jenkins played more at his own speed on Sunday when he won his first round at the Opens junior tournament. 

I saw the fastest serve probably that any man can hit, Jenkins said. Now I feel like I could hit any serve. 

Roddick whipped 12 aces past Scoville. Asked that day how it felt to return a 152-mph (244-kph) rocket, Jenkins smiled. 

I dont know, he said. I didnt return it. 

Jenkins reached the semifinals of the junior event at Wimbledon, and was seeded 10th at this tournament.

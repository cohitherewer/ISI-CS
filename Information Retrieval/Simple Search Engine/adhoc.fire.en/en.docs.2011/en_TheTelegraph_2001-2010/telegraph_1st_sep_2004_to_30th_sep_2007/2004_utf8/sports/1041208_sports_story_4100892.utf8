The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Why wasn?t Pal red-carded, asks Bhaskar Ganguly

 - Subrata did himself no justice by targeting the man and not the ball: Dora 

A STAFF REPORTER

 The AIFF?s decision to suspend him is uncalled for, feels Bhaskar 

Calcutta: The goalkeeping fraternity is divided 

in their opinion about Mohun Bagan?s Subrata Pal. 

While some feel he went for the man (Cristiano Junior) 

and not the ball, others say that the AIFF has to look into it that the ban doesn?t 

jeopardise his career. 

The Telegraph spoke to former stalwarts as 

also current stars. Here goes: 

CHINMOY BANERJEE (Mohammedan Sporting goalie):It 

just happened. Of course, Subrata wasn?t out there to cause another player?s death. 

It?s wrong to entirely put the blame on him. 

There can be some penalty but not at the cost of his 

career. 

TARUN BOSE (former India star):I cannot comment 

on the incident since I did not see it. 

But on what basis have they decided to suspend Subrata? 

Has the AIFF gone through the referee?s report? What does the police investigation 

say? These questions should have cleared first before taking action against the 

goalkeeper. 

HEMANTA DORA (former international):Junior 

was barely a few yards away from Subrata and still he did not target the ball. 

Rather, he went for the Brazilian. In case he aimed at the ball, his body would 

have moved towards the right rather than going straight. He just didn?t see the 

ball. 

Maybe it was intentional, maybe it was not. Subrata?s actions, of course, weren?t ideal. 

The suspension is entirely AIFF?s decision. Subrata?s 

did himself no justice by targeting the man and not the ball. 

BHASKAR GANGULY (former India captain):The 

first goal was the result of a lapse on the part of Subrata. During the second 

goal, he charged out desperately anticipating Junior to shoot over his head. 

However, he misjudged the bounce of the ball making things easier for the Brazilian. It?s sad that Subrata failed to keep his speed in check and rammed into Junior. 

Technically, if Subrata had gone for the ball, then the collision could have been avoided. I believe he had no bad intentions, only his inexperience was evident in not targeting the ball. With both players in motion, the impact was severe. What happened thereafter is unfortunate. 

The AIFF?s decision to suspend him is uncalled for. They should have first suspended the referee. 

Why didn?t the referee show Subrata the red card? 

The ban won?t be good for the game, an even bad example for goalkeepers. They 

will now have to think twice, in a body contact game like football, before making 

a charge on a player. My sympathies are with Subrata. 

SANGRAM MUKHERJEE (East Bengal captain): It 

was an accident. I think he went for the ball, but ended up clashing with the 

player. It?s unfortunate.

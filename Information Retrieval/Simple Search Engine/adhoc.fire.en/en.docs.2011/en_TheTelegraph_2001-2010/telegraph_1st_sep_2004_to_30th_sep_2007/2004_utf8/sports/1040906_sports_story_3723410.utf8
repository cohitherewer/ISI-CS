 Sasikiran loses to Sutovsky

Pune: Grandmaster Emil Sutovsky of Israel emerged as sole leader with a clinical victory over top-rated Indian GM Krishnan Sasikiran in the third round of the Super Grandmasters chess tournament here on Sunday. 

Sutovsky took his tally to an impressive 2.5 points out of a possible three and is now a half point clear of nearest rivals top seed Liviu-Dieter Nisipeanu of Romania, world champion Rustam Kasimdzhanov of Uzbekistan, P. Harikrishna and Sandipan Chanda who all have two points each. 

With six rounds remaining in this category-16 tournament being played as part of the Pune International Chess Festival, GM Zurab Azmaiparashvili of Georgia occupies the next spot with a 50 per cent score while veteran GM Alexander Beliavsky of Slovenia and Sasikiran follow them with one point each. 

Luck continued to desert Surya Shekhar Ganguly and he now shares the last spot with fellow GM Abhijit Kunte, who opened his account in this round.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 United hope to turn the tide

London: Alex Ferguson will turn to Argentinian defender Gabriel Heinze in an effort to solve a Manchester United injury crisis threatening to blow a hole in United?s title chase. 

Heinze, 26, hasn?t kicked a ball for his new club since signing from Paris Saint Germain in the summer and has drawn the wrath of Ferguson after turning out for Argentina in the Copa America and the Olympics. 

He then went back to South America to play a World Cup qualifier against Peru last weekend. But he is in line to make his United debut in Saturday?s Premiership clash at Bolton as United look to recover from a miserable start to the season. Currently languishing at ninth place in the table, United are seven points behind rivals Arsenal and Chelsea, who occupy the top two spots with perfect records. 

Ferguson is already without John O?Shea, while Gary Neville and Louis Saha both limped out of midweek World Cup qualifiers. Wes Brown is still sidelined, while Rio Ferdinand?s eight-month suspension still has a week to run. 

?My situation isn?t easy,? said Heinze. ?United?s directors are a bit annoyed, but I always did what I felt was correct. Some people say I did the right thing, others say I didn?t. But I?m never going to say ?no? to Argentina,? Heinze said. ?I?m going to show I can shine in the Premiership. I can?t wait to play for United,? he added. 

Champions Arsenal go to London rivals Fulham who are yet to beat the Gunners in six attempts in the top flight ? the best they have to show was a draw in last season?s Highbury encounter. Furthermore, Arsenal haven?t lost a Premiership London derby since November 2001 ? a run of 25 games without defeat against other clubs from the capital. 

Sol Campbell and Jeremie Aliadiere are still unavailable.

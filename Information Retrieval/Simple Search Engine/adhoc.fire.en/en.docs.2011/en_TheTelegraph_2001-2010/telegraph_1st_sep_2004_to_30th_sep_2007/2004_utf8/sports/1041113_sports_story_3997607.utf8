 Double-gold Kelly is on a mission 

 - Olympic champion coaching future stars in South Africa 

Tom Knight in Potchefstroom 

 Holmes is loving every moment away from the limelight 

Watching Kelly Holmes direct operations at her own training camp here in Potchefstroom, it is easy to see why she has made no plans for her future on the track. Forget the celebrity lifestyle, the gala invitations and the rich commercial pickings at home, Britain?s double Olympic champion is totally immersed in a project close to her heart and loving every minute away from the limelight. 

She can spare a thought for Paula Radcliffe?s New York Marathon comeback, for her former training partner, Maria Mutola, and even her own athletics career ? but it is only a thought. Holmes? preoccupation is making sure that the training camp for some of Britain and South Africa?s finest young women middle-distance runners, in this university town, 75 miles south-west of Johannesburg, is a success. She said: ?Everything at home has been mad and has been rather fun. But this is what I enjoy and the other stuff can wait. It will carry on the moment I get back, anyway.? 

Seeing Holmes at work is a revelation. For years, the impression ? in public at least ? was that she lurched from crisis to crisis in a sort of haphazard way. Injuries and medals came and went without her ever appearing satisfied with her achievements, considerable though they were. 

Only after her double triumph in Athens and, latterly, after watching her marshalling her young charges in the heat did the true picture emerge. For close on 11 years, Holmes was chasing a dream and trying every conceivable formula in a desperate attempt to make it come true. The dream came true in Athens ? not once but twice and it is the lessons of that journey that Holmes is passing on to the youngsters here. She does it in the military style she learnt as a sergeant with the Adjutant General?s Corps in the British Army. 

Her addresses to the troops are eloquent and engaging and, in the style of an army exercise, she controls all the information given out. After two and a half weeks, she even has the athletes on a constant state of alert for any number of new and exciting challenges. There is, for example, the ongoing tuition in getting used to new surroundings. The 20 young women at the camp sleep in four rooms in two rented houses. The rooms have been named USA, Wales, China and Russia and each has different characteristics. 

The USA room, for example, has an en-suite bathroom while Russia has limited facilities and no wardrobe space. At a moment?s notice, Holmes has directed the women to pack their bags and change rooms. She said: ?It?s about teaching them to get used to feeling uncomfortable and having to live out of a suitcase, which is what happens on the athletics circuit. You constantly have to share rooms with ?strangers and not let it affect your performance.? 

Given her army background, this is easy stuff for Holmes but it?s all part of giving the youngsters an insight into what life will be like if they succeed in becoming international athletes. ?It is not a glamorous sport,? she said. ?It can be very lonely because, most of the time, you are on your own. Even this year, I was on my own a lot. But I had a purpose. I wanted to achieve something and nothing was going to distract me, no matter what. The fact that I had been in the army probably helped me. It?s where I think I have an advantage over these girls because I was in there from when I was 17 and I had to learn a lot about myself and grow up very quickly. 

?Going away with other athletes was not a big deal because being in the army was a much bigger deal. I hope I am giving these athletes an insight into things.? 

It is not as if the training camp, in a town she discovered when she raced at the Puk McArthur Stadium in 1996, was inspired by Holmes? gold medals. This is something she dreamt up in January. Sponsorship from Norwich Union made it happen and Holmes has stuck by her plan despite all the temptations to pursue other opportunities at home. 

She clearly revels in the responsibility and, after so many years spent chasing her individual goals, is relishing the chance to put her army training to use for a greater good. Between training sessions, in which the athletes follow programmes set by their own coaches, there are lectures from experts on nutrition and eating disorders, blood testing, the anti-doping rules and the dangers of supplements and the importance of preventative physiotherapy and massage, something Holmes had to learn the hard way. 

Perhaps the most interesting series of lectures have been on motivation and self-awareness. It is not something that the average 15-year-old tends to have to deal with and yet Non Stanford, from Swansea Harriers, has taken it in her stride. The youngest in the group, Stanford represented Wales as a gymnast when she was nine and last year became the first Welsh athlete to win a British age-group title at the Inter-Counties Cross-Country Championships. 

Like Charlotte Browning, Danielle Christmas, Joanne Finch, Laura Finucane, Jo Harper, Rachael Thompson and Danielle Walker, she was selected by Holmes to come to the camp. Stanford, who was given three weeks? leave by St Joseph?s RC School in Port Talbot, said: ?It has been hard work and no one can go away saying it has been a waste of time because we have learnt so much from Kelly about racing, training, preparation and a lot about ourselves and what we can deal with as people.? 

Holmes wants to organise more camps and has an eye on inviting a group of Britain?s young male athletes out to South Africa. She said: ?I?ve been honest and told the girls that not all of them will make it. But I?m not a coach, just a supporting pathway and I?ll have no impact on whether they will go on and win gold at the Olympic Games in Beijing or, hopefully, London in 2012.

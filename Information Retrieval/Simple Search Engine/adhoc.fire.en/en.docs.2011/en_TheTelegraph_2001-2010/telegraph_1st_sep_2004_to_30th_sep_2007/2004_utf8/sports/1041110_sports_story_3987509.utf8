 Kaluwitharana calls it a day

Colombo: Sri Lanka wicketkeeper Romesh Kaluwitharana has retired from international cricket after missing out on selection for a training squad for next month?s tour of New Zealand. 

Kaluwitharana has been dropped many times previously but with his 35th birthday fast approaching is now determined to hang up his boots for good. ?I have decided to call it a day having not been selected for New Zealand,? Kaluwitharana said on Tuesday. 

?I started my Test career on a high note with a century against Australia and I?m happy to end it with a half century against Pakistan.?

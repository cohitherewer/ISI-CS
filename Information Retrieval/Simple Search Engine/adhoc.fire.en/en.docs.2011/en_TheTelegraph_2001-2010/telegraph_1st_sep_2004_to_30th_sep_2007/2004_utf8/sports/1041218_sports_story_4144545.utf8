 Elistano may come good in Gold Cup 

 STAR RACER

 Shanker

 Calcutta: Favourites may again find the going tough in Saturday?s eight-event race card ? sponsored by Eveready Industries. It is because, some of the promising youngsters are being experimented over trips they may not find tailormade for their liking. For instance, Anzello and Exclusive Affair are better suited over sprints but they are being exploited over middle distances. However, they possess lot of class but it may not come as a surprise if they fail.

 The likes of Elistanos and Thrilling Proposals are, however, expected to deliver the goods comfortably in their respective events ? the 1,600m Eveready Calcutta Gold Cup and the Eveready Recharge Cup over 1,200 metres. In their clash early in the season, both Elistano and Trilling Proposal had stretched Moon Emperor who went on to win the 2,000 Guineas.

 The Telegraph Cup, a baby race, may see Aptitude and La Scala disputing the issue. Both horses have been through rigorous preparations but La Scala looks a better proposition. Elistano, Thrilling Proposal and La Scala ? all three will be ridden by S. Shanker.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

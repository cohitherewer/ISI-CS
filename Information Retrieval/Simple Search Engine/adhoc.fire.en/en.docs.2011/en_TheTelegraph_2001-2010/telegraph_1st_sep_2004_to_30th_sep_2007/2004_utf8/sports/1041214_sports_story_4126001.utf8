 Defensive tactics not working for us

 - Both India and Pakistan are struggling in defence and strike power 

PARGAT SINGH

 Adrian D? Souza failed to make an impact 

The Indian team raised hopes only to dash them once again. They got into early lead but then gave it all away with a defensive approach that is becoming hard to understand in a team that is capable of playing flowing hockey. 

The trademark of the sub-continental game from India and Pakistan is smooth, aggressive and attacking. And that is precisely what India is not playing right now. They have forgotten their own strengths and are falling back all too often, and unnecessarly at that. 

The net result of this was a 2-3 defeat in the bronze medal play-off match against Pakistan on Sunday. This was the third successive time that Pakistan had beaten India in a bronze medal match at the Champions Trophy. 

The final was won by Spain who stunned a somewhat over-confident Dutch side and halted their march to a hattrick of titles. 

Both Spain and Holland are playing wonderful hockey and have shown great preparation with an eye on the long term, like the 2006 World Cup and the 2008 Olympics. 

While one tries to figure out what is wrong with Indian hockey at this stage, one also needs to emphasise that Pakistan too are having problems in becoming a world-beating side. 

At the same time, however, Pakistan are sticking to basics ? of flowing hockey and attacking. Sure they are conceding goals, but they are also scoring a lot. 

One must admit that the Indians are severely lacking forwards, and, worse, we are playing with just three or four forwards whose firepower in any case is rather weak. 

The Indians are missing too many chances upfront, and then leaving too many gaps in the rear. So, the defensive tactics are clearly not wor-king for us. 

When a new coach comes to take care of the team, there is always this gestation period, and he needs time to settle down and understand the nature of hockey the boys play and are capable of. So, surely, the team management has by now realised that Indians are always vulnerable when they go on the defensive. 

Time and again, we have seen that Indian teams are unable to hold on to the lead when they go on the back foot. Add to that the inability to score and we have a lot of problems on hand. 

It is easy use the excuse that this is a young team that is being built up for the future. But that is what everyone has been saying for a long time. Each time a new coaching set-up comes, that is what we get to hear. 

Many of the players from this team will be representing India at the junior World Cup next year. And when these players, who have now been asked to play defensive hockey, combine with other juniors, who are playing attacking hockey, we will once again have a lot of problems as there will be a clash of styles within the same team. 

Whatever kind of hockey a country plays, it has to be similar in nature across all age groups, the juniors and the seniors. Simply because it is the juniors who are expected to fill in the shoes of the senior team when the time comes. 

Coming back to the bronze match, Sandeep Singh scored both goals for India while Sohail Abbas, Rehan Butt and Mudassar Ali Khan struck for Pakistan. 

Pakistan conceded the first goal because of a lapse in defence as they gave away a pen-alty corner, which Sandeep converted. 

But Pakistan got back the goal through Sohail soon after. Goalkeeper Adrian D?Souza was said to have recovered fr-om his hamstring injury and was brought back into the ga-me, but he was more subdued and not as effective as in the previous matches. 

Though there were glimp-ses of vintage Indo-Pak hockey, the fact of the matter is that both teams are struggling in defence and strike-power. They are missing chances and allowing too many gaps at the back. 

The Indian defence conceded seven penalty corners in the match. However, Abbas could not manage more than one, and Mudassar converted one towards the end, so they also missed many chances. India, on the other hand, scor-ed twice through set pieces, but wasted many other chan-ces. 

One word about that brilliant goal by Butt. He showed remarkable presence of mind and speed while connecting a rising and powerful cross from Shakeel Abbasi and deflecting it in. 

Also, there was the news that Sohail Abbas was calling it a day. Maybe he feels with the next Asian Games two years away and Olympics four years from now, he may not last it. Anyway going out at the top is better than being sent out unceremoniously as many senior and good talented players have learnt in the Indian sub-continent. Now, with no major big event slated for seniors in the near future, it is time for the hockey officialdom to sit down and chalk out a road map for the future. (PTI)

 London: Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has extended his contract at the English champions until May 2008. Wenger, 55, arrived at Highbury in 1996 and has led the London side to three league titles in 1998, 2002 and 2004. His contract was due to run out at the end of this season.

 ?My intention has always been clear,? the Frenchman told the clubs website. ?I love this club and I am very happy here.? Wenger?s decision means he will be in charge when the club move into a new 60,000-seater stadium in 2006 and it will dampen regular speculation linking him with Real Madrid.

 London: Brazilian Socrates is to pull on the famous yellow jersey once more, but this time it will not be for the five-time World Cup winners but for a non-league English team.

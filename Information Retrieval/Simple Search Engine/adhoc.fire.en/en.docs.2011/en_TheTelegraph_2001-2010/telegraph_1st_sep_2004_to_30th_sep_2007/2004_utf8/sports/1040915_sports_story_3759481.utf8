The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Life ban on six Bagan members

 - DRUNKEN BRAWL FALLOUT 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: The six Mohun Bagan members, who landed in the lock-up after being involved in a drunken brawl at the CCFC on Sunday, have been suspended for life. The seventh person to be picked up by police that night is not a member of the club. 

Announcing this after a meeting of the executive committee Tuesday evening, secretary Anjan Mitra said he had been empowered by the members to take further steps if some other members are found guilty of misconduct. 

It was, actually, a unilateral decision of the secretary?s. He had dispatched suspension letters to all six members in the morning only. The evening?s meeting was called only to inform the executives of his decision. 

The rival camp in the faction-ridden club ? headed by assistant secretary Balaram Chowdhury ? couldn?t raise a voice against Mitra?s decision, as the club constitution does permit the secretary to act in such a manner. 

But that didn?t mean Chowdhury?s group sat ?idle?. He, along with five of his associates ? all members of the executive committee ? did come for the meeting before walking out. They protested the presence of seven co-opted members as a court case ? challenging the validity of their status ? is on. With the secretary refusing to oblige Chowdhury, he and his men refused to attend the meeting. 

Chowdhury, who had his own press conference before leaving the club tent, said he was going ahead with the inquiry into Sunday?s shameful incident. 

?The secretary has already taken a decision but since I?m answerable to the special officers, I have to find out what happened exactly.? BOA president B.K. Saha, a former police commissioner, has been entrusted with the responsibility of looking into the episode. 

Mitra, for his part, took a dig at Chowdhury. ?We are writing a letter to the special officers pointing out that some worthless people are looking after the club?s football affairs.?

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Flight fiasco delays Chennai trio 

OUR STAFF REPORTERS

Calcutta: India wicketkeeper Dinesh Karthik, 

batsman S. Sriram and computer analyst S. Ramakrishnan reached the city on Thursday 

evening following a flight fiasco. 

The three, on their way from Chennai, were booked on a morning Sahara Airlines flight. A technical problem led to a change of aircraft at the last minute and despite holding confirmed tickets, they could not be accommodated. The airline officials then offered two confirmed seats to the three passengers. 

The proposal took them by surprise as they were travelling together. In the midst of all this, the flight took off and they were left stranded. Later, they were offered another afternoon Sahara flight to Calcutta, via Bangalore. 

They refused and preferred a direct Indian Airlines evening flight out of Chennai. It is ironic that Sahara are the sponsors of Team India. 

Incidentally, this was conveyed to The Telegraph 

by one of the stranded trio. 

Coach John Wright, physio Andrew Leipus and trainer Gregory King also arrived in the evening since seats were not available on the morning flight from Mumbai. 

Virender Sehwag, Mohammed Kaif, Yuvraj Singh and Ashish Nehra also checked into the team hotel late in the evening. 

Meanwhile, Lok Sabha speaker Somnath Chatterjee will present the Platinum Jubilee Cup to the winners at Eden Gardens on Saturday. 

Sports minister Sunil Dutt will be present during the match and will give away the mementoes to the former India and Pakistan captains, Platinum Jubilee committee chairman Jagmohan Dalmiya informed. 

Plans to hold the fireworks exhibition on the field 

had to be scrapped because court permission couldn?t be obtained.

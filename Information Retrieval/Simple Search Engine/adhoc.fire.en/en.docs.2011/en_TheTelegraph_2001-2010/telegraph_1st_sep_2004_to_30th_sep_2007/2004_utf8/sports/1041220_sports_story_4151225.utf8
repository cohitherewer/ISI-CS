 - First Test vs ENGLAND 

 Ntini after taking one of his three wickets Sunday 

Port Elizabeth: Makhaya Ntini inspired a middle-order collapse to dismiss England for 425 in response to South Africa?s 337 on the third day of the first Test on Sunday. 

At stumps, South Africa were 99 for two in their second innings, a lead of 11 runs, with captain Graeme Smith unbeaten on 33 and Jacques Kallis on 10 not out. 

England, who began the day at 227 for one, lost four wickets for 12 runs within 15 balls just before tea. 

Ntini was the chief destroyer in that period, dismissing Andrew Flintoff and Geraint Jones with consecutive deliveries before he finished with three for 75. 

Mark Butcher (79) and Flintoff (35) steadied England with a fifth-wicket stand of 79 before Butcher was caught behind. (REUTERS)

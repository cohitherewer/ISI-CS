 Finally, a law favouring bowlers

 - No more ?pie throwers? in England now, but ?pie deliverers? 

SIMON HUGHES 

 It needed a Murali to put common sense and science together 

Eureka! The International Cricket Council (ICC) has confirmed what many people knew all along: that virtually all bowlers bend their arm in delivery. 

Stringent scientific tests concluded that if the current bowling laws were applied rigorously, most leading practitioners would be banned. Legions of bowlers would be holed up in some lab undergoing remedial work on their actions. Happily, the old and rather unwieldy legislation has got the elbow. 

The new leniency is a huge shot in the arm for the bowling brotherhood. Most law-tinkering favours batsmen, from restrictions in the number of bouncers or fielders permitted on the boundary, to penalties for running on the pitch or fiddling with the seam. Here at last is a ruling that favours the second-class citizens of the game (of which I admit I was one). 

The official tolerance of 15 degrees of flex in a bowler?s delivery arm will banish most, if not all, of those malicious whispers suggesting someone looks as if he ?pings it? and the anxieties of many trundlers shackled by the aura of suspicion. The Australian assertion that all English bowlers are ?pie throwers? will have to be amended to ?pie deliverers?. 

Muttiah Muralidharan will have poured himself a large measure of Sri Lankan arrack at the news, but he will not be the only one feeling exonerated. Players such as Shoaib Akhtar, a natural showman reduced to introversion and soul searching when he was first sidelined for having an ?illegal? action, and Brett Lee, who had to undergo a degree of ?remodelling?, will feel a sense of indignation that the decision wasn?t made several years ago. 

The throwing law was always an ass. Unleashing a 90mph lump of leather with a perfectly straight arm is practically impossible. 

In my own fast-bowling days I felt the same. It wasn?t deliberate, but you could sense an extra kink in your elbow when you really let one go. But to penalise someone for the occasional slight transgression would be impractical ? like expecting the motorist to pay a fine every time the needle nudges past 70mph. 

Those working in television, watching in super slow-motion, soon realised there were obvious amounts of bend or whip in some bowlers? actions ? Glenn McGrath was one who raised eyebrows, Andrew Hall another. But we were loath to highlight it knowing it would become a contentious issue and possibly jeopardise the player?s career. 

The introduction of degrees of tolerance just caused confusion. How could you measure if an arm bent four degrees or eight? Why were spinners allowed less flex (five degrees) than fast bowlers (10) when spinners often needed more leverage to get proper purchase on the ball? The advent of Muralidharan, with his complex wrist action and elbow deformity, underlined how difficult the matter is to police. 

Science, allied to a dose of common sense, has supplied the solution. Let all bowlers have a bit more scope. Not too much ? we don?t, after all, want them to evolve into Roger Clemens, the Houston Astros? legendary pitcher ? but enough. The ICC decision is welcome and long overdue. Now we can get on with the game. And dismissed batsmen will be obliged to come up with a better excuse than ?Jeez, he must have pinged that one?.

New Delhi: Kerala annexed the 59th Indian Oil Corporation (IOC)-Santosh Trophy on Sunday. In what could have been a lost case after Kerala?s Lenal Thomas missed a penalty, they finally beat Punjab 3-2 to claim their fifth Santosh Trophy. 

Incidentally, their last victory in the finals in Mumbai three years ago was by an identical margin. Their opponent, that time being Goa. While, Abdul Hakeem scored the golden goal in the previous win, this time it was Man-of-the-Match Sylvestor Ignatius, who turned away from his marker and scored with an angular rising left-footer. The award carried with it a cash prize of Rs 10,000. 

The winner came two minutes into the second half of extra-time and Kerala played out the remaining duration without much anxiety. For Punjab it was a bridge too far. Fatigue took its toll, as Punjab played their second match in three days that had run into extra-time. 

History, in more cases than one, repeated itself on the day. The 3-2 scoreline seem to be Kerala?s favourite. They won their first-ever Santosh Trophy in Ernakulam in 1973 beating Railways 3-2 in the final. Of the five times that Kerala have won the tournament, thrice this was the scoreline. Moreover, when Kerala first won the Santosh Trophy, the late Ikram-ul Haq, a Fifa referee from Delhi had supervised the match. Thirty one years later, Ikram?s son Rizwan-ul Haq, also a Fifa referee, did duty in Sunday?s match. 

Kerala dominated initially with their slick, angular passing and clever support play. In the sixth minute, Punjab suffered a setback when experienced right-back Tapan Bhattacharya twisted his ankle in a tackle and had to be carried off. 

Two minutes on the southern state took a fortuitous lead. Punjab goalkeeper Kameshwar Singh, while attempting top stop Bijesh Ben?s curling right footer, stepped over the goalline under pressure from Kerala strikers. Referee Rizwan and assistant referee Arjunan promptly awarded a goal. 

Punjab protested, but Rizwan, a stickler for rules, did not relent. Punjab resorted to long ball tactics and pace. But Kerala?s back four held firm. Central defender M. Abdul Basheer excelled with his tight marking. 

Rattled by Punjab?s speed and persistent pressure, Kerala defenders lost their composure for a brief period after halftime and conceded two soft goals. 

In the 48th minute, they reacted slowly to a free-kick and Hardeep Gill?s rising shot bulged the roof of the net. Three minutes on, Daljit?s long throw in from the right was headed home by an unmarked Harpreet Singh. 

Kerala re-grouped and equalised in the 55th minute. Abdul Naushad?s curling corner swerved went in at the far post as Kameshwar misjudged the flight. 

Kerala once again dominated with their short passing. In the 89th minute, following a combined move, Hakeem burst into the penalty area and was tripped by Harpreet. However, midfielder Lenal Thomas? penalty was parried by Punjab custodian and the attempt from the rebound went over the bar. 

A near capacity crowd watched the final. Delirious crowds, mostly Kerala supporters even invaded the ground during the prize giving ceremony. Kerala?s coach M. Peethmambharan said the win was a perfect gift for the people of Kerala ahead of the November 1 formation day.

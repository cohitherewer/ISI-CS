 Soumyadeep, Poulami claim titles

Manesar: Soumyadeep Roy of PSPB overcame ?organisational? delays and a resilient A. Sharath Kamal 7-11, 11-8, 11-7, 9-11, 18-16, 11-9 to lift the national ranking table tennis (north zone) crown here on Sunday. 

The women?s title went to national champion and top seed Poulami Ghatak of PSPB, defeating Anindita Chakraborty of RSPB 11-5, 11-6, 12-10, 11-3. 

It was a sorry state of affairs as the organisors ? Haryana Table Tennis Association ? first delayed the match by almost one and half hours awaiting the arrival of the chief guest, Haryana Assembly Speaker Satbir Singh Kaidyan, and then, as lights went off halfway through the match, preferred to complete their speeches, leaving the players stranded.

 Injury forces Nedved to quit international soccer

Prague: Czech captain and playmaker Pavel Nedved has retired from international football because of persistent injuries, the Czech soccer federation said on Friday. 

The 32-year-old European footballer of the year said this month he would not return to the national squad until he had fully recovered from a knee injury. 

?It really saddens me to be leaving the national team and I believe that my former teammates, who I was honoured to play with, as well as my fans... will respect and understand my decision,? he said in a statement. 

?I do not want to be seen as leaving without feeling or as being disgruntled. And because of this, I wish Czech football further success,? he added. 

Midfielder Nedved, who plays for Juventus in Italy, suffered the injury in the Euro 2004 semi-final loss to Greece. 

Nedved made his debut for the Czech Republic against Ireland in 1994 and played 83 times for his country, scoring 17 goals. 

He moved to Lazio from Sparta Prague in 1996, helping the Rome-based club to victories in the Italian Cup in 1998 and the European Cup Winners? Cup in 1999. 

The following season Lazio clinched the Italian league and Cup double and Juventus paid 41 million euros ($49.5 million) for Nedved in 2001. He helped Juventus win league titles in 2002 and 2003. 

In 2003 he missed Juventus? loss in the Champions League final to AC Milan after a booking in the semi-finals.

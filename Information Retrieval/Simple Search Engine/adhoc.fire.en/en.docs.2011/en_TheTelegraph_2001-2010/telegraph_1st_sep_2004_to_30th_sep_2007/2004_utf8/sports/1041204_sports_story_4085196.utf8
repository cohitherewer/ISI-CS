Seville: Carlos Moya fired Spain into a 1-0 lead over the United States in the Davis Cup final on Friday. 

Whipping up a record tennis crowd of 27,200, the former world No. 1 defeated Mardy Fish 6-4, 6-2, 6-3 at Seville?s Olympic Stadium. 

?I turned up for the most important date of my life in front of so many people, so I was a little nervous at the start,? Moya said. 

?But I played safely, within myself, not taking too many risks. I knew he is a player who, if things are going well for him, can be very strong.? 

Olympic silver-medallist Fish had won two of his three previous matches against Moya but those victories came on hardcourts. 

On Seville?s slow, red, power-blunting clay and against a backdrop of red and yellow flags and banners, Moya tied his opponent up in knots. 

Running him from side to side, the Spaniard put on a claycourt masterclass, dominating Fish from the start. 

Punching winners into the corners off both sides, Moya clinched the opening set on his first set-point in 40 minutes. 

The 1998 French Open champion blasted through Fish?s defences in the second set and the third proved little more than a formality. 

?This makes it easier for Rafa,? Moya said, looking ahead to teenager Rafael Nadal?s clash with world No. 2 Roddick. ?This win will give him confidence and he will be able to be more calm when he starts this game ? he has nothing to lose. 

?I have got a lot of trust in him. My advice would be to enjoy being here.? 

The teams will clash on the doubles court on Saturday with the reverse singles taking place on Sunday. 

The crowd, which set a record for a sanctioned tennis match, was a blanket of red and yellow. Fans were wrapped in overcoats and some sat under umbrellas on a cold, rainy day in southern Spain. The court is undercover, but fringe areas are exposed to the open air.

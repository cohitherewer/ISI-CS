The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Fourth straight loss for India 

 - World Cup Qualifier

 Another setback for Constantine 

New Delhi: Singapore struck twice within the space of three minutes as India crashed to their fourth straight defeat in the Asian Zone group III World Cup football qualifier against Singapore on Wednesday. 

The win at the Stadium of Singapore was also a sweet revenge for the home team, which had lost to India 0-1 ? through a Rennedy Singh strike ? in Goa in the first leg encounter in February. 

According to information received here, after a barren first half, Indra Sahdan bin Daud put the home team ahead in the 73rd minute, and three minutes later Mohammed Khairul Amri put the match beyond India?s reach. 

The match was of little significance as both India and Singapore are already out of the race for a place in the World Cup. 

For India, Wednesday?s setback continued the string of defeats following the victory against Singapore in Goa. 

After beating Singapore, India crashed 1-5 to Oman on March 31 and were humiliated by Japan 0-7 in Saitama on June 6 and 0-4 in Calcutta in the return leg on September 8. 

India will round off their campaign with a game against Oman in Muscat later this month.

 Glazer hits back, boots out three United directors 

 SAM WALLACE

Manchester United were plunged into civil war when renegade shareholder Malcolm Glazer used his ?205 million stake in the club to force out three directors as revenge for the board?s rejection of his takeover bid last month. 

The move forced chief executive David Gill to hold an emergency board meeting to discuss tactics for dealing with Glazer, who sent an associate to vote secretly on his behalf at the club?s annual general meeting Friday. 

The American multi-millionaire removed legal adviser Maurice Watkins, commercial director Andy Anson and non-executive director Philip Yea in an open declaration of war on the PLC board who are now reduced to just four members. 

But the American did not have all his own way after his bankers J.P. Morgan announced Friday they had ended their association with him. They are understood to be uncomfortable with his aggressive approach towards the board and would not back a hostile takeover. 

Anti-Glazer sentiments ran high among the fans who attended a packed AGM, with one elderly man even asking for the American to identify himself so he could ?take him outside?. Sources close to Gill said he would not buckle under the pressure from Glazer and would continue to lead the club despite the hostility of the second-largest shareholder. 

The Glazer family, who own 28.11 per cent of the club, were furious at the United board?s decision, on October 25, not to recommend their takeover which would have left the club with debts of ?500 million. 

Gill made the announcement that the board would resist the proposed takeover to the delight of fans who had hanged an effigy of the 76-year-old Glazer from the Stretford End just days earlier. 

Now United find themselves at a defining point in their 126-year history. They have a team who are under-performing and a board who are under siege from a shareholder who has attracted fierce opposition from supporters. The future of United will be decided by how Gill handles the interests of Glazer and Irish multi-millionaire John Magnier, the club?s largest shareholder. 

Magnier, whose investment company Cubic Expression own 28.9 per cent of the club, is capable of blocking any further moves by Glazer.

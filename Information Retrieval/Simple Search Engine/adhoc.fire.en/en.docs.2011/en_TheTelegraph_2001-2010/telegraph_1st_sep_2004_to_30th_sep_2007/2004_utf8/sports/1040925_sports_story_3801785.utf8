The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Flintoff is the power centre of the current English team

 JAWAGAL SRINATH 

 At present, Flintoff is the world?s No.1 allrounder 

The long-reigning supremacy of the Australians came to an end at last. For once at least, against England, they looked vulnerable. But even in defeat, the Australian batting continued to look good. Their bowling, however, seems to be losing its potency. 

More than the good batting by the England batsmen, it was the innocuous Australian bowling that was responsible for the rather unexpected Aussie exit. 

The Australian bowlers have failed to impress on the slow tracks. The gracefully ageing workhorse, Glenn McGrath is a shadow of what he was before the injury. Known for his highly disciplined line and length, he is naturally finding it hard to keep up with the pace at the international level. 

Brett Lee, who believes in pace, is struggling to come back to form in time. The law of averages has finally worked the world champions down. It is always good to see some fresh faces, and a final not involving Australia, indicating progress in the international arena. 

Pakistan had renewed their status of stardom after defeating India at Edgbaston. But the hype that was created about them after this win was soon dashed by the West Indies. 

It appears that the Pakistani thinktank completely misread the conditions and gifted away the initiative of winning the toss. Shoaib Akhtar bowled with zest and also floored the Windies captain Brian Lara with a bouncer. The way Lara ducked awkwardly into the bouncer looked very dangerous. But fortunately, not much damage was done to the team or to Lara. 

Shoaib?s bowling was powered by pace. But it remains to be seen how consistently he can do that. Sarwan and Chanderpaul have been the chief architects of the West Indies batting. Collymore and Bravo are quite effective in English conditions. The big win against the South Africans has instilled new confidence in them and the much-needed belief in their beleaguered players. 

Lara and Gayles are the other two important characters in the team. The inexperienced bowlers, who appear like bits and pieces, have somehow managed to excel so far in this tournament. A team comprising players from different islands have found it difficult to maintain the standards for various reasons. 

 McGrath is a shadow of what he was before 

the injury

The West Indies? entry into the final will definitely help in arresting the eroding interest in cricket in the Caribbeans. 

The entire English summer has been a success story for Vaughan and his boys this time. Except for their triangular series, they have dominated in both forms of the game. Andrew Flintoff is definitely the power centre of the current England team. Presently, he is the undisputed number one allrounder in the world. He has single-handedly steered England to victory on more than one occasion, something not many can do too often. 

Using a lightweight bat, he takes a heavy toll on any kind of bowling, be it spin or fast. On his day, Flintoff could be one of the quickest bowlers in the world. Obviously, Flintoff is the differentiator for the England team at the moment. 

The metamorphosis of Harmison becoming a matchwinner is another factor that has turned England into a winning combination. Although Harmison?s successes have mostly come in the longer version of the game, he is a good example of how well a Test cricketer can make it easily to the one-day team.

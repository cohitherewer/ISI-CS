The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Gibbs, Boje should be on tour: Jennings

 - ?Hopefully we can put up a fight in India that the public can be proud of?

Durban: South Africa?s new cricket coach Ray Jennings on Monday said Herschelle Gibbs and Nicky Boje should travel to India despite the cloud of match-fixing investigations hanging over them. 

?My feeling is that there is an issue and the issue should be faced. There?s no point in hiding away from it,? Jennings said here on Monday. 

?Those two players are very experienced and we got to utilise our best talent to our advantage,? said the former Test player who was appointed in place of Eric Simons by the United Cricket Board of South Africa (UCBSA) on Friday. 

Gibbs and Boje have already answered questionnaires forwarded to them by the Delhi Police regarding the Hansie Cronje match-fixing scandal, unearthed during South Africa?s tour of India in 2000. 

But the Delhi Police have not ruled out calling up the two players for further interrogation when they visit for a two-Test series starting on November 20. 

Jennings said India was a tough place to tour and there was the need not only for the best talent but also a new set of values and principles. 

?No doubt it?s going to be a daunting task to play in India. There?s going to be a huge challenge,? he said.

?It?s not only a challenging place but also since 

our return to international cricket, our team is playing very badly at the moment. 

?Hopefully we can go to India and put up a fight that the public can be proud of.? 

Jennings said he was concerned that players were losing their focus on the game and were being distracted by endorsements and other non-cricketing matters. 

?I think the values and principles of players need to be tested,? he said. 

?There needs to be honesty in the side and to make sure that players representing the country have the right kind of values to the public and the UCBSA and to the fellow players. 

?Hopefully they have respect for the system and from that the team will become energised. 

?I think every now and then it?s necessary to get back to the basics, to keep our feet on the ground and to realise that it?s a tremendous privilege and honour to represent the country. 

?If you don?t tackle those kind of issues then obviously the players believe that they can?t be touched.?

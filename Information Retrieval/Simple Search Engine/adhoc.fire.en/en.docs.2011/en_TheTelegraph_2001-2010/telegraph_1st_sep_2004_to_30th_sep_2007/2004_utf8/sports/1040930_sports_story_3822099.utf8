 BCCI seeks police stand

New Delhi: With South Africa?s tour of India drawing nearer, the issue of possible questioning of two key players of the visiting team (Nickey Boje and Herscelle Gibbs) in connection with a match-fixing case, has revived with the BCCI seeking to know Delhi Police?s stand. 

Faced with a ?threat? by the South African team not to go ahead with the tour if Boje and Gibbs were quizzed, BCCI has written to Delhi police commissioner K.K. Paul to ascertain whether the duo will be questioned if they come here later this year. 

The police appeared undecided on the matter. ?We have received the letter and are examining it,? Paul said on Wednesday, adding the letter was yet to be responded to. On the status of the case, he said ?everybody knows what it is.? 

Police sources said the case had not been closed yet and they still wanted to question Boje and Gibbs in the case, which rocked the cricket world. (PTI)

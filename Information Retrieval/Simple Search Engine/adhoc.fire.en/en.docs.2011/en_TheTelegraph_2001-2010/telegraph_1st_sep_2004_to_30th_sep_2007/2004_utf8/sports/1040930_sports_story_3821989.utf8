The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Title for Nepal school

 A CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi: For the second 

 time since its inception in 1998, the Subroto Mukerjee Cup 

 for under-14 years tournament has been won by a school team 

 from Nepal. In a one-sided final, Nepal?s Gyanodaya Bal 

 Batika Secondary School overwhelmed local Air Force Bal 

 Bharti School 4-0 on Wednesday. 

In contrast, the Subroto Mukerjee Cup (under-17 years), has never been won by a foreign school team and only twice has a foreign outfit reached the final in 1993 and 1996. 

Former internationals Harjinder Singh and Ranjit Thapa, who witnessed the entire tournament, said that none of the 23 Indian school teams could match the skills and technique of the champion outfit from Nepal. They felt that it was a sad reflection of age-group football in India. 

In Wednesday?s final, Gyanodaya Bal Batika cantered to victory. Their goalkeeper Rupak Shrestha, who wore a Real Madrid jersey, barely touched the ball. The Delhi school was coached by Biswajit Das ? who had won the 1983 Subroto Cup with Madhyamgram High School. 

BSL IV E High School of Bokaro will face Govt Senior Secondary School, Dimapur, in the under-17 final on Thursday.

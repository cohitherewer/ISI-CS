 Gairik Bardhan on golden spree

 - All India Railway Aquatics

 A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Gairik Bardhan scooped up three golds on the third day of the all-India railways aquatic championships at the Subhas Sarobar pool on Friday. 

The Eastern Railway swimmer first claimed the 400m individual medley event in a canter, though his timing of 4:59.82 was well outside Akbar Ali Mirs meet record (4:56.00). 

Gairik then won the 50m breaststroke at 31.63. He capped a successful day by helping Eastern Railway notch up a facile victory in the 4x100m freestyle. 

On Thursday, Gairik won the 100m breaststroke, erasing the meet record of Sebastian Xavier, the grand old man of Indian swimming. 

Mir lost out to Dipesh Bairagi in the 100m backstroke and had to be content with a silver. Mir, who holds the meet record in the event at 1:02.31, timed 1:03.23 as against Bairagis 1:02.98.

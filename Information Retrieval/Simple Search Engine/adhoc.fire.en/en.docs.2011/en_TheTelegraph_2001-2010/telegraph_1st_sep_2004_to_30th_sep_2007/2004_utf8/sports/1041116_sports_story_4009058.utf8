 Survival of the fittest: Henry

 Henry says Pollock?s sacking as captain was misunderstood 

Jaipur: The South African cricket team currently in India has many hues to it, thanks to the transformation sweeping through the rainbow nation. And the man heading the change in colour is none other than Omar Henry, the first non-white cricketer to play for South Africa. 

Henry, who played most of his cricket against the ?rebel? touring teams, is bestowed with a crucial role in South Africa?s cricketing history. As the chairman of selection panel, he is responsible for implementing the quota system and make sure the ?under-privileged? get a fair representation in the national and provincial teams. 

The process has caused enough friction with some talented white players leaving South Africa. But Henry says only the country?s disturbing past has made the issue to be seen in terms of colour. 

?One must understand that regardless of colour, no player is happy when he is dropped. I have been a player myself. Unfortunately, South African history is based on colour. So it is seen as a colour issue. It is not necessarily so,? the 52-year-old said. 

The 14-member squad to play the two Tests here includes five non-white players. Henry said all these players were selected on merit and their being in the team pointed to the progress made. ?Basically progress has been made in the last two-and-half years with youngsters coming through the structures. 

?They have played for South Africa U-15 and U-19, the A side and are playing for the national side now. So our structures are producing and we are fortunate in that way. And ever since I came on this panel, we have been driving to get our cricket better, improving our cricket overall.? 

Henry said preference would be given to a non-white player over the white with same set of skills and talent but the ?under-privileged? had the same responsibility as any other player to perform. 

But should such an inexperienced team be selected for such a tough tour? ?The players that are here are the one on form. Somewhere down the line they have to learn what it is to play international cricket,? Henry said. 

He said the controversy over Shaun Pollock being sacked as captain after the World Cup last year was also similarly misunderstood. In fact, he said, appointing Graeme Smith in Pollock?s place was part of the transformation process. 

?It was not a case of being fair or unfair, not even a case of blaming Pollock for the loss. We said we are building a new era and Smith was the start of it. That process is on, other youngsters have come through, and you are seeing the faces of change. We are building.? 

Henry said South Africa?s recent slump in form could not be attributed to the quota system. ?The players who are here have performed with the A side and in domestic cricket.? (PTI)

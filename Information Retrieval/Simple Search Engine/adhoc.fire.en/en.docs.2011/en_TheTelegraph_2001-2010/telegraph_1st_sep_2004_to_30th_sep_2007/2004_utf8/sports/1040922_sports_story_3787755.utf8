 Mongia tops batting at Lancashire

 - Indian scored 470 runs with two tons 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

Birmingham: Dinesh Mongia, unlucky not to have made the Team India XIV as Sachin Tendulkar?s replacement for the Champions Trophy, has topped the Frizzell (County) Championship batting averages for Lancashire. 

Mongia, out of the national side for 17 months, was signed by Lancashire midway in the summer and scored 470 runs with two centuries and two fifties to average a handsome 67.14. 

The County, though, is now going to be seen in Division II. Ditto for Northamptonshire and Worcestershire. The ones to move up are Hampshire, Glamorgan and Nottinghamshire. 

The championship, of course, has been won by Warwickshire. 

According to The Telegraph?s sources, Mongia was captain Sourav Ganguly?s choice ? and with good reasons ? to take Sachin?s place. Yet, when the team management requested the board for a replacement, no name was forwarded. 

That worked to Rohan Gavaskar?s advantage.

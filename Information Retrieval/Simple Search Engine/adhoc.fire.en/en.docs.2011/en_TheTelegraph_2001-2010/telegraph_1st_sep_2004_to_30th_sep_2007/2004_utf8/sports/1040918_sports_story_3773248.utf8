Bloomfield Hills (Michigan): Colin Montgomerie inspired a brilliant putting display by holders Europe as they led the United States in all four opening four-ball matches at the 35th Ryder Cup on Friday. 

Europe have dominated the first two days of team play in recent Cup matches and they stayed on track to maintain that trend with a barrage of birdie putts from between 10 and 25 feet at an overcast Oakland Hills. 

?They?ve made enough putts that we could pave the road from Detroit to Chicago,? US captain Hal Sutton said. ?They want to beat us bad and this happens in the Ryder Cup.? 

Montgomerie, playing with Ireland?s Padraig Harrington in a heavyweight clash with eight-times major winner Tiger Woods and US Masters champion Phil Mickelson, holed a seven-foot birdie putt at the par-four first to draw first blood for Europe. 

Harrington, Europe?s highest-ranked player, followed suit at the par-three third, striking his tee shot to eight feet to put the Europeans two up. 

Although the Americans pulled one hole back at the par-four fifth, Europe hit back at the sixth, Montgomerie holing out for birdie from 20 feet. 

Mickelson, who had been struggling with his distance control, finally got it right at the par-four seventh with a superb approach to just two feet. 

The birdie was conceded but Europe restored their two-hole advantage when Harrington drained a 25-footer for birdie at the par-four eighth. 

In the second match, Europeans Darren Clarke and Miguel Angel Jimenez were three up against Davis Love III and Chad Campbell after seven holes, while Sergio Garcia and Lee Westwood were also three up on David Toms and Jim Furyk, after five. 

In match three, Americans Chris Riley and Stewart Cink trailed Ireland?s Paul McGinley and Briton Luke Donald by a hole, McGinley having birdied the par-four sixth. 

Spaniard Jimenez birdied the par-five second and Clarke doubled their lead with a birdie at the par-four fourth, holing out from 10 feet. 

Briton Clarke then rammed in a 20-foot birdie putt at the fifth for Europe to go three up. 

Woods and Mickelson had never previously been paired at the Ryder Cup but US captain Sutton was determined his team got off to the best possible start. (Reuters)

 Athens: Britain?s Tanni Grey-Thompson collected her 11th Paralympic gold medal since making her first appearance in Seoul in 1988 when she won the women?s T54 400m on Monday.

 Grey-Thompson, who won the 100m on Thursday, almost collected another medal in the T53 400m final but missed out on bronze by 0.06 seconds. The 35-year-old Welsh athlete admitted before the Games she had never felt so nervous. After winning her gold, she confessed that the nerves had remained with her throughout. ?I am normally not very emotional, but the emotions I went through in these Games, it is just amazing,? she said. She added: ?If you asked me now whether I would go through to Beijing in four years time, the answer would be yes but this is not the time or the place to make a big decision like that.?

 London: World 100m record holder Tim Montgomery will learn next week the date for his appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) against a possible life ban for doping.

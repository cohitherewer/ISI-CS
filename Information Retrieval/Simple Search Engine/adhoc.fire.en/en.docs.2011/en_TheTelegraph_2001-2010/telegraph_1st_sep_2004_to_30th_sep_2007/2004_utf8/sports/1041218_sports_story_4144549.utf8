 Rudolph rescues SA 

Port Elizabeth: Jacques Rudolph scored his sixth Test half-century to bolster South Africa on the first day of the first Test against England in Port Elizabeth on Friday. 

Rudolph was batting on 84 at tea, which South Africa reached on 164 for three after winning the toss and opting to bat on a placid pitch. 

Rudolph has batted for almost four hours, faced 180 balls and hit 12 fours. Boeta Dippenaar was also unbeaten on 41 in an excellent unbroken fourth-wicket stand of 98. (Reuters)

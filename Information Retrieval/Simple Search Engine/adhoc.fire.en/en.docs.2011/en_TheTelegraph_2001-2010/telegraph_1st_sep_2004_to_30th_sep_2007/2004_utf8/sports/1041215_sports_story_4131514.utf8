 Danny Williams vows not to give up the fight

 - Boxer analyses what went wrong against Vitali Klitschko 

Paul Hayward 

 I want to be world champion, asserts Williams 

Las Vegas: On his coffee table a Bakewell tart and a packet of Mrs Fields? Premium Cookies sat unopened. Danny Williams? mouth was too puffy and scarred for him to eat. His right eyeball was invisible behind a mound of swollen tissue. The words he squeezed out were familiar. This was not the end. 

The savagery of the beating administered to this amiable 31-year-old from Brixton by Vitali Klitschko in Las Vegas on Saturday night sent many of us to his room the next day expecting to hear a retirement speech. Instead, an old boxing voice was at work inside his battered head. 

After 20 or more years in the gym, no fighter wants to leave the ring disfigured and humiliated. So the lacerations, the swellings and the headaches exhort him to get back in there as soon as doctors will allow; to bury the memory, to make amends. 

Twelve hours after Williams had walked into the Valley Hospital to have his head wound glued, and his brain scanned for possible damage, he sat in a dressing gown, bouncing his baby daughter on his knee and vowing not to go out as a minor entry on Klitschko?s CV. 

?I want to be world champion,? Williams said through lips so swollen that talking came almost as hard as eating or sleeping. ?Frank Bruno had four attempts. Until I?m a shot fighter, I?m going to keep going.? 

In a room that looked across the Nevada desert to the scarred mountains beyond, there was an unspoken sense that he might be falling into the old trap of chasing phantoms. The heavily beaten fighter looks at his defeat, picks out a single cause and persuades himself that wisdom and experience will yield a better outcome next time. He yearns to rewind the tape and try again. This is his defence against despair. 

The best Williams can hope for now is a chance against one of the fringe heavyweight champions, such as Lamon Brewster, who holds the World Boxing Organisation title. His manager/promoter, Frank Warren, has advised Williams to rest for six months, and is counselling him not to take any more unwinnable bouts. 

From Williams, on Sunday morning, came a cogent and believable analysis of what went wrong. ?My plan was messed up in the first round when I was knocked down after 36 seconds and I had to go to war to get myself out of trouble,? he said. 

?I started slowly, and when you have a bad first round it can mess you up. When you get hit early in a fight, nothing?s working for you ? the balance, the head movement. So you go to war...? 

Though plenty at ringside wanted the towel to be thrown in after the third knock-down, in the seventh round, Williams says it would have been anathema to him to surrender on his stool. ?No way, man,? he said. ?I want to fight to the end.?

 Brussels: Standard Liege?s Greek striker Alexandros Kaklamanos has tested positive for cocaine, Club Sporting director Pierre Francois confirmed on Saturday. The French-speaking Sud Presse newspaper group and the Flemish Het Laatste Nieuws reported that the positive result was returned after a Belgian league game on August 28 against FC Brussels.

 The 30-year-old player has ten days to appeal and request a B-sample. If the second sample confirms the result the player faces a two-year suspension and automatic dismissal from his club.

 Belgrade: Red Star Belgrade manager Ljupko Petrovic resigned on Saturday after the team?s 0-4 loss to Zenit St Petersburg in their Uefa Cup first-round first-leg match on Thursday. Petrovic, who guided the club to victory in the European Cup in 1991 during his first spell in charge, said his resignation was the only solution after European failure and a poor start in the Serbia and Montenegro first division.

 ?There was no point in carrying on after two crushing defeats in Europe as that would have only prolong the agony,? he said upon the teams return from Russia. Red Star once again failed to qualify for the Champions league after last month?s defeat by PSV Eindhoven in the third qualifying round and face almost certain elimination from the Uefa Cup. 

 Islamabad: Pakistan staged their first ever womens soccer match on Saturday to mark Fifa Fairplay Day.

 The Pakistan Football Federation organised the match and coach Tariq Lutfi said it would go a long way in promoting womens sports in the country. Pakistan have womens cricket and hockey teams, and Pakistan sent one female athlete to each of the last three Olympic Games.

 But the country have no womens soccer team. quot;When women can play cricket and hockey they can also play soccer as we are adhering to the strict dress codes of long trousers and full shirts, quot; said Lutfi.

 Berlin: The German tennis federation (DTB) has sold its $ 1.3-million Berlin WTA event, a traditional French Open warm-up event, to the Gulf state of Qatar for 6.7 million Euros, DTB president Georg Von Waldenfels told Saturday?s Bild newspaper.

 The tournament will be held for the last time in 2005 from May 2 to 8 before it switches to the Middle East. The event, played on clay in Germany and acting as a major tune-up for the second Grand Slam event of the season in the French capital which starts at the end of May, could not be switched in time for 2005.

 Furthermore, a new date may have to be found for the event as the early summer heat in the Gulf would make it impossible to play outdoors in May. The money raised from the sale will go towards helping finance ATP men?s tournaments in Berlin and Hamburg as well as funding junior tennis. 

 Montreal: Jacques Villeneuve is relishing the chance to help Renault overtake his former BAR team for second place in this year?s Formula One constructors? championship. ?It?s the reason I?ve been hired ,? Villeneuve said on Friday after Renault confirmed his comeback for the last three races of the season.

 IN THE CITY

 Mohun Bagan will take on Tollygunge Agragami in the final Calcutta Super Division League match on Tuesday. The match, to be played at Howrah Stadium, is crucial from Mohun Bagan?s point of view, as only a win will ensure them a second-place finish in the league. If Bagan win, then they will finish on similar points with Ever-Ready (38). But a better goal average will see the green-maroons emerge second behind East Bengal.

 However, there are some worries in the Bagan camp as midfielder Tomba Singh suffered injury during practice. Striker Ashim Biswas too is doubtful. 

 Bengal, who topped East zone, will take on North zone runners-up 

Delhi in the knock-out phase of the Polly Umrigar (under-15) Trophy to be played 

in the city from December 25 to 27. 

 The 10-team knock-out phase (two teams from each zone) will be held entirely in the city at different venues.

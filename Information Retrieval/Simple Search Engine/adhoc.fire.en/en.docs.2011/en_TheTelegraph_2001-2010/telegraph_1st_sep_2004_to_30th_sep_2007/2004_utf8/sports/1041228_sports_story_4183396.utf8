The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Wayne Rooney still a boy at heart

 - England star learning to cope with life as a celebrity 

SIMON HART

 The tabloids seem determined to turn Wayne and Coleen into the new Posh and Becks, feels his agent 

The first thing that strikes you when you come face to face with Wayne Rooney is how improbably young he looks. And sounds. 

On the pitch, it is easy to forget that the player who bulldozed defences in Portugal, bamboozled Zinedine Zidane and announced his arrival at Manchester United with a Champions League hattrick has only recently turned 19. 

But take away his footballing stage and the precocity, that has transformed him from a talented youth into a national icon, quickly evaporates. 

?So what are you hoping to receive for Christmas?? I ask. ?A BMX bike,? he replies, quick as a flash. ?I?m only messing,? he laughs, but one cannot escape the thought that, were it not for the gold dust in his boots, he would probably still be performing wheelies on the streets of Croxteth. 

After a year when his reputation and bank balance were swollen by a string of displays that elevated him beyond David Beckham as the talisman of English football, Rooney?s preferred mode of transport is now a Cadillac Escalade, though beneath the trappings of fame lurks a shy and remarkably ordinary teenager. 

When he talks about his life on and off the pitch, he repeatedly refers to himself as ?you? rather than ?I?. The egotism that stalks professional football is something that is still apparently alien to him. 

?At home I?m still the same person but obviously you?ve had to change some of the things you do and grow up a bit faster than a normal 19-year-old would, but I think it is a change for the better. Obviously, sometimes it?s difficult when you go out somewhere with your girlfriend and there are people watching and taking photographs. But, having said that, I wouldn?t swap my job for anything.? 

The photographs are a sore point. Last week, having been given a few days off by Sir Alex Ferguson before the Christmas football programme, he treated his fiancee, Coleen McLoughlin, to a night in a luxury Parisian hotel and a spot of shopping and sightseeing. The couple were unaware that they were being followed by a photographer working for a national newspaper, who published the pictures under the headline Blingtime in Paris. 

Rooney accepts such intrusions with a shrug. ?You don?t want people following you around but if it happens, it happens,? he says. 

?I didn?t see the people taking the pictures, so they?re obviously sneaking around, but there?s nothing I can do about it. You have got to get on with life and accept that you will be followed around and people will take pictures. You can?t let it affect you.? 

Rooney?s agent, Paul Stretford, is rather more strident about the invasion of the couple?s privacy. He is particularly irritated by the repeated portrayal of McLoughlin as a shopaholic with expensive tastes. 

?The thing is that Wayne has the opportunity to answer back when he walks on to a football pitch and is hero-worshipped by 60,000 fans, but Coleen does not have that opportunity,? he says. ?The tabloids seem determined to turn Wayne and Coleen into the new Posh and Becks, but the difference is that Posh was already in the entertainment business so she needed and courted publicity whereas Coleen is just a very nice girl who happens to be Wayne?s girlfriend. Sometimes the coverage can be very unfair.? 

For Rooney, the business of dealing with the media is now a by-product of the commercial deals negotiated by Stretford that will add further riches to the ?22 million, six-year contract he has signed at Old Trafford. 

Although his life is now unrecognisable from his early days on Merseyside, Rooney is determined not to let his celebrity go to his head. That was the advice Steven Gerrard gave him when the pair became friends during Euro 2004, and the same message has come from other colleagues in the England and Manchester United dressing rooms. 

?All the players try and help you and give you bits of advice when they can and the advice they?ve given me I?ve taken on board,? he says. ?They told me to keep my feet on the ground and just don?t be doing stupid things. 

?There?s always a chance there?s going to be a photographer around, plus there are lots of young people who look up to footballers, so I think you?ve always got to watch what you?re doing for their sake as well as yours because if they see you doing something bad then they are going to think it is okay for them to do it as well.? 

The friendships he formed on the playing fields of Portugal have also helped ease the ?27 million move from Goodison Park to Old Trafford, which began so spectacularly with his stunning hattrick against Fenerbahce in September. 

?I have been close to all the England players really since I came to United,? he says. ?It was good to see familiar faces already here in the dressing room and they helped me settle in. I knew six or seven players already so that made it easy to settle down. If I needed anything or needed to ask a question, then I could always turn to them and they could help me along. 

?Walking in on my first day, there actually weren?t many players around? I think the day I came there was only Wes Brown, Ruud van Nistelrooy and John O?Shea, who were injured. I met them first so it wasn?t as if I walked in when everyone was there. Everyone came in after that in dribs and drabs and they all welcomed me to the club, and that made me feel at home.? 

Rooney also pays tribute to the role of Ferguson and Sven-Goran Eriksson in helping to shape his fledgling career. It is surely no coincidence that he has picked up just four bookings while wearing an England or a United shirt, despite his hot-headed display against Spain last month, compared to the 20 yellow cards and one dismissal he received during his two seasons in the Everton first team. 

?I think they?re both different people and both different managers,? he says. ?Sven is a calm manager and doesn?t really say a lot. The boss [Alex Ferguson] is tough and lets you know when he thinks you?re doing things wrong, but he also lets you know when you are doing things right as well, which is good. They?re both very different but they are both among the top coaches in the world and you can only learn from them. 

?The boss has been really great with me. He is always talking to me before and after games, telling me how he thinks I have played. He has been different to what I thought he might be, but he?s been brilliant since I signed. He always backs his players through everything and that makes him a great manager. All the players here respect him and I don?t think that will ever change.? 

While his performances in Portugal and the day he signed for United remain his most memorable moments of 2004, his experiences at United?s training ground in Carrington have also made a deep impression. 

?At United I think the best part has been playing and training with all these great players,? he says. ?I learn a lot every day in training and it?s brilliant to be surrounded by so many experienced players. 

?Roy Keane makes sure training is a serious affair. If you make a mistake, even in training, he?s always on at you, telling you to concentrate and trying to keep you from making mistakes. It?s proper training, believe me. You have to do the best you can and put your tackles in because everyone wants to win, even in a training game. 

?I think (Cristiano) Ronaldo and (Ryan) Giggs are the two players who have surprised me most with their skill. I?d seen them on TV before I came to the club and seen some of the skills they do in the games, but when you see them doing it during training all the time and practising it, it?s amazing how they do it. Their feet are so quick.? 

Rooney believes their influence can only improve his own game, and he has already taken a leaf out of their book by staying behind after training to hone his skills. 

This time next year he hopes he will have earned his first silverware ? ?a Premiership, FA Cup or Champions League medal, any of those? ? and that England will be playing the kind of football that will make them one of the favourites for the 2006 World Cup. ?If we get there, we will have a good chance of winning it,? he insists.

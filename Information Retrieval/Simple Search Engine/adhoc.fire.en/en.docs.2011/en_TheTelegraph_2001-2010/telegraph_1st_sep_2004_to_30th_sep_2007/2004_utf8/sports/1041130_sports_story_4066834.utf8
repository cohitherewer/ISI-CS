The Telegraph - Calcutta

Sehwag is of rare breed

 Virender Sehwag

As the shadows appeared and before the light switch 

had been flicked on at Eden Gardens on Day II, one Virender Sehwag was already 

alight, producing amazing fireworks for all to see. His explosive ability is rare, 

making him such an asset to the Indian team, and of course, an absolute crowd 

(and commentators?) favourite.

I enjoy watching him bat so much and feel a certain 

understanding and rapport given I approached the game with the same attitude. 

His technique is quite different to mine, but the approach is the same, each ball 

should be scored off with the last resort being defence. I can appreciate the 

frustration he has, and will create, when he has a run of low scores. This often 

results in management, media and public criticism, with them begging for a more 

conservative approach. The flip side is that when he is in supreme touch, like 

now, he is the ultimate entertainer and more importantly, a matchwinner for his 

country. 

What people do not understand is that for the likes 

of Sehwag, the difference between being in or out of form is often only one shot, 

all he ever needs is encouragement to keep playing his natural game. Which would 

you prefer, an entertaining matchwinner or, a cautious builder? 

I know which I would choose. I have noticed some changes 

in his game recently, which certainly have not lessened his effect, only made 

him more secure at the start of his innings. On Monday he was very happy to watch 

many deliveries from the accurate Pollock sail through to the keeper, something 

he did not do enough of against McGrath recently. 

It also appears he is not going as hard at the ball 

initially, which really minimises risk. And I think now he realises that a 75% 

Sehwag swing of the bat is still enough to see the ball fly over the boundary 

rope (I wish I had learned this earlier in my career). These are only subtle tweaks, 

but so important for an aggressor like himself to find a little more consistency. 

It also shows us that he is not all about stand and deliver and actually learning 

and thinking more about his own game. 

The shot of the day for me on Monday was his wrist 

opening cover drive off Andrew Hall, perfectly exposing the huge gap through the 

point region. It simply raced to the boundary and informed us all of the magic 

he can perform from that flashing blade. This was the start of the onslaught towards 

the end of the day?s play, which in no uncertain terms stung the South African?s.

When stumps was called, once again due to the failing 

light and bizarre hours of play, South Africa looked a little shell shocked and 

are probably ruing not capitalising on their first day?s effort with the bat. 

They lost 78 for five in 38 overs, never looking like 

taking a hold of this Test match ? I feel through lack of intent with the bat, 

never at any stage attempting to target a bowler and increase their modest run-rate.

It is obvious to see what Sehwag is bringing to this 

match, it is simply great entertainment and more importantly, he is setting up 

the Test match for India through his positive approach. 

Please take note South Africa.

 Capriati calls for technology 

New York: Jennifer Capriati held off rising Russian Vera Douchevina to reach the fourth round of the US Open on Friday then called on the games organisers to bring in video aids for umpires. 

The 28-year-old former world No.1 started like an express train but was made to work overtime by 17-year-old Douchevina before winning 6-0, 6-7, 6-3. 

I maybe took my foot off the gas a bit but she raised her game after starting nervously, Capriati, who has never reached the final at her home Grand Slam, told reporters. She came up with some great shots but in the third set I took it up a notch. 

With several dubious line calls in the match for both players, the American said it was about time new technology was brought in to the game. 

I really think they should look into having the Hawk-Eye on the umpires chair, Capriati said referring to the system used by the host broadcaster to show close calls.

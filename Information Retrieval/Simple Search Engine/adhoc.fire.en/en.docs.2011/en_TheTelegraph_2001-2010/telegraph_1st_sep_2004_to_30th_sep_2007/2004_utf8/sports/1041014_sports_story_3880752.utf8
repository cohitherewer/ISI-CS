The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Warne anxious to crack record

Sydney: Australian leg-spinner Shane Warne has admitted that the anxiety to break the world record for highest wickets took to him on the final day of the Bangalore Test and said he would ?be jumping off the nearest bridge? if he falls short again in Chennai. 

The 35-year-old has so far scalped 531 Test wickets and needs just two more to claim the record from Sri Lankan Muttiah Muralidharan. 

Warne, who was six short of breaking the record when he stepped on Indian soil, finally admitted that the record was playing on his mind. 

?Human nature takes over,? said Warne, who took four wickets in 60 overs in the first Test but failed to eclipse the record on the final day. 

?You tell yourself you?ll be relaxed , and I was for 55 overs. But as soon as the game was there to be won, my own expectation and everybody else?s was that I?d get the record. 

?I just thought it was going to happen, but it didn?t... hopefully I can get it in the second Test. Otherwise I?d be pretty frustrated. I?ll be jumping off the nearest bridge.?

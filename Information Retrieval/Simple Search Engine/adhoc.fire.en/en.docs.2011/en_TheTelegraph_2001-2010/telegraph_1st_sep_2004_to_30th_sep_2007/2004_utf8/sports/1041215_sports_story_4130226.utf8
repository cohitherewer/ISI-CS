The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Some stars shone through drug cloud

 - 2004 ATHLETICS YEAR-ENDER 

 Yelena Isinbayeva soared the highest 

London: The Black Sea Cossacks choir backed by a full orchestra lent an exotic twist to the Brussels Golden League meeting in the week after the Athens Olympics. 

To the delight of a noisy crowd who had enjoyed some splendid athletics, including two world records, the choir was joined on stage by Russian pole-vaulter Yelena Isinbayeva, who belted out an enthusiastic version of her national anthem. 

Isinbayeva had set her seventh world record of the year while winning the gold medal in Athens. In Brussels she extended her mark another centimetre to 4.92 m and picked up another $ 100,000 bonus. 

The women?s pole vault is still a fledgling event and Isinbayeva confessed at the season-ending world athletics final that she had already exceeded 5m in training. 

After making a fortune in world record bonuses, some of which went towards buying a new car, Isinbayeva was considerably richer at year?s end and indisputably the women?s Athlete of the Year. 

Athens showcased the old and the new with the core sport of the Games fully living up to its exalted status. It also provided a welcome respite from the BALCO scandal, which had threatened to wreck track and field. 

A federal investigation into the Californian laboratory, believed to be manufacturing and distributing the previously undetectable designer steroid THG, claimed some high-profile casualties but its tentacles did not spread as wide as originally feared. 

It clearly affected Marion Jones, winner of three gold medals at the Sydney Games. 

Jones? partner Tim Montgomery, the world 100 m record holder, was investigated and eventually charged with serious doping violations as a result of the BALCO inquiry. 

The home country?s leading medal hopes Costas Kenteris, the Sydney 200 m champion and Katerina Thanou, the 100 m silver medallist behind Jones in Sydney, withdrew after missing a scheduled drugs test on the eve of the opening ceremony. 

Russian Irina Korzhanenko tested positive after winning the first athletics gold of the Games, the women?s shot put in Ancient Olympia. Hungarian men?s hammer champion Adrian Annus and his teammate Robert Fazekas, the discus champion, were also stripped of their gold medals for doping violations. 

On a brighter note, Athens proved a triumph for the great Moroccan Hicham El Guerrouj, hitherto the undisputed master of the 1,500 m in every arena apart from the Olympics. 

At the tail end of the European winter Bekele won the men?s long and short course races at the world cross-country championships for the third time. No other man has done it once. 

He then broke Haile Gebrselassie?s world indoor 5,000 m record and went on to break his great compatriot?s outdoor marks over 5,000 and 10,000 at the start of the outdoor season. 

Faced with the dilemma of choosing between El Guerrouj and Bekele as male Athlete of the Year, the world governing body resolved the problem adroitly.

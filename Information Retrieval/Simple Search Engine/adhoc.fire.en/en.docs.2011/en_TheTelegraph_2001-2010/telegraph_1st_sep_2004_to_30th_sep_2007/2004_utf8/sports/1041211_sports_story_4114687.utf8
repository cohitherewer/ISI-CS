 Richardson retires

Melbourne: New Zealand opener Mark Richardson announced his retirement on Friday, ending a career that included four centuries in 38 Tests. 

?It is hard to let go from playing all competitive cricket, as it has been such a big part in my life, but the decision is one which sits comfortably with me,? Richardson said. (REUTERS)

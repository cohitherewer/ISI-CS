 Sharapova is unhappy 

 Maria Sharapova says the balls are too heavy on her arm 

Los Angeles: Wimbledon champion Maria Sharapova has complained that the official WTA Tour balls are too heavy and caused her recent chest and shoulder injuries. 

Due to her discomfort, the 17-year-old Russian asked the Tour not to use its official Tretorn edition balls at this week?s season-ending WTA Championships, but her request fell on deaf ears. 

?They are heavy on my arm,? Sharapova said on Tuesday, two days ahead of her opening match at the eight-women round robin event against compatriot Vera Zvonareva. 

?It?s something that the Tour and (CEO) Larry Scott have to look into. I?m sure the WTA doesn?t want anyone to get injured.? Tour spokesman Darrell Fry said that after Sharapova made a private complaint a few weeks ago, the WTA consulted experts and other players as to whether the balls had become a problem but could not find any evidence that her assertion was true. 

?There?s no correlation at all between player injuries and Tretorn balls,? Fry said. ?The health of our players is first and foremost in our minds. That?s why we conducted blind tests with dozens of players last year to find the best ball, which turned out to be Tretorn. 

?If there are complaints in the future, we?ll look into them.? The WTA has a three-year contract with Tretorn but Sharapova and Zvonareva want to see a change as soon as possible.

Calcutta: Winning the Royal Challenge RCGC Cup from right under Jasjeet Singh?s nose was, perhaps, Chirag Kumar?s best birthday gift ? though a couple of days late ? here Friday. 

The 21-year old stole the trophy with a consistent performance of one-over 73 in the final round which landed him with a four-day tally of 289. Jasjeet finished runner-up, one stroke behind. 

The third position was taken by A.S. Lehal who notched up a four-day total of 293, with Noida?s Simarjeet Singh finishing fourth, a stroke behind Lehal. Opening-day leader Gagan Verma was fifth at 296. 

Chirag and jasjeet were at the 18th on identical scores after the 17th. Had Jasjeet parred the last hole the game would have gone into a play-off. Bit it was Chirag who managed the par against Jasjeet?s bogey. 

Jasjeet had started the day at the top, four strokes ahead of Chirag. However, Jasjeet bogeyed the second and third holes, and bogeys kept him company on the way back, before the 11th which he double-bogeyed. Two birdies weren?t compensation enough. 

Chirag also had bogeys (four), but three birdies compensated.

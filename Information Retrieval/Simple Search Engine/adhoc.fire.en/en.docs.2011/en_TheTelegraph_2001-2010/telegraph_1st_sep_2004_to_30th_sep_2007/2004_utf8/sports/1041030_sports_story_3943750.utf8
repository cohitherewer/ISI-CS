 Leeds may be sold in a week

London: Leeds United, one of the great names of English soccer, could be sold to a British-American consortium within a week. The head of the consortium, Sebastian Sainsbury, said Friday he had an agreement with Leeds chairman Gerald Krasner to buy the club for ? 25 million ($ 45.73 million). 

All he has to do is come up with the money. 

?My latest news is that he (Krasner) wants proof of funds and that is what I?m now going to be working to deliver,? Sainsbury told BBC Radio. ?I very much hope it will be on his desk by Monday.? 

Asked whether Krasner and the Yorkshire-based consortium that owns the club would definitely sell if the money were forthcoming, Sainsbury said: ?We have an agreement.? 

?We?ve always committed to completing the deal a week today so the only thing that can delay it is Mr Krasner and the board,? said Sainsbury, great-grandson of the founder of the British supermarket chain which bears his name.

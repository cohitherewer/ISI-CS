 Michael Owen boosts Real morale

Madrid: Michael Owen scored his second goal in two games to earn Real Madrid a morale-boosting 1-0 win at home to champions Valencia in the Primera Liga on Saturday. 

The England striker, who opened his account for Real when he scored in their 1-0 Champions League win over Dynamo Kiev on Tuesday, cracked home from the edge of the area after Raul had threaded the ball through the defence in the seventh minute. 

But although Real dominated for long periods at the Bernabeu they failed to press home their advantage against a Valencia side that appeared to be still traumatised by their 1-5 Champions League mauling at home by Inter Milan in midweek. 

Despite Saturday?s defeat, Valencia remain in second place, five points behind unbeaten Barcelona. Real, who had taken just a point from their last three league games, move up to seventh in the standings. 

Earlier on Saturday, Deportivo Coruna striker Diego Tristan earned his side a 1-1 draw away to a dominant Malaga side with a well-taken header four minutes from time, cancelling out a spectacular first-half volley by the in-form Paulo Wanchope. 

Real coach Mariano Garcia Remon, deciding to keep faith with the attacking line-up that helped beated Kiev in midweek, played Owen up front alongside Ronaldo while Raul dropped back on to the left side of midfield. 

His gamble took just seven minutes to pay off when Owen put his side ahead with a coolly-taken strike after some excellent work by Zinedine Zidane and Raul. 

With Valencia coach Claudio Ranieri leaving his talented Argentine playmaker Pablo Aimar on the bench, and influential winger Vicente injured, his team seemed bereft of ideas in attack. 

Real keeper Iker Casillas denied Valencia an equaliser just before the hour when he pulled off a superb full-length save to stop a shot from David Albelda from the edge of the area. 

Garcia Remon responded by strengthening his midfield with the introduction of Santiago Solari for Owen on the hour and it was just enough to keep the improving Valencia at bay. 

Alessandro Del Piero struck twice as Juventus extended their lead at the top of Serie A to six points, adds a report from Milan. 

Fabio Capello?s side struggled during the first half before Del Piero, who has been sidelined with an Achilles tendon injury, provided the breakthrough eight minutes after the break. Brazilian Emerson crossed and Del Piero pounced on Zlatan Ibrahimovic?s header down to fire Juve in front. 

Del Piero doubled the lead seven minutes later when he drove home a right-foot shot after good work from overlapping full-back Jonathan Zebina. 

Although Siena continued to cause Juve some difficulties, Mauro Camoranesi made sure of their sixth win from seven games when he headed home a cross from Del Piero. 

The result moves Juventus on to 19 points, with champions Milan on 13. 

Ten-men Cagliari hung on for a 2-2 draw at Atalanta leaving the Bergamo club still without a win. 

French Champions League contenders had mixed fortunes on Saturday as Ligue 1 leaders Olympique Lyon were held to a goalless draw at second from bottom Istres while Paris St Germain defeated lowly AC Ajaccio 1-0, say reports from Nice. 

Young midfielder Fabrice Pancrate headed in PSG?s only goal after only 10 minutes but Pedro Pauleta had three clear chances and Danijel Ljuboja hit the bar in the second half. The win takes PSG to 13th place on 13 points. 

Lyon, who have not lost in all competitions since May, lead the standings with 23 points from 11 games.

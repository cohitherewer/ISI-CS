 Ponting out of 2nd Test too

 Ricky Ponting 

Melbourne: Australia captain Ricky Ponting will miss the first two Tests of the series against India starting next week because of a broken thumb, Cricket Australia (CA) team doctor Trefor James said. The 29-year-old saw a specialist in Sydney on Thursday. 

?The bone seems to be repairing well and there has been no change in the status of the injury,? James said in a CA statement. 

?Ricky will visit the specialist again on October 14, and with the injury progressing at its current rate, we expect he?ll be available for the third Test in Nagpur (October 26-30).? 

Ponting said he had been expecting the news. 

?I?m obviously shattered that I won?t be part of the series until at least the halfway mark, but it?s an outcome I was prepared for.? 

The second of four Tests starts on October 14 in Chennai after the first match in Bangalore. 

Ponting fractured his left thumb while fielding at slip during this month?s Champions Trophy semi-final defeat by hosts England.

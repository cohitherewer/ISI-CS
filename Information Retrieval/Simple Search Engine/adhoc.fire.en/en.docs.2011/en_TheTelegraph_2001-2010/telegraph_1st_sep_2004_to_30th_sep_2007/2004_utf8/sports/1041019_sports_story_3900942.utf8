 A ?leash? on selectors

Lahore: National selectors will be specifically included in the Code of Conduct banning public criticism of umpires or their decisions, the International Cricket Council (ICC) decided at the weekend during an ICC executive committee meeting. 

[This obviously is a fallout of Pakistan chief selector Wasim Bari?s stinging comments over umpire David Shepherd?s officiating in the tri-series final in Holland]. 

In a statement, the ICC said the present Code of Conduct did not include selectors. 

?The umpires have the most difficult job in the game and we must protect their decisions from unwarranted criticism,? ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed told reporters. 

Speed said umpires were required to make difficult decisions for six hours a day and were under constant scrutiny by TV commentators, players and the media. 

?We feel they have the most physically and mentally demanding job in any sport,? he said.

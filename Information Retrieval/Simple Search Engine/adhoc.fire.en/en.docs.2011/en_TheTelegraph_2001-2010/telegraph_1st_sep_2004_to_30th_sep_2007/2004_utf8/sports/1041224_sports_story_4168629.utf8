 Bogota: Luis Fernando Montoya, former coach of Colombian club Once Caldas, was admitted to intensive care late on Wednesday after being shot twice in the neck in an apparent robbery attempt, according to police.

 Montoya was taken to the Las Americas clinic in the city of Medellin, where he was put on artificial respiration and underwent neurological tests. Witnesses said Montoya was shot when he resisted two men who tried to rob his sister after she had withdrawn cash from an ATM.

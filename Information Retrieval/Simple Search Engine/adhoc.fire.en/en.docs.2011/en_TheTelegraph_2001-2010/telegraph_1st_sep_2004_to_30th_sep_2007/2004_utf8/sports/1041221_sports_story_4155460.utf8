The Telegraph - Calcutta

 TFA crowned champions

A CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: A fitter and faster Tata Football Academy (TFA) annexed the 16th Lal Bahadur Shastri Memorial football title with an emphatic 2-0 victory over Bengal Mumbai Football club (BMFC) in the final here Monday. 

A goal in each half by strikers P.C. Lalwanpuia and Vimal Pariyar enabled TFA win their first trophy this season. It also avenged their 1-2 defeat by BMFC in a group B league match a week back. TFA earned Rs 20,000 for this win. 

In the final TFA relied on quick counter-attacks to harass the BMFC defence. Tight man-marking by their defenders Chandrashekhar and Harmanjot Singh helped TFA neutralise the attacking thrust of BMFC?s Nigerian striker Innocent Umesegha. 

In the 23rd minute, TFA went ahead. Pariyar dodged past defender Jaspreet Singh and sent a measured cross to Lalwanpuia who managed to home in on his second try. 

In the 63rd minute TFA scored due to Pariyar?s opportunism. Left wing back Parminder Singh?s diagonal found an onrushing Satish Kumar who trapped and shot goalwards from the top of the box. Goalkeeper Ehtesham parried the shot but in a trice Pariyar, following up, flicked in the rebound. 

After the match TFA?s coach Ranjan Chowdhury said if negotiations with clubs in Germany and Italy (including AC Milan) bear fruit, four-five players of the academy will be send there next season for a year?s advanced training. 

Among those chosen are striker Vimal Pariyar, goalkeeper Shilton Pal and defenders Warandeep Singh and Gurjinder Singh.

 Deepak, Bimal back in squad

New Delhi: Ace forward Deepak Thakur has been recalled, after suffering an injury during the Athens Olympics, for the two-Test series against France. Gagan Ajit Singh and Prabhjot Singh, however, do not find a mention in the squad announced on Sunday. 

Also making a comeback is midfielder Bimal Lakra, who was eliminated from the Olympic squad. Interestingly, his younger brother Birendra Lakra has also been selected to the national squad. 

Several key players have been rested. They include first choice goalkeeper Adrian D?Souza and midfielders Viren Rasquinha, Ignace Tirkey and Vikram Pillay. 

Skipper Dilip Tirkey was also likely to be rested but it was felt that his experience was essential in defence. 

The Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) has recalled goalkeeping coach A. B. Subbiah. He will be assistant to Jagbir Singh who takes over from German Gerhard Rach, who is on a holiday back home. Former international goalkeeper Subbiah, it may be recalled, was sacked as just eight months ago after the Olympic qualifiers in Madrid in March this year. 

India will use the series against France to try out new players and Jagbir said that his side will play attacking hockey with four forwards. Both matches are being played in Delhi. 

According to acting chief coach Jagbir Singh, ?the new players have been chosen on the basis of their current form in recent domestic tournaments in Delhi and Punjab.? 

The quartet of newcomers include Army XI?s striker Sosan Topno, Tamil Nadu?s winger Gopi, IOC midfielder Nitin Kumar and Indian Airlines? winger Birendra Lakra. 

Jagbir is upset that so far striker Sandeep Michael and defender Harpal Singh had not reported for the national camp in Delhi. 

France, who will tour India for the first time, are preparing for the European Cup to be held in Leipzig Germany, next year. 

THE SQUAD 

Goalkeepers: Devesh Chauhan, A.C. Kutappa and Srijesh; Defenders: Dilip Tirkey (captain), William Xalco and Sandeep Singh; Midfielders: V.S. Vinay, Arjun Halappa, Vivek Gupta, Probodh Tirkey, Bimal Lakra and Nitin Kumar; Forwards: Deepak Thakur, Tushar Khandekar, Hariprasad, Sosan Topno, Gopi, Birendra Lakra and Adam Sinclair; Coach: Jagbir Singh; Assistant coach: A.B.

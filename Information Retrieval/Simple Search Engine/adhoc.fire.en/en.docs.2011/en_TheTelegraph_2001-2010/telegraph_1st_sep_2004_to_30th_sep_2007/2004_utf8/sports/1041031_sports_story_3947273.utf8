 Portsmouth shock United 2-0

London: Manchester United, who revived their title hopes with last week?s 2-0 win over Arsenal, came down to earth with a bump as they lost by the same score at Portsmouth after second-half goals by David Unsworth from the penalty spot and Aiyegbeni Yakubu. 

United missed a handful of chances in the first half at Fratton Park. Rio Ferdinand pulled down Yakubu in the box and Unsworth lashed in the resulting penalty in the 53rd minute. 

United roared back and laid siege to the home goal. Ronaldo hit a post with a header, while Wayne Rooney and Paul Scholes also went close. 

But Portsmouth broke in the 72nd minute and a header by Yakubu doubled their lead. 

An injury-time goal by Dutch Robin van Persie saved Arsenal from a second successive defeat on Saturday, earning the champions a 2-2 home draw with Southampton. 

Arsenal remain on top with 26 points, the same as Chelsea while third-placed Everton lost ground on 23 after a 1-1 home draw with Aston Villa. 

Middlesbrough moved up to fourth on 18 with a 2-1 win at Charlton Athletic. Bolton Wanderers, also on 18, host Newcastle United on Monday while Manchester United have 17.

Bangalore: Virender Sehwag showed signs of regaining form with a swashbuckling 146 as he and Yuvraj Singh (115) guided India senior team to a five-wicket win over India A in the four-day practice game on Friday. 

Sehwag, who has been miserably out of form in recent one-day tournaments, smashed nine sixes and 13 fours to demolish the rival attack ? particularly targeting spinner Murali Kartik, in his 178-ball knock. 

With Yuvraj, who hit 15 boundaries and a six on his way to the century, the Delhi batsman put on 279 runs in 340 balls for the first wicket that set the stage for a successful run chase against India A, who had overshadowed the seniors in the first three days. 

Sourav Ganguly-led India seniors reached the victory target of 387 in 86.5 overs without much difficulty thanks to some lusty hitting from the duo. 

Sehwag was specially harsh on Kartik, hitting him for 34 including five sixes and a four in his 19th over seeking to prove a point that he had not lost touch and was in a class of his own. 

Yuvraj played equally well and the India A bowlers toiled hard for a breakthrough before their skipper Dinesh Mongia brought himself on. 

Sehwag finally gave a catch to Shib Shankar Paul and one run later Yuvraj also departed with Ashish Nehra, taking a diving catch at point off the same bowler. 

Parthiv Patel (44 not out) and Harbhajan Singh (17 not out) saw them through, and ensured that Ganguly, who was attending the selection committee meeting, did not have to come out to bat.

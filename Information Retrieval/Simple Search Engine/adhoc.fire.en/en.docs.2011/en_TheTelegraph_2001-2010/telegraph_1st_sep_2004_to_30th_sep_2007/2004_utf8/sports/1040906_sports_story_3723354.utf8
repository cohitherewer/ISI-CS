 Kasprowicz poses selection dilemma 

 Kasprowiczs form is a threat to Brett Lee 

London: Australia captain Ricky Ponting admitted the form of Michael Kasprowicz had left the world champions with a problem ahead of the ICC Champions Trophy. 

Normally the world champions first-choice attack would feature the pace trio of Glenn McGrath, Jason Gillespie and Brett Lee with support from leg-spinner Brad Hogg and a clutch of allrounders. 

But Kasprowicz, 32, reinforced his growing claims as a frontline, rather than back-up performer, by taking five for 47 in Australias thrilling 10-run one-day International warm-up win against Pakistan at Lords on Saturday. 

By contrast Lee, the fastest bowler in the Australian squad, finished with expensive figures of one for 67 from 10 overs. It was only his second top-flight bowling stint since undergoing ankle surgery in March. 

Kasper obviously bowled very well today, Brett maybe not as well as he would have liked but it was his first hit-out with the new ball, said Ponting. 

Everyone who played the game will be better for this workout, theres no doubt about that. 

But I dont know if it makes us any closer to settling on a line-up, or not, added Ponting whose team open the Champions Trophy with a match against rank outsiders United States at the Hampshire Rose Bowl on September 13. 

Weve got one practice game (against Hampshire) before the US and well work out how everyone is going before that practice game, he said. 

If it looks like were happy with how everyone is going we might rotate a couple of guys in and out for that game. Then well hit the US with what we think is our full-strength side, our best team. 

Its a tough one, whoever misses out of the first game of the ICC or even the second one is going to be very unlucky, Ponting admitted. 

Bretts work before he was injured was fantastic but Kasper has come in and performed in almost every games he played. Today, to get the wickets when he did, was very satisfying for him and the team. 

Theres going to be some tough selections to be made, theres no doubt about it. And with todays game its not getting any easier. 

Australias latest win also owed much to Andrew Symonds 104 not out off 103 balls. 

Ponting has no doubt Symonds is one of several players in the Australian side who can replace Michael Bevan as a finisher of an innings.

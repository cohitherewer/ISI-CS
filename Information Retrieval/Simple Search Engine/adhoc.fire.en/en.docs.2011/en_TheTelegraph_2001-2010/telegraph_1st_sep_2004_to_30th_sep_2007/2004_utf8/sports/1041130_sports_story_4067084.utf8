The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Bell pleasantly surprised

Harare: England batsman Ian Bell said on Monday he is ?pleasantly surprised? with his Zimbabwe experience. 

?We are very comfortable at the moment,? Bell told a news conference in Harare, where England won the first of four one-day Internationals by five wickets on Sunday. 

?I didn?t know what to expect in Zimbabwe, and I?ve been pleasantly surprised. 

Bell made his one-day debut for England on Sunday, and top-scored with 75. 

?It was good to play and great to get my cap,? Bell said. ?It?s a big opportunity for me with a few of the regular players not here.? 

Bell opened the batting and shared a second-wicket stand of 111 with captain Michael Vaughan, who scored 56. 

?Michael just tried to make me comfortable and confident,? Bell remarked.

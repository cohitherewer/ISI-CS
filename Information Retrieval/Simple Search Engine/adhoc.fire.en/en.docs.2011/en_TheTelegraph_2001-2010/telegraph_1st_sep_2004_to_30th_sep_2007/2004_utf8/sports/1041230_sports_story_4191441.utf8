 Rohit throws title race wide open 

Bikaner: International Master norm holder G. Rohit provided a twist in the tale when he defeated overnight leader S. Arun Prasad in the 10th and penultimate round of the 27th Asian junior chess championship here on Wednesday. 

Prasad, who appeared set for title, is now sharing the lead with former champion Deepan Chakravarthy on seven points after the latter defeated T.U. Navin Kanna. 

Just half-a-point adrift of the joint leaders are national junior champion G.N. Gopal, Arghyadip Das, Abhijeet Gupta and Rohit with 6.5 points each. 

With just one round left, the stage is set for a nail biting finale as Arun Prasad will be under pressure to perform in the last match. 

The former sub-junior champion has been pitted against Nguyen Van Huy of Vietnam while Charavarthy has to tackle Rohit. 

In case of a tie between the two, Arun Prasad will win title as he has better tie-break score. 

In the girls? section, women Grandmaster Dronavalli Harika yet again joined Hoang Thi Bao Tram in the lead on 8.5 points after the latter was held to a draw by Siti Zulkaikha of Malaysia. (PTI)

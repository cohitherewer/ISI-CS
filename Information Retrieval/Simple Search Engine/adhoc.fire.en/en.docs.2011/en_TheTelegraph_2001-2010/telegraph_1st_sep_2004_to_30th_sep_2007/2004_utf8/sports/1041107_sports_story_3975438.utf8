 NZ coach wants better batting

Dhaka: New Zealand coach John Bracewell said he expects a better batting performance in the third and final one-day International against Bangladesh on Sunday. 

The coach expressed concern with the way his batsmen struggled to overhaul the hosts? paltry total of 146 in the second one-dayer on Friday. New Zealand eventually made 148 for loss of seven wickets to clinch the three-match ODI series 2-0. 

?Our batting was not disciplined (on Friday). We want to finish the series with a good performance in the last match,? Bracewell said on Saturday. 

He said the Bangladesh series provided the boys good practice ahead of the tour of Australia. 

?We started the series as a preparation for the Australian tour. There?s a lot of positives in our boys? performance which will help them perform well against the Aussies,? the coach said. 

Bangladesh, meanwhile, will be without regular captain Habibul Bashar, who has been ruled out after injuring his toe during the second ODI. 

Wicketkeeper Khaled Mashud will be stand-in captain, while middleorder batsman Alok Kapali will be Bashar?s replacement in the 13-member team. 

Bashar suffered a hairline fracture on his left toe, trying to block a toe-crushing delivery from James Franklin in Friday?s match. 

Bashar had also missed last month?s two-Test series against New Zealand due to injury. The visitors won the series 2-0.

 Calcutta: Setting to rest 

 all speculation, Team India captain Sourav Ganguly made 

 it clear on Wednesday that he will play Bengal?s crucial 

 Ranji Trophy tie against Madhya Pradesh, starting at the 

 Eden on Friday, but will not lead the side. 

?I will play this match, but Rohan will stay captain,? Sourav said on Wednesday. 

According to Sourav he hasn?t managed to speak to Rohan but expects to do that on Thursday. 

After veteran spinner Utpal Chatterjee made himself available, it was Devang Gandhi?s turn to come forward and help the side. Devang, who was out of action after the Gujarat match has proved his fitness and is geared up to get back to business. 

Devang, who had a session with former Bengal trainer Ranadeep Moitra this morning, was certified fit by CAB doctor Shanti Ranjan Dasgupta later in the evening. ?It is a matter of Bengal?s pride and so I decided to play this match,? Devang said. 

Sourav, who visited the Eden in the evening, had a discussion with coach Karsan Ghavri and the players. 

Sourav, who was approached by the CAB to play after the side suffered four defeats in-a-row, is expected to bat at the No. 5 position. Bengal needs to collect at least two points from the match in order to avoid relegation from the Elite Group. 

It was learnt that Devang will come down the order. Shib Shankar Paul and Ranadeb Bose likely to be the two pacers.

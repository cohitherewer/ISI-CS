 Eric Simons resigns, Jennings to take over

 Simons feels there needs to be a spark in the side 

Durban: Eric Simons buckled under mounting pressure and resigned as South Africa?s coach on Friday after a string of poor results. 

?At some point one takes accountability and there needed to be a change,? Simons said. ?There needs to be a spark in the side.? 

Former wicketkeeper Ray Jennings was appointed caretaker coach until May 2005 on Friday. Jennings takes over four weeks before the South African squad leave to play two Tests in India. 

?The job will be exciting, but daunting to start off with,? Jennings said. ?The tour to India will be really scary, but that?s also where the excitement lies ? to see if I can get the job done. It?s one hell of a challenge first up.? 

Simons became coach in June 2002, since when South Africa have slipped from second to sixth place in the International Cricket Council Test rankings and from second to sixth on the one-day ladder. 

Simons, whose contract was due to run until next April, also presided over South Africa?s first-round exit from the 2003 World Cup. 

Team manager Tim Southey?s contract was also terminated, the UCBSA said in a statement. 

The final nails in Simon?s coffin were a 1-5 loss in a one-day series in New Zealand in February and March, and a 0-5 one-day whitewash in Sri Lanka in August. South Africa also lost their first Test in New Zealand in drawing that series, while losing the Sri Lankan Test series.

Calcutta: Indias under-pressure coach Stephen Constantine feels the World Cup qualifier against Japan at the Salt Lake Stadium, slated for Wednesday next, should have been played in the afternoon to exploit home advantage to the hilt. 

Talking to reporters on Wednesday, the Anglo-Cypriot coach pointed out that the hot and humid conditions might put the Japanese into difficulty. Every team takes home advantage. Japan could have found it difficult to negotiate the hot conditions here if the match was held in the afternoon, he lamented. 

The match, incidentally, is kicking off at 5.35 pm. 

Meanwhile, Debjit Ghosh has been named the captain after Bhaichung Bhutia was ruled out due to injury. The East Bengal player later said: I feel honoured and proud to lead the team against Japan. We all know the job at hand and try our best. 

Debjit also captained the national team during the SAF Cup two years ago. 

But the task is as difficult as climbing a steep mountain. Very few, in fact, fancy Indias chances of pulling off even an iota of surprise against Zicos men. 

Japan are 18 in the Fifa world ranking as against Indias 138. The vast difference in quality and the very fact that India were drubbed 0-7 in the away leg in Japan notwithstanding, Constantine now is counting on certain factors to put a brake on another possible rout. 

According to him, his wards would be in better shape this time around. 

When we went to Japan, it was near the end of home season and the players were tired. But when well take on them here, the players have just begun a season and therefore, will be fresh, Constantine stated. 

Plus, well certainly enjoy a bit of home advantage, specially the crowd. We know the conditions here, players are accustomed to the ground All this will hopefully benefit us, he added. 

Banking on such factors, Constantine promised there would be no repetition of 0-7 margin. We all are determined to put that phase behind and do better this time. Dont forget, Japan are way, way ahead of us. Despite this, well try to put up a good show against them, he said. 

He conceded that injuries to some of his key players like Bhutia and his striking partner Ashim Biswas were blows to him. What can I do? These things are parts of the game and you have to live with them. 

Rennedy Singh, however, said Bhaichungs absence would be felt. Well surely miss him, he said. 

The coach and his players later visited Bhaichung, who underwent a surgery on his right knee but was released from a city clinic on Wednesday morning.

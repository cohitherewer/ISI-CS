The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Only 4 report for practice on Day I

 A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Just four players out of 42 turned out on the first day of Bengal?s preparation for the Santosh Trophy. Coach Syed Nayeemuddin waited for the number to grow, and ultimately had to return without practising at the SAI complex on Wednesday. 

?One day is lost,? lamented the Dronacharya. He also blamed the inclement weather for the poor turnout. ?Hope Thursday would be different.? 

The four who reported for practice on Wednesday were Dinesh Swar and Gauranga Dutta from Tollygunge Agragami, Kaushik Prasad from Calcutta Port Trust and Mohammedan AC?s Arup Sarkar. 

Most of the players from the big three are busy playing the IFA Shield while the national probables have left for the camp currently on in Goa. ?This should have been the premier tournament with nearly all the states participating. Instead you don?t even get your best players around,? the coach rued. 

Bengal in semis 

Bengal routed Madhya Pradesh 11-0 to move into the last four of the Mir Iqbal Trophy under-16 football tournament in Goa on Wednesday. According to information received here, Sudip Banik scored four, Ayub Hossain and Chiranjit Ghosh struck a brace each, while Sujauddin Mollah, Sukumar Roy and Bhargabh Guha netted one apiece.

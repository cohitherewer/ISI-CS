 Nayan Mongia calls it a day

Vadodara: Peeved at being dropped from the Baroda Ranji team, former Indian wicketkeeper Nayan Mongia announced his retirement from the game. 

Mongia, whose international career was stalled after he was named in the match fixing scandal in 2000, said he was prompted to quit the game after being ignored for selection in the Ranji team. 

The former international said he had already decided to retire after the current Ranji season. 

?I had arrived at my decision earlier, but the shocking decision prompted me to take the step,? Mongia said.

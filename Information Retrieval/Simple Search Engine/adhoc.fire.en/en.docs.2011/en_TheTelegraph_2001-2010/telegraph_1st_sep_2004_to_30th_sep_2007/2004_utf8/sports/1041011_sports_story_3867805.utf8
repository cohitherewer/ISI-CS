The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Sehwag let off with fine only

 - KSCA announces punishment because of high court order 

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI 

Bangalore: Chief Match Referee Ranjan Madugalle 

took a rather lenient view of Virender Sehwag?s dissent on the fourth afternoon, 

after being given out leg-before by Billy Bowden here, and just fined him 65 per 

cent of his fee. 

Sehwag, of course, pleaded guilty ? that he didn?t 

have a choice was reported by The Telegraph on Sunday ? to the charge of 

?serious dissent.? Apparently, his attitude at the disciplinary hearing helped 

in his getting away with a light sentence. 

The opener, mind you, could have been banned for one Test. That, it may be recalled, did happen on the 2001-02 tour of South Africa when the highly insensitive Mike Denness was Match Referee. 

Briefly, Denness? action had threatened England?s tour of India later that season. 

Incidentally, thanks to the Madras high court?s order on the Board?s office-bearers, the latest punishment could only be announced on the fifth morning through the Karnataka State Cricket Association. 

It wouldn?t surprise if Madugalle, a former Sri Lankan 

captain, felt exasperated.

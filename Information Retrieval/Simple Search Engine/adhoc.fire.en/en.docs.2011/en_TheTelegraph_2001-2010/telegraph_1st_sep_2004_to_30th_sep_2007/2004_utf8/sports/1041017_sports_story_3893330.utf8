The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Meet pulled out of LA

Los Angeles: The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) has reopened bidding for its 2006 World Cup after a dispute over taxes resulted in the sport?s governing body pulling the event from Los Angeles. 

?In working through the contract terms, we came to an impasse over the withholding of taxes out of the prize money,? said Michael Roth, a spokesman for the Anschutz Entertainment Group that owns and operates the Home Depot Center in suburban Carson. 

The Home Depot Center, a 125-acre sports complex on the campus of the California State University Dominguez Hills which also includes a 27,000-capacity soccer stadium that is home to the Los Angeles Galaxy, was awarded the IAAF?s quadrennial team event two years ago in the hope of generating more interest in athletics in the United States. However, a contract was never signed. 

?While the US continues to be a conveyor belt for athlete talent, the IAAF has not held a major world championship event there since 1991,? IAAF spokesman Nick Davies said. 

?We thought that the World Cup ? with its team-based format ? was exactly the sort of track event that would appeal to the American public and help regenerate interest for major international track events in the States. 

?It?s a shame, because the US has so many fantastic athletes, but now they won?t get the chance to compete in front of a home crowd.? 

The World Cup has never been staged in the United States. (AP)

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Jeev tied at 16th spot

New Delhi: Jeev Milkha Singh fired his third straight under-par round to climb one notch higher on the leader-board even as fellow Indian Jyoti Randhawa slid into oblivion after the penultimate round of the ABC Championship 2004 in Hyohgo, Japan on Saturday. 

Jeev, who shot a one-under 71 was tied 16th at five-under 211 while Randhawa, after a dismal round of 76, slipped to tied-46th, according to information received here on Saturday. The tournament threw up a third leader in as many days with M. Inoue returning a well-compiled 66 to nudge two strokes ahead of the field at 14-under 202. 

Jeev had anything but a happy initial few holes. The 32-year-old dropped shots on the third and fifth to go two over early on. He, however, made up in style with a hattrick of birdies. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 France?s turn to beat India 

A CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: India?s tale of woes continued as they were defeated 1-3 by France in the first hockey Test on Monday. 

This is India?s first defeat against France in 14 years. The last French victory was in the 199 70 Lahore World Cup, when they surprised India 2-1. 

India, ranked fifth in the world, were complacent against their opponent, who are way below on 18th, said acting national coach Jagbir Singh. 

Using counter-attacking tactics effectively, France launched four attacks in the first half and scored thrice. As early as the eighth minute, playmaker Jerome Branquard?s through pass was flicked across the face of the goal by winger Fredric Soyez to an unmarked Nicolas Gaillard, who slammed in. 

In the 25th minute came the goal of the match. Skipper and midfielder Antoine Moreau, who plays as a professional in Spain, dribbled past two defenders and sounded the board with a blistering shot. 

France further added to the humiliation at the half-hour mark. This time left winger Thomas Rasin took advantage of Sandeep Singh?s slow movement on the right and surging into the D let fly a shot. Goalkeeper Devesh Chauhan parried it partly, but Sebastian Jean, who was following up, placed it in. 

Sandeep reduced the margin, with a low drive off a penalty corner at the stroke of half time. In the second half, India got three more penalty corners, but Sandeep was off-target. India?s frustration was evident when skipper Dilip Tirkey and Sandeep were both shown the yellow card for rough play.

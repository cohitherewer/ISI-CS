The Telegraph - Calcutta

 We can be heroes: Smith

 Graeme Smith 

London: South Africa captain Graeme Smith said his side had the opportunity to become heroes during the Champions Trophy. The Proteas come here on the back of a 5-0 one-day whitewashing in Sri Lanka. 

But Smith, still one of the youngest captains in world cricket at the age of 23, insisted that far from being downcast South Africa would use the Sri Lankan series to inspire them to greater efforts in England. 

We had a really rusty tour in Sri Lanka, smith said at the squads hotel here ahead of their opening match on Sunday against minnows Bangladesh at Edgbaston. 

We didnt perform to the standards we would have liked. We come here a team with a lot of pride hurt. 

The team is obviously highly motivated because of the way we performed and we come here being big underdogs, added Smith. South Africa face West Indies in the second match at The Oval on September 18. 

Hopefully that can play into our hands and hopefully we can get a really dominant performance in against Bangladesh and move on to The Oval and do well. 

Its a tournament where if you won four games you are heroes again, Smith added. 

Its a knockout tournament and it will be interesting to see how far weve come since the World Cup. 

Smith stressed that the experienced Shaun Pollocks ability to move the ball late would be vital to the teams chances. 

Obviously swing bowlers are crucial. Shaun Pollock will be crucial for us up front. Hes been a world-class performer for a number of years. 

And the top four in the batting department have to produce the goods up front. Maybe the first 15 overs wont be as dominant as in the past. You can score a lot of runs at the death. (AFP)

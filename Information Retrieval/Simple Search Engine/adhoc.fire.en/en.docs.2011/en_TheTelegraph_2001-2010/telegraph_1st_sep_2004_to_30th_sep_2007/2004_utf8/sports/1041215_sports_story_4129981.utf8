The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Inzy, Youhana hold the key: McGrath

 - FIRST TEST 

- Aussie speedster itching to bowl at the WACA 

 McGrath feels Pakistan will give them a fight 

Perth: Glenn McGrath said captain Inzamam-ul Haq and his deputy Yusuf Youhana were the keys to Pakistan?s batting line-up. 

McGrath, who will spearhead a likely three-pronged Australian pace attack in the first Test starting Thursday, said the pair were world-class. 

?To me there?s two standouts in their batting line-up. There?s Yusuf Youhana and Inzamam-ul Haq,? he said. 

?I don?t know if I?ll come out and say I?m targeting any one player, but they are definitely the keys. If we can knock those two over it will make our job easier.? 

Despite not being in top form so far on this tour, Inzamam looked dangerous in the match against Western Australia last week before being dismissed by a spectacular catch. 

McGrath said Pakistan were a young team who could be inconsistent, but that the Australians were not reading anything into their poor results so far. 

?We?ll be prepared for them at the start of the Test, but they (Pakistan) will be a lot tougher. I?m sure they will.? 

McGrath has fond memories of Perth?s WACA ground. He made his Test debut here against New Zealand in 1993-94 and took a hattrick against the West Indies in 2000-2001.

The Aussies seem set to name speedster Brett Lee as 

12th man despite the lively wicket, but McGrath said there was little selectors 

could do given the number of talented pacers in the country. 

He mentioned that the wicket would also help Pakistan?s Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Sami a great deal. 

?The WACA looks like it?s back to its quickest and bounciest and I for one am looking forward to getting out there and bowling,? he remarked. 

?I think he?ll (Shoaib Akhtar) enjoy bowling there... He?ll run in hard and hit the wicket hard.? 

While the hosts have named their 12, Pakistan are still finalising their line-up. 

Off-spinner Shoaib Malik is clear to start after extensive testing on his bowling action was carried out at the University of Western Australia on Monday. The results will not be complete for several days before they are handed to the Pakistan Cricket Board and the International Cricket Council (ICC). 

McGrath said his team had no problem with Malik playing. ?At the end of the day it?s not up to us to judge who should and shouldn?t play ? that?s up to the ICC,? he said. 

Australian opening batsman Matthew Hayden, who was suffering from a hamstring strain, is certain to play on a ground which has special memories for him. 

In his last Test at the WACA in October 2003, he belted a then-world record 380 against Zimbabwe. (AFP)

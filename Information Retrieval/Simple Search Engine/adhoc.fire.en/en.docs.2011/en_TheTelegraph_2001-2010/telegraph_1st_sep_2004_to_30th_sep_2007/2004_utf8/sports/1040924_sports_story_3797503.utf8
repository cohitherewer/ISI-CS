Calcutta: As the Mohun Bagan players sat with heads down after the 2-2 scoreline in their CFL Super Division championship leg match against Mohammedan Sporting at the Salt Lake Stadium on Thursday, Subrata Bhattacharya was firing angers at them. 

Henry Chukwukei surprised Mohun Bagan with an early goal. But Subrata?s team survived the shock and, was heading towards carrying the day following strikes from Abhay Kumar and Dharamjit Singh. However, Henry?s Nigerian teammate, Stanley Festus, had other ideas as he restored parity with just eight minutes to go. 

Mohun Bagan, having played 15 matches, thus joined Ever-Ready atop the league table with 32 points. Mohammedan Sporting took their tally to 24 off 16 outings. 

The fury and frustration from the Mohun Bagan coach, thus, was quite understandable. Because the result meant losing an all-important one-point advantage on the leaderboard and sending the push for regaining the League after a gap of two years into uncertainty. 

More importantly, holders East Bengal (30 off 14 matches) may have got a much-needed boost in their quest for defending the title, particularly after their campaign in the AFC Cup came to an end on Wednesday. 

Subrata admitted to have helped the arch-rivals? cause by failing to beat the black-and-white brigade. ?Our failure should help East Bengal recover from the disappointment of a quarter-final exit in the AFC Cup,? he told the press conference after the match. 

Mohammedan Sporting coach, Mridul Banerjee, also took heart from the fact that his team, by holding Mohun Bagan, had thrown open the competition. ?I?m glad to see my team can be a deciding factor in the League. Because, one point for me today means a recession by one step for the opponents,? he pointed out. 

All said and done, Sunil Chhetri and Co. had only themselves to blame as they exhibited a display of missed chances in the match. The bulk of the blame should be credited to Mohun Bagan?s debutant striker Roberto Mendes Silva. There were moments of sparkles from the Brazilian, known as Beto, but he looked na?ve, too sophisticated, in forcing things to happen in and around the box. 

One match shouldn?t be good enough to judge a player, but a few eyebrows will certainly be raised whenever any claim to compare him with Jose Ramirez Barreto will come to the discussion table. 

Beto, however, had a golden opportunity to script an I-came-I-saw-and-I-conquered story, but his poor finishing surely let his team down. Had things went about according to his wish, Beto should have left the ground with at least a hattrick behind him. 

?He tends to play a bit of finer football. But to survive here, he has to be physical,? Subrata opined about his new recruit. ?I want to give him 3-4 on a scale of 10,? was Mridul?s assessment. 

Henry?s 20-minute warning to Mohun Bagan, however, was a captivating moment in the match. Jiten Rai?s brilliant forward through found the Nigerian striker in between Dulal Biswas and Prasanta Dora. He outpaced the Mohun Bagan defender and neatly placed the ball past the goalkeeper on the move. 

Mohammedan Sporting?s joy was, however, shortlived as the equaliser came within four minutes. Beto fed Abhay inside the box and his placement went in after brushing the inside of the near post. 

Mohun Bagan went into lead seven minutes into the second half. Manitombi Singh, who replaced the Mohun Bagan scorer, made his presence felt as his pass across the face of the goal saw Dharamjit guiding home from near. 

In between Beto dashed, dribbled and drove, but failed to find the target. A bit of complacency also seeped into the team. This came to the fore in the 71st minute when Henry easily forced his way out of Eduardo Coelho?s challenge but a fine diving save from Dora denied the Nigerian. 

In the 83rd minute, Coelho again failed to clear a Naushad Moosa free-kick and Festus was lurking nearby to drive home the equaliser out of a melee.

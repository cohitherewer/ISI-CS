The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Leander coaxes Martina to continue

AMITAVA DAS GUPTA

 Navratilova is eager to regain Aussie Open title 

Calcutta: Mahesh Bhupathi pulled off a coup the other day, ?signing up? the legendary Todd Woodbridge as his partner for 2005. Now, it?s Leander Paes? turn to spring a surprise ? he has convinced Martina Navratilova to come out of ?retirement?. 

The 47-year-old legend had announced that she had enjoyed more than an extended run in the game?s top flight and wouldn?t be playing any more competitive tennis in 2005. But she hadn?t contended with the persuasive powers of her Indian partner. 

?I have been after her from June? trying to coax her to continue for at least one more year. It was only a couple of days ago that she finally gave her consent,? Paes informed The Telegraph from Mumbai on Monday. 

The Australian Open tops the Grand Old Lady?s priority list. ?We won it in 2003, we were runner-up this year? Martina and I are determined to win the crown back next month,? Paes said, making no effort to camouflage his excitement. 

?Yeah, I am very excited? playing with a legend like Martina is always a great experience. I?ll never get bored playing with her,? quipped Paes, who shares two Grand Slam titles with Navratilova. 

Paes? search for a new doubles partner is also over. He will be playing with Croat Nenad Zimonjic the entire 2005 season on the ATP Tour. 

?Nenad is a tall and strong guy with young blood? he has a big Ivanisevic-like serve, plays both singles and doubles,? Paes said. ?He falls into my slot perfectly, I was looking for all these qualities.? 

The age factor interested Paes the most. ?I was looking for a younger partner who can take some extra responsibility if needed.? While Paes is 31, the six-foot-three Zimonjic is 27. 

Paes had noticed Zimonjic a few years back, but it was at the Delray Beach tournament in 2003 that the Croat?s skills really impressed the senior pro. ?We were playing together at Delray Beach and we won the crown. 

In January this year, Nenad and Elena Bovina beat Martina and me at the Australian Open mixed doubles final. I clearly saw what he was capable of,? Paes remarked. 

Zimonjic also played this year?s Wimbledon final with Julian Knowle, the Croat-Austrian pair bowing in four sets to Woodbridge and Jonas Bjorkman. 

Paes and Zimonjic will be starting their new ?journey? in the very first week of the new year ? at the Indian Open in Chennai, where Paes will be playing singles too as wild card. 

?Nenad is willing to play 27-28 weeks a year, that was another positive factor which helped us forge a partnership,? said Paes. One of the reasons Paes had to break off with David Rikl, his partner for the last two seasons, was the Czech?s unwillingness to play more than 15-16 weeks in 2005. 

Paes has 30 career doubles titles, Zimonjic eight. The Indian finished the year ranked No. 13, the Croat No. 18. Not the greatest of figures those, compared to some other hot teams like Bhupathi-Woodbridge. But Paes is famous for disregarding numbers and reputations. He will be out to carve a new identity with a new partner.

 Silverstone sees a breather

London: The British Grand Prix has been included provisionally on the 2005 Formula One calendar. The international automobile federation (FIA) published a draft 19-race calendar Wednesday which included the British, French and San Marino Grands Prix, all of which have faced the axe. 

Silverstone owners, the British Racing Drivers? Club (BRDC) have until December to conclude negotiations with Formula One commercial rights holder Bernie Ecclestone. 

FIA will finalise the 2005 calendar when their World Motor Sport Council meets on December 10. BRDC chief executive Alex Hooton warned that a resolution must come soon if preparations for the race are not to be compromised. (afp)

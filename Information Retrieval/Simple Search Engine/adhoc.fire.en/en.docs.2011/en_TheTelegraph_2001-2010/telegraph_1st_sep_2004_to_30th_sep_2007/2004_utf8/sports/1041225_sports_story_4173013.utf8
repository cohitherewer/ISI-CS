 Fischer wants ?deportation? to Iceland

Tokyo: Fugitive chess master Bobby Fischer, who is fighting deportation to the US, Friday asked Japan to allow him to go to Iceland, which has offered him a home. 

Fischer?s spirits are high since Iceland last week extended a residency permit to the former world chess champion, who has been detained by Japanese immigration authorities for almost half-a-year, his lawyer said. 

Fischer, 61, is wanted in the United States for violating economic sanctions against Yugoslavia by playing a chess game there in 1992. He has been held in Japan since July when he was stopped with a passport that US officials said was invalid. 

His lawyers filed documents Friday, including a hand-written letter by Fischer, with Japanese immigration officials seeking that he either be allowed to leave for Iceland on his own, or that he be deported to the North-Atlantic country rather than to the US. 

?He?s happy... I think his psychological condition is much better,? Fischer?s lawyer Masako Suzuki said. 

But Suzuki added that Japanese immigration officials did not appear to be ready to send him out of the country any time soon. ?They don?t appear to be handling the case very swiftly.? 

?I hereby demand an autonomous departure from Japan to Iceland,? Fischer wrote in his message dated Wednesday. ?However, if that?s too difficult then I accept that I be deported to Iceland. Please examine both possibilities at the same time.? 

Later Friday, immigration authorities told Fischer?s lawyers they were discussing the request to allow him to go to Iceland but no decision would be announced before the end of this year. ?We strongly protest with the justice ministry for delaying or handling this issue in an incomprehensible way,? the lawyers said. 

Japanese authorities had ordered that Fischer be deported to the US, but a court granted an injunction in September until it ruled on a lawsuit seeking to have the order quashed. Immigration officials have not ruled out the possibility of changing Fischer?s destination, but have said that it would be difficult since he lacked a valid passport.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

BCCI events affecting Team India

Over the top 

Bishan Singh Bedi

Cricket India?s present is tense, and future in the 

hands of the judiciary. All thanks to a couple of former BCCI presidents whose 

own performance at the helm was nothing short of shoddy.

The great institution called cricket is being mauled 

thus. I could have easily named the ?gentlemen? but my cricketing background prevents 

me from touching them even with a barge pole. Suffice to say that all this trauma 

could have been easily avoided had ego (edging god out) not played its part.

We Indians are ever so gullible. But not the Aussies 

who observed the state of Indian cricket administration, much to their delight. 

Quite clearly, the Aussies enjoyed a laughable advantage even before a single 

ball had been bowled in the Bangalore Test.

Glenn McGrath?s admission that he never knows when 

Cricket Australia?s administrators deliberate on the game?s progress and policies 

should be an eye-opener for our cricketers as well as followers of the game.

If anybody is going to suggest that the BCCI members? 

individual vendetta ought not have any effect on the performance of the Indian 

team, then I stand guilty of watching a different ball game from what the Indian 

team is playing.

India?s cricketers are very intelligent when it comes 

to calling a donkey an uncle. Oops! I might have slipped into a Patiala pool. 

But seriously, how do we expect Indians to perform at their best when behind-the-scene 

activities are so filthy and downright malicious.

The one-point agenda of people who have dragged cricket 

to court is to oust one person. Could they not have waited for another September 

to come? All these in the platinum jubilee year of Indian cricket!! This reflects 

how the mighty can be petty. 

Also, in the present context the most visible sub-committee 

of the BCCI ? the selection committee ? is already feeling the heat. My intuition 

tells me that the Indian captain is the king of all that he surveys like no other 

Indian captain before and hopefully after.

And none of the national selectors seem to have any 

intestine to stand up to a lot of nonsense in the garb of talent or promise. Good 

luck, to an assertive and presumably aggressive captain.

It is all very well to stand up for your personal 

choice for which I am inclined to credit the Indian captain. But surely, the national 

selectors have a job to do. For example, expressing their individual opinions 

in the process of team selection. That doesn?t appear to be the case. I suspect 

(and I hope I am wrong) a few wise men may be sitting on the fence until October 

26. The tragedy is one cannot even call them (jokers) because whatever is happening 

in Indian cricket is not funny.

The loss in Bangalore was attributed to far too much 

one-day cricket. And surprisingly, not total unpreparedness. India?s newly appointed 

batting consultant is convinced the mindset of the players is revolving around 

the shorter version of the game. But John Wright, the official coach, is silent 

on the subject. Very cleverly, Wright allows the captain to tackle the media, 

never mind the conviction part.

The Aussies would have been happy to come out of the 

stifling Chennai humidity with honours intact and plenty of time to relax with 

their family before Nagpur where the local authorities are already giving indications 

of the BCCI?s sorry plight.

This is exactly why I am prompted to make an open 

and humble plea to Mr Sharad Pawar to withdraw all court cases and allow Indian 

cricket to flourish taking into consideration the commitments of Messrs Rahul 

Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar, Kumble amp; Co.

Especially Tendulkar, as he is returning to national 

duty after a big gap. With or without Tendulkar, the Indian team needs a morale-booster 

from an establishment. (PTI)

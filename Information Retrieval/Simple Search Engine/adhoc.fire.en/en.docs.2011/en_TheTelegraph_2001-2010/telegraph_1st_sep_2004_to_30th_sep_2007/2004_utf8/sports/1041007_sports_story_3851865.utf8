 Beckham back on the stage he loves 

 HENRY WINTER 

 Beckham hopes he will perform well again 

David Beckham was back at the field of past dreams on Tuesday, training with England at Manchester United?s Carrington retreat, and then holding court at Old Trafford, venue for Saturday?s World Cup qualifier against Wales. 

?I love coming back,? Beckham said, sitting in the Europa Suite surrounded by photographs depicting United?s glorious history. ?It?s a special place for me. Anyone who comes here gets inspired.? 

Before being chauffeured to Old Trafford, Beckham had spent a windswept afternoon training at Carrington; this brought the remarkable sight of 22 fit players, possibly an opening-day record for England training. The sole absentee was Beckham?s Real Madrid clubmate, Michael Owen, otherwise detained across town having a scan on a back niggle. 

No damage showed up and Owen, stressed he was ?hopeful? he would be training Thursday. If not, Jermain Defoe can expect to partner Wayne Rooney. One of seven England players with United associations sprinting about Carrington, Rooney displayed his technical accomplishments, seeking to place the ball in varying parts of the goal. Like Beckham, Nicky Butt was returning to a familiar haunt. Gary Neville was his usual competitive self, pursuing the ball as if it were the last minute of the World Cup final, while Alan Smith and Phil Neville buzzed around Rio Ferdinand, all neat touch and fluid movement, was particularly revelling in his restoration to the fold after that eight-month suspension. 

Any loose control by Butt or Gary Neville brought mirth-filled rebukes from Ferdinand. The England camp is a happier place with the lively centre-half around. ?Having Rio back in the team is massive for the players and fans,? agreed Beckham. 

?You can see with the [successful] way he has come back into the United team, what he has done for them. We are hoping that is what he is going to do for us. We have Rio, Sol Campbell, Ledley King and John Terry to chose from, and they are all immense players. There are not many better defences around than ours.? 

For all the depiction of Wales as under-dragons, the visitors deserve respect. They will hardly be in awe of Old Trafford. Indeed, Ryan Giggs and Mark Hughes will find it strange emerging from the away dressing-room. ?It is going to be special playing against Giggsy,? smiled Beckham of the meeting down England?s right. 

?I have never played against Giggsy before and it will be a nice battle and a good battle. I?d like to think Gary is going to win the battle against Giggsy. But when Giggsy plays well, there are not many better players around. I hope he doesn?t have a good game. If he does, Gary will be up against it. I am also good friends with Mark Hughes and he has done superbly for Wales. 

?It is going to be a heated game. Everyone knows that because England-Wales doesn?t happen very often. When it does, it is going to be a tough match. I am not saying we fear Wales, but we respect them a lot.? 

?I personally feel my form is back. My performances for Real have been good. I am hoping that playing at Old Trafford against Wales I will perform well again.? 

It is a stage he loves.

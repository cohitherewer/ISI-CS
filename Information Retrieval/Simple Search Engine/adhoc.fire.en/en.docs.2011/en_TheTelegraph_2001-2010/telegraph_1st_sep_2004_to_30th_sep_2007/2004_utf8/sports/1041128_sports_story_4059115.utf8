 Lara amp; Co. to attend camp

St George?s (Grenada): The West Indies? tour of Australia seems to be back on track after the national cricket board permitted captain Brian Lara and 15 other players to attend a training camp next week. 

The decision follows day-long talks over a disputed contract between the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) and West Indies Players? Association (WIPA) on Saturday. Grenada Prime Minister Keith Mitchell and Barbados sports minister Reginald Farley acted as mediators. 

The board and players also agreed to allow an arbitrator to interpret the contract and resolve the dispute by December 15. ?I feel heartened after this long and difficult process that we at least have an understanding? said Mitchell.

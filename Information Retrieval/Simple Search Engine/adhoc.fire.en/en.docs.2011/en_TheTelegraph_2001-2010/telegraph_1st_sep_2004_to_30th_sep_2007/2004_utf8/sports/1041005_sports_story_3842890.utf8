 Day belonged to Daniel, Amil 

 STAR RACER

Wednesday?s business went about as usual after RCTC 

paid tribute to the late jockey Yogender Singh by observing a two-minute silence. 

His fellow professionals also wore black armbands. Yogender had a fatal fall from 

Dilnawaz, in Pune on September 25 ? which also happened to be his birth date. 

The high-risk sport, therefore, claimed another promising career ? a 22-year-old 

and a champion in the making.

 The afternoon, otherwise, belonged to jockey Md Amil who helped trainer Daniel David saddle two of his three winners. The jockey, however, did much damage to the punters? cause as his winning rides ? Idaho and Brighter Future ? had a very small following. Nevertheless, he rode the two horses in contrasting manner for the desired results. 

 Idaho, a 9-2 fancy after the favourite Accuser and Compassionate in the day?s chief event, the 2,000m Monsoon Cup, was ridden off the pace in the first half of the trip and ridden to for eventual speed in the latter part. More than the stable?s strategy what helped the Argyle Lake-Ipso Facto six-year-old to score was his light-impost of 48-1/2 kg against the Accuser?s top-weight. Still, Accuser made the winner stretch to the fullest after raising hopes of delivering the goods 100m from home. Compassionate was never a threat to the fighting duo. Amil displayed controlled aggression on Brighter Future in the 1,200m Mysore Race Club Cup. He made the Duja-Belle Epoque filly change gears fast to storm away from the field after leading by a length till the final bend. 

 Errol Bhungard?s pair of Immaculate and El Cid did cover good ground in the stretch but the 10-1 outsider was always in full command of the field. Favourite Announcer was a total flop after being up with the field till the home turn. The Vijay Singh-ward may do better on the winter track.

 The three favourites who justified their short odds were Assagi, Mythical Star and Almara. Assagi may have recorded the longest verdict of two and half-a-length but jockey Imran Chisty had to sweat it out on the John Stephens-trainee. The Tecorno-Magestic Eagle son being a long distance runner had found the 1,400m trip of the Roll ?N? Twist Cup quite sharp. He was hesitant to pass Autumn Fantasy till 150m from home but once he got going the verdict was never in doubt.

 The 5-4 favourite Mythical Star, another of Daniel?s winners in the 2,000m Brown Wolf Handicap, had a comfortable measure of a strongly fancied Blue Chip. Ridden by the visiting South India jockey Kavan Kariappa, the Twist And Turn-Melodrama five-year-old was pushed into a three length lead 600m from home to frustrate apprentice Md Islam?s efforts who failed to cover a shade under two lengths at the wire. 

 The heavyweight of 58-1/2 kg told on the Bharath Singh-trainee who does her best with a light impost. Youngster Elusive Romance placed a good third and may benefit with the experience he gained over the staying trip.

 Almara won the 1,200m Amazing Handicap the way Vijay Singh-trainee liked. The Brave Hunter-Cool Tempo daughter had won her maiden start coming off the pace. On this occasion, jockey C. Alford had her settled up with leaders Royal Command and Great Ambition till the home turn before the filly took off and skated clear of the bunch. Alford had to apply brakes on the 6-10 favourite long way from home. Needless to say Almara may strike again.

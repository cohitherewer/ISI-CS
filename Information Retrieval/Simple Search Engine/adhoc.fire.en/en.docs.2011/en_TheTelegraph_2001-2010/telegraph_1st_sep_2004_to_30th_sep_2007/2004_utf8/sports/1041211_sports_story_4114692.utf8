 Compassionate may claim Burdwan Cup 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Barring an event or two, winner spotting in Saturday?s race card may not be an easy task. In fact, the later half of the card appears to be too competitive, and the first leg of the jackpot pool itself may see three-cornered betting in a field of five.

 In the race, Accuser, Compassionate and Mythical Star stake a strong claim for the 2,000m Maharajadhiraja Uday Chand Mahtab of Burdwan Memorial Cup. However, the Javed Khan-trainee Compassionate is expected to relish the change of equipment ? blinkers on ? and triumph in the hands of Mark Reuben.

 Calescent, in the 1,400m Galstaun Cup, may be hard to down unless the Alnasr Alwasheek-Preparation son decides to do an Alashaan. C. Alford partners the Vijay Singh-trained four-year-old. Vijay?s Calamite is also fancied to lift the 1,600m BSF Trophy.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

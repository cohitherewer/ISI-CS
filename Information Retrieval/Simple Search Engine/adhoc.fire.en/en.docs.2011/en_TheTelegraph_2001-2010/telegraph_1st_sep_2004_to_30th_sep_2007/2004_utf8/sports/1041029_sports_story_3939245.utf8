The Telegraph - Calcutta

 One of my best spells: Gillespie

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Nagpur: Jason Gillespie, who finished with five for 56 on Thursday, feels that it is the support of his fellow bowlers that has made his feat possible. 

?Figure-wise this was one of the best spells,? the fast bowler said at the end of the third day. ?But it came on the back of great bowling by (Glenn) McGrath, (Michael) Kasprowicz and Warnie (Shane Warne). I was lucky to get a couple of wickets in the end, but all these guys played really well. That?s the beauty of the Australian side, it?s knocking the opposition out, and it doesn?t really matter who gets them.? 

The meek surrender of the India batsmen did not surprise Gillespie. ?To be honest, it was good bowling out there. When you?ve got guys like McGrath, Kasprowicz and Warne bowling tight, it becomes very difficult to score. 

?Zaheer and Ajit, too, did the same for India after lunch with some good bowling as (Justin) Langer and (Simon) Katich struggled. They were lucky to get through that phase without much damage.? 

He felt this good bowling can be attributed to the pitch. ?The wicket was green and had a bit of carry. It was so different from most of the Indian wickets, which are flat, low and suit the spinners.? 

What has been his greatest lesson bowling alongside McGrath? ?The one big thing would be just putting the ball in the right areas again and again. This builds up the pressure and often results in breaking partnerships,? Gillespie said. 

He didn?t say much on why the follow-on wasn?t enforced. ?We could?ve gone either way. I am not the captain so I can?t comment.?

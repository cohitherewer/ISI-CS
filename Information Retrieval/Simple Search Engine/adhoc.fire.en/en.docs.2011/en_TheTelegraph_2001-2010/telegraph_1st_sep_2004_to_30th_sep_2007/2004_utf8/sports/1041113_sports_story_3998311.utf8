Heraklion (Greece): India?s women Grandmaster Dronavalli Harika regained sole lead after settling for a draw with Alisa Melekhina of the US in the ninth round of the under-14 girls section in the World Youth Chess championships here. 

Harika now has seven-and-a-half points out of a possible nine and is half a point ahead of her nearest rivals Anna Muzychuk of Slovenia, Elena Tairova and Melanie Ohme of Germany. 

With just two rounds remaining, Harika needs just one victory and a draw to secure her world title.

Nan has eight points in his kitty and is followed by Negi and Chinese Ding Liren, half a point behind. In the next round, Negi will face top seed Liu Qingnan of China, and if he manages to win this all-important contest, Negi will be in contention for the gold.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Harbhajan talks of miracle

 - ?Clarke was a revelation? His confidence stood out...? 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Harbhajan Singh with Zaheer Khan at the Chinnaswamy Stadium on Thursday 

Bangalore: During a chat in the recent Champions Trophy, Harbhajan Singh told The Telegraph ?one can?t always be a winner... can?t always be the champion bowler...? 

On Thursday evening, though, he expressed satisfaction at having taken five wickets in his first Test innings since surgery (in Melbourne) last December. 

?It?s nice to get wickets against Australia... There was no assistance on the first day (Wednesday), but some turn was there today... The second innings, however, is going to be different...? Harbhajan remarked. 

Of course, he conceded Team India was in big trouble, but added that confidence would be drawn from the epic fightback at the Eden in March 2001. 

?We definitely need to do something out of the ordinary... In any case, nothing is impossible...? Harbhajan insisted. 

And, talking of the Australian batting, he said: ?Adam Gilchrist and Michael Clarke have taken this Test away... Clarke was a revelation and never gave the impression he was in his debut game... His confidence stood out...? 

Incidentally, Harbhajan brought off a great return catch to end the stand-in captain?s outstanding innings.

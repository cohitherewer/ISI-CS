Southampton: Australia taught newcomers USA a lesson or two in international cricket pounding the hapless Americans by nine wickets in a pool A match of the ICC Champions Trophy here on Monday. 

Michael Kasprowicz and Jason Gillespie took four wickets apiece as the world champions skittled out the USAfor a paltry 65 in 24 overs, in a match which started half hour late due to rain. 

The Australians then romped home in just 7.5 overs to record one of the fastest wins in the game?s history. 

 Adam Gilchirst (24 not out) hit spinner Rashid Zia for a six over mid-wicket to bring up the win after Australia lost Matthew Hayden (23) with the total on 41. Skipper Ricky Ponting remained unbeaten on eight. 

The USA total was also the lowest in the history of the Champions Trophy. The previous low stood in the name of Bangladesh who had made 77 against New Zealand in 2002 in Sri Lanka. 

Australian got off to a fiery start under overcast conditions at the Rose Bowl, after Ponting put the US in to bat. Brett Lee?s toe-crashing delivery uprooted Howard Johnson in the second ball of the day to leave the US at 1-1. 

Kasprowicz got into the action in the 11th over,, removing the next four batsmen in his first three overs as the Americans lost six of their top batsmen by the 15th over. Then it was Gillespie?s turn to share the spoils as he ran through the lower order to finish with four for 15 from six overs. 

Kasprowicz returned with four for 14.. 

Australia started the chase in emphatic fashion with Hayden and Gilchrist belting 12 runs in the first over. 

The side raced to 41 in under five overs when Hayden departed. Hayden edged an away-going Howard Johnson delivery and Mark Johnson latched on to the catch. 

Gilchrist and Ponting finished off the match within two overs of Hayden?s dismissal.

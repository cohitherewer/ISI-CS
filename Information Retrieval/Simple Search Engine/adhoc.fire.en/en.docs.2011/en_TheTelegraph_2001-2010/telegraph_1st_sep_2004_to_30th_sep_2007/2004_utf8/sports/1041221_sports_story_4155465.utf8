The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Decision on Dec. 28

A CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: The Goa Football Association (GFA) president, Shivanand V. Salgaocar?s inability to reach the capital on Monday, stalled the All India Football Federation (AIFF) proceedings. 

The AIFF had planned a meeting between the GFA and the Indian Football Association (IFA) to defuse tension between Mohun Bagan and Dempo (over Cristiano Junior?s death) prior to the start of the ninth National Football League (NFL). The IFA was represented by secretary Subrata Dutta. 

However, AIFF president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, secretary Alberto Colaco, chairman of the finance commission Praful Patel, Dutta and president of the Karnataka Football Association, A.R. Khaleel held informal talks. 

The IFA secretary formally requested that the NFL should commence with the Mohun Bagan-East Bengal match and that proceeds from this tie should go to Junior?s family. 

But a decision on this matter was put on hold as the AIFF too wants to hold a match between Mohun Bagan and Dempo in Calcutta. Colaco informed that a decision would be taken in the general body meeting on December 28.

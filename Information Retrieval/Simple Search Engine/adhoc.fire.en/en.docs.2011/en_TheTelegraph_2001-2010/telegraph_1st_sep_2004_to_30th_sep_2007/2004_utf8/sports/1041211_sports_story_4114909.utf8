The Telegraph - Calcutta

Kumble well ahead of Warne, Murali

Guest Column 

Bhagwat Chandrasekhar

I first met Anil Kumble during one of the under-17 

camps in Bangalore. I noticed a similarity in our styles ? both of us bowled fastish 

leg-breaks. I also saw that he couldn?t turn the ball much and didn?t bowl the 

googly. Still, batsmen were finding it tough to handle him.

There was something in him that made me stand up and 

take notice ? the bounce and the nip he generated off the wicket. He bowled off 

a very short run-up, which could have acted as a major hindrance. I suggested 

if he felt comfortable, he should switch to a longer run-up, which he did. Then 

itself, I believed he could make it big with the right opening and a little bit 

of luck. He has proved his class since. 

He has proved that a spinner is still an integral 

part of a cricket XI. Maybe because of the one-day impact, a spinner nowadays 

dreads to flight the ball, but the utility aspect cannot be ignored. 

Anil?s tremendous success can be attributed to his 

line and length, and the nip off the wicket. His tremendous control makes all 

the difference even in crunch situations. His dedication and determination is 

an example for all youngsters.

Soon after receiving the India cap in 1990, he was 

dropped for the Australia tour and the World Cup, but he came back stronger. He 

always had the perseverance and the ability to bounce back when someone dared 

to write him off. He proved critics wrong when he achieved the same success after 

the shoulder operation.

Today?s cricket can be very strenuous. The stress 

is more in the one-dayers. It?s tough to maintain the balance and cope with the 

pressure. But Anil is adept at handling difficult situations with ease.

In the last couple of years, he has also developed 

the googly which he is using effectively. You can make out it?s got the same trajectory 

and it deviates. 

There is a significant gap between Anil and his contemporaries. 

In the long run, what matters most is consistency and Anil hasn?t been found wanting 

on that front. As of today, he is certainly the No. 1 spinner in the world. I 

can?t see Muralidharan continuing for too long, while Warne has lost his touch 

and consistency.

India?s most successful bowler is in the prime of 

his career. Since last year?s tour Down Under, he has enjoyed phenomenal success. 

People often ask me as to when he should call it a day. It makes me wonder why 

such questions crop up. He should now aim for another 100 wickets and then think 

about the future.

If he can maintain his fitness, enjoy the game and 

is willing to continue, it will be hard to stop him. There seems to be no one 

who can dislodge him, at least in the next couple of years.

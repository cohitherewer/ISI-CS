London: A late equaliser by Tommaso Rocchi earned Lazio a 1-1 home draw with Villarreal and prevented a Spanish treble on the first night of action in the new group stage of the Uefa Cup on Thursday. 

Spain, who won the competition through Valencia last season, had two wins to celebrate as Athletic Bilbao beat Parma 2-0 and Real Zaragoza beat Utrecht by the same score. 

There were 16 games in all under the new system, where 40 teams play in eight groups of five, each playing the other four teams once only over the next two months. Sevilla, the fourth Spanish club to qualify, were one of eight sides not in action on Thursday. 

After the four games ? two home and two away for each club ? the top three in each group progress to the knockout stage, where they will be joined by the eight third-placed finishers from the Champions League group stage. 

The nearest thing to a heavyweight clash took place in Rome where Lazio faced last year?s beaten semi-finalists Villarreal in group E. 

Jose Mari had the visitors in the fifth minute after beating three defenders but spoiled his book when he was sent off in the 75th minute for elbowing Giuliano Giannichedda. 

Lazio took advantage six minutes from time when a neat lay-off by Simone Inzaghi set up Rocchi for the equaliser. 

In the other group E game, Middlesbrough continued their encouraging first European campaign with a 1-0 win at Greek outsiders Egaleo, courtesy of a late strike by Stuart Downing. 

Newcastle United, semi-finalists last season, made it an English north-east double when they won 1-0 at Panionios in group D with an 87th-minute penalty by Alan Shearer. 

Athletic Bilbao scored early in each half through Carlos Gurpegito and Asier del Horno to complete a comfortable group B victory over Parma, who have yet to win this season in Serie A. 

Zaragoza left it later to beat Dutch side Utrecht in group C as David Villa got both goals after 77 and 82 minutes. 

Rangers finally raised some European cheer with a thumping 5-0 win at Poland?s Amica Wronki in group F. 

The Glasgow club led only 1-0 through Peter Lovenkrands approaching the hour-mark but further goals by Nacho Novo, Fernando Ricksen, Shota Arveladze, from the penalty spot, and Steven Thompson underlined their dominance. 

Zenit St Petersburg also turned on the style in the second half to thrash AEK Athens 5-1 in group H. 

Russia striker Alexander Kerzhakov scored a 20-minute hattrick to power them to an impressive win and make it three defeats out of three for the Greek clubs involved on Thursday. VfB Stuttgart also won 5-1, away at Belgium?s Beveren in group G. 

Brazilian Cacau got two and there were further goals for Kevin Kuranyi, Philipp Lahm and Imre Szabics. The other group G game also produced six goals as Benfica beat Heerenveen 4-2 in Lisbon. 

Benfica led 2-0 at half-time through Dos Santos and Nuno Gomes but the Dutch hit back through Ugur Yildirim and a Jan Huntelaar penalty to make it 2-2 after 53 minutes. 

Benfica surged back though to win it with two goals in five minutes through Azar Karadas and a second for Nuno Gomes. 

Feyenoord got underway in group A with a 3-0 home win over Hearts with two goals for Dirk Kuijt and one for Bart Goor.

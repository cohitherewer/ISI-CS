 PCB ready to bail out organisers

Islamabad: Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is willing to return part of its earnings from the recent rain-affected tri-nation event in Holland despite being paid its share money in advance by The Netherlands Cricket Association. 

PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan said that Pakistan had got its share of the earnings of the tournament from the Dutch board but was willing to return part of its share as the event was affected by bad weather. 

Pakistans share from the three-nation event also involving world champions Australia and commercially the most viable team in the world, India, is said to be approximately $1.7 million. 

The same amount was paid to the Australian and Indian boards by the Dutch association but because of the tournament being spoiled by rain, the three boards will have to refund approximately half a million dollars each. 

The Indian TV channel Sony Max paid an amount of $6 million for the rights of the tournament in which two matches were washed out and only the final between Pakistan and Australia was a 50-over affair. 

The Netherlands association paid the share of all three cricket boards in advance. But now because the TV channel are asking for a part refund of its total payment, all three boards have to refund part of their shares and we have no problems with that, Shaharyar was quoted as saying in The News on Thursday.

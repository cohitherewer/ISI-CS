 Black Caps ready with gameplan

London: Stephen Fleming insists his New Zealand side can put Australia on the rack when the two sides clash in the ICC Champions Trophy. 

The Black Caps skipper will lead his team out against the favourites in the pool A decider at The Oval here on Thursday when he reckons New Zealand can upset the odds. 

Fleming?s side handed out a humiliating lesson to the US when they crushed their minnow opponents by 210 runs, smashing a tournament record 347 for five on Friday. 

?We?re looking forward to it, we?ve been thinking about this one for quite some time,? Fleming said. 

?It?s about being smart. One thing we do know, you?ve got to compete 100 overs. We?ve had them on the rack before but they?ve squirmed away.? 

The Black Caps skipper is relishing the chance to get one over the world champions.

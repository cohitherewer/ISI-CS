 India end with draw vs Oman; China bow out

New Delhi: India held Oman to a 0-0 draw in their final Asian Zone group III World Cup qualifier in Muscat on Wednesday. India, who had been drubbed 1-4 at home by Oman, thus finished with four points from six games. 

Japan qualified for the second stage from this group. 

It was a highly creditable result for the Indians who missed a number of key players due to injuries. Defenders Dipak Mondal and Mahesh Gawli, captain and striker Bhaichung Bhutia were all missing from the squad. 

 Meanwhile, China suffered a traumatic exit from the qualifiers despite trouncing Hong Kong 7-0 in Guangzhou. Kuwait pipped China after thrashing Malaysia 6-1 at home to top group IV on goals scored. Kuwait netted 15, China 14. 

Also reaching the final round of qualifiers were 2002 World Cup co-hosts and semi-finalists South Korea, who beat Maldives 2-0 at home.

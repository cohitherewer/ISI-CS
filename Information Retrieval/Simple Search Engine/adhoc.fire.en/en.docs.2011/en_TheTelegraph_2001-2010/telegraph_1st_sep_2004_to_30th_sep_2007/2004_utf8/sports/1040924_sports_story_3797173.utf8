The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Practice match in Bangalore

Mumbai: The four-day practice match between India Seniors and India A will be held in Bangalore from September 28 to October 1. It was originally planned in Pune. 

?The Indian team management wanted the match in Bangalore as they felt the players too can get the feel of the wicket there,? BCCI secretary, S. K. Nair, said from Thiruvanthanapuram on Thursday. 

?The Indian Seniors and India A teams would be picked by the senior selection committee in Mohali tomorrow?, Nair added.

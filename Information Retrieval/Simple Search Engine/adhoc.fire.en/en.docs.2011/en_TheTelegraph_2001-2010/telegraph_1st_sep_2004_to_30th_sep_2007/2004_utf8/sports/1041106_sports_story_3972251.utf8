 A thriller goes India?s way

Mumbai: India snatched a 13-run consolation win in the fourth and final Test against Australia, as 20 wickets fell Friday to end the match in just three days. 

The Indian spinners, led by Harbhajan Singh, helped the hosts defend a paltry target of 107 and bowl out the visitors for 93, their lowest-ever total in India. 

[?I am happy we won the last Test. It will be a big confidence booster and will hold us in good stead for future matches,? said Team India captain Sourav Ganguly, who sat out the last two Tests of the series because of injury. ?It was a combined team effort. But I should also give a lot of credit to (VVS) Laxman and Sachin (Tendulkar) who batted very well in difficult conditions.? 

?I do not want to say anything on this track but spinners are our strength and we should prepare wickets which suit them,? Sourav added.] 

The dismissal of last man Glenn McGrath by Harbhajan Singh (five for 29) sent the vociferous home crowd into a frenzy. The low-scoring Test on a viciously turning track effectively ended inside two days as only 11 overs were bowled on a rain-ruined opening day. 

Earlier, the visitors found an unlikely bowling hero in Michael Clarke who produced a dream spell of 6.2-0-9-6 with his part-time left-arm spin to skittle out India for 205 in their second innings. 

Australia, who led the home team by 99 runs on the first innings, were bundled out in only 30.5 overs and in under two-and-a-half hours. 

Man-of-the-Match Kartik grabbed three for 32, including two in one over, to add to his four claimed in the first innings to make early inroads. 

Then Harbhajan cut through the middle and bottom-order to claim five for 29 . 

Earlier, Sachin Tendulkar (55) and Laxman (69) strung together an invaluable stand of 91 for the third wicket to rescue India from a precarious 14 for two. 

Plan for early series 

Meanwhile, Cricket Australia (CA) and the BCCI have started the groundwork to ensure the next Test series for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in India is held ?much earlier? than scheduled in 2010. ?We are having discussions but I can say we will be here much earlier than 2010,? CA chairman Bob Merriman said.

 Sobha lone star in fray

Mumbai: Anju Bobby George, who bettered her own womens long jump mark by nine centimetres in finishing sixth at the Athens Olympics, has skipped the September 10-12 Open national athletics championship to be held here. 

Also missing from the fray are two athletes who were part of the contingent in Athens, high-jumper Bobby Aloysius and quarter-miler K. M. Binu, who too set a national mark while qualifying for the semi-finals of the 400m. 

Anju and Binu are taking part in meets post-Athens in Europe, while Aloyssius also a national record holder has not given any reason for cold-shouldering the meet, former sprint champion and organising secretary of the meet, Adille Sumariwalla, said on Friday. 

J.J. Sobha who braved a knee ligament injury and severe pain to complete the gruelling womens heptathlon at the Olympics, has sent in her entry through her employers, Indian Railways. 

Shot-putter Bahadur Singh, who came back from Athens after fouling all his throws, is among the list of athletes who have entered the event which is being hosted in the city after 11 years. All other athletes who were in Athens, barring injured discus thrower Anil Kumar, have entered. 

The three-day meet has attracted over 600 athletes, from 18 states and six sports control boards. Electronic timers and photo finish cameras would be used for track events, but for throw events measuring tapes would be used, he said, adding dope tests would be conducted on all winners by SAI officials.

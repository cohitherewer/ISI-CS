 IN THE CITY

 The IFA is set to embark on a partnership with the Unicef in promoting girls? education at the primary and elementary school levels. Under the Fifa?s move to ensure gender equity, 64 football kits will be distributed among students in Bengal and Assam. The state office of the Unicef wants the IFA to join the project, by way of organising district-level matches involving girl students, apart from regular training for them. The IFA is expected to go through the Unicef?s presentation in this regard on November 8.

 Subrata Sarkar is the solitary referee from the state to officiate in the Durand Cup football meet (November 1-10).

 Meanwhile, East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick has maintained that his vitriol during an IFA Shield match was not aimed at IFA, but overall disorganisation that prevailed in the post-match press conference. Bhowmick?s reply reached the IFA office on Thursday, after an explanation was sought. The final decision is pending.

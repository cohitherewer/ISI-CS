 Amir sends ripples of glory to Pakistan

 Amir Khan 

Islamabad: The Olympic silver medal success of Amir Khan, the British boxing sensation of Pakistani origin, has sent ripples of pride through his grandparents, although they lament he did not represent Pakistan. 

The 17-year-old was the toast of Olympic boxing as he fought his way to the final of the lightweight category thus becoming the youngest ever British Olympic medallist. 

I would have liked Khan to have fought for Pakistan but since he is brought up in Britain and trained there its a loss for Pakistan, Khans grandmother Kulsoom Begum said. He is a cute child and told me about his punching ambitions when he came here four years ago. 

Like Kulsoom, 52, many fans in Pakistan feel that Amir Khans victory was a loss for their country and a gain for Britain. 

During the world junior boxing championship in Jeon Ju, South Korea in June this year, Pakistani boxing officials offered Khan the chance to represent his parents country. 

For a moment khan was tempted, as the British boxing authorities, considering him too young, were reluctant to allow him to fight in the games. 

But in the end, they relented and paved the way for Khans Olympic glory in Athens, where five Pakistani boxers failed to win any medal. 

Had he won his final bout against Cuban Mario Kindelan on Sunday, Khan would have become the youngest ever Olympic gold medal winning boxer and also emulated his childhood idol Muhammad Ali, who won an Olympic gold when 18. 

 Khans father Shajaad Khan lived in the small village of Matore in Kahuta district, some 50 kilometres south-east of the Pakistani capital Islamabad, where he worked as a scrap dealer.

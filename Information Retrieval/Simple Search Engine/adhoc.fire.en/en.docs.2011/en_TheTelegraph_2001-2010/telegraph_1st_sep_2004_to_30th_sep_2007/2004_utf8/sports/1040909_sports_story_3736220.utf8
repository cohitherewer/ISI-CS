The Telegraph - Calcutta

 A disgrace, says Manna

 A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Former Indian footballer Sailen Manna has played Japan before. He has helped the country win. Today, he sounded totally dejected. 

?One goal could have been fine. But four goals were a bit too much. I thought at least at home, they wouldn?t concede so many. And all the goals were quite soft,? Manna said after Japan beat India at the Salt Lake Stadium on Wednesday. ?It?s nothing but a disgrace.? 

Manna pointed out how Japan had grown into a footballing super power through the years. ?There is a huge difference between the Japan we played and now. The art of dribbling doesn?t exist anymore.?

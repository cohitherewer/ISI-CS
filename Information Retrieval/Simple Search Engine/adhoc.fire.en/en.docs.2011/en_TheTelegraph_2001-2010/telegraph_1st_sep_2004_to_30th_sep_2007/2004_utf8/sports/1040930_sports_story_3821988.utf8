 Thomastown (Ireland): Three-time winner and world No. 2 Tiger Woods is doubtful for the WGC-American Express Championship starting on Thursday because of a shoulder injury which he picked up last week.

 The prestigious tournament, a rung down from a major, is already missing the man who deposed Woods after five years as world number one, Vijai Singh, who is out while repairs are made to his hurricane-hit house in Florida.

 ?I?ve never had that pain in my life ? this is all new to me. If I?m able to go I?ll go, if I can?t I won?t,? said Woods, who played seven holes of practice at Mount Juliet on Wednesday. He said he would make a final decision after a warm-up session on Thursday morning. 

 Magdeburg: Police have raided the home of top German athletics coach Thomas Springstein looking for banned performance-enhancing drugs, the director of public prosecution said on Wednesday.

 Springstein coached Nils Schumann to the 2000 Sydney Olympic 800m title and Grit Breuer to two European 400m titles in 1990 and 1998.

 He was also the coach of Katrin Krabbe, the 1991 world champion at 100m and 200m. Both Krabbe and Breuer were suspended for two years for using the banned steroid clenbuterol in 1992. The ban was extended by another two years by the IAAF in 1993. 

 Sarajevo: Fifa has banned the stadium in the Bosnian town of Zenica for two games because a Spanish player was hit by an object thrown from the crowd in a World Cup qualifier last month, Bosnia?s football association (NSBIH) said on Wednesday.

 Bosnia were scheduled to play Serbia and Montenegro in Zenica on October 9 in a high-risk World Cup group VII qualifier but the NSBIH has now nominated Sarajevo?s Olympic Kosevo stadium, NSBIH Secretary-General Munib Usanovic said.

 Fifa?s disciplinary commission has also fined the NSBIH 10,000 Swiss Francs ($7,950) over the incident in which a small pool ball hit Juan Valeron. The game ended in a 1-1 draw.

 London: Svetlana Kuznetsova has lined up a second million-dollar pay-day this season by qualifying for November?s WTA Championships. The teenager plundered the largest prize in women?s sport earlier this month when she picked up $1 million for winning her maiden Grand Slam title at the US Open.

 She can match that pay-day in November, however, if she triumphs at the end-of-season finale. The Russian became the third player to qualify for the November event in Los Angeles after Lindsay Davenport and Amelie Mauresmo.

 Brussels: Olympic champion Justine Henin-Hardenne said on Wednesday that she was still suffering from a virus which sidelined her earlier this year and may pull out of next week?s Porsche Grand Prix in Germany.

 ?I?m still not certain whether I will be able to participate in the Filderstadt tournament. We?ll have to see how it goes over the next days,? the former world No. 1 said on her web site. 

 London: Ralf Schumacher will race for Williams in the last two races of the Formula One season despite an apparent disagreement with the team in China at the weekend.

 ?Let there be no misunderstanding about the team?s commitment to Ralf,? team boss Frank Williams said . ?He will be racing for the team in Japan and Brazil.?

The Telegraph - Calcutta

Talk to yourself constantly while batting

Cricket Online 

Ravi Shastri

Whenever I try to flick the ball, I end up getting 

caught at square leg. Please help.

(Ronit Roy, 16, Calcutta-5)

Your head is going up. Make sure you are looking down 

and watching the ball meet the bat when playing that shot.

I am a right-handed batsman, strong on the offside 

but weak on the leg side. How do I improve my on-side play?

(Mansa Das, 16, Midnapore)

You need to practise a lot by making the bowler bowl 

at your pads. Also check your grip with your coach.

I am a right-arm medium-pacer and would like to 

know how one bowls the off and leg cutters.

(Shantanu Ojha, 13, Kulti)

You got to hold the ball seam up with a slightly wider 

grip and roll your fingers across the seam. Rolling the fingers clockwise would 

be an off-cutter and anti-clockwise would be a leg-cutter.

I am a right-handed batsman. I find it extremely 

difficult to tackle yorkers and end up being bowled. Please help.

(Diju Pratim Saikia, 18, Dibrugarh)

Watch the ball and check your backlift. It may be 

on the higher side.

I am a left-handed batsman and very weak against fast 

deliveries. I am often beaten by pace. How do I solve this problem?

(Saptarshi Mishra, 13, Bardhaman)

Don?t be afraid. Watch the ball and try to get in 

line. You will start enjoying it.

Do you think swing is natural and in-born? Can 

it be acquired by practice?

(Suman Dhar, 18, Calcutta-16)

Even if it is in-born, it demands a lot of practice.

I am a leg-spinner and would like to know how one 

bowls the googly.

(Sriram Das, 18, Calcutta-4)

You got to roll your wrist over so that the ball comes 

out of the back of your hand.

I am a wicketkeeper and have problems in anticipating 

the ball on the legside. Please help.

(Ramen Basu, 18, Calcutta-10)

Work on your footwork moving sideways, it will be 

a huge help. Also stay low when moving.

Please suggest a way by which we can keep the shine 

on the ball intact on one side for a longer period

(Pratim Sen, 21, Calcutta-24)

Make sure you tell your fielders and all the bowlers 

to keep shining the ball all the time.

How can one improve concentration while batting?

(Md Amin, 22, Cuttack)

By talking to yourself constantly about things you 

should and shouldn?t do. Also, setting goals and keeping a clear mind will help.

 A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: The Indian Football Association (IFA), in its coaching sub-committee meeting on Monday, decided to appoint Syed Nayeemuddin as the technical director of Bengal team for the Santosh Trophy to be held in New Delhi. 

He will have Aloke Mukherjee as coach and Debashis Mukherjee as goalkeeper coach. 

IFA secretary Subrata Dutta informed that the decision to appoint Nayeemuddin as technical director follows from his reputation as a disciplinarian. Dutta added that Subhas Bhowmick, Mohammed Habib and Monaranjan Bhattacharya?s names were also discussed. The team will be declared within a few days, the secretary added. 

Nayeem said he is worried about the lack of practice time the squad will get before the tournament due to the IFA Shield. He would be meeting Dutta on Tuesday and sort out the details. Coach Aloke Mukherjee said, ?Nayeemda has been my coach, I have no problem working with him.?

 Kallis issues warning to India

 Kallis is 33 runs away from the 6,000 milestone 

Jaipur: South African allrounder Jacques Kallis is keen to upset the Indian applecart in the upcoming two-match Test series and he proposes to do that not with his batting, but with his genuine fast bowling. 

?I have always seen myself as a batter and bowler. The ball is coming out sweetly, and I am confident of doing well,? Kallis said. The 29-year old from Cape Town has emerged as South Africa?s key figure in the last couple of years following the retirement of seasoned players like Allan Donald and Jonty Rhodes. 

And with a natural swing bowling to compliment his fine strokemaking skills, Kallis will be the nucleus around whom the South African team will be built in the years to come. 

Coach Ray Jennings fired the warning shot when he said Kallis would come hard at the Indians with his bowling. 

?The Indian players must be careful that Kallis is ready to show up as a bowler,? Jennings said. ?There is no doubt in my mind that when I look up at the bowling (strengths), Kallis is here, and the Indians are going to see... A new Kallis. 

Despite being acknowledged as a leading allrounder in contemporary cricket, statistics point to an unfulfilled bowling potential of this soft spoken South African. 

Kallis is just 33 runs away from the 6,000-run milestone. With an average of 53.75, he is among the top batsmen. But in 80 Tests, he has picked 166 wickets at an unflattering average of 30.68. 

Somewhat an anti-thesis of Shaun Pollock, the other allrounder in the side whose batting average is as mean as his bowling. The South Afri cans have always stressed on the need to preserve Kallis and not compromise his batting for the sake of gaining maximum out of his bowling. 

But that line of thinking seems to have changed, mainly due to the retirements of some talented players. 

?We have lost experienced players since the World Cup (last year) and you can?t buy experience in some supermarket. It takes a while to replace the vacant slots. We have some good young cricketers coming up, they have to put up their hands and come up with Man of the Match performances,? Kallis said. 

Meanwhile, South Africa?s lone specialist spinner Robin Peterson fancies his chances against India?s top batsmen as he believes the hosts would be at their own peril to underestimate his skills. 

?At the end of the day, it doesn?t matter whether I am bowling Sachin (Tendulkar) or (V.V.S.) Laxman or any other batsman. It is a matter of who slips first, and if they are going to be complacent, they will be doing me a favour,? Peterson said. 

The eastern province player came into the side after Charl Langeveldt, who came in for Nicky Boje, was ruled out with an injury.

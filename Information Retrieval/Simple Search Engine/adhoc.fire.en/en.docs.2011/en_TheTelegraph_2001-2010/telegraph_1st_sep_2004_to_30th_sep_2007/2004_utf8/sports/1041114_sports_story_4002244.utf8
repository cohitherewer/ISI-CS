 Vijai eyes prolonged stay at the top

New Delhi: Fijian Vijai Singh wants to hold his position as the number one golfer as long as possible. 

?True it is great to become the world No. 1. I have had that dream and it is great to have made it. But now my immediate goal is to maintain that position in the next season and also stay there for as long as possible,? Singh said on Saturday. 

The 41-year-old golfer, who won nine PGA Tour titles this year enroute to the top spot, said there were a lot of good players on the circuit who could win on their day and it was essential for him to keep winning. ?It is not just about Tiger (Woods). There are many other top golfers whom you have to compete with,? said Singh. 

Singh is here to play the Bilts Skins championship, which he had won in its first year in 2002. He called on Prime Minister Manmohan Singh at his residence on the day. (PTI)

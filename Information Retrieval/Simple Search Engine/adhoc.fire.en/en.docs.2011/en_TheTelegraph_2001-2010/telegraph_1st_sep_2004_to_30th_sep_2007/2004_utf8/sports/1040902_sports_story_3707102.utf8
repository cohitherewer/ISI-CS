 One-stroke lead for Dube

 A STAFF REPORTER 

Chennai: Jyoti Randhawa, miles away from Chennai, still had a great impact on the outcome of the opening days play of the Hyundai-TNGF Open 2004, which began at the par-72, Cosmo-TNGF Golf Course here on Wednesday. 

Amit Dube, whom Randhawa tutored during the off season, pulled off a remarkable round to grab a one-stroke lead at six-under 66 on the first day of the Amby Valley Golf Tours 2004-05 season, according to information received here. 

Mukesh Kumar, Amritinder Singh, Pappan and S. Madhaiah were tied for second place at five-under 67. 

Dubes round commenced on the tenth tee. He struck gold almost immediately after with a birdie on the11th.

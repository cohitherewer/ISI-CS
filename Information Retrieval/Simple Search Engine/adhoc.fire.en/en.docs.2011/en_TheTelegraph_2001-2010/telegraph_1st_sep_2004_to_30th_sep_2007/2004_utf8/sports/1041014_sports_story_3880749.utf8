 State funeral for Miller on Wednesday

Melbourne: Australian cricket great Keith Miller will be honoured with a state funeral in downtown Melbourne next week, Victoria?s state premier Steve Bracks said on Wednesday. 

Miller, Australia?s finest allrounder and a member of Sir Donald Bradman?s ?Invincibles? touring team to England in 1948, died on Monday aged 84 at a nursing home in the Mornington peninsula, near Melbourne. 

Bracks, describing Miller as the greatest sportsman Victoria had produced, said a state funeral would be held next Wednesday at St Paul?s Anglican cathedral. 

?Keith Miller was one of the greatest sportsmen our state has produced,? Bracks said in a statement. ?I?m sure many Victorians will want to join together in celebrating his life,? Bracks added in a statement. 

?Whether representing his country on the sporting field, or as a fighter pilot in World War II, he always displayed outstanding character and humanity.? 

Miller, a dashing and unconventional man who was also a highly accomplished Australian rules footballer, made his Test debut in 1946 and was voted Wisden?s cricketer of the year in 1954. 

Considered one of the world?s greatest allrounders, Miller played 55 Tests for Australia, scoring 2,958 runs at an average of 36.97 and claiming 170 wickets at 22.97. 

He and fellow-pacer Ray Lindwall formed a winning partnership to dominate the Australian bowling line-up in the aftermath of World War II.

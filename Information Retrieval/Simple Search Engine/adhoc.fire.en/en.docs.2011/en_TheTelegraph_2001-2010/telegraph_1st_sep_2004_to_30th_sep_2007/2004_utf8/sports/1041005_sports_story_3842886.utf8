The Telegraph - Calcutta

 IFA has been betrayed: Dutta

 A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Under fire from all quarters for having devalued the IFA Shield by inviting a team like Renown SC, Subrata Dutta hit back strongly at those who let him down. 

?We have been betrayed by the Sri Lankan federation,? the IFA secretary fumed on Monday evening, shortly after the Sri Lankan side had succumbed to a 1-10 defeat at the hands of Myanmar Finance amp; Revenue FC ? two days after they lost 0-9 to Mohun Bagan. 

?The IFA didn?t want to go through any agent to invite foreign teams, that?s why I had approached (Lanka federation president) Manilal Fernando directly? he recommended Renown SC and I took his word. And look what I get for trusting Mr Fernando who also happens to be an AFC vice-president and a Fifa development officer,? Dutta remarked. 

?Not only did he (Fernando) let us down, even the image of Lankan football has taken a severe beating,? Dutta went on. The IFA was assured that the Renown team would comprise of four national team players and three foreign players. ?In reality, they have brought a junior side,? Dutta said, adding that he did try to ring up Fernando and give him a piece of his mind, but the Lankan official was out of station. ?I?ll write to the federation to register my protest.? 

Dutta took a dig at the AIFF too. ?Like the Durand Cup and Federation Cup, we have got just 10 days to complete the tournament. Even the time slot for the IFA Shield is not to my liking. But what to do? We are completely at the AIFF?s mercy.? 

Justifying his decision to invite teams from Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Myanmar, Dutta said the IFA was not in a position to invite genuine crowd-pulling teams from France, Germany or Brazil. 

?So we want to develop this meet as a competition for sides from the sub-continent. I think it?s a better idea than having all six local or Indian sides.? 

Now, of course, he has learnt a lesson. ?The most important lesson is not to trust national federations? We?ll have to go through the AFC or Fifa in future,? Dutta observed.

 Jaipur stadium may not be ready

Jaipur: The visiting South African team could be deprived of good batting practice in their only tour game before the two-match Test series against India because the wicket at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium still looks underprepared. 

The visitors are scheduled to play a three-day tour opener against Board President?s XI from November 14 at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium but the organisers are still struggling to prepare the wicket in time for the match. 

The stadium is a multipurpose venue and Rajasthan Cricket Association, who are the hosts, received possession of the ground only 45 days ago. 

Though only top dressing was possible in this short time, things have become worse as the water sprinkled on it to grow grass has still not dried, raising fears that the wicket could remain underprepared. 

However, curator Abdul Saeed and former chairman of Indian selection committee Kishen Rungta were confident that they would be able to provide a good wicket for the match. 

Under Rungta?s guidance the pitch is being prepared. 

However, their efforts are being thwarted by moisture and falling temperatures. 

Organising secretary Anant Vyas confirmed on Thursday that they were trying hard to ensure the ground was ready in time for the match. 

?The visiting team will land in Jaipur on 12 and would practice in the afternoon session before which we have to complete all the work,? he said.

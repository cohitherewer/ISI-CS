 ?Good things in store for me?

 - Zaheer feels with some fine-tuning, he can add a couple of yards to his pace 

 Zaheer Khan says he has taken criticism in his stride 

Dhaka: Zaheer Khan?s record-breaking 75 (at No. 11) in the first Test against Bangladesh capped his successful comeback from a period of injuries and low form. 

From the high of spearheading the Indian bowling in the World Cup, things abruptly turned upside down for Zaheer within a year, as he watched from the sidelines his team score victories in Australia and Pakistan. 

But now that his worst days are behind him, the Baroda pacer is keen to forge ahead. 

?You can?t help certain things, can?t change them. You have to live with that. I want to look ahead and keep moving. I am sure there are more good things in store for me,? he said. 

Zaheer has not been exactly among the wickets this season and for the most part has been a support cast to Irfan Pathan. 

?I definitely feel happy with the way things have gone. I have played all the seven Tests this season and done well. Of course there is scope for improvement. 

?I am looking forward to the break after this series when I will be able to work on my fitness,? he remarked. 

The one thing that may be lacking in his bowling is the speed. He had averaged near the 130 kmph mark, whereas earlier, he used to bowl close to 140. 

He maintained that a bit more fine-tuning would help him add a couple of yards to his pace. 

?It is all about rhythm. When you hit the right length obviously your pace becomes better. I also need to work a bit on my fitness.? 

The Baroda pacer said he was not bothered with the criticism and instead, has taken them in his stride. 

?When you are not doing well, people criticise. You have got to live with that. The motivation for me was to control things that I could control. I kept my focus on things that I can do better.? 

Zaheer denied that he rushed his comebacks last season when he frequently broke down with one injury after another. 

?Not really. Neither Andrew (Leipus) nor I could say why injuries were happening, so we did not know in which direction to go. 

?When one muscle got injured and I did all that was required to come back, then a different muscle would give away. 

?It was only after the Asia Cup in Sri Lanka that Andrew could figure out what was going wrong and from there we decided on the direction (of treatment),? he said. 

Zaheer said the 2002-03 season, when both his personal and the team?s graph kept going upwards remains his best phase. 

For a bowler who took to serious cricket only at the age of 17, his growth has been pretty rapid. 

?I guess it was a natural thing. I had the talent. But more importantly I got breakthroughs at the right moment, and the right people helped me at the right time.?

 Railways hit back via Harvinder

 - RANJI ROUND-UP 

New Delhi: Paceman Harvinder Singh claimed a six-wicket haul as Railways hit back at defending champions Mumbai on the second day of the Ranji Trophy Elite A Group tie at the Karnail Singh stadium here Monday. 

The right-arm seamer made amends for the disappointment of first day and picked six for 75 to rip through the Mumbai middle order and put the hosts back on track. The visitors, resuming at a healthy 261 for three, were bowled out for 361 half an hour after lunch. 

At stumps on second day, Railways were sitting pretty at 111 for three. 

In Chennai, opener Vidyuth Sivaramakrishnan?s unbeaten 97 propelled Tamil Nadu to reach 183 for one in reply to Hyderabads first innings total of 163 at close on the second day of their Group B encounter here Monday. 

Earlier, Hyderabad, overnight 83 for five, had been bundled out for 163 with left arm spinner, Ram Kumar being the destroyer in chief with six scalps.

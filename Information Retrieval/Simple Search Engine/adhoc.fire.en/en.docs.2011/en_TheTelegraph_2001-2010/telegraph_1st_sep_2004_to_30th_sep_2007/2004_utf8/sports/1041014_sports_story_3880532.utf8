The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Sourav plays down the toss factor 

 - Second Test

 It?s Patel versus Yuvraj as Sehwag?s partner 

 INDRANIL MAJUMDAR 

 Irfan Pathan and Anil Kumble during a practice session at the Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai on Wednesday 

Chennai: As sports photographs go. It may be short on aesthetic value but its intrinsic worth cannot be undermined, especially to the battered morale of this Indian team. 

Samir Dighe on his knees in the middle of the pitch with Harbhajan Singh rushing in to embrace him after the winning run during the historic series triumph in 2001. Tucked in one corner among various other feats at the Chepauk, the image may often go unnoticed, but is sure to revive memories and inspire the Indians. 

It may be imprudent to draw a parallel, but in various ways, the start to the current TVS series is sure to turn the clock back. Wiser by the experience, Adam Gilchrist is leaving nothing to chance. The stand-in Australian captain?s cautious approach is apparent when he says, ?the Indians are going to come hard at us?. 

The ghost of Eden Gardens and 2001 still haunts the Aussies, inviting their circumspect attitude at every step. The Bangalore victory has not bred complacency, it has only increased manifold their determination to excel. The plans to make life hard for every Indian have been in place for months, and its execution has so far been smart and effective. 

Gilchrist echoed much of the same sentiments on Wednesday. ?Just as the Indians are hungry, we too have studied and analysed what the Indians have done in Bangalore. We?ll stick to what we believe is right and try and execute our plans.? 

The brown colour and slightly scruffy look of the pitch for this second Test again suggests a sharing of the spoils for the Indian spinners. It is already dry and chances are that, though, it will have a little more pace and bounce than the one in Bangalore, it may also get trickier as it wears. 

The toss will again assume great significance in the circumstances. The side batting first will obviously enjoy the advantage, though, it might not become unplayable till the third day. 

 Kaif may win his first 

 Test Cap in three years

The Indian captain, though, believes otherwise. ?The toss shouldn?t be a decisive factor here. It?s how you fare over the next five days will count in the end. The wicket seems a better surface than the one in the first Test and will last a bit more,? said Sourav. 

The bit of ?extra bounce? will work both ways for Australia ? who are unlikely to make any change to the winning side ? and Gilchrist admitted as much. ?The extra bounce will mean more of a threat from Harbhajan. But it will also have a positive effect on Warnie and the fast bowlers.? 

One big reason for the Indians? defeat in Bangalore has been the openers? inability to get going. Virender Sehwag and Akash Chopra failed miserably in both the innings. Contrast this then with their, and the team?s performance in Australia, and the difference is apparent. That the lower-order contributed much more than the top-six in the first Test only goes to show that the latter lacked application and the resolve. 

Both captains, too, stressed on the need to have runs on the board. ?There?s only one answer to our problem and that is we have to bat well. I?ve always believed that if you got to win a Test match you?ve to score in excess of 350,? Sourav said. 

Gilchrist was also forthcoming. ?Whether you bat first or second, you just cannot give up easily in your first innings. You?ve to set up big totals. That?s where you set up victories.? 

India?s batting blues, sans Sachin Tendulkar, have forced a rethink at the top-order. Consultant Sunil Gavaskar had a close look at Yuvraj Singh and Parthiv Patel during nets on Wednesday, and it is likely that any one of them will open the innings with Sehwag. That will mean Chopra getting the axe. While for Yuvraj it will be a ?debut? of sorts, Parthiv had opened with Sehwag in the Rawalpindi Test. 

The exit of Chopra will give Mohammed Kaif his first Test cap in three years, having last played against Sri Lanka at the SSC in Colombo. The hosts, though, are still undecided on replacing Zaheer Khan with Ajit Agarkar. 

Gilchrist did not try to play down the Sachin factor. ?There?s definitely a different feel today in the Indian line-up without Sachin. I?m sure he has a calming influence on their team. No doubt, he?s experienced. But I am not discounting the Indians producing a fantastic performance. They?ve been hurt? 

?I?ve been in this sort of circumstances before where the Indians have lost and former players suggesting wholesale changes? Sachin is the best I?ve seen, but it wasn?t he who turned the match on its head in Calcutta.? 

The Australians will take the field tomorrow wearing black armbands to pay tribute to Keith Miller and in memory of the Bali blast victims a couple of years ago. ?For Justin Langer and myself, it will also be an occasion to mourn the death of a dear friend (Mark Warnum) who lost his battle with cancer recently,? Gilchrist informed. 

For Shane Warne, this Test should turn out to be a memorable one. The leg-spinner finds himself just one short of Muttiah Muralidharan?s world record tally of 532 wickets. As Gilchrist puts it, the Aussies are ?ready? for the celebrations. ?There?s no pressure on him from within the team. All the fuss is from outside.? 

Warne and the Indians will only hope that the weather gods ? a downpour lashed the city early Wednesday morning ? don?t deprive them of any drama over the next five days.

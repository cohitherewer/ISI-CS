 Yadav hands India winner 

 Abhishek Yadav 

New Delhi: There is nothing to gain from India?s final World Cup qualifying engagement against Oman. Not even pride as the coach Stephen Constantine is himself under pressure and going by the AIFF?s mood, may be sacked after that inconsequential November 17 tie. 

However, a trace of inspiration can be drawn from the fact that Constantine?s boys put up a spirited show in a 3-2 win over Kuwait in an international friendly in Kuwait city on Friday. 

According to information reaching here, the match was tied 2-2 till the 70th minute, before Abhishek Yadav scored the winner for India. 

Tomba Singh and Zerry Jirsanga were the other scorers. 

India will continue their preparatory camp in the capital before leaving for Oman. 

India went out of the reckoning in the World Cup qualifiers after losing to Oman and Japan at home. They were also beaten in their away matches to Japan and Singapore. 

India?s only win came against Singapore at home, thanks to a Rennedy Singh strike. That was India?s lone goal in the entire World Cup qualifying phase. 

However, the win against Kuwait may be a morale booster for Constantine?s wards ahead of the Oman match as they will like to sign off on a positive note. 

Oman, it may be recalled, thrashed India 5-0 in Bangalore.

 Anindita, Saurav shine on Day II

 - National Ranking Table Tennis 

 Poulami Ghatak will face Nandita Saha in the semi-finals 

Manesar: Railway Sports Promotion Board?s Anindita Chakraborty and Saurav Chakraborty took the honours on the second day of the national ranking table tennis (north zone) meet as they showed nerves of steel to register come-from-behind wins over their higher-rated opponents in the quarter finals. 

Seventh seed Anindita ousted second-seeded Mouma Das (PSPB) 8-11, 11-8, 7-11, 8-11, 11-6, 12-10, 11-7, while Saurav overturned a 0-3 deficit to beat fourth seed Arup Basak 9-11, 10-12, 3-11, 11-4, 11-9, 11-3, 11-9 in the men?s event. 

Saurav, who had to save three match points in the first round before beating Birupakshya Saha of Andhra Pradesh, once again showed that he had a calm head on his shoulders as he made the veteran Basak to move around and use some sedate placements on occasion. 

In the semi-finals, Saurav will take on top seed and national champion A. Sharath Kamal, who had little trouble in packing off Jignesh Jaiswal of Gujarat 9-11, 11-6, 11-9, 11-6, 11-2. 

Sixth seed Soumyadeep Roy then got the better of third seed Ranbir Das 11-6, 11-7, 8-11, 8-11, 13-11, 11-13, 11-3 to set up a semi-final clash with second seed Subhajit Saha of PSPB. 

Subhajit thrashed unseeded Shivaji Dutta 11-3, 11-7, 11-7, 11-8 in just 20 minutes to book a berth in the last four. 

Anindita, who has been the lone challenger to PSPB?s supremacy in the women?s section, was facing defeat as she trailed 1-3 going into the fourth game. 

She now faces third seed N.R. Indu of PSPB for a final berth. The PSPB player did not had to sweat much for a semi-final berth as her opponent and teammate, Mantu Ghosh, conceded the match sighting leg pain after she was trailing 11-9, 11-8, 11-6. 

Women?s top seed and national champion Poulami Ghatak was also made to work hard by her PSPB teammate T. Pradeepa for a berth in last four. 

Poulami lost two of the first three games but then recovered to win 12-10, 4-11, 2-11, 11-9, 11-9, 11-4 and set up a semi-final clash with Nandita Saha also of PSPB. 

Nandita defeated Vishakha Vijay 12-10, 13-11, 4-11, 11-7, 11-5 in the quarter finals. 

In the junior boy?s, top seed Zubin Kumar was shown the door by unheralded Somyajeet Ghosh of Siliguri 11-9, 7-11, 6-11, 13-11, 11-9, 3-11, 11-8 in the pre-quarterfinals.

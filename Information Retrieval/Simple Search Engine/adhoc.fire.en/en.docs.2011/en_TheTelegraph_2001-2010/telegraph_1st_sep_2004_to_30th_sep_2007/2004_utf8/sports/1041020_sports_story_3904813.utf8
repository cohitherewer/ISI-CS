The Telegraph - Calcutta

 4th straight win for Indian eves 

 - CHESS OLYMPIAD - Humpy gets the better of IM Zhaoqin 

 P. Harikrishna 

Mallorca: Grandmaster Koneru Humpy outmanoeuvred International Master Peng Zhaoqin as the Indian eves registered their fourth victory on the trot in the women?s section of the 36th chess Olympiad here. The Indian women won 2-1 against The Netherlands whose 15th seeding barely indicates the true strength of the team. 

Meanwhile, GMs P. Harikrishna and Abhijit Kunte came up with spirited shows, guiding the Indian men to a 2.5-1.5 victory over the US after Viswanathan Anand settled for an easy draw with Alexander Onischuk in the fourth round (as reported in Tuesday?s Late City edition). 

The big victory for the Indian team came on the second board when Harikrishna crashed through the defences of higher rated Alexander Shabalov. On the third board Abhijit Kunte grounded the experience of Alexander Goldin while on fourth board Sandipan Chanda went down fighting to Igor Novikov 

In the women?s section, the onus to give a good start was on Humpy after both IM S. Vijayalakshmi and Dronavalli Harika had settled for early draws with Tea Bosboom-Lanchava and Petra Schuurman, respectively, and the Andhra girl?s steely nerves were again on display in the long drawn encounter. 

Top seed and defending champions China surged ahead in the event after beating overnight joint leaders Germany by 2.5-1.5 margin. China took their tally to 11 points and thus became the first team to reach the double figure mark. Russia, Ukraine and England were next in line with 9.5 points apiece while India, France and Germany were sharing the fifth spot on 9 points each. 

It was the king?s Indian defence that gave Humpy the crucial victory. 

?I knew I had to go for a win after both my teammates had drawn. I even took some risks and that paid off well in the end,? she said after the gruelling contest. 

The middle game was of violent nature and Zhaoqin apprantly had a good advantage to boast off but Humpy with her never-say-die attitude warded off white?s threat in style and generated play on the king side. 

Running out of time in the middle game, Zhaoqin failed to sustain the pressure and lost an exchange with some counter play still remaining. The game lasted 45 moves. 

On the second board, it was certainly not what Vijayalakshmi had wished for. 

Having come well armed to tackle Lanchava who played black, Vijayalakshmi was in for a surprise very early as she was up against a phillidor, an opening that her opponent used for the first time. 

Vijayalakshmi, in trying to play simple, went for the early trade of queens that guaranteed white a tiny advantage rather than the trademark complications. Soon a roughly balanced position was on the board and Lanchava came up with the draw offer after 11th move. 

Playing black against Schuurman, Harika faced the main variation in the grunfeld and struggled for quite some time in the middle game before signing peace in 21 moves. This was Harika?s third straight draw and she was still waiting her first victory here.

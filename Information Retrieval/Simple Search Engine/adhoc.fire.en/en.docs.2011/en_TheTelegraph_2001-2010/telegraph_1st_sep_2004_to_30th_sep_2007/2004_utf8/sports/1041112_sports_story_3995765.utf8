The Telegraph - Calcutta

 India need a panel of experts: Douglas

 Indians have good technique but lack power, feels Douglas 

New Delhi: India can catch up with other football powers of Asia only if it ropes in a professional panel of coaches and support staff, according East Bengal?s Brazilan star Douglas Da Silva. 

Douglas said there was too much work pressure on India?s chief coach Stephen Constantine and it was important to have specialists to assist him. 

?In India there is only Stephen who has to double up in every other role ? fitness trainer, goalkeeping coach et al. You need experts to fill up different roles,? said Douglas, enjoying his third season in Calcutta with India?s champion club. 

He said leading countries have a big team of experts numbering at least ten besides the coach. ?You need specialists in every field and that is what India lacks,? Douglas said here. 

Commenting on what he saw during his stay in the country, Douglas said India have good players. ?Indians have good technique but not the required power,? he said. 

The Brazilian, now an integral part of the red and gold brigade, also stressed on the importance of meticulous planning before taking part in international tournaments. 

?There should be careful planning with stress on each and every aspect like psychology, fitness, ball control etc.,? Douglas said. 

Citing the example of Asian powerhouses Japan and China, Douglas said: ?Indians have more quality than Japan and more technique than the Chinese. But the two countries are miles ahead because of proper planning over the years.? 

The native of Sao Paulo said after playing for three years in Calcutta his love for India and Brazil is now 50-50. ?I came to India, after playing for 16 clubs including Pele?s club Santos, because before I stop I want to give my experience to a country trying to come up,? Douglas said. 

The 33-year-old star said he will quit the game ?the day I am unable to produce my best.? 

Douglas also said he was interested in some kind of coaching stint once he hangs up his boots. ?I am interested to work as a coach but I don?t want to think about it now as I still have a few more years left as a player.?

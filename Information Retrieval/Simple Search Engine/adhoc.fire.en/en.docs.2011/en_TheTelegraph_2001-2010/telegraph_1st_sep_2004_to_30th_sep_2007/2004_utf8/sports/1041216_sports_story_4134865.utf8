New Delhi: Having capped a ?satisfactory? season with a win in the Volvo Masters, India?s ace golfer Jyoti Randhawa is now training his sight on earning a qualification for the prestigious US PGA Tour at the earliest. 

?I have been playing well and have the ability to play with the world?s best. I have now focussed myself on qualifying for the US PGA Tour,? Randhawa reiterated his earlier-expressed wish while talking to reporters on the sidelines of the Mizuno Fair at the Delhi Golf Course here Wednesday. 

He had expressed this wish earlier too, but had not been able to arrange the requisite time for a proper qualification to the elite Tour, on which the only Indian playing is Calcutta?s Arjun Atwal. 

?For qualifying for the US PGA you have to play three weeks in three months. This time I was too tired and could not give it my best shot. I am now looking at more consistency, especially mentally, and I have no doubt that I can be in that league sooner than later,? he said. 

The 32-year-old, who mostly plays on the Japanese Tour, said he had received a couple of invitations to play on the US circuit after winning the Volvo Masters and was looking forward to these. 

He said the victory at the Volvo Masters in Kuala Lumpur last week was very significant for him as it came after a year-long wait. ?I had not won anything for a year and hence the win is very significant. I had been finishing in the top five but a win at the end of the year is more than satisfactory.? 

Comparing the Japanese Tour with the Asian PGA, Randhawa said the former was tougher since the greens were a lot faster and it was more difficult to finish in the top 10. 

On the golfing scene in India, Randhawa said the sport had come a long way in the last five years and there were many players who could now compete with the best in the world. ?Five years back no one outside knew about India. Now we can get good equipment here, many courses have come up and in all there is a boom in the sport,? he added.

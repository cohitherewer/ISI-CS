 Miandad?s fresh tirade 

 Miandad accuses Woolmer of insulting players and country 

Islamabad: Continuing his tirade against Bob Woolmer, former Pakistan coach Javed Miandad has accused the Englishman of insulting the players as well as the country by his critical remarks following the team?s defeat to Australia. 

?Criticising one?s own team with such remarks is an insult of not only the players but of the entire nation and it would be better if the coach handles the situation by motivating the players,? Miandad was quoted as saying in the daily Dawn. 

?The boys need motivation and not criticism from their coach as they have a long and exacting tour ahead in Australia,? Miandad said. 

The remark which has irked Miandad pertains to the one in which the current Pakistan coach said, ?obviously there is an element of mental confusion or mental awe within the performance?. 

Miandad said: ?You have to show loyalty to the country from which you are earning your bread and butter, but by making such remarks you are insulting them and as a Pakistani and former coach of the same team, I am deeply hurt as well as disappointed.? (PTI)

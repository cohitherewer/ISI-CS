 Trio asked to show cause

New Delhi: As the banned weightlifters are trying hard to prove their innocence, their employers CRPF has issued show cause to Pratima Kumari and S. Sunaina for bringing the nation and the institution to disrepute. Another lifter Sanamacha Chanu had also been issued a notice by the CRPF. 

In a letter to the two lifters, CRPF sports official Khazan Singh asked why disciplinary action should not be taken against them after they were banned for life for doping in international events. 

?The IOA has imposed a life ban on you based on an inquiry conducted by them into the incident of you having been found positive in doping test held in Athens in August for a banned substance,? Singh said in the letter. ?You are now called upon to explain the circumstances of the case and also why disciplinary action should not be taken against you for bringing a bad name to the force and the country,? he said. 

Pratima and Sanamacha, had tested postive for banned substances in the Athens Olympics in August while Sunaina was caught for doping in the Asian championships in Kazakhstan in April following which the three were slapped with life bans by the IOA. (PTI)

 Smart Charmer may claim main event 

 STAR RACER

 Daniel David

 Calcutta: It may turn out to be a straight contest between Smart Charmer and Prime Contender in Wednesday?s main event, the 1,100m Unknown Warrior Cup for horses in Class II. 

 The pace is going to be very hot in the race, thanks to the presence of hot-footed Barrier Ridge and Common Spirit. Under similar conditions, Prime Contender had burst her blood vessels, though Tuesday?s heavy rains may bring the temperature down to her liking. Smart Charmer, on the other hand, may find the hot-pace and the wet-track to his advantage. Although outclassed by a vastly-improved Accuser in his last outing over 1,400m, the Daniel David-trainee may relish the staled trip and strike in the hands of Kavan Kariappa.

 Two smart youngsters ? Calorific and Spar-kling Clear ? also make their debut on the monsoon track and may win their respective events.Read as: Sl no, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

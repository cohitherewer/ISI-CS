 UCB warns Jennings

 Ray Jennings 

Durban: South African cricket coach Ray Jennings has been warned by the country?s cricket board for openly speaking his mind about selection of players. 

The United Cricket Board of South Africa (UCBSA) has warned Jennings in a letter that said that he was in breach of his contract by making comments to the media. 

The board especially referred to a Sunday newspaper report in which he spoke his mind about wanting former wicketkeeper Mark Boucher to return to the national team. 

This statement by implication meant that new cap Thami Tsolekile should be dropped. Tsolekile was part of the team that toured India recently. 

The South African coach is also understood to have said in many interviews that opening batsman Herschelle Gibbs should decide whether he wanted to play cricket at all or not. 

?He should decide either to play or ship out,? Jennings is reported to have said. 

Gibbs, along with Nicky Boje, had decided not to tour India fearing interrogation by the New Delhi police in connection with the match-fixing scandal in 2000. 

While Boje has been recalled to the team for a series against England, Gibbs has been left out because of injury. 

The board, by mistake, had sent to the media the warning letter that had been faxed to Jennings. 

The letter was subsequently withdrawn but the media had by then already picked up the story. Jennings has not yet commented on the warning issued to him.

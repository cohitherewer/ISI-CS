 ?Lanka learning to win sans Murali?

 - TRI-SERIES - We have found some good all-round players: Dyson

Karachi: Sri Lanka are learning to win without Muttiah Muralidharan, according to coach John Dyson. 

?There is no doubt he is a world-class bowler,? Dyson told a news conference in Karachi on Monday, prior to the tri-series clash against Pakistan on Wednesday. 

?But we have played without him in the last few months and we beat South Africa comprehensively at home. I think we have found some good all round players in the last few months to add value to the side.? 

Sri Lanka, accused in the past of being a one-man team, beat the South Africans 1-0 in a two-Test series in August before trouncing them 5-0 in the one-day series. 

Muralidharan, the world?s leading Test wicket-taker, has not played since the first Test against South Africa after undergoing surgery on his right shoulder. 

Sri Lanka will take on the hosts in a two-Test series after the triangular one-day Internationals. The hosts won the opening two games of the tri-series against Zimbabwe in Multan and Peshawar. 

Sri Lanka captain Maravan Atapattu said Pakistan are the favourites for both the one-day event and the Test series after improving in the last few months under new coach Bob Woolmer. 

?Beating them at home is going to be a challenge in the one-dayers and the two Tests. But we will give it our best shot and we have a good all round side for the one-dayers and Tests. We have come prepared,? he said. 

Sri Lanka lost to England in the Champions Trophy last month, but had won 18 out of 22 one-dayers in the previous 12 months, drawing four and winning four Test matches. 

?We had one bad day in England and were out of the tournament. We can?t afford to have that bad day on this tour,? Dyson added.

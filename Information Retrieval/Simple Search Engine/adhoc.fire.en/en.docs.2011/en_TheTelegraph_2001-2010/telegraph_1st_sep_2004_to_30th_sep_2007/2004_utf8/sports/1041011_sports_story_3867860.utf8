 ZCU puts up a brave front

Rawalpindi: The Zimbabwe Cricket Union (ZCU) on Sunday said they were looking forward to the submission of a report on racism at next week?s board meeting of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in Lahore. 

?We have been on the wrong side of the rope since April, involved in matters that have taken prominence over cricket,? ZCU president Peter Chingoka said on Sunday. 

?But I am glad that the ICC inquiry on racism in Zimbabwe cricket has been completed and will be presented next week.? 

An inquiry was set up by the ICC to hear allegations of racism within the ZCU levelled by 15 white rebel players, who have refused to play since April when former captain Heath Streak was replaced for questioning the national body. 

The hearing in Harare last month was abandoned after the players objected to the presence of ZCU officials while evidence was being presented and the inquiry panel was forced to finalise their report on the basis of written submissions. 

?We have tried to resolve the issues and have welcomed the inquiry because we do not practice racism in our cricket,? added Chingoka. 

?We have always said at all times that we are dealing with this issue with an open mind. Our doors are open for the players who want to come back. 

?The rebel players have nothing to fear if they decide to come back. We are sincere and genuine about resolving this dispute as soon as possible.?

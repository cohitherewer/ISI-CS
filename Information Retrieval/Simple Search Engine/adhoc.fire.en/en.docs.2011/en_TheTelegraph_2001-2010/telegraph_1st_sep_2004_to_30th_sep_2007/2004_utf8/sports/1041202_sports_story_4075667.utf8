The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Only a miracle can save visitors 

Neutral View

 Day IV was always going to be 

 tough for South Africa. But once again they scraped hard, 

 and as we have seen in both Test matches so far, are extremely 

 well planned and disciplined in their approach. They bowled 

 straight and accurate with much better use of the short 

 ball, which is an ideal change-up in conditions rapidly 

 starting to become inconsistent. It is definitely a myth 

 that the bouncer is ineffective in the sub-continent. From 

 a batsman?s perspective, it can be frightfully difficult 

 negotiating a ball banged in when the bounce is unpredictable.

 India only managed a further 52 

 runs to close their innings 106 runs ahead of the tourists. 

 This equates to more like a 160-180-run lead given the wear 

 and tear of the pitch. From this point it is always going 

 to be a massive task and South Africa need almost a miracle 

 to save the match. I am sure Ray Jennings and Graeme Smith 

 realise their problem started as soon as they were unable 

 to convert a gutsy batting effort on Day I into at least 

 a 400-run first innings total. 

 Opening the batting and facing 

 the new ball is without doubt the best position to bat on 

 in India, particularly late in a match at Eden Gardens. 

 The pitch here maintains pace and predictable bounce with 

 the new ball throughout. So with the right attitude, openers 

 can get off to a bit of a flyer, which is a good ploy in 

 the second innings when you know Anil Kumble and Harbhajan 

 Singh are soon going to be brought into the attack.

 Smith and Andrew Hall made good 

 use of this period immediately after lunch to put on a 77-run 

 opening stand in 23 overs. But the 23rd over was significant. 

 As if out of nowhere, Kumble seemed to be bowling with a 

 different ball or on a different pitch. The ball suddenly 

 decided to leap off a length and turned dramatically and 

 one could sense something was going to happen. It was then 

 in the very next over that Harbhajan got the necessary breakthrough 

 and then very quickly collected his second, that of Jacques 

 Rudolph not offering a shot. 

 Mr Reliable, Jacques Kallis, joined 

 Smith, and after a lucky break just before tea (a bat-pad 

 chance ruled not out), a draw seemed a slight possibility 

 once again. South Africa desperately tried to find a formula 

 to counter the spin twins, as well as keep the scoreboard 

 ticking over. But in these conditions, a batsman can get 

 out to any ball. Smith found this out when he covered a 

 full-length delivery from Harbhajan, only to see it brilliantly 

 caught at first slip by V.V.S. Laxman. The next two wickets 

 of Boeta Dippenaar and Hashim Amla fell quickly with South 

 Africa finishing the day 66 runs ahead.

 Predictably, Harbhajan captured 

 four wickets and Kumble one. 

 Can South Africa save this match? 

 Only if Kallis scores 150 plus and someone like De Bruyn 

 or Ontong can hang around for quite a while. Kallis was 

 the prize fighter in the first innings and though he is 

 good, I believe it is too big an order to expect the same. 

 Where were his helpers on Days I and II?

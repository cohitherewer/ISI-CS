The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Trio follows Gilchrist path

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

Chennai: It should go down as a record of sorts as four batsmen walked off without waiting for the umpire?s decision on the opening day of the second Test. Adam Gilchrist showed the way after being caught by Yuvraj Singh at forward short leg off Anil Kumble. 

Jason Gillespie and Michael Kasprowicz followed. Not to be left behind, Yuvraj Singh, too, chose to go the Aussie way. The players? decision often left the umpires dumbstruck. 

?A lot was made of umpiring decisions in Bangalore and, so, the players thought it best to walk off,? Gilchrist said later. ?It?s an individual thing and no team policy is followed in this respect. I did it during the World Cup last year and repeated the same again today. 

?We?ve got to wait and see if this continues. It?s a positive thing but I won?t try and force it on anybody,? the stand-in captain remarked. 

Anil Kumble also found it encouraging. ?It?s a great thing for the sport. When there is so much of talk on players? behaviour on the field, these sort of examples count a lot. It also reveals the character shown by the player.?

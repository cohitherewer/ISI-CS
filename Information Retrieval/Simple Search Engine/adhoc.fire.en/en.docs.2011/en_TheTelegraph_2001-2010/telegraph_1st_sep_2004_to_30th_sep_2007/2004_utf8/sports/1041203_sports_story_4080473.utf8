The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Kumble, Laxman not in ODI squad

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The national selectors on Thursday preferred youngsters, keeping in mind minnows Bangladesh as opponents, while not picking Anil Kumble and V.V.S. Laxman in the 15-member squad for the one-day series. 

Technically, though, they have been dropped since there has been no official word from the players making themselves unavailable for the series. Jharkhand wicketkeeper Mahender Singh Dhoni and Haryana seamer Joginder Sharma earned their maiden India call-up. 

THE XV 

Openers: Virender Sehwag, Sachin Tendulkar. 

Middle-order: Sourav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid, Dinesh Mongia, Yuvraj Singh, Mohammed Kaif, S. Sriram. 

Wicketkeeper: Mahender Singh Dhoni. 

Spinners: Harbhajan Singh, Murali Kartik. 

Mediumpacers: Zaheer Khan, Irfan Pathan, Ajit Agarkar, Joginder Sharma.

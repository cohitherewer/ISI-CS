 Lehmann ready to give up slot

 Lehmann ready to sit out for Clarke when Ponting returns 

Sydney: Australia?s problem of plenty in the batting department came to the fore once again with their acting vice-captain Darren Lehmann volunteering to give up his spot for rookie Michael Clarke after the return of the injured regular skipper Ricky Ponting. 

Lehmann, who knows that at least one member of the current playing 11 would have to make way for Ponting ? who is likely to return for the third Test in Nagpur ? said Clarke had the potential of being the future Australian captain and should be a regular in the national line-up for the next decade. 

?If a guy plays a genius? knock like that in the first innings of his first Test and is earmarked by all of us to play well, you have to let him in,? Lehmann was quoted as saying by the Sydney Morning Herald here on Wednesday. 

The 23-year-old Clarke scored a brilliant 151 in his debut Test innings in Bangalore to help the Australians win the first Test by 217 runs. 

?If I was a selector, I would think Michael Clarke should play every Test for the next 10 or 12 years. That would be my opinion. Obviously someone has got to miss out. Ricky comes back for the third Test. It?s part of life. You don?t worry about it too much. 

?It might be the case that I stand down. I haven?t ruled that out. That?s something I?ll think about after this match,? he said. 

Lehmann, who will turn 35 in four months, said he would be talking with the selectors after the second Test here. 

[Our Correspondent adds from Chennai: Adam Gilchrist had this to say: ?Ricky has got a scan tomorrow and only then we will know the scenario. To speculate on what will happen is probably a waste of time at the moment. 

?And Lehmann saying he is not going to stand in the way of a younger player doesn?t mean that he is retiring. I think what he is saying is that if a hard decision is to be made and he gets tapped on the shoulder, he won?t go kidding and screaming. He?ll understand why. 

?But he is in no way meaning that he is giving up,? Gilchrist said.]

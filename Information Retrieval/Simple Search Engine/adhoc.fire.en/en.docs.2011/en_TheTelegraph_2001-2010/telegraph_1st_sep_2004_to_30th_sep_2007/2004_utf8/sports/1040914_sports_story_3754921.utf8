 No room for complacency, says Inzamam

Birmingham: Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul-Haq has insisted that there will be no room for complacency when the side opens the Champions Trophy campaign against Kenya in the pool C match at on Edgbaston on Tuesday. 

?We have a serious game and we will treat it very seriously. We will play with a full strength side,? Inzamam said. 

Pakistan have a young side with only three players in their 30s, Inzamam, wicket-keeper Moin Khan and batsman Yousuf Youhana. And Inzamam said he enjoyed captaining a young side. 

?It?s lovely for me because the young boys are willing to perform well.? 

Kenya and the United States ? have all been on the end of huge defeats at the Champions Trophy that have done little for the tournament as a whole. 

?I think the small teams need more experience,? said a sympathetic Inzamam. ?I know they are small teams but something needs to be done.? 

However, for Kenya captain Steve Tikolo warm words are not enough. His side upset the old order by reaching the semi-finals of last year?s cricket World Cup. And their one-day International status ought to have put them in a better position than other ?minnows?. 

But until Saturday?s match Kenya had gone 18 months without playing a one-day International. Afterwards Tikolo criticised administrators for leaving his side with such a long break. (AFP)

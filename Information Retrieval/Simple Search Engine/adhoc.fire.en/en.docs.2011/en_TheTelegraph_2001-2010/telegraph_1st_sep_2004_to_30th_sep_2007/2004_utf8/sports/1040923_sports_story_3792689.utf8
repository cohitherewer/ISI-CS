The Telegraph - Calcutta

 New meet on anvil

 A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: The Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF), in association with the All India Football Federation (AIFF), is planning to launch a tournament called the Ganga-Padma Cup. 

The tournament, scheduled to be held annually, once in Calcutta and once in Dhaka, will involve four club teams each from the two cities. 

BFF chief S. A. Sultan had a meeting with AIFF supremo Priya Ranjan Das Munshi in New Delhi late last month and it is learnt that the proposal has received a positive response. 

If everything goes to plan, the tournament will be held here in November and the return leg will be held in March-April next in Dhaka after the renovation work at the Bangabandhu Stadium is over. While the tournament will be named Ganga-Padma Cup in India, it will be known as Padma-Ganga Cup when played in the neighbouring country. 

Teams from the city to have been sounded are East Bengal, Mohun Bagan and Mohammedan Sporting, while Tollygunge Agragami might be the fourth team to feature in the meet. 

Meanwhile, East Bengal have sent a letter to the IFA on Tuesday seeking the release of Habibur Rahman Mondol following the no-objection certificate issued by Mohun Bagan. 

IFA in its turn sent the letter to the AIFF on Wednesday. In another development the women?s league has been pushed back to November, because of a paucity of funds. The league was to have been over by September 11, but most teams failed to present their complement of players. 

 EB, Bagan win 

East Bengal defeated Wari AC by a brace in the IFA under-19 soccer league at East Bengal ground on Wednesday. In another match, Mohun Bagan beat Mohammedan Sporting 1-0 via a Samar Das strike while at the BNMC ground, Ever-Ready beat Eastern Railway 2-0. 

The group-A match between Tollygunge Agragami and Mohammedan AC at the Barasat Stadium was abandoned due to rain. The match will be re-played on Thursday.

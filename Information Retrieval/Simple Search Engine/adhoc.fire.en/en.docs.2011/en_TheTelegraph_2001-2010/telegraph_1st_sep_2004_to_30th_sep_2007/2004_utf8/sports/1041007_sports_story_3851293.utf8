 Pak crush Lanka to make final 

 - Youhana, Malik share unbroken stand of 200 for third wicket 

 Yusuf Youhana after reaching his century at the National Stadium in Karachi on Wednesday 

Karachi: Yusuf Youhana top-scored with an unbeaten 107 to guide Pakistan to an eight-wicket victory over Sri Lanka and into the final of a three-nation one-day tournament on Wednesday. 

Youhana and allrounder Shoaib Malik, who struck 86 not out, shared an unbroken stand of 200 for the third wicket as Pakistan reached 233 for two in reply to Sri Lanka?s 232 for nine. 

It was Pakistan?s third successive win in the tournament and they will meet either Sri Lanka or Zimbabwe in the October 16 final in Lahore. 

Youhana, who hit seven fours and a six in 121 balls, became Pakistan?s sixth batsman to reach 6,000 runs in one-day Internationals when he moved to 67. 

His hundred was the 10th of his career and followed scores of one and 14 in Pakistan?s previous matches against Zimbabwe. Youhana and Malik joined forces with Pakistan on 33 for two in the 12th over after fast bowlers Chaminda Vaas and Nuwan Zoysa had removed openers Yasir Hameed (13) and Salman Butt (17) in three balls. 

Hameed and Butt struggled against the new ball, only two boundaries coming in the first 10 overs which yielded 30 runs. 

Sri Lanka used six bowlers in a bid to dislodge Malik and Youhana but the batsmen were in flowing form to the delight of a 20,000 home crowd. 

Earlier, Malik took three for 32 to help restrict Asian champions Sri Lanka in the third match of the tournament. 

Malik kept the innings in check by first smartly running out a dangerous looking Sanath Jayasuriya (53) then dismissing Maravan Atapattu (46), Mahela Jayawardene (18) and Tillekeratne Dilshan (4). 

He helped put the brakes on Sri Lanka who are playing their first game since their Champions Trophy defeat by England last month. 

The visitors lost their way in the last 10 overs scoring 56 runs and losing five wickets after winning the toss and batting first in hot conditions. 

After the second-over dismissal of Avishka Gunawardene when he dragged a ball from Rana Naved on to his stumps, Jayasuriya and skipper Atapattu anchored the innings with a 109-run stand off 144 balls. 

Jayasuriya greeted fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar?s first ball with a six over mid-wicket and went on to make his 57th half century before he was run out in the 23rd over to trigger the batting slump. Malik ran out Jayasuriya off his own bowling. 

Malik had Atapattu caught by Inzamam-ul-Haq for 46 from 75 balls then bowled Jayawardene when he went to cut the ball and had Dilshan caught behind by stand-in keeper Younis Khan. 

He was lucky to pick up the wicket of Dilshan as television replays suggested the ball had missed the bat on way to the wicketkeeper, but Pakistan umpire Asad Rauf took a long time before deciding in the bowler?s favour. 

Mohammad Sami bowled the in-form Kumar Sangakkarra (38 from 52 balls) and Shahid Afridi bowled Upul Chandana (9).

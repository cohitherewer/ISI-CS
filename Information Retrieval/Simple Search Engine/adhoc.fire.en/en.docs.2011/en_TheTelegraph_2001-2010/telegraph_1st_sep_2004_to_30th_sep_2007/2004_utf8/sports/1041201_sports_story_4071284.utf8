The Telegraph - Calcutta

 India beat Spain to level series

 Chauhan stakes claim for No. 1 keeper?s slot 

Chandigarh: India overcame Olympic semi-finalists Spain with a 3-2 win in the second and final hockey Test here Tuesday to gain a big psychological boost ahead of the Champions Trophy starting later this week. 

India, who had lost by a similar margin in the first Test Sunday, played an aggressive game to level the series 1-1 with Ignace Tirkey (10th), Sandeep Singh (25th) and Arjun Halappa (57th) scoring for them in the tension-filled encounter. 

The match saw the home side racing to a 2-0 lead in the first half itself and even though the Spaniards bounced back after the break, they could not break the Indian defence in the final minutes for an equaliser. Spain scored both their goals through penalty corner conversions by Pau Quemada (48th) and Alberto Esteban (59th). 

It was an overall good display by the Indian team which played much better than they did in the first Test. 

Devesh Chauhan, who has played second fiddle to Adrian D?Souza ever since the Athens Olympics, manned the post brilliantly in the first half to stake a strong claim for an elevation to ?keeper No. 1. 

Adrian, who replaced his senior after the break as coach Gerhard Rach made some experiments in the side?s final competitive match before the elite six-nation event in Lahore, also did well and came up with couple of fine saves. 

The initial few minutes saw Spain continuing from where they had left on Sunday, playing with purpose and unleashing some fine attacks. 

But as the match progressed, the Indians grew in confidence, making regular inroads into the rival defence and finishing their moves with stunning goals. (PTI)

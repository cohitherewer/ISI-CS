 RCTC firm on Wednesday?s fixtures 

 STAR RACER

Calcutta: Stewards of the Royal Calcutta Turf 

Club (RCTC) have decided to go ahead with Wednesday?s fixtures despite the bandh 

call given by a political partner in the ruling state government. ?We are 

crammed for dates. Mumbai season begins from Thursday. Bangalore follows thereafter,? 

said Boman Parakh, secretary RCTC. 

 In the past, RCTC had managed to conduct off-course betting but it always avoided clash of the city racing with a bandh day. The government?s decision not to support the bandh may have prompted RCTC to go ahead with the programme. Incidentally, sport in Maidan comes to a standstill on such days.

 ?We have consulted the various government agencies before taking the decision. Police presence in the racecourse will be adequate on the day,? added Parakh. 

 Nevertheless, Wednesday?s eight events offer well-packed fields with three trophies on the cards ? including the Artaius Cup for horses in Class I and Class II. First race starts at 12 noon.

London: Sweden made no mistake with a 7-0 flier over Malta but other big guns including European champions Greece, former champions France, England, Denmark and Turkey all failed to successfully take off when World Cup qualifying action began across the world on Saturday. 

Sweden crushed Malta 7-0 in their opening Group Eight match in TaQali with Zlatan Ibrahimovic scoring four times including a hattrick in the opening 14 minutes. 

But Greece, playing their first competitive match since being crowned European champions in July, crashed 1-2 at northern neighbours Albania whose fans celebrated the Group Two victory as if they had qualified for the finals themselves. 

One man died and seven were injured in clashes between Greek and Albanian fans. 

France, who just over two years ago were world and European champions, are proving those days are well behind them following the international retirements of Zinedine Zidane and a host of his glittering colleagues. 

They were held to a 0-0 draw by Israel in Paris in their opening Group Four match and despite dominating most of the play no-one could find the golden key that Zidane used to keep to unlock a tightly regimented defence. 

England appeared to be heading for victory in their opening Group Six match by leading Austria 2-0 with 19 minutes to play in Vienna but ended up drawing 2-2. 

Goals from Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard looked to have given England all three points but Austria took advantage of two errors of judgement by goalkeeper David James to grab a point. 

Denmark were held to a 1-1 draw in Copenhagen by Ukraine, while Turkey, World Cup semi-finalists two years ago, drew by the same score with Georgia in their game in Trabzon. 

But Italy managed a 2-1 Group Five win over Norway in Palermo thanks to an 80th minute winner from substitute Luca Toni. 

Switzerland were one of the other big winners thumping Faroe Islands 6-0 in Basel with Johann Vonlanthen and Alexander Rey both scoring hattricks in their Group Four encounter. 

The Portuguese had a good start by beating Latvia 2-0 in Group Three in Riga. 

There were also impressive wins for Ireland and Poland. Croatia looked lively with a 3-0 home win over Hungary. 

Romania, who missed out on the 2002 finals, maintained their perfect start in the same group with a 2-1 win over Macedonia. Russia and Slovakia drew 1-1 in Group Three in Moscow in a match marked by a minutes silence to commemorate the victims of the school massacre in Beslan on Friday. 

Easy for Argentina 

In Lima, Argentina followed up last weeks Olympic gold medal by beating Peru 3-1 away in a World Cup qualifier on Saturday. Mauro Rosales and Fabricio Coloccini, who were both part of the Olympic squad won beat Paraguay 1-0 in the Athens final, scored the first two goals before substitute Juan Pablo Sorin secured the points in a match marred by two dismissals. 

Jorge Soto had put Peru back on level times early in the second half but could not prevent their fifth successive defeat against Argentina.

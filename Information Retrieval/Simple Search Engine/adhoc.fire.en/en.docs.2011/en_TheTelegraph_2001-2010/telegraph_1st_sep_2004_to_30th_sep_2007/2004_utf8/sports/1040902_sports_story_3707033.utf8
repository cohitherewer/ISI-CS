 Sharapova escapes first-round shutout

 - US OPEN 

- Roddick fires 152mph serve in 72-minute opening salvo 

 Maria Sharapova celebrates after beating Laura Granville at Flushing Meadow on Tuesday. Sharapova won 6-3, 5-7, 7-5 

New York: Defending champion Andy Roddick unleashed the fastest serve in US Open history on his way to a 6-0, 6-2, 6-2 demolition of Scoville Jenkins on Tuesday as Maria Sharapovas tournament was almost ended at the first stage. 

Roddick slammed down a 152mph bullet in his first service game of the night as he overwhelmed Jenkins, the USTA boys under-18 national champion, who was appearing in his first Tour match. 

The second seed raced through his opening match in 72 minutes to set up a potentially tricky second-round meeting with Spains Rafael Nadal. 

Im just glad to be back, Roddick said. I couldnt wait to start the match. I think it was tough for Scoville, but he gave it a good run and hell be back. Hopefully he will look back one day and think it was a cool experience. 

Sharapova arrived in New York billed as the new queen of tennis after her dazzling win over Serena Williams in the Wimbledon final, but she was forced to rough it against gutsy American Laura Granville, scraping through to a 6-3, 5-7, 7-5 victory. 

The Florida-based Russian mixed sublime winners with a rash of unforced errors but showed real character when she served to stay in the match at 4-5 in the decider. When a fierce first serve finally ended the contest after two hours, nine minutes of pulsating action, she breathed a huge sigh of relief and pumped her fists. 

Earlier, top seed and defending womens champion Justine Henin-Hardenne was given a scare by 15-year-old Czech qualifier Nicole Vaidisova when she fell 4-1 behind in the second set after taking the first 6-1 in 17 minutes. 

Normal service was resumed as she won five consecutive games but the Belgian admitted the teenager, who won her first WTA tournament in Vancouver earlier this month, had proved a big surprise. 

I went to sleep a bit at the beginning of the second set and she started to play better, I wasnt ready for it, said the 22-year-old, who returned from a debilitating virus to claim the gold medal at the Athens Olympics. 

Fifth seed Lindsay Davenport, who is one of the favourites to challenge Henin-Hardenne for the title, cruised into the second round with a 6-4, 6-0 defeat of Slovakias Lubomira Kurhajcova her 18th consecutive victory. 

Another serious contender for the title, French Open champion Anastasia Myskina, was equally impressive, crushing Ludmila Cervanova 6-1, 6-0 in 42 minutes to lead a total of 11 Russian women into the second round. Eleventh seed Venus Williams also moved through with an unconvincing 6-3, 7-6 win against Hungarys Petra Mandula. 

In mens first-round action Russias Marat Safin, the 2000 champion, suffered his earliest US Open exit in six attempts as the 13th seed slumped to a 7-6, 6-4, 3-6, 6-3 defeat to experienced Swede Thomas Enqvist. 

Last years beaten mens finalist Juan Carlos Ferrero survived, just, although he will have to improve dramatically if he is going to make a similar impact this year. 

 The Spaniard spent four hours, 28 minutes on Louis Armstrong Court to scramble past Czech qualifier Tomas Zib 4-6, 7-5, 7-6, 6-7, 6-3. 

Fifth seed Tim Henman overcame a painful back and 39 aces from giant Croatian Ivo Karlovic to advance, the Briton recovering from a set down to win 7-6, 6-7, 4-6, 6-4, 6-4. 

Double Olympic gold-medallist Nicolas Massu of Chile maintained his hot streak, blasting away Jose Acasuso of Argentina for the loss of just six games. 

Thailands Paradorn Srichaphan also cruised into the second round, coming from a set down to beat Victor Hanescu of Romania 4-6, 6-4, 6-1, 6-1. 

Max-Mahesh up 

Mahesh Bhupathi and Max Mirnyi, fourth seeds in mens doubles, came through a test by fire before booking a berth in the second round. The Indo-Belarussian pair, former champions here, outlasted Argentine duo Martin Garcia and Sebastian Prieto 4-6, 6-4, 7-6 (7-3). 

Leander Paes and David Rikl will kick off their campaign against Croats Mario Ancic and Ivan Ljubicic. Paes and Bhupathi, it may be recalled, had fallen to this Croat team in a marathon three-set bronze-medal match at the Athens Olympics.

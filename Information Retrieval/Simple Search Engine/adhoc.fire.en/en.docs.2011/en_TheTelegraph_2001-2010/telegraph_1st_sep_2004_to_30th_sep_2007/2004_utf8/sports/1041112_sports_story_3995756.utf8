 WI factions seek to resolve crisis

Port-Of-Spain: West Indies cricket officials will meet the players? association next week to discuss allegations that they had bypassed the group when inviting players to a training camp. 

The West Indies Players? Association (WIPA) instructed 25 players invited to the training camp not to sign their contracts. The three-week camp is scheduled to start from November 29. 

Association president Dinanath Ramnarine cited concerns over conditions stipulated by the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB), and claimed officials had not included them in the process. The board, however, agreed to find a solution to the conflict next Thursday, Ramnarine said. 

West Indian players are not paid retainership and make the bulk of their income from advertising. (AP)

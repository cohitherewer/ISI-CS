The Telegraph - Calcutta

 This England team is very much Vaughan?s: Michael Atherton

 - ?Should the rest follow what they (Australia) do? If you don?t learn from the best, you aren?t being very wise?? 

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI 

Bangalore: Michael Atherton?s last England appearance (115th in Tests) was over three years ago and, since retirement, he has been among the most sought after commentators. A former captain, the 36-year-old is in India for the first two Tests. A ?short break? and, then, he will be off to South Africa for England?s series there. Atherton, who accumulated 7,728 Test runs (16 centuries) besides close to 2,000 in 54 ODIs, spoke to The Telegraph on Thursday morning, before the second day?s play. 

The following are excerpts 

On England?s excellent run this year 

It has been driven by three factors: The emergence of Steve Harmison as a quality fast bowler, Andrew Flintoff?s coming of age as an allrounder and Michael Vaughan?s captaincy. Also, the central contracts system has helped and, remember, this isn?t an ageing England side. (After a pause) Of course, I accept some of the opposition wasn?t of the highest quality, but that doesn?t detract from the achievements. 

On Vaughan?s captaincy 

He has allowed the players to express themselves... He is himself quite calm and relaxed. Most important, though, he has the respect of teammates. I understand he?s very particular about fitness and that has made a difference. 

On the qualities a good captain must possess 

The ability to get the players to play for him... That?s definitely a starting point... Respect, therefore, is essential. The other things, like man management, follow. 

On the No. 1 contemporary captain 

(Smiles) I?m not picking and choosing... Let it be a personal thing. [Atherton himself led in 54 Tests and 43 ODIs.] 

On whether Nasser Hussain, who quit as captain in the summer of 2003, was too tough 

Look, different periods need different captains... Each individual leaves his own stamp on the dressing room... 

On Hussain?s contribution to the making of present-day England 

Has contributed, no doubt... However, this England team is very much Vaughan?s and it?s dangerous trying to look back... You could, then, even say the foundation was actually laid by Graham Gooch... 

On coach Duncan Fletcher?s role 

His appointment (in 1999) has turned out to be the catalyst... Like Vaughan, he is respected by the players... As a person and for his achievements. Given that he continues in the job, his contribution is bound to get bigger. 

On England?s chances in next summer?s Ashes 

I?m going to be better placed with an answer after we?ve finished our tour of South Africa (later in the season)... Hopefully, we will do well and take that confidence into the Ashes. 

On whether Flintoff, who is making such a difference, suffered early on by being labelled Ian Botham?s successor 

My opinion is that he wasn?t sure of the demands at the highest level... He began improving once that realisation came. Today, he?s much fitter as well. 

On England making the recent Champions Trophy final, their biggest one-day ?achievement? since the 1992 World Cup 

I?m not reading much into that... The format was funny in that each side just had one tough pool match... I wouldn?t go overboard... But, yes, England are getting better in the one-day game. 

On whether he expected the West Indies to take home the trophy 

Actually, that last hour was perhaps the finest 60 minutes of cricket ever seen by me... The tailenders? courage, the shots they (Courtney Browne and Ian Bradshaw) played... Their determination... It was terrific stuff. 

On Harmison making himself unavailable for the forthcoming tour of Zimbabwe on moral grounds 

I wouldn?t like to comment. 

On whether he would also have cited moral grounds and stayed away 

I don?t have to decide... I?m through with cricket... 

On the Australians constantly raising the bar 

I don?t know how long that?s going to continue... The Australians have obviously been blessed with great players and great teams... Moreover, each Australian takes great pride in his cricket... Should the rest follow what they do? Well, if you don?t learn from the best, then you aren?t being very wise... Having said that, one must not blindly copy... It?s important to appreciate what will work in your conditions and environment. 

On the Indian side 

Plays with passion and, generally, the team has done well under Sourav Ganguly... He has made them a competitive unit. 

On having torn into Sourav (in his weekly column) on the morning of last month?s Lord?s one-dayer 

(Laughs)... Did I? I may have been looking for a suitable start to that piece... Fact is I admire Sourav as a cricketer and have nice memories of playing with him at Lancashire (2000)... 

On how he expects this series to unfold 

I expected more runs on the first day... Let?s wait and watch... Good cricketers adapt and, so, whoever does that quicker is going to carry the advantage. 

Finally, whether his memorable face-off with Allan Donald in the 1998 Trent Bridge Test left him too drained mentally and physically 

It sure was hard the next morning... Yes, I was tired... After all, it had been an intense ?battle?... Donald could ease off after that spell, it was harder on me...

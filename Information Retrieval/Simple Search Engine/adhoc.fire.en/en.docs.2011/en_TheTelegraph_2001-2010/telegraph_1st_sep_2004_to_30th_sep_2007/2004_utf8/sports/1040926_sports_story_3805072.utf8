 Sachin will need at least 2 weeks, says Dr Joshi 

Mumbai: Sachin Tendulkar will need at least 

two weeks to regain full fitness, according to Dr Anant Joshi. 

?Optimistically speaking, he should be able to play 

cricket in two weeks? time. In a worst-case scenario, it may take even two months,? 

Dr Joshi said Saturday. 

Tendulkar, who has been sidelined with a tennis elbow, is in constant touch with Dr Joshi and Indian team physio Andrew Leipus who are monitoring his progress. 

Rest, ice/heat packs and gentle massage are the types of treatment that have been recommended to the champion batsman since he underwent electric shock therapy in England, Dr Joshi said, adding that rest is the best treatment for the malaise. 

Tendulkar is still very eager to play for Mumbai against Australia in the three-day tour-opener next week. 

?A slot has been kept open in case Tendulkar is able to play,? Mumbai Cricket Association joint secretary Ratnakar Shetty said.

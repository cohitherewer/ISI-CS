The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Poor bowling, fielding did us in

It was a difficult match to lose. I think Pakistan proved me right. They had beaten India three times before and they keep improving. I will say they planned it very well and we bowled and fielded very poorly. We squandered our chances. We won the toss, had all the advantages, went to a great total of 292 ? and it?s not a small total to chase ? but we made it easy for the visitors, bowling pretty badly on a wicket where the dew made a lot difference. 

We should have bowled right on the stumps, just short of length and should have got the batsmen to commit to every delivery. 

Then, instead of Harbhajan Singh, I would have thought Anil Kumble would have been a better choice. Considering the wicket and the dew, we needed Kumble who is faster and could have got tremendous purchase off a surface like this. You should believe in horses for courses: pick the right bowlers for the wicket. 

One needs to just look back at the first innings and see how Shahid Afridi got the ball to skid? 

And hats off to Salman Butt. Being so young, it was a wonder that he managed to keep such a cool head on his shoulders. His temperament is really superb. 

I had said in my column Saturday that Pakistan had the edge on paper. But when I looked at the Indian total I never really thought Pakistan would overhaul an asking rate as high as nearly six per over. A little more of planning and a little more thoughtful bowling and we just could not have lost this match so stupidly, if I may put it that way. 

The wicket was responding, there was the turn, but there was more in the wicket, more armoury that our bowlers could have drawn on. 

Sachin is getting back from a lay-off, and hope his return to form will be good for the Indians in the long run. India, as I said, warm up late, and I hope the South African series will be a real show of great Indian talent. 

I must also add that I see a Bob Woolmer touch in this victory. This is the same team, which once looked so vulnerable. Look at it now, brimming with confidence. Woolmer must be complimented on this turnaround. 

Frankly, it was a damn good toss to win for skipper Sourav. The wicket seemed to be getting slower and with the dew due, the snorters come in pretty dangerously. Also, Virender Sehwag was in a, should I say, passive mood, choosing his shots judiciously. And the Sourav-Yuvraj stand was so crucial and fine ? they rotated strike so well ? it could have dictated the course of the match if not for the poor bowling and fielding. The batting clicked, the other part of India?s cricket didn?t. Need for a thought to be spared before the next international exposure.

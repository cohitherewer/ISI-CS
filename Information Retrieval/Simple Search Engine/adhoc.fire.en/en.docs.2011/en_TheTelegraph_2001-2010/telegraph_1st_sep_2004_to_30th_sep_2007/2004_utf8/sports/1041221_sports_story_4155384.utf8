 Imran wants system revamp

 Imran Khan 

Karachi: Imran Khan on Monday blamed Pakistan?s humiliating 491-run loss in Perth to inept batsmen produced by a faulty system. 

?It?s deplorable to see Pakistan going down like that,? said Imran, Pakistan?s most successful captain. 

?Until and unless we correct our faulty system ? and that I have been saying for the last 25 years ? our batsmen will not be technically and temperamentally equipped to face a quality bowling side like Australia,? said the 52-year old, now a politician. 

Australia posted the fourth-best victory margin in Test history after Pakistan crumbled on the penultimate day for a paltry 72 in their second innings at the pacy WACA wicket on Sunday. 

Paceman Glenn McGrath recorded a career-best eight for 24, with only Yusuf Youhana (27) and Younis Khan (17) reaching double figures in a spineless batting display. 

?We will continue to blame coaches and captains for each defeat and sack them, but the real remedy is to develop batsmen technically by overhauling our faulty system,? said Imran, who played 82 Tests and 176 ODIs between 1971 and 1992. 

?Either correct it by improving the system or send the batsmen to play in County championship. 

?I think the coach can make a marginal difference and it?s the captain who makes the team fight. but how can he make a team fight whose base is weak?? 

Imran went on: ?Batting has always been Pakistan?s bane on tours of Australia. Our batsmen thrive against low quality bowling but when they come up against the world-class attack of Australia, they are exposed.?

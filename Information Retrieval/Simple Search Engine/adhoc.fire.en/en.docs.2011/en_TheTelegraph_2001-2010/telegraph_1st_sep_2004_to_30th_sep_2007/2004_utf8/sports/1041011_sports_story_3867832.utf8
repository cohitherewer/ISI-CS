Rio de Janeiro: Argentina and Brazil scored crushing victories in Saturday?s World Cup qualifiers, the former beating Uruguay 4-2 in Buenos Aires and the world champions romping home 5-2 in Venezuela in South American qualifying. 

Argentina, playing their first match under new coach Jose Pekerman, raced into a 4-0 lead after 54 minutes with a Luciano Figueroa double and a goal apiece from Luis Gonzalez and Javier Zanetti. 

Cristian Rodriguez and Javier Chevanton, from a twice-taken penalty, made the scoreline respectable for Uruguay. 

Two goals each from Kaka and Ronaldo and one by Adriano, seven minutes after coming off the substitutes? bench, put Brazil 5-0 ahead in Maracaibo. 

Ruberth Moran then pulled two back, doubling Venezuela?s tally of goals in their 16 meetings with Brazil, who have won them all. 

Venezuela could be in serious trouble after two fans went on to the field in the second half to hug Roberto Carlos and Ronaldo. 

In other games, Colombia wasted a hat-full of chances as they were held 1-1 by Paraguay in Barranquilla while Bolivia stayed bottom of the group table despite beating Peru 1-0 in a scrappy match in La Paz. As the South American World Cup qualifying section reaches the halfway mark, Brazil lead with 19 points from nine games with Argentina one point behind. Both look certain to qualify for Germany 2006. 

They are followed by Paraguay (15), Chile (12), Ecuador, Uruguay, Venezuela (10) and Colombia, Peru and Bolivia (9). Ecuador and Chile complete the weekend?s programme in Quito on Sunday. 

In European qualifying, Italy were beaten 0-1 by Slovenia and Euro 2004 runners-up Portugal held to a 2-2 draw by Liechtenstein on Saturday as several of Europe?s big names struggled. 

France and The Netherlands were held to draws by Ireland and Macedonia respectively while Greece drew 1-1 in Ukraine. 

Italy had looked odds-on to progress from a soft-looking group V, but are now locked in a tough battle with neighbours Slovenia, whose famous home win on Saturday took them top on seven points, one ahead of the Italians. 

Italy had the best of the game but the only goal came eight minutes from time when substitute defender Bostjan Cesar headed in from a free kick. 

It was Italy?s first defeat in a World Cup qualifier since May 1993 when they lost in Switzerland en route to qualifying and losing on penalties to Brazil in the final. 

Portugal looked on course for a third successive win when they led 2-0 at the break through Pauleta and an own-goal. But Liechtenstein levelled through Franz Burgmeier and Thomas Beck. The Netherlands twice led in Macedonia but were twice pegged back as Goran Pandev and Ace Stojkov earned the hosts a deserved point. 

World Cup hosts Germany remained unbeaten under new coach Jurgen Klinsmann with a 2-0 win over Iran. (Agencies)

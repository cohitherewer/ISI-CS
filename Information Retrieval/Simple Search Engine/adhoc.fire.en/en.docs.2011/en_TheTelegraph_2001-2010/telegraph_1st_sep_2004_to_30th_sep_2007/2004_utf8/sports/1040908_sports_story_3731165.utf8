London: Sundays win in the last NatWest Challenge match notwithstanding, the past few weeks have been quite tough on Team India. Understandably, it led to the dropping of shoulders both inside and beyond the dressing room. 

No one likes to be part of a losing side but, then, its important to always back yourself and never lose the biggest driving force self-belief, emphasised vice-captain Rahul Dravid during a chat with The Telegraph on Tuesday. 

Agreeing the team did get affected by the defeats in the Asia Cup final (at the Sri Lankans hands), in Holland (to Pakistan) and in the first two NatWest games against England, he added: Look, much as everybody wants to, you cant always be the winner... That has to be accepted... Whats needed, then, is to treat victory and defeat equally... 

Surely, thats easier spoken than done? 

Grinning, Dravid replied: Perhaps... I suppose experience does make a big difference... Moreover, when the chips are down, theres no point brooding over what has happened.... Youve got to regain composure and look ahead... A pro isnt expected to be down for the count after a couple of blows... 

Talking about the relevance of Sundays win England, after all, had already taken an unassailable 2-0 lead Dravid said: Depends... If we build on that and really do well in the Champions Trophy, its going to be a turning point... If we dont, then it will remain just another victory... So, lets wait. 

Speaking about his own form which, till Sundays 52 had dipped after the first two matches in the Asia Cup, Dravid explained he had probably been playing too many shots too soon. He continued: Even though I got a fifty, I accept it wasnt one of my better innings... However, seen in the context of the sides needs, I did pretty well. 

Dravid began the 2004-2005 season with 104 versus the UAE and got 82 in the very next game, against Sri Lanka. Since then, his scores in the lead-up to Sunday were: 5, 1, 16, 0, 13 and 1. Clearly, one expects him to build on that 52. 

The vice-captains views on playing a double role in ODIs are well known. For the record, though, he had this to say: The captain and coach are going to decide whether or not Ill keep... Obviously, the state of the wicket and the balance of the team is going to have a huge influence... 

Signing off, Dravid felt being positive and not allowing self-belief to take a hit, irrespective of what happens, will hold Team India in good stead over the next couple of weeks.

Calcutta: Sourav Ganguly was back home on Thursday after a series of lacklustre performances in the Holland tri-series, Natwest Challenge and ICC Champions Trophy. And the Team India captain made no excuses for the below-par showing. 

?We played bad cricket, that?s it? the whole team failed,? Sourav said at the said at the Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International airport. 

The captain said he would follow the ongoing Irani Trophy tie closely. ?I will follow the Irani Trophy and also observe the practice match (between India Seniors and India A before the Australia series)? If I find any youngster with the class to make it to the Test level, he will definitely be considered,? he said. 

The series against the world champions will be a big one, but Sourav refused to see it as anything special. ?All series are tough? I don?t feel any extra pressure facing the Aussies.? 

PTI adds from Mumbai: Earlier, speaking to newsmen on arrival in Mumbai on Wednesday night, Sourav said he has no plans to relieve Rahul Dravid of wicketkeeping duties in ODIs. ?I think Dravid is doing a splendid job (as ?keeper in ODIs) and I don?t see any reason for changing it,? Sourav said. 

He added that Yuvraj Singh and Akash Chopra deserve berths in the Test XIV as both have done well in Test matches. 

Asked about the finger injury which has ruled Aussie captain Ricky Ponting out for at least the first Test, Sourav said that any team which loses a captain is at a disadvantage. ?It?s always difficult when your captain is ruled out. But they are a good side and it?s going to be a good series.? 

Ganguly also said Harbhajan Singh and Anil Kumble would be bowling in tandem against Australia.

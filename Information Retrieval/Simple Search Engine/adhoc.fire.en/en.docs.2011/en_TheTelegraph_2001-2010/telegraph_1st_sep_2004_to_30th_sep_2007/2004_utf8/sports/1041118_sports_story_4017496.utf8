 Aragones digs deeper hole for himself

 - I am not a racist? You are like wolves after the deer, says Spain coach

Luis Aragones had managed to keep his temper on Tuesday through the questions about his infamous description of Thierry Henry as a ?black s**t?, but as the press conference drew to a close, the 66-year-old Spain coach could control his sense of decorum no longer. 

As officials from the Spanish football federation looked on helplessly, the veteran coach jabbed his finger in the chest of an English reporter who had been one of a group of us who had dared to confront him. The extraordinary rant that followed will do little to strengthen the hand of the Aragones apologists who say the coach has been shabbily treated in the aftermath of his racist outburst last month. 

?You are a kid, you don?t know anything and I am nearly 70,? he raged. 

?I have a lot of black friends who have explained to me that the English were after them in the colonies. I have fed black people at the table in my house. I am not a racist but you lot will write what you want. You are like wolves after the deer.? 

Spanish television crews who had ducked the opportunity to question Aragones on the subject of Henry swarmed around the English reporters to capture the moment. The coach was hustled out of a back door and a sense of embarrassment settled on some of his compatriots. ?I can?t believe the federation let him sound off like that,? one local reporter said. 

?It would never have happened to the Real Madrid coach.? 

Aragones should count himself lucky that he coaches football in a nation where the press confront controversy with all the aggression of a pack of deer suffering from low self-esteem. 

He did not elaborate on what he meant by the attitude of the English in ?the colonies?, but it was clear from his earlier answers that he considers the response in England to his slur on Henry as a gross overreaction. 

Aragones used the words during a training session in a bizarre forehead-to-forehead confrontation with Jose Antonio Reyes that was meant, he later explained, to motivate the Arsenal winger to believe he was better than his clubmate. But with the England team due to train in their ?Let?s Kick Racism out of Football? T-shirts, it is a matter that is starting to cause great embarrassment to the Spanish football federation. 

In a tetchy series of answers before he finally lost patience, Aragones insisted yesterday that his ?conscience is clear?. He even went as far as to turn the question back on an English reporter ? who replied that his conscience was clear too. ?I doubt it,? was the gruff return from the man who has had 13 coaching stints at seven Spanish clubs over a 30-year career. 

He said: ?Thierry Henry has spoken with Reyes in England and Henry knows that I respect him like any other black man, like Samuel Eto?o [of Barcelona] and Finidi George [formerly of Ipswich] and all my black friends. It?s history. I know who is a racist. I remember the colonies. 

?I have said sorry in public. The boy doesn?t want me to say sorry again. We have got friends in common. I don?t think it is necessary to talk about this any more.? 

There has been little public outcry against Aragones in a nation where racist chants are still common at football grounds ? witness the abuse handed down to Emile Heskey at Valencia?s Mestalla stadium two years ago. The fate of his fellow former Atletico Madrid coach, Ron Atkinson, sacked from ITV and universally condemned for his infamous racist remark last season, would be anathema to Aragones. 

The former midfielder, who never made the grade at Real Madrid but went on to play for 20 years at a series of less fashionable sides, is now considered the elder statesman of Spanish football. Under the notoriously fickle presidency of the Atletico Madrid?s late Jesus Gil, he survived longer than most and coached the side on four separate occasions. 

For the first time on Tuesday, however, he was confronted with the reality that his legacy beyond Spain might well be that ill-advised remark about Henry. It is understood that Arsenal have not been given any firm apology, public or private. Even Sven-Goran Eriksson seemed amazed at Aragones? behaviour. Asked about the severity of the words, the England coach was unusually clear in his answer. ?If I had said that,? he said, ?I wouldn?t even recognise myself.?

Milan: Two goals by Francesco Totti in AS Roma?s 5-1 crushing of Parma on Sunday made him the club?s all-time topscorer, while third-placed Udinese beat Lazio 3-0 to close the gap on leading pair Juventus and AC Milan. 

Juventus?s goalless draw at home to champions Milan on Saturday leaves them on 39 points with Milan four behind and Udinese now on 31. 

A first-half free-kick from Sinisa Mihajlovic gave fourth-placed Inter Milan a 1-0 home win over Brescia and only their fourth victory of the season . 

Totti?s strikes for Roma took him to 108 Serie A goals, two more than Roberto Pruzzo?s previous club record, on a day when he threatened to quit the club. 

Totti set up Antonio Cassano for Roma?s opening goal in the 10th minute and then made it 2-0 himself with the record-breaking goal. 

Parma pulled one back through former Roma defender Cesare Bovo before the break. But then Totti set up Cassano again to make it 3-1 five minutes into the second half. 

Vincenzo Montella made it 4-1 with a fine solo goal and then Totti completed the rout with a thundering drive from over 20 metres out. 

Parma had forward Andrea Pisanu sent off 15 minutes from the end of the game. 

Francesco Flachi scored twice for Sampdoria as they won 4-1 at Lecce, who had defender Souleymane Diamoutene sent off in the 37th minute. 

Fiorentina beat Chievo 2-0 with goals from Christian Rigano and Spanish striker Javier Portillo ? his first in the league since joining the Florence club on loan from Real Madrid. 

In Spain, Espanyol reclaimed second place in the Primera Liga with a 0-0 draw against bottom side Numancia on Sunday, while Sevilla defeated local rivals Betis 2-1. 

Atletico Madrid also kept their home record spotless with a 1-0 win over Deportivo Coruna. 

Espanyol have 30 points, nine behind leaders Barcelona, who drew 1-1 with Valencia on Saturday, while Real Madrid and Valencia have 29 and Sevilla on 28. 

Despite a disappointing start to the season, Deportivo have picked up points on their travels and threatened to earn at least one more in an intense game. 

But the Atletico attack, led by Fernando Torres, managed to penetrate the visitors? defence. 

Torres evaded two defenders before passing to Antonio Lopez who netted the ball in the 28th minute. 

Strugglers Real Mallorca were beaten 2-1 at home by Osasuna and are now just one point ahead of Numancia at the bottom of the table. 

Athletic Bilbao notched up their first away league victory of the season with a 2-0 win over Zaragoza. Santi Ezquerro scored both goals. 

In England, Sol Campbell scored a rare goal from 25-yards as Arsenal captured a 1-0 victory at Portsmouth to regain second place in the Premier League and cut Chelsea?s lead to five points (as reported in the Late City edition of these columns Monday). 

There were only 14 minutes left at Fratton Park Sunday when the Pompey midfield allowed the England stopper, who occasionally scores from close range at set pieces, to charge forward into the huge space outside the area. 

Campbell had plenty of time and room to drive a 25-yard shot that flew past surprised ?keeper Jamie Ashdown to give the England defender his first goal for 16 months. 

The victory means that Arsene Wenger?s men climbed above Everton and have 38 points from 18 games while Chelsea, who outplayed Norwich 4-0 Saturday, have 43. Everton are on 37.

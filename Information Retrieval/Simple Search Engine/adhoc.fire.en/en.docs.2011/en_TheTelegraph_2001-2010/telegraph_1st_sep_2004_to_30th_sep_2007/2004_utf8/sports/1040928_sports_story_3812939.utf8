 The unexpected ruled 

 STAR RACER

 Even stipendiary stewards may have been left pondering whether victories of the likes of Shimmering Rivers, Venuses and Shining Jewels last Wednesday were by fluke or by design. The intention is not to disgrace these winners but to trace why a huge amount of public money went down the drain on their respective stable-mates ? Amazing Blaze, The Flying Star and Annotate ? who started favourites in their respective events.

 An easy answer could be underfoot condition of the track, which may have taken the steam out of those expected to do well on the day. The track had been subjected to relentless rains for nearly a week.

 To start with Amazing Blaze, the Daniel David-trainee is no champion but his impressive ?barrier? and ?gate? trials had left no doubt in the mind of the early birds that Shimmering River could be any match for the Be Fresh-Happy Ending son. But those who went by their bloodlines and last winter?s performance had the last laugh in the 1,200m Ridicular Handicap for maiden horses. 

 Shimmering River, a full sister to the top class sprinter River Melody, exhibited her class, though victory-margin of a longneck may have disappointed her followers. The Sizzling Melody-River Chase daughter is, nevertheless, bound to improve upon this run and needs to be kept under the watch list. 

 Royal Prodigy is the other one who may benefit from this run. The well-bred Conquering Hero-Scossa son may do a Shimming River soon. 

 Venus has never been a genuine galloper. But the seven-horse field of the 1,200m Young Lady Handicap was packed with an undependable lot, and also had those in the line-up who had passed their prime or had reached their mark at the handicap. Yes, the same cannot be said about The Flying Star but the Javed Khan-ward is no champion either. He had finished almost level with Venus in their last clash over 1,100 metres. A strong finisher in Venus found the extra 100m to his advantage.

 Annotate?s run in the Stay In Shape Cup, may have been too bad to digest for those who judged it with naked eyes. But Shanker was seen making a tireless effort from the 800m marker with no encouraging response coming from the 5-4 favourite. Shining Jewel, on the other hand, was always in a close attendance of the leader Sergeant Slipper till he led from 600m, clearing relishing the underfoot conditions which Annotate vehemently detested. 

 The afternoon also witnessed a 7-2 second favourite Callisto winning a close contest from Way To the Starts and the public-choice Tagged For Terror. The three some came late into the picture with Common Spirit, Barrier Ridge and Lucifer dominating the major part of the journey in the Mica Empress Cup over 1,200 metres. In fact, it was anybody?s race 100m from home but Callisto just about managed to shoot into the lead 50m from the winning post.

 Angelica won the Maid Of Athens Handicap, thanks to favourite Royal Charmer?s burst blood vessels in the later half of the final stretch when the Daniel-trainee was in commanding lead. Autumn Fantasy, could have run Angelica close but he was brought into contention only after the Charmer was found to be in distress.

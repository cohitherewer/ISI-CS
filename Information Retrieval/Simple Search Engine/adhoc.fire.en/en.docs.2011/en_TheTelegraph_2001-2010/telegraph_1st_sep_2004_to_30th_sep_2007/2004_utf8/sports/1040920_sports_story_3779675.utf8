 Safin ends title-drought

Beijing: Russian Marat Safin ended a 22-month title drought with a 7-6, 7-5 victory over compatriot Mikhail Youzhny in the final of the China Open on Sunday. 

The former world number one, who did not drop a set in Beijing, needed all his experience to claim his first title since winning in Paris in November 2002. 

Fifth seed Safin recovered from an early break to win the first-set tiebreak 7-4 thanks to four thundering aces. 

The second set went with serve until Safin broke through in the 11th game, Youzhny?s nerve crumbling as he double-faulted on break point. 

Safin converted his first match point with another huge serve after one hour 37 minutes.

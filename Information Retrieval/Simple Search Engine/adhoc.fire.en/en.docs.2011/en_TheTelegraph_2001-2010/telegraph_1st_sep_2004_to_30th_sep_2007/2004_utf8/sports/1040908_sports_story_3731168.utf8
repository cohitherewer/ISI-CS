The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Balaji likely to undergo scan

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

London: Speedster Lakshmipathy Balaji, who 

has been complaining of pain in the abdomen, is likely to undergo a scan before 

the Indians leave for Southampton on Wednesday. Apparently, Virender Sehwag too 

may join Balaji only, if he does, the focus will be on his back. 

At this moment, we arent worried about Balaji... 

However, because he has been complaining of discomfort, its better to have a 

scan done before we leave London, a well-placed source told The Telegraph 

on Tuesday. 

Sachin Tendulkar, of course, is scheduled to undergo a scan on his left elbow later in the day. In fact, because of the inaugural ICC awards, that could be put off till the morning. 

Incidentally, Sachin was the biggest hit at the reception hosted for Sourav Ganguly and Co. by our high commissioner, Kamlesh Sharma, at India House on Monday evening. Such was the rush of invitees towards the maestro, throughout his 90-minute stay, that one feared for his troubled elbow. 

The guests who tucked into chicken tikka, spring rolls, seekh kababs and samosas from the world of cricket included Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Shaharyar Khan, Cricket Australia supremo Bob Merriman, Zimbabwe Cricket Union boss Peter Chingoka and former Board of Control for Cricket in India president Raj Singh Dungarpur.

Calcutta: Hanif Mohammed is on his fourth visit 

to the city. Having been part of the 1952-53 and 1960-61 teams, his last trip 

was during the Golden Jubilee celebrations of the Cricket Association of Bengal 

in 1980-81. 

The former Pakistan captain ? the first Asian to register a Test triple and record-holder for the highest first-class score, till Brian Lara overhauled him ? has once again been ?touched by the humility and affection? of the people here. However, he says, ?the city has changed a lot?. 

The living legend, who spoke to The Telegraph on Thursday evening, termed the Platinum Jubilee celebrations of the Board of Control for Cricket in India as ?historic?. 

The following are excerpts 

On the current Pakistan side 

India is a mature team. On paper, they are a better 

side when compared to Pakistan, who have several new players in their ranks. You 

need time to gain experience and get better. 

Wait a few years and see how this Pakistan side develops. 

They have failed to perform under pressure in the past, but that?s because of 

their inexperience. Once these boys mature Pakistan will be the best in the world. 

On the Indians? unimpressive showing of late 

One shouldn?t read too much into India?s defeat by 

Australia. Let?s accept it, Australia are No.1 in the world. India, however, came 

back strongly to win the final Test in Mumbai. Too much furore was created over 

the wicket, but every country prepares pitches to suit its needs. 

Moreover, Sachin (Tendulkar) didn?t play three Tests, while Sourav (Ganguly) missed two. Don?t forget they form the backbone of India?s batting. 

You?ve to view it from a long-term perspective, one 

or two matches lost doesn?t make much of a difference. You?ve to look at India?s 

record over the past one year to pass any judgement. 

On current form the three best batsmen in the 

world (in order of preference) 

LARA: He?s a genius. He had the world record 

to himself with that 375, but Matthew Hayden proved him wrong. He came back strongly 

to overhaul the Australian with a majestic 400 not out. You need guts and determination 

to regain a world record, and in doing so, has proven his worth. 

TENDULKAR: He is a born cricketer? has everything 

in his command. He?s so talented and it?s just too good to have him in the side. 

He knows what stroke to offer, when to play a particular shot and when not to 

offer a shot. His sense of timing and shot selection is just impeccable. 

INZAMAM: He has over 8,000 runs in Test cricket 

and has been a key man in Pakistan?s success. He is often under-rated. Has the 

ability of viewing the ball very early. He can make batting look so easy with 

his style and attitude. He has been in superb touch of late. 

On his all-time great cricketer 

Undoubtedly, Garfield Sobers. From what I?ve seen 

over the years, he is the best? a complete cricketer. He was a great batsman, 

a versatile bowler (who could bowl medium-pace, orthodox left-arm spin and chinaman), 

a superb close-in fielder and the best captain. No words of praise are enough 

to describe his ability. 

On any player who has impressed him in the sub-continent 

Sunil Gavaskar, the best opener in Asia. Technically 

he was very sound and knew what he was doing. His concentration and application 

was exemplary. 

An average captain, though. 

On having Bob Woolmer as coach 

Javed Miandad has played with some of these players 

and having the same person as coach is not always liked by the boys. 

Woolmer is very popular, experienced and the players 

listen to him. It also helps being a foreigner... the boys have no grudge against 

him. However, in the past, things were different.

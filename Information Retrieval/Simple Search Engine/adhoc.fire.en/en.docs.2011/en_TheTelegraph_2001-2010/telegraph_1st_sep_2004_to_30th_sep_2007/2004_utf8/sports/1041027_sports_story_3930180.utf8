The Telegraph - Calcutta

 7 players of colour likely 

Durban: Durban?s star of Indian origin Hashim Amla and six other players of colour are expected to be included in the 14-member squad to travel to India for the two-Test series early next month. 

United Cricket Board spokesperson Gerald de Kock said the team would be announced officially on Wednesday but there are indications that Amla is a certainty because of his outstanding performances with the bat over recent months. 

However, regular opening batsman Herschelle Gibbs has unofficially announced that he will not tour India as he had not been given any assurances that he will not be arrested or questioned by the Indian police over the match-fixing scandal. Nicky Boje, the other player under the match-fixing cloud, is also likely to pull out. 

Amla, captain of the Kwazulu-Natal provincial team, has scored four centuries, two against the New Zealand A team when they toured recently, and against provincial teams. 

Other players of colour expected to make it on merit besides regular fast bowler Makhaya Ntini, are wicketkeeper Thami Tsolikele, who is expected to replace Mark Boucher, and spinners Justin Ontong and Robin Peterson. Fast bowler Charl Langeveldt and Alfonso Thomas are also likely to be included in the squad. 

Others almost certain are skipper Graeme Smith, Shaun Pollock, Boeta Dippenaar, Jacques Kallies, Jacques Rudolph, Martin van Jaarsveld, Andrew Hall and Garnet Kruger. (PTI)

 Testing time for captaincy, feels Sourav

Nottingham: Sourav Ganguly on Wednesday termed the present phase as a testing time of his captaincy and said he would find out how good he is in the next few months. 

I will find out how good a captain I am in the next four-five months, said Sourav after his batsmen once again collapsed against a resurgent England side and lost the first game of the NatWest Challenge by seven wickets. 

Its easy to captain the side when everything goes well like last two years. It has been a little rough in the last four-five games. We have to get together as a side. We would find out how good we are (in coming months). 

Sourav said the poor performance of his side was not for want of effort but somehow things were not clicking. Its to get their mindset right. I know they are trying hard, I can see it in practice, in the gym, in training. Its just not going well. 

England captain Michael Vaughan said: We were quite comfortable with so many young players. It was a professional approach from the first ball. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Early exit for ailing Serena 

Vienna: Ailing Serena Williams suffered her earliest tournament defeat since April 2000 when she was beaten 7-6, 6-2 by Russian qualifier Alina Jidkova in the second round of the Linz Open on Wednesday. 

The former world No.1 seemed fine in the first set, which she lost 7-5 in the tiebreak, before calling the trainer when 2-1 and a break down in the second. 

Seeded three, the six-times Grand Slam winner complained of headaches and took tablets before deciding to soldier on. It is the first time in four and a half years that Williams has lost her opening match of a WTA tournament. 

The American received a bye in the first round when Jidkova beat compatriot and fellow qualifier Vera Douchevina 6-2, 6-1. 

?I?m really disappointed but I felt dizzy and had absolutely no energy,? said Williams, who thought a bad meal might have been to blame for her illness. ?I already had the symptoms yesterday during training - I feel so tired.? 

The defeat damages Williams?s chances of making the end-of-season WTA Tour Championships in Houston next month.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Utpal to play tie vs MP

 - ?Bengal cricket is in crisis... How can I stay away?? 

A STAFF REPORTER 

 Utpal Chatterjee 

Calcutta: If Bengal cricket is in dire straits, can its most successful bowler be savouring the moment? 

No way. Utpal Chatterjee has decided to come out of retirement following an SoS from the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) and will play against Madhya Pradesh in Bengal?s final Elite group A engagement, starting at the Eden from Friday. 

Utpal?s decision could not arrive at a better time than this when Rohan Gavaskar amp; Co., having tasted four consecutive defeats, are staring at relegation from the Ranji Trophy Elite zone. 

?Bengal cricket is in crisis and how can I stay away? I was in two minds when such a suggestion (of playing again for Bengal) was made to me. But eventually I thought I should help Bengal in whatever way I can,? Utpal told The Telegraph on Monday evening. 

?If Bengal demote, it?ll be a big blow to the youngsters. Because playing in the Plate zone will not at all help them in building a career. Even if Maco (Shib Shankar Paul) or Ranadeb (Bose) performs well, that will hardly be noticed in national perspective. If I can help Bengal tide over this crisis, I?ll be a happy man,? commented the former India left-arm spinner, who took three wickets in as many one-day Internationals. 

Utpal, who retired after representing East Zone against North in the Duleep Trophy ? held in March in Mohali ? with 499 wickets in his kitty in irst class cricket, ruled out any personal goal behind his comeback. 

?Had I eyed that mark (500 wickets) I would have continued. I am coming back purely on the basis of my love for the team,? he said, while checking the playing kits at a shop near his North Calcutta residence. 

Bengal, at least, need to bag a couple of points, let alone an outright win, from their match against Madhya Pradesh to stay in the Elite zone. 

Bengal coach Karsan Ghavri welcomed the news, saying the veteran spinner?s experience will come in handy against Madhya Pradesh. 

?This is crucial match for us and his experience will be a huge bonus. I didn?t know officially whether he?s playing but his return is certainly a very good news for Bengal cricket,? Ghavri said, when contacted later. 

?The youngsters in the team will have the last opportunity to learn something from him. If he and Sourav play together for Bengal, it?ll be a big boost for the team and we are hoping to finish off well,? he added. 

Like Utpal, a similar SoS has also been forwarded to Team India captain Sourav Ganguly for playing in the match. 

Utpal, however, differed with the idea of describing his return as a much-needed boost to the beleaguered team. 

?I would have been happier if my service was not required. I understand it?s difficult but the youngsters need to deliver. One shouldn?t fall back on Utpal, rather the next generation should come up and take more responsibility,? he felt. 

Utpal has already conveyed his decision to CAB?s Gautam Dasgupta on Sunday night. It was, In fact, Dasgupta who had initially approached the veteran spinner two days before Bengal?s Ranji game against Delhi started (on last Wednesday). Utpal sought time and finally made up his mind after Bengal?s defeat to Delhi. 

?Had Bengal won against Delhi, I wouldn?t perhaps decided to return. But make no mistake, it?s just for one match and I?m not sure whether I can help Bengal survive,? he maintained, expressing his desire he would like to be associated with the state in various other capacities. Earlier to this season, Utpal was invited to help the team as a spin-bowling coach.

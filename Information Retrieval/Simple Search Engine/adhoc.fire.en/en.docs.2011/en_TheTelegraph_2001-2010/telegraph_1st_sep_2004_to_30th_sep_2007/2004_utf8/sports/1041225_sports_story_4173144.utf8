 Star Angel set to lift Oaks 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Victory may be a mere formality for Star Angel in the 2,400m Usha Stud Calcutta Oaks, the third classic of the season which is the chief attraction in the Christmas day?s seven-event race card.

 The Placerville-Amazing Princess daughter had outclassed her rivals in the 1,000 Guineas over 1,600 metres. The morning trials of the Daniel David-ward suggest that the staying trip is well within her compass. C.Rajendra partners the three-year-old filly.

 Daniel?s Imperial Dynasty also seems to be at an advantage in the 1,100m Breeders? Cup for two-year-olds. The Ajaad-My Signorina son ran green in his debut start and yet finished ahead of Acrostic. The run benefit appears to have furnished the juvenile and with Rajendra in the saddle he may score.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

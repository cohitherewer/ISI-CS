 Couldn?t be happier, says McGrath

Melbourne: Glenn McGrath missed out on taking ten wickets in an innings after claiming eight for 24 in Australia?s 491-run win over Pakistan on the fourth day of the first Test in Perth on Sunday. 

McGrath picked up the first seven wickets in Pakistan?s woeful second-innings total of 72 before fellow-seamer Michael Kasprowicz captured the eighth and 10th wickets to record figures of two for four. 

?I had seven-for. I was looking up thinking this might be my best chance for a 10-for,? McGrath told a news conference. 

?But then Kasper came in and ruined it,? a grinning McGrath added. ?I couldn?t be happier at the moment.? 

McGrath, who took three for 52 in Australia?s World Cup final win over India last year, said he was aiming to play in the 2007 tournament. 

?The way I felt today, I?d definitely like to see myself there (in 2007). We?ll have to see what happens,? he said. 

McGrath missed a year of cricket with a long-term ankle injury, returning in the first Test against Sri Lanka in Darwin in July to claim match figures of seven for 61. 

?Towards the end, that?s as good as I?ve ever felt bowling,? McGrath said of his eight for 24. ?When I came back, after having so much time out of the game, I just felt fresh and ready to go,? he added. 

McGrath, Test cricket?s fourth leading wicket-taker with 472 victims in 104 matches, surpassed his previous best of eight for 38 against England at Lord?s in 1997. 

He said he ranked Sunday?s performance slightly above the England match, despite what he felt was a patchy start to his spell before taking the first wicket of the day when Salman Butt was caught in the gully for nine. 

?It wasn?t until Matty (Hayden) took that catch and then things started to turn around,? McGrath said. 

The Australian said he now had his sights set on claiming 500 Test wickets. ?At the moment 500 Test wickets is a pretty big goal of mine. For any bowler to achieve that is a pretty fair effort,? McGrath said. ?That?s the one I?m aiming for at the moment.? 

Meanwhile, Australia captain Ricky Ponting said he was concerned about the competitiveness of the Pakistan after his side?s massive win. 

?Yeah, I think it is a bit of a worry, a bit of a concern,? Ponting told a news conference. The last time we did play them (in October 2002) we did win quite convincingly as well (by 41 runs, an innings and 198 runs and an innings and 20 runs).? 

Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer, who was appointed in June to replace Javed Miandad, said it was an ?abject? batting display. 

?There?s an element of mental confusion or mental awe in the performance,? Woolmer said. ?We have got some very good players. But at the moment they?re being found out by some very good bowlers and we?ve got to do something about it if we?re going to be competitive. 

?Let?s keep calm. We?ve had a really bad game. It wasn?t unexpected in many quarters. We need to fight and get it back. We?re going to do that.?

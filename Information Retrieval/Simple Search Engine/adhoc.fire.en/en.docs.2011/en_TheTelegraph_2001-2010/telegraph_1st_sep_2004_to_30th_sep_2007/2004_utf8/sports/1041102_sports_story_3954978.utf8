 Pak drop Yasir Hameed

 Shoaib, who was out with a shoulder injury, has been declared fit 

Karachi: Pace bowlers Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Sami have been included in a 15-member Pakistan squad for the one-off limited overs international against India on November 13. 

Chief selector Wasim Bari said on Monday that both bowlers, who missed the second Test win over Sri Lanka due to injuries, have been declared fit. 

Sami was out with a groin injury while Shoaib withdrew with a shoulder problem. 

Pakistan will play the one-day International at the Eden Gardens to celebrate Board of Control for Cricket in India?s (BCCI) platinum jubilee. They will arrive on the night of November 10 and leave on November 14 morning. 

?Shoaib and Sami are our main strike bowlers and they are okay now and have been declared fit. We are taking this match seriously,? Bari said, adding, ?We want to field our best attack.? 

The selectors have dropped batsman Yasir Hameed after a string of poor scores and included uncapped batsman Aamer Bashir who has scored four hundreds in domestic season. 

Yasir has been dropped for the first time since making his debut in August last year against Bangladesh. He has played 44 consecutive ODIs and 12 Tests. 

Pakistan will be touring India for the first time since early 1999 when they played three Tests and a triangular one-day series.

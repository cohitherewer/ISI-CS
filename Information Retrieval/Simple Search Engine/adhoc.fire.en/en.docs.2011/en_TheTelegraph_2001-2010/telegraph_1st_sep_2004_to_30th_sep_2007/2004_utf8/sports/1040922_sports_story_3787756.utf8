The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Ricky Ponting ducks a sudden bouncer

 - Gilchrist boost for Aussie captain 

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI 

 Ricky Ponting, the right choice 

Birmingham: In the lead-up to Tuesday?s Champions 

Trophy semi-final here, Ricky Ponting found time for an unusual interaction (for 

which The Telegraph too was present) ? chatting with youngsters playing 

for Wales? Panteg Cricket Club and some of their parents. 

The questions were largely ?friendly? till a parent 

hurled a bouncer: ?Why did the selectors choose you to succeed Steve Waugh and 

not anybody else?? 

A trifle taken aback, Ponting managed a smile and replied: ?Haven?t thought about it? Nor, for that matter, have I ever asked the selectors? Bottomline, though, is that I?m enjoying the captaincy?? 

There was definitely a bit of awkwardness, but that quickly ended when vice-captain Adam Gilchrist, who had quietly taken a back seat, chose to say a few words. 

?If it?s okay? Yes, it?s true there were other contenders, but the selectors made the right choice? Ricky is his own captain and what stands out is that he remains a good mate despite being the boss? He has our respect?? Gilchrist chipped in. 

Touched, Ponting promptly thanked ?Gilly?. 

Gilchrist, it may be recalled, got bypassed when the selectors removed Steve from the one-day captaincy (and side) after the 2001-2002 tri-series at home. The job, of course, went to Ponting, putting him in line to take over the Test captaincy when Steve retired. 

That happened earlier this year. 

Incidentally, Ponting has three of his four Tests (with one drawn) and (till the semis at Edgbaston) led Australia to wins in 61 of the 76 ODIs he has been captain. 

While on captaincy, it?s not insignificant that the 

ICC?s selectors ? with the venerable Richie Benaud in the chair ? picked Ponting 

to lead both the official Test and one-day teams announced earlier this month.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Only talent should merit selection: Ntini

 - South African pacer feels Indian tour is a ?learning curve? 

A STAFF REPORTER 

 Ntini finds pleasure in leading

the attack

Calcutta: Basil D?Oliviera could never fulfil his wish of representing the country of his birth under the apartheid rule. And when he ultimately made it to the English team, South Africa forbid the series leading to their international isolation. 

Life has seen a sea-change in South African cricket since that episode way back in late 60s. Today, the world, in which the Makhaya Ntinis live and flourish is not only different but quite distinct with a quota system in place. 

Leading the way for South Africa?s black players, Ntini, however, believes no one should be picked on the basis of colour. Instead, he highlights merit as the determining factor in selecting a cricketer. 

?I feel anyone who deserves to play should be in the team. One must not be picked on the basis of colour. Personally speaking, I don?t want to be selected just because I?m black. I?m here because I deserve it, because I?m ready to give 120 per cent on the field,? the 26-year-old quick maintained, while talking to reporters here on Friday. 

Then, does he see himself as an inspiration for the upcoming coloured players back home? Ntini quickly eliminated any idea of beating the drum for himself. ?I?m not going to tell people about me. Those interested should come and ask me (for my advice).? 

He was forthright on sledging too. ?I didn?t ever sledge, neither do I care a bit (about facing the same),? he pointed out. 

Leading the South African attack is a ?pleasure?, not ?pressure? for Ntini. But India, though, remains a great learning curve for him. 

?In India, you?ve got to be on the right track when you bowl. Wickets are pretty much barren and so it doesn?t always suit your style. You?ve to do a lot of research and come prepared. Honestly, India is a learning curve for me. 

?In Kanpur, we bowled to a plan and managed to get reverse swing. But there?s very little margin of error here. You can?t bowl back of the length. You?ve to hit the areas more often than not. Bowling in the sub-continent is really tough,? Ntini said at the team hotel. 

 Shaun Pollock at the Eden on Friday

He, however, admitted tips from the likes of Allan Donald, Shaun Pollock and Jacques Kallis, who had toured India earlier, had helped him immensely before facing Team India. 

He dubbed bowling partner Pollock as his ?closest rival? and revealed that they worked in tandem while such ?healthy rivalry?. 

Ntini also felt that having two captains ? Pollock and his successor Graeme Smith ? in the side was not detrimental to the team?s growing phase. ?They have different knowledge and combine them well on the field,? was his view. 

Unlike Australia?s Glenn McGrath, Ntini doesn?t set his target on any particular batsman during a series. Neither does he have any goal at the end of his career. 

Ntini termed his association with the game as ?a blessing in disguise?. But since making debut in 1997-98, it has not always been rosy for Ntini. 

A rape allegation threatened to ruin his career five years ago. When reminded of that incident, the free-flowing exuberance vanished and a sense of resolve took its place on his face. 

?I prayed a lot and believed in the man upstairs. 

That incident has made me stronger. I have learnt that I need to be more careful, 

that I shouldn?t trust anybody and keep my eyes open to everybody and everything,? 

Ntini said.

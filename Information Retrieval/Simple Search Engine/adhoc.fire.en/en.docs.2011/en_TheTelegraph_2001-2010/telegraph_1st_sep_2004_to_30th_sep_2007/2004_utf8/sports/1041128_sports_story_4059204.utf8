The Telegraph - Calcutta

We need to build on Pak Test performance

Stickwork

Gurbax Singh

This Champions Trophy will be an opportunity for the 

Indian team to further build on the so-called ?decent? performance against Pakistan 

in recent two-leg Test series.

Most of the players are being retained from the Pakistan 

series for the Lahore meet (December 4 to 12). However, it is sad that we are 

not able to accommodate Deepak Thakur, because he seems to have failed to recover 

from his ?breathlessness?. Also sad is the possible exclusion of Gagan Ajit Singh, 

because chief coach Gerhard Rach believes that Gagan has an ?attitude problem?.

The domestic hockey season is in full swing, as most 

of the prominent tournaments are played between October and April. Most of the 

top players will be playing in these tournaments and will be ready for the Champions 

Trophy as well as the ensuing Premier Hockey League.

Most of the teams in this Champions Trophy will be 

experimental sides, because the World Cup (2006) and Chennai Champions Trophy 

next year will be their targets. India do not really have an ?experimental? side, 

but the current squad is young and in any case this is the best side we have, 

with most of the older players out anyway.

Hence there is a case of India having to build on 

this platform. It might well turn out to be a blessing in disguise.

Thereafter, we will be moving to the Premier League. 

This Premier League is something revolutionary in the world of hockey. I see images 

of what Kerry Packer did to cricket. It may one day change the face of hockey 

and bring in more television and public interest and more sponsors. It will put 

the sport in perspective and draw it to the public focus. The event has all the 

ingredients necessary to revive hockey and take it to the topmost levels in international 

sport.

The changes being made are innovative and more on 

the lines of basketball with four quarters and time-out allowed of two 60-second 

batches for each team per match.

 Gagan Ajit stayed out with an attitude problem

The break-up is like this: Regular timeouts are 2x120 

per team, totalling 240 seconds. There will also be four 60-second timeouts per 

(by request of chief coach) match per team, which totals to another 240 seconds. 

That is 480 seconds per team, therefore 960 seconds, or 16 minutes, per match 

(for both teams combined). 

One might say it is just an addition to the playing 

time. It is an addition to the time, sure, but it will mostly be rest. Hence good 

for the players. The standard rest period will be between the first and second 

quarters and between the third and fourth quarters, of 150 seconds each, equalling 

5 minutes. There will be no rest period between the second and third quarters, 

just changeover.

The match itself will be of 70 minutes. Hence we get 

91 minutes of television time, with stoppages this could go upto 100 minutes. 

The game will benefit, because most of the top players will be there, not only 

from India but also from foreign countries. 

It does sound a bit odd that for the first tournament 

the IHF itself is forming the five different teams and the captains have already 

been selected. From the pool of international players (Indian and foreign) the 

IHF will be taking out names in lots and distributing to the different top tier 

teams. This has been done to provide a semblance of balance between the teams 

and better competition.

There could be teething problems in this, mostly in 

the case of a player?s commitment to the team he is placed. Also, the fan support 

could be erratic. It?s like (for example) putting Gagan Ajit in the Bengal team. 

He may be a star, but he isn?t going to jell. I believe, though, that the problems 

will sort themselves out in the first year of the meet.

Also, I am sure with this level of hockey we will 

find more experience for managers, plenty of coaches and assistant coaches and 

medical people? ten coaches, ten manages, ten assistant coaches, all professionally 

looking after these teams at such a high level of hockey. This has to yield a 

new set of results.

Maybe many would feel this is ?masala? hockey, but, 

I feel ultimately this will hit big time. If, say, there are 12 teams in a league 

and there is relegation and promotion, maybe it will be like the National Football 

League. Packer?s one-day cricket isn?t ?masala? any more.

There will be a lot of exposure for talented players. 

And this will also be a departure from the usual format of the national hockey 

championship, which had become too unwieldy and unmanageable with 44-odd teams 

and no state association willing to host it. A proper systematic national meet 

is the only way to unearth regular fresh talent. 

Bengal Tigers is in the second tier of the championship. 

This will not only comprise players from Bengal, but also from Orissa, Bihar and 

Jharkhand, plus maybe some other leftover players from other states.

The selection will be done in Delhi. Each state will 

send in the names of their best players and the overall selection will be done 

with IHF supervision. This is only for the first year of the meet. Later there 

will be individual responsibility. It is true that much of the ?competition? is 

being created for the benefit of television. But look at it this way, Indian cricket 

benefited more from television. Indian hockey will, too.

The seed for a new tree has been sown, let?s see how 

the fruit looks and tastes.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Tyson in hot water again

Scottsdale; Former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson was arrested after allegedly jumping on the hood of a car outside a nightclub. 

Scottsdale police said Tyson was arrested on suspicion of misdemeanor criminal damage and was given a citation on Tuesday. 

He will probably have a court appearance within the next two weeks. 

According to police, Asaf Alikadic told them that he stopped his car to allow Tyson to cross the street outside a nightclub in the early morning hours of November 27. 

Tyson then began screaming at the driver before jumping on the hood of the car and denting it. 

Earlier this week, it was reported that Tyson has begun training in an attempt to make yet another return to the ring. He hasn?t fought since being knocked out by Danny Williams in July. 

Tyson suffered torn cartilage in his knee that night and underwent surgery to repair the damage. 

He has a career record of 50-5 with 44 knockouts.

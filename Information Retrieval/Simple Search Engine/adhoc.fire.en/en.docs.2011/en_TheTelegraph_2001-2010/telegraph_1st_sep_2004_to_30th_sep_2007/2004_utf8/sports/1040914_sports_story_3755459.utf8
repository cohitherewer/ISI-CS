 London: Manchester United defender Gary Neville is likely to miss England?s World Cup qualifiers against Wales and Azerbaijan next month after being sidelined for up to four weeks with a knee fracture. Neville suffered the injury during England?s 2-1 World Cup qualifier win over Poland last Wednesday.

 ?Gary Neville has a hairline fracture in his left knee cap. We expect him to be out for between three and four weeks,? the club?s website reported on Monday. England, who are second in group VI, level on four points with leaders Austria, are at home to Wales on October 9 and then play Azerbaijan in Baku four days later.

 London: The yellow card Didier Drogba received for diving during Chelsea?s Premier League match at Aston Villa has been rescinded by referee Rob Styles, the Football Association said on Monday. Styles sparked controversy on Saturday when he booked the Ivory Coast striker in the 80th minute for diving following what looked like a trip by Villa defender Ulises De La Cruz in the penalty area. The match ended goalless.

 ?The referee states that after reviewing the incident on video, he is satisfied that there was no attempt by the player to deceive him,? the FA said on its website. ?The booking will not be recorded on Drogba?s disciplinary record.?

 London: Fifa has reached an agreement with the IOC to have a 12-team women?s soccer competition in Beijing 2008 instead of the ?nonsense? of the lopsided 10-nation format in Athens, president Sepp Blatter said on Sunday. The schedule at last month?s games was criticised by both Fifa and the teams because there was one group of four teams and two of the three. It meant some nations played three group games in six days and the others just two with a long break in between. 

 London: Double Olympic champion Kelly Holmes accepts she will never be able to repeat her Athens performance but has ruled out retiring.

 The 34-year-old Holmes was beaten by Olympic 1500m silver medallist Tatyana Tomashova of Russia in Berlin on Sunday. But Holmes ? who won both the 800m and 1500m in Athens last month ? insists she is enjoying running too much to hang up her spikes.

 ?I can?t ever replicate what I did at the Olympic Games,? she admitted. ?But for now I really enjoy what I?m doing and the plan is to carry on into next season.?

 Holmes said her new-found fame was changing her life.

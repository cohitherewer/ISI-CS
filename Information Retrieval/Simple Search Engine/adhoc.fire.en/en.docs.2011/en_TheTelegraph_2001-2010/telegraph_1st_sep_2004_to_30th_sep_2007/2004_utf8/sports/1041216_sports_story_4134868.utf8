The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Bhaichung to resume ?ball-training? tomorrow

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bhaichung moving towards hundred per cent fitness 

Calcutta: India?s soccer captain Bhaichung Bhutia, who has been off practice for over a fortnight, will start ?ball-training? from Friday morning. 

Bhaichung did make brief appearances (for East Bengal) in the recent Federation Cup but, as he told The Telegraph on Wednesday afternoon, he wasn?t ?hundred per cent fit.? 

The captain has been having ?problems? after surgery on the left knee. His improvement, though, has been steady after he began physiotherapy at Jibak Mukherjee?s clinic. 

?Today, I did a bit of stretching and, tomorrow, I?m going to do some weights? Practice proper will be from Friday,? Bhaichung informed. 

Laughing, he added: ?So far, I?ve just been busy shopping and making daily visits to the physio?? 

The shopping, of course, is for Bhaichung?s marriage ? in the traditional Sikkimese way, with monks and all, at his village ? to sweetheart Madhuri on December 30. 

Bhaichung is going to be back in the city by January 3 / 4, ahead of East Bengal?s NFL engagements.

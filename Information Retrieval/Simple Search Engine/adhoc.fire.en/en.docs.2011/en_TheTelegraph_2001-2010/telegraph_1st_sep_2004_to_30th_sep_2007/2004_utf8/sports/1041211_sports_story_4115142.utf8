The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Kunte beats Barua, lead unchanged

 Surya continues to share the lead with Sandipan 

Visakhapatnam: Following a seven-draw start, GM Abhijit Kunte of PSPB recorded his second straight victory, accounting for GM Dibyendu Barua in the ninth round of the national A chess championship here Friday. 

The lead positions remained unchanged, with overnight leaders, Grandmasters Surya Shekhar Ganguly and Sandipan Chanda, agreeing to draws. 

Sandipan quickly signed the peace with LIC?s IM Sriram Jha, while Surya made his Calcutta city-mate Suvrajit Saha fight the distance to earn the half-point. 

The two took their tallies to 6.5 points, both remaining half-a-point ahead of teammate Neelotpal Das. 

Kunte joined IM S. Kidambi at fourth spot on 5.5 points. Ten more rounds remain in this 19-player all-play-all event. 

Barua who went all out against Kunte. Up against the Sicilian Scheveningen, Barua sacrificed an exchange to complicate matters in the queen-less middle game but as it progressed to the end game his initiative evaporated in thin air. 

Though Barua did well to get a kind of fortress in the final stages of the game, his clock deserted him in the end as Kunte won in 60 moves.

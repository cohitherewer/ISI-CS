Real face Juventus

 Mourinho gets his wish 

London: Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho got the draw he desired when the English league leaders were paired with Ronaldinho?s Barcelona in the first knockout round of the Champions League on Friday. 

In another high-profile tie nine-time champions Real Madrid were drawn against their old rivals Juventus, coached by former Real manager Fabio Capello. 

The clubs have met 10 times since 1962 with Real winning six times and Juventus four, including their semi-final victory over Real in May 2003 when they came back from a 1-2 defeat in the first leg to triumph 3-1 in the return. 

Manchester United will face AC Milan, the only major European side United have not met during manager Alex Ferguson?s 18-year reign at Old Trafford. Ferguson predicted before the draw that fate would mean the two clubs were drawn together.

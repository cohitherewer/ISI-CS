 Sea Legend set to strike 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Watch out for trainers Errol Bhungard and Bharath Singh in Wednesdays well-represented six-event card. Errols Ballet Master, El Cid and Sea Legend may call the shots in their respective events, while Bharath has promising winners in Annotate and Alessio.

 Further, Sea Legend has a point to prove that his victory over Tasmac was no fluke. Tasmac, in his subsequent two starts, went on to canter home against a higher class company. To be ridden by Imran Chisty, Sea Legend may, however, find a match in Arikara who has been doing exceptionally well in her morning tryouts. But the Vijay Singh-trainee may be found wanting in view of her lay-off since the winter season.

 Errols El Cid is the other one who may take some beating in the 1,400m Anticipator Cup. The last run of the eight-year-old horse was very impressive.

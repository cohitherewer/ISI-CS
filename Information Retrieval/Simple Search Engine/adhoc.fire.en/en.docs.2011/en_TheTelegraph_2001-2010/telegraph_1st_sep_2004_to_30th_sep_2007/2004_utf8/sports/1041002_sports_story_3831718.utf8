 It?s not for the money: Bernie

 SALLY POOK 

 Bernie organised the race business 

Bernie Ecclestone once said money did not make him happy. So it must have been a particularly miserable moment when the man who has been the dominant force behind Formula One motor racing for 30 years learned he was the third-richest person in Britain. Ecclestone has a reputed ? 2.4 billion fortune, amassed by almost single-handedly transforming an amateur sport of the Fifties into a glamorous, global industry. 

[Former race champion Jackie Stewart said Thursday that the British Grand Prix was set to be axed for the first time in Formula One history ? as reported briefly in Friday?s Late City edition ? and Ecclestone was quoted in the media Friday as saying he decided to drop the GP from next year?s calendar after the owners of the Silverstone circuit forced his hand with a ?take it or leave it offer?. 

[According to British newspaper reports Friday, Ecclestone ended 54 years of Formula One racing in Britain after a letter from the British Racing Drivers? Club (BRDC) had issued him an ultimatum. ?They came to me with a letter which more or less said ?take it or leave it?. The obvious thing they should know is that when they say that to me, that is an opportunity to leave it,? Ecclestone was quoted as saying in the Daily Express.] 

Married to a former Armani model 28 years his junior, he has all the trappings of wealth. It was his money, or more specifically a donation of ? 1 million to the Labour party in 1997, which brought Ecclestone to a wider public. When it was discovered that the Prime Minister had supported the exemption of Formula One from a ban on tobacco advertising, the government was forced to return the money. 

Now 73, he shows few signs of wanting to retire. ?I don?t do it to make money,? he said in a recent interview.

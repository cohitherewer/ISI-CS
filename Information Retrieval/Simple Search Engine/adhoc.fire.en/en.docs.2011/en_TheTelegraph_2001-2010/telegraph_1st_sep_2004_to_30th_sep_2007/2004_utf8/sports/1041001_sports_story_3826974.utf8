 Pakistan thrash Zimbabwe

Multan: Pakistan, led by an Abdul Razzaq century, coasted to a 144-run victory over Zimbabwe in the first match of a triangular one-day series on Thursday. 

The inexperienced Zimbabwe side were bowled out for 148 in 38.3 overs, Vusi Sibanda top scoring with 57, and never looked capable of reaching Pakistan?s daunting 292 for seven. 

It was Zimbabwe?s 11th straight one-day loss after 15 rebel white players refused to play for their country in an ongoing row over alleged racism in Zimbabwe cricket. 

Pakistan were in trouble early, losing three wickets for six runs then lurching to 36 for four with Tinashe Panyangara and Douglas Hondo doing the early damage, while the slower bowlers restricted Pakistan to 146 for six in the 40th over. 

However, captain Inzamam-ul-Haq (73), Razzaq (107) and Shahid Afridi (58) exploded with 145 runs in the final 10 overs, a partnership record against Zimbabwe. 

Razzaq and Afridi added 107 for the seventh wicket from just 46 balls, with Razzaq completing his second hundred in his 171st ODI and finishing unbeaten on 107.

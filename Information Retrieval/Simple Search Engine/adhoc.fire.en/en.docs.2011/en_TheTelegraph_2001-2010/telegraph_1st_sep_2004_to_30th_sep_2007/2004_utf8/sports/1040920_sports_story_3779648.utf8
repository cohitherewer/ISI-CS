 Consolation win for Ana Guevara 

Monaco: Mexico?s world champion Ana Guevara gained some consolation for the disappointments of her Olympic year on Sunday by winning the women?s 400m on the second and final day of the world athletics final. 

Guevara, unbeaten in 23 successive finals after finishing third at the 2001 Edmonton world championships, was clear favourite at the start of this year to win gold in Athens. 

But after a delayed start to her season because of an injury to her left Achilles, Guevara has been beaten consistently by Tonique Williams-Darling of the Bahamas, including in the Olympic final. 

On Sunday Williams-Darling, who shared the million dollar Golden League jackpot with Sweden?s Olympic men?s triple jump champion Christian Olsson this year, tied up badly after setting the early pace. 

Guevara responded by running down American Monique Hennagan in the straight to win in 50.13 seconds with Williams-Darling fading to sixth. The race was to feature each of the Athens medallists but Romania?s bronze medallist Ionela Tirlea-Manolache pulled out before the start. (Reuters)

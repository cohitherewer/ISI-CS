 - INDIA SENIOR VS INDIA A

- Zaheer stakes claim for Test recall 

 S. Sriram on way to his unbeaten century at the Chinnaswamy Stadium on Tuesday 

Bangalore: Left-arm pacer Zaheer Khan staked his claim for a Test recall with a three-wicket haul for India Senior against India A on the opening day of their four-day practice match on Tuesday. 

However, the day belonged to Sridharan Sriram, who cracked an unbeaten 110 as India A, led by Dinesh Mongia, ended the first day on a respectable 282 for seven in 90 overs at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium. 

Zaheer, who bowled well at the recent Irani Trophy, continued his good work, dismissing opener Dheeraj Jadhav (8), and then sent back Venugopal Rao (36) and wicketkeeper-batsman Mahendra Singh Dhoni (0) off successive balls to finish with figures of three for 38. 

Irfan Pathan picked up two wickets ? Gautham Gambhir (45) and Mohammed Kaif (31) ? in the first over after lunch, while Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh took one wicket apiece. 

Electing to bat, India A were in a spot at 106 for four before Sriram, batting with confidence, pulled his side out of trouble. Sriram, who had a good outing in the Irani Trophy as well, put on 91 runs for the fifth wicket with Rao and 58 for the seventh with Murali Kartik (20). 

The Tamil Nadu batsman?s unbeaten knock came in 165 balls with 11 fours. At close, Ashish Nehra was giving him company on three. 

Though Zaheer was impressive, Pathan, on the other hand, failed to get his rhythm at times and ended the day with two wickets for 61 runs in 18 overs. 

The warm-up game is specifically meant for top cricketers to get back into the right frame of mind for the crucial four-Test series against Australia, after a below-par performance in the recent one-day tournaments. 

Sourav Ganguly also chose to have some bowling practice, sending four overs down the middle where the Test would also be played. 

Spinners Kumble and Harbhajan, however, did not have a great outing with one for 77 and one for 74 in 25 and 22 overs respectively. 

Wicketkeeper Parthiv Patel too did not have a good day either as he dropped Kaif off Pathan when the former was yet to open his account. 

?It is one of my better innings,? said Sriram, who completed his century with a boundary off Kumble. 

?My job is to score runs. I don?t worry about selection. I leave it to the selectors,? added the batsman, a consistent performer in the domestic scene.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 India up at third spot

London: India jumped to their best-ever third position in the latest ICC Test Ratings, after achieving a 1-0 series win against South Africa. 

India bagged 107 points to move up to third place, their best since the introduction of the ratings system, behind Australia (130) and England (109). 

India, who won the second Test by eight wickets in Calcutta after drawing the first one in Kanpur, will get another chance to improve their rating further when they take on Bangladesh in a two-Test away series beginning next week. 

Australia, who swept their home series against New Zealand, maintained their top spot for the second consecutive year. 

Pakistan were placed fourth with 105 points ahead of Sri Lanka (103) while South Africa and New Zealand slipped to sixth and seventh place, respectively.

 Pak to cash in on Murali absence

 Inzamam says he will go in with different approach 

Faisalabad: Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq believes the absence of Muttiah Muralidharan gives his country a great chance of winning a home series against Sri Lanka for the first time in nine years. 

?He is a great spinner and he has played a big part in their successful Test record in Pakistan. I think they will feel his absence on our pitches,? Inzamam said on Monday, looking ahead to Wednesday?s first Test. 

Pakistan have lost five of their last seven home Tests to Sri Lanka, with Muralidharan, recovering from a shoulder injury, the scourge with 49 wickets. ?You can?t find a replacement for a bowler of his calibre in Tests and we must exploit this situation,? Inzamam said. 

Muralidharan?s bowling was a key factor in series wins in 1995-96 and 1999-2000 and in Sri Lanka winning the Asian Test championship final in March 2002. Sri Lanka captain Maravan Atapattu said it was a chance to show they can win without Muralidharan. 

?We have a point to prove that we are a good team even outside Sri Lanka. That is a challenge we are looking forward to and hopefully we will do that,? he said. 

?Obviously Murali?s absence is a big setback. But we won a Test at home against South Africa without him and it is our responsibility to continue to play well in this series also,? Atapattu said. 

For Pakistan, it will be their first Test series under English coach Bob Woolmer, who joined them in June and has led them to 11 wins in 16 one day Internationals.

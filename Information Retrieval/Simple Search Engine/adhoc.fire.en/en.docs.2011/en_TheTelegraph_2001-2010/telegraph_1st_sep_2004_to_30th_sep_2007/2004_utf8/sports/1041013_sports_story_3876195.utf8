 Balaji hopes to return in 2 months

 Balaji says things are moving in the right direction 

Chennai: Medium pacer Lakshmipathy Balaji feels that he would be able to get back to opening the new ball attack for India sometime in the next two months. 

?I am now under treatment and on complete diet food. There has been improvement, but I should be back for competitive games in about one and half or two months time,? Balaji, who is undergoing treatment for bone inflammation, said. 

?Things are moving in the right direction,? he said after unveiling the TVS Cup before the start of the second Test between India and Australia on Thursday. 

Balaji also said he was consulting three specialists, including Dr Kannan Puganzhendi, the official sports doctor of the Indian team which toured the West Indies in 1986. 

?All of them feel I should be back to competitive cricket in about 45 days. ?I am to seek the advise of Andrew Leipus, the Indian team physio, for an assessment.?

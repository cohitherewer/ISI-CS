 Ponting out of third Test

Sydney: Australian captain Ricky Ponting will miss the third Test against India in Nagpur from October 26 after he failed to recover completely from a finger injury sustained last month. 

A disappointed Ponting said he had had X-rays on the broken left thumb on Thursday morning which revealed that although he was recovering well, it was not healing as quickly as he had hoped. 

?Obviously, I am very disappointed. The thumb is certainly healing, but there is no strength in it, and the medical advice is that I would be a one-in-a-hundred chance of being right for the third Test,? Ponsaid on Thursday. ?Basically it just needs some more time to heal properly.? 

Cricket Australia medical adviser Dr Trefor James said examination by Sydney specialist Ian Hargreaves, had confirmed that the bone was knitting well. ?While he is progressing well, his thumb is not yet strong enough to grip a bat and he will not be ready to play before the third Test,? he said. 

?All going to plan I should be right to play the fourth Test, but...we won?t know until we have some further X-rays done,? added Ponting, who has hit 20 centuries in 79 Tests.

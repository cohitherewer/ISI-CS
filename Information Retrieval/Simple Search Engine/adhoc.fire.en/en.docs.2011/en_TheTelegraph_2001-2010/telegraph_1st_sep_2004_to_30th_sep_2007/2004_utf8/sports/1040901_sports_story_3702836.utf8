The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Close call for spinners slot in XI

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI 

Calcutta: It was a must-win match when Team India met England last, in the 2003 World Cup. Its going to be no different when Sourav Ganguly goes for the toss at Trent Bridge on Wednesday. 

Thanks to Ashish Nehras career-best six for 23, India won that Durban game by an emphatic 82 runs and, high on confidence, went on to hammer Pakistan too (in Centurion). 

Sourav will be looking for something similar not just at Trent Bridge, where the NatWest Challenge gets underway, but at The Oval and Lords as well. 

Indias chances, however, have already been dented by the non-availability of Sachin Tendulkar. But, as Sourav told The Telegraph (when contacted at the team hotel in Nottingham): Life has to go on Its an injury and theres nothing we can do except hope for a quick recovery. 

Incidentally, physio Andrew Leipus has sought an appointment with a London-based specialist to examine Sachins left arm which has been affected by the tennis elbow on Thursday. 

Speaking exclusively, he said: Sachins recovery is slow He has got back some power, but remains in discomfort Frankly, it wont be wise to risk him In any case, a tennis elbow is a nasty injury 

The team, as of now, is going to reach London on Wednesday night itself. The drive from Nottingham will take around two-and-half hours. 

To talk of the opening NatWest match, theres uncertainty only over who is going to take the sole specialist spinners slot. 

There has been no official announcement, but sources suggested Kumble is slightly ahead in the race with Harbhajan Singh. The call, though, will be close. 

As for the quicks, Nehra, Lakshmipathy Balaji and Irfan Pathan are going to figure in the XI. 

If Kumble does make it, the bowling combination of the last game (versus Australia, in Amstelveen) will be retained. 

Apparently, the team management doesnt want to blood Dinesh Karthik right now and, so, Mohammed Kaif is going to keep his place despite a complete lack of form. 

Rohan Gavaskar, of course, continues to benefit from Sachins non-availability. 

INDIAN XI for trent bridge 

Sourav Ganguly, Virender Sehwag, V.V.S.Laxman, Rahul Dravid, Yuvraj Singh, Mohammed Kaif, Rohan Gavaskar, Irfan Pathan, Lakshmipathy Balaji, Ashish Nehra, Anil Kumble/Harbhajan Singh. 

Handsome reward 

Meanwhile, a leading businessman of Indian origin has decided to present 50,000 to Virender Sehwag for becoming Indias first triple century-maker in Tests. Vice-captain Rahul Dravid, one learns, will receive 30,000.

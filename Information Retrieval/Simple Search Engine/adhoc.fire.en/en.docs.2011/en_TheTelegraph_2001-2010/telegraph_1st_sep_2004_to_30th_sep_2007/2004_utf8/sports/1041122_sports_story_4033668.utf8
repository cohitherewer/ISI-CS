Calcutta: Subhas Bhowmick often takes pride in describing East Bengal as the solitary team in contemporary national scenario the rival clubs love to hate. This has been in obvious reference to the red-and-gold brigade?s unflagging success under him in major club tournaments. 

After Sunday, that bit of ?hatred? must be making few of those minds heavier as East Bengal, under Bhowmick, completed the hattrick of CFL Super Division titles in style. 

The 3-0 demolition of Mohammedan Sporting at the Salt Lake Stadium ? thanks to Shylo Malsawmtluanga?s double and Paolo Roberto da Silva?s fifth goal in three league matches ? meant the holders stretched their lead to 39 and beyond the second-placed Mohun Bagan and Ever-Ready (35)?s reach. 

Considering the facts that East Bengal have remained unbeaten in the long-drawn league and the title (30th in all) has been bagged with one match (versus Ever-Ready) still to go, Bhowmick?s boys look winners on all fronts. 

To some extent, Mohammedan Sporting were not expected to upset East Bengal?s applecart, by holding or shocking the fancied rivals and thereby, delaying the process of identifying the champions. Bhowmick wanted to finish off the business before he could train eyes on some unfinished ones in the Federation Cup. 

The intentions were clear right from the word go as East Bengal?s much-famed operation down the flanks was at play and it needed just 13 minutes to open the floodgates. 

Douglas da Silva snatched a ball in the middle third and a quick release from him found Paolo on the edge of the box. The latter wisely set it up for Malsawmtluanga to his right. 

The diminutive winger took his time, assessed the goalkeeper Chinmoy Banerjee?s position and then produced a low powerful shot, which beat the man under the bar hands down. 

In the 22nd minute, a quick exchange of pass with Gurpreet Singh down the left released Alvito D?Cunha clear into the box, but Chinmoy effected a nice save. Seconds later, up came another shot from Alvito?s boots almost from the similar position and the Mohammedan Sporting custodian again denied the player. 

Ten minutes from the breather, Chinmoy was beaten for the second time. And Malsawmtluanga was again the perfect executioner. 

It was now Alvito?s turn to send the Mizo lad away on the left. Malsawmtluanga outsped the rival backline and on entering the box, kept his cool and deftly chipped the ball past the rushing goalkeeper. A clinical finish. 

Biswajit Bhattacharya?s boys were so shell-shocked in dealing with one East Bengal attack after another that they bothered to test Sangram Mukherjee for the first time in 38th minute. Henry Chukwukei?s grounder was well covered though by the East Bengal captain. 

The second half saw the return of Bhaichung Bhutia after a long injury lay-off. Sasthi Duley and Dipankar Roy, who also had made their return to field, in the previous match, after spending over a week behind the bars, had to watch from sidelines their teammates toying with the rivals. 

Before Bhaichung replaced Paolo, the Brazilian redeemed an otherwise lacklustre show by completing the rout in the 65th minute. 

Thereafter, there were only a few things to happen, with Mohammedan Sporting clearly intent on not conceding any more. Bhaichung roved like a hawk in and around the box for a goal while, on another occasion, Selwyn Fernandes almost conceded a suicidal goal. But Sangram reacted sharply to save his backpass, resulting a free-kick. No wonder, Raman Vijayan amp; Co. made a mess of that chance.

 SCG to host till 2010

Sydney: An attempt by Sydney?s Olympic Stadium owners to wrest Test hosting rights from the traditional Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) has been rejected. Instead, Cricket New South Wales (NSW) announced on Friday that all international cricket would be played at the SCG till October 2010. 

Cricket NSW chairman Bob Horsell said: ?The Board of Cricket NSW is unanimous in its decision that playing international cricket at the SCG for the next five years is best for the game?s future.? 

Cricket NSW chief executive David Gilbert had caused concern among traditionalists in July by saying tenders had been sought for a long-term deal once the present contract with the SCG expired in September 2005. (Reuters)

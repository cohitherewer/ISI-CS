 BCCI seeks clarifications from ICC

 Harbhajan

New Delhi: Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president-elect (constitutionally) Ranbir Singh Mahendra Thursday said the board had sought certain clarifications from the International Cricket Council (ICC) on the reporting of Harbhajan Singh. 

?We have asked for clarification on the dates... from which the six week period comes into effect. We have also sought explanation on the 15 degrees,? Mahendra said. 

Harbhajan was reported during the second Test against Bangladesh in Chittagong from December 17 to 20. 

The off-spinner was reported by Match Referee Chris Broad and umpires Aleem Dar and Mark Benson on the fourth day of that Test. 

Meanwhile, Mahendra added that they hope to finalise the itinerary for the upcoming series against Pakistan by January 15. 

?The Pakistan Cricket Board has asked for the venues and dates. Hopefully we will announce it before January 15,? he mentioned.

 Ugly racism mars Spain victory

Madrid: A slick Spain side claimed a deserved 1-0 victory over England in a ill-tempered friendly marred by racist chanting at the Bernabeu on Wednesday. Asier del Horno scored the winner when he looped a header past keeper Paul Robinson in the ninth minute after England had failed to clear a corner. 

But racist chanting took centrestage at the Bernabeu. The game was marred by continual monkey noises directed at visiting black players and by a regular chorus of ?If you are not f*****g black jump up and down? sung by large sections of the 55,000 crowd at the Real Madrid stadium. 

Spanish media and football authorities accused their English counterparts of mounting a witch-hunt against them. On the other hand, British politicians, media and the England team were outraged by scenes which have largely been wiped out of the English game after numerous campaigns following problems in the 1980s. 

British Prime Minister Tony Blair was ?very disappointed? by the racial abuse. 

?The Prime Minister like everyone in the country was very disappointed with what happened last night in Spain,? his spokeswoman said.?He believes racism has no part to play in sport or in any other matter.? 

?There is no place for racism in football or modern society, and I strongly believe that action needs to be taken at the highest level,? British sports minister Richard Caborn said. 

The Spanish foreign ministry on Thursday condemned racist chanting. ?If there were racist chants then that is deplorable and lamentable and it is not suitable behaviour for football fans,? a spokesman for the foreign ministry said. 

?I am certain that it was only a small element of the crowd and Spain strongly rejects such behaviour.? 

The Spanish federation?s press officer Fernando Garrido refused to permit any questions about the incidents, saying that some of the blame for the incident lay with English reporters. ?Were there racist chants against some players? This hasn?t happened in the Spanish league and Spain for many years,? he said. ?So you (English reporters) should ask yourselves what you have done to contribute to all this.? 

The run-up to the match was marked by controversy involving coach Luis Aragones, who mounted an angry defence of his recent comments about Thierry Henry in which he had referred to the Arsenal and France striker as ?that black s**t? during a Spanish training session last month. 

?I?ve always said my conscience is clear and I only want to talk about football,? Aragones said after the match. 

A 10-minute anti-racist video was shown before the match on the stadium?s big screens and the two teams lined up behind a banner bearing the slogan ?All united against racism in football?. 

But the atmosphere soured as soon as the game started with Ashley Cole and later substitute Shaun Wright-Phillips greeted by monkey noises every time they touched the ball. 

Spanish daily ABC made little comment about the racist abuse by the crowd but accused English reporters of mounting an orchestrated campaign against Aragones. 

England coach Sven-Goran Eriksson said: ?The issue of racism is big. There must be a protest through official ways,? he said. ?It is up the FA, the Spanish FA and Uefa to address. I am against racism and it should not happen in 2004 in any country.? 

England captain David Beckham told the FA?s website: ?It?s disappointing when it happens anywhere in world football because we all know how wrong it is ? and so many people are working so hard to cut it out of the game.? 

Meanwhile, Fabrizio Miccoli struck the winner for Italy in a 1-0 victory over Finland at Messina?s San Filippo stadium on Wednesday. 

France ended a disappointing year with a 0-0 draw at home to Poland in an international friendly at the Stade de France on Wednesday, their fourth consecutive draw at home. (Reuters)

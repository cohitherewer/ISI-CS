 Bangla adopt Twenty20

Dhaka: Bangladesh have decided to introduce a Twenty20 tournament in domestic cricket in order to produce better results in one-day Internationals, an official said on Monday. 

?We haven?t made good progress in one-day cricket and the pressure of scoring fast in the new tournament will help us find some hard-hitters,? Bangladesh cricket board official Khondokar Jamiluddin said. 

?We?ve decided to adopt the new format as we believe it will improve our performance in one-day cricket.? 

Bangladesh have won just five of their 95 one-dayers. 

Twelve teams will participate in the tournament starting on October 15.

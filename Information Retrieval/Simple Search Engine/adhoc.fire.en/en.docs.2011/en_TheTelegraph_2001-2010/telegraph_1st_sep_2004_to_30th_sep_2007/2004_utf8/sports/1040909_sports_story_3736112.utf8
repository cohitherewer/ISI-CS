The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Garrison, McEnroe pay tribute to Gibson 

 Elena Dementieva during her match against Amelie Mauresmo on Tuesday 

New York: For more than half her life, Zina Garrison heard the same advice from Althea Gibson: work on your serve. Yet not until Gibson?s funeral did Garrison truly understand what her friend and mentor meant. 

?Not only serving myself, but serving my community,? Garrison said. 

Garrison joined John McEnroe and others in an on-court tribute to Gibson at the US Open on Tuesday night, honouring the woman they called the ?African-American Mother of Tennis.? 

The festivities took place at the Arthur Ashe Stadium before Serena Williams played Jennifer Capriati in the quarter finals. 

Gibson, who died last year on September 28 at 76, was the first black player to compete at Wimbledon and the US championships, as the Open was known in 1950. 

She won the singles title at both events in 1957-58, part of the 11 Grand Slam singles and doubles titles she took overall. Gibson also excelled at golf, and became the first black player on the LPGA Tour. 

?She gave all minorities a chance to break a lot of barriers,? Garrison said during the ceremony. 

?It is truly appropriate to recognise the achievements of Althea Gibson here at the Open,? McEnroe said. 

Garrison, now 40 and an Olympic gold medallist, first met Gibson at age 15. Garrison went on the become the first black to reach a Wimbledon final since Gibson.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Romario kicked out by Fluminense

 - Club president says it was necessary ?in the best interests? of the team 

 Romario may have entered the last stage of his career 

Rio de Janeiro: Former Brazil striker Romario has been kicked out by his club Fluminense after a series of fitness problems and clashes with his coaches. 

?It?s a sad moment, but it?s in the best interests of the club,? Fluminense president David Fischel said in a television interview broadcast on Thursday. ?The situation had become wearing for Fluminense and wearing for Romario.? 

Fischel said he had not been able to contact the 38-year-old former PSV Eindhoven, Barcelona and Valencia striker to tell him the news personally. 

Although most commentators have urged him to end his career, there was widespread speculation on Thursday that Romario could rejoin neighbours Vasco da Gama, where he began his career. 

The 1994 World Cup winner?s situation at Fluminense became untenable after he clashed with coach Alexandre Gama, who is two years Romario?s junior, and Fischel backed the coach. 

The pair were involved in a public slanging match last week and Romario initially came out on top when Fischel intervened and told Gama to play him in Saturday?s match against Goias. 

The president changed sides, however, when Romario gave a lame performance and was substituted after an hour amid a chorus of jeers. Fluminense lost the game 1-4. 

Romario had not previously played since August because of a lack of match fitness. 

Romario joined Fluminense in 2002, scoring 12 goals to lead them to the semi-finals of the Brazilian championship. 

Since then, the goals have dried up and most attention has been focused on his much-publicised privileges, which include the right to travel to away games alone. 

Romario has rarely practised with his teammates this year, saying he needs a special training programme because of his age. 

He has scored five goals in the Brazilian championship. 

Gama is Fluminense?s fourth coach this year and two of his predecessors, Valdir Espinosa and Ricardo Gomes, resigned because they were unhappy about the situation. 

Romario has also been involved in controversy outside the club, kicking up a storm this month when he said he considered himself to be Brazil?s most important player since the 1970 World Cup. 

Ronaldo hit back last week and described Romario?s comment as pretentious.

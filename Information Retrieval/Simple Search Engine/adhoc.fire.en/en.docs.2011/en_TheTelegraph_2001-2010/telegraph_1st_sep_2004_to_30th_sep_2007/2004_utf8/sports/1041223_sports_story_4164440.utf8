 Wait-and-watch for Australia

 - ASHES SERIES 

 Shane Warne feels there?s a long way to go yet 

Melbourne: Australia?s cricketers have praised England?s eighth consecutive Test victory, but say talk of breaking the Aussies? Ashes supremacy is premature. England mastered South Africa by seven wickets in Port Elizabeth on Tuesday to eclipse the previous record for English consecutive Test wins which had stood for 75 years. 

Australian wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist and champion leg-spinner Shane Warne acclaimed England?s success, but suggested it was too early to say whether England were capable of supplanting Australia as the world?s No. 1 Test nation when they meet in next year?s Ashes series in England. 

?It?s a fantastic win for them. They?ve played great cricket, they?ve won eight Test matches in a row now and it?s a good team that does it against any opposition,? Gilchrist said. 

?I think they?re shaping up as a very formidable opponent for anyone. ?But there?s a lot of time between now and the Ashes ? there?s a lot of cricket to be played between now and then,? Gilchrist said. 

Australia regained the Ashes from England in 1989 under Allan Border and haven?t lost in seven subsequent series. 

?Excellent victory for England. With guys like (Steve) Harmison and (Andrew) Flintoff they?re obviously a very good side,? Shane Warne said. 

?But we?ll have to wait and see. I think everyone in England?s been saying ?bring on the Ashes? for 12 months, but they?ve been saying so for the last 15 years. ?We?ll wait until it gets a little closer.?

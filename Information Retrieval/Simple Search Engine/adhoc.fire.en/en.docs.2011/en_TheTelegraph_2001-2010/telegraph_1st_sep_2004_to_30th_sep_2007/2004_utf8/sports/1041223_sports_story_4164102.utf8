 Allodium upstaged young lot 

 STAR RACER

 It was a case of an experienced horse managing to transform his reserves into productive energy over a comparative unskilled lot in the 1,600m Eveready Calcutta Gold Cup last Saturday. Allodium, an eight-year-old, was stable jockey C. Alford?s choice, and also enjoyed his connection?s support in the betting with the closing odds at 2-1. The Twist And Turn-Dangerous Romance son had demonstrated in his previous start that age had not withered his form. He had given a tough fight to a western India-migrant, Star Magic, in his earlier start.

 In the Gold Cup, he was facing a triangular three-year-olds? challenge from Alaskan, Elistano ? both also in the betting at 5-2 ? and a less-fancied Calorific. While Elistano failed because of bursting blood vessels during the run, Calorific and Alaskan took the favourite the full distance, making it an exciting contest. Full marks to trainer Bharath Singh, who had full faith in his aged ward.

 The afternoon, which predominantly saw favourites justifying their odds in most of the eight events, also witnessed a friendless Anokato defying the day?s trend. The Daniel David-trainee, has invariably sprung a surprise in the past, and in the Eveready Recharge Cup he surprised fancied runners like Bold Raider, Final Round and Thrilling Proposal. The last named, however, found the 1,200m trip too sharp to his liking. Retained Asset, another of Daniel?s charge, claimed The Telegraph Cup in a manner of a seasoned campaigner. Akhtar, who partnered the two-year-old, by Warrshan-Autumn Affair, had the second-favourite running off the pace in fourth before making his winning bid in the final 300 metres. Aptitude, the even-money favourite finished a poor second and may repay losses soon. 

 Earlier on, another Daniel favourite, One For Me, had made good of her light impost, leading virtually from the start to down a strongly fancied Karan?s Choice. Vijay scored two against Daniel?s three and both of his odds on winners ? Anzello and Exclusive Affair ? recorded bloodless wins in their respective events ? the 2,000m Greedale Cup and the 1,600m Fame Star Cup.

 But Bharath?s hot-favourite, Alarico, was stretched to the fullest in his bid to lift the 1,400m Eveready Jeevan Sathi Cup. Outpaced in the first half of the trip, Shanker was seen coaxing the quarter-money favourite to improve. However, the expected respond from the Steinbeck-As Ever three-year-old came only in the last 250m when it was least expected. The favourite covered the required ground ? nearly six lengths ? to pip Destiny?s Trick at the post to the relief of his backers. The style of Alarico?s running suggest he may do better over a distance of ground.

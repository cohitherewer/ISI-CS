The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Warne ?clashes? with umpire Dar 

Brisbane: Australia?s spin-king Shane Warne said he did not expect to be punished after an exchange with Pakistan umpire Aleem Dar during the first Test against New Zealand here on Friday. 

The leading Test wicket-taker was called for two wides that Dar interpreted as ?negative? bowling as he attempted to stifle century-maker Jacob Oram?s scoring with deliveries down the leg-side. 

The Black Cap allrounder top-scored with a blistering unbeaten 126 in his team?s first innings of 353 to put the Aussies under pressure on the Day II. 

?I was trying to bowl a slow top-spinner wide of leg-stump so he (Oram) could top-edge a sweep, because he likes to sweep and the umpire said it was negative bowling so he ?wided? me,? Warne said. 

?I thought the first one was a little bit wide but the second one I didn?t think it was a wide so I asked him ?is that negative, is it?? and he said ?you look after your job and I?ll worry about mine?, so I said ?no problem?.? 

Warne said he was disappointed to be called for the wides but didn?t expect any official sanction to be taken against him for the exchange with Dar. (AFP)

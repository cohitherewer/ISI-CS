The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Greece and Porto?s memorable year

 - Fifa, Uefa and other authorities will have to be even more vigilant to stop racism

London: Greece?s extraordinary success at Euro 2004 and Porto?s victory in the Champions League final brought romanticism back to international soccer in a landmark year for the sport in 2004. 

Greece?s remarkable upset in becoming European champions after starting the tournament as 80-1 outsiders did not meet with universal approval from purists unhappy with their defensive approach. 

It was hard to disagree with coach Otto Rehhagel?s counter-attacking tactics, however, as Greece clinched the title by beating hosts Portugal in both the opening match (2-1) and final (1-0). They also got the better of reigning champions France (1-0) in the quarter finals and the favourite the Czech Republic (1-0) in the semis. 

Portugal hosted an outstanding festival of soccer and fully expected to crown it with victory over Greece in the final after seeing off England and The Netherlands in the knockout stages. 

Victory at Lisbon?s Stadium of Light on July 4 would have completed an incredible double for the nation following Porto?s 3-0 victory over Monaco in the Champions League final six weeks earlier. 

But a 57th-minute header from Angelos Haristeas decided the final and secured Greece the greatest upset victory in international soccer history. 

Unfancied teams have beaten far more favoured rivals in one-off games for decades but none rated as lowly as Greece and with no footballing pedigree had ever won an international tournament as prestigious as the European Championship before. 

Fifa celebrated its 100th anniversary this year and Uefa, the European governing body, and their Asian counterparts the AFC, marked their golden jubilees. 

While they enjoyed nostalgic looks back at their celebrated histories, the games? rulers had their hands full coping with modern problems. 

In December last year Fifa president Sepp Blatter first admitted publicly that soccer had a growing problem with doping and the issue has continued to blight the game during the past 12 months. 

Racism was another issue to plague the game again after it appeared to have been consigned to history. 

After various low-key outbreaks throughout Europe during the year, England?s black players were subjected to constant abuse during a friendly in Madrid in November. 

Fifa, Uefa and other authorities have worked hard to stop racism in recent years, but will have to be even more vigilant with even tougher sanctions for offenders in the future.

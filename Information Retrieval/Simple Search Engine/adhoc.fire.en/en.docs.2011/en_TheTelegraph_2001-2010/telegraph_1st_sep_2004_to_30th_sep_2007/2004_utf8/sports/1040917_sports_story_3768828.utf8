London: Damien Martyn and Andrew Symonds struck half-centuries as Australia romped into the Champions Trophy semi-finals with a seven-wicket win over New Zealand in their pool A match at The Oval on Thursday. 

Martyn scored 60 not out and Symonds cracked an unbeaten 71 off 47 balls as the world champions cruised to 199 for three in 37.2 overs in response to New Zealand?s 198 for nine. 

Australia fast bowlers Glenn McGrath and Michael Kasprowicz took three wickets each. McGrath knocked over the top order and finished with three for 39, while Kasprowicz tore through the middle on way to three for 32. 

Australia will now meet the winners of Friday?s game between England and Sri Lanka in the first semi-final at Edgbaston on Tuesday. 

?It was a very good effort I thought,? said Australian captain Ricky Ponting. ?The wicket had a little bit in it with the new ball when we bowled and certainly when we batted. 

?Our fast bowlers did a good job getting a few wickets early on and putting them on the back foot, then Andrew Symonds, Damien Martyn and Matthew Hayden played beautifully.? 

New Zealand looked threatening early on when Adam Gilchrist was bowled for four by Jacob Oram in the first over and Kyle Mills had three leg before appeals turned down against Matthew Hayden. Ponting went cheaply, bowled for 14 by Scott Styris, but Hayden and Martyn continued to methodically tick off the runs. 

After Hayden was dismissed for 47 trying to smash medium-slow bowler Chris Harris down the ground only to be caught at mid-off by Chris Cairns, Symonds and Martyn worked the slower bowlers around and dispatched the occasional ball to the boundary. Symonds struck four sixes and seven fours in his 11th ODI fifty, while Martyn hit nine fours in his 23rd limited-overs half-century. 

Only spirited lower-order resistance from wicketkeeper Brendon McCullum and Daniel Vettori spared New Zealand the embarrassment of a lower score after they had slumped to 89 for seven. 

McCullum top-scored with 47 and combined with Harris (26) in a 35-run partnership for the eighth wicket before he and Vettori (29 not out) added 68 runs for the ninth.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Wladimir wins comeback bout

Las Vegas: Wladimir Klitschko was knocked down and ended up bleeding on his stool, but scorecards said he beat Davarryl Williamson after the heavyweight fight was stopped at the end of the fifth round because of a head butt. 

The ring doctor ruled Klitschko was bleeding too badly to continue, and officials went to the ringside scorecards because the butt was unintentional. Klitschko won by a split decision. 

Klitschko, the younger brother of WBC heavyweight champion Vitali Klitschko, was making a comeback after being stopped in the fifth round of his last fight with Lamon Brewster. His fate looked uncertain again when Williamson threw a right hand that dropped him to one knee in the fourth round. 

That was one of only a few punches landed by Williamson, though, who lost four of the five rounds on two scorecards. Two judges had Klitschko winning 49-46, while the third had Williamson ahead 48-47. 

?It was not an easy fight,? Klitschko said. ?I really felt his right hand.? Klitschko was booed by many in the crowd at the outdoor arena at Caesars Palace after the decision was announced. But he landed most of the bigger punches, other than the right hand that dropped him 40 seconds in the fourth round. ?He hit me with the right hand but I was off balance,? the junior Klitschko said.

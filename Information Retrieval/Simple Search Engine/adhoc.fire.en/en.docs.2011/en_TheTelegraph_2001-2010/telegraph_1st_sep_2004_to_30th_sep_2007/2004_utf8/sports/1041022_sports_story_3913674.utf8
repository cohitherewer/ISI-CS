 Pakistan nudge ahead of Sri Lanka

 - First Test - Samaraweera hits fourth hundred; Shoaib bags five, Sami four 

Faisalabad: Thilan Samaraweera?s fourth Test hundred and Shoaib Akhtar?s ninth five-wicket haul dominated an absorbing second day of the first Test between Pakistan and Sri Lanka on Thursday. 

Sri Lanka, who were bowled out for 243 after losing three wickets in 22 balls, fought back to reduce Pakistan to 256 for eight at the close. 

Pakistan, bidding for their first home series win over Sri Lanka since 1995-96, lead by just 13 runs on an increasingly docile pitch. 

Pakistan lost their way after rapid moving on to 85 for one at lunch, losing three wickets before tea and four in the final session. 

Inzamam-ul-Haq (32), Shoaib Malik (48), Moin Khan (5) and Abdul Razzaq (39) fell in the final session to hand the tourists the initiative. 

Moin was bowled by Sanath Jayasuriya with seven overs remaining and Razzaq was caught in the slips off the bowling of Chaminda Vaas. 

Pakistan mustered only two notable partnerships, Yasir Hameed (58) and Asim Kamal (17) putting on 66 for the second wicket and Inzamam and Malik adding 54 for the fifth. 

The morning session was dominated by the 28-year-old Samaraweera, who square cut the first ball he received from Shoaib for a three to reach his century. 

Shoaib took his revenge, however, when he dismissed Samaraweera in the same over and he also accounted for Dilhara Fernando to complete figures of five for 60, his ninth five-wickets haul in his 33rd Test. 

His new ball partner Mohammed Sami took four for 71, bowling last man Lasith Malinga for one. 

Pakistan made a flying start with Hameed, opening for the first time in Tests, hitting 10 fours mainly through the leg side. 

Seamer Dilhara Fernando removed Kamal in the sixth over after lunch when he chased a wide ball outside off stump. 

He than had Hameed caught at square leg for 58, his fourth half century in his 11th Test. 

Left-arm spinner Rangana Herath had Yousuf Youhana caught behind for 17 and in the final session Inzamam top-edged a catch to mid-on. 

Malik was run out by a direct throw from Vaas at mid-on as he tried to steal a single.

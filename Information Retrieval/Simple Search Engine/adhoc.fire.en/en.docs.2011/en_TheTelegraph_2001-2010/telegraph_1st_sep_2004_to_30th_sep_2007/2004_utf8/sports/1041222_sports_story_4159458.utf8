The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Pak sports minister for change in captaincy 

 Inzamam has been flayed as ?slow moving? and ?unimaginative? 

 Islamabad: Pakistan?s captain 

 Inzamam-ul Haq has come under fire from the government and 

 cricket board officials for his team?s ignominious defeat 

 against Australia in the first Test in Perth two days ago. 

 The country?s sports minister Muhammad Ajmal Khan said Pakistan 

 cricket needed spirited and aggressive captain to rejuvenate 

 the team. ?Though I am not a cricket expert I believe that an 

 aggressive and energetic captain would definitely help improve 

 Pakistan?s performance. We need a captain like Imran Khan 

 or anyone near his capabilities. A slow moving captain can 

 in no way help the team?s cause,? he told the media here 

 on Monday. 

?Inzamam looks too unimaginative and so far has failed to handle the team,? he said while suggesting for a change in captaincy. 

Pakistan lost the first Test by a huge margin of 491 runs on Sunday, which was the fourth highest margin of defeat in cricket history and the country?s worst-ever loss. 

The minister also took on the Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer and said he was personally against appointment of foreign coaches. 

?How can one expect a foreign coach to communicate effectively with players who know little English,? he said questioning the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB)?s spending ?80,000-a-year on the English coach. 

?I am all for local coaches, because having them would mean better communication with the players and also we wouldn?t have to pay exorbitant salaries.? 

The PCB chief Shaharyar Khan, who is also under pressure, said despite the heavy loss, it would not be prudent to effect wholesale changes in the squad. ?Our batsmen disappointed while the performance of the bowlers was not so bad. But we will not make any decision in haste to fire anyone,? he was quoted as saying in the media here on Tuesday. 

?People will wish the board to take immediate decisions but we have to consider all aspects,? Shaharyar said while backing Inzamam.

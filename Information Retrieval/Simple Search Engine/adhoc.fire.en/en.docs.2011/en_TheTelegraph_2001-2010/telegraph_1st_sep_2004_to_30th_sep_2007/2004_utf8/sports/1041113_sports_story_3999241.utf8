The Telegraph - Calcutta

Sourav return should make a difference

Guest Column 

Ajit Wadekar

It?s about time Indians got their act together. The 

fact that we have lost thrice to them in the past will certainly weigh pretty 

heavily on the Indians? minds and this will have to be overcome when they meet 

in the one-off one-day International at the Eden Saturday.

We haven?t really been doing well in the recent past, 

and the Mumbai Test victory notwithstanding, there is no denying that our recent 

past with the Pakistani team will assume more importance.

Indians do take a little time to warm up in a series. 

This has always happened. Hence, maybe, we saw the debacle of the Australia series 

before the comeback. Cricket is a funny game. If I say comeback is a trend ? and 

now that skipper Sourav Ganguly will also be back ? we should fare well. But it 

will ultimately be the players and their form on that particular day. 

Sourav should make a difference. Nobody will be in 

the team to be just a passenger. We should leave the fitness issue to the player. 

And we must understand that every pair of eyes will be on Sourav. He is damn good 

especially when it comes to one-dayers. His aggression will surely matter.

I must admit that Bob Woolmer has effected quite a 

transformation on the Pakistan team, adding aggression to their approach. 

Pakistan have better allrounders in the team, we can?t 

really boast much on that account. Players like Shoaib Malik and Abdul Razzaq 

can change the course of a match with the bat and the ball. 

I?ll say Pakistan do look a trifle better equipped 

on paper. They look full of beans, bursting at the seams with confidence, one 

commodity that is in short supply today in the Indian ranks. Yet, I must remind 

all that this is a one-day game and predictions make little sense.

However, if one even works on the probability theory, 

I?d say again, it?s about time that India came out of this bad patch. Let?s look 

at it this way. Pakistan have allrounders, and they also have a good bowling line-up. 

India need to depend on their batsmen, therefore. Not just because batting is 

India?s depth, but India needs to depend on their batting.

The wicket at the Eden has always been good, yet, 

I will say if India bat first, a total of 280-300 should look good. I understand 

I am talking a bit high, but considering India?s current dearth of confidence.

The return of Shoaib Akhtar will be another boost 

for the tourists. This change in ICC rules (regarding the degrees of flexion) 

has helped. Guess what, there are chuckers and there are chuckers. Unless somebody 

gets dangerous or starts getting wickets by the bucketloads, we don?t bother about 

him. Till then, he is fine. Yes, the bowler is a second class citizen in the world 

of cricket, especially one-day cricket. Let?s accept it.

I am sure Shoaib Akhtar will be a great hit here. 

I remember him coming over to Mumbai for a programme of mine with handicapped 

cricketers. He is a great person as well, and can be a great friend. But let me 

remind you, friendship stops when on the field. Just like my idol Gary Sobers. 

I had great respet for him, but I had told him this stops once I am on the field.

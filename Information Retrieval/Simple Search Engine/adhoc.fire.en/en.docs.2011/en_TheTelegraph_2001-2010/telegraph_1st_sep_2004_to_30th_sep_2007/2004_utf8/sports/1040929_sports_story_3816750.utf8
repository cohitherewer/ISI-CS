The Telegraph - Calcutta

4-1 win not true Indian standard 

Stickwork

Gurbux Singh

Now is the time for experimenting. We need to put 

the Olympics out of our minds and concentrate on long-term goals. I don?t see 

this Test series with Pakistan as any deciding series. This, at best, is a series 

that will allow the coach to separate the men from the boys.

It has been a disappointing Olympics for both countries. 

This series was mooted before the Athens Games, and expectation from the public, 

federation and players is high. The players need to redeem themselves because 

even today high value is accorded to a India-Pakistan series. 

However, what I found from the first two matches is 

that the players are either drained out or not motivated enough. On this count 

India are somewhat better placed, because anyway five players from the Olympic 

squad are out. There is reason for the kids to press on.

While patches of good Indian work continues ? goalkeeper 

Adrian D?Souza and skipper Dilip Tirkey, for example ? I was disappointed with 

how low the big names in the Pakistani squad are. Such motivation drops do happen 

after high-pressure events like the Olympic Games. Pakistani big names, especially 

Shoail Abbas and Rehan Butt and Kashif Jawad et al have not impressed. 

And I haven?t been impressed with the Pakistani defence 

for the last one decade. The full backs are ordinary and the performance was lethargic.

The first match in Karachi was listless on both sides 

and overall the better side (Pakistan) won, and India dominated the second. I 

have to say in the same breath that the Pakistani goalkeeping was rather poor. 

Whereas Sandeep Singh was not given a full game in the first match, he succeeded 

in the second. It is high time he is given the maximum chance to try out his penalty 

corners. He should try and fit into the regular team in the mould of a Jugraj 

Singh.

The Quetta result was probably because of the youngsters 

in the forward line. They have nothing to lose and everything to gain, and carry 

no baggage of past performances. But let?s not fool ourselves, India are certainly 

not four goals better than Pakistan, as we may have assumed after the second Test.

Let us now follow a policy of trying out new talent, 

without really caring for the results. I am not looking at next year?s Champions 

Trophy or the Asian Games. I am looking at 2008 and at 2012. Because, unless we 

start thinking long term, we will again end up where we finished in Athens. The 

return of Deepak Thakur and Gagan Ajit Singh will bode well, and the rest can 

pitch in with youthful vigour.

This talent search will be facilitated with the start 

of the National League (starting, probably, in November) in hockey. It will be 

interesting to watch the top six teams and over 60 players and be able to make 

picks easily. And since the format will allow teams to absorb foreign players 

for the League, the competition should be of high class. This, hence is a great 

opportunity.

Then there are tours scheduled for junior teams ? 

junior Asia Cup in Dhaka, then an under-21 tour to Australia ? and this will be 

good exposure.

In team composition, we have unfortunately put too 

much emphasis on the forward line alone. We need, for the new team, skilful players 

who can do the game-making fore the forward thrust and the entry into the circle 

from where penalty corners can be forced. These were players like Baljit Singh 

Dhillon and earlier Dhanraj Pillay. With the departure of such players this section 

remains vacant, so to say. The Tirkeys of the Indian squad can?t last forever. 

Hope we can get quick replacements and a second and third line to fill in.

Let us have around 30 players being tried out at different 

points for the national team. That not only allows selectors and coaches to see 

all, but also keeps players under pressure to perform.

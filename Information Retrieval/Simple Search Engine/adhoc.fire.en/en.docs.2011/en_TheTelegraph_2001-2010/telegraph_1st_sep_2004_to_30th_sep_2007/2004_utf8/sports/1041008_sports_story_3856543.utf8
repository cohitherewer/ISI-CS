The Telegraph - Calcutta

India?s trapping errors are unpardonable

Guest Column

The 1-1 result meant the India-Pakistan hockey series 

is still alive, though the quality of hockey displayed at the Sector 42 Stadium 

was only marginally better than the one shown in New Delhi two days earlier.

But by far the most heartening thing was that the 

hockey fans of Chandigarh came out in huge numbers to see the match. The stadium 

should actually seat only about 22,000-24,000 people, but I believe there were 

many more than that, probably close to 27,000-28,000. And many were left standing 

out, as the gates were closed way before the match began.

The weather was once again a damper and we need to 

question, once again, why matches are being held at 1.30 in the afternoon. Surely 

it is important to think about the comforts of the players, too. Add to this factor 

that the schedule is so tight that there is no time for recovery. There is just 

one day in between the games and that is spent in travelling.

Also I cannot understand why Hyderabad had to be the 

last match. Could it not have been the first and then the series could have moved 

north with the next match in Delhi and then Chandigarh and finally Amritsar, which 

is a stone?s throw from Pakistan. Now, imagine these teams will need to travel 

from Amritsar to Hyderabad for the last game and then back home. 

For players to produce good hockey, it is important 

to give them good conditions, too.

India may have kept the series alive, but they now 

need to win both the remaining games to level this Dosti series. There 

were more attacks from either side, but the way these teams miss the chances that 

come their way, European sides will overrun them, which has been the case in recent 

times. Also, I cannot understand how they can waste so many penalty corners.

The Indians may have done well to hold the Pakistanis 

in the absence of skipper Dilip Tirkey, with Viren Rasquinha doing duty as a defender 

and skipper. But the big disappointment was the forward line. Sandeep Michael, 

Vivek Gupta and others are missing too many chances.

Also, an unpardonable error at this level is the kind 

of trapping Indian boys have been showing. It has been poor and they have simply 

not been able to keep possession and they lose the ball all too easily.

The defence did a good job. The midfield can definitely 

show more method in their feeding.

The Pakistanis have claimed they have been indulging 

in some experiments. Probably they have the Champions Trophy in mind and coach 

Roelant Oltmans is rightly working towards it. 

Frankly, though, even the Pakistani front line has 

not been as aggressive or on-target as we have seen in the past. Even their seasoned 

forwards are missing chances. Players like Rehan Butt, Shakeel Abbassi and others 

are generally more accurate than they are showing right now.

Maybe it is fatigue and the timing of the matches 

and energy-sapping weather. 

Ignace Tirkey had the best game. He was rightly awarded 

the Man of the Match trophy and the cash that goes with it. Ignace has flowered 

in the last few months. I only hope this progress continues and does not fall 

off like it has in the case of many others.

One must also give credit to Viren, for adapting wonderfully 

as a defender. He is a thinking player and is really good for the team.

As for match tactics, Indians could have done better 

by exploiting their left flank that was often left open. They did try a few times 

in the second half but were not penetrative enough in their efforts.

Sohail Abbas failed to make the world record his own, 

as he missed quite a few penalty corners. Though their only goal of the match 

came from a penalty corner, it was off an indirect effort, which Ghazanfar Ali 

scored. So, Sohail will have to wait further to try and get the world record for 

goals.

With two more games left, India will need to put in 

a little more effort and try and win the games to level the series. Even a draw 

will not do any more, it has to be a win in both games. 

Though the Indians have not played to their potential, 

winning both games is not beyond them, simply because even the Pakistanis, despite 

their lead in the series, are not really overwhelming.

Melbourne: Justin Langer made an unbeaten 181 as Australia recovered from a top-order collapse to reach 357 for eight on the opening day of the first Test against Pakistan in Perth on Thursday. 

Langer and wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist put on 152 runs in 166 balls for the sixth wicket after the home side had slumped to 78 for five shortly after lunch. 

The opener, playing at his home ground, batted for six-and-a-half hours, hitting 18 fours and three sixes during his 265-ball unbeaten knock. 

Yet, he was not satisfied. ?I can play a lot better than I did today,? the 34-year-old Langer said after the end of the day?s play. ?I feel really good physically and I?m sure that?s helping my game mentally as well. 

?Over the last few years my motivation hasn?t been runs as it has been getting better and better.? 

Langer is the leading scorer in Test cricket this year with 1,319 runs, including five centuries. It was the left-hander?s second consecutive Test century and the 21st of his 83-match career. 

Wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal missed a difficult leg-side chance off Mohammed Sami when Langer was on 13. 

Gilchrist, on the other hand was typically brutal, clubbing 10 boundaries in his 69 from 78 balls. 

The morning belonged to Pakistan, with their strike bowlers Shoaib Akhtar (four for 89) and Sami (two for 94) tearing through the hosts? formidable top order. 

But Shoaib could not dislodge Langer. ?He?s the guy who can take the match away,? Shoaib said. ?In any situation he?s very dangerous, very determined.? 

Inzamam-ul Haq had put Australia in on a quick and bouncy WACA pitch and the fiery Shoaib trapped Matthew Hayden lbw for four in the third over with the total on six. 

Captain Ricky Ponting made 25 in a 50-run partnership for the second wicket with Langer before he was bowled by Sami. 

Sami struck again in his next over, having Damien Martyn caught behind for one and Shoaib took his second wicket in the final over before lunch, bowling Darren Lehmann for 12 after the left-hander had exposed his leg stump. 

The only wicket to fall in the second session was that of Michael Clarke, caught at first slip by Inzamam off Shoaib for one. Gilchrist added only five runs to his tea score of 64 before he was bowled by Abdul Razzaq off an inside edge. 

His partnership with Langer echoed the pair?s feat against Pakistan in Hobart five years ago when the Western Australia duo put on 238 for the sixth wicket to lead Australia to a dramatic four-wicket win in the second Test. 

Shane Warne fell to Razzaq for 12 before Langer added 80 with Jason Gillespie. Shoaib, however, struck during the first over with the second new ball as Gillespie was caught behind for 24 at 333 for eight.

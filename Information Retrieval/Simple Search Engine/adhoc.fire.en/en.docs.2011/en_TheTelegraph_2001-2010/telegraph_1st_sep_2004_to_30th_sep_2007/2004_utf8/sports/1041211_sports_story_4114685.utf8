Lahore: India survived a scare before holding New Zealand 1-1 in their last league match and stayed in contention for a medal finish in the Champions Trophy hockey meet here on Friday. 

The draw took India?s tally to four points from five matches, which proved enough for a bronze-medal clash against arch-rivals Pakistan. The final would be played between The Netherlands and Spain, who downed Pakistan 3-0 earlier in the day. 

New Zealand, who had upset the Indians at the Athens Olympics, denying them a place in the top-six, came quite close to an encore, but failed to latch on to the chances. 

The New Zealanders had taken the lead through Darren Smith in the 57th minute, before India equalised when Arjun Halappa converted a penalty stroke five minutes later. 

India put their opposition under pressure after the halftime, with the scoreline reading 0-0, but they failed to convert. 

New Zealand forced three penalty corners in a span of five minutes and scored from the last one. David Kosoof?s low flick was defended by Devesh Chauhan, who replaced D?Souza in the first half after the young custodian pulled a hamstring. Smith was, however, at the right post to push it in behind the Indian goalie. 

India soon drew level when they earned a penalty stroke for an infringement inside the opposition circle and Halappa scored neatly by putting the ball to the top right of the net. 

Indian goalie Adrian D?Souza, who suffered a minor hamstring injury, is expected to be fit for the play-off against Pakistan, team sources said. 

Spain down Pak 3-0 

Lost opportunities returned to haunt Pakistan as Spain beat them 3-0 in a thrilling encounter to cruise to the Champions Trophy final here on Friday. The match, a virtual semi-final, saw the Spaniards to set the title clash with The Netherlands. The Spaniards took the honours after scoring through Alex Fabregas (47th), David Alegre (53rd) and Santiago Freixa (69th). 

Meanwhile, in what is possibly the biggest upset of the competition so far, Germany shocked Holland 4-3 on Friday, but their victory came too late as they failed to join the medal race. (PTI)

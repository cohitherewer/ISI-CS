BIPIN SHENOY

 Kunte (4.5) will now face Aleksej Alexandrov of Belarus 

Calcutta: Enamul Hossain?s dream run was halted by GM Abhijit Kunte of Indian Oil in the fifth round of the International Open Chess Tournament at Alekhine Chess Club, Gorky Sadan here Thursday. 

The Bangladeshi IM, who had beaten GM Ziaur Rahaman and GM Surya Sekhar Ganguly in the earlier rounds, went down rather tamely to Kunte in a same coloured bishop ending. 

Kunte obtained two connected passed pawns in the centre in the endgame which sealed Enamul?s fate. 

With the win, Kunte shot into sole with 4.5 points. Half-a-point behind him is top seed, GM Aleksej Alexandrov of Belarus. Kunte meets Alexandrov in a crucial sixth round game Friday. 

Alexandrov beat GM Alexander Fominyh of Russia on the second board. Alexandrov, playing white, opted to keep his king in the centre and opened up the h-file for an attack in a Grunfeld defence and went on to win in 33 moves. 

Untitled Saptarshi Roy of Goodricke National Chess Academy held GM Dibyendu Barua to a hard fought draw in bishop ending which arose from the Sicilian Dragon. 

Second seed, GM Ni Hua of China and GM Eshan Ghaem Maghami quickly drew their game in 18 moves to stay near the top. 

Surya drew with Ukranian GM Oleg Romanishin after a protracted battle. 

The veteran GM sacrificed his rook for bishop and two pawns which gave him an initiative, but Surya defended grittily to hold the position and drew in the extended time control. 

GM Sandipan Chanda obtained an excellent position with the black pieces against Dao Thien Hai of Vietnam in a semi-Slav defence. But he squandered his advantage and went into a completely lost bishop versus knight endgame. Dao Thien Hai, in turn blundered and allowed Sandipan to draw. 

Double GM norm holder IM D.V. Prasad went down tamely to Ziaur Rahaman in a mere 20 moves in a Reti opening. With the loss, Prasad?s norm prospects in this tournament looks bleak.

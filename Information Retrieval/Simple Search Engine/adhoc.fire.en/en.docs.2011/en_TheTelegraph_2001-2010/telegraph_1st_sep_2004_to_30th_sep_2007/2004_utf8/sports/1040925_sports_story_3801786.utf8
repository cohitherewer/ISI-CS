 Zaheer named in seniors? squad

 Major boost for Zaheer 

Mohali: Left-arm pacer Zaheer Khan received a major boost in his quest of returning to the Indian team when he was named in the 14-member squad for the four-day practice match ahead of the Test series against Australia next month. 

Zaheer, who proved his fitness and form with a three-wicket haul for Rest of India in Mumbai?s first innings in the Irani Trophy here, was included in the seniors? team on Friday that will take on India A in Bangalore from September 28 to October 1. 

Meanwhile, Bengal pacer Shib Shankar Paul found a berth in the India A squad following his outstanding show for Rest of India in the Irani Trophy tie against Mumbai. 

The selectors also picked three wicketkeepers ? Parthiv Patel, Dinesh Karthik and Mahendra Singh Dhoni -? for the match. 

Aakash Chopra would get a chance to regain his Test opening spot when he walks out with Virender Sehwag while Gautam Gambhir (Delhi) and Dheeraj Yadav (Mumbai) form the A team?s opening combination. 

Mohammad Kaif finds a place to stake his claims for a Test slot while Hemang Badani failed to make the cut.

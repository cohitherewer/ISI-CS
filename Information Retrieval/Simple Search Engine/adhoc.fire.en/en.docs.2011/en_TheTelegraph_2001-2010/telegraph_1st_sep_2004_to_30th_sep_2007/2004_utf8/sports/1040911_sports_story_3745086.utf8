 Brazil lift brief ban on players

Rio de Janeiro: Brazil have ended a brief ban on captain Cafu, midfielder Kaka and three other players for missing last month?s friendly in Haiti, coach Carlos Alberto Parreira said on Friday. 

The pair along with goalkeeper Dida, who all play for AC Milan, together with Bayern Munich duo Lucio and Ze Roberto will be considered when the squad is announced for next month?s World Cup qualifiers. Brazil are away to Venezuela on October 9 and face Colombia at home three days later. 

?They are all in conditions to be picked,? he said after returning from Wednesday?s friendly against Germany, which ended in a 1-1 draw.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Bhandari joining Team India today

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

Southampton: Lakshmipathy Balaji?s replacement, Amit Bhandari, is joining Team India on Tuesday afternoon. 

According to manager Goutam Das Gupta, Bhandari will be landing in London around noon and is then going to head straight for Birmingham. 

Barring captain Sourav Ganguly, Virender Sehwag, Ashish Nehra and Rohan Gavaskar, who took permission for a trip to London (from here), the rest of the touring party reached Birmingham on Monday itself. 

Sourav and Co. will be reporting back by late evening. 

Meanwhile, with the International Cricket Council (ICC) drawing the Board?s attention to ambush marketing by an Indian firm which has tied up with Sourav and Irfan Pathan, the duo has been asked to sort things out. 

?The Board has spoken to Sourav and Pathan and they?ve been told not to breach the agreement with the ICC... I understand the players have got in touch with the firm they are endorsing,? Das Gupta told The Telegraph. 

The ICC acted after a key commercial partner lodged a protest.

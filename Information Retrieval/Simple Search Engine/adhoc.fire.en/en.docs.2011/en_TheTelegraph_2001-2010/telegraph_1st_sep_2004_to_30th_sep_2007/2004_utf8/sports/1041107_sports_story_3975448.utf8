 I had to get out of Australia: Hewitt

 Paris proved the perfect escape for the Aussie 

Paris: Lleyton Hewitt admitted that Paris proved to be the perfect escape when his romance with Kim Clijsters hit the rocks last month. 

The Australian, who has steadfastly refused to comment on the split with the Belgian former world No. 1 whom he was planning to marry in February, temporarily let his guard down after being knocked out of the Paris Masters here on Friday. 

?I just had to get out of Australia, to tell you the truth,? said Hewitt after his 4-6, 6-7 (2-7) quarter final defeat to Russia?s Marat Safin. 

?That?s why I was in Paris early. I had nowhere left to practice so I thought I would come here. 

?But the courts weren?t laid at Bercy, so I was at Roland Garros for a week. Yeah, Paris is a nice place to be and tonight I am happy that my game went up a notch.? 

Hewitt also believes Paris can help him and his countrymen lead a tennis revival in Australia where leading players, with the exception of himself, are beginning to fall by the wayside. 

Only Hewitt, at No. 3, commands a place among the world?s top 80 with veteran Wayne Arthurs at 81, the declining Mark Philippoussis at 83 and the unproven Todd Reid at 98. 

Hewitt believes that the clay courts of Roland Garros could hold the key to nurturing the next generation and he has backed reported calls made by doubles specialist Todd Woodbridge for Australia to replace some synthetic grass courts with clay. 

?It?s something we need to do because even with the game that I have, I?m not a natural clay court player purely because I didn?t grow up on it,? said the 23-year-old. 

?I think it is lot easier for the good players to adjust if they are a clay court specialist, to adjust to playing hard courts and grass courts rather than vice versa. 

?I try my best, but I?m not quite there movement wise because I haven?t grown up on that surface. 

The movement on clay is different. I move like a hardcourt player.?

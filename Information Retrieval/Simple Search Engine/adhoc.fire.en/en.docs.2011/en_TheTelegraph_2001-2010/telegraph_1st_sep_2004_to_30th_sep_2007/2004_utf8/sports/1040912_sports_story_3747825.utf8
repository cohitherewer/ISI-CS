 Nisipeanu in lead, Sandipan loses

Pune: Top-seeded Grandmaster Liviu-Dieter Nisipeanu of Romania regained sole lead with a fine victory over out-of-form Grandmaster Emil Sutovsky of Israel in the eighth and penultimate round of category-16 Super Grandmasters chess tournament on Saturday. 

GM Abhijit Kunte finally struck form and scored his first victory in the event with a win over Sandipan Chanda. 

As things stand now, 1998 World Championship semi-finalist Nisipeanu looks set to add another feather to his cap as he took his tally to 5.5 points out of a possible 8. Half a point behind the leader was world champion Rustam Kasimdzhanov of Uzbekistan while P. Harikrishna was on the third spot on 4.5 points. 

Grandmasters Alexander Beliavsky of Slovenia, Zurab Azmaiparashvili of Georgia and Sandipan Chanda were next in line with 4 points each in their kitty while national champion Surya Sekhar Ganguly shared the seventh spot on 3.5 points along side Sutovsky. Sharing the ninth spot are Krishnan Sasikiran and Kunte who both have 3 points apiece. 

The last-round pairings are quite interesting but Nisipeanu looks a sure bet for his first title on the Indian soil. The Romanian is slated to play Kunte in his final game as white and a draw would assure him of at least a tie for the top spot.

 United launch investigation

 Ferguson feels the win over Arsenal will galvanise his team 

Manchester: Manchester United have launched an internal investigation into the tunnel fracas that followed their 2-0 defeat of Arsenal at Old Trafford. 

In the latest salvo in a war of words between English soccer?s biggest clubs, manager Alex Ferguson said he was ?very disappointed? by Arsenal?s response to Sunday?s events when, according to media reports, he was pelted with food. 

?We are doing our own thing,? Ferguson told a news conference on Friday. ?We have got our own investigation into it. We are collating a lot of information. A lot of statements have been made by witnesses and we will be forwarding it to the FA and letting them get on with it.? 

The Football Association (FA) said on Monday they would investigate events after United?s victory ended the champions? record 49-match unbeaten league run. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said on Tuesday he had not seen anything thrown at Ferguson. 

The only fall-out from United?s 2-0 victory has been the start of a three-match ban for striker Ruud van Nistelrooy for a foul on Arsenal defender Ashley Cole. ?Ruud would never try to hurt anybody. But it was a tackle that looked bad and Ruud accepts his responsibility and so do we,? Ferguson said. ?In the nature of football some things like that happen. It was a split-second thing. He accepts his responsibility and we kick on from that.? 

Ferguson expects his side to capitalise by closing the gap further. United play at Portsmouth on Saturday and Arsenal are at home to Southampton. ?I think our season can be galvanised with what happened last Sunday in terms of performance. So hopefully that kick-starts the season,? said Ferguson. 

?The only thing that matters to this club is winning the championship. Winning last week was a start for us because I feel our season has never really got underway.? (Reuters)

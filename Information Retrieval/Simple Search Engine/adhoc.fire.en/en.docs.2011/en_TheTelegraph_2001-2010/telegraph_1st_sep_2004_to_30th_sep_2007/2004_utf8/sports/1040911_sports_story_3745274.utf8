 Surya stuns Sasikiran

Pune: National champion Surya Sekhar Ganguly 

struck form yet again to defeat fellow-GM Krishnan Sasikiran in the seventh round 

of the category-16 Super Grandmasters section of the Pune International chess 

festival at Le Royale Residency Club here Friday. 

Since the day produced just one decisive game out 

of a possible five, the lead positions remained unchanged. 

For the record GM Liviu-Dieter Nisipeanu of Romania and world champion Rustam Kasimdzhanov of Uzbekistan continued to lead the 10-player field with 4.5 points out of seven games played so far. 

With just two more rounds remaining in the $ 10,000 prize money tournament, Indian GMs P. Harikishna and Sandipan Chanda remain on the heels of the leaders on four points. 

Emil Sutovsky of Israel is another half point behind the two Indians along with Alexander Beliavsky of Slovenia and Georgian Zurab Azmaiparashvili while Sasikiran was relegated to ninth spot with just 2.5 points, a half-point clear of Abhijit Kunte. Ganguly is at 3 points. 

It was not a very interesting game between two overnight leaders ? Nisipeanu and Kasimdzhanov. Obviously, taken aback at his loss to Harikrishna in the previous round, Nisipeanu did not try too hard with his white pieces after employing the Ruy Lopez. 

Kasimdzhanov had no trouble in securing the balance 

after routine manoeuvring and a draw appeared to be a just result after a few 

pieces changed hands.

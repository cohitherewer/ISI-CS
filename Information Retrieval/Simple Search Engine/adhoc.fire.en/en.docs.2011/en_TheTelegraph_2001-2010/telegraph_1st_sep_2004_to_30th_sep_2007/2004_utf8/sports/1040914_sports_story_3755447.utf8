The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Eves placed better: Anand

Mumbai: The Indian women?s team has a chance to win a medal than their male counterparts in the forthcoming Chess Olympiad, feels world rapid chess champion Viswanathan Anand. 

?We will be playing some top chess playing countries like Russia, Israel, Ukraine, USA and Armenia among others and it will be a tough task for us to win a medal,? Anand said on Monday. 

?Compared to the men?s team, probably the women has a chance of winning a medal as they not only have a very good team, but their opponents too are not as formidable as in the men?s field,? he added. (PTI)

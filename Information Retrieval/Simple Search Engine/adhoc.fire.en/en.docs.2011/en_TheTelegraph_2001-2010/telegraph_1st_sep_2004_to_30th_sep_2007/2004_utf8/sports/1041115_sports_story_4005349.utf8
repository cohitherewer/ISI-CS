Gurgaon: World No. 1 Vijai Singh of Fiji was relegated to third spot as Englishman Justine Rose won the second Bilts Skins golf championship here Sunday. 

The 24-year-old Rose, playing in his first-ever Skins event, was in terrific form as he won seven of the 18 holes to pocket $42,500. 

Singh, the defending champion, managed to win only three holes and had to be content with a third-place finish behind Swede Daniel Chopra, who won $35,000. The Fijian won $22,000. 

The fourth player in the fray, Todd Hamilton of the US, turned out to be a big disappointment as he failed to win a single hole. 

Rose was elated with his effort and said Saturday?s win was an icing on the cake after the fun he had in India. 

?I just made the most of what came my way. I got into a rhythm and hope I can do this week in and week out on the Tour.? 

The Englishman, currently ranked 69th in the world with four top ten finishes in the PGA Tour this year, said his dream was to win the US Masters atleast once. 

?I will be a sad man without a green jacket. That is what we all play for and work hard for,? he said. 

Singh praised Rose for his brilliant display at the DLF Golf and Country course. ?Justin played very well and deserved to win today,? he remarked. 

The 41-year-old said the Skins format was entertaining where the players go for a more aggressive style. It also provides more excitement to spectators. 

Meanwhile, Vijai is working on his pet project and is also open to the idea of building a golf course in India. 

?Yes, I am designing a golf course in Fiji. May be someday I may even design a golf course in India,? Vijai told reporters on Sunday. 

?I am not interested in just building a golf course but want to design a very good golf course with my experience as a player and leave a mark.? 

The 41-year-old has also started his own charity foundation in Florida, USA, to try and help out people from different walks of life. On his plans before the start of the next season , Vijai said he would now take a couple of days break before playing in Hawaii. 

?I?ll then go back home to prepare for the new season and back to my routine.?

 Boje withdraws

 Durban: Spinner Nicky Boje has withdrawn from 

 South Africa?s two-Test tour of India fearing detention 

 over match-fixing investigation, his lawyer Tony Irish said 

 on Wednesday. 

Left-arm spinner Boje, who was named vice-captain, had wanted assurance that he would not be detained by Delhi police. 

However, reports on Wednesday said South Africa?s acting high commissioner to India, Desmond Nxweni, had been unable to obtain such a commitment from Delhi police commissioner K.K. Paul. 

?We got confirmation today that there was going to be no guarantee or assurance given and Boje has made his decision,? Irish, who is also chief executive of the South African Cricketers? Association, said. 

Herschelle Gibbs, whom the police also wanted to question in connection with the investigation, made himself unavailable for selection. Boje and Gibbs were sent questionnaires by police last month. Boje answered all the questions and supplied police with a transcript of the evidence he gave to the King commission, South Africa had formed to investigate into match fixing. 

Gibbs complied with his lawyers? advice that he should not answer the questionnaire. 

Irish said the cricketer will not travel to India with the threat of detention hanging over him. 

?It?s sad, but it was on the cards,? Irish said. ?They have the right to investigate and he has co-operated fully with their investigation.?

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Sourav expected to leave today

 - NZ barrister Tim Castle is appeals commissioner 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Sourav Ganguly will, by Wednesday, 

put forward a full-fledged appeal before the International Cricket Council (ICC) 

elaborating the grounds on which time was lost, and not wasted, during the India-Pakistan 

match at Eden Gardens on Saturday. 

Sourav is going in appeal against Match Referee Clive 

Lloyd?s decision to ban him for two Tests on account of the team being five overs 

short. 

The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), 

meanwhile, is still awaiting a cassette of the Pakistan innings. Only after viewing 

it, can the BCCI perhaps advise Sourav to challenge just the 24 minutes of grace 

granted by Lloyd. 

The appeal, therefore, is only going to be signed and sent by Sourav once the cassette has been seen. 

This process, may delay Sourav?s departure for Kanpur where the first Test gets underway on Saturday. In case he doesn?t take a flight to Lucknow (en route to Kanpur) Wednesday afternoon, he will most probably head for New Delhi in the evening, before setting out for the venue of the first Test from there. 

Sourav?s appeal will be heard within the next seven days, the ICC said on Tuesday. New Zealand barrister Tim Castle has been appointed the appeals commissioner. The Indian captain will be eligible for the Test, if by the scheduled start, the appeals commissioner doesn?t finalise his ruling. 

Sourav and the BCCI received a copy of Lloyd?s chargesheet 

and his decision from the ICC Tuesday morning. Sourav?s intent to appeal, listing 

the grounds on which the appeal will be made, was sent to in-house lawyer Urvasi 

Naidoo Monday evening itself.

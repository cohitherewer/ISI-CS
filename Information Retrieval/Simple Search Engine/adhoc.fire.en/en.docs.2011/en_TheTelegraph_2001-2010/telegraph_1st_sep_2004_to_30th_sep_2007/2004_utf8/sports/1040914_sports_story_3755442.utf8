Madrid: Atletico Madrid joined Barcelona and Real Madrid as the only teams in the Primera Liga with 100 percent records after striker Fernando Torres helped them to a 2-0 win over Albacete on Sunday. 

The Spanish international gave Atletico the lead in the 85th minute with a fine opportunist strike and made a second for teammate Ariel Ibagaza on the stroke of fulltime after a dazzling individual run. 

The win means that after two games Atletico lead the fledgling table, level on six points with Barcelona and Real Madrid who maintained their perfect start to the season with victories over Sevilla and Numancia on Saturday. 

Earlier Deportivo Coruna slumped to a surprise 1-3 home defeat against Osasuna on Sunday after the visitors fought back from a goal down and a sending-off to claim their first Primera Liga win of the season. 

New signing Savo Milosevic weighed in with two classy strikes in the second half to give the Navarrans their first league victory at the Riazor and leave Deportivo with work to do before next week?s Champions League match against Olympiakos. 

Espanyol continued their fine start to the season thanks to an emphatic 4-1 win at out-of-sorts Real Betis with Argentine striker Maxi Rodriguez bagging a hat-trick. 

Deportivo took a 19th-minute lead at the Riazor when Uruguayan striker Walter Pandiani guided home a first-time shot from 15 metres after a poor clearance from the Osasuna defence. The visitors equalised early in the second half, when John Aloisi scored from the penalty spot after he had been pushed in the area. 

The Navarrans looked to have blown their chances when defender Jose Izquierdo was dismissed for picking up a second yellow card for an unnecessary foul on Pedro Munitis. 

The setback only spurred them into action, however, and they took the lead five minutes later when the unmarked Milosevic scored from the edge of the area after making a late run to meet a fine pass from midfielder Ludovic Delporte. The Serbia amp; Montenegro international striker clinched victory with a delightful second when he chipped the ball over Depor keeper Jose Molina from 18 metres to take his tally for the season to three. 

Meanwhile, Serie A title hopefuls Juventus and AS Roma made winning starts on Sunday, gaining an early advantage on rivals AC Milan and Inter who were held to draws on Saturday. Juventus enjoyed a comfortable 3-0 win at Brescia with goals from European Footballer of the Year Pavel Nedved, Frenchman David Trezeguet and Swedish striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic on his debut. 

Substitute Vincenzo Montella scored for Roma in their 1-0 victory over promoted Fiorentina. Fiorentina defender William Viali and Roma striker Antonio Cassano were sent off. 

Paolo Di Canio celebrated his return to Serie A after eight seasons in British football by scoring the penalty that gave Lazio a 1-0 win at Sampdoria.

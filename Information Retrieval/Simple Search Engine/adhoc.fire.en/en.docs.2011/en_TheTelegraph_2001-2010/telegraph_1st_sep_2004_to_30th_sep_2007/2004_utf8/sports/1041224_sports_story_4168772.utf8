Madrid: Real Madrid ended a miserable year on a miserable note when they lost 0-1 at home to Sevilla in the Primera Liga on Wednesday. 

Brazilian striker Julio Baptista produced a cool finish after 19 minutes, clipping the ball over the head of ?keeper Iker Casillas to inflict a second home defeat of the season on Real. 

It was Sevilla?s first league victory at the Bernabeu in 20 years and had it not been for some superb last-ditch saves from Casillas and some wasteful finishing by Sevilla?s forwards, the margin would have been much greater. 

Real, who ended last season a disappointing fourth, struggled to create any chances, although Ronaldo, who started the game on the bench, had a goal disallowed after coming on. 

?We gave a really poor image out there,? said Real coach Mariano Garcia Remon. ?It was a shame to close the year with a performance like this.? 

The result left Real, who substituted David Beckham at halftime and withdrew his England teammate Michael Owen late on, in fifth place, a distant 13 points behind leaders Barcelona who claimed a late 2-1 win over Levante on Tuesday. 

Barcelona lead the table on 42 points from 17 games, 10 ahead of reigning champions Valencia who moved into second place after their 3-0 win over nine-man Espanyol. Sevilla have 31 points with Espanyol on 30. 

Real, who have 29, have played a game less as they are still to complete the final six minutes of their match against Real Sociedad which was abandoned because of a bomb scare with the score at 1-1. 

It was a great evening for Basque sides Athletic Bilbao and Real Sociedad. 

Bilbao thrashed struggling Mallorca 4-0 at San Mames and Sociedad crushed troubled Malaga 5-1 away, strike-partners Darko Kovacevic and Nihat Kahveci grabbing two goals apiece. With their newly-appointed director of football Arrigo Sacchi looking on from the stands, Real made a promising enough start against Sevilla. 

But the home side faded rapidly and it was Sevilla who gained the upper hand, taking the lead with Baptista?s cool finish after he had outpaced Real centre back Walter Samuel to race on to a neat headed pass on the halfway line. 

The Andalucians had a string of chances to extend their lead before the break, but were unable to work their way past an inspired Casillas. 

Tricky Brazilian winger Daniel Alves sliced open the Real defence after a sharp one-two, but his shot was blocked by Casillas and the Real ?keeper produced another great stop a few minutes later to beat away a Carlitos effort.

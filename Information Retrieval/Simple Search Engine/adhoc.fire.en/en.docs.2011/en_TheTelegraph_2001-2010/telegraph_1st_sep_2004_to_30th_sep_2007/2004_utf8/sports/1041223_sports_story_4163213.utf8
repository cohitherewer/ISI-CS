 Mehra pulls off shock win

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Sanjeev Mehra pulled off his second straight upset with a 3 amp; 2 win over thrice Sri Lankan amateur Open winner Simarjeet Singh at the Goodricke Eastern India amateur championship at the Royal Calcutta Golf Club on Tuesday. The event is the second leg of the Eastern Swing on the Royal Challenge Indian Golf Tour. 

In the most exciting contest of the day, Keshav Misra recorded a win over Pankaj Sethi on the 23rd hole to cruise into a quarter final clash with Akshay Butta. 

HS Kang knocked out top-seed Ranjit Singh with a 4 amp; 2 win. At the half way stage Kang was one up and never relinquished his lead after that. Another closely contested match was between Joseph Chakola and Amardip Sinh Malik in which the former prevailed one-up. Teenager Akshay Butta who sent the seasoned Manav Das to the cleaners on Monday moved into the quarter finals along with Mehra and six others courtesy a 2 amp; 1 victory over Girish Virk. 

Mehra played the waiting game with Simarjeet, who has only himself to blame for the defeat with bogeys on the third, seventh and ninth. Sanjeev who bogeyed fewer holes, led the contest one-up after nine. Thereafter Mehra didn?t let up despite a double bogey on the 14th and Simar crumbled under the pressure.

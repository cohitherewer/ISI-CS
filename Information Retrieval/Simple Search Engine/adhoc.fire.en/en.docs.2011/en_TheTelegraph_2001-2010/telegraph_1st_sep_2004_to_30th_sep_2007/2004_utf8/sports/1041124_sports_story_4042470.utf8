The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Changes unlikely in squad

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Kanpur: Unless there?s a rethink, overnight, the Team India XIV will be retained for the second (and final) Test against South Africa, in Calcutta, from Sunday. 

?Right now, nobody is looking at any change,? one of the five selectors told The Telegraph on Tuesday evening. 

He added: ?Of course, there would have been a big debate had Gautam Gambhir failed, but his wonderful effort here has ensured he can?t be touched...? 

There has been some talk about bringing back Ajit Agarkar, but there hasn?t really been any ?movement? as such.

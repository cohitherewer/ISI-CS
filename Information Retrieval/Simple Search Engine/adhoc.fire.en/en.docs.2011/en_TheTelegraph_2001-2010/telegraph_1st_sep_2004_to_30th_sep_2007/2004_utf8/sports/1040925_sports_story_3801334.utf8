The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Tough draw for Bagan 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Mohun Bagan seem to have a tough draw in the 110th edition of the IFA Shield, kicking off on Thursday. The defending champions are in group A with two foreign outfits ? Myanmar Finance and Revenue Football Club, and Renown Sports Club of Sri Lanka. 

The other group consists of East Bengal, Mohammedan Sporting and Bangladesh?s Muktijoddha Samsad Krirachakra. 

While the Myanmar team boasts nine national players in their ranks, Renown Sports Club is coached by a Brazilian and have three foreigners. 

Two teams from each group will make it to the semi-final stage. 

Announcing this at a press conference on Friday, the IFA secretary Subrata Dutta said that the teams have been chosen to make the meet a club championship in the sub-continent. 

He informed Iraq?s top-flight club, Al Talaba, could not be accommodated because of their late confirmation while participation of a DPR Korea team was deemed costly. 

Dutta claimed giant screens would debut at the Salt Lake Stadium (all matches of the Shield will feature this, except the East Bengal-Mohammedan Sporting tie at the Kalyani Stadium) during the meet. ?We are arranging four giant screens to give the matches an international feel,? he said. 

Three will be Zico?s autograph on the reverse side of each ticket, along with his message ? ?One and all love football?.

Sept. 30: Mohun Bagan vs Myanmar FRFC; Oct. 1: East Bengal vs Md. Sporting; Oct. 2: Mohun Bagan vs Renown SC; Oct. 3: East Bengal vs Muktijoddha; Oct. 4: Renown SC vs Myanmar FRFC; Oct. 5: Md. Sporting vs Muktijoddha. Oct. 7-8: Semi-finals; Oct. 10: Final.

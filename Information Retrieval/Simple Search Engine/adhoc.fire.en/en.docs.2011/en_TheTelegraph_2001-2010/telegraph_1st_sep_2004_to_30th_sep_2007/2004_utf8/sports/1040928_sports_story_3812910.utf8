 2 new faces in Pak squad

Karachi: Pakistan selectors have named two new players in a 15-member squad for the one-day tri-series against Zimbabwe and Sri Lanka from Thursday. 

One of the new faces, batsman Bazid Khan, is the son of former Test captain Majid Khan, who after 63 Tests and 23 one-day International appearances also remained chief executive of the Pakistan board and served on the national selection committee. 

The other uncapped player is Rao Iftikhar, a promising pace bowler, who performed well recently for the ?A? team on a tour of Kenya. 

The selectors have dropped opener Imran Farhat and allrounder Azhar Mahmood from the Pakistan squad that recently played in the ICC Champions Trophy in England. 

THE SQUAD 

Inzamam-ul-Haq (captain), Yousuf Youhana, Younis Khan, Yasir Hameed, Shahid Afridi, Misbah-ul-Haq, Shoaib Malik, Abdul Razzaq, Moin Khan, Salman Butt, Bazid Khan, Iftikhar Rao, Rana Naved-ul-Hasan, Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Sami. 

Dilhara back 

Meanwhile, Sri Lanka have dropped paceman Lasith Malinga in favour of the more experienced Dilhara Fernando for their triangular series starting in Pakistan this week. 

Left-arm spinner Rangana Herath has been called up as a third specialist spinner in support of leg-spinners Upul Chandana and Kaushal Lokuarachchi for the series which will also feature Zimbabwe. 

THE SQUAD

Lahore: The young Indian hockey team prepare to launch their Champions Trophy offensive here, with the aim of putting behind them the sheer disappointment of the Athens Olympic Games. Starting Saturday, it will be the Indians? endeavour to make the best of this elite tournament. 

A seventh-place finish in Athens must still be rankling in the minds of hockey lovers and this six-nation tourney is a big test, especially because the country was handed an invitation on a platter, Australia having cried out citing security concerns. 

However, if the performance of the inexperienced players in the recent eight-match Test series vs Pakistan and the just-concluded two-match series vs Spain is any indication, India might be able to equal their best-ever performance in the meet. 

India had finished third in 1982, in Amstelveen. This is a difficult proposition, though not an impossible target. ?This is a tough tournament, and we have a young side, but that is not going to keep us down. We are going to give it our best shot,? captain Dilip Tirkey said on the eve of India?s match against Olympic semi-finalists Spain. 

India go out to collect full points from the opener in this round-robin meet. Things will get more difficult, with India meeting defending champions Holland Sunday, Germany Tuesday, arch-rivals and hosts Pakistan Wednesday and New Zealand Friday. 

Indian chief coach Gerhard Rach appeared quite confident of his boys? abilities and said he has had ?some very good preparation?. ?We know what our position is and have prepared really hard. I have given it my best try since I had almost four months to prepare for the event,? Rach said. 

Rach agreed that a win Saturday over Spain, who tied the two-match series with India 1-1, would give a huge boost to the confidence of the players. ?Spain are a very good side. They have made some changes after the Olympics, but retained the core of the team. We, on the other hand, have a new forward line and some inexperienced players. But I can say we have a better forward line than before.? 

India will be relying heavily on their captain and seniormost player Tirkey for inspiration. Tirkey, who was troubled by an injury during the Test series vs Spain, has so far led the team by example. 

Tirkey?s statemate William Xalco will assist captain in manning Indian defence, along with Harpal Singh and Sandeep Singh who doubles up as drag-flicker. 

The midfield will be boosted by the complete recovery from a hamstring injury of Vikram Pillay. The Pune-based player will have Viren Rasquinha and Ignace Tirkey for company. 

And the attack will be the responsibility of Arjun Halappa, Sandeep Michael, Tushar Khandekar, V. S. Vinay, Adam Sinclair and Vivek Gupta. 

The goalkeeping position would be a toss-up between Adrian D?Souza, who has excelled under the bar since making his debut earlier this year, and the experienced Devesh Chauhan, who showed glimpses of his class in the Test series against Spain after playing second fiddle to his junior for almost six months. 

Spain, who struggled in the test series, would be keen to pull up their socks before it is too late. The team has come to the competition with full preparation and coach Maurits Hendriks will not let go of this opportunity to prove to the world the might of his boys. 

The side banks heavily on Santiago Freixa and Ramon Alegre, besides the experience of captain Juan Escarre. 

Hogging the meet limelight, though, will be Holland. They will complete a hattrick of titles if they win this edition. 

Coach Terry Walsh, set to join his Australian team after this tournament, must be keen to sign off from his position on a bright note.

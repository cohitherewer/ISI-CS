 Hitesh Modi to lead Kenya

Nairobi: Kenyan selectors named Hitesh Modi as the new captain to lead the relatively young team in the three-day ICC Intercontinental Cup qualifying match against Namibia. 

Modi is one of five senior players in the squad named on Wednesday night after the country?s leading players boycotted training following a row over contracts.

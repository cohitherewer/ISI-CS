London: Yet another Champions Trophy match was called off for the day because of rain. The South Africa-West Indies game at The Oval will resume on Sunday, with the West Indies 20 without loss, chasing 247. 

Earlier, Herschelle Gibbs repaid the faith of the South African selectors by hitting 101. Gibbs? 135-ball innings included nine fours and a six as he helped South Africa to 246 for six. Jacques Rudolph provided some clean-hitting making 46 from 39 balls with four fours and a six before he was bowled by the impressive Chris Gayle with four overs left and a steady fall of wickets stemmed the flow of runs. 

Gayle was the pick of the West Indian bowlers taking three for 50 and Ian Bradshaw picked up two for 40. 

Opener Gibbs has been in desperate run of form scoring just 93 runs in his last six one-day Internationals and averaging a modest 20.8 in 32 games since the 2003 World Cup. 

But coach Eric Simons resisted calls to drop the 30-year-old down the order and he responded with a well-paced innings that yielded his 13th one-day century. 

He reached three figures with a straight six off Gayle but was out two balls later attempting to repeat the shot when Dwayne Bravo took a superb overhead catch at long-off. 

With Graeme Smith, Gibbs put on 102 for the first wicket before Smith was bowled attempting to cut the gentle spin of Gayle in the 23rd over.

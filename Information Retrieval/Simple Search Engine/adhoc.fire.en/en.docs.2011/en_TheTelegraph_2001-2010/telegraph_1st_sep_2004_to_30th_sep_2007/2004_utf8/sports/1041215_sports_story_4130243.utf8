 Bomb threat raises security concerns

 Florentino Perez 

Madrid: Spanish authorities won praise for clearing Santiago Bernabeu Stadium in just minutes after receiving a bomb threat, but Real Madrid president said it set a bad precedent to suspend the match mid-game. 

Sunday?s threat, allegedly from Basque separatists, proved a hoax and the conclusion of the match between Real Madrid and Real Sociedad has been rescheduled for January 5, the Spanish soccer federation said on Monday. 

But ?what happened is a very bad precedent,? Real Madrid club president Florentino Perez said afterward. ?It?s scary that this sort of thing might become a trend.? 

The hoax highlighted the issue of security at major sports venues such as Real?s home stadium, where few fans are searched on their way in. With just seven minutes of official time remaining, referee Lizondo Cortes halted the game. 

Officials urged spectators to remain calm and asked them to evacuate, and the 70,000 spectators were out within 10 minutes. 

The rapid evacuation of spectators could boost Madrid?s Olympic bid as it shows the city is able to deal with difficult security situations, officials said. (Agencies)

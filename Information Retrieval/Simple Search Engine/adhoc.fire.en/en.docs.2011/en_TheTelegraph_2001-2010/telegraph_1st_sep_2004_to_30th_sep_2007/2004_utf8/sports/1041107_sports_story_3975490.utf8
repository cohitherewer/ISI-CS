London: Dutch winger Arjen Robben scored his second matchwinner of the week as Chelsea beat Everton 1-0 to go three points clear at the top of the Premier League on Saturday. 

Robben, who found the net in Tuesday?s 1-0 Champions League win at CSKA Moscow, scored in the 72nd minute at Stamford Bridge after Chelsea took full advantage of a late kick-off for defending champions Arsenal at Crystal Palace. The Gunners, who held an edge over Chelsea on goal difference prior to Saturday?s game, can regain their lead if they win. 

Liverpool lost 0-1 at home to Birmingham City, Aston Villa trounced Portsmouth 3-0 and Norwich City were denied a first win of the season after conceding an 86th minute equaliser in their 1-1 draw with 10-man Blackburn Rovers. 

There was more bad news though for Tottenham Hotspur, a day after the sudden resignation of French coach Jacques Santini. They lost 2-3 at home to Charlton Athletic, whose South African striker Shaun Bartlett got two goals and a red card. (Reuters)

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Time to stop treating Becks as special

 - The England captain enjoys the endless patronage of a manager who is drawn to the star?s billboard world 

 PAUL HAYWARD 

The impressionable youth of Azerbaijan will be distraught to learn that the David Beckham show is not coming to town this week. One thing that can be said without fear of contradiction about the England captain is that he never does anything by halves. In showbiz, a sore throat is often enough to justify a refund. Beckham can point to a cracked rib and a suspension as the reasons for his non-appearance in Baku. 

We shouldn?t be talking about Beckham Sunday because he will play no part in England?s next World Cup qualifier, in a country that squeezes up against Iran, Russia, Georgia, Armenia and Turkey. 

The stylish Lowry Hotel in Manchester was Beckham?s jumping off point for the trip to Transcaucasia. With his hairline fracture, and his automatic ban from Fifa, Beckham dined with the England players on Saturday night and braced himself for something potentially more damaging than Wales?s left-back, Ben Thatcher, who put England?s leader out of the game for six weeks by standing his ground in the first of their crazy clashes. 

?Becks Beds Pal of Posh,? spouted the front-page headline in the Sunday Mirror and ?Broken Becks?, yelped the back. Again, nothing by halves. To colonise the front and back doors into the surreal world of celebrity chatter has become a Beckham speciality. 

With United, England and Real Madrid, there is one aspect of Beckham?s obsession with agenda-setting and limelight-grabbing that stands out. It is his belief that he can get away with being a Special Case. At United, his efforts to cultivate his position as across-over mega-star with ambitions to conquer America ran into the formidable obstacle of Sir Alex Ferguson. 

In Madrid, meanwhile, there were mutterings in the summer when Beckham tried to blame his lack of sharpness at Euro 2004 on his training regimen in Spain. 

The club struck back. But with England, he enjoys the endless patronage of a manager who is drawn, against his better instincts, to the billboard world where Beckham has chosen to live out his days. Portugal, last summer, proved it. 

Portugal?s Luis Figo played badly in one game and was hauled off. Beckham was ineffective in several, but stayed on. Had Eriksson applied the Figo Principle, as it should now be called, to his own ?Galactico?, he would have reaffirmed that England area meritocracy rather than a personal showcase. Which brings us back to the two collisions with Thatcher. 

The first 50-50 crash was an object lesson in needless risk-taking. Beckham runs in, jumps at the last minute in that slightly skittish way of his, and Thatcher?s arm and elbow come up with sufficient rigidity to crack one of his assailant?s ribs. 

Beckham goes down in pain, and Thatcher stands there undamaged. Lesson one: don?t rampage after the ball in unthreatening positions. If you do, choose your opponent wisely, and don?t then jump to surrender the initiative in the subsequent crunch of bodies. 

Lesson two: having cracked a bone, don?t then go in search of revenge, arrive late, lose the second confrontation as well, risk aggravating the injury and then get booked. This is where it gets interesting ? the point, in all detective shows, where motive becomes part of the equation.

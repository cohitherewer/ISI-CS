Madrid: A lacklustre Real Madrid lost further ground to Barcelona at the top of the table when they were held to a 0-0 draw at Villarreal in the Primera Liga on Sunday. 

The home side, who had lost their previous three league games, dominated the encounter against Real who appeared to have their minds on next week?s decisive Champions League clash against AS Roma. The result means that Real are now nine points behind Barcelona, easy 4-0 winners over Malaga on Saturday, and level with Espanyol, who claimed a valuable 1-0 victory away to Real Zaragoza earlier on Sunday. Espanyol striker Raul Tamudo marked his return from a month-long injury lay-off by scoring the winner on the half hour when he clipped in on the half-volley after controlling a fine cross from fellow forward Dani. 

Last season?s champions Valencia are a further point behind in fourth after a flattering 1-0 win at Albacete on Saturday. Sevilla bounced back from their 1-4 defeat at Osasuna last week and moved into fifth place when they continued their fine run of form at home with a 2-0 win over Athletic Bilbao. 

Deportivo Coruna hung on to their eight-year unbeaten record at Racing Santander by the skin of their teeth when a last-gasp strike from Uruguayan centre-forward Walter Pandiani earned them a 2-2 draw. Real Madrid headed to Villarreal without a string of first-choice players as they kept one eye on Wednesday?s match against Roma. 

Zinedine Zidane remained in Madrid to receive treatment on a back injury. Raul and Roberto Carlos spent the game on the bench. 

Swedish striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic grabbed a 75th minute winner as Serie A leaders Juventus came from behind to beat Lazio 2-1 at the Delle Alpi stadium, adds a report from Milan. 

The win keeps Juventus four points ahead of second placed AC Milan who on Saturday also came from a goal down to win 2-1 at Parma. 

Lazio took the lead in the 10th minute through Macedonian Goran Pandev but Uruguayan Ruben Olivera equalised five minutes before the break before Ibrahimovic gave Juventus their 11th win of the season. 

Former Italy international Gianfranco Zola scored twice for fourth-placed Cagliari, who beat Chievo Verona 4-2 in Sardinia. AS Roma?s Francesco Totti equalled Roberto Pruzzo?s club record of 106 Serie A goals with an 84th minute equaliser from the penalty spot in 1-1 draw at home to Sampdoria. (Reuters)

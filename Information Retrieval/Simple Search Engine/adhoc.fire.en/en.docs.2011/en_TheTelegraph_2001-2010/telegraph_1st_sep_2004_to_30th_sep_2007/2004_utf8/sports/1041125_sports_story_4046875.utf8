 Bengal aim for 2 points

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Bengal aim to book two points first before trying for an outright victory against Gujarat in their third Ranji Trophy Elite Group match in Siliguri on Thursday. Coach Karsan Ghavri is worried about the form of his batsmen. 

?I had a chat with the batsmen before this match as none, apart from Arindam Das, looked in proper shape,? Ghavri said. According to the coach, captain Rohan Gavaskar, Devang Gandhi, Nikhil Haldipur will have to take charge. 

According to a source, Shib Shankar Paul will come in for Sabir Ali. Paul was unavailable against Railways because of his Board President?s engagement. In case Bengal decide to play three spinners, offie Ritam Kundu will get a look in at the expense of Nikhil Haldipur. 

According to the coach the wicket is likely to take turn from the third day. 

The likely team 

Arindam Das, Nikhil Haldipur/Ritam Kundu, Devang Gandhi, Deep Dasgupta, Rohan Gavaskar, Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Sanjib Sanyal, Sourashish Lahiri, Murtaza Lodhgar, Ranadeb Bose, Shib Shankar Paul.

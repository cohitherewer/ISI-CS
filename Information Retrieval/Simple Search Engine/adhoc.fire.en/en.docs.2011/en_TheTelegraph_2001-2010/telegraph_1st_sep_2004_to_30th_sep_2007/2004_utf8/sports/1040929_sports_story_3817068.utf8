 Mumbai promise a tough fight

 Sachin to give pep-talk on match-eve 

Mumbai: Sachin Tendulkar has promised to give a pep-talk to his Mumbai teammates on Wednesday, ahead of their three-day clash against the visiting Australian cricket team starting on Thursday. 

?I have requested Sachin (Tendulkar) to come and have a word with our boys and he?s promised to meet them on Wednesday,? Mumbai coach Chandrakant Pandit said after a practice session at the Brabourne Stadium on Tuesday. 

Tendulkar, suffering from a tennis elbow, is uncertain to play in the first Test. He has also been officially ruled out of the opening tour match, informed Mumbai Cricket Association?s joint secretary Lalchand Rajput on Tuesday. Pandit said the entire team was looking forward to Tendulkar?s visit before the match. 

The Ranji Trophy champions, who crashed to a heavy defeat in the season-opener Irani Trophy clash against Rest of India at Mohali, would put their best foot forward against the Aussies, he said. ?We did not play well in Mohali. It was our first match after a long gap. Our batting failed, but I am sure we will do better and give the Australians a tough fight. I have also some tricks up my sleeves, some surprises,? the former India wicketkeeper said. 

Mumbai captain Sairaj Bahutule described the match as a big moment for his side and said it provided an opportunity for his team members to make a mark against the Australians. It?s a huge opportunity, not only for me but all my teammates. We will be playing against one of the top teams. All of us are looking forward to it,? said Bahutule. 

Bahutule, a member of the Mumbai team that took on the Aussies in 1997-98 and 2000-01 here at home, said he did not regret that his career had run parallel to that of Anil Kumble. 

?I have no regrets. He?s a great bowler and I have learnt a lot from Kumble,? the leg-spinner said. 

Bahutule said his interaction with Shane Warne in 2001 at Chennai had been very useful. 

?I interacted with Shane after the Chennai test. He gave me tips on how to grip the ball in a variety of ways, how to use the crease to my advantage and also variations in bowling. It helped me improve as a bowler,? he said.?From Anil (Kumble) I learned the virtues of line and length. From Warne, who?s a more orthodox bowler, I got lessons on variations,? he added. 

MUMBAI SQUAD: Sairaj Bahutule (captain), Vinod Kambli (vice-captain), Ajit Agarkar, Vinayak Mane, Wasim Jaffer, Bhavin Thakkar, Amol Muzumdar, Vinayak Samant (wicketkeeper), Vinit Indulkar, Ramesh Powar, Avishkar Salvi, Swapnil Hazare, Nilesh Kulkarni, Robin Morris, Santosh Shinde, Rohit Sharma.

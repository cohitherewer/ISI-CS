The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Dinesh Karthik: I?m not short on self-belief

 - ?The more relaxed I am, the better I?m going to keep?

Southampton: Nineteen-year-old Dinesh Karthik is new to Team India, but has the chance to go some distance at least in the ODIs ? where Test cricket is concerned, he will have to excel in every limited-overs outing if Parthiv Patel is to be ?pushed?. A student of engineering (he has enrolled for a correspondence course with Allahabad Agricultural University), Karthik spoke to The Telegraph in neighbouring Portsmouth on Friday evening. 

The following are excerpts 

On taking to the big gloves instead of either becoming a specialist batsman or bowler 

Happened by chance, when I was 12 or so... I was to play for my academy but, that day, the regular ?keeper didn?t turn up. The big gloves, then, came to me and I quite enjoyed the experience. It has been fun since. 

On the biggest influence 

My parents, Padmini and Krishna Kumar... My father, of course, is currently in Bahrain as a project leader, but I?m very close to mom... In fact, I make it a point to talk to her twice a day. 

On his idol 

Adam Gilchrist... He?s not only a very good ?keeper, but such an outstanding batsman ? an opener in ODIs, late in the order in Tests... The way he bats is, well, mind-blowing... We?re in the same hotel (in Portsmouth) and, hopefully, I?m going to have a chance to chat with him. 

On being a gifted batsman himself 

(Smiles) I see myself as a wicketkeeper-batsman, not the other way... Usually, I bat at No.6. 

On whether he has admired an Indian ?keeper 

Syed Kirmani... I?ve just watched cassettes of his, though. 

On whether he has interacted with any former India ?keeper 

The other day, I spoke to Farokh Engineer and he said I could call him whenever I wanted to. Made me feel nice. 

On whether he was optimistic about being picked for Team India 

Knew I had a chance... I was on the field, ?keeping (in Zimbabwe), when I got selected... I came to know when our (India A) coach, Sandeep Patil, flashed the thumbs-up from the dressing room... 

On his ODI debut at Lord?s, last Sunday 

Wasn?t nervous... Tried to relax and wanted to enjoy myself... In the build-up too, I didn?t think a lot about having to do well... I didn?t put myself under more pressure than is inevitable. 

On the brilliant stumping of England captain Michael Vaughan 

(Laughs) Felt great... It was a thrilling moment... 

On the pressure of playing for India 

It will be there... It?s best, then, that I relax and focus on the basics instead of trying to get very anxious. I?m not short on self-belief. 

On hobbies 

I read books, watch a lot of TV and listen to music... When in Chennai, I see quite a few Tamil films... (After a pause) Actually, the TV helps me relax. 

On his interest in other sport 

I follow men?s tennis and I?m a big fan of Roger Federer... I reckon he?s on his way to becoming one of the greatest of all time. 

On whether he is religious/superstitous 

I?m not into plenty of prayers, but I?m religious in my own way... Where superstitions go, I put on the right pad first. 

Finally, on the future 

Before anything else, I must first consolidate my position in the one-day team... The more relaxed I am, the better I?m going to keep.

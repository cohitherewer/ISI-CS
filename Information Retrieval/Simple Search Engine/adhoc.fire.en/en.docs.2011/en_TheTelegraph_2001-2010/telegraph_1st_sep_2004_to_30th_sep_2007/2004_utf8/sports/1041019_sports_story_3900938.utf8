The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Sourav bats for Parthiv

 - I?m hoping to learn from mistakes: Team India ?keeper 

 INDRANIL MAJUMDAR 

 Parthiv insists he?s mentally too strong to be affected by criticism 

Chennai: Anil Kumble had openly come out in support of Parthiv Patel last evening and, on Monday, captain Sourav Ganguly reiterated his backing for the young wicketkeeper. Parthiv, who was retained in the squad for the Nagpur Test, has been in the firing line after a string of misses during the second game. 

?He?s just had a poor game. I?ve seen him keep much better. It will be unfair to judge him on the basis of just one match. I have full faith in his abilities,? the Team India captain said after the selection committee meeting. 

According to sources, Parthiv?s performance was discussed at the meeting and it was agreed that though he needed to pull his socks up, it would be wise to give him another chance. His superb 54 in the first innings here also went a long way in helping him retain his place. 

?You can?t just chop and change after two games. Anyone can have a bad day, a bad match. Even Adam Gilchrist dropped chances. So it happens even to the very best,? Sourav added. 

He also informed that both Kumble and Harbhajan Singh (of whom the maximum chances were squandered) were very supportive of Parthiv. ?Both the spinners wanted to give him another chance,? Sourav said. 

Coach John Wright spent a good 30 minutes talking to him and sorting out a few technical flaws during the final day. Selection committee chairman Kiran More has also been helping him out. 

Parthiv admitted it was tough keeping on the Chepauk wicket. ?It wasn?t easy keeping here. The ball was bouncing and coming off the rough. Anticipating the ball was very difficult,? Parthiv told The Telegraph at the Taj Coromandal. 

?I?ve kept wickets on this sort of turning surface before. But anyone can have a bad match. I know I?ve dropped 10/12 catches and realise its importance. I?m hoping to learn from mistakes,? he remarked. 

Parthiv felt that this performance will not affect him in the coming matches. ?It won?t have any impact since I know my capabilities and am confident of it. I?m mentally too strong to get affected by criticism.? 

Strong words from the youngster and he would do well to remember what Gilchrist had to say on his missed chances. ?The catch I dropped off Sourav the other day proved to be very costly. But this is not the first catch I?ve dropped and I guarantee you it will also not be the last one either,? the Australian stand-in captain said.

 No bad blood between teams: Buchanan

 - Walking puts pressure on the umpires, says Steve Bucknor 

 Adam Gilchrist has stirred up a controversy 

Melbourne: Wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist?s belief that batsmen should walk when they know they are out has not created a rift between New Zealand and their hosts, Australia coach John Buchanan said on Tuesday. 

?We?re playing Test cricket out there,? Buchanan said on Tuesday before Friday?s second and final Test in Adelaide. ?There is a lot of emotion that goes into those games from both sides and I think that?s important to actually see. So in terms of bad blood, I wouldn?t suggest there is any.? 

Gilchrist and New Zealand batsman Craig McMillan were involved in a heated exchange during the first Test in Brisbane on Sunday, which Australia won by an innings and 156 runs. 

Vice-captain Gilchrist claimed a catch off McMillan but the allrounder stood his ground and was given not out. The pair briefly argued before the umpires intervened. 

The debate on whether to walk was unfair on Gilchrist, Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland said. Sutherland contacted Gilchrist on Tuesday to offer his support. 

?The banter that happens on the field in respect to umpiring decisions between players is something that?s always happened and I think people have tried to draw a link between that walking issue and that banter in a way that?s not necessarily appropriate,? Sutherland said. 

?In terms of drawing Adam into it, I think that?s unfortunate and unfair on him. He makes a choice on the way he wants to deal with the situation when he?s batting and he should be free to make that decision just as someone should be free to make the decision that they don?t walk.? 

Senior Australian batsman Darren Lehmann said Gilchrist?s teammates had offered support to him. Lehmann said the media had blown the incident out of proportion. 

?He?s a pretty strong character, Adam, a very strong character, so he?s got no problems. We have certainly spoken to him about it,? Lehmann said. 

New Zealand coach John Bracewell echoed Sunday?s comments by Australia captain Ricky Ponting, telling reporters to move on to more important topics. ?Some people walk and some people don?t. So it?s a non-issue,? Bracewell said. ?In fact, I think it?s just a line filler to be honest.? 

Meanwhile, the debate over walking is putting additional pressure on the match officials as some players might do it more for future gain than because their conscience gets the better of them, West Indies umpire Steve Bucknor said. 

Bucknor, who conceded his not out verdict in the McMillan instance was wrong, said walking complicated his job because different players had different motives. 

?With walkers, I think umpires should make their decision when they see it,? Bucknor was quoted saying in Tuesday?s Sydney Morning Herald. ?If a fella is a walker and his conscience is saying to him that he is going to play fair, that?s up to him. (but) it puts pressure on the umpires, yes.? 

Bucknor told the newspaper that other batsmen might choose to walk only after they had scored some runs. 

?Sometimes a batsman will only walk because he has already passed 100 ... Knowing that he wouldn?t walk when he was on zero. I have heard batsmen say, ?you owe me one? to umpires because they walked on a big score when the umpire was not going to rule them out. 

Bucknor asked for more technology to assist umpires. 

?We should be allowed a little more use of technology as umpires in making whatever decisions,? Bucknor said. ?Sometimes...it is hard to hear nicks. Stump microphones could maybe assist us more.? 

 Lehmann not to quit 

Lehmann should play in front of his home crowd in Adelaide despite failing in the first Test and dismissed rumours of his retirement on Tuesday, targeting a place on next year?s Ashes tour of England. 

?I heard that (rumour) but I?m definitely not retiring,? he said. ?I have never been on one and it?s something every cricketer aspires to, so I?d love to be on an Ashes tour.? (Agencies)

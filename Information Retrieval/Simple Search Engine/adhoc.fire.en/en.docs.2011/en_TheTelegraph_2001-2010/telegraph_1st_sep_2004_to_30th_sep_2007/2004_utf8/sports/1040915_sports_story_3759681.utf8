 MRF poised for victory

Hyderabad: MRF look all set to lift the Moin-ud-Dowla Gold Cup. Needing 134 runs for an outright victory against Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB), MRF reached 58 for two at stumps here on Tuesday, requiring another 76 runs. 

After taking a 32-run first innings lead, MRF bowled out CAB for 165, left arm seamer Zaheer Khan and S. Sriram claiming three wickets apiece on the penultimate day. 

Bengal, whose innings lasted 63.5 overs, had a shaky start, losing five wickets for 79 runs, before Sanjib Sanyal and Manoj Tiwari put up some resistance, adding 44 runs for the seventh wicket. 

Sanyal was run out for 39, while Subhomoy Das chipped in with 23. 

MRF?s second innings started with a flourish as opener Aashish Kapoor fired on all cylinders, scoring a swashbuckling 38 off 30 balls with the help of eight hits to the fence, before giving a return catch to spinner Sourashis Lahiri. 

Opener T. R. Arasu (15) followed soon after, Sanyal picking his wicket. J. Harish on three and S. Sriram on two were at the crease when the stumps were drawn.

 Das, Shukla rescue Bengal

 - Pagnis (89) top-scorer for Railways 

 Das scored an unbeaten 60 

New Delhi: A century partnership between opener Arindam Das and allrounder Laxmi Ratan Shukla helped Bengal salvage a draw against Railways in the Ranji Trophy Elite group A match here Friday. 

Chasing 311 for victory after the hosts declared their second innings at 216 for six, Bengal found themselves in trouble at 100 for four before tea on the fourth and final day at the Karnail Singh Stadium. 

Das and Shukla then added 102 runs for the fifth wicket to save the visitors. Das remained unbeaten on a patient 60 from 241 balls, while Shukla scored 65 in 95 balls with 10 fours and a six as the visitors finished at 212 for five before bad light forced an early close. 

Railways seamers bowled a probing line with Harvinder Singh two for 64 providing the early breakthrough as he had Nikhil Haldipur (4) caught by J.P. Yadav. 

From one for six, Bengal were soon 48 for three as Deep Dasgupta and Rohan Gavaskar were sent back to the pavilion. However, Devang Gandhi (25) combined with Das to add a valuable 52 runs for the fourth wicket. 

Earlier, Amit Pagnis top scored with 89 for Railways, who declared an hour into the morning session.

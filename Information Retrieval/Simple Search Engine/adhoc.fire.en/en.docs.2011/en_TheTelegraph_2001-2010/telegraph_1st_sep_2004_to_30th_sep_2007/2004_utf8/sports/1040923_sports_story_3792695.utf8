 Lone punter wins jackpot 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: It was a day of long knives at the RCTC on Wednesday. With none of the six favourites on the cards coming good, a lone punter scooped the jackpot pool amounting to Rs 87,650. To add to punters? woes, the weather remained cloudy and occasional showers in the afternoon left the race track soggy and slippery.

 Failure of trainer Daniel David?s favourites caused the maximum damage to the punters? cause. His Royal Charmer in the opener, the Maid Of Athens Handicap, attracted a big support only to let down as he burst blood vessels when pressed for effort by jockey B. Gurang. Less fancied Angelica, from Bharath Singh?s yard won the race.

 Daniel?s Shimmering River brought about a bigger upset while her stable?s Amazing Blaze attracted betting in the Ridicular Handicap. 

 Tagged For Terror, another of heavily wagered Daniel-runner in the feature event, the Mica Empress Cup, lost a close battle to Vijay Singh?s Callisto and Way To The Starts after the 2-1 favourite looked like ending the drought.

 Bharath?s Shining Jewel and Javed Khan?s Venus were the other outsiders who scored in their respective events.

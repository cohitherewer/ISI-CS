 McMillan out of Aussie tour too

 Fleming 

Wellington: Batsman Craig McMillan has again been left out of New Zealand?s Test side for their tour of Australia starting later this month. 

McMillan also missed the 2-0 Test series victory over Bangladesh, completed last week when Stephen Fleming?s side won the second Test in Chittagong by an innings and 101 runs, though he is playing the one-day series in Bangladesh. 

Hamish Marshall replaced McMillan in Bangladesh and his one innings of 69 in the second Test was enough to see him kept for the Australian tour when the 14-man squad, which was unchanged from the Bangladesh series, was named on Monday. 

Fleming will return to lead the side after being rested for the Bangladesh one-day series, as does allrounder Jacob Oram, who was also rested for the one-dayers. 

?Marshall has done the job asked of him, even though he has had just one Test innings in Bangladesh,? New Zealand?s chief selector Richard Hadlee said in a statement. 

New Zealand play New South Wales in a warm-up match before the first Test against Australia starts in Brisbane on November 18, while the second begins in Adelaide on November 26. There are also three one-day matches after the Tests. 

SQUAD 

Stephen Fleming (captain), Nathan Astle, Ian Butler, James Franklin, Hamish Marshall, Chris Martin, Brendan McCullum, Kyle Mills, Jacob Oram, Mark Richardson, Mathew Sinclair, Scott Styris, Daniel Vettori, Paul Wiseman. 

Vettori to lead 

Left-arm spinner Daniel Vettori will lead New Zealand in the absence of Stephen Fleming even as Bangladesh welcome back skipper Habibul Bashar for the first of the three one-day Internationals starting Tuesday, adds a report from Chittagong. 

Bashar missed both Tests with an injured thumb.

 Settle issue, Kapil tells ICC

Jalandhar: Kapil Dev said on Friday that there should be no ?ambiguity? in the suspect bowling action rules and asked the International Cricket Council (ICC) to settle the issue for ?once and all? instead of lingering on it for long. 

Kapil, who was here as the chief guest at the Farmtrack hockey tournament, said the delay in settling the issue has resulted in the players, found with suspect bowling action, undergoing the ?ordeal once in every two years.? 

?I would appreciate if such controversial issues are not allowed to linger on and should be settled at the earliest so that the players could concentrate on their game instead of having to worry about other issues.? 

On the ICC finding fault in ace off-spinner Harbhajan Singh?s action, Kapil said ?there is nothing wrong in saying that there is any fault in a bowler?s action if the concerned authorities feel so. 

?But the ambiguity over such issues must be cleared at the earliest for the benefit of everyone.? 

Kapil also said that such matters must not trouble the cricketers as these were part and parcel of one?s career. 

?Had they pointed out at me for a suspect action, at least I would not have been a bothered man and even offered myself for any test,? he said. 

Asked if there was any racial discrimination, Kapil avoided the query saying the cricketers from the sub-continent were more flexible in their bowling action and hence were more prone to such calls. (PTI)

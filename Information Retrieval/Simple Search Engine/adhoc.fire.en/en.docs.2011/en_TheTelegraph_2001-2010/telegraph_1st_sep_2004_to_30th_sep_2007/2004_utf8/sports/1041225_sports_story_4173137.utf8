 Bahutule century lifts Mumbai

Mumbai: Sairaj Bahutule slammed an unbeaten century to lift Mumbai from 67 for six to 264 for 8 in the second innings against Karnataka on the third day of their Ranji Trophy Elite group A match on Friday. 

The Mumbai captain remained unconquered on 107, laced with 14 fours, after helping the home team recover from a difficult pre-lunch period through an invaluable 117-run partnership for the seventh wicket with hard-hitting spin partner Ramesh Powar, who made 65 with eleven fours. 

Bahutule was given a reprieve by umpire H.S. Sekhon after being declared out caught at slip off Sunil Joshi when trying to sweep the left-arm spinner. Bahutule, then on 96, indicated to the umpire that the ball had gone off his arm. Sekhon, to the surprise of everyone concerned, conferred with square leg umpire S.C. Gupta and reversed his decision which was hotly contested by the Karnataka fielders, but to no avail.

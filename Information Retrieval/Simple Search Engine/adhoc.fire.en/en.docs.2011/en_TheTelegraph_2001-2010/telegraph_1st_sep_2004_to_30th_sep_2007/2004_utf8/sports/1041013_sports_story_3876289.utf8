 England, Brazil confident of smooth sailing

 - WORLD CUP QUALIFIERS 

- Top teams to miss key players

Even as a fresh set of World Cup qualifiers take place around the world Wednesday, some top teams will miss key players. England will keep missing David Beckham (vs Azerbaijan), who is expected back from his rib hairline fracture by the weekend and Brazil will miss Kaka and medio Juninho Pernambucano (vs Colombia), but Argentina will travel to Santiago in good form. 

England could remain the only major power to top their group after the latest round of qualifiers Wednesday. In Azerbaijan they hope to win for the third time in four matches and top Group VI (European Zone) following their impressive 2-0 win over Wales at Old Trafford Saturday, says a report from London. 

After an opening 2-2 draw with Austria, Sven-Goran Eriksson?s men have responded with a 2-1 away win in Poland and the home victory over Wales. 

Though a win in Azerbaijan is not a foregone conclusion, even without suspended and injured skipper David Beckham, England look too strong for the home side. 

Hosts Germany have already qualified for the finals. England top their group, France are third ? albeit on goal difference ? in Group IV, Italy are second in Group V and Spain are third, also on goal difference, in Group VII. 

The French have made a faltering start, drawing 0-0 with Israel and Ireland at home and winning 2-0 in the Faroe Islands. They travel to Cyprus for a match they should win easily ? but will be taking nothing for granted after eking out a narrow 2-1 win over Cyprus when they last played there during the qualifiers for Euro 2004. 

Italy, meanwhile, have also got something to prove after slipping up 0-1 in Slovenia on Saturday, but they should bounce back with a victory over Belarus in Parma on Wednesday. 

However, they drew twice with Belarus in the Euro 2000 qualifiers five years ago and the current Italian team, being remodelled by new coach Marcello Lippi, will need to work hard to gain all three points. 

They start in second place in their group behind Slovenia who travel to Norway buoyed by their win over the Italians. 

Spain could be in for a tricky game in Lithuania, who are top after a 1-1 draw with Belgium and a 4-0 win over San Marino. 

No substitute yet 

Brazil coach Carlos Alberto Parreira has yet to decide on a substitution for Kaka, who will not be playing vs a struggling Colombia because of a booking suspension, adds a report from Maceio (Brazil). 

Kaka scored twice in Saturday?s 5-2 win in Venezuela, but also picked up a second yellow card. Fenerbahce midfielder Alex appears to be the favourite after playing for the first team in Monday?s training session, with Parreira keeping the same attacking formation of Ronaldo and Ronaldinho. That would mean that Adriano would again start on the bench. 

In midfield, Parreira is likely to field the inexperienced Magrao as the replacement for the injured Juninho. Edu is another option but would have to play out of position. 

Brazil lead the 10-nation South American group with 19 points from nine games and are still unbeaten. 

Colombia, beaten 1-2 at home by Brazil earlier in the competition, are level on nine points with Peru and Bolivia at the bottom of the table, although they are only four points behind fourth-placed Ecuador. 

Paraguay will try to keep pace with Brazil and Argentina when they face a demoralised Peru, says a report from Rio de Janeiro. 

Paraguay, third with 15 points, look an increasingly good prospect to take the third spot, especially if they win their match in Asuncion. 

Paraguay are without injured captain Carlos Gamarra and striker Roque Santa Cruz but should still be too well-organised for a Peru team which has fallen into disarray. 

Peru, who are level with Colombia and Bolivia on nine points, gave a listless performance as they lost 0-1 away to Bolivia on Saturday and the media are united in demanding the resignation of Brazilian coach Paulo Autuori. Captain Nolberto Solano returns for the visitors, who are again without striker Claudio Pizarro. 

News from Buenos Aires says that Argentina are determined not to make the mistake of underestimating Chile, who they face in a World Cup qualifier in Santiago on Wednesday.

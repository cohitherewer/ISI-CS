Chennai: The exploits of the Indian spinners and the conditions here have already sent the alarm bells ringing. Australia are planning to rework their strategies, whatever the outcome of this second game, ahead of the Nagpur and Mumbai Tests. 

?We?ll use the break after the second Test to reassess our plans,? said John Buchanan after the third day?s play. The third Test begins October 26. 

The Australian coach, however, did not go into details, only saying, ?I?m happy with the way the three big bowlers have been going. They have been penetrative and have acted as a perfect foil to each other. 

?They?ve bowled very well in tandem. Brett Lee will be a good support but the strategies will be reassessed only after this Test.? 

However, according to The Telegraph?s sources, Lee is likely to replace Michael Kasprowicz in Nagpur. If the third Test produces a wicket with as much bounce as at the Chepauk, the visitors feel a bowler who can hit the deck will be of great use. Glenn McGrath has lost his pace and that leaves the team with only Jason Gillespie who can bowl real quick. Lee?s presence will add to the pressure. 

Buchanan feels that the fourth morning will be vital. ?We?ll have to get at least two partnerships going. I would love to be ahead by 250 to 300 runs. If we can bat as Kaif and Patel did today, then setting a sizeable target will not be difficult,? he explained. 

Buchanan lamented the loss of Simon Katich and Adam Gilchrist late in the day. ?It would have been better had we kept those two wickets in hand. But we still have six wickets, including three qualified batsmen. Tomorrow will be a big test for our batsmen. If we bat well, things could be difficult for India in the fourth innings. 

?We?re going to learn from our mistakes. India batted efficiently and that was no surprise at all. While they continue to be an effective threat, we?ll have to go out there and see what we can do.?

Buchanan said Gilchrist?s decision to come at No.3 

was pre-planned. ?We kept everybody guessing? But we were planning to have him 

up the order. It never happened earlier to maintain the balance in the side. It 

was a positive move and was supported by everyone today.? 

While Buchanan is banking on partnerships, Sourav Ganguly is still keeping his fingers crossed. ?Wait till tomorrow, you?ll get to know everything,? the Team India captain said before boarding the bus. 

Mohammed Kaif, however, believes it ?will be tough? batting in the fourth innings. ?Our spinners are in excellent form. We are looking to chase around 120 to 130, but it will be tough for batters.? 

The youngster felt that Gilchrist?s dismissal was ?great psychologically?. ?It was a much needed wicket since he can change the course of the game single-handedly. Having two new batsmen at the crease will help on the fourth morning.? 

Kaif felt the ?confidence gained in England? helped him a lot today. He is still feeling ?a bit weak. 

?Let?s wait and see how I feel tomorrow morning,? he added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Davenport, Kuznetsova beat showers to semi-finals

 - Hurricane Frances holds up Federer-Agassi classic 

 Andre Agassi grimaces during a break in his match against Roger Federer on Wednesday 

New York: The remnants of Hurricane Frances swept into New York to leave the eagerly-awaited US Open quarter final between top seed Roger Federer and two-time former champion Andre Agassi hanging in the balance on Wednesday. 

Lindsay Davenport and ninth-seeded Russian Svetlana Kuznetsova dodged the showers to set up a semi-final clash in women?s singles but the rain returned to interrupt Federer and Agassi with the Swiss leading 6-3, 2-6, 7-5. 

Fifth seed Tim Henman was also on the verge of a first US Open semi-final appearance, leading 22nd seed Dominik Hrbaty of Slovakia 6-1, 7-5, 4-5. 

When play finally began on the Arthur Ashe Court, soon after 7.45 pm local time, Federer and Agassi were greeted by a half-empty stadium. 

The predicted electric atmosphere did not take long to materialise though as world No. 1 Federer, looking to become the first man to win three Grand Slam titles in the same year since Swede Mats Wilander in 1988, took the opening set. But as the stadium filled up, so Agassi, the darling of the New York crowd, lifted his game. 

The 34-year-old, champion in 1994 and 1999, began to target the Federer backhand and it paid dividends when the American broke for a 2-0 lead in the second set. 

Under constant pressure from the depth of Agassi?s groundstrokes, Federer began to make mistakes as he dropped the set. 

Roared on by the crowd, Agassi had a chance in the second game of the third set but Federer saved a break-point with an ace and though the veteran American continued to play the better tennis, he was unable to press home his advantage. 

Agassi had not faced a single break-point in the third set until a double fault at 30-30 in the 11th game handed Federer his opening. A netted backhand from Agassi then gave the Swiss the break and a strong service game helped him take the set. 

The two players were level at deuce on the Agassi serve in the opening game of the fourth set when the rain returned. 

Henman, looking to become only the second British man to reach the last four at Flushing Meadows in the Open Era, blitzed through the first set and saved a set-point at 4-5 in the second before doubling his lead. 

The fifth seed, who reached the semi-finals at the French Open and the quarter finals at Wimbledon earlier this year, broke for 2-1 in the third but Hrbaty levelled at 4-4 and held serve for 5-4 before they were forced off court. 

The few fans who ventured on to the Louis Armstrong Court witnessed a demolition job from fifth seed Davenport as she dismissed unseeded Japanese Shinobu Asagoe 6-1, 6-1 in 45 minutes. 

Despatched to Court 11 where only a smattering of spectators greeted them, ninth seed Kuznetsova trailed 0-2 against fellow-Russian Nadia Petrova, the 14th seed who beat defending champion Justine Henin-Hardenne in Round IV. 

But Kuznetsova hit back to seize the first-set tie-break and an early break in the second helped her clinch her first Grand Slam semi-final appearance with a 7-6, 6-3 triumph. 

?This has been a strange year for me, it?s been good but could have been so much better,? Kuznetsova said after joining another Russian, Elena Dementieva, in the last four. 

Paes-Rikl in semis 

Leander Paes and Czech partner David Rikl stormed into the men?s doubles semis. The 13th-seeds ousted Spaniards Feliciano Lopez and Fernando Verdasco 7-6 (7-4), 6-3. 

Paes and Rikl will meet another Spanish duo ? Rafael Nadal and Tommy Robredo ? in the last four. Nadal and Robredo overcame Robbie Koenig (South Africa) and Travis Parrott (US) 7-5, 7-5. 

Paes has also made it to the mixed doubles semis with 

Martina Navratilova. They are scheduled to meet Aussie duo Todd Woodbridge and 

Alicia Molik. (Reuters)

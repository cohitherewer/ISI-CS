 Beckham will remain captain, insists FA

 - Saying sorry might make a difference: Sepp Blatter 

 HENRY WINTER IN BAKU 

 Beckham says leading England is the greatest honour 

Geoff Thompson, the FA chairman, has insisted that David Beckham would not lose the England captaincy for deliberately getting himself booked by fouling Ben Thatcher, the Wales full-back, on Saturday. 

Beckham apologised on Wednesday, although Sepp Blatter, the president of Fifa, the game?s ruling body, said this won?t be enough. 

Soho Square have always stressed that there was ?no thirst for blood? over Beckham, according to one insider. Speculation that he might be stripped of his beloved England armband had worried Beckham, who rang Sven-Goran Eriksson to voice his regrets. 

?Of course I can see him staying as England captain,? Thompson said. ?The captain made an error of judgement. He has apologised. Whether it is taken further is a matter for the FA to decide. It is good he has made that apology.? 

Blatter, who was with Thompson in Baku for England?s international, was also pleased Beckham had apologised. ?Saying sorry might make a difference but you can?t just forget what happened,? Blatter said. ?An apology will have a positive effect on those who are making the decision once an action has been taken.? 

On hearing this, Thompson said: ?People can interpret what the president says in different ways. I don?t wish to comment [on whether Beckham would be suspended]. It is not for me to make that decision.? 

The decision over who should captain England rests with Eriksson, and it would be a major surprise if the Swede turned against his favourite midfielder now. Eriksson was hardly delighted by the timing of Beckham?s revelation about his ploy to use up a suspension while injured, coming as it did on the eve of an England international, but has admired the player?s leadership skills. 

Beckham hoped that his apology would defuse the furore over his admission that he had intentionally clattered into Thatcher. ?The greatest honour in my career was when I was made England captain. 

?There is no better feeling in football than playing for your country,? said Beckham. ?In an interview I was asked a question and made a frank and honest admission to counter the negative speculation.? 

The referee who administered the booking, Terje Hauge, said Wednesday that what Beckham had done was ?not correct?. The Norwegian added: ?He is the captain of the England team and he is a star. Many young players look up to him. It?s not good for him to think and act like that.? 

Real Madrid doctor Juan Carlos Hernandez revealed that Beckham had suffered a hairline fracture in the seventh and eighth ribs on his left-hand side and remained in a considerable amount of pain. 

 Eriksson said: ?That I should ever have doubted that Beckham would be captain ? no way. I have never doubted that. 

?Of course I appreciate it [the apology]. Of course it should be the end of the matter ? let?s finish it for ever.?

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 ?I am ready for what lies ahead?

 - I?d have been very happy if Ricky was on the flight to India: Gilchrist 

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI 

 Brad Hodge will replace Ricky Ponting in the squad 

London: As expected, Adam Gilchrist has been elevated to the Australian captaincy. However, in a brief interaction with The Telegraph on Thursday afternoon, he said he would rather have preferred Ricky Ponting being around. 

?More than being pleased with again getting the chance to lead Australia, I would have been very happy had Ricky been with us on our flight to India... Of course, I?m ready for what lies ahead,? Gilchrist remarked at the Royal Garden Hotel. 

The Australians leave for India, via Dubai, on Friday. 

Ponting, it may be recalled, left for home after fracturing his left thumb in the Champions Trophy semi-final against England. For now, he is ruled out till the first Test (which begins in Bangalore on October 6), but could sit out much longer. 

Till such time that Ponting isn?t available, his place in the squad is going to be taken by gifted Victorian Brad Hodge. He is uncapped, but played for Australia A in last season?s Team India tour Down Under. 

?An assessment will be made once Ricky is available. Till such time, though, Brad is going to be an integral part of the touring party,? informed coach John Buchanan. 

Ponting, by the way, should be landing in Sydney in the early hours of Friday.

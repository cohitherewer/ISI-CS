The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Imran remembers the early Sachin

 - Little Master in same bracket as Lara and Inzamam, says former Pak captain 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: Imran Khan, the Pakistan captain in Sachin Tendulkar?s debut Test (and series), back in 1989-90, didn?t expect the 16-year-old to scale the heights he has. 

?It?s not that I saw Sachin as a cheeky schoolboy but, at the same time, I couldn?t then have predicted he would emerge such a champion batsman,? Imran told The Telegraph on Saturday. 

By the way, this is Imran?s first visit to the city after 15 years ? the last trip was for the Nehru Cup final. Pakistan claimed the trophy, under his captaincy, beating the West Indies. 

Imran, who only landed some 14 hours before the Platinum Jubilee Cup (and belatedly broke fast by calling for yoghurt and coconut water at the hotel) added: ?Within a few years, though, it became apparent Sachin was headed for big things... He needs to be complimented...? 

In his book, Sachin is in the same bracket as Brian Lara and Inzamam-ul Haq. Come Monday and the present generation?s Little Master completes 15 years at the highest level. 

According to Imran, no praise will be too high as many ?very gifted? cricketers disappeared quicker than they surfaced. ?You know, making a forecast is difficult... However, when somebody looks good even after a decade-and-half, he deserves credit...? 

Imran, who cut short his stay in Hong Kong to make it in time for the Cup and the former Test captains? felicitation by the Board, leaves for Lahore (via New Delhi) on Sunday morning itself. 

?Id back home is on Monday... So, even if I want to, I can?t stay any longer,? Imran, now a Member of the National Assembly, signed off.

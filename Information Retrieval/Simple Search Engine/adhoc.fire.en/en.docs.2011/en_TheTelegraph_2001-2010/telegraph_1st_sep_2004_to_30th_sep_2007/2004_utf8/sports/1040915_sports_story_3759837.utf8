The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Tenzing Norgay award for Bula

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Bula Chowdhury 

Calcutta: Bula Chowdhury has swum against the current for years, literally, ploughing the high waters, a record-setting tour of the seven seas. The 1992 Arjuna Awardee?s efforts has finally paid off on a bigger scale, with President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam to give her the Tenzing Norgay Adventural National Sports Award in New Delhi in September. 

The recognition comes after years of toil and after having crossed turbulent waters around the globe. 

Bula has crossed the English Channel twice (1989 and 1999), the Strait of Gibraltar in 2000, the Tyrreanean Sea (Italy) the year after, the Toroneous Gulf (Greece) and the Catalina Channel (Los Angeles) in 2002, the Cook Strait (New Zealand) in 2003 and the Palk Strait this year. 

That completed her tour of four continents ? America, Australia, Europe and Asia. 

Now her target is covering Africa. 

That should complete her tour of the five continents. To that effect, she will be travelling to Cape Town in January to swim over to Robson Island, 36km from there. 

Not that she needs this extra cushioning. 

She just wants to remain the queen she has always been. 

The Guinness Book of World Records is already at the job of seeing if her feat so far (excluding Africa) can be termed a record.

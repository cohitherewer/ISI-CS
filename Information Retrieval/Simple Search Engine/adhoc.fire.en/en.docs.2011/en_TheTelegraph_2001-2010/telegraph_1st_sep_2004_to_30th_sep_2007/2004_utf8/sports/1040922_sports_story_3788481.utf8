The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Vaughan says beating Aussies an achievement

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

Birmingham: England caused the upset of the Champions Trophy, shocking world beaters Australia by six wickets in semi-final No. 1. 

In doing so, at Edgbaston on Tuesday, the hosts made their biggest final since reaching the title round of the 1992 World Cup. Also, it?s significant that the win is England?s first over Australia in well over five years. 

?It?s a great victory? Beating Australia on any given day is an achievement? We did very well to restrict them to 259 for nine and, then, carried forward from there,? remarked an ecstatic Michael Vaughan, who led from the front with a MoM-award winning 86. 

He added: ?Actually, I?m absolutely delighted the team did so well on such a huge stage? The semi-finals of the biggest tournament after the World Cup.? 

Opposite number Ricky Ponting was sporting despite being pushed into an unusual corner. He said: ?We didn?t bat consistently well and fell about 30 short? It?s disappointing to lose to any opposition? Fact is, England played better?? 

Sadly, England?s best one-day moment in over a decade was watched by less than 10,000 spectators. 

?Yes, for a number of reasons, this hasn?t been the ideal time for the Champions Trophy,? accepted an International Cricket Council (ICC) official in a chat with The Telegraph. 

The ICC does need to fine-tune a few things.

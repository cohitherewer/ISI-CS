 Rest capture crown for 17th time

Mohali: Mumbai capitulated on the fourth day of the Irani Trophy to hand Rest of India a massive 290-run win at the PCA Stadium here on Saturday. This was the 17th time Rest of India lifted the coveted trophy. 

It was a most unimpressive display by the Ranji Trophy champions as they were bundled out for 204, chasing a fourth-innings target of 495. 

The task was too tough for Mumbai who had conceded a 116-run first-innings lead before allowing the Rest side pile up a huge second-innings total. 

The way Mumbai kept lost wickets, it seemed their batsmen?s minds had already shifted to the three-day game against the visiting Australians. They looked to be in a tearing hurry to catch the flight home. 

The Rest second innings lasted just an over, having resumed on 363 for nine. As many as 15 runs were added with Zaheer Khan clubbing Robbin Morris for two huge sixes.

 Murali for Lancashire

London: Test cricket?s leading wicket-taker Muttiah Muralidharan has signed for Lancashire for the first half of the 2005 season, the county side said on Tuesday. 

Sri Lanka off-spinner Muralidharan has had two previous spells with the county in 1999 and 2001, taking 116 wickets at an average of 15.06 in 14 first-class matches. 

?It?s great to have Murali again,? Lancashire manager Mike Watkinson told the club?s website. ?He is an obvious leader in world cricket and will provide an added edge to the early part of the season.? 

The 32-year-old, who has taken 532 Test wickets, has international commitments with Sri Lanka for the second half of 2005.

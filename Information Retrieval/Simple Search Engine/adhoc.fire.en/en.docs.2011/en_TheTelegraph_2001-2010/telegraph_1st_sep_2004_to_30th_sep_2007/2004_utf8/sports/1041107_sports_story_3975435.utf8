The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Curator Polly Umrigar spins a twist

 - Such an early finish to a Test isn?t in the interests of anybody: Shetty 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Matthew Hayden is clean bowled, one of 20 wickets to fall on Day III of the final Test. Eighteen wickets fell on the second day 

 Mumbai: Curator Polly Umrigar has defended 

 the Wankhede wicket prepared by him for the fourth and final 

 Test, which actually ended in a shade over two days? play, 

 on Friday. It?s another matter that India won by 13 runs. 

 ?I?ve been reading a lot of comments... 

 However, I can?t understand why (Ricky) Ponting chose to 

 use the heavy (half tonne) roller before both innings... 

 It?s common knowledge something heavy will ensure the wicket 

 breaks quickly,? Umrigar, a former India captain, told The 

 Telegraph. 

Speaking on Saturday evening, he added: ?My own belief is that the Australian captain?s tactics backfired... I accept the wicket helped the spinners, but I don?t agree it ever was dangerous... Moreover, the turn wasn?t there from the first ball, was it? Our spinners did better simply because of their class...? 

Umrigar has raised an interesting point, but it?s unlikely that alone is going to silence the many critical voices. Incidentally, Rahul Dravid preferred a much lighter (one-fourth tonne) roller. 

Whatever Umrigar?s views, the Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) intends embarking on some soul-searching. 

?The wicket, I reckon, could top the agenda at our next managing committee meeting... Such an early finish to a Test isn?t in the interests of anybody, least of all the game itself,? maintained MCA joint-secretary Prof. Ratnakar Shetty. 

 Among others, the MCA managing committee includes 

 former India captain Dilip Vengsarkar and one-time India 

 player Lalchand Rajput. A couple of former Ranji Trophy-level 

 cricketers are also on the body.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 I would like to end my career as a performer: Moin Khan

 - ?I?m surprised Parthiv Patel got dropped... This is the time his confidence should be increased? 

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI 

 Moin Khan

Birmingham: Moin Khan is just a few days short of turning 33, but already is the senior pro in the Pakistan ranks. A former captain, he has 145 dismissals in Test cricket and took to Sunday?s shootout with 280 in ODIs ? incidentally, he is No. 2 (behind Adam Gilchrist) in the shorter version. Effective with the bat as well, he has 2,735 runs in Tests and began his 215th ODI with 3,235. Very relaxed despite being hours away from a big game, Moin interacted with The Telegraph for well over half-an-hour on Saturday. 

The following are excerpts 

On surviving in a system where the turnover 

of players is often very high 

(Grins) Yes, I?ve been around for about 14 years, but don?t think I?ve got more than a couple left... Ek-do saal aur nikal jaye... 

On what has taken him this far 

Performance... Fitness... (Emotionally) I would like to end my career as a performer... I?ve never been short on motivation ? not even during the three years or so that I was out of the team. 

On whether he got sidelined towards the end of the 1999-2000 season because he raised demands on behalf of the players 

A lot of stories were floated, a lot of questions were asked... But, fact is I lost my place owing to a knee injury and Rashid Latif did well on his comeback. 

On talk that he had a row with the then Pakistan Cricket Board chief, Lt Gen. Tauqir Zia 

Not true... In any case, I don?t get involved with things not directly connected with cricket... Main un sab cheezon mein nahin parta. (After a pause) But, yes, being the captain then, I did feel strongly about the selection of some players. 

On whether being a wicketkeeper-captain was tough 

Of course, there?s additional pressure... However, I enjoyed being captain and never saw it as a burden. Having said that, I?m definitely more relaxed now... I?m happy being a senior. 

On whether he learnt from any of the captains he played under 

Learnt the most from Wasim Akram... He handled the boys very well and I quite liked his style of man management... Then, he stayed relaxed... Thande rahne se bahut kuch ho jata hai... Getting angry doesn?t help. 

On Imran Khan 

I didn?t play a great deal under him, but there?s no need for me to speak about his captaincy... Among captains, he stands out. 

On Pakistan cricket regularly being hit by controversies 

Often, it has been due to a lack of communication? between the Board and the players and, then, between the players themselves... Generally, a small problem gets magnified... I accept there have been differences of opinion on a lot of issues, but never on the scale presented... I suppose education makes a difference... Has a bearing on how an individual reacts to situations... As it turns out, not all our players are highly educated and that contributes to a small issue getting blown up... We seniors must guide the newcomers and those short on experience. 

On the innovative Bob Woolmer being the latest coach 

We?re heading in the right direction... Bob is aware of what needs to be done in today?s cricket and, besides, he looks to the future... He has always been a student and has himself done much research. His outlook, therefore, is refreshingly different. 

On Woolmer?s approach 

His best quality is that he makes everybody feel like match-winners... Even somebody who has failed is made to feel like a hero... He doesn?t allow anybody?s confidence to take a beating... That small push, which can make such a difference, comes from Woolmer. 

On whether it?s an advantage having a coach from overseas 

Perhaps, yes... Somebody from overseas doesn?t come with any baggage, so to say, and won?t get involved with politics. My opinion is that coaches from overseas are (a) neutral and (b) definitely more professional. 

On whether he idolised any ?keeper 

Wasim Bari... Later, I admired Ian Healy, the current world record-holder... Whenever possible, I took tips from him. 

On what separated Healy from the rest 

Superb footwork and an easy manner of collection... 

On the qualities needed to succeed as a ?keeper 

Given today?s cricket and its pace, he has to be an impact-player and, so, a good batsman... After all, the days of a specialist ?keeper who can?t contribute with the bat are over. Then, obviously, he has to be good in his trade. The more relaxed a ?keeper is, the better he will be... The body co-ordination is, then, going to be fine. 

On the ?keeper having the best ?seat? 

I quite agree... He follows everything closely and, really, is the side?s backbone... Uski body-language pe bahut depend karta hai... 

On Rahul Dravid having to play two roles 

Actually, despite the extra pressure, he has done well... I don?t think your specialist ?keepers have been much better. 

On the Indian ?keepers he has played against 

Kiran More was good... So too Nayan Mongia... But, then, the requirements have changed. 

On Parthiv Patel 

I?m surprised he got dropped... This is the time his confidence should be increased. 

On the present day ?keepers not being in the same league as Rodney Marsh/Bob Taylor/Syed Kirmani/Bari 

But, then, there?s always a cycle... Also, don?t forget that the pressure on specialists to make a significant contribution with the bat has taken its toll... Still, I feel there are outstanding ?keepers like Gilchrist and Mark Boucher. 

On his favourite dismissal 

When I caught a flicking Gus Logie one-handed off Waqar Younis, way down the leg-side, in Sharjah back in the early Nineties. It was an instinctive move. 

On ?keeping to Akram and Younis 

Very challenging, specially when the ball began to reverse. At times, it was impossible to ?read?. (Adds laughing) To be honest, I would start praying when they operated... Koi catch na chooth jaye. 

On whether there was a ?code? between him and either Akram or Younis 

With Akram, yes... He would indicate, with a particular eye movement, that the next ball would be a slower one. 

On ?keeping to Shoaib Akhtar 

Tough... Has got a scorching pace and, then, can reverse lethally. The collection-time is that much less... 

On whether he gets to switch off in spells when the Shoaibs are hurling grenades 

When they walk back to the top of their run-up... The tension begins when they start to charge in... I relax only when the collection has been made. Sadly, though, people largely seem to notice a ?keeper?s misses. 

On his own emotions before and during an Indo-Pak contest 

(Smiles) One is more involved... One is more pumped up... Looking back, we?ve beaten India every time we?ve absorbed the pressure without getting overwhelmed... We?ve won when the enjoyment has been there. 

Finally, his message to emerging ?keepers 

Work hard and enjoy... Play as much as you can... There?s no point simply sitting at home and dreaming big ? go right out and realise your dream.

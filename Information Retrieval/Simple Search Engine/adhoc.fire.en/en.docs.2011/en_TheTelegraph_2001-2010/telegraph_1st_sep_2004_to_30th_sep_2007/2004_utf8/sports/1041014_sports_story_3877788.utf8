 Geoff Hurst hits out at Beckham

 Hurst feels Beckham brought the country into disrepute 

Baku: David Beckham is set to be hauled over the coals by English football authorities over his admission that he deliberately fouled an opponent to earn himself a convenient booking in last week?s World Cup qualifier against Wales. 

The lightest punishment the Real Madrid midfielder can expect is a hefty fine for bringing the game into disrepute, a move that would inevitably cast doubt on whether he is fit to continue as England captain. 

England manager Sven-Goran Eriksson has attempted to calm the storm by insisting that Beckham?s behaviour was not unusual in modern football. 

But that cut little ice with England?s 1966 World Cup hero Geoff Hurst, who accused the current England captain of sullying the country?s reputation for fair play. 

Beckham revealed in an interview that he had barged into Wales full-back Ben Thatcher knowing a yellow card would mean him being suspended for the match in Azerbaijan ? a match he knew he was going to miss anyway having broken his rib just minutes before the booking. 

Later, Beckham has apologised to the Football Association (FA), his teammates and supporters. ?The greatest honour in my career was when I was made England captain, there is no better feeling in football than playing for your country,? Beckham said in a statement read out by Sky Sports News on Wednesday. 

By serving the suspension, Beckham has his slate wiped clean for the rest of the campaign rather than having to play later matches knowing he was just one booking away from a ban. 

Hurst said such conduct would have been unthinkable for the late Bobby Moore, captain of the 1966 team. 

Hurst, who scored a hattrick in the 1966 final win over Germany, said there could be a case for Beckham to be charged by the Fifa with bringing international football into disrepute. 

?If they?ve read that, they could say he?s bringing the game into disrepute, I would argue he brings the country into disrepute,? he said.

 Jason Gillespie backs bowling rotation plans

 Gillespie believes Australia can rest players without affecting results 

Brisbane: Australia?s plans to rotate their star bowlers to save them from Test burn-out ahead of next year?s Ashes series in England has the backing of paceman Jason Gillespie. 

World cricket?s leading team is down to play nine Tests in 13 weeks and chairman of selectors Trevor Hohns said his panel was considering the rotation issue. 

Hohns said on Monday that a resting policy would only occur when front-line pacemen were felt to be overworked or unwell. ?It may be something we might consider, particularly if someone is tired or a little bit under par given what lies ahead,? Hohns said the day after Australia?s thumping innings victory over New Zealand in the first Test at the Gabba. 

?It will never be done for no reason, either. We?re not about to rip anyone out of a Test match for the sake of it,? he added. 

Gillespie said he supported rotating Australia?s fast bowlers in the lead-up to next year?s Ashes tour of England. He said he would not have a problem with sitting out a Test match if it was in the best interests of the team and himself. 

Australia have two of Test cricket?s all-time bowling greats with leg-spinner Shane Warne, the leading wicket-taker with 549, and paceman Glenn McGrath, fourth all-time with 457 Test wickets. 

Australia still rest players in one-dayers despite dumping an official ?rotation policy? following below-par results three summers ago. 

Gillespie said he could see the merit in the plan given the amount of travel and back-to-back Tests played these days. 

?I wouldn?t have a problem at all,? he told reporters. ?I can fully understand if someone wouldn?t want to be rested. It would be a hard thing to come to grips with being rested from a Test match because it?s never been done before. (AFP)

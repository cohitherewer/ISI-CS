 Vijay holds key to Guineas 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Trainer Vijay Singh holds a vice like grip over the Calcutta 2,000 Guineas on Saturday. Aperitivo, Approved and Formal Invitation are the three of his five wards who look to be promising enough to account for Moon Emperor and Star Emblem ? trainer Daniel David?s challengers in the nine-horse field.

 Daniel may be further handicapped owning to uncertainty about Moon Emperor?s rider B. Prakash?s availability. The cha-mpion jockey is recuperating after a fall from Fine Choice in Bangalore on Friday.

 Nevertheless, Approved has been measured in the company of the best in the stable and the Excalibur?s Lake-Our Fantasy son is going from strength-to-strength.

 Aperitivo, on the other hand, boasts of finishing a good fourth behind a formidable opposition in the Bangalore Colts Trial Stakes while Formal Invitation is known to be a good miler. 

 Everything considered, the improving Approved may just about manage to hold Aperitivo at the busy end.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

Calcutta: East Bengal, already assured of the Super Division title, were handed over a 1-2 defeat by Ever-Ready in their last Super Six match at the Barasat Stadium on Friday. Emmanuel Thomas and Satyajit Basu scored for the winners while Douglas da Silva reduced the margin. 

Ever-Ready proved from the beginning that they were determined to go all out to complete their giant-killing spree this season. The prospect of a second-place finish was also lurking round the corner. 

This was Ever-Ready?s first win against East Bengal. They defeated Mohun Bagan twice and Mohammedan Sporting once in the ongoing league. 

East Bengal and Ever-Ready finished with 39 and 38 points, respectively. Mohun Bagan (35 from 17) must beatTollygunge Agragami to take second place. 

The match was evenly poised till Ever-Ready midfielder Satyajit Basu, who had superb day in office, unleashed a brilliant left-footer only to see the ball hitting the horizontal. That was the turning point as Ever-Ready started dominating the proceedings. 

The duo of Emmanuel and Eugene Gray appeared to be the biggest threat to the East Bengal defence, without Dipak Mondal. Ever-Ready went ahead in the 35th minute when a Gray cross from the right was volleyed in by Emmanuel. Sangram Mukherjee hardly got time to react. 

East Bengal tried their best to draw level but ended up going down 0-2. This goal was the result of brilliant skill and understanding between Crispen Chhetri and Satyajit. Chhetri advancing down the left unleashed a floater for Satyajit in the 59th minute. The perfect header stunned Mukherjee. 

East Bengal, in a desperate bid to keep their unbeaten record intact, pushed Douglas upfront which fetched the desired result within a few minutes. Douglas, receiving a Paolo minus, scored from a melee to make it 2-1. 

But that was all. East Bengal failed to draw level in the remaining 26 minutes. Twice, Ever-Ready players hit the bar. Once it was Satyajit and the second time Gray?s curving free-kick kissed the bar. 

Ever-Ready have the maximum (12) wins in the league compared to East Bengal?s 11. 

East Bengal players wore black armbands in memory of Cristiano Junior.

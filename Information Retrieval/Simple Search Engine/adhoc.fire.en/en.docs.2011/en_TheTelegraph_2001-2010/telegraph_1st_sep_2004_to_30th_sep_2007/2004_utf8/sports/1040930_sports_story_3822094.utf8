Mumbai: Ranji Trophy Champions Mumbai are gearing up to lock horns with the Australians in a three-day game at the Brabourne Stadium on Thursday. 

Mind games are on, with Mumbai coach Chandrakant Pandit saying he had a few surprises up his sleeves, and Australian coach John Buchanan indicating he may leave out his trump card, leg-spinner Shane Warne, from the tour opener. 

?We want to give everyone a chance to get into the groove as this is the only match on the tour before the four-Test series,? Buchanan said after the nets on Wednesday. 

Asked whether Warne, who was mauled by the Mumbai batsmen on the 1997-98 tour-opener with Sachin Tendulkar and others carting him to all parts of the Brabourne Stadium, would play, Buchanan was non-committal. 

?We want to make sure that the players who would be out of the Test side (at Bangalore) are ready to play Test matches (later if required),? the Aussie coach added. ?We had three days of good work-out. Now we have the three-day match to prepare ourselves further.? 

?We have a few options ? Simon Katich, (stand-in captain) Adam Gilchrist, Michael Clarke ? to try out.? 

On whether it was a disadvantage not having Darren Lehmann, a key player in the sub-continent with his ability to play spin well, available to play in the match because of a delayed flight out of Australia, Buchanan said, ?It was?. 

?It would have been preferable for Darren to have played this match. But it was not to be,? he said, adding the left-handed batsman would have to make to with whatever practice he can get in the nets to get into the groove for the battles ahead. 

Mumbai, meanwhile, are very confident of repeating what they had inflicted on the Aussies on the last two occasions in tour matches. 

?We have done well against them in the past two matches. We are the Ranji Trophy champions over the last two years and don?t have to be overawed by the occasion. It?s a great challenge and a big game for all of us,? team member Ajit Agarkar said before the tie. 

Agarkar, too, has a big stake in the match with the Indian pace attack wearing such an unsettled look because of injury woes, the latest being the ankle injury reportedly sustained by Ashish Nehra at Bangalore on Tuesday. 

The wiry Mumbai right-arm pacer played a major role with a six-wicket haul in the first innings of the Adelaide Test won by India on the tour to Australia last year, but since then Agarkar has struggled to be consistent. 

Mumbai?s batting has a very brittle look to it and was exposed thoroughly at Mohali by the Rest of India bowlers in the season-opening Irani Cup tie, but coach Pandit on Tuesday blamed it on lack of match practice. 

Still a line-up, without the inspiring presence of Tendulkar, is likely to struggle against the redoubtable pace attack of the Aussies led by Glenn McGrath. 

Meanwhile, Sachin Tendulkar on Wednesday gave a prep-talk to Mumbai players on a short visit to the Brabourne Stadium. Vinod Kambli and Agarkar later described his visit as a ?big morale booster? for the Ranji champions. 

?His gave us a lot of encouragement and a big lift to our morale,? Kambli later said. Agarkar echoed his views and said it was an especially big morale booster for the younger Mumbai players.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Narrow win for Pak

 Younis Khan glances en route to his 77 against Zimbabwe in Peshawar on Sunday. Pakistan won by three wickets 

Peshawar: Younis Khan produced a fine all-round performance and guided Pakistan to a painstaking three-wicket win over Zimbabwe in the second match of the tri-series on Sunday. 

He followed a decent display as stand-in wicketkeeper for flu-hit Moin Khan with 77 off 86 balls to set up a second win for the hosts in the meet which also involves Sri Lanka. 

Younis shared a fifth-wicket stand of 114 from 128 balls with Shoaib Malik (80) to rescue Pakistan from 89 for four, chasing a target of 253. 

Zimbabwe did well to stretch the Pakistan innings to 48.1 overs and take three more wickets before flamboyant all-rounder Shahid Afridi put the finishing touches with two huge sixes. 

It was Zimbabwe?s 12th straight defeat since 15 white players rebelled against the Zimbabwe Cricket Union in April accusing it of racism. 

Eighteen-year-old seamer Tinashe Panyangara gave his side a sniff of victory when he removed Yasir Hameed (0), Bazid Khan (0) and Salman Butt (30) by the time Pakistan had scored 48. 

When Douglas Hondo had Misbah-ul-Haq (23) caught behind, the underdogs appeared in control of in front of a capacity crowd. 

Zimbabwe?s early success with the ball followed a disciplined batting performance in which half centuries by Brendan Taylor (73), Dion Ebrahim (71) and a lively 46 from 33 balls by skipper Tatenda Taibu led the visitors to 252 for four. 

Younis and Malik, however, struck the ball to all parts of the park as the limited Zimbabwean attack was exposed once more. 

Malik enjoyed a let-off on 10 when Mark Vermeulen dropped him at second slip off Panyangara but after scoring his sixth ODI half century, he was brilliantly caught at wide long on by Stuart Matsikenyeri inches from the ground. 

Yousuf Youhana fell for 14 with Pakistan just 13 runs short of victory and Younis was run out before the hosts reached their target to seal their second victory over the Zimbabweans in the meet 

Meanwhile, Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer believes Younis Khan can make his mark in future as a one-day wicketkeeper. 

?I knew he could keep well. And Moin being ill gave us the ideal opportunity to try him out today and I think he did an excellent job,? Woolmer said.

 Randhawa optimistic

New Delhi: Former Asian No. 1 Jyoti Randhawa of India believes his experience of playing in the US, Europe and Japan will give him an advantage during next week?s $550,000 Volvo Masters of Asia golf tournament. 

Randhawa says he can ?compete with anyone anywhere? after finishing tied 27th at this year?s British Open at Royal Troon, claiming second spot at the Johnnie Walker Classic, competing in a couple of US PGA Tour events and posting three top-10 finishes on the Japan Tour. 

He is currently third on the Asian Tour Order of Merit and a good show in the season-ending event, will secure him entry in several big tournaments next year. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 ?It would be too early to dismiss us?

Lahore: Indian captain Dilip Tirkey promised to fight back into contention in the Champions Trophy hockey tournament after a 0-4 morale-shattering loss against Spain in their opening tie on Saturday. 

Spain pumped in all the goals in the second half to win the match quite comprehensively at the national stadium, but Tirkey said it was too early to write his team off. 

?This is a young team which has shown its skill in the Test series against Pakistan and Spain. Yes, we have lost the first match, but it would be too early to dismiss us. We have still several matches to go and I am sure my boys will fight back,? Tirkey said after the match. 

Tirkey said his side lost its lung opener because it goofed up the chances that came its way and also committed defensive blunders. 

?Missing chances has been an old problem with us. We paid the price for the lapses,? he said. 

India?s chief coach Gerhard Rach agreed with the captain when he said that India should have scored in the first half itself which could have put some pressure on the Spaniards. 

?We should have scored in the first half. But they managed to hold us. Spain is such a side that it plays its best in the second half and they did exactly the same here,? Rach said. 

Rach declined to comment when asked whether India were missing the services of prolific scorer Gagan Ajit Singh in this elite six-nation tournament. 

Spanish coach Maurits Hendriks said he could not have asked for a better start to the competition. 

?We were not playing in a rhythm in the first half but found our feet on the turf after the break.?

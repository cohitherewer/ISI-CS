 New F1 team

Suzuka: A new Formula One team, Midland F1, will make its debut in 2006, a Russian-backed financial corporation announced on Friday. 

The privately-owned Midland Group, registered in Guernsey but with extensive business links in Russia and the former Soviet Union, said their cars would be built by Italian manufacturer Dallara. 

 The team, to be based somewhere near London, have yet to decide on engines or drivers.

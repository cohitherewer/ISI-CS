Adelaide: New Zealand were forced to endure another demoralising day in the field and then lost two early wickets after Australia declared their first innings of the second Test on a massive 575 for eight. 

At stumps, New Zealand were 56 for two with skipper Stephen Fleming leading from the front on 38 and nightwatchman Paul Wiseman on four. The Black Caps need to score 320 more to make Australia bat again. 

Ricky Ponting called a halt to Australia?s first innings after ten and a half hours at the crease under a hot sun and then unleashed his potent attack in the remaining 22 overs. 

They gained instant reward when Mathew Sinclair stabbed at a Jason Gillespie outswinger to Shane Warne at first slip in the fourth over. It was Warne?s 101st Test catch. 

The other opener, Mark Richardson survived an apparent catch by Darren Lehmann at short leg off Warne before Michael Kasprowicz bowled him in the next over to have New Zealand 44 for two. 

The Australians, resuming at 327 for three, strolled through the morning session without losing a wicket before Justin Langer?s marathon knock ended soon after lunch. 

The little left-hander failed to fully connect with a sweep at spinner Daniel Vettori and lofted a catch to Jacob Oram. 

The 34-year-old opener?s 215 ? his third double-century in his 82nd Test ? came off 368 balls in 499 minutes with 25 fours and three sixes. 

Langer?s other double-tons came against India (223) in Sydney in 2000 and England (250) in Melbourne in 2002. 

It was his third Test hundred at the Adelaide Oval along with his 179 not out against England in 1998 and 116 against South Africa in 2001. He averages 62.5 in 15 innings at the ground. 

Langer?s 20th Test century placed him in illustrious Australian company ? only Steve Waugh (32), Don Bradman (29), Allan Border (27), Greg Chappell (24), David Boon (21) and Neil Harvey (21) have scored more centuries for their country. 

The champion Australian team now holds the distinction of their top-three order batsmen, Matthew Hayden, Langer and Ponting all scoring 20 Test centuries for a combined 60 hundreds. 

New Zealand made further in-roads into the Australian line-up with batting wunderkind Michael Clarke lasting just 16 balls for seven before he was lbw to Vettori. 

Darren Lehmann brought groans from his home-town crowd when he was bowled by Wiseman for 81. Lehmann, who was hoping for his first Test century at his home ground, batted for four hours and hit 10 fours and left the Australians at 465 for six. 

Adam Gilchrist survived a big lbw appeal off Wiseman when he was on two before he was caught and bowled by Vettori for 50 ? his 18th Test half-century. He put on 78 for the seventh wicket with Warne. 

Ponting made the declaration 30 minutes after tea upon the dismissal of Gillespie for 12 off Vettori. 

Vettori, who bowled almost 28 overs unchanged from the River End, finished with five for 152 off 55.2 overs. 

Despite trailing by 519 runs, New Zealand believe they can win and are drawing inspiration from India?s extraordinary victory in Adelaide last year. ?We take a lot of heart from what India did here last year,? Vettori told a news conference. ?If we can get a score of close to 500 and then make Australia bat again under some pressure, we have a really good chance.? 

Australia made 556 in their first innings in the Adelaide Test against India a year ago. India scored 523, then bowled Australia out for 196 and reached 233 for six to win by four wickets.

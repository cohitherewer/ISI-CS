The Telegraph - Calcutta

It was Ronaldinho all the way

Free-Kick

 With his deceptive movements, Ronaldinho catches 

opposition on wrong foot

It was quite an eventful year, the one which is just 

about to pass us by. Otto Rehhagel guided no-hopers Greece to a fairytale triumph 

in Euro 2004, Jose Mourinho?s FC Porto upstaged all European heavyweights to lift 

the Champions League. Then, in the last three months, two shocking on-field deaths 

rocked the game, both victims being Brazilians (Serginho and Cristiano Junior).

But this is not the forum to discuss those tragedies 

and their aftermath. My brief is to pick the top three footballers of 2004 and 

I can straight away say that I am spoilt for choice. After a close study of my 

candidates, I have decided to cast my vote in favour of Ronaldinho. Yes, I quite 

agree with Fifa?s elite panellists who chose the Brazilian as Player of the Year. 

No. 2 on my list will be Ruud van Nistelrooy, followed by Thierry Henry.

What does one look for when making such selections? 

Obviously, the quality of performance has to be of utmost importance. Quality 

with consistency. The other factors to be considered are technical skill, leadership 

qualities, contribution to the team?s cause and commitment to the game.

Ronaldinho doesn?t possess the most intimidating physique, 

nor is he the most striking footballer looks wise. But he has a very special quality 

which marks him out from the others ? a deception in his movements with which 

he often catches the opposition on the wrong foot.

He has loads of exuberance and positive energy, and 

the will to dominate rivals from the middle of a football pitch. He made the switch 

from Paris St Germain to Barcelona only after the Big Two (Manchester United and 

Real Madrid) had rejected him. Determined to show the world that he belonged to 

the top flight, Ronaldinho transformed Barcelona from an inconsistent unit to 

a feared side.

In two and a half years, since leaving an indelible 

mark on the World Cup in Japan and Korea, Ronaldinho has established himself as 

one of the leading attacking midfielders in world football. In fact, I would rate 

him second only to the great Zinedine Zidane in the last 10 years or so.

As far as commitment goes, Ronaldinho has few peers 

among his contemporaries. The fact that his performance-graph is almost identical 

playing for country and club, reflects the man?s refreshing attitude.

The ability to score crucial goals adds to his value, 

while his continued pursuit of fair play gives him a few extra points. Rarely, 

if ever, will you find Ronaldinho diving to claim a penalty or faking an injury 

to kill time.

Moving on to Van Nistelrooy, let me first state how 

shocked I was to find his name missing from the top five in the Fifa Player of 

the Year nominations. Even though Alex Ferguson?s side missed out on a big trophy 

this season, Van Nistelrooy has inspired some pleasing performances with his explosive 

goal-scoring quality for the last couple of years. To me, he?s like a tiger in 

his territory. 

It was clearly noticeable the way Van Nistelrooy took 

up extra responsibility after David Beckham moved to Spain. Indeed, the big Dutchman 

has been a potent force and an imposing figure in the United line-up.

What I like most about this striker is his combative 

nature. In one against two-three-four defensive situations, Van Nistelrooy is 

a champion as he doesn?t yield an inch without a fight. He is a true street fighter, 

a quality, which does sometime land him on the wrong side of the law. But as long 

as he doesn?t overdo it, I have no complaints.

I often ask aspiring kids to study Van Nistelrooy. 

He is an all-round striker with an indomitable spirit. He refuses to be dominated 

by any defence line and that helps him win many matches for his club and country. 

Time without number, Manchester United came back to win matches from absolutely 

hopeless situations riding Van Nistelrooy?s brilliance. 

Next comes Henry. There is no doubt that the Frenchman 

has played a huge role in Arsenal?s success story. A deadly winger, Henry has 

lifted the side time and again with his loping runs and perfect finishes.

 Ruud van Nistelrooy doesnt yield an 

inch without a fight

Gifted with lightning speed and a running dribble 

(he?s now possibly the fastest with the ball), Henry is not one to make much headway 

in a crowded defence. He looks for a free zone and, to his credit, often finds 

it. With just one or two defenders around, he can be absolutely devastating.

Henry?s biggest negative is his repeated failures 

while donning national colours. France wouldn?t have been knocked out in the early 

rounds of World Cup 2002 and Euro 2004 had Henry been able to reproduce even 50 

per cent of his Arsenal form. Also, he?s not as dangerous with his left foot as 

he?s with the right. That?s why he is my No. 3 and not No. 1.

I would be doing a disservice to the game if I didn?t 

mention those who missed out by a whisker. I feel sorry for Andriy Shevchenko 

and Pavel Nedved, who had an excellent year, as did Cristiano Ronaldo, Milan Baros, 

Deco and Kaka.

Having made my choice, I have to say such exercises 

are extremely difficult and, at times, imperfect. There are several unsung heroes 

who are as effective as the Ronaldinhos and Henrys in their own way but fail to 

grab the headlines.

Then there is the visibility factor. In this age of 

satellite television, we get to see top-quality live action sitting in our drawing 

rooms. But exposure is limited to the top European leagues and World Cup/Euro 

action. 

What about Africa, Asia and Oceania? Who can say with 

conviction that there aren?t any footballers scorching these continents with the 

skill and consistency of their ?big brothers??

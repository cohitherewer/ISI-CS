 Pathan injured; Sachin on hold

Chennai: Ashish Nehra comes in for injured Irfan Pathan for the third Test against Australia in Nagpur from October 26. Pathan, who looked clearly out of sorts during Australia?s second innings, had suffered a side strain during the first morning, informed captain Sourav Ganguly. 

Sachin Tendulkar wasn?t included in the 14-man squad, but BCCI secretary S.K. Nair informed that if the maestro passed ?a fitness test two days before the game?, he would be included as the 15th member. 

Sachin, out with a tennis elbow, is undergoing rehab under Dr Anant Joshi in Mumbai and his progress is being monitored by physio Andrew Leipus. ?I?ve got my fingers crossed. I only know Sachin is getting better,? Sourav said. 

The selection committee meeting which lasted more than two hours dealt with a lot of team strategy and gameplan for the next two Tests. Yuvraj Singh?s role in the team came up for critical analysis. Sourav, though, termed the discussion as ?healthy?. 

THE SQUAD 

Sourav Ganguly, Virender Sehwag, Akash Chopra, Rahul Dravid, V.V.S. Laxman, Mohammed Kaif, Yuvraj Singh, Parthiv Patel, Anil Kumble, Harbhajan Singh, Zaheer Khan, Ajit Agarkar, Ashish Nehra, Murali Kartik.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 ?I?m not looking too far ahead?

 - Yes, ?walking? will make things better: Sourav 

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI 

Calcutta: By his own admission, Sourav Ganguly was ?very upset? on losing yet another toss, this time at the Chepauk, on Thursday. Then, with Australia 111 for no loss at lunch, he acknowledged actually having been at his ?wits? end.? 

At stumps, however, the Team India captain was ?relieved.? 

?Where emotions go, I experienced the whole range... In the morning, I had to calm myself saying the toss isn?t everything... In the afternoon, I told myself the next (second) session could change our luck... Fortunately, that did happen,? remarked Sourav, when contacted by The Telegraph at the Taj Coromondal. 

Despite arguably the best day this season, Sourav isn?t taking anything for granted and hasn?t gone overboard. 

?Look, cricket is a cruel game... This Test is just a day old and, so, I?m not looking too far ahead... We will have to take it session-by-session and bat really well,? he pointed out, adding: ?I would have felt much better had we not lost Yuvi (Yuvraj Singh) in the last over...? 

Hasn?t it been a gamble getting Yuvraj to partner Virender Sehwag? 

?I accept that... Yuvi, though, has an excellent record as opener for Punjab and, if I?m not wrong, North... In any case, it?s not the end for Akash Chopra. In fact, I can?t understand why people are talking that way... Both have been around for only a year (in Test cricket) and have a future,? Sourav responded. 

Reflecting on the Australian innings ? the visitors crashed from 136 without loss to 235 all out ? Sourav said: ?They failed against top quality bowling... Anil (Kumble) was superb and, on a good wicket, used the bounce to maximum effect... He has given us batsmen a chance to put Australia under pressure. Of course, we?ve got to bat sensibly...? 

Kumble, who joined the 400 club last week, finished with seven for 48 to inch closer to his next target: 435 Test wickets. 

Sourav added: ?Thanks to this being a home series, I don?t have to make the difficult choice of having to choose between Anil and Bhajji (Harbhajan Singh)... I can play both and, as captain, can?t ask for more from either... Each of the nine wickets they took today brought joy... Every one was special.? 

Not too long ago, it may be recalled, Sourav admitted that having to pick either Kumble or Harbhajan was the ?toughest decision? he has had to make in over four years as captain. 

Incidentally, Sourav revealed that computer analyst Ramkrishna (Ramky, as the players address him) is the one who suggested Team India watch the inspirational Lance Armstrong film on Monday. 

Much remains to be accomplished, but the icon cyclist has already had an influence. 

Postscript: Sourav declined to be drawn into a discussion on three Australians (plus Yuvraj) choosing to ?walk? on the first day. But, isn?t it going to be easier on the umpires if more followed Adam Gilchrist?s example? ?Well, yes... ?Walking? will make things better... However, please don?t ask me what I should be doing...?

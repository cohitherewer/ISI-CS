 Pele shirt to fetch ?100,000

London: The shirt worn by 17-year-old Pele when he scored two goals for Brazil in the 1958 World Cup final against Sweden is set to raise up to ?100,000 when it is sold at auction next week. The blue, short-sleeved, V-necked shirt with Pele?s No. 10 on the back will be sold at Christie?s in London on Tuesday. 

Although Brazil usually wear yellow shirts, they played in their changed colour of blue in the 1958 final so as not to clash with Sweden. The No. 10 shirt Pele wore in the 1970 World Cup final was sold for a record ?157,750 at Christie?s in March 2002 to a telephone bidder. 

Among the other items for sale is the shirt worn by Roberto Baggio when he missed a penalty in the shootout in the 1994 World Cup final.

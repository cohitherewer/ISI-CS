 Full Speed wins thriller 

 WILLIAM TELL

 Mysore: Ably ridden by Ms Silva Storai, the I. Ghatala-ward Full Speed landed the 2,000m Poonawalla Mysore Derby on Sunday in thrilling finish. The victory of the 5-1 third favourite, however, did not come easy.

 The Burden Of Proof-Speedy Beauty son was always in the hunt ? kept third or fourth behind Ministrel Heights, Berlioz and Staranzano till 300m from home. It was, however, in the final 100m that Full Speed unleashed superb acceleration to snatch the verdict by a long neck. The season, which ended on Sunday, also saw trainer Robert Foley and jockey Suraj Narredu emerge champions.

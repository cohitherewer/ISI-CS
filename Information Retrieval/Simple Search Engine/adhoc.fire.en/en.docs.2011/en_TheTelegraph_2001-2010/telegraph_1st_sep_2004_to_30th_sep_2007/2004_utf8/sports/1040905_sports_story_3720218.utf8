 ICC cautions Bari 

 Wasim Bari 

London: Pakistan chairman of selectors Wasim Bari has been warned by the International Cricket Council (ICC) as to his future conduct after his criticism of umpire David Shepherd. 

ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed also told Bari that while he would not face disciplinary action on this occasion, the global governing body was determined to close a loophole in its regulations that had seen him escape punishment for his unacceptable behaviour. 

Bari slammed experienced English official Shepherds performance during Pakistans 17-run defeat against Australia in the triangular final in Amstelveen last Saturday. 

He called for the 63-year-old to retire after he judged Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq caught behind and Yusuf Youhana caught bat-pad, two key decisions in a tight game. 

Shepherds umpiring decisions were like target killing and cost Pakistan the final. Its time for the inaccurate Shepherd to retire, the former wicketkeeper and Pakistan captain said in Karachi. 

But in a copy of a confidential letter dated September 3 from Speed to Bari, the Australian makes clear the ICCs anger at his comments. 

Speed, who labelled Baris remarks inflammatory and told him he was out of order, referred to clause 2.4 of the ICCs Code of Conduct which makes it an offence to pass public criticism or inappropriate comment on a match related incident or match official. 

Punishments for breaking this clause are the equivalent of between 50 per cent of the player or officials match fee up to their full match fee and/or a one Test match or two one-day International match-ban. 

You will be aware that a number of players and team officials have been charged under this clause in recent years, Speed wrote. 

He added the clause made no specific mention of selectors but stressed: It is my view that it is strongly arguable that it is sufficiently wide to encompass a selector and, in particular, the chairman of selectors of a member country. 

I understand that the PCB proposes to charge you under its own Code of Conduct in relation to the comments that you made about umpire Shepherd. 

Please note that the ICC chief executive has a wide power and a clear duty to lay charges under the Code of Conduct where it is appropriate.

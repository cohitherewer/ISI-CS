The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Kartik prefers bouncy tracks

Hyderabad: Still basking in the glory of his good show against Australia in the Mumbai Test, left arm spinner Murali Kartik said on Sunday that he prefers to bowl on bouncy wickets. 

Kartik, who came into the team as a third spinner, said he was quite confident of bowling the ball at the right place, which eventually fetched success though India were defending a small total. 

The Railways player, who made early inroads during Australia?s second innings, said getting crucial breakthroughs had boosted his morale and kept him going. 

?Getting Ricky Ponting and Damien Martyn in one over was very satisfying,? the left-arm spinner said. 

On the much-maligned Wankhede pitch, Kartik said, ?it was bouncy and had carry. Making the ball turn, though, depends on the ability of the bowler.? (PTI)

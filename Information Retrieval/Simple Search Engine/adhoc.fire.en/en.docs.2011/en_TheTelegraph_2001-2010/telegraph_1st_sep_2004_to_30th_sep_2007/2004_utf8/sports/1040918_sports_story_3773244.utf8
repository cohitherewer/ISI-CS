 Sofia: Uefa announced a new anti-doping programme in an effort to step up its fight against doping. Speaking to journalists after a two-day meeting of its executive committee on Thursday, Uefa chief executive Lars-Christer Olsson said the new programme would allow an increase in the quantity and frequency of doping tests carried out in the organisation?s competitions, including at youth level and in women?s soccer.

 Uefa?s executive body also agreed on the participation of the Champions League winner in the new Fifa Club World Championship on an invitational basis only. Olsson also criticised the level of refereeing at the Athens Olympics, saying it was ?not up to standards?.

 Valencia: Valencia fans still upset over a penalty decision that went against their side last season have succeeded in bringing a case against the referee to court. Real Madrid snatched a 1-1 draw with Valencia at the Bernabeu in February when referee Pedro Tristante Oliva awarded a controversial injury-time penalty for a Carlos Marchena push on Real striker Raul.

 The decision created a storm in Spain, with Valencia officials describing the decision as a joke and commentators across the country openly accusing Spain?s football federation of bias in favour of Real Madrid.

 Seoul: International Olympic Committee vice-president Kim Un-yong had his jail sentence for corruption charges reduced by six months to two years at an appeal hearing on Friday. Kim?s contribution to world sports and to the greater worldwide acceptance of Taekwondo was recognised by the court in reducing the term, a South Korean court official said.

 The 73-year-old was originally sentenced to two and a half years in jail and fined 788.29 million won ($687,900) in June.

 Caracas: Kidnapping and robbery charges against former Venezuelan featherweight and junior featherweight boxing champion Antonio Cermeno were dropped. Judge Yarleny Martin dropped the criminal charges against Cermeno on Thursday, a former World Boxing Association champion, because the alleged victim failed to appear in court, according to a statement issued by a court in the coastal state of Vargas.

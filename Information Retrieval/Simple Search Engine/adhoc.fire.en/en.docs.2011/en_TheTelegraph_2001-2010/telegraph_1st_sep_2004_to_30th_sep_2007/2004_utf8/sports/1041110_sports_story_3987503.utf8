 Fleming to miss opening tie 

Sydney: A viral infection has ruled New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming out of the Black Caps? opening tour cricket match in Australia beginning here on Thursday, the team announced. 

Fleming had been ?suffering from virus symptoms over the last few days? and will not be fit for the warm-up match against New South Wales, it said in a statement. 

He was due to remain in New Zealand until Friday before joining the team in preparation for the first Test on November 18 in Brisbane. 

A replacement for Fleming as captain for this week?s warm-up match will be announced on Wednesday along with the squad to play New South Wales. 

Meanwhile, Craig McMillan was fined 25 per cent of his match fee for showing dissent and swearing while leaving the pitch after he was judged trapped leg-before by umpire Mahbubur Rahman of Bangladesh, during the second ODI in Dhaka on Friday, a Bangladesh Cricket Board release said on Monday (according to Tuesday?s Late City edition). 

Teammate Scott Styris was ?severely reprimanded? for taunting Bangladeshi batsman Mohammed Ashraful after dismissing him. (AGENCIES)

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Junior ?internationals? worry Uefa

 - Arsenal boys give head honchos a tough time 

 Arsenal players celebrate a goal during their League Cup win over Everton on Tuesday 

London: At first glance there was nothing too surprising about Arsenal?s 3-1 victory over Everton at Highbury in the League Cup on Tuesday. 

Everton were beaten 1-4 by Arsenal on the opening day of the season at Goodison Park and Arsene Wenger?s men have lost only once in 19 matches this season. 

But these were not Wenger?s men beating Everton, they were his boys. 

A team of highly talented teenagers and 20-somethings from Italy, Switzerland, the United States and other points east and west came back from conceding an early goal to leave a far more experienced Everton team well beaten inside 90 minutes. 

Wenger?s youngsters also saw off Manchester City?s regular side 2-1 in the previous round. 

Significantly, these victories, come as powerful voices in soccer, are looking again at ways to develop young talent and belatedly return the club game to something approaching clearly defined national identification. 

Arsenal?s juniors reflected the cosmopolitan look of the senior side and that is a trend that worries the authorities. 

Apart from two senior players ? Edu, the 27-year-old Brazilian and Manuel Almunia, a 27-year-old Spanish goalkeeper ? eight of the other 12, who appeared, were teenagers. 

However, only two of those were English. 

Arturo Lupoli, who scored twice, is a 17-year-old Italian, and the other scorer Quincy Owusu-Abeyie is an 18-year-old Dutch striker. 

Defenders Philippe Senderos, 19, and Johan Djourou, 17, helped Switzerland to the semi-finals of the European Under-21 championship. 

There is no doubt that Wenger and his obviously outstanding global scouting staff have assembled some of the world?s finest young players which can only be good for the continued success of his club. 

Already Spaniards Francesc Fabregas, 17, and Jose Antonio Reyes, 21, are first-team regulars while Gael Clichy, a 19-year old from France, has also made a number of appearances as has fellow injured Frenchman Jeremie Aliadiere, almost a veteran at 21. 

There is some room for local talent. Ryan Smith, an 18-year-old left-sided midfielder comes from Arsenal?s home borough of Islington. But he is an exception. 

This is what is worrying Uefa. It is also why German soccer authorities are trying to change their rules on eligibility ? although neither are ever going to be able to turn back the clock in the way they would like. 

Uefa?s executive committee, meeting in Vienna this week, continued their discussions on plans which would stipulate that up to eight ?home-grown? players have to be included in every major club?s first team squad. 

In essence, this is an attempt by Uefa to find a way around the 1995 Bosman Ruling which demolished restrictions on the numbers of foreigners playing in a team. 

The ruling states that any player from within the European Union can play for any club ? and in the nine years since the ruling most major clubs have had fewer and fewer players from their own countries appearing in their colours. 

By bringing in a home-grown policy, Uefa cannot stipulate that all English clubs, for example, must develop English youngsters, or German clubs German youngsters because that would be against EU law ? although this is what they might like to be able to do. 

In reality, however, the likes of Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester United, Barcelona and Real Madrid will just try and catch younger talent from anywhere in the world at ever earlier ages to ensure they become home-grown. 

Although they might well then be developed by Arsenal or Barcelona, for example, they still will be foreign ? even if they were first linked to the club as a 12-year-old, eight-year old or some time off in the future, even before they have learnt how to walk. 

In essence the best players will always end up at the biggest, richest clubs and in the main fans do not care whether the men ? or boys ? winning matches and trophies in their team?s colours were born around the corner from the ground or the other side of the world.

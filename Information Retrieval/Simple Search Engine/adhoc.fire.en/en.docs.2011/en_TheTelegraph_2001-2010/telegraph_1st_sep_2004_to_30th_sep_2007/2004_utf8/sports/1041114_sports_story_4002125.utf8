 Smith to provide the extra spin

Jaipur: South African captain Graeme Smith on Saturday sought to shake-off the ?underdogs? tag in the forthcoming Tests against India, stressing that the youngsters in his squad will rise up to the occasion. 

?On paper we may not be the team to beat but every player coming into the squad has the ability to stand up to the challenges ahead of them,? Smith said on the eve of the three-day warm-up match against the Board President?s XI starting Sunday. 

In a related development, Punjab seamer Gagandeep Singh on Saturday replaced Avishkar Salvi in the Board President?s XI. Salvi had injured his shoulder during Mumbai?s Ranji Trophy opener against Railways in Delhi and is yet to recover fully. 

Smith, meanwhile, found voice of support from Jacques Kallis. ?We have 14 match winners, any one of them could turn up and produce a match winning performance on a given day,? Kallis said. 

The South African skipper said that since his team had only one specialist spinner in Robin Peterson, he would perform the second spinner?s role on turning tracks. 

?Yes, I would like to play my part as a bowler in India. And I would like to pick up wickets, not just be a part-time bowler,? he said. 

The South African skipper agreed that the team had lost momentum in recent months but was expecting to pick up a few lessons from the Australians. 

?We got a bit soft recently. It is important to show the right body language and probably pick up from the intensity the Australians showed in recent months. We will be once again be playing aggressive cricket, which does not necessarily mean swearing at the opposition,? he said. 

Smith said though he was the youngest to captain a Test team, he did not take his role less seriously. 

?I have come up very well, I can?t see myself being a captain as an experiment. I have always looked to playing an important role in South African cricket and I am looking forward to lead the young guys coming into the side all the way,? he said. 

The current tour carries as much significance as did the team?s first visit to India after gaining readmission to international sport more than a dozen years ago. Sunday?s match would provide the visitors the perfect opportunity to start the series on a right note before the Test matches. 

The Board President?s XI, however, will be one tough nut to crack for the visitors, most of whom are too raw and hardly have any or no experience of playing at the highest level. 

Of the 14 players, only Shaun Pollock and Jacques Kallis have been to India before. Adrian Le Roux, the physical trainer who formerly worked with the Indians, might provide some valuable inputs. 

But the deciding factor could well be how the new coach, Ray Jennings, combines with the players. 

Jennings, who was the South Africa?s leading wicketkeeper but missed out on Tests owing to the ban in the 70s and 80s, has the reputation of using innovative methods when it comes to motivating the players. The team has had five days or so during a pre-series camp in Pretoria to come to terms with ?Jennings? ways?.

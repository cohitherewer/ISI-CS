Madrid: Unbeaten Barcelona continued their imperious progress in the Primera Liga when they came from a goal down to beat Deportivo Coruna 2-1 at the Nou Camp on Saturday. 

The win sent the Catalans nine points clear of Sevilla at the top of the table and allowed them to equal their best-ever start to a season with eight wins and two draws after the first 10 matches. 

Sevilla will have a chance of narrowing the gap when they host struggling Real Mallorca on Sunday, while third-placed Real Madrid, who are a further point behind, travel to Malaga. 

Frank Rijkaard?s side still looked to be suffering the after-effects of their exertions in Tuesday?s dazzling 2-1 Champions League win over AC Milan when they fell behind to a fine goal from midfielder Fran in the seventh minute. 

The Depor skipper brought the ball down with his chest and then fired a powerful shot back across the area and into the top corner after former Real Madrid player Munitis had clipped in a neat cross from the right. 

But Barca, who also fell behind to AC Milan in midweek, remained unflustered and with the in-form Xavi at the helm they gradually took control of the midfield. 

Live-wire striker Samuel Eto?o created a host of problems for the Depor defence with his darting runs into the area, while French midfielder Ludovic Giuly was a constant threat on the right. 

A little over a quarter of an hour later they were back on level terms, Xavi slotting in from 10 metres out after Brazilian defender Juliano Belletti had cut back a fine pass from the byline following a quick free kick from Rafael Marquez. 

Barca stepped up another gear after the goal, pinning the visitors back inside their own area as they put together a succession of neatly worked attacks. 

The pressure soon paid off and Eto?o ran the ball into the net to score his ninth goal of the season after Giuly had picked up a miscued shot by Marquez, drawn Depor keeper Jose Molina off his line and slotted the ball into his path. 

Eto?o should have grabbed another after he was put in the clear by Ronaldinho a few minutes later, but this time Molina stood up well and managed to swipe the ball away from his feet. 

Barca had several good chances to stretch their lead after the break. Mexican defender Marquez went close with a diving header and Giuly shaved the post with a low drive.But they had to settle for the 2-1 win which allowed them to equal the start the side made to the 1996-97 season when Bobby Robson was in charge. 

The only negative note of the evening for the Catalans came when Belletti damaged ligaments in his left ankle in the dying minutes after the turf gave way under his feet as he controlled the ball. Barcelona medical staff said the player would undergo tests on Sunday to determine the extent of the injury. 

Serie A leaders Juventus suffered their first loss of the season with a shock 1-2 defeat at lowly Reggina on Saturday. 

The result gives second-placed AC Milan, who host AS Roma on Sunday, a chance to close the gap on Juventus to just two points. 

Reggina took the lead in the 12th minute with a freakish goal as Juve defender Fabio Cannavaro?s clearance hit the onrushing Giuseppe Colucci and looped over keeper Gianluigi Buffon. 

Juve drew level two minutes later when Reggina defender Gaetano De Rosa passed straight to Zlatan Ibrahimovic and the Swedish striker raced goalwards and confidently fired home. 

Reggina, with just one win before the game, grabbed the winner in the 26th minute through an indirect free-kick struck by Marco Zamboni which took enough of a deflection to deceive Buffon. 

After the break Juve?s Marcelo Zalayeta headed against the post and in the 64th minute Ibrahimovic had the ball in the net but the referee had whistled for a foul. Colucci, who had been booked for taking off his shirt to celebrate the opening goal, was sent off in the 73rd minute for a second yellow card. 

Juve looked to have saved the game in the fourth minute of injury time with a smartly taken strike from French substitute Olivier Kapo but after strong protests from Reggina players the referee consulted with his linesman and ruled out the goal. 

In Germany, Bayern Munich bounced back from their bitter Champions League loss to Juventus with one of their best performances of the season on Saturday, crushing Hanover 96 3-0 to jump to second in the Bundesliga. 

Claudio Pizzaro, Roy Makaay and Paulo Guerrero scored to end Hanover?s five-match winning streak and help Bayern forget Wednesday?s last-minute 0-1 loss against Juventus. Makaay?s strike, meanwhile, ended a 600-minute goal drought for The Netherlands forward. 

Bayern are on 23 points, one behind Wolfsburg who crashed 0-4 at Nuremberg. The leaders were already down a goal when they lost playmaker Andres DAlessandro to a red card in the eighth minute.

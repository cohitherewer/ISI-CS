The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Tie abandoned, Lanka in final 

Rawalpindi: Asian champions Sri Lanka secured a place in the tir-series final on Monday after their match against Zimbabwe was called off due to heavy overnight rain, officials said. 

Overnight rain left the outfield wet and some patches on the bowler?s run up at both ends, and conditions did not improve despite determined efforts by ground staff. 

The two umpires ? Australian Simon Taufel and Pakistan?s Aleem Dar ? after a third inspection of the pitch and the surrounding areas at 1:00 pm local time decided to abandon the match. 

?We did not want a silly game to be played with wet patches because safety of the players was most important,? umpire Taufel said. 

Moin joins team 

Experienced wicketkeeper Moin Khan has rejoined the Pakistan team after recovering from a severe viral illness. 

The 33-year-old veteran of 217 one-day Internationals and 68 Tests, missed the last two matches of the tri-series against Zimbabwe and Sri Lanka because of the chest infection. 

?Moin is now fit and has resumed training with the team,? Pakistan manager Haroon Rasheed said on Monday. 

Younis Khan has been filling in for Moin. (Agencies)

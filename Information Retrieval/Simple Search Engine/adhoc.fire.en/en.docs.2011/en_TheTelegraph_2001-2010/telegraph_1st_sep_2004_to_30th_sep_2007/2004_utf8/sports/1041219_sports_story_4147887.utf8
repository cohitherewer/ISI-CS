 BMFC to meet TFA in final

A CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Speedy and enthusiastic Tata Football Academy (TFA) overcame nine-man Titanium 1-0 in an action-packed semi-final of the 16th Lal Bahadur Shastri Memorial football meet here on Saturday. 

TFA now meet Bengal Mumbai Football Club (BMFC) in the title clash on Monday. They have a chance to avenge their 1-2 defeat against the Mumbai-based club in a group B league match held on December 13. 

Despite repeated attacks, both teams struggled to find the net. After an eventful first half, TFA scored the winner in the 57th minute through substitute midfielder Bimal Minz, younger brother of former TFA player and junior international Satish. 

Two Titanium players were shown the red card in the last quarter of the match. Stopper back K.P. Shabeer earned two yellow (for body checks on TFA?s Vimal Periyar). Later, K.P. Nizar was barely on the field for ten minutes before being shown the red card for a tackle on TFA?s central defender Harmanjot Singh.

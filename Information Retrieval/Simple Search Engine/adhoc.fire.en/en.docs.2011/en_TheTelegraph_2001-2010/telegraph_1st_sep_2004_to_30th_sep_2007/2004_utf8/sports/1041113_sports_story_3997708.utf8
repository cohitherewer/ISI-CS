 Vaughan can?t wait for series to get over

London: England captain Michael Vaughan says he cannot wait for his team?s controversial tour of Zimbabwe to be over. 

Vaughan, one of four senior players offered the chance to miss the trip, leads a depleted team to Zimbabwe for five one-day Internationals before heading for South Africa. 

?I did not want to pass the buck by not going,? he said. ?It?s not a tour I?m particularly looking forward to. I?m looking forward to it being over and getting to South Africa for a real tough Test series.? 

Vaughan?s squad flies out to Namibia on Monday to prepare for the one-day series in Zimbabwe, which starts on November 26. 

?I think it is clear we are taking a stance by going to Namibia to prepare,? Vaughan said. ?We just want to get over there, get it done and get to South Africa.? 

The first of five Tests against South Africa begins on December 17. (Reuters)

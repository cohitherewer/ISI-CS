 Subhas Bhowmick has come a long way 

Free Kick 

P.K.Banerjee

 The key to Bhowmicks success is a willingness 

to always stand by his players 

It was 31 years ago that a young striker made his East Bengal debut under my coaching. I made him sit out the first two matches and took him off after he scored in his maiden outing. He was the rebellious type and though he didn?t tell me anything, I knew he was fuming inside.

 In his next appearance, after a one-game gap, he was over the moon after scoring a hattrick. I congratulated him and asked him to thank his colleagues. He was taken aback and asked me why the hell should he thank his teammates. I had to explain to him that in a team game one can?t excel without others? help and then only did he speak to the likes of Habeeb, Akbar and Surojit Sengupta.

 I am talking of Subhas Bhowmick. What a long way he has come! The sight of Bhowmick, a thoughtful and mature coach, gives me great satisfaction.

 The season is just halfway through, and Bhowmick?s men are already looking quite formidable. The red-and-golds missed out on the IFA Shield, but more than made up for that lapse by bagging the Calcutta league and the Durand Cup. East Bengal seem to be warming up nicely for a crack at their third successive National Football League (NFL).

 It didn?t look all that rosy for East Bengal at the start of the season, though. They had lost Junior and Musah, two foreigners who played a key role in their dominance last season. Bhaichung Bhutia got injured and had a long lay-off. The defence-line lacked solidity. In short, East Bengal looked a pale version of the team that made a mark not only in the country but in the continent as well.

 I can vouch that most other teams in their position would have slided further downhill, but it didn?t take Team East Bengal too long to rediscover its customary flair and form.

 How did they turn it around so quickly? I will put it down to two factors. Firstly, the ?East Bengal culture? which helps overcome all hurdles and binds officials, coaches, players and fans in one thread. And, of course, the role played by Bhowmick.

 There?s bound to be some factionalism, politics and discontentment in any big organisation. Quite often, it rocks the very foundation on which the organisation stands. I can say from my experience that football has been ruined in more than one reputed institution because of infighting among self-centred, egoistic, power-hungry officials.

 Even East Bengal club has faced difficult situations over the years but never has the game been allowed to suffer. The secretary may have had differences with the coach, the coach may have had problems with some players, yet there has always been one calming influence who has guided the ship ably through troubled waters. 

 This has been possible mainly because of the fact that all those involved with the club sincerely believe the institution and the game are bigger than the individual. They share a rare bondage which prevents any serious destruction.

 There?s no better example of this spirit than the current coach. When he took over the reins of the team about three years ago, he had a vision. How single-mindedly and purposefully he has pursued his goal!

 Of course, Bhowmick wouldn?t have been half as effective without the cooperation of club officials. Starting from his demand of a foreign physio to the idea of arranging camps in five-star hotels, the establishment has backed the coach to the hilt despite struggling to make both ends meet at times.

 The key to Bhowmick?s success is a willingness to stand by his players at all times. That?s how he gets the best out of his team. And when the occasion so demands, Bhowmick doesn?t falter in cracking the whip. For example, he faced flak from all quarters for dropping his best player Douglas in the IFA Shield semi-final against Mohun Bagan.

 Only later did I realise that it was a well thought-out ploy. Douglas was getting too big for his boots and Bhowmick wanted to teach him a lesson. East Bengal lost that game but Douglas got the message and it helped the team in the long run.

 East Bengal are on a roll, yes, but the Federation Cup won?t be a cakewalk for them. There are a few rough edges to be smoothened out, which can be done only after the Federation Cup. 

 The team needs a goal-getter who can convert one out of three chances. Someone like Ernest Jeremiah, along with a fully-fit Bhaichung, may be handy in tandem with Malsawmtluanga and Alvito D?Cunha. With Dipak Mondal having slowed down, Bhowmick should also be on the lookout for a big-bodied defender. And I don?t like the idea of Syed Rahim Nabi as a left-back. He has good speed and scoring ability, but lacks defensive quality.

 The Federation Cup is an important tournament, but the ultimate target should be the NFL. I?m sure Bhowmick will convince the club to get the right reinforcements for the big battles ahead.

 Before signing off, I can?t help sparing a thought for the Chinese. They got knocked out of the World Cup qualifiers despite winning by seven goals! This is the second time fate has delivered them such a cruel blow, and yet they haven?t raised a voice of dissent. Quite remarkable.

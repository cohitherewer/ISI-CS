 Bangalore police have no plans to question Pal

 Subrata Pal 

Bangalore: Police have no intention of summoning 

Mohun Bagan goalkeeper Subrata Pal for investigation even as questions continue 

to pour in about his hand in the death of Dempo striker Cristiano de Lima Junior. 

Police commissioner S. Mariswamy said he was convinced Pal had no role in Junior?s death on the field during the Federation Cup final, here on Sunday. 

?We are not going to ask him (Pal) any questions. Nobody has said that the goalkeeper deliberately attacked Cristiano. Not even Dempo?s coach Armando Colaco. His complaint talks of foul committed by Pal and not an assault or attack. 

?Football is a body-contact game and often players crash into one another. The goalkeeper?s act was not an offensive one to harm the player. It is up to the professional body (AIFF) to take action against the goalkeeper on the foul committed,? Mariswamy told this correspondent. 

The police commissioner said he watched a video recording of the final and perused the autopsy report submitted by doctors. 

?The report says cardiac arrest was the cause of death. We will wait for the histo-pathology report of the heart to decide whether this sudden arrest was caused by drugs or sheer excitement,? Mariswamy remarked. 

He, however, said investigations will continue against Karnataka State Football Association (KSFA) over negligence and lack of medical facilities at the Kanteerava Stadium. ?We learnt that Junior was taken to Hosmat Hospital because KSFA has a contract with the hospital for providing medical care.? 

Meanwhile, referee Maheswaran Balu and match commissioner 

M.G. Suvarna sent in their reports on the tragedy as well as the match to All 

India Football Federation (AIFF) secretary Alberto Colaco. Their findings were 

kept under wraps because of an inquiry ordered by AIFF president Priya Ranjan 

Das Munshi.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Bagan hold the edge

 - DURAND CUP 

- East Bengal to miss key players 

NOVY KAPADIA

 Subhas Bhowmicks presence will lift the boys spirits 

New Delhi: The 117th Durand final will be a clash of titans as Calcutta giants East Bengal and Mohun Bagan get ready for showdown. This is the 13th time the two glamour outfits will vie for honour in final. 

Their last meeting in the final of India?s oldest tournament was a decade ago in 1994. On that occasion Bagan won with Jo Paul Ancheri scoring the match winner. 

Ancheri and Dulal Biswas are the only survivors from that final. Both are now with Bagan, but in 1994 Dulal was with East Bengal. 

Of the 12 previous occasions (including two replayed finals), both Mohun Bagan and East Bengal have won the trophy four times while they were joint winners twice. 

This will be fourth meeting between the clubs in the current season with the green-and-maroon brigade having a 1-0 advantage over their rivals with two other matches being drawn. 

The teams are yet to win a single trophy this season and Bagan coach Subrata Bhattacharya acknowledged ?pressure will be great as pride and reputation is at stake.? 

Despite problems in both teams, Mohun Bagan look to have the edge. All their players are fit and they have a better bench strength as compared to East Bengal. Moreover, Tomba Singh, Dharamjit Singh, Eduardo Coelho and Jerry Zirsanga look to be in good form. 

Injuries and off-field incidents have deprived the red-and-gold outfit of some key players. Assistant coach Bikash Panji admitted that Syed Rahim Nabi?s (out with two yellow) speed will be sorely missed. Also Dipak Mondal (injured knee) and Climax Lawrence (swollen ankle) are doubtful starters. Debjit Ghosh recovering from a knee injury and Chandan Das (groin strain) are also not fully fit. 

However, what can turn the tide is the availability of coach Subhas Bhowmick, who left for the capital on Tuesday afternoon. Bhowmick, who was ill and couldn?t travel with the team earlier, will have to use all his tactical acumen to thwart the opponent. 

Key midfielders Douglas da Silva and Alvito D?Cunha were a pale shadow of themselves in the semi-final against JCT and they need to lift their game on Wednesday if the national champions are to make a match out of it. 

It will be interesting to see how the two Nigerian strikers, Ernest Jeremiah (East Bengal) and James Ugwo (Mohun Bagan) play. Both started with a bang but faded in the semis. A good performance from them will be eagerly awaited by the clubs. 

The match will be shown live on DD Sports from 2.15 p.m.

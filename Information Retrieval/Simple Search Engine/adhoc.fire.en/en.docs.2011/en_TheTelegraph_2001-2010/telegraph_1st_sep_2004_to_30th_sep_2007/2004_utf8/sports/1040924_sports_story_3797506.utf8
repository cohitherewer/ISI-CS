 Tough task for Indians

Karachi: After a disastrous campaign at the Athens Olympics, a depleted India will have to play out of their skins to put it across Pakistan in the opening match of the four-Test hockey series starting here on Friday. 

The Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) announced a new-look team keeping an eye on the future, but its move to rebuild the side could get a serious beating at the hands of Pakistan. 

India coach Gerhard Rach has promised that his young team would do its best in the series, but the visitors? best effort may not be enough to stop the home side from continuing their dominance. 

?Don?t expect much from us because we are in a rebuilding stage, but we will do our best to be serious opponents for Pakistan,? Rach said on his team?s chances in the series. 

But it would be not an easy task for the Indians to even pose a serious challenge to the Pakistanis, who have a new captain in Waseem Ahmed after Muhammed Nadeem retired from international hockey following the Olympics. 

The absence of five regulars who were part of the team in the Olympics ? Dhanraj Pillay, Baljit Singh Dhillon, Gagan Ajit Singh, Deepak Thakur and Prabhjot Singh ? is likely to have its effect on India?s performance in the series as they will be playing with a new forward-line to be led by inexperienced Arjun Halappa and Adam Sinclair. 

The last time the two sides featured in a bilateral series was in 1999 when they played nine matches ? four in India and five in Pakistan. Pakistan won the series 5-3 with the match in Rawalpindi finishing in a 3-3 draw. 

But captain Dilip Tirkey, a veteran of three Olympics, was not perturbed by the past records. 

?We know it would be a tough task but we have players who have played in Pakistan at junior level and won the Asia Cup. So it would be an opportunity for them to click at the highest level. I know they would not let go this chance.? 

Tirkey said India would have to grab the chances that come their way to beat the Pakistanis. He was also aware of the necessity to stop penalty corner expert Sohail Abbas, the highest goal-scorer in Athens, who has proved himself to be India?s nemesis on a number of occasions. 

?Sohail is their main goal-scorer. He has got terrific scoring abilities. We would be looking to stop him by not allowing Pakistan win too many penalty corners,? the 27-year-old defender said. 

Despite having some top players in their ranks, Pakistan skipper Waseem Ahmed said he was not taking the rivals lightly. 

?Yes on paper we are much stronger, but anything can happen on the hockey field. Even if you are very good and start taking your opponent lightly then you should be ready for surprise,? Waseem said. 

He said his side was determined to continue its domination over the arch-rivals. 

?I am sure that we will be able to continue our domination against India if we continue giving our level best.?

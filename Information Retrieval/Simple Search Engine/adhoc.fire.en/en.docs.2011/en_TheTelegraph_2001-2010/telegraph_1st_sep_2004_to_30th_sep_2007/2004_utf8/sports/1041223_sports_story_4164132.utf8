The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Laxman rescues Hyderabad

Hyderabad: Propelled by an elegant 79 by Test star V.V.S. Laxman, Hyderabad scored 233 in their first innings against Punjab who were reeling at 25 for 3 in reply on the first day of the Elite B Ranji Trophy match at Gymkhana grounds on Wednesday. 

Putting to rest the controversy over the cricket board ?resting him? for the one-day series in Bangladesh, Laxman showed his style, elegance and hard hitting tactics scoring with 13 fours off 102 balls. 

Laxman was severe on Amit Uniyal whom he hit for four fours, three fluent cover drives and one cut to the point fence, before the bowler was taken off. 

V.R.V. Singh proved to be the most effective bowler for Punjab claiming seven wickets in 16.4 overs giving away 75 runs while R. S. Sodhi took the prize wicket of Laxman and Ambati Rayudu in quick succession to bowl out the hosts for 233. 

Hyderabad speedsters N.P. Singh and Vishnuvardhan soon hit back with vengeance and swung the ball to take three quick wickets as the visitors plunged to 25 for 3 at stumps. 

Put in to bat, Hyderabad openers Daniel Manohar and Anirudh Singh gave a steady start, countering the Punjab pacers who moved the ball exceptionally well, before Singh (7) returned to pavilion when the total was 28. 

Daniel did not last long with V.R.V. Singh dismissing him caught by skipper Pankaj Dharmani in the slips for 21 which brought cheers to the well gathered crowd with Laxman taking guard. 

Laxman and Vinay Kumar then steadied the innings adding 73 runs for the third wicket before Kumar became the third victim of V.R.V. Singh after a well made 28. 

In Ahmedabad, Gujarat managed to score 207 for four wickets on the opening day of the four-day Elite B Ranji Trophy match against Madhya Pradesh.

Rio de Janeiro: South America?s World Cup qualifying race remained wide open after Wednesday?s three matches were drawn, leaving all ten teams still in with a chance of reaching Germany in two year?s time. 

Brazil were frustrated by Colombia?s ultra-defensive tactics as they were held to a goalless home draw in Maceio, while Argentina were hustled out of their normally elegant stride in another 0-0 stalemate in Santiago. Earlier, a second-half Nolberto Solano penalty gave Peru a share of the spoils as they held Paraguay 1-1 in Asuncion. 

The results, which followed another goalless draw on Tuesday between Bolivia and Uruguay in La Paz, mean that Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay stayed on course for three of four guaranteed South American places in Germany. 

Meanwhile, Italy and Portugal recovered from weekend setbacks to register contrasting victories on another busy European night of World Cup qualifying on Wednesday. 

Italy, who lost their first World Cup qualifier for 11 years in Slovenia on Saturday, edged Belarus 4-3 while Portugal, held to a draw by Liechtenstein, bounced back in style to thrash Russia 7-1. 

There were also wins for France, England, the Czech Republic and the Netherlands while Andorra and Liechtenstein made history with their first-ever World Cup qualifying successes. 

Francesco Totti, Italy?s Euro 2004 villain when he was sent home in disgrace for spitting, was back in their good books on Wednesday with two goals, one a penalty, in the action-packed Parma clash. 

Daniele De Rossi and Alberto Gilardino were also on target but Belarus kept hitting back, helped by two brilliant Maxim Romashchenko goals, before the visitors ran out of time. 

Slovenia came back to earth with a 0-3 defeat in Norway leaving both teams with seven points, two behind leaders Italy. Portugal, still stinging from the criticism of a 2-2 draw with Liechtenstein, enjoyed a stunning 7-1 victory in Lisbon. 

There were two goals each for Cristiano Ronaldo and Armando Petit ? the latter?s both in the last two minutes ? while Pauleta, Deco and Simao Sabrosa were also on target as the Euro 2004 runners-up joined Slovakia at the top with 10 points. 

Saturday?s draw was Liechtenstein?s first-ever World Cup qualifying point and they followed up on Wednesday with their first win when they thrashed Luxembourg 4-0 away. 

The Netherlands trailed to Teemu Tainio?s early goal for group I pacesetters Finland in Amsterdam, but levelled through Wesley Sneijder and won it with two goals for striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, returning from a two-match ban. 

France, held 0-0 at home by Cyprus in their opening qualifier, found a way past the islanders in the return game as Sylvain Wiltord and Thierry Henry secured a 2-0 win to kickstart their group IV campaign. 

England laboured to a 1-0 victory in a wind-lashed Azerbaijan, Michael Owen heading the only goal after 22 minutes. 

Poland are only a point behind after they hit three goals in the last 20 minutes to come from behind and beat Wales 3-2 in Cardiff ? their third successive three-goal away win. 

Denmark and Turkey, the group II favourites, cancelled each other out with a 1-1 draw in Copenhagen to allow Ukraine to climb into top spot courtesy of a 2-0 home win over Georgia. Sweden and Bulgaria enjoyed 4-1 wins in Group VIII, the Swedes winning in Iceland with two goals for Henrik Larsson and Bulgaria coming from behind to beat Malta helped by two for Dimitar Berbatov. 

Spain remain in a real scrap with three games gone in group VII. They were held to a goalless home draw by Lithuania and remain third on five points behind Lithuania on goal difference and Serbia and Montenegro, who thrashed San Marino 5-0 to move top with seven.

London: Real Madrid stormed back from a two-goal deficit to beat AS Roma 4-2 while teenager Wayne Rooney scored a hattrick on his debut in Manchester United?s 6-2 win over Fenerbahce on a dramatic night of Champions League action on Tuesday. 

Altogether, eight matches produced 31 goals with Bayern Munich crushing Ajax Amsterdam 4-0 as Dutchman Roy Makaay scored a hat-trick against his compatriots. 

Dynamo Kiev beat visiting Bayer Leverkusen 4-2 in another high-scoring game in which the German side finished with 10 men. Ukrainian substitute Andriy Voronin scored just before the hour mark but was then sent off after 83 minutes. 

Elsewhere, Monaco failed to get close to their 8-3 win over Deportivo Coruna last November but still picked up three points with a 2-0 home victory against the Spaniards in Group A. 

Olympiakos Piraeus beat Liverpool 1-0 in the same group, although the Greek side were down to 10 men after Anastasios Pantos was sent off eight minutes from time. 

Olympiakos ? who last beat an English club almost 32 years ago ? top Group A with four points after two matches, followed by Liverpool and Monaco on three, and Deportivo Coruna with one. 

Kiev?s victory over Leverkusen followed the three points they picked up after Uefa awarded them a 3-0 win in their opening game against AS Roma, which was abandoned when referee Anders Frisk was hit by a missile two weeks ago. 

Kiev now top Group B with six points while Leverkusen and Real Madrid have three each. Roma are bottom with none. 

Juventus beat Maccabi Tel Aviv 1-0 in Turin thanks to a first-half header from Mauro Camoranesi. They are second in Group C behind Bayern Munich. 

Manchester United pulled ahead in Group D thanks to their storming win at Old Trafford over Fenerbahce and they have four points from their opening two matches. Lyon also have four points from two games after coming from behind to defeat Sparta Prague 2-1 away. 

Tomas Jun gave the home side the lead after seven minutes but Lyon hit back with a Mickael Essien equaliser in the 25th minute and a winner from Sylvain Wiltord after 58 minutes. 

Real Madrid proved there is still life at the Bernabeu as captain Raul scored twice to take his overall European tally to 47 goals and lead a heroic fightback. Real romped home 4-2 over AS Roma in a Champions League group B match on Tuesday. 

Real, in crisis after three defeats in four games and the shock departure of coach Jose Antonio Camacho, were in even deeper trouble when Daniele De Rossi put the Italians ahead in the third minute and Antonio Cassano doubled the lead in the 22nd. 

Raul chipped in from the edge of the box to get the home side back into the game six minutes before the break, Luis Figo scored from the penalty spot and then set up Raul for his second and Roberto Carlos blasted in the fourth 10 minutes from time. 

Raul?s tally (47) in the Champions League is now two short of Alfredo di Stefano?s all-time record in the European Cup. 

The Roma players only had themselves to blame this time after squandering the two-goal lead handed to them by a Real side who were looking a nervous wreck. 

The first came in the third minute, when Real failed to clear a corner and let in De Rossi to take a lofted through ball from Traianos Dellas and clip it past Iker Casillas. 

Real, their pride stung, started to attack with a bit of purpose but with Zinedine Zidane playing at half pace on his return from a shoulder injury, they lacked the finesse to unlock Roma?s defence. 

Roma were going forward only half heartedly themselves but Francesco Totti?s astute pass wrong-footed the home defence in the 22nd minute, Simone Perrotta touched the ball back and Cassano shot in off the post. 

Crucially, Real managed to claim a goal back before the break, when Raul swept the ball over Ivan Pelizzoli from the edge of the box. 

Roma should have restored the two-goal lead when Cassano jinked inside the box and crossed for Christian Panucci to head wide at the far post. (REUTERS)

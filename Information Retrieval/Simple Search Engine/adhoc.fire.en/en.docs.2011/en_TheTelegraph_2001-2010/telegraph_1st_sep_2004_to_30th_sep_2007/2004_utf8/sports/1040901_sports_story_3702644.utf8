 Sourav hoping for batsmen to hit form 

 - NATWEST CHALLENGE 

- Michael Vaughan pins hopes on Steve Harmison 

 Sourav hopes the wicket will assist batsmen, and Vaughan will continue to bat at No. 3 

Nottingham: Indian captain Sourav Ganguly feels it is only matter of time before his batsmen return to their vaunted form, hopefully in the next seven days of the NatWest Challenge one-day series against England. 

I admit we didnt play well in two games in recent past. Either you look at it or you look at how the team has performed in the last two years, said Sourav ahead of Indias first one-dayer against England here on Wednesday. 

India came a cropper in the last two games against Pakistan in Sri Lanka and in Holland. The Indians would be without the services of Sachin Tendulkar in this three-match series . 

Sourav also did not think the team needed to be flexible in the batting order as is the case with Pakistan. 

I really feel the instance of Shoaib Malik coming in at No. 3 is not the right comparison. Malik is a proper batsman, probably the best in Pakistans line-up. He is better than most of their other batsmen, said Sourav. 

Sourav rued the lack of good allrounders in the team 

and said even though he has allrounders in the spin department, what he needed 

were medium-pacers who could hold their position as batsmen also. 

We have spin allrounders in the team men like Sehwag and Tendulkar can turn their arms over. But we dont have medim-pace allrounders in domestic cricket. Till they come along, we would have to go with depth in batting order. 

Sourav praised the England side for the way it has 

performed in Tests and said even though they have new faces in one-day cricket, 

they are not unknowns in world of cricket. 

There are new faces in England team but we have played against most of them. Some you havent played against, you have watched them on television. This is the advantage of television these days. 

They have done fantastically well in Test matches. Any team which wins 10 out of 11 Test matches can claim to an outstanding achievement. 

Sourav has had good outing in Test matches at this venue and hoped the wicket would continue to assist batsmen in the one-day game. 

Its always been a good batting wicket. I hope there are enough runs in it. But we have to raise and play well in the next seven games to get our confidence back. 

England skipper Michael Vaughan says pace sensation Steve Harmison has enough ability to trouble the talented Indian batting line-up. 

Over the last one year he has turned out to be a real world class performer. He showed in the summer that he is going to be a big threat with the white ball. If he gets it right, I am pretty positive he could put the Indian batsmen under some pressure, remarked Vaughan after his sides gruelling practice session here on Tuesday. 

Vaughan, however, is not ready to take it easy against the Indians, who according to him still have a batting side as good as any in the world, notwithstanding their slump in Sri Lanka and Holland. 

Their records speak for themselves, they have a huge amount of experience. They are very exciting to play against. We need to make early inroads to find any weakness in their batting. 

Vaughan admitted his one-day squad has not performed to the level to which his Test team has done and put it down to too much chopping and changing in the playing eleven. 

In Test sides we have a bit more experience, in one-day team we had a few swap and changes. You always have a strategy when you play together. When we play together you would see an improvement. 

As long as we learn from our mistakes, we can move forward. 

The England skipper also confirmed that he will continue to bat at No. 3 and Vikram Solanki, who lately has been in very good form, will open the innings.

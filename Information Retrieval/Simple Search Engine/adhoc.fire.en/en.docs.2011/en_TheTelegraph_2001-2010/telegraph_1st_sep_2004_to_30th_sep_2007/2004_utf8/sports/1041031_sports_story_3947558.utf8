The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Humpy shocked, eves 9th 

 - CHESS OLYMPIAD 

- Indian men beat Bulgaria, record best-ever finish 

 Abhijit Kunte scored the last victory for India 

Mallorca: Indian eves ended a mediocre ninth following another defeat against 27th seed England in the 14th and final round of the women?s section of the 36th Chess Olympiad that ended at Gran Casino here. 

India lost 1-2 after Koneru Humpy was shocked by Harriet Hunt and other two matches were drawn. 

Chinese women, who had already won with one round to spare, completed the formalities of their back-to-back victories after beating Slovakia 2-1 in the final round. 

Indian men, however, beat Bulgaria 2.5-1.5 for their best-ever sixth place finish while Ukraine won the title (as reported in Saturday?s Late City edition). 

With Abhijit Kunte scoring the last victory for the team in this Olympiad against Ivan Cheparinov, Indians wrapped the issue against Bulgaria with other three boards ending in draws in the final round. 

In the women?s section, the Chinese finished with 31 points out of a possible 42 and three points ahead of silver medal winners the US, who trounced Vietnam 2.5-0.5. The bronze went to Russia. 

Seeded sixth at the start of the event, a bad finish in the last few rounds brought Humpy and Co. to the very ordinary finish. The last round came as a shocker as Humpy ran out of steam against Harriet Hunt and lost a keenly contested game. 

The remaining two Indian games ended in draws albeit after intense struggles. On board two, S. Vijayalakshmi drew with Jovanka Houska while Richards Heather held D. Harika to a creditable draw. 

Worthy winners 

Ukraine became the worthy winners in the men?s section after they took their overall tally to a very impressive 39.5 ? three points clear of Russia and Armenia. 

As the ties were resolved Russian men won the silver medal on account of better points scored by their opponents 460 compared to 459 scored by the Armenian challengers in the marathon event. 

The fourth place went to US after a stupendous 3.5-0.5 victory over Cuba in the final round that helped them move to 35 points, half a point clear of Israel that finished fifth. 

Starting as the fifth seeds, the Indian men eventually finished sixth that can by no means called a bad finish given the kind of oppositions they faced. This was, in fact, the best Indian performance ever as the team bettered its previous best of finishing eighth at Istanbul in the year 2000. 

World rapid champion Viswanathan Anand was held to a quick draw by former world junior champion Kiril Georgiev of Bulgaria who played black. The victory for India came on board three when Kunte proved that he was capable of delivering goods with white too. 

On the other two boards the Indians had easy draws with K. Sasikiran not letting Alexander Delchev nurture his advantage a great deal while Sandipan Chanda had it easy against Vasil Spassov.

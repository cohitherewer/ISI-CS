 Triumphant WI return home

 Brian Lara 

Bridgetown: The West Indies arrived home to cheering fans, celebrating their surprise victory in the ICC Champions Trophy in England and recalling the devastating hurricanes that inspired them to win. 

?We all lay in our beds very comfortably while our people in the Caribbean were fending for their lives,? captain Brian Lara said. 

?It was the catalyst for this very young team for what they achieved in England over the past three weeks.? 

Hurricane Ivan killed nearly 70 people in the Caribbean ? 39 in Grenada alone ? while Jeanne was responsible for the deaths of more than 1,500 people, mostly in Haiti. Lara, manager Tony Howard and the team arrived in Barbados after their victory by two wickets over England in Saturday?s final at The Oval in London. 

The team arrived at Grantley Adams international airport and was met by Teddy Griffith, president of the West Indies Cricket Board, and government and other cricket officials. Former West Indies players, led by legendary allrounder Sir Gary Sobers, also greeted them. 

Darren Sammy, 20, the youngest member in the squad, was given the honour of leading the team off the British Airways flight carrying the trophy over his head. 

Hundreds of airport employees, some carrying Barbadian flags, took time off to greet them. (AP)

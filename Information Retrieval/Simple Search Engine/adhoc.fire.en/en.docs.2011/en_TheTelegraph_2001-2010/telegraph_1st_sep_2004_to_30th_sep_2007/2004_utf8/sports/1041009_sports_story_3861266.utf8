The Telegraph - Calcutta

 We paid the price for misses: Bhowmick 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick said that his team paid the penalty of missing ?too many chances? in the defeat against Mohun Bagan on Friday. 

He tried out to put up a bold face saying the loss would not affect his team in the long run. Neither did he think that Paolo?s failed spot-kick and Rajat Ghosh Dastidar?s ejection from the match had any ?significant influence? in the match. 

?One team wins, the other loses. This is part of the game. I don?t think we played so badly. In fact, we created quite a number of chances and had those been converted we would have emerged the winners,? Bhowmick told the post-match press conference. ?We should have finished the match within 90 minutes,? he added. 

Mohun Bagan coach Subrata Bhattacharya didn?t attend the press because of a throat problem. His assistant, Shyamal Banerjee, however, criticised the referee for awarding the penalty against his team. 

Meanwhile, Mohun Bagan president Swapan Sadhan Basu, who lost his father in the morning, came to the ground and cheered his team before leaving midway.

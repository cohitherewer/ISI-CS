 Speed is the key: Popat

New Delhi: National womens champion Aparna Popat says upcoming shuttlers should start working on their speed if they want to make a mark on the international scene. 

There is a vast difference in the style of play here and on the international circuit. We have worked a lot towards body strength but still we are very slow compared to the top countries, she said. 

The 26-year-old is currently ranked 24th in the world and was the only Indian to qualify directly for the just concluded Athens Olympic Games. 

The Bangalore-based shuttler put up stiff resistance against eventual silver medallist and fourth seed Mia Audina of The Netherlands in the second round but was made to bite the dust 9-11, 11-1, 11-3. Popat, who fought her way back to take the first game after trailing 6-9, was definitely unhappy over the final outcome. 

My game plan did not work in the next two games. I lost the plot, said Popat, who had defeated Michelle Edwards of South Africa in the first round. 

On what needs to be done to bridge the gap between the domestic and international level, Popat said, it is essential that the coaches closely study the game of the leading players and try and bring necessary changes in the style of play of the youngsters. 

Echoing Popats views, former national champion and top mens player Abhinn Shyam Gupta said the Chinese play with at least double the speed of Indians. 

But it will be wrong to say that Indian shuttlers should overnight chance their style to challenge them. 

It is difficult for us to do it since we are not trained that way and it may lead to injuries. 

But the youngsters can start training that way from the beginning and it will surely help, Gupta said.

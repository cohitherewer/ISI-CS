The Telegraph - Calcutta

Sourav impossible to fluster

Stump Vision

Ian Healy

I love contests that continuously confuse an Indian 

crowd and the second Test is high on my list of favourites. The Indian team displayed 

resilience from the first afternoon on a wicket which looked as if it would break 

them, not to mention the rampaging Australian openers. In India, the pattern has 

been that the Australians dominate the first Test but thereafter it is an open 

battle. 

It is struggle, scratch and scrape your way through 

every session for either side. A mouth-watering proposition for the spectators 

but sleepless nights for some of the players at least, I?m sure.

The match-saving performances in this Test belied 

just how tough it must have been in the middle. Anil Kumble, Virender Sehwag, 

Shane Warne and Damien Martyn, unfortunately, did not get the chance to see their 

efforts win the Test for their sides. 

I hope both Sehwag and Martyn do it again because 

they are a pleasure to watch. Both are smooth movers on the pitch, stroke players 

of simplicity and grace. Both men have had their form questioned this year and, 

I believe, unfairly. The game today demands better performances more often than 

in the past and what a shame it would be to rest match-winners because of hiccups.

Martyn put my mind to rest during the tour to Sri 

Lanka this year. He was in a slump all of last Australian summer, had a perceived 

difficulty with spin having grown up on the bounce of Perth and yet was the mainstay 

time and time again, against the might of Muralidharan.

So Martyn?s knock in Chennai did not surprise me at 

all. It merely impressed me again and when he was ready to set a proper total 

for India?s second innings, having played catch-up for hours, he was gone. How 

quickly it happens in India, which should remind everyone watching just how carefully 

each ball has to be treated.

Bowlers like Warne and Kumble can and do turn matches 

upside down at times. Other than statistically, where they share remarkable tales 

of performance and longevity, I see these two men as opposites. Publicly Kumble 

is seen as humble, courteous and under-stated. His real ability may well be controlling 

the tough, irritable and sometimes cranky demeanour we have heard about but rarely 

witnessed. Warney, in contrast, displays the combative, chatty nature and hides 

his softer side. He too is polite, charitable and fun. Both men were tireless 

in Chennai, reaping rewards, and I still think you will see more from Shane.

Sourav Ganguly, as a captain, held things together 

quite well when India were on the back foot. He is impossible to fluster, outwardly 

anyway, and he is confident in his players? abilities. He has some world-class 

strikers now but he better get through some of the workload himself very soon, 

before he wears them out. Laxman and Yuvraj also look heavy on their feet and 

bogged down in thought.

Adam Gilchrist has earned his three or four days of 

rest. The world?s toughest wicket-keeping conditions, batting pressure and as 

captain, directing a game that goes all the way is too much for anyone. 

Even in the good form they are in, Australia wobbled 

under pressure which shows how tough this series is. It is to be seen which side 

cracks first in this battle of nerves. (PTI)

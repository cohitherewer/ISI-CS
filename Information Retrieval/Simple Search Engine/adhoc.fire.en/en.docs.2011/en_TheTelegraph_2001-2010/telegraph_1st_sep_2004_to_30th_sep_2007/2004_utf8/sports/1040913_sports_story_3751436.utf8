 BCCI grants Jharkhand full membership

Chennai: Jharkhand State Cricket Association (JSCA), in place of dissolved Bihar Cricket Association (BCA), has been extended full membership by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) after a unanimous decision at its special meeting Sunday. 

Announcing this at a press conference, BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya said the meeting also decided to nominate board officials to visit the associate member states before full membership was extended to them. 

?After three working/playing seasons, an associate member would be promoted to be full member of the board. For this, the board will send its observers to the states concerned to assess their cricket activities and development,? he said. ?In future, applications from the central controlling board of a state will only be entertained by the board.? 

JSCA president was a happy man. ?I am very thankful to the BCCI, particularly to Mr Dalmiya, for having sorted out the Jharkhand affiliation issue,? Amitabh Choudhary said. 

The meeting also passed a constitutional amendment in respect of tenure of secretary, joint secretary and the treasurer bringing it down from ?five years to three years.? (PTI)

 Dedication scores upset victory in Irani Trophy 

 HONKY DORY

 Mallesh Narredu

 Less-fancied Dedication, from Ms Arti Doctor?s yard, scored an easy victory over another rank-outsider, Zafferano, in the 1,400m N. M. Irani Trophy, the main event at the Mumbai races on Thursday. The odds-on favourite Real Beauty placed a faraway fourth. Mallesh Narredu partnered the winner, a two-year-old, by Tirol out of Compassion, to two-length-plus victory. 

 The Vallabhdas H. Adwalia Trophy was also claimed by a 7-1 shot, Shadowfax. A. R. Mani guided the Dr Anil Kumar-trained five-year-old to a shade under a length victory over the favourite Passion.

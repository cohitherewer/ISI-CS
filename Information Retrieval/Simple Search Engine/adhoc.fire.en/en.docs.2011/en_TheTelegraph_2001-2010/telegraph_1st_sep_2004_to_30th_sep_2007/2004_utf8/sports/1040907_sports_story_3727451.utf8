Rio de Janeiro: Uruguay put their World Cup qualifying campaign back on course with a controversial 1-0 win over Ecuador on Sunday, while Chile and Colombia shared four red cards and no goals in a grim encounter. 

Brazil eased past Bolivia 3-1, a first-minute Ronaldo goal thwarting the visitors plans to frustrate the world champions with a packed defence, while Paraguay defender Carlos Gamarra added to his Olympic silver medal by scoring the winner against Venezuela. 

Brazil lead the ten-nation South American group with 16 points from eight games as the marathon tournament nears its halfway stage. Argentina, 3-1 winners over Peru on Saturday, follow with 15 and Paraguay on 14. 

Chile are next with 12 and only four points separates them from ninth-placed Colombia (8), with Ecuador, Venezuela and Uruguay (all 10) and Peru (9) sandwiched in between. Bolivia (6) prop up the table. 

The top four qualify directly for Germany and the fifth plays off against the Oceania region winners either Australia or the Soloman Islands for another place. 

Uruguay, beaten in their last three qualifiers, bounced back in Montevideo to win with a 58th minute Carlos Bueno header which was palmed away by goalkeeper Edwin Villafuerte only for the referee to rule the ball had crossed the line. 

Brazils match in Sao Paulo was a happier affair especially after Ronaldos lightning strike, his seventh goal of the qualifiers. 

Ronaldinho made it 2-0 from a penalty in the 13th minute and Adriano headed the third just before half-time. Bolivia goalkeeper Leo Fernandez bravely kept Brazil at bay in the second half with some outstanding saves while Luis Cristaldo, a survivor from his countrys last World Cup appearance in 1994, pulled one back.

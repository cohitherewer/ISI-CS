Houston: Marat Safin overpowered Tim Henman 6-2, 7-6 Friday to reach the last four at the Masters Cup, setting the stage for two mouth-watering semi-finals involving the world?s top-ranked players. 

Roger Federer, Andy Roddick, Lleyton Hewitt and Safin, all 24 or under, all current or past world number ones and all with Grand Slam titles to their credit, will now take to the court. 

It will be the first time the top four seeds have qualified for the semi-finals of the season finale since 1990 when Stefan Edberg, Boris Becker, Andre Agassi and Ivan Lendl battled for the title. 

?Those guys probably have separated themselves (from the rest),? Henman told reporters. ?Maybe I wouldn?t put Federer in the same bracket as the other three, he?s had such a superb season.? 

World No. 1 and defending champion Federer will face Russian Safin, the form player coming into the $ 4.45 million showcase event. 

?It will be quite difficult, you have to do something special against him (Federer), he is so far from all of us,? said Safin. ?You have to wait for small chances because you won?t get any big ones. 

?I?ve played him many times, six times, but the way he is playing this year, with confidence, to beat him will be very tough. A little bit of luck would be great.? 

Hewitt booked his semi-final spot earlier in the day with a 6-2, 6-1 demolition of French Open champion Gaston Gaudio of Argentina, who had already been eliminated. 

In contrast, Safin, the winner of back-to-back Masters Series events in Paris and Madrid, and Henman, the oldest player in the eight-man field and the only one without a title this season, stepped on to the floodlit centre court at the Westside Tennis Club with everything to play for. 

Safin, who is coached by Swiss Federer?s former mentor Peter Lundgren, wasted no time wrestling control of the first set, breaking Henman on his opening service game. 

The big Russian held his own serve and then continued to pressure Henman, taking him to break point again in the next game. 

Henman weathered the second Safin storm but continued to struggle with his serve and soon found himself down another break at 5-2 and running out of options. 

The 30-year-old Briton raised his game in the second set but was never quite able to penetrate his opponent?s defences, Safin fighting off two break points and then overwhelming Henman in the tiebreak 7-2.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Gavaskar undecided on continuing with Team India 

 - There are whispers that Wright probably isn?t happy with ?recent developments? 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Mumbai: Former captain Sunil Gavaskar, who spoke of his job as the Team India consultant ?evolving over a period of time,? is actually undecided on continuing. 

Gavaskar?s appointment, made just 36 hours before the ongoing series against Australia got underway, is till the end of the fourth and final Test here. It has been a disastrous four weeks and it remains to be seen if that influences Gavaskar. 

For his part, Gavaskar told The Telegraph: ?My mind isn?t made up... I?ll have to look at other commitments before deciding one way or the other.? 

When reminded that the next engagement ? the one-off ODI versus Pakistan ? was only days away, Gavaskar replied: ?But that?s not a Test... The next (first against South Africa, in Kanpur) is after a fortnight...? 

The ODI is on November 13, while the Test begins a week after that. 

Gavaskar, by the way, is going to be off to Dubai hours after the scheduled close of the current Test. ?I?ve got to chair the ICC?s Cricket Committee meeting there on November 9-10,? he informed. 

According to a senior Board official, ?the ball is in Gavaskar?s court.? President Ranbir Singh Mahendra, though, has already gone on record saying the Board has a ?larger role? in mind for Little Master No.1. 

Incidentally, there are whispers that coach John Wright probably isn?t happy with ?recent developments.? Obviously, Gavaskar?s presence has undermined his position but, where the Board is concerned, his ?contract? is till the end of this season. 

As a source observed: ?It doesn?t quite help anybody when different voices attempt to be heard (in the dressing room)...? Perhaps, we?re in for very interesting times. 

Off-the-field, that is.

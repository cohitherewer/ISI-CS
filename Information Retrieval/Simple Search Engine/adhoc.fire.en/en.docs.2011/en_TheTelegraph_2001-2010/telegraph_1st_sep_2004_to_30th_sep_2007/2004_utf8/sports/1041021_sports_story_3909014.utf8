 Walking a ?fad?, more than honesty

 Atherton accuses Aussies of double standards 

London/Sydney: To walk or not to walk? The debate, once conveniently divided into hemispheres, has reopened. 

Traditionally Englishmen walked when they knew they were out. Australians waited for the umpire?s decision. 

As always the reality was more complicated and in the modern game few batsmen of any nationality leave the crease voluntarily. 

All of which make the events in Chennai last Thursday even more striking. 

On the opening day of the second Test against India, acting captain Adam Gilchrist and Jason Gillespie departed immediately after obvious edges. To the open amazement of English umpire David Shepherd, who had just turned down an appeal, Michael Kasprowicz also headed for the pavilion. 

?There?s no team policy,? explained Gilchrist. ?It?s an individual thing about how you want to play the game. But it?s rubbing off. It?s got to be a positive thing for cricket.? 

?Today that situation came up and something inside me said ?walk?. So I went.? 

The debate over the so-called new Australian ?walking fad? continues. Former England captain Michael Atherton adds this fad ?will end in tears? for the Aussies and even accused them of double standards. 

While commending the decisions of Adam Gilchrist, Michael Kasprowicz, Jason Gillespie and Indians Sourav Ganguly and Yuvraj Singh to walk in the second Test, Atherton said the players would become prisoners of their actions and were now duty bound to keep walking. 

?After all, selective walking is really just about conning the umpire into believing you are an honest man and so benefiting from such a reputation.? 

Atherton said walking opened the Australians to ?accusations they have been far from consistent on this tour.? He said in the first Test Irfan Pathan and Parthiv Patel were victims of poor caught-behind decisions when the men behind the wicket should have known neither batsman touched the ball. 

Atherton also questioned why Australian players in front of the wicket appealed for an lbw decision against Virender Sehwag in Bangalore after a blatant inside edge and why, if the spirit of fair play meant so much to the Australians, the batsman was not recalled. 

?How far are they prepared to go? Or, as Ian Chappell said when I asked him for his reaction: ?Hypocrisy is alive and well.?? 

Former Australian captain Allan Border commended the actions of the players, but fell short of endorsing the trend in his column. 

?I believe, as do many others, that umpiring decisions tend to even themselves out over the years,? Border said. 

?I am of the opinion that just as the batsman and bowlers have a job, the umpires have a specific job of making decisions and it is best to leave it to them. 

?But if both of the teams have indeed entered into an agreement of walking and as long as everyone involved honours it, it?s fine.? (Agencies)

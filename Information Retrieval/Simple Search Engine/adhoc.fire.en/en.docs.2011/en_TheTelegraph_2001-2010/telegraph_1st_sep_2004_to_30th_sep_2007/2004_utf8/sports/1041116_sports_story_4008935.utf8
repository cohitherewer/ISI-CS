Calcutta: Arup Basak proved too hot for Indranath 

Bhattacharya as the top seed and defending champion raced to the men?s singles 

title-clash with a facile semi-final victory in the state table tennis championships 

at Netaji Indoor Stadium on Monday. 

Arup will meet Amit Mukherjee in a repeat of last year?s final. Amit accounted for Souvik Basu Roy in straight games 11-3, 11-7, 12-10, 17-15 in the other semi-final. 

The women?s singles final will pit Mithu Pal of Siliguri against Hooghly?s Rajarshi Sha. Mithu got the better of Ria Dasgupta 11-5, 11-6, 7-11, 11-6, 11-7. 

But the semi-final between Rajarshi and her district-mate Sayantika Kundu saw a highly engaging battle with the former prevailing 11-6, 5-11, 12-10, 10-12, 5-11, 11-6, 11-9. 

Sayantika negated Rajarshi?s first game lead with some well-executed shots down the line. She again had to pull up her socks in the fourth game to make it 2-2. 

When Sayantika took the fifth game and raced to a 4-1 lead in the sixth, it seemed all over for Rajarshi. 

But Rajarshi kept her cool and took full advantage of a series of unforced errors committed by her opponent as she took the last two games to finish off the challenge. 

Such competitiveness was hardly visible in Arup?s 11-3, 9-11, 11-6, 11-2, 11-8 demolition of Indranath. Both are old horses in the circuit, but Arup?s attack and deft cross-court returns were in full flow. 

Despite conceding the second game, the defending champion was otherwise hardly troubled by Indranath and rightly claimed the match and a place in the final. 

Meanwhile, Pritam Bose beat Raj Mondal 11-5, 12-10, 11-8, 11-4, 11-8 to claim the sub-junior boys? title, while Monalisa Mukherjee mastered Krittwika Sinha Roy 12-10, 11-4, 11-1, 11-4 on her way to the sub-junior girls? crown. 

Krittwika, however, salvaged some pride winning the cadet girls? title, while the boys? went to Priyobrata Das. 

Anubhav Kundu and Srijita Mukherjee crowned themselves as the nursery boys? and girls? champions, respectively.

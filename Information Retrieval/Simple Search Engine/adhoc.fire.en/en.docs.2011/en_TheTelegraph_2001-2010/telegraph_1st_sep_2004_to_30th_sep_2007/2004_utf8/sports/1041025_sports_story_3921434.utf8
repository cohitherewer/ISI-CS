 No excuses to offer: Nayeem 

 A CORRESPONDENT 

New Delhi: Coach Syed Nayeemuddin?s comeback with the Bengal team, after eight years, ended in disaster. In his last stint with Bengal, Nayeem became the only coach ever to have won the Santosh Trophy thrice in a row, from 1994 to 1996. However, in the 1-2 defeat against Services on Sunday, his substitutions, verbal tonic and tactical gambles all flopped. 

For instance Kalyan Chaubey, who flew in a couple of days ago, was not even in the squad for the match. When first-choice goalkeeper Abhijit Mondal injured his shoulder during Services? opening goal, Nayeem had to use rookie ?keeper Subrata Pal in the second half. 

Glum-faced Nayeem later said: ?We played badly and lost. I have no excuses to offer.? Trying to explain the defeat, he also said, ?we conceded soft goals due to defensive errors. Just before the half time my stoppers (Debkumar Sasmal and Madhab Das) stopped as Abhijit came out to collect the ball. As the ball slipped from his hands there was no covering and Services scored easily. 

Abhijit?s injury and subsequent replacement further upset the coach?s plans. This was visible when he could not bring in young striker Vimal Pariyar. Debjit Ghosh, who joined the team on Sunday morning, was tried as a central midfielder early in the second half. 

Nayeem, however, admitted that Debjit had not fully recovered from his knee injury and lacked mobility. 

About the fragility in defence, Nayeem said: ?I had no options. I did not want to risk playing Habibur Rahman Mondal as he is recovering from a head injury and so would have been weary of heading. Also except for Debabrata (Roy) all my defenders had an off-day.? 

Still Nayeem felt that his team could have salvaged a draw, if the forwards had not been so wasteful. ?We kept missing chances even in the dying minutes.?

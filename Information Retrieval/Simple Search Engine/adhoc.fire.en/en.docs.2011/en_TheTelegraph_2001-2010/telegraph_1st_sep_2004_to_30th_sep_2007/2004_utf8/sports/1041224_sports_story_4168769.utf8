Bikaner: WGM Dronavalli Harika continued with her winning ways and outplayed compatriot Saheli Nath in the third round of the girls? section of Asian Junior chess championship on Thursday. 

Harika now leads the tables with Hoang Thi Bao tram of Vietnam who capitalised on a simple oversight by Kruttika Nadig to romp home in her third round game. 

Both Harika and tram have three points apiece and they are followed by N. Raghavi who is a half point behind. 

The top three boards in boys? section ended in draws. Nguyen van Huy of Vietnam shot into sole lead with an attacking victory over Akshayraj Kore. Huy is followed by second seed IM M. R. Venkatesh, IM S. Poobesh Anand, Abhijit Gupta, S. Arun Prasad, former winner IM Deepan Chakravarthy and Arghyadip Das, who all have 2.5 points in their bag. 

Harika was in her element yet again. Playing the white side of a King?s Indian, the Andhra girl made mince meat of Saheli in all departments of the game. 

Up against the classical setup, Nath found herself at sea in the middle game as her position collapsed on the queen side. Through a tactical stroke, Harika picked up a piece and the rest was child?s play. 

Kruttika Nadig fell prey to a simple tactical trick involving double attack against tram. Having got a tangible position against the Petroff defence, she missed a simple check that cost her a pawn and tram made no mistakes to win the resulting endgame.

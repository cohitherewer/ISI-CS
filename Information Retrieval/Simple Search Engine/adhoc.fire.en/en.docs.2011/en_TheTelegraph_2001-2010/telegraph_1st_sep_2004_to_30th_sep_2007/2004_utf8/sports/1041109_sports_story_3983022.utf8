 Retief Goosen pips Tiger Woods to title

Atlanta: Retief Goosen recovered from a four-shot deficit to fire a final round 64 and hold off Tiger Woods and Jay Haas in the $6 million Tour Championship at East Lake Golf Club on Sunday. 

In similar fashion to his victory at the US Open this year, the South African played methodically to hit 17 of 18 greens in regulation and made the necessary putts to take a one-stroke lead at the turn. 

Third round co-leaders Haas and Woods took time to get their games going on Sunday. Woods made three bogeys and Haas two before they eventually carded birdies on the par-five ninth hole to move into a tie with Goosen. 

Over the last nine holes Goosen continued his assault, making three more birdies while Woods and Haas could not come close to matching him. 

Woods eventually finished second at seven-under-par with a two-over 72, four shots behind Goosen. 

First round co-leader Jerry Kelly was six-under through 11 holes, eventually shooting a five-under 65 to finish in third place at six-under. 

Canadian Stephen Ames, Australian Mark Hensby and Canadian Mike Weir finished tied for fourth at five-under. 

Vijai Singh?s bid to win his 10th event of the PGA Tour season failed as he finished in ninth place at three-under after a final round 65. 

After overtaking Haas and Woods at the turn, Goosen went into overdrive. He made three birdies between the 13th and 16th to run away from the rest of the field. ?The only thing you couldn?t do was give those guys hope by coming back,? Woods said. 

?Jay and I both did that, and consequently we gave the guys a chance to come from behind, and ?Goose? took advantage of it and just played a great round of golf.He did absolutely everything he needed to do, post a number, and hopefully it would be good enough, and it was.???I didn?t quite think I was going to win by four...? said Goosen. 

?I got off to a good start, two-under through three holes, and I probably thought that I had to shoot 11-under or 12-under to have a chance at winning today. 

?Then, walking up No. 7, I saw that Tiger and Jay were down to seven-under, so then I knew that probably nine-under could win this tournament.? 

Goosen, 35, has won five times on the PGA Tour and his latest victory moved him up to sixth on the money list with $3,885,573, the most he has earned in his four years on the circuit. 

?I?ve won good ones and I probably had my chances to win a couple more... but I?m getting more and more comfortable out there now, getting to know the golf courses, as well, that we play,? Goosen said. ?I know which ones to pick and know the ones I like. I can work my schedule out that way so I?ll give myself more chances.?

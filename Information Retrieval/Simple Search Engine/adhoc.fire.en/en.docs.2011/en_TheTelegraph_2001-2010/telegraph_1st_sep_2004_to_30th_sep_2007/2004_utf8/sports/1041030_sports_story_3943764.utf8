 London: Bolton Wanderers midfielder Khalilou Fadiga will visit a heart specialist in Belgium after fainting before a League Cup match on Wednesday.

 The Senegal international, who underwent surgery to correct an abnormal heartbeat in May, was given the all-clear after being taken to hospital. He collapsed during the warm-up before the 3-4 defeat by Tottenham Hotspur.

 ?We have put him on a plane to his specialist in Belgium,? Bolton manager Sam Allardyce told his club?s website on Friday. ?Khalilou came out all-clear from the hospital but as a precautionary measure we have sent him to his surgeon to check him over and give us an opinion. ?It is too early to link his fainting to the heart problems. The specialist who knows the full case history can sort it out.?

 Newcastle: Newcastle manager Graeme Souness wants to persuade striker Alan Shearer to postpone his plans to retire at the end of the season. Captain Shearer has scored eight goals this season and his efforts have helped Newcastle remain unbeaten in the nine games since Souness succeeded Bobby Robson as manager last month.

 ?I think that Alan is enjoying his football at the moment because he?s scoring goals and the other thing is for the team to be doing well,? Souness told reporters on Friday. ?Those things are very important to him and if we get into the New Year and he?s still enjoying it then I will be trying to persuade him to stay. He is a realist and he knows that the clock is ticking for him but at the age of 34 he is still the first player out on to the training ground every morning and he is a pleasure to work with.?

 Berlin: Former Manchester City goalkeeper Bert Trautmann, who played on during the 1956 FA Cup final despite breaking his neck, will be presented with the Order of the British Empire (OBE) by Queen Elizabeth in Berlin next week. The 82-year-old German will receive the award for his efforts to improve German-British relations.

 Trautmann, who came to England as a prisoner of war, joined Manchester City in 1949 to the fury of fans.

 Season ticket holders threatened a boycott and 40,000 people marched on the streets to protest the signing of an ?enemy? soldier so soon after World War Two.

 London: The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) has postponed its hearings with American sprinters Tim Montgomery and Chryste Gaines, charged with serious doping violations. The hearings were due to start in San Francisco next Monday.

 ?The new hearing dates will be announced as soon as they have been fixed,? CAS said in a statement on Friday. The statement gave no reason for the postponement.

 Cheste (Spain): Spain?s Sete Gibernau claimed provisional pole for Sunday?s season-ending Valencia MotoGP in the first official qualifying session on Friday.

 Gibernau, who is assured of finishing runner-up to Valentino Rossi in this season?s championship, clocked 1:33.531 on the four-km circuit, just three thousandths of a second ahead of fellow Honda rider Makoto Tamada of Japan. Italy?s Rossi wrapped up his fourth consecutive world title at Phillip Island earlier this month. He was third fastest on his Yamaha to complete the provisional front row of the grid.

 Mumbai: Fifteen teams, including Pakistan and Germany, will vie for top honours in the first ever World Cup kabaddi meet to be here from November 19 to 21. The winning team will get Rs 2 lakh, while the runners-up will take home Rs 1.25 lakh. The semi-finalists will get Rs 50,000 each.

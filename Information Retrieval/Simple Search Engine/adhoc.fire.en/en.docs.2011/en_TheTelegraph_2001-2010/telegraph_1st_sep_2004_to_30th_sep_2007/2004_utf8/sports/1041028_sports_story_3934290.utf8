 Action begins at the RCTC today 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Action resumes at the RCTC ground on Thursday after about a fortnight?s break. The 30-day fixture during the five and half-month cold weather season has been designed to ensure better fields to market the RCTC brand of sport. The city racing has been going through a bad phase and everything now hangs on the live broadcast of the RCTC racing to the other turf centre in the country. The expensive venture may turn out to be a make-or-break endeavour but the club is sanguine that it will help RCTC?s financial cause.

 They have also tried to make the season?s prospectus an attractive one. Of a total 224 races marked for the season, 96 are going to be trophy events. It means, every alternate race on each day is expected to be a trophy event. 

 The trophies bonanza may have been designed to lure the outstation owners, but it is the prize money which they fall for and not trophies. But the stake money remains stagnant at about Rs 3.1 crore ? virtually the same as last winter.

 However, RCTC has more plans in store which the club may announce only in Friday?s media-conference which had to be rescheduled owing to non-availability of stewards because of Puja holidays.

 The Thursday-card may be dominated by trainer Vijay Singh?s wards. In the six-event card, Vijay?s Reminiscent, Mega Role, Almara, Thrilling Proposal and Alashaan run with a good chance winning their respective events. If the monsoon season form of Thrilling Proposal and Almara have been very impressive, Reminiscent, Mega Role and Alashaan are sitting pretty at the weights in their events. Vijay may start with a bang.

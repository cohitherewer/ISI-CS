Calcutta: Ankita Bhambri bagged her maiden ITF women?s circuit crown, winning the Tata Steel-sponsored meet at the BTA Complex on Saturday. 

Delhi girl Ankita, seeded No. 2, saw off Thailand?s sixth seed Wiliwan Choptang 6-3, 7-5 in an hour and three-quarters. 

Choptang had her revenge later, as she and Shruti Dhawan clinched the doubles title at Ankita and Sanaa?s expense. The fourth-seeded Indo-Thai pair took 85 minutes to beat the Bhambri sisters 6-2, 7-5. 

The singles final looked headed for a quick finish as Ankita raced to 5-0, breaking the Thai girl in the second and fourth games. 

The Indian served two double-faults in the seventh to drop serve for the first time, but broke again to seal the first set. 

The second set was a more competitive affair. The Indian again achieved the service-break early, but surrendered the initiative in game 8 with another set of two double-faults. Choptang returned the compliment in the 11th game, a pair of double-faults helping the Indian nudge ahead 6-5. 

Serving for the title, Ankita was hit by that common bug called nerves. Surely the better player in the final, the Indian squandered five match-points before wrapping up the second set (in an hour) and the match.

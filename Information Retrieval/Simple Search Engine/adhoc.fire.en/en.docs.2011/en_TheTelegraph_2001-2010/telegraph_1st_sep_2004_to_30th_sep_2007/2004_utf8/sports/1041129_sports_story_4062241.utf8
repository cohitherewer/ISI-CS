 Monte Carlo: The US have been stripped of their 1,600 relay gold medal from the 2003 world championships after Calvin Harrison?s second doping violation, the IAAF said on Sunday.

 The gold instead goes to France with Jamaica taking the silver and the Bahamas collecting bronze.

 Harrison was found guilty of using the stimulant modafinil at the US championships in June 2003. That was 10 years after he tested positive for another stimulant, pseudoephedrine, during the 1993 US junior indoor championships and served a three-month ban. 

 London: Bolton Wanderers have fined striker El Hadji Diouf two weeks wages for spitting at an opponent, the Premier League club?s website reported on Sunday.

 The Senegal international spat at Portsmouth defender Arjan de Zeeuw during a match on Saturday.

 ?The club does not tolerate such behaviour from its players and we had no alternative but to evoke the maximum fine against El-Hadji Diouf,? Bolton manager Sam Allardyce and chairman Phil Gartside said in a club statement. The 23-year-old Diouf, who is on a season-long loan at Bolton from Liverpool, apologised for the incident. 

 Madrid: Argentine midfielder Fernando Redondo has decided to hang up his boots, six months after ending his injury-plagued spell with Italian champions AC Milan.

 ?I?m retiring,? the 35-year-old former Real Madrid midfielder told Spanish sports daily Marca on Saturday. ?I?ve decided to spend a relaxed year in Madrid, but next season I will go back to work in something related to football and start a new stage in my life.

 ?I?ve received quite a lot of offers to continue playing, but I don?t want to go abroad. I?ve also rejected offers to play in Spain because I can?t wear a shirt that isn?t that of Real Madrid.?

 Redondo was capped 29 times for Argentina.

 Marseille (France): Frenchman Philippe Troussier has signed a two-year deal with fallen French giants Marseille, according to the club?s website. Trousier has been unveiled as the successor to jose anigo who resigned last week.

 However, it remains to be seen if Troussier, the former South Africa, Japan and Qatar coach is able to work his magic with a club which has had close to 15 managers in 10 years.

 ?In accordance with French law, I?ve signed a two-year contract, and I have already outlined my goals with the club,? Troussier said. ?I want to give some pride back to the fans.?

 Troussier will take up the reins at the 1993 European champions next week. 

 Havana: Argentina hopes to bring some of its top soccer coaches to Cuba to help develop the game and make it more popular on the Caribbean island. 

 quot;We want to bring top level soccer coaches such as Valdano, Bielsa to work with our coaches and in schools,? said the Argentine government?s secretary for sports Claudio Morresi. We could also incorporate Maradona but that all depends on his recovery.?

New Delhi: East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick said after the final Wednesday that his team had dedicated their Durand Cup triumph to Sasthi Duley and Dipankar Roy, the two players who are just out on bail after spending a week in jail in connection with their association with a hardcore criminal in Calcutta. 

He said his instructions to his team were to play with big hearts, counter-attack and hope for goals or else to just to defend in depth and frustrate Bagan into making errors. 

He said it was kudos to assistant coach Bikash Panji and the players for overcoming so many hurdles, like injuries to key players. 

A disgruntled Subrata Bhattacharya blamed motivated supervision. ?We were denied two penalties while East Bengal were lucky to get a penalty,? he said. Bhattacharya was also not happy with the attitude and performance of the foreigners in the team. 

?James is out of condition Eduardo got injured and 

so we had to change our gameplan. We dominated, but lost.? A beaming Douglas Da 

Silva said: ?After I conceded the self goal, I felt miserable and prayed to god 

for strength. He heard my prayers and luck was on our side. We won even though 

we did not play very well.?

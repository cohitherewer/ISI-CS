 PCB to reprimand Wasim Bari

Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) will reprimand its chief selector Wasim Bari for his outburst against experienced English umpire David Shepherd. 

Bari will be reprimanded for his statement which was in bad taste, senior PCB official Abbas Zaidi said after Bari described Shepherd as too old and had urged him to retire. 

The former Pakistan captain drew the ire of ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed on Saturday for his statement after Pakistan lost a tri-series final to world champions Australia in The Netherlands on August 28. 

Bari had lashed out after Shepherd gave two contentious decisions against Pakistani batsmen Inzamam-ul Haq and Yousuf Youhana in a low scoring final that Australia won by 17 runs. 

He also said the ICC would ask the PCB to take some punitive action to discourage such behaviour in the future. 

Zaidi said that since the ICC had not taken any harsh action against the chief selector, who is presently in England, the PCB would reprimand him. 

I think Bari became a bit emotional after watching Pakistan lose the final and I think a reprimand would suffice now, Zaidi said. Bari violated the ICC Code of Conduct for players and officials which forbids them from publicly criticising umpires, match officials or any umpiring decision. (REUTERS)

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Surya falls to Hossain

BIPIN SHENOY

 Abhijit Kunte 

Calcutta: Day III of the International Open clearly belonged to IM Enamul Hossain of Bangladesh who upset two Grandmasters on Wednesday. Hossain proved to be a giantkiller as he outwitted compatriot GM Ziaur Rahaman in the morning while stunning GM Surya Sekhar Ganguly in the evening. 

After the fourth round, Hossain is in joint lead with GM Abhijit Kunte on 3.5 points. Hossain already has a GM norm to his credit and stands a good chance of getting his second one here. 

Abhijit had little difficulty in defeating IM Dinesh Kumar Sharma in third round. He then topped it off by claiming GM Dibyendu Barua in the afternoon. In a Catalan opening, Abhijit obtained a strong position as he had a knight firmly posted on d6 which was supported by a pawn. Barua?s pieces struggled to find good squares and to make matters worse for him, Abhijit trapped his queen on the queenside.

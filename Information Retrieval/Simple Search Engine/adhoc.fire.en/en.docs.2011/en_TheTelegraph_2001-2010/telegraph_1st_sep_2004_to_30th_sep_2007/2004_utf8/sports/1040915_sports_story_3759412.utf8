The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Need to put our best foot forward: Lara

 - West Indies team lends helping hand to victims of Hurricane Ivan 

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI 

 Lara feels a full time psychologist is absolutely 

essential

Southampton: From Sir Viv Richards to the less recognised, just about everybody in the West Indies has been calling for Brian Lara?s head. The captain, though, remains unfazed. 

?I?ve got a job and I?m focused on that... Today, my thoughts are on the Champions Trophy... We haven?t been doing very well of late, but it doesn?t help if players get injured and there?s much chopping and changing,? he said on Tuesday afternoon. 

Speaking ahead of the West Indies? tournament opener, against Bangladesh, he added: ?A couple of decades ago, we were the invincibles and people got used to the West Indies winning... So, when the results aren?t good, people get emotional... 

?That, I suppose, is understandable. Also understandable is the call for us to fight... Well, that?s something we intend doing in the Champions Trophy... However, as I?ve pointed out, our team hasn?t been able to settle down. quot; 

Lara, of course, is drawing confidence from having made the NatWest Series final not many months ago. Yet, he isn?t treating Bangladesh lightly, specially as they gave a fairly decent account of themselves in the Caribbean earlier this year. 

Weather permitting, the West Indies? we-have-to-galvanise-ourselves campaign will get underway at the Rose Bowl on Wednesday. 

As Lara explained: ?It?s up to us, really, to put the best foot forward... We do know South Africa thrashed Bangladesh (by nine wickets), but that won?t mean much as it?s going to be a new game here...? 

Was he, personally, under throttling pressure? 

?No... I know this team is at the border of a successful period... Yes, the youngsters find it hard to handle pressure, but there?s no easy way out... The best, I believe, is to learn by the trial-and-error method,? Lara responded. 

Talking to The Telegraph, he said a ?full time psychologist was absolutely essential.? At the moment, the West Indies Cricket Board invites one on a when-in-dire-need basis. 

By the way, in an emotional gesture, the entire team has made a contribution which will be forwarded to the many victims of Hurricane Ivan through the West Indies Players? Association. 

?Some of the guys have families in the affected areas, while almost everybody has friends... It?s a tough period but, hopefully, our performance is going to bring a smile to those who have lost so much,? Lara remarked. 

It?s to be seen what destiny holds for Lara but, clearly, he doesn?t wish to only be remembered as the holder of the two most prized individual records: 501 not out in first-class cricket and an unbeaten 400 in Tests. 

Meanwhile, despite the thrashing in Birmingham, Bangladesh coach Dav Whatmore insisted his team ?wasn?t merely completing the numbers.? 

There are few takers for that, though.

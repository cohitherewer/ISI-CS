 India-Pak will no more dominate, feel experts 

 Oltmans says it?s impossible to repeat the success of yesteryear 

Lahore: Asian powerhouses India and Pakistan are unlikely to ever dominate world hockey as they once used to, feel experts. 

Roelant Oltmans, one of the world?s leading coaches, says the two countries must not think too much about reaching the heights of yesteryears as it was ?simply impossible? for them to do that. 

?People in India and Pakistan always think that their teams will dominate the world again quite like the 1970s where they were beating all the teams comprehensively. But I think this is simply impossible,? said Oltmans, the Pakistan coach. 

The two nations, which dominated the game for decades, winning 11 Olympic and five world titles between them, have been going through a lean phase. Neither country has won a major championship for several years. 

?There are several teams which are very good. Teams like Spain are so good, yet they are improving all the time. Korea, who played in the Olympics, could not get a place in the Champions Trophy. So you can imagine the competition at the highest level? it is very tough,? Oltmans said. 

The downward slide started in the early 80s when both the teams struggled to compete against the European nations. 

India?s last major title came in 1980 when they won the Moscow Olympics in a depleted field, while Pakistan won both the World Cup and the Champions Trophy in 1994. 

The introduction of astroturf has been blamed, in many quarters, for the dip in performance, but according to former Pakistan great Samiullah the fault lies elsewhere. 

?We are unlikely to rule the world again as we have stopped producing world-class players. Blaming the surface is not going to help as those who have quality can adapt to any conditions, be it grass or turf,? said Samiullah who breathtaking speed and flair earned him the sobriquet ?Flying horse?. 

?Unfortunately we don?t have a big pool of players. If you get at least hundred players to choose from, you can make a good team. But if you have just 15-20 good players, you really don?t have any choice,? said Samiullah. 

Both teams carried their indifferent form into the 21st century when they slowly drifted towards the European style of play with Pakistan appointing Oltmans as their first overseas coach and India following suit recently, hiring German Gerhard Rach. 

The change in approach, however, has not yielded any significant result thus far. 

?I believe the decision to adopt the European style is absolutely wrong. It may give success for one or two matches but it doesn?t take them anywhere. They should play their original skilful and attacking game. There is no point in playing what one is not good at,? said former Aussie great Richard Charlesworth. 

Dutch coach Terry Walsh said that the teams must be very careful while following a new style of play. ?Pakistan and India have switched from Asian to European style. But a change in culture or traditional style is like a dangerous animal which should be handled very carefully,? Walsh said. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 I aim for excellence, not perfection: Harper

 - ?My own belief is that we?ve reached the limit (on technology use)? 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Daryl Harper apparently is the only umpire with a website 

Kanpur: Daryl Harper may have been dubbed a villain by much of India when he gave Sachin Tendulkar out leg-before in the Adelaide Test five years ago, but the Australian remains among the most respected of umpires. 

Harper, in fact, has been on the ICC?s Elite Panel since its inception in April 2002. His CV, therefore, is impressive. It?s interesting too ? apparently, he?s the only umpire with a website of his own: cricketump.com. 

?It?s my son (Tim) who suggested I start one and, if I remember correctly, it was launched after the last World Cup... Initially, it was just to communicate with friends and colleagues but, now, cricket lovers even ask questions,? Harper told The Telegraph. 

Speaking on Tuesday evening, he added: ?I hope nobody interprets the website as my seeking to project myself in a larger than life manner... I?m simple guy in a demanding job...? 

The website, by the way, features a diary which Harper updates as often as he can. 

Asked if he ever acknowledged having made a mistake, Harper laughed: ?I won?t put it in black-and-white... But, yes, I could say that X got a bit unlucky or something on those lines.? 

A primary teacher for over two decades, in Adelaide, Harper took to umpiring in a big way a decade ago and joined the Australian Cricket Board (now Cricket Australia) panel in 1997-98. 

?As an umpire, I aim for excellence not perfection. Humans, after all, can never be perfect...? Harper, who turned 53 last month, remarked smiling. 

Commenting on the increased use of technology, he said: ?My own belief is that we?ve reached the limit... But, then, if the authorities decide more needs to be done, I?ll have to go along with that.? 

Harper, incidentally, is a Sachin ?fan?. But, as he emphasised, ?nobody should get the wrong message.? 

?The first time I umpired in India was during the 1999 Test here versus New Zealand and the reception Sachin got was awesome... Even years on, it?s difficult explaining that... I realised I had to concentrate that much harder each time he batted,? Harper pointed out. 

The ongoing Test is his 46th. 

Footnote: It?s widely believed umpires have few friends. Admirers are even fewer. Harper, though, has one in the systems manager of the team hotel (Landmark). The latter, it seems, was promised a couple of complimentaries by the umpire. A mix-up, however, meant the manager had to tap other sources. Much to his surprise, Harper himself came to the systems hub, the next evening, and apologised. To make amends, he even offered complimentaries for the remainder of the Test.

London: Chris Gayle and Wavell Hinds shared a 192-run opening stand while Mervyn Dillon routed Bangladesh?s top order to guide the West Indies to a 138-run victory in their Champions Trophy group B match on Wednesday. 

Gayle scored 99 and Hinds 82 in the West Indies? 269 for three before Dillon returned career-best figures of five for 29 at the Rosebowl in Southampton. 

Aftab Ahmed (21) and Mushfiqur Rahman (21) provided some resistance for Bangladesh in a 45-run sixth-wicket stand after they had slumped to 26 for five. 

Gayle and Hinds, who has not played a one-day International since last November, accumulated runs at ease before Hinds was deceived by a slower ball from Tapash Baisya and well caught by Nazmul Hossain running in from long-off for 82. 

Gayle was caught-behind off Baisya for 99 as he attempted to smash a wide delivery through the covers. 

The tall left-hander was visibly annoyed as he left the ground, having been dismissed one short of what would have been his 10th ODI century. (Reuters)

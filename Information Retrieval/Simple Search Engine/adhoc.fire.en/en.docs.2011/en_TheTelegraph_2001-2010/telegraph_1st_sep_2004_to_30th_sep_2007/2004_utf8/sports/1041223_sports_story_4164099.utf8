Madrid: Barcelona ended the year on a high as striker Samuel Eto?o grabbed a late winner to seal a 2-1 home victory over Levante on Tuesday that earned his side the symbolic title of winter champions. 

The Cameroon international scored his 13th goal of the season when he turned past two defenders and fired high into the net after receiving the ball on the edge of the area from newly-crowned world player of the year, Ronaldinho just three minutes from time. 

The result left Barca 12 points clear of fellow Catalans Espanyol at the top of the table with two games left until the halfway mark of the season. 

Real Betis moved into sixth place after an early strike from midfielder Joaquin gave them an edgy 1-0 win at home to Atletico Madrid in Tuesday?s late match. 

Ronaldinho provided the first chance after forcing a fine one-handed save from Levante ?keeper Juan Luis Mora with a powerful curling shot from the left, but Deco was closed down before he could follow up. 

Ronaldinho breached the Levante defence and cut a neat pass back to Eto?o, but the striker blasted over the bar from edge of the area. 

Levante conceded a dangerous free-kick when Eto?o was brought down a few metres outside the area. 

Deco took the free-kick while Levante were still organising a wall and his powerful shot flew past a helpless Mora after deflecting off Levante defender Alexis. 

Levante refused to fold, however, and midfielders Nacho and Felix Ettien remained a constant threat on the break. 

It was Ettien who set up the equaliser on the hour when he sliced open the Barca defence with a superb curling pass to Jofre and the Levante midfielder finished off with an angled shot inside the far post. 

Barca upped the pace in the closing minutes and Eto?o deprived the visitors of a point when he snatched the win with his magnificent late strike. (Reuters)

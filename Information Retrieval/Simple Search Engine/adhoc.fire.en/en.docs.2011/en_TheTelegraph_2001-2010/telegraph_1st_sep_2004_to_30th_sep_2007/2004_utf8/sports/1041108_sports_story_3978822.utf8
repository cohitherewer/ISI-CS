The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Sourav clarification on squad

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Calcutta: Team India captain Sourav Ganguly has clarified that while he wasn?t consulted during Saturday?s selection committee meeting in Mumbai, he did speak to chief selector Kiran More the previous evening. 

?Actually, I had a fairly lengthy chat with Kiran and made known my views on the squad for the November 13 ODI (against Pakistan) here,? Sourav told The Telegraph on Sunday evening. 

Sourav also informed that Board secretary S.K. Nair had been intimated that he wouldn?t be able to attend the selection meeting. Surprisingly, though, this wasn?t made public by former joint-secretary Prof. Ratnakar Shetty, who acted as convenor in Nair?s absence. 

Prof. Shetty, perhaps, didn?t know that himself? The Board, after all, remains poor on the communications front. Being tops in earning revenue isn?t the only bottomline it should be focussing on.

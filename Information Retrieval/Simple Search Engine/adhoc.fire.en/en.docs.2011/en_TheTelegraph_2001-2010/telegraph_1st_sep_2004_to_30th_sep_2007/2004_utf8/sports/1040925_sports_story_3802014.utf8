The Telegraph - Calcutta

 England in perfect balance

 - WI seek biggest title since 1979 World Cup win 

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI 

London: On the eve of the West Indies? Champions Trophy campaign-launch, Brian Lara promised their ?best foot? would be put forward. Exactly that has been done and, now, his team is within a hundred overs of claiming their biggest one-day title since the 1979 World Cup. 

Equally, hosts England are on an absolute high and wish to end the season too on a winning note. The Oval, then, should see a final befitting the second-most valued limited overs tournament. 

Actually, nobody expected an England-West Indies face-off and, so, there?s little pressure on both. After all, they already are winners. 

However, having got this far ? England eliminated joint-holders Sri Lanka and upset Australia, while the West Indies got the better of South Africa and surprised Pakistan ? nobody wants to trip at the ultimate hurdle. 

That?s understandable. 

?We?ve made the final in great fashion (knocking off the world champions) and are confident. We respect the West Indies... It?s an exciting side, yes, but we ourselves have something to achieve on Saturday,? informed Michael Vaughan. 

Vaughan, of course, agreed that being on the ball day after day was tough on the mind. More so, as England?s last opponents were Australia. That semi-final drained the players. 

By the way, this year, England have faced the West Indies in seven (completed) ODIs and a 4-3 advantage rests with Lara?s team. 

In Vaughan?s opinion, the West Indies have added depth to batting and, as important, have improved on the field. In one-dayers, that does become critical. 

As it was with taciturn coach Duncan Fletcher on Thursday, the England captain declined to speak about a possible chin-music strategy for Lara. ?We have plans for all players... Lara isn?t an exception,? Vaughan maintained. 

Lara, confirming he was fit despite the nasty Shoaib Akhtar blow in Southampton, acknowledged England were handsomely entrenched. But, added: ?We?re hungry and it?s a great opportunity... People in the Caribbean take cricket seriously and it will be nice to not let them down...? 

If the West Indies do take the $300,000 winners? cheque, it won?t surprise if the success is dedicated to those who suffered Hurricane Ivan?s fury. 

Lara, in fact, gave a rather sentimental touch by being non-committal on whether the final is going to be his last appearance in an international match in England. ?You never know...? the 35-year-old double world record-holder said enigmatically. 

Perhaps not wanting the focus on him, Lara quickly made the point about the team being his ?biggest strength.? He continued: ?Some of us have been crucified, but we?re still working hard... We remain driven by a desire to not return empty-handed and, generally, are moving towards always being competitive.? 

Clearly, where goals are concerned, the West Indies can?t be faulted. It?s to be seen, though, whether Lara?s men can snare the Andrew Flintoffs. 

At the moment, a perfectly balanced England have the edge but, then, the West Indies are so very unpredictable... Incidentally, according to The Telegraph?s sources, both sides are expected to retain the XI which did duty in the semi-finals. 

TEAMS 

England (likely): Marcus Trescothick, Vikram Solanki, Michael Vaughan, Andrew Strauss, Andrew Flintoff, Paul Collingwood, Geraint Jones, Ashley Giles, Alex Wharf, Darren Gough, Steve Harmison. 

West Indies (likely): Chris Gayle, Wavell Hinds, Ramnaresh Sarwan, Brian Lara, Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Ricardo Powell, Dwayne Bravo, Ryan Hinds, Courtney Browne, Ian Bradshaw, Corey Collymore. 

Umpires: Rudi Koertzen, Simon Taufel. 

Match Referee: Ranjan Madugalle. 

Postscript: Vaughan has accepted that soccer remains England?s No. 1 sport. ?Some catching up has to be done,? he remarked, adding he didn?t have reservations over the ?treatment? given to his men in a year which featured the Olympics and the Ryder Cup.

Calcutta: The Indo-ASEAN rally preparations are on way, though not sans hiccups. The convoy that had started off from here early Thursday faced their first set of problems, way inside Indian territory. Extremely bad roads hampered speed and punctures created flutters in the convoy. The convoy reached Siliguri at 2.30am Friday, which should have been achieved hours before that. They reached Guwahati late Friday. 

Such convoys from several parts of the country are moving to Guwahati, the flag-off venue from where the official security clearance and vehicle checks will be done. 

Six cars from New Delhi have already reached, apart from the Calcutta cars, the rest to will reach Saturday. The total has now climbed to 65 cars, including 24 official competition entries from all the nine countries. 

In Calcutta, 40-year-old Ho Chun-ming or Chuck, is ready to take on the rally route. This senior inspector from the Hong Kong police force has a reputation as a ?crazy driver? in the force and has driven extensively around the world ?except for in South America,? as he points out. 

He has another reputation, though 16 years old, of having acted in a typical action movie of Hong Kong, called Project A. Acting opposite him was one Jackie Chan. 

?That was when I was still in the auxiliary force in Hong Kong,? says Chuck. 

More importantly, though, Chuck, who joins the rallyists in Guwahati Saturday and will be driving a modified Esteem, will be carrying with him a specially built trophy, for the rallying team which has contributed the most towards the rally. This is expected to be a forerunner of a trophy or trophies, with this rally expected to enter the fully competitive zone from next year. 

The trophy, a route of the rally on Burma teak has been donated by Sparta Matrix, tracking systems experts.

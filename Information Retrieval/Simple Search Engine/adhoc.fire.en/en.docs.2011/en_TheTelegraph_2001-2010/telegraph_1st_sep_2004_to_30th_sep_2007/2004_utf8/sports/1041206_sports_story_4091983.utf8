The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Little did I know I would be watching 

 such a tragedy... 

 - Cristiano Junior, who wore the East 

 Bengal colours not long ago, is no more

 P. K. BANERJEE

 I had switched on the television 

 hoping to see a close Federation Cup final with Mohun Bagan 

 having the edge over Dempo. Little did I realise that I 

 would witness history of a tragic kind on Bangalore?s Kanteerava 

 Stadium turf.

 It didn?t look to be a fatal collision 

 at first sight. Having already given Dempo the lead, Junior 

 was desperate for an insurance goal which would shut Mohun 

 Bagan out of the final. He got his chance and took it like 

 only he could, totally deceiving Subrata Pal. 

 The ball was on way to the net 

 but by the time the tall Brazilian noticed that the goalie 

 was on a collision course.

 It was a couple of minutes later, 

 when the TV camera focussed on medical personnel trying 

 in vain to revive Junior, lying prostrate on the pitch, 

 that I realised the enormity of the accident. I switched 

 off the set praying to the Almighty that He spare this gifted 

 footballer.

 What a tragedy! A striker coming 

 all the way from Brazil and winning hearts in India but 

 surrendering his life in pursuit of earning his team glory. 

 As I struggled to come to grips 

 with the news of his death, my mind raced back to the 1956 

 Melbourne Olympics. India were playing Yugoslavia in the 

 semi-final and we were trailing. A ball was floated into 

 the box from the flank and I rose to meet it with my head. 

 I felt a scathing pain (in the head) and the next thing 

 I knew was that I was in hospital. The goalkeeper, in trying 

 to fist the ball, had used his hands so furiously that I 

 was left with a fractured skull.

 I was also reminded of the 1982 

 World Cup semi-final when German goalkeeper Harald Schumacher 

 rushed out, struck French striker Patrick Battiston and 

 sent him to hospital with a brutal charge. Thankfully, the 

 Frenchman survived. Surprisingly, Schumacher got away scot-free!

 Schumacher?s was a deliberate 

 offence, not the Yugoslav custodian and Subrata Pal?s. Why 

 I am talking of these incidents in the same breath is basically 

 to make a simple observation: strikers all over the world 

 should be a little more concerned about their lives.

 As far as I am concerned, football 

 is an adventurous sport with a fair degree of body-contact. 

 Every footballer runs the risk of an injury any time, but 

 more so a striker. I am not worried about the ?safe? striker 

 who will never endanger his life by getting desperate in 

 a one-on-one situation with the goalkeeper. It?s the likes 

 of Junior who scare me. Goal-hungry strikers like Junior 

 must know when to save themselves, even at the cost of missing 

 out on a goal.

 There?s another major lesson from 

 the Junior tragedy ? it?s for those who run the game in 

 India and, indeed, around the globe. Let the federation 

 make it mandatory for all host associations to arrange for 

 a cardiac specialist at the ground. I know it is impossible 

 to have such an arrangement for all matches, but at least 

 they should think about it seriously for all games featuring 

 the top teams.

 That?s the least the AIFF can 

 do for the footballers. If the officials? memories need 

 to be jogged, Sanjib Dutta succumbed to an on-field collision 

 during a Santosh Trophy game, Debjit Ghosh recently had 

 a narrow escape thanks to Dr Santi Ranjan Dasgupta?s presence. 

 And, now, this. The game?s administrators 

 need to act right away.

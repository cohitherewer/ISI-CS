 Yuvraj wants a ?fair chance? in Tests 

 - Big experience to play for Lancashire: Mongia 

 Yuvraj Singh believes he got a raw deal 

Chittagong: Yuvraj Singh believes he got a raw deal when he was dropped from the Test team after being tried as an opener in just one match in the home series against Australia this year. 

The stylish left-handed batsman from Punjab said he should have been given a ?fair chance? to establish himself at the top by being allowed to play a couple of matches in a row. 

?If I get to open the batting again, I should be given a fair chance. It should not be like I am tried in one match and dropped in the next when I fail,? Yuvraj said. 

The 24-year-old batsman said the decision did hurt him but he moved on. ?Yeah, it did (hurt), but I can?t complain. Anybody gets dropped, one can?t do much about it,? said Yuvraj after joining the Indian team for the three-match one-day series against Bangladesh. 

The first one-dayer will be played on Thursday, while the remaining two back-to-back ties are scheduled under lights in Dhaka on Sunday and Monday. 

Yuvraj said the Indians ?cannot be complacent? against the hosts. 

?Bangladesh are a different team in the one-dayers. Half of the day?s play anybody can play well. We can?t be complacent.? 

The Punjab batsman said 2004 had been a mixed year for him. ?It has been a series of ups and downs for me.? 

?I started with a hundred in Australia in the one-dayers, and then a Test hundred in Pakistan. After that I did not get enough runs and got dropped from the Test side.? 

Another player who would be looking to make the most of the series against the minnows is Yuvraj?s Punjab skipper Dinesh Mongia. 

Mongia is back in the Indian squad after a gap of 18 months, and incidentally, the last time he played a one-day match was also in Bangladesh during the TVS Cup tri-series in April 2003. 

?I did well then. Coming in at No. 6 or 7, averaged fifty-plus with the bat. It was a bit disappointing to be dropped,? the left-hander said. 

Mongia said he had no complains that he had been recalled for a short series against a low ranked team and was looking to play and make the most out of the opportunity. 

?I cannot be thinking like that. I have got to score runs from whatever opportunity I get. 

?I have everything to gain, in loads and loads, since I am on a comeback,? he said. 

The 28-year-old batsman said he also tried to make best use of his time outside the Indian team. 

?It was a big experience to play in (English) County cricket, particularly for Lancashire where my teammates were Carl Hooper, Stuart Law and Andrew Flintoff. 

?It was a very different experience to be among them as against playing against them. Hooper especially was very helpful. 

?He is a religious man and emphasised on hard work. 

?It has been a learning curve. Played so much, did my bit for India, it has been great fun.?

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Pal hit was intentional, says AIFF

A STAFF REPORTER

 Douglas da Silva at a condolence meeting in the city on Wednesday 

 Calcutta: Mohun Bagan on 

 Wednesday received the All India Football Federation?s (AIFF) 

 reply to the clarifications sought by the club. 

 The AIFF has said in the letter that video clippings 

 of the match clearly suggest Subrata Pal had hit Cristiano 

 Junior intentionally with the ball nowhere in sight. 

The club?s assistant general secretary, Balaram Chowdhury, said the letter will be forwarded to Pal. ?I am sure he will be able to prove his innocence,? Chowdhury added. 

It is learnt that Dempo Sports Club, not happy with Junior?s post-mortem report, is planning for another autopsy in Goa and so the body could not be sent to Brazil. 

 Meanwhile, a day after Mohun Bagan players returned 

 to the city, the officials are trying to shield the goalkeeper 

 from the media. 

 The custodian was present at Chowdhury?s office along 

 with the coach on Wednesday. Coach Subrata Bhattacharya 

 said that Pal is expected to join practice from Thursday. 

 ?We are keeping him match-fit. He will return to the starting 

 line-up once the suspension is lifted. ?Let the AIFF carry 

 out the investigation. There?s no harm in it. He will not 

 be able to play while the probe is on. Let the details come 

 in and then we will see. He will join practice in the meantime.? 

 A teammate of Pal, speaking on 

 conditions of anonymity, revealed the custodian was dazed 

 after hearing the news of Junior?s death immediately after 

 the match. ?He couldn?t believe that something like that 

 could have happened. He kept saying that he never intended 

 to hit Junior and repeatedly pleaded innocence,? the player 

 said. 

Meanwhile, Pal?s parents are shattered as the news of his suspension reached them. ?We don?t want his career to end like this,? his brother, Indranil Pal said. He also pleaded not to make his brother a victim of politics. 

Despite worrying about their son, Pal?s parents expressed faith in the club officials and the coach. 

Incidentally, East Bengal held a condolence meeting at the club premises. 

 Douglas da Silva said: ?The decision to suspend him 

 is correct. If he is to play football he should learn to 

 control his emotions.?

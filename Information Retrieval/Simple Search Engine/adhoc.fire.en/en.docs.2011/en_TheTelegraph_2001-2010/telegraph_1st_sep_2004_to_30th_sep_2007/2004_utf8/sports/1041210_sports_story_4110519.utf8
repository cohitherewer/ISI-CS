 ICC satisfied with Grenada preparation 

St George?s (Grenada): International Cricket Council officials expressed satisfaction with Grenada?s preparations to host the World Cup in 2007. 

The ICC chief officer and managing director Chris Dehring, and venue development officer Donald Lockerbie met Prime Minister Keith Mitchell on Wednesday, and viewed the designs for the construction of a new stadium. 

?They were deeply impressed with the new designs,? said the Prime Minister?s press secretary Nancy McGuire. 

Mitchell assured the officials that Grenada will construct a better facility than the one destroyed by Hurricane Ivan in September. He said financial support for the new stadium has been secured from Taiwan and other countries.

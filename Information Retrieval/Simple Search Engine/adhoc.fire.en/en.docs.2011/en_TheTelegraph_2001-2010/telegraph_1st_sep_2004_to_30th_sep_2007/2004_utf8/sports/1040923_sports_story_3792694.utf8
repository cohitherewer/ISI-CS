 Winter Derby deferred 

 OUR TURF CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta: In view of close 

 proximity of the New Year?s Day races and the Calcutta Derby 

 in the forthcoming winter season, RCTC has decided to defer 

 the major classic by a week. The Derby has been a permanent 

 fixture in the RCTC racing calendar on the first Sunday 

 of January. ?This winter?s Derby will definitely be shifted 

 to the second Sunday of January. The New Year?s Day races 

 and the year 2005 Derby are separated only by a day, said 

 Boman Parakh, secretary RCTC. Stewards may also consider 

 the second Sunday as a permanent slot for the Derby to avoid 

 such problems in future,? added Parakh.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 I had no answer to Sehwag: Ontong

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Before landing in India, Justin Ontong had hoped his ?unknown status? to Sourav Ganguly amp; Co. might be the ace up his sleeve. 

Prior to the Eden Gardens game, he had played a single Test and managed to bowl just a couple of overs, against the Australians in 2001. 

However, as he said, a lot of his confidence was derived from the India?s victory over Australia in the Mumbai Test earlier this month, which saw 38 wickets fall on a viciously turning pitch in just two days. 

As it turned out, the 25-year old South African leg-spinner?s ambition is now facing a reality check. And Virender Sehwag proves to be his nemesis. 

?I had no answer to Sehwag,? he admitted while talking to The Telegraph on Wednesday. ?It?s extremely difficult to bowl to the Indian batsmen here,? he added. 

In India?s first innings total of 411, he conceded 79 runs (off 18.1 overs) before dismissing Harbhajan Singh. 

Sehwag, however, picked him for special treatment during his quickfire 88. The Indian opener punished the leg-spinner for 23 runs off seven balls at one stage. 

Ontong, nevertheless, carries on hope, with the ?wicket crumbling??

 Rach to stay as coach

New Delhi: German Gerhard Rach, who was India?s chief coach in the Athens Olympics will continue in the same post during the tour of Pakistan, an Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) official said here on Friday. 

Rach, who had returned to Germany after India?s seventh place finish in the Olympics, is expected to reach here tonight before heading to Chandigarh, where the probables for the Pakistan series are training under the supervision of assistant coach Jagbir Singh. 

?Rach would continue in his position and would be the chief coach during the Pakistan tour,? an IHF official said. 

An 18-member Indian squad for the four-match Test series, starting at Karachi on September 24, is likely to be announced in a couple of days. 

The official said defender William Xalco, who suffered a fracture on his finger in Athens, has recovered fully and is available for selection. 

However, the team would be without some senior players like Dhanraj Pillay and Baljit Singh Dhillon, both of whom have made themselves unavailable for the series, besides strikers Gagan Ajit Singh, Deepak Thakur and Prabhjot Singh, who have been dropped. 

The Indians are scheduled to leave for Karachi on September 22.

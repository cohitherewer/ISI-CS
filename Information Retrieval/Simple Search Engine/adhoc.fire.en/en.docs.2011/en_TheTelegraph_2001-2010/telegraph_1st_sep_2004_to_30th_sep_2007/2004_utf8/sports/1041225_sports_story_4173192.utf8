 Harika loses in Round 4 

 Arghyadip is in second spot with 3 others 

Bikaner: WGM Dronavalli Harika suffered a huge setback as she went down to Hoang Thi Bao Tram of Vietnam in the fourth round of the Asian junior girls? chess championship here on Friday. 

IM M.R. Venkatesh had a bad day, too, as he was beaten by Nguyen van Huy, also of Vietnam, in the open section. 

Huy is on top with the maximum four points in as many rounds. He is one point ahead of Indian hopefuls Arghyadip Das, Abhijeet Gupta, IM S. Poobesh Anand and former champion Deepan Chakravarthy. 

With seven rounds still remaining to determine the best under-20 player in Asia, top two seeds IM Anton Filippov (Uzbekistan) and Venkatesh are next in line with 2.5 points each. 

In the girls? section, it is turning out to be a great show by Tram who also has a cent per cent score. The young Vietnam girl is half a point clear of India?s N. Raghavi who upset defending champion Y. Pratibha. 

In the next pack are Indians Harika, Kruttika Nadig, Soumya Swaminathan and Siti Julaikha (Malaysia), who all have three points from four games. 

It was a tough day for Harika as she let go a promising position with black pieces. 

Playing her pet Sicilian Sveshnikov, Harika had Huy on the ropes in the middlegame as she launched a powerful attack on the kingside after sacrificing a pawn. 

Tram, however, put up a good show under pressure, not only waiting patiently but also making some forays on the other flank with her extra pawn. Harika eventually lost after 72 moves. Saheli Nath was trounced by Kruttika while Zulaikha beat Bahar Hallaeva of Turkmenistan. 

There were again quite a few drawn games in boys? section. Arghyadip played safe to split the point with Gupta. Poobesh and Deepan also decided to sign the peace treaty. 

Former national sub-junior champion Arun Prasad did well to hold Filipov who played white. (PTI)

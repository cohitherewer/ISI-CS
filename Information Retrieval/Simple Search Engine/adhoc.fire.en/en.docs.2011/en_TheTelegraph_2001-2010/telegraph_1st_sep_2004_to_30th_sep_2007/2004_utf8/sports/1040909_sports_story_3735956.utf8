 SLC shocked as Murali misses out

 Muralidharan 

Colombo: Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) officials have expressed ?surprise and disappointment? over off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan missing out at the inaugural International Cricket Council (ICC) awards on Tuesday. 

Muralidharan, Test cricket?s highest wicket-taker, was nominated for all three major award categories after a prolific year in which he had taken 68 wickets in eight Tests against England, Australia and Zimbabwe. 

A 50-member voting academy ? comprising national captains, umpires, match referees, former players and media representatives ? picked Indian batsman Rahul Dravid as Cricketer of the Year and Test Player of the Year. 

?We are definitely surprised and all obviously disappointed as Murali was the leading wicket-taker in Test cricket during this period, but it is the people who vote that matter in the end,? SLC president Mohan de Silva said. 

Despite being one of only five players nominated for all three main categories, Muralidharan was then omitted from the World Test XI. 

?But Murali is a tough competitor and I have no doubt that, when he comes back from injury, he will keep taking wickets and will one day get the recognition he deserves.?

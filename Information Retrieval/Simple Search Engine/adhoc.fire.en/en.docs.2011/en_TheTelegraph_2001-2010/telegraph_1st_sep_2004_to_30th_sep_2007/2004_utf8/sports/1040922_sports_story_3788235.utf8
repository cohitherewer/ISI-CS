 Silvestre double outshines Ferdinand

 - United seem to be regaining gusto with 2-1 win over Liverpool

On a storm-tossed night at Old Trafford, lightning in the form of Mikael Silvestre struck twice for a reinvigorated Manchester United. Both were headers from Ryan Giggs deliveries. To lose one headed goal to Silvestre could be considered a misfortune; to lose two smacked of near-criminal carelessness, particularly after Liverpool had levelled through John O?Shea?s own goal. 

Liverpool still look a work in progress but United, particularly with Rio Ferdinand bringing stability to the back-line, are clearly regaining their gusto. Cristiano Ronaldo was unplayable at times. 

This encounter also carried significance for England; Steven Gerrard hobbled away on a damaged left heel, his every painful step watched by a concerned Sammy Lee, Sven-Goran Eriksson?s representative. Gerrard may now be a doubt for the World Cup qualifier back here against Wales on October 9. At least Ferdinand indicated he would be ready. 

Ferdinand, whose failure to meet the obligations of his profession had brought eight months in purdah, was swift to display his willingness to assume accountability on the field with a remarkably assured return, winning the ball effortlessly to breathe belief into United as they utterly dominated the first half. 

Ferdinand?s central-defensive colleague, Silvestre was also quick to take responsibility, seizing the lead for United after 20 minutes and adding a second after 66 minutes. Liverpool?s defence was as panic-stricken as United?s was newly secure, although old flaws resurfaced, gifting Liverpool a brief second-half equaliser through O?Shea?s own goal. 

A sense of injustice had plagued Liverpool ever since the build-up to Silvestre?s first. Sami Hyypia was legitimately hustling Paul Scholes out on the left, and appeared to have conceded at most a throw-in. The linesman signalled a throw but the referee, Graham Poll, bizarrely deemed it a free-kick. United immediately set about adding insult to iniquity. Giggs bent over the free-kick, deliberating guiding the ball into the path of Silvestre, who had glided up unnoticed to head home. 

Silvestre?s opener was the very least a fired-up United deserved. Ronaldo was causing chaos down Liverpool?s left, inviting Harry Kewell and John Arne Riise into a land of nightmares, particularly in the opening half. One flick to the lively Wes Brown, a single touch that deceived both Kewell and Riise, was worth the admission alone. Ronaldo then almost snapped a post in two with a fierce drive. 

Here was the real United, leaders showing themselves all over the park. Gabriel Heinze again impressed, defending doggedly when required but the Argentina international also raided hungrily upfield. Roy Keane was a colossus in the middle, while Ruud van Nistelrooy brimmed with intelligent movement further forward. 

Van Nistelrooy could easily have given United the chance of the lead even before Silvestre struck. Racing into the box, he was clearly held back by Hyypia, although the Dutchman also had a handful of the Finn?s shirt. Some strikers would have taken a tumble but Van Nistelrooy stayed on his feet. 

Fortunately for United, Silvestre then brought some sanity to the scoreline. Here was a test of character for Liverpool. However, Kewell began throwing questioning glances at Riise, as if the livewire Ronaldo was solely the Norwegian?s responsibility, but Jamie Carragher took the more collective-minded response, shouting encouragement at his besieged team-mates. 

Even so, Liverpool finished the half in dispiriting fashion with Gerrard limping from the fray after O?Shea stood on his left heel. Liverpool could have folded but they responded admirably to such adversity, levelling after the interval. When Xabi Alonso swung the ball over from the left, Steve Finnan?s header back hit Roy Carroll and then went in off O?Shea. 

Midway through the second half, Giggs swung over a corner and there was Silvestre, beating Riise to the ball, and arrowing another header past Jerzy Dudek. As Silvestre would say, this was d?j? vu all over again.

 Chanu still hopeful

New Delhi: Weightlifter Sanamacha Chanu is still hoping to bail herself out of the doping mess and is waiting to know the contents of the ?recovery drip? that was given to her by coach Leonid Taranenko. 

Chanu, who tested positive for diuretic ?furosemide? after finishing fourth in the 53kg class in the Athens Games, however, said all was not over as yet for her. 

?I want to check if the recovery drip, which I was given on August 13, was laced with the banned substance. 

?Foreign coach Leonid Taranenko had sent the drip with Kunjurani (Devi) and I was urinating unusually after using the drip,? she said. (PTI)

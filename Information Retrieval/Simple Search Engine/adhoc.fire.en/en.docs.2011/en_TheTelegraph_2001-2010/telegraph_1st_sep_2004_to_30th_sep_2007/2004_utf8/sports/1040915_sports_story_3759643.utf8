The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Lanka grab 4-wkt win

 - Maravan Atapattu scores 43 after Chigumbura?s 57 

London: Tillekeratne Dilshan steered Sri Lanka to a scratchy four-wicket win over Zimbabwe in their Champions Trophy match at the Oval on Tuesday but the Africans go home with pride restored after a spirited performance. 

Sri Lanka passed their target of 192 but failed to better Englands net run rate in pool D meaning they will go out if their decisive match against the hosts on Friday and possibly Saturday is washed out. 

?As we lost two wickets early we were not too bothered about getting it in 37 overs,? Sri Lanka captain Maravan Atapattu said, referring to the speed they needed to chase the runs to outdo England. 

Allrounder Elton Chigumbura took three wickets but Sri Lanka edged home with 37 balls to spare, Dilshan unbeaten on 25 after Atapattu had top scored with 43. 

Chigumbura had earlier struck an aggressive 57 as Zimbabwe posted a respectable 191 all out. 

The 18-year-old came in at 85 for six and with Prosper Utseya (31) put on an eighth-wicket stand of 64 before both perished late on trying to push the score past 200. 

Sri Lanka seamer Farveez Mahroof took three for 38 while Nuwan Zoysa bagged three for 19 as he became the eighth Sri Lankan to take 100 one-day wickets. (Reuters)

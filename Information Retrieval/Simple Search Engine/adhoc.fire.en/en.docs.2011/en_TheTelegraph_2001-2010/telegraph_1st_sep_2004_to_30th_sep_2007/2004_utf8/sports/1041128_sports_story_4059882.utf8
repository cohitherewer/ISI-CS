The Telegraph - Calcutta

 History of huge importance: Smith

 - A win at the Eden will be a big boost for the England series, says South African captain

 South Africa captain Graeme Smith, Shaun Pollock and Boeta Dippenaar relax at the Eden on Saturday 

Calcutta: Barely a few hours before being injured in a freak accident, which has put his participation in doubt, Graeme Smith had exuded confidence going into the final Test of the series. 

His mood was obviously different after the accident. ?I am in considerable pain? Let?s see how it goes?? Smith, who was on crutches with a bandaged leg, told The Telegraph. 

He was optimistic about the team?s chances. History, which favours South Africa, will be of ?huge importance? to this inexperienced and young side, he felt. ?We are not starting with a draw in mind. We are prepared to fight for five days of hard cricket. It will be fantastic if we can pull off a surprise win here,? the South African captain said after a light workout at the Eden on Saturday. 

?As the underdogs, if we can pull off a surprise win, you can imagine the reactions back home. It will also be a big boost before the England series. 

?There have been ups and downs in South African cricket but this time we have come here a much improved side. We have a new coach who has put in a lot of fresh ideas. We hope to do well in future,? Smith said. 

He was pinning hopes on his bowlers. ?Shaun Pollock, Makhaya Ntini are hungry and confident of a good show. They have gained confidence after Kanpur. We hope to get 20 wickets here.? 

Coach Ray Jennings echoed similar sentiments. ?We?ve worked hard for this series. India will be under extra pressure during these five days since the expectations will be high. They will have to absorb the pressure, not us.? 

Smith indicated South Africa would bat on winning the toss. ?A big score in the first innings is very important in the sub-continent. So?? 

Jennings came out in support of their tactics during the first Test, especially slow batting and negative bowling. ?We had to rethink our gameplan. The Indians had created three opportunities to put pressure on us. So we had to play with patience to both put pressure and absorb it.? 

Sourav Ganguly, though, felt that the pressure will be equal on both teams. ?Every side plays to win. I am sure they also want to win as much as we do. So, the pressure will be on both the teams.? 

The Indian captain did not read much into his not yet getting a hundred in his hometown. ?I approach a Test match anywhere in the same manner. It?s a coincidence that I have so far not managed a hundred at the Eden. I hope to get it soon.?

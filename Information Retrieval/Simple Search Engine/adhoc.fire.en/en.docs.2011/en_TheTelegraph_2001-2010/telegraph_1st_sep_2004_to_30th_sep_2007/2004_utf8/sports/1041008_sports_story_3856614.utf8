 New marks by Mandar, Taniya 

New Delhi: Policeman Mandar Divse, the treble gold winner last year, sizzled the pool with a new meet record as he won the men?s 1500m freestyle while Taniya Ganguly bettered her own national record in 3 m springboard diving in the 58th senior national aquatic championships here Thursday. 

Four new records fell during the day with Karnataka and Police bagging seven medals each on the third day of the meet at Shyama Prasad Mookerji swimming pool here. 

The other record breakers were Police?s T. K. Senthil Kumar (men?s 200m backstroke) and Arjun Muralidharan (men?s 100m butterfly). In diving, Taniya bettered her own national record, tallying 389.5 points. 

Mandar clocked 16:33.60 to better the four-year-old record of 16:48.82 set by Kailash Nath of Police. In 200 backstroke, Senthil clocked 2:11.97 to finish ahead of Akbar Ali Mir of Railways, last year?s gold medallist in the event. Mir clocked 2:13.56. Muralidharan won the 100 butterfly in 56.29 seconds, erasing Railways? K. Suresh?s decade-old record of 57.79 seconds. 

In women?s 100m butterfly, Richa Mishra of Police won the gold medal. 

Olympian Shikha Tandon had another good day as she won her third consecutive gold. After winning the 4 x 200m relay and 50m free in the previous days, Shikha produced her personal best timing of 2:29.85 seconds to win the 200m backstroke. (PTI)

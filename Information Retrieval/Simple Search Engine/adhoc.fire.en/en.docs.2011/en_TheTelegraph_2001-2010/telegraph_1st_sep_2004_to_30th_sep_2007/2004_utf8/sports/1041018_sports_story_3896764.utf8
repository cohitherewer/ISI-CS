 Team not choking: Woolmer

 - ?Losing big matches a symptom of growth phase? 

Lahore: Pakistan?s English coach Bob Woolmer on Sunday admitted his squad was not clicking as a unit in big games, but said such teams should not be called chokers as it was a common symptom in a team?s growth phase. 

?When I was South African team coach they were unfairly labelled with chokers tag so I did some research on teams who don?t quite win big games and found a common theme that teams growing together miss out on important games,? Woolmer said. 

Woolmer, who played 19 Tests for England before coaching South Africa between 1994-1999, was reacting after Pakistan lost the tri-series final by 119 runs to Asian champions Sri Lanka on Saturday. 

?We were in prime form... Weren?t overconfident and in the right mood but Sri Lanka played better than us and we have to say in cricket only one side wins and everyone would have liked Pakistan to win. 

Woolmer?s new team had a third big defeat in the final of the Holland tri-series, followed by semi-final loss to the West Indies in the Champions Trophy. 

?They have been with me for three months and as the team grows it tends to miss out on important games because it doesn?t quite believe that they can win yet, we have to be honest, maybe we are not ready to win yet,? he said. 

?Maybe we haven?t quite clicked as a complete unit, clicking in certain games but not in one that counts, so maybe that is a symptom of the growth phase, it?s not an excuse but we have to find reasons of why we are not winning the important games,? said Woolmer. 

Woolmer replaced Javed Miandad in June and under him Pakistan have won 11 of their 16 ODIs. (AFP)

 BCCI asked to confirm venues by January 3

Islamabad: Pakistan cricket authorities have asked their Indian counterparts to confirm the venues for the next year?s tour by January 3 as they are keen to send a high-level security delegation to carry out an inspection. 

?BCCI has still not provided us with the list of venues where they plan to hold the matches. This matter has been delayed due to the court case concerning the Indian board,? a senior PCB official said. 

?They gave us two earlier dates (for furnishing the details) but didn?t meet the deadlines. Now we have requested them to send us the list of proposed venues by early next month so that we may know where we stand,? he was quoted as saying in the daily The News on Tuesday. 

The Pakistan squad is due to tour India from February 25 to play three Tests and five one-day Internationals besides two side games. 

Although the BCCI has sent a tentative itinerary outlining the dates of these matches, they have yet to send the list of venues. 

The Indians had also sent a top security delegation to Pakistan in March this year. (PTI)

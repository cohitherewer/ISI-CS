The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Roger setting the standard, says Hewitt

 - ?The Swiss can have a go at Sampras? record? 

 Lleyton Hewitt wipes his brow during the final against Roger Federer at Flushing Meadow on Sunday 

New York: Lleyton Hewitt is getting frustrated meeting Roger Federer in the major events. For the third time in four Grand Slams this year, the Swiss got the better of Hewitt. 

In the Australian Open it was at the fourth round, at Wimbledon it was the quarter final and here, at the US Open, it was in the final as he went down 0-6, 6-7, 0-6. 

?I?ve lost to Roger in three out of the four majors,? said Hewitt, who was appearing in his first Grand Slam final since he won the Wimbledon in 2002. ?When he?s playing like he did, especially in the first set here today, there?s very little you can do out there. He returned extremely well and it was hard to get any cheap points off him,? the Australian said. 

?Who knows? if I had met him a little bit later in the Australian and at Wimbledon, then?, but he?s the stand-out (player) this year.? 

For the first time since 1884, the US Open final had two love sets, and Hewitt said he had simply been outplayed by the world No. 1. ?He?s playing incredible tennis and on all surfaces,? the fourth seed said. 

?You know, he had an incredible run leading up to the Wimbledon and then straight after Wimbledon through to Toronto.? 

Federer?s victory made him the first man since Swede Mats Wilander in 1988 to win three Grand Slams in the same year, leading to much discussion about whether the Swiss can match or even beat Pete Sampras?s record of 14 Grand Slam titles. 

?He?s definitely got a chance, there?s no doubt about it,? Hewitt said. ?Especially the year that he?s had, he?s always going to have a chance going into every major, even the French Open. You know, he lost in the third round (in Paris) this year to Guga (Gustavo Kuerten), but it?s going to take a guy like Guga or someone like that to beat him at every Slam,? Hewitt stated. 

Despite his defeat, Hewitt said he was delighted with his game over the last few months. ?It?s obviously disappointing, you know,? he said. ?This is my first loss in a Grand Slam final and any final is hard to lose. But I?m happy with the way I?m playing.? 

?I don?t think anyone in the actual tournament (could have beaten Federer on Sunday),? Hewitt said. ?I don?t know, maybe Pete Sampras, obviously with his serve, but it?s very hard to say. He?s setting the standard.? (Reuters)

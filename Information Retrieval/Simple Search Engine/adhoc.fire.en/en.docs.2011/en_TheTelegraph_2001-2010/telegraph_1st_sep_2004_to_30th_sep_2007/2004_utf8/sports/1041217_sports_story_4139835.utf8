 Gerrard locked in fidelity crisis

 Liverpool doesn?t seem that good a home now for Gerrard 

London: One of soccer?s few remaining ?monogamists?, Steven Gerrard is having his fidelity to under-performing Liverpool tested like never before. 

January?s transfer window is sure to revive speculation that the all-action midfielder will leave the team he captains. 

Six months ago Gerrard agonised over whether to join Roman Abramovich?s rouble-fuelled revolution at Chelsea, eventually opting to stay at Liverpool because Anfield felt like home. 

Having been given reassurances that the club?s ambitions matched his own, the midfielder then watched England striker Michael Owen leave Anfield for Real Madrid. 

Liverpool?s league challenge duly got off to a stumbling start, a familiar scenario for a club that holds the record of 18 English title wins but has not won one since 1990. 

The Anfield air has been soured by the revival of a groundshare plan with city rivals Everton that is widely opposed by both clubs? fans, and by Everton?s astonishing rise to second in the table behind Chelsea. 

?This is not just about Steven Gerrard in the summer or January,? the 24-year-old player said. ?I want to play Champions League football. It?s as simple as that.? 

Gerrard admitted he had been unhappy with Liverpool?s performance for the previous two seasons but, after talking with his family, he decided to stick with his hometown team. 

However, Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger is not alone in his belief that Gerrard will end up at Stamford Bridge, especially if Liverpool once again fail to claim a trophy this season. ?Chelsea will sooner or later take who they want,? said the Frenchman.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Pal may reply today

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Mohun Bagan goalkeeper Subrata Pal is likely to send his reply on Monday to the showcause served by the All India Football Federation (AIFF). 

The AIFF had suspended Pal for his alleged collision with Cristiano de Lima Junior during the Federation Cup final last Sunday. Junior collapsed on the field and died. 

According to a draft prepared on Sunday, the custodian, as expected, will claim his innocence. He will also state that his motive was not to harm Junior. The letter will also mention that Pal did not touch the Brazilian. 

Meanwhile, Junior?s body will be flown off to Brazil on Monday, eight days after the striker died. ?Junior?s family wants his body to be flown to Brazil soon,? Dempo Sports Club coach Armando Colaco said on Sunday.

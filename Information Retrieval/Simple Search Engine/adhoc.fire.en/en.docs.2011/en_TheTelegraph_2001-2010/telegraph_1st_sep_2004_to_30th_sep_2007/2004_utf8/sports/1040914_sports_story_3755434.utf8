The Telegraph - Calcutta

 ?Russian tsunami? sweeps the world

 Capriati has resigned herself to the Russian domination 

New York: With Svetlana Kuznetsova the third Russian woman in a row to win a Grand Slam title this year, the question now seems to be not whether Russia can produce another champion but rather who will be next. 

The 19-year-old beat compatriot Elena Dementieva in Saturday?s all-Russian final , following in the footsteps of Anastasia Myskina and Maria Sharapova. 

Myskina became the first Russian woman to win a Grand Slam when she picked up the French Open in June ? beating Dementieva in the final ? and 17-year-old Sharapova lifted the Wimbledon crown the following month. 

?Yes, I have been asked that question over and over again,? Russian tennis chief Shamil Tarpishchev said on Monday. ?The answer is that you can pick any one of our girls and you won?t be far off the mark.? 

With seven Russians in the world?s top 20, Tarpishchev, who also doubles as the country?s Davis and Fed Cup coach, has an abundance of riches to choose from. 

In fact, such is the strength of women?s tennis in Russia that neither Dementieva nor Sharapova made the Fed Cup squad for the final four to be played in Moscow later this year. But Tarpishchev, who described the latest wave of talent from his country as a ?Russian tsunami?, says the best is yet to come. 

?What you?ve seen is nothing compared to what you might expect in the near future,? he said. ?Everyone knows our top players by now, but there?s the next wave: (Vera) Douchevina, (Anna) Chakvetadze and (Maria) Kirilenko just to name a few.? 

Jennifer Capriati summed up the latest phenomenon with a shrug of the shoulders and a resigned expression after her semi-final loss to Dementieva on Friday. ?I think you had better get used to having at least one Russian girl in the semi-finals from now on,? the 28-year-old Capriati said, and nobody present disagreed with her. The year?s final Grand Slam provided more irrefutable evidence that top players are being rolled out of Moscow?s tennis clubs like tanks off former Cold War production lines. 

Kuznetsova arrived at Flushing Meadow as her country?s fourth-best woman player behind Myskina, Dementieva and Sharapova. 

But the 19-year-old from St Petersburg blasted through the draw, dropping only one set on her way to the final where she overpowered a gallant Dementieva, who was still recovering from her battle with Capriati. 

It is the first year since 1979 that three women from the same country have won the top prizes in tennis, but that only tells half the story. 

A review here makes scary reading for those hoping the Russian express might run out of steam. Of the top 10 seeds at the US Open, five were Russian, while eight of the 15 Russians who started out reached the third round. 

Defending champion Justine Henin-Hardenne was outplayed in the quarter final by Russian Nadia Petrova. Henin-Hardenne said after losing to Petrova, ?the Russians are definitely coming, everybody knows that now?. (Reuters)

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 I miss the England dressing-room, not the sport itself: Hussain

 - ?I made a bad side into a good one? finishing touches have been given by the 

coach and current captain?

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI 

London: The Chennai-born Nasser Hussain (a disciple of Essex legends Keith Fletcher and Graham Gooch) led England in 45 of the 96 Tests he played and, with excellent reasons, is given much credit for changing the side?s outlook. Hussain, who quit earlier this summer, spoke to The Telegraph for over half an hour in the lead-up to Saturday?s Champions Trophy final. As usual, he was candid and articulate. And, at times, emotional. 

The following are excerpts 

Q Are you actually missing playing 

cricket? 

A (Laughs) Not at all... I do miss my teammates, the England dressing-room, the joy which goes with winning... But, not the sport itself. I played with passion and, the moment I found that dwindling, decided never again to wear my whites and go out not giving that hundred per cent. 

Surely, the passion didn?t begin to dwindle overnight? 

I agree... It?s towards the end that I found it a bit difficult on the field... In County cricket... I realised that, mentally, my time was up... That enough was enough... 

But, you were still getting runs... 

I could have carried on for a year or so, but I was living off gut instinct... I?d achieved everything I wanted to... Mentally and physically, then, I was through... Also, I think the England team needed to move on... Seeing the exuberance of young players like Andrew Strauss and Robert Key, I felt I had to step aside. 

How did you feel the morning after quitting? 

Great... I?d achieved what I wanted to and was in a position to proudly say I gave that hundred per cent each time I stepped out with the England cap... (Adds emotionally) I knew I had given cricket everything and, so, there was no remorse. Then, I went out with a Test hundred at Lord?s... Went out with an England win (over New Zealand)... Went out getting the winning runs... The script was perfect to say goodbye and, because of the circumstances, I was calm. 

What?s your legacy? 

We were literally at the bottom of the world when I took over the captaincy (in 1999)... I even remember England being booed at The Oval once... However, today, we?re close to the very top and it?s hugely satisfying... Of course, I was only responsible till last summer... I made a bad side into a good one and, since then, Michael (Vaughan) and (Duncan) Fletcher have made England into a team with the potential to beat anyone anywhere. Perhaps, some credit can come my way, but the finishing touches have been given by the coach and current captain. 

How much of a role did the Essex work ethic play? 

More than that, Fletcher played a big role... He took care of the off-field issues, like selection and politics, allowing me to focus on what I wanted England to achieve. When I took over, I found a what-will-be-will-be attitude and had to change that... I wanted England to play with passion and not leave anything to chance ? fitness or whatever. Basically, I wanted the side to play the way I did... Wanted the team to always give hundred per cent... I kept saying we may not be the best around, but that shouldn?t mean us lying down and being rolled over. 

Your decision to leave the captaincy appeared impulsive... 

(Laughs again) Most of my decisions were impulsive... Sometimes, even as the coin was up in the air, I wasn?t sure whether to bat or field... So, I would decide impulsively... Be it as a batsman or captain, I often went along with the gut feeling... That week in Edgbaston, I looked around in the dressing-room... Talked to Fletcher and realised that Michael had done very well (as captain) in the ODIs... Also, after four years, I had begun to tire mentally... The next Test (versus South Africa) was at Lord?s and I didn?t wish to lead not feeling a hundred per cent. (After a pause) In some ways, I?d ?lost? the side... The Alec Stewarts and Andrew Caddicks were gone... There was no Mark Ramprakash... The nucleus had gone and with so many young players, it was a different era. I was convinced England needed a younger captain. 

Do captains have a shelf life? 

Absolutely. You can?t afford to be stale and must not be repetitive. After four years, I simply didn?t have the energy to start all over again... A captain can get over-killed and, really, I doubt if that fresh burst of energy would have come from within me. 

But Stephen Fleming, somebody you admire, and Sourav Ganguly have been at the helm for quite a few years... 

But, remember, the nucleus of their respective teams hasn?t changed. A significant shift makes a difference. 

Your body-language in the last World Cup was different. Did the Zimbabwe controversy take a lot out of you? 

You?ve got it right... The pressure was enormous and, instead of cricket, we would be speaking about threats to players, the possibility of deaths as a result of Harare?s action against protesters... It was an awful time right in the middle of the most prized tournament... In fact, in deciding not to play (in Zimbabwe), I went through the worst two weeks of my life... It was a no-win situation and, 19-20 months on, I still haven?t forgotten those days... A lot of things were heaped on a group of cricketers and, clearly, that ought never to have been done. The ICC and the ECB should have foreseen what would happen. 

Steve Harmison has already pulled out of the forthcoming tour of Zimbabwe... 

Well, the saga continues... Like Harmison, each player is going to make an individual decision... It?s part of life... Part of being an international sportsman. 

Obviously, you?ve been impressed with Vaughan?s captaincy 

Initially, Michael captained by committee... He sought the views of others, asked a lot of questions and did the predictable things... He was, after all, settling into the job... After six months or so, Michael changed his style and has gone from strength to strength... Today, he is one of the best... Goes a lot by gut instinct, specially with field placements, and is very calm in the dressing-room. 

Is he fanatical about fitness? 

He is, that?s another reason why I decided to pack up. I recall the time we would lift weights (at the hotel gym) in Dhaka and my mind would be on the room service menu! 

In simple terms, what sets Vaughan apart from the other captains? 

His confidence... Michael looks to win every game... When I was captain, we first looked to staying afloat before... With Michael, though, his inner confidence has given England?s approach a fresh dimension... Plus, he has that relaxed air about him which encourages calm in the dressing-room. When I took charge, England needed somebody to shake up the players... I had to drive them... Slog hard... Now, England need somebody more relaxed ? Michael fits the bill. Indeed, he has allowed the Andrew Flintoffs and Harmisons to express themselves... 

What did you learn in 15 years at the highest level? 

You get back what you put in... Cricket, like life, has a way of giving a kick if you take anything for granted. Without getting too philosophical, I?ve always believed one will be successful if the effort is there. Looking for shortcuts doesn?t help. 

The last question: What were your thoughts when England knocked out Australia at Edgbaston? 

(Smiles) Frankly, that has been the one time 

in the past four months that I yearned to be in the dressing-room... Wanted to 

take in the happiness of the moment, the thrill of an achievement... But...

Excerpts from Nasser Hussains interview 

to The Telegraph on january 19, 2002 

 On captaining in the sub-continent, particularly 

India: 

It?s essential to have a plan or else the opposition could be 300 for two and your wheels will come off. I mean, you simply can?t ask the bowlers to bowl anywhere. Can?t, for example, bowl on both sides of the wicket when the batsmen are so talented. Also, if a plan isn?t in place, the noise-factor may encourage one to lose focus. It?s an extraordinary atmosphere even when a Sachin Tendulkar isn?t at the crease. The players, then, have to be reminded about the job at hand ? in other words, not losing focus. 

 On receiving awards for being an outstanding 

captain: 

Depends on which one and who is conferring it. If you want to know about the OBE, well, I felt great because the appreciation came from outside the (cricket) fraternity. Such recognition gets you to work doubly hard. It?s definitely very nice if a Duncan Fletcher has something positive to say, but that?s an internal appreciation. Anything from outside, therefore, is that much more special.

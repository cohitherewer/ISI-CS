 Bad light to SA?s rescue

 - Second test 

 England stopped 2 wkts short of ninth straight victory 

 Jacques Rudolph defends one on the final day of the second Test in Durban on Thursday. Rudolph was the top scorer with 61 

Durban: Bad light forced a draw in the second Test between South Africa and England on Thursday with the tourists needing only two wickets to record a ninth straight Test win. 

South Africa, who were set a target of 378, were 290 for eight in their second innings when the umpires offered the light to the batsmen with 15 overs left in the match. 

Englands players decided not to return to the dressing room and sat down on the turf in case the light improved but the game was then called off. 

Despite their disappointment, England have gone through 2004 without losing, winning 11 out of 13 matches. 

They won the first Test in Port Elizabeth by seven wickets last Tuesday to take a 1-0 lead into the third Test in Cape Town beginning Sunday. 

Jacques Rudolphs 61 was South Africas top score. Pace bowlers Matthew Hoggard and Steve Harmison claimed two for 62 and took two for 58, respectively. 

A.B. De Villiers remained unbeaten on 52, his maiden Test half-century, and Makhaya Ntini was on 16. 

De Villiers and Shaun Pollock had kept England at bay for 27 overs with a gritty eighth-wicket stand of 85 after the tourists looked poised for victory. 

The stand ended when De Villiers pushed a ball from Hoggard to mid-off and Pollock strayed out his ground to be expertly run out by Simon Jones 

Pollock batted for almost two hours for his 35 and he left the field with two blows to the fingers after being struck on both hands by Harmison. 

South Africa resumed on the final day on 21 for one and England made a good start in their quest for victory with Nicky Boje (10), Herschelle Gibbs (36) and dangerman Jacques Kallis (10) all falling in the morning session. 

Rudolph reached his seventh half-century, hitting eight fours and a six before left-arm spinner Ashley Giles, who did not bowl in the first innings because of a back spasm, had the left-hander caught off the glove by Andrew Strauss at short leg. 

Five balls later, Simon Jones trapped Hashim Amla in front for a second ball duck as South Africa slumped to 173 for six. 

They were soon 183 for seven when Martin van Jaarsveld edged Hoggard to Marcus Trescothick at first slip for 49. 

The floodlights were turned on 15 minutes before lunch before the light improved and they were turned off but they came on again with 19 overs left when the clouds returned. 

Vaughan had no complaints about the umpires? decision to offer South African batsmen the light. 

?It was pretty dark out there,? Vaughan told a news conference. ?I could have put (left-arm spinner) Ashley Giles and myself on (to bowl off spin) but the umpires did not offer me that choice. 

?But that?s not a real complaint. When it?s dark the lights don?t make much difference with the red ball.?

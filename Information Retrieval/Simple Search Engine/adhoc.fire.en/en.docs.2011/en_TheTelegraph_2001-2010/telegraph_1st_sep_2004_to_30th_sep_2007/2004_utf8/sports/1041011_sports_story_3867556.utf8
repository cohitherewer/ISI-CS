Hyderabad: India finally managed to find the momentum, albeit a little too late, as they registered a 2-0 win over arch-rivals Pakistan in the eighth and final hockey Test, even as the visitors claimed the friendship series 4-2. 

India, who arrived here having already lost the series, rode on goals from Sandeep Michael (17th minute) and Tushar Khandekar (21st) on Sunday to chalk out the victory. 

This was also India?s first win of the series on home soil as their earlier victory had come during the Pakistan leg, in the second Test in Quetta. 

Pakistan, who came to India with a 2-1 lead, won in New Delhi and Amritsar, while the Test in Chandigarh ended in a draw. Captain Dilip Tirkey returned from injuryto guide the team to victory under lights at the Gachibowli Stadium. Indian custodian Adrian D?Souza continued his fine show to win the Man of the Series award. 

Sohail Abbas, the highest goalscorer, was given a warm accolade as he walked under an umbrella of hockey sticks formed by Indian and Pakistani playersbefore the start of the match. 

The penalty corner expert was also given the Best 

Achiever award consisting of a cash prize of $1,000, while D?Souza got $2,000 

for being the Man of the Series.

 Ferdinand returns to England squad

 Rio Ferdinand returned to United after his eight-month suspension 

London: Rio Ferdinand, Wayne Rooney and Sol Campbell returned to the England fold as coach Sven-Goran Eriksson named his squad on Sunday for World Cup qualifiers against Wales and Azerbaijan. Manchester United defender Ferdinand was recalled for the first time since it was revealed 12 months ago that he had failed to attend a drugs test. 

Ferdinand, who recently returned to the United team following an eight-month suspension, was joined in the squad by striker Rooney, who last featured in the Euro 2004 quarter-final defeat by Portugal. 

Rooney, who suffered a broken foot in that game, scored a magnificent hattrick on his Manchester United debut in the 6-2 Champions League win over Fenerbahce on Tuesday and is expected to start for England against Wales. 

?It would be difficult to keep him out,? Eriksson said on the FA?s official website. ?I saw him on Tuesday and he was fantastic ? scoring three goals on his debut and he hadn?t played football since June. 

?So it?s very difficult to keep him out and why should I keep him out? He should play.? Rooney made a stunning impression during Euro 2004, scoring four goals in the tournament before injuring his foot. 

Eriksson was also boosted by the return of Arsenal defender Campbell who missed the early part of the season with an Achilles tendon injury. Campbell is expected to continue the partnership with Ferdinand that was interrupted by the United defender?s ban, although Chelsea?s John Terry and Tottenham Hotspur?s Ledley King have impressed in their absence. 

Manchester United?s Phil Neville was included along with Real Madrid striker Michael Owen, despite both being starved of first-team football. 

However, Owen is doubtful for the match because of a leg muscle injury. Owen was substituted early in the second half of Real Madrid?s 0-1 Primera Liga defeat by Deportivo La Coruna on Sunday. 

?The doctors told us he had a problem and we decided not to force it,? Real coach Mariano Garcia Remon said. 

In addition to the 23 players announced, Eriksson has named Chelsea left-back Wayne Bridge, who is struggling to overcome a calf injury.

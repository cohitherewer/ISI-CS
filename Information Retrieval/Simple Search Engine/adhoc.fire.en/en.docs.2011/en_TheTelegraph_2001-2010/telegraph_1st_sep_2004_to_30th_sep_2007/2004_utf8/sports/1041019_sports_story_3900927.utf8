The Telegraph - Calcutta

Best-ever finish by Arjun Atwal

 Arjun Atwal 

Brent Geiberger followed his father Al in winning the $4.8 million Greensboro Classic in North Carolina Sunday, the first time ever that father and son have won the same PGA Tour event. For the golfing aficionado in India, though, the day can be marked as a watershed of sorts. 

Calcutta?s Arjun Atwal earned a career-best sixth place finish, the best any Indian has finished in any major foreign tournament. The best he had done before this was a tied 13th finish at the Buick Championship late August. Atwal had had another slow start, a 71, and improved on it by a stroke in the next round. He was down to 68 in the third round, with only one bogey and in the final round he just cut off his bogeys. With birdies in the fifth, sixth, ninth, tenth. 12th and 13th, and parring the rest, he returned an incredible card of 66, finishing at 13-under. 

In the four rounds he hit a total of 15 birdies and 55 par shots. 

It?s not just that he earned $ 1,65,000 from this finish on his 29 USPGA Tour event, Atwal has so far accumulated $ 4,64,000. This sixth place finish will stand him in good stead, what with the renewing of the Tour card round the corner, in December. 

The positive fallout of this fine and steady show has been an invitation to the Funai Classic, at World Dysney World Resort in Philadelphia from October 21 to 24. With the sole exception of world No. 1 Vijai Singh, everybody who is anybody in world golf will be around, including Tiger Woods. Moreover, that?s a $ 4.2m prize money event, and Atwal?s purse will look even better. 

Geiberger, notching his second tour victory and securing his card for the next two years, was tied for the lead with Tom Lehman when the day began, but made a significant move early with consecutive birdies on his way to a final-round 66. 

He was five-under-par 31 on the front nine and in control, making only one other birdie on the back nine to finish at 18-under, two shots ahead of Michael Allen and three in front of Chris Smith. 

In three of his four rounds this week, Geiberger went around the Forest Oaks Country Club bogey free, including Sunday, and made a total of 20 birdies against just two bogeys, both coming in Saturdays third round. 

Coming into the week, Geiberger was 144th on the PGA Tour money list and earned $ 828,000 for his win. It was considerably more than his father, who 38 years ago won the same championship but collected only $ 48,000. 

It was also the first time the son of a tour player had won a PGA Tour event since Brent Geiberger?s first career win at the Greater Hartford Open in 1999. 

Allen was ranked 153rd when the tournament began, but a birdie at the last earned him $496,800 to secure his card for 2005. 

Smith, ranked 152nd, had a stretch where he was five-under for four holes mid-way through the back nine to finish solo third, winning $312,800 to also secure his card for next year. 

David Toms and Lehman finished at 14-under-par and tied for fourth. 

Indias Arjun Atwal finished at 13-under-par for solo sixth, his first top-10 ever on the PGA Tour and moved closer to keeping his card for 2005. 

Defending champion Shigeki Maruyama of Japan shot a final round two-over-par 74 and finished tied for 19th.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 EB refuse to accept Bhowmick resignation

 - ?The AFC Cup was my dream? I can?t take this defeat? 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: In a sudden and dramatic move, Subhas Bhowmick on Saturday quit as East Bengal coach. He handed over his resignation letter to club officials who had gone to the Netaji Subhas International airport to receive the team which flew back from Syria where they lost the AFC Cup quarter final. 

According to a club official late on Saturday night, 

Subhas Bhowmick has confirmed that he will join practice on Sunday. 

Bhowmick explained his decision was guided by the team?s failure in the AFC Cup. ?I am taking full responsibility of the debacle and stepping down so that someone else can do a better job.? 

The coach added: ?The AFC Cup was my dream, I had wanted to do something, but now? I can?t take this defeat.? He said he is presently not in the right frame of mind and has no idea about his next step. 

East Bengal had drawn goalless with Al Jaish at home, but crashed to 0-3 defeat in Damascus Wednesday. 

Club officials, though, refused to accept Bhowmick?s resignation. ?We are not accepting Bhowmick?s resignation. He will remain East Bengal coach. We have full confidence in him,? said club secretary Kalyan Majumdar. 

?We have a (Super Division championship leg) match coming up on Monday. We have nobody in mind to replace him,? said another official. 

Bhowmick?s decision came as a big surprise for East Bengal mainstay Douglas da Silva. ?I?m shocked? Had no idea this was coming,? the Brazilian said. 

Another dependable medio Alvito D?Cunha was equally taken aback. ?This is just the beginning of the season, we lost just one game? There?s the Super Division, the National League and other tournaments coming up. The coach should stay, we?ll try to convince him to change his mind,? the Goan observed. 

D?Cunha said the team will practise at the club ground at 3 pm on Sunday and hoped Bhowmick would be there. 

Though he hasn?t blamed the officials for his decision, it?s no secret that Bhowmick is disgusted with their failure to provide him some players he wanted. Brazilian striker Paolo Roberto, for instance, has been with the team for some weeks now, but couldn?t be fielded in either of the Al Jaish games as his name had not been sent to the AFC by the stipulated time. 

With Bhaichung Bhutia also out of action with an injury and Bijen Singh failing to deliver, lack of a potent striker hurt East Bengal. That was all the more reason why Bhowmick was banking on getting the services of Roberto for the double-leg AFC Cup quarter final. 

Roberto, by the way, signed up on Saturday.

 Sania awaits Aussie break

 Sania almost certain to play in Aussie Open 

New Delhi: Sania Mirza, who has broken into the top 200 in world rankings, is all set for an even bigger achievement in her fledgling career as the tennis sensation is almost certain to make it to the Australian Open Grand Slam next year. 

The Hyderabad girl won back to back Challenger titles in Nigeria last week that will push her from 233 to 195 on the WTA Tour when the list in updated over this week. 

If that in itself is a rare feat in Indian women?s tennis, an even bigger achievement will be credited to her when she plays at the Australian Open next year. Sania?s entry into the singles main draw will be via wildcard after she reached the final of the Asian tennis championships in Uzbekistan last month. 

Although it is the men?s and women?s champion of the Asia?s premier tennis event that get the courtesy from Tennis Australia, Sania should get the jackpot as Na Li of China, who beat her in the final, has gained direct acceptance due to her improved rankings. 

Tennis Australia is yet to officially intimate Sania of her wild card. But with Li, currently ranked 92, unlikely to fall below the cut-off mark for the Open, it remains only a formality. ?It (the intimation) should come in a couple of weeks. Somebody should make sure that the Chinese girl does not fall from her rankings,? Sania said on Tuesday. 

But for all her caution not to break the pot before the milk has boiled, the significance of playing at the world?s biggest stage does not go unnoticed on Sania who will turn 18 next month. ?It is a big, big break for me. I want to win at least one round, that is what I am basically looking at. It will be a huge jump for my career,? she said. 

The last Indian woman to be ranked in the top 200 was Nirupama Vaidyanathan who made it in 1996. 

Nirupama is also the only Indian woman to have won a Grand Slam tie so far. Incidentally, the Coimbatore girl accomplished the feat with a first round victory at the Australia Open in 1998 when, again, she earned a main draw wild card due to her being ranked highest in Asia then. 

Nigeria then has proved once again lucky for Sania since she won two $10,000 titles in 2003. The latest doubles success makes it a round dozen for the former Wimbledon junior doubles champion. 

These were her first at the $25,000 level. Add the maiden final appearance in Delhi in August, it makes for three in a row, ?which is not bad?, in her own words. 

?I am really playing well. I have changed my backhand, which has seen a big improvement. I think if by playing 12 tournaments I can make it to the top 200, I should be able to do more in the coming years,? said Sania. (PTI)

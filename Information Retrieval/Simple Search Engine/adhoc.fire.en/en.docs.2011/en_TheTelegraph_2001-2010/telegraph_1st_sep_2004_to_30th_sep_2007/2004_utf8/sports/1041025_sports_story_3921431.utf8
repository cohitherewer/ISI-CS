Gibbs not to tour India: Dad

 Hewitt 

Durban: South African opening batsman Herschelle 

Gibbs, who is under pressure to be interrogated by Delhi police regarding the 

match-fixing scandal, will not join the national team on the tour of India next 

month.

?Even if Herschelle is given the all clear by Indian 

police, the pressure would be too much for him to travel to India,? said the cricketer?s 

father in Cape Town on Saturday, a day after his son withdrew from his provincial 

Western Province team match. Gibbs senior said he did not want his son to be harassed 

in India.

UCBSA spokesperson Moabi Litheko said they had not 

yet received any correspondence from Gibbs and so would not be able to comment. 

He said the team for the two-match Test series in India would be selected next 

week.

Rio nearly quit

Sydney: Australian star Lleyton Hewitt was 

devastated by his break-up with Belgian fiancee Kim Clijsters, a press report 

said here on Saturday. Clijsters announced through her website on Friday that 

she and Hewitt had broken off their relationship just four months from their marriage 

next February.

The Sunday Telegraph said Hewitt had been called 

by Clijsters on Thursday to tell him that the relationship was over. Australia?s 

Wimbledon champion told friends that he was ?completely floored? by the news.

?He?s angry, embarrassed, devastated, distraught ? 

all of that stuff,? a friend told the paper. ?He?s been kicked in the guts and 

he?s been kicked in the guts internationally... He had a few signs but when it 

came, it came as a huge shock.?

Hewitt floored 

London: Manchester United and England defender 

Rio Ferdinand says he considered retiring from the international arena after being 

banned from all soccer for eight months for missing a drugs test. Rio, who returned 

to action last month, was angry at the verdict handed down by the FA.

?I was really bitter and if someone had asked me if 

I?d play for England again, I?d have said no,? he told MUTV. ?But as time passes, 

you come to your senses. You remind yourself that every kid wants to play for 

their country.?

 NZ playing mind game, says Waugh

 Steve Waugh feels New Zealand are trying to outfox the Aussies 

Sydney: New Zealand were trying to outfox Australia over their underdog status heading into this month?s Test series between the two trans-Tasman rivals, former Aussie Test skipper Steve Waugh said Thursday. 

Waugh, who retired from international cricket last January after playing 168 Tests, gave little credence to the Black Caps? claims that they were under-prepared for the tilt against the world cricket?s leading side after playing minnows Bangladesh. 

New Zealand skipper Stephen Fleming has missed his team?s tour-opener against New South Wales with a virus and experienced opener Mark Richardson has warned the Black Caps could expect a ?slap in the face? by the world champions after playing in Bangladesh. 

Australia begin their home series against New Zealand in Brisbane on November 18 followed by Adelaide (November 26-30). ?It?s typical New Zealand comments before a Test series, playing down their chances and the underdog stuff,? Waugh said Thursday. 

?They love that sort of role. But everyone knows that once they get out there against Australia they will lift, they have done that in the past.? 

Three years ago Fleming led New Zealand to a surprise three-Test series draw with the world champions, with Australia lucky to escape defeat in a tense final Test in Perth that was dominated by the tourists. 

World-class spinner Daniel Vettori said the Black Caps would be happy with a repeat of the 2001 nil-all result. ?We have come over here to win but we are under no illusions about how hard it would be,? said Vettori, who has been rested from the NSW match with shoulder stiffness. 

?If we walked away with a 0-0 or a 1-1 (result) I don?t think we would be the most unhappy side in the world but generally we are here to win.?

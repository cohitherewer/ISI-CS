 Bucharest: Fifa allows disgraced striker Adrian Mutu to train while under suspension but he cannot play official games or friendlies, the Romanian Football Federation (FRF) said on Friday.

 ?Fifa ratified Mutu?s ban and has extended it all over the world but only for all kinds of matches, including national or international, friendlies or official,? the FRF said. ?As a consequence...Mutu can train with his former club.?

 Mutu was banned by the FA for seven months and sacked by Chelsea last month after testing positive for cocaine. The FRF said Fifa?s ruling applies to a first-time doping ban. 

 La Paz: Bolivia?s players threatened not to board a flight to the United States in a row over their pay for Saturday?s friendly against Guatemala in Washington, local media reported on Friday.

 The squad had checked in at Santa Cruz airport in eastern Bolivia when the players demanded payment of $1,000 each rather than the $500 being offering by the Bolivian Football Federation (FBF).

 Airport announcements repeatedly requested the players to get on the plane while FBF directors discussed the situation before finally giving in.

 ?We have been victims of blackmail,? FBF general secretary Alberto Lozada said. 

 Paris: Liverpool?s French striker Djibril Cisse, who broke his leg during a Premier League game against Blackburn Rovers last month, said he was surprised by the referee?s attitude after his injury.

 The France international, who joined Liverpool from AJ Auxerre in the off-season, said he accepted rough tackling from English defenders.

 ?But referees... An injury like mine, for instance, in France the referee would have waited a little and made a decision afterwards. In this case, nothing happened. The ball went out and he said ?play?,? Cisse told L?Equipe on Friday.

 London: Jordan, fighting for survival after engine supplier Ford pulled out, confirmed on Friday that they would enter next season?s Formula One championship.

 ?We haven?t submitted it (the entry) yet but we will definitely do so before Monday?s deadline,? said a team spokeswoman.

 Jordan are close to finalising an engine deal with Japanese car giant Toyota and have also been talking to a potential Chinese backer, with team boss Eddie Jordan flying to Beijing last week.

 There has also been speculation about a possible involvement by Formula 3000 team boss Christian Horner.

 Struggling Minardi said this week they had already submitted their entry and Jordan?s confirmation would leave just Ford-owned Jaguar in doubt. 

 Karachi: China are likely to host the inaugural world school boxing championships next year, a top official said on Friday.

 ?We are in the final stages of holding the first-ever school level world championship next year,? AIBA president Anwar Chowdhry said. ?China is the likely host.?

 Boxers under 15 years of age will be eligible to compete.

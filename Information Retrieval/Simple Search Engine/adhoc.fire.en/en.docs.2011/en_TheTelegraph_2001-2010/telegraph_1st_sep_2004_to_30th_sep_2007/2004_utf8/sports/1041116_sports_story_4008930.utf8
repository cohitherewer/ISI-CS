Rosario: Holland beat Germany 2-0 to win the Women?s Champions Trophy and earned some compensation for losing their gold-medal showdown at the Athens Olympics. 

This is Holland?s third Champions Trophy title after victories in 1987 and 2000, while denying Germany their first tournament crown. 

Argentina edged Australia 3-2 to win the bronze medal, while China won their first match to claim the fifth spot by defeating New Zealand 3-0. 

In an initially cautious final, a day after the teams drew 1-1 in round-robin play, Kim Lammers claimed her fourth goal of the tournament then Naomi van As doubled the score four minutes after halftime and allowed the Dutch to cruise home. 

Germany, who upset Holland 2-1 in the Olympic final at Athens, struggled to break open the Dutch defence until the very end, when they forced two penalty corners in the final minute. 

Lammers fooled German goalkeeper Yvonne Frank and turned on her right shoulder to score the opening goal in the 24th minute. 

Germany had only one shot on goal in the first half-hour. 

A German goal by Fanny Rinne in the 32nd minute was overruled because nobody touched it in the circle. 

Both teams were more aggressive in the second half, and Van As made it 2-0 with a high shot that Frank only got a partial arm to. 

Frank was still named the tournament?s best goalie. Alejandra Gulla of Argentina claimed the highest-scorer?s honour with six goals, though none in the bronze-medal match.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Fresh lease of life for Ortega

Istanbul: Turkish side Fenerbahce said on Thursday they had reached a deal with Argentina?s Newell?s Old Boys on Ariel Ortega?s transfer, ending the World Cupper?s 18-month exile from the game. 

?Our club has reached an agreement with Argentina?s Atletico Newell?s Old Boys Club involving the transfer of Ariel Ortega,? Fenerbahce said on their website. 

?Once both clubs agree on the necessary conditions for the transfer, Fifa will issue Ortega a 10-day temporary licence. We will announce the details of his transfer in the coming days,? the club announced. 

Ortega was suspended by world governing body Fifa in February 2003 and ordered to pay $11 million in compensation to Fenerbahce for breach of contract. Ortega joined Fenerbahce from River Plate after playing for Argentina in his third World Cup in 2002. The $7.5 million deal was one of the Turkish club?s biggest transfers. 

But he failed to settle and left the club during his first season in Turkey. He hoped River Plate would take him back, but the Argentine club lacked the funds to even try to negotiate a way out of Fenerbahce for Ortega. Fifa brokered the deal.

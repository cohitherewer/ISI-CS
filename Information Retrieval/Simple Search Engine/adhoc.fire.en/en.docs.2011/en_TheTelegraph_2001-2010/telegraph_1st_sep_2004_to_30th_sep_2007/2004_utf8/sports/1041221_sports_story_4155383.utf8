The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Our job is to keep improving: Buchanan

Perth: Rivals have to catch up with the all-conquering Australians rather than Ricky Ponting?s team marking time, coach John Buchanan said on Monday. 

There is concern that Australia are proving just too good for the other Test-playing nations after annihilating New Zealand and Pakistan in recent matches. 

Australia flogged Pakistan by a massive 491 runs in the first of three Tests at the WACA ground well inside four days and there are fears of more of the same in the remaining Tests in Melbourne (from Sunday) and the New Year?s Test in Sydney. 

Buchanan said it was not his job to worry about how the cricket world would catch up with his stellar Australian line-up. 

?Our job is to keep improving individually and collectively and I always believe we can. 

?As soon as you think you can?t improve, that?s the time to get out of the game, very quickly.? 

Unchanged XII 

Australia have retained the same XII for the Boxing Day second Test with paceman Brett Lee again likely to miss out on the starting XI.

The butterflies were understandable for 19-year-old 

Svetlana Kuznetsova, playing in a Grand Slam final for the first time and under 

the prime-time lights. 

But once she dispensed with the nerves on Saturday 

night ? she had only four unforced errors to lose her serve in the first game 

of the US Open final ? Kuznetsova began unfurling merciless groundstrokes with 

the steely verve of a veteran, pummelling her listless Russian countrywoman, Elena 

Dementieva. 

Kuznetsova emerged in 74 quick minutes from the first 

all-Russian women?s final here as the first Open champion from that country. With 

34 winners helping her overcome 35 unforced errors, Kuznetsova dismantled the 

ailing Dementieva 6-3, 7-5, becoming the third straight woman?s champion in a 

Grand Slam tournament this year from Russia. 

But even as Kuznetsova delighted in her victory and 

Dementieva, 22, suffered from her second straight-set disappointment in a Grand 

Slam final this season, the two young women from Russia displayed poise and grace 

in the awards ceremony. With eloquent English, each commemorated the day by recalling 

the terrorist acts of September 11, 2001, in the United States and September 3, 

2004, at a school in Beslan, Russia. 

Kuznetsova dedicated her victory to the victims of 

both tragedies. ?I just hope we?re going to be together and it?s never going to 

happen again,? she said. 

Dementieva could not dedicate a victory, but she did 

ask for a moment of silence that stopped the crowd on a night that had little 

emotion until then. 

?Even that I lost today, it?s a great day as a tennis 

player, but it?s a day to remember September 11, 2001, and September 1, 2004; 

we lost hundreds of children in Russia,? Dementieva said, referring to the siege 

in Beslan that resulted two days later in hundreds of deaths. ?I want you guys 

to do everything possible to stay together and battle terrorism and have a moment 

of silence one more time.? 

The words from both players put a solemn ending to 

a night of personal achievement for Kuznetsova. Her doubles partner last year, 

Martina Navratilova, was in her friends? box. Kuznetsova recalled how Navratilova 

had given her this advice before taking the court: ?I did it when I was young 

in my first final, so you can do it too.?

It was the first time in the Open era that none of 

the top four seeded women reached the final in New York, and Kuznetsova, seeded 

ninth, took advantage in her first try. She covered her mouth in disbelief when 

she heard she had won $1 million. 

Even as Alan Schwartz, chairman of the US Tennis Association, 

had difficulty pronouncing her name before presenting her the trophy, Kuznetsova 

was unfazed. She had proven she belonged.

Two shots into the second game, Kuznetsova turned 

the aggressor, whipping a forehand winner that led to her service break of Dementieva. 

In the first set, Kuznetsova dictated play, blasting 17 winners. 

Dementieva put up more of a fight than in her 1-6, 

2-6 loss to Anastasia Myskina in the French Open in June. But a day after her 

three-set victory over Jennifer Capriati, Dementieva said she was slowed by a 

thigh injury sustained on Tuesday. 

For the fourth time in six matches at the Open, Dementieva 

lost the first set, but this time she could not force a third set. Her serve registered 

as high as 103 mph but she also had four crucial double-faults in the second set. 

?It?s all about my serve,? Dementieva said. ?I need to improve it if I want to 

win a Grand Slam.? 

Even her forehand was unable to compensate for her 

weak serve. Kuznetsova pounced on the short second serves, coming up with 23 forehand 

winners. 

Kuznetsova is built with the leg strength befitting 

someone whose mother was a six-time world champion cyclist and whose father coached 

five Olympic and world champion cyclists. Her brother, Nikolai, won a silver in 

cycling in the 1996 Olympics. 

Kuznetsova recalled last week how she was last in 

her first cycling race and bored in her second, so she switched to tennis. In 

1999, she moved from St Petersburg to Barcelona to train at the Sanchez-Casals 

Academy, where Arantxa Sanchez Vicario became her mentor and doubles partner.

She was playing absolutely great tennis today; it?s 

not about my injury,? Dementieva said, although she added: ?It really affected 

my game. When you play a Grand Slam, you don?t think about your injury, you want 

to win no matter what.? 

Dementieva said before the semi-finals that she had 

preferred not to play another Russian, saying they can always play in Moscow. 

But the Americans were not so obliging. 

With Serena and Venus Williams having departed, Capriati 

having left in tears of despair after another failed bid to reach the final and 

Lindsay Davenport limping out of the Open for perhaps the final time, the court 

was left to the Russians. 

Their domination has been steady and wide-reaching, 

including the Wimbledon winner, Maria Sharapova, as well. 

Last year, Justine Henin-Hardenne beat Kim Clijsters 

in a prime-time match-up of Belgians that drew a 2.5 rating, down 52 percent from 

the previous year, when the Williams sisters met for the second straight year. 

When Venus toppled Serena in 2001, the first prime-time final for the women, the 

rating was 6.8. 

?I don?t believe we need to look at ratings in a vacuum 

year to year or match to match,? said Arlen Kantarian, the chief executive of 

the US Tennis Association. ?We have to create new personalities.? 

Kuznetsova emerged with a bright and bubbly smile 

and an unforgiving forehand.

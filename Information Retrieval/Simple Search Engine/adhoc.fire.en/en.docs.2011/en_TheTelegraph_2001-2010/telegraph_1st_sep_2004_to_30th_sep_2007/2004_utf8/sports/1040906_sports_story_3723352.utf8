The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Sri Lanka high on confidence

 - CHAMPIONS TROPHY 

Colombo: Sri Lanka skipper Maravan Atapattu claimed his team had nothing to fear from any opponent as they left on their mission to defend their ICC Champions Trophy crown in England on Sunday. 

Sri Lanka have been filling up the cricket board headquarters with silverware in recent months, winning the Asia Cup and thrashing South Africa in both the Test series and one-day Internationals. 

Atapattus team have won 15 out of their last 16 one-day matches and climbed to second position behind Australia in the International Cricket Councils official limited overs rankings. 

However, Sri Lanka face a tough encounter against an equally buoyant England team on September 17 if they are to qualify for a semi-final showdown against New Zealand or Australia. We have the confidence and the spirit within the team now to face any side on any given day, Atapattu said after the squad and team officials were blessed by Buddhist monks prior to departure. 

At the moment we are lucky to have 14 players in our squad all pushing hard for selection the three who are left out each game can consider themselves unlucky, he added. 

While it is always nice to go into a game with an impressive record behind you, that soon becomes history when you play your next game. 

Sri Lankas first concern is adapting to late-season conditions in England and coach John Dyson travelled ahead of the squad to gather information on the pitches. 

We are not very sure of the exact conditions, however, we have two warm-up games and should be able to adjust accordingly, Atapattu said. At the moment we are just trying to concentrate and focus on the things that we can control. 

Sri Lankas winning formula is likely to be tinkered with as they draft in an extra batsmen at number seven to give more batting depth and use a three-pronged pace attack with spin back-up. 

World record wickettaker Muttiah Muralidharan will miss the trip after shoulder surgery, although he also travelled to London to attend the inaugural ICC Awards ceremony and will stay with the team during the first week. 

Batsman Tillekeratne Dilshan, who also contributes to the bowling attack with his off-breaks, will miss the first game after splitting the webbing of his right hand during the final one-dayer against South Africa. 

Sri Lanka shared the last ICC Champions Trophy in 2002 with India after the final was washed out.

 Announcer may land Hilliard Cup 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Barring a few outstation runners crowding the day?s fields, there is nothing exciting about Wednesday?s card. In fact, the fields are more like the monsoon kind, which may see crafty trainers playing their usual tricks at the expense of gullible punters.

 However, Vijay Singh?s Annoucer may land the Hilliard Cup if jockey C. Alford has got over last Friday?s hangover. He had a bad day and could start afresh. Announcer is not only well in at the weights, the Tecorno-Karishma?s Pet son is also doing well in his morning tryouts.

 In the Ardiles Cup, it may turn out to be a straight contest between Vijay?s Apprise and Daniel David?s Royal Bounty. Apprise is aspiring for a hattrick of wins despite his long lay-off. But Royal Bounty?s not so brilliant monsoon form may tilt scales in favour of Announcer. Alford partners the Don?t Forget Me-Sterling Lass four-year-old.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

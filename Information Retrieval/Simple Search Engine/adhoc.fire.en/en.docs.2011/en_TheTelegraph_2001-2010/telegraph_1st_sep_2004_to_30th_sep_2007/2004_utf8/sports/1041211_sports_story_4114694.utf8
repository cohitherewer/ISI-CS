 Sohail hints at quitting

 Sohail Abbas 

Lahore: Indicating that he was contemplating retirement in near future, Pakistan?s Sohail Abbas on Friday said he would be taking a ?major decision? regarding his career after the ongoing Champions Trophy. 

?I will be taking a major decision after the Champions Trophy. But I am not going to tell it now. I will announce it at an appropriate time and am looking forward to that moment,? Abbas said, when asked about his future plans in the wake of media reports that the world?s highest goal-scorer may quit the game after the six-nation event. 

The ace drag-flicker criticised the international hockey federation?s (FIH) decision to limit the bend of hockey sticks from 4.7 mm to 2.5 mm, claiming it to be yet another salvo aimed at the Asian teams. 

?They are changing the penalty corner rules frequently, as the Asian teams Pakistan, India and Korea are good at it. First they made it mandatory that the push from penalty corners must go outside the circle, now they are planning to cut down the curve,? he said.

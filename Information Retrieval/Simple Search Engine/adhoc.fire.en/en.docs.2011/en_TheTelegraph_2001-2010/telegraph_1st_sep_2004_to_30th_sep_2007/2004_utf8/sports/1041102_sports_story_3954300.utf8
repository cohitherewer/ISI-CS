 Must-win tie for Porto

London: Chelsea, Juventus and fellow-Italians AC Milan and Inter Milan seek to secure their place in the knockout phase of the Champions League with two games to spare this week as all four eye a fourth successive group victory. 

Milan have the toughest task as they visit Spanish league leaders Barcelona, who are second in group F on six points. Milan edged the reverse fixture at the San Siro 1-0 two weeks ago and would be delighted with a draw on Tuesday. 

Ukrainians Shakhtar Donetsk will probably have to win in Glasgow, against a Celtic team who have lost all three games so far, to remain in the hunt for an unlikely last 16 spot. Juventus are in a similar position as Milan having beaten their main rivals Bayern Munich 1-0 at home last time out. 

Juventus warmed up for the group C clash in Germany with a 3-0 weekend win over Chievo Verona that kept them clear at the top of Serie A, while Bayern stumbled to their third defeat in 11 Bundesliga matches, 2-0 at Borussia Moenchengladbach. 

Ajax Amsterdam, who have already lost to both front runners, will hope to cash in on another Bayern slip by chalking up a second successive win over Maccabi Tel Aviv, this time away. Inter are probably still pinching themselves after thrashing Valencia 5-1 away in the performance of the second round. 

If the Italians can repeat the group G result in the San Siro on Tuesday they can relax until February, leaving Valencia to fight it out with Werder Bremen for second spot. 

Werder are at home to Anderlecht, who have yet to manage a point. 

Chelsea, beaten semi-finalists last season, face an awkward group H trip to CSKA Moscow in the homeland of their billionaire owner Roman Abramovich. After starting the season on a positive but low-scoring note, Chelsea have suddenly found the way to goal. 

Champions Porto, who have just one point, could say goodbye to their hopes of retaining the trophy if they do not beat Paris St Germain in Portugal in the other group H game. 

Manchester United are finding it hard going in a section that was expected to be straightforward. They have five points and should still progress from group D, having drawn at Olympique Lyon and Sparta Prague. 

Lyon top the group with seven points and host Fenerbahce (3) who they beat 3-1 in Turkey last month. 

PSV Eindhoven can extend their lead in group E with a repeat win against Rosenborg Trondheim, whose preparations might have been upset by celebrations of their 13th consecutive Norwegian championship at the weekend. 

Arsenal, who saw their 49-game unbeaten league run ended at Manchester United a week ago and needed a last-gasp equaliser to prevent another defeat by lowly Southampton on Saturday, host Panathinaikos. 

Group B is the only one where three teams have all won a game ? leaving pointless AS Roma almost certainly out of the running already. 

Real Madrid face the always difficult November trip to Dynamo Kiev on Wednesday while Bayer Leverkusen visit Roma. 

Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez returns to Spain for the first time since leaving Valencia as his new club play 2004 semi-finalists Deportivo La Coruna in group A. 

Monaco, top on six points, visit Olympiakos Piraeus.

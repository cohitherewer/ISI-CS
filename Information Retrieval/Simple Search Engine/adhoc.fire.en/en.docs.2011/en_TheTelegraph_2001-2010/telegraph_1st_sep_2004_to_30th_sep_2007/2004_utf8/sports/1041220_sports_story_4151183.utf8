 New Delhi: India hung on to the fifth place in world rankings despite finishing outside the medal bracket in the recent Champions Trophy hockey tournament in Lahore.

 Federer, who is already in Australia preparing for the start of the next tennis season, thanked his home supporters via a satellite broadcast.

He will be out for four to six weeks but what we dont want is him to have surgery.?

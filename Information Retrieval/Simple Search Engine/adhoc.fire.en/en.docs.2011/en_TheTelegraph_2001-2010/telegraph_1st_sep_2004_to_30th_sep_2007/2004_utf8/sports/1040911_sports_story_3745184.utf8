The Telegraph - Calcutta

 I?ve learnt the value of consistency: Sourav 

 - ?I?m missing him (Sachin) but it won?t help if the team and I keep thinking about his absence? 

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI 

 Sourav Ganguly

Southampton: Sourav Ganguly isn?t as tense as he was till not many days ago, but is aware of the huge task ahead of Team India. The captain, who has had to redraw the Champions Trophy strategy keeping in mind Sachin Tendulkar?s absence, spoke to The Telegraph in neighbouring Portsmouth over breakfast on Friday. 

The following are excerpts 

Q Last Sunday?s win at Lord?s apart, the past few weeks have been difficult for the team. What was it like for you? 

A Collectively, we weren?t intense and (paid the price)... As captain, I don?t think I?ve lost four (completed) ODIs in succession and, so, even I had it tough... I accept that... However, I take heart from our performance at Lord?s... It will be great if we can build on that. 

What did you tell yourself? 

That I?ve got to keep my chin up... That the boys are going to be looking to me for direction... I?m happy I got that 90 (at Lord?s)... It put us on the road to victory.... It?s important for the captain to himself stand up and show the way when the team is caught in a bad patch. (After a pause) I?ve gone through a challenging period... As you know, I hate losing... Hate being a failure. 

Lord?s, of course, is special for you... 

It?s the biggest stage, probably the best ground anywhere... No matter who you are, the world watches when you play at Lord?s... Beginning with my Test debut (1996), when I got a 131, I?ve almost always got runs there... God has been kind. 

After the loss in Nottingham (first NatWest Challenge match), you spoke of your captaincy being on test... 

I meant the responsibility increases when the team isn?t doing well... That I had to be good enough and strong to take the team out of such a situation... 

Is there something you have specifically learnt in the last few weeks? 

The value of consistency and playing to potential. 

Why do players and teams not play to potential? 

(Grins) That?s a tough one... Taking time to get used 

to conditions, not being able to quickly shake off the off-season blues... Perhaps, 

not recovering fast enough between games... I?m not trying to list excuses, but 

the reasons may well be many. 

Is Sachin?s non-availability weighing you down? 

I?m missing him, but it won?t help if the team and I keep thinking about his absence. 

You must be happy returning to an opening slot... 

Yes... But, if the situation demands that I again go down, I will.... I?m quite flexible. 

Why isn?t Virender Sehwag getting runs? 

(Interrupting) I?ve already told him we are backing 

him, that we have faith in his ability... It?s important to adjust when one comes 

out of the sub-continent and, indeed, Veeru needs to change his approach a bit... 

Unless it?s a belter (outside the sub-continent), one should play out the first 

seven-eight overs instead of trying to score off each ball... Veeru has the potential 

to score big even if he doesn?t get more than a few in the opening seven-eight... 

Basically, he must change his mind set. 

Looking to the Champions Trophy, isn?t Kenya a potentially soft start? 

Don?t think so... Didn?t they make the semi-finals of the last World Cup? Irrespective of the opposition, we have got to play with heart and come through the difficult moments. 

Our next match is going to be against Pakistan. Will the two defeats (Colombo, Holland) be a factor when we take the field at Edgbaston? 

Not at all... In fact, why not also look at our wins in Pakistan? Good or bad, I do believe the past is past... Today, I?m confident about beating Pakistan and moving to the semi-finals. 

 Sourav has faith in Sehwags ability

Is Bob Woolmer our biggest threat in the Pakistani 

ranks? 

(Laughs) He?s good and, eventually, will make a difference... 

Of late, why have our bowlers been so inconsistent? 

That?s because they haven?t pitched in the right area... Fortunately, they bowled well at Lord?s, particularly early on, and I?m hopeful things are going to be in place in the Champions Trophy as well. 

Are you obsessed with playing seven batsmen? 

It?s not about my being obsessed or otherwise, but that?s something which has clicked... But, when it?s not working, I?m not opposed to a review... It will be nice if (Dinesh) Karthik makes the most of opportunities, as I can then play six batsmen and allow Rahul (Dravid) to focus on one job. 

You?re close to 10,000 ODI runs... Being a mere 301 away, is there a sense of excitement? 

Yeah... It?s going to be a nice milestone... Something that will drive me in the Champions Trophy... 

The final question: Former England captain Mike Atherton had quite a few nasty things to say about you in his column on the morning of the Lord?s game. Did that add to your determination for a big one that afternoon? 

I don?t read columns by experts... Incidentally, how many times did Atherton struggle in his career?

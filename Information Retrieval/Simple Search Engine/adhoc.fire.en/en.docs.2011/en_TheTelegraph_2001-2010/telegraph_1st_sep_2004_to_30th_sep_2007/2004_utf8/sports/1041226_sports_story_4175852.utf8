 Mary Ann got the better of J.E. Kavitha 

Bikaner: International Master S. Poobesh Anand defeated overnight leader Nguyen Van Huy of Vietnam to join the leading trio after the fifth round of the 27th Asian junior chess championship here on Saturday. 

On a mixed day for Indian hopefuls, second seed IM M.R. Venkatesh crashed to his second defeat in the event and was pushed down by Amanov Mesgen of Turkmenistan. 

Mesgen, who had accounted for top seed IM Anton Fillipov of Uzbekistan in the first round, took his tally to 3.5 points while Venkatesh stayed on 2.5. With six rounds remaining in this under-20 event, Poobesh Anand, Huy and former national sub-junir champion S. Arun Prasad share the lead with four points each in their kitty. 

Half-a-point adrift of the leaders are Abhijeet Gupta, Deepan Chakravarthy, G.N. Gopal and Mesgen. 

In the girls? category, Hoang Thi Bao Tram of Vietnam scored her fifth victory on the trot, accounting for N Raghavi in a one-sided affair. 

Tram stretched her lead to a full point over nearest rival GM Dronavalli Harika, who defeated Siti Zulaikha of Malaysia to move on four points. Soumya Swaminathan, Kruttika Nadig and Raghvi share the third spot with 3.5 points each. 

Among others, Mary Ann Gomes got the better of J. E. Kavitha. (PTI)

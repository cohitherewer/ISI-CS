Mumbai: Former Pakistan captain Imran Khan 

won?t feature on Ten Sports? commentary team for the (one-off) India versus Pakistan 

ODI at the Eden on November 13. 

Imran, it may be recalled, was the biggest draw during India?s March-April tour of Pakistan. In fact, he was on the commentators? panel for all five ODIs and the first two Tests ? Multan and Lahore. 

A Member of the National Assembly for the past two years, Imran skipped the last Test, in Rawalpindi, as his former wife Jemima and sons had come over to Islamabad from London. 

?Perhaps, I would have given it (the forthcoming ODI) 

some thought had I not already agreed to speaking at a leadership conference in 

Hong Kong around the same time,? he told The Telegraph on Friday morning, 

shortly before leaving for New Delhi. 

That conference will end on November 12/13 and Imran is going to head straight back home for Id. 

?Actually, right after Id, I?ll be tied up with the launch of the Shaukat Khanum (Cancer Hospital) unit in Karachi and, then, I?m going to get busy with a mass movement against the present dispensation,? he added. 

Imran heads the Tehrik-e-Insaaf party, formed weeks after the bloody blast at the Shaukat Khanum (Lahore) in early 1996. 

Incidentally, cine icon Aamir Khan has agreed to launch the Karachi unit in mid December. Diva Aishwarya Rai too will do her bit... Only, if she can?t make it with Aamir, the former Miss World is probably going to be the star attraction at a subsequent fund-raiser. 

?I?ll always remain indebted to the many friends in India who gladly keep helping a cause,? Imran remarked, touched by the spontaneous response from Aamir and Aishwarya. 

Imran, who spent about 48 hours here, should be in 

the capital for three days. In between, he could make a trip to Ajmer.

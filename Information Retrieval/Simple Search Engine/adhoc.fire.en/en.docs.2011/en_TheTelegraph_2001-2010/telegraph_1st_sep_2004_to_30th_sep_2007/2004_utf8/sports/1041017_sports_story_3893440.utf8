 Anand hands India early lead

 Anand posts a crushing win over Costa Rica GM Ramirez 

Mallorca: Viswanathan Anand gave India an early lead in the second round of the 36th Chess Olympiad with a crushing victory over Costa Rica GM Alejandro Ramirez. 

Anand, in whose absence the Indian team could manage only a 2.5-1.5 victory over Uruguay in the first round game, gave an emphatic display to outplay Ramirez from the white side of a French defence game. The victory came in almost no time as the game ended in just under two hours time. 

At the time of going to press, the other Indian men team members Krishnan Sasikiran, P. Harikrishna and Surya Shekhar Ganguly were in fine position and it might well be a clean sweep for the Indians. 

Earlier, Indian men were off to an average start over unfancied Uruguay in the opening round. The Indian women, in contrast, were off to a flying start, scoring a crushing 2.5-0.5 victory over Mexico in the first round. 

Krishnan Sasikiran and Abhijit Kunte were held to draws with black pieces, while P. Harikrishna had to split points with the favourable colour in the men?s fray. 

Sandipan defeated Alejandro Bauza in a finely crafted game to gain full points. 

Among the women, top seeds and defending champions China dropped half-a-point, en route to a 2.5-0.5 triumph over Norway. 

WGM Nisha Mohota too came up with a spirited performance to outclass Guadalupe Vasquez who played the black side of a Semi Slav. Nisha got a commanding position in the opening itself and went for a direct attack in the middle game. (PTI)

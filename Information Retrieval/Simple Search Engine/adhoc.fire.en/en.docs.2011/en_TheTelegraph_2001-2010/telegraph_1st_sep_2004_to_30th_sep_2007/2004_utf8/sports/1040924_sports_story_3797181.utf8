The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Mumbai 198 all out 

Mohali: Ranji Trophy champions Mumbai suffered a dramatic collapse and were bundled out for 198 against Rest of India in their first innings of the Irani Trophy match here on Thursday. 

At stumps on the second day, Rest of India were 84 for two in the second innings. Aakash Chopra 26 and skipper Dinesh Mongia on two were on the crease. Medium pacers Zaheer Khan and Shib Shankar Paul bagged three wickets apiece. 

It was a pathetic display by Mumbai as after dismissing the last four Rest of India wickets for 18 runs. 

Resuming at their overnight score of 293 for six, Rest of India were in trouble from the very beginning in front of Robin Morris and collapsed to 314 inside the first 10 overs in the morning. The two unbeaten batsmen ? Parthiv Patel and Murali Kartik, who had added a valuable 95 on Wednesday, fell early on. Morris returned with a figure of six for 69, the fourth time that he picked up a five-wicket haul in first-class cricket. 

Mumbai batsmen, in reply, also fumbled with only two of them crossing the 20-run mark. Shib Shankar Paul, who had a successful tour with India A in Zimbabwe and Kenya along with Team India seamer Zaheer Khan wrecked the Mumbai top order. Zaheer gave away 46 runs while Paul conceded 43 runs. Ramesh Powar top-scored with 55 from 86 balls. 

Mumbai also had to cope with the loss of Munaf Patel, who was ruled out of action for six to eight weeks following a shoulder fracture he suffered while bowling on Wednesday. 

Fifteen wickets fell on the second day of the match.

 India go down 2-3 to Spain

Chandigarh: India squandered a two-goal lead to go down 2-3 against Spain in the first of the two-match hockey Test series here on Sunday. 

The hosts went up 2-0 by the 18th minute, but the Spaniards bounced back to level the scores in the first half itself. 

Eduard Arbos scored the winner just three minutes before the final whistle. The series is being played as part of preparations for next week?s Champions Trophy in Pakistan. 

Sandeep Singh converted a penalty corner to give the team a 1-0 lead in the 14th minute before Hari Prasad doubled it with a field goal four minutes later to put the visitors on the back foot. 

But Spain got their act together, despite being under tremendous pressure, and levelled the score within a span of four minutes. 

Santiago Freixa?s double strike in the 26th and 30th minute took the teams to the halftime with 2-2.

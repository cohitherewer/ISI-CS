 Zoysa doubtful starter 

Wellington: Fast bowler Nuwan Zoysa is a doubt for Sri Lanka?s first one-day International with New Zealand this weekend after dislocating a finger on Tuesday. 

The Sri Lankan left-armer hurt the finger attempting a return catch off Ewen Thompson against Central Districts at New Plymouth. 

A team doctor was able to put the digit back in place but Zoysa had also suffered a deep cut that needed stitching, casting doubts over his chances of playing the Kiwis on Sunday. 

Tuesday?s warm-up match, Sri Lanka?s first on a tour that features five one-day Internationals and three Tests, was later abandoned after heavy rain. 

The home side batted first, making 220 for seven from 49 overs, and Sri Lanka were 20 for two in reply when the match was called off because of the persistent showers. 

New Zealand Test allrounder Jacob Oram top-scored for Central Districts with 74 off 78 balls, hitting four boundaries and three sixes in a powerful display. 

With Muttiah Muralidharan unavailable as he recovers from shoulder surgery, Zoysa was the pick. (Reuters)

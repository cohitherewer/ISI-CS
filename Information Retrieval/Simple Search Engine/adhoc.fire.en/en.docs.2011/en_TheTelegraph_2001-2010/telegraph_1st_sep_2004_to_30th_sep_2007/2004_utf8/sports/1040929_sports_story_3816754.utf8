 Vijai hits the Jeanne hazard

 Vijai Singh 

Ponte Vedra Beach (Florida): World No.1 Vijai Singh has decided not to play in this week?s World Golf Championships American Express Championship in Ireland after damage here at his home from Hurricane Jeanne. 

The 41-year-old from Fiji won his eighth title of the year Sunday at the 84 Lumber Classic and broke Tiger Woods? single-season PGA prize money record. Singh has won ? 9.45 million in 2004 to surpass Woods? ? 9.18 million in 2000. 

But Singh put his charge to ? 10 million on hold, and turned his back on a rematch with Woods at Kilkenny because the storm that struck here Sunday knocked out water and electricity at his home. 

Singh took the top ranking from Woods in a man-to-man duel down the final holes of the Deutsche Bank championship in Boston earlier this month, ending Woods? five-year reign atop the golf world. 

Singh has won five of his past six starts, including his third major crown at last month?s PGA championship, and has a stranglehold on the money record, top ranking and Player of the Year honours. 

?I really did not think about the money until the guys started talking about it two weeks ago when I won,? Singh said. ?But I?ll take it.? 

Meanwhile, Vijai is scheduled to be back in India for the Bilt Skins 2004 at the DLF Golf and Country Club, Gurgaon, from November 13 to 14, adds a report from New Delhi. 

It will be the first time when a highest ranked player of the world set his foot on Indian soil. When Vijai had come last he was No. 6, Tiger Woods was the top man in world golf. Vijai, who won the inaugural event in 2002, will lead a glittering field.

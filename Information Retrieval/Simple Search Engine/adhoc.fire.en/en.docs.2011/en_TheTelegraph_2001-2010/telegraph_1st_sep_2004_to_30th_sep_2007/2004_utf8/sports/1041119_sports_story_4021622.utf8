Rio de Janeiro: World champions Brazil crashed to a shock 0-1 loss in Ecuador on Wednesday while home wins for Peru, Colombia and Uruguay kept the South American World Cup qualifying group wide open. 

Peru beat neighbours Chile 2-1 in a pulsating match, Uruguay captain Paolo Montero escaped a red card and then scored in the 1-0 win over Paraguay and Colombia beat Bolivia by the same score. 

Argentina?s 3-2 win over Venezuela in Buenos Aires took them top of the 10-nation group with 22 points from 11 games, two more than Brazil who lost their unbeaten record 2,800 metres above sea level in Quito. Below the ?big two?, only three points separate third-placed Paraguay and Ecuador (both on 16) from ninth-placed Venezuela (13). 

The top four teams qualify directly for the Germany finals in 2006 while the fifth plays off against the Oceania region winners.Brazil striker Ronaldo blamed the altitude after his side was sunk by midfielder Edison Mendez?s well-struck shot from the edge of the area. 

Brazil?s players arrived from their European clubs less than 48 hours before kick-off, although several of the Ecuador team also completed trans-Atlantic journeys on Monday. 

Argentina never had it easy against Venezuela, despite being gifted a fourth-minute lead in Buenos Aires when Jose Manuel Rey headed into his own net. 

Ruberth Moran equalised with a brilliant individual goal ?his fifth in the last three games ? before a Juan Roman Riquelme free-kick gave Argentina a 2-1 lead at half-time. 

Javier Saviola made it 3-1 before Argentina goalkeeper Roberto Abbondanzieri?s blunder allowed Leonel Vielma to pull one back from a free-kick. Peru?s 2-1 win over Chile in Lima left both teams on 13 points, above Venezuela on goal difference. Second-half goals from Jefferson Farfan of PSV Eindhoven and Bayern Munich?s Paolo Guerrero put Peru in control. 

But there was a dramatic finale as Sebastian Gonzalez pulled an injury-time goal back for Chile, then missed a chance to equalise with the last kick of the game. Peru defender Santiago Acasiete and Chilean midfielder Rodrigo Melendez were sent off after clashing in the 41st minute. Montero, who returned to the Uruguay team this year after quitting in 2002, headed home in the 78th minute in Montevideo to lift his team to fifth on 14 points. The 33-year-old Juventus player, however, was lucky to be on the pitch, having escaped with a yellow card after a reckless lunge on an opponent in the first half. 

Colombia also needed a headed goal from a defender, Mario Yepes of Paris St Germain giving them a 1-0 home win over Bolivia in Barranquilla. 

In Europe, Andriy Shevchenko scored twice as Ukraine won 3-0 in Turkey to put them in a great chance of qualifying for the first time. 

Their impressive victory over the 2002 semi-finalists was the highlight of the evening?s 13 European qualifiers, which also included good wins for Portugal, Russia, Serbia and Montenegro and the Czech Republic. 

Ukraine, yet to qualify for a major tournament since gaining independence in 1991, are well placed to advance directly from group II after moving to 11 points, five clear of the Turks, Albania and Denmark.Shevchenko?s Milan teammate Jon Dahl Tomasson also found the net twice to put Denmark ahead in Tbilisi but Georgia hit back for a 2-2 draw to stay in contention on five points. 

European champions Greece are also on five after collecting their first win of the campaign, 3-1 at home to Kazakhstan. Angelos Haristeas grabbed the first two and Costas Katsouranis completed the win. 

It was also a night to remember for captain Theodoros Zagorakis, who became the first Greek to reach 100 international caps. 

Portugal made it 20 goals in five games as a 5-0 away rout of Luxembourg took them clear at the top of group III. Pauleta scored two and there were also goals for Luis Boa Morte, Cristiano Ronaldo and Maniche as Portugal moved to 13 points. 

Russia rebounded well with a 4-0 home victory over Estonia that left both countries on seven points. 

Romania?s flying start in group I was halted in Yerevan where they were held 1-1 by Armenia. 

The result enabled The Netherlands to join Romania at the top on 10 points after goals by Philip Cocu, Arjen Robben and Wesley Sneijder beat Andorra 3-0 in Barcelona. 

The Czech Republic are a point back on nine, alongside Finland, after two goals in the last three minutes secured a 2-0 win in Macedonia. 

Israel joined Ireland and France at the top of group IV on eight points after a 2-1 victory in Cyprus. 

Belgium have qualified for the last six World Cup finals but that run is in jeopardy after a 0-2 loss at home to Serbia and Montenegro which kept them on one point after three games in group VII. (Reuters)

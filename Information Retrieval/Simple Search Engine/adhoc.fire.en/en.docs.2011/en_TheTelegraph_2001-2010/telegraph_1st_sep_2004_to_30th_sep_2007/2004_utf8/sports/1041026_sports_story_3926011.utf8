Madrid: Barcelona stayed five points clear at the top of the Primera Liga as two goals by Samuel Eto?o and a Ronaldinho penalty sealed a 3-0 home win over Osasuna on Sunday. 

Earlier, Sevilla leapfrogged Valencia to take second place after spectacular strikes from Aitor Ocio and Julio Baptista earned a 2-1 victory at home to Atletico Madrid. 

Barcelona, the only unbeaten side in the league, lead the table with 22 points from eight games, Sevilla have 17 and champions Valencia are third, a further three points back after slipping to their second successive defeat. Real Madrid recorded their first league win in four games on Saturday when they beat Valencia 1-0 at the Bernabeu thanks to a classy strike Michael Owen. 

Ronaldinho chipped a clever pass over the defence towards striker Eto?o on the left of the area and the African Player of the Year caught ?keeper Ricardo Sanzol off guard when he volleyed into the far corner. 

The Navarrans hardly had time to draw breath before they went 0-2 down, Ronaldinho scoring from the penalty spot after he was adjudged to have been pushed by midfielder Patxi Punal as he jinked into the area. The game lost momentum after the break, but Barcelona wrapped up an emphatic win in stoppage time when Eto?o danced into the area, exchanged a pass with midfielder Andres Iniesta and drilled home his seventh goal of the season. 

Joaquin Caparros? young Sevilla side made it four home wins out of four as they outplayed visitors Atletico with their powerful mixture of intense and skillful football. 

The performance of the day came from Argentine midfielder Juan Roman Riquelme, who scored one goal and made two to inspire Villarreal to a 4-0 victory over struggling Numancia, who dropped to the bottom of the table. 

In Italy, champions AC Milan were held to a goalless draw by city rivals Inter on Sunday, allowing Lecce to take second place behind leaders Juventus with a 4-1 win at Messina. 

Milan?s run of four straight derby wins ended at the San Siro against a determined Inter side, who maintained their unbeaten record this season with their fifth draw in seven Serie A matches. Promoted Messina had not lost at home for more than two years but two goals from Serbian striker Sasa Bjelanovic helped Lecce to an impressive win. 

Parma beat Lazio 3-1, and AS Roma had to come from a goal down to earn a 1-1 home draw with Palermo. Juventus won 3-0 at Siena on Saturday and have a five-point lead over Lecce and Milan. (Reuters)

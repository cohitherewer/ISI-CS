 Row over Sally rocks Aussie boat

 Sally Robbins 

Sydney: Australians always take their sport more seriously than most and the saga surrounding the Olympic women?s rowing team has revealed an ugly side to the country?s obsession with winning. 

More than three weeks after the Athens Olympics closed, the bitter spat between members of the women?s eight shows no sign of ending. The crew has been squabbling ever since they missed out on a medal after one of their number, Sally Robbins, collapsed during the final. 

Robbins, citing a combination of exhaustion and anxiety, stopped rowing about 500 m from the finish, ending the team?s chances of a medal. 

The media had a field day, dubbing her ?Lay Down Sally?, while newspapers described her as ?Just Oarful? and blared headlines such as ?It?s eight, mate, pull your weight.? The crew earned their own moniker as the ?hate eight? and Australian Olympic officials ordered them to undergo counselling. 

The rowers appeared at a news conference in Athens to announce they had made up with Catriona Oliver saying: ?Things didn?t go well, but we?re not punching each other? 

Oliver?s words had a hollow ring two weeks later when she was ordered to appear before a disciplinary committee for slapping Robbins during an official welcome-home dinner. The saga, it seems, will keep running. (REUTERS)

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Bhupathi?s Olympic dream not over yet

 A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Missing a medal in Athens by a whisker still hurts Mahesh Bhupathi. In fact, it?s been the biggest disappointment of his career. But the Bangalorean is hopeful of giving himself another shot at Olympic glory in four years? time. 

?I?m 30 and definitely not over the hill, and Leander?s a year older, so you never know? We?ll see how the next two-three years go, then we?ll have an idea where we stand vis-?-vis the 2008 Beijing Olympics,? Bhupathi said shortly after signing as brand ambassador for Bengal Peerless in the city Saturday afternoon. 

Refusing to subscribe to the theory that a lack of perfect understanding with one-time Tour partner Leander Paes may have cost them a medal, Bhupathi said: ?The chemistry in Athens was the best we ever had? it?s just that we needed some luck but didn?t have it.? 

The Athens ?failure? apart, Bhupathi hasn?t had a good run on Tour with regular partner Max Mirnyi of late. The Indo-Belarussian pair failed to go beyond the third round at both Wimbledon and US Open. ?Max has slipped from the top-20 to No. 70, that hasn?t done his confidence any good. Maybe that?s why he hasn?t produced his best in doubles,? Bhupathi argued. 

Making the most of a fortnight?s break, Bhupathi will get back on Tour at the Thailand Open beginning September 27. Paes will be his partner there ? a one-off arrangement as neither will have his regular partner in Bangkok. 

Bhupathi will rejoin Mirnyi the week after Bangkok, in Lyon. ?I?ll play four weeks with Max and one tournament with Jonas (Bjorkman) before the Masters in Shanghai,? Bhupathi informed. 

The year-end Masters championship will bring together eight teams of which one (the French Open champions) has got a wild card. ?Seven teams will qualify, we are right now No. 6? we have some work to do,? Bhupathi said. 

On his third visit to the city in the last one year ? wife Shweta is accompanying him for the first time ? Bhupathi had a busy day. Trips to various Peerless sites, signing the three-year contract with the company, a media conference, courtesy calls to business houses? He has more coming up the next two days. 

For a change, though, the seven-time Grand Slam doubles winner had to play second fiddle once wife Shweta made an appearance at the conference. Having given up her four-year modelling career, the tall, graceful lady from Chennai is settled in Bangalore looking after husband?s marketing company Globosport.

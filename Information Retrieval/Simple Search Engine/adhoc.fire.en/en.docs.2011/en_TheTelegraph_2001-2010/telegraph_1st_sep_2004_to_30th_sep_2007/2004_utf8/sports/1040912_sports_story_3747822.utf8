Calcutta: Mohun Bagan coach Subrata Bhattacharya once again raked up a controversy when he decided to take on club loyalists close to the administrators. The coach, speaking at the post-match press conference, hinted he might stay away from the club unless immediate steps are taken to solve the issue. 

Bhattacharya said he has been made the target of verbal abuse coming from a section of the club loyalists. His resentment has been such that he refused to enter the dressing room after the derby against East Bengal at the Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday. 

?I won?t enter the dressing room unless those responsible for abusing me are ordered out of the place,? the Bagan coach said. He said he would take up the matter with Bagan?s court-appointed special officer, Justice Shyamal Sen. 

However, Bagan assistant general secretary Balaram Chowdhury criticised the coach for his comments in front of the media. ?This is not a forum to voice such matters, he could have spoken to us,? Chowdhury said. 

?Those who enter the dressing room does so with my permission. If the coach has any grievance against anybody, we will definitely address the matter,? Chowdhury added. 

Chowdhury, however, brushed aside the issue when asked about the coach?s reluctance to join the team at practice on Monday, saying that they would soon find a solution. 

Asked about the match, Bagan coach felt players from both camps were tense. The rain, too, created its own problem, which he felt suited the opposition rather than his newly-built team. Overall, he was satisfied with the match?s result, which ended goalless, as it helps the club to hold on to the single point lead in the Super Division table. Bhattacharya picked out Sunil Chetri and Brazilian Eduardo from his camp and Debjit Ghosh from the opponents for special mention. 

His opposite number, Subhas Bhowmick rued the fact that they failed to win the match. ?I wanted my boys to win keeping in mind the AFC Cup match (against Al Jaish on Wednesday).? 

The coach felt the team needs to improve if they are to win the match against Al Jaish. ?We have to play more passes and need to score goals,? which though, looks to be the troubled area with ace striker Bhaichung Bhutia sidelined with injury. The coach hopes that with Roberto Paolo ? the latest Brazilian recruit whose international transfer certificate arrived on Saturday ? the problem could be solved.

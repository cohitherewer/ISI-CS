 Bengal in final

Margao: Bengal scored a solitary goal win over Meghalaya to sail into the final of the 27th sub-junior (under-16) national football meet on Sunday. 

Bengal will clash for the title with Mizoram on Tuesday. Mizoram rode a solitary goal strike to eliminate Tamil Nadu in the other semi-final. 

Bengal scored the all-important goal in the 23rd minute through Sudip Banik. The Bengal striker slotted the ball in, after rival custodian Alwyn Patweth failed to collect the ball cleanly off a Samanta Shee shot from inside the box. Banik, who was lurking near, shot home as the ball slipped of Patweth?s hands. (PTI)

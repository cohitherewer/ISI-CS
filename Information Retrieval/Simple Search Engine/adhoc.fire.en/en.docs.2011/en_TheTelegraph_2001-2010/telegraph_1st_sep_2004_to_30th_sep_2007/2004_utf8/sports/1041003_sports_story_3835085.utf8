Meet revived after 13 years

Lahore: Pakistan and India have decided to revive a bilateral golf event suspended for 13 years after easing of tensions between the neighbours, an official said on Saturday. 

A four-member Indian team plus a veteran player will participate in the Kirlosker Trophy last played in New Delhi in 1991. The competition, based on the format of the Ryder Cup played between Europe and the United States, will be played from Monday to Wednesday. 

?It is a fantastic feeling, to see cricket and hockey back on track and now it?s a historic occasion as we revive the golfing relations,? Pakistan Golf Federation official Asad Khan said. 

The tournament was first held in Bangalore in 1989, reciprocated by Pakistan when it was held in Islamabad the following year. India staged the third edition in New Delhi in 1991, but the fourth edition could not be held in Lahore in 1993 due to political tensions. 

The Indian team comprises Vikrant Chopra, Jaydeep Patwardhan, Jaskirat Singh and Amarbir Singh. There will also be an above-50 category. The Pakistan team is Javed Khan, Vaqas Ahmed, Dr Aimal Zaman and Tariq Mahmood. 

India also participated in an international event in Karachi and then in the Saarc Trophy in Lahore earlier this year. The Kirlosker Trophy will involve singles, foursome match play as well as four-ball match play. (AFP)

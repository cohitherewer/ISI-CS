The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Shunned media boycotts match

New Delhi: The Elite group A Ranji match between 

Delhi and Andhra Pradesh is being held sans a single spectator and even the media 

was thrown out with the help of police on Thursday. 

The match at the Roshanara Club ground was marred 

by ugly scenes when journalists were shoved away from the venue by policemen. 

Club authorities, irked by reports in the media criticising the club?s policy 

of not allowing spectators for the match, called the police. 

Club authorities demanded an ?unconditional apology? from journalists for what they claimed was ?misreporting.? 

With access to the venue being denied to the media, journalists decided not to report the match. 

On Wednesday, the club authorities had manhandled a photographer claiming that DDCA vice-president Chetan Chauhan had told them not to let in any cameraperson other than those from Doordarshan. 

Chauhan clarified that the order was meant only for TV cameras and not for still photographers. 

Chauhan also apologised to the media on behalf of the DDCA. 

?I want the matter to be sorted out amicably for the 

good of the game and everyone concerned,? the former Test opener said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Chelsea up against in-form Portsmouth 

 - Tricky away ties for Arsenal, United 

 Manchester United are badly missing Ruud van Nistelrooy 

London: Premier League leaders Chelsea visit in-form Portsmouth on Tuesday while Arsenal and Manchester United also have tricky away trips in the middle of a busy holiday fixture list. 

Second-placed Arsenal travel to Newcastle on Wednesday and United play Aston Villa the previous day in what will be the second match of four in nine days for some top-flight sides. 

Portsmouth beat Crystal Palace 1-0 away on Sunday in Velimir Zajec?s first game in permanent charge and have lost only once in six league matches since Harry Redknapp left in November. 

Chelsea laboured to beat Villa 1-0 at Stamford Bridge at the weekend to stay five points clear and they will have to contend with Fratton Park?s trademark swirling cold wind on Tuesday. 

Dutch winger Arjen Robben set up Damien Duff for the only goal against Villa and the buy of the season so far will continue to worry defences with his control and direct running. 

In contrast Wayne Rooney, the campaign?s most expensive purchase before January?s transfer window, has only shown glimpses of his skills for Manchester United since his 27 million pound ($52 million) move from Everton. 

United have won seven on the bounce at home but have dropped vital points away and badly miss striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, who is out for at least six weeks. 

Tenth-placed Villa were forced to field several youngsters at Chelsea because of injuries, which could aid United. 

 Surprise package 

Third-placed Everton won by a one-goal margin again on Sunday and this season?s surprise package, stuck in a relegation fight last term, also have a tough away day at Charlton Athletic, who have won five home games this campaign. 

Arsenal appear to have recovered from the blip that followed the end of their 49-match unbeaten league run and have the luxury of an extra day off before taking on a stuttering Newcastle who remain a difficult proposition at home. 

Manager Graeme Souness is struggling to find any consistency at Newcastle and while he has pinpointed the need for defensive reinforcements, the Arsenal clash comes too early for the January sales. 

Bolton will be looking to end a run of five league defeats when they entertain local rivals Blackburn Rovers and Tottenham will fancy their chances of extending their winning streak to six leagues games at home to third-bottom Crystal Palace. 

Liverpool host Southampton and Middlesbrough, a point above them in fifth, play struggling Norwich. Manchester City entertain bottom side West Brom, who were thumped 0-5 at home by Liverpool on Sunday while Birmingham visit Fulham.

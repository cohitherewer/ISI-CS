 Jennings for Cullinan return

 Cullinan has a fabulous record against India 

Durban: Newly-appointed South African coach Ray Jennings has asked middle order batsman Daryll Cullinan to break his retirement and make himself available for the twin Test series of India. 

Cullinan, who made his debut against India in 1992-93, retired from international cricket in 2002 following a contract dispute with the United Cricket Board of South Africa (UCBSA). 

But Jennings, who took charge of the national team this week in place of Eric Simons, wants the 37-year-old to be ready for the India series, beginning November 20, and has even asked captain Graeme Smith to contact him, South African media reported on Sunday. 

Jennings wants to have this 70-Test veteran in the side for the tough series as Cullinan has a fabulous record against India. In the eight Tests he has played so far against the Indians, Cullinan accumulated 688 runs at an impressive average of 52.92, which is much better than his career average of 44.21. 

Besides bringing back Cullinan into the Test fold, Jennings also plans to introduce certain measures aimed at bringing a sense of discipline amongst the South African players. 

?The UCBSA put its faith in me to jack up the team. In order to do so, five things must be re-introduced ? passion, respect, image, discipline and fun,? a South African website quoted him as saying. 

?These five things are inseparable. If the players are not honest with you and don?t respect you, there won?t be discipline,? Jennings said. 

Talking tough, the coach also warned against ?butt kicks? for those players who do not listen to him and ?continue to think that the game owes them something?. 

?It is of utmost importance that players develop respect for each other.And they must have respect for the public and the media,? Jennings said. 

?The team belongs to the South African public. When a player walks onto the field to play for South Africa, I expect him to deliver his best. (PTI)

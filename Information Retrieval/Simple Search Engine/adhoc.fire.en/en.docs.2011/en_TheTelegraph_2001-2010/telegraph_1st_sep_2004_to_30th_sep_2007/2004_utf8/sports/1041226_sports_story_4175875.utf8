 Harbhajan hopes to clear tests

 - DOOSRA ISSUE 

 Harbhajan Singh 

Dhaka: Ace Indian off-spinner Harbhajan Singh on Saturday said he will continue to bowl the doosra despite the delivery being reported as suspect, and was confident of clearing the tests. 

The star offie said he had not changed his bowling action since being reported during the second Test in Chittagong against Bangladesh. 

?I have not stopped bowling my doosra. I have been bowling as I did before,? said the spinner. ?Anyway, I have been reported and can?t be reported again (for the next six weeks).? 

Under ICC regulations, Harbhajan would have to work with an ICC-approved bio-mechanic expert for corrective measures on his action within six weeks, and he cannot be reported again during that period. 

Harbhajan seemed to draw hope from the fact that the intense debate on the issue of suspect bowling would find a way out for him too. 

?I am not worried at all. I am confident there is nothing wrong with my action,? he said. 

?Every Test bowler is now being tested, even fast bowlers like Glenn McGrath and others. It has become routine. I have taken 300-plus wickets in international cricket. I am confident that the tests will prove there is nothing wrong with my action,? a confident Harbhajan said. 

?If it is found that I have to make some changes, I will do so. But I don?t think there will be a need,? he said. (PTI)

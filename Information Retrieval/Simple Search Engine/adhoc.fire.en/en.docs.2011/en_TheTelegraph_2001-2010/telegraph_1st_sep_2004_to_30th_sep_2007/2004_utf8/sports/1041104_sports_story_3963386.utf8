The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Shoaib: We need to be more consistent

 - ?The Indians are on a low and that ought to suit us...? 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Mumbai: Pakistani spearhead Shoaib Akhtar, who missed the just-ended Karachi Test versus Sri Lanka owing to ?severe pain? in the right shoulder, is now perfectly fit. 

Shoaib, who arrived here on Wednesday morning for endorsements-related work, told The Telegraph he?s already keyed-up for the November 13 ODI at the Eden. 

Pakistan haven?t played there since February 1999. 

?We?ve done well against India throughout this season but, generally, need to be more consistent... The Indians, of course, are currently on a low and that ought to suit us... Yes, I?m surprised at the way they?ve played versus Australia,? he remarked. 

Shoaib will be in the city for a week ? well, he simply loves being here ? and, then, head for Calcutta. His arrival there should coincide with the Pakistan team?s landing, late on November 10. 

Incidentally, Shoaib returned figures of eight for 175 in the first Test against the Lankans, in Faisalabad. He is, therefore, in form.

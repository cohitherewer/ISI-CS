The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Lucky to get Sourav: Zander

A STAFF REPORTER 

 De Bruyn after dismissing Sourav on Tuesday 

Calcutta: Zander de Bruyn admitted that he was lucky to get Sourav Ganguly?s wicket during the third day?s action of the second and final Test between India and South Africa at Eden Gardens on Tuesday. 

?Sometimes you need luck? it?s part of the game,? De Bruyn said at the team hotel after the day?s play. 

According to the South African medium pacer, the ?prize wicket?, though, was that of Sachin Tendulkar. 

?It?s as much an amazing feeling to get his wicket as bowling at the Eden with 60,000-odd people supporting the home team,? he pointed out, while speaking to The Telegraph. 

While Tendulkar was bowled after getting an inside edge, the India captain was trapped leg-before, but television replays suggested the ball had pitched outside leg stump. 

 De Bruyn felt that apart from the noise in the stadium, the fact that the pitch had developed a few cracks were ?worries? for his team. 

?The match is evenly poised. But first we need to take the remaining (four) Indian wickets in the first session and then, concentrate on piling up a reasonable total. To me, the first session holds the key,? said De Bruyn.

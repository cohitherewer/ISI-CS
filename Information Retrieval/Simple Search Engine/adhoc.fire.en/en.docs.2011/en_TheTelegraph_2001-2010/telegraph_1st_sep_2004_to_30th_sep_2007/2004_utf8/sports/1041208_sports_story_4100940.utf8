 New York: Fiji?s Vijai Singh, the first golfer to win more than $10 million in one season, was named the US PGA Tour?s Player of the Year for the first time here on Monday.

 Singh ended the five-year reign of Tiger Woods as world No. 1 in September, defeating Woods in a man-to-man duel for the Deutsche Bank championship title to confirm his supremacy.

 Singh won nine US PGA tournaments in 2004, matching Woods? 2000 total for the fifth-most in PGA history. That also included capturing another major crown at the PGA championship.

 Known for his amazing work ethic and practice and fitness regimen, the 41-year-old veteran led the US PGA with 18 top-10 finishes, a scoring average of 68.84 and with 4.40 birdies per round.

 American Todd Hamilton, the surprise British Open winner, was named the US PGA Tour Rookie of the Year.

 Athens: Greek sprinters Costas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou have been dope tested by doctors from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), an official said on Tuesday.

 The pair, charged by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) for missing drugs tests at this year?s Athens Olympics, were among a group of Greek athletes to be tested on Sunday and Monday.

 ?The doctors showed us their IDs and inquired about several athletes including Kenteris and Thanou who they then tested,? said an official at the Agios Kosmas training centre. ?They then wanted to know the whereabouts of some more athletes.?

 WADA chief Dick Pound, in Athens for an international conference, predicted the pair would be found guilty of a doping violation.

 ?My prediction is that they (IAAF) are going to find that there was a doping violation and that there will be sanctions against the athletes and, I hope, against the coach,? Pound said.

 New York: The organisers of New York?s 2012 Olympic bid have said they had snapped up nearly all the city?s advertising space for exclusive Olympic use should the Games come to the big apple. The NYC 2012 committe said nearly 600,000 billboards and other advertising signs ? 95 per cent of the city?s total ? had been taken under contract.

 The control of signs extends across all mediums, including airports, subways, commuter rail, buses, billboards, wallscapes, phone kiosks, taxi tops, and street furniture. Controlling the advertising market is crucial to any bidding city, given the International Olympic Committee?s anxiety about price-gouging by the billboard owners and ?ambush marketing? by unauthorised sponsors.

 London: Former England boss Glenn Hoddle has been appointed manager of Wolverhampton Wanderers for six months, the second division club said.

 Hoddle has been out of management since being sacked by Tottenham Hotspur in September 2003.

 Relegated last season from the Premier League, Wolves are languishing down in 17th place in the 24-team second tier of English football. 

 Bern: Swiss club FC Basel have made a complaint against Zurich police after the weekend arrest of more than 400 fans.

 Officers made the arrests on Sunday, shortly before Basel?s 3-2 win at Grasshoppers Zurich. In a statement on Monday Basel described the police action as ?indiscriminate?, claiming that many of those arrested were children, minors and parents.

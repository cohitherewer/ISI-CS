 Match abandoned after missile fells referee

Rome: A night of high drama in the Champions League ended with AS Roma?s abandoned match against Dynamo Kiev overshadowing Bayer Leverkusen?s stunning 3-0 upset of tournament favourites Real Madrid. 

The group B match between Roma and Kiev at the Olympic Stadium was called off after Swedish referee Anders Frisk was felled with blood pouring from a head wound after an object thrown from the crowd hit him at the top of his forehead. 

The unsavoury incident happened as Frisk was walking off the pitch at half-time. Moments earlier, Roma?s Philippe Mexes had been sent off after the French defender had kicked out at Kiev striker Maris Verpakovskis. 

Frisk, 41, one of the most respected and experienced Uefa referees, showed him the red card on the stroke of half-time with Kiev leading 1-0. As players and officials remonstrated, Frisk was hit by what appeared to be a cigarette lighter. 

Although the gash in his forehead did not need stitches, a Uefa spokesman at the stadium said he was in a state of shock and could not continue. The match was therefore abandoned 40 minutes after he had been struck by the missile. 

Rome?s Olympic Stadium already held unpleasant memories for the Swede. 

In March 2002 he refereed Roma?s Champions League match against Galatasaray, which degenerated into a brawl involving players and officials from both sides shortly after the final whistle. 

Uefa will meet next Tuesday to instigate disciplinary proceedings against Roma. Spokesman William Gaillard said: ?We deplore what has happened and will wait for the match delegate?s report as well as the referee?s own report of the incident. 

?This is the first time in many years that a European match has been stopped for such an incident ? sometimes there have been electrical failures with floodlights, of course, but this is something far worse.? 

AS Roma made an official apology to Frisk on Thursday. ?I want to apologise officially to the referee, to whom we gave all possible medical attention,? the club?s sporting director Franco Baldini said. 

Baldini denied that security at the Olympic Stadium had been lax. ?There were 400 police plus 400 of our own employees on hand to make sure the match took place in the most correct way possible. We will give our full assistance to catch the person responsible (for throwing the object).? 

Quite predictably, Ukrainian officials want Uefa to award Dynamo Kiev victory. Kiev were leading 1-0 at the time of abandonment. 

?I do not want to predict what will happen next... but I want to note that within the bounds of normal practice the following decision could be taken ? to disqualify Roma from playing at home and to say they lost the match,? Ukrainian football federation president Hryhoriy Surkis told the Dynamo website.

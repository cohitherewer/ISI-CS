 Rhodes declines NCA offer 

 Rhodes turned down the offer citing personal reasons 

Bangalore: Former South African cricketer Jonty Rhodes has declined an offer by the National Cricket Academy here to be its fielding consultant, citing personal reasons. 

The Durban-based Rhodes, regarded as one of the greatest exponents of fielding, had been sounded by the NCA to take up a two-week coaching assignment to pass on fielding tips to the trainees but the cricketer has conveyed his unwillingness. 

NCA sources quoted Rhodes as saying that he had just started working for a bank in South Africa and was not in a position to spend a fortnight at a stretch in India. 

NCA had pinned hopes on Rhodes? availability and expressed that his interactions on fielding would immensely benefit the trainees. 

Sources said that Rhodes had also informed NCA that he was taking a break from cricket, had no plans to coach at the academy level anywhere and instead wants to learn the ropes in the corporate world.

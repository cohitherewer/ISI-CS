The Telegraph - Calcutta

 For now, no more experiments

 - Ruling on no balls - Umpires being ?wired? to stump microphone 

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI 

Bangalore: For now, at least, the International 

Cricket Council (ICC) has no plans to experiment further with the third/TV umpire 

ruling on no balls. 

The world body, it may be recalled, tried that during 

the recent tri-series in Amstelveen and the Champions Trophy in England. 

?One expects the preliminary report, on the study, 

to be with the ICC by month-end... The next step will only be taken after that,? 

a well-placed source told The Telegraph on Saturday afternoon. 

The consensus is that while batsmen could be losing time (as the on-field umpire must wait for a communication from the TV/third umpire) in reacting, he is assured of not being given out on an ?illegal? delivery. 

The source added: ?It?s better to lose time, and possibly a few runs, than going out on a no ball in the Nineties... Indeed, this gain definitely outweighs the loss. Now, let us see what the ICC decides...? 

Incidentally, for the time being, the ICC also doesn?t favour further trials with the on-field umpires being ?wired? to the stump microphone. That, of course, was selectively done in the Champions Trophy. 

According to the source, the experiment is ?very expensive? and, moreover, ?a dedicated frequency? is an absolute necessity. Also, one understands that while the umpires picked up a sound, they weren?t always able to confirm whether it was bat hitting leather or something else. 

That isn?t great news and it won?t surprise if the 

ICC gives the enhanced introduction of technology drive a deep second thought.

London: Manchester United routed Newcastle United 3-1 in their Premier league clash on Sunday. Wayne Rooney gave Manchester United a third-minute lead. But the veteran Alan Shearer equalised in the 71st minute in a high-voltage encounter. But the home supporters? joy was short-lived as Ruud van Nistelrooy converted a 74-minute penalyt. Rooney completed the icing on the cake four minutes into injury time. 

Earlier, Bryan Robson had an unhappy start as West Bromwich Albion manager on Sunday when the Premier League strugglers went down 1-2 to Middlesbrough on the ground he once graced as a budding England great. 

Dutch winger Boudewijn Zenden headed the winner seven minutes into the second half. 

Meanwhile, struggling Spanish champions Valencia failed to win for their tenth straight match on Saturday as they were held 0-0 at home by Real Zaragoza in the Primera Liga. 

Valencia, seventh in the standings and 10 points behind leaders Barcelona, came out hungry in a bid to end their poor run but failed to threaten Zaragoza?s goal despite dominating territory. 

Their first chance came more than 30 minutes into the first half when Mohamed Sissoko?s powerful right-foot volley was blocked by Luis Garcia. Coach Claudio Ranieri brought off Marco di Vaio and replaced him with Mista in the second half but Valencia continued to splutter. When Ruben Baraja did manage to find the net in the dying minutes the goal was disallowed for offside. 

Deportivo La Coruna, by contrast, got back on track when a retaken penalty from Diego Tristan gave them a 1-0 win over high-flying Levante. 

The hosts, who face elimination from the Champions League and are languishing in the middle of the Primera Liga, made a nervous start and the Levante forwards looked far more dangerous. 

Deportivo managed to hold the visitors off, however, and won a penalty in the second half after Cesar was pulled back in the area. 

The referee ordered a retake after Pedro Munitis encroached into the area early but a calm Diego Tristan tucked the ball home to give Deportivo a winning lead. 

Espanyol moved into second place after overcoming Racing Santander 2-1 with an early goal from Dani Garcia and a late penalty from leading striker Maxi Rodriguez. 

Basement club Numancia caused a surprise after coming back from a goal down to beat high-flying Sevilla 2-1, a spectacular effort by Antonio Jose Gonzalez finding the net from 60 metres. 

Primera Liga newcomers Getafe followed up last week?s defeat of Valencia with a 1-0 victory over Malaga. Olympique Lyon returned to their characteristic winning ways on Saturday, beating Nantes 2-0 to strengthen their Ligue 1 lead, adds a report from Paris. 

The three-time French champions, beaten for the first time this season by Lille in the League Cup first round in midweek, got back on track thanks to almost identical goals by Pierre-Alain Frau and Sidney Govou early in the second half. 

Frau showed the way for his teammate 18 seconds after the break when he stole the ball from Nantes defender Alexander Viveros inside the box to score from close range. 

Govou made it two on the hour from the same spot. 

Lyon, the only unbeaten team in the French league after 14 rounds, now lead second-placed Lille by four points. 

Olympique Marseille climbed to fifth in the standings with a 2-0 win over struggling Racing Strasbourg. This was Marseille?s sixth win of the season after goals by Habib Bamogo, in the 54th minute, and Spaniard Koke, in the 69th. 

PSG ended an unbeaten run of six matches, going down 3-0 away to Bordeaux. 

Stephane Pichot beat his own goalkeeper in the sixth minute and Lilian Laslandes put Bordeaux 2-0 ahead three minutes after the break. Defender Cyril Rool sealed victory 13 minutes from time. 

AJ Auxerre remained third in the division with a 1-0 victory at home to Ajaccio. 

Martin Petrov scored twice as VfL Wolfsburg pulled three points clear at the top of the Bundesliga with a classy 3-0 win at home to title rivals VfB Stuttgart on Saturday adds a report from Frankfurt. 

Wolfsburg took the lead through Thomas Brdaric three minutes before the break and Petrov?s two outstanding goals settled the game in the second half. 

Schalke, in second place and level on points with Wolfsburg at the start of play, saw their six-match winning run come to an end in a surprise 1-3 defeat at home to Hertha Berlin. It was the first time Schalke had failed to win a league game since the arrival of Ralf Rangnick as coach in September.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 ?I?m probably going at the same pace as before, but playing safer shots?

 - Sachin Tendulkar, who completes 15 years of international cricket tomorrow, speaks exclusively to The Telegraph 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Calcutta: Thirty-three Test hundreds, 37 in ODIs... A string of enviable records... Sachin Tendulkar?s 15-year run in cricket?s premier league has been phenomenal. The icon, 31, spoke to The Telegraph for over an hour the other evening, reflecting on an India career which began in Karachi (National Stadium) on November 15, 1989. 

 The following are excerpts

 On the defining moments

 Being selected for India, 

 November 1989: It was a dream come true, though I can?t 

 express my feelings well enough... The significance can?t 

 be appreciated by anybody else either... The excitement 

 was so high, on that maiden tour, that time just flew... 

 The second Test innings (59), 

 in Faisalabad, November 1989: A big moment as my debut 

 (15 in Karachi) had sown doubts... I actually did ask myself 

 whether I was good enough for international cricket... I?d 

 been nervous and stiff on debut... My feet hadn?t moved 

 properly and I wasn?t comfortable. I found myself overwhelmed 

 by negative thoughts and, at that point, was only looking 

 for another opportunity... I was determined to put a price 

 on my wicket and, so, that fifty is going to remain special. 

 In subsequent matches, whenever I had to fall back on something, 

 I thought of that 59 and not my debut 15. (Adds smiling) 

 Never again did I have self doubts... Never again did I 

 feel that, perhaps, I wasn?t cut out for international cricket... 

 Was I nervous when I took guard in Faisalabad? Yes... Even 

 today, I get nervous... That?s how my body system reacts 

 on the eve of every game.

 The first Test hundred (119 

 not out), in Manchester, August 1990: The circumstances 

 were such that the team needed somebody to stand up... I?m 

 happy I played that role... In any case, the first hundred 

 is always a high point in one?s career.

 [Sachin was set for a hundred earlier that year, in 

 Napier, but was caught by John Wright off Danny Morrison 

 for 88.] 

 The tour of Australia in 1991-92 

 (Test series, tri-series and the World Cup): Looking 

 back, what stands out is the 114 in Perth.? Again, that 

 knock came at a critical moment... Besides, you get noticed 

 if you do well in Australia... With that one innings, I 

 made a statement. In fact, that tour boosted my confidence 

 and changed me as a player... Made me sharper, made me hungry... 

 What I learnt quickly is there will be times when a spell 

 has to be seen through... That picking singles is important... 

 My thinking changed....

 Joining hands with the late 

 Mark Mascarenhas and WorldTel, November 1995: Ravi (Shastri) 

 introduced me to Mark... Our relationship wasn?t one of 

 just an agent and client... It went beyond that and allowed 

 me to focus on cricket... The deal also gave financial security... 

 What I liked most about Mark is that he never compelled 

 me to lend my name to anything... He did offer advice, but 

 nothing more... Being a big cricket lover himself, he realised 

 my time for the sport wasn?t to be encroached upon... Mark 

 was professional ? I didn?t even read contracts, only signed 

 on the dotted line. 

 On those with the biggest 

 influence

 Elder brother Ajit: He 

 has been a part of everything that?s happened... He has 

 quietly appreciated my achievements... He hasn?t ever got 

 excited but, instead, has been reminding me of the next 

 step... And, when I haven?t done well, he has been there 

 for support. Some relationships are difficult to describe, 

 this is one such. However, I have no hesitation in saying 

 I?m here because of him.

 Parents Ramesh and Rajani, 

 other brother Nitin and sister Savita, uncle (Suresh) and 

 aunt (Mangala) who lived in Shivaji Park: Their support 

 has been central to my development and success as a cricketer... 

 (Emotionally) I remember that when I shifted to my uncle?s 

 place, to stay close to the hub, my parents came to Shivaji 

 Park every day just to see me... To spend half an hour, 

 they travelled up-and-down Mumbai for a couple of hours 

 at least... At that point, it didn?t really mean too much... 

 I suppose it?s only later in life that such moments are 

 remembered as priceless... It?s later that one appreciates 

 the sacrifices made by parents... It?s because they are 

 usually around all the time that the value of their presence 

 isn?t understood... They?re taken for granted... I?ve been 

 lucky to have such a family... It?s because my foundation 

 was strong that a structure could be built. (After a pause) 

 My parents, by the way, never forced me to do anything... 

 In fact, the only demand my father ? incidentally, my idol 

 ? made was that I shouldn?t fail in any standard! He didn?t 

 expect anything more than ?reasonable marks.? Of course, 

 he didn?t know much about cricket but, given my obsession 

 with the sport, would say I shouldn?t stop at anything but 

 excelling. (Pauses again) I?m going to be very happy if 

 I can get even close to being the kind of person he was... 

 Nothing tempted him and he was content with whatever he 

 had? Heading a middle-class family, my father had to keep 

 a lot in mind...

 Wife Anjali: The first 

 time I met her was at her residence, in 1990... Like Ajit, 

 she never gets carried away nor, for that matter, does she 

 get depressed when I don?t do well... Rather, she makes 

 an effort to see me through the days when things haven?t 

 gone the way they should have... She has ensured I?ve been 

 in a nice frame of mind for the next innings or match... 

 If I may add, she constantly reminds that there will be 

 a tomorrow and a next game.... That?s a philosophy I favour: 

 You can?t undo what has been done, but can try and influence 

 the future... Was it love at first sight? Well... I did 

 find Anjali attractive and... After a few meetings, something 

 within me said I could... Look, I?m not going to say anything 

 more...

 Coach Ramakant Achrekar: He 

 would pick me up on his scooter.... Went out of his way 

 to ensure I batted as much as possible... Accommodated me 

 in matches featuring boys who were senior... In fact, he 

 ensured I batted at No.4 for the ?team? batting second... 

 So, from school, I went to my uncle?s place for a quick 

 lunch and, then, was off to Shivaji Park... Batting regularly 

 at No.4 helped build my temperament... (Pauses) Most important, 

 Sir never tried to change my game... 

 On the non-cricketers whom he admires

 John McEnroe: I loved 

 his style... The way he carried himself...

 Pete Sampras: Was in a 

 different league... Cool headed and so consistent...

 Boris Becker: I liked 

 his aggression, his presence on court.... His never-say-die 

 attitude...

 Michael Schumacher: I?ve 

 met this champion a couple of times.... He doesn?t exactly 

 follow cricket, but I?ve still given him tips... I was curious 

 to know how he prepares for a race and his answer was he 

 keeps things simple? Remains his normal self and doesn?t 

 get worked up...

 Juan Pablo Montoya: His 

 talent apart, I find him interesting.... In some ways, he 

 reminds me of Vinod Kambli... Good natured, lively...

 On whether he admires somebody out of sport 

 Mother Teresa... A foreigner who 

 worked among destitutes... I find that remarkable... Sadly, 

 I never met her. 

 On his most satisfying achievement 

 (Smiles) That I?ve played 

 so long for India... When I started off, I never thought 

 I could play for 15 years or break X number of records... 

 At that time, just playing for the country was enough... 

 This whole journey has been special. 

 On his most special innings 

 In Tests, it will be that 114 

 in Perth and the unbeaten 241 at the SCG last season... 

 In the ODIs, my knocks in Sharjah (April 1998) and the 98 

 in Centurion (against Pakistan) in the last World Cup. 

 On whether he accepts having changed his 

 approach in the last couple of years 

 Yes, I?ve adapted... There are 

 some shots I play and some I don?t... The difference in 

 my strike-rate, though, is marginal... Surely, that indicates 

 I?m probably going at the same pace, but playing safer shots... 

 On whether wear-and-tear alone is responsible 

 for injuries in the last five years 

 Having started off early, I?ve 

 certainly had more wear-and-tear... At the same time, I?ve 

 also been unlucky ? like being hit on the toe in Zimbabwe 

 (2001)... 

 On tips for youngsters 

 Love the sport and don?t think 

 of the material benefits which may come... Indeed, cricket 

 has to take centrestage with everything else growing around 

 it... Once the priorities are right, everything is going 

 to fall in place... Bottomline is that you?ve got to be 

 true to yourself... What must youngsters not do? Attempt 

 shortcuts. Accept challenges, otherwise, you won?t ever 

 be a tough cricketer. 

 Finally, on what?s left to achieve 

 (Laughs) Don?t know... 

 After all, I didn?t set out to get A or B... Yes, one wants 

 to score as many runs as possible... Beyond that, I can?t 

 say... I don?t know whether I?ll be happy if X number of 

 hundreds or... Frankly, I don?t have a target.

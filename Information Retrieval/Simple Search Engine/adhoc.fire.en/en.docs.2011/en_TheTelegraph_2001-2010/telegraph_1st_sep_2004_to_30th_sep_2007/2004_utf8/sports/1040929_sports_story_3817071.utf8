Karachi: Pakistan cricketers are eagerly awaiting their tour of India early next year to settle scores against their sporting arch-rivals, captain Inzamam-ul Haq said on Tuesday. 

?I look forward to the tour and every player in the team anxiously waits for the tour,? Inzamam said. 

?Since we are playing better than we did against India at home, I think we will be in a better position to settle the score.? 

Pakistan on Monday announced they would tour India in February for three Tests and five one-day Internationals, reciprocating India?s tour of Pakistan earlier this year. 

India toured Pakistan for a cricket series after a gap of almost 15 years. while, Pakistan last toured India in 1999. 

India won both the one-day and Test series during the March-April tour, their first-ever victory in Pakistan. 

?It?s fantastic to play against India and cricket is followed like a religion there so it doubles the rivalry,? said Inzamam, one of four surviving members from Pakistan?s last tour. 

Experienced wicketkeeper Moin Khan, Shahid Afridi and Shoaib Akhtar were also on the 1999 tour in which Pakistan drew a two-match Test series 1-1, but beat India in the Asian Test Championship match in Calcutta. 

The tour programme is still being worked out. But Pakistan are likely to play the Tests first, probably starting on February 25, two weeks after their return from Australia.

 ?I?m enjoying my visit to India more and more?

 - It was fun to annoy the hell out of Anil and Harbhajan: Gillespie

Mumbai: Jason Gillespie had put in extra efforts through an extended practice session with the bat after the third day?s play in Chennai. That paid him and Australia rich dividends the following day in the drawn second Test against India. 

Revealing this here, the Australian paceman, who was involved in a 139-run record stand for the fifth wicket with century maker Damien Martyn, said he thoroughly enjoyed frustrating Indian spinners Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh with the bat. 

?It?s (batting effort) certainly way up there (in my career). We were sort of on the backfoot when we started Day IV. At the end of Day III, I had very good net practice. I tried to bat very straight and tried watching the ball very closely,? Gillespie said. 

Gillespie, his pace partner Glenn McGrath and middle-order batsman Darren Lehmann visited pubs, cafes and discos in and around south Mumbai as part of a three-hour promotional campaign for Foster?s last night. 

?It was tough out there. I was intent on occupying the crease. I was fortunate enough to have an extremely good player in Martyn at the other end. I think I annoyed the hell out of Anil and Harbhajan. That?s part of the fun of playing Test cricket,? he said. 

?I was lucky enough not to get out against two of the best bowlers on the planet on a turning pitch,? Gillespie said. 

Asked about bowling on the slow pitches of India, the 29-year-old Sydney-born South Australian said it was a huge challenge for every seamer to bowl on these wickets. 

?On these pitches which are batsmen-friendly the new ball doesn?t remain new for long. It gets scruffed pretty fast. But as a fast bowler you should learn to bowl with the old ball. You have to work hard and need to enjoy it and the challenge that goes with it,? he said. 

?Glenn McGrath enjoys bowling in India. His record here is very good,? he said. 

Gillespie said he had started enjoying his visits to India more and more after his maiden one in 1993-94 as part of the Australian under-19 squad. 

He later came to India as a substitute for an injured Craig McDermott during Australia?s unsuccessful 1996 World Cup campaign. 

?I am enjoying my visit to India more and more. But after a while wherever you are, even if you are in the world?s most exotic place, you want to return home. We have not reached that stage yet. We are enjoying ourselves,? he said. 

McGrath, who too visited the same pub, said the tour so far had gone very well for his team. ?It?s gone pretty well for us so far. We won the Test in Bangalore by a big margin, but didn?t play so well in Chennai. The match would have been close had rain not intervened. But we are 1-0 up and are happy,? he said. 

McGrath, who is set to play his 100th Test in Nagpur and has taken 446 wickets in his Test career, said the wicket there probably would not be ideal for fast bowlers. 

Meanwhile, Darren Lehmann praised Kumble?s bowling in Chennai, marking his Chennai efforts as outstanding. 

?On the first day it bounced a lot more. But to be fair Anil Kumble bowled very well to take seven for 48. Sometimes you get bowled out by a good bowler,? the left-handed batsman said about the Australian collapse in the first innings. 

Lehmann stood by his comments that he was willing to step down to accommodate the inclusion of the highly talented youngster Michael Clarke. 

?It?s a fair comment. He?s a young player for the future. I have always been a person to promote youth. The guy could be anything as a cricketer. Obviously I want to keep playing as long as I can but if he takes my spot that?s just part and parcel of cricket,? he said. 

?The hardest thing for India is missing a player like Sachin Tendulkar. It?s a bit of the same for us with Ricky Ponting injured. But Sachin is probably the best batsman in the world over the last 10-15 years,? he said. 

Lehmann also paid tribute to the memory of his mentor David Hookes, who was murdered in a pub brawl in Melbourne. (AFP)

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Amla?s 24 on debut pleases dad

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Hashim Amla has been in the news from the day he was picked for the tour of India. He, after all, belongs to a rare breed: a South African cricketer of Indian descent. 

And when Hashim made his Test debut at the Eden Gardens on Sunday, his father Mohamed was very much around to savour the moment. 

Though he managed only 24, Mohamed was still proud of his son?s achievement. 

?He was batting quite well but an extraordinary delivery brought about his downfall,? Mohamed Amla told The Telegraph. 

?I am delighted that my son made his debut at the Eden.? 

Mohamed is excited about his first trip to the country where his father Hassim was born. The Surat-born Hassim migrated to South Africa in 1927.

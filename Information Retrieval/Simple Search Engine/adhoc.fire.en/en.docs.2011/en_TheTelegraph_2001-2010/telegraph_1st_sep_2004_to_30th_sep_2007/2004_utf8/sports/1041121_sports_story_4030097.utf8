 Murali to seek all-clear from surgeon 

Colombo: Sri Lanka off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan will meet his surgeon in Australia next week to discuss the possibility of playing on the tour of New Zealand next month, his manager said on Saturday. 

Muralidharan has been sidelined from cricket since August after undergoing a shoulder operation. He has let known that he wants to play in New Zealand. 

?Although Muralidharan is able to turn his arm over and has been following his schedule of exercises, he has to be further examined to see whether it?ll be too early to play a Test match,? his manager said. ?It will depend on how fast he has recovered,? he added. 

The Loff-spinner is expected to leave for Melbourne on Tuesday. (AP)

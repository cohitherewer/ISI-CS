The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Rushmi is top seed

A STAFF REPORTER

 Rushmi 

Calcutta: The first-ever women?s ITF meet in the city gets underway at the BTA Complex on Monday. The $10,000 Tata Steel-sponsored event has attracted all top Indian players, barring Sania Mirza, along with four foreign competitors. 

Rushmi Chakravarthi, ranked No. 346 in the world, will be top seed, it was announced at a press conference Saturday afternoon. Frenchwoman Florence Haring (348) is No. 2, followed by a clutch of Indians. 

The three other wilds cards have gone to Indians ? local girl Shivika Burman, Vandana Murali and Geeta Manohar. The foreign participation in this 32-draw meet would have been higher had the list of late withdrawals not been so high. According to the organisers, 21 players pulled out over the last few days as they found the hotel rates too high. 

There will also be a doubles competition featuring 16 teams. The two-day singles qualifiers got underway on Saturday. The main draw will begin Monday. 

THE TOP 8 SEEDS 

1. Rushmi Chakravarthi; 2. Florence Haring (Fra); 3. Ankita Bhambri; 4. Punam Reddy; 5. Sai Jayalakshmy; 6. Sanaa Bhambri; 7. Isha Lakhani; 8. Sonal Phadke. 

Note: Players above are from India unless mentioned in parenthesis.

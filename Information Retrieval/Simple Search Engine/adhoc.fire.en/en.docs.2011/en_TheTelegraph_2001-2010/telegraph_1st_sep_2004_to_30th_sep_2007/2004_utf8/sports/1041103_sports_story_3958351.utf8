The Telegraph - Calcutta

 City doctor says it?s a ?tear?

A STAFF REPORTER

 Sourav 

Calcutta: A city based orthopaedic surgeon, who examined Sourav Ganguly at his Behala residence on Tuesday, says it is a ?muscle tear? that has kept the skipper out of action from the Nagpur and Mumbai Tests. 

?Sourav has a groin strain due to an adductor longus muscle tear. There is an inflammation and the tear is four to six millimetre deep,? said Dr Kalyan Mukherjee. 

The doctor said that rest was a key element in curing such problems. 

?He needs to rest and relax both mentally and physically. Some swimming coupled with the medicines will help him recover quickly.? 

The doctor has also advised for some blood tests which will be done on Wednesday. Sourav will be re-examined after a week. 

?Then, depending on the improvement, I can say whether he is fit to play against Pakistan (on November 13).? 

The doctor said it was the pain that was causing the trouble. ?The pain has forced him to pull out. If he did not have the pain, he would have been definitely playing by now, without caring for the inflammation.?

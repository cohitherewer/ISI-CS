The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Sourav still in doubt 

 - I have been taking injections since Wednesday, says Team India captain

 Three players were felicitated at the VCA Stadium in Nagpur on Thursday ? Anil Kumble for capturing 400 Test wickets, Glenn McGrath for 100 Test appearances and Shane Warne for becoming the world?s highest Test wicket-taker. (AFP) 

Nagpur: The uncertainty over Sourav Ganguly?s participation in the Mumbai Test hasn?t quite cleared, though, physio Andrew Leipus termed the injury as ?not very serious? Thursday evening. 

The India captain, too, isn?t sure of how things will shape up. ?Let?s see how it goes? At this point I can?t say anything. The pain still persists. I have been taking (steroid) injections, one daily, since Wednesday to help the recovery,? Sourav told The Telegraph at the end of the third day. 

Leipus informed that Wednesday?s scan report did not reveal much except for some damages to ?sub tissue? and it was only after they went back to the MRI report, done earlier, that the cause of the injury was known. 

Leipus, however, confirmed it ?appears to be a sort of muscle strain?. ?The MRI report has revealed that there is bit of an effusion, there is a bit of fluid in the hip joint. This symptom leads to the pain that stretches down from the (right) hip joint to the leg.? 

The team management had issued a statement in the morning which read thus: ?Medical investigations (bone-scan, MRI and diagnostic ultrasound) have revealed intra-articular pathology of the right hip joint noted by increased synovial fluid accumulation. He is now receiving medical treatment for this condition and his progress will be monitored carefully over the next few days?. 

But when can he start practice? ?After the injections we?d like to give some light workload in a couple of days. And he should be running around soon,? Leipus added. He further clarified: ?The medicines actually take effect once the inflammation settles down. Once that happens there will be no pain in that muscle.? 

In the process, Leipus said, it won?t be complete rest. ?It will be an active recovery in the form of light exercises. And as soon as the irritation in the joint and nerves goes away, the spasm in the muscle should disappear. 

?Probably not batting at the nets, but doing some specific exercises with me and Greg (King) in the gym will do a world of good to him.? 

Leipus refused to set any timeframe for his regaining full fitness. ?We are going to check it again on Friday and the inflammation should settle down. So, if the results are positive, then he should be fine for Mumbai,? he said. 

As a dejected Sourav walked up to the team bus, he did not wish to say much on the state of the match. He agreed ?it will be a battle of survival?, and only some ?disciplined? batting by the top-order can save the match for India.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

Sourav is the new Steve of mindgames

- The India-Australia series can be classed as a genuine world championship final

Stump Vision 

Ian Healy

Both India and Australia have been recipients of top 

level status in the past two series. Now performance must stand up. This is Australia?s 

sneak preview of the future. There are no Waughs, no Ponting. The batting line-up 

is full of lefthanders who would neutralise Harbhajan Singh. It would blunt the 

off-spinner?s leg before menace to right-handers. 

Simon Katich at No. 3, Justin Langer and Darren Lehmann 

to stabilise and Matthew Hayden and Adam Gilchrist to dominate! Then Australians 

would derive great heart from how Damien Martyn played in Sri Lanka earlier this 

year. It was outstanding and career-saving for him. 

Michael Clarke, in my opinion, was selected two years 

too late, but that wouldn?t hurt his appetite and will improve his composure. 

This team still has great class, balance and form. Even without the experience 

of 2001?s team!

Again, the footmarks created by India?s left-arm speedsters, 

such a critical ingredient for spinners looking to exploit those roughs, wouldn?t 

be as useable since Australia are stacked with lefthanders. 

Australia?s bowling is a real unknown though. Glenn 

McGrath will be closely watched. Has he still got more than just economy? Reports 

are that his pace is down and that is not good if it is typically Indian pitches. 

Michael Kaprowicz is the in-form wicket-taker in the line-up with the ability 

to swing the new and old ball and cut it. He is unproven at Test level and in 

leading the attack. Jason Gillespie is proven and critical to Australia?s chances 

but such stresses in the past have seen his body buckle. He was magnificient in 

the 2001 series without the result or luck.

Then there is Shane Warne. Warney must spin the ball 

and then Indian fans will see the real Warne stand up. He has never spun the ball 

anywhere near as much as he can, in India. Not even out of the rough. He needs 

to provide ripping leggies to stifle the scintillating strokeplay of the sun worshippers. 

They have no fear of him on home soil and that could be a mistake this time. The 

timing of series could also be an ally to him. It is the first pre-season trip 

for Australia, rather than him being the fatigued tweaker on previous tours.

India too are developing a pack mentality like Australia?s 

? enough of them do their jobs brilliantly everyday. All of them are capable of 

performing in the rotation. This makes them hard to get on top of but huge things 

are expected of the spinners. Long breaks will ensure they are fresh but they 

will need helpers. 

In the last series, Harbhajan was on his own, while 

the quicks tried everything to no avail. Is there still the great rivalry between 

Zaheer and Hayden? I hope so and now Irfan Pathan is the new leader of great ability.

The batting with or without Sachin Tendulkar can and 

will hurt at any time. Laxman loves Australia and this is mutual; Dravid loves 

performing everywhere; Sehwag is once again crunching more than just starts and 

Sourav Ganguly is the new Steve Waugh with his mindgames or at least the perception 

of these, as captain.

In 2001, they were prodded into action late by the 

partnership (Calcutta), but must start early this time. I also feel Yuvraj needs 

some protection so that his natural-ness can happen. India must rethink if they 

are serious about opening the innings with him.

Adam Gilchrist and captaincy ? there could not be 

a harder time to be lumped with it. He will handle it, but something in his game 

may have to give. We expect so much of him in both forms of the game ? this is 

his greatest challenge and will require skill of his strike players to get through. 

Looking at the tour in general, Australians now love 

touring India. Cricket facilities have improved. What makes tour enjoyable are 

hotels (second to none in India); being on the same wavelength as the people (the 

absolute joy of the Indian people was such an inspiration to me). 

Dressing rooms need to be comfortable as players spend 

so much time there and India is improving; practice facilities are crucial for 

those players out of form on long tours or reserves to make sure they are ready 

for immediate call up. India now has these criteria covered and there is heaps 

to do and learn about for us all in spare time. Plus Fosters brew there!!!

The strife in Indian cricket is a distant second to 

the anticipation of this great series!

Looking to the past, if Australia in 2001 had decided 

not to chase 374 in 75 overs on Day 5 in Calcutta, they would have won that series.

India played tough, clever and enjoyable cricket in 

Australia last summer to get on equal footing with Australia at home, which is 

rare.

To me, this can be classed as a genuine world championship 

final. If India can win, there is a gathering pack of nations circling. Blood 

in the water will excite world cricket teams.

History means nothing. It?s now time for supreme effort 

and performance. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 ?Our priority is to chase as few as possible?

 - For India?s sake, I hope Anil goes on and on: Coach John Wright 

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI 

 Consultant Sunil Gavaskar and coach John Wright 

Calcutta: About the only time in recent months that the very private John Wright allowed himself some show of public emotion was on Saturday morning, at the Chepauk, when he warmly applauded Mohammed Kaif?s maiden Test half-century. 

However, just how many are going to applaud Wright if, in a few hours, it turns out to be a super Sunday for Team India? The advantage is with Sourav Ganguly and many believe that all the dressing room-credit could go to high-profile consultant Sunil Gavaskar. 

Significantly, in a recent chat with The Telegraph, Gavaskar had this to say on the credit business: ?Does that matter? I don?t think it should be an issue as long as India does well...? 

Wright, of course, has neither spoken nor will talk on the subject. Actually, he won?t even speak on whether his position as coach has been undermined with a capital U. 

Contacted at the Taj Coromandal after stumps on Day III of the second Test, though, Wright did have a few words on what lies ahead. 

?We?ve definitely created an opportunity by taking four wickets and restricting Australia?s lead to nine... However, we need to dominate the first hour tomorrow and not make the eventual ask challenging,? he remarked, during an exclusive interaction. 

Wright added: ?Given that we?re going to bat last, our priority is clear ? chase as few as possible... What will be a safe chase? Can?t say... Whatever, we won?t have a choice as we must square the series in Chennai.? 

With good reasons, Wright feels Anil Kumble is going to remain the top tormentor: ?Look, Anil is peerless and, for India?s sake, I hope he goes on and on... The manner he got Adam Gilchrist today ? with a slow googly ? was brilliant... Anil is never short on passion and, at the same time, is always hungry.? As I?ve said, he?s an absolute role model. 

With ten wickets already in the bag (at the Chepauk), Kumble has reached 412. Perhaps, it has helped that much of the pre-series attention was focussed on Harbhajan Singh. 

With the amount of Test cricket that?s to be played before the Australians head home, it won?t surprise if the mediumpacer-turned-leggie reaches his immediate target of 435 wickets. 

Equally, if Team India extends the first three days? performance, Wright?s ?search? for that ?extra ten per cent? to quickly climb the high stakes? ladder will end as soon.

 Chisty may rule on last day 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Enjoying a massive 11 point lead over Bharath Singh, trainer Daniel David is sitting pretty with the championship honour. Jockey Imran Chisty, however, has a faint hope to topple C. Alford from the prime slot on Wednesday, the concluding day of the monsoon season.

 The two-point deficit could be well within Chisty?s reach but he may have to boot home three winners to draw level with Alford who has a readymade winner in Approved, vying for the 1,800m Royal Bengal Tiger Handicap. The Vijay Singh-trainee was an effortless winner in his previous start.

 The afternoon may also witness a close contest between Daniel?s stablemates Brighter Future and Anokato in the feature event, the 1,200m Fort William Cup. The former was an unfancied winner in her last start while cutting pace for Immaculate. With Chisty to guide the Duja-filly may strike.Read as: Sl no, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

New Delhi: More fancied athletes were relegated to secondary positions as Paul Kirui of Kenya and Sun Yingjie of China won the men?s and women?s titles, respectively, in the IAAF world half marathon championships here on Sunday. 

The 24-year-old Kirui gave the crowd a treat of a lifetime as he outran title favourite and last year?s silver medallist Joseph Fabiano of Tanzania to win the coveted title. 

The 27-year-old Sun came up with a stunning show to take the women?s gold. Hot favourite Sonia O?Sullivan of Ireland failed to live up to her top billing by finishing fourth. 

The Chinese came up with a national record to take the top honours with a timing of 1:08.40 seconds. Kenya?s Lydia Cheromei took the second spot clocking 1:09:00, her personal best, while Romanian Constantina Tomescu-Dita came third in 1:09.07. O?Sullivan finished in 1:10.33. 

Kirui clocked 1:02.15 to take the top spot ahead of Fabiano (1:02.31) and Ahmad Abdullah Hassan of Qatar (1:02.36). Hassan is the current Asian record holder in 5,000m and 10,000m. 

Among the Indians, Ram Bahadur Subba was the best performer finishing 59th with a timing of 1:10.33. Mukesh Kumar Yadav (1:11.53) came 65th, Ajit Singh 66th (1:12.05) and Raj Kumar 69th (1:12.12). 

In the team standings, Kirui?s effort, along with some fine run by John Cheruiyot Korir and Wilson Kiprotich propelled Kenya to the top spot. Kenya (3:07.55) came ahead of Ethiopia (3:08.37) and Uganda (3:13.48). Korir?s fourth place finish came in 1:02.38 while Kiprotich returned a timing of 1:03.02 to finish sixth. 

Ethiopia came second after Solomon Tsige (1:02.42) finished sixth, Alene Emere (1:02.52) seventh and Berhanu Addane ninth (1:03.03).

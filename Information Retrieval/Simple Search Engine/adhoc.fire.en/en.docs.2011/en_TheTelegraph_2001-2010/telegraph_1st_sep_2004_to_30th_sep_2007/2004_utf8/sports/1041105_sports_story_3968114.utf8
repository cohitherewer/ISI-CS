Calcutta: East Bengal?s star striker Bhaichung Bhutia and coach Subhas Bhowmick on Thursday came out in support of the two tainted footballers of the club, Sasthi Duley and Dipankar Roy. The two had been arrested by the police regarding their involvement with infamous antisocial hatkata Dilip. 

Bhutia said ?politics was making an entry into the world of football and it is unlikely that these two were antisocial elements (considering the way they were being treated). We, their teammates, are all beside them, and if necessary we will approach the chief minister of the state regarding this.? 

Coach Bhowmick said: ?They are renowned footballers and whatever the situation, whatever the case, their cause should be dealt with sympathy and understanding.? 

The club itself had earlier made it clear that they will ?not interfere with the process of law?. The club has only pleaded that ?nobody should be unnecessarily harassed? and that ?these two have never behaved in any offensive way onfield.?

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Skipper heaps praise on Kumble, Harbhajan

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Sourav Ganguly complimented Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh after India?s eight-wicket win at the Eden on Thursday. ?The way Harbhajan has bowled since his comeback in 2001 is fantastic. He and Anil have been a huge part of our success since the time they have been bowling together,? he said. 

And Kumble?s. ?has been an outstanding achievement. We?ve shared the dressing room for more than 15 years, since the under-15 days. The achievement speaks volumes of his determination.? 

Sourav said he was happy to see the openers getting a solid starts and the middle-order building on that. ?We are now getting 400-plus totals, which is required to win matches.? 

Sourav first referred the Graeme Smith dismissal as the turning point of the match, but later said, ?I think, the one over of Kumble that he bowled round the wicket just before tea yesterday. That?s when I saw the ball doing all sorts of things.? 

The captain, who declined to comment on the umpires decisions, felt Gautam Gambhir was ?justified? in his appeal against Shaun Pollock. 

On a personal level he said: ?I did not play the last two Tests vs Australia and came out of a ban threat. So it was a very important Test for me.? The fine, though, has made him wary about his aggro. ?I have to do something. I can?t afford to play Test matches for free,? he joked. 

Graeme Smith said: ?I think we have put up a decent performance in the series, considering that we came here with a young, inexperienced side, especially in the bowling. You can compare this side with the one (Allan) Border got to start with. We have to go back and fast forward our improvement.? 

Jacques Kallis felt falling short in the first innings made a difference. ?In an ideal situation we should have been ahead by 200.?

 ?No racism in Zimbabwe?

Lahore: A special report by an ICC inquiry commission has found no evidence of racism within the Zimbabwe Cricket Union (ZCU). 

ICC president Ehsan Mani told a news conference on Sunday after a meeting of the ICC executive board that a 73-page report submitted by the commission had rejected the allegations, made by a group of Zimbabwe players unhappy with the selection policy. ?The ZCU is cleared of practising racism in its cricket,? Mani said. 

An inquiry was set up by the ICC following allegations of racism by 15 white players, who argued the team was being selected by the ZCU along racial lines, rather than on ability. 

The players walked out when former captain Heath Streak was replaced in April after he had questioned the composition of the national selection panel. 

The ICC report was prepared by India?s solicitor general Goolam Vahanvati and South African high court judge, Steven Majiedt. 

?As far as the dispute between players and ZCU is concerned, the ICC for last few months has been trying to resolve it,? Mani said. 

?But in the end it is a matter between the players and ZCU and it is up to them to resolve it as soon as possible.? 

The ICC said the inquiry was not linked to Zimbabwe?s loss of Test status in June, when it was decided the team should be restricted to ODIs for rest of the year. (Reuters)

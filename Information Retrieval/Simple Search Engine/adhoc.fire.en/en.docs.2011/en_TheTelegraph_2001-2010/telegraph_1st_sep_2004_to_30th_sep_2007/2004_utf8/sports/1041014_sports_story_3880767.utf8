La Paz: Ten-man Uruguay picked up a precious World Cup qualifying point when they held Bolivia to a goalless draw at 3,600 metres above sea level on Tuesday. 

Uruguay, who began the day seventh in the 10-nation south American World Cup group, climbed one place with 11 points from 10 games. Bolivia moved off the bottom of the standings and are eighth with 10 points. 

The visitors, who made eight changes to the starting line-up from Saturday?s 2-4 defeat by Argentina, had midfielder Omar Pouso sent off in the 74th minute for kicking Joaquin Botero from behind. But other heavy tackles went unpunished by Brazilian referee Marcio Resende de Freitas in a foul-ridden game. 

Uruguay?s best chance came in the second minute when striker Vicente Sanchez crashed a shot against the crossbar. 

The match then took on the familiar La Paz routine. 

Bolivia peppered the Uruguayan goal with long-range shots in the hope that goalkeeper Sebastian Viera would be caught out by the flight of the ball while their tiring opponents attempted to cling on for a draw. 

Bolivia midfielder Erwin Sanchez had two long-range shots turned away by Viera in the first half. 

Unusually, the Bolivians themselves began to tire after half-time and Uruguay occasionally looked dangerous on the break as the pace of the game dropped. 

Mario Regueiro shot into the side-netting and, shortly afterwards, substitute Javier Chevanton broke down the right but saw his shot trickle past the post with Leo Fernandez beaten. (Reuters)

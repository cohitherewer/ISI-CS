Mumbai: Openers Virender Sehwag and Test debutant Gautam Gambhir failed to survive on a damp wicket on Wednesday as Australia took early initiative in the fourth and final Test, leaving India struggling on 22 for two. 

Sehwag, India?s in-form batsman this season, was the first to depart, bowled by Glenn McGrath on a rain-marred first-day track where the ball was skidding through. 

Gambhir fell on the next delivery, trapped lbw by Jason Gillespie with one that came in sharply as India tumbled to 11 for two. 

Both the openers survived half-chances off the first balls they faced, Sehwag (8) dropped by Nathan Hauritz and Gambhir (3) put down by Simon Katich at forward short leg. 

Local hero Sachin Tendulkar was batting on two with stand-in captain Rahul Dravid on nine when play was finally called off due to bad light with just 11 overs having been bowled all day. 

Australia have already won the Test series 2-0 following their victory in the first Test (in Bangalore) and third Test (in Nagpur) with the second Test (in Chennai) ending in a draw. It was their first series win in India since Bill Lawry?s team in 1969. 

?It was nice for us to pick up two wickets. We?re very satisfied with our effort in whatever play was possible,? Australian coach John Buchanan said. ?We would?ve liked a few more overs, but that was not to be.? 

Unseasonal rain started at early morning and continued for six hours, washing out the first session. 

Groundsmen worked on the field with mops and buckets and a Super Sopper was used on the bowlers? run-up, which was one of the main areas of concern. 

Only 22 minutes of play was possible in the second session, light drizzle forcing umpires Rudi Koertzen of South Africa and Pakistan?s Aleem Dar to call early tea. 

The wicket was covered again for more than two hours before play resumed late in the evening, with the floodlights on, only to be called off again after 27 minutes due to poor lights. 

India won the toss (the first time in the series) and elected to bat. They picked two uncapped players in a bid to bring some fresh blood in the side ? Gambhir for opener Akash Chopra and wicketkeeper Dinesh Karthik replacing Parthiv Patel. 

The hosts entered the match with three spinners and Zaheer Khan as the only genuine paceman. Tendulkar will open the bowling for the first time in his career. 

Skipper Ricky Ponting returned to the Australian team after missing the first three Tests due to injury. But the visitors are without Shane Warne, who is out with a broken thumb. Off-spinner Hauritz made his debut, becoming Australia?s 390th Test player. 

 Early start 

To make up for the time lost, play will start half-an-hour early on the next four days. The playing time will also be extended by one hour daily. (Agencies)

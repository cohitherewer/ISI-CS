 Shoaib to sign contract soon

Islamabad: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said on Wednesday that it was expecting fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar to sign the central contract and send it from Australia later this week. 

?He has conveyed to us that he has no problems now signing the contract and he will fax a copy to us signed in the next few days,? a board official was quoted as saying by the local media. 

But he also made it clear that Shoaib had not signed the contract so far. 

The speedster did not sign the central contract on Sunday before the Pakistan team departed for Australia, as he was concerned with a particular clause that made it binding upon players to seek the permission and clearance of the board before signing individual sponsorship/endorsement agreements or accepting any commercial related activities. 

The clause states no player should take up individual endorsements or commercial activities without seeking permission of the board. ?Shoaib basically had some reservations over the clause and wanted to consult his legal adviser and marketing agent.,? the official said. (PTI)

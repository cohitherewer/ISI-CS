 Arrayal fancied 

 BY STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Live telecast by RCTC, which had started with a bang a fortnight ago, seems headed for an anti-climactic finish. A look at the Wednesdays card does suggest so as there is an alarming drop in the number of events and runners. 

 If the race card has shrunken down to six from eight events, the horse-strength has also taken a substantial beating, thanks to the scrapping of two events owing to paucity of acceptors.

 Nevertheless, it may pay to follow trainer Bharath Singhs wards who not only enjoy handicap advantage but have also been doing well in their morning workouts. Arrayal, for instance, finds favour for both reasons. The Cristofori-Polly Tern son, who was given an easy outing early in the season, has come on a lot over the weeks and may claim the 1,200m Roubaix Cup in the hands of jockey S. Shanker.

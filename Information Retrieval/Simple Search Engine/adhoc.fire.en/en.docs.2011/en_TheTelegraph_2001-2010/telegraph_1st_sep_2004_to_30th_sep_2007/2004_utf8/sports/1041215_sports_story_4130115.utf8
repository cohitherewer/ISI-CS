Calcutta: For the fourth time this season, Mohun Bagan had to be satisfied with the second spot. The green-and-maroon shirts scraped past Tollygunge Agragami 2-1 in their final CFL Super Six match at the Howrah Stadium on Tuesday, finishing behind champions East Bengal. Beto scored twice for Mohun Bagan (once from a penalty and then with a brilliant back-volley), while Tarif Ahmed struck for the losers. 

Mohun Bagan had finished runners-up in the IFA Shield, Durand Cup and the Federation Cup. 

Facing a must-win situation, Bagan players looked keen to score from the word go. Brazilian recruit Roberto Mendez Silva ?Beto? always appeared the biggest threat to the Tollygunge defenders. 

In the eighth minute, Tollygunge survived a scare following a Beto flick off Jerry Zirsangha?s cross from the right. The Bagan frontline comprising Zirsangha, Sunil Chhetri and Beto looked more compact on the day. 

The goal came in the 18th minute when Zirsangha was tripped by Deb Kumar Shasmal inside the box and referee Subrata Sarkar pointed to the dreaded spot. Beto made no mistake, placing the ball to the left of the goalie. 

The Bagan domination continued after the breather. The introduction of Ashim Biswas, in place of Rishi Kapoor, added punch to the forwardline. Beto hit the post once after beating Proloy. 

Tollygunge drew level quite against the run of play in the 83rd minute. Mohammed Rafique, who received the ball on the right put it up for Tarif Ahmed. Watching Mohun Bagan goalie Bivash Ghosh coming out of his charge, Tarif lobbed the ball over his head. 

Beto came to Bagan?s rescue four minutes from time. A Abhay Kumar floater, from the right, into the top of the box found Beto. The Brazilian, facing his own goal, unleashed a brilliant back-volley into the net and ensured Mohun Bagan three important points. 

Mohun Bagan thus finished on 38 points, one less than arch-rivals East Bengal. Ever-Ready also finished with 38, but had to be content with the third spot because of goal-difference. Tollygunge finished fourth with 26 points.

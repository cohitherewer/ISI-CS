 Goa association to hold random checks

 - War against overage players 

Panaji: In an attempt to curb unfair practice in soccer, Goa government said it would help the Goa Football Association (GFA) in checking the age of players through MRI scan. 

?We have noticed that a lot of teams have overage players in under-16 and under-18 teams and this puts our boys at a disadvantage. We have now decided to check players of each team at random to ascertain their ages,? sports and youth affairs minister, Mathany Saldanha, said here on Tuesday. 

?The government would bear the cost of the MRI scan required to determine the players? age,? Saldanha said, adding any player found to be overaged would be suspended from the tournament. 

The practice would be introduced with the 27th Sub-junior under-16 nationals to be held in Goa from October 3 to 12. 

?We would like to warn any state that it should think twice before including overage players in the team,? he said, expressing hope that other states would soon follow suit in checking such ?unfair? practices. 

Goa would host the West zone qualifying round as well as the inter-zonal nationals.

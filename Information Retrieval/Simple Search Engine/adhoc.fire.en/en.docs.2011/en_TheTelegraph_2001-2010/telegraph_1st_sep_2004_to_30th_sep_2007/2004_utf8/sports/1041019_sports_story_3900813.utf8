The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Lead intact, duo heads for Singapore

 - Adam Gilchrist, John Buchanan choose to ?freshen up? miles away from the heat and dust

Calcutta: Having ended the first half of the series 1-0 in front, Australia?s (stand-in) captain Adam Gilchrist and coach John Buchanan are heading for Singapore to ?freshen up? before the last two Tests. 

Both are to fly out of Chennai early on Tuesday and return on Friday evening, 24 hours before the team assembles in Nagpur for Test No. 3 (beginning on October 26). 

The steady Damien Martyn, who authored a classic century in the second Test, and flamboyant newcomer Michael Clarke could also opt for a brief vacation in Singapore. 

?They are expected to decide by the morning,? a source told The Telegraph on Monday evening. 

The freshening up apart, Gilchrist and Buchanan will meet their families. While Buchanan has been away from mid August (tri-series in Holland), Gilchrist left home just after that tournament. 

Specifically, Gilchrist is going to meet wife Mel, young son Harry and infant daughter Annie (she was born during the Holland meet). Buchanan, one learns, will be spending time with wife Judy only. 

Cricket Australia, which regularly interacts with the players? body, apparently offered this relax-in-Singapore option before the tour began ? realising, of course, that recharging batteries is as important as performing at the VCA Stadium or at the Wankhede. 

If Martyn and Clarke decide to remain in India, they are going to unwind either in Mumbai or Goa. 

Clarke, by the way, is known to be going steady; the intensely private Martyn, it seems, is unattached. 

?Mumbai (where the fourth and final Test will be played from November 3) is the preferred destination for most players? However, some may spend a couple of days in Goa,? the source added. 

The Gilchrists are definitely lucky ? most of the ?thinking?, after all, is now going to be done by the Sourav Ganguly-John Wright-Sunil Gavaskar threesome. 

As of now, the Australians (sans Gilchrist and Buchanan) will reach Mumbai on Tuesday afternoon.

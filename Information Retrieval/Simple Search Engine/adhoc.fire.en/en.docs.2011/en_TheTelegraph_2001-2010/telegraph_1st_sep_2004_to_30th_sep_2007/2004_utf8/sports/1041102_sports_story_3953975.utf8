 CA calls for biennial series 

Sydney: Cricket Australia (CA) is trying to ensure the fight for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy with India is held every second year on the lines of its Ashes campaigns. 

The International Cricket Council?s (ICC) current 10-year-plan has Australia staying away from India until 2010 but the respective national boards are eager to expedite the game?s ?icon series?. 

CA chairman Bob Merriman said neither board had signed on the ICC?s plan because of the desire to make the next tour happen in 2008. ?We want to see Australia?s programme with India being on a four-yearly cycle, with one team visiting the other every two years,? Merriman said on Monday. 

?That?s the perfect scenario and I think everyone would like to see that. The Border-Gavaskar Trophy has become an important part of the calendar, an icon series?. (PTI)

 Fresh crisis in WI 

Georgetown: The West Indies? tour of Australia next month has been thrown into fresh crisis after players demanded $500,000 in appearance money, a West Indies cricket official said. 

The West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) rejected the demand, said Chetram Singh, a board official, and president of the Guyana Cricket Board. The West Indies Players Association (WIPA) demanded money for the 14-member team in addition to match, tour fees and incentives, said Singh. 

The demand once again ?puts the tour in jeopardy?, he added. The WIPA declined to comment on the claim, and criticised Singh for making statements while the two sides were still at the bargaining table. ?They are talking about breaching protocol, yet at the same time Singh is citing figures when we are locked in negotiations with the board,? Dinanath Ramnarine, president of the players? association, said on Monday. (AP)

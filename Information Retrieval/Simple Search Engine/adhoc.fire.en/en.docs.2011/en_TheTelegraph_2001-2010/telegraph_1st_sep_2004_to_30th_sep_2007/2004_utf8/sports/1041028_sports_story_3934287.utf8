Nagpur: John Buchanan has plotted this India campaign for long. Wiser by the experience in 2001, he never let go any chances this time around, and if his dream comes true, it will be a moment to cherish. 

The Australian coach is keeping his options open when it comes to enforcing the follow-on with India needing another 53. ?Five wickets still to get and if we get them early tomorrow, we can run up a huge lead and might ask India to follow on. Our bowlers will come out fresh tomorrow and if the new ball does really well, it could be our day. 

?Follow-on is an option. That depends on how long we take in getting those five Indian wickets tomorrow. We need to follow it up,? Buchanan said. He expressed satisfaction with Australia?s performance at the end of the second day, but felt the wicket was still good for batting. ?It?s a nice position to be in with more than 250 runs ahead. We still have to get those five remaining wickets. It?s a still a very, very good batting track,? he remarked. 

The performance of his bowlers left Buchanan satisfied. ?Glenn in his 100th Test match was outstanding. Jason Gillespie and Michael Kasprowicz supported him very well. So did Shane Warne. We probably deserved better than we finished today.? 

Despite terming the wicket as good for batsmen, Buchanan felt ?there was still enough movement with the new ball to make it difficult for the top order.? With that in mind, there is an option of enforcing the follow-on. 

The Australian coach also expressed surprised at the hue and cry about the wicket. ?When the Indians were there in Australia our wickets were flat, but we did not make any fuss out of it. You see, it is a part of the game. 

?I think we bowled exceptionally well. Most importantly, the wicket produced bounce. It is conducive to getting edges. Therefore the line of attack was different and the field was heavy on the off side,? he added. Buchanan was all praise for the batsmen. ?As the two days have shown, the Australian batting in the first innings was better than the score indicated. We?ve batted exceptionally well.? 

Buchanan gave more credit to Michael Kasprowicz for Virender Sehwag?s wicket even though McGrath finally removed him. ?Sehwag?s was an important wicket and is credited to McGrath, but I think the previous over bowled by Michael Kasprowicz set it up. He contained the batsman and Sehwag had to go for his shots in the next over that cost him his wicket.? 

The coach informed that Darren Lehmann?s condition (torn right hamstring) was being monitored. ?We?re monitoring his progress and hope the injury will recover fast.? A team spokesman said that the chances of his batting in the second innings will depend ?according to the need of the situation?. 

Former BCCI president Raj Singh Dungarpur has lashed out at rival captains for their pre-match comments on the wicket for this Test. Dungarpur said the track here was ?the best first day wicket I have come across ever?. He feared Adam Gilchrist?s comments may not go down well with the ICC. 

?I?m sorry the Australians have called it an Australian-type of wicket. The sort of comment that the Australian skipper has made would not go down well with the ICC.? Dungarpur said captains should refrain from talking about pitches whose nature none can predict accurately.

 Lee in Australia A 

 Lee is in desperate need of game time 

Sydney: Brett Lee has been included in a 13-man Australia A squad to play a series of limited-overs matches against the West Indies and Pakistan next month. 

Australia?s fastest bowler has played little cricket in the past few months after serving as 12th man in the past seven Tests and chairman of selectors Trevor Hohns said he desperately needed some game time. 

?We are mindful of the lack of opportunity Brett has had this summer, so we feel that these games should give him some useful match practice,? Hohns said in a statement on Tuesday. 

Although Lee was named in an unchanged squad for the second Test against Pakistan starting in Melbourne on Sunday, he is almost certain to miss out on a place in the starting XI because of the outstanding form of Glenn McGrath, Jason Gillespie and Michael Kasprowicz. 

With his 12th man duties preventing him from playing domestic first-class cricket, Lee?s playing duties in the next few months are likely to be restricted to one-day games. 

the SQUAD: Brad Haddin (captain), Michael Hussey, Nathan Hauritz, James Hopes, Brad Hodge, David Hussey, Brett Lee, Michael Lewis, Marcus North, Shaun Tait, Dominic Thornely, Cameron White, Damien Wright.

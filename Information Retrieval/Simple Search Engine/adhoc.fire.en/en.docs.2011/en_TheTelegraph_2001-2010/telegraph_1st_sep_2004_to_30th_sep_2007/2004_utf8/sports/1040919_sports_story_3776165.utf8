Beijing: Russian giant Marat Safin crushed Finn Jarkko Nieminen 6-2, 6-4 on Saturday to advance to the final of the China Open, where he will meet compatriot Mikhail Youzhny. 

Youzhny upset Thai sixth seed Paradorn Srichaphan 6-4, 6-4 in the earlier semi-final and both he and Safin will be bidding to win their first title in two years on Sunday. 

Fifth seed Safin has not dropped a set in Beijing and the former world number one never looked in any real danger against Nieminen. 

Safin broke for 3-2 in the first set with a blistering forehand pass and gained a double break in the seventh game as Nieminen cracked under the constant pressure. 

The Finn dropped serve again early in the second set and Safin wrapped up a comfortable victory with a crunching overhead volley after just 65 minutes. 

?It feels good to be playing so well again,? said the 2000 US Open champion. ?It?s been a long time since I played so well and for me it?s a big thing to be in a final again.? 

Safin lost to Roger Federer in the Australian Open final and was runner-up to Argentine Juan Ignacio Chela on clay in Estoril, Portugal earlier this year. 

Youzhny, hero of Russia?s Davis Cup triumph in 2002, had already beaten two seeded players, Rainer Schuettler and Dominik Hrbaty, at the inaugural $500,000 event. 

The 22-year-old, chasing his second ATP title, took the sting out of Paradorn?s power game early on, breaking in the seventh game when he forced the Thai into an improvised behind-the-back volley that landed just out. 

Paradorn?s game began to unravel after that and Youzhny closed out with an angled smash after 81 minutes. 

?If somebody had told me I would be in the final, I would have been happy with that,? said Youzhny, who celebrated with a military salute to the crowd at Beijing Tennis Centre, venue for the 2008 Olympic tournament. 

?Now I am there, I want to win it.? 

Davis Cup teammates Safin and Youzhny, both Muscovites, have played each other only once on the ATP Tour, Safin winning 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 at the 2002 Australian Open. 

?All the pressure is going to be on me,? said Safin, 24. ?I?m more experienced, a little bit older, I?ve been in more finals. Basically, he has nothing to lose.?

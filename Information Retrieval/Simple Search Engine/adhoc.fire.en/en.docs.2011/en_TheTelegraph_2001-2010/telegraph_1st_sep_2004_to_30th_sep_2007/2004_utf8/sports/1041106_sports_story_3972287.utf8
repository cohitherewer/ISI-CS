 NZ clinch series

 Khaled Mashud in action on Friday 

Dhaka: Bangladesh struggled against New Zealand?s pace attack to post just 146 in the day-night second one-dayer at the Bangabandhu National Stadium on Friday. 

Scott Styris was the most successful seamer with three wickets while Kyle Mills, James Franklin and Chris Cairns bagged two each as Bangladesh were bowled out in 43.4 overs after electing to bat. 

Styris dismissed Mohammad Ashraful (17), Manjural Islam Rana (12) and Tapash Baisya (seven) to ensure Bangladesh did not fight back after Mills and Franklin reduced the hosts to 25 for four. 

Mills, who took a career-best four for 14 in the first match, once again excelled with the new ball to strike two early blows with his out-swingers. He took opener Nafis Iqbal (zero), caught by Scott Styris at second slip on the third ball of the innings, and had Aftab Ahmed (four) caught behind by McCullum just three deliveries later. 

Left-arm seamer Franklin also picked up a couple of wickets in his opening spell as captain Habibul Bashar (zero) and opener Javed Omar (12) both played on. 

Mohammad Ashraful followed a little later as he tried to pull Styris over mid-on but gave a straight catch to Franklin after being let off by the same fielder earlier in the over. 

Khaled Mashud (41) and Rajin Saleh (28) added 57 runs for the sixth wicket to lend respectability to the total from a precarious 51 for five. Mashud struck six boundaries during his 71-ball knock before he was caught by Chris Harris at cover off Cairns. Saleh too fell to Cairns as he edged a ball to McCullum.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Lanka shot out for 208

 - Career-best figures for Razzaq (5/35)

Karachi: All-rounder Abdul Razzaq took a career best five for 35 as a depleted Pakistan attack dismissed Sri Lanka for 208 on the opening day of the second Test on Thursday. 

Razzaq, playing in his 30th match, fully compensated the absence of injured strike bowlers Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Sami to give his side a great opportunity to square the two-Test series. 

A defiant ninth-wicket stand of 44 between Romesh Kaluwitharana (54) and Rangana Herath (12) saw the tourists recuperate a little before the visitors were dismissed in the final over of the day. 

Kaluwitharana held the innings together with his 104-ball innings, which included four fours and one six, after Sri Lanka had slipped to 164 for eight after tea. He fell in the day?s penultimate over, caught behind off leg spinner Danish Kaneria. Razzaq then had Herath caught behind to wrap up the innings. (REUTERS)

 Anju back in business

Bangalore: Putting behind the disappointment of the Athens Olympics, ace Indian long jumper Anju Bobby George is all set to participate in three international events this month. 

The 27-year-old, who failed to finish in the medal bracket at the August 13-29 Games, will compete in the World Athletics final in Monaco (September 18-19), Super Grand Prix event in Japan (September 23) and Asian All Stars meet in Singapore (September 28). 

It may not be easy to put the dream-shattering experience in the Greek capital firmly behind her but Anju is trying to take it in her stride. 

And she is looking ahead at the Beijing Olympics in 2008. 

?I am yet to peak. My best jump is yet to come. Thirty-one (that she will be four years later) is not a past-prime age for jumpers,? she said here at the Sports Authority of India (SAI) campus on Tuesday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Indian eves win last tie

Chennai: Indian eves scored a morale boosting 88-run victory on Tuesday in the inconsequential seventh and final one-day cricket match against Australia, who have rounded off their visit with a 4-3 series win. 

Needing 166 for a win, the Aussies were skittled out for 77 in 36.4 overs. Medium pacers Amita Sharma (3/21) and Nooshin-al Khadeer (3/14) while spinners Varsha Raphael (2/14) and Neetu David (1/14) helped the cause.

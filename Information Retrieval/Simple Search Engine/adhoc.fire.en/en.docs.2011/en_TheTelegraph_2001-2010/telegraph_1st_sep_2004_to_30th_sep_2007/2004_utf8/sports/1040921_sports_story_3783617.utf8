The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Panic, but fire alarm was false

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

Birmingham: A fire alarm ? false as it turned 

out ? at the Champions Trophy?s official hotel here, the Crowne Plaza, caused 

panic on Sunday night. 

Besides other guests, players from four teams ? India, 

Pakistan, Australia and England ? were in the hotel when the disconcerting alarm 

went off a shade after 10.30. 

Of course, at that time, no one knew what was happening and when we assembled in the ?evacuation area?, some 25 metres away, all eyes were on the 11-storey Crowne Plaza. 

Incidentally, given that the wind was bone-chilling, some of the Australians (Glenn McGrath and Damien Martyn included) preferred sitting in the team bus. The rest joined the Bob Woolmers and the Yuvraj Singhs in the designated area. 

?Wonder what?s going on?? asked Woolmer, who had obviously been celebrating the win over India as he vacated the hotel with a glass of beer in hand! 

It was after almost half-an-hour that the all-clear was given and we headed back. Quite a few, by the way, missed the drama as they were out for dinner ? one being Australian coach John Buchanan. 

?Why is there such a crowd in the lobby?? Buchanan 

asked The Telegraph. On being told of the events which preceded his arrival, 

he quipped: ?I didn?t miss much, did I?? 

Just as well nobody actually featured in any action.

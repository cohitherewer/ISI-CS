 Wasim Jaffer puts Mumbai in control 

 Jaffer hit a majestic 157 

New Delhi: Wasim Jaffer staked his claim for a Test recall with a majestic century for Mumbai as Railways? decision to bowl first on a dead track backfired in the Ranji Trophy Elite A season opener on Sunday. 

Jaffer?s 157 came in 253 balls, spanned 360 minutes and contained 20 fours and a six. 

Railways Sanjay Bangar was left to rue his decision as Mumbai reached 261 for three. Amol Muzumdar was unbeaten on 62 when Jaffer snicked J.P. Yadav to wicketkeeper Sudhir Wankhede off the penultimate ball of the day?s final over. 

Debut for Parthiv 

In Ahmedabad, Amit Bhandari claimed three wickets as Delhi took control of the match against Gujarat by restricting the hosts to 214 runs on the opening day. 

In a rare instance in Indian cricket, young wicketkeeper Parthiv Patel debuted for Gujarat after having already played 19 Tests and 14 ODIs. ?It is an odd trend? I guess I am lucky to play for the country before the state,? Parthiv said after the day?s play.

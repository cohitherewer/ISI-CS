The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Bangla with back to the wall

 - Sourav steadies ship after middle-order slump - Laxman in dubious dismissal 

 Harbhajan Singh hits a six, en route to his 47 while Anil Kumble successfully appeals against Mashrafee Murtaza on Day II of the second Test in Chittagong on Saturday 

Chittagong: India recovered from middle order slump to post a huge first innings total before pushing Bangladesh?s back to the wall with three early wickets on the second day of the second and final Test here Saturday. 

After the heroics of century makers Rahul Dravid and Gautam Gambhir, captain Sourav Ganguly held the innings together with a responsible 88 which took India to a commanding 540. 

The hosts began on a steady note without losing a wicket in the first 25 overs but lost their way as Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh claimed three wickets in the space of 26 deliveries to leave them tottering at 54 for three at stumps. 

The hosts had struggled to match the standards of their opponents and buckled under the slightest hint of pressure. Saturday, though, they put up a much-improved performance, first checking the Indian batting juggernaut with some tidy bowling and then batting with rare resilience. 

India had to rely on the sensible batting by their skipper and some spectacular spells by Harbhajan Singh to overcome the inexplicable middle-order slump before being all out at the stroke of tea. 

Bangladesh, needing 340 to avoid a follow-on, reached 54 for three, the loss of Nafis Iqbal (31) and nightwatchman Mashrafe Murtaza (4) somewhat spoiling an otherwise good day for the hosts. 

Captain Habibul Bashar, yet to open his account, was at the crease at stumps. 

Javed Omar blocked 78 balls and hit one four for his 10 before he went for a drive and edged Kumble to Dravid at slips towards the close of play. 

Bashar had said on the eve of the match that he wanted his team to at least put up a fight, and his batsmen to see off the new ball. Iqbal and Omar did exactly that even as Irfan Pathan and Zaheer Khan surprisingly failed to find their rhythm and often strayed in line. 

He pitch played true. And although there was good bounce and turn, it was hard toil for the bowlers in general and the Bangladesh openers showed maturity in their shot selection to almost survive the evening session. 

Despite what the scoreline might indicate, it was overall an under-achieving batting by the Indians as they lost five wickets for 78 runs in the morning session and failed to consolidate on the good work done by Dravid and Gambhir. 

Mediumpacer Murtaza (three for 60) triggered the collapse when he rapped Sachin Tendulkar (36) on the pads off the very first ball of the day. 

It was a somewhat dramatic departure. The Little Master?s concentration was affected by movements behind the bowler?s head as he got ready to take strike. Sachin (36) needed a few minutes to take his stance as he was disturbed by people moving in the press box. And when he finally settled down, Murtaza had him plumb in front with one that cut in sharply. 

Dravid (160) himself was guilty of a loose shot when he played away from the body for an edge to wicketkeeper before V. V. S. Laxman was dismissed in controversial fashion. Left-arm spinner Mohammad Rafique (four for 156) grassed the ball after taking a diving return catch off Laxman. 

However, Laxman had walked immediately, hence there was no chance of a review, if any. 

Dinesh Karthik did not last long either, although he looked displeased at being adjudged caught behind to Rafique. 

Sourav?s sensible innings, combined with Harbhajan?s cavalier, 47 then resurrected India. The Indian captain displayed calm while wickets fell rapidly at the other end before being caught at long on as he went for big shots towards the tea break. He faced 153 balls and hit nine fours during his 231-minute stay at the crease. 

Harbhajan?s 43-ball 47 studded with seven fours and two sixes fetched 75 runs for the ninth wicket partnership with Sourav. 

The captain also received valuable support from Kumble (23) as the two added 53 runs for eighth wicket that lifted India from 412 for seven at one stage. Bangladesh then did well to reign in the free stroking Indians by claiming five wickets for 78 runs before Sourav and Kumble did the repair job. 

The vice-captain added 37 runs for the fourth wicket with Sourav before he played away from the body for a snick. His 160 came from 304 balls and contained 24 fours. 

Murtaza?s tidy opening spell of two for 18 checked the Indian scoring rate at one end but runs kept flowing at the other. Rafique then dealt three quick blows to push the visitors on the backfoot.

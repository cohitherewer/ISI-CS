The Telegraph - Calcutta

Woolmer help a boost for Malik, Rana

- New coach infuses confidence in youngsters 

Pakistan players during pratice at the EdenGardens on Thursday

Calcutta: Pakistan has imbibed a new confidence 

under Bob Woolmer and this has been reflected in their performance. Come Saturday, 

Shoaib Malik and Rana Naveed-ul Hasan stand to testify to the benefits the youngsters 

have been reaping under the Englishman.

Be it through technical assistance or enhancing practice 

hours, Woolmer?s availability has worked wonders with the duo. It is his presence 

that has prompted Pakistan to think that they can achieve goals with limited talent 

in hand.

?Woolmer has been of great help. His technical knowhow 

is excellent. It is after his advice that I have stopped shuffling and the results 

are here to stay,? said Malik whose century in the Asia Cup virtually took the 

match out of India?s grasp. It was also at Woolmer?s advice that Malik was promoted 

to the No.3 slot.

Rana was also all praise for the coach. ?He?s been 

good for the team. The support of the players has also gone a long way in making 

this side into a winning unit.?

Pakistan have won three matches against India ? Asia 

Cup, the tri-series in Amstelveen and the ICC Champions Trophy ? and are aiming 

for their fourth at the Eden on Saturday.

?A lot will depend on luck in a one-day contest. Only 

one team wins,? Malik said after more than two hours of practice.

Rana was more pragmatic. ?There?s no pressure as such. 

You?ve to perform to win. Whoever plays to win on the given day will win. We performed 

better in the last three contests and won.?

Malik has been more in the news after being reported 

for a suspect action during the tri-series at home. He did not wish to dwell on 

the matter but admitted it ?does affect you to an extent?. The off-spinner will 

consult a biomechanic expert during their tour Down Under.

The allrounder admitted he was not looking too far 

ahead. ?I don?t have any future plan as such. I take one match at a time,? Malik 

said. 

Pakistan are likely to go in with three pacers ? Shoaib 

Akhtar, Mohammed Sami and Rana. With Imran Farhat and Taufiq Umer opening the 

innings, Malik, Yusuf Youhana, Inzamam-ul Haq, Abdul Razzaq and Shahid Afridi 

will follow.

Malik wasn?t worried about the dew factor. ?We?re 

professionals and have to perform,? he said. 

That has been their mantra under Woolmer.

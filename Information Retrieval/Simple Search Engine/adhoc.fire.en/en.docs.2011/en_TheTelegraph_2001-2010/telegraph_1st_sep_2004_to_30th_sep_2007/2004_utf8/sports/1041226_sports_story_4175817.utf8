 Star Angel canters home 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Star Angel kept her date with the Ladies? Derby, the 2,400m Usha Stud Calcutta Oaks, on Christmas day. The quarter-money hot-favourite, who had cantered home with the 1,000 Guineas last month, gave a tension-free ride to her jockey C. Rajendra. It was the 414 th Classic win for her owner MAM Ramaswamy who was present at the RCTC ground to lead her in and three more winners.

 Trainer Daniel David, who saddled the Angel to victory, also claimed the prestigious Breeders? Cup for his owner when Pure Valour gave weight and beating to the fancied duo of Imperial Dynasty, also from MAM?s yard, and Acrostic. K. Kariappa rode a well-judged race on the Conquering Hero-Moon Spell two-year-old.

 The trainer-jockey-owner combination also pulled off a smart gamble in the concluding event, the 1,200m Goldfinder Handicap, thro-ugh their less fancied horse Noble Investment while stable?s Ballet Master attracted scores of money in betting along with Deepak Kar-ki?s Pearl Dragon. Incidentally, the winner opened as a 6-4 favourite but found few takers even at 5-1.

 The victory of Midas Touch, albeit a narrow one, over Bollywood Dreams and Vijay Singh?s hot-favourite Bountiful Pleasure, was a smart one in the Darbhanga Cup. Rajendra, partnering the 8-1 outsider, waited to seize chance, in fifth, and drove his charge hard when he noticed the 4-10 favourite struggling to get going after establishing a winning lead from the 600m marker. Rajendra, however, belted the winner excessively.

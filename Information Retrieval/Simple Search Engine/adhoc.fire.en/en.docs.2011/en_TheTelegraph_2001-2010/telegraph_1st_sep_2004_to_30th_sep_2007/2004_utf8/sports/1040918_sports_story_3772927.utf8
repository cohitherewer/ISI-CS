The Telegraph - Calcutta

 India formidable even without Sachin: Bari

 - ?Everything depends on how the teams play that day? 

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI 

Birmingham: Team India are without Sachin Tendulkar, but Pakistan?s chief selector Wasim Bari doesn?t believe that gives his side the edge in Sunday?s Champions Trophy ?quarter final?. 

?After all, it?s a one-day game and everything depends on how the teams play that day... Never have I picked one side over the other in limited overs cricket,? Bari told The Telegraph in a brief interaction over breakfast at the Crowne Plaza on Friday. 

He added: ?Even without Sachin, India remains formidable... At least I think so...? 

Asked what could make the difference, Bari replied: ?A better appreciation of the situation and a better response to the pressure that is bound to be there.? 

Incidentally, Bari clarified that the International Cricket Council (ICC) didn?t exactly caution him for his David Shepherd-directed outburst after last month?s tri-series final in Amstelveen. 

A former captain (and outstanding ?keeper), Bari said: ?The ICC didn?t say I violated any Code... On the contrary, I sought an explanation as to how their ?confidential? letter to me leaked... 

?I?ve never run down institutions and my remarks (over Shepherd?s umpiring) weren?t intended to slight the ICC... Surely, I?m aware of my responsibilities.? 

The Shepherd-chapter, then, is closed.

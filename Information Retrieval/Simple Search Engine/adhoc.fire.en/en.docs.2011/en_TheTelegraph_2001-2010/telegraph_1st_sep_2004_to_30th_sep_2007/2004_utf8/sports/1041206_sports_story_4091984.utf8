The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Basic Fifa guidelines have been flouted 

 - THE MEDICAL FRATERNITY?s opinion ABOUT THE on-field accident in bangalore 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The medical men, all who have been in some way some time involved with the sport of football, have put their feet down, some time or other, protesting the poor condition of medical facilities at match venues (or even practice venues). 

The death of Sanjib Dutta brought this lacuna to the glaring spotlight. Many a discussion was held, may suggestions put forward, but the All India Football Federation, headed by a full-time politician (Priya Ranjan Das Munshi) who has little time for the sporting world, remains inert. That is evident in the way the AIFF flouts even Fifa rules and guidelines on this. 

The Telegraph caught up with some of the top medical minds who have been, at some time or other, in the thick of things. We present a cross section of expert medical opinion: 

l Dr Kalyan Mukherjee (now in Mumbai): When Sanjib Dutta, the Railways player died in 1993 after colliding on the pitch, a two-member inquiry commission was set up to investigate the matter and suggest steps. I, with Dr Darshan Tandon were entrusted with the job. 

We had presented a three-part suggestion: Firstly, we said, referees should be well versed with first-aid. They must attend such a course, because Fifa guidelines do have this. Doctors should be present at every ground, with necessary equipment. 

Secondly, no important match should be held in any place farther than 1km from a hospital so an injured player can be quickly rushed. 

And lastly, that while a match is on progress, nearby hospitals should be alerted about it and a two-way communication should be kept open. 

That no suggestion of mine was carried out is for everybody to see. The report we prepared was not even published. 

l Dr Shanti Ranjan Dasgupta (East Bengal vice-president and team doctor): ? He was the one who brought Debjit Ghosh back life, so to say, with timely intervention with Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation, or CPR): The CPR needs to be administered within three minutes. Pressure needs to be given at the ?sternum? and mouth-to-mouth resuscitation needs to be given. But I feel it was not implemented properly Sunday. 

Basic training on this should be imparted to players, coaches and match officials to deal with such a crisis, but nothing has been done till date. We enjoy their game but at the risk of the players? lives. 

l Dr Nisith Ranjan Chowdhury (a doctor associated with the AIFF): Football is a body-contact game. A trained sports medical expert should accompany a team, not only for national and international matches, but also for local matches. Cardio-resuscitation units with oxygen should be ready at hand. Fifa?s statutory rule for a stadium is that a medical unit is a must along with a doping unit. But, unfortunately awareness in our country is zero. Hope the authorities wake up.

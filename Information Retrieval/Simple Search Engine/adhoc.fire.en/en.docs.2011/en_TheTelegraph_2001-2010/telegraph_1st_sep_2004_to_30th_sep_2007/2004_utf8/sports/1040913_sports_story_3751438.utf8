The Telegraph - Calcutta

 ?Hagi not the greatest Romanian footballer?

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Al Jaish coach Stefaneseu Castica (centre) feels players like Dobrin had a bigger influence in Romania 

Calcutta: Gheorghe Hagi is a legend in Romanian and world football. But to Al Jaish?s Romanian coach, Stefaneseu Castica ? who was the assistant coach of the Romanian national team and has worked closely with Hagi and Gheorghe Popescu from 1994 to 1998 ? the former World Cupper is not the greatest. 

?There were players like Nicolae Dobrin, who had a greater influence on Romanian football,? Castica felt. 

But he was quick to add that Hagi is a name in himself. ?We all knew about Hagi since he made a name for himself playing abroad. 

But Dobrin (an attacking midfielder who played from 1966-1983) stayed home, and that?s why only a few know him outside the country.? 

The coach fondly remembers his association with the national team. ?Hagi was an outstanding player. Many a time I have seen him win matches single-handedly. His ability to score goals was fascinating.? 

Castica?s stint with the national team started after the 1994 US World Cup where Romania went down to Sweden in the quarter finals, losing on penalties. 

Castica, however, feels Haji is needed to lift the state of Romanian soccer. Hagi is currently the coach of Turkish squad Galatasaray and Castica feels that in a few years he ought to be back to take charge of the national team. ?We would like to see him take charge of the national squad,? Castica said. 

He further feels that post-Hagi, Romanian football has been on the downslide. The Al Jaish coach sounded satisfied with the way the juniors are shaping up well, and here Hagi can be a great motivator. 

Besides being associated with the national squad, the Romanian had also had a stint with Steaua Bucharest, one of Romania?s top clubs. He has also coached Al Shoba, a Saudi Arabian club before shifting loyalties to Al Jaish, who he hopes to take to greater heights. 

Defeating East Bengal and qualifying for the AFC Cup semi-finals will be one small step towards that direction.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 The momentum is with us: Jennings

 - It?s always disappointing not to score a hundred, says Dravid 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Ray Jennings believes the momentum is with South Africa, while Rahul Dravid feels the match is evenly poised. 

?There?s no doubt that the momentum has been taken away from the Indians,? the South African coach said after the third day. 

But the Indian vice-captain had a different opinion. ?I think the momentum is even. If we can take around a 100-run lead, we can put them under pressure. Two days is a long time and a lot can still happen. If we have a good start tomorrow and put on 80-90 more, it will be interesting. We?ll have to see how we can set the pace of the game.? 

Having been dismissed for 80, Dravid appeared visibly disappointed. ?It?s always disappointing not to be able to score a hundred,? he conceded. 

Dravid was also quick to point out the shortcomings. ?We would have liked 30/40 more runs during the day. It was tough? We could have done better in certain ways. But (Dinesh) Karthik and (Irfan) Pathan batted really well. 

?We lost wickets at regular intervals and that affected the run rate. It was also difficult to score with the old ball,? he explained. 

He did not offer any excuses after being dismissed of an inside edge onto the stumps. ?I was around for long. It can happen in wickets like this where the ball tends to keep low. When trying to work the ball, edges can happen?? 

Sachin Tendulkar?s form is also not a worry. ?This lull can happen to anyone. He has had some tough games. We all go through phases like this. Remember he has performed for long periods. He has been out of action for a while because of injuries. He has not played much cricket this season,? Dravid tried to reason. 

He felt the South Africans bowled well ?within their limitations?. ?Hall was bowling wicket to wicket. They were also getting the reverse swing.? 

Jennings felt it would be a good contest. ?The wicket is spinning and it will be interesting?. 

The Proteas? coach was happy with their performance. ?The bowlers did a very good job. The Indian run-rate was hovering around three. The boys have shown tremendous application. We will enjoy the advantage of not having to bat in the fourth innings. A lead of around 250 will be good and I wish to see how well India chase. 

?It didn?t seem as if the Indians were at their attacking best. It felt as if the whole side had fallen asleep. We?ve heard all about our negative tactics. I wish to see how India react under pressure. All we need is a bit of luck.? 

He warned of more ?short balls? in the second innings.

 Fans make all the difference

London: For Manchester United, one word was reason enough to reject Malcolm Glazer?s bid to take over the club: debt. 

The 15-times English champions said their justification for spurning the American sports tycoon last week was that they did not want the club to be forced to take on a high level of debt. 

Try telling that to Andy Burnham. To him, the thousands of fans who waved signs protesting about Glazer and saying the club was not for sale were the driving force behind the rejection of Glazer?s advances. 

?The tide is turning against corporate football,? said Burnham, chairman of Supporters Direct, a British government initiative involving fans? groups nationwide. 

?Clubs were built as non-profit-making organisations. They are there to enhance sport, not as money-making vehicles.? 

Glazer, owner of American football team Tampa Bay Buccaneers, was reportedly planning to put United heavily into debt to finance his takeover. 

Boosted by Manchester United?s attitude and by successes with other, smaller clubs, Supporters Direct wants to increase the fans? control of clubs through share-save schemes. 

Supporters? trusts already own or control nine of the lower league clubs, and have 38 of their members on the boards of others. Over the course of four years, they have raised ?10 million ($18.35 million) to finance their activities. 

Burnham, however, wants more. Come 2055, he said, fans would prevail. 

?Fifty years from now, the vast majority of clubs will be supporter-owned or controlled,? he said. ?It is coming back our way.?

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Zaheer, Chopra?s big test

 Another opportunity for Paul 

Chandigarh: As ever, the Irani Trophy, the country?s premier cricket event pitting the Ranji Trophy champions ? Mumbai this year ? against the Rest of India, starts here Wednesday. 

It is a cruel irony that the flagship event of Indian cricket showcasing the best talent in the country will not be on television. So much for the hoopla about this being the BCCI?s platinum jubilee year. 

The situation is a complete contrast to what it was last year when the Board for the first time roped in sponsors for the Cup and the field included batting ace Sachin Tendulkar. This time, however, there will be no Tendulkar, and with no live coverage, no sponsorship too. 

Dinesh Mongia, who will lead the Rest of India, returns to the scene of historic Duleep Trophy triumph, where he led North Zone to victory against East in March earlier this year. Mongia, comes in to the match with loads of confidence following a successful outing in the English county. 

Motivation should be high for Zaheer Khan, too, although for entirely different reasons. The Baroda pacer who has been dogged by injuries, will return to the fold to prove his fitness ahead of the Australia series. 

Akash Chopra and Parthiv Patel find themselves in similar boats. After being part of the team that beat Australia and Pakistan in their own soil, the two find themselves in a precarious situation. They will have to remind the selectors of their usefulness. 

There have been talk of replacing Chopra in the opening slot and it will be the right opportunity for the Delhi batsman to prove his mettle.Gautam Gambhir, Sridharan Sriram, Sairaj Bahutule, Shib Shankar Paulhave another opportunity to impress the selectors.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 United draw with Boro

 - PREMIER LEAGUE 

London: Wayne Rooney?s Premier League debut for Manchester United turned sour as they were held to a 1-1 draw by Middlesbrough at Old Trafford on Sunday. 

In a later kick-off, Jose Mourinho?s Chelsea maintained the pressure on leaders Arsenal with a goal from midfielder Joe Cole, sealing a 1-0 victory over Liverpool at Stamford Bridge. Rooney was a peripheral figure for much of the match. 

The 18-year-old England striker had a couple of half chances early on but rarely threatened a repeat performance and was shown a yellow card for a rash tackle on George Boateng. 

Boro?s youthful side survived early pressure and took a deserved lead in the 32nd minute when midfielder Stewart Downing converted a cross from the impressive James Morrison. 

United enjoyed plenty of possession after the break but relied heavily on winger Cristiano Ronaldo for their attacking spark as Rooney and Ruud van Nistelrooy struggled to repeat the link-up play that saw off Fenerbahce. 

Van Nistelrooy headed one effort against the woodwork while Boro?s Gaizka Mendieta wasted a great chance to make it 2-0 when he lashed a shot over the crossbar. 

Ten minutes from time United finally broke through when striker Alan Smith, who had just come on as a substitute for John O?Shea, headed Ronaldo?s inviting cross beyond Mark Schwarzer for his fifth goal of the season. 

Still unbeaten under Mourinho, Chelsea were rarely threatened by a conservative Liverpool, although it took them a while to capitalise on their dominance. 

The breakthrough came after 64 minutes when Cole, a first-half substitute for injured striker Didier Drogba, nonchalantly flicked a Frank Lampard free-kick past Chris Kirkland. 

Newcastle United lost ground on the leaders when they could only manage a 2-2 draw at Birmingham City.

 Magdeburg (Germany): Thomas Springstein, the coach of several German world and Olympic track and field champions, is under investigation for providing a banned steroid to at least one young athlete, German track officials said on Thursday.

 Police searched the house of Springstein, who has trained former 800m Olympic champion Nils Schumann and 100m world champion Katrin Krabbe, and found medical substances containing the anabolic steroid udecanoate. A press release from SC Magdeburg said the 46-year-old is believed to have given the drug to some members of a group of athletes he was training for the club. Springstein could face up to 10 years in jail if convicted. 

 London: Peterborough United were hunting a new coach on Thursday after former Wales manager Bobby Gould dramatically quit the post at halftime during a match against Bristol City.

 The much-travelled Gould stunned Peterborough manager Barry Fry by walking out as the third division team prepared for the second half of their 1-0 LDV Vans Trophy defeat by Bristol City on Wednesday. 

 ?Bob packed up at halftime,? Fry told Peterborough?s website.?I should imagine I have had the worst month personally in my life ? and that took the biscuit. At halftime we said a few things and Bob never contributed anything and as I was going out for the second half Bob said, ?That is me, I am packing up, I can?t be associated with that side.?

 Brussels: Belgian Kim Clijsters made a successful return from a long injury absence on Wednesday, overcoming dogged Czech Iveta Benesova 7-6, 6-2 in the second round of the Belgian Open. She said: ?I started very nervously but felt that the crowd was right behind me and that helped a lot. Plus my former injury did not bother me any more.?

 Clijsters had missed the French Open, Wimbledon and the US Open this year with torn wrist tendons complicated by a cyst. The Belgian raced into a 4-1 first-set lead before Benesova took advantage of some sloppy serving to peg her back to force a tie-break which the former world No. 1 took 7-3. Clijsters began the second set well, advancing to 3-0 before wrapping up the match.

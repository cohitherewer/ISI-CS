 Puneet, Mandar shine

New Delhi: Puneet Rana of Punjab and Mandar Divse of Police both set their second national records in swimming events while Viraj Patil won his third gold in 1m springboard diving on the penultimate day of the 58th senior national aquatic meet on Saturday. 

Puneet Rana clocked 1:05.05 seconds in the men?s 100m breaststroke event, bettering policeman Deepak Kumar?s record set at Thrissur to win the gold. Mandar erased his own last year?s record for the 800m freestyle gold. The Maharashtrian timed 8:42.79, bettering his mark by more than three seconds. 

Viraj, who became the first ever to claim all the three top honours ? 1m springboard, 3m springboard and high board ? in a single event, scored 327.05 points setting a new meet record. 

Among women, Olympian Shikha Tandon of Karnataka won her fifth consecutive gold in the 50m backstroke, clocking 31.38s which fell short of the meet record she herself set last year. Karnataka also clinched gold medals in the 4x100 freestyle relay and in 200m breaststroke, with Mrudula D clocking 2:51.36. (PTI)

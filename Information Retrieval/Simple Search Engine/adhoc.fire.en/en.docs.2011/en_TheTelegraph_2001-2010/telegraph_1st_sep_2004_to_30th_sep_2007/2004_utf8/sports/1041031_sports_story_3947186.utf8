Calcutta: It was perhaps not a surprise for the Bengal medium pacer Shib Shankar Paul. ?I was bowling well and I knew one day the opportunity will come,? Paul said of his inclusion in the XIV for the third Test versus Australia to be played in Mumbai from Wednesday. 

[The Telegraph had reported on Saturday that Paul and Avishkar Salvi would come into contention if Irfan Pathan wasn?t yet fit for a comeback.] 

It is a great responsibility, especially after India?s horrible defeat in Nagpur on Friday. However, Paul is not worried. ?I am not feeling any pressure, as I am prepared to get on with the game,? he said at the CAB this evening. Maybe a bit of his confidence stems from a very special SMS he received late this afternoon. It was from Team India skipper Sourav Ganguly, congratulating him on his selection. 

One of Paul?s dreams, is to be able to pick up the wicket of Matthew Hayden, if manages to get a playing XI berth. ?It was my dream to get the wicket of Hayden, and so if I get the chance I will definitely try my heart out for it,? he said. 

Called ?Maco? by his Bengal teammates, Paul will be on his toes to perform. ?I will be flying off to Mumbai Sunday evening and no training before leaving,? he said, looking pretty unruffled with the news. 

The other dream Paul has will definitely be realised. It is to share the dressing room with the likes of Sourav, Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid. ?I have always been encouraged by these great cricketers and sitting in the dressing room alongside them will really be a great moment for me,? he remarked. 

Paul inclusion has been acknowledged by many, but 

the most important one came from that Sourav SMS, Paul confirmed.

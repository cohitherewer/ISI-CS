The Telegraph - Calcutta

 I also died: Douglas

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Friends and colleagues are shocked, to say the least. Some, like Douglas da Silva, who was responsible for bringing Cristiano Junior from Brazil to the Calcutta Maidan, have more questions than answers in their minds. All talked about his great sporting skills. But all also talked about how great a human being he was. The following are some reactions: 

 Subrata Bhattacharya 

 (The Mohun Bagan caoch sounded extremely shaken up, 

 barely able to say, with his team defeated and Junior dead, 

 a double blow): ?Yes I have heard the news. It makes me 

 said, very sad. 

(Mohun Bagan assistant general secretary Balaram Chowdhury and manager Om Jhunjunwala visited the hospital after the match). 

 Subhas Bhowmick (Junior 

 had many a great match with the East Bengal coach, now in 

 tears): A positive striker and a wonderful human being. 

 Please, I will not be able to say anything more, I am not 

 in a proper state of mind 

 Bhaichung Bhutia (He played alongside 

 Junior at East Bengal last season): The news came as a shock. 

 It is a great loss. He was a good friend and we had some 

 great time on the field. He was a wonderful person too. 

 He was one of the finest foreign players I have played alongside. 

 But often there are lapses in preparation, a not so right 

 attitude from the authorities. Often referees are not alert 

 during games. Moreover, the medical attention provided are 

 rather poor. It?s time the authorities woke up. 

 Douglas da Silva

 Douglas da Silva (He sounded too shaken): 

 I am not really in any condition to comment, but I also 

 died today. My heart is broken. It?s very shocking. He was 

 a very good friend of mine. I know everybody has to pass 

 away one day, but in this way? I had a talk with Junior?s 

 wife and condoled her as far as I could. I am leaving for 

 Bangalore Monday. 

 Debjit Ghosh: I remember the collision 

 I was involved in, during the ASEAN Cup match in Jakarta. 

 I was attempting a header and fell unconscious on the field 

 after the collision. I woke up two hours later at the hospital 

 and felt severe pain all over my body. It was only later, 

 while going for the scan, that I vaguely remembered the 

 collision. I am indebted to Dr Shanti Ranjan Dasgupta (the 

 East Bengal team doctor) and Douglas da Silva for providing 

 the necessary onfield treatment. 

I can surely identify with Junior?s tragedy. He was a wonderful human being, besides being a good player. However, it is time the authorities should wake up. 

They didn?t do so when Sanjib Dutta died. Nothing was done after I suffered the injury and now there?s Junior. Hope his death brings some sense to he administrators of the game. Then the next player may be saved.

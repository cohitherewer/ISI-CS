 Court upholds sanctions

 Serginho collapsed on the field and died of heart failure 

Sao Paulo: A higher sports court rejected an appeal by Sao Caetano and sustained sanctions against the club and its officials for the death of defender Serginho. 

The superior court of sports voted 4-2 on Tuesday to maintain its ruling that stripped the club of 24 points for games that included Serginho in the line-up. 

Serginho collapsed on the field and died of heart failure on October 27, when Sao Caetano faced Sao Paulo in a Brazil first-division championship game. 

After the points were deducted, Sao Caetano dropped from fifth place to 18th in the national league, which ended on Sunday. The club forfeited a berth in the 2005 Copa Sul-Americana tournament, which it would have played with a fifth-place finish. 

The court also reaffirmed a two-year suspension for Sao Caetano president Nairo Ferreira, on grounds he illegally authorised the team to use Serginho. 

Team doctor Paulo Forte was banned for four years, accused of covering up documents from Sao Paulo?s Incor heart institute that proved Serginho had a bad heart. 

The club also was fined 50,000 reals ($18,500). 

Police have said they will charge Ferreira and Forte with homicide, on grounds they knew Serginho had heart trouble but let him play anyway. If convicted, they could be sentenced to up to 20 years in prison. 

Court president Luiz Zveiter, who cast the deciding vote to sustain the sanctions, said the suspension of Ferreira and Forte would be a lesson to other clubs. 

?They were punished for the death of an athlete,? he said in an interview on Pele?s website pele.net. 

?This is so that other teams take better care of their athletes. I hope this serves as a warning.?

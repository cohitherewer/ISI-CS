 Inzy, Shoaib cleared to play

 Inzamam had a problem in his lower back 

Melbourne: Inzamam-ul Haq and Shoaib Akhtar have been cleared to play against Australia in the second Test in Melbourne. 

Coach Bob Woolmer said captain Inzamam had received a diagnosis on his long-term back injury, while paceman Shoaib had been cleared of any significant shoulder damage. 

Inzamam has a problem with the sacroiliac joint in his lower back, but Woolmer said the team?s most experienced batsman would play against Australia in the Test starting at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Boxing Day. 

?It?s more related to posture ? if you notice how he bats, he bats very hunched over,? Woolmer said on Wednesday. 

?It?s probably something he?s gradually picked up over the years ? the management is pool work, gym work, specialised exercises. 

?It?s one of those horrible things that can flare up at any time and we have to try and manage it now ? he has to try and manage it now. 

?All it does is makes him stiff and sore,? he said. 

?We?ve got to manage it better than we have done ? we weren?t sure what it was for a long time, we?re very happy we?ve found out,? he said. 

?To be fair, he?s done a few (exercises), but he?s been worried about his back, so it?s been a sort of ?catch-22? situation. ?Now we know it?s going to be helped by certain types of exercises, I think he?ll get stuck into it.? 

Shoaib came out of the 491-run Perth Test debacle with a painful ankle, thanks to strapping tearing off with some skin, and a sore shoulder.

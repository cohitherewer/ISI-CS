The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Harbhajan flays SA tactics

 - We always play to win, says Jacques Kallis 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Harbhajan Singh is livid at the ?negative? tactics adopted by South Africa. At the same time, he is pinning hopes on Virender Sehwag. 

?Till the time Sehwag is there, we don?t have to worry much. He can make up for all the overs lost due to bad light. Let?s hope Sehwag gets 200,? Harbhajan said after the second day. 

?We?ve done well so far? The first session of the third day will be important. If Veeru stays at the wicket, he can turn the match. We always aim to play positive cricket and win,? he added. 

Criticising the visitors? tactics, Harbhajan said: ?In Kanpur they took too long to score the runs. There was hardly any time to force a result. Here, we?ve got them early. Let?s see how it goes? It will be hard to bat on the last two days. Batting will be really tough in the fourth innings. They haven?t played under pressure so far. Let?s see how they react?? 

Harbhajan did not stop there. ?I don?t think any team can be happy with a draw. With this sort of cricket they can never put pressure on us. This cricket won?t take their team anywhere. 

?Their plan is just to be patient. But they still have to get the runs. Kallis was brilliant but the other batsmen were not playing their shots. Their approach left me baffled,? he remarked. 

The poor turnout at the Eden, he felt, may be a result of the ?Kanpur effect?. 

Harbhajan was introduced only after lunch on the second day and took two wickets in three balls to polish off the visitors? tail. But he isn?t complaining. 

?Irfan (Pathan) and Zaheer (Khan) bowled really well on the first day. But the way South Africa batted was disappointing. It seems they don?t want to win. They were scoring at only two runs an over. 

?Today Irfan and Zaheer put in another great effort. Sourav also got Kallis. All were bowling well, so the delay in my getting a bowl today. Maybe I was a bit unlucky.? 

Harbhajan is looking at the batsmen for throwing a challenge at the visitors. ?It?s now upto the batsmen to deliver. 

?I am looking forward to bowling more in the second innings. Hopefully we can put enough runs on the board. The wicket will be different in the second innings. It will be good fun. 

?So far it?s been a good batting wicket... But there?s hardly any bounce. Hopefully it will turn?? A total of ?around 500? will please the off-spinner. ?That will keep them under pressure.? 

Jacques Kallis, understandably, dismissed Harbhajan?s theory. ?Everytime we walk on to the field we play to win,? he emphasised. 

?It was a difficult wicket to bat on and you had to be patient. Probably it was a bit slower than expected and the idea was to stick around. Moreover, India bowled well.? 

Coach Ray Jennings echoed similar sentiments. ?South Africa were never under pressure. This is an inexperienced side. We?ll not play for a draw. If door is open, we?ll take the opportunity to force a result.? 

Kallis rated his century highly. ?This century will be up there in my list. But the hundred against Australia in my debut series will always rank at the very top. This ranks in front because it came before a passionate crowd and since the team was also in trouble.? 

He felt the wicket will break further. ?The wicket has deteriorated a bit? It?s taking spin and over the next two days, there will be more cracks.? 

He felt they fell short of expectations in the first innings. ?305 is an average score. We would have loved to get 400. We have to make up with early wickets tomorrow and come out fighting.?

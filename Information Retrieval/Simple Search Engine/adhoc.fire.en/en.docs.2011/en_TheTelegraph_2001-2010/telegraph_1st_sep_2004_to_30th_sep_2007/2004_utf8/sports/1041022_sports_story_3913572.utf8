Madrid: Top seed Tim Henman slumped to a 4-6, 6-4, 2-6 defeat by big-serving Croatian Ivan Ljubicic in the Madrid Masters third round on Thursday. 

Undermined by problems controlling his forehand from the start of the match, Henman clung on to his service until Ljubicic broke him at the fifth attempt to take the first set. 

The world No. 5 began the second set with a tense, tired-looking game but recovered after saving two break points when he was 2-3 down. 

He capitalised on his only break point of the match to claim Ljubicic?s next service game and held the lead to claim the set. 

The deciding set started tightly, but an increasingly frustrated Henman made a series of unforced errors. 

Trailing 2-5 and serving to stay in the tournament, another stray forehand gave Ljubicic victory.

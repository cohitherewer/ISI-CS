 ?Admiral? for Indian 2000 Guineas 

 HONKY DORY

 There are 15 horses in the running for the season?s second classic, the Indian 2,000 Guineas, which takes the centre stage in Sunday?s mega 10 event race card. Although, luck of clear run will be a vital factor in such a crowded field but four three-year-olds who are capable of landing the winner?s purse of more than Rs 24 lakh are Berlioz, Gold Star, Petronius Maximus and Star Admiral.

 If Berlioz, Gold Star and Star Admiral have had the benefit of good lung opener during the current season, Petronius Maximus has been very impressive in his morning workouts. Therefore, Petronius Maximus fancied to lift the Classic. N. McCullagh partners the Placerville-Indiscretion son trained by Cooji Katrak. However, he may face a strong challenge from a vastly improved Star Admiral.

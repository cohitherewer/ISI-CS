The Telegraph - Calcutta

 2 new faces in SA squad

Johannesburg: South Africa named two new caps on Tuesday and recalled spinner Nicky Boje in their 13-man squad to play England in the first Test in Port Elizabeth which starts on December 17. 

Opening batsman and wicketkeeper AB de Villiers and fast bowler Dale Steyn earned the call-up after excelling for the Easterns Titans in domestic cricket. 

Thami Tsolekile, who kept wickets with mixed fortunes in the recent tour of India, was also named in the squad. 

Left-arm spinner Boje was recalled after he withdrew from the India tour because of fears he could be detained by police probing match-fixing allegations. He also had surgery recently to remove a growth in his neck. 

A United Cricket Board of South Africa spokesman said: ?Nicky will have to pass a fitness test before the match.? 

Justin Ontong, who played in the second Test defeat against India in Calcutta, has been omitted while Herschelle Gibbs and strike bowler Andre Nel were not considered due to injury.

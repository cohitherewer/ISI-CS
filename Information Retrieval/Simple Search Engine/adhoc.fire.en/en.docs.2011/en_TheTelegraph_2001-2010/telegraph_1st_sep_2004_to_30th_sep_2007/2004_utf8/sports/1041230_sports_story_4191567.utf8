The Telegraph - Calcutta

 12 players reported for overage 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: An under-15 Orissa pacer is at the centre of controversy after bowling 35 overs in a day. It happened in Kalyani on Monday, the second day of the Polly Umrigar Trophy quarter final clash with Gujarat. 

Gujarat lodged an official complaint against Alok Sahoo and three of his teammates ? Anil Debanand Sasmal, Susajit Mohanty and Bikas Das ? for being over-aged. 

?How can an under-15 boy bowl spells of seven, 11 and 18 overs in a day? The speed at which he bowled also aroused suspicion. As for the other three, their physical appearance suggested they are well above 15,? said a Gujarat team official. 

Orissa retaliated on Wednesday, alleging that Gujarat had fielded six over-aged players ? Priyank Panchal, Urmil Trivedi, Rahil Shah, Kushal Shah, Abhay Patel and Manprit Juneja. 

For the record, the match ended in a draw but Orissa qualified for the semis on the strength of their first-innings lead. Sahoo bagged nine wickets in the match. 

There were two more protests ? by Uttar Pradesh against Andhra players, one of them being one-handed fast bowler Y. Abhimanyu. 

Medical tests on all these 12 boys were done Wednesday afternoon the results of which are awaited.

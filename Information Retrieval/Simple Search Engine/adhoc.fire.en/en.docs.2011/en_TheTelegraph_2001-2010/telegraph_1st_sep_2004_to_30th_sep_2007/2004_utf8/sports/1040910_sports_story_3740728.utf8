 McEnroe slams umpiring errors

New York: Jennifer Capriati?s quarter final victory over Serena Williams dominated the US Open on Wednesday. As rain washed out the day?s play, people had a chance to see the umpiring error that cost Williams a point in the opening game of the third set on Tuesday. 

Talks around the National Tennis Centre focussed on whether instant replay or other tools should be used to help make better rulings. There were at least two other questionable calls in the final game of Capriati?s 2-6, 6-4, 6-4 victory. 

?It was such a horrendous call. If I was closer to the court, I would have run onto it,? said John McEnroe, who is commentating for the US Cable Channel Broadcasting the event. ?I?ve seen a lot of bad calls in my day, but I don?t think I?ve seen three bad calls in a set like that.? 

McEnroe, who is in favour of some form of replay said, ?Do we put a TV on the umpire?s chair and leave it up to them? Or do we go to a player-challenge system?? 

However, according to the US Tennis Association executive Arlen Kantarian, ?We don?t want to go out there with a system that?s 90 per cent accurate. We want a system that?s 100 per cent accurate.? 

The USTA, ATP, WTA tour and ITF ran some tests two weeks ago of a line-call system that uses six to eight cameras and global position satellites. 

On Saturday, Capriati had lobbied for instant replay after she argued some calls during her third-round victory. 

Organisers apologise 

Meanwhile, US Open organisers have apologised to Serena Williams for a controversial line call during her quarter-final loss to Jennifer Capriati on Tuesday. 

Williams hit a backhand well inside the sideline at deuce in the opening game of the third set that was called good by the lineswoman but overruled by Mariana Alves. 

The third seed initially thought Alves had simply called the score wrongly, but the Portuguese confirmed that she had overruled. (Agencies)

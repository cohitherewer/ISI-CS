 Isinbayeva aims for 5m mark

 Isinbayeva feels she can add another 20 to 25 cm to her existing mark 

Moscow: Olympic pole vault champion Yelena Isinbayeva thinks she could raise the world record to five metres at next year?s world athletics championships. 

?You could say it?s a good bet I?ll break that record some time next year,? the Russian said. ?I?ve added 10 cm in just over 12 months, so I think it?s a good bet I might do it, maybe next August in Helsinki,? said the bubbly 22-year-old, referring to the 2005 world championships and her extraordinary ability to set records in big meetings. 

?I don?t want to sound overconfident, but I don?t think this five-metre barrier is something out of reach since I went over five metres in training a couple of times already and I think it?s just a matter of time before I do it in competition.? 

Isinbayeva has dominated women?s pole vault for the last 12 months after setting her first world record of 4.82 in Gateshead last July. 

She set her latest mark of 4.92 at this month?s Golden League meeting in Brussels, a week after winning the Olympic gold medal in Athens with yet another world-record performance. Isinbayeva also set a world record while winning this year?s world indoor title in Budapest. 

?I?ve had a phenomenal year but it has been a long one as well and I?m a bit tired now, but I?ve got one more competition remaining, then I can rest,? said Isinbayeva, who will finish her season at the IAAF final in Monaco this weekend. 

Isinbayeva, who gets $50,000 for each new mark, admitted that money played a role but said it was not her only motive. 

?Money is always nice and the more the better, but it?s not the reason why I compete and try to break records,? she said. 

Isinbayeva, dubbed ?Bubka in a skirt? by the Russian media, says she could easily add another 20 to 25 cm to her existing mark. ?Yes, I think I?m capable of going 5.15-5.20 or even higher,? she said.

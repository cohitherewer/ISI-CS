 Mehtab?s 3 in Bengal win

 - Santosh Trophy l 29-time champions need draw vs Andhra Pradesh for last-8 berth 

 A CORRESPONDENT 

 Mehtab Hussain?s enterprise and commitment was exemplary 

New Delhi: Twenty nine-time champions Bengal started their 2004 Santosh Trophy campaign with an emphatic 5-1 win over Mizoram, with dashing midfielder Mehtab Hussain scoring thrice. 

With this win, Bengal move to the top of Cluster 1, of the preliminary phase of the 59th Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) ? Santosh Trophy with three points. Andhra Pradesh also have three points but Bengal have a superior goal difference. Bengal need just a draw in their clash with Andhra Pradesh, on Wednesday, to enter the quarter finals. 

The quarter finals to commence on Thursday till October 26. Bengal, if they qualify, will be in group A, with seeded team Services and the qualifier from cluster 4, either Maharashtra or Uttar Pradesh. 

Bengal started tentatively in the 4-4-2 system. Fluency in attack and accuracy in passing were missing. Mehtab Hussain?s enterprise and commitment on the right and veteran Basudeb Mondal?s visionary passing gave Bengal an edge but striker Dipendu Biswas and roving winger Syed Rahim Nabi lacked penetration. 

Till the half-hour mark, attempts at goal, were limited, long rangers by Basudeb, Mehtab and defender Madhab Das, easily parried by goalkeeper Zothanluanga. 

In the 35th minute, Bengal went ahead with a well executed goal. Basudeb?s diagonal sent Mehtab surging down the right flank, whose cross was missed by the goalkeeper and Dipendu. Nabi, standing at the far post, trapped and scored. A minute later, Dipendu shot into the goalkeeper from close. 

After the breather, Bengal were more fluent with Amit Das replacing an out of sorts Noel Wilson. They started to play more passes and were more menacing in attack. At the hour mark, Mehtab cut in from the right and his angular placement struck a defender and went in. Nine minutes later, Dipendu after a solo dash evaded two defenders and his rising left footer bulged the roof of the net. 

Amit tucked in on the left, sent a measured through pass to Nabi in the 73rd minute. Cutting in from the left Nabi squared to Mehtab who side-footed into the net. 

Five minutes later, Mehtab made one more penetrative run but was tripped by defender Lalmawizuala (who was sent off for double booking). The Mohun Bagan midfielder, converted the resultant penalty kick with ease. Bengal relaxed and striker Lalruatsanga reduced the margin in the 87th minute with a blistering free kick.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Boje in, reserves pull-out option

 Nicky Boje 

Durban: Even as Nicky Boje conditionally agreed on Wednesday to be part of the 14-member squad for the two-Test tour of India, Delhi police declared they will ?examine? the South African spinner and Herschelle Gibbs over their alleged involvement in match-fixing. Gibbs, however, has opted out of the tour. 

?There are specific references and attributes to Boje and Gibbs in their (Hansie Cronje and prime accused Pradeep Chawla) conversation mentioned in the FIR. In the circumstances, in case they are with the team, they would be required to be examined in the matter on the relevant points,? police commissioner K.K. Paul said in a letter written to BCCI vice-president Rajiv Shukla. 

At the same time, Boje has said he would wait for assurance from Indian authorities that he would not be interrogated. Whether or not he changes his stand remains to be seen. 

Interestingly, veteran wicketkeeper Mark Boucher has been dropped and Boje named the provisional vice-captain instead. If Boje finally decides not to go to India, Boeta Dippenaar will take over the vice-captain?s role and Charl Langeveld will join the squad as an extra bowler. 

?Nicky has indicated to me that he is very keen to tour. But the ultimate decision must be taken by the player himself,? Omar Henry, the South African convenor of selectors, said on Wednesday. 

On the other hand, as expected, Gibbs made himself unavailable for selection. 

?For him to once again be subjected to what amounts to cross-examination is inappropriate and morally and legally indefensible. In the circumstances my advice to Herschelle has been that he should not respond to the questions posed by the Delhi Police. He has elected to follow my advice,? Gibbs? attorney Peter Whelan said. 

Gibbs himself said: ?I am extremely disappointed at having to declare myself unavailable for the tour. The questions sent from Delhi were very similar to those I answered four years ago. I have served my ban and in the process learnt a very hard lesson.? 

UCBSA chief executive Gerald Majola said the board was willing to co-operate with any official inquiry into alleged match fixing and bribery. 

Apart from Boucher, Lance Klusener also found himself missing the bus to India. Among the uncapped players are Indian origin batsman Hashim Amla, allrounder Zander de Bruyn and pace bowler Alfonso Thomas. Thami Tsolekile would take over the keeping duties from Boucher. 

A veteran of 76 Tests, Boucher had come under immense scrutiny by his critics for a woeful form with the bat, while his attitude in the national set-up has also been questioned. 

THE SQUAD 

Graeme Smith, Nicky Boje/ Charl Langeveld, Hashim Amla, Zander De Bruyn, Boeta Dippenaar, Andrew Hall, Jacques Kallis, Makhaya Ntini, Justin Ontong, Shaun Pollock, Jacques Rudolph, Thami Tsolekile, Alfonso Thomas, Martin van Jaarsveld.

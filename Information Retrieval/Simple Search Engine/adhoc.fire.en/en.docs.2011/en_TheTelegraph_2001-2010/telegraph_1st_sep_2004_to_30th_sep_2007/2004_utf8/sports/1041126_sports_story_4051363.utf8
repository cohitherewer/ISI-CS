 Dempo down Ever-Ready 

Bangalore: A double strike by Ronty Martins propelled Dempo Sports Club to a 3-1 win over Ever-Ready in the Federation Cup football championship here on Thursday. 

Dempo began impressively with a second-minute strike through Nigerian import Martins, who landed the ball with precision off a Cristiano Junior cross. 

Ever-Ready finally got the equaliser in the 57th minute, through Jayanta Sen, who scored the goal off a rebound from Satish Kumar. 

With both sides trying to outsmart each other and gain an upper hand, it was a solo effort by forward Martins that gave Dempo the lead again in the 73rd minute. 

Enthused by the success, Dempo men stepped up their attack and scored another goal four minutes later when Junior?s successful shot off a free-kick rolled into the net with Amit Singha Roy, the Ever-Ready custodian, watching helplessly. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Anil a better example: Kapil 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

Calcutta: Kapil Dev isn?t disappointed that his India-best of 434 wickets has been equalled by Anil Kumble, but is definitely disappointed that the star leggie didn?t get one more victim at the Eden. 

?Yes, that?s what I told Anil? The Eden, after all, would have been the perfect venue to go one better. He will surely do it in Bangladesh, but that won?t quite be the same,? Kapil told The Telegraph when contacted on his cellphone. 

Once the world record-holder, Kapil added: ?Anil?s dedication and attitude has taken him so far? The fact that he has reached 434 so much quicker confirms that the generation which came after us is doing better. Anil, then, is a better example? 

?Now, I hope Anil is going to keep himself fit and look to crossing the 500-mark? The decision will be his, but I feel he could now concentrate wholly on Test cricket.? 

Kapil, by the way, admitted that at no time in Kumble?s initial years did he expect him to touch the heights he has. 

?Anil has, along the way, gone from strength to strength? His attitude is commendable and I wish he quickly gets to 500? It?s important for a cricketer to know his strengths and weaknesses. Anil, in my opinion, has always been clear in his mind.? 

That?s a wonderful tribute.

 Ponting wants Dravid to join in formal protest

 Ponting 

Sydney: Ricky Ponting has asked Rahul Dravid to join him in a formal protest over the Mumbai wicket which saw Australia suffer a 13-run defeat in the fourth and final Test against India. 

Ponting said his displeasure would be spelt out in his official captain?s post-match report, and that he was hoping to enlist the support of Dravid, who stood as captain in the Mumbai Test, to impress on the need to have more genuine Test pitches. 

Australia were bowled in less than a session for 93 off 30.5 overs to lose the fourth Test as 20 wickets fell on a day for the first time in Test history. 

Ponting, who arrived here from Mumbai on Saturday, said the Wankhede wicket was blatantly sub-standard and his side?s second innings batting effort could be almost exclusively attributed to the dodgy deck. 

?It?s the sort of wicket where you?re always in two minds about what to do,? he was quoted as saying in media reports here on Sunday. 

?If you try to stand there and defend you?re eventually going to get out. If you try to play a shot here and there, you?ve a good chance of getting out as well. You can?t fault any of the guys. We tried our hardest and we ended up getting pretty close,? he said. 

The Aussie skipper, who missed the first three Tests of the series due to a thumb injury, said he wanted to talk to Dravid about the issue. 

?I want to have a chat with Rahul about it, and put our minds together. I don?t think he?ll have too many good things to say about the wicket either. We need to have a chat about it, and have a chat to the Referee... 

?I guess the Match Referee will write a report about this wicket, and obviously that?ll be sent to the ICC. Let?s hope there is an inquiry, just because it?s so disappointing,? Ponting said. 

He also said India?s cricket would be better served with more atypical wickets, such as the one prepared in Nagpur, where Australia won the third Test by 342 runs.

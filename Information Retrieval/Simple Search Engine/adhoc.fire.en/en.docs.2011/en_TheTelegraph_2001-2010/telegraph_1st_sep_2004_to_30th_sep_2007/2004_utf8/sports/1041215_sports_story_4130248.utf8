 Favourites take all for ride 

 STAR RACER

The crime is on the rise at the RCTC ground. Repeated incidents of hot-favourites fooling around and culprits eluding the official pundits was not the idea of a senior steward who had vouched to put RCTC back to a respectable position about a month and half ago. 

 The pathetic performance of hot-fancies like Accuser and Dream Sovereign last Saturday, followed a week after Alashaan?s wretched display of form. 

 It can?t be termed coincidental as it?s been happening too often in recent weeks. Whodunit, horses, trainers or jockeys? Punters have their own theories but stipendiary stewards have definitely failed to pin culprits.

 The afternoon was a total disaster for those who went by the formbook. Favourites started tripping right from the first race. However, two-year-old babies cannot be blamed for their indifferent form in early runs. Therefore, Averroes? defeat at the hands of Pure Valour was purely incidental. Former?s recent run was just about okay, but the winner was far superior in comparison.

 Dream Sovereign got planted at the gates and lost the race at the start itself. The even-money favourite, in his earlier outings, had never shown such a tendency. He may have come out of the gates a stride or two slow, but never got planted.

 Nevertheless, Positive Thinker led a merry dance soon after he assumed charge of running to triumph handsomely.

 A switch to blinkers did help Compassionate trounce the field in the 2,000m Burdwan Cup, after an early hiccup, but there was no excuses for the half-money favourite Accuser to place a dismal fourth. The Bharath Singh-trainee struck to the wrong-end of the field, but ahead of the winner till the halfway stage. While Compassionate went about her business, Accuser remained stuck on fourth.

 Farley Rodrigues? A?Ma Jaju looked tuned to the minute for the BSF Trophy, and the Argyle Lake-A Ma Dats ?E daughter obliged her followers with a start-to-finish victory. She established a long lead from the start, which helped her counter a late challenge from Azinger. She won a mile race after nearly nine months lay off and she may be hard to stop when she runs again.

 Followme, the least fancied of the Bharath-trio in a field of nine had the measure of stablemate Aneroid in a 1,400m race. The Batzushka-Fusion filly galloped in close attendance of Aneroid but displayed superior acceleration when the heat was on. Stable?s other fancy, Deeqa, ended up her challenge mid-way in the final stretch to indicate her preference for longer course.

 The half-money favourite Calescent was the lone saviour in the seven-event card. But the Alnasr Alwasheek-Preparation son had to be stretched to keep Royal Bounty?s challenge at a bay in the 1,400m Galstaun Cup. Hoagy, who placed a decent third, may repay losses soon.

 Quietly fancied six-year-old Midas Touch, who was a fair fifth against a younger opposition, struck in the older company. Pearl Dragon attracted a sizeable wagering in the race at 2-1 but the Deepak Karki-ward had to settle for the minor slot. He may strike against a similar opposition.

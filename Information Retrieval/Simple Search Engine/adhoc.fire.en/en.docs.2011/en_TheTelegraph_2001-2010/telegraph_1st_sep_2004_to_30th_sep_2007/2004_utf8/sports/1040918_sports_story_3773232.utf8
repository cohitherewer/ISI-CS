 Derby for Elistano 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Elistano walked away with the 2,000m Calcutta Derby Trial Stakes at the RCTC ground on Friday. The seven-length victory of the even-money favourite over a strongly fancied Bollywood Dreams also settled the argument that his narrow win in an earlier encounter over the shorter classic was no fluke. C. Alford rode a well-judged race on the Vijay Singh-trainee. 

 Elistano, who hailed from a staying-line, was held back in the rear after a marginally slow start. The Metal Precieux-Pot Of Gold three-year-old was kept in close attendance of Bollywood Dreams from the midway onwards. It was in the final 600m that Elistano improved rapidly on the wide out of the field to assume charge of the running 300m from home. He faced no opposition thereafter.

 Vijay had a very profitable afternoon. Derby apart, the champion trainer saddled three more winners in the eight event card. His most prized catch was the Star Of Italy Cup which saw a complete humiliation of the odds-on favourite Bold Raider in the hands of Thrilling Proposal. S. Shanker partnered the winner. Earlier Vijay was helped by Alford to steer home Approved and Corvino in their respective events ? the Desert Shot Cup and the Fair Ray Handicap. 

 Jockey B. Prakash and trainer Daniel David also scored a double apiece.

Chittagong: Daniel Vettori put New Zealand in a winning position in the second and final cricket Test against Bangladesh at the M.A. Aziz Stadium here on Thursday. 

The left-arm spinner completed his second 10-wicket haul in Test cricket. 

He took eight wickets in New Zealand?s first Test victory, captured six for 70 in the first innings and has four for 77 so far in the second. 

At stumps on Day III, Bangladesh were 210 for eight in their second innings, still needing 153 runs to make New Zealand bat again.The home side were asked to follow on after they were dismissed for 182 in their first innings in reply to New Zealand?s 545 for six declared. 

Vettori was ably assisted by off-spinner Paul Wiseman, making one of his rare appearances for New Zealand. 

He returned with figures of three for 68 and two for 77. 

Opener Javed Omar, who scored 58 from 151 balls in the first innings, and Khaled Mashud, with 51 from 87 balls in the second including nine boundaries, were the only batsman to offer any extended resistance to the Black Cap spinners. 

Omar, 45 overnight, swept the spinners repeatedly as he got to his fifth half-century in Tests and also crossed the 1,000-run mark during his defiant knock. 

The 27-year-old opener became only the second Bangladeshi batsman to do so after indisposed skipper Habibul Bashar, who has got 2,079 runs in 30 Tests.

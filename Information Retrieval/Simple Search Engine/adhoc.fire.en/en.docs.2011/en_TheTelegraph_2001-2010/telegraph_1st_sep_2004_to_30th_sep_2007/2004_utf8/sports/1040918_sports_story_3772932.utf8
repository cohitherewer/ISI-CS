The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Taufel ready for the ?challenge?

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

Birmingham: Simon Taufel, the International 

Cricket Council?s (ICC?s) Umpire of the Year, is ready for the ?challenges? ahead 

? the immediate one being Sunday?s Champions Trophy match between India and Pakistan. 

?At this moment, there?s no bigger challenge... It?s 

a huge game and I?ll be looking to get the decisions right,? the 33-year-old Elite 

Panel umpire told The Telegraph on Friday. 

Taufel, of course, officiated in quite a few Indo-Pak matches in Pakistan earlier this year and, so, is aware of the pressure on everybody ? players and umpires. 

Asked if his being chosen for the inaugural ICC award puts him under more pressure than what goes with the job, Taufel laughed: ?Don?t think so... The pressure is to always make the correct decision...? 

On Sunday, the Sydneysider?s on-field colleague is 

going to be the more experienced Rudi Koertzen.

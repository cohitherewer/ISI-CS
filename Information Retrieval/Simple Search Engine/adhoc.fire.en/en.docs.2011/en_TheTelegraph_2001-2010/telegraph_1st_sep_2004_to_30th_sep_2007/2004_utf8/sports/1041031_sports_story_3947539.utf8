The Telegraph - Calcutta

India have themselves to blame 

Stump Vision

Ian Healy

Always looking to innovate, the Australians have backed 

up their latest one with a performance to behold in the Nagpur Test. Players took 

advantage of a six-day break in totally different ways. Never before have holidays 

in different countries been taken in the middle of tours. Possibly in the United 

Kingdom, so why not in Asia? Get away from cricket was a clear motivation and 

it worked sensationally in Nagpur.

Australia, under pressure to lift in several areas, 

sent the strongest teachings to all opponents and coaches of all levels about 

the dangers of overtraining. They produced an inspiring, nation-stopping, dismantling 

of a side which were their equal just one week ago.

India suffered massively in Harbhajan?s absence, it 

must be said and someone to support the pace of Zaheer Khan would have prevented 

some run-flow, but these Aussies were so ready for India, at full strength or 

not.

India were terrible on the first afternoon when they 

let chances slip crucially towards the end of play. Clarke, who was the beneficiary 

of a close leg-before earlier, was missed twice behind and also a half chance 

run-out.

The difference would have been confidence leading 

into their first innings. You can?t compete with the Australian attack in the 

form they are in without confidence and momentum. India have no one to blame but 

themselves because it was their own lack of skill at critical times in the field. 

Which approach will John Wright take to remedy these problems? Overtraining or 

holidaying?

The so-called controversial pitch preparation was 

a fizzer. It was beautifully neutral and allowed the relative form and talent 

of the combatants to surface, as any good pitch should. All facets of play prospered 

because of the pitch, which is another good sign. Zaheer troubled all Australian 

bats; McGrath, Gillespie and Kasprowicz were as strong a group as I have seen 

and Warne found something. Langer was quickly out of the blocks, Martyn, Katich, 

Clarke loved it while credit to Kaif and Sehwag for their enterprise with the 

stick. Too many of the Indians are too far out of form for them to threaten.

In the past two years I have been impressed by India?s 

pack mentality (learnt from the Australian team) where someone has been getting 

the job done for the team to continue confidently, but no one has looked remotely 

capable in this match. It is now psychological and cloudy heads must be cleared 

to save Test careers and get feet moving again. 

No centuries to the legendary Australian opening batsmen 

and the series is won. Martyn has been tough and exquisite in his application 

of a natural flair and has covered extensively. Eight months ago he was on the 

chopping block and now, another summer like this, he can contest the world player 

of the year award. Much has been written about Clarke and he is special but how 

well is Simon Katich cruising around his new surroundings? He will never be overstated 

but his performances in his career so far are a credit to him.

Great to see Gillespie get deserved returns even if 

he did miss out on his first 10-wicket haul. Warne quite possibly bowled the best 

he has in India, although I will leave that up to him. He rediscovered some drift 

and sharp spin at times on a wicket more like home. Was that the flipper I saw 

more than I have for the last five years as well? He is still not finished for 

this series and it is clear that India have underestimated his danger. 

The skipper bounced back to his absolute sharpest 

too which requires preparation and toughness to turn form around so quickly behind 

the stumps. Gilchrist?s footwork was crisp and made things look easy once again. 

Top effort considering what was on his plate. Thirty-five years of history has 

stopped and he has had a major hand in this clinical exhibition.

I can?t wait to see the reaction of the Indian selectors. 

If, in their opinions, the players that they are selecting are good players, there 

is no need for panic changes. (PTI)

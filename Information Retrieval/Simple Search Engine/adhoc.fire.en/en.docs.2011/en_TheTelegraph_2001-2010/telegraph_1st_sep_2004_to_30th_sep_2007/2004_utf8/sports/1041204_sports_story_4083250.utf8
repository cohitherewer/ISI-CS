The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Devang unfit, not dropped 

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Bengal?s experienced top-order bat Devang Gandhi isn?t fit and so hasn?t been selected for Bengal?s Ranji Trophy Elite group A match against Mumbai. Friday?s report in these columns, saying that he was dropped, was incorrect. That is regretted. 

?I twisted my right ankle while fielding during the match against Gujarat in Siliguri. So, after coming back, I informed the CAB secretary (Bablu Kolay) of my unavailability for the Bengal-Mumbai match,? Devang said, when contacted at his residence on Friday. 

Kolay also confirmed that the right-handed batsman had opted out of the match. 

Devang said he needed another week to be fit. Bengal?s next Ranji match is against Andhra Pradesh, starting on December 13.

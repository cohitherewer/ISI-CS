 Ballesteros under tour investigation

Sotogrande (Spain): Severiano Ballesteros is to be investigated by the European Tour following an alleged assault on one of the tour?s tournament directors at his home course Pedrena. 

Ballesteros is believed to have assaulted fellow Spaniard Jose Maria Zamora last month during the Spanish Amateur Championship, the tour said on Wednesday at Valderrama, where the end-of-season Volvo Masters starts on Thursday. 

Zamora, an accomplished player who could have turned professional had he not decided to join the tour?s administrative staff, won the over-35s event at Pedrena where the alleged incident was reported by the Spanish Federation. 

The European Tour said it is carrying out a full investigation, although director of communications Gordon Simpson said: ?Obviously, at this stage, the tour can say nothing.? 

Zamora, who is working at this week?s Volvo Masters, was not available for comment. 

A spokesman for Ballesteros told Reuters:?I know there is something between them but it is personal.?

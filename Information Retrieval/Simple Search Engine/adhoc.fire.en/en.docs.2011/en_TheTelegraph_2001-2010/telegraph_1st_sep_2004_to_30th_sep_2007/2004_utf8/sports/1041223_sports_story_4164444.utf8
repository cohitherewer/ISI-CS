 PCB reins in Woolmer

 Bob Woolmer 

Islamabad: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has asked coach Bob Woolmer to avoid making unnecessary statements, saying these were making things more complicated for everyone. 

PCB sources said chief Shaharyar Khan, troubled over the spate of statements appearing in international and Pakistan press quoting Woolmer, had a discussion with him on this. 

?Basically the PCB chief told Woolmer that he should only speak to the press when it is absolutely necessary and give issue-related statements,? the sources were quoted as saying in local daily The News. 

?Shaharyar told him that too many statements were only making things more complicated for everyone. 

?The PCB chief also spoke to the coach on his recent war of words with former coach Javed Miandad,? the sources said. Woolmer?s outspokenness had also led former Pakistan captain Zaheer Abbas to remark that unnecessary comments like talking about the threat posed by Glenn McGrath and Jason Gillespie only added to the pressure on the players. 

The report said former captain Imran Khan had also advised Woolmer, before the tour of Australia, to avoid giving too many statements in the press through PCB manager, cricket operations, Zakir Khan. Shaharyar has also reportedly called up Miandad and requested him to refrain from talking about Woolmer, they said. (PTI)

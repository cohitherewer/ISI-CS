The Telegraph - Calcutta

 I?ll decide in a couple of days: Greg Chappell

 - Coaching offer from the West Indies 

 - It?s a 50-50 scenario, says confidant 

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI 

 Greg Chappell 

Bangalore: Former Australian captain (and icon batsman) Greg Chappell will take a ?couple of days? to decide whether he should head for the West Indies and take up the coach?s post. 

?Discussions are at a delicate stage... Actually, I ought not to say more,? Greg told The Telegraph on Friday afternoon, when contacted at a Sydney golf club. 

However, he added: ?The next couple of days should clear the picture... By then, my mind is going to be made up...? 

While Greg declined to elaborate, a confidant revealed he was approached by the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) during the recent Champions Trophy in England. As it turned out, the Brian Lara-led West Indies won the title with a scintillating win over Michael Vaughan?s England. 

?That meeting took place in London... Frankly, at this moment, it?s a fifty-fifty scenario... Greg may accept the offer, equally, he could say no...? the confidant pointed out. 

Significantly, the WICB has terminated Gus Logie?s contract. But, then, the turnover of coaches in the West Indies is as high as the captains in Pakistan. 

Greg hasn?t coached a national side, but has worked with the Sri Lankans and, earlier this year, signed up as consultant with the Pakistan Cricket Board. He is supposed to visit Pakistan thrice a year and the first trip has already been made. 

At home, Greg has coached South Australia. 

Meanwhile, the confidant informed that a ?senior Indian cricketer? too interacted with Greg during the Champions Trophy, seeking his thoughts on possibly succeeding John Wright. 

Wright?s ?contract? ? it isn?t, by the way, in writing ? has been extended till the end of this season. 

?The senior, from what I know, spoke to Greg at some length but, apparently, there hasn?t been any follow-up... Now, of course, this West Indies business has come up,? the confidant said. 

Greg, it may be recalled, was among those interviewed by the Board of Control for Cricket in India, four years ago, when the ?hunt? for Kapil Dev?s successor was in full swing. 

Each candidate ? others being Geoff Marsh and Wright himself ? had to make a ?presentation? and sources then had confirmed Greg?s was the best. 

Greg didn?t get the call largely because the remuneration he sought was beyond even the world?s richest cricket body. Additionally, nobody was sure how the Sourav Gangulys and Sachin Tendulkars would react to somebody so high-profile coming on board. 

Wright, therefore, got the nod.

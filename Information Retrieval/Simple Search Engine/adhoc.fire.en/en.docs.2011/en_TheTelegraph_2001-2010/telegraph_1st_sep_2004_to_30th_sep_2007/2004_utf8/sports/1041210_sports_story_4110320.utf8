 Randhawa shoots 9-under 63

New Delhi: India?s Jyoti Randhawa shot a career-best nine under-par 63 to begin with a four-stroke first-round lead while compatriot Jeev Milkha Singh carded a 67 for second place in the $550,000 Volvo Masters of Asia golf meet in Kuala Lumpur on Thursday. 

Randhawa was in imperious form in the Asian Tour?s season finale at Kota Permai Golf and Country Club and left the elite field in his wake with a nine-birdie round. 

He birdied the third, fifth, seventh and eighth holes to turn in 32 and then had three straight birdies from the 10th and two more on 15 and 18, according to information received here. 

?I played great. I didnt miss any green and putted nicely. My mental focus was good. I didnt hit a bad shot today, it was almost perfect golf,? Randhawa, who is looking for his first victory of the year, said. 

Randhawa?s effort matched the course record held by Scotsman Simon Yates but it will not be considered official as the ?preferred lie? ruling was in play. (PTI)

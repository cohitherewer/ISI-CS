The Telegraph - Calcutta

Hewitt, Federer set up intriguing clash

CHRIS BROUSSARD 

 Lleyton Hewitt at Flushing Meadow on Saturday. 

He beat Swede Joachim Johansson to enter the final 

The Americans bowed out relatively early. Controversy 

clouded the elimination of one of the game?s biggest names, Serena Williams, and 

rain and wind each had a day to ravage the tournament. But in the final match 

of this year?s US Open, it can be argued that things will finally be as they should 

be. 

Yes, the power-serving Andy Roddick is gone, as is 

the crowd favourite, Andre Agassi. But when the men?s champion is decided at Arthur 

Ashe Stadium, the season?s two hottest players will be doing the swinging. Top-ranked 

and top-seeded Roger Federer will meet fourth-seeded Lleyton Hewitt, who is riding 

a roll unmatched by anyone on the ATP Tour. 

It is an intriguing match-up that pits power against 

precision. Each player flourished with his particular style in Saturday?s semi-finals, 

knocking off their opponents in straight sets. Federer overpowered fifth-seeded 

Tim Henman, 6-3, 6-4, 6-4, while Hewitt picked apart the hard-swinging Joachim 

Johansson, 6-4, 7-5, 6-3. Federer, of Switzerland, will now attempt to become 

the first man since Mats Wilander in 1988 to win three Grand Slam events in one 

season. Federer, who has won his last 10 finals, is also looking to become the 

first player since the Open era began in 1968 to win four Grand Slam finals without 

a loss. 

In winning the Australian Open at the start of the 

year, Federer beat Hewitt in four sets in the Round of 16. This summer, when Federer 

won Wimbledon, he put out Hewitt in the quarter finals, again in four sets. Although 

Hewitt leads their career series, 8-5, Federer has won all three of their meetings 

in 2004. 

And Federer said he was a much different player than 

the one Hewitt beat up on from 1999 through the Davis Cup in 2003. ?Mentally and 

physically I?m more stronger to handle him,? said Federer, who has won nine of 

10 sets in Grand Slam finals. ?In the past, I wasn?t. I think that makes a big 

difference now.? 

But no one, not even Federer, is hotter than Australia?s 

Hewitt, who is hoping to recapture the US Open crown that he won in 2001. Hewitt 

made it through the first six rounds this year without losing a set, and Saturday?s 

match was his 16th straight victory, the second-longest streak this year behind 

Federer?s 23. Hewitt is coming off titles in Washington and on Long Island and 

was the runner-up to Agassi in Cincinnati shortly before going on his winning 

streak. 

Hewitt?s run earned him the US Open Series title, 

meaning he was the most successful player in the six-week, 10-tournament period 

leading up to the Open. That title will earn him an extra $500,000 if he wins 

in the final. Like Federer, Hewitt is undefeated in Grand Slam finals, winning 

Wimbledon in 2002 in addition to the Open three years ago. Despite his credentials, 

Hewitt is the decided underdog. After being dismantled in straight sets, Henman 

said it would take some sort of marvel to beat Federer. 

?If you take Roddick?s serve and Agassi?s returns 

and my volleys and Hewitt?s speed and tenacity, then you?ve probably got a good 

chance against Federer,? said the 30-year-old Henman, who failed to reach the 

first Grand Slam final of his career. ?That?s a lot of people involved in one 

player.? 

Federer has been that good this season, despite recent 

hiccups in the Olympics, where he lost in the second round, and in Cincinnati, 

where he lost his opener. Federer said there was nothing that he would change 

about his game right now. If it sounds as if he was confident going into the final, 

that?s because he was. 

?I?ve beaten him,? Federer said of Hewitt. ?There?s 

no more fear. Really, just respect towards the great player he is and a great 

competitor. I?m looking forward to it. It?s a big occasion for both of us. It?s 

going to be interesting to see.? 

But Hewitt is confident as well. ?Obviously, playing 

Roger, the No. 1 player in the world, I?m going to have to play some great tennis 

to get on top of him,? Hewitt said. ?But I feel like I?m playing well at the moment, 

and I give myself a good chance.?

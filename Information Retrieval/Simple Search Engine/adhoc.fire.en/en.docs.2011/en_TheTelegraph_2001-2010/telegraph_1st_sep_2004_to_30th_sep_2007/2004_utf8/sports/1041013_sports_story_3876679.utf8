 Yao Ming measures up in US and China

 Yao Ming at a press conference in Shanghai on Tuesday 

New York: Smashing stereotypes forged over centuries and bearing the burden of being an inspiration to a billion compatriots is a mighty tall order. 

China?s 2.29-metre National Basketball Association (NBA) sensation Yao Ming is up to the task. 

With one foot rooted in the ways and wisdom of the Chinese civilisation and the other size-18 sneaker planted in the jet-setting world of the NBA, Yao shares his story simply and powerfully in a new, 290-page memoir, ?Yao: A Life in Two Worlds.? 

?Not many people have tried to do what I am doing, to be part of America and China at the same time,? writes Yao, the towering Houston Rockets All-Star, who two years ago became the first international player named number one pick in the NBA Draft. 

?At least not so many have tried to do it with so many people watching.? 

They watch him play at North America?s biggest arenas, watch his good-humoured television commercials and, in China, where Yao fever is hottest, more than a billion people watched NBA games on television last year, according to NBA spokesman Matt Bourne. Hundreds of New Yorkers, including scores of Chinese Americans, showed up at a recent Yao book signing in Manhattan. 

?I think he represents a symbol to all the Chinese people, breaking barriers,? said college student Andre Hu, 22. ?Not just in sports, but in all areas.? 

?He?s the Michael Jordan of China,? said Ming Wong, 28, a telecommunications consultant. ?He?s great already and he?s going to be a legend one day.? 

Yao says being a role model can be difficult and that is one of the reasons he produced the book with writer Ric Bucher. 

?It is a type of burden,? Yao, 24, said through his interpreter, Colin Pine. ?It seems like those people think there?s nothing I can?t do. I wanted to write in this book that there are lots of things I can?t do. What I can do is try to do my own work as perfectly as I can.? 

Yao, the son of former Chinese national basketball players, has done his NBA work well, improving his scoring average from 13.5 to 17.5 points in his second season, and increasing his average rebounds haul from 8.20 to 9.00 a game to help lift the Rockets into the playoffs. 

Yao?s life as a rookie in the NBA spotlight was generally confined to the hours it took to play each game. He spent the rest of his time in the Houston home he shares with his parents, and in his hotel room when the Rockets were on the road. 

?I went out twice my first season,? writes Yao. ?One time was to a disco in Houston?s Chinatown. I had heard this was a really good place to go, but we went on a Sunday, and there weren?t a lot of people there. 

?The other time I went out was in LA. Wang Zhi Zhi (the NBA?s first Chinese player) took me out for Korean food. That?s it.? 

Yao?s book opens an enlightening window to his past and his struggle against what he calls a deep-rooted Chinese fear of failure and change. 

He tells how he courted his girlfriend Ye Li, a player on China?s national basketball team, for almost two years before she agreed to go out with him.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

Calcutta: Madan Lal does not wish to take credit for his son?s cricket career and says ?he has to build his own future?. 

Kunal, though, says his father ?has been a great source of inspiration?. ?He has played so much and can only encourage you to get better and better?. 

The 20-year-old, playing his third Ranji Trophy match, finished with career-best figures of three for 55 in the Bengal first innings on Thursday. 

Does having his father as coach in the same team help? ?I would say my feelings are mixed? It?s not easy, it can be very tough and demanding at times,? Kunal told The Telegraph on Tuesday. 

Having been brought up in a cricketing atmosphere, he took to the game at an early age and has played for Delhi under-16 and under-19 before making his debut at the senior level against Railways last season. Coach Manu Nayyar, at his father?s academy, has also played a significant part in his career. 

The promising left-arm mediumpacer ? doing his graduation in mass communication from Amity University in Delhi ? idolises his father but Wasim Akram is someone he ?looks up to with reverence?. 

?Akram?s fighting qualities are exemplary,? Kunal explained.

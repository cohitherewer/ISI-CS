 Real Madrid coach Camacho steps down

Madrid: Jose Antonio Camacho resigned as Real Madrid coach on Monday just four months after taking up the post saying that he felt incapable of getting the most out of the club?s expensively assembled squad. 

?I believe that the team has not lived up to expectations and that as long as I remain as coach it will not improve and that?s why I?ve decided to step down,? Camacho told a news conference at the Bernabeu. 

?I?ve got my own way of behaving and of coaching. I did not see it reflected on the pitch and I couldn?t see the situation improving. 

?The president asked me if I thought I could turn things around in the short term and I told him that I did not, so we reached an agreement that in order to prevent the club entering into an even bigger crisis I would give up the post.? 

Club president Florentino Perez said that Camacho?s former assistant Mariano Garcia Remon would take charge of the first team. The terms of his contract were not made clear. 

Garcia Remon, an ex-Real Madrid goalkeeper, who won six league titles during his 14 seasons at the club between 1971 and 1985, is a former boss of Sporting Gijon and Numancia. He will be Real?s fourth coach since June 2003. 

Garcia Remon stressed that he had only accepted the job after Camacho had urged him to do so. ?It may seem odd, but for me today is a very sad day,? he said.?It is a day that sees that the end of the work of someone who has done a very good job that just wasn?t reflected on the pitch. ?It wasn?t the way I dreamed of being here to train Real Madrid.? 

Remon, a low-profile former player is very much in the mould of Vicente del Bosque, the man who led them to two European Cups and two league titles in four seasons before being discarded at the end of the 2002-2003 season. 

Camacho was appointed as coach in place of Carlos Queiroz after the failure of Real ? with players like Ronaldo, Zinedine Zidane and David Beckham ? to win a trophy last season. It is the second time he has made a premature exit from the club he served so loyally as a player. 

He managed only 23 days in the post in 1998, quitting before the season had even started after a row with then president Lorenzo Sanz about a contract for fitness trainer Carlos Lorenzana.

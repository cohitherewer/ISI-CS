 JFA cuts Zico to size

Tokyo: Zico was left in no doubt as to who rules the roost in Japanese soccer after being forced into an embarrassing climbdown last week. 

The Brazilian coach?s ill-advised plan to pick former internationals for this month?s World Cup qualifier against Singapore provoked an angry reaction from J-League clubs, players and the Japan Football Association (JFA). 

With Japan already through to next year?s final round of Asian 2006 World Cup qualifiers, Zico wanted to include old boys such as Kazuyoshi Miura and Masashi Nakayama as a tribute to their contribution to Japanese soccer. His critics felt a simple ?thank you? note would do, insisting Zico should give players on the fringe of the squad the chance to play in Saitama on November 17. 

The Asian Football Confederation (AFC) had even tried to persuade Japan not to name a weakened squad after criticism that doing so would be disrespectful to Singapore. 

It was little surprise then that when Zico announced his 18-man squad on Friday, the names of Miura, Nakayama and Yutaka Akita were missing. The powerful J-League clubs had vociferously opposed Zico?s idea and several Japan players also gave it a lukewarm response. 

A sheepish-looking Zico told reporters that he had changed his mind after talking to players. 

Zico has been sent a clear message by those in power at JFA headquarters in Tokyo. 

He may not get involved in training ground bust-ups with players, row with the JFA or shove photographers like Troussier, but Zico too must play by the JFA?s rules. (Reuters)

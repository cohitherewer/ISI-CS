 Aragones behaviour to be probed

Madrid: The Spanish football federation (RFEF) has opened an investigation into the behaviour of national coach Luis Aragones following a recommendation by the country?s Anti-violence Commission. 

Aragones landed himself in trouble in October when he made apparently racist remarks about France striker Thierry Henry. 

He caused further controversy when he mounted an energetic defence of his comments on the eve of last month?s friendly against England in which he also criticised that country?s colonial past. The friendly at the Bernabeu was marred by racist abuse and chanting directed at visiting black players by large sections of the crowd. 

?I was expecting the news because the president (Angel Maria Villar) had already told me about it,? Aragones was quoted as saying by sports daily AS on Wednesday. 

?But in a case like this everyone has the right to defend themselves.? 

Villar was urged by the government-sponsored commission to set up the probe when he appeared before the body last Friday. 

The investigation will examine whether Aragones? remarks were in breach of the Federation?s rules regarding ?conduct contrary to good order in sport?. 

Spain?s minister of sport Jaime Lissavetsky said he wanted the RFEF to introduce a campaign against racism in football as soon as possible. 

?We have to have zero tolerance over the matter of racism. We don?t want behaviour of this sort in our country.? 

Real Madrid?s recent Champions League game against Bayer Leverkusen and a number of Primera Liga matches have been marred by racist abuse directed at black players by fans. (Reuters)

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Indian expats rule Edgbaston

 - Dravid-Agarkar?s wives suffer as chaos reigns supreme

Birmingham: With all the Indian expats appearing to park themselves here, it turned chaotic in the lead-up to the India-Pakistan Champions Trophy face-off. 

Unusually for a Sunday, there were traffic snarls in the vicinity of Edgbaston, drivers broke rules with impunity, there was a scramble for parking space and, out in the city centre, taxis simply didn?t turn up at the official hotel ? Crowne Plaza. 

In fact, such was the despair there that Vijeta Dravid and Fatima Agarkar were among those who didn?t quite know what to do when no Black Cab reported despite a 9.15 booking. 

A courtesy pick-up? You?ve got to be joking: Such hospitality is only extended in the sub-continent. 

It?s not clear when Fatima and Vijeta actually made it to the ground, but one assumes they did in time for the fantastic 82-run seventh-wicket collaboration between their husbands. 

Edgbaston itself was overflowing, much beyond the official 21,000 capacity. And, at a conservative estimate, Team India fans held a 60-40 advantage. 

The irritating horns, though, largely belonged to Pakistani supporters. 

Fans, of course, came in a group ? six, eight, ten... One even encountered a 16-strong squad from London. ?We?re seeing it as a somewhat expensive fun outing,? remarked one among those Indians, interacting with The Telegraph at the Lazeez ?caravan?. 

The popular eatery was expecting a sell-out crowd, yes, but hadn?t prepared for the onion bhajis and veggie samosas (as also the Peshawari naan) disappearing within an hour. 

There?s a lesson for Lazeez; there?s going to be a lesson for the side finishing second-best in a match with nothing for the loser.

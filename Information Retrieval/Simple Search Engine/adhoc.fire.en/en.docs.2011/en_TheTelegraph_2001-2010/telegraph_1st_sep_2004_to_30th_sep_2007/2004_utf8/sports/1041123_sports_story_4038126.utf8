 Identical twins in Aussie squad 

Sydney: Australia?s on-field rivalry with India will resume next month as the country?s women?s cricket squad embarks on a seven-match one-day International tour of the subcontinent. 

Australia?s national selection panel for women on Monday named a 13-player squad for the series, starting from December 9. A unique feature of this squad is that it fields identical twins in Kate and Alex Blackwell, a Cricket Australia statement said on Monday. 

While Alex has eight one-day Internationals under her belt, twin sister Kate is yet to make her debut. 

If she does so on this tour, the pair will become the first twins to play women?s cricket for Australia.

Belinda Clark (captain), Karen Rolton (vice-captain), Alex Blackwell, Kate Blackwell, Leonie Coleman, Shelley Nitschke, Cathryn Fitzpatrick, Julie Hayes, Melanie Jones, Lisa Keightley, Clea Smith, Lisa Sthalekar, Emma Twining.

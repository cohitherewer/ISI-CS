 Nothing wrong with Harbhajan action: Murali 

 - Constant scrutiny of doosra could deter experimentation, feels star offie 

 Harbhajan 

 Sydney: Sri Lankan spin wizard Muttiah Muralidharan 

 does not think there is anything wrong in the way Indian 

 off-spinner Harbhajan Singh bowls his doosra, which 

 was reported as suspect by an ICC match referee this week. 

 ?With the naked eye, I can?t see anything wrong with 

 it. I don?t think there is a problem,? Murali was quoted 

 as saying in the Sydney Morning Herald, Wednesday. 

Harbhajan was reported to ICC by match referee Chris Broad on Monday for flexing his elbow beyond the ?levels of tolerance? when bowling the doosra, a delivery which spins away from right-handed batsmen. 

Murali also said he feared that constant scrutiny of spinners who bowl the doosra could deter young bowlers from experimenting with the delivery in future. 

?Definitely it could,? Murali said. ?If that happened, it would be a loss for the game. I don?t know what the thinking is with umpires and Match Referees with this ? it is obviously a very sensitive issue, because you are dealing with bowlers? careers. But I think (doosra) is good for the game.? 

Like Muralidharan earlier this year, Harbhajan will now have his action reviewed by a special committee over six weeks and, if necessary, work to straighten his action when bowling the doosra. 

Harbhajan, the sixth player to be cited for a suspect action this year, was reported by Broad and umpires Aleem Dar, Mark Benson and Mahbubur Rahman after the final day of the second Test between India and Bangladesh. 

 The reporting of Harbhajan comes at a time when the 

 ICC is expected to adopt new guidelines on suspect bowling 

 action at a meeting of the world?s chief executives in Melbourne 

 early next year. The existing limit for spinners is five 

 degrees, while medium pacers and pacemen are allowed to 

 extend their elbows by 7.5 and 10 degrees, respectively.

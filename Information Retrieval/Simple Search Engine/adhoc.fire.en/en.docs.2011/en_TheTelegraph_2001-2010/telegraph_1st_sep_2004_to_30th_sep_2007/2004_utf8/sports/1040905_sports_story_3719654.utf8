The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Mongia loses out, Rohan to stay on

 - Sachins replacement in Champions Trophy XIV 

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI 

 Rohan Gavaskar 

Calcutta: Despite an indirect show of no-confidence 

by the Team India thinktank, the national selectors have decided on Rohan Gavaskar 

being Sachin Tendulkars replacement in the XIV for the September 10-25 Champions 

Trophy. 

Of course, the thinktank didnt specifically say that 

Rohan shouldnt be the one. Equally, he wasnt specifically asked for, on Saturday 

afternoon. 

In fact, the thinktanks message to the Board (through manager Goutam Das Gupta) only spoke of picking a replacement. 

According to The Telegraphs sources, the general 

belief was that standby Dinesh Mongia (who has been excelling for Lancashire) 

would earn a recall after 17 months. 

However, Easts representative on the five-man selection committee, Pranab Roy, apparently quickly got into the act to ensure Rohan remained with Team India. 

Sachin, who has been troubled by a tennis elbow from before the tri-series in Holland, isnt going to be fit in the next fortnight as well. 

Pranab, one learns, contacted some colleagues and emphasised Rohan alone must not be made a scapegoat for a collective failure both in Holland and, thus far, in the NatWest Challenge and that a fair chance needed to be given. 

Obviously, his colleagues went along with that argument. 

[Significantly, according to an agency report from Mumbai, the Board was able to get the views of all selectors except Norths Kirti Azad, before announcing that Rohan the XVth player for the tri-series and the NatWest will stay on.] 

Bottomline, then, is that Rohan should be thankful to Pranab. 

Meanwhile, the Board has set the ball rolling for 

getting the International Cricket Councils approval on the replacement. Among 

other things, a doctors certificate (listing Sachins ailment) has been forwarded.

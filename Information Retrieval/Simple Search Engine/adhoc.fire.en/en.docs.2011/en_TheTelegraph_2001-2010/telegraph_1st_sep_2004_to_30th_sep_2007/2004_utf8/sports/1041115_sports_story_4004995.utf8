 Akram support for Muralidharan

 Akram 

Bangalore: Former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram said on Sunday that most bowlers do bend their arm a bit while bowling and maintained that one could not bowl with an absolutely straight arm. 

?I think most bowlers do bend a little bit of their arm. You can?t bowl a cricket ball with a straight arm?, he said. 

The legendary fast bowler made the comment when his reaction was sought on the ICC proposal that could allow Sri Lankan off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan to bowl his controversial doosra again. ?For me, Muralidharan has been a great bowler and I have never had any trouble with him. I don?t know what started to happen in the last couple of years. They just targetted Muralidharan... One particular guy?, he said. 

Muralidharan is the second-highest wicket taker in Test cricket with 532 scalps. 

Asked if he thought Australia?s domination over other teams would continue in near future, Akram said: ?looks like?. 

But Akram, who played 104 Tests claiming 414 wickets and scored 2,898 runs with a highest score of 257, believes it would be impossible for the current West Indies team to regain past glory. 

?Regaining past glory will be impossible. They were great players...Greatest ever (when West Indies dominated the world cricket). 

?The ICC Champions Trophy win has only given them confidence that they can win again against other teams,? he added. Akram, also the highest wicket-taker in ODIs with 502 scalps to his credit at an average of 23.5 in 356 matches, said becoming a coach was not on his mind right now. 

?Coaching needs specialised skills. You need to learn that. Great players are not (necessarily) great coaches. Right now I am enjoying life. May be I will think about it (coaching) a little later.?

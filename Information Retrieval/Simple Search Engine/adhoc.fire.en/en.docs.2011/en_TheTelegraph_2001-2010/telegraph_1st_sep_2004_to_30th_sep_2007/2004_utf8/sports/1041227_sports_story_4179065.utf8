 A star in days of cricket?s innocence 

 - Percy Chapman drew big crowds and got a measure of the Aussies 

 too 

 W.F. DEEDES 

 Even Bradman?s brilliance 

 failed to subdue Chapman 

 London: The winning streak 

 of ours in 1928-1929 that has just been surpassed will forever 

 be associated in my mind with Percy Chapman, the most talented 

 amateur of his generation, who took over England?s captaincy 

 in 1926. 

 I saw a lot of his cricket because 

 he lived in my hometown of Hythe and, being a man of the 

 utmost goodwill, occasionally turned out for the town side. 

 As a schoolboy, he had a remarkable 

 record at Uppingham, won his Cambridge Blue as a freshman, 

 played brilliantly for Kent and led England to a famous 

 victory in the final Test at the Oval in 1926, breaking 

 a long spell of Australian supremacy.

 Our cricket had taken time to 

 recover from the ravages of the First World War. So Chapman?s 

 spell of success was doubly welcome. It must be added that 

 in the late 1920s, he had a remarkably strong side. I can 

 remember by heart the batting order of the team we sent 

 to Australia in 1924-25: Hobbs, Sutcliffe, Hearne, Woolley, 

 Chapman, Hendren.

 Chapman drew big crowds because, 

 as a left-hand batsman, he was a tremendous hitter. He liked 

 to hit the ball very high and a fair proportion of his sixes 

 landed outside the ground. 

 He relished fast bowling. To watch 

 him and Frank Woolley, another left-hander, in full flow, 

 as I did once or twice at Canterbury Cricket Week, was a 

 treat. But his power of command, it always seemed to me, 

 came from the style in which he fielded. His favourite place 

 in the field was short leg or gully and always in exactly 

 the right spot. There, he would stop blinding shots without 

 seeming to move his body. 

 He had exceptionally quick reflexes 

 for a large man, and enormous hands. Having caught the ball 

 without moving, he would bluff everyone by looking round 

 to see where the ball had gone. 

 No wonder crowds loved him. He 

 was an actor as well as a very good cricketer and captain. 

 Good in adversity, too. The last 

 time I saw him play at Lord?s was against Australia in 1930. 

 The golden patch had just passed. Australia, on the prowl, 

 kept England toiling in the field for two days, compiling 

 more than 700 runs, with Woodfull and Bradman to the fore. 

 That would have flattened some 

 captains. Chapman responded by making a century. His greatest 

 achievement was following up the Oval victory in 1926 by 

 winning the first four Tests on Australian territory in 

 the winter of 1928-29 ? in Brisbane by 675 runs, in Sydney 

 by eight wickets, in Melbourne by three wickets and in Adelaide 

 by 12 runs.

 A pity that in those days, cricket 

 played in Australia was out of sight for almost everyone 

 in this country. Chapman starred in days of cricket?s innocence. 

 His time as captain was before apartheid made cricketing 

 relations with South Africa difficult and eventually impossible, 

 and before his successor, Douglas Jardine, had introduced 

 bodyline bowling to Australia. 

 As a brilliant amateur cricketer 

 who usually wore a broad smile, he made the game look thoroughly 

 enjoyable for both his team and the spectators. Perhaps 

 that is why he was so successful.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 3 more juniors banned 

Vijayawada: Three more athletes were Tuesday suspended from the national junior athletics championship after they were found to be overaged. 

Sunday 16 athletes had been suspended for the same reason. 

Cracking the whip to infuse discipline, the athletes ? K. Baskar of Andhra Pradesh, Parveen Anand and Senthivel of Tamil Nadu ? were suspended by the organisers for trying to take part in the championship in the lower age category. 

The action followed medical tests which confirmed that they were above their declared age. 

Baskar, who entered in the under-18 section, was suspended for six months while Praveen (u-18) and Senthivel (u-20) were suspended for two years each for the offence.

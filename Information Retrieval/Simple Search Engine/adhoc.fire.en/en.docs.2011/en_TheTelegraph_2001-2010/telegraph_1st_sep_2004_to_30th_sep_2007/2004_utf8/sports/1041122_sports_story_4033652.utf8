 Gilchrist, McMillan in war of words

Brisbane: Australia?s victory over New Zealand in the first Test on Sunday was soured by a row over sportsmanship. 

Tension between the teams spilled over when Australian wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist and New Zealand batsman Craig McMillan were involved in a heated exchange. 

Gilchrist claimed a catch off McMillan, but the New Zealand allrounder stood his ground and was given not out. The pair briefly argued with each other before umpires intervened. 

Television replays were inconclusive, but the incident immediately reopened the debate on cricketing ethics. 

Gilchrist has been an advocate of batsmen walking when they know they are out and has been true to his word, returning to the pavilion on a number of occasions even when the umpire has given him the benefit of the doubt. 

The Australian vice-captain has many admirers but few active supporters with the majority of batsmen preferring to leave the decision to the umpire. Some critics say Gilchrist is inadvertently putting pressure on opposing batsmen. 

New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming and Australian skipper Ricky Ponting discussed the issue privately after other incidents in the match when batsmen from both teams refused to walk. 

?Just because one or two guys are on a crusade it doesn?t mean it changes the way for 95 percent of other cricketers,? Fleming said. 

?We all like to see the game played in the best spirit but if individuals choose not to then that?s their right and they have to be respected for that. 

?As captain, I?m not going to put a blanket rule on my side that they must walk or must obey every gentlemanly word that?s said out there. It?s still international sport and some guys are playing for their livelihoods.? 

Ponting agreed with Fleming that it was up to individuals to decide, but said Gilchrist?s actions were not intended to put pressure on opposing players to follow suit. 

?We?ve got one player who has come out and said he?s going to be a walker now. It doesn?t put pressure on anybody else, it doesn?t change anything else whatsoever,? Ponting said. 

?Adam doesn?t expect it of anybody else. He doesn?t expect it of our team either.?

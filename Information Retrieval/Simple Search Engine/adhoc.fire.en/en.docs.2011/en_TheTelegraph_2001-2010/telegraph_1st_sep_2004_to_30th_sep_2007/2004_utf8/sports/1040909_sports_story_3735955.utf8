 Martin arrested, released on bail

Vadodara: India discard and Baroda Ranji Trophy captain Jacob Martin, who was arrested by the police for allegedly breaking Gujarat?s prohibition law on Tuesday and released on bail, pleaded he was innocent of the charges slapped against him. 

?I am innocent. I had gone to attend a friend?s funeral (at Kohar Mohalla in Navapura area of the city) last evening. 

?I was sitting in a small room in the adjoining flat with three other friends. We were waiting for the funeral procession to start, when the police raided the room, found a liquor bottle and we got arrested,? Martin told PTI. 

?I told the police that I don?t drink, but to no avail,? Martin said adding that none of the four arrested persons were later tested for alcohol in their breath, nor were their blood samples tested. The 32-year-old has represented India in ten one-day Internationals between 1999 and 2001, scoring 158 runs with 39 as his higest score. (PTI)

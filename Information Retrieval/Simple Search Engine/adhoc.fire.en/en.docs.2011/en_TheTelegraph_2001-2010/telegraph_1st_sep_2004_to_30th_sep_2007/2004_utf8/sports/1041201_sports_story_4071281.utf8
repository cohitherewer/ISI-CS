 Adelaide: Olympic 100m freestyle gold medallist Jodie Henry has been named Australia?s swimmer of the year, upstaging Ian Thorpe. Jodie picked up three golds in Athens, setting a world record in the 100 freestyle semi-finals and anchoring the victorious Australian 4x100 freestyle and 4x100 medley relay teams.

 ?I honestly couldn?t have predicted it was going to be me,? the 21-year-old said after her award was announced at a ceremony in Melbourne on Monday night. ?I won three gold medals but I had other girls help me get two of them.?

 Thorpe retained his 400 freestyle title in Athens and also captured the 200 freestyle gold. He won the Australian swimmer of the year award every year between 1999 and 2003, sharing the honours with 1,500 freestyle world champion Grant Hackett last year. 

 London: The story of Basil d?Oliveira?s life as a South African-born cricketer during apartheid won Britain?s sports book of the year award. Basil d?Oliveira: Cricket and controversy, by Peter Oborne, won the 15th edition of the prize, sponsored by British bookmaker William Hill. Oborne, political editor for The Spectator magazine, won ?15,000.

 D?Oliveira, of mixed race, was born and raised in South Africa but denied the chance to play for the country because of apartheid. He moved to England where he went on to play 44 Tests.

 Buenos Aires: Argentina?s Carlos Tevez is set to join Corinthians of Brazil after Boca Juniors agreed on Monday to transfer the forward for close to $20 million, a director of the Argentine club said.

 ?We?re going to sign a letter of intent. It?s $18 million for 80 per cent of the (player?s) registration plus one and a half million in transfer costs. Tevez says there is no question that he wants to go,? Boca vice-president Pedro Pompilio said.

 Mexico City: The president of Mexican first division club Veracruz has been banned for six months after his team boycotted a match because they said it was too hot. 

 Veracruz, who are based in the tropical port of the same name, failed to turn up for their home game against Chiapas earlier this month after Rafael Herrerias said the midday kickoff time made it too hot play.

 Temperatures out of the shade can reach 40 Celsius at their Luis Fuente stadium. Chiapas were awarded a 2-0 walkover win and Veracruz were also fined the equivalent of an average home gate which is approximately 2,247,750 pesos ($198,000).

 The ban means that Herrerias cannot enter the playing area or changing rooms or sign documents on behalf of the club.

 London: Leeds United, one of the great names in English soccer, have denied they are negotiating a possible sale of the second division club to British businessman Sebastian Sainsbury. Sainsbury had made a formal purchase offer earlier in the day but Leeds United chairman Gerald Krasner said the Yorkshire club were still discussing a proposed investment by a ?local? consortium.

 ?The negotiations with the local consortium of Leeds United fans are progressing well and the board hope they will come to fruition within the next seven to 10 days, at which time a further statement will be made,? Krasner said in a statement.

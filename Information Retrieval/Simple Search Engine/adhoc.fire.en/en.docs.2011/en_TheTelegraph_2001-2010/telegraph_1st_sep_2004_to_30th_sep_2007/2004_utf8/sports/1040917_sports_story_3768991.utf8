The Telegraph - Calcutta

 EB protest sent to AFC

 - DISALLOWED GOAL 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: East Bengal sent a letter to the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) on Wednesday, protesting the referee?s decision to disallow Bijen Singh?s goal during the AFC Cup quarter final home match against Syrian outfit Al Jaish. 

Uzbek referee, Lutfullin Nail had first allowed the goal scored by Bijen, but later overturned his decision citing a foul on the Syrian goalkeeper. 

The move sparked protest and East Bengal officials handed an official complaint to match commissioner Mahesh Bista. The officials also drew the commissioner?s notice to the delay tactics employed by the Syrian team while taking the field after the breather. 

The team entered the ground seven minutes late after the lemon break. The officials have also forwarded a copy of their protest letter to the All India Football Federation. 

Meanwhile, the team will leave for Damascus on Saturday. The return leg will be held on Wednesday. 

Douglas da Silva, who had a good game in the home leg despite injury, is expected to be fully fit when the team lands in Damascus.

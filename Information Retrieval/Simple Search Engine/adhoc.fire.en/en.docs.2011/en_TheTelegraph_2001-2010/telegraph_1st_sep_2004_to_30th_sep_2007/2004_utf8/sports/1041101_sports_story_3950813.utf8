 India to host 2005 meet

Mallorca: India will host the next World Team Chess championship, the second-biggest team event after the Olympiad, while their men?s team qualified for the event after finishing sixth in the 36th Chess Olympiad here. 

All India Chess Federation (AICF) secretary P. T. Ummer Koya confirmed that the decision to allot the event to AICF was taken during the Fide Congress held after the event. 

?The dates and venue are not yet finalised but most likely it will be held in September or October (next year),? Koya said. In the world team meet, top eight teams from the Olympiad, the winners of women?s section and the host federation get a seat each which makes it a fairly tough team event. The format is simple as all teams play each other once to determine the winner. (PTI)

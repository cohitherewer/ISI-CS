 Compassionate canters home 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Saturday was expected to be a bad day for punters and it turned out to be so. The lone favourite Calescet who delivered the goods for trainer Vijay Singh?s stable, albeit at the poor odds of 55-100, could not have brought solace to the battered racegoers. Punters witnessed the fall of favourites one after another to their discomfiture.

 Vijay?s heavily-fancied Averroes set the day?s trend in the opener, a baby race, which was lifted by Daniel David-trainee Pure Valour. However, a bigger shock awaited punters when Errol Bhungard?s even-money fancy Dream Sovereign refused to leave the stall. 

 Punters? nightmare continued as trainer Bharath Singh?s half-money rage, Accuser, ran like a dud in the main event, the 2,000m Maharajadhiraja Uday Chand Mahtab of Burdwan Memorial Cup. The poor performance of the favourite allowed Javed Khan?s 4-1 chance Compassionate win the trophy unchallenged in the hands of Mark Reuben.

 However, luck also eluded Bharath in the BSF Trophy when his Azinger narrowly failed to catch up with the winner A?Ma Jaju who led a merry dance from the start but shortened her strides in the last furlong. In the following event, the Oakmead Handicap, Bharath?s joint-favourites, Aneroid and Deeqa, also met with a similar fate when the stable?s long-priced horse, Followme, decided to down the fancied runners. Finally, there was Errol?s Midas Touch who delivered day?s the biggest blow in the Flying Saucer Handicap.

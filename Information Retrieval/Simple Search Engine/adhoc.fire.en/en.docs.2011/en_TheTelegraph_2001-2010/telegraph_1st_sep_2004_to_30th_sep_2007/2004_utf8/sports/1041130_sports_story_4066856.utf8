The Telegraph - Calcutta

 No point trying to control the uncontrollables: Dravid 

 - I know I want to be an achiever... Want to be the best I?m capable of, says Team India vice-captain 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: Team India vice-captain Rahul Dravid is into his sixth Test this season, but hasn?t yet added to 17 hundreds. Hopefully, No.18 isn?t far off. Dravid, who usually steers clear of interviews, made another exception for The Telegraph and spoke for over half-an-hour on the eve of the ongoing Test. 

The following are excerpts 

Q For somebody so consistent, this hasn?t been a stand-out season... 

A It?s a small phase where I haven?t matched the standards particularly set in the last 24 months... The desire has been there, but I realise there will be times when the runs may dry up... I?ve been working hard and doing the same things when runs came off my bat in a big way. I realise I?ve got to fight my way out of this. 

What brings about consistency? 

Being in the right frame of mind as that gives the best chance to succeed... I?ve said ?chance? because, no matter what you do, success isn?t guaranteed. Then, the preparation makes a difference and nothing must be left to chance... Even if you?ve got a hundred in the last game, the next is a fresh one... A new start... (After a pause) It?s important to know what you can control... There?s no point trying to control the uncontrollables. 

Have your high standards added to the pressure? 

(Smiles) The expectations are high, but I would like to achieve the standards... In fact, trying to meet expectations is something which drives me... However, I disagree with the pressure bit. I didn?t, after all, begin this season thinking I have to get the number of runs I got in 2003-04. 

Why haven?t you got big runs this season? 

I?ve had a few long innings, but haven?t been able to kick on from there... Perhaps, the wickets (at home) have had a bearing... Some definitely haven?t been easy, hampering getting runs freely... Yet, within me, I know I want to be an achiever... Want to do better than last season... Want to be the best I?m capable of... 

Did the two most prized ICC awards (Player of the Year and Test Player of the Year) in September raise the level of pressure? 

But the awards, essentially, were for last season... Frankly, I didn?t think about them once the ceremony finished... In any case, that season ended with the Rawalpindi Test... It has gone and is buried... The past, the averages... They become irrelevant... Surely, I want to do well whether or not I win awards. 

Have you, in any way, attempted to prepare differently? 

I haven?t tried to... Obviously, if there?s a flaw, I?m going to correct it. (Adds laughing) Even when successful, I didn?t do anything different. 

Unfortunately, the team hasn?t got many big scores either... 

There?s a co-relation between the top order doing well and the team doing well... The key batsmen, specially, should make significant contributions. 

The No.3 slot means you?ve got to be ready to face the very second ball... 

Mentally, I?m always prepared... It?s nice if the team gets a good start, but I?m ready to be there on the second ball. 

Well, the past 13 months have seen you captain India both in Tests and ODIs. What has it been like? 

Look, I haven?t done the job over a length of time... Because of the circumstances, it has always been on-off. 

Still, what have you learnt? 

It?s difficult to pinpoint... Generally, though, I?ve learnt to handle situations... I?ve grown in confidence as I now know what I?m capable of handling... I?ve also learnt things about the team, learnt about myself. 

Coincidence or not, you haven?t scored big whenever you?ve been captain... 

Well, you could look at the statistics and pass a judgement... But, then, that must ideally be done after I?ve had the job over a period of time... Right now, I wouldn?t myself take a call on whether captaincy affects my batting. 

Have you been different in the dressing room each time that you?ve been captain? 

(Smiles again) You?ve got to ask the boys... There are more responsibilities, but I?ve tried not to be different... How have I operated? I?ve sought the seniors? help, but the decisions have been mine. 

What?s captaincy all about? 

I don?t wish to pontificate... However, whether one is leading a cricket team or an organisation, one has to do so by example... I can?t comment on the pulls and pressures faced by an Indian captain as I haven?t been in the job for any length of time. 

Recently, Sourav Ganguly received a hit from sections of the Media... As you may yourself one day become the full-time captain, are you worried about what?s in store? 

Whatever happens is a reflection of the times... There?s this tendency to praise excessively... Like labelling us No.2, after Australia... Then, after a few defeats, we?re informed we can?t even play! Given that India is ruled by emotions, this swing will happen... There?s bound to be a lot of hype... Sometimes the hype works for you, at other times, it doesn?t. One has to get used to it... It has to be dealt with, individually and collectively. 

Have you regarded somebody as a role model captain? 

I?ve learnt from all three captains I played under: Mohammed Azharuddin, Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav. I?ve admired each one for different qualities... (After a pause) Steve Waugh and Nasser Hussain made a big impact; Stephen Fleming still does... My favourite, though, is Mark Taylor. 

What made Taylor stand out? 

The way he led from the front; the way he carried himself... 

Today, what gives you more satisfaction ? the win in Multan or the one in Mumbai (versus Australia)? 

(Pauses) Both, in their own way, are satisfying... The one in Multan is always going to be remembered as our first in Pakistan... In a lot of ways, that was a classical Test win... The one in Mumbai will be special because we won after scoring a mere 104 in the first innings. Moreover, we bowled Australia out for 93. Our boys showed so much character, they responded so well. 

What, in your opinion, are the reasons for Australia?s continuing success? 

A quality infrastructure, at all levels... Quality players... Quality wickets... Quality practice wickets... Quality coaching... Really, the organisation is fantastic and, so, Australian cricket stays the benchmark. 

Talking of wickets, shouldn?t there be a pre-season meeting between the team management and curators of the grounds to host Tests and ODIs? 

I don?t think so... Curators are there to prepare wickets, players are there to play... Of course, good wickets must be prepared... The basic nature of wickets can?t change and, in any case, how is anybody to predict how one is going to behave? Like us, players, curators are human and nature can?t be controlled. Preparing wickets isn?t a science, is it? The problem in India is that everybody is an expert. 

But wasn?t the team upset by the Nagpur wicket? 

I accept it suited Australia?s strength more than ours but, at the end of the day, it was a good cricket wicket. The point I made, after we lost, is that it would be great if such wickets were offered at the domestic level, particularly for the colts. 

As a batsman, are you confused about what?s a legitimate delivery and what isn?t? 

No... I?m happy, though, that people are talking about the issue and putting their minds to it... On the field, the umpires are there to enforce the law. 

Are you pleased with the growing use of technology for umpires? 

At the moment, it?s a happy medium... If technology can help reach the right decision, it should be embraced. Point to be noted is that technology keeps improving... 

Finally, are you hopeful of repeating the December 2003-April 2004 phase? 

(Laughs) Yes... Like I?ve said, I?ve been spending time at the wicket and, as this season isn?t ending right now, there will be opportunities to convert time into runs... It?s always nice to have runs in the bag and it helps to be high on confidence.

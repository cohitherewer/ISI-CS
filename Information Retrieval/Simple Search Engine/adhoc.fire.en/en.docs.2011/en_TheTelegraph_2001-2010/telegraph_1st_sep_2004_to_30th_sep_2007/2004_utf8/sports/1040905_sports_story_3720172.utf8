Roger Federer hit top form on Saturday as he outplayed 

Frenchman Fabrice Santoro 6-0, 6-4, 7-6 to reach the fourth round.

New York: Defending champion Andy Roddick kept 

the home flag flying at the US Open on Friday, but it was a bad day for his compatriots 

as only two American men reached the third round, their worst showing in tournament 

history. 

Juan Carlos Ferrero and David Nalbandian were both beaten, while Lleyton Hewitt continued to impress but the best was saved for last as Roddick served up another awesome display under the lights at Flushing Meadow. Second seed Roddick was at his most ruthless on Arthur Ashe Court as he beat Spanish teenager Rafael Nadal 6-0, 6-3, 6-4 in a second round match. 

Roddick equalled his own US Open record for the fastest serve with a 152mph bullet and such was the venom of his delivery that Nadal twice found himself on the floor after taking evasive action. 

A loss of concentration at the start of the third set allowed the Spaniard back into the match with an early break, but Roddick broke back for 4-4 and then repeated the feat two games later to clinch victory. I felt like I played really well for the first two sets, Roddick said. I kind of had a concentration lapse at the start of the third set but I was able to come through in the end. 

Roddicks victory was the only highlight for home fans in the mens event as Vince Spadea (23) and Jan-Michael Gambill were beaten. 

Sixth seed and two-time champion Andre Agassi is the only other American left standing. 

Elsewhere, former champion Lleyton Hewitt bristled, battled and eventually blossomed on his way to a 7-6, 6-1, 6-2 victory over Moroccan Hicham Arazi. Hewitt, who came into the tournament with back-to-back wins in Washington and Long Island, shrugged off a warning for ball abuse in the first set to overcome his tricky opponent. 

Ferrero said he wanted to forget 2004 after he was beaten 6-7, 6-4, 7-6, 2-6, 3-6 by Austrias Stefan Koubek. 

The seventh-seeded Spaniard suffered with an adductor injury at the end of the third set and Koubek took advantage to secure the win. 

Since reaching the semi-finals of the Australian Open in January, Ferrero has struggled with illness and injury and was beaten in the French Open second round and the third at Wimbledon. He has yet to win a title in 2004. It is (more) frustrating than you can imagine, Ferrero said. I dont think I have played a tournament this year at 100 percent fit. 

While Ferreros defeat was not totally unexpected, comeback kid Tommy Haas upset the formbook when he beat 12th seed Sebastien Grosjean. 

The German former world number two, who missed the whole of last season after shoulder surgery, came through 6-4, 6-4, 1-6, 6-1 to set up a third-round meeting with Brazilian qualifier Ricardo Mello. Eighth seed Nalbandian became the second-highest seed to go out when he was beaten in five sets by Russian Mikhail Youzhny. 

Elsewhere, Serena Williams, Amelie Mauresmo and Jennifer Capriati maintained order in the womens event by reaching the fourth round. Third seed Williams opened the evening session in slightly more modest fashion than in her opening two matches, with the yellow low-cut shorts of French 16-year-old Tatiana Golovin putting the American in the shade. 

Williamss game was also far from shining as she made 42 unforced errors, having to dig deep to come from 1-4 down in the first set on her way to a 7-5, 6-4 victory. Second seed Mauresmo stormed into the fourth round with a 6-2, 6-0 demolition of Venezuelas Maria Vento-Kabchi. 

Capriati won the first set in 17 minutes against Vera Douchevina, but the Russian pushed the eighth seed hard before going down 0-6, 7-6, 3-6. 

Russias women continued to progress, with sixth seed Elena Dementieva and 10th seed Vera Zvonareva setting up a fourth-round showdown. But there was disappointment for American teenager Angela Haynes, when she was beaten 3-6, 6-7 by 16th seed Francesca Schiavone of Italy. 

Paes-Rikl in quarters 

Leander Paes and David Rikl advanced to the pre-quarter finals for a thrilling showdown with the worlds top doubles players and reigning champions Todd Woodbridge and Jonas Bjorkman. Paes and Rikl, seeded 13, snuffed out Yves Allegro of Switzerland and Germanys Michael Kohlmann 6-2, 7-6 (7-5) in the second-round match on Friday. 

Mahesh Bhupathi and his new partner Lisa Raymond (US) won their first-round mixed doubles match comfortably on Friday. 

The third seeds beat Hungarian Petra Mandula and Australian Paul Hanley 6-4, 6-2 and they will now play Australian sensation Alicia Molick and her compatriot Woodbridge in the second round.

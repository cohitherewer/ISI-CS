 Azhar backs Sourav move

Dubai: Sourav Ganguly?s decision to ask Yuvraj Singh to open the innings in place of specialist Akash Chopra may have raised quite a few eyebrows, but former captain Mohammed Azharuddin has lauded the move saying such changes were the need of the hour. 

?People are criticising Ganguly, but tell me where did Chopra score runs? Yuvraj can score and score quickly. Sometimes you need to change the planning. Changes are needed. Yuvraj didn?t score this time, but the planning was perfect,? Azharuddin was quoted as saying in a local daily on Sunday. 

But Azhar had a word of caution for the Punjab player, as also for Virender Sehwag. 

?Yuvraj has to be told on Indian wickets, you have to go forward rather than wait for the ball. Sehwag played well here, but he has to learn that he can?t always play in top gear.? (PTI)

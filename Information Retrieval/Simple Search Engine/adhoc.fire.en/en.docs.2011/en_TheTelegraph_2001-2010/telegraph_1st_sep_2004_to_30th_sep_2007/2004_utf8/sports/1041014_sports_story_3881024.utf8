 Camp is upbeat: Sourav 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

Chennai: Sourav Ganguly feels that too much should not be read into the Bangalore defeat and the team has the capability to bounce back in the current series. 

?It?s just a matter of one Test. We realise the importance of the rest of the series. We have been in such circumstances before and there?s no reason why we cannot repeat the same this time around. The mood in the side going into the second Test is quite upbeat,? the Team India captain said on Wednesday. 

?The players should be positive and confident of their capabilities. The batsmen have been hugely successful against high quality fast bowling previously and on better surfaces. So?? he added. 

He does not believe the absence of Sachin Tendulkar will have a demoralising effect on the side. ?The team is definitely going to miss him. The injury is such that it takes time to heal. We?ll miss him, but what to do? It?s now for the rest to stand up and deliver.? 

Sourav sounded a bit cautious on Sachin?s chances of playing the third Test in Nagpur from October 26. ?The physio (Andrew Leipus) says that he must be comfortable, in that his symptoms should be stiffness and not pain, and that he must have full function of the elbow and wrist. We can only hope that it happens quickly.? 

The arrival of Sunil Gavaskar is working well for the side, says Sourav. ?He?s helping the team out and is working together with coach John Wright. We?ve had a bowling coach in the past. So we?ve decided to go in with a batting specialist this time.? 

 The weather factor 

Meanwhile, the heat here during the daytime might pose problems for the visitors. Adam Gilchrist, however, seemed to have come well prepared. ?It?s obviously more demanding physically. We?ve played a lot in tropical climes and in the sub-continent. We understand the significance and expect it to be tough. Hopefully we?ll be ready to handle such circumstances.? 

It might prompt the Aussies to use ice-vests. ?We?ve used them before in these conditions. It?s an individual thing and not a team policy,? the stand-in captain clarified.

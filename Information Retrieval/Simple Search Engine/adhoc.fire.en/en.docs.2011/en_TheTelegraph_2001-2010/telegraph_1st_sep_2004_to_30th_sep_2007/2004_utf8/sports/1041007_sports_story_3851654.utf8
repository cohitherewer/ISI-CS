 Prime Contender strikes 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: The soft underfoot conditions of the track following heavy rains, failed to stop the three-year-olds Calorific and Sparkling Clear from recording easy wins in their respective events on Wednesday. The two hot-favourite youngsters, were making their debut on the monsoon track.

 The day?s main event, the 1,100m Unknown Warrior Cup, too, saw a strongly fancied Prime Contender coming good on a murky afternoon. In her last start, the Young Senor-Prima Donna mare from trainer Javed Khan?s yard had failed as a favourite after she bled from the nostrils. After a slow start, Mark Reuben got the best out of her to beat speedster Common Spirit and course-favourite Smart Charmer.

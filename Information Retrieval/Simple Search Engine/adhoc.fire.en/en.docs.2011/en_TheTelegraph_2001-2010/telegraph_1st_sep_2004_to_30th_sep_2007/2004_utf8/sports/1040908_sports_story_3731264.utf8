 India bow out of U-17 AFC Cup

New Delhi: India on Tuesday suffered their second successive defeat and went out of contention in the AFC under-17 football meet being played in Shizuoka, Japan. 

Indian colts, who lost their opening group C encounter against Iran on Sunday, paid for some sloppy defence to go down 1-2 to Kuwait at the Nihondaira Stadium, according to information received here. 

India, with a game against Malaysia to go, have no chance of making it to the quarter finals. 

Iran booked their berth in the last eight with a thumping 5-0 win over Malaysia while Kuwait, with four points, now need a draw against Iran on Thursday for a place in the knockout stage. 

Desperate to secure full points to keep hopes alive, India went for the kill against Kuwait. They could have at least split points but for a defensive lapse two minutes from time. The defenders misread a pass from the left and an unmarked Fadhel ensured that the Indians pay for the mistake with a clinical finish. 

Kuwait had taken the lead through Al Jaser in the 58th minute and India restored parity eight minutes later via Hnamte Laltanpuia.

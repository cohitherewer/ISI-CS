The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Black Caps in command

Dhaka: New Zealand wicketkeeper Brendon McCullum completed his maiden Test century to help his team amass a 225-run lead over Bangladesh on the third day of the first Test on Thursday. 

In reply to Bangladesh?s 177, New Zealand compiled 402 in their first innings with McCullum contributing 143. 

Left-arm spinner Daniel Vettori then took two quick wickets to reduce the home side to 41 for two at close. 

McCullum was ably assisted by the tailenders after New Zealand resumed on 207 for five. After Jacob Oram?s departure for a well-made 23, Vettori (23), James Franklin (23), Paul Wiseman (28) and Ian Butler (15 not out) kept Bangladesh at bay until just after the tea interval. 

Left-arm spinner Mohammad Rafique was the most successful bowler for the hosts with six for 122, his fourth five-wicket haul in Tests. 

McCullum again came to the fore during Bangladesh second innings, catching Javed Omar off Vettori for 14. Vettori followed it up by holding a return catch to dismiss Hannan Sarkar for one. 

Rookie Nafis Iqbal, 19, was batting on 24 with Rajin Saleh yet to score at stumps. 

Rafique took his 50th wicket in his 13th Test match with an average of 30.26, since his debut in Bangladesh?s inaugural Test against India at the Bangabandhu National Stadium in 2000. 

He had Oram caught at first slip by fellow spinner Manjurul Islam. It was his fourth wicket and Islam?s second catch. 

Islam then removed Daniel Vettori (23), caught by Nafis Iqbal at forward short leg, after adding only one run to his unbeaten 22 at lunch. 

Next to go was James Franklin (23) caught by Rajin Saleh at square leg off a Tapash Baishya delivery.

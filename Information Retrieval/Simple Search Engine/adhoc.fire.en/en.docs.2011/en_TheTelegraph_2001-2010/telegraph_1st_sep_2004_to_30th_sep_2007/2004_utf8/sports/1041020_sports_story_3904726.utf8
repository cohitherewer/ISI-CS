 Ponting eyes Mumbai return

 Ponting?s thumb is healing well 

Sydney: Australia?s injured captain Ricky Ponting is targeting a return for the fourth and final Test against India next month. 

?Today?s X-rays confirmed that his thumb is healing well, and he is hopeful of being fit for the fourth Test in Mumbai which starts on November 3,? Cricket Australia (CA) said in a statement on Tuesday. 

The 29-year-old batsman fractured his left thumb while fielding at slip during last month?s Champions Trophy semi-final defeat by hosts England. 

Ponting was ruled out of the third Test in Nagpur after further x-rays in Sydney last week. ?We are hopeful that he will be fit for the final Test of the series,? team doctor Trefor James said on Tuesday. 

Ponting told a news conference in Sydney he was not certain he would be passed fit for the fourth Test. ?But with the way things have proceeded over the last few days there is certainly a high chance of that (his return) happening,? he said. 

?(If it was the) bottom hand thumb, they might have been able to target me. But I don?t mind them trying to bowl a few short balls on those wickets over there,? added Ponting.

 Indian men sweep past Costa Rica

 - CHESS OLYMPIAD 

- Humpy, Mohota guide eves to win over Cuba 

 Anand registered an emphatic win over Ramirez 

Mallorca: The Indian men beat Costa Rica 3.5-0.5 in the second-round match of the 36th Chess Olympiad here on Saturday (as reported in Sunday?s Late City edition). 

With the win, India took their tally to a respectable 6 points out of a possible 8 and even though they remain two points behind early leaders like Ukraine and Czech Republic, it turned out to be a far better day than the first round when the fifth seeds could muster just 2.5 points out of 4. 

After Viswanathan Anand gave the team an early lead, defeating Costa Rica GM Alejandro Ramirez, K. Sasikiran overcame Gonzalez Bernal, P. Harikrishna was too good for Valdes Leonardo and Surya Sekhar Ganguly split points with Francisco Hernandez. 

Anand, in whose absence the Indian team could manage only a 2.5-1.5 victory over Uruguay in the first round game, gave an emphatic display to outplay Ramirez from the white side of a French defence game. The victory came in almost no time as the game ended in just under two hours time. 

Earlier, Indian men were off to an average start over unfancied Uruguay in the opening round. The Indian women, in contrast, were off to a flying start, scoring a crushing 2.5-0.5 victory over Mexico in the first round. 

Sasikiran and Kunte were held to draws with black pieces, while P. Harikrishna had to split points with the favourable colour in the men?s fray. Sandipan Chanda defeated Alejandro Bauza in a finely crafted game to gain full points. 

 In women?s second-round action, GM Koneru Humpy and WGM Nisha Mohota scored their second straight victories over Cuban opponents and guided the Indian team to another 2.5-0.5 triumph. 

 Germany, Kazakhstan and Latvia emerged joint leaders with 6 points from as many games in this 14-round event. 

As many as six teams ? top seeds China, The Netherlands, Vietnam, Slovenia, Sweden and Russia share second spot with 5.5 points apiece, while the Indian eves are in third place with Bulgaria, Serbia-Montenegro, Poland, United States and Hungary. 

Humpy overpowered Arribas Maritza from the black pieces, while on the second board, Dronavalli Harika opened her Olympiad score after settling for a draw with Marrero Yaniet. Nisha had to work very hard to get the better of Vivian Ramon on the third board. 

In other important games of the day, Kachiani G. Ketino of Germany scored quite easily over Irina Berezina of Austria. On the second board, Jessika Niel got the better of Arianne Caoili, while Tina Mietzner did the damage against Anastesia Sorokina. 

Defending champions China brushed aside Kyrgystan. On the top board World Cup champion Xu Yuhua accounted for Greta Lim, Zhao Xue outclassed Janyl Tilenbaeva on the second, while Huang Qian proved too strong for Baktygul Tilenbaev on the last board.

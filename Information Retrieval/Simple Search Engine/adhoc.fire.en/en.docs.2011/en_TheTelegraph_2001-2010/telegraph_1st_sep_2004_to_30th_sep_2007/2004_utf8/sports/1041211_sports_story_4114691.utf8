 Jyoti?s lead pruned

New Delhi: India?s Jyoti Randhawa continued to lead on the second day with a two-under par 70 after the second round of the Masters of Asia golf championship in Kuala Lumpur Friday. 

Randhawa opened strongly but stumbled on the back nine with three bogeys and a birdie at the Kota Permai Golf and Country Club. The Indian?s effort Friday earned him a two-day total of 11-under-par 133. 

China?s Liang Wenchong (67) and Taiwans Wang Ter-Chang (66) exploited Randhawa?s misfortune to narrow the Indian?s lead by two strokes, according to a press release issued here. (PTI)

Madrid: Barcelona held off newcomers Getafe to claim a 2-1 win and cement their hold on the top of the Primera Liga on Saturday. 

The Catalans went 2-0 up at the break thanks to a fiercely struck free-kick from Mexican international Rafael Marquez and a superb strike from Portugal midfielder Deco. 

But they had to endure a nervous half hour after Gica Craioveanu pulled a goal back for Getafe early in the second half. The win puts Frank Rijkaard?s side nine points clear of fellow Catalans Espanyol at the top of the table. 

Espanyol?s former Barca striker Dani scored a second-half double ? including one from the penalty spot ? to give them a 2-1 win over Atletico Madrid that allowed Miguel Angel Lotina?s side to continue their impressive start to the season. 

Athletic Bilbao eased concerns about their poor start to the season when they cruised to a classy 3-0 win over Racing Santander, a result that pushed them up to 12th place, four points clear of the relegation zone. 

A delightful chip from Santi Ezquerro and a neat header from fellow midfielder Carlos Gurpegi made it 2-0 at the break, while centre-forward Ismael Urzaiz wrapped up the win in the second half with his eighth goal of the season with a trademark header. 

Barcelona took the lead from a set piece in the 20th minute, Marquez scoring with a scorching 25-metre free-kick after Ronaldinho had diverted attention with a decoy run across the face of the area. 

Getafe were still dusting themselves down when Barca hit them again with a superbly worked goal after a lightning counter-attack. 

Ronaldinho set Xavi free down the left flank with a smart back-heeled pass and the midfielder outpaced three defenders before cutting the ball back to Deco who fired in on the half-volley from the edge of the area. 

Getafe refused to wilt and Craioveanu pulled a goal back when he pounced on a miscued clearance from Carles Puyol just before the hour. 

But their comeback was cut short seven minutes from time when Craioveanu was dismissed for some shirt pulling on Deco as he raced towards the area. 

AS Roma ended a run of four defeats with a 4-0 win at Siena in Serie A with two goals each from Vincenzo Montella and Francesco Totti. 

Udinese took a firm grip on third place by picking up their fourth successive away win with a 2-1 victory at Livorno to move five points clear of fourth-placed Messina. 

Roma?s game at Siena was held up for over 20 minutes in the first half when smoke bombs thrown by fans reduced visibility so much that the referee was forced to take the players off. 

Udinese opened the scoring in the 13th minute with a beautifully worked move finished off in style by Vincenzo Iaquinta, who fired home a powerful shot on the turn. 

Livorno almost equalised when their big striker Cristiano Lucarelli had a firm header well saved by Morgan De Sanctis. But nine minutes after the break the visitors doubled their lead. 

Giampiero Pinzi headed down a Marek Jankulovski corner and David Di Michele pounced to fire home amid protests from Livorno players that he had handled the ball. 

Livorno pulled a goal back in the 65th minute through a perfectly taken curling 20 metre free-kick from Lucarelli. 

Bayern Munich strengthened their grip at the top of the Bundesliga with a 4-2 victory at home to FSV Mainz as faltering Wolfsburg went down 3-2 at home to Hertha Berlin. 

Bayern?s sixth win in their last seven league games gave them 32 points from 15 games and took them five clear of second-placed Schalke 04 and Wolfsburg, who drop to third.

 Anand boosts India?s chances

 - CHESS OLYMPIAD - Sasikiran?s form a slight concern 

 Anand has hit a purple patch 

Mallorca: Fielding teams in both sections (men and women) for the first time, India would look to benefit from the presence of Viswanathan Anand in their ranks when the 36th edition of the Chess Olympiad starts here on Friday. 

There are quite a few firsts this time around and the most notable of them is Anand?s participation in a team event representing the country. 

This would be the first time that India will field an all-Grandmaster team and the first time that Koneru Humpy will be a part of the women?s squad. 

The Indian think tank has done its homework for the event as is evident from the fortnight-long training camp at Calicut just before the Olympiad. Prior to that, a category-16 event was organised in Pune to facilitate the preparation of the men?s team. 

There are, however, no surprises in board order of both the men?s and women?s teams. 

Anand is a natural choice for the top board and Krishnan Sasikiran will be on the second board. P. Harikrishna will master the third, while national champion Surya Shekhar Ganguly, former British Open champion Abhijit Kunte and Sandipan Chanda will follow him on board 4-6. 

Among the women, it is a similar order with GM Humpy slated to lead the team followed by S. Vijayalakshmi, Dronavalli Harika and Nisha Mohota. 

Exotic locales, the best in business in fray and cherished medals at stake ? probably the players could not have asked for more as they fight for supremacy over the next few days. 

The men?s team seems to be in fine fettle with Anand hitting a purple patch in his career. 

This year, Anand has won the Corus Super GMs tournament, the rapid section of Amber Blindfold and Rapid tournament, the Dortmund Sparkassen chess meeting and the Chess Classics at Mainz. He has also led the world team to a victory over players with Armenian connections in a tight match. 

Sasikiran?s form could be a slight concern but past has shown that he comes out firing on all cylinders. His mediocre show at the Pune GM tourney could just augur well for India. 

From the team?s perspective, the third and fourth boards are very important as vital points could be gained here. 

Harikrishna has it in him to beat the best on his day. Also the Hyderabad-based player is in top form as his third place finish at Pune indicated. 

It was a remarkable show by him especially against former world championship semi-finalist Liviu-Dieter Nisipeanu of Romania who suffered his only loss in the event at the hands of Harikrishna. 

According to chess pundits, Surya Sekhar is one solid player who has very clear ideas. His national championship victory did not surprise many and these days he is supposedly getting tips from Anand. 

Both Abhijit Kunte and Sandipan Chanda will have to come out with good results whenever they are fielded though one gets a feeling that between them they will play only about 16 games out of a possible 56 and the major burden will be shouldered by the top four players. 

Among the women, Humpy has played much competitive chess since her elimination in the semi-finals of the world women?s championship. She should be hungry for success. 

Vijayalakshmi has won silver medal on top board in the past Olympiads. A similar performance is just what her mates will hope for. 

Teenager Harika has shown a lot of promise and so has Nisha Mohota.

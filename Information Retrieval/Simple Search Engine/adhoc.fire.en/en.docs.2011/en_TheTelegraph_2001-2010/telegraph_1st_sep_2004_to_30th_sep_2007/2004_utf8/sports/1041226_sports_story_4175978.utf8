The Telegraph - Calcutta

 East Bengal shocked

A STAFF REPORTER 

 Paolo was shown the red card 

Calcutta: East Bengal started their campaign in the San Miguel Cup in Nepal on a losing note, going down to Nepal Red XI 0-1 in Kathmandu on Saturday. 

According to information received here, Basanth Thapa scored the all-important goal towards the end of the match. 

East Bengal?s Paolo Roberto da Silva was shown the red-card a few minutes from the breather. He committed a foul (?not so serious one?, according to a club official) on an opponent. 

The Brazilian striker?s exit made the task for the city outfit, competing in the tournament as a preparation for the upcoming National Football League, more difficult. 

They managed to create very few chances against a dogged Nepal defence. Bijen Singh and Alvito D?Cunha missed the target by a whisker. But otherwise there was little on offer from the East Bengal striking force. Bijen, Douglas da Silva and Chandan Das were also booked in the match. 

Subhas Bhowmick?s boys now have to beat Bangladesh?s Farasgunj outfit in their next match to stay in contention. 

Meanwhile, Mohun Bagan goalkeeper Subrata Pal left for New Delhi to attend an AIFF meeting, slated for Monday. 

Pal has been suspended after his collision with Dempo?s Cristiano Junior in the Federation Cup final, leading to the Brazilian?s death on the field.

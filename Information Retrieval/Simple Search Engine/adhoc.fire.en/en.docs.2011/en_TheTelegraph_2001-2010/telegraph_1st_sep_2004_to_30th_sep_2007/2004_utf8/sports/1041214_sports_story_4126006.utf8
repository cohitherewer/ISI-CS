The Telegraph - Calcutta

 IHF top brass to meet Rach today

 - Coach?s future undecided 

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) president K.P.S. Gill is scheduled to meet national team coach Gerhard Rach in New Delhi on Tuesday to discuss the team?s performance in the Champions Trophy in Lahore. 

India, who managed a berth in the tournament only after Australia pulled out of the meet, finished fourth, losing 2-3 to Pakistan in the bronze medal play-off on Sunday. 

Rach?s future will also come up for discussion during the meeting. 

Meanwhile, IHF secretary K. Jyothikumaran denied an agency report that the German coach had already been fired. ?I have been misquoted,? said Jyothikumaran, adding, ?we are now concentrating on the domestic season. There?s also the National Hockey League coming up. 

?The senior national team?s engagements are long way off (two four-nation meets in Australia in June). 

The coach?s issue will be discussed during our executive committee meeting later this month or in January.? 

The secretary also maintained that the IHF has no contract with the German coach. 

Rach was appointed chief coach of the senior hockey team before the Athens Olympics, where India finished a dismal seventh.

 London: Belgian former world No. 1 Kim Clijsters has recovered from wrist surgery and will return to tennis action next week at a low-key event in her homeland.

 The 21-year-old, who missed the French Open, Wimbledon and the US Open this year with torn wrist tendons complicated by a cyst, said on Monday she had completely recovered, though still in a little pain.

 ?Good news from the doctors,? she wrote in her online diary. ?The wrist should now be completely recovered.

 ?When I am practising with more intensity, I still feel some pain, but that is quite normal ... nevertheless, I will try and prepare as thoroughly as possible for the Hasselt tournament.?

 The tournament, in its first year, is a low-key affair offering a total of just $170,000 prize money to be split among the 32-woman field. 

 Bucharest: Romanian No. 1 Andrei Pavel has recovered from his back injury and will play in this week?s Davis Cup World Group playoff against Canada in Bucharest, the player said on Monday. ?Yesterday I played my first two-set training match with full-power services,? Pavel said. ?Today I woke up without pain.?

 Romania are favourites to win the September 24-26 tie. World number 15 Pavel pulled out of the fourth round of US Open with a herniated disc in his lower back earlier this month and was unable to take part in last week?s Romanian Open. 

 Tel Aviv: Israels Davis Cup tie with Finland this week will be held over four days due to the Yom Kippur fast day on Saturday, local tennis officials said on Monday.

 The Euro-African zone group I relegation tie in Tel Aviv will start a day earlier than usual on Thursday with the two opening singles matches, Israel Tennis Association chairman Ian Froman told a news conference.

 Froman said that the schedule had been set well in advance and the Finnish team had given their approval. Yom Kippur, also known as the Day of Atonement, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar, is traditionally a time when the Jewish State comes to a standstill for 24 hours. This year it is between sundown on Friday and sundown on Saturday.

 Athens: Two South Africans whose injuries on the rugby field denied them the chance of professional honours took the Paralympics by storm on Sunday.

 Fanie Lombaard, a three-time gold medallist in Sydney four years ago, picked up more gold when he won the shot put in the F33/34 final with a world record throw of 13.81 metres.

 Troye Collins, a South African now based in London, scored 13 points as Britain, the European champions, opened their wheelchair rugby campaign with a 27-22 win over Belgium.

 In Sydney in 1992, playing for South Africa in the Rugby League World Cup sevens tournament Lombaard picked up an infection after injuring his knee which led to his leg being amputated.

 For Collins, rugby was a way of life before he had his neck broken when a scrum collapsed during a game.

 London: The Football Association will report next month on the feasibility of introducing sinbins into the English game.

 The ruling body confirmed on Monday it had set up a working party to look into a proposal put forward to its referees? committee by the Football League. Sinbins are used in sports such as rugby league as an intermediary punishment between a warning and a permanent dismissal.

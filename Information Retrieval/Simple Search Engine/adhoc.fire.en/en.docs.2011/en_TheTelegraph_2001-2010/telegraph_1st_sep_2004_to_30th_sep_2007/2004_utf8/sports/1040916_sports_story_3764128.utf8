The Telegraph - Calcutta

 ?An honour just being with team?

 - Amit Bhandari doesn?t mind being branded Mr Extra 

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI 

Birmingham: It has been thrice this year that Amit Bhandari has joined Team India either as an additional player (tri-series in Australia) or a replacement (ODIs in Pakistan and in the Champions Trophy), but isn?t worried about being branded Mr Extra. 

?Look, I don?t have a role in picking the side... So, where I?m concerned, I?ve got to accept whatever comes my way... However, it?s an honour just being with the team and, so, I?m not complaining,? Bhandari told The Telegraph on Wednesday afternoon. 

Bhandari?s debut was back in the summer of 2000, during the Asia Cup in Dhaka, but his next appearance was earlier this year only ? the tri-series game versus Zimbabwe in Perth, where he got three for 31. 

There hasn?t been any opportunity since. 

?I think I did well... Justified my selection... I?ve got to keep working hard and leave the rest to God,? Bhandari added, grinning. 

According to Bhandari, who idolises Kapil Dev and Glenn McGrath, the ?competition? is intense, but he won?t ever be found wanting. 

Incidentally, even though the 25-year-old ONGC captain isn?t the national selectors? first choice, the quintet still has a high regard for him. 

As one of the selectors recently pointed out, Bhandari deserves ?top marks? for attitude. 

Reid back with boys 

Meanwhile, former Australian quick Bruce Reid, the Indians? part-time bowling coach, had a session with the Irfan Pathans on Wednesday.

 Managua: Nicaraguan former world champion boxer Ricardo Mayorga was arrested and then freed despite pending charges on Friday after a young woman accused him of raping her in a Managua hotel.

 The boxer, who is scheduled to fight fellow former champion Felix Tito Trinidad in New York on October 2, was set free after a judge ruled that his arrest earlier in the day was illegal. He was arrested today without a warrant, judge Ricardo Gomez said.

 The boxers lawyers said he could leave the country in the next few hours, despite the fact that a prosecuting judge has scheduled a meeting with Mayorga for Saturday after rape charges were filed with a Managua court. 

 London: World Cup-winning England flyhalf Jonny Wilkinson believes his former coach Clive Woodward can make a success of a future career in football.

 Woodward, who resigned as England coach on Thursday after seven years in charge, has held talks with Rupert Lowe, chairman of Premier League soccer side Southampton. He also plans to do a grade two coaching badge with the FA.

 Clives ability as a coach makes what he wants to do very realistic, Wilkinson wrote in The Times on Saturday. I admire ambition, but the targets you set have to be realistic and the key here is that no one knows what Clive is capable of more than himself. 

 Pune: The stalemate over the 10 per cent prize money cut of chess players appears to be heading towards an amicable solution after All India Chess Federation secretary P. T. Ummer Koya assured to take up the players proposal in the central-council meeting of AICF slated next month. After Koyas assurance, the players agreed not to wear black badges but the final picture will emerge only after the next meeting of AICF.

 Mexico City: Mexicos World Cup qualifier at home to St Vincent and the Grenadines on Saturday has been postponed because Hurricane Frances prevented the Caribbean islanders from making their journey, CONCACAF said on Friday.

 CONCACAF, the governing body for the North and Central America and Caribbean soccer region, said the second stage Group C match would be rescheduled. St Vincent had been due to travel via Miami for the game.

 The hurricane roared through the Bahamas on Friday and was due to hit the crowded south-east Florida coast on Saturday, disrupting flights throughout the region.

 Mexicos first game in the group at St Kitts and Nevis was also called off because it coincided with the Olympic soccer meet, where the Mexicans were knocked out in the first round. 

 Bucharest: Romania goalkeeper Bogdan Stelea signed a two-year contract to return to his former club Dinamo Bucharest after a 13-year absence, the club coach said.

 Stelea, 37, was out of contract after leaving Spanish club Salamanca and was left out of the national team recently after struggling to find a club. Stelea has played 89 times for Romania since his debut in 1988.

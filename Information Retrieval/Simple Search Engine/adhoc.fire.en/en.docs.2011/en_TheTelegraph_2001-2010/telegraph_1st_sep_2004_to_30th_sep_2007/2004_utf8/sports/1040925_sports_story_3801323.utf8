The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Australia take 2-0 lead 

Sydney: Lleyton Hewitt crushed Mehdi Tahiri 6-0, 6-2, 6-2 on Friday to claim one of the proudest records in Australian tennis and give his country a commanding 2-0 lead over Morocco in their Davis Cup World Group play-off. 

Hewitt cruised to victory in less than an hour and a half to leave Australia in control of the relegation tie at Perth?s Royal Kings Park after Wayne Arthurs beat Mounir El Aarej 7-6, 6-4, 6-3 in the opening singles match. 

Hewitt?s win was his 25th in Davis Cup singles, eclipsing Adrian Quist?s Australian record of 24. Quist had established the mark over a 16-year period from 1933 to 1948. 

Hewitt, on the other hand, achieved the feat in just his sixth year of Davis Cup play. Australia have played the tournament for 99 years. 

Hewitt has won his last eight Davis Cup singles matches and 14 of his last 15. 

?All the talk was on that, but I wasn?t really concentrating on it,? Hewitt said of the record. ?I?m only 23, so hopefully I can build a little bit of a gap on the next guy.? 

Hewitt equalled Quist?s long-standing mark during Australia?s first-round loss to Sweden in February and seemed certain to establish a record after Morocco?s two best players, Hicham Arazi and Younes El Aynaoui, pulled out of the tie because of injury. 

Tahiri, ranked 507th in the world, was unable to mount a serious challenge to Hewitt, who climbed back to third in the rankings after making the US Open final earlier this month. 

Hewitt raced through the first set in 25 minutes, losing just three points on his serve, then broke his opponent twice to win the second set. 

The Australian had a minor hiccup when he failed to serve out the match at 5-1 but immediately broke back to secure victory. .(Agencies)

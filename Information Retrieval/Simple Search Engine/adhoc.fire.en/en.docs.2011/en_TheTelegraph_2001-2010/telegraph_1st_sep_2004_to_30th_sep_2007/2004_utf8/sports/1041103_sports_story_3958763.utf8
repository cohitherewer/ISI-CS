The Telegraph - Calcutta

 India go down to China

Hyderabad: India lost to China 2-3 in the last league match of the fourth Asian women?s under-21 hockey championship being played at Gachibowli Hockey Complex on Tuesday. 

The hosts have lost all the three games they played and will now vie for the third-fourth places on November 4 before the final. 

Jaswinder gave India an early lead in the third minute but Jhe Hai Ying of China levelled the score in the 12th minute and three minutes later Cheng Jia Yan took the visitors ahead to go into half-time with 2-1 lead. 

In the second half, Xia Li Hone swelled the lead by converting a penalty corner in the 47th and Anjana Barla reduced the margin by putting it across in the 54th minute. 

The dismal show of the Indians continued as they could convert only one of the 12 penalty corners awarded to them while Chinese romped home with one of the fourth penalty corners they were given. 

Jaswinder thrilled the local crowd when she tapped a cross from the flank into the goal to draw the first blood but the tempo soon died down with the weak Indian defence being ripped open by the Chinese forwards.

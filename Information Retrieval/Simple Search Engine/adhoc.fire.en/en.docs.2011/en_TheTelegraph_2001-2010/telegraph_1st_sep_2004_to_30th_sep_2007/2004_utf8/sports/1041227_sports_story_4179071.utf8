 Quake in Dhaka fells India

 - Bangladesh?s 100th ODI turns historic

 - Indians expected to be at full strength in decider today

Dhaka: Bangladesh pulled off a stunning 15-run upset win over India in the second one-day International at the Bangabandhu National Stadium on Sunday night. 

India had won the first match in Chittagong by 11 runs. There will, thus, be everything to play for when Sourav Ganguly?s men cross swords with their unfancied rivals in the deciding day-nighter on Monday. 

The packed stadium went delirious in joy as they celebrated Bangladesh?s first victory on home soil in 36 one-day Internationals. 

In terms of significance, it was similar to their 1999 World Cup triumph over Pakistan in Northampton. 

For the Indians, it was as disappointing as their defeat at the hands of Kenya in the 1998 tri-series clash in Gwalior. 

Chasing Bangladesh?s none-too-imposing total of 229 for nine, India were bowled out for 214 in 47.5 overs, crashing to their first-ever defeat to the minnows in any form of the game. 

It was doubly historic for Bangladesh who were playing their 100th one-day International. Their excellent performance, especially by bowlers and fielders, belied the fact that they had won just five of their previous 99 ODIs. 

The Indians, who had been following the rotation policy in this series to give all youngsters a chance, paid the price for over-confidence. They should be at full strength on Monday with big guns Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and Irfan Pathan almost sure to return to the XI. 

India made heavy weather of chasing what should have been a routine total which was built around an enterprising 67 by Aftab Ahmed. 

Sridharan Sriram top-scored with 57 while Mohammed Kaif also made a fluent 49 but that wasn?t enough as the visitors surrendered to a supremely determined opposition. 

The Indian chase never really took off after they lost Virender Sehwag to the third ball of the innings. A series of bad strokes led to one of their worst ever ODI defeats. 

The brightest phase of the innings came when Kaif and Sriram featured in a 63-run stand for the fourth wicket. 

Joginder Sharma showed pluck in unleashing audacious shots to remain unbeaten on 29 but the lower order cracked under pressure. 

The stadium erupted as Aftab?s direct hit knocked the non-striker?s stumps to run last man Murali Kartik out in the 48th over. 

Paceman Mashrafee Murtaza, declared Man-of-the-Match for his allround display, provided a thunderous start as he broke through the defence of Sehwag to castle him. 

Then, Yuvraj Singh?s full-blooded drive off Tapash Baisya landed straight in the hands of Rajin Saleh at cover. 

At seven for two, Bangladesh smelt blood. It also meant Sourav had to curb his attacking instincts. With Sriram also taking time to settle down, there was a period of lull. 

Baishya strayed in line and length occasionally and there were a couple of overthrows, but the field placings were attacking, so much so that India?s first 50 came only in the 17th over. Bangladesh tasted more success when Sourav drove medium-pacer Khaled Mahmud straight to Murtaza at point. 

The arrival of Kaif injected some vigour as he found the gaps consistently. It also spurred Sriram to open up. The Tamil Nadu batsman executed two reverse sweeps off left-arm spinner Mohammad Rafique to reach his maiden half-century. 

He earned the benefit of doubt from the TV umpire for a run out appeal but soon ran out of luck. After being beaten by Rafique while trying to sweep, the left-hander lost sight of the ball that rebounded off the wicketkeeper?s pads on to the stumps. As he came out of the crease, Mashud reacted in an instant to grab the ball and pluck the stumps from the ground. 

Sriram?s 57 came off 91 balls and contained seven fours. India?s second 50 came in 10 overs and although Dinesh Mongia fell cheaply, there was no let-up in shot-making. 

Mahendra Singh Dhoni adopted a slambang approach, but after striking two boundaries, played a pull off Murtaza that was taken low at mid-wicket by Bashar. 

That brought the crowd back to its feet. The equation was balanced with 60 needed from 60 balls.

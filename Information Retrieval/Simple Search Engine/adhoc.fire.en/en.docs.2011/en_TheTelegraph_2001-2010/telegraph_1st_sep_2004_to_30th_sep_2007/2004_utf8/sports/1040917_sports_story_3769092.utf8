Leverkusen: Bayer Leverkusen scored one of the biggest upsets in Champions League history, crushing Real Madrid 3-0 in group B to end a seven-match losing streak in the competition. 

It gave Leverkusen a modicum of revenge for losing the 2002 final to Real in Glasgow but, more importantly, gave them three valuable points at the start of their campaign. 

A miserable night for Real ended with the news that playmaker Zinedine Zidane dislocated a shoulder and will be out for three weeks at least. 

It was Real?s biggest European defeat for four years and means they have won only once in 20 European matches in Germany. 

Manchester United, like Real possible title-contenders, also looked like capitulating to a shock defeat but recovered from 0-2 down to draw 2-2 at Olympique Lyon in their group D opener. 

Lyon led with goals from Cris (35th minute) and Pierre-Alain Frau (45th) after some poor defending but United struck back in six second-half minutes with two goals from Ruud van Nistelrooy who broke Denis Law?s European club record of 28 goals. 

Van Nistelrooy scored a header to grab his 29th European goal for United and a deft touch made it 2-2 six minutes later. Including nine goals for previous club PSV Eindhoven, he has now scored 39 European goals ? more than any other Dutch player. 

The other group D match saw Turkey?s Fenerbahce end their seven-match losing streak in the competition with a 1-0 win over Sparta Prague thanks to a header from another Dutch striker ? Pierre van Hooijdonk ? after 16 minutes. 

But Fenerbahce finished the match with 10 men after Servet Cetin was sent off after 73 minutes. 

Juventus won the battle of former final rivals when they beat Ajax 1-0 in Amsterdam in group C, thanks to a brilliantly taken chipped goal from European Player of the Year Pavel Nedved three minutes before half-time. 

Bayern Munich, the third former European champion in group C, also made a winning start with another Dutchman on target. 

Striker Roy Makaay made no mistake with a second-half penalty that spoilt the festive occasion in Tel Aviv where fans chose to celebrate the first Champions League match played in Israel rather than stay home and celebrate the start of the Jewish New Year. 

Another former European champion to enjoy a good start were Liverpool who proved far too strong for last season?s beaten finalists AS Monaco in group A at Anfield where Djibril Cisse and Milan Baros scored brilliant goals. 

Deportivo Coruna drew 0-0 with Olympiakos in the same group, a result that pleased visiting manager Dusan Bajevic whose team ended a run of eight successive away defeats in the competition, though they still have not won in 23 games outside Greece. 

Horrific show 

Real?s shocking performance was described by the Spanish press as horrific, pathetic and disastrous. Their fans might have expected the return of hard-nosed coach Jose Antonio Camacho, plus spending of 45 million euros ($55.13 million) on defenders, to sort out the crisis that beset the club last season. But Wednesday?s result showed Camacho is no nearer finding a solution than predecessor Carlos Queiroz. 

Real were a caricature of the side that beat Leverkusen 2-1 in the 2002 final when Zidane?s exquisite volley secured the club?s ninth European Cup win. 

Raul, who scored the opening goal in that final, showed no signs of rediscovering the form that has long since deserted him, Luis Figo spent more time on the ground than on his feet and Ivan Helguera demonstrated he no longer deserves a place in central midfield. 

Ronaldo and David Beckham contributed little to the cause, while striker Michael Owen, the latest star recruit, did not even make it off the bench. 

?I don?t know why we?re incapable of playing football at the moment,? Roberto Carlos said after the match. ?Things aren?t coming off for us and the players are blocked.? 

?There?s still an opportunity for us to fight back,? said goalkeeper Iker Casillas. ?The good thing is that this has happened in the first game rather than the last.? 

Camacho, who coached Real for 22 days in 1998 and was persuaded to return in place of Queiroz before the start of this season, knows a change of attitude is needed if Real are to emerge from that run in decent shape. 

?It may be that we?re lacking the necessary humility,? he said. ?Real have been playing great football for two years and now we?re not. It may be that it?s the coach?s fault but I?ll have to talk it over with the players.?

Calcutta: Aloke Mukherjee settled his score after his team Ever-Ready Association defeated Mohun Bagan via a Eugene Gray strike to spoil the green-and-maroons plan to regain lead in the CFL Super Division. 

Mukherjee, the former Mohun Bagan coach, who had to resign from office during last season?s National Football League, did try to give credit to his boys, but the joy was clearly visible. 

The victory at the Kalyani Municipality Stadium on Thursday not only brought the winners on level terms with Bagan (both on 35 points from 17 matches), but also helped East Bengal?s cause. The red-gold shirts still maintain a single point lead with two matches remaining, and a win in their Sunday encounter against Mohammedan Sporting should see the defending champions secure the league. 

Ever-Ready looked a dominant side, playing free flowing football keeping the ball on the ground. Captain Sankho Roy Chowdhury, Jayanta Sen, Satyajit Bose and Sheikh Sanjib played their hearts out in the middle. The defenders stood tall and striker Eugene Gray kept the opponent defence under threat. The lone bleak spot was new recruit Emanuel Thomas, who missed a couple of chances within the first 15 minutes. 

Satyajit and Sanjib exhibited a perfect wing-play, stretching the Bagan defenders on the counter. It was from one such counter in the 36th minute that Gray scored the winner. Sanjib?s through set Gray in the open and the striker, taking Palash Karmakar in his stride, gently tapped in past an onrushing ?keeper Subrata Pal. 

Mohun Bagan clearly looked out of sorts. Their Brazilian striker Roberto Mendes Silva ?Beto? hardly managed to trouble. However, he did get a golden opportunity to equalise in the 85th minute. With only ?keeper Amit Singha Roy to beat from inside the box, he hit straight to the custodian. 

Mohun Bagan made three changes, but none worked for them. A half-fit T. Roopesh was replaced by another half-fit Palash, who himself had to be substituted by veteran Jo Paul Ancheri. Ancheri made his debut in the green-maroon jersey after almost a decade and disappointed. 

Ever-Ready could have doubled the lead in the 80th, but Thomas? prompt (the only positive effort from the striker) rebounded off the horizontal. Bagan officials lamented lack of quality players (either through injury or national duty), but Ever-Ready clearly exposed the lack of ideas in the green-maroon ranks.

 Gilchrist looks for a 3-0 win

 - We have been fortunate to win the toss in all three Tests, says Aussie stand-in captain 

 Gilchrist feels India were ?psyched out? by the wicket in Nagpur 

Mumbai: Australia want to cap off their successful India tour with another win in the fourth and last cricket Test to prove their supremacy over the hosts. 

Aussie skipper Adam Gilchrist said now that his team had clinched the series, its next target would be to win the match starting at the Wankhede Stadium on Wednesday. 

?Though it has been a very good away series win for us after nearly 35 years, I would like to win the Mumbai Test to prove our supremacy,? he said after a promotional programme in the city. 

?We have been fortunate to win the toss in all the three Test matches during this series and I am quite happy to be leading the series 2-0 though I personally would be happy with a 3-0 verdict,? said Gilchrist, who is the brand ambassador for the 3 global services. 

On the Nagpur Test, Gilchrist, who led his team commendably in the absence of regular skipper Ricky Ponting, said ?I think the Indians were psyched out by the wicket in Nagpur even before the Test started. 

?Even in the Chennai Test the Indians had an opportunity to close us down but they did not take it and left us off the hook when our batsmen managed to hang out in the middle,? he said. 

Hailing Ponting as the best captain of Australia, Gilchrist said there was no pressure whatsoever when he took over as the acting captain. 

?As every player has been contributing consistently on this tour, there has been no pressure on me as a captain. Though the absence of Ponting was felt in the initial stages of the series, the younger lot proved themselves with important contributions,? Gilchrist said. 

?Like India missed Sachin Tendulkar in the first two Tests due to tennis elbow, we too missed Ponting but thankfully for us things went well with everyone sharing the responsibility,? Gilchrist said. 

He admitted that winning the series had been a very emotional experience. 

?It was indeed a very emotional experience specially when you consider that we have not won a series here since 35 years. All the preparations which had gone prior to coming here has been worthwhile and it is a very good feeling to win over here.? 

Gilchrist also said that at the start of the tour he had not expected a 2-0 lead going into the last Test.

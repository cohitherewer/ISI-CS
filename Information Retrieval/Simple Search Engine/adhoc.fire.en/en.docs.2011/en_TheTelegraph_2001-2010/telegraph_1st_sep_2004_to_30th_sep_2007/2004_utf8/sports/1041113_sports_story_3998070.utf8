The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Tough opener 

for Max, Mahesh 

 A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Mahesh Bhupathi and Max Mirnyi will open their Masters Cup campaign in Houston on Saturday with a tough match against the experienced Swede-Aussie combination of Jonas Bjorkman and Todd Woodbridge. 

According to information received here, Bhupathi and Mirnyi ? who qualified for the prestigious year-end event as the world?s fifth-best team ? are in the Blue group. Completing the four-team group are American twins Bob and Mike Bryan and Argentine duo Gaston Etlis and Martin Rodriguez. 

The Red group comprises top seeds Mark Knowles-Daniel Nestor, Wayne Black-Kevin Ullyett, Martin Damm-Cyril Suk and Belgian rookies Xavier Malisse-Oliver Rochus. 

Even though Malisse and Rochus didn?t finish among the top-eight, they booked a berth in the Masters for winning one of the four Grand Slams this year (French Open). 

Each team plays the other in its group with the top two advancing to the semi-finals.

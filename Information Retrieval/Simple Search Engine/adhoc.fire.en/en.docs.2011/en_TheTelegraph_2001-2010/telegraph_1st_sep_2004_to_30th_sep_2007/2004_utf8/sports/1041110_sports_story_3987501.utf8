The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Sourav fitness test now on Thursday

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Team India captain Sourav Ganguly seemed completely fit during batting and fielding against Karnataka on Day III at the Jadavpur University?s Salt Lake ground on Tuesday. 

But he would still have to appear for a fitness test under physio Andrew Leipus on Thursday. ?I don?t know when the test would be held,? Sourav, however, said. 

Sourav also had a 30-minute stint at the gymnasium of a city hotel during the time when Bengal were batting. ?Sourav is facing no problem,? a source informed. 

When asked whether it was necessary for a player to appear for a fitness test even after playing a Ranji Trophy match, Sourav didn?t wish to comment. ?That is up to the board and the physio.? 

?The fitness test will not be held before Thursday,? informed CAB president Jagmohan Dalmiya, who also happens to be the immediate past president of the BCCI. 

?I haven?t been told anything about his fitness test on Wednesday and he will be here till the match is over,? Karsan Ghavri said.

 Lehmann named year?s best

Sydney: Australian batsman Darren Lehmann was on Wednesday named Wisden Australia?s cricketer-of-the-year for 2004. 

Lehmann, who tore a right hamstring in the third Test against India in Nagpur and missed the ongoing fourth and final Test in Mumbai, was conferred the honour for his purple international patch in the latest Wisden issue, according to an Australian website. 

The south Australian, who missed the first half of the last Australian summer due to injury, came back strongly to score 686 runs, including two centuries and five fifties, at an average of 45.73 in eight Tests ? five against Sri Lanka and three versus India. 

The 34-year-old also made a mark as a part-time spinner with impressive figures of three for 50 and three for 42 in the third Test in Colombo, a game in which he also made 153. In the one-day Internationals, Lehmann?s five innings in eight games have earned him 173 runs at an average of 34.6, with a top score of 67 against Zimbabwe in Harare. (PTI)

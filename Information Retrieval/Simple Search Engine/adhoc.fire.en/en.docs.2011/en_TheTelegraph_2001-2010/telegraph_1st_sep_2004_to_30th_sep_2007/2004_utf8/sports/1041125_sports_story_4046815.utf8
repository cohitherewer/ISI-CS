The Telegraph - Calcutta

 A dull and dreary draw in Kanpur

Kanpur: Despite Indian spinners taking four quick wickets in South Africa?s second innings, the first Test ended in a draw on Wednesday. 

South Africa were reduced to 169 for four at one stage before Jacques Kallis (28 not out) and Boeta Dippenaar (31 not out) played out the final session for the tourists to reach 169 for four. 

Their unbeaten 54-run partnership gave South Africa an overall lead of 213 runs when play was called off late on the fifth evening. 

The tourists, who piled on 510 for nine declared in their first innings, bowled out India for 466 before lunch to take a 44-run lead. 

Fast bowler Makhaya Ntini grabbed three wickets in a fiery morning spell as India managed to add just 65 runs to their overnight 401 for four at the Green Park track. 

The bulk of India?s scoring was done by openers Virender Sehwag (164) and Gautam Gambhir (96), who shared in a second highest stand of 218 runs for the first wicket on Tuesday. Allrounder Andrew Hall shone for the tourists with bat and ball, batting through almost five sessions to score 163 in the first innings, his maiden Test century. 

He then claimed three for 93 with his medium pace to win Man-of-the-Match award. 

The South African batsmen, hoping to repeat their first innings effort, began well with Hall and captain Graeme Smith putting on 67 for the first wicket. Hall then snicked off-spinner Harbhajan Singh to wicketkeeper Dinesh Karthik and Smith fell to a bat-pad catch at forward short leg, having survived some close lbw appeals. 

Smith?s knock of 47 came in 141 minutes, 100 balls and included seven hits to the fence. 

Martin van Jaarsveld failed again, trapped in front of the wicket for 13 by left-arm spinner Murali Kartik, and lefthander Jacques Rudolph (2) perished as he edged a Harbhajan delivery that spun viciously. Karthik took the catch on the second attempt. Dippenaar and Kallis played cautiously to deny more success to the spinners in the final session. 

India?s hopes of exerting any pressure on the tourists in the second innings were snuffed out in the morning by Ntini and Shaun Pollock in conditions favouring seamers. Ntini, having gone wicketless for two days, scalped three to provide his team a psychological boost. 

He removed Rahul Dravid (54) and V.V.S. Laxman (9) in the early overs to trigger a collapse, as India could add just 65 to their overnight 401 for four. 

Ntini had Dravid caught behind after he added only two runs to his overnight score, before forcing Laxman to play on to his stumps to finish with three for 135. 

Further wickets fell cheaply until No. 10 Zaheer Khan lashed 30 off 34 balls with three fours and a six before he was the last man out, bowled by Hall.

 Koepke new goalkeeping coach

Berlin: Former Germany international Andreas Koepke was named on Thursday as the national side?s new goalkeeping coach with the debate over the current No. 1 still rumbling on. 

The 42-year-old, who was in goal when Germany won the 1996 European Championships, has signed a contract with the German football association (DFB) until the 2006 World Cup, which Germany is hosting. 

?The 2006 project is a great challenge and I am as optimistic as my colleagues about it,? said Koepke, who played 59 times for Germany. 

Koepke?s first task will be to seek an end to tensions between rival goalkeepers Oliver Kahn and Jens Lehmann. 

Coach Juergen Klinsmann dismissed previous goalkeeping coach Sepp Maier 12 days ago after the 1974 World Cup-winning keeper openly stated that Kahn was the undisputed No. 1 and Lehmann should forget about 2006. 

Lehmann has said he should replace Kahn as first choice and had accused Maier of being a?lobbyist? for the Bayern Munich ?keeper. Maier had doubled as coach for Germany and Bayern since 1988.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Pak include Asif, Khalil 

Karachi: Pakistan have included debutant pace bowlers Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Khalil in a 17-man squad announced on Monday for their three-Test tour of Australia. 

Asif, who has taken 117 wickets in 33 first class matches, is the leading wicket taker on the domestic circuit this season while left-armer Khalil has played for the Pakistan junior and A sides. 

?We have picked the best possible balanced outfit for what is going to be a very tough tour. But at the same time the youngsters in the side have a chance to establish themselves on a permanent basis,? chief selector Wasim Bari said. 

?Both have a lot of potential and with Shabbir Ahmed injured it was necessary to have a strong pace attack because in Australia the pitches are good for the pace bowlers.? 

Shabbir, who has not played since September because of a knee injury, failed to pass a fitness test. 

Pakistan leave on Saturday for the tour, which includes Tests in Perth, Melbourne and Sydney followed by a triangular one-day tournament also involving West Indies. 

Bari said there would be two changes made for the one-day series in the 17-member squad. 

Pakistan have never won a Test series in Australia and suffered a 3-0 whitewash in the last series between the two countries in 2002.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Paul?s dream fulfilled

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: At last Shib Shankar Paul?s dream was fulfilled when he met his childhood hero Glenn McGrath during the third day of the Mumbai Test against Australia on Friday. 

?I went up to McGrath and asked for some bowling tips from him,? Paul said on the sidelines of Bengal?s Ranji Trophy match against Karnataka at the Jadavpur University?s Salt Lake campus ground on Sunday. ?He appreciated my bowling,? he added. 

According to Paul, the maiden meeting with the Australian quick was really an ?exciting moment? in his life. 

?McGrath mainly advised me to maintain discipline on Indian tracks and not to try anything hard,? Paul said.

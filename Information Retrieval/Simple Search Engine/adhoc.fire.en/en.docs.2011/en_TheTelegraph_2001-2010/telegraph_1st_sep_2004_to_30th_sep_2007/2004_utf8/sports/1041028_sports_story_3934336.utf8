 Tunnel antics end in chuckles

 - United game out on top with refereeing decisions

 Alan Smith

 Ferguson and Wenger will 

 see it as a bit of a laugh.

They should make a film about it: The Tunnel, co-starring Sir Alex Ferguson and Arsene Wenger, with special guest appearances from the Phantom Flan Flinger, plus any footballer from the past who has had a dust-up in this sacrosanct area. 

It would, let me tell you, be a fairly long cast list, for, without wishing to make light of the events following Sunday?s bitter clash between Manchester United and Arsenal, these kind of shenanigans are as old as the hills. One area, however, where the Old Trafford storyline differed somewhat was the willingness of both managers to get involved, too. Normally in these circumstances they are first up the tunnel, in a hurry to reach the dressing room to prepare post-match debriefings. Not this time. This was far too important, whether we?re talking about crowing in victory or haranguing Ruud van Nistelrooy. 

Then there was the other significant departure from the usual argy-bargy ? an unknown individual grabbing a slice of pizza and having the temerity to lob it at Ferguson. With one swift throw, all the rancour and bitterness was reduced to a food fight. Not for the first time, the tunnel became a scene of controversy. 

In reality, this area has always been something of a closed book to football supporters, an almost mystical place they hear about in dispatches, but are rarely given the chance to see for themselves, a place where all sorts of mischief is rumoured to go on. For players, it?s the traditional refuge from the glare of the camera or the critical eye of a ground full of fans. Within this shadowy and confined space, emotions are so much more inclined to get completely out of hand. Guards drop, tempers rise to the point where it sometimes escalates into a wild free-for-all. 

I have seen it so often, as two sets of adrenalin-fuelled players come shoulder to shoulder after 90 minutes of unmitigated aggro. Insults are commonplace, they happen all the time, and nine times out of 10 that?s where it ends. A coach or a physio will step in-between to diffuse the situation with a bit of common sense. The warring factions are hastily separated and led to their dressing rooms, where they can cool down in private. Not always, though. There was the time when two teammates of mine, with a grudge match coming up, decided to set a code for the onset of fisticuffs. For some reason, ?Cup of Tea!? was decided as the code. In the tunnel afterwards they waited for their moment. One gave the call, both dived on to their prey. So clinical and swift was the attack, nobody had the chance to react before both antagonists scampered from the scene. 

No such malice aforethought on Sunday. No rehearsals involved. Such is the enmity between these two sides, both sets of managers joined in the ?fun?. And strange as it may seem with so much controversy still swirling, Ferguson and Wenger will now see it as exactly that ? a bit of a laugh. Back in their offices on Monday, given time to cool down, I suspect they both had a chuckle. 

Two grown men in suits, senior figures in the game, hurling graphic insults in the heat of the moment ? in hindsight, it?s enough to make anyone laugh, not to say blush. 

The real damage, of course, was done on the pitch. United had it away, coming out on top with refereeing decisions. For Arsenal, that?s what hurts more than anything. For Ferguson, that?s what tastes the sweetest. The pizza, the soup, whatever it was, doesn?t come remotely close. With victory to savour, theatrics in the tunnel don?t mean anything at all.

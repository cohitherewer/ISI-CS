 Ponting rejects flat-fee offer

Sydney: Australia?s leading cricketers will demand through their players? union that they want to stick to a percentage of the game?s revenue, rather than a flat rate. 

Captain Ricky Ponting answered with a blunt ?no? here on Tuesday when asked at a media conference whether he would accept going back to a flat fee structure. 

Currently Australia?s elite cricketers receive 25 per cent of Cricket Australia?s (CA) total revenue from gate takings, television rights and other promotional activities. 

CA reportedly wants to end a financial agreement under which the players receive a cut of revenues estimated at $21.5 million in the current season. (AFP)

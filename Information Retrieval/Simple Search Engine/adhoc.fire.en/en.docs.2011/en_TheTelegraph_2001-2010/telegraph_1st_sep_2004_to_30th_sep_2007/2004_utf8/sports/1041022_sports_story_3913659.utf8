The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Cloud over Sachin begins to clear

 - Andrew Leipus watched Sachin for two hours and came back very satisfied: Wright 

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI 

Calcutta: For the first time since Sachin Tendulkar?s injury, the Team India support staff is actually confident his (costly) lay-off may end within days. 

Owing to a tennis elbow, Sachin has been off cricket for two months. Now, he should be available for the third Test against Australia, in Nagpur (from October 26) and the final one, in Mumbai (November 3 onwards). 

?Our physio (Andrew Leipus) watched Sachin at a two-hour nets session this morning and came back very satisfied. That, indeed, is good news,? coach John Wright told The Telegraph on Thursday evening. 

Speaking from Mumbai, he added: ?Of course, Andrew wants to see Sachin tomorrow as well, but as of now, there?s reason to be optimistic. However, it?s a fact we?re looking at Sachin on a day-to-day basis?? 

Wright?s keenness to have Sachin back is understandable ? the Australians, after all, are ahead 1-0 and time is definitely at a premium. 

Incidentally, while Leipus has indicated Sachin?s fitness test could be gone through in Mumbai itself on Saturday, Wright suggested the same may well be on Sunday ? the Board?s deadline for the maestro?s availability ? after Team India assembles in Nagpur. 

?It?s a bit open? Let?s see,? he remarked. 

Sachin will be included as the 15th member once he clears the fitness test.

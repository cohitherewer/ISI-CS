 Clarke extends lead

Gotemba: Britain?s Darren Clarke fired a solid 67 to extend his lead to four shots at the Taiheiyo Masters on Saturday. 

The Ulsterman made six birdies and only blotted his scorecard on the par-four 12th as he reached the clubhouse on 18-under 198 in chilly Shizuoka. 

Japan?s Nozomi Kawahara had a bogey-free 66 to hole out on 202 with Englishman Lee Westwood and Taiwan?s Yeh Wei-tze on 12-under 204 going into the final day of the $1.4 million event. 

?There?s nothing to make me nervous (about winning the title),? said the cigar-puffing Clarke, who has played on three different continents in the past two weeks. ?If I play the same way, I?ll be alright.? 

Clarke, a key member of Europe?s Ryder Cup triumph over the United States in September, won his only previous title in Japan at the 2001 Chunichi Crowns tournament.

 Akram Khan?s nephew in Bangla squad

Dhaka: Bangladesh have included rookie Nafis Iqbal Khan in a 14-member squad for the first Test against New Zealand next week. 

Habibul Bashar, out of action for a month due to a thumb injury, was retained as skipper in the hope that ?he will recover fully? in time for the match beginning on Tuesday. 

The Bangladesh Cricket Board was to announce a 13-member squad but added one more player as a back-up for Bashar. Bashar, 32, missed the Champions Trophy and underwent a surgery in Australia last month. 

?He can bat, but he cannot still have a full grip,? said a BCB executive. Nafis, a nephew of former national captain Akram Khan, has appeared in ODIs but this is his first Test call-up.

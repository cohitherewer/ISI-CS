 Gaurav in joint lead

New Delhi: India?s Gaurav Ghei flew on an eagle as he moved into joint lead with Lin Chie-Hsiang of Chinese Taipei after the third round of the Taiwan Open in Taipei on Saturday. 

Of the other Indians in fray, Amandeep Johl was sharing the 10th place with 219 (77, 73, 69) while Vivek Bhandari and Harmeet Kahlon were joint 12th with a total score of 220. 

It was Ghei?s 36th birthday on Saturday and he celebrated it in style at the North Bay Golf and Country Club, shooting a three-under-par 69 that included a stunning eagle two in the $ 300,000 Asian Tour event. 

Overnight joint leader Lin, bidding for his third Taiwan Open crown, overcame a shaky start to sign for a 71 while Australian Terry Pilkadaris, fourth in the recent Kolon Korean Open, finished the day one stroke back after a 70, according to information received here. 

Since winning his only major title in the 1995, Ghei?s career has been hit by injuries and he was delighted with his performance. ?I?m really happy to be in the joint lead. I feel lucky and hopefully, it?ll go my way tomorrow,? said Ghei, who has a three-day total of two-under-par 214. 

After birdies on the second and eighth holes and a bogey on 11, Ghei finished with a stroke of genius. He had 105 yards to the pin on the par four 16th and struck a sweet wedge that found the bottom of the cup for his eagle.

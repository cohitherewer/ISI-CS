Karachi: Sanath Jayasuriya remained unbeaten on 96 to lead Sri Lanka?s fightback after Inzamam-ul Haq?s century put Pakistan in a strong position on the third day of the second Test on Saturday. 

Trailing by 270 runs in first innings, Sri Lanka were 134 for one, still needing a further 136 to avoid an innings defeat. 

The left-handed Jayasuriya was on the brink of his 14th Test century, having hit 14 fours and a six in 104 balls. He became his country?s highest run-scorer in Tests when he reached 83. His exhilarating display continued a strong revival by the visitors, who took the last five wickets for 77 runs in the afternoon session to dismiss Pakistan for 478 in their first innings. 

However, Pakistan captain Inzamam believes his team have a good opportunity to level the two-match series with a victory. Pakistan had been in a dominant position at lunch, reaching 387 for five with Inzamam unbeaten on 117, his 20th Test century and fifth against Sri Lanka. 

The wickets fell, though, at regular intervals after Inzamam departed, out to the fourth ball after lunch without adding to his score. Inzamam, having batted for five-and-a-half hours and 242 balls, edged left-arm pacer Chaminda Vaas to Mahela Jayawardene at first slip. 

Jayawardene had put down a similar chance off Dilhara Fernando when Inzamam was on 108 runs, just before lunch. Jayasuriya, who top-scored with 253 in Sri Lanka?s first Test win in Faisalabad, reached his fifty from 49 balls, including eight fours and a six to square leg off Danish Kaneria. 

He became his country?s highest scorer in Tests with a cover drive for four that took him to 83, surpassing Aravinda de Silva?s career total of 6,361 runs.

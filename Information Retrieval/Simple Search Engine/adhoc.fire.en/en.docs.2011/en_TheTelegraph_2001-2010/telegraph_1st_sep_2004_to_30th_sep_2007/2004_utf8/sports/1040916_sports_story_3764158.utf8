 I have run out of energy: Bielsa

 Marcelo Bielsa 

Buenos Aires: Argentina coach Marcelo Bielsa resigned out of the blue on Tuesday, less than a month after steering the twice world champions to their first Olympic soccer gold medal (as reported in Wednesday?s Late City edition). 

Former Boca Juniors coach Carlos Bianchi was named as the favourite to replace the eccentric 49-year-old, who said he had run out of energy after six years in the high-pressure job. 

?Today, I resigned as coach of the Argentina national team,? the introverted Bielsa told a news conference. 

?I realised the amount of energy which is absorbed by the various tasks which are involved in being coach of the team... and that I didn?t have this energy any more. 

?It seemed to me that, at this stage of the work, I cannot afford the absence of energy, so I matured the decision to disconnect myself from this job. 

?The decision began to take shape after we came back from Lima in the last game,? Bielsa said. ?If our situation in the qualifiers had not been favourable, I would not have taken this decision. This seemed to me to be the ideal moment. 

He added: ?To be coach of the national team brings passion, because it is one of the most important national teams in the world. 

?I went through what all coaches go through and criticism is part of the job. Argentina has a group of players who are capable of producing a lot and you have to be up to the demands.? (REUTERS)

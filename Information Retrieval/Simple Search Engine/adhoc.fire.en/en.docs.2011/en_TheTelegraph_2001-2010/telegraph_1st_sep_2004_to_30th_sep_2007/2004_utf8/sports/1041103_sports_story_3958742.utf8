 Vijay Singh fulfilled expectations 

 STAR RACER

 Expectations were high from Vijay Singh on Thursday, the opening day of the winter season. And the trainer did not disappoint with a haul of four winners. But he could have pushed his tally to five had his half-money favourite, Thrilling Proposal, not come a cropper. It happened soon after the start of the 1,400-metre RWITC Cup when jockey S. Shanker unbalanced himself on the half-money favourite. Brother Bharath?s Magic Mantra, a 6-1 chance, thus seized the opportunity to drive home the advantage. 

 On his monsoon form, Magic Mantra was, however, no pushover. On revised weights, he did enjoy a 10-kg handicap pull over Thrilling Proposal. But who cared after Thrilling Proposal?s bloodless victory in his subsequent monsoon outing. Punters? is a breed who loves the post-race compunctions. 

 Vijay?s quest for winners begun from the word ?go?? But it was the wrong one from the yard, Louis Cyphre, who opened his account. The stable?s hot-favourite Reminiscent had no mercy for those who went by her last year?s form. A four-month lay off had made the last winter?s hattrick maker rusty in her movements. In the hands of C. Alford, she badly trailed the field for too long, leaving Louis Cyphre with a commanding lead and a thumping victory in the 1,600m Sholay Handicap. 

 Alford did not mean to give another fright on next hot-favourite, Almara, but the Vijay-trainee did miss the kick at the start. The jockey was, however, quick to alert the filly. He brought her closer to the field and improved his position with each passing furlong to the relief of his backer who had been cursing his luck. But the victory had to wait till 100m from home as Alford decided to gain advantage with hands and heels, and not the stick. 

 Alford left nothing to chance on Mega Role, Vijay?s third winner. A four-length lead from the start proved quite productive for the favourite who eased up long before passing the winning post.

 Alashaan displayed no rustiness in his bones despite his more than seven-month lay-off from the track. More importantly, the fourth winner from Vijay?s yard made light of his heavy impost of 61-1/2 kg in the 1,100m Red Chieftan Handicap.

 Singh siblings? complete dominance left very little playground for the champion schooler Daniel David. Yet he managed a winner in Beyond The Clouds. It was a close contest for the 5-2 second, but Kavan Kariappa?s forceful riding got the measure of the favourite Royal Contender who came in with his customary late run.

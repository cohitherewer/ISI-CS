 Inzamam, Razzaq may play

 Inzamam is much better now 

Sydney: Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq and allrounder Abdul Razzaq are expected to be fit for the third Test against Australia starting on Sunday. 

Inzamam missed the second Test in Melbourne with a back injury while Razzaq was twice admitted to hospital after suffering from a mystery illness. 

Both players still need to pass fitness tests to take their place at the Sydney Cricket Ground, but Pakistan manager Haroon Rashid appeared optimistic. 

?(Inzamam?s) been undergoing treatment and going to the gym and the signs are good but we won?t know until we see how he goes with batting,? Haroon told reporters in Melbourne on Thursday. 

Razzaq was taken to hospital after feeling dizzy during the Melbourne Test but returned to bat in his team?s second innings. He was readmitted after the match ended but was released again with a clean bill of health. 

?He came out of hospital last evening and was feeling much better,? Haroon said. ?We couldn?t figure it out. Nobody knows what it was, he was just having severe headaches.? 

MacGill recalled 

Meanwhile, Australia recalled leg-spinner Stuart MacGill and allrounder Shane Watson to the squad for the third Test, allowing Brett Lee to play domestic cricket on the weekend. 

The third Test starts in Sydney on Sunday. Lee has been the 12th man for Australia in the last seven Test matches since returning from time out for an ankle operation. (AGENCIES)

Faisalabad: A majestic, undefeated 131 from Sanath Jayasuriya put Sri Lanka in the driving seat against Pakistan on the third day of the first Test on Friday. 

Appearing in his 93rd Test, Jayasuriya reeled out his 13th Test hundred to allow Sri Lanka to finish on 285 for three at the close, an overall lead of 264. The 35-year-old reached his hundred in style in the final session lofting leg-spinner Danish Kaneria for a six over mid-wicket. 

Having survived a caught behind off a no-ball from Shoaib Akhtar when he was on nine, Jayasuriya had added 69 with Thilan Samaraweera (15) at the close. His 100 came from 164 balls in 278 minutes with 13 fours and a six. 

In the final session in which the Lankans added exactly 100, Mahela Jayawardene was out caught behind for 57 after getting a faint edge to Kaneria. 

Jayasuriya, who struggled for a brief period as he neared his century, was savage afterwards hitting Abdul Razzaq for three fours in one over. 

Sri Lanka had started their second innings badly with skipper Maravan Atapattu collecting a pair when Shoaib again trapped him leg before. But the Sri Lankans showed more resilience after being bowled out for 243 in the first innings. 

Pakistan, in reply, could manage 264 losing their last two wickets on Friday for eight to enjoy only a 21-run advantage.

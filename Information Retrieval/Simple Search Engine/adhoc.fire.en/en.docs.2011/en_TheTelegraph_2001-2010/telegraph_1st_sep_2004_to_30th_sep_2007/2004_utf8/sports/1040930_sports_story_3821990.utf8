Chennai: Karun Chandhok will have a fine opportunity to further his motor sports aspirations when he gets to race alongside compatriot Narain Karthikeyan in the remaining four races of the Formula Nissan World Series this season. 

With ace Karthikeyan competing in Formula Nissan class since 2001, the inclusion of Chandhok will help form the Team India concept for Tata RC Motorsport Team and both will compete under the colours of a consortium headed by JK Tyres. 

?I have decided not to continue in Formula 3 racing and will skip the remaining six events. I will straightaway compete in the last four races of the World Series of Formula Nissan to be held in Spain, the 20-year old Chandhok said here Wednesday. 

Chandhok had a short test with the Italy-based Tata RC squad last week in Barcelona, doing 80 laps and the team owner, Francesco Rivera had said: ?I would say Karun was about a second off Narain in the other car. We are looking forward to carrying on our partnership with India?s drivers.? 

Chandhok said he had strengthened his fitness regime and driving alongside Narain gave him new motivation. ?It is going to be hard for success as I have done only 390 km of driving whereas Narain and other leading drivers, including Bernoldi, have done almost 15,000 km in the last three years. It is a plus point for me that I could learn a lot from Narain. 

?I still have age on my side and after two or three years of racing in this class, I shall endeavour to enter Formula One.? (PTI)

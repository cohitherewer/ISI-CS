The Telegraph - Calcutta

India?s return to form bad news for SA

Stump Vision

Ian Healy

India are now bad news for South Africa because the 

disruptions are nearly all overcome. They have had some tough cricket coming off 

a break and will be ready to play closer to their potential. It will be another 

cracker of a series that will feel easier for India because of the great pressure 

the Aussies were able to apply.

I have not seen a real rapport between an Indian opening 

pair very often. Virender Sehwag and Akash Chopra started something in Australia 

but it was all about survival. There needs to be a close bond formed at the top 

between two men who should do anything for each other ? a real joy for each other?s 

success and something that is palpable by the opposition. At present, India lose 

too many early wickets and don?t recover easily.

Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, Sourav Ganguly and 

V.V.S. Laxman may be batting masters, but it does not seem to rub off on others. 

It must intimidate because the development of great talent seems to take a long 

time. Yuvraj Singh, Mohammed Kaif and Chopra would be three examples, though all 

three are good players. The seniors must assert themselves to nurture as well 

as get their own game right because in this series they played a big part in the 

loss. The quick bowlers are genuine and should travel the world very effectively. 

To do this they must continue to get strong in relevant parts of their bodies 

and stay on the field.

 Anil Kumble

There is a very good group of four or five ready to 

go, and once they offer more than just support-play to the spinners at home, the 

team will come of age and possibly inspire many youngsters. Zaheer Khan matched 

the Australian skill in the fourth Test and will learn plenty from that great 

effort and now needs some help. Overseas they should be as good as any attack 

in the world but have not shown it yet.

Plenty was asked of the Indian spinners and they delivered 

in patches. This did not surprise me as they were well short of match play in 

the lead-up to this crunch series. This is where most of the trouble could come 

for South Africa. With India coming off a stunning two-day win after such a tough 

series, anything from here will seem light to Harbhajan Singh and Anil Kumble.

The huge wicket-taking performance by Kumble had the 

Aussies crumbling, but allowed his career record to be analysed at length. What 

a great player he has been, with the demeanour to go with it. He is one of the 

world?s most admired cricketers and at times slips under the radar of the superstars.

Good team spirit is certainly there in the camp but 

the injury disruptions just detracted from the impenetrable team unity that was 

in Australia. It especially needs to return under pressure.

What a culture this Australian team now offers new 

players. They have won the big series that they were after despite having to replace 

their captain and Darren Lehmann, arguably their best player of spin. 

Young players like Michael Clarke, Simon Katich and 

Nathan Hauritz were thrown into the cauldron and performed. Matthew Hayden and 

Justin Langer?s opening success hit a plateau this series even though it was not 

a disaster. They will surely love the green of the Gabba and New Zealand may feel 

their return in their two-Test series starting next Thursday.

The middle-order performed brilliantly, whereby someone 

always got the job done. Katich, Clarke and Damien Martyn were superb and when 

they were not, it was Darren Lehmann and Adam Gilchrist who drove it home. This 

depth and continuous good form has made the Australians look invincible for a 

long time. They are so difficult to keep down after a couple of early wickets. 

Gilchrist?s gloves were fantastic in all but one match and his fourth Test recovery 

in this department showed experience and class, not to mention the top job he 

did as captain.

Australia?s quicks were right up there with the best 

attack ever. They never let up, they seemed to own their plans and committed to 

them. This year the plans were right, having got them wrong in Australia last 

summer. It was the most impressive part of the team?s play when no one expected 

such impact and India?s daunting batting line-up was nowhere.

Warne was battling against his deeds of the past in 

India and high expectations, but did well. (PTI)

 Federer lights up rainy day

Houston: World No. 1 Roger Federer confirmed his fitness with a dazzling 6-3, 6-4 late-night win over Lleyton Hewitt on Wednesday, providing a bright finish to a miserable rainy day at the ATP Masters Cup. 

The win improved Federer?s record to 2-0 and guarantees him a spot in Saturday?s semi-finals, while Hewitt can clinch a place in the final-four with a win over Gaudio in his final round-robin match. 

Having not played since straining his left thigh muscle preparing for his home tournament in Basel a month ago, Federer?s fitness was the big question hanging over the $4.4 million season finale. 

A victory over Gaudio in his opening round-robin match eased some concern, but Federer?s clinical dissection of his Australian rival in 75 minutes confirmed the 23-year-old Swiss was back playing the sublime tennis that carried him to three Grand Slam titles in 2004. 

Behind a spectacular assortment of winners, Federer extended his domination over Hewitt and has now swept all five of their meetings this season, including a three-set demolition in the US Open final. 

?I played a good match, not as good as the US Open but this is just my second match in a long time so you cannot expect to play as well as in the US Open final,? said Federer. 

After tornado warnings and torrential rain, play finally got underway after an eight-hour delay with Spain?s Carlos Moya ending French Open champion Gaston Gaudio?s hopes of a Masters title easing past the Argentine 6-3, 6-4.

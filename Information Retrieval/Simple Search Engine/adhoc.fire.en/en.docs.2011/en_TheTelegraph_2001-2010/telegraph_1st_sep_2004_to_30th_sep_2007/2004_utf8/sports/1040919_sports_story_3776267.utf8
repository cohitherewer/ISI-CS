 City SAI teams withdraw 

 - SUBROTO CUP - Medical tests reveal overaged U-14, U-17 sides 

 A CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi: The Sports Authority of India (SAI) 

 Sports Training Centre, Calcutta withdrew its under-14 and 

 under-17 teams from the Subroto Cup for being overaged. 

 The stringent medical tests, including X-rays, were 

 conducted at SAI Eastern Centre Calcutta. When found that 

 the entire under-17 squad being trained by coach Uttam Ghosh 

 was overaged, SAI voluntarily decided to withdraw their 

 squad. The side did not travel to Delhi to participate in 

 the tournament. However, the organisers were informed of 

 this just a day before their scheduled match. 

SAI, Calcutta were the inter-SAI champions in both the under-14 and under-17 categories. The medical tests revealed that eight players of the under-14 side were also overaged and, hence, their entry was also withdrawn. 

SAI, Calcutta were due to play their group VIII under-17 league match against Rabbani High School, Nagpur on Saturday. However, the secretary of the Subroto Cup, Wing Cdr Rahul Pathak was informed Friday evening by senior SAI football coach Rohit Prasher, who is looking after these schemes, about the decision to withdraw the Calcutta-based units. Prashar received a fax from the deputy director of SAI in Calcutta stating the reasons for the withdrawal. The group will now have just four teams. 

[SAI Eastern Centre director-in-charge S.K. Borgohain was unavailable for comment, says a Staff Reporter in Calcutta.] 

Prasher informed that SAI has decided to embark on a new course and induct players in their schemes (under-14 and under-17) only after strict medical tests. He said that instead of being humiliated by having players scratched during an age-group competition, it was decided from this year onwards, to conduct tests before the competition. Hence the chief football coach at SAI, Calcutta H.N. Das was informed about the same. 

The malaise of overaged players in the ongoing Subroto Cup has reached unprecedented depths this year. So far, 75 players have been scratched for being overaged both in under-14 and under-17 competition. 

 In group A of the under-14 Subroto Cup, the representative 

 school from Manipur ? Wangjing Secondary School, Thoubal 

 ? had to return without playing match as 15 of their players 

 were found to be overaged.

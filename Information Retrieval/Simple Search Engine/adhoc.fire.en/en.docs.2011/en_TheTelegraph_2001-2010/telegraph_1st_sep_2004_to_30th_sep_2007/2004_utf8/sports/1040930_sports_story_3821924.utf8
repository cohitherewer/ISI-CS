The Telegraph - Calcutta

 How the king was made

 INDRANIL MAJUMDAR 

 Ranbir Singh Mahendra is ecstatic after the casting vote gives him the power at the BCCI AGM at a city hotel on Wednesday 

Calcutta: A day of high drama and behind-the-scenes activity culminated in ruling group candidate Ranbir Singh Mahendra winning by the casting vote in the end. The following is a chronological order of the events that unfolded during the day: 

 10.40 am: Members 

 at the AGM learn that the BCCI has moved court, demanding 

 a stay on Justice (Retd) S. Mohan?s acting as a ?commissioner? 

 during the elections. Justice Mohan wants a copy of the 

 order in hand and informs the house that he will not act 

 on a lawyer?s notice. 

 Raj Singh Dungarpur sees 

 it as a desperate attempt by Jagmohan Dalmiya and Co. to 

 stop their winning the elections. He comes out of the meeting 

 to say that the number of votes in favour of Sharad Pawar 

 are growing. ?We have the numbers and its growing. We are 

 assured of 17 votes and it is likely to reach 19. A number 

 of people from the Dalmiya camp have defected. Why do you 

 think one wants to stop the third umpire from officiating 

 unless one is desperate to win?? he asked. 

 11.10 am: A lawyer 

 reads out a Chennai city civil court order on a case filed 

 by Bharti Cricket Club of Chennai, restraining the BCCI 

 from passing any resolution that could enable Dalmiya to 

 be made patron-in-chief of the Board. This restraining order 

 stands till October 11. 

 12.10 pm: As the 

 stay order on Justice Mohan hasn?t yet been received, the 

 meeting is adjourned till 2 pm. There is confusion over 

 who will represent Maharashtra and Rajasthan as two persons 

 from each state unit are claiming to be the representatives. 

 12.30 pm: Justice 

 Mohan says there is still lot of drama left. 

 2.15 pm: The stay 

 order hasn?t yet arrived and the meeting is adjourned till 

 4 pm. 

 2.50 pm: Pawar decides 

 to address the press. ?The Chennai high court has not stopped 

 the meeting,? Pawar says. ?The court has only appointed 

 a commissioner to see that elections are smooth and impartial. 

 I don?t think this is an interference by the judiciary in 

 any case. 

?Why is the meeting adjourned again and again and the process of election delayed? It clearly indicates that the ones worried about the numbers want to postpone the meeting every two hours. The majority is not with the present group. Those concerned with numbers are doing this? he alleged. 

Asked if there was any effort from any quarter to make him withdraw from the elections, Pawar said: ?Some (sic) of the electronic media has some vested interests. They are airing wrong information with vicious intentions. May be they have launched a campaign.? 

What happens if the groups agree to him as president? ?If it is unopposed, why will they postpone it every two hours?? Pawar asked. 

 4.05 pm: The court 

 stay order on Justice Mohan is received by fax. 

 4.20 pm: Justice 

 Mohan leaves the meeting after reading through the order. 

 ?There is no question of being satisfied. It?s a court order 

 and in accordance with the rules,? he says. 

 4.30 pm: Jagmohan 

 Dalmiya retires to a separate chamber to seek legal opinion 

 on the disputed representatives from the two states. ?We 

 can win even without their votes,? Dungarpur says. 

 4.35 pm: The Maharastra 

 Cricket Association representatives Dhyaneshwar Agashe and 

 B. Thorve leave after being told to do so. Agashe had come 

 here without consulting the two court-appointed observers 

 (B.G. Deshmukh and M.N. Singh) or valid authorisation from 

 them. 

Thorve is jubilant. ?I had come here to oust Agashe. I have fulfilled my mission. I?m not bothered if MCA is not represented at the AGM.? 

It?s also decided that Kishor Rungta will represent Rajasthan. 

 4.45 pm: The AGM 

 finally convenes. 

 6.30 pm: Word pours 

 out that there has been a tie and Ranbir has won by the 

 casting vote. Accordingly, the election to the other posts 

 are also held simultaneously but the much-talked about election 

 has ended with tension and excitement.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Chaos rules at nets 

 - Hundreds of fans invade Green Park 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Kanpur: The lead-up to the first Test has already seen an SP being removed for breach of the teams? security. However, more heads probably need to roll if the Indian and South African cricketers? stay here is to be incident free. 

Unbelievably, hundreds of so-called fans managed to get past the cops and hampered the teams? nets on Friday morning. Amazingly, at a time when the brass was holding a meeting at Green Park itself! 

Nobody, it seems, has a specific role. ?The higher-ups are the ones to answer questions,? explained an officer, shrugging shoulders, when asked by The Telegraph to comment on the chaos. 

The higher-ups, though, were behind closed doors. 

Ironically, Match Referee Jeff Crowe as also umpires Daryl Harper and Simon Taufel found themselves locked in when, in fact, the gatecrashers should have been locked out. 

The trio had to wait for a good five minutes till somebody with the key to the players? gate was traced. ?Jaldi karo, jaldi karo,? implored Taufel, much to the amusement of Crowe and compatriot Harper. 

As for Team India captain Sourav Ganguly, he chose a novel way to ?beat? the dozens who chased him on the way back to the dressing room after a Media conference: ?Arre, Tendulkar ko pakro, Tendulkar ko pakro... Mere peeche aa raha hai...? 

Well, some fell for the bait, others didn?t. The chaos, however, didn?t lessen.

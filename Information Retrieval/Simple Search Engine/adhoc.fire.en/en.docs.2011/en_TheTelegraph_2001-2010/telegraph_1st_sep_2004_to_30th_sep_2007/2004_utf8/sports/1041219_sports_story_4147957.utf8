 Harbhajan not aiming for records

Chittagong: Harbhajan Singh may have got himself closer to legendary Erapally Prasanna?s tally of 189 wickets, but the off-spinner says he is more focussed on playing for the country as long as possible rather than aim for records. 

Harbhajan, who needs two more wickets to equal Prasanna?s tally, said: ?Let me get those wickets first, but it would be nice to become India?s leading off-spinner. I am looking forward to bowl Sunday,? he said. ?I am just 24. So I don?t want to look at that few wickets. My dream is to play for India as long as possible.? 

Bangladesh fast bowler Mashrafee Murtaza was delighted at grabbing Sachin Tendulkar?s wicket and the 21-year-old said: ?It was a surprise delivery. I planned at bowling an inswinger and it came out very well.? 

Sachin was trapped plumb in front when he was rapped on the pads by a sharp in cutter from Murtaza. ?It is very inspiring for any bowler to get a wicket off the first ball,? said Murtaza, who had consistently troubled the Indian batsmen with his pace in the series. ?The wicket was flat, so I was advised to stick to a line to contain the run flow. 

?Sachin?s wicket would be memorable, but the delivery that got Rahul Dravid was the best.? Dravid, well set on 160, was lured by a ball that dragged him outside the off stump for a thick edge to wicketkeeper Khaled Mashud.

 Kapil: No excuse can justify defeat in Nagpur

 - Former skipper wants everybody to ponder over what went wrong in planning 

NILESH BHATTACHARYA

Calcutta: Many held the greenish wicket in Nagpur responsible for helping Australia end a 35-year-old jinx, but for one Mr Kapil Dev, this is nothing but a weak defence against a ?bad? defeat. 

The World Cup-winning captain wants everybody, creating such brouhaha over ?missing out on home advantage?, to just shut up and ponder over what went wrong in terms of planning and execution. 

?You should never look for excuse to justify a defeat. Stop all this talk of home advantage,? the Indian legend said at the Eden Gardens on Saturday. 

Kapil admitted that he didn?t thoroughly follow the Nagpur Test, in which Australia thrashed India by 342 runs en route to winning the series on Indian soil for the first time since 1969. But he minced no words in stating what he ?as a follower of the game for quite some time? believed. 

?True, sometimes you have a good day or bad day. This is part and parcel of the game. But what irks me are those pretexts often used to defend a defeat,? Kapil, who was felicitated by the BCCI during the match, maintained. 

Kapil, chosen by Wisden as the Best Indian Cricketer of the Century, had a piece of advice for Sachin Tendulkar. 

?The best of Sachin can be achieved from his attacking mood. I?m not a medical person and therefore, don?t want to sit on judgement speculating how he would perform post-tennis elbow injury. 

?But I really miss something whenever I see him playing in a cautious mode. Don?t forget, he?s the game?s greatest batsman in contemporary times and should be playing the way that suits him most ? an out and out assault on any kind of bowling. He seemed to be in top gear today, going after the bowling right from the start. His end (a suicidal run-out on 16) was sad but it was an attacking Sachin all along and that?s what delighted me,? the revered allrounder said. 

Query on Sachin?s comparison with Brian Lara cropped up and Kapil hit it for an overboundary. ?If Lara wants to be No.1, he has to be consistent and play like No.1.? 

The former Indian captain, however, linked frequent injuries to an overcrowded schedule. He described Irfan Pathan as a future asset. 

?If Pathan can keep himself fit, he can be an asset to India,? was how the legend assessed the youngster?s prospects. 

Kapil described Sunil Gavaskar?s association with Team India as batting consultant, as a ?welcome move?. 

?Having a player of Sunny?s calibre in the dressing room is always an encouraging sign. The boys look up to him and can draw enough inspiration. 

?There are so many things to be learnt from him. Sunny?s presence can only serve Team India better,? remarked the World Cup winning captain. 

Kapil, however, ruled out any immediate possibility of seeing himself as a Team India member. ?The Board hasn?t given me any offer in this regard. 

?Moreover, I like the job that I can enjoy,? the legend signed off.

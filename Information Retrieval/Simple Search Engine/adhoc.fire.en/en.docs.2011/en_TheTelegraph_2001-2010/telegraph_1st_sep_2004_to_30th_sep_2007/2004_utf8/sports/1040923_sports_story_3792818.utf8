 Inzy gamble fails as WI reach final

Southampton: Underdogs West Indies put themselves within sniffing distance of their first major title in many years with a clinical seven-wicket demolition of Pakistan in the Champions Trophy semi-final at the Rose Bowl on Wednesday. 

After skittling out Pakistan for 131 in 38.2 overs, West Indies cantered home in 28.1 overs to set up a summit clash with England at The Oval on Saturday. Pakistan never really looked to be in the game after suffering a sensational batting collapse which saw the team lose last six wickets for just 31 runs after being placed at 100 for four at one stage. 

Inzamam paid the price for electing to bat on a fast-paced track in overcast conditions as Pakistan batsmen failed to apply themselves. They started on a disastrous note, losing their first wicket with just one run on the board, and never really recovered with the West Indies striking crucial blows at regular intervals. 

 Man-of-the-Match Ramnaresh

 Rose Bowl on Wednesday

The in-form Ramnaresh Sarwan starred in the West Indies run-chase with an unbeaten 85-ball 56 and fittingly hit the winning runs to send the handful of West Indies supporters in frenzy. Captain Brian Lara chipped in with a 30-ball 31 before retiring hurt. 

Pakistan raised hopes of a spirited fightback when Shoaib Akhtar, who breathed fire in helpful conditions, got rid of the top two West Indies batsmen in a fiery first spell. 

But he failed to get support from the other end and with the target hardly intimidating, the Caribbeans launched an aggressive chase to romp home. 

West Indies overcame the early loss of Chris Gayle (1) and Wavell Hinds (5) before displaying some really aggressive batting to seize the initiative completely from the Pakistan. Sarwan hit two fours off Mohammed Sami before picking the same bowler for a six and a four in his third over. Lara also looked in great touch, hitting three fours in an over by Abdul Razzaq to raise the 50 run partnership for the third wicket with Sarwan in just 49 balls. 

But Lara?s exploits met a premature end when he took his eyes off a Shoaib Akhtar missile and suffered a blow just under his ears. With the West Indies already cruising at 76 for two in 15 overs at that stage, Lara decided to return to the pavilion. His cameo included five fours. (PTI)

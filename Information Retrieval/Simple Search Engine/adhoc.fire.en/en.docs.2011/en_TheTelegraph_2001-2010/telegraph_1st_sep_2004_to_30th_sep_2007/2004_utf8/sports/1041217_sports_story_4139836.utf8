The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Md. AC face BMFC in semi-finals

A CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: An opportunistic header by nippy striker Ari Benjamin saw city club Mohammedan AC scrape past Titanium (Kerala) 1-0 in a group B match of the 16th Lal Bahadur Shastri Memorial football meet on Thursday. 

Mohammedan A.C. thus collected with six points from three matches to reach the last four stage. They finished second in their group. 

The Calcutta club will take on Bengal Mumbai Football Club (BMFC) in the first semi-final on Friday. 

Titanium, despite losing on Thursday, topped Group A with superior goal difference. They also finished with six points. 

The Kerala side will face Tata Football Academy (TFA) in the second semi final on Saturday. 

Needing at least a draw to qualify, Mohammedan A.C. played attacking football and were rewarded in the 11th minute when striker Arup Kumar Sarkar?s measured cross was headed in by an unmarked Benjamin. 

Arup, Benjamin and attacking midfielder Rana Guha troubled Titanium?s defence with their speed and clever passing. 

The Calcutta side, however, appeared a little blunt in the second half, when Arup left the field with a head injury. He was rushed to hospital. He was complaining of diziness. 

In an earlier match, TFA also qualified for the semis, beating Jammu and Kashmir Bank 2-0, with second half goals by strikers Robert Lathalmuna (47) and Vimal Periyar (53). TFA, with six points, finished second in their group. 

Friday?s semi final: BMFC (Mumbai) vs Mohammedan A.C. (Calcutta).

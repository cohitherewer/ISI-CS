 Full Speed may lift Mysore Derby on Sunday 

 WILLIAM TELL

 Mysore: Eight runners will face the starter for the 2,000m Poonawalla Mysore Derby here on Sunday. However, on their recent form, the three horses who may be involved at the finish could be Full Speed, Adesina and Queen Of Fashion.

 Their performance during the Bangalore summer season has also been exceptionally good. But it is Irfan Ghatala?s ward Full Speed, who finished third in the Bangalore Colts and also in the Derby, who is tipped to come through in a close finish. Ms Silva Storai partners the Burden Of Proof-Speedy Beauty three-year-old colt.

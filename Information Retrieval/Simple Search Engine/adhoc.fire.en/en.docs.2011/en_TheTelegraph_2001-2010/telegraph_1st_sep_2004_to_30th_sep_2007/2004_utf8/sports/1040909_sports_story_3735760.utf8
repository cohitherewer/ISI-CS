 Diego to face Cuba confinement 

 - Legend?s family sees a ?strict father? in Castro 

Havana: World Cup winner Diego Maradona will face stricter treatment for cocaine addiction when he returns to Cuba, probably late Wednesday, Argentine ambassador Raul Abraham Taleb said Tuesday. 

Maradona?s family will ask Cuban leader Fidel Castro to be a ?strict father? to the former Argentine captain, whose treatment at a Havana mental institution will be supervised by a Cuban judge, Taleb said. 

?He will probably arrive tomorrow,? the ambassador said at a news conference. ?He will come with his father, his personal doctor Alfredo Cahe, and not people who encouraged him to continue taking drugs. ?They will ask Castro to use his friendship with Maradona to become a strict father.? 

Maradona?s family forced him to enter a psychiatric clinic in Argentina in May after he was rushed to intensive care in April with a swollen heart and breathing problems. 

An Argentine judge allowed Maradona to leave the clinic on the outskirts of Buenos Aires Monday to continue treatment elsewhere and the 43-year-old was planning to return to Cuba, which he has made his second home in recent years. 

This time Maradona will be confined to the Center for Mental Health (CENSAM) and denied privileges and the freedom to eat and drink at will until he is cured, the ambassador said. 

For almost four years, Maradona lived at Havana?s La Pradera health farm, where he partied with friends while playing golf almost daily at the Cuban capital?s only golf club. 

?He will be under control at CENSAM, because the prestige of Cuban medical treatment is at stake,? Taleb said. 

The Center, which advertises itself as a place for ?curing mental illnesses and addictions,? has an enclosed compound of bungalows and gardens run by Cuba?s interior ministry in a leafy suburb of Havana. 

Maradona, one of the most gifted players in the history of soccer who led Argentina to victory at the 1986 World Cup, said he has been fighting drug addiction for much of the last 20 years. (Agencies)

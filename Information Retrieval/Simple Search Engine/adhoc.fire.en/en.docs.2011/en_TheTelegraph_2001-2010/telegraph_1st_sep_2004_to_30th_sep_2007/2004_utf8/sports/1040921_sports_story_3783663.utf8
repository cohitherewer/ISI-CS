The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Paes-Stepanek lifts crown 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Even as Mahesh Bhupathi is utilising 

a break to strengthen his relationship with Calcutta, Leander Paes is busy winning 

matches and titles thousands of kilometres from his birthplace. 

Playing with Czech Radek Stepanek for the first time 

in his illustrious career, Paes capped a dream week by lifting the Delray Beach 

doubles crown. According to information received here, second seeds Paes and Stepanek 

dismissed No. 1 seeds Gaston Etlis and Martin Rodriguez 6-0, 6-3 on Sunday. 

This was the Indian maestro?s 31st career doubles triumph ? fourth this year, two of which have come with regular partner David Rikl and one with Bhupathi. 

Paes thus retained the Delray Beach title. Last year, when the tournament was held in March, he had teamed up with Croatian Nenad Zimonjic to emerge champions. 

The most remarkable aspect of Paes-Stepanek?s triumph was the fact that the first-time partners didn?t drop a single set in four matches. Paes, who lost the US Open doubles final with Rikl, has now won nine of his last 10 matches. 

His next ?target? will be to qualify for the November 

year-end Masters championship. Paes and Rikl, currently No. 8 in the ATP Doubles 

Race, need to move up at least one slot to ensure a Masters berth.

Karachi: Leg-spinner Danish Kaneria captured six wickets to leave Pakistan on the brink of a series levelling win against Sri Lanka on the fourth day of the second Test on Sunday. 

Battling centuries from Sanath Jayasuriya and Kumar Sangakkara failed to stop Kaneria from reducing the Sri Lankans to 361 for seven as the visitors gained a slim advantage of just 91 runs at the close. 

Kaneria finished with six for 102 as Sri Lanka collapsed from a comfortable position of 333 for three. 

With no specialist batsman left at the crease, the Sri Lankans face an uphill task on the final day to save the Test. 

In a remarkable final session of play after Jayasuriya (107) and Sangakkara (138) had held the innings together, Pakistan captured four wickets for 27 runs. Kaneria, playing in his 20th Test, captured his sixth five-wicket haul. 

Sri Lanka lead the two match series having won the first Test in Faisalabad by 201 runs. 

Kaneria tormented the batsmen throughout the day and triggered the collapse by having Thilan Samaraweera caught at slip by Younis Khan. 

Debutant Rana Naved rekindled hopes of a win when he claimed his first Test victim, the prized scalp of Sangakkara, just seven overs before the close. Sangakkara, who reached his seventh hundred in the first over after tea, batted for nearly six hours and faced 251 balls in an innings which included 20 fours and one six. 

He reached triple figures with two flowing cover drives off Abdul Razzaq but was out after snicking the ball. 

Kaneria than had Jehan Mubarak caught at leg slip off an inside edge for two and bowled Romesh Kaluwitharana for seven to swing the match Pakistan?s way. 

Pakistan had to toil hard in the three sessions on an easy paced track. Jayasuriya required just six balls to get the four runs required for his 14th Test century during the morning session when Sri Lanka resumed on 134 for one. 

The 35-year-old cut Shoaib Malik to reach his hundred from just 110 balls with 14 fours and a six. But he fell soon after miscuing a sweep shot off Kaneria to Malik at square leg. 

Kaneria, who has made such a big impression, wants to follow in the footsteps of Abdul Qadir and Mushtaq Ahmed by becoming a regular match-winning bowler for Pakistan. ?I have always looked up to them. I grew up watching Qadir bowl and studied his video tapes a lot,? Kaneria said after Day IV?s action. 

?When I started playing top level cricket Mushtaq helped and encouraged me,? Kaneria added. ?I always wanted to be a leg spinner and I took inspiration from Qadir, while Mushtaq guided me in the team. My ambition is to seek a permanent place in the team now,? he said. 

Qadir played 67 Tests for Pakistan taking 236 wickets, while Mushtaq has a Test haul of 185 in 52 matches. 

Kaneria has now taken 86 wickets in 20 Tests with six five-wicket hauls. 

Inzy advised rest 

Meanwhile, Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq has been advised to rest for a week after a back injury prevented him fielding on the fourth day. ?It is a back strain and doctors have advised me to rest for four to six days.?

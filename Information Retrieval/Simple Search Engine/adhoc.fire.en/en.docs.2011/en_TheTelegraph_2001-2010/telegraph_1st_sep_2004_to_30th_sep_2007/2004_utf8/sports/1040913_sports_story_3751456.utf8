Barrichello triumphs

 Barrichello after winning the Italian GP on Sunday 

Monza (Italy): Brazilian Rubens Barrichello led a Ferrari one-two in the Italian Grand Prix on Sunday to trigger a homecoming party for the Formula One champions. Barrichello took the chequered flag for the first time since last season?s final race in Japan, a mere 1.3 seconds ahead of teammate Michael Schumacher. 

Schumacher clinched an unprecedented seventh drivers? crown in Belgium two weeks ago. Ferrari were parading in front of their home fans with a sixth successive constructors? championship also secured. 

It was Barrichello?s eighth career win, and Ferrari?s 13th in 15 races this year, and it came from pole despite a gamble on tyre choice that looked to have backfired for both Ferrari drivers early in the race. 

Briton Jenson Button was third for BAR after leading for 24 of the 53 laps, ahead of Japanese teammate Takuma Sato. 

Colombian Juan Pablo Montoya was fifth for Williams with McLaren?s David Coulthard sixth and Brazilian Antonio Pizzonia seventh for Williams.

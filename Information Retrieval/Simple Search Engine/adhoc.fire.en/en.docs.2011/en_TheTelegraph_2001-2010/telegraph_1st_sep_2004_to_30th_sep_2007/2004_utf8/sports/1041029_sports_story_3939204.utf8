New Delhi: Kerala defeated a gritty Services team to secure their entry in the final of the 59th Indian Oil Corporation (IOC)-Santosh Trophy on Thursday. In an absorbing first semi-final, the team from South defeated the Services 2-0 to make their 12th entry into the title round. 

Midfielder Abdul Naushad and substitute striker Naushad Pari scored the winning goals, one in each half. Kerala will now meet the winner of the second semi-final between holders Manipur and six times champions Punjab, in the final on Sunday. 

It was a tale of missed chances for both sides. The teams played open, attacking football and there was end-to-end action. That Services did not concede more goals was due to the heroics of N. Abungobi Singh, the 26-year-old goalkeeper, who was chosen man-of the match. 

 Kerala forged ahead in the 28th minute. M.A. Abdul Hakeem sent a cross from the right and Naushad, darting in from the blind side, scored with a first time shot in the penalty area. Stung by this reversal, Services sprung into attack. 

Shaji?s booming right footer kissed the crosspiece and went over. However Services, who won the crown back in 1960, suffered a cruel blow when playmaker T. Ragho Kumar was ejected in the 41st minute for two yellow cards. 

Kerala?s numerical advantage got nullified in the 71st minute when junior international N.P. Pradeep, playing as left back, had to leave the field for his second bookable offence. 

Kerala sealed the fate of the match in added time. Substitute T. Usman sent a low diagonal pass to Pari. Pari moved up unchecked and placed past the Services custodian.

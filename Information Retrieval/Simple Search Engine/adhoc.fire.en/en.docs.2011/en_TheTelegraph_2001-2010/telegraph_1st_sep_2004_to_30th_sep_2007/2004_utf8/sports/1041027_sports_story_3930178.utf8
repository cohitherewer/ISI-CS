Nagpur: If Australia manage to return home undefeated, they will owe a lot to one Mr Damien Martyn. After a match-saving century in Chennai, now comes the fluent 114 that has given them fresh hopes on the opening day of the third Test. 

?I wanted to stay positive and keep the partnerships going. I?ll be happy if we manage to get 450-plus tomorrow,? said Martyn later. 

Martyn felt the wicket will be ?positive? for the Australian pacers. ?The wicket is the one we?re used to back home. It?s got some grass in it and there?s some bounce too. Zaheer bowled well later in the day. It will be positive for our quicks who are going to get some assistance,? he remarked. 

He doesn?t wish to compare his two centuries. ?The two can never be compared since they were in different circumstances. In the second Test, we were in trouble and it was great to get a partnership going with Gillespie. The wicket was in bad shape. 

?Today?s was on a first day Test match wicket. It?s been a rather satisfying day except for the couple of wickets we lost later in the day. That was disappointing,? he explained. 

But how disappointing was it getting out trying to lift Anil Kumble out of the ground after hitting a six two balls earlier? ?I always stay positive whatever the circumstances. I look to play my shots. Things were a lot harder in the last Test, but here it?s only the first day. But it?s a bit disappointing, no doubt...? 

Doesn?t Darren Lehmann?s 70 here complicate things when Ricky Ponting makes a return in Mumbai? ?It?s probably a good thing there?s so much competition in the side. No doubt, it?s going to be a tough call, but it?s good that the guys are doing well,? Martyn said. 

For Murali Kartik, getting to play a Test match after nine months has been a big break. He last played the Sydney Test in January. The left-arm spinner, who finished with three for 57, however, has no regrets. 

?The last tour was Pakistan, so I wouldn?t say nine months, but the best thing is to play for your country. And every time you play for your country, you try and make the most of it. Actually, I wouldn?t say make the most of it, but rather give it your best shot... It?s not every day that you do brilliantly well, but as long as you feel you gave it your best shot after a shower at the end of the day, it feels good,? Kartik said. 

When did he know that the ?break? would finally happen here? ?I only got to know this morning that I was playing for sure. But I was sort of kept on standby since Harbhajan (Singh) wasn?t well and knew I would be playing for sure if he didn?t recover.? 

Would he term Tuesday?s performance as the best in his six-Test old career? ?I wouldn?t put it that way. Different days throw up different things and you also begin to look at it from a different perspective,? he told The Telegraph. 

He doesn?t wish to blame anyone for getting few chances. ?I wouldn?t say it has been painful. But the way my career has shaped up, I?ve always been in the shadows of Anil (Kumble) and Harbhajan. Those two have done exceptionally well for the country and I?ll have to bide my time and make the most of the opportunities that I do get.? 

Kartik said the memories of the Aussie assault in Sydney (he had figures of 19-1-122-0 in the first innings) never came to his mind when he bowled on Tuesday. ?Every game is different. I don?t keep such things in mind because you can always take the good things into a game and leave the negative ones behind.? 

He felt Darren Lehmann and Adam Gilchrist?s wickets gave him the most satisfaction. ?Lehmann?s wicket came at a time when we weren?t getting breakthroughs. But Gilchrist?s wicket was also important ? we all know how dangerous he can be. Gilchrist and Clarke took the game away from us in Bangalore. I think getting Gilchrist cheaply was important.? 

Does his new-look hairstyle (he?s got a grayish tinge to his hair) have something to do with the performance? ?It?s got nothing to do with luck. Actually it?s my salt and pepper look,? he quipped.

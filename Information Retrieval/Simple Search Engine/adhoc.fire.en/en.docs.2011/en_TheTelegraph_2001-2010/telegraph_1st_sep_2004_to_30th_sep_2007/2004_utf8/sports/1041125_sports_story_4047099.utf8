London: Manchester United and Bayern Munich advanced to the first knockout round of the Champions League, while Raul scored a historic goal for Real Madrid to save his side from a home defeat on Tuesday. 

Manchester United beat Olympique Lyon 2-1 at Old Trafford to give manager Alex Ferguson a winning night to remember in his 1,000th match in charge of the club. 

Both teams have qualified from group D with Fenerbahce?s 1-0 win at Sparta Prague in the same group sealing their consolation spot in the Uefa Cup. United went ahead after 19 minutes at Old Trafford when defender Gary Neville ended a scramble in the Lyon goal mouth with a crashing drive into the net. 

Lyon replied when Mahamadou Diarra?s long-range shot was fumbled by ?keeper Roy Carroll five minutes before the break. But Ferguson?s side sealed the win after 53 minutes when Ruud van Nistelrooy headed home his 36th Champions League goal for United. 

In Madrid, Raul pulled level with Real legend Alfredo Di Stefano in first place in the all-time list when he equalised in the 70th minute of their group B match against Bayer Leverkusen. 

It has taken Raul 94 games to achieve his total ? Di Stefano did it in 58 games between 1955 and 1964 ? and the current Real favourite could well have more than one match to break the record this season after Tuesday?s draw. 

With Dynamo Kiev beating AS Roma 2-0 at home in wintry Kiev in the same group, they have moved on to 10 points from five games. Real and Leverkusen have eight points with AS Roma eliminated from Europe this season on one. 

Bayern Munich have no need take Uefa?s course in mathematical theory to know they have advanced already. Their 5-1 win over Maccabi Tel Aviv means they are through to the last 16 as group C runners-up behind Juventus. 

Juventus chalked up their fifth successive 1-0 win in the group over Ajax Amsterdam in front of just 6,865 fans in Turin leaving Ajax and Maccabi, who are both on three points, scrambling for the Uefa Cup spot. Group A is still to be settled after Olympiakos beat Deportivo La Coruna 1-0 and AS Monaco beat Liverpool 1-0. 

Deportivo are out of European competition but Olympiakos, Monaco and Liverpool are all in contention for the knockout phase.

Norton (Massachusetts): Fijis Vijai Singh fashioned an eight-under par 63 on Saturday to take a two-shot second-round lead on 131 in the Deutsche Bank Championship. 

World No.1 Tiger Woods carded a 68 and is tied for second on nine-under 133 with John Rollins and Bill Haas. 

Singh can become the worlds leading player if Woods, who has held top spot for 334 weeks in total and the last 264 consecutively, fails to finish in the top seven. If Woods makes the top seven, then Singh would need to tie or beat him. 

Everybody keeps talking about it, they keep writing about it, I keep reading about it, Singh said. Im not concerned about it. Its not going to affect me one way or the other if I overtake him or not. What would that change for me? Ill to go out there next week and do it all over again. 

Singh, the world No.2, began the day three shots behind Woods and Palmer but got off to a whirlwind start, making an eagle and a birdie on the first two holes. He also birdied the fourth and seventh holes but bogeyed the eighth to make the turn in four-under. 

Then the 41-year-old, a five-time winner on the PGA Tour this season including lifting the PGA Championship, birdied three of the first four holes on his homeward nine. 

He followed with a birdie-bogey-birdie finish for his 63, the low round of the tournament so far. Singh said his start gave him confidence for the rest of the round. (Reuters)

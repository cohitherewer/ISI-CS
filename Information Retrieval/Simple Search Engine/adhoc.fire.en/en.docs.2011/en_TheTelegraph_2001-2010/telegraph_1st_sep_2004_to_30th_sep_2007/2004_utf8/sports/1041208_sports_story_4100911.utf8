The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Kerala earn 2 points

A CORRESPONDENT

Jamshedpur: A six-wicket haul by Mihir Diwakar and responsible batting by Srikumaran Nair (57) were the highlights of the final day of the Jharkhand-Kerala Ranji Trophy tie which ended in a draw at the Keenan Stadium Tuesday. 

Kerala gained two points from the match by virtue of their first innings lead. Jharkhand take on Orissa in the next tie starting here on December 13. 

The hosts have so far garnered seven points from three matches. Needing 168 runs for a win in 17 overs, Jharkhand finished at 16 for two. Both the captains agreed for a draw after the eighth mandatory over. Maherndra Singh Dhoni and Manish Vardhan remained unbeaten with six runs each. 

Resuming at 18 without loss, Kerala lost some quick wickets in the first session, thanks to Diwakar who utilised the conditions well. 

The medium-pacer first evicted Sebastian Anthony for 8 with an away swinger and later accounted for Mauzam Nathani for 16.

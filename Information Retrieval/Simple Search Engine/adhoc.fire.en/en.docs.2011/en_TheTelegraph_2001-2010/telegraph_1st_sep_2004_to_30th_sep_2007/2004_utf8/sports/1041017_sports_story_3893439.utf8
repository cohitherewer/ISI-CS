Calcutta: Heramba Chandra College annexed the Hardinge Shield inter-college football title defeating Jogesh Chandra Chowdhury College 4-3 via the tie-breaker in the final on Saturday. 

The Calcutta University-organised match, held at an unplayable Marcus Square ground where the locals found it quite convenient to loiter inside the playing arena while the match was on, ended goalless after regulation time. 

The teams tried to give off their best in those testing situations. Jogesh Chandra started the game strongly. 

Their left-winger, Raju Bardhan put the opposition defence into a lot of trouble with his pace. 

His dangerous forays created some chances, but was wasted by Jogesh Chandra?s strikers. Heramba Chandra custodian Amit Ghosh too saved quite a few. 

In fact, it was Ghosh?s effort in the penalty shootout that paved the way for Heramba?s triumph. 

After the lemon break, Heramba Chandra, under the guidance of Trijit Das (who had turned out for East Bengal and Mohammedan Sporting), essayed a few throughs, but the ground made the strikers? job difficult. 

The match then moved on to penalty shootout where Heramba Chandra prevailed. Samiran Nag of Jogesh Chandra was adjudged best player, while R.G. Kar Medical College bagged the fair play trophy. Sailen Manna handed over the champions? trophy.

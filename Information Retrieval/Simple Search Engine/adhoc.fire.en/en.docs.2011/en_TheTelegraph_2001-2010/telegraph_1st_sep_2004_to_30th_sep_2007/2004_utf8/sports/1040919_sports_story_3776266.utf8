 India coach to continue till Nov. 17

 A CORRESPONDENT 

New Delhi: National coach Stephen Constantine?s tenure could end after India?s last World Cup qualifying match against Oman on November 17 in Muscat. 

This was hinted by AIFF president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi after its executive committee meeting on Saturday. The officials, who had accompanied Constantine on various assignments, expressed unhappiness about the performance of the national team under the Anglo-Cypriot coach. 

India play Singapore on October 13 before meeting Oman. He will also be coach for India?s junior squad in the Asian U-20 championship final round in Malaysia. 

India are clubbed in group C along with Syria, Uzbekistan and Laos. India kick-off against Syria on September 25. A conference on national team policy will be held in the last week of November in the capital. The number of domestic matches for players on the national squad may get restricted. The AIFF is also likely to ban national level players from taking part in state leagues. 

The AIFF president also stated tenders will be floated for telecast rights of India?s international matches in the future. The national team would tour Pakistan in February 2005 to play three matches there. 

It was also decided that the ninth National Football league (NFL) will begin from the second week of December and conclude in April 2005. The recommendation of reducing the number of teams in the first division NFL from 12 to 10 has been accepted. Thus four teams will be demoted at the end of the ninth NFL and just 10 will take part in the 10th NFL next season. 

Ten teams will also participate in the second division NFL this season, including relegated Mohammedan Sporting and Indian Bank. A third division will be introduced for the state league champions, who do not qualify for the second division.

 Bhupathi to face off with Paes

New Delhi: Mahesh Bhupathi and Leander Paes will face off in Madrid this week. The once-world No. 1 pair, who no longer play together on the Tour, will meet each other in the doubles first round of the $2.45-million Masters Series meet. 

Bhupathi and Belarussian Max Mirnyi are seeded No. 5, while Paes and Czech David Rikl are unseeded. 

It?s a pity one of the two Indians will be out of the tournament so early. Both pairs are seeking to qualify for the year-end Masters Cup in Houston and need to desperately accumulate points. Bhupathi and Mirnyi are placed No. 6 in the ATP doubles list while Paes and Rikl are currently in 10th place. The top eight teams qualify for the prestigious event. (Agencies)

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 ?Be positive against Shane Warne?

 - The neutral view - Former Pak captain and world winning coach Intikhab 

speaks to The Telegraph

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI 

 Intikhab Alam 

Calcutta: For much of Sunday, Intikhab Alam shuttled between Chandigarh and Mohali (watching semi-finals of a Punjab Cricket Association-organised tournament). In between, however, he managed to keep track of the throbbing Chennai Test. 

?Frankly, it?s a fifty-fifty game? Having said that, the advantage will be with India if Shane Warne is tackled positively,? Intikhab told The Telegraph when contacted on his cellphone. 

He added: ?Virender Sehwag made a bold statement by smashing Glenn McGrath for a four on the day?s last delivery? The approach has to be the same once Warne is introduced ? early, I reckon ? on the fifth morning. The Indians shouldn?t only wait for the loose ball?? 

The former Pakistan captain and coach (manager and selector too) is in India on a precedent-setting assignment ? coaching Punjab till the end of this 2004-05 season. 

Intikhab continued: ?Of course, many feel India let go a wonderful opportunity to wrap it up quickly but, then, we must not forget Damien Martyn registered one of the greatest innings (104 in 280 minutes) by an overseas player in the sub-continent? 

?Martyn?s determination and the manner he paced such a tremendous effort won?t be forgotten in a hurry. I also liked the way he shielded (nightwatchman) Jason Gillespie? Even if Australia lose, they are going to be indebted to Martyn for a lot of things?? 

According to Intikhab, while Martyn proved dropping anchor was possible, the Indians will have to go for the remaining 210 runs and not graft. 

?I?ve always believed attitude and not ability wins matches? Therefore, the Indians shouldn?t be afraid of playing shots even if that costs them the Test? In any case, defending against Warne in the fourth innings isn?t going to help. So, be positive,? he suggested. 

In Intikhab?s opinion, the Chepauk wicket hasn?t been ideal for a five-day game. 

?The bounce has been variable and, often, the turn unpredictable? It has been very up-and-down for a Test and difficult for batsmen? In fact, it?s because of the variable bounce that I wouldn?t be too harsh on Parthiv Patel,? he pointed out. 

[Parthiv has been an absolute disaster behind the wickets, though he has done well with the bat. The selectors, who now meet on Monday, are set to retain him for the third Test, but another poor show with the big gloves could mean good news for somebody like Mahender Singh Dhoni.] 

Having himself been a top-bracket leg-spinner, Intikhab applauded Anil Kumble for his 13-wicket haul: ?He has never been a great turner, but has relied more on bounce? Indeed, he has been lethal when that has been variable? It?s difficult finding bowlers who are more competitive?? 

Signing off, Intikhab reminded that self-belief will also be a factor in the Indians? chase. ?More the faith, better the chance of reaching 229,? he observed. 

Intikhab knows that better than most. He was, after all, the Pakistan coach when self-belief played a huge role in the 1992 World Cup triumph under Imran Khan. 

Footnote: Incidentally, Intikhab hasn?t made up his mind on where to slot Yuvraj Singh when he?s available for Punjab. ?Essentially, Yuvraj is a middle-order bat? Let?s see?? he remarked. Yuvraj, by the way, is under pressure to keep his Team India berth. A stage has come when Sourav Ganguly?s backing alone may not be enough.

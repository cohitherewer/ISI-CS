 Inzy to stay at helm beyond Aussie tour

Karachi: Inzamam-ul Haq is likely to remain as Pakistan captain beyond their tour of Australia, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Shaharyar Khan said on Wednesday. 

?I don?t see any prospect of Inzamam being changed as captain when we sit down to review his captaincy after the Australian tour,? Khan said. 

The 35-year-old Inzamam was appointed captain in January for a whole year, breaking with the country?s traditional policy of naming skippers on a series by series basis. 

After Pakistan?s Champions Trophy semi-final defeat by West Indies last month, however, his position was under threat, according to media reports. ?I think he has done a fine job and he has shown good judgement as a leader. The other players look up to him, which is very important, and the team is improving,? Khan said. 

Inzamam, currently leading the team in a home one-day tournament also involving Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe, is the 10th different Pakistan captain since 1993. 

?I don?t see him being changed unless something very drastic happens,? he said. 

Inzamam has played 94 Tests and 325 one-day Internationals, becoming last month only the second batsman to score 10,000 runs in ODIs after Sachin Tendulkar. 

?We would like him to continue for a long time as he is our best bet. He is capable of building up a new team in his quiet but authoritative style,? Khan added.

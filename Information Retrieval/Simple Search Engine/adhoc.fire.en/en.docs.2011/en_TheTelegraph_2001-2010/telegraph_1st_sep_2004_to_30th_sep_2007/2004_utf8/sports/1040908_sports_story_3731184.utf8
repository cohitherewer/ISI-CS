New York: Nadia Petrova provided further evidence of the growing Russian strength in womens tennis when she defeated world No. 1 Justine Henin-Hardenne 6-3, 6-2 in the fourth round of the US Open on Monday. 

Lleyton Hewitt sailed into the quarter finals on Tuesday with a 6-4, 6-2, 6-2 victory over unseeded Slovak Karol Beck. 

While Andre Agassi, Tim Henman and Lindsay Davenport made it a good day for the veterans by reaching the quarter finals, the real drama came under the night lights as 14th seed Petrova, yet to win a WTA Tour singles title, knocked out the top seed. 

Of course its my best win, in a Grand Slam, beating the defending champion, Petrova said. 

I was a little bit doubtful that I could still pull this match out because, knowing her experience, I was thinking she would change something in the game and be more consistent, be in charge of the game. But I stayed strong until the end. 

The 22-year-old Petrova now plays fellow countrywoman Svetlana Kuznetsova, the ninth seed. Russia have three players in the last eight, with Elena Dementieva their other quarter-finalist. Anastasia Myskina became the first Russian woman to lift a Grand Slam singles title when she won the French Open in June. Maria Sharapova then made it back-to-back Russian victories when she triumphed at Wimbledon in July. 

Earlier on Monday, 34-year-old Agassi set up a mouthwatering clash with mens world No. 1 Roger Federer by trouncing Armenian Sargis Sargsian 6-3, 6-2, 6-2. Im looking forward to it, Agassi said. Theres nothing more you can ask than to play a big event against the best player. Its time to bring the best tennis. His (Federers) forehand is just a nasty shot. He does a lot of things well and a few things really great, so its going to be a tough match. 

Australian Open and Wimbledon champion Federer, looking to become the first man since Swedens Mats Wilander in 1988 to win three Grand Slams in the same year, received an unexpected day off when 16th seed Andrei Pavel pulled out with a herniated disc in his lower back. 

When fifth seed Tim Henman woke up with a stiff back 10 days ago, the Briton did not think he would be able to play his first-round tie. 

But, after surviving five-set battles against Ivo Karlovic and Michal Tabara, Henman celebrated his 30th birthday with a gutsy victory over Germanys Nicolas Kiefer. The Briton looked in trouble when he trailed by a set and 3-1 but stormed back to win 10 games in succession to lead by two sets to one. 

Kiefer snatched the fourth set but Henman was on top in the decider, leading 6-7, 6-3, 6-1, 6-7, 3-0 when the German retired with a suspected tendon injury to his right wrist. 

I felt that my game plan was pretty much spot on today, said Henman, whose semi-final appearance at the French Open in June was his first time past the last 16 at any Grand Slam outside of Wimbledon, where he has reached the last four on four occasions. Its taken to have a bad back at the beginning of the tournament to sort of say to myself, You know, whatever happens, happens. And if anything good happens, its going to be a big, big bonus. 

Henman will meet 22nd seed Dominik Hrbaty for a place in the semi-finals after the Slovakian came from two sets down to beat Belgian Olivier Rochus 2-6, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4, 6-0. 

Fifth seed Davenport, 28, with four WTA Tour titles under her belt since her semi-final defeat by Sharapova at Wimbledon, edged out Williams 7-5, 6-4 in a repeat of the 2000 US Open final won by Venus. Venus, seeded 11th, made 42 unforced errors before Davenport clinched victory on her fifth match point to reach the quarter finals for the eighth year in succession. 

I definitely have worked harder since last November than I ever have, spending a lot of time in the gym, Davenport said. After that first win in Stanford (California, in July), it just seems like all the confidence came back to me after winning a close title match. Ive just kind of gone with it since then. 

Davenport will now play Japans Shinobu Asagoe, the last unseeded player, who reached her first Grand Slam quarter-final with a 7-6, 4-6, 6-3 win over Greeces Eleni Daniilidou. 

Kuznetsova reached the last eight for the first time when she ended the run of twice former Grand Slam champion Mary Pierce, 7-6, 6-2. 

Paes-Martina in semis 

Leander Paes and Martina Navratilova stayed on course for yet another Grand Slam title as they sailed into the mixed doubles semi-finals. 

They defeated Wimbledon champion Maria Sharapova of Russia and Max Mirnyi of Belarus 6-4, 6-4 last night to set up a clash with Australian duo of Alicia Molik and Todd Woodbrige in the last-four stage. 

In the other semis, top seeds Daniel Nestor of Canada and Rennae Stubbs of Australia will take on fourth seeds Bob Bryan of US and Vera Zvonareva of Russia. Paes, along with David Rikl of Czech Republic, has also reached the mens doubles quarter finals. 

Mahesh Bhupathi, pairing Mirnyi, however, crashed 

out of mens doubles in Round 3. The fourth seeds lost to Spaniards Rafael Nadal 

and Tommy Robredo 4-6, 4-6. Earlier, Bhupathi and Lisa Raymond of USA went out 

of the mixed doubles in the second round. (Agencies)

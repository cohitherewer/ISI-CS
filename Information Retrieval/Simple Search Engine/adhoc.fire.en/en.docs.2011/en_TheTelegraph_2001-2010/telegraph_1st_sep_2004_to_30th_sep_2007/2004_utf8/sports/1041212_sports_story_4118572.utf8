The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Second autopsy order reversed

Panaji: A Goa court Saturday reversed its decision to order a second post-mortem on the body of Dempo Sports Club?s Brazilian footballer Cristiano de lima Junior, who died during the Federation Cup final, saying it did not ?have the jurisdiction? to take such a decision. 

The original directive had come after a plea by the state government to the effect. 

?The sub divisional magistrate (SDM) of north Goa has issued an order this evening rejecting the request by junior?s widow Juliana as the court does not have the required jurisdiction to order a second post-mortem,? official sources said here, adding, with this, any order issued in the past becomes irrelevant.

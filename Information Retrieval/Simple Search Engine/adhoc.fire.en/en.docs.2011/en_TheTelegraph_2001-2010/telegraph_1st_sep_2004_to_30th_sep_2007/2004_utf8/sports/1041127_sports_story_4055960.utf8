 Eriksson backs Beckham

 - England coach remains unconvinced about Real Madrid tactics 

By Henry Winter

 Expectations have weighed down Beckham, feels Eriksson 

Sven-Goran Eriksson, England?s head coach, will travel to Madrid for discussions with David Beckham about the midfielder?s form. Although far from crisis talks, the planned meeting does reflect Eriksson?s desire to see his captain back at the top of his game. 

?I can?t believe David is finished as a football player and he?s not ? I?m quite sure about that,? stressed Eriksson, responding to criticism of Beckham?s displays this year. 

?Playing at Real Madrid when they?re struggling a bit is difficult. The expectation at Real is they should win every game 5-0. When they?re not doing, like now, it?s difficult for all the players there. 

?The whole team played badly against Barcelona last Saturday but against Bayer Leverkusen (on Tuesday). David did well, or so my scout says. I will go out to see him before we play the friendly with Holland in February.? 

Eriksson is too diplomatic to mention it publicly but it is clear that he remains unconvinced about the wisdom of Real playing Beckham inside. ?I don?t want to discuss the tactics of Real Madrid because that?s not my concern but for me David can do better if he plays on the right of the three or the right of the diamond,? Eriksson added. 

The Swede has also been in conversation with Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson about Wayne Rooney, whose appearance for England in the 0-1 defeat in Spain last week was scarred by hot-headedness. ?I talked to Alex about it and there?s no problem,? said Eriksson. ?It?s in the interests of Alex and myself that Wayne goes on growing to be the big, big, big football player he can be. He?s at a good club. I don?t know if Alex is the best manager for him because David Moyes was very good as well. But Ferguson has huge experience of dealing with young players.? 

In Madrid last week, Eriksson?s players were incensed by the racist taunts of the home fans. ?UEFA and Fifa have a golden opportunity to take care of racism now,? Eriksson added. ?They can make strong rules against racism because of what happened in Spain. I never considered taking the players off. But if it?s possible in future I should like that. But there must be clear rules.? 

Eriksson has been watching England candidates. ?I saw Scott Parker at Chelsea and he?s improved a lot. He is better technically. Glen Johnson did okay. Stewart Downing? Let?s see if he goes on. We?ll see in February.? 

Eriksson signalled his confidence in the team?s future when he autographed a huge flag of St George at the Swindon offices of Nationwide Thursday, scribbling ?Here?s to World Cup 2006?. 

England are odds-on to qualify and Eriksson believes the team can win the tournament. ?If there are no injuries and we have an extra week before the tournament to prepare, I think it is possible to win the World Cup.? 

Yet a reminder of England?s tournament troubles under Eriksson came in his list of the best three players of 2004: Ronaldinho, of Brazil, France?s Thierry Henry, and Deco, of Portugal.

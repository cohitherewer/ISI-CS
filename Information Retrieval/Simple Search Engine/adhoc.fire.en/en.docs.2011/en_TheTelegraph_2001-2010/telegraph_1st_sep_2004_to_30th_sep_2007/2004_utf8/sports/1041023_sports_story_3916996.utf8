Madrid: Mahesh Bhupathi and Max Mirnyi bowed out of the $2.45 million Masters Series meet on Friday. The third seeds were beaten 4-6, 6-7 (3-7) by No. 1 seeds and US Open champions Mark Knowles and Daniel Nestor in the semi-finals. 

In the quarter final, Bhupathi and Mirnyi had brushed aside Dominik Hrbaty (Slovakia) and Rainer Schuettler (Germany) 6-4, 6-2. 

In singles, Croatian Ivan Ljubicic edged into the semis with a 7-6, 6-7, 7-6 victory over seventh seed Joachim Johansson of Sweden. 

Both huge servers, neither player was broken during a match lasting nearly three hours, with Ljubicic moving ahead in the deciding tie-breaker before Johansson handed him victory with a double-fault. Ljubicic, who earlier knocked out top seed Tim Henman, will meet Argentine David Nalbandian or American Taylor Dent. 

 On Thursday, Andre Agassi powered through to the quarter finals with a 6-1, 6-3 victory over Vincent Spadea. Third seed Marat Safin also reached the quarter-final with a relaxed 6-3, 6-3 victory over tenacious Austrian Stefan Koubek. 

An inspired Agassi dominated from the start against his fellow-American, the second seed wrapping up victory with an ace in less than an hour. 

Spadea, who came through a gruelling three-setter against local favourite Rafael Nadal on Wednesday, was given few chances against the 34-year-old Agassi who is still hoping to qualify for the Masters Cup in Houston. 

?I think Vincent was a little flat. He was missing more than he normally does, which always helps,? said Agassi, who will play Tommy Robredo after the Spaniard beat countryman Fernando Verdasco 2-6, 6-4, 6-3. 

On a question relating to retirement, Agassi said he will play at least another full year of professional tennis, as long as he stays healthy. 

The 34-year-old eight-time Grand Slam champion said he was committed to competing next year. 

?I?m going to play a full schedule next year and then we?ll see. You hope you stay healthy and you hope this is possible,? said Agassi, who recovered from a mid-season slump to win the Cincinnati Masters and reach the US Open quarter finals. 

?The difficulty if you always assess every month or every week is that you don?t concentrate on what you have to do. If I allowed myself the luxury of assessing in the middle of this year, I would never have won Cincinnati or had a chance at the US Open because things were very down for me then.? 

Agassi began the year by reaching the semi-finals of the Australian Open, San Jose and Indian Wells but lost in the first round at Roland Garros and missed Wimbledon. The former world No. 1 has spent nearly two decades on the professional circuit, amassing nearly $30 million in prize-money. (Agencies)

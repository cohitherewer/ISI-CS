The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Ashraful?s record unbeaten 158 comes to nought

 - Bangla on verge of defeat after blowing hot and cold 

 - Pathan wrecks hosts? second innings 

 Zaheer Khan, who touched the 100-wicket mark in Tests on Sunday, celebrates the dismissal of Javed Omar in Chittagong 

Chittagong: Bangladesh blew hot and cold, and despite a record unbeaten century by Mohammed Ashraful, were staring at defeat on the third day of the second Test against India on Sunday. 

An extraordinary batting performance was followed by inexplicable collapse as Bangladesh, having waged a spirited battle to post 333 in the first innings, crashed to 118 for nine in the second. 

With just one wicket in hand, the hosts face a huge task of scoring 89 runs more to make India bat again. The visitors scored 540 in their first essay. 

The 20-year-old Ashraful cracked the highest individual score by a Bangladeshi batsman with an unbeaten 158 in their first innings and then watched his team crumble like a pack of cards. 

For the first time in the series, the hosts showed some enterprise in their batting in the first innings. However, captain Sourav Ganguly?s decision to enforce the follow on was vindicated as Irfan Pathan, who had gone wicketless till the tea break, ripped through the Bangladesh top order with his third five-wicket haul of the series. 

Ashraful, who surpassed Bangladesh?s previous individual best of 145 by Aminul Islam in the inaugural Test of 2000 against India, was back at the crease after an hour and 16 minutes. But he could not repeat his exploits again as he fell leg before to Anil Kumble for three. 

Pathan (five for 32), who had struggled throughout the day, found his inswingers in the evening to trigger the collapse. 

Ashraful was 62 at lunch, but his next 38 runs came from only 25 balls, and he moved from 76 to 100 in just seven deliveries. In all, he scored 21 fours and two sixes. 

The middleorder batsman?s knock even forced Harbhajan (two wickets away from equalling Erapalli Prasanna?s tally of 189) to applaud him. 

Zaheer Khan, who picked up his 100th scalp, went for 53 runs from 11 overs in two spells. Pathan was equally ineffective, and although his first spell was relatively economical, the left-arm pacer was torn apart when he returned for the second time after lunch. 

Kumble broke the partnership with a quicker one to trap Ahmed leg before for 43 (72 balls), that included five fours and a six off Harbhajan. Zaheer then rapped Manjural Islam Rana on the pads and seemed to find the right length to tie down the free flowing Ashraful. The batsman got a life when V.V.S. Laxman grassed his flick at square leg. 

But he was soon back to his attacking mode, sweeping Kumble from outside the off stump. For the first time in the series Ganguly had to turn to Sachin Tendulkar, but his two overs on either side of lunch cost 12 runs. The new ball was promptly taken after the 81st over, but that produced more runs from the blade. 

The 300 came in the 85th over, at a healthy run rate of 3.5, which actually hovered around seven when Ashraful and Ahmed were on a blaze. 

Both Pathan and Zaheer were guilty of digging in short on a flat track and Ashraful was quick to rock on his backfoot and pull them to the side fence. Zaheer?s fourth over of the morning cost him 12 runs. And when the left arm speedster came around the wicket, Ashraful hooked him to fine leg for a six. 

The batsman, who crossed 1000-run mark when on 49, also added 70 runs for the fourth wicket with skipper Habibul Bashar (22) and 60 for seventh with Khaled Mashud (22). 

Mashud also collected 1000 runs in Tests but was unlucky to be adjudged caught behind. 

Kumble gave the breakthrough, but it needed a reckless shot from Bashar to break the fourth wicket, which was worth 70 runs from 92 balls.

 ?Smart? may win in Mysore 

 WILLIAM TELL

 Mysore: Street Smart, from trainer S. Komandur?s yard, with apprentice Ranjeet Singh in the saddle, looks good on his summer and current form to lift the upper division of the 1,400m Thungabhadra Cup here on Wednesday.

 Street Smart?s main rival looks to be Anchor, who ran close to him when they met last during the summer. However, at weights, the Smart looks better and may ward off his challenge. 

 Trainer S. Rakesh?s Pretty Move is working well and may lift the lower division of the trophy in the hands of Warren Singh.

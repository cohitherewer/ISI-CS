The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Douglas participation thrown into doubt 

 - We are here to win and everything else is secondary: Shaabou 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Coach Subhas Bhowmick says if required, Douglas will play on Wednesday 

Calcutta: East Bengal suffered a blow on Monday, ahead of their AFC Cup quarter final match against Syria?s Al Jaish, when Douglas de Silva?s participation was thrown into doubt. Debjit Ghosh also has a breathing problem. 

An MRI scan on the left ankle of the Brazilian midfielder on Monday revealed a muscle tear. He had contracted the injury during the derby match against Mohun Bagan on Saturday. Douglas did not join in practice this morning. 

According to team doctor Shanti Ranjan Dasgupta, he just did some cycling at the gym. ?After the match on Saturday, he couldn?t even walk. He is much better now. But I have advised him not to play,? he said. ?Now it?s up to the coach and Douglas. They will take the decision,? he revealed. 

Douglas may be out of action for at least a month. 

East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick said, ?I have not taken any decision as yet.? He, however, made it clear that ?if required, Douglas will play on Wednesday.? 

Meanwhile, in another development, East Bengal have yet to sign Brazilian striker Roberto Paolo as the necessary clearance from the AFC as to his availability for Wednesday?s match didn?t reach the club. 

The news of Douglas? injury will give an added impetus to the Syrian team. As Zyad Shaabou, their most prolific striker, pointed out after a two-hour practice, ?We know nothing about East Bengal. Only that eight players play for the national team and there is one Brazilian. We hear the Brazilian is very good and we are going to give him the most importance.? However, Shaabou?s fears may turn out to be in vain after all. 

Al Jaish went through a gruelling workout at the SAI on Monday. Despite all speculations, the Syrian team looked adequately comfortable with the wet ground and steady drizzle. ?We are here to win and everything else is secondary. We are not used to this weather, it is almost always sunny in our country. But we will adapt and hopefully get our result on the day,? the 25-year-old Shaabou said. 

A sports teacher at a Damascus school, Shaabou will carry his team?s hopes. He is their leading goalscorer with 14 goals in the Syrian league and eight in the Cup. ?I hope to score more here,? he quipped. 

Not many current Syrian players have had an opportunity to play abroad. Shaabou got his chance when he got a contract with Hansa Rostock in Germany. ?I went to Hansa Rostock but didn?t join them. I was studying at the university then and my father wouldn?t let me leave. It was a little upsetting,? he said. But now the striker has graduated and with the earliest opportunity, Shaabou will leave Syria for a stint abroad. 

Bhowmick was also at the Al Jaish practice on Monday.

 ACSU team to probe 1999 Kenya meet

Nairobi: International Cricket Council?s (ICC) Anti-Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU) officials planning to interview senior Kenyan players over match-fixing allegations will base their investigations on a four-nation LG Cup held in Kenya in October 1999. 

Kenya Cricket Association (KCA) general manager Sammy Obingo said Martin Hawkins and Alan Peacock, who were involved in investigations that led to an inquiry into former captain Maurice Odumbe?s dealings earlier this year, will address the players activities during the 1999 tournament also contested by India, South Africa and Zimbabwe. 

South Africa, led by the late Hansie Cronje, beat India in the final. 

Most of the players summoned have threatened not to appear before the investigators claiming they had been given short notice and are apprehensive of being implicated in wrongdoing arising from the interviews. 

But Obingo said the players have been assured that no action will be taken against them. 

The investigators are expected to reach the country on Tuesday.

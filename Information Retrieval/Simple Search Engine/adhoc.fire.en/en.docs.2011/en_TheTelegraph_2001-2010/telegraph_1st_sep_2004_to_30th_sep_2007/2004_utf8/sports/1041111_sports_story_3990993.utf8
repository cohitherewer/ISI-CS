 ?Fit? Sourav ready for Eden ODI

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Team India captain Sourav Ganguly has used the Ranji Trophy tie against Karnataka as a build-up ahead of the India-Pakistan ODI at the Eden Gardens on Saturday. ?I wasn?t sure whether I would be able to go into a high-pressure game after having been out of action for two weeks, so I decided to play the Ranji Trophy,? said Sourav. 

Sourav declared that he was now fit to play the Platinum Jubilee match, but said a final decision would have to be taken by team physio Andrew Leipus. ?I am feeling fine but Andrew will have to judge,? Sourav said. 

He indicated that his fitness test may take place on Thursday. Although Sourav failed with the bat in both the innings against Karnataka, he expressed satisfaction with the match practice. 

?It is good that I played this match ahead of the Pakistan match and the important series against South Africa,? he said. About his batting form, Sourav said: ?I scored the most runs in the last two one-day series.? 

Asked about the chances against Pakistan, he said, ?in one-dayers, it depends on how you play on a given day. I hope we play well at the Eden Gardens.? He added, ?it is just like that we won against Pakistan on their soil, they have now won three back-to-back matches against us.? 

To a query whether he would prefer opening against Pakistan, Sourav said, ?I have not decided yet, I have to speak to John Wright in this regard. But I have mostly opened batting in the one-dayers. It is only after Sehwag came and the way he played that I went down to No. 3 spot.?

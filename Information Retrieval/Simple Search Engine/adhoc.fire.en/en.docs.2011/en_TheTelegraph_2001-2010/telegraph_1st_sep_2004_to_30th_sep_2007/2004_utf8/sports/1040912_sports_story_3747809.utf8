 Russians flush US out

 - Semi-Finals - Dementieva conquers Capriati; Davenport falls to Kuznetsova

 Jennifer Capriati of the US after missing a point against Elena Dementieva of Russia during their semi-final match at Flushing Meadow on Friday 

New York: Lindsay Davenport had frolicked all summer on the tennis court without the pain in her knee or foot that had troubled her for nearly two years. Since Wimbledon, Davenport had been sound. Her strokes, hit so hard and clean, were flawless. Her serve had become a consistent companion, winning her easy points and making the game beautiful and fun. Until Friday. That was the day when two of the Russian women advanced to the US Open final for the first time, each defeating an American. 

For Davenport, a groin muscle that was stiff after practice Thursday was achy after warmups Friday and became punishingly painful by the middle of her semi-final match against 19-year-old Svetlana Kuznetsova, a strong, athletic opponent (as reported in Saturday?s Late City edition). By the middle of the third set, Davenport, seeded fifth, could barely run. 

By the end of the match, a teary Davenport limped off Arthur Ashe Stadium saddened by her 6-1, 2-6, 4-6 loss ? not because her chances of winning a second Open were gone or because her 22-match win streak had ended, but because her body didn?t allow her the chance to play her best. 

In the other semi-final, Jennifer Capriati had the greatest moment of her life waiting. All she needed to do was buckle down, settle down, hold serve. Or gather her courage and go for a winner here and there, or attack Elena Dementieva?s second serve, that cockeyed, wildly spinning softball offering, instead of steering it safely up the middle of the court. But she didn?t. 

Capriati, seeded eighth and embraced loudly from start to finish by the crowd, once again fell short of a US Open final. She lost, 0-6, 6-2, 6-7 (5-7), to sixth-seeded Dementieva, whose thigh was heavily taped and whose serve seemed held together by string. So, for the first time since 1988, there will be no Americans playing in the singles finals of the US Open. And, for the second time this year, a Grand Slam women?s final will be between two Russian women ? and for the third time won by a Russian. 

The men?s semi-finalists are Roger Federer of Switzerland, Tim Henman from England, Joachim Johansson from Sweden and Lleyton Hewitt of Australia. Dementieva, 22, played Anastasia Myskina in the French Open championship and fared badly. She took less than an hour to lose in straight sets because she could hardly place a first serve in the box. 

Siberian-born Maria Sharapova won Wimbledon and now the US Open will feature yet another Russian champion. Capriati is now 0-4 in Open semi-finals and for the third time she lost in a third-set tiebreaker. Last year, it was to a cramping Justine Henin-Hardenne; in 1991 it was after a power-hitting classic against Monica Seles that Capriati left the court in tears. She cried again Friday, sobbing into the shoulder of her mother, Denise, in the locker room after the two-hour 15-minute match. 

?It?s kind of hard to really grasp kind of what happened out there,? Capriati said. She is 28 and without a US Open title, the one she has always coveted most. ?It?s disappointing,? Capriati said. ?But, you know, life goes on. What can you do?? 

Capriati only won five points, hit no winners and was blanked in 17 minutes. But in the second set Capriati harnessed her shots better and if the match wasn?t filled with great shot-making or strategy, it did become a fascinating battle of fighting spirit and grim determination. 

?At the end of the game I was so tired there was no place for nerves,? Dementieva said. And it was Dementieva who usually tried to make something happen, good or bad, either by coming to the net or aiming for a corner with her hard, flat forehand. That aggressiveness led to Dementieva hitting a lot more winners than Capriati ? 44 to 15 ? and also making considerably more unforced errors ? 53 to 33. 

Davenport?s voice was still quivering an hour after her loss. ?I?m fine to lose,? she said. ?I?m just disappointed that I didn?t get the opportunity to either win or lose at 100 percent. I?ve been, for me, very lucky that the last three months I haven?t really had to worry about this kind of stuff.? 

After racing through a 21-minute first set by controlling points with her well-placed serve, Davenport began pulling up, grimacing and tugging at her thigh. Davenport called for the trainer after the second set and left the court to have her left thigh more heavily taped. 

?I was pretty bummed between sets,? she said. ?It was a little bit strained in warm-ups and made worse by the match.? Davenport grabbed a 3-0 lead to start the third set, but her hobbling only increased. Because of her fantastic summer, when she dominated the tour, Davenport seems less certain now about retiring after this year.

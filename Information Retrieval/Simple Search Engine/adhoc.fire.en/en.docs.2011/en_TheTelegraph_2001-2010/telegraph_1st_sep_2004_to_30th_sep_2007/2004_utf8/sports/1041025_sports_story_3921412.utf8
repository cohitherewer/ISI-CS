Faisalabad: Left-arm spinner Rangana Herath claimed four wickets on Sunday as Sri Lanka completed an emphatic 201-run first Test win over Pakistan, midway into the afternoon session on the final day. 

Herath perfectly filled the place of Sri Lanka?s injured star spinner Muttiah Muralidharan as Pakistan were dismissed for 216 when last man Shoaib Akhtar was stumped by Kaluwitharana. 

Herath finished with a match-haul of seven for 145 runs. 

Sri Lanka set Pakistan a 418-run target after amassing 438 in their second innings, highlighted by Man-of-the-Match Sanath Jayasuriya?s magnificent 253 on Saturday. 

Shoaib Malik made a career-best 59 but got little support from the other end as Herath bowled consistently with a field of four close in fielders around the Pakistan batsmen. Malik brought up his half century with three successive boundaries off Dilhara Fernando who broke the Pakistan top order with four wickets on Saturday evening. 

Mohammad Sami, nursing a groin muscle injury, was run out for five before Shoaib Akhtar delayed the inevitable with 12, which included a six off Herath. The victory was Sri Lanka?s sixth in nine Tests in Pakistan and their seventh overall. 

Herath claimed two wickets in as many balls in the first session and removed Yousuf Youhana (44) and Abdul Razzaq as Pakistan went for lunch at a 170 for seven ? trailing by a massive 247 runs. 

Herath bowled a marathon spell of 13 overs in two hours from the pavillion end and constricted the Pakistan batsmen with a consistent line and length.

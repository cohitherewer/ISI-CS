Harare: England coach Duncan Fletcher believes his players have been adversely affected by the controversy that has dogged their tour of Zimbabwe. 

England beat Zimbabwe by five wickets in the first of four one-day Internationals in Harare Sunday, but they lost four wickets for 43 runs in 12 overs chasing a modest target of 196. 

?The guys were nervous (on Sunday), there?s been a lot written about this tour,? Fletcher said. ?There was a strange feeling in the camp because of the build-up to this tour.? 

Some of the players played golf Monday while others visited local markets in an attempt to release the tension. ?Getting the guys to relax was crucial, and today there was good energy when we trained,? Fletcher said. 

England will take on Zimbabwe in the second ODI on Wednesday. (Reuters)

Lahore: Inzamam-ul Haq played a captain?s knock of 76 to lead Pakistan to a six-wicket win over Sri Lanka on Thursday. The match was a dress rehearsal for Saturday?s tri-series final. 

Inzamam, only the second batsman in world cricket to score over 10,000 one-day runs (after Sachin Tendulkar), produced his 72nd half century as Pakistan overhauled a Sri Lankan total of 293 with relative ease to reach 297 for four with seven balls to spare under lights. 

Pakistan ended with 21 points in the league stage with four straight victories, followed by Sri Lanka (11) and Zimbabwe (4). 

It was Pakistan?s highest successful chase since Bob Woolmer joined them. 

Inzamam came into bat when the second wicket fell for 139 in the 30th over and proceeded to push the pace with some brilliant strokes, reaching his half century from 42 balls with six fours. 

With 80 required in the last 10 overs, he and Yousuf Youhana (30) played some magnificent shots to put on a brisk 74. 

The successful chase in heavy dew conditions was built on an opening stand of 99 between Salman Butt (57 from 73 balls) and Yasir Hameed (48), who came into form with after scores of 0, 0 and 13 in the tri-series. 

Earlier, Sri Lanka captain Maravan Atapattu stroked a fluent 111 to guide his team to 293 for six. Atapattu, who was dropped on 31, put on 146 runs from 159 balls with Kumar Sangakkara (69). Sri Lanka added 49 in the last five overs in which d from bowling by umpire Simon Taufel for intimidatory bowling.

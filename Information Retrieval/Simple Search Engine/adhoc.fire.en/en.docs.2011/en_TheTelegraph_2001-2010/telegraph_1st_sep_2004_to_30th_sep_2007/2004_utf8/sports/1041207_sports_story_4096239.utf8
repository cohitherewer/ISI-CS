 CA moves ICC

Sydney: Cricket Australia (CA) has lodged an official complaint with the International Cricket Council (ICC) over the pitch prepared for the fourth Test against India in Mumbai last month. 

CA has written to the ICC to state its concerns over the track on which 40 wickets fell in less than three days and India registered a 13-run victory. 

CA chief executive James Sutherland said on Sunday that while nothing could be done about the wicket prepared in Mumbai last month, steps could be taken to address the issue of substandard pitches in future. 

?It?s not all about Mumbai ? that?s gone,? Sutherland was quoted as saying in Sydney Morning Herald Monday. 

He said CA had no problem with pitches reflecting local conditions ? hard and bouncy in Australia, dry and dusty in India ? but it felt Mumbai?s wicket was a step too far. 

CA would also consider raising the matter at the ICC?s next international chief executive?s meeting, in Melbourne in February, he said.

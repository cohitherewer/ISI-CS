 Indian women topple Russians

 Humpy notched up an impressive win 

Mallorca: Grandmaster Koneru Humpy guided Indian eves to a fine 2-1 victory over fifth seed Ukraine in a dramatic ninth-round clash and elevated the team to joint second spot in the women?s section of 36th Chess Olympiad. 

Viswanathan Anand gave an early lead but his effort went in vain as India suffered a 1.5-2.5 defeat against top seeds and defending champions Russia in the ninth round. 

Playing on the top board, Humpy was undeterred by some near ominous defence by Natalia Zhukova and recorded an impressive victory for India. S. Vijayalakshmi stood worse but her fighting qualities helped her attain a draw with Inna Gaponenko, while Dronavalli Harika did well to hold Kateryna Lahno on the third board to complete the victory. 

The battle for gold appears over for the other teams as Chinese women again scored a comprehensive 3-0 victory, this time over Lithuania. Their fourth 3-0 whitewash took China?s tally to 23.5 points and stretched the lead to a whopping six points over nearest rivals Russia, US, Hungary and India (all on 17.5). 

Humpy struggled for sometime before tightening the noose on Zhukova. It was a Semi Slav game wherein Humpy went for the main variation and was surprised by Zhukova?s accurate play till the late middle game. 

The end to this well-fought game came quite abruptly as the Ukrainian missed a simple manoeuvre by the Indian. 

Vijayalakshmi too survived more than a few anxious moments against Gaponenko. Earlier in the day, Harika got an easy draw against Lahno. Playing against the Nimzo Indian, Harika got a slight initiative in the middle game but Lahno was quite up to the task in maintaining the balance. The peace was signed through repetition of moves after black?s 27th turn. 

Leading from the front, Anand crashed through the defences of Alexander Morozevich while Krishnan Sasikiran also did well on the second board in getting an easy draw as black against Russian champion Peter Svidler. 

But the remaining two boards saw the Indian downfall as Surya Sekhar Ganguly was outdone by Vadim Zvjaginsev while P. Harikrishna missed out. 

Anand was brilliance personified as he outplayed Morozevich in an extremely complicated game arising out of a Sicilian defence and leading to a hedgehog setup. 

Sasikiran employed the Tchigorin variation in the Ruy Lopez. Svidler could not do much as he was forced to participate in mutual exchange of pawns leading to an absolutely level position. Harikrishna failed to spot a tactical sequence of move, leading to a quick victory for Alexei Dreev. 

Ganguly was in line for a draw after Zvjaginsev blundered in a winning position arising out of a Ruy Lopez opening. Playing black, the Indian fought till the very end against white?s troubling passed pawn on the king side in the queen and pawn endgame that could have been drawn with precise technique. The last one to end in the day, this game lasted 114 moves. (PTI)

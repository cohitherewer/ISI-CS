 Fleming hails Aussie planning for India

Brisbane: New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming said on Monday he was alarmed at the scale of planning Australia had put in to conquer India. 

The Australians broke through for their first series win in India in 35 years in winning the recent series 2-1. 

Fleming, widely regarded as the most tactically astute captain in the world, rates this Australian outfit tougher opponents than the world-record breaking outfit he last met under Steve Waugh three years ago. 

Fleming said the world champions were set to reach a new level of dominance because they now prepare ?much smarter? than when Waugh led them to a nil-all Trans-Tasman series draw. (AFP)

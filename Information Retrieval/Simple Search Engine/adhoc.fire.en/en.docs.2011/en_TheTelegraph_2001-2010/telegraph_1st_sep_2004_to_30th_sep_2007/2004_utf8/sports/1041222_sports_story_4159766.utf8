The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Victory must for Karnataka 

Mumbai: Former champions Karnataka take on holders Mumbai in their penultimate Elite Group A Ranji Trophy league clash from Wednesday knowing fully well that only an outright win will keep them in the hunt for a semi-final berth. 

Karnataka, who have only six points from five matches going into the clash with high-flying Mumbai, would have to pull out all stops in order to manage full points from the tie. 

Mumbai, led ably by Sairaj Bahutule, have little to worry going into the match even in the absence of pace spearhead Ajit Agarkar, now in Bangladesh for the ensuing tri-series.

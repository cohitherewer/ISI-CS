 Pankaj Advani maintains winning streak

New Delhi: Defending champion Pankaj Advani kept his clean slate on the third consecutive day as he defeated Thomas Fischer of Switzerland in the men?s group F league event in the world IBSF snooker championship in Veldhoven, the Netherlands. 

Advani beat Fischer 4-2 in the first session of the day. 

Asian Games gold medallist Rafath Habib played a very easy opponent in Egypt?s Ahmed El Fokiry in group E and won 4-0. Rafath scored 74-10, 68-24, 71-43 and 71-8, according to information received here on Tuesday. 

However, it was not a very exciting day for Indian women as Meenal Thakur miserably lost to Australia?s Kathy Parasis 1-3. The Aussie won 58-14, 49-60, 70-5, 53-27. (PTI)

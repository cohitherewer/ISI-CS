The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Indo-Pak series a big boost for Indian 

 hockey

Guest Column 

Pargat Singh

 The India-Pakistan series was 

 a resounding success. It demolished the myth that people 

 no longer watch hockey. We may have lost the series, but 

 the eight matches ? four in each country ? proved beyond 

 doubt that hockey still touches a chord in every Indian 

 heart.

 Just as the series ended, news 

 came in that India would get a Champions Trophy call-up. 

 That is great news. This is a godsend opportunity for the 

 players and for coach Gerhard Rach. To be able to play with 

 the best teams in the world in a premier event is indeed 

 a big honour.

 Matches in the Pakistan leg brought 

 in huge crowds. When the series came to India, there were 

 some negative words after the opening match in Delhi failed 

 to fill up the National Stadium. But, believe me, 8,000-10,000 

 people on a working day at 1.30 pm means hockey is still 

 the national sport of this country.

 Sandeep Singh needs to be more consistent 

 with penalty corners.

 The smaller stadiums in Punjab 

 proved that the game is alive and kicking, and there are 

 enough backers. When the last match was played in Hyderabad, 

 the atmosphere was terrific ? under lights and in the presence 

 of a decent crowd. To add to that, India won. That is what 

 can happen to hockey, if everything around it is right.

 With only the graded tournaments 

 taking place, there was no platform for the players to show 

 their mettle. In this series, the players ? many of whom 

 were not known to the public ? got a good opportunity to 

 showcase their talent in front of packed grounds.

 So much was said and written about 

 Adrian D?Souza, on the strength of his performance in Athens 

 , Indians were curious. This series gave home fans that 

 chance and they must have taken heart from the classy goalkeeper?s 

 performance.

 Dilip Tirkey has emerged as the 

 pillar of the team. Ignace Tirkey, Vikram Pillay, Sandeep 

 Michael and Viren Rasquinha also put up good performances, 

 but I will be happy to see more goals. Conversion of penalty 

 corners is the big hole in our plans. Sandeep Singh is inconsistent. 

 Also, ball-stopping during set pieces need to be worked 

 on. We need variations to catch the opposition off guard. 

 And, to supplement that, our players have to be alert to 

 avoid conceding goals off counter-attacks.

 Above all, taking time to settle 

 down and not going all out till the last second is going 

 to be another area of concern for Rach. 

 This will be the third successive 

 year we will be going to the Champions Trophy. Next year, 

 we will be hosting this event. These two chances should 

 be used to ensure that the Indian team gets into perfect 

 shape for the 2006 Asian Games .

Karachi: Shoaib Malik and Abdul Razzaq put on a stand of 82 runs to guide Pakistan to a six-wicket victory over Sri Lanka on the final day of the second Test on Monday. 

The win levelled the two-match series 1-1 and prevented Sri Lanka from completing a hattrick of victories in Pakistan after their successes in 1995-96 and 1999-2000. 

Chasing 137 for victory after Sri Lanka had made 406 in their second innings, Pakistan were struggling on 57 for four until Malik, with an unbeaten 53, and Razzaq, not out on 35, steadied things. 

Yasir failed to keep a drive off Herath down and skipper Maravan Atapattu took a magnificent low catch in the covers. 

Herath then trapped Youhana leg before and Vaas had Younis caught by a diving Atapattu at wide mid-off. 

But Malik, whose 60-ball knock included six fours and a six, hit 22 runs in the final over off Herath to bring up victory in 37 overs. 

The match was dominated by Pakistan leg spinner Danish Kaneria with match figures of 10 for 190. 

The 23-year took seven for 118 in the Sri Lankan second innings, which ended in the second over after lunch with Vaas unbeaten on 32. 

Resuming on 361 for seven, Sri Lanka lost Farveez Mahroof (three) in the second over, bowled by Kaneria with a brute of a leg spinner. 

But Vaas, who hit five fours, got good support from tailenders Herath (six) and Dilhara Fernando (four) and added 42 runs to the total. 

Sri Lanka were bowled out for 208 in their first innings and conceded a lead of 270 to Pakistan who made 478 thanks to centuries from Younis Khan (124) and Inzamam-ul Haq (117). 

Sanath Jayasuriya (107) and Kumar Sangakkara (138) hit hundreds in Sri Lanka?s second innings. 

Sangakkara fined 

Sangakkara has been fined 30 percent of his match fee for showing dissent on the fourth day. 

Sangakkara hurled his bat high in the air, apparently in frustration, after being caught behind for 138. 

Match Referee Jeff Crowe imposed the fine and reprimanded Sangakkara after a 20-minute hearing at the end of the match.

 Klinsmann keeps options open

 Kahn?s recent form has been erratic for Bayern Munich 

Frankfurt: Germany coach Juergen Klinsmann is in no hurry to choose between goalkeepers Oliver Kahn and Jens Lehmann despite the destabilising effect the row is having on the country?s World Cup preparations. 

?The competition goes on, and both goalkeepers accept that,? Klinsmann said after naming both men in the squad to face Cameroon in a friendly in Leipzig on Wednesday. 

?There?s no other way. Both will have a fair chance and then we?ll see who is in goal in 2006. This is a luxury problem.? 

The question as to who should take the gloves when Germany host the World Cup in a little over 18 months? time has become the major sporting debate in the country, with the two men?s performances subjected to intense scrutiny every time they play. 

Kahn, now 35 and with 74 caps, was a commanding presence in Germany?s run to the 2002 World Cup final, but his mistake handed Ronaldo the opening goal as Brazil went on to take the trophy. 

His recent form has been erratic for Bayern Munich and Klinsmann decided to strip him of the captaincy and the regular number one?s position shortly after taking over as coach in July. 

Lehmann, the 34-year-old Arsenal goalkeeper, won his 20th cap in a friendly against Iran last month and will again start against Cameroon. 

The coach?s rotation policy has drawn criticism from Bayern, who say the situation has put Kahn under pressure and led to his last-minute blunder in a recent 1-0 defeat against Juventus in the Champions League. 

Klinsmann rejected Bayern?s request for an end to the debate on Friday. Instead, he plans to hold ?round table? discussions with new goalkeeping coach Andreas Koepke and his three top ?keepers ? Timo Hildebrand is the third choice ? before the game against Cameroon.

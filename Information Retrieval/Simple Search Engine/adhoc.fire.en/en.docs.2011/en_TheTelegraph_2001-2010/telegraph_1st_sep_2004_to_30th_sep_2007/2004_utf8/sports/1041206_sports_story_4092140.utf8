 Melbourne: Peter Lonard hit a closing seven-under-par 65 to win the Australian PGA Championship by two strokes on Sunday, one week after claiming the Australian Open title for a second successive year.

 Australian Lonard carded a total of 18-under 270 at the Coolum golf course on Queensland?s Sunshine Coast. Overnight leader and rookie professional James Nitties (70) finished second on 272.

 American Bob Estes (70) was third, one stroke behind Nitties. Estes had a bogey-five on the last hole.

 The 37-year-old Lonard was a joint winner of the Australian PGA Championship two years ago, with Jarrod Moseley. 

 Nick O?Hern (67) and American Corey Pavin (70) were equal fourth on 14-under 274. 

 Hong Kong: Spain?s Miguel Angel Jimenez won his fifth tournament of the year with a one-shot victory at the Hong Kong Open on Sunday.

 Jimenez, who carded a final round 66 for a 14-under-par total of 266, held off a spirited challenge from Irish ace Padraig Harrington and James Kingston of South Africa who finished joint second on 267.

 The 40-year-old has enjoyed a memorable year, finishing fourth on the Volvo Order of Merit with wins at the Johnnie Walker Classic, Algarve Open, Asian Open and BMW Open and being part of the triumphant European Ryder Cup team.

 London: The new chief executive of the English FA believes video replays should be used to determine whether the ball has crossed the goal line. Brian Barwick takes up the post in January after leaving his job as controller of sport at the ITV television network.

 ?It will be sheer folly not to use TV action replays in cases where there are doubts over whether the ball crossed the goal line,? Barwick was quoted as saying in the Sunday Express. ?It would be more difficult to use TV evidence on other decisions because the pace of the game is a crucial element.?

 Attempts have been made to introduce technology into the game including the development of a ball containing an electronic chip that would set off sensors beyond the goal line.

 London: Argentina, deprived of most of their best European-based professionals, were beaten 7-39 by South Africa in Buenos Aires on Saturday.

 The Pumas, fresh from upsetting France 24-14 and narrowly losing 19-21 to Ireland in Dublin, might have secured a first home victory over the Springboks with a full side.

 But a club-versus-country clash on a European Cup day in Europe meant the South Americans could call on only six of the team that started their two internationals in Europe.

 Two tries by Gaffie du Toit who also added 4 points with his boot settled the match for South Africa who led 36-7 at halftime. 

 London: Britain?s David Coulthard says he will be back in Formula One next year and hinted on Saturday that a move to the Red Bull Racing Formula One team was imminent.

 ?I?m going to be on the grid in Formula One and we just need to put everything in order before making the announcement,? the 33-year-old Scot told Eurosport TV when asked where he would be next year. Coulthard has been replaced at McLaren by Colombian Juan Pablo Montoya and has yet to find a new employer.

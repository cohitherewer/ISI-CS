 Diego stranded, frustrated

Buenos Aires: Diego Maradona was still stuck in Argentina on Friday, frustrated by his family?s refusal to allow him to continue his drug rehabilitation in Cuba. 

A judge ruled this week that the 43-year-old former Argentina captain could leave a psychiatric clinic outside Buenos Aires where his family has confined him since heart problems landed him in intensive care in April. 

But Maradona?s family has until next Tuesday to appeal against the court decision, and some relatives have declined to sign forms allowing him to leave the country before then. 

?It?s very frustrating for him. I think it could even make him have a breakdown,? Nestor Marchant, one of Maradona?s psychiatrists, said. ?So much sacrifice to get his spirits up for him to travel, for him to recover. And now these problems just fell out of the sky. This man should have been in Cuba by now,? Marchant said. 

Cameras were stationed outside the clinic even as television stations regularly broke into live programming with latest speculation on when Maradona might depart. 

Maradona has made Cuba his second home in recent years, saying the island offers a respite from the media and fan frenzy elsewhere. (Reuters)

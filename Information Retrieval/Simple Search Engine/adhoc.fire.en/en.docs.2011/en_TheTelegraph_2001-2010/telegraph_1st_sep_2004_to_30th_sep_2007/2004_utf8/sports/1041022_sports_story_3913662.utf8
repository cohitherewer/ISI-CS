 Singh seeks 9th title of year

 Always thought I was going to be No. 1, says Vijai 

Lake Buena Vista: World No. 1 Vijai Singh, who is seeking his ninth win on the PGA Tour this year, will play the final three events this season, starting with this week?s Funai Classic. 

Only five players have won eight or more times in one season ? Byron Nelson (18 wins in 1945), Ben Hogan (13 in 1946 and 10 in 1948), Sam Snead (11 in 1950), Paul Runyan (nine in 1933) and Tiger Woods (eight in 2000). 

?This so-called 10 (victory) mark they all talk about, I?d like to achieve that,? the defending champion said on Wednesday. 

?I just don?t want the season to end, the way I?ve been playing. I never thought I was going to win this many events, and I?m enjoying it. 

?Last year I had a great season (four victories), then I had an incredible season this year. How am I going to approach next year? It?s going to be a big disappointment if I don?t win a tournament.? 

Arnold Palmer and Johnny Miller never won more than eight times in a year and Jack Nicklaus and Tom Watson no more than seven, so Singh?s record compares favourably with some of the all-time greats. 

?Just to be even mentioned near those guys, it?s really unbelievable,? said Singh. 

?I always thought I was going to be No. 1, but when I actually achieved it, I got a lot of great response from my peers. Everywhere I went, they congratulated me, and that was special.? 

Singh has won five of his past six events on the PGA Tour but did not fire during the past two weeks in England. He tied for 18th at the Dunhill Links Championship and lost to Bernhard Langer in the first round in last week?s world matchplay championship at Wentworth. 

?I didn?t play poorly,? Singh said. ?He (Langer) just played better than me. The cold was a bit too much. I couldn?t play aggressively, and it?s not a course where strength really matters.? 

Singh?s task this week will be made slightly easier by the absence of Woods and most other top players. Woods, who lives locally, is skipping the event for the first time since turning pro in 1996, preferring instead to extend his honeymoon. 

Singh is the only top-10 player in the field. Jim Furyk (No. 12), Chad Campbell (No. 13) and Chris Dimarco (No. 14) are the next highest-ranked players entered. 

At the other end of the pecking order, there are just two events left for players in danger of losing their exempt status for next year. The top 125 after next week are fully exempt for 2005. 

Among them is India?s Arjun Atwal, who will have to finish among the top five to keep his fully exempt card.

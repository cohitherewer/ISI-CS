 Sharma retires

New Delhi: Medium pacer Sanjeev Sharma, who played for India in the late 80s, announced his retirement from competitive cricket on Tuesday. His first-class career spanned over two decades. 

?It is the right time. It would be good if youngsters take over now,? said the 39-year-old, who played two Tests and 23 ODIs for India. 

He claimed 22 wickets in ODIs with his best figures of five for 26 against the West Indies in the Champions Trophy in Sharjah in 1988. He also played two Tests against New Zealand and England in 1989 and 1990, respectively. 

Sharma said he idolised the late Raman Lamba and thanked him for guidance at the crucial stages of his career. ?I plan to coach under-22 and junior cricketers in Delhi. Besides, I will continue to play club cricket in England.?

 I?m prepared to handle the pressure: Karthik

Chennai: Wicketkeeper Dinesh Karthik, who replaced Parthiv Patel in the Indian squad for the fourth Test against Australia to be played from Wednesday in Mumbai, said Saturday he was mentally prepared to handle the pressure at the highest level and was keen to cement his place in the side. 

?Looking at what has happened, there is definitely pressure, but that will not affect me at all since I know that I have to be focused,? Karthik said here. ?At the same time, I must say that I have the confidence to do well in respect of whatever the job that will be given to me,? he said. 

Elated at being given the opportunity, Karthik said he was keen to prove himself at the highest level. ?I am happy and grateful for the opportunity. I have been waiting to join the team,? the 20-year-old Tamil Nadu player said. 

?This is a godsend opportunity, and I also know that I need to make a mark and try my best to be in the team always.? 

Karthik agreed that it would be a challenge keeping wickets to bowlers of the calibre of Harbhajan Singh and Anil Kumble in Test matches. 

?I will have to concentrate more and spend more time behind the wickets. Both Anil and Harbhajan are world class bowlers and they have also interacted with me earlier. Though it will be a challenge to keep wickets to them, I will be more focused on my job.?

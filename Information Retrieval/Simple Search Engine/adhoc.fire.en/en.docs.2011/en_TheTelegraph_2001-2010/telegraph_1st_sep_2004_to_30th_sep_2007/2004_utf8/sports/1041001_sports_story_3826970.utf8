Mumbai: Matthew Hayden lost little time in rediscovering his penchant for scoring on Indian soil with a breezy 67 on a rain-shortened first day of Australia?s tour opener against Ranji Trophy champions Mumbai here on Thursday. 

The left-hander struck two big sixes and seven fours in his 142-minute stay at the crease to bring back memories of his last India visit when he scored more than 500 runs in the three Test-series. 

His authoritative knock helped Australia, who elected to bat, to end the day at 159 for the loss of three wickets. 

At stumps, Damien Martyn and Brad Hodge were at the crease. Martyn looked composed in his well-made 28. Hodge was batting on six. 

Hayden was eventually deceived by Mumbai captain Sairaj Bahutule, who caught and bowled the Australian opener in the post-tea session. Hayden?s opening partner Justin Langer (24) and Simon Katich (30) were also dismissed. 

Only 210-minute of play was possible as the entire morning session had to be abandoned owing to damp conditions following heavy thundershowers. 

Once play commenced at 1:40 pm, the Australian openers began on a brisk note. Hayden pull-swept, drove and cut his way to his half century off only 61 balls. 

Hayden struck Bahutule for a huge six over long off but soon afterwards was beaten in the air by a dipping leg break and forced to offer a tame return catch when he stepped out to the bowler. 

A rush of blood soon after tea cost Langer his wicket as Ajit Agarkar continued his domination of the left-hander from the last Test series in Australia in which he had accounted for the opener five times. 

Katich, who was tried out at number three, stepped out to left-arm spinner Nilesh Kulkarni and spooned a drive to mid-wicket.

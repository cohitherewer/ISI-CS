London: Bnei Sakhnin?s pride at being the first Arab team to play in the Uefa Cup turned sour as the Israeli underdogs lost a bad-tempered first-round, first-leg match 0-2 at Newcastle United on Thursday. 

The St James? Park clash was one of the most intriguing of the evening?s 39 games, with four former European champions in action and one, Red Star Belgrade, suffering a heavy defeat. 

A series of bad tackles and two red cards spoiled the historic occasion at Newcastle where Dutch international striker Patrick Kluivert put last season?s beaten semi-finalists 2-0 up at the break before the match exploded after an hour. 

England midfielder Nicky Butt came on as a substitute for his 72nd European game but within three minutes had been sent off along with Sakhnin?s Abas Suan after a wrestling match that will not have impressed coach Graeme Souness, taking charge of Newcastle for the first time. 

?They? came here to upset us, fouling at every opportunity and we couldn?t rise above it,? Souness said. 

Newcastle lost their way after the red cards but should still progress safely in the competition?s new format, which features eight groups of five teams with three from each group advancing to a second knockout stage when they will be joined by eight sides finishing third in their Champions League groups. 

In Edinburgh, Hearts thrashed SC Braga 3-1. 

Red Star Belgrade crashed to a 0-4 defeat at Zenit St Petersburg. 

Red Star won the 1991 European Cup when representing Yugoslavia but have fallen far from those lofty standards recently, as shown by their heavy loss to the Russian league leaders. 

Now part of Serbia and Montenegro and beaten in Champions League qualifying by PSV Eindhoven, Red Star were 0-3 down at the break after Andrei Arshavin struck twice either side of an Olexander Gorshkov goal, with Alexander Kerzhakov adding the fourth early in the second half. 

Steaua Bucharest, the only other Eastern European side to win the continent?s elite competition when they triumphed in 1986, secured a 2-1 home win over CSKA Sofia. 

Feyenoord, European champions in 1970 and Uefa Cup winners three seasons ago, beat Odd Grenland 1-0 in Norway, while Portugal?s Benfica won 3-0 in Slovakia against Banska Bystrica. 

Schalke 04, winners of the last two-legged Uefa Cup final in 1997, thumped Latvia?s Liepajas Metalurgs 5-1 thanks to a hattrick by Denmark striker Ebbe Sand, playing his first match of the season after recovering from meningitis. 

The German side are without a coach following the sacking of Jupp Heynckes on Wednesday after their poor start to the Bundesliga season. 

Lazio left it late in Ukraine to beat Metalurg Donetsk 3-0 as Tommaso Rocchi, Cesar and Goran Pandev struck in the last 15 minutes, but fellow Italians Parma, 1999 Uefa Cup winners, still have work to do after struggling to a 3-2 home win over Maribor of Slovenia. 

Middlesbrough enjoyed their first-ever European match, beating Banik Ostrava 3-0 at home with goals from new strikers Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink and Mark Viduka who struck twice. 

Austria?s Graz AK thumped Litex Lovech 5-0, and Utrecht, Club Bruges and Sochaux all recorded 4-0 home wins. (Reuters)

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 SA eye India for ?07 Cup preparations

NILESH BHATTACHARYA 

Calcutta: Back in 1998, Matthew Hayden joined a group of batsmen and spinners, sent by Australian Cricket Academy, for a training stint in Chennai. The left-hand opener blossomed with the lessons learnt from that experience during Australia?s visit to India in 2001 and held upperhand over an otherwise ravaging Indian spin attack. 

Perhaps, taking a cue from Hayden?s experience, South Africa too are planning to send some of their budding batsmen to India to learn the art of negotiating spin. A group of spinners may also join them in a move, aimed at turning ?a new-look team into world beaters before the 2007 World Cup?. 

According to Omar Henry, chairman of the South African selection panel, the United Cricket Board of South Africa (UCBSA) is exploring ?quite a few options,? including organising a stint for their cricketers with the Bangalore-based National Cricket Academy. 

?Our board has a number of plans on the discussion table. I also held talks with my counterpart here (Kiran More) and other board officials. Once we return home, we?ll discuss those plans with our board and act accordingly,? Henry said at Eden Gardens on Tuesday. 

Meanwhile, the South Africa A team?s tour of India is also in the offing. ?We?d been trying to organise the tour for quite sometime but it didn?t take place. However, the move is very much on,? Henry revealed. 

When asked about this, Board of Control for Cricket in India secretary S.K. Nair told The Telegraph that the board is yet to fix a time for such a tour. 

?What I can tell you at present is that both boards are discussing a number of issues, but nothing has been finalised,? he said.

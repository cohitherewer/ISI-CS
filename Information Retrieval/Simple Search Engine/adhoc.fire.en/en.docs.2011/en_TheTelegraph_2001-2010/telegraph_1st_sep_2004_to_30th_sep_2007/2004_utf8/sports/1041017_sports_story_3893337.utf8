 Venus Arising has edge 

 HONKY DORY

 Formal Invitation, Venus Arising, Gold Star , Elite Zone and Southern Regent are the chief contenders in a field of 12 vying for honour in the 2,000m Nanoli Stud Pune Derby, the star attraction in Sunday?s nine-event card. While Formal Invitation and Southern Regent are new to the Pune course, the home turf advantage tilts the scales in favour of Venus Arising and Gold Star. However, the fact that the Cooji Katrak-trained Venus Arising is bred to stay the Derby course more comfortably than the rest in the field, the Steinbeck-Lei filly is fancied to win the whopping purse of about Rs 27 lakh in the hands of jockey Mallesh Narredu.

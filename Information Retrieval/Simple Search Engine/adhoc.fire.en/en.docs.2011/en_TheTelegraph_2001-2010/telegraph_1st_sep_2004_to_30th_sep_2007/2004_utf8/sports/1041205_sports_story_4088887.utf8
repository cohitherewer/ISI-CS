 Moon Emperor lifts Guineas 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Moon Emperor?s 

 late surge, inside the last furlong, dashed hopes of the 

 favourite Aperitivo in the 1,600m Calcutta 2,000 Guineas, 

 the star attraction in Saturday?s eight-event card. David 

 Badel partnered the Daniel David-trained 11-4 second favourite 

 to a length victory. It was a chance mount for Badel. The 

 declared rider B. Prakash had broken his ribs after he fell 

 off from Fine Choice in Bangalore on Friday.

 Moon Emperor displayed amazing improvement after the Poonawallas stud bred horse was hard put to beat Vijay Singh?s Elistano in his preparatory run leading to the Guineas. Vijay had lined up five of his best youngsters in the Guineas? field and yet his stock had no answer to the finishing power of the Placerville-Menorah son. Nevertheless, Daniel was in total command on the day, winning four races on the trot, including the Hong Kong Jockey Club Trophy ? the baby race.

 We are hungry for win: Jayawardene

 - It?s time for us to break the ice: Taibu

Rawalpindi: Zimbabwe captain Tatenda Taibu aims to break a losing streak of 12 limited-overs Internationals Saturday when he leads his young side against Sri Lanka in a must-win triangular series game. ?It?s time now for us to break the ice and win a game,? Taibu said here. 

Pakistan have already qualified for the October 16 final after beating Zimbabwe twice and thrashing Sri Lanka by eight wickets in Karachi on Wednesday. Zimbabwe have lost all their ODIs since leading players revolted against the Zimbabwe Cricket Union in April 2004. 

However, under Taibu, Zimbabwe gave Pakistan a scare in the first two games last week. They narrowly lost the second game in Peshawar by three wickets after posting a fighting target of 252 for four. 

?The boys really performed well in certain areas in which we were struggling before, so we?ve taken lots of positives from the game in Peshawar and hopefully put them into the game tomorrow,? Taibu said. 

Zimbabwe also put up a spirited fight against Sri Lanka at the ICC Champions Trophy in England last month before losing by four wickets, mainly due to the inexperience of its backup bowlers. ?Experience can?t be bought in a shop,? Taibu said.?The more games we play against tougher teams the more experience we get, so it?s only a matter of time.? 

Sri Lanka?s middle-order batsmen failed to capitalise on a solid century partnership between captain Maravan Atapattu and Sanath Jayasuriya in Karachi, as Pakistan restricted them to 232 for nine off their 50 overs. A double century partnership between Yousuf Youhana and Shoaib Malik earned the home team a convincing eight-wicket win and also a place in the final. 

?We did not play well (in Karachi). We made lots of mistakes and we want to rectify them Saturday,? said Sri Lankan vice-captain Mahela Jayawardene. ?Zimbabwe have improved a lot. We have played them maybe in 10 one-day games in the last 12 months and they have gotten used to playing against us,? Jayawardene said. 

Jayawardene warned that his team was hungry for victory. ?We don?t take any opponents lightly because we don?t want to lose any match. We go in our attitude where we win every match, doesn?t matter who the opponent is.?

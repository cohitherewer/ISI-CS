 Akram adds fuel to pitch controversy 

New Delhi: Former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram added fuel to the raging controversy over the pitch laid out for India?s third Test against Australia by blaming the hosts? lack of communication skills for the whole controversy. 

Akram said Tuesday that every team had the right to exploit home advantage and it was the job of the captain and coach to ensure they got the kind of pitch that suited their strengths. 

?I don?t know if there was any communication gap, but it is the responsibility of the captain and the coach to speak to the authorities and get the pitch they want. Winning is a team effort, and it involves not just the 15 or 16 players but also the board, the groundsmen and others,? Akram said. 

?What kind of wickets are Pakistan or India going to get when they go to Australia? That is what home advantage is all about.? (PTI)

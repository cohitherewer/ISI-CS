 US seek to restore pride

 - Davis Cup Semis

 Scent of title motivates Andy Roddick 

 Davis Cup is the most important event left in the year for Roddick 

Charleston: Hot favourites the US will seek to restore lost pride when they take on Belarus in the Davis Cup semi-final starting on Friday. 

Humiliated by Europe in Ryder Cup golf and stung by the absence of an American male in the US Open tennis semis for the first time since 1986, the United States hope to reverse their sullen September sporting start with victory. 

World No. 2 Andy Roddick, Olympic silver-medallist Mardy Fish and doubles twins Bob and Mike Bryan will lead the charge against a Belarus team that upended Russia and Argentina en route to the showdown. 

?This is definitely the most important thing left for me as far as tennis goes this year,? Roddick told newsmen. 

?Coming into this year I wanted to win a major and I wanted to have a shot at being number one... but they are just not on the cards for me as far as this year goes,? said Roddick, who relinquished his 2003 US Open title in the quarter finals earlier this month. ?But one thing still alive this year is this title.? 

The tie, the first between the two countries, will be played on the hardcourts of Charleston?s Family Circle Tennis Center. The winner will face France or Spain in December for the coveted trophy. Spain host that semi-final in Alicante. 

The US last reached the Davis Cup final in 1997 and last won the Cup two years earlier, in 1995. Belarus have never advanced this far in Davis Cup play. 

?My goal is to get us back in the running to win the Davis Cup every year, and have a real good shot at winning it every year. I think we are in that position now,? said US captain Patrick McEnroe. ?We have a group of guys who are real passionate about winning this.? 

The Americans swept past Austria and Sweden to make the semis. 

In Davis Cup singles play, both Mirnyi and Roddick are a perfect 4-0 this year, while Fish ? who beat Mirnyi in the Athens Olympics ? has a 1-1 record and second Belarus player Vladimir Voltchkov is 3-1. 

Teenagers Andrei Karatchenia and Alexander Skrypko join Mirnyi and Voltchkov on the Belarus squad. 

Although underdogs, the Belarussians say the pressure is on the Americans to perform. 

?The fact that they are playing at home, they are expected to win,? former twice US Open doubles champion Mirnyi said. ?There will be much more support for them so that makes it much tougher for them to play. They must feel like they are under pressure.? 

Two singles matches will be played on Friday, the doubles rubber Saturday and the two reverse singles matches on Sunday if needed. 

Roddick and Fish will handle singles duties for the US with the Bryan twins playing doubles. Mirnyi and Voltchkov could be the only players to see action for Belarus. 

?The fact that we grew up together since the age of four and that we?ve played Davis Cup for the past 10 to 12 years together makes it much more special and unique, and every time we play we do well,? Mirnyi said of his doubles play with Voltchkov. 

 Hewitt eyes Aussie record 

Meanwhile, Lleyton Hewitt is on the verge of breaking one of the proudest records in Australian tennis as his country prepares to face Morocco in the Davis Cup World Group play-off. The US Open runner-up has already won 24 Davis Cup singles matches and needs one more to eclipse Adrian Quist?s Australian record established in the 1930s and 40s. 

Hewitt equalled Quist?s mark during the first-round defeat by Sweden in February and seems certain to go past it in the tie with Morocco which starts in Perth on Friday. 

Now No. 3 in the world, the 23-year-old?s chances of breaking Quist?s record have been boosted by the withdrawal of Morocco?s two best players, Hicham Arazi and Younes el Aynaoui. (Reuters)

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Sikkim seek Bhaichung pep-talk

 A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Just like star batsman Sachin Tendulkar was asked by Mumbai coach Chandrakant Pandit to give a pep-talk on the eve of the side?s match against Australia at the Brabourne Stadium recently, Bhaichung Bhutia, Sikkim?s famous son, too has been approached by his home state for support. 

Sikkim are preparing for the Santosh Trophy beginning October 14 in New Delhi. And Sikkim football authorities want Bhaichung?s presence during practice. The star striker, who was at the Salt Lake Stadium on Tuesday to witness the IFA Shield match between Mohammedan Sporting and Bangladesh Muktijoddha Sangsad, said that he had been asked to speak to the Sikkim boys. 

Sikkim have been placed in group VIII with Orissa and Pondicherry and Bhaichung, who has never played for his home state, feels Sikkim have a realistic chance to make the quarter finals. 

However, he is unsure whether he would be able to travel to Sikkim to lend his support. The striker, recovering from injury, feels that he needs another 10 days to get back into shape.

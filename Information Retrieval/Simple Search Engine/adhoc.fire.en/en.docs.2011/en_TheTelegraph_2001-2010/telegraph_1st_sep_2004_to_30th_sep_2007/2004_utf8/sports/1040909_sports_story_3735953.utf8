The Telegraph - Calcutta

 I was confident about Rahul, says Sourav

 - ?Irfan has the heart to face a challenge head-on? 

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI 

 Harbhajan Singh and Sourav Ganguly arrive for the ICC awards function in London on Tuesday 

London: Rahul Dravid expressed ?surprise? at having received the two most prized awards instituted by the International Cricket Council, but his selection certainly didn?t surprise his captain, Sourav Ganguly. 

?I was confident Rahul would score, simply because of his Test achievements in the past year... A double hundred at the start of last season (versus New Zealand, at home), a double in Australia and another double hundred in Pakistan... And, you must remember, Australia and Pakistan have the best attack...? Sourav told The Telegraph on Wednesday morning. 

[Dravid, incidentally, did a Bradman by posting three double hundreds in one season. Moreover, he finished with a Bradman-like average ? 95.46.] 

Sourav added: ?Obviously, Rahul puts a heavy price on his wicket and, from the team?s point of view, gets runs when most needed... I?ve always respected him and, really, a captain can?t ask for a more determined batsman in his XI...? 

Talking about Irfan Pathan, adjudged the Emerging Player of the Year, he said: ?I doubt if anybody is going to dispute the selection... Irfan has been improving with every game and I don?t think he will be under more pressure after this award... He?s sensible and, most important, has the heart to face a challenge head-on.? 

Irfan, by the way, maintained his confidence is ?going to grow.? 

According to Sourav, the awards have come at the ?best moment? ? just a few days before the Champions Trophy.

 US need a miracle to upstage Europe

 - Ryder Cup 

- We won?t give up, says Phil Mickelson

Bloomfield Hills: The US team were left needing a final-day miracle escape after Europe maintained their stranglehold of the 35th Ryder Cup on Saturday. With three wins from the afternoon foursomes, Europe secured their biggest-ever lead of 11-5 going into Sunday?s final-day singles at Oakland Hills. 

That left Europe needing just three wins out of 12 to retain the trophy, 14 1/2 points would win it outright for the fourth success in the last five matches. 

The Americans famously overhauled a 10-6 deficit at Brookline in 1999 but the Europeans are universally acknowledged to have a far stronger team in depth this year and US skipper Hal Sutton?s line-up face a virtual mission impossible. 

?There?s not a lot I can say. We have been outplayed to this point,? said Sutton. ?We?ll have to come out charging tomorrow ? there?s no doubt about that.? 

His opposite number, Bernhard Langer, said: ?We are very, very close. We have 11 points now. We need three more and I think we can do that.? 

The US players were under no illusions over the size of their task. ?Obviously it?s going to take something exceptional in the singles and the way the Europeans are playing, it?s very unlikely,? summed up Phil Mickelson. 

?But we never give up, we won?t give up tomorrow. We overcame a huge deficit in 1999. We know we can do it, we?ve done it before but it?s going to be difficult.? 

The US had trailed overnight 6 1/2-1 1/2 points after a record European opening-day points haul on Friday but they reduced the lead to 8-4 after taking 2 1/2 points from the Saturday morning fourballs. 

It could have been better for the Americans but Europe?s rookie pair of David Howell and Paul Casey won the final two holes to snatch a crucial point in the final fourball, one-up. 

Bernhard Langer?s European team regrouped in the afternoon and Darren Clarke and Lee Westwood snatched the first point of the foursomes when they cruised to a 5 amp;4 win over Jay Haas and Chris DiMarco. 

Haas had a short but slick four-foot putt at the 14th but it sneaked by the cup to sum up the 50-year-old?s round in which he missed a string of chances. 

Behind them, Mickelson and David Toms of the US salvaged some of their lost form ? both were dropped for Saturday morning fourballs ? and beat Miguel Angel Jimenez and Thomas Levet by 4 amp;3 to make the overall score 9-5. 

Elsewhere, though, there was nothing but a bleak picture for the Americans who last won the Ryder Cup in 1999. Sergio Garcia and Luke Donald of Europe were taken to the final green by Jim Furyk and Fred Funk but won by one hole. 

Tiger Woods and Davis Love completed a miserable afternoon for the US by crashing 4 amp;3 to Irishmen Padraig Harrington and Paul McGinley after leading at one stage by two holes. Langer had earlier been simply relieved that Europe had avoided a possible clean sweep of four fourballs points thanks to rookies Casey and Howell winning the last two holes to beat Furyk and Chad Campbell. 

He saw that result as a possible turning point in the overall match. ?Howell and Casey worked magnificently,? he said. ?They came into the contest with their A-games and I?m proud of both of them. 

?Their win was vital because we all know that momentum swings are common in this game. They played some of the best golf you will ever see from two partners making their debut the Ryder Cup.? 

Garcia and Westwood halved their thrilling morning match with Haas and DiMarco after both Europeans missed putts for victories over the closing two holes. 

But Woods and his rookie partner Chris Riley steam-rollered Clarke and Ian Poulter 4 amp;3 and Colin Montgomerie and Harrington failed to keep their winning run going, falling 3 amp;2 to Stewart Cink and Love. 

Montgomerie, a first day double-winner for the Europeans, asked to be rested after his morning?s exertions but was still out on the course to cheer on his teammates.

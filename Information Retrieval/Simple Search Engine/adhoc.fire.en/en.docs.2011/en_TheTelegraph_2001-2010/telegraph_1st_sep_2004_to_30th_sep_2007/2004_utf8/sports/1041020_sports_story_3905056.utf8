 Dokic back with dad

Belgrade: Jelena Dokic, who has plunged in WTA rankings, says she?s back in the fold of her controversial father as she tries to revive her tennis career. 

The 21-year-old, who was No. 4 in the world in 2002 and now is 105th, as returned to Serbia to her father, Damir, whom she only recently accused of wrecking her career, Belgrade?s Sport Daily wrote Tuesday. 

?I?m starting from the scratch,? Dokic told the paper. ?I have two to three months to prepare before my next tournament.? 

Dokic, former semi-finalist at Wimbledon, had been estranged from her family after a brief relationship with Brazilian racing driver Enrique Benoldi and after she started training with Croatian coach Borna Bikic in 2003. Damir Dokic accused Bikic of ?drugging? her. 

She said earlier this year that reports that her estranged father had asked for her to undergo psychiatric and drug testing had made it unlikely the pair would ever reconcile. 

Damir Dokic was his daughter?s former coach and mentor. He moved the family from Australia to Serbia-Montenegro in 2001 after claiming organisers of the Australian Open had rigged the draw against his daughter. (AP)

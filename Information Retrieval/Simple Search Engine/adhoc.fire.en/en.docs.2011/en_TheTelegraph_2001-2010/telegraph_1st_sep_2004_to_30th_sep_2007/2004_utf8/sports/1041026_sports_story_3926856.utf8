The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Atwal: I was mentally too tired to care

SUJIT BHAR

Calcutta: It was a trifle strange that three pretty indifferent rounds were followed by a superb eight-under fourth (64) in the $ 4.2 million Funai Classic at Disney World, Orlando, for Arjun Atwal on Sunday. But Atwal himself isn?t too worried or amazed. ?After all these months of tournament play (30 on the US PGA Tour), I didn?t really care. I was mentally too tired. 

?I hope I could figure out how the fourth round happened? it was putting, for sure, though,? he told The Telegraph over phone from Orlando. 

It has been a while since he has been around the US of A, and though this was his best round score (score-wise, at eight under) on the entire Tour season, he doesn?t really rate it tops. 

?At Hartford, my 64 final round (though just six under for that course), was to me the best,? Atwal says. ?That pushed me to 13 th spot.? Here he finished 33 rd, despite ?not really being focussed.? ?But Hartford, that was a tougher course.? 

On the back of his mind, though, he was sure he had retained his card for next season ? he has finished at rank 143, one down from last week. 

And then, this morning, it happened. As it happens to all pros. ?I woke up and was getting ready to go off and tee. Then I realised the season is over. Now I don?t know what to do.? 

I?m not going to touch my clubs for some time now. Will be back with serious golf after the wedding in the family. 

The big disappointment remains. Despite having reached a fine position as the first and only Indian on the toughest Tour in the world, Atwal has no Indian sponsor. He uses the Ping bag and their iron, and Callaway drivers, and hits Titleist balls. But that is all. 

?I had approached some Indian firms on this but have not got any positive response from any. They say they aren?t too interested in golf,? said Atwal. Yet, these same companies are often seen in big-ticket Indian golf sponsorships. ?Maybe, if I were a superstar?? 

The circuit itself is very professional. ?They give you cars, they organise events, health insurance is free? there?s a lot to learn in there.? 

Wife Ritika, meanwhile, is easing up. She and son Krishen travel with Arjun a lot. ?He?s a very good son of a golfing pro,? she said with obvious pride. ?He, too flies around with us, and I?m sure soon Krishen Atwal will pick up his own frequent flier miles.?

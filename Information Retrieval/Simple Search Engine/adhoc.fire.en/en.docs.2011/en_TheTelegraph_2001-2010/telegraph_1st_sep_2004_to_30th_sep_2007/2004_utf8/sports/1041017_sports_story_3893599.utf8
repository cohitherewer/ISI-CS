 Jayasuriya spins Lanka to crown 

 Sri Lanka players with the tri-series trophy after defeating Pakistan by 119 runs in the final in Lahore on Saturday 

Lahore: Sanath Jayasuriya spun a web around the Pakistan batsmen as Sri Lanka defeated the hosts by 119 runs to win the tri-series final on Saturday. 

In reply to Sri Lanka?s 287 for seven in 50 overs, Pakistan were all out for 168 in 38 overs, Jayasuriya picking five wickets for 17. The defeat means Pakistan once again failing to win a tri-series tournament at home. 

In a stunning reversal of form, Sri Lanka, having lost their previous two league games to the hosts, successfully defended a total of 287 despite difficult conditions caused by heavy dew under lights. 

Pakistan started well and reached 85 for one at one stage, but then lost their last nine wickets for 83. 

Jayasuriya made up for the absence of Muttiah Muralidharan by having a great day with the ball after being introduced into the attack in the 24th over. 

He was ably supported by leg spinner Upul Chandana who finished with three for 56. 

Both made the ball turn appreciably and skid to cause havoc in the Pakistan line-up. 

It was Sri Lanka?s third major win at the Gaddafi Stadium, after having won the 1996 World Cup final and the Asian Test Championship final in 2002. 

But it was something of a surprise coming after the final league match on Thursday when Pakistan had successfully chased a target of 293. 

They started the chase well again on Saturday as openers Salman Butt (40) and Yasir Hameed (18) put on 40 in nine overs before Dilhara Fernando uprooted Hameed?s leg stump with his first ball. 

Butt and Shoaib Malik (37 from 55 balls) then put on 45 in steady fashion, before Butt was bowled by Chandana. 

Then came the key moment when seasoned left-arm pacer Chaminda Vaas got the prized wicket of Inzamam-ul Haq in the 20th over to leave Pakistan on 91 for three. 

Vaas, who went for 23 runs in his first spell of four overs, trapped the big man lbw for four with a sharp in-dipper. 

Jayasuriya had the experienced Yousuf Youhana stumped by Kumar Sangakkara for seven and Abdul Razzaq caught at slip by Dilshan.

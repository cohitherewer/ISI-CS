The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Critical view must take into account a season or year? not one or two innings: Sourav

 - ?Sachin is going to be hungry and that will get reflected in his batting? He?s also going to be our fifth bowler? 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Nagpur: There?s a question mark over Sourav Ganguly leading Team India in the third Test, here, but the captain himself is mentally preparing to play. The match isn?t many hours away, yet Sourav took time off to speak to The Telegraph at the Pride Hotel. 

The following are excerpts 

On his half-way thoughts 

Australia are ahead (1-0) but, frankly, any side can win this series... Are we under more pressure? Not really... After all, Australia are supposed to be the No.1 team and, so, they have to live up to that ranking... Today, they may be ahead, but haven?t won the series... 

On the break after the second (Chennai) Test 

It wasn?t that long... I reached home on the 19th and left on the 23rd... In any case, the days just flew and one must not judge breaks going by the telecast dates... In principle, though, one does need to ease off in the midst of a hard campaign. 

On whether, a week later, he still feels the Chennai Test was poised fifty-fifty 

Absolutely... We could have won, equally, Australia would have fancied their chance. 

On Sachin Tendulkar?s return 

It?s nice to have a great player back... Moreover, he?s going to be hungry and that will surely get reflected in his batting. In fact, Sachin is also going to be our fifth bowler. 

On whether Sachin?s availability has given India psychological points 

But such points don?t win you either a Test or series. To finish better than Australia, we?ve got to consistently play good cricket for ten days... 

On Irfan Pathan getting injured at quite the wrong time 

Can?t be helped... We?ll miss Irfan, but Ajit Agarkar too has the ability to pick wickets and has a fine record against Australia. 

On whether he is surprised at Brett Lee not having a role so far 

Well, in recent times, it has been apparent that Glenn McGrath, Jason Gillespie and Michael Kasprowicz have been Australia?s three best quicks... I, for one, haven?t been surprised at Lee?s exclusion. 

On whether our thinktank would make somebody with star-rating regularly sit on the sidelines 

Why not? Hasn?t Anil Kumble been omitted overseas in a one-spinner-only situation? He?s definitely a bigger player... 

On whether Sunil Gavaskar?s appointment as consultant has led to conflicting opinion in the dressing room 

There?s no clash... Actually, it?s good to have different views because, then, the options are more. I listen to Sunny, I listen to (coach) John Wright and I listen to (vice-captain) Rahul Dravid... Eventually, of course, the decisions are mine. 

On following a game plan suggested either by Wright or Gavaskar 

(Interrupting) But plans keep changing as, out in the middle, you can?t always ?control? the trend in the manner you want... A captain has to be flexible, has to adapt. 

On whether he is under pressure as batsman 

Because of a couple of failures? No... I?ve done well in each of the last three Test series? (versus New Zealand at home, in Australia and in Pakistan) and I?m not going to judge myself on the basis of low scores in the second innings of the first Test (Bangalore) and the first innings in Chennai... (After a pause) In India, people should stop judging after just one or two innings... If this continues, you may have a situation of having to pick fresh faces every second Test. I?ve always maintained a critical view must take into account either a season or a year... I can?t talk of what Bradman did, but I can?t think of any player who made significant contributions each time he took the field. (Again, after a pause) I should add nobody becomes a great player either by scoring big or getting a rich haul in one or two innings... Both ways, then, it?s the same. 

On his thoughts at the end of a disappointi ng day 

I look ahead... I tell myself that tomorrow will be another day and that I?m going to get a chance to do better... I don?t dwell on the past. 

On whether he regrets having promoted Yuvraj Singh as opener in Chennai 

I don?t... Ideally, he must get a decent run (as opener)... 

On Parthiv Patel getting a long rope 

That?s your assessment... I agree he kept poorly in Chennai, but has it in him to get it right... I don?t think he has a technique-related problem standing up (to the spinners). Surely, he isn?t the first Indian ?keeper to drop catches... Please mark my words, Parthiv has the ability. However, let?s see what he does in the third Test. 

On whether Adam Gilchrist has been a ?softer? captain compared to a Steve Waugh 

(Grins) No two persons are the same, so how can two captains be so? Gilchrist is different, yes, but should be judged on effectiveness and not whether he is soft or otherwise. 

On what separates the Australians from the rest 

Even when you?re on top, their resistance is that much harder... They don?t let go. 

On whether Kumble?s form (18 wickets in the first two Tests) has been India?s biggest plus 

He has definitely made a huge impression, but Bhajji (Harbhajan Singh) hasn?t been far behind. Virender Sehwag?s 155 in Chennai falls in the same bracket. 

On India?s No.1 failing 

The top-order not getting runs... Even before this series started, I?d said we need big totals to beat Australia... That hasn?t changed. 

On whether, at this half-way stage, he feels that one Australian is more dangerous than the rest 

All XI are dangerous... In Bangalore, Michael Clarke and Gilchrist got runs at a difficult time, while Damien Martyn did that in Chennai... But for his century, the Test would have been over inside four days. 

On not being able to ?avail? of the home advantage here 

As I remarked at the Media conference, I did ask for grass to be removed... The curator (Kishore Pradhan), though, doesn?t seem to have done much... I don?t think there?s anything wrong in trying to make the most of home conditions... Every country takes advantage and, so, why not us? 

Finally, on whether another inspirational movie (like the one on icon-cyclist Lance Armstrong) will be watched by Team India 

(Laughs) You?ve got to ask John...

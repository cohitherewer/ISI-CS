 SA coach to focus on building ?solidarity?

 Smith should take charge of on-the-field aspects, feels Jennings 

Durban: South African cricket coach Ray Jennings said on Sunday his prime focus would be to build ?solidarity? within his team and not take ?too seriously? India?s series defeat against Australia. 

South Africa are to embark on a two-Test tour of India from November 14, beginning with a three-day match against Board President?s XI in Jaipur. ?My focus is on preparing the team for the two Tests (against India). I am not worried about the effect of the Australian success on the Indians,? Jennings said. 

Jennings, who took over from Eric Simons said, ?to me it is most important to get our attitude right.? 

?I get the impression that in recent times, the openness and honesty have been missing. The players should have respect for one another. ?I want to see them greet each other in the morning when they have breakfast and take time out to find out how each one is. 

?Too many things happened which drove the players apart. Those stumbling blocks have to be removed and the guys must look each other in the eyes and work together on an equal footing for the benefit of the team and of South African cricket,? he said. 

?Graeme Smith as captain should take the responsibility for the cricketing aspects on the field and, as coach, I?ll work towards a happy atmosphere in the team,? he added. 

Jennings said he had spoken to the coach of Springbok rugby team to gather a tip or two about their success. 

Jennings said the rugby coach?s suggestion to the cricketers have been to ?re-inculcate the values of respect for one another when they gather for their training camp in Pretoria next week?. 

Jennings has already said that South Africa should not expect too much from his team, which includes a number of new faces. 

Opening batsman Herschelle Gibbs was not picked after he expressed his misgivings about travelling to India in view of Delhi police wanting to interrogate the batsman over match-fixing allegations.

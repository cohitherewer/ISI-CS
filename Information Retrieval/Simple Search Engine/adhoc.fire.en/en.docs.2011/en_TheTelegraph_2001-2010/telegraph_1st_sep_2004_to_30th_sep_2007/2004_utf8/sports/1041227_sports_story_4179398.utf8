 Abhijit Gupta defeated Nguyen Van Huy 

Bikaner: India?s Abhijit Gupta stole the round VI honours defeating Nguyen Van Huy of Vietnam in the 27th Asian junior chess championship here on Saturday. 

Van Huy, who had lost to S. Poobesh Anand in the fifth round on Saturday, failed to match the tactical skills of Gupta, who appeared in the best of forms with his white pieces. 

Gupta joined International Master Poobesh Anand and former national sub-junior champion S. Arun Prasad in lead along with former champion IM Deepan Chakravarthy on 4.5 points out of a possible 6. 

Anand and Prasad had earlier settled for a draw. 

Arghyadip Das, a product of Calcutta?s Goodricke National Chess Academy is half point adrift of the leading group on 4 points along with Huy, while top seed Anton Fillipov of Uzbekistan leads the challenge on 3.5 points. 

Five more rounds remain in this prestigious annual event that determines the best under-20 player in Asia. 

The girls? section witnessed a twist as Soumya Swaminathan defeated sole leader Hoand Thi Bao Tram of Vietnam. 

Following the unexpected result, women Grandmaster D. Harika joined Tram in lead on five points after six rounds with a finely crafted victory over compatriot Kruttika Nadig.

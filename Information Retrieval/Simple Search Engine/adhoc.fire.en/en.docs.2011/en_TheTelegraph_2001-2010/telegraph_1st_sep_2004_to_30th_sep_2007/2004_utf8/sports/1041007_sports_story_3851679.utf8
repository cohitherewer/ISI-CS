 Davenport looks at year-end retirement

Filderstadt (Germany): Lindsay Davenport might be number one at the end of the year. She might also be retired. The 28-year-old American this week has the opportunity to reclaim the number one ranking while competing in the Filderstadt Grand Prix. If it does not happen this week, it will almost certainly happen by the end of the season. 

But that does not alter any ideas she has harboured about retiring. ?In my mind nothing?s changed,? Davenport said here ahead of her opening match Wednesday. It was in this German town that she first took over the number one ranking six years ago. 

Currently ranked two behind France?s Amelie Mauresmo, Davenport said: ?I still feel I?m more towards the end of my career than anything else. I still haven?t decided what I?m going to do. My focus is on finishing this year and doing well and not worrying about what happens after 2004. I?m in a great position to try and finish the year number one. 

?That?s my goal now and to try to win some of these tournaments. It?s exciting. I?ve won six titles already and I?d love to be able to add to that, and then I?ll see.? 

Davenport won four consecutive meets during the American hardcourt season and went into the US Open as one of the favourites. But she suffered a hip injury and struggled to complete her semi-final against eventual champion Svetlana Kuznetsova, losing 1-6, 6-2, 6-4. 

Being unable to claim her fourth Grand Slam title was a bitter blow and regaining number one would definitely be second best in her mind. ?Winning the US Open would have meant a lot more than becoming No.1 and that?s really what I was aiming for,? said Davenport, ranked No. 1 in January 2002.

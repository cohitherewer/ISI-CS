The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Azhar Mahmood, Wharf included

London: England, Pakistan and South Africa have been allowed to replace injured players in their Champions Trophy squads, the International Cricket Council (ICC) said on Saturday. 

England have included all rounder Alex Wharf in place of seamer Kabir Ali, while Pakistan have replaced Shabbir Ahmed with Azhar Mahmood. 

South Africa have also brought Charl Langeveldt into the squad in place of Andre Nel. The 12-team ICC Champions Trophy starts on Friday, with each team playing at least two matches. 

The PCB said that Shabbir had been diagnosed with a knee injury, a combination of cartilage tear and bone bruising. 

It is an unfortunate injury because Shabbir is one of our more improved bowlers, he said. He will return home soon to have treatment for his injury, which we hope is not serious. 

Azhar last played in a one-dayer against New Zealand in January.

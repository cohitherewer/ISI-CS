The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Decision expected on Sunday

 A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: The awarding of television rights for the next four years by the Board of Control for Cricket in India should be clear on Sunday when its marketing committee meets in Chennai. 

That will be preceded, on Saturday, by a meeting of its TV rights committee, also in Chennai. The committee has sought clarifications from the two highest bidders Zee and ESPN-STAR Sports. 

BCCI secretary S. K. Nair, one of the members of both the TV rights committee and marketing committee, will not be present as he will be in Monaco for an International Cricket Council meeting. 

At full-strength, the TV rights committee has five members while the marketing committee has 13.

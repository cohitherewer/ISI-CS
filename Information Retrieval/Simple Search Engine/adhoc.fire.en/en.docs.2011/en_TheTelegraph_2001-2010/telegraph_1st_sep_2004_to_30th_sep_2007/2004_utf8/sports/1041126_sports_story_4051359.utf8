Moscow: Under-strength France reached their third Fed Cup final by whitewashing Spain 5-0 on Thursday. 

The defending champions won despite missing world No. 2 Amelie Mauresmo and injured Mary Pierce. Nathalie Dechy sealed the winning third point beating Anabel Medina Garrigues 6-3, 6-1 on Thursday. 

Sixteen-year-old Tatiana Golovin, playing in her first Fed Cup tie, then eased past Marta Marrero, who replaced Maria Sanchez Lorenzo for the dead fourth rubber, 6-3, 6-4. 

The doubles team of Emilie Loit and Marion Bartoli beat Virginia Ruano Pascual and Marrero 7-5, 6-2 in the final match. 

Russia hold a commanding 2-0 lead over Austria in the other semi-final, thanks to victories by Anastasia Myskina and Svetlana Kuznetsova on Wednesday. (Reuters)

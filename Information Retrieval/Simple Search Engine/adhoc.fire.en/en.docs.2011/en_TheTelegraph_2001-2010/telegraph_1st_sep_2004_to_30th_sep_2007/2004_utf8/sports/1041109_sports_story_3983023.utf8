The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Royal revs up for a bash

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: In 1999 the Royal Calcutta Golf Club hosted its last Indian Open and Calcutta boy Arjun Atwal won it. Then the Open shifted to New Delhi. 

Where Atwal went thereafter we all know, but the days on the fabled fairways of the second-oldest golf club in the world (after the Royal and Ancient of St Andrews) hadn?t been quite the same. 

In its 175th of rolling greens, however, the RCGC will soon have many more stories to tell. To ensure this, and to project a highly positive outlook, the Royal (one of 61 clubs around the world under the Royal Charter), will host, in association with The Telegraph, and presented by Airtel, a week of celebrations starting November 20. 

More importantly, as club captain Aveek Sarkar pointed out: ?We need to regenerate and recreate and bring it (the club) on a par with the rest of the world. 

?There are just five grade A golf courses in Asia and none at all in India?? He said the Royal in Calcutta has the potential to be among the best. 

The captain also said: ?Other sports are a luxury, while golf is a necessity for West Bengal, because it can boost investment and industrial development. Every foreign company which wishes to make a base here wants to know about its golfing facilities.? 

Eveready Industries chairman and former captain B.M. Khaitan said: ?I was around during the 150th year of the club. Those days we used to have two full 18-hole courses, but the situation was bad with encroachments? before the then chief minister Siddhartha Shankar Ray bailed the club out by buying off 50 acres for development, but also providing security to the rest. ?The club thereafter became more solvent and could take up more work.? 

That was a type of slump ? ?More downs than ups?, as the current captain put it ? before this effort at regeneration. 

To that effect, the fact that 16 of the 61 Royal clubs will be represented, and that this will be spearheaded by Richard Cole-Hamilton, captain of the 250-year-old Royal and Ancient, is in itself a recognition of the venerable nature of the club. Royal clubs from Australia, Canada, Malaysia, along with the UK, will be represented. 

The format of the tournament to be held will be amateur strokeplay. 

Top Indian golfers like Ashok Malik, R.K. Pitambar and Lakshman Singh will be seen in action. 

Adding a touch of class professionalism will be Atwal himself, off golf and on a holiday from the US PGA Tour. 

It will be more than that, really, with the likes of Airtel chief Sunil Mittal and Pawan Munjal of Hero Honda blending putts with tennis star Leander Paes and former cricket great Kapil Dev. 

The celebrations, also sponsored by ITC Sonar Bangla, Rasoi, Sula, the RPG group, Essar, TSM, Kingfisher DAKS and more, involves juniors and the senior members too. It also involves, apart from all the Royal clubs, ten Indian clubs as well.

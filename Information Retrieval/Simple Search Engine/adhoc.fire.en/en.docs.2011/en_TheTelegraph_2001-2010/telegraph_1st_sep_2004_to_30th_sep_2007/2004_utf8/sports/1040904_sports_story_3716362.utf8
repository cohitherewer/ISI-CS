New York: Defending champion Justine Henin-Hardenne scraped through to the third round of the US Open on Thursday but her progress was about as smooth as rush-hour traffic in downtown Manhattan. 

The Belgian lost her serve seven times and racked up 47 unforced errors during her 6-2, 5-7, 6-2 defeat of former Israeli soldier Tzipora Obziler and she will need a dramatic improvement if she is to advance deep into the tournament. 

American trio Andre Agassi, Lindsay Davenport and Venus Williams together with Russias Maria Sharapova all experienced a few hitches before rolling on, although French Open champions Gaston Gaudio and Anastasia Myskina were sent packing. 

Double Olympic gold medallist Nicolas Massu also came down to earth with a bump, losing a five-set thriller to Sargis Sargsian in what, at five hours 10 minutes, was the second longest match in US Open history. 

To make matters worse for the 10th-seeded Chilean he failed to convert a matchpoint at 6-5 in a fourth-set tiebreak and received a game penalty at the start of the deciding set after being warned about his behaviour. 

Earlier Henin-Hardenne, who returned from a virus to win Olympic gold, cruised through the first set against 31-year-old Obziler before her game began to disintegrate. 

Obziler, who had never got beyond the first round of qualifying in four previous visits, seized her chance to level the match before Henin-Hardenne clinched victory in just over two hours. I was worried at the end of the second set, I was in a hurry to finish it, Henin-Hardenne said. She was running all over the court and I had to work very hard. 

Twice champion Agassi briefly looked in trouble against Germanys Florian Mayer when he lost the second set 2-6 having edged a tight opener 7-5. 

Normal service was resumed when the 34-year-old sixth seed won the third 6-2 and Mayer retired early in the fourth with a leg injury to save Agassi further exertion. 

You never expect that, I dont know what his injury was but it didnt look good. I still felt like I had 40 good minutes left in me to finish the match though, said Agassi, who clocked up his 69th win at the US Open. 

With many fans snagged in traffic caused by the arrival of President Bush to Madison Square Garden for the Republican Party convention, Davenports second-round match against Spains Arantxa Parra Santonja was played in a half empty Arthur Ashe Court. The American fifth seed recovered from a wobbly start to win 6-4, 6-2 and stretch her winning streak to 19 matches. 

There were few empty seats later on, however, as Wimbledon champion Sharapova produced a mixed bag of crunching winners and sloppy errors in her 6-0, 6-7, 6-1 victory over fellow Nick Bollettieri graduate Jelena Jankovic. 

I dont think Im playing the best tennis but you dont want to be playing your best in the first two rounds, said Sharapova, who now faces Mary Pierce. 

Eleventh seed Venus Williams found herself 4-1 down against Indian-born American qualifier Shikha Uberoi before hitting back to win 11 of the next 13 games for a 7-5, 6-1 victory. 

Mens ninth seed Gaudio ripped his shorts apart in disgust during his four-set defeat by Swedens Thomas Johansson, while womens fourth seed Myskina was humbled 6-7, 3-6 by fellow Russian, 17-year-old qualifier Anna Chakvetadze. 

Britains Tim Henman led a clutch of leading men through to the third round, the fifth seed shrugging off a back injury to beat Jerome Golmard in four sets. 

Third seed Carlos Moya beat American wildcard Amer Delic in a night match, while there was bad news for two other home players as Taylor Dent and Olympic silver-medallist Mardy Fish both crashed out. 

In womens singles, Elena Bovina, winner at New Haven last week, came through 6-2, 7-5 against Maria Elena Camerin of Italy while 14th seed Nadia Petrova continued the Russian charge with a 6-2, 6-2 defeat of Australian Samantha Stosur. 

Ninth seed Svetlana Kuznetsova became the eighth Russian woman into the third round with a 6-3, 6-3 victory over Australias Nicole Pratt. 

 Double delight for Paes 

The Indo-US pair of Leander Paes and Martina Navratilova moved into the second round of mixed doubles when they beat Daniela Hantuchova (Slovakia) and Mark Knowles (Bahamas) 6-1, 7-6 (7-5). 

In mens doubles first round action, Paes and David Rikl of the Czech Republic overcame the Croatian duo of Mario Ancic and Ivan Ljubucic 6-4, 6-2. It was sweet revenge for Paes who along with Mahesh Bhupathi had lost to the same pair in the bronze-medal deciding match of the Athens Olympics last month.

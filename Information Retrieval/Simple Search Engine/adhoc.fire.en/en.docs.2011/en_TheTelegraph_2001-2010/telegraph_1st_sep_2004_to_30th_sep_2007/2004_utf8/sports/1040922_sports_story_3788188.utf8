 Camacho decided own fate: Beckham

Madrid: England captain David Beckham said on Monday that neither he nor the rest of the players were responsible for Jose Antonio Camacho?s decision to quit as Real Madrid coach after four months in the job. 

?We don?t share the blame for what has happened with Camacho,? the midfielder told a news conference at the Bernabeu hours after the coach announced his exit. 

?Ultimately it was his decision to go.? 

Beckham also rejected any suggestion that the club?s multi-millionaire squad had lacked the discipline to respond to Camacho?s methods. 

?All we want to do is to play football and to play it well,? he said. ?People can say a lot about what we do and what we earn, but on the pitch we just want to win. 

?I?ve won the Champions League (with Manchester United in 1999) and I want to win it again. I?ve won six league championships with Manchester United and I want to win a Spanish one too.? 

Beckham, who was dropped for Real?s weekend 0-1 league defeat at Espanyol, said that he had enjoyed a good relationship with Camacho and was sad to see him give up his post. 

?I didn?t know him as well as some of the other players or the fans, but he was always nice to me and was a good coach. It?s a shame he?s gone but you have to respect his decision and now I have to win the confidence of the new coach.? 

Camacho has been replaced by his assistant Mariano Garcia Remon, a former goalkeeper at the club. 

Beckham denied there had been any rift between Camacho and some of the players. ?The relationship between the squad and Camacho was very good and I?m sure none of the players had any problems with him,? he said. 

Camacho?s decision to step down as coach was prompted by his side?s stinging 0-3 defeat at Bayer Leverkusen in the Champions League and their appalling performance in their defeat at Espanyol. 

Beckham admitted the team made a poor start to the season, but said he was confident they could turn things round in the near future. ?It isn?t fun playing for any team when things aren?t going well, but we know we?ve got some of the best players in the world and we can play the sort of football that has never been seen before,? he said. 

?We?ve only played one game in the Champions League and maybe people should just relax a bit.? 

Meanwhile, new coach Garcia Remon is confident he will have the support of the players in his attempt to help the side recover from their disappointing start to the season. 

?The players are hurt and their morale isn?t high,? Garcia Remon said after taking his first training session following Camacho?s decision to quit. 

?I need the players? help and respect to turn this round and I?m sure I?ll get it,? Camacho?s former assistant said. 

Real Madrid players were greeted by a chorus of insults from some of the 50 or so fans that had gathered outside the Bernabeu as they arrived for the training session. 

But Garcia Remon appealed to the fans to lend their support to the team for his first match.

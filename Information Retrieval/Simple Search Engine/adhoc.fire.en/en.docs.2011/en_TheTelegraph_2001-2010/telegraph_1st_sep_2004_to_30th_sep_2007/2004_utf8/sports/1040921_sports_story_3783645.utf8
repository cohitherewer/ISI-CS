The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Australia aim to extend winning run

 - SEMIS vs ENGLAND - Watson likely to retain place 

 Flintoff?s form is a major boost for hosts 

London: England head into Tuesday?s Champions Trophy semi-final against Australia at Edgbaston without a win over their old rivals in their last 14 one-day Internationals. 

That last victory over the world champions came in January 1999 when a side led by Alec Stewart edged a seven-run win in a day-night match at the Sydney Cricket Ground. 

?We are always trying to find areas to improve on but if we play anywhere near our best, then we will give anyone a tough game,? said captain Ricky Ponting. 

Ponting had a few posers for England team, sharp enough to make them squirm in their seats ahead of the first semi-finals. ?It?s good to have England captain (Vaughan) come to the crease without any decent innings in the middle,? said Ponting. 

Vaughan has been in real bad form and has scored only 147 runs from last 10 matches at an average of 23.00. 

The skipper was noncommittal if Brett Lee would turn up Tuesday but there is more than a fair chance they would stick to Shane Watson. 

Ponting also made light of Andrew Flintoff?s massive presence in England line-up, both with the bat and ball. ?We have ordered to have a close look at not only him but also the rest of England batters. We will see how it turns up tomorrow.? 

The fact that ICC one-day Player of the Year Flintoff scored a century without striking the ball as cleanly as usual will enthuse England while the Australians will wonder what he is capable of in full flow. 

Meanwhile, Michael Kasprowicz is the top contender for the Man of the Tournament honour after completion of the pool stage. Kasprowicz is the only player who has picked up points from both the pool matches he has played, according to an ICC press release on Monday.

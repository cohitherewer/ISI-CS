Thomastown (Ireland): Ernie Els put behind the disappointment of three close calls at this year?s majors with a one-shot victory in the WGC-American Express Championship at Mount Juliet on Sunday. 

The smooth-swinging South African held off a strong challenge from playing partner Thomas Bjorn amid strong wind and driving rain, a three-under-par 69 earning him a maiden the World Golf Championship title. 

Els, who produced top-four finishes at the US Masters, British Open and US PGA Championship, finished on 18-under 270 to replace Tiger Woods as the world No. 2. 

?I feel great,? said the 34-year-old after winning the first prize of $1.2 million in the prestigious event, widely regarded as one rung down from the majors. It was a long, tough day and the pace of play didn?t help either. Thomas kept me on my toes right to the last shot. He just wouldn?t go away.? 

Denmark?s Bjorn, producing his best golf of the year this week after several months of painful struggle, secured second place with a 68 and Britain?s David Howell was a further four strokes back in third after a 71. 

?Obviously I am disappointed to have come up a shot short, but I?m very proud of what I?ve done this week,? said Bjorn, who took a five-week break from the game midway through the year. Els, two strokes clear of the field overnight, birdied two of the first three holes to stay in front as the mid-morning rain intensified. 

The three-times major winner sank a 16-foot birdie putt at the first and then holed out from 14 feet at the par-three third to get to 17 under. 

Bjorn, however, trimmed the South African?s lead to just one, matching his birdies at the first and third and then picking up another shot at the par-five fifth. 

The pair traded pars over the next four holes before Els regained his two-shot cushion with a birdie at the par-five 10th, where he reached the green in two. Bjorn, however, got back to within a stroke of Els when he birdied the par-three 11th by holing a 23-foot putt. 

Although the Dane faltered with a bogey at the par-three 14th after being bunkered off the tee, he bounced back with a birdie-three at the 15th, where he holed a 16-foot putt. 

Els, who had not previously won in Ireland, effectively sealed the title with his fourth birdie of the day at the par-five 17th. While he holed out there from six feet, Bjorn?s birdie attempt from 10 feet lipped out and Els had a two-shot advantage playing the last. 

The South African, who collected his only bogey of the day at the last after finding a greenside bunker with his approach, is confident he has now put behind him the bitter disappointment of failing to win any of this year?s majors.

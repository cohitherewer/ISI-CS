The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Rest of World versus Asian XI tie proposed

Karachi: A benefit match between an Asian XI and a Rest of the World side to help survivors of the tsunami is being considered, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Shaharyar Khan said on Thursday. 

Khan said he had spoken to International Cricket Council (ICC) president Ehsan Mani and details could be worked out in the next few days. 

?Initially we had proposed a match involving Pakistan, India and Sri Lanka. But the ICC has taken our proposal a step forward and is looking at a fund-raising tie between an Asian XI and World XI involving all Test playing nations,? Khan said. 

?Although the logistics behind this effort are complicated, the ICC is trying to get the cricket nations to rally and raise funds for a major humanitarian cause.? 

The ICC would not confirm the proposal but said it was discussing a range of initiatives with member countries and players in a bid to help the stricken region. 

[Our Special Correspondent in Calcutta adds: The Asian Cricket Council (ACC), headed by Jagmohan Dalmiya, is very much in the picture. Infact, the initiative for a fund-raising match or a series probably came from the ACC itself. Dalmiya, though, said it?s premature to go into specifics. 

?At this moment, a lot of things are being considered? However, it?s too early to list what exactly will be done,? he told The Telegraph late on Thursday.] 

Global aid organisations have launched appeal for donations to help the victims of the tsunami which has killed more than 120,000 people and left millions homeless. 

Sri Lanka were one of the worst hit nations and their cricket team?s tour of New Zealand has already been postponed because of the disaster. India have also been affected. 

?India confirmed on Thursday to us they were in favour of such an effort on the part of the cricket community,? Khan added. 

The PCB head said the idea was to have the fund-raising matches in Asia. 

?I think the ICC is speaking to the cricket boards and should be able to get some results in two or three days,? he said. (Reuters)

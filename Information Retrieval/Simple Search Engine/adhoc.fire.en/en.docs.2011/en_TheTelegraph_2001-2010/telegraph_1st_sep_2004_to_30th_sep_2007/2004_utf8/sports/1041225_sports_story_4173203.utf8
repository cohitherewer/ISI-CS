 Audacious 20-yr-old gets Bernie?s audience

BY KEVIN GARSIDE

Graduating to Formula One is often a lottery. You can pass the 11-plus in karts, win a junior formula in single-seaters and still end up driving taxis in Cleethorpes. Well, may be not, but the point is made. 

Save for the few, F1 is not a meritocracy. Talent is a necessary but not sufficient quality. To get on, you need cash. And plenty of it. 

In most respects, Dominik Jackson is typical. He is demonstrably able and quick. At a recent test at Donington driving a European F3000 car which, at 480bhp was four times more powerful than anything he had driven before, Jackson ripped six-tenths off the pole time set last summer by Alex Lloyd, a former Autosport Young Driver of the Year winner. 

As impressive as he was, however, Jackson is not the only kid with hot shoes in motorsport. It is in another respect that he may well be in a league of his own. The Spanish have a word for it. Cahones. We call it balls. No other word gets close to doing justice to Jackson, who is preparing to take his case to the ultimate authority in F1. 

Imagine it. A 20-year-old, know-nothing brat rings up one of the world?s richest men requesting an audience. A bit like an undergraduate ringing Tony Blair direct to complain about his overdraft, and getting through. Bernie Ecclestone ought to have put the phone down. Incredibly he didn?t. Better still, he invited him to call again to set up a meeting after Christmas. 

At the stage he is at, two seasons in Formula BMW in Germany having followed his schooling in karts, Jackson needs to get noticed as well as funds. What better way than to knock on Bernie?s door? 

The question is, what is he going to say once he steps across the threshold in Princes Gate? Ecclestone is famously intolerant of time-wasters. 

?I?m going to tell him that I have what it takes to be a F1 driver. I?m also going to tell him how I think I can get there. I?ve only raced two years in Formula BMW and I have learned that unless you are in the right team with the right support you are nowhere. Ultimately I need money. I?m going to be up front about that and invite Bernie to invest in me.? The Daily Telegraph

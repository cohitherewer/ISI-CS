 Lankan batting worries Atapattu

London: Sri Lankan skipper Maravan Atapattu has urged his side to play with greater determination or face elimination from the ICC Champions Trophy. 

The Sri Lankans face England in a pool D decider in Southampton on Friday. 

The winners will advance to the semi-finals with the losers being eliminated, and Atapattu is worried that his side does not carry the sloppy batting performance from the Zimbabwe match into the crunch game. 

?We need application more than improvement,? said Atapattu. 

?Knowing the conditions will also do a lot of good as we know what to expect, but we have got to do better.? 

The Sri Lankans will have to face England without Muttiah Muralidharan, who is recuperating after surgery on his injured shoulder. 

?We miss Murali,? said Atapattu. 

?He is a world class bowler and the leading wickettaker in the world?

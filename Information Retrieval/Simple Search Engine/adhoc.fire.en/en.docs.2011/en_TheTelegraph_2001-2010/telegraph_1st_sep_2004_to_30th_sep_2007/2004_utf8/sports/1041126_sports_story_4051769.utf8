 Uthappa, Barrington in triple-century stand 

Bangalore: A triple century partnership between openers Robin Uthappa (162) and Rowland Barrington (batting 169) propelled Karnataka to 357 for one in the first innings against Madhya Pradesh on the opening day of their Ranji Trophy Elite Group A encounter on Thursday. 

Put into bat, Karnataka had a superb start with Uthappa making his runs off 232 balls with 23 boundaries and a six while Barrington hit 21 boundaries in his unbeaten knock which came off 265 balls. 

Madhya Pradesh have only themselves to blame as they dropped both the openers, Uthappa once, and Barrington twice. 

After he completed his century, Barrington was dropped twice by Abbas Ali in the same over.

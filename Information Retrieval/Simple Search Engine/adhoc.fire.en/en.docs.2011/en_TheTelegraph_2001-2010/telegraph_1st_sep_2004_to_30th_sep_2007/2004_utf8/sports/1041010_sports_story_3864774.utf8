Manchester: A stunning goal by captain David Beckham guided England to a convincing 2-0 victory over Wales in their World Cup qualifier at his former Old Trafford home on Saturday. 

England got off to a dream start after four minutes of the group VI clash when midfielder Frank Lampard?s shot took a deflection off Michael Owen?s heel and flew into the right-hand corner beyond the reach of wrong-footed Welsh ?keeper Paul Jones. 

But there was no doubting England?s scorer in the 76th minute when Beckham, in his second season at Real Madrid after leaving Manchester United, sent a curling 25-metre shot beyond Jones for his 15th goal in his 76th international. 

A second-half hattrick by Dmitri Sychev helped Russia to an easy 4-0 win away to Luxembourg in their group III qualifier. After a goalless first half, Russia took control with strikes from Sychev in the 55th, 69th and 86th minutes and a goal from Andrei Arshavin (62nd). 

In Prague, striker Jan Koller?s first-half penalty secured the Czech Republic victory over Romania and their first points of their qualifying campaign from group I. 

The Czechs, coming off an 0-2 loss to The Netherlands, were heavily depleted in midfield with the sudden retirement of Pavel Nedved and injuries to Karel Poborsky and Vladimir Smicer. With little danger generated from the middle, the job was left to Liverpool striker Milan Baros, who created several chances with his fast pace. 

But Koller?s 36th-minute penalty was the only goal of the match, coming after a Romanian defender pulled down Martin Jiranek deep inside the box. 

Sweden outclassed a negative Hungary side 3-0 in Stockholm with goals from Fredrik Ljungberg, Henrik Larsson and Anders Svensson. 

Sweden, who lost to Croatia in their last group VIII match, controlled the game and came close to scoring two more goals in the first half either side of Ljungberg?s 26th-minute strike.

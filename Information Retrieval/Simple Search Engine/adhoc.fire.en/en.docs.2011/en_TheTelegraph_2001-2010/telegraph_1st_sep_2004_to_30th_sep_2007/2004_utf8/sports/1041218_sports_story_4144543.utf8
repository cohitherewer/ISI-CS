Melbourne: Australia, buoyed by Justin Langer?s 191, skittled out Pakistan for 179 on the second day of the first Test in Perth to take total control of the match. 

Ricky Ponting then decided against enforcing the follow-on as Australia reached 15 without loss in their second innings, for an overall lead of 217. 

Australia seamer Michael Kasprowicz took five for 30 from 16.3 overs while leg-spinner Shane Warne claimed three for 38. 

Pakistan would have been in even more disarray if it had not been for a 60-run stand between Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammad Sami for the ninth wicket. 

?If you saw how Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammad Sami batted, really it was a disgraceful performance up the front (of the order),? Woolmer said. ?There were two terrible shots...which really were unnecessary, when we were just sort of building up a partnership. It was a very frustrating day.? 

In another blow for Pakistan, Shoaib limped off the field near the end of the day, although Woolmer said he would be fit for Saturday. 

The bowler, who took five for 99 in Australia?s first innings, was also fined 40 percent of his match fee after pointing Matthew Hayden?s direction towards the dressing room following his dismissal on Thursday. 

Australia had resumed on 357 for eight at the WACA and added a further 24 runs before Langer was the last man out after a magnificent 21st Test century. 

Langer hit 19 fours and three sixes, batting for almost seven hours. Running out of partners, he was caught at point from an attempted lofted drive. 

The home side then quickly pressed home their advantage as the touring side imploded. But while Australia bowled superbly, they were helped by some wild strokeplay. 

Pakistan reached 45 for one before seven wickets tumbled for 66. Imran Farhat (18) was first to go, flicking at a ball down the leg-side from Jason Gillespie and snicking to wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist.

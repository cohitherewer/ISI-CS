The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Md. AC upset, TFA win

A CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: An error prone Mohammedan AC of Calcutta were upset 0-2 by District Football Association (DFA), Varanasi, in a group A match of the 16th Lal Bahadur Shastri Memorial meet on Tuesday. The TFA boys also won. 

Mohammedan AC now have three points from two matches and to qualify for the semi-finals they will have to beat group leaders Titanium (Kerala) on Thursday. 

Mohammedan AC were unimpressive and a misunderstanding between ?keeper Moidul Islam and the back four allowed striker J.P. Singh to score in the 65th minute. 

The Calcutta outfit attacked, but were caught napping in a counter-attack in added time. Substitute midfielder Jaynendedra Yadav capitalised on another defensive bungling to score from close. 

In group B, TFA trounced City College Old Boys, Hyderabad, 4-1. P.C. Lawanpuia (28th and 89th), Robert Lathalmuna (29) and Vimal Periyar Pen (44) scored for the winners. Maozim reduced the margin through a penalty kick in the 49th. 

Wednesday?s matches: BMFC vs City College Old 

Boys (Hyderabad) and South East Central Railway vs DFA Varanasi.

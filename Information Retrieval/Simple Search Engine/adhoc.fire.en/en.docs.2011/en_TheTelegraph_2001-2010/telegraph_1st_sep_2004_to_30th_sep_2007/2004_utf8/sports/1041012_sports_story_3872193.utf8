 Youngsters gearing up for big season 

 STAR RACER

 The cloudy weather and occasional showers were hardly a deterrent last Wednesday for the form runners who defied the soft underfoot conditions. They went about their task of delivering the goods in most of the day?s six events. However, the focus was on the two top-rated youngsters making their debut on the monsoon track ? Calorific and Sparkling Clear, the winners of the Nanoli Stud Million and the Acorn Stakes, respectively, last winter. The fact that the two fashionably-bred horses were heading for their third straight wins, it hardly came as a surprise when they carried the day in their respective events. Both, odds-on favourites, were ridden to victory by C. Alford.

 Verdict-wise, Vijay Singh?s Calorific?s was a drawing away win in the 1,400m Defence Forces Cup, compared to brother Bharath?s Sparkling Clear?s one-length victory over her stablemate Annotate in the Big Hearted Handicap, also a seven-furlong race. But Alford, having learnt a lesson from Calorific?s cantering win, decided against pushing Sparkling Clear for an unnecessary long verdict. It was, therefore, observed that Alford had much in reserve and could afford to allow Annotate to come that much closer. Their outings late in the season could be a prelude to an early campaign in the winter.

 Equally facile was Prime Contender?s victory in the day?s feature event, the 1,100m Unknown Warrior Cup. The horse was, however, ridden in a long check to ensure that she did not burst her blood vessels again. The Javed Khan-trainee had done so in her last outing when she started as a favourite. 

 Mark Reuben held the Young Senor-Prime Donna daughter in an iron grip virtually at the wrong-end of the field, and delayed his challenge until the final stretch. In the last 150m, the 9-4 second favourite bisected the front running group to lead and earn a deserving victory.

 Three-year-old Karan?s Choice, in the 1,000m Amar Jawan Handicap, was neglected in the betting despite her low weight while Ballet Master attracted a big support, notwithstanding his advancing age and a heavy impost of 60-kg. The youngster from trainer H.S. Bath?s yard, however, found the turf quite suitable on the occasion. She troubled the favourite right from the start leaving him to struggle with his heavy impost rounding the final turn.

 Trainer Daniel David, too, had his share of wins ? a rich double through a well-backed Stimulated and a friendless Magical Strike. Both horses were ridden in identical manner ? up with frontrunners till they shot into lead on the home turn.

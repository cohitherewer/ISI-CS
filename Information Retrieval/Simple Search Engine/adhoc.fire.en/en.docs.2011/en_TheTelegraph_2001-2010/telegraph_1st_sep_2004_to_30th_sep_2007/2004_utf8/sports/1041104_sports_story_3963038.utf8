 London: Tom Lehman, a former British Open champion, is expected to be named the US Ryder Cup captain for the next match against Europe in 2006.

 Lehman, who won the 1996 Open, played in three Ryder Cups during the 1990s and helped the US to their last victory at Brookline in 1999. They have lost the last two events. He faces challenges from Mark O?Meara, Larry Nelson, Fred Couples and Corey Pavin ahead of the 2006 Ryder Cup in Ireland.

 O?Meara is considered the strongest candidate of those four as he has Irish ancestry and is thought to be the one man who could galvanise the under-performing Tiger Woods in the Ryder Cup because of their close friendship. US media, however, tip Lehman to get the verdict.

 Rome: Denmark?s Mianne Bagger made history on Wednesday when she became the first transsexual to qualify for the Ladies European Tour (LET). The 37-year-old, who was born a male but underwent sex change surgery in 1995, carded a fourth-round 77 at Riva dei Tessali Golf Club in Taranto to join 35 other players with full exemption for next years tour. Bagger, who grew up in Australia, finished on four-over-par 292 ? even strokes behind LET qualifying school winner Miriam Nagl of Germany.

 She becomes the first high-profile transsexual to qualify for a professional sports tour since American tennis player Renee Richards, previously Richard Raskind, competed on the WTA tour during the 1970s. 

 Buenos Aires: Real Madrid forward Santiago Solari received a rare call-up from Argentina on Tuesday when he was included in the squad for this month?s World Cup qualifier against Venezuela. Solari last played for Argentina in the 1-0 friendly win over Morocco in April.

 Dublin: Fran Rooney, chief executive of the Football Association of Ireland (FAI), has resigned. The FAI said Rooney?s resignation would be effective from November 5. The terms of their agreement were confidential.

 Rooney?s position had been under threat over the past few weeks following criticism of his management style.

 ?I will always be committed to football in Ireland. I thank all those who worked with me in the past 18 months. I am also grateful to the people who expressed their support for me,? Rooney said in a statement.

 Milan: Inter Milan coach Roberto Mancini has been banned from the bench for two Serie A games and fined 2,500 euros for comments made to the referee after Saturdays match with Lazio. Mancini clashed with referee Matteo Trefoloni at the end of the game against his former club that ended in a 1-1 draw.

 The Italian football leagues disciplinary body said the fourth official reported that Mancini had shouted at the referee and accused him of bias as he followed him off the field.

Calcutta: Gautam Gambhir isn?t resting on laurels. Every match poses a new challenge for him, every day a new beginning. 

For the left-handed opener, who fell short of his maiden hundred in only his second Test by four runs, Kanpur ?is history?. He has brushed aside that disappointment and is focused on the more difficult tasks that lie ahead. 

?It?s a new innings and I am prepared to take fresh guard. I know I will have to start from nought.? 

The charm of getting a chance to bat at the Eden in front of tens of thousands has left him awestruck. ?I wonder how many people will be there on the opening day of this Test,? he wondered aloud. ?The sight must be majestic, the atmosphere electrifying.? 

Gambhir has played at this historic ground before, but that was during last December?s A-level meet. 

The fact that ticket sales have not been encouraging for this Test match hasn?t dampened Gambhir?s spirits. 

Gambhir is drawing inspiration from world champion cueist Geet Sethi?s Success vs Joy ? an inspirational book on mind control. ?It has chapters on how best to motivate oneself and how to maintain the mental balance.? 

What has been the biggest gain from Kanpur after a miserable debut in Mumbai? ?Confidence? This game is all about confidence. It also proved that I belong to this place,? Gambhir told The Telegraph. 

He hopes to continue with the same bat he used at the Green Park, though, it has a cracked handle. ?Don?t mistake it for some superstition. It?s my favourite,? he hastened to add. 

Opening with Delhi teammate Virender Sehwag has also helped ease the pressure. ?He blazes away at the other end and that takes the pressure off you.? 

Gambhir said Sehwag had reduced his ?burden? when it came to taking the strike in Kanpur. ?Normally, I prefer not to take first strike. When playing for Delhi, I don?t have to bother since Akash Chopra?s there. 

?The problem is, Veeru also doesn?t like taking the strike. In Mumbai, I did take first strike, but having felt uncomfortable, told him I wouldn?t prefer a repeat. He readily agreed.? 

This morning captain Sourav Ganguly was also effusive in praise. ?Sehwag has been successful the world over. Gambhir played in only his second Test in Kanpur. 

?He had a good match and showed a lot of promise. I hope they carry on in the same manner here.? 

Has there been any message from Sunil Gavaskar? ?Just relax? don?t worry about your place and play your natural game has been the advice,? Gambhir informed. 

That he did not let the failures in the Test against Australia affect his concentration and dedication also went a long way in his achieving success thereafter. The willingness to make the most of the next opportunity that came his way finally bore fruit. 

The Delhiite is very happy that his state team had managed to clinch the first-innings lead in the ongoing match versus Railways. ?We have a very good opportunity of winning the championship this time,? he felt. 

But that is looking too far ahead. His immediate duty is sure to keep him occupied for the next five days.

 Roddick for 

low-key man

 - US Davis Cup assistant coach in star?s sight 

 Roddick may hook up with Dean Goldfine 

London: World number two Andy Roddick is set to hook up with his US Davis Cup assistant coach after sacking Brad Gilbert at the weekend. 

Roddick, whom Gilbert steered to a maiden Grand Slam title and the world number one ranking in 2003, axed the flamboyant coach after just one-and-a-half seasons, giving no reason. 

?The decision to not rehire Brad Gilbert for the 2005 season is based on what I think is best for my game at this time,? Roddick said. ?Any more on this situation is a private matter between player and coach.? 

Sources at the United States Tennis Association said Dean Goldfine, the former coach of now-retired Todd Martin and who has a much lower public profile than Gilbert, will replace him. 

Goldfine and Roddick got to know each other while Goldfine was coaching the US Olympic and Davis Cup teams. 

While nothing had been confirmed, Goldfine said the pair has discussed him for becoming Roddick?s coach. ?We haven?t done anything. We had a really good conversation and we?re on the same page in terms of what I expect from a player in commitment and what he wants,? Goldfine told Florida?s Sun-Sentinel newspaper on Wednesday. 

?The reading I got from him is that I would have a lot of the qualities he?s looking for in a coach. I think Andy wants a long-term relationship and wants to make sure it?s the right fit... the best fit.? 

Gilbert was clearly surprised by Roddick?s decision to sever their ties. ?While I believe there is still a great deal of work to be done, Andy clearly does not feel that way,? he said. ?I have enjoyed all of my time with Andy. He has been a great student of the game during the time that we worked together and I am very proud of the results that were achieved.? 

However, those close to the player say he would be happier with a coach who remained in the background.

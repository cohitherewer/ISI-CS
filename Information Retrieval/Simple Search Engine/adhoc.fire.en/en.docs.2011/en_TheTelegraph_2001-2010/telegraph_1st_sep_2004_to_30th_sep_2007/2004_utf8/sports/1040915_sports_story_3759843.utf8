 Gajender was let off lightly 

 STAR RACER

 Stephens

 Way To The Stars was simply superb. The victory of the rank-outsider, last Wednesday, came when punters had written him off as a most unreliable horse in the Hastings stable. The John Stephens-trained seven-year-old, it seems, has begun a new innings. His acceleration from about the rear of the field, in the 1,200m Moon Fairy Cup, was not only amazing, it also bore fruits when he had a comfortable measure of Callisto who was being hailed as a winner. The victory of the horse also complimented his underrated jockey Mark Reuben who timed his challenge to perfection.

 The race also witnessed the fall of fancied runners ? Arikara and Sea Legend. If the former was victim of holding tactics, the latter clearly indicated that she needed the run. Although the Vijay Singh-trainee had many failures against her name during the winter season, her long rest and light impost was expected to work to her advantage.

 It was not the brightest of the afternoon to start with. With apprentice Gajender Singh going easy on the odds-on Errol Bhungard-favourite Ballet Master in the opener, the Own Ability Handicap, the field was left open for a friendless Star Above to take advantage. The Daniel David-trainee?s recent record had been pathetic but the stipes gave the five-year-old the benefit of doubt as the event was marked for ?non-winners? and the mare was running after three week?s of rest. However, stewards? found Gajender guilty of not making a determined effort on the favourite after losing some ground at the start and handed him a four-day suspension. The apprentice must consider himself lucky as jockey R. Yadav was stood down for about an year on similar grounds last winter when atop Moon Mission.

 Gajender was, however, a disciplined man on Bhungard?s another favourite, El Cid, in the following event, the 1,400m Anticipator Cup. The apprentice had the eight-year-old settled behind a runaway Modesto till approaching the final turn before releasing brakes on the aged galloper. The respond from the favourite was instant and he sailed past the leader to record a facile six-length-plus victory.

 Arian possessed class, but the long lay off and the current form of the Sanjeev Charan-ward were factors working against him in the 1,100m Contralto Handicap. However, the top-weighted horse shrugged aside such disadvantage to score a fluent victory in the hands of Reuben. It was Bhungard?s April Ace who threatened to win from the start in the hands of B. Gurang. But Reuben kept the 3-1 chance in close proximity of the leader till the final turn before shooting into a winning lead.

 Legendary Lover was in the winners? enclosure again after his recent narrow victory over a strongly fancied Alessio. Ridden by Gajender he upstaged another favourite in Annotate to the discomfiture of Shanker who had failed Alessio last time.

 Shanker?s riding tactics also came under flak from punters. With 60-kg impost on his shoulders, his backer expected the jockey to hold the even-money favourite back instead of chasing Kargil Soldier from the start. A comparative lightweight Legendary Lover (53 kg), on the other hand, settled behind the frontrunners until 300m from home. He got the measure of a tiring Annotate inside the last furlong.

 Changed riding tactics also worked to the advantage of Thoughtful, in the Bachelor?s Wedding Handicap. The Bhungard-trainee was found to be out of steam in her last encounter as a favourite when ridden from the front. He was held back in fourth this time as Advancer led a merry dance over Alessio and Great Ambition. She led 300m from home when leaders tired.

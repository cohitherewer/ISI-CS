 Berlioz may cash in on Derby form 

 WILLIAM TELL

 Bangalore: The S. Padmanabhan-trained Berlioz, partnered by Mallesh Narredu, is fancied to lift the 1,600m Shantiniketan Cup here on Sunday. The Sri Pekan-Innocent Pleasures son was a good second to Full Speed recently in the Mysore Derby. He may, however, face a strong challenge from Polar Force, Jumping For Joy and Golden Fortune who are showing out well during their morning workouts.

 Goa, Dempo bid farewell to Cristiano Junior

 - Brazilian?s CT Scan report to be forwarded to Fifa 

Panaji: Goan football fans and Dempo players bid farewell to Cristiano de Lima Junior on Monday. His body would be flown off to his hometown Brasilia via Mumbai. 

The entire Dempo squad gathered around the coffin for one last time even as a police band played on. Coach Armando Colaco and Dempo chairman Srinivas Dempo were present on the occasion. 

Team members, clad in their team colours, wrapped the Dempo flag around his coffin and carried it to the hearse van. 

?Let Junior be your inspiration to play hard. He lived and died for the game, let him be the reason for you all to play to win,? a Dempo official exhorted the team as they lifted the coffin. 

A CT scan was done on Junior?s body at a city hospital on Sunday after Dempo Sports Club received instructions from Fifa that such a test was necessary in case of a player?s death. 

?We had done the CT scan yesterday at a private hospital after we received instructions to this effect from Fifa. We are awaiting the report and when it comes, shall forward it to them,? Srinivas said. 

When asked if he thought a second post-mortem would have been helpful, the chairman said: ?It?s difficult to say but it was Juliana?s (Junior?s wife) wish that a second post-mortem be carried out. But when the Goa government rejected her wish, she backed out. She wanted to take Junior home as soon as possible.? 

Junior passed away during the Federation Cup final match against Mohun Bagan on December 5. 

He scored both goals to help his team win the tournament, but collapsed and died seconds after scoring his teams?s second goal. 

According to the final post-mortem report, Junior died of cardiac arrest due to over-exertion and excitement.

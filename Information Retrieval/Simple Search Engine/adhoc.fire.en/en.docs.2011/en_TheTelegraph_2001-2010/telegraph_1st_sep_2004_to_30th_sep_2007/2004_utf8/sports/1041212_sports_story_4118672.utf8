 Surya in sole lead

 Surya Shekhar Ganguly

 Visakhapatnam: Defending 

 champion Grandmaster Surya Shekhar Ganguly of PSPB jumped 

 to sole lead after a finely crafted victory over rookie 

 Abhijit Gupta in the 10th round of the National A chess 

 on Saturday. 

Ganguly took his tally to 7.5 points out of a possible 10 and is now trailed by GM Sandipan Chanda with seven points. 

With just nine rounds to co-me in this prestigious event GM Abhijit Kunte, the former Brit-ish champion, and IM Neel-otpal Das, the qualifier to the la-st world championship, share the third slot with 6.5 points apiece. 

After a missed chance in the previous round, Ganguly was a man with a mission against Abhijit Gupta who simply did not stand any chance against his favoured rival. The Calcuttan had to do little in this contest after his younger opponent went wrong in the middle game. 

Chanda was held to a draw Tejas Bakre without much ado. It remains to be seen now whether Chanda will be able to catch up with Ganguly in roun-ds to come even as he has played a slightly better opposition than his counterpart. 

Meanwhile, Abhijit Kunte continued his great form and scored his third victory on the trot. On the receiving end was former champion P. Konguvel who was outdone in a Colle system game. It took Kunte 53 mov-es to register a smooth victory. Das was held to a draw by West Bengal?s Suvrajit Saha, who has been quite impressive in the event while Andhra GM Koneru Humpy announced her arrival in the race for the top slot in style with a hard fought victory over IM S. Kidambi of PSPB in other important games of the day. (PTI)

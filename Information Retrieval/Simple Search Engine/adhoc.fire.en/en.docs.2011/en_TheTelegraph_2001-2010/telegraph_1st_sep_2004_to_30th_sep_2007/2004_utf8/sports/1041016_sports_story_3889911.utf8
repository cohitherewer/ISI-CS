The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Sekar blames injuries on faulty techniques

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Sekar feels Zaheeer will take more time to regain peak form while Balaji should resume on a short run-up 

Chennai: The recent spate of injuries to the Indian fast bowlers is more a result of faulty technique than problems related to their fitness. According to former India pacer T.A. Sekar, unless the basic flaws in a bowler?s action is corrected, it will be difficult to stop the injury worries. 

?It starts from the technique. Someone may have played for India and achieved great success, but it doesn?t necessarily mean he has the right technique. A Ranji Trophy player with limited success can be better placed in this aspect,? Sekar told The Telegraph. 

The chief coach at the MRF Pace Academy feels Zaheer Khan will take some more time before regaining peak form. ?Zaheer is coming back and has just recovered from the hamstring injury. Once you give a break, it?s very difficult to strike the rhythm. It will take at least another couple of matches for him to bowl with the same pace. 

?You cannot rush your return? It?s a matter of time and you?ve got to be patient,? Sekar, under whose guidance Zaheer went through the rehabilitation phase at the academy, said. 

Sekar doesn?t agree with Bruce Reid that Zaheer doesn?t work hard. ?I?ve always found him serious in his business. He has bowled long spells at the academy and in the matches he participated. You?ve got to look at the positive side and focus on how to make him work hard.? 

As for Lakshmipathy Balaji, suffering from a groin injury, Sekar isn?t in the know of things. ?I believe he has been advised rest. Only once it heals will he start his sessions with the physio. I don?t know the exact nature of his problem and so it wouldn?t be fair for me to comment on the time-frame for his return. He needs to strengthen the muscles in that area before resuming bowling from a short run-up.? 

Sekar feels the academy has one of the best infrastructures in the world for the rehab programme. ?We have the latest updates on rehab. We are constantly updated by foreign physios and trainers which helps us to identify the problem faster. The fitness regime we follow is different from what the others have in place. Moreover, trainer Ramji Srinivasan, is the only Indian who is qualified from Australia to handle such cases.? 

Dennis Lillee?s association with the academy had also prompted Brett Lee to train at the academy in a build-up to this series. ?Lee wanted to know the right length and the subtleties of reverse swing in Indian conditions.? 

Sekar informed that Lee had also used the facilities here to correct a flaw in his technique. ?Before the third Test in Australia this time, he got in touch with Lillee to know what was going wrong. Lillee was travelling and so sought our advice. After analysing we told him that he was getting ?locked? in his action and so unable to generate pace. It helped? 

?It?s natural that during bad patch a player drifts away from his basic technique and fitness. Though Australians have access to the best facilities, they still go wrong.?

 Moya gives Spain title

 - Roddick tamed in straight Sets 

 Carlos Moya is the man of the hour after beating Andy Roddick to give Spain an unbeatable 3-1 lead in Seville on Sunday. Moya won 6-2, 7-6 (7-1), 7-6 (7-5) 

Seville: A majestic Carlos Moya humbled Andy Roddick 6-2, 7-6 (7-1), 7-6 (7-5) on Sunday to clinch the Davis Cup for Spain. The popular Mallorcan erased the heartache of missing Spain?s maiden triumph in 2000 by bringing the American to his knees in front of more than 27,000 frenzied fans. 

Moya?s victory gave Spain an unassailable 3-1 lead over the United States, Moya having beaten Mardy Fish and Roddick having fallen to Rafael Nadal on the opening day before Bob and Mike Bryan won Saturday?s doubles. 

The former French Open champion got off to a great start, streaking into a 4-0 lead before Roddick registered on the scoreboard. 

Moya wrapped up the opening set in just 36 minutes. The second was closer, the players exchanging breaks of serve early on before matching each other blow for blow into the tie-breaker. At 6-6, Moya pulled away, unfurling one groundstroke after another past the lunging Roddick and wrapping it up 7-1. (Reuters)

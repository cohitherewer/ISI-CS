The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Glitz, glamour and cricket

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: It was usual glitz and glamour at the Eden on Saturday. 

If you were a somebody, you jolly well be present every time cricket returns to the city. If you are a nobody, you at least try. 

There were film stars ? Mithun Chakraborty and Arbaaz Khan (in his own right, the brother of Salman Khan) ? and the film asterixes, and more, surrounded by those people, called sports-lovers at the Eden, sycophants elsewhere. 

Yet, amid the 80,000-odd, who were humming and shouting and eating their hearts out, there was this big gap in the Rs 15,000 stand. Seemed priced out of the city?s grasp. 

No bottles of water to be taken inside, no tiffin carriers, mobile phones jammed, absolutely no access to the cricketers, even for the aam junta media, squashing security all around. 

In between, Nari Contractor bumped into Intikhab Alam, who was talking to this correspondent, and the former India captain said: ?Here is the man who got me out on 92 in New Delhi in 1961-62. 

?That was a brilliant delivery. I was so shocked, eight short of my hundred and he send down that unplayable one? My respect for Intikhab grew manifold thereafter.? 

?Nari was a great batsman too,? retorted Alam.

 Young gets life ban

 Jerome Young 

Denver: United States sprinter Jerome Young, a central figure in a doping case that could cost the US relay team its gold medal from Sydney, was banned for life by the US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) following his second positive doping test. 

Young, the world 400 m champion in 2003, tested positive for epo at a Paris meet in July, USADA said Wednesday. He is believed to be the first sprinter to test positive for epo, which is popular with endurance runners and cyclists. 

Tests for epo were introduced at the 2000 Sydney Games. American sprinter Kelli White admitted she used epo and other performance-enhancing drugs earlier this year when she accepted a two-year ban for doping. 

Young tested positive for the steroid nandrolone in 1999, but was exonerated by a US appeals panel in July 2000, avoiding a two-year ban. 

He ran in the opening and semi-final rounds of the Sydney Olympics, but not in the 4x400 m final anchored by Michael Johnson. 

All six members of the relay squad received gold medals, but Young?s was stripped. 

Other members of the team include 30-year-old Alvin Harrison, who accepted a four-year suspension in October for doping violations uncovered in the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative (BALCO) case. Harrison?s twin and Sydney teammate, Calvin Harrison, is serving a two-year suspension for testing positive for drugs linked to the BALCO case. 

The Harrison cases and the latest involving Young all came after the Sydney Games. But the IAAF has recommended declaring the entire Sydney relay team ineligible. 

Last month, the US Olympic Committee challenged the recommendation in a petition lodged with the CAS in Lausanne. Young was not covered by the appeal. (AP)

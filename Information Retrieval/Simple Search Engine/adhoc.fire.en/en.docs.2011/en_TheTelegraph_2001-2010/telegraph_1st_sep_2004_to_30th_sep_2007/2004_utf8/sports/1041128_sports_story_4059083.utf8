The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Low turnout expected at the Eden

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Authorities of Cricket Association of Bengal failed to reveal a clear picture on the turnout on Day I of the Eden Test as there is a provision of daily sale of tickets. 

?Though we are not sure, but as of now it can be said that ticket sales are pretty bad and we are expecting around 40,000 on the first day,? said an organising committee member. 

But he expects sales to pick up on the second or third day if the Test turns out to be an engaging one.

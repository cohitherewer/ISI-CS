 Dew a major factor, says Inzamam

 Maravan Atapattu addresses the media in Lahore on Friday 

Lahore: Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq says whoever wins the toss and bats first will have the advantage in Saturday?s tri-series final against Sri Lanka, after dew caused fielding problems in Thursday?s league match. 

?Dew factor will count a lot and whoever wins the toss will have a big edge,? said Inzamam. ?There was lot of dew in the last two hours of the match on Thursday and it was difficult for the bowlers,? he said. 

Inzamam and Sri Lanka captain Marvan Atapattu discussed the possibility of bringing forward the start of the final so that both teams could avoid the dew factor and have an equal chance. 

?Inzamam had a word to me and I am in favour of that too,? said Atapattu. ?I think that will give both teams a chance to play better cricket and have a 50-50 chance of performing well. 

?Fielding in the second session is not easy and for the bowler holding the ball is not easy as well,? he added.

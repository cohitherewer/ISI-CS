The Telegraph - Calcutta

 I?m surprised: Prasanna

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Calcutta: Erapalli Prasanna, among the all-time great off-spinners, is ?surprised? that the legitimacy of Harbhajan Singh?s doosra is being questioned after his action was ?rectified? in late 1998. 

?My only direct comment on the latest controversy is that I?m surprised over Harbhajan again coming under the scanner,? Prasanna told The Telegraph on Tuesday evening. 

He added: ?After all, if his action was rectified (by Fred Titmus), then, how come the questioning-bit has surfaced one more time?? 

Prasanna, whose tally of 189 Test victims has just been equalled by Harbhajan, felt working with a biomechanist (as prescribed by the International Cricket Council) isn?t quite the solution. 

?My understanding is that the biomechanist could ask Harbhajan to simply stop bowling the doosra? Is that what we need? Surely, cricket must have variety?? he remarked. 

Asked whether he was willing to help, Prasanna replied: ?Definitely? Don?t forget that I worked with Rajesh Chauhan in early 1997 and he appreciated whatever little I did.? 

The ball, clearly, is in Harbhajan?s court.

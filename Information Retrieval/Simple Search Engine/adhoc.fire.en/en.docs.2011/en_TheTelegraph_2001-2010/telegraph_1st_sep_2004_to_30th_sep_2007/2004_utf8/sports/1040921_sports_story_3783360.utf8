Madrid: Atletico Madrid held Barcelona to a 1-1 draw on Sunday as the last two remaining 100 percent records fell in Spain. Giovanni van Bronckhorst put Barcelona ahead in the 23rd minute but Fernando Torres grabbed the equaliser early in the second half and Atletico held on to claim a valiant draw. 

The result left Atletico and Barcelona among the six sides level at the top with seven points from three games. Espanyol, 1-0 winners over Real Madrid on Saturday, emerged as leaders on goals scored, followed by Atletico and Barcelona. 

Osasuna, who beat Real Betis 3-2, Real Zaragoza, 4-3 winners against Albacete on Sunday, and Valencia, who beat Real Sociedad 3-1, are the others in the leading group. 

Deportivo Coruna claimed their first victory of the season on Sunday when Albert Luque stabbed in at the near post in the second minute of injury time to clinch a 2-1 win at Athletic Bilbao. 

Barcelona started at breakneck speed against Atletico and should have had the game wrapped up in the first half. 

?We controlled the game but Atletico made things difficult for us,? said Barcelona coach Frank Rijkaard. ?The result?s fine, though. This is a difficult place to come and it?s OK to draw here.? 

Van Bronckhorst lashed the ball into the net early on only for the referee to harshly blow for handball. 

However, the Dutch defender soon put the Catalans ahead after Ronaldinho?s run along the byeline was stopped by a desperate challenge. The ball ran free and Van Bronckhorst reacted first to beat Leo Franco with a sweet shot. 

Atletico abandoned their cautious approach and began to trouble the Barca defence with the strong running of Torres and the vision of Ariel Ibagaza. The equaliser arrived five minutes after the break when Torres raced on to a long ball forward, wrong-footed Carles Puyol with a neat header and beat Victor Valdes with a shot that went in off the bar. 

Barcelona almost got an immediate equaliser, Ronaldinho heading over from a couple of metres after Henrik Larsson had teed him up with a header and the Brazilian went close again 10 minutes later following a one-two with the Swede. 

Meanwhile in England, Chelsea were held to a 0-0 home draw by Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday and remain two points behind champions Arsenal in second place after the weekend?s Premier League action. 

A thrilling match at Stamford Bridge ended with both sides retaining their unbeaten starts to the season but with Spurs unable to end a 14-year, 29-match wait for a league victory over Chelsea. 

Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho, upset with what he saw as ultra-defensive tactics by Spurs, said: ?As they say in my country, they brought the bus and they left the bus in front of the goal because everybody was there. ?They didn?t play football, they just defend, defend, defend,? the Portuguese coach told Sky Sports TV. 

Tottenham climbed to fifth place on 10 points, six behind Arsenal and two short of Chelsea, who have been held goalless in their last two league games. Everton beat Middlesbrough 1-0 at home on Sunday to climb to third on 13. 

Bolton Wanderers, who held Arsenal 2-2 at Highbury on Saturday, are fourth on 11 points and Middlesbrough sixth on 10. Arsenal dropped their first points but extended their record unbeaten league run to 46 matches. 

Newcastle United marked their first Premier League match under Graeme Souness with a 2-1 win at Southampton, their first away league victory in 17 attempts going back 11 months, and climbed to eighth on eight points.

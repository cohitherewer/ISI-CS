 Ralf gets back into gear

 Ralf Schumacher 

London: Germany?s Ralf Schumacher reported no pain on Tuesday as he stepped back into a Formula One car for the first time since his accident in June. 

?I have no back pain, everything?s gone well,? said the 29-year-old Williams driver after his first few laps at the Silverstone circuit. 

?I want to be back for the race in Shanghai.? 

Schumacher, younger brother of Ferrari?s seven-times world champion Michael, missed the last six races after suffering two spinal fractures when he spun into a concrete wall at the US Grand Prix in Indianapolis on June 20. 

The next race is the inaugural Chinese Grand Prix in Shanghai on September 26. 

Williams? technical director Sam Michael said at last weekend?s Italian Grand Prix that the team missed Ralf and was looking forward to having him back as they battle McLaren for fourth place in the championship. (Reuters)

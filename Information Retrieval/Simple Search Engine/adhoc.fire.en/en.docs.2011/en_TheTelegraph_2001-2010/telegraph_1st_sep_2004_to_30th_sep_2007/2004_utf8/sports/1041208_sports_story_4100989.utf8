The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Fifa awaiting final post-mortem report

 - Junior?s Tragic Death

- AFC to conduct inquiry 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Cristiano Junior 

Calcutta: Soccer?s world body, Fifa, is awaiting the ?final post-mortem? report before making a comment/acting on Cristiano Junior?s tragic death in Bangalore on Sunday evening. 

?Our chief medical officer (Prof. Jiri Dvorak) has just received preliminary details? The final report, we understand, may take another day or two... We will take it up from there but, till then, we can?t comment,? informed a Fifa spokesman, when contacted by The Telegraph in Zurich. 

Speaking on Tuesday evening, he added that the Asian Football Confederation, in any case, is going to ?conduct? an inquiry. 

Incidentally, Fifa president Joseph Blatter has, in a communication to the All India Football Federation (AIFF), condoled Junior?s death during the Federation Cup final. 

Meanwhile, the AIFF move to suspend Subrata Pal is being seen as an attempt to deflect some of the criticism, but a good many questions remain unanswered. 

The questions could grow by the hour. 

Even as the AIFF waits for a ?full report? on the Pal-Junior incident, as secretary Alberto Colaco pointed out some 48 hours after the Brazilian?s death, there?s growing anger over the Mohun Bagan goalie?s role in what is being dismissed as an accident. 

Shockingly, Pal wasn?t even shown the red card by referee Maheshwaran Balu. 

The AIFF, one learns, moved on the Pal front after a report from disciplinary committee chairman Hardev Jadeja and match commissioner M.G. Suvarna. 

The next step will see all five members of the disciplinary committee sitting in judgement on the suspension. Pal, by the way, must give his ?explanation? by December 20. 

The disciplinary committee, therefore, can only meet after the ?explanation? has been forwarded. 

Amazingly, despite eyebrows being raised by the hundreds, Colaco didn?t have a comment on the obvious lack of medical facilities at the ground (Kanteerava Stadium) and the ill-equipped ambulance stationed for an emergency. 

?We?ve asked for all details? On the number of personnel present and the facilities? Till such time that the specifics aren?t forthcoming, I?m not in a position to comment,? Colaco maintained. 

The AIFF secretary, however, said the national body was open to an ?inquiry? by Fifa.

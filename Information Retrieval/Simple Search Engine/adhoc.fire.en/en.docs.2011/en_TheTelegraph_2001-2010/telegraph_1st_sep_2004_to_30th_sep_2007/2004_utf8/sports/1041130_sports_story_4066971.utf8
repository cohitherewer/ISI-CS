 London: Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho says his Champions League triumph with Porto last season was overshadowed by a death threat on the eve of the final and ?weeks of terror? afterwards.

 Mourinho also said in a biography, extracts of which were published by The Times on Monday, that he had resorted to hiring security to protect himself and his family in the aftermath of the May final in Gelsenkirchen. The Portuguese manager described how he returned a call he had received on his mobile phone the day before the game. ?On the other end of the line, there quickly came a death threat linked to my arrival back in Porto,? Mourinho said.

 ??You think you?re the best... you b*****d... we won?t do anything now because you have a final to play tomorrow, but as soon as it?s over, consider yourself a dead man, because we?ll get you, and as soon as you get back to Porto your fate is sealed. You don?t have a chance...??

 Monday?s extract came a day after it was revealed that Mourinho?s lawyer has asked judicial officials to provide him with extra security on his return to Porto for Chelsea?s Champions League game against his old club on December 7.

 Zagreb: Former Croatia coach Otto Baric stepped down as sports director of Dinamo Zagreb on Monday just weeks after taking the post.

 The 71-year-old Baric said he was now in the running to be appointed national coach of Egypt but had several other options.

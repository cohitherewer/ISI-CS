The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Indians win, but fume over opposition

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

Birmingham: The Team India manager, Goutam 

Das Gupta, has taken exception to the quality of the opposition in Thursday?s 

practice game in Dorridge, some 65 minutes? drive from here. 

Stand-in captain Rahul Dravid top-scored with 68 (retired), 

while Virender Sehwag and Rohan Gavaskar got 59 and 51, respectively, as the Indians 

reached 311 for seven in 50 overs. The toss was won by Dravid. 

[ Anil Kumble had to sit out as a knock he took on his left knee at nets on Wednesday became very painful.] 

?We were told that our match is against an ECB XI. Instead, we have had to play club-level cricketers? A practice game in the middle of a tournament (Champions Trophy) has to be a serious affair,? fumed Das Gupta. 

It?s not clear, though, why the Midlands Club Cricket Conference (MCCC) XI replaced an ECB selection. In fact, the biggest ?home? stars were the umpires ? Tim Robinson and Richard Illingworth. 

Incidentally, coach John Wright had this to tell The 

Telegraph: ?Actually, this is one of the best attacks we?ve faced in recent 

years!? 

Obviously, Wright was at his sarcastic best. 

Talking of the match, the Indians won by 77 runs, but not before a spirited riposte from the MCCC XI. Sollie Ndima was the No.1 scorer with 54, while Ismail Jamiel got 53. Amit Bhandari picked up three wickets for 25. 

By the way, former India opener Vikram Rathore, who 

has settled in Leeds, came across to the Dorridge Cricket Club and spent the day 

with the Sourav Gangulys. The regular captain, however, left for the team hotel 

(in Birmingham) soon after lunch.

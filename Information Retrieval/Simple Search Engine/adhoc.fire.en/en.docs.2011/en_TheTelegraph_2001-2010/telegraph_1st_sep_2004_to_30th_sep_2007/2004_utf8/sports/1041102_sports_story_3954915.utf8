Calcutta: On a day of upsets, national ranking East Zone table tennis meet witnessed the unceremonious exit of the top two seeds in men?s singles ? S. Raman and Soumyadeep Roy at SAI Eastern Centre on Monday. 

While Subhajit Saha (senior) clinically polished off top seed Raman 11-6, 13-11, 6-11, 11-7 and 11-4 in the men?s quarter finals, Soumyadeep Roy failed to overcome lack of concentration, going down 7-11, 11-5, 5-11, 11-8, 4-11, 11-3, 9-11 in a see-saw pre-quarter final battle against Jayanta Chandra. 

Jayanta?s joy, however, turned out to be short-lived as veteran Arup Basak brought the 20-year-old down to earth with a 7-11, 11-6, 12-10, 9-11, 11-7 and 11-8 victory en route to a semi-final berth. 

Sourav Chakraborty ? who got rid of Subham Chowdhury 6-11, 11-7, 6-11, 11-6, 11-4 and 11-2 ? and Ranabir Das ? a 9-11, 5-11, 11-1, 11-7, 11-9 and 12-10 winner over Amit Das ? completed the line-up in the last-four stage. 

It was, however, business as usual on the distaff. Poulami Ghatak will take on Mantu Ghosh while Nandita Saha faces Mouma Das in the women?s semi-finals. 

If reigning champion Poulami had to really lift her game in getting past B. Bhubaneswari 6-11, 5-11, 11-5, 11-6, 17-15, 14-12 in the pre-quarters, she was cool and composed in the next round while disposing off Anindita Chakraborty in straight games 11-7, 13-11, 11-7, 11-6. 

So was Nandita. Her quarter-final opponent Avanti Sinha, following a 4-11, 4-11, 9-11, 4-11 defeat to Nandita, had to admit that she was facing a ?storm? from the opposite end of the board. 

Both Mantu and Mouma fought off a first-game deficit to rout their respective opponents. Mantu got the better of Madhumita Patkar 11-13, 11-9, 11-3, 7-11, 11-2, 11-8, while Mouma had the last laugh against T. Pradeepa in a 10-12, 11-8, 11-9, 11-6, 11-5 encounter. 

Trailing by one game to two, and as Soumyadeep was facing Jayanta?s serve, the loudspeaker inside the hall blared ? there was some announcement to make on the organisers? part. A disgruntled Soumyadeep asked for a break and shouted to himself, ?why this had to happen now.? 

He returned to his position after a while, but there was a definite lack of concentration. He struggled and his rival seized the opportunity. Moreover, Jayanta deliberately started playing upon his fancied opponent?s woes ? delaying his serve and moving all over the court. ?Certainly this is the biggest win of my career,? said an elated Jayanta. Soumyadeep left in a huff. 

However, a couple of hours later, Jayanta joy evaporated against Arup. 

Earlier the boys? top seed Ankit Koparkar joined the third and fourth seeds Devesh Karia and Amarnath Das, in taking exit route in the pre-quarters.

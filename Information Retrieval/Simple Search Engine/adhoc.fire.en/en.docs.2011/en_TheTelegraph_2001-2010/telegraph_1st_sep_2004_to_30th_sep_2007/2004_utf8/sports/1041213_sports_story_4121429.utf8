 Gentleman?s agreement the need: Bowden

Perth: Umpire Billy Bowden has called on Australia and Pakistan cricketers to avoid controversy in the upcoming series by reaching a gentleman?s agreement on disputed catches. 

Bowden, who will officiate with South Africa?s Rudi Koertzen in the first Test starting in Perth this week, said he wanted rival captains Ricky Ponting and Inzamam-ul Haq to agree to take the fielder?s word on doubtful catches. 

?I believe in honesty whether it?s on the field or off it,? Bowden said on Sunday. 

?I just think for the good of the game, for the spirit of the game, it?s unfair to have someone knowing that he has not caught the ball and (the batsman) has been given out, or (the fielder) has caught the ball and (the batsman has) not been given out. I?d like to see some loyalty and integrity put back into the game.? 

The 41-year-old New Zealander, known for his theatrical on-field signalling, said he orchestrated a similar pact between Australia and Sri Lanka in March and the series was played in good spirit. 

Australia and New Zealand could not reach a similar agreement this summer and in the first Test in Brisbane, Craig McMillan stood his ground despite nicking a delivery to wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist, sparking heated exchanges.Although he said he would like an agreement between Australia and Pakistan, Bowden said he would leave it up to the teams

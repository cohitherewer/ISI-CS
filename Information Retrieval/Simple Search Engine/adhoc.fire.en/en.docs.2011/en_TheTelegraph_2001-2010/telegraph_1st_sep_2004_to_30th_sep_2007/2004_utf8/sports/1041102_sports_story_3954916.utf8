 Kenteris denies faking crash

 - GREEK DOPING SCANDAL

Athens: Greece?s disgraced Olympic sprint champion Costas Kenteris on Sunday broke a lengthy silence since the end of the Athens Games to deny faking a motorcycle crash to avoid a doping test. 

Ahead of a week when prosecutors are likely to decide whether to file charges against the Sydney Olympics 200m champion and fellow-sprinter Katerina Thanou, who won the 100m silver medal at the 2000 Games, Kenteris angrily hit out at the actions that forced him out of the Athens Games. 

The fall from grace of Kenteris, a national hero because of his win at Sydney, was the biggest doping scandal since Ben Johnson tested positive for drugs in the 1988 Olympics and cast a cloud over the August 13 to 29 event. 

The two sprinters are under investigation for allegedly staging the crash, obstructing a doping test and providing authorities with false information. 

Their coach Christos Tzekos, from whose home they set off on the motorcycle, is also under investigation for possession of illegal drugs. 

In an interview with Greece?s Alter Television station, Kenteris said he was never informed in time that International Olympic Committee (IOC) officials wanted to test him. 

?It was irresponsible to get on the bike but I went crazy when I found out that I had supposedly missed a doping test and I wanted to rush to the Olympic Village?, Kenteris said. 

?I had never been notified and suddenly people were saying I could be thrown out of the Games. The accident did occur.? 

Doctors at the hospital where the pair were taken are also under investigation as well as several people who said they witnessed the accident, which the two said happened when they skidded on a greasy road on the eve of the start of the Games. 

A medical examiner who checked the athletes found Kenteris had significantly less injuries than stated in the hospital report while Thanou had no single visible injury. 

Reconstructing the cat-and-mouse saga, Kenteris said he had found out that while the notice for him to appear for a doping test was signed by the Greek Olympic team chief, he should have been given a 24-hour deadline and not one hour, which is the standard only for notices received in person by the athletes. 

?Why was I given only 60 minutes to appear when the doping code clearly states that I should be given 24 hours,? he said. 

Kenteris added he asked to be tested for banned substances in hospital after the crash. 

?I told the hospital, which was an Olympics-accredited hospital, to call the IOC and have me tested on the spot but no one came.? 

The two sprinters remained in hospital for several days and then voluntarily withdrew from the Games. 

Kenteris also said for the first time that he had been scheduled to light the Olympic Cauldron to start the Games, an honour that instead went to Greece?s top windsurfer. 

?I had even rehearsed lighting the cauldron,? he said. 

Kenteris held back from blaming his coach but said Tzekos could have been better informed about doping procedures. 

Police raids connected to the case found thousands of boxes containing anabolic steroids and stimulants at a warehouse of the coach?s nutritional supplements company. 

If prosecutors decide to press charges and the two sprinters are found guilty, they would face light sentences because the issues are regarded as misdemeanours punishable by only several months in jail. 

A judge could also pass suspended sentences or order the pair to pay fines to avoid going to jail.

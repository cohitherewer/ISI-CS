Vienna: England captain David Beckham was forced to leave training early on Monday after failing to shake off a rib injury just two days before he is due to face Poland in a World Cup qualifier. 

A Football Association spokesman said neither Beckham or Steven Gerrard had completed the session next to the Ernst Happel Stadion where England drew 2-2 with Austria on Saturday. 

Steven was precautionary, theres no injury. David took a bang on the ribs during the game against Austria on Saturday and it felt sore today, the spokesman s aid. 

He will be assessed by the medical staff. 

Gerrard played and scored in Vienna after passing a fitness test on a groin injury sustained in training last week. 

England face Poland in Chorzow on Wednesday in their second group VI qualifier, with media pressure building on manager Sven-Goran Eriksson after his team squandered a 2-0 lead on Saturday. 

Beckham would have a guaranteed starting place if fit. Should he fail to recover, his place on the right flank would probably go to youngster Shaun Wright-Phillips, who scored on his debut last month in a 3-0 friendly win over Ukraine.

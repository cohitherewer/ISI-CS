The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Another sweep is the target

 - Harbhajan issue no bother for India 

 All eyes will be on Dhoni 

Chittagong: India will seek to maintain the domination they established in the Test series when the first of three one-day Internationals against Bangladesh is held here on Thursday. The Harbhajan Singh episode doesn?t seem to be bothering the visitors who are looking to sweep the ODI series just as they had done the Tests. 

?It (Harbhajan?s action being reported to the ICC) is a routine affair? It has become part and parcel of the game,? coach John Wright reiterated on the off-spinner?s issue. ?Harbhajan and the whole team is pretty relaxed. We want to try and match the performance of the Test series. We are looking for a 3-0 result.? 

Sourav Ganguly echoed similar sentiments on the matter. ?There is nothing special about it. Several bowlers have been reported in the past, it is not a major threat. The board has taken up the matter,? said the Team India skipper. 

Bangladesh, on the other hand, will be drawing hope from their spirited first-innings performance of the second Test which saw young Mohammed Ashraful hit a dazzling 158 not out. 

The 20-year-old right-hander became Bangladesh?s top-scorer in a Test innings. 

After missing out on the follow-on target by seven runs, though, Bangladesh collapsed like a pack of cards in the second innings ? losing all their wickets in a span of 27 overs. 

Bangladesh?s weakness has been their batting against the new ball. Dav Whatmore admitted that but sounded optimistic as well. 

?We expect ourselves to put up a better fight (in the ODIs),? the coach said. ?We need to show the resistance like we did in the first innings (of the Chittagong Test).? 

From India?s point of view, the spotlight will be on wicketkeeper-batsman Mahendra Singh Dhoni who is set to make his India debut after Sourav confirmed that Rahul Dravid ?won?t be keeping.? 

Dhoni, who will be first Jharkhand cricketer to don national colours, has earned rave reviews for his batting exploits. ?From all reports we have received, he is suited to the one-day game, and the selectors thought it was time to give him a chance. It is tough on Dinesh (Karthik) but that is what the selectors had to decide, and it is not a bad thing,? coach John Wright said. 

Yuvraj Singh returns to Team India after being ignored from the Test squad, while statemate and Punjab captain Dinesh Mongia is back in the national squad after a gap of nearly 18 months.

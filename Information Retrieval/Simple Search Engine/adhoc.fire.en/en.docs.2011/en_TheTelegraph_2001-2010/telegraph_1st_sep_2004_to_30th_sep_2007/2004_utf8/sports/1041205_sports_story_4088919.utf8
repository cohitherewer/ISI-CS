The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Excellent deal for Rupesh

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Rupesh Roy, son of a Bihar farmer who graduated from a ball boy to a tennis player rather swiftly after moving over to Calcutta with his uncles, will soon be going places thanks to an excellent deal the state association has struck with an American institution. 

The 15-year-old Rupesh, already a key member of the junior Davis Cup team, will be shifting base to Boston?s Bosse Foundation in the first week of January. 

Announcing the news on Saturday, BTA secretary Hironmoy Chatterjee said the contract is to the tune of $100,000 per year for a period of three years. The Foundation will chalk out his yearly playing schedule and take care of his travelling, boarding, lodging, training and schooling. 

 Currently playing the junior Asian championship in Taipei, Rupesh will kick off his new year with two warm-up events in Australia before taking part in the junior Australian Open. 

He will also be competing in the three other Grand Slam meets, along with several other tournaments around the globe. 

A fine talent Rupesh certainly is, though it?s too early to judge how far he will go when crunch times comes. But there?s no doubt that he?s got a godsent opportunity, something very few are blessed with in this country.

 Kumble best on Indian wickets, says Cairns

Mumbai: New Zealand vice-captain Chris Cairns said on Monday leg-spinner Anil Kumble was the best spinner on the Indian pitches as he utilises the unpredictable turn and bounce to his advantage. 

?Among the three best spinners in the world ? Australia?s Shane Warne, Kumble and Muttiah Muralidharan of Sri Lanka ? the Indian was the most effective on Indian wickets,? Carins, who was here to launch a toiletry product, said. 

Warne and Murali were also great in their own right as they could turn the ball on any surface, he said. 

When asked whether Indians could turn around the ongoing series against Australia which they are trailing 0-1, Cairns said if their top order clicked, the new ball bowlers could produce early wicket and the fielders support their bowlers well, the hosts could turn around the Test series. 

He also said it was unfortunate that Sachin Tendulkar was injured and V.V.S. Laxman was not in a good form. 

On his own injury prone career, he said: ?I?ve been playing since 15 years and my body cannot take anymore injuries and hence I have decided not to play in Test matches, which are more strenuous on the fast bowlers. 

?Moreover, I enjoy being with my family and cannot be away from my two sons for a longer period of time,? Cairns added. (PTI)

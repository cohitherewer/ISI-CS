 Ponting not to undergo surgery

 Ricky Ponting 

Sydney: Doctors have told Australia captain Ricky Ponting his broken thumb is not as bad as initially thought and will not require surgery. 

However, team doctor Trefor James said Ponting would still need time out to let the injury heal and was almost certain to miss the first Test against India in Bangalore starting on October 6. 

?After discussions with Ricky, we have decided he should rest for the next few days and will organise a re-examination for next week to check his progress and better assess when he might be able to grip a bat and field,? James said in a statement on Saturday. 

?Fortunately, the specialist has advised that the bones are sitting well and surgery will not be necessary. But it is difficult at this stage to assess how long will be needed before he can resume playing.? 

Ponting fractured his left thumb while fielding in the slips during Tuesday?s ICC Trophy semi-final loss to England in Birmingham. 

While the rest of the team flew straight to India to begin preparations for the four-Test series, Ponting returned to Australia. 

Cricket Australia announced on Thursday that uncapped Victoria batsman Brad Hodge would fill in for Ponting in India while Adam Gilchrist would take over the captaincy.

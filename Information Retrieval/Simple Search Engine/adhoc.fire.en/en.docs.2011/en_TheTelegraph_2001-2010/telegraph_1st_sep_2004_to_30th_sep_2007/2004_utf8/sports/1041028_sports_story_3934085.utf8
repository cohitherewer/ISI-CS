 Indian men crush Canada 

 - Women drop to joint ninth after loss to Georgia 

Mallorca: Indian men outclassed Canada with a crushing 3.5-0.5 victory in the 11th round of 36th Chess Olympiad at Gran Casino on Tuesday. 

Surya Shekhar Ganguly gave the team an early lead, overwhelming Igor Zugic, as reported in the Wednesday?s Late City edition. World rapid chess champion Viswanathan Anand then further boosted the confidence of a rather struggling team after 10th round loss against Cuba and defeated Pascal Charbonneau quite easily on the top board. 

On the second board, Krishnan Sasikiran was held to a draw by Mark Bluvshtein, but Sandipan Chanda gave India a much needed victory on the fourth board against Yan Teplitsky after a hard fought game. 

Meanwhile at the top the equation did not change much as Ukraine strengthened their position with a big 3-1 victory over Cuba and took their tally to 32 points out of a possible 44. 

Russia remained on the second spot after beating the USA 2.5-1.5 and they now trail the leaders by 2.5 points. Armenia kept their third position intact with an easy 2.5-1.5 victory over Switzerland and moved to 29 points, while Israel stand fourth on 28 after comprehensively beating Azerbaijan 3-1. Aided by the big victory, India jumped to joint fifth on 27.5 along with the US and there is a realistic chance to be among medals for them with three more rounds remaining. 

Indian men started off as big favourites against Canada and the victory was just an attestation to that. After two straight losses against Russia and Cuba, India desperately needed a big win in this match and fortunately for them not much went wrong, even though a 4-0 triumph would have been nicer. 

Playing white, Anand was sitting pretty with a huge positional advantage when Charbonneau just crumbled under pressure. 

Prior to Anand, Surya Sekhar crushed Zugic who employed a side variation in the Sicilian defence as black. Playing his normal attacking chess, Surya Sekhar emerged with a stronghold in the centre after unleashing an early attack against the black and by the 15th move itself his advantage was huge beyond doubt. 

Surya Sekhar ultimately finished the job in just 26 moves. 

Sasikiran?s result was a trifle disappointing for the Indian team as he drew with Mark Bluvshtein. 

Playing to a plan, Sandipan Chanda started off with the King?s Indian defence as black against Yan Teplitsky. The Canadian employed the classical set up against which the Indian was well armed as he quickly neutralised white?s advantage. Teplitsky could not quite match Sandipan?s better calculating abilities and and the issue was wrapped up after 61 moves. 

Indian eves suffered a disappointing 0.5-2.5 loss against Georgia and were thrown almost out of medal contention after the 11th round. 

The women were badly hit by enterprising Georgians as former world champion Maia Chiburdanidze capitalised on a rare blunder by Koneru Humpy and won a long drawn encounter on the top board, while Nana Dzagnidze outplayed S. Vijayalakshmi on the second, after Dronavalli Harika had done her bit on the last board by holding higher rated Lela Javakhishvili. 

The Chinese women inched closer to the title with an easy 1.5-1.5 draw with Hungary with all boards signing peace. Taking their tally to 26, china still maintain a clear four points lead over nearest rivals Georgia and look set to retain the title. The US and Hungary are next in line on 21.5 while France and England are now half a point adrift of them after smashing victories in round 11. 

Russia and Slovenia share the next spot, while the Indian women, who were joint third before this round, slipped to joint ninth after the debacle. 

On the top board Koneru Humpy lost to Chiburdanidze but only after a blunder in an at least drawn position. 

Vijayalakshmi was not in her elements against Dzagnidze who played the white side of a Nimzo Indian defence. Not reading the finer points of the middle game well, Vijayalakshmi conceded some advantage to Dzagnidze that the latter nurtured well. The game lasted 41 moves. 

Earlier in the day, Dronavalli Harika had secured a half point quite quickly against Javakhishvili and in hindsight it appears as though things might not have been much worse had she also tried harder.

 John Bracewell eyes turnaround

Brisbane: New Zealand coach John Bracewell believes his team can recover from one of their worst-ever maulings against Australia in time for the second Test against the world champions. 

The Black Caps suffered their second-heaviest defeat in 42 Tests against Australia when they crashed to an innings and 156 run-defeat here on Sunday. 

Stephen Fleming?s team were on top for the first two days of the Gabba Test but a record 216-run sixth-wicket stand between Man-of-the-Match Michael Clarke (141) and Adam Gilchrist (126) followed by a 114-run last-wicket partnership between tailenders Glenn McGrath (61) and Jason Gillespie (54) turned the match into a four-day canter for the Australians. 

It now remains to be seen whether New Zealand can pick up the pieces in the space of a few days to be competitive with the Aussies in the second and last Test of the series, starting at the Adelaide Oval on Friday. 

Australia dominate world cricket and have won 19 of their last 27 Tests over the last two years with just four defeats to India (twice), the West Indies and England. 

The Black Caps last beat Australia by five wickets in Auckland in March 1993. 

Bracewell, a former Test player, said on Monday New Zealand had only small window of opportunity to seize on if they were to beat Australia, but had to trust their game plans and skills to challenge Ricky Ponting?s men. 

?When you are playing against class acts and a number of these guys are great cricketers, not just good cricketers but they are establishing records of greatness, there are very small windows of opportunity,? Bracewell said. 

?Mental toughness is always something you?ve got to have when you come here and you know you?ve got to be tough to play against the world?s best team. 

?You know that Adelaide is conducive to scoring runs and you?ve got to be tough in terms of your bowling disciplines, in terms of coming back, sticking with the line, hitting the right areas. 

?You know you have to pick the right balls to score off, stay confident, stay positive and not let the situation get to you and stay with your plan. That?s part of toughness that we all need to beat the best.? 

New Zealand got themselves into a strong position on the opening two days of the Gabba Test by sticking to their plans, but it all unravelled spectacularly under the counter- attacking ferocity of Clarke and the New Zealand nemesis Gilchrist. 

?We tried to adjust our bowling lengths and we readjusted our strategy but it was a skill factor in terms of being able to execute it over a long periods of time and we got punished,? Bracewell said. 

?Perhaps the fact that only Chris Martin had bowled against these guys before, the counter-attacking may have become a little bit too much for them.? 

Asked if the Black Caps were scarred by their monumental loss, skipper Fleming said his bowlers had to stay true with their line and length even when they were under fire from the prodigious-scoring Aussies. 

Ponting?s team turned around a shaky position of 128 for four chasing 353 to amass 585 and a 232-run innings lead. 

?It doesn?t do too much (damage) because you expect the best to come hard,? Fleming said. 

?Gilchrist has done it to us a number of times because he?s a wonderful player with that ability to counter-punch. 

?Michael Clarke together with Gilchrist put together a match-winning partnership at a pretty crucial time and they didn?t do it slowly, that?s the damaging aspect because it?s done very quick, so the skill of the opposition side is to adjust and then to reiterate and be precise with them. 

?If you can slow them down you?ve got a chance, but it?s a tough prospect.? 

Bracewell said New Zealand had virtually a full squad from which to choose their team for the second Test. 

Meanwhile, Australia on Monday named an unchanged squad for the second Test.

withdrawal from the competition has been accepted by the Asian Football Confederation's 

(AFC) competitions committee and it gave the spot to India, according to information 

received here from the AFC.

London: Hungary manager Lothar Matthaeus has 

been branded irresponsible over his handling of Crystal Palace striker Sandor 

Torghelle by the Premier League club's disappointed coach Iain Dowie.

Palace were given assurances that their pound; 750,000 

pounds close season signing from MTK Hungaria would not play for in the World 

Cup qualifier at home to Iceland this week after being injured on international 

duty last month.

But Torghelle was still on the field to score in the 

75th minute of Hungary's 3-2 win on Wednesday and Dowie has accused former Germany 

World Cup-winner Matthaeus of breaking his word and risking the player's fitness.

Panis said in a statement.

 Cologne: Ian Woosnam, who missed a chance to win the 2001 British Open because of the infamous ?14th club incident?, again fell foul of the rule book when he was disqualified from the German Masters on Thursday. The 1991 US Masters champion, was disqualified during Thursday?s opening round for not signing for a score following a debacle at his closing hole.

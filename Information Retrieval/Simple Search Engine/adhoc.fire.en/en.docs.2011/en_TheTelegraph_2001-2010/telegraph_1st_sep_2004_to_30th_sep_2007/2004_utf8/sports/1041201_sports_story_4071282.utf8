The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Bagan in semis; EB crash out

 Beto struck a brace for Bagan 

Bangalore: Brazilian Roberto Mendes Silva ?Beto? scored twice as Mohun Bagan moved into the semi-finals of the Federation Cup football tournament with a 4-1 win over JCT Mills Phagwara here on Tuesday. 

However, a clash between Mohun Bagan and East Bengal in the semi-final failed to materialise as the red-golds crashed out of the tournament, losing 0-1 to Sporting Clube de Goa in another quarter final. Dudu Omagbemi struck the all important goal for the Goan side, who were trounced 4-0 by East Bengal in the Durand Cup quarter final earlier this month. 

The national champions were without some of their key players in the Durand clash. But on Tuesday, with nearly all the regulars in the squad, they failed to produce the same effect. 

With a barren first half, East Bengal (down to 10 men after Selwyn Fernandes was shown the red card in the second session) conceded the goal two minutes before the long whistle. 

Bagan will now meet Sporting Clube de Goa in the semi-final on Friday. 

Beto gave the green-maroons the lead in the 29th minute. JCT?s Nigerian goalkeeper Ajani Ayoade Ibrahim failed to collect a long shot from Beto cleanly and the ball slipped through his hands into the net. A minute before the lemon breather, Sunil Chhetri scored Bagan?s second goal with a header off a Tomba Singh cross. 

Changing ends, JCT tried desperately to come back into the game and their efforts paid off when Jaswinder Singh scored in the 64th minute. But it was the only consolation goal for JCT as the Calcutta giants changed gears again. 

Dulal Biswas made it 3-1 and Beto put the verdict beyond doubt with his superb second goal in the 86th minute.

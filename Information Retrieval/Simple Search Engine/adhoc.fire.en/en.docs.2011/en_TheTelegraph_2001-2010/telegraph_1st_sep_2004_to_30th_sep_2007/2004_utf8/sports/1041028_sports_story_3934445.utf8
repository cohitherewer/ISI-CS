The Telegraph - Calcutta

 India see red on green turf 

 - Middle-order snaps to Aussie quicks 

INDRANIL MAJUMDAR

 Nagpur: The Australians 

 have started to sense a reality in an improbable dream. 

 They strongly believe that the 35 years of series drought 

 will finally end, and are determined to wrap it up here 

 itself. So much so that coach John Buchanan is thinking 

 of enforcing the follow-on in case the Indian innings folds 

 up early on the third day. 

The Indians are not losing hope either. Sunil Gavaskar believes a turnaround is still possible and the Indians can avoid the follow-on. At close on the second day, the hosts are 252 runs behind with the last five men needing another 53 to make the visitors bat again. 

The mind games have started to surface as was evident during the Glenn McGrath-Virender Sehwag ?chat?. With eight men in close catching position on the off, McGrath has been trying to intimidate the batsmen to make his 100th Test memorable. 

The Indians may wish to find a devil in the wicket, but they can only blame themselves. The batsmen lacked the determination to hang around and the desire to play according to the situation. Once the moisture dried , the wicket looked perfect for batting, except for the occasional bounce, until the batsmen brought about their own doom. 

Akash Chopra?s lack of confidence showed in his minimum footwork and strokeless display. Virender Sehwag started off in whirlwind fashion taking 16 runs of Jason Gillespie?s first over and then failed in his attempt to cut a rising delivery outside the off stump. Chopra wasn?t to be left behind as he gave catching practice to first slip. 

Enter Sachin Tendulkar. Batting for the first time in match conditions in nearly three months, he was content with occupying the crease. 

McGrath amp; Co. never let the pressure off, testing him with short balls and a probing off-stump line. It was a gritty struggle for the maestro for all of the 48 minutes he was there. 

For someone who has an average of 165.25 in four Tests at the VCA Stadium, the scarcity of match practice showed in his approach and tentative feet movement. Six singles and a two comprised Sachin?s scoresheet as he battled through the 35-ball session. The debate on whether he should have taken this test will continue, but he has hardly ever been seen in such poor condition against the world champions. 

The dismissal came off a Gillespie delivery that nipped back slightly off the seam and struck him on the pads. Aleem Dar didn?t have to think twice before raising his index finger. As Sachin trudged back, the Aussies rejoiced at having won this battle of nerves. India struggled to recover from the psychological battering. 

V.V.S. Laxman showed early promise but became Shane Warne?s victim for the third time in the series. It came as a shocker as Warne?s second ball was short and wide and the batsman was committed to the cut a bit too early. 

Rahul Dravid tried to bring some sanity to the batting with his measured and sedate style. But extra caution can often lead to the bowlers calling the shots and that?s what happened with the Indian stand-in captain. He withstood 140 balls for a mere 21 runs, and except for a straight drive of Jason Gillespie, there was hardly any other convincing shot. 

But the revelation in this pack of forgettables has been Mohammed Kaif (47 batting, 6x4, 1x6). He played a superb knock in Chennai in a crisis and is well set for an encore. After surviving a ?catch? off a no-ball that hit his helmet, not for one moment did Kaif allow the bowlers to dictate terms. The temperament on display was amazing. He enthused confidence in younger partner Parthiv Patel and the pair has already added 43 in an unbroken sixth wicket stand. 

He was undeterred by the Aussies? pressure tactics and also showed the guts to step out and lift Warne for a six. McGrath was coming close to the wicket and angling the ball away, Michael Kasprowicz angling it in from wide of the crease while Gillespie relied more on pace and hit the deck more harder. 

The Australian innings lasted just 10.2 overs this morning, thanks to Zaheer Khan. 

Meanwhile, Brad Hodge, who left for Mumbai Tuesday following Ricky Ponting?s arrival, and was scheduled to take a midnight flight back home was summoned to rejoin the squad barely an hour before his departure. Hodge has been recalled as a back-up for Darren Lehmann, who may miss the Mumbai Test after tearing his right hamstring during batting on the opening day.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Nayeem: Call of country robbed us

A STAFF REPORTER

 Nayeemuddin 

Calcutta: Bengal coach Syed Nayeemuddin isn?t a happy person today. Back from Bengal?s less-than-impressive outing at the Santosh Trophy in New Delhi, he said Wednesday: ?Call of country robbed us of vital strengths, but I guess that can?t really be helped.? 

He said injury to three key players ? goalkeeper Sandip Nandy, Debjit Ghosh and Habibur Rehman Mondal ? was the primary cause of such results. Bengal failed to make the semi-finals. 

?Nandy had a knee right problem, swollen that it was, Habibur had hurt his head and Debjit was less than 100 per cent. Most injuries had been picked up in Singapore, during India?s match, and there was little I could do about that,? said the Dronacharya coach. ?In fact, Habibur?s injury is at a critical spot, above the right ear, near his temple and scans will have to be done. 

?Deepak Mondal was another player I missed. He, too came back from India?s engagement with a back injury and could not travel to Delhi.? 

He said it was time the Santosh Trophy was limited to under-23s or even under-19s. ?You can then divide the country into five zones and have a national junior league of sorts. 

Believe me, there is enough talent in the country, and we don?t really need to depend only on foreigners at club level,? he said. 

After the Santosh Trophy, Nayeem is again without an engagement. ?A freewheeler, you may say,? he smiled.

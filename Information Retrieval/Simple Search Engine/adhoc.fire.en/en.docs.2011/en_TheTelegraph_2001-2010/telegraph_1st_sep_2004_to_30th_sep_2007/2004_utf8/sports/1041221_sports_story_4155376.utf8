The Telegraph - Calcutta

 India wrap it up in 4 balls

 - Irfan Pathan Man-of-the-Series 

Chittagong: India needed just four deliveries to dismiss the last Bangladesh wicket and inflict an innings and 83 runs defeat on the hosts in the second Test for a 2-0 series whitewash here Monday. 

India, who had won the first Test in Dhaka by an innings and 140 runs, completed the formalities even before the paltry crowd could settle down on the penultimate day of the match at the M. A. Aziz Stadium, bowling out the hosts for 124. 

Bangladesh, who collapsed in their second innings to be placed at 118 for nine overnight, added just six runs this morning which came off the blade of Talha Jubair who sent the second ball of the day from Harbhajan Singh over the ropes for a six. 

But that was all the number 11 batsman could do before he holed out to Irfan Pathan at long on just two deliveries later, bringing an end to the ordeal of his side which suffered its 31st defeat in 34 matches since gaining Test status in 2000. 

The series win capped India?s fine run this year during which they won two more series ? against Pakistan and South Africa. It also improved India?s tally to 108 in the ICC Test rankings and brought them one point closer to second-placed England and three ahead of Pakistan (105). 

Bangladesh had raised hopes of putting a fight against their superior opponents when they made 333 in their first innings, built around a superb unbeaten 158 by eventual Man of the Match Mohammed Ashraful. 

But a familiar collapse in the second innings after Indian skipper Sourav Ganguly enforced the follow-on, meant India achieved a victory with almost two days to spare. 

The hosts had come quite close to avoiding the follow-on after bowling out the Indians for 540, but they fell short by just eight runs. 

It was Indian left-arm pacer Irfan Pathan (five for 32) who then wreaked havoc as he ripped through the top order before the spinners, led by Anil Kumble, shared the remaining wickets to fashion India?s comprehensive win. 

Bangladesh could have been bowled out well under the 100 mark but for the 40-run last wicket partnership between the number 10 batsman Nazmul Hossain and last man Jubair, who eventually emerged as the inning?s top scorer. 

Pathan, who finished with 18 wickets from the two Tests, was named Man of the Series. 

India now have an extra day of unscheduled rest but the intense security measures could also mean more time to kill ahead of the first of three one-day Internationals starting at the same venue Thursday. 

The second and third one-dayers are back to back matches under lights in Dhaka Sunday and Monday. 

Bangladesh, though, have more serious problems to worry about. 

The dazzling century by 20-year old Mohammed Ashraful caught the Indians unawares, but equally bizarre was their collapse in the second innings which lasted less than 27 overs.

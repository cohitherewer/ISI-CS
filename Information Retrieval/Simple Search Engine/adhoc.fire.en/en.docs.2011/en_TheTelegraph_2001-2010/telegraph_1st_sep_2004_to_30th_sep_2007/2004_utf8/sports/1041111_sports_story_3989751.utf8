 Gagan Ajit, Deepak may miss out again

 - Squad likely to be retained; Spain to play Tests 

 Gagan Ajit Singh 

Chandigarh: Stars Gagan Ajit Singh and Deepak Thakur are likely to remain out of the Indian hockey team, for apparently different reasons, as the team prepares for the Champions Trophy in Lahore and even as two preparatory home Tests were announced versus Spain. 

The Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) Wednesday said the team that played the recent Friendship Series versus Pakistan will be retained. IHF president K. P. S. Gill said the aim was to retain the young team, that had fetched ?unexpected? results against Pakistan. 

?Gagan was not there in the team that played against Pakistan,? Gill told reporters when asked specifically if the forward?s career was nearing an end. 

The Punjab player was not picked for the eight-match Test series in October despite reporting fit, adding meat to the view that there has been a fall-out with the IHF, developing after the Athens Olympic Games, and this might lead to the premature curtailment of this star scorer?s career. 

The IHF chief also made it clear that there would be no place in the team for veterans Dhanraj Pillay and Baljit Singh Dhillon. ?There is no question of taking Pillay back into the team. I don?t think Baljit has a chance either,? Gill said. 

On the current team, he said: ?The young boys have a lot of potential. They play as a team, which is important. This team is very committed. I think after many years players are united in wanting to do well.? 

?Our penalty conversions in the Olympics and defence against Pakistan in the last series was good,? Gill said, but admitted that there were certain weaknesses that needed sorting out. 

He, though, did not point out that the number of penalty corners forced had gone down considerably. 

?Our players miss a large number of scoring opportunities,? he said, adding that German ?penalty corner conversion specialist? Oliver Kurtz, who was with the Indian team till before the Olympics, will ?join soon?. 

Asked about the team?s tendency to concede last-minute goals, he said the coaches were working on it and the team should get into the winning groove within the next six to eight months. 

Gill brushed aside a suggestion that the IHF should appoint a psychologist on the lines of the cricket team. ?There?s no question of appointing anyone (psychologist). Pressed further, he said: ?That?s why they (cricketers) start losing from Day I.? 

Earlier, captain Dilip Tirkey had stressed the need for a psychologist. 

Gill also said that Deepak Thakur would not be considered for the forthcoming international tournaments because he had been advised rest by doctors for a period of six months. 

Thakur had breathing problems during the Athens Games and has been on the sidelines since. 

Practice matches 

Meanwhile, the IHF also announced Olympic semi-finalists Spain?s two-Test series in Chandigarh later this month. The matches will be on November 28 and 30 at the Sector-42 Stadium. 

Interestingly, the matches will be officiated by umpires Rashid Mahmood Butt and Syed Zulfiqar Haider, both from Pakistan. 

Spain will be visiting India for the first time in eight years. The last time they were in India was in 1996 when they played in the Indira Gandhi Gold Cup. The Spaniards are coached by Dutchman Maurits Hendrlis. They reach India on November 26 before heading for Chandigarh. They leave for Lahore on December 1.

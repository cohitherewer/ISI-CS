The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Poor turnout fails to dampen CAB spirits

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The opening day of the final Test between India and South Africa witnessed a relatively poor turnout at Eden Gardens on Sunday. The organisers, though, are still putting on a brave face. 

Admitting that they couldn?t recollect such ?unsatisfactory? attendance on an opening day here in recent past, CAB officials feel crowd presence might shoot up as the match progresses. About 40,000 turned out on Sunday. 

Asked about this, CAB president and chairman of the organising committee Jagmohan Dalmiya said it?s not surprising since the Test was immediately following an ODI (between India and Pakistan on November 13). 

?It happened after the Nehru Cup (in 1989) and Hero Cup (in 1993). So it?s nothing new,? Dalmiya said on Sunday. 

?We could have hosted one of the Tests versus Australia here, but refrained from doing so, keeping in mind the unpredictable nature of the climate at this time of the year. South Africa being the next option, we decided to hold the Test despite knowing that a ODI would precede it and there?s possibility of loss,? he said. 

Dalmiya, also the Asian Cricket Council president, said that plans are afoot to popularise the game in China through the Twenty-20 format. 

The Eden turnout, though, excited South African coach Ray Jennings. ?We don?t see so many people watching the five-day version of the game back home,? Jennings stated. 

His wife Alison was also ecstatic. ?The atmosphere was electrifying and I even wanted to go to the gallery but wasn?t allowed to do so by the security,? rued Alison.

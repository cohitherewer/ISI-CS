 Secy returns with promises

 - Mayor threatens to surrender mohun bagan membership 

 OUR STAFF REPORTERS 

Calcutta: The drunken brawl at the CCFC Sunday evening involving a section of Mohun Bagan officials has once again brought to the fore the ugly face of the existing rivalry between the two factions. 

The fallout of the brawl sees secretary Anjan Mitra back in the picture, and Monday, at a hurriedly called press conference at the club premises, Mitra said he has convened a emergency meeting of the club executives at 4.30 pm Tuesday to discuss the issue. His decision followed a meeting with city mayor Subrata Mukherjee who called on the club secretary. 

Mukherjee threatened to surrender his membership if the accused were not brought to book immediately. 

The mayor also said that this was a ?disgrace and a black day in the club?s history? and called for elections for the smooth functioning of the club. 

Seven persons were arrested Sunday evening following a complaint by the CCFC with the Ballygunge police station. ?Trouble started after the exhibition match (Selvel XI vs McDowell?s XI) and the prize distribution ceremony were over. It was a drunken brawl and the seven were arrested on charges of rioting and mischief,? said deputy commissioner (headquarters) Sanjoy Mukherjee. They were released on bail Monday afternoon. 

Mitra?s vitriol was aimed at Balaram Chowdhury, the assistant secretary, and his associates who were allegedly involved in last evening?s incident. 

?Balaram?s antisocial activities are not new. His membership was cancelled on two previous occasions and has also spent seven days in prison. The executive committee will meet tomorrow to take strong action against the accused,? said Mitra. 

At a separate press conference in his office, Chowdhury ?condemned? the incident and said ?people from outside had masterminded the feud.? He also refused to resign owning moral responsibility. 

Chowdhury also informed that a two/three member inquiry committee had been constituted to look into the matter, but refused to divulge any further details. 

Mitra, for his part, refused to accept the existence of any inquiry committee and said, ?whatever decision is to be taken will be arrived at by the executive committee?. It was also learnt that UB Group, the club sponsors, have also expressed concern over the latest episode in the strife-driven club. 

Earlier, in the morning, one of the special officers, Justice Shyamal Sen held a meeting with the players and named two officials for handling football-related matters. Coach Subrata Bhattacharya was given the ultimate authority in taking a decision on the football team.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Harbhajan takes a swipe at critics

 - My best is yet to come, says off-spinner 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Harbhajan Singh celebrates with Mohammed Kaif after dismissing Damien Martyn on the fourth day of the first Test at the Chinnaswamy Stadium on Saturday 

Bangalore: The young Sardar, Harbhajan Singh, is angry. Angry at critics who seem to regularly (and unnecessarily) put him under the scanner. 

?Hopefully, my 11 wickets in the first Test will silence those who keep... They should remember I?m a human being, not God, and can?t always be among the wickets in a big way,? Harbhajan boomed on Saturday evening. 

Apparently, he is cut up with a couple of TV commentators. Of course, they weren?t identified. 

Harbhajan, though, is today a lot more confident. Indeed, when somebody asked if his 11 for 224 is going to be remembered as his best, he promptly answered: ?My best is yet to come...? 

Obviously, Harbhajan is disappointed that his fine performance will largely go unsung as a big defeat awaits the home side. ?The match isn?t over, but we do need to analyse and learn from mistakes,? he said. 

Basically, Harbhajan suggested we keep faith in Team India. Also, he made the point that Sachin Tendulkar?s possible return, in the second Test, would lift the side. 

Later, speaking to The Telegraph, Harbhajan picked his fourth-day dismissal of Michael Clarke as the wicket which gave him most satisfaction.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 IHF to give more powers to Rach

 - Jugraj a possibility in the Chandigarh camp for Champions Trophy 

 SUJIT BHAR 

 Jugraj will be called for assessment 

Calcutta: There seems to be a wind of change blowing in the Indian Hockey Federation (IHF). The changes seem to have stemmed, primarily from the Athens Olympics debacle, and have been moulded further through the recent India-Pakistan Test series which India lost but showed decent grit. 

A spokesperson for the IHF told The Telegraph from Delhi on Saturday that this time chief coach Gerhard Rach of Germany ?will have some more powers?, meaning a freer hand, ?and will have the final say in team composition.? 

While this comment busts the myth that there has been little interference with the coaches from the top in team selection, it also sees a change in the stance of IHF chief K.P.S. Gill, who has been quoted as saying that he will henceforth be more authoritative in dealing with matters in the federation. 

Rach is now back home in Munich and will be back in time for the Chandigarh camp for the Champions Trophy, starting on October 27. The meet is in Lahore from December 4 to 12. 

The selectors? panel, though, remains, and they will probably have the right to choose the initial 25 for the camp, with Rach allowed to make essential amends to the list. The current set of 18 who played in the recent Test series will be there, and additions will be made for a complement of about 25 for the camp. There is absolutely no talk about the likes of Dhanraj Pillay and Baljeet Dhillon. 

Jugraj Singh remains a possibility. The IHF official said he is not sure if Jugraj will be fit enough, and confirmed that ?he will be called to the camp for an assessment?, Jugraj said over phone from Jalandhar on Saturday that he was ?totally fit and faced no problems whatsoever.? 

He said he would only be too willing to go and prove himself at the camp, because ?I have been playing friendlies here, with the Punjab Armed Police team and I have faced no problem.? He, though, was in the dark about receiving any call from the IHF or anybody regarding the camp. 

This correspondent, in fact, was the first to tell him. 

The ace drag-flicker said even his confidence level was ?high? and felt he was right for the picking. ?When I was in Arizona with the squad for the physical camp, I felt very good, but my physical condition wasn?t 100 per cent. But now I feel I will surely be able to come back to the fold if given an opportunity.? 

Asked if his employers will give him a certificate of fitness. He said: ?That will be absolutely unnecessary, because everybody can see my fitness level now.? 

He also remembers the Arizona facilities as ?years ahead of facilities in our country. We can?t even imagine such things here, like the gym, the physiotherapy unit?? 

That was a period when Indian hockey stars were into physicals only, and off hockey. An aspect that some experts have said was responsible for the poor performance thereafter. 

Jugraj said that he did not believe that the team now was playing better than they did at the Olympic Games because of the induction of youngsters, but that ?there are always ups and downs in any team?. 

The IHF, though, it seems will stick to its youngsters tag. They are talking about more young blood, though rookies have been totally ruled out. 

Deepak Thakur, who was out of the Olympic Games after he suffered breathing problems and erratic heartbeat problems in Athens, is still undergoing treatment, one was informed, in Patiala. Hence he will have to produce a certificate of fitness from his personal doctor. There will be no IHF doctors to certify Thakur, ?because they are all general doctors, and not specialists in this field, and the certificate of this specialist (of Thakur) will be enough.? 

?Gagan Aijt Singh might also be called in, but I guess it?s still to premature for this assessment. We still have time.? 

There has been a small problem of personnel, what with the Indian colts? team travelling Down Under for a four-match series against the Australian under-21 team. That series, though, ends of October 30, and there is a possibility of some of those players joining up this camp for the Champions Trophy. 

India made the grade in the Champions Trophy despite finishing seventh in Athens (a sixth-place finish was necessary), because Australia pulled out at the last moment citing security concerns in Pakistan.

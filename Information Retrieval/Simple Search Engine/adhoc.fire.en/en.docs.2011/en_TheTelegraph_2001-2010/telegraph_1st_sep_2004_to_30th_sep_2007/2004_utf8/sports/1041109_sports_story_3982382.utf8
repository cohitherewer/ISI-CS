The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Prasad may coach mediumpacers

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Former Team India mediumpacer Venkatesh Prasad is available for coaching assignment for Karnataka seamers any time this season, Karnataka State Cvricket Association joint secretary Sudhakar Rao told The Telegraph here on Monday. 

?We can ask for his help even during the Ranji Trophy, as he has already called it a day a few months back,? Rao said. 

According to Rao, Prasad might also take up the coach?s job of the Hyderabad Ranji Trophy side this season. But that won?t prevent him from helping the Karnataka bowlers. ?Even if he goes to Hyderabad, he will probably go during the Ranji season and after that he will be available for us,? Rao said.

 Chucking laws should be clearer: Akram

New Delhi: Former Pakistan captain and left-arm seamer Wasim Akram on Saturday said ICC laws on chucking ought to be made simpler as even he, with all his experience, failed to make sense of the ?tolerance levels?. 

?It is very difficult for me to figure out what this tolerance level means. You are talking about 10 degree, 15 degrees, I cannot make any sense from that. If this is the case with a bowler who has played international cricket, how can a layman understand that? What we need is clear rules,? Akram said. 

The former Pakistan skipper also said the ICC should be clear about who is bowling legally or otherwise. 

?ICC should either ban a bowler who does not concur to the law books or allow him to play. There should not be a situation where the player is in doubt all through his career,? he said. (PTI)

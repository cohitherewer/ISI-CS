 La Plagne (France): Guy Forget has decided to stand down as captain of France?s Fed Cup women?s team because of conflicting Davis Cup commitments next year.

 The 39-year-old, who also skippers the French Davis Cup men?s team, said it was not possible to combine the jobs because of overlapping schedules in the two events.

 ?If the schedules had made it possible, I would have loved to stay as Amelie Mauresmo has decided to commit herself to the Fed Cup,? Forget said on Tuesday. ?But leading the two teams at the same time is not reasonable. It would be unfair for the guys and the girls.?

 Forget, an 11-times winner on the ATP Tour, was appointed captain of the French Fed Cup team in 1999. He led the women to Fed Cup success in 2003 and also into this year?s final, where they lost 2-3 to hosts Russia in Moscow. 

 Ljubljana: Olympic 800m bronze medallist Jolanda Ceplak has been named Slovenian Sportswoman of the Year for the third time in a row.

 She beat another Olympic bronze winner, Urska Zolnir, who won her medal in judo, into second place.

 ?This is the largest sports event in Slovenia therefore it is a great honour to win this award,? said 28-year-old Ceplak, an indoor 800 metres world record holder. Vasilij Zbogar, a 29-year-old Olympic bronze-medallist in laser sailing, was elected Sportsman of the Year, the Association of Slovenian Sports Journalists announced on Monday.

 Milan: The Italian government has stepped in to help fill a gap in the budget for the 2006 Winter Olympics with a sponsorship deal that should be finalised by February.

 Turin?s Olympic Committee (TOROC) board met on Tuesday to approve the draft 2005 budget which is expected to see it through to the Winter Games, starting on February 10, 2006.

 The board also studied a partnership proposal from Sviluppo Italia, a funding group fully owned by the Italian Treasury. TOROC has been struggling to raise sponsorship money needed to fund the Games and earlier this year said there was a hole of 186 million euros ($253.7 million) in its budget.

 Beijing: The Chinese national soccer team on Wednesday cancelled their trip to the United States for a four-nation tournament to be played in January citing lack of communication from the host, the state media reported.

 The tournament, featuring Mexico, Saudi Arabia, China and the US, was originally slated for next February but was rescheduled to be played between January 23-29 because Saudi Arabia will play a World Cup qualifier, team manager Zhu Yuanhe said.

 ?The host has not done enough to communicate with the playing teams and some of the them have not confirmed their participation. So we have to cancel the trip to the US,? Zhu was quoted as saying by the Xinhua news agency.

 Tokyo: South Korea striker Choi Yong-soo has joined Japan?s Jubilo Iwata, officials from the J-League club said on Wednesday.

 The 31-year-old was on loan to second division side Kyoto Purple Sanga from JEF United Ichihara, where he scored 54 goals in 73 appearances. Choi was a member of South Korea?s squad at the 1998 and 2002 World Cups.

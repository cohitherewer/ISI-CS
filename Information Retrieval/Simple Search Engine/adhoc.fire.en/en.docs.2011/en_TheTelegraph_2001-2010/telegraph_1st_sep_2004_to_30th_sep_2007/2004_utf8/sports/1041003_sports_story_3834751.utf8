 Inzy may miss tie vs Zimbabwe

Peshawar: Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq may miss Sunday?s second one-day International match of the triangular series against Zimbabwe with a groin injury. 

?I have not fully recovered from the injury and will decide tomorrow morning whether I am fit enough for the match,? Inzamam said on Saturday. 

Pakistan have also called up wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal as a back-up for Moin Khan. ?Moin is down with severe flu and he might miss the match tomorrow. Kamran has been called as a backup to replace him if required,? Pakistan manager Haroon Rasheed said on Saturday. 

Pakistan won the opening game in Multan by 144 runs, highlighted by Abdul Razzaq?s 107 and a whirlwind knock of 58 off 26 balls by Shahid Afridi. Inzamam sustained the groin injury during his innings of 73 and did not field when Zimbabwe were dismissed for 148 in reply to Pakistan?s 292 for seven. 

Despite the lopsided result, Zimbabwe seamers Tinashe Panyangara and Douglas Hondo exploited Pakistan?s weakness at the top of the order and claimed four quick wickets for only 36 runs before Inzamam, Razzaq and Afridi guided them to a safe total. ?Zimbabwe gave us an early wake-up call in Multan, but we are having problems (in batting) upfront, which we are trying to overcome,? Inzamam said. 

Pakistan have rested pacer Mohammed Sami for the second match and included debutant seamer Rao Iftikhar, who was the most expensive Pakistan bowler and claimed one wicket for 41 runs off his seven overs. ?We?ll give a chance to all the 15 players in this series. We might even rest Shoaib Akhtar and include Sami in the game,? Inzamam said. Shoaib didn?t concede a no ball or wide in his disciplined six-over spell for the wicket of opener Brendan Taylor. 

Zimbabwe captain Tatenda Taibu said it was not difficult for him to motivate his players despite getting a hammering in Multan. ?It?s tough when you throw them (players) at the deep end, but they have realised their mistakes and I hope we show an improved performance tomorrow,? Taibu said. 

Taibu said that had his bowlers restricted Pakistan to 200 before Razzaq and Afridi?s onslaught, his batsmen had a chance in the first game. 

?If we do our basics right and put Pakistan on the backfoot, I still believe we have a chance to make an upset in this series,? Taibu said.

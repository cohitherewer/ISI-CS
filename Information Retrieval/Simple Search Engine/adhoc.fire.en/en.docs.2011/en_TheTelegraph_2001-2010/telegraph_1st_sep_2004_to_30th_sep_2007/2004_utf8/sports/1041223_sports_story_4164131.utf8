Calcutta: Bengal batsmen huffed and puffed against mediocre Delhi bowling on a seaming wicket on the opening day of the Ranji Trophy Elite Group match before managing to reach 229 for seven when play was stopped due to bad light. 

All the advantage of winning the toss evaporated as the hosts lost wickets at regular intervals and the experienced Delhi players tightened their grip through some intelligent captaincy and gamesmanship. 

The fair sprinkling of grass on the wicket prompted the visitors to drop Sarandeep Singh and go in with a three-pronged pace attack. Ajay Jadeja?s gentle medium-pace also came in handy. 

It needs loads of patience and concentration to build an innings and the batsmen were found wanting both in temperament and technique when it came to tackling the seam and swing on this wicket. Even former Test opener Deep Dasgupta batted like a novice and it was left to captain Rohan Gavaskar and Subhomoy Das to take the responsibility. 

Rohan?s 68 may not have been convincing, but he surely showed the determination to carry on. Having survived a confident leg before shout early, he never allowed the Delhi bowlers to dictate terms. In the process, he also completed 4000 runs in the championship. 

The dismissal, however, was not to his liking and the Bengal captain also got involved in an exchange of words with Jadeja on his way back to the pavilion, prompting the umpires to intervene. 

Match Referee Sanjay Patil later said that the matter had been sorted out. ?The players has been asked to show restraint,? said Patil. 

?This is part and parcel of the game and shouldn?t be exaggerated,? Jadeja remarked. 

To make matters worse for the hosts, Subhomoy had to retire hurt with lower back spasms a little before close. Though the Bengal camp was confident he would bat Wednesday, he struggled to walk properly and was in considerable pain even an hour after stumps. 

Amit Bhandari and Kunal Lal made good use of the conditions in the morning. A few chances went astray as edges flew thick and fast. Deep was caught at third slip and debutant Rakesh Krishnan?s off stump was knocked off. 

As Rohan and Arindam Das tried to give some stability to the innings came the opener?s dismissal. He misjudged the line as the ball took the inside edge on way to the stumps. 

The 85-run partnership for the fourth wicket between Rohan and Subhomoy had brought temporary relief but the flurry of wickets in the closing stages again tilted the scales in Delhi?s favour. 

Bhandari struck in his third spell as he removed a well-settled Laxmi Ratan Shukla. Both Arindam and Shukla were out to irresponsible shots after having got their eyes set. Manoj Tewari was run out going for a needless second run and once Murtaza Lodhgar fell leg before, the hosts challenge almost faded. 

?It?s been a decent opening day but could have been better,? Jadeja summed it up well. He felt Delhi would be happy to restrict Bengal within 270. 

?A seaming wicket becomes easier to bat on as the match progresses and it shouldn?t be any different here,? Jadeja explained. 

Left-arm pacer Kunal, son of Delhi coach and former India allrounder Madan Lal, was the most successful with his probing line and length. He was never disheartened ? despite a few of his lbw shouts going unattended and having had Arindam bowled off a no-ball on 23 ? but bowled with renewed vigour and enthusiasm. 

The turn of events shouldn?t have been encouraging for CAB president Jagmohan Dalmiya who watched the match from the sidelines for most part of the day. It remains to be seen how Shib Shankar Paul and Co. live up to the challenge in front of national selector V.B Chandrasekhar.

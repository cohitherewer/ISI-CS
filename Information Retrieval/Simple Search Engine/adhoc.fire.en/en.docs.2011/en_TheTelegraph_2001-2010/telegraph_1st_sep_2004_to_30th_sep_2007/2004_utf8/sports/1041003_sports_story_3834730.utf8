The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Arsenal win 4-0

London: Defending champions Arsenal opened up a provisional five-point lead at the top of the Premier League with a 4-0 thrashing of Charlton Athletic at Highbury on Saturday. 

With Chelsea hosting Liverpool on Sunday, Thierry Henry scored twice as Arsene Wenger?s team kept up their momentum and stretched their record unbeaten league run to 48 games. 

Aston Villa drew 2-2 at Blackburn Rovers, while Norwich and Portsmouth also shared four goals at Carrow Road. Earlier, struggling Southampton drew goalless at home to Manchester City. 

Arsenal pair Patrick Vieira and Lauren started at Highbury following their midweek scuffle on the team bus after the disappointing 1-1 Champions League draw with Rosenborg Trondheim. 

After 33 minutes Dennis Bergkamp squared the ball for Freddie Ljungberg to tap in. Henry then struck the cheekiest of goals three minutes after the break, back-heeling the ball into the corner of the net. 

At Goodison Park, Spurs? miserly defence held firm and Noe Pamarot headed in his first goal for the club after 53 minutes to earn three points.

 Beckham stays atop players? rich list

 England captain has a personal fortune of ?65 million 

David Beckham has retained his place as the richest footballer in Britain with an estimated personal fortune of ?65 million, but he is still placed only 41st behind the oil barons, bankers and industrialists who hold the game?s real power, according to a new study. 

In FourFourTwo football magazine?s ?rich list?, Beckham, 29, is followed in the players? list by Arsenal striker Dennis Bergkamp, who has amassed a fortune of ?37 million through shrewd investments, and then by his Real Madrid teammate Michael Owen, who is worth ?30 million. 

Robbie Fowler, a property magnate in north-west England, is fourth with a fortune rated at ?28 million, ahead of Alan Shearer on ?22 million and Sol Campbell on ?20 million. 

Manchester United?s Rio Ferdinand, Roy Keane and Ryan Giggs are also sitting on fortunes of ?20 million, which is a good deal more than their manager Sir Alex Ferguson. 

The Scot, who begins a new ?4.5 million annual rolling contract in the summer, is said to be worth ?15 million. The consolation for him is that the list puts him well clear of Sven-Goran Eriksson on ?10 million and is more than double what Kevin Keegan and Arsene Wenger are estimated to be worth. 

Some of the surprising inclusions in the top 20 are Phil Neville, whose ?5 million fortune is ?2 million less than brother Gary?s, and Duncan Ferguson, the Everton striker who will come out of contract this summer but has an estimated wealth of ?10 million. 

But all these numbers pale in comparison with the overall top-ten, led by Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich, Britain?s richest man, on ?7.5 billion. He is followed by the Barbados-based investor Joe Lewis, whose investment company ENIC own Tottenham Hotspur but also retain an interest in Rangers. 

There are no fewer than four of Manchester United?s major shareholders in the top 10, led by Dermot Desmond, the Irish investo. 

An unfamiliar name in the top-ten is Trevor Hemmings, the owner of Blackpool Tower and Littlewoods Pools, who has stakes in Charlton and Preston. 

Beckham will have a long way to go to catch the truly rich. He has only just overtaken Bolton Wanderers? owner Eddie Davies who made his ?60 million fortune manufacturing thermostats for kettles on the Isle of Man.

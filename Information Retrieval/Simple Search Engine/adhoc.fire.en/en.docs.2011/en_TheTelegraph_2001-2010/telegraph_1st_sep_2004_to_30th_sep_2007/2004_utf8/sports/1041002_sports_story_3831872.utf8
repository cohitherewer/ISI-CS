Paris: Four British clubs stormed into the group stages of the Uefa Cup, but their night of celebration was overshadowed as the spectre of hooliganism involving English fans returned to haunt the continent. 

In Budapest on Thursday, one supporter was stabbed in the back during violent clashes between Ferencvaros and Millwall supporters. 

Police were also called in to stop fighting in the Czech town of Ostrava between followers of the local team and Middlesbrough. 

The incidents took the gloss off a good night?s work for Newcastle, Boro, Hearts and Rangers, who all made it through to the next round. 

In Israel, former England skipper Alan Shearer grabbed a hattrick and Patrick Kluivert scored twice as Newcastle brushed past Arab-Israeli rookies Bnei Sakhnin 5-1 in Tel Aviv. 

The 7-1 aggregate win also kept up Graeme Souness?s unbeaten run since he took over from the sacked Bobby Robson as coach at the English club. 

In Glasgow, Rangers went through in dramatic style with penalties deciding their first round match against Maritimo of Portugal. 

Dado Prso?s goal 20 minutes from time levelled the tie and took the game into extra-time and eventually penalties for Frenchman Gregory Vignal to score the vital spotkick to put Alex Mcleish?s side through. 

The Glasgow side went into the tie trailing Maritimo 0-1 from Gustavo Manduca?s first leg goal. 

Hearts made it a Scottish one-two when a 2-2 draw at Braga gave them a 5-3 aggregate win over the Portuguese side. Joao Tomas put the home side ahead, but Mark de Vries then scored twice to settle Craig Levein?s men?s nerves before a late goal from Jaime gave Braga a consolation. 

In Budapest, Ferencvaros produced a superb first half performance to beat Millwall 3-1 to go through to the second round of Europe?s second club competition 4-2 on aggregate. 

In Ostrava, Middlesbrough had to overcome the sending-off of Franck Queudrue before battling to a 1-1 draw and a 4-1 aggregate win. 

French side Lille sealed a comfortable 2-0 win over plucky Irishmen Shelbourne to secure a 4-2 aggregate triumph. 

Serie A side Lazio booked their place in the group stages beating Metalurg Donetsk 3-0 on the night for a 6-0 aggregate win. 

The Italians scored their three goals inside the first 25 minutes with midfielder Fabio Liverani scoring twice and striker Roberto Muzzi grabbing the other. 

Lazio?s Serie A rivals Udinese were dumped out of the competition, despite winning 1-0 in a bad-tempered clash at home to Greek side Panionios.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 India set off today 

A CORRESPONDENT

 Injured Dipak has been ruled out 

New Delhi: A depleted Indian squad leaves for Muscat on Monday for their final World Cup qualifier against Oman on Wednesday. There were just seventeen fit players left in the camp in the capital and so all are selected for the trip to Oman. 

Injuries so far have deprived the Indian squad of five key players ? goalkeeper Sandip Nandy, striker Bhaichung Bhutia, defenders Dipak Mondal and Mahesh Gawli and midfielder S. Venkatesh. 

Mondal, who got injured in the recent Durand Cup semi-final, playing for his club East Bengal against JCT, was expected to captain the Indian squad. However, he has been ruled out and so captaincy will go to either one of his East Bengal teammates, Sangram Mukherjee or Climax Lawrence. 

Stephen Constantine was livid that the All India Football Federation (AIFF) allowed the national players to represent their respective clubs in the recent Durand Cup. 

He said that the AIFF took the decision against his wishes and this led to further injuries for Mondal. 

He also complained that it deprived him of having the entire squad at his disposal during the camp. 

As Japan have already topped the group, it was expected that Constantine would use the November 17 match to try out new players. However, he has not chosen any of the players recommended by the selectors in the recent Santosh Trophy, held here. 

Syed Rahim Nabi, chosen for the World Cup qualifier against Singapore on October 13, sneaks in as Mondal?s replacement. Nabi did not tour Kuwait for the friendly tie. However as India have an inexperienced defence he could start in the backline against Oman. 

THE SQUAD 

Goalkeepers: Sangram Mukherjee (East Bengal), Prasanta Dora (Mohun Bagan); Defenders: Syed Rahim Nabi, Habibur Rahman Mondal (East Bengal), Sameer Naik (Dempo), Vinu Jose (Vasco), Gurjinder Singh (TFA); Midfielders: Tomba Singh (Mohun Bagan), Climax Lawrence, Alvito D?Cunha (East Bengal), Jatin Singh Bisht, Debabrata Roy(Mahindra United); Forwards: Jerry Zirsanga, Asim Biswas (Mohun Bagan), R.C. Prakash (Dempo), Abhishek Yadav (Mahindra United), Vimal Periyar (TFA). Coach: Stephen Constantine.

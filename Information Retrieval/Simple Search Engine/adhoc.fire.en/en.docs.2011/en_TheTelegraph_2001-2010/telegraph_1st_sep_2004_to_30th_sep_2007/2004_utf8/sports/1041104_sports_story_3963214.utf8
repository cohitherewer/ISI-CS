 Dettori suspended for 4 weeks 

 Melbourne, Nov 3: Leading British-based jockey Frankie Dettori has been suspended for four weeks for careless riding in the Melbourne Cup, officials said on Wednesday. The Italian, head rider for the powerful Arab-owned Godolphin stable, was asked to attend a hearing with the stewards after his mount Mamool finished seventh in Tuesdays 3,200 metres Melbourne Cup at the Flemington track.

 Dettori pleaded guilty to a charge of careless riding. The 33-year-old said he had allowed his mount to shift to the outside of Hugs Dancer when not sufficiently clear of Distinction. The global suspension begins at midnight on Saturday and ends on December 4. 

 Dettori said he shifted to get out from under Hugs Dancers heels as that horse was not going forward at the time and he wanted to follow Vinnie Roe, who was eventually second behind race winner Makybe Diva. ?My record is impeccable in your jurisdiction,? Dettori added after telling the stewards that conditions were difficult in the rain-soaked race.

 Dettori has a personal-best of second place in his nine rides in the A$4.6 million (US$3.5 million) Melbourne Cup, Australias richest and most famous horse race. Australias super mare Makybe Diva won a second successive Melbourne Cup before trainer Lee Freedman took aim at Europes finest by signalling a possible Arc de Triomphe campaign in France. The six-year-old became first of her sex and the fourth horse to win consecutive Melbourne Cups in the 144-year history of the (US$3.5 million) handicap race. (Reuters)

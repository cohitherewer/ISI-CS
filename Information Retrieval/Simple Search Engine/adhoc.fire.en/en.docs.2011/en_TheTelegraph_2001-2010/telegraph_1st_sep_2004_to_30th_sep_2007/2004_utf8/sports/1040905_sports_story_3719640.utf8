 United will find it tough: Rooney

Manchester: Wayne Rooney believes he may have to wait until next season to celebrate Premiership title glory with Manchester United. 

The 18-year-old England striker, who moved to Old Trafford for 27 million from Everton on Tuesday, hinted that after a start to the season which sees Alex Fergusons side ninth in the table and seven points adrift of the top two, the title might be beyond them this season. 

Weve got some good young players at the club and providing we can all grow together in the team, I think well eventually come good again, the teenager told the clubs website. 

Its a big challenge for us and we might not win the league this season; it might take two or three years. But I really think were capable of matching both Arsenal and Chelsea. 

Rooney will have to wait for his debut as he is till suffering from a broken bone in his foot, a legacy of his sensational performances at the Euro 2004. 

Going out to Portugal was a big experience for me and after doing as well as I did out there, I felt that I had moved my game on and I wanted to be playing in the Champions League, said Rooney. 

I think it will be a different type of challenge and a difficult one too because youll be up against the top players in Europe, Rooney added. 

Rooney has come under intense scrutiny in recent weeks with various lurid allegations involving his private life keeping large sections of the tabloid press busy. 

But he believes his is still maturing as a player and a person.

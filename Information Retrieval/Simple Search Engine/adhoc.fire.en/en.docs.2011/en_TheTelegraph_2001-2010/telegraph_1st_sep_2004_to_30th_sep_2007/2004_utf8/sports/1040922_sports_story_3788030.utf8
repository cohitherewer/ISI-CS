 Europeans underdogs no more

 - Langer amp; Co. have proved that rankings don?t count when game turns to matchplay

It was suggested that the Americans must have removed the scoreboard from behind the 18th green because they wanted to keep the results as quiet as possible as Europe headed towards their record 18-1/2 to 9-1/2 Ryder Cup victory. 

The truth of the matter is that there was no scoreboard, either there or anywhere else. What they had at Oakland Hills were giant, state-of-the-art screens which showed snatches of play and gave the odd score. For the most part, though, they featured nothing other than a still of the Ryder Cup trophy. 

It all explains why Colin Montgomerie, when he arrived on the 18th green on Sunday with his one-hole lead against David Toms, had absolutely no idea that he was in a position to put the finishing touches to the match as a whole. Only after he had made a swift job of holing his four-footer for par did Bernhard Langer put him in the picture. 

?You?ve done it!? the European team captain said. 

There was, it has to be said, more than enough excitement for every European who was at Oakland Hills. However, there was no getting away from the fact that the event lacked something from not having the kind of good old-fashioned leaderboard the contest has known up until now. 

Scoreboards apart, the hosting of the 2004 Ryder Cup, along with the crowds who followed it, could not be faulted. American and European supporters alike poured into the closing ceremony. 

Hal Sutton, in a speech which, like his pairing of Phil Mickelson and Tiger Woods, was probably finalised a couple of years ago, thanked his United States team ?for shining brightly?. Bernhard Langer, for his part, talked from the heart of how integrity and sportsmanship had been very much in evidence. ?We took this great game to a new level,? he said. 

With an Irish reel playing in the background, Langer signed off by making mention of how much the Europeans were looking forward to defending their title at the K Club in Dublin in 2006. 

Which raises the question of who will be the underdogs in two years? time. Though Europe have now won four times in the past five starts, they have on each occasion maintained that they were not the favourites. Not only that, but they were able to back up their claim with statistics. Now all that is going to change. 

With this European team having proved beyond doubt that the world rankings count for nothing when the game turns to matchplay, Europe can only be favourites when they turn up at the K Club. It will be a more difficult starting point, maybe, but Europe suddenly have enough in the way of great players to be able to handle it. 

All 12 Europeans at Oakland Hills contributed to the record points tally, with Ian Poulter and Thomas Levet, two admirable team members, coming good on the last afternoon. Sergio Garcia and Lee Westwood were the highest points scorers with 4-1/2 apiece, but on this occasion there is something a little unseemly about highlighting individual results. If ever there was a team effort, this was it. 

When the Americans were asked if they could explain why they had such a poor time of it, Sutton was inclined to put it down to the Europeans? superior putting. As a rule, Europeans will talk longingly of how the Americans are able to hone their putting strokes on uniform greens. 

Woods had a further explanation for an American performance in which he, Mickelson, Davis Love and Jim Furyk picked up only five points out of a possible 18. Woods seemed to feel that to play in a Presidents Cup match one year and a Ryder Cup the next was all too much. 

 ?It?s tough. It takes a lot out of you,? he said. 

Langer, when it was put to him that the Americans in such circumstances could simply be out of gas, was quick to pour scorn on the notion. ?If you can?t get fired up for the Ryder Cup or the Presidents Cup there?s something wrong with you,? he said.

 Kenyan players boycott training

Nairobi: Kenyan officials said on Wednesday they would name a new side to play Namibia in an ICC Intercontinental Cup qualifier this weekend after players boycotted training in a dispute over contracts. 

The players were expected to resume training on Tuesday for the three-day match against Namibia which starts on Friday. But most of the senior players, including Steve Tikolo who announced he had stepped down as the national team skipper, said they would not play unless their contracts were renewed. 

The Kenya Cricket Association (KCA) had offered to extend their contracts, which expire on September 30, for another two months while a new sponsor was found. 

Team manager Ramesh Bhalla said they were disappointed with the stance taken by the players. ?The KCA is very firm on this. We are in the process of selecting a new team altogether. The players should realise they performed very poorly in England.?

 Bucharest: Former Romania international Dan Petrescu said on Friday he had resigned as coach of first division team Sportul Studentesc Bucharest after going five months without pay.

 ?I decided to quit because the club?s managers have failed to pay my wages in the last (five) months,? Petrescu said. ?The club?s financial situation is disastrous and the players have also failed to receive their salaries.?

 Petrescu has left Sportul Studentesc in 10th place in the 16-team championship 14 points behind leaders Steaua Bucharest at the halfway mark in the season.

 London: Dutch striker Patrick Kluivert must score more goals or he will have no long-term future at Newcastle United, manager Graeme Souness was quoted as saying on Friday.

 ?Patrick will be judged on his goals, that?s the price on the ticket if you?re a striker,? Souness said. ?The fact is that we are in the performance business and if you don?t perform, then you?re shown the door,? he added, according to British newspaper reports.

 Kluivert, who joined Newcastle from Barcelona on a free transfer in July, has scored only three goals in 12 Premier League games, one in the last seven.

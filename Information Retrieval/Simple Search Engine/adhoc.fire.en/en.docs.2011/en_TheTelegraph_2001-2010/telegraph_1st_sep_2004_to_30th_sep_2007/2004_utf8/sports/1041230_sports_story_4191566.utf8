 Harbhajan action okay: Hirwani

A STAFF REPORTER

 Narendra Hirwani at the Eden on Wednesday 

Calcutta: Former India leg-spinner Narendra Hirwani, who is in town with the Madhya Pradesh side to play their last Ranji Trophy tie against Bengal, feels that there is nothing wrong with Harbhajan Singh?s action. 

?I think few people who wants to come to the forefront by creating controversies are using him as a scapegoat,? Hirwani said on Wednesday. 

He also reminded that Harbhajan has been cleared by International Cricket Council (ICC) once and it was absolutely pointless to spark the issue once again. 

On Anil Kumble, Hirwani was full of praise and said that the highest Indian wicket-taker in Tests will surely achieve the 500-mark. ?The Indians should play him only in Tests. It will help him to concentrate more on the longer version and stay fit too,? Hirwani stated. 

On their match against Bengal, Hirwani felt that the inclusions of Utpal Chatterjee and Devang Gandhi will strengthen their side but the team will be dangerous because of the presence of Team India captain Sourav Ganguly. ?I know what Dada (Sourav) is capable of doing,? he said.

 Miandad threatens to sue PCB

 Miandad says Shaharyar?s statement has tarnished his image 

Islamabad: Former Pakistan captain and coach 

Javed Miandad has threatened to take legal action against the Pakistan Cricket 

Board if its chairman Shaharyar Khan does not publicly reveal the ?other reasons? 

for his ouster as the coach of the national team. 

The PCB chief had reportedly said on Thursday that Pakistan?s defeat at the hands of India early this year was not the only reason for sacking Miandad. 

Reacting to the remark, Miandad said the statement had badly tarnished his image. 

?This kind of statements from a veteran diplomat and a senior administrator has created a lot of doubts in the mind of cricket followers, my fans and badly tarnished my image,? the former batsman was quoted as saying by the official news agency APP. 

?PCB chairman should make those ?other reasons? public for my ouster as coach of the Pakistan team. He should come out with those other things and reasons. 

?It (the remark) creates an impression in the minds of followers of the game that I could have been involved in betting and match-fixing... And I am considering taking legal action against PCB,? he said. 

Miandad, who was sacked in June following Pakistan?s 

defeat in Tests as well as one-dayers to India at home, said in the context of 

the remark, it was surprising that he had been offered to take up the job of an 

advisor to the team.

 Woods ends year with win 

 - Former world No. 1 beats Padraig Harrington by two strokes 

Thousand Oaks (California): Tiger Woods turned in his most complete round of a difficult year when he closed with a 5-under 66 for a two-shot victory over Padraig Harrington in the Target World Challenge. 

It was Woods? second straight stroke-play title after going without one on the PGA Tour for the first time in his career. 

Woods won the Dunlop Phoenix on the Japanese Tour last month by eight shots. The Target World Challenge is the last of the silly-season events and doesn?t count as an official victory. 

Still, Woods beat an elite 16-man field with a game that is starting to look vaguely familiar. 

?Every shot I wanted to hit, I hit,? said Woods, who missed only two fairways and one green. 

He finished at 16-under 268 and won $1.25 million, which he donated to his foundation. 

Harrington, who held off Woods at Sherwood Country Club two years ago, got into contention with a 31 on the front nine, then kept pace until a couple of errant shots cost him on the final three holes. 

The Irishman hit his approach into a hazard on the par-five 16th, but had a chance to play out toward the green. It went into a bush, he had to knock that out left-handed and wound up with a bogey. 

After a clutch birdie on the 17th to get back within one shot, Harrington drove into rough so thick he had no chance to reach the 18th green. 

He closed with a bogey for a 66, his only consolation a $750,000 check. 

Colin Montgomerie, who had a two-shot lead and was trying to win his first stroke-play title in the US, bogeyed the first hole and never caught up. The Scot shot 71 and finished at 13-under 271 with Jay Haas (69). 

Miguel Angel Jimenez of Spain had a 70 to finish another stroke behind. 

Woods was coming off his worst season on the PGA Tour. His only victory was the match play championship in late February, he failed to seriously contend on the back nine of any major and he lost his No. 1 ranking to Vijai Singh in September outside Boston. 

But the swing changes he began in March appear to be taking hold, and the last month has been proof. 

So was Sunday. Woods had full command of every shot, and there would not have been much drama if he could have made a putt. He missed six birdie chances inside 15 feet, and his longest putt for par was eight feet. 

That might have been the biggest, however. Playing in the group behind Harrington, Woods pulled his 2-iron into a tree next to the 16th green and had to punch into the thick rough guarding the green. 

As he was starting his downswing on a flop shot, a man on the bridge yelled out, ?C?mon Woods!? 

Woods dropped the club in disgust as sheriff?s deputies took the man away. He backed off the par putt, and he and caddie Steve Williams pumped fists when it dropped to protect a two-shot margin. 

Woods insisted he was close to returning to his best form after last month?s victory. ?I?m excited things have started to come together in the last three or four months,? said the 28-year-old Woods. 

?With all the changes I?ve made with my golf swing, it was just a matter of time. I?m excited about my prospects for next year.? he said.

 Sania in line for double crown

 Sania Mirza 

Hyderabad: Continuing her winning streak, rising Indian tennis star Sania Mirza on Friday stormed into the finals of the women?s singles and doubles in the $25,000 ITF women?s tournament being played in Lagos, Nigeria, to set herself in line for a double crown. 

Sania defeated Vasilissa Bardina of Russia 6-4, 6-0 in the semi-final match to stay just a match away from her second successive title, according to information reaching here. 

The 17-year-old Indian lass faced some rough weather in first set against the Russian who could garner four games but then took a firm hold by quickly settling the issue at 6-4. 

The second set turned out to be a no-contest with Sania going on top and blanking her opponent 6-0 to storm into the title-round. 

Last week Sania won a $25,000 title at the same venue. 

Sania?s dream run continued in the doubles event as she paired with Shelly Stevens (New Zealand) to defeat Fernanda Caputi (Brazil) and Mayumi Yamamoto (Japan) 6-4, 7-6 to enter the final on Thursday night. (PTI)

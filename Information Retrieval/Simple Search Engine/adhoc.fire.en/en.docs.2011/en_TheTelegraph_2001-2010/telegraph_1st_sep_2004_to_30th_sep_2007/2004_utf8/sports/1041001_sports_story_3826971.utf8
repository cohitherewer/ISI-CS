Bangalore: Dhiraj Jadhav and Mohammed Kaif scored fine centuries as India A piled on the misery on the hapless India Senior bowlers on the third day of the four-day practice match here on Thursday. 

Jadhav (113) and Kaif (103 not out) put on 155 runs for the third wicket as India A declared their second innings at 297 for five setting the Senior team a target of 387 runs to win. 

 At stumps, the India Senior were 35 without loss in 10 overs with Yuvraj Singh batting on 23 and Virender Sehwag on 12. 

Earlier, resuming at the overnight score of 47 for one, India A lost skipper Dinesh Mongia early when he was caught in the slips by Rahul Dravid off Sidharth Trivedi for 25. 

This brought Kaif to the crease and the Uttar Pradesh player staked his claim for a Test berth as he milked the bowling at will. 

Kaif, who has made no secret of his goal to get into the Test squad, brought up his century with a lofted boundary off Sehwag. His innings came off 194 balls with 12 boundaries and a six. 

Meanwhile, Jadhav also completed his century and hit eleven fours in his 221-ball knock before being adjudged leg before wicket to Anil Kumble. 

The Senior team?s bowlers ? Irfan Pathan (one for 55), Zaheer Khan (one for 31) and Kumble (one for 57) ? struggled to make any impression on the duo with Trivedi turning out to be the most successful bowler, taking two for 52. 

Harbhajan, looking for some useful bowling practice ahead of the first Test against world champions Australia commencing here on October 6, went wicketless in the 20 overs that he bowled. 

 Wicketkeeper-batsman M.S. Dhoni, however, failed for the second time scoring just 12 runs while Wednesday?s bowling hero Joginder Sharma was dismissed on 11. Venugopal Rao (20 not out) was giving Kaif company when Mongia declared the innings. 

Chasing the victory target of 387, Sehwag, desperately looking for a big knock after his recent string of poor scores, started off with a boundary of Shib Shankar Paul and then raised his bat in the direction of John Wright, sitting in the players? stand, who acknowledged it with a smile.

 We can be best in 2007 World Cup: Atapattu 

 - Sri Lankans out to prove themselves in New Zealand 

 Murali should be able to join up for Tests 

Colombo: Sri Lanka captain Marvan Atapattu believes his players are capable of becoming the best one-day International team in time for the 2007 World Cup. 

The skipper wants his players to continue their development on the tour to New Zealand which starts Friday. The visit includes a five-match series of one-dayers followed by two Tests. 

Meanwhile, medium pacer Daryl Tuffey returns to the 12-man New Zealand squad announced for the five-match one-day Internationals, adds AP from Wellington. 

Tuffey, who had last played against the US in the ICC Champions Trophy in England in September, missed tours to Bangladesh and Australia with leg injury. 

Sri Lanka have a 71 percent win ratio under Atapattu, having triumphed in 25 of the 35 matches played since he took over after the 2003 World Cup. That run of success has lifted them into second place in the ICC?s official ODI Championship behind Australia. New Zealand are third. 

?We want to be the number one team in the world,? Atapattu told reporters before the squad flew out on Thursday. ?But we?ll have to work really hard towards that objective. We cannot do that overnight but we can during a set period and the aim is to be there by the 2007 World Cup.? 

Atapattu predicted a tough series, especially after New Zealand?s 1-1 draw with Australia in the recent Chappell-Hadlee Trophy. 

?They are a tough team in their own conditions and, although they don?t have a lot of stars, they have been playing very competitively as a group,? he said. ?They have the advantage of playing at home, but this is also the best time for us to make a mark and prove ourselves in New Zealand. 

?Only (seam bowler) Chaminda Vaas out of the senior players has played much cricket there, so this will be a new experience for us. Fortunately, we have four days of training before our first practice match and then two practice games before the one-day series. 

The squad were blessed by Buddhist monks at Sri Lanka Cricket?s headquarters in Colombo before their flight. They left without spin wizard Muttiah Muralidharan, still recovering after shoulder surgery in August. ?I am pretty confident that he will be available for the Test series,? said Atapattu. ?He says he is getting better day by day and bowled four overs at normal speed on Tuesday. 

?The cricket board is arranging for him to participate in a practice game (on December 27) and when he is ready he can hopefully join us in New Zealand.?

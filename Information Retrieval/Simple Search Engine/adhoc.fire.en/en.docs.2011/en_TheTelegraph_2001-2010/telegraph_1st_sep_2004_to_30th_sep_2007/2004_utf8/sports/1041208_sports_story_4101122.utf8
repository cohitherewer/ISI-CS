 Kidambi in sole lead

Visakhapatnam: International Master Sundararajan Kidambi of PSPB shot into sole lead with a victory over IM Rahul Shetty of Indian Airlines in the fifth round of the 42nd National A chess championship on Tuesday. 

Kidambi took his tally four points out of a possible five. 

With 14 more rounds still to go, Grandmasters Dibyendu Barua, S.S. Ganguly, Sandipan Chanda and IM Neelotpal Das remain close on the heels of the leader with 3.5 points apiece. 

For Kidambi this was the third victory on the trot. 

Barua drew with Neelotpal from a Sicilian game where the former played with white pieces. Barua, infact, played imaginatively to secure the initiative which passed on to the middle game. But a rather speculative pawn sacrifice put brakes on his better prospects. 

Deepan Chakravarthy played a short 17-move draw with Chanda from a Sicilian Schevenengian and so did P. Konguvel against Surya Sekhar, who employed the Sicilian Pelican. 

In other games, D. Harika held Koneru Humpy to a draw, while Sriram Jha did not convert a slightly better position against Abhijit Gupta.

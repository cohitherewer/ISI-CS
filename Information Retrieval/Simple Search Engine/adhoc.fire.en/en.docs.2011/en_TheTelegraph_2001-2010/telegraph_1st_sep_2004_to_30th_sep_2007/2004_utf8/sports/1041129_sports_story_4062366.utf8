Calcutta: South Africa may be going through a transition period after the retirement of a few senior pros in quick succession, and it may also seem that the country?s fast-bowling department has been the hardest-hit. 

But former captain and the fulcrum of the current team?s pace attack, Shaun Pollock believes the future of South Africa?s fast bowling is ?bright? and its legacy is safely ensconced in the hands of upcoming generation. 

The allrounder, who has made it clear that he was enjoying his cricket more than ever in the final phase of his career, feels there has never been any dearth of quality pacers in his country and there?s no need to press the panic button. According to him, retirement of the legendary Allan Donald ?was a blow to the team since it created a vacuum.? 

?But that phase is over and too many young, promising, quality pacers are vying for national berths now,? assured Pollock, 31, while talking to The Telegraph on Sunday. The man with an upright action, who has surpassed Donald as the nation?s leading Test wicket-taker, revealed that the pitch back home had a ?big role? in encouraging youngsters to prefer speed over spin. 

?Pitches in South Africa suit fast bowling and that?s why kids are drawn towards pace bowling,? remarked Pollock, who has so far got 351 wickets in his kitty from 86 Tests. Pollock, incidentally, is on the threshold of reaching a milestone. 

Come Monday and the whole of South Africa will surely be watching whether he can attain 24 runs ? the number he needs to complete the feat of 3000 runs and 300 wickets in Tests.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Fulham snatch point from United

 - PREMIER LEAGUE - Alex Ferguson?s team remains in fourth place 

 Alan Smith put United ahead 

London: A late equaliser from Pape Bouba Diop gave Fulham a 1-1 draw at home to Manchester United on Monday and prevented Alex Ferguson?s team from moving back into to the thick of the Premier League title race. 

United looked set for a fifth straight league win courtesy of a first-half Alan Smith goal before Bouba Diop sent a fierce strike curving past a diving Roy Carroll and just inside the post in the 87th minute. 

United remain in fourth place on 31 points, four behind champions Arsenal and nine behind leaders Chelsea, after the two London clubs drew 2-2 on Sunday. 

?It was a great performance, the football was fantastic but we just never finished them off and when you don?t finish teams off things like that can happen. 

?In fairness it was a fantastic strike but we should have been over the sunrise and away. They huffed and puffed but they were never really any threat to us. 

?The result has destroyed a really good performance by us,? added Ferguson, who said united should have killed Fulham off in the first half. 

?On another day we could have scored five or maybe six.? 

Fulham manager Chris Coleman said: ?They (United) hit the post twice but once they didn?t get the second goal maybe they got a little bit nervous and we grew in confidence. It was a fantastic strike that got us a point at the end. For a big guy he (Diop) has got great technique.? 

Everton are in second place, five points ahead of United, after winning the 200th Merseyside derby 1-0 on Saturday. Fulham move above Birmingham into 14th. 

?The first 45 minutes we were standing off them and they were creating chances,? said Fulham coach Chris Coleman.

?We dug in there and once they didn?t get a second goal they got a bit nervous. We grew in confidence and it was a fantastic strike that got us the point.? 

Played on a crisp London night, the game took time to warm up with Fulham sitting back and United looking to exert some control on the match. 

The match came to life when a Roy Keane drive found one Fulham post around the half hour mark and two minutes later Wayne Rooney hit the other upright. 

United fans did not have to wait long for the breakthrough and it came when Cristiano Ronaldo escaped down the right and found Alan Smith in the penalty area after 33 minutes. 

The England striker?s first shot was blocked, but he scurried back to retrieve the ball with a determined tackle on Sylvain Legwinski, before turning to shoot under Fulham goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar. 

United had the better of the remainder of half and, with Fulham?s usual driving force Steed Malbranque having a poor game, it looked like being a relatively easy night for the visitors. 

But Fulham came out firing after the break and former United striker Andy Cole brushed off the attentions of Rio Ferdinand to fire a shot against the woodwork. Fulham showed endeavour and fight for the remainder of the half but failed to create any real openings. 

However, with three minutes left, Bouba Diop, the man who put Senegal on the soccer map when he scored the winner against France in the 2002 World Cup, stepped up to fire home his spectacular equaliser. (AGENCIES)

 NZC defends players

Auckland: The New Zealand cricket team charged for autographs when they toured England because they were besieged by professional autograph hunters, New Zealand Cricket said on Tuesday. 

NZC?s public affairs manager Steve Addison said the Black Caps had charged for some autographs in response to being besieged by professional autograph hunters who aimed to sell the signed merchandise. 

?There were 20 or 30 of them at a time with caps and cards which were not for personal use so the players got a bit annoyed,? he said. 

Addison did not know how much the Black Caps had charged for their autographs. 

The team toured England earlier this year.

Calcutta: The Consul-General of Japan, K. Shimizu (handicap 12) returned the best score in the first round of the invitee/inter club format in the 175th year celebrations of the Royal Calcutta Golf Club (RCGC), held in association with The Telegraph and presented by Airtel. 

As many as 27 clubs took to the majestic Royal on Saturday and the golf course bared its teeth as most players struggled. Apart from K. Shimizu, no other player bettered his handicap and eventually the deadlock for the runner-up was broken by a count back in which Vikram Singh narrowly beat Binny Mehra of the Royal Montreal Golf Club on the last nine holes. 

The leading club in the two round inter club championship was Royal Montreal Golf Club represented by Ravi Mehra and Binny Mehra. Lying second is the team from Royal Calcutta Golf Club, represented by N.N. Framjee and Vikram Singh. Ashit Luthra and Sharad Mishra and Gaurav Ghosh and Prasan Lohia (both teams from RCGC) are placed third and fourth respectively.

 Tokyo: Japan?s Brazilian coach Zico will be without his interpreter for next month?s World Cup qualifier at home to Singapore after he was sent off in Oman last week. The excitable Kunihiro Suzuki has been given a one-match ban by world soccer?s governing body Fifa after he was ordered from the bench for verbally abusing the match officials during Japan?s 1-0 win.

 Zico was also lucky to escape a sending-off as tempers flared on the bench in the second half of a physical game in Muscat.

 The victory guaranteed Japan a place in the final round of next year?s Asian qualifiers for the 2006 World Cup. The Japan Football Association has yet to appoint a replacement translator for the match against Singapore in Saitama on November 17.

 Madrid: Villarreal?s Brazilian midfielder Marcos Senna has been suspended by Uefa after a positive drugs test in a European game, the Spanish club announced. Villarreal and the player have been invited to present evidence to Uefa?s disciplinary committee. Villarreal said they would not comment on the matter before an expected verdict from the committee on November 11.

 Senna, 28, joined Villarreal from Sao Caetano in Brazil in 2002. He played only 25 games over his first two seasons in Spain but he has been ever-present for Villarreal so far in the league this term.

 He had been included in the squad to play away to Lazio in the Uefa Cup on Thursday but will now not be eligible. The news follows the admission by Chelsea?s Romanian international striker Adrian Mutu this week that he tested positive for cocaine. 

 St Petersburg: Fifa referee Nikalai Ivanov has suffered serious injuries after being attacked near his home in St Petersburg. ?I was attacked by two men as I walked out of my house yesterday morning,? the referee was quoted as saying by Russian media on Thursday.

 He suffered broken ribs, facial injuries and concussion.

 ?On Saturday I was suppose to officiate the (Russian premier league) match between Krylya Sovietov Samara and FK Moscow, but now it?s just not possible for me to do.?

 Local police could not confirm if the attack was soccer related.

 Sydney: Goalkeeper Mark Hickman has announced his retirement from international hockey after Australia?s breakthrough gold medal triumph at this year?s Athens Olympics.

 Hickman, 31, who played 79 times for his country, said in a statement released through Hockey Australia (HA) on Thursday, it was time to move on from the sport. ?I am beginning to move from being an athlete to employment and my aim is to find something that I am as passionate about as I was with the Kookaburras. 

 ?So I am in Spain to finish my masters studies in business and to try to learn some Spanish, as well as enjoying a great country,? Hickman said.

 Sydney: Vanuatu will host the East Asia Pacific (EAP) Cricket Cup next year, the ICC announced on Thursday. The ICC said the EAP Cricket Cup, to be held over a nine-day period in September-October, will act as a ranking event for the EAP affiliate member countries and will form part of the ICC World Cup qualifying series. Six countries will be competing in the EAP Cricket Cup to qualify for the 2007 ICC World Cup in the West Indies. They are Japan, Tonga, Indonesia, Samoa, Cook Islands and Vanuatu.

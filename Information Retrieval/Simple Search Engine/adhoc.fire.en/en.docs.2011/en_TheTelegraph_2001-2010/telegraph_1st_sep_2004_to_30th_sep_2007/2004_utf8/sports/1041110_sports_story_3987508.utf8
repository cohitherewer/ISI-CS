 Mumbai take lead

New Delhi: Mumbai found an unlikely bowling hero in Vinod Kambli whose magic derailed former champions Railways in the Elite A group league encounter of the Ranji Trophy here on Tuesday. 

Rolling his arm only because Avishkar Salvi hurt himself in the second over of the day, Kambli struck with the very second ball from a short run-up to send back Shreyas Khanolkar. 

The former India batsman then dismissed the other overnight batsman Tejinder Pal Singh in his third over to effectively break the back of hosts? batting. Kambli ended up with figures of 8.5-4-15-2. 

Resuming at 111 for three, Railways crumbled to 129 for five and never really recovered from those two telling blows. Though the lower-order showed some resilience, they were eventually bowled out for 284. 

Ajit Agarkar (five for 96) and Sairaj Bahutule (two for 58) clipped the Railways? tail to give the defending champions a 77-run first innings lead. 

At stumps, the visitors were three for no loss with Vinayak Mane on three and Wasim Jaffer yet to open his account. 

In Mohali, Pankaj Dharmani hit 125 to help Punjab score 308 and gain a vital first innings lead of 39 runs against Uttar Pradesh. 

Dharmani, who scored his 17th Ranji century, was instrumental in Punjab gaining the lead as he held fort at one end after the hosts resumed at 221 for seven. He also completed 5,000 runs in process, becoming only the second batsman from Punjab to reach the milestone. 

In their second innings, Uttar Pradesh, who had made 269 in the first knock, were 206 for the loss of two wickets for a lead of 137 runs. Jyoti P Yadav was batting on a strong 82 while Suresh Raina was on 37 at close.

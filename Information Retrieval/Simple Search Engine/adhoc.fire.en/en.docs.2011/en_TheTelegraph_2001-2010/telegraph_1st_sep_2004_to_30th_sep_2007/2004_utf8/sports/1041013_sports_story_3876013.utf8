The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Bengal lose off contested goal

 A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Bengal lost 1-2 by a controversial injury-time goal to Mizoram in the final of the Mir Iqbal Hossain Trophy under-16 football tournament in Goa on Tuesday. 

According to information received here, Mizoram drew first blood in the 12th minute and Bengal equalised in the 22nd minute through Ayub Ali Mondal. 

But in the injury time, Samir Chakraborty made a goalline save and referee carried on with the proceedings. 

Suddenly, one of the assistant referees drew referee?s attention that the ball had crossed the goalline. The referee altered his decision when it was only 30 seconds from the time. 

Bengal coach Ranjit Mukherjee, however, protested but by that time the match was over. According to Mukherjee, Bengal didn?t lose but match offcials denied them victory.

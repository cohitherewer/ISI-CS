 Richardson quits all forms

Wellington: New Zealand opening batsman Mark Richardson retired from all forms of cricket on Tuesday, failing by six runs to reach 10,000 first-class runs in his last representative match. 

Richardson entered the match, between Auckland and Canterbury at Christchurch, needing 41 to reach the career milestone. 

He made 35 in Auckland?s first innings, but could not bat again as his team won by an innings and 60 runs.

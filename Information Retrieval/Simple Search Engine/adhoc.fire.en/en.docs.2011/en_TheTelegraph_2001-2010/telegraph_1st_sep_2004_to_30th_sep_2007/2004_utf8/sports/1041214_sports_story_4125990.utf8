The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Charity match on schedule

Real Madrid will host an all-star ?Game against Poverty? on Tuesday, despite a bomb hoax that ruined Sunday?s league match. Ronaldo and Zinedine Zidane, two of Reals players inolved in organising the match, said the game to fund United Nations development projects would kick off on schedule. Michael Schumacher is expected to take part in the match. 

Entry to the game, between ?Ronaldo and friends versus Zidane and friends?, will be free, but organisers are asking spectators to make a donation to charity at the turnstiles. Italian referee Pierluigi Collina will take charge of the game. (Reuters)

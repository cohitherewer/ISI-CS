 Becks suffers broken rib

Manchester: David Beckham suffered a broken 

rib minutes after scoring England?s second goal in the World Cup qualifying game 

against Wales, team officials said. 

The England captain was taken to hospital for X-rays 

after the 2-0 victory on Saturday at Old Trafford. England team officials initially 

said the Real Madrid star had not suffered a break. But they said later that a 

second X-ray had revealed a hairline fracture. 

Beckham had an eventful final 15 minutes. He curled a trademark 25-metre shot into the top corner of the net for England?s second goal in the 76th minute. 

Minutes later, he was challenged by Wales defender Ben Thatcher and slumped to the ground holding his ribs. After treatment, he carried on playing and, after crashing into the Manchester City defender, was shown the yellow card. 

The caution is his second of the qualifying competition and means he will miss England?s next game in Azerbaijan on Wednesday. 

The injury means he wouldn?t have made it anyway and now his club, Real Madrid, will want to take a look at his injury to decide how long he will be out of action. 

Beckham is no stranger to broken bones. In April 2002, he suffered a break to a metatarsal bone in his left foot that almost cost him a place on England?s World Cup team that year. 

Aldo Duscher, an Argentine defender with Deportivo 

de La Coruna inflicted the injury in a Champions League game. In May last year, 

he broke the scaphoid bone in his right hand between the thumb and wrist after 

England scored a 2-1 victory over South Africa in Durban. (AP)

 Mutu admits positive test

 Mutu not to ask for B sample analysis 

London: Chelsea striker Adrian Mutu has admitted testing positive for cocaine and will not ask for his ?B? sample to be analysed, English players? union chief Gordon Taylor said on Tuesday. 

Mutu?s agent Giovani Becali said in Bucharest that the Romania striker?s test had been carried out on October 1 at the request of new Chelsea coach Jose Mourinho. The 25-year-old now faces a ban of up to two years. 

Taylor, head of the Professional Footballers Association (PFA), told Sky Sports News: ?We had a meeting with him yesterday and there will now be correspondence to the FA and a hearing proceeded with as quickly as possible without the second sample being tested. ?He?s accepted that he did test positive for cocaine ... and so we?ve got to deal with it under the social drugs procedure that we have in line with the FA.? 

Another of Mutu?s agents, Gheorghe Popescu, said on Monday he had been informed by Chelsea of a positive test for a drug that was not performance-enhancing and said Mutu had been ?destroyed? by the news. 

Becali said Mourinho had asked for Mutu to be tested after a Champions League game in September. 

?Mourinho asked for the test after Mutu failed to show up at training soon after the match against Paris Saint Germain, when Mutu was not called (off the bench),? Becali said. 

?The test was held on October 1. I think Mourinho?s decision followed Mutu?s bizarre attitude. 

?Mourinho was fair when he called me to clarify Mutu?s file which (former coach) Claudio Ranieri handed to the Portuguese,? Becali said. 

?There were there a lot of bad things about Mutu. I tried to make Mutu look better but I failed to persuade Mourinho.? 

Mutu?s case comes a year after Chelsea sacked their Australian goalkeeper Mark Bosnich for testing positive for cocaine. The player also picked up a nine-month FA ban. 

Taylor said: ?It is possible for a club to have one of their players tested if they feel there is such problems. 

?Adrian Mutu cost ?15m ($26.91 million) and that?s a great deal of money to write off.?

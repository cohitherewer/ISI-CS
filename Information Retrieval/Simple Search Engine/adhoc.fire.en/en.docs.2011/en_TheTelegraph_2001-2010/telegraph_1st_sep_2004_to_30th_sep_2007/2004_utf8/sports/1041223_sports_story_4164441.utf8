 Latif ban reduced to 1 month

Islamabad: In a major reprieve to Rashid Latif, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has cut short the indefinite suspension slapped on the controversy-prone player to one month after accepting his regrets and explanation. Latif was suspended on December 11 for abandoning a local cricket match in November claiming that the pitch was under-prepared. 

The former captain was captaining the Karachi B team in a local fixture when he asked him team not to play on the ?under-prepared? pitch, which led the PCB to probe the matter and subsequently banning the wicketkeeper-batsman. Latif appealed against the penalty imposed on him stating that proper procedures had not been followed during the inquiry. 

?After reviewing all related issues and considering Rashid Latif?s standing as a former captain, who has made a significant contribution to Pakistan cricket, chairman, PCB has decided to reduce the penalty to one month?s suspension from first-class cricket from the date of the incident,? the release said.

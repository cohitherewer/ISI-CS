The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Pappan keeps lead

 A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Pappan carded a steady level-par 70, and at six-under 134 Wednesday, managed to stay atop the leader-board, giving himself every chance to realise the elusive dream of a first Amby Valley PGAI Tour title win at the Rs 10 lakh South Indian Open being played at the Bangalore Golf Club course. 

One stroke behind Pappan sat the duo of Rafiq Ali and Mohammed Islam, according to information reaching here. Rahul Ganapathy and Digvijay Singh were tied fourth at four-under 136 apiece. 

The cut was applied at eight-over 148, with 53 professionals making it to the deciding rounds. Among the big names to miss the bus was Delhi?s Rohtas Singh. 

?I don?t win? I just lead,? said a smiling Pappan when queried as to how many Amby Valley PGAI Tour wins he had under his belt. 

Today Rafiq began with a par-birdie-bogey-birdie sequence to sit at one-under after four holes. Thereafter he played steady golf and aided by two more birdies on the sixth and eighth, finished the day at three-under 67.

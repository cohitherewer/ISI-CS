 Woolmer flays Miandad

Perth: Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer has dismissed allegations by predecessor Javed Miandad that he had done nothing t o improve the team?s stocks since taking charge six months ago. 

?It?s very disappointing that a senior, very respected cricketer and past coach of the team comes out and criticises the team, the coach and everyone involved... That?s basically what he?s doing and I find that rather disappointing,? the 56-year-old Woolmer said. 

Miandad was quoted in a Pakistani paper as saying Woolmer had yet to settle on a team and was ignorant of Pakistan?s cricketing culture. (AFP)

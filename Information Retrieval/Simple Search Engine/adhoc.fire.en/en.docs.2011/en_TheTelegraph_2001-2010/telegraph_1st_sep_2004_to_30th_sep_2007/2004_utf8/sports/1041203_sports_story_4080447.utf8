 ICC sets January date

 Maurice Odumbe 

Nairobi: International Cricket Council (ICC) officials will meet 10 Kenyan players in January as part of an investigation linked to the Maurice Odumbe inquiry, a lawyer for the cricketers said. 

?We have agreed on a January appointment and I am discussing with my clients which dates would suit them,? Allan Kosgey, who is representing the 10 players, said. 

Former captain Odumbe was banned for five years by the Kenya Cricket Association (KCA) in August for having inappropriate contact with a bookmaker. 

Odumbe?s estranged wife Katherine Maloney alleged during the tribunal that up to six other players were also involved. The ICC Anti-corruption and Security Unit officers arrived in Nairobi on Tuesday to conduct further investigations into players who represented Kenya between 1999 and 2000. 

However, 10 players declined to be interviewed citing short notice. Five of the 10 are playing club cricket in Bangladesh and South Africa. (Reuters)

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 EB fear regional bias in supervision

 A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: The alien topography of Syria might 

become the constricting factor when East Bengal take on Al Jaish Club in their 

away match of the AFC Cup quarter final in Damascus Wednesday. That could put 

the Calcutta club in a slight disadvantageous position. 

The bigger problem, according to team manager and 

doctor Shanti Ranjan Dasgupta could be the referee and the match commissioner. 

?The referee is from Saudi Arabia and the match commissioner from Bahrain, and 

this regional pressure could weigh us down tomorrow,? he said over phone from 

Damascus. 

This will add to the fact that East Bengal had handed over the initiative to the Syrian club following their barren draw at the Salt Lake Stadium on September 15. Those series of missed chances might prove costly for the national champions under lights at the Al Abbasin stadium on the morrow. 

This round, the absence of a quality striker in the red-and-gold ranks too could hurt their cause. With star striker Bhaichung Bhutia injured and the club failing to register Brazilian recruit Roberto Paolo, the onus of finsing the net rests on Bijen Singh, who though has floundered time and again. 

Damascus is a city situated somewhat above sea level and this has added to the Calcutta team?s woes, said the doctor. The air is thinner, he says, pulling at the players? breath. And the Syrians anyway have the advantage of height and built. 

The good news is that the ground is very good, and injuries are healing. ?Goalkeeper Sangram Mukherjee is practically alright, and if not Rajat Ghosh Dastidar is ready to step in. An hour and-a-half?s practise saw the players tend to acclimatise, but temperatures are dipping late evening. 

East Bengal, who want an outright win, could settle for a draw as well, to push the match into tie-breakers. Hence the set-piece move and penalty shootout practice of the team at the ground this evening. East Bengal have picked white jersey for play Wednesday. 

The Syrian team members were present during India?s 

practice, and Indian coach Subhas Bhowmick stayed back to watch the local practice 

after his team had been through its paces.

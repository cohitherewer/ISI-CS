The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Gilchrist rues rain ruining a ?classic? 

 - It was a 50-50 situation... We were off to a good start and could have reached the target: Sourav 

 INDRANIL MAJUMDAR 

 A pensive Sourav Ganguly in Chennai on Monday 

Chennai: Hope gave way to despair and finally to frustration. As overnight rain showed no signs of stopping and the covers stayed on the pitch and its adjoining areas till the match was called off at 1 pm, both sides were left to ponder what might have been. 

?Both teams had reason to be optimistic going into the final day. India may have been slightly in front, but given the fact that it took us almost the entire fourth day to get 219 runs, and that India had to bat on a worn-out pitch, things would have been extremely difficult. Both teams were genuinely in the hunt and, yes, it?s a very, very frustrating way to finish,? said Australia?s stand-in captain Adam Gilchrist. 

Sourav Ganguly echoed him. ?This is something one can hardly do anything about. The players are experienced enough to take it in their stride. It was a 50-50 situation. We were off to a good start and could have reached the target, but it would have meant hard work. It would be unjust to say we would have won it.? 

The rain, which began late last night and continued almost throughout Monday, had left pools of water on the outfield. The washout was least expected after a thrilling fourth day that left the hosts needing another 210 runs for victory. Australia thus kept their 1-0 TVS series lead going into the third and fourth Tests in Nagpur and Mumbai. 

?This Test was shaping up to be a classic. Last night, lying in bed, I was wondering what the outcome would be. But a draw in this manner is frustrating to say the least. There are positives to take away but the negatives have to be addressed too,? Gilchrist explained. 

?We were extremely disappointed with the first innings batting, particularly the second half when we collapsed from 136 for no loss to be all out for 235. That collapse was the biggest disappointment. But then we played very good cricket. We could easily have been intimidated by that collapse and Virender (Sehwag) innings where we could easily have been washed away. But we fought hard and set a target where anyone could have won.? 

While the batting collapse has been one of the negatives (?there are signs of improvement already,? Gilchrist clarified), the catching has also been a setback. Australia, however, were not ruing the dropped chances. ?Yes we missed some chances that proved to be costly. But that can happen to any team. Some days you take chances, some days you miss them. That?s the way it is,? Gilchrist said. The positives have been the way they ?wiped away the deficit of 141 in three good days of cricket.? 

Sourav, too, agreed that the visitors had shown ?lot of character on all the four days?. ?Due credit should be given Damien Martyn and Jason Gillespie, the way they batted. They showed lot of steel.? 

He agreed that this side has shown ?more determination? in their efforts than previous teams that have toured here. ?They have a definite plan. We?ve also accordingly changed ours after the game in Bangalore. When teams come to the sub-continent now, they?re smart in their game plan. Not just Australia, Nasser Hussain?s England also showed similar traits. We?re going to see more of this in the future, too.? 

Gilchrist, however, did not agree with Shane Warne that the six-wicket haul was the world record holder?s best performance against India. ?Certainly not the best in my memory. This may have been statistically better, but in Australia, some five-six years ago, he was dominating them. There the fast bowlers took a few wickets and that may have made his task a bit easier. Nevertheless, this showing here will do his confidence a world of good.? 

The stand-in captain also spoke on his decision to replace Simon Katich at No.3 in the second innings. ?Simon?s achievement has been swept away by a Michael Clarke hundred or a Shane Warne or Harbhajan effort. Simon has been the glue with which our top-order has stuck together. My promotion had nothing to do with his performance, just trying to be proactive in taking the game back to the Indians. Had I survived that (third) night, things could have been hugely different?? 

Gilchrist said they would use the break before the Nagpur game (begins October 26) to ?freshen up?. ?This is good for players, specially after the battle in stifling conditions here. We are letting the boys take time off, relax, and get together two or three days before the Test. It?s a way of ensuring that tired bodies don?t sway results.? 

Kumble?s target 

Anil Kumble, declared MoM for his haul of 13 wickets, later said the team was disappointed but he would try to win the series for his team. ?My next target is taking 500 wickets but right now, I want to win the next two matches for India,? the leg-spinner, who took his tally to 415, said.

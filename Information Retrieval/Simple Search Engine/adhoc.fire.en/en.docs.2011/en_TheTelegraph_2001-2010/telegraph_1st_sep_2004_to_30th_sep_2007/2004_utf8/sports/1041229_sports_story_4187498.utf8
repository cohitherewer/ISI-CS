 Openers give England edge

 Marcus Trescothick sweeps one on way to his century at ngsmead in Durban on Tuesday 

Durban: Marcus Trescothick and Andrew Strauss shared an opening partnership of 273 to earn England the lead and turn the tables in the second Test against South Africa on Tuesday. 

England were 281 for one in their second innings on the third day, 88 ahead, when bad light ended play 11 overs early. 

Andrew Strauss was 132 not out after batting for more than six hours, facing 272 balls and hitting 16 fours. 

South Africa scored 332 in their first innings in reply to England?s total of 139, a lead of 193. 

Trescothick made 132 in almost six hours at the crease in which he faced 261 balls and hit 20 fours and two sixes. 

Trescothick and Strauss? partnership was the fifth-highest in England?s history. 

It was Strauss?s fourth century in his ninth Test and Trescothick?s ninth in his 56th match. 

The pair have now shared four century partnerships and each time they have forged past 150. 

Tuesday?s effort, their highest, also meant Trescothick and Strauss have become the 12th pair of England openers to share 1,000 runs in Tests. 

England resumed on 30 without loss and South Africa were armed with a ball just 11 overs old. 

A violent thunderstorm on Monday night was expected to change the character of the steadily flattening pitch. 

The westerly wind that blew the storm in also provided cloud cover that should have helped the bowlers to swing the ball. 

However, it was soon apparent that the pitch would probably be at its best so far in the match for batting. 

Fast bowlers Makhaya Ntini and Shaun Pollock each began the day with a maiden over, but the batsmen were not tested and were able to settle on their own terms. (Reuters)

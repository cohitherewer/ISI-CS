Madrid: Wasteful Valencia had to settle for a 1-1 draw away to Real Betis on Saturday, while Atletico Madrid missed a chance to move into the top three when they lost 0-1 away to Real Sociedad. 

Valencia, beaten by Werder Bremen in the Champions League in midweek, took the lead in the 10th minute when Marco Di Vaio shot low from the edge of the area but Betis equalised just past the half-hour mark when Edu converted a Ricardo Oliveira cross. 

Atletico Madrid missed the chance to join Barca in joint-second place when they were beaten at Real Sociedad, who claimed their first win of the season thanks to a Darko Kovacevic header five minutes before the break. 

Valencia, missing in-form winger Vicente through injury, nevertheless made a bright start and Stefano Fiore and Miguel Angel Angulo both went close before Di Vaio cut inside and beat Toni Prats with a low shot inside the keeper?s right-hand post. 

In the 31st minute Betis grabbed the equaliser. 

Ruben Baraja, otherwise faultless in midfield, lost the ball and Oliveira took the chance to race clear down the left and cross for the unmarked Edu to turn in at the far post. Betis enjoyed a good spell either side of halftime but Valencia finished more strongly and had ample opportunity to take all three points. 

In Serie A, Lecce?s impressive run of early season results came to an end with a 1-2 defeat by Chievo Verona on Saturday. The win sends Chievo into second place, a point behind leaders Juventus who are at Udinese on Sunday. 

Roberto Baronio fired Chievo into a 48th minute lead with a low shot from an indirect free kick. Simone Tiribocchi made it 2-0 with a scrambled effort from close range in the 79th minute for the home side. Lecce were unable to produce the attacking football that had characterised their recent displays. 

The southerners grabbed a late consolation though with a shot from 20 metres by Serbian Mirko Vucinic.

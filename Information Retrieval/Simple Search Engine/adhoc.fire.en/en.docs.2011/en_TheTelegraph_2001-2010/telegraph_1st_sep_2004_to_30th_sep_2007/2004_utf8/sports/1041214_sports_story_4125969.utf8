 Akram tips for Zaheer 

Dhaka: Legendary left-arm seamer Wasim Akram took time out of his busy schedule as a TV commentator to make a dash to the Indian nets and have a chat with Zaheer Khan and Irfan Pathan. 

Akram has offered his help to the Indian fast bowlers in Melbourne during the tour of Australia. His admiration for Pathan is well known. 

On Monday, Akram paid special attention to Zaheer. Soon after the Indians wrapped up the last two Bangladeshi wickets for an innings and 140-run victory in the first Test at the Bangabandhu National Stadium, Akram spent a few minutes with the Baroda paceman to help him sort out a couple of technicalities. 

The former Pakistan captain was seen stressing on bringing the bowling arm from a high angle and holding the wrist firm to get the swing going. 

It might be noted that in both the Bangladesh innings, it was Pathan who was the wrecker-in-chief, returning with match figures of 11 for 96. 

Zaheer was impressive in his new ball spell but ended up with only three for 111. Crucially, he went for runs in his second spell in both the innings. 

Except for the first Test against Australia in Bangalore, the 25-year old left arm pacer has been on song this season. 

His speed, hovering close to 130 kmph, might need some improvement, but he has gained in control and accuracy. 

Akram had two more attentive pupils listening to him ? Sachin Tendulkar and Gagandeep Singh. 

Gagandeep was enthralled watching Akram at close quarters. 

?What can I say, he is a great bowler,? said the 22-year-old Punjab medium pacer, who remained spellbound through the entire session which lasted about 20 minutes. 

?The game is same, the same bat and ball, the same pitch. But the atmosphere and the spirit in the team is totally different,? said the right arm bowler about the brief time he has spent with the Indian team so far.

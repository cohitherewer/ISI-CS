 Ontong banks on ?unknown? status

 - SA TOUR OF INDIA 

- Boje?s replacement Langeveldt has to undergo fitness test 

 There is no better place for a spinner to bowl than in India, feels Ontong 

Durban: He has bowled just two overs in Test cricket so far and is making a comeback into the South African squad after three years. But spinner Justin Ontong is confident that his ?unknown? status would work in his favour during South Africa?s tour of India this month. 

?I am going to be an unknown factor for the players in India and it will be in my favour,? Ontong was quoted as saying by the local media. 

The 25-year-old Ontong, who made his debut against Australia in 2001 but fell out of favour after just one match, has been working on his leg spinners at the squad?s training base in Pretoria. 

Ontong said that he was encouraged by what he saw on the second day of the ongoing fourth Test between India and Australia in Mumbai and even believed that he could get to bowl with the new ball. 

?I may even get the opportunity to open the bowling. I am looking forward to carrying that responsibility. Let us be honest ? as a spinner there is no better place to bowl than in India. 

?So far this season, I have concentrated on bowling leg spinners because there are more variations. I also like to bowl the occasional away swingers. 

The players standing close to the batsman will have to be alert for catches when I bowl,? he said. 

The South African squad will be leaving for India on November 11 for the two-Test series and was likely to rely on bits and pieces spinners during the tour since the only genuine spinner in the line-up ? Nicky Boje ? has withdrawn and was replaced by medium pacer Charl Langeveldt. 

Langeveldt, however, will have to undergo a fitness test to ascertain whether he will be able to make the trip. 

It has been found that Langeveldt was suffering from a back injury and would have to undergo a fitness test soon to decide whether he would travel to India, United Cricket Board of South Africa spokesman Gerald de Kock was quoted as saying by the local media here. 

?He will undergo tests to see how serious the injury is,? De Kock said, adding no replacement had yet been decided upon if Langeveldt was ruled out of the tour. 

Meanwhile, batsman Jacques Rudolph was also suffering from a back spasm and the South African camp was concerned that he might not be able to bowl his slow deliveries in India. 

Rudolph is not experiencing any problems with his batting but is uncomfortable with his bowling routine, reports said.

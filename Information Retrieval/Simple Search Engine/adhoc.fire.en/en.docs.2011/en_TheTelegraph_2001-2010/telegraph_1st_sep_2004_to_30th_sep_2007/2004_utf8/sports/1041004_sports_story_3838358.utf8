 Brussels: Kim Clijsters will be out of action for the rest of the season but does not need more surgery on her wrist after suffering an injury in the Belgian Open.

 Clijsters official website said on Sunday that doctors had reassured her the new injury was not as serious as the last one. Her surgeon said the old condition had completely healed and she was suffering from a new problem in the same area.

 Clijsters quit her semi-final against Russias Elena Bovina midway through the second set on Saturday when she felt pain on her problematic left wrist. The former world No. 1 was playing her first tournament for almost five months after suffering torn tendons and having surgery on the wrist to remove a cyst. Clijsters has been advised to ice the wrist and have anti-inflammatory treatment. 

 Berlin: Scotland coach Berti Vogts will return to Germany after his contract with the British side ends, he said on Sunday.

 ?At the end of my contract I will have been abroad for long enough. I want to work in Germany again, in whatever position I can,? Vogts told Germany?s Bild am Sonntag newspaper.

 Vogts said his contract with Scotland would end after the 2006 World Cup in Germany or, if the team does not qualify, in December 2005. Scotland are fourth in European qualifying Group V after a 0-0 draw with Slovenia last month. They play Norway in their next qualifying match on October 9. 

 London: American multi-millionaire Malcolm Glazer is poised to launch a takeover bid for Manchester United, press reports said on Sunday.

 The 75-year-old businessman, who already owns the Tampa Bay Buccaneers American football franchise, currently holds a 19.2 percent stake in the club.

 Glazer has not gone public on any takeover bid he might have, but the Daily Star on Sunday quoted top banker Mehmet Dalman, who has helped Glazer snap up his existing United shares as saying: ?The Glazer family are interested in having a major involvement in United.?

 London: Southampton?s James Beattie will be out of action for at least a month after suffering a toe injury, the Premier League club said.

 The England striker had to come off early during Southampton?s 0-0 draw with Manchester City on Saturday because of a suspected fractured left toe.

 Coach Steve Wigley, quoted on Southampton?s official website, said it was immaterial whether or not the toe was broken.

 ?I know from my own experience that it is going to be very painful for at least four or five weeks regardless of whether it is actually broken,? Wigley said. ?Of course it is a big blow to us that he is going to be out for a while. We can not afford to lose an international striker of his calibre.? 

 Verona: Judith Arndt of Germany took the gold medal in the Elite women?s road race at the UCI world championships on Saturday, after winning the time trial silver medal on Tuesday.

 Arndt won the road race with a well-timed attack on the descent of the final lap just six km from the finish. She powered clear to win alone, 10 seconds ahead of Italy?s Tatiana Guderzo.

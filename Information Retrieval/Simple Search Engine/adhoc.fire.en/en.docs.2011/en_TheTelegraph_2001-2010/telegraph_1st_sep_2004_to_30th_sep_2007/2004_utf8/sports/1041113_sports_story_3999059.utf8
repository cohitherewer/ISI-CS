 Armstrong wants to drive F1 car

London: Six-times Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong said he would love to drive a Formula One car after he and Australian racer Mark Webber trained together. 

?He said he wanted to drive the car himself rather than be a passenger,? Webber, who has his first test with Williams on November 24 after moving from Jaguar, told the BMW-powered team?s website on Friday. ?I told him I wasn?t sure if it was possible but I?d look into it.? 

Webber, who is a keen cyclist and fan of Armstrong?s, flew over to Texas for a training camp with the US rider after the season-ending Brazilian Grand Prix last month. 

?As everyone knows, Lance is a phenomenally fit guy and it was amazing to be cycling alongside him and chatting, although my breaths soon got shorter and shorter, as did my answers to his questions,? said Webber. (Reuters)

 New Delhi: Virender Sehwag celebrated a quiet birthday with family and friends at his residence on Wednesday. The cricketer, who turned 26 on this day, preferred to keep it a private affair even as close relatives and friends dropped in to convey their good wishes. Sehwag, who marked his return to form with a knock of 155 in the Chennai Test against Australia last week, will spend three more days in the capital before joining his teammates in Nagpur where the third Test is slated to begin on Tuesday. The aggressive batsman, who holds the record for the highest individual Test score by an Indian, has made 2157 runs at an average of 53.92 in 25 Tests. His one-day aggregate reads 3008 runs at an average of 32. 

 London: British F1 driver Jenson Button should stay at BAR next season after a tribunal backed the team in a contract dispute with rivals Williams on Wednesday. 

 A Williams spokesman confirmed that the Contract Recognition Board decided in BAR?s favour.

 Button, 24, had agreed to return to Williams, the team with which he made his debut in 2000. He has raced this season for BAR, second in the constructors? championship, who want to retain him for 2005 as well. 

 New York: Laila Ali will not fight Jacqui Frazier in Kinshasa on the 30th anniversary of the ?Rumble in the Jungle?, the boxer?s manager said on Tuesday. ?It?s absolutely false,? Ali?s promoter and husband Johnny McClain said. ?This guy called me a couple of times and I told him to send me a proposal and we?ll talk about it.

 ?He sent me this insulting proposal and I kindly e-mailed him back and said ?no, thank you?. I told him he would have to get his numbers up immensely until we would even consider it. That was the last I heard of it until it resurfaced just recently and people started calling me and I?m getting all these e-mails.?

 The proposed bout would have been on October 30 to commemorate one of boxing?s hallmark moments.

 Vijai scores one over Tiger

 Vijai Singh eclipsed Woods as the Tour?s record money winner in a single season 

London: World No.1 Vijai Singh, already established as the game?s most dominant player, appears to be getting even better. 

The Fijian?s one-shot victory at the Pennsylvania Classic on Sunday was his eighth of the year, and fifth in his last six PGA starts. 

The purple patch produced by Tiger Woods in 2000 ? when he won nine times in 20 tournaments ? is widely regarded as one of the most dominant runs in golfing history but Singh?s scintillating form this season is not far behind. 

Having officially deposed Woods as golf?s top-ranked player three weeks ago, US PGA champion Singh has now eclipsed Woods as the Tour?s record money winner in a single season. 

His winner?s cheque for $ 756,000 lifted his 2004 earnings to $ 9,455,566 from 26 events, breaking the previous mark of $ 9,188,321 set by Woods in 2000. 

The 41-year-old?s remarkable run of form, which dates back to last August, owes much to his astonishing work ethic and a burning desire to be the game?s number one. ?It?s ridiculous the way he?s playing right now,? Chris DiMarco said after tying for third on Sunday. 

DiMarco strung together rounds of 70, 65, 71 and 70, but was no match for the dominant Singh, who leads the 2004 PGA Tour in stroke average (68.92), total birdies (420) and greens in regulation (72.8 percent). 

The three-time major winner plans to play in four more events by the end of the year and has every chance of becoming the first player in tour history to break the $10 million barrier in a single season. 

?I?m going to try,? said the workaholic Singh. ?I?m enjoying the ride right now, and I?m feeling really confident in my game. I?m really looking forward to going out there. 

?I just hope this doesn?t get old, because I love it. I feel really into it right now. Going out there I feel good and I don?t want to hit a bad shot. If I keep winning, I?m going to stay up there and that?s my goal right now. If I keep doing that, everything will take care of itself.? 

A feature of Singh?s play this year has been his fairway brilliance and ability to find greens in regulation, giving himself almost unlimited opportunity to make birdie. He has managed this despite languishing 145th in the tour?s driving accuracy standings, with an average percentage of 60.6. 

?Mentally I?ve always said I know what I?m doing out there,? he said. ?If I know where my focus is, I?m okay. When I?m swinging well, I feel like I?m thinking very well, and that?s what happened this year. 

?I?m playing well and I?m not going to back off. I?m going to try to come out and win a few more events by the end of the year. If I do it, that?s another story but I?m going to be trying.? 

Singh?s game was impressive last year when he won four times on the PGA Tour but he has reached new heights in 2004. 

He completed a run of 12 consecutive top-10 finishes on tour with victory at the Pebble Beach National Pro-Am in February, and has since added a further seven titles. The high point, though, came in last month?s US PGA Championship at Whistling Straits where he clinched his third major title in a playoff.

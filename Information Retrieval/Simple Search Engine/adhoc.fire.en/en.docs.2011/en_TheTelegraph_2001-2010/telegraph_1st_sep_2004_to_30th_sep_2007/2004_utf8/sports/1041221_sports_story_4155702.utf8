The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Now, Harbhajan?s doosra is suspect

 London: Harbhajan Singh 

 has been reported for suspect bowling action, International 

 Cricket Council said here on Monday. ?Indian spin bowler 

 Harbhajan Singh has been reported for a suspected illegal 

 bowling action following concern over his doosra delivery 

 which spins away from the right-handed batsmen,? ICC said 

 in a release on its official website. 

 [Harbhajan, it may be recalled, 

 had his action questioned back in 1998. In fact, that became 

 public after he was picked for the inaugural ICC Knock-Out 

 meet (Dhaka) and he had to be replaced by Nikhil Chopra, 

 adds Our Special Correspondent in Calcutta. 

The offie was sent to England for remedial work with Fred Titmus. He was accompanied on that trip by the then Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) executive secretary Sharad Diwadkar. 

 Incidentally, the BCCI had no 

 immediate reaction, but The Telegraph learns that 

 a couple of former top-bracket spinners could be asked to 

 give their opinion before its response is made known.] 

The report was made by the on-field umpires, Aleem Dar and Mark Benson, TV umpire Mahbubur Rahman, and ICC Match Referee, Chris Broad, after watching Harbhajan?s action during the second Test against Bangladesh in Chittagong, it said. 

?Having closely reviewed the action Harbhajan employs during this delivery, the match officials decided to report the bowler to the ICC and, in line with the protocol, notified the India team management of this course of action,? the release quoted ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed as saying. 

Harbhajan is the sixth player to be reported to the ICC under its revised process to deal with potentially flawed actions in 2004. 

Pakistan pacer Shabbir Ahmed, Sri Lankan off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan, Blessing Mahwire of Zimbabwe and Abdur Razzaq of Bangladesh have all had their actions reviewed and undergone remedial work to address concerns identified by members of the Elite panel of ICC umpires and Referees this year. 

 A report on the action of Pakistani off-spinner Shoaib 

 Malik is due to be received by the ICC later this week. 

 ?This issue now comes under the ICC?s bowling review 

 regulations which stipulate that over the next six weeks 

 an expert biomechanist from the ICC?s approved list should 

 be appointed by the BCCI to work with the bowler to clearly 

 identify and address any flaws that may occur during the 

 delivery action.? 

Pointing out that the report would be dealt in the similar manner as the earlier cases, Speed said ?all bowlers? actions are scrutinised and the match officials are empowered to make a report where they have concerns.? 

?Every bowler is treated in the same way by the ICC and this report is no different from the five others that have been received in the past 12 months. 

?Harbhajan Singh will now work with an expert team over the next six weeks to address these concerns. He can continue to play international cricket and cannot be reported again during this period. 

?At the end of that time the ICC will be provided with a specialist report on the remedial action, if any is required, that has taken place. This report will be circulated to the Elite panel of ICC umpires and Referees for their information.? 

 The recommendations, supported by the members of the 

 ICC?s cricket committee chaired by former Indian captain 

 Sunil Gavaskar, would come up for discussion on February 

 3-4, 2005 at the ICC chief executives? committee meeting 

 in Melbourne. (PTI)

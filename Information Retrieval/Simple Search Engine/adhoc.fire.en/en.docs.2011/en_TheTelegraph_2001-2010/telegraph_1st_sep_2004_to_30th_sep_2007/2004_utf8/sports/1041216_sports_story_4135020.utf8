 Pace is key on lively track

Perth: Pakistan and Australia are poised for an explosive bowling duel in the first Test starting here on Thursday, with both teams declaring they have the artillery to bombard the other into submission. 

Pakistan will go all out to attack Australia?s batting using four specialist bowlers spearheaded by the world?s fastest in Shoaib Akhtar on a lively wicket at the Western Australian Cricket Association ground. 

Although Pakistan?s starting line-up will not be confirmed until the morning, captain Inzamam-ul Haq said three pace bowlers would be used with leg-spinner Kaneria. 

Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Sami will open with either left-arm quick Mohammed Khalil or medium-pacer Rana Naved-ul Hasan to start in support. 

?I think we will go with four specialist bowlers,? Inzamam confirmed Wednesday on the eve of the first match in the three-Test series. 

When asked if Danish was a certain starter, Inzamam replied: ?Definitely.? 

Australia are in a similar position, with captain Ricky Ponting saying pacer Brett Lee still had a strong chance to be included in the starting line-up, despite earlier suggestions that he would be the 12th man. 

He said hot weather in Perth on Tuesday and Wednesday could have affected the wicket and would possibly influence the selectors? final choice. 

?He?s (Lee) right in the mix,? Ponting said. 

?It would be nice if we could have that showdown that everyone is looking for I guess ? the Pakistani fast bowlers against all of our fast bowlers and how each batting side is going to react to that.? 

Ponting said Shoaib was unquestionably the fastest bowler he had ever faced but it would be a mistake for Australia to put too much focus on him. ?Sami is the other one we can?t forget about. He?s a very good new ball bowler ? he?s as quick as Shoaib and he?ll make it very difficult for us to bat against him as well.

break from nets at the WACA

While the WACA wicket is not a favourite hunting ground for spin bowlers, both captains remained adamant that they would be included in their starting side. 

Shane Warne has a remarkable record against Pakistan, taking 76 wickets in 12 Tests at an average of 18.60, although the pace-friendly WACA is his least successful venue anywhere in Australia. 

But Ponting said it would not be feasible to leave him out of the side and if Australia opted to start with four pace bowlers they would omit a batsman instead. 

Ponting said Australian opener Justin Langer, who captained Western Australia in their 10-wicket win over Pakistan, had pointed out to him that 16 of the tourists? wickets were caught behind. 

?That sort of says to me they haven?t adjusted to the Perth conditions yet? he said. 

But Inzamam said the tourists were young and faced a steep learning curve in Australia. ?Definitely there were some mistakes, we were chasing the wrong balls,? he said. ?But I think they have learned a lot in the last 16 or 17 days ? hopefully they will in the Tests.?

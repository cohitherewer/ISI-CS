The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Strong start by Paes-Rikl 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Leander Paes and David Rikl made an impressive start to their $680,000 Vienna ATP meet campaign on Tuesday. According to information received here, the second seeds saw off Americans Taylor Dent and Robbie Ginepri 6-4, 6-3 in the first round. 

This is an important event for Paes and Rikl who are desperately seeking points to ensure a slot in the year-ending Masters Cup meet in Houston. Going into the Vienna meet, the Indo-Czech pair had 337 points and were No. 10 on the team list. Only eight teams will qualify for the Houston event, scheduled from November 13-21. 

After Vienna, Paes and Rikl will get three more weeks to accumulate enough points to push them to the top-eight. 

Mahesh Bhupathi, in a relatively better position with Max Mirnyi (407 points, sixth place), is playing with Jonas Bjorkman this week at the $1 million Kremlin Cup in Moscow.

 Move afoot to enforce quota of ?home-grown? players

 - TOP CLUBS FEAR UEFA PLAN 

MIHIR BOSE 

 Chelsea have spent almost ?200 million on imported talent since Roman Abramovich bought the club 

Top Premiership clubs such as Chelsea and Arsenal may be forced into a radical overhaul of their squads and transfer policy next summer if Uefa pushes through new rules to enforce quotas of ?home-grown? players next season. 

The Uefa executive will meet in Vienna on November 11 to finalise plans, which would force all clubs in Europe to have between six and eight players in their squad who are ?home-grown?. 

The criteria for this will not be based on nationality, but on whether a player was developed at any academy in this country. 

Uefa are aware that top clubs would try to get around the rule by increasing their squad size, and another radical rule would limit squad sizes to 25 registered professionals. This will force the bigger clubs to drastically cut down the number of players in their first-team squads. 

Chelsea ? who have spent almost ?200 million on mostly imported talent since Roman Abramovich bought the club 18 months ago ? are known to be opposed to the plan. Manchester United and Arsenal ? members of the powerful G14 group of top European clubs ? are also thought to be against it. 

But Uefa are confident they can push their plan through with the support of smaller clubs largely because they do not need European Commission approval. 

The criteria for specifying who is ?home-grown? are not based around nationality so there is no breach of Treaty of Rome, which stipulates that any rule that seeks to limit the right of clubs to employ a player from another EU country would be illegal. 

The G14 would therefore have no legal grounds for objecting. If Uefa?s plans go through, then European football would be changed as dramatically as it was by the Bosman ruling a decade ago. 

The Bosman ruling rendered old Uefa restrictions on hiring European Union players illegal. Ever since, Uefa have watched with alarm as the top clubs of Europe have filled their teams with imports, with clubs like Chelsea fielding a team without a single player qualified to play for England. 

Four weeks ago the plan was debated at the Club Forum held in Uefa headquarters in Nyon. Over 100 clubs were present including representatives of all the big Premiership clubs, including Peter Kenyon, chief executive of Chelsea, David Gill, chief executive of Manchester United, David Dein, vice-chairman of Arsenal and Rick Parry, chief executive of Liverpool. 

The debate was lively with the bigger clubs mostly opposing the plan. However Uefa drew comfort from the fact that the smaller clubs welcomed the idea and that even some of the bigger European clubs, struggling in the shadow of the riches available to clubs like Chelsea, have privately expressed their support for the plan to Uefa. In the long term, it could help Europe?s less affluent clubs hang on to promising players that would otherwise be poached by wealthy rivals in England, Spain and Italy. 

The executive are alarmed by the increasing disparity in European football, both between the ?haves? of some northern and southern European clubs and the ?have-nots? of eastern Europe, whose best players since Bosman are regularly enticed abroad. THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

Calcutta: According to The Telegraph?s sources, 1983 World Cupper Yashpal Sharma has emerged the frontrunner to replace Kirti Azad (North Zone) on the senior national selection committee. 

Apparently, chief selector Syed Kirmani (South) too is going to be replaced, with his berth going to either Chamundi or V.B. Chandrasekhar. In any case, the term of Central?s Sanjay Jagdale is over and Gopal Sharma is expected to succeed him. 

East?s Pranab Roy and Kiran More (West) will continue.

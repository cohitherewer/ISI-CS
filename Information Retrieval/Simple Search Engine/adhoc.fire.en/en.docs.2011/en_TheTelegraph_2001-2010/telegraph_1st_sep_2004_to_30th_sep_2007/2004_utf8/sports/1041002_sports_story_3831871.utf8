 New Delhi: India slipped one place to be joint sixth after the halfway mark of the World Cup golf qualifiers being played at Palm Resort Golf and Country Club in Senai, Malaysia. According to information received here, Myanmar (two-round aggregate 135) shot into the lead with a three-under par 69 in the second round foursomes. Chinese Taipei were second after a one-under 71.

 The Indian team of Rahil Gangjee and Amandeep Johl, who had shot 67 in the opening round, managed 74 in the second for a tally of 141. Sharing sixth place with India were Korea (represented by Kim Dae-Sub and Syong-Jin) who returned a similar score in the second round. The top three finishers will qualify for the world championship, to be held in November in Seville. 

 Bologna: Italian sports doctor Michele Ferrari has been handed a one-year suspended jail sentence after being found guilty of ?sporting fraud? in a cycling doping case. Ferrari, who has worked with six-time Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong, was also found guilty of illegally acting as a pharmacist. Ferrari also received a 900-euro fine and was barred from acting as a doctor for 11 months and 21 days by Bologna judge Maurizio Passerini.

 Mexico City: Volatile Mexican striker Cuauhtemoc Blanco has been handed an opportunity to end a 20-month international exile after he was named in the squad for three World Cup qualifiers. Blanco earned his place in the national squad after inspiring his new club Veracruz to seven successive wins in the Mexican championship ? an unprecedented run for the normally unfashionable outfit. He appeared in Mexico?s first two games under coach Ricardo La Volpe in February last year but has not played for them since.

 He missed several games as La Volpe experimented with new faces before being included in the squad for a friendly with Costa Rica in March, only to pull out through injury. He also pulled out of a trip to Dallas to face the United States in a friendly in April and then withdrew from the World Cup qualifiers against Dominica in August. 

 London: Leicester City have placed former England centre-back Martin Keown on the transfer list. The 38-year-old has made only nine appearances for the second division club following his arrival on a free transfer from champions Arsenal in July. 

 ?We have decided it is in the best interests of both parties if Martin is free to find another club,? a Leicester spokesman said. ?Unfortunately we are not in a position to guarantee Martin regular first-team football.? On their official website Leicester, who were relegated from the Premier League last season and lie 10th in division II, denied newspaper reports that Keown had been sacked and said he would continue to train with the club. 

 Dublin: South Africa, New Zealand and Japan have expressed interest in hosting the 2011 rugby World Cup, the International Rugby Board said on Friday. The IRB will make a final decision in November 2005 on who will host the event. South Africa?s bid, however, has already run into trouble with their government, mindful of the cost in hosting the 2010 soccer World Cup, confirming they were yet to endorse it.

 Sao Paulo: Brazil set off for the midweek friendly in Germany without Ronaldo on Sunday after he was given permission to stay behind for an engagement dinner with his girlfriend, model Daniella Cicarelli.

 He has an engagement dinner, Ronaldos spokesman Rodrigo Paiva told reporters. He asked the coaching staff for permission, the coaching staff thought the players would not mind and they gave him the night off.

 Brazil headed straight for Sao Paulo airport after their 3-1 World Cup qualifying win over Bolivia on Sunday. They face Germany in a friendly in Berlin on Wednesday.

 Sao Paulo: Triple French Open champion Gustavo Kuerten will undergo another operation on his injured hip in the coming weeks, the O Estado de Sao Paulo newspaper reported. Kuerten underwent surgery on the same hip in February 2002 but has since struggled to regain the form which took him to the world No. 1 spot as well as his three Roland Garros titles.

 The Brazilian star lost to Kristian Pless of Denmark in the first round of the on-going US Open. 

 Moscow: Russia and the United States revived a cold war tradition when their teams met for the Russias Challenge track-and-field meet in Moscow, the first time a one-on-one meet has been held since 1982.

 Russia prevailed in 11 of 15 events to win by 236 points to 182, but Sundays match, which was expected to be a rematch of the Olympic track-and-field competition, was overshadowed by the school hostage crisis that ended in southern Russia on Friday with more than 350 people dead, many of them children.

 Sundays competition recalled meets that pitted the superpowers against each other from the 1950s until the 1980s, in events dubbed the match of the giants or match of the continents.

 Sydney: The tri-nations championship involving Australia, New Zealand and South Africa will be expanded from six to nine matches from 2006, the governing body, Sanzar, said on Monday.

 The Super 12 competition featuring the top provincial sides from the three southern hemisphere giants will be increased to 14 teams with two new regional sides from Australia and South Africa.

 Under the current tri-nations format, the three countries play each other once at home and once away each season. 

 From 2006, they will play a third match against each other with the venue rotating on a yearly basis.

 Beijing: Beijing Olympic organisers are seeking ways to cut up to six billion yuan ($724 million) off the cost of building Games venues, including possibly moving the equestrian events to Hong Kong.

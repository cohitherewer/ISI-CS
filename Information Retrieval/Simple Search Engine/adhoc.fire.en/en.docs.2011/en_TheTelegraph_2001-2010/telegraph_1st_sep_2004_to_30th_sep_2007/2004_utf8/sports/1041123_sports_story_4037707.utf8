 Lexington (Kentucky): Serena Williams and Anna Kournikova defeated Venus Williams and Brenda Schultz-McCarthy 6-3 in the Lexus tennis challenge at Rupp Arena. Venus had beaten Kournikova 6-3, 6-2 in a singles match during the exhibition on Sunday, which raised money for several charities. Kournikova dropped four straight games to lose the first set before taking a brief lead in the second.

 In the second set, Kournikova handed over her racket to a fan, giving him a chance to return Venus? powerful serve. The fan swung and missed.

 The event benefited several charities, including the Owl Foundation, a charity founded by Serena and Venus? mother, Oracene Price.

 Kiawah Island (South Carolina): Britain?s Colin Montgomerie lost to an American for the first time in match play singles as the US beat the Rest of the World 14-10 to retain the UBS Cup on Sunday. The seven-time European No. 1 went down 5 and 3 to 1992 US Masters champion Fred Couples. Led by Arnold Palmer, the Americans won 7-1/2 points out of a possible 12 in the last-day singles at Cassique Golf Club after leading overnight by 6-1/2 to 5-1/2. The Rest of the World team has never won the Ryder Cup-style event for golfers aged over 40 since it was first held in 2001. 

 Stockholm: Barcelona striker Henrik Larsson could miss the remainder of the season after tearing the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee, the Spanish club said on Monday. The extent of the injury was revealed by keyhole surgery performed by club doctors on the Swedish striker?s knee on Monday to repair cartilage damage sustained during Sunday?s Primera Liga victory over Real Madrid. Barcelona?s official website said Larsson had asked for any surgery on the torn ligament to be postponed, making it difficult to estimate how long the 33-year-old player would be out of action. 

 Istanbul: A 16-year-old Turkish soccer fan was stabbed to death during a fight between Besiktas fans at half-time of the team?s match against Rizespor, reports said.

 There was no immediate word on the cause of Sunday?s brawl at the Inonu Stadium, which the Anatolia News Agency said occurred between two groups of Besiktas at half-time, when Rizespor was leading 1-0. The match ended 2-2. Cihat Aktas was stabbed during the fight and died at a local hospital. 

 Rio de Janeiro: Atletico Paranaense striker Washington wrote another chapter in the story of his remarkable comeback from heart surgery on Sunday as he scored twice to break the Brazilian championship goal-scoring record. Washington took his tally to 32 goals, one more than Dimba?s record last year, and gave Paranaense a 3-2 win at his old club Ponte Preta to keep them top of the championship.

 Zagreb: Dinamo Zagreb have appointed Ilija Loncarevic as their third coach this season after Nenad Gracan stepped down following a 2-4 loss to Rijeka on Saturday.

 Loncarevic, who has coached Dinamo twice in the past five years, told the Jutarnji List daily newspaper he had signed a two-year contract.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 SA likely to name Amla 

Durban: South Africa?s promising youngster Hashim Amla is all set to become the first cricketer of Indian origin to make it to the national side. 

The 21-year-old, who is the captain of the Kwazulu-Natal provincial team, is almost certain to be picked for the two-Test tour of India beginning on November 14. 

Amla has staked a strong claim for selection, scoring four centuries over the past few weeks. Last weekend he notched up 115 runs in an inter-provincial match for his Natal team against Eastern Cape in Port Elizabeth. A week ago he scored a century against Western Province in a home game in Kingsmead. 

Earlier, he had scored two centuries against New Zealand A team that visited the country recently. 

Convenor of selectors Omar Henry said on Tuesday that there was no doubt that a number of younger player, including Amla, had been knocking on the door of selection for quite some time. 

?It?s pleasing to see that younger players are coming through,? said Henry.

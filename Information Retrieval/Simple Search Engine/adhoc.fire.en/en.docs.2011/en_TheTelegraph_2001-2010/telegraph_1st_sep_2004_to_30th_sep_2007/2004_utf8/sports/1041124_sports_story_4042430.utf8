The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Greg?s free advice for NZ

Wellington: The New Zealand cricket team has found an unexpected ally after its first Test battering by Australia in Brisbane. 

Former Australian captain Greg Chappell, a villain in New Zealand after his involvement in the 1981 ?underarm? controversy, has offered to advise New Zealand?s batsmen, free of charge. 

Chappell told Wellington?s Dominion-Post newspaper he was disappointed with the attitude of New Zealand?s top batsmen in Brisbane and was willing to help the Black Caps change their ?flawed? batting plan. 

New Zealand collapsed in their second innings at the Gabba to be all out for 76, losing the first of two Tests by an innings and 156 runs. 

Chappell criticised the negative mind-set of New Zealand batsmen. 

?They are trying to occupy the crease but the problem with that is you lose the reason to bat,? he told the newspaper in comments published on Tuesday. 

?The reason you bat is to score runs and what I detected with some guys, and Craig McMillan is probably the best example, is that he is not then playing his natural game.? 

?When you go out to survive, you get into a defensive mentality, and against the likes of McGrath, Gillespie and Warne you just become sitting ducks.? 

Chappell said he would not help batsmen with any individual technical deficiencies but was willing to talk ?game ideas? with the visiting batsmen, if asked by coach John Bracewell or New Zealand Cricket. 

?I?m not looking for a paid job. I?d just be more than happy to sit down and have a chat to the batsmen,? he said. 

Chappell said New Zealand?s batsmen were technically ?ok? but paid the price for a negative approach. 

?The art of batting is like walking a tightrope and New Zealand are not walking it very well at the moment ? they have to rethink their strategy,? he said. ?My approach to batting was always about putting pressure back on the bowler. 

?First you soak up the pressure then you make him feel it and make him change his line and length. Next thing the opposition is forced to change their field and all of a sudden you?re on top.? (AFP)

London: England will meet Australia in next week?s Champions Trophy semi-finals after heavy rain in Southampton gave them a 49-run win over Sri Lanka under the Duckworth/Lewis method in their pool D decider on Saturday. 

Andrew Flintoff struck 104 to steer England to 251 for seven before taking two key wickets to help reduce Sri Lanka to 95 for five in the 24th over, when rain ended play for the day to send England through. 

The match had already spilled over from Friday when only 32 overs were bowled during England innings before heavy showers forced an early end of proceedings. 

One-day Player of the Year Flintoff, not out on 21 overnight, smashed three sixes in his third one-day hundred before perishing in the final over when he dragged a Chaminda Vaas slower ball on to his stumps. 

Fellow allrounder Paul Collingwood also contributed a useful 39 in a 94-run fifth wicket partnership before Mahela Jayawardene caught him on the boundary. 

In Sri Lanka?s reply, Steve Harmison had Avishka Gunawardene and captain Maravan Atapattu both caught behind with two searing deliveries before Flintoff tempted Sanath Jayasuriya (27) to drive on the up to Darren Gough at mid-off. Saman Jayantha then edged Flintoff to ?keeper Geraint Jones and slow left armer Ashley Giles took a juggling caught-and-bowled chance to dismiss Jayawardene before the weather brought an end to proceedings.

 Shoaib won?t shorten run-up

Sydney: Speedster Shoaib Akhtar has refused to shorten his run-up as suggested by his captain and coach following Pakistan?s sluggish over-rate in the first Test against Australia. 

?We?re going to go through our overs quickly. We talked about it. I?m not going to change, but I?m going to go back to my run-up quickly,? said Shoaib, who runs 40 yards before each delivery. 

Shoaib tried to explain his stance by drawing a parallel with a jet plane. 

?I?ll ask you a question. Can a plane take off without a run-up? No. Likewise I too need to take a run-up. It?s how I generate my pace and everything flows into the right action. I?m not going to cut down,? the pacer was quoted as saying in the Sydney Morning Herald. 

Coach Bob Woolmer was concerned about Pakistan?s slow over-rate in the first Test at Perth. He outlined Shoaib?s run-up as one of several areas that needed to be rectified ahead of the Melbourne Test starting on Sunday. (PTI)

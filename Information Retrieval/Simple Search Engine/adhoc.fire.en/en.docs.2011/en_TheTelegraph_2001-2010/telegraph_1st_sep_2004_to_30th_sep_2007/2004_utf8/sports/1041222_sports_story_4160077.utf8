 Germans crush Thais

Bangkok: Germany crushed Thailand 5-1 on Tuesday to end their three-game tour of Asia on a high note after their weekend defeat by South Korea. 

Kevin Kuranyi and Lukas Podolski both scored twice for Germany, who coped well with the sweltering heat in Bangkok following matches in bitterly cold Yokohama and Busan. 

Striker Gerald Asamoah was also on target for the 2002 World Cup runners-up, who led 2-0 at halftime after Kuranyi strikes in the 33rd and 38th minutes. 

Sarayut Chaikamdee scored in the 58th minute to give brief hope to Thailand, whose defence of the regional Tiger Cup came to a halt last week when they were knocked out of the competition. 

?This victory is a bit of a Christmas present for the team,? Germany coach Juergen Klinsmann said. 

?We controlled the match and should have scored more goals but the pleasing thing has been the chemistry among the squad, which has been fantastic.? 

Germany overpowered Asian champions Japan 3-0 in their opening game last Thursday. (Reuters)

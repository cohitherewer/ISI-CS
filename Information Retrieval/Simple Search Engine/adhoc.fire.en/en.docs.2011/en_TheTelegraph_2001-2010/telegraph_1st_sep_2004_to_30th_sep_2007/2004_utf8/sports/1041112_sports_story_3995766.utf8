 Romario scores two in farewell tie

Los Angeles: Romario scored both goals as Brazil?s 1994 World Cup winning team beat their Mexican contemporaries 2-1 here Wednesday in a match billed as the ?grand farewell? to the famed striker. 

The Brazilian stabbed home a cross from Aldair in the 61st minute and drove home the winner after a powerful run into the box in the 86th minute in a match which also gave 52,389 fans at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum the chance to say farewell to popular Mexican goalkeeper Jorge Campos. 

Romario, who is 38 and currently without a club, told reporters he still considered himself fit enough to play for a couple more years. 

Last month Romario was kicked out by his Brazilian club Fluminense after a series of fitness problems and clashes with his coaches. 

Romario was substituted shortly after scoring the winner and the game stopped for several minutes as he made a lap of honour around the ground and fireworks filled the sky.

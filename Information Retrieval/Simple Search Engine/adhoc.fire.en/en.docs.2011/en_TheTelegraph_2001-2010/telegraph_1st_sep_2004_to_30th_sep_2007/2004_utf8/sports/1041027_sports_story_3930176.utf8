Ravi Shastri

I am a right-handed batsman. Whenever I try 

to lift a spinner I get caught in the deep. Please help. 

(Zonaathan Chatterjee, 20, Dibrugarh) 

You are lifting your head too early. As a result you 

are struggling with your timing 

Whenever I try to take a high catch, I misjudge 

the flight of the ball. Please suggest the right technique in taking high catches. 

(Tapan Dutta, 18, Calcutta-17) 

Very simple. Always keep your eyes on the ball. Also 

make sure your head is not bobbing all over the place And you are well balanced 

when you take the catch. 

I am a left-arm spinner. When I take my run-up 

diagonally for bowling round the wicket, I end up with a no ball. How do I stop 

this problem while coming closer to the wicket? 

(Dipayan Bhattacharya, 16, Howrah-4) 

Re-mark your run-up to ensure that you don?t overstep. 

Make sure you practice this at nets. 

I am a right-handed batsman and usually get 

bowled when the ball is pitched on the leg stump. Is something wrong with my stance? 

(Rahul Gupta, 15, Siliguri) 

You obviously are not getting your feet in the right 

position. Also, there could be a tendency of you falling over. 

I am a medium pacer and often fail to bowl at 

the same pace. In fact, because of the slow down after the initial burst, I often 

get hit all over the park. 

(Nikunj Kasat, 10, Calcutta-48) 

You have to work on your fitness. Also you got to 

do a lot of bowling so that your bowling muscles get stronger. 

I am a right-arm medium-pacer. Whenever I try 

to bowl a yorker, it ends up being a full toss. Please help. 

(Pranjol Dutta, 14, Guwahati-12) 

Try and aim for the base of the stump. And keep watching 

the spot closely. Once you do this exercise you will get a fair idea as to where 

you got to focus on, so that you get the yorker right. 

I have a huge backlift and my coach feels I 

will face problems against fast bowlers. Attempts to correct the same makes me 

uncomfortable when batting. 

(Ramen Das, 19, Calcutta-34) 

You only have a problem if you don?t have time to 

play the quicks. If that is the case then you might want to decrease the backlift 

when you are playing the quicks. 

I am a right-arm medium pacer. Though I bowl 

an off stump line, my deliveries constantly fall short of length despite my best 

efforts to pitch the ball up. Please help. 

(Xavier Paul, 19, Calcutta-16) 

Ask your coach to check your action during delivery. 

Also watch the spot you want the ball to land. 

I am safe when taking catches but my ground 

fielding is poor. Attempts to correct this during practice hasn?t helped. How 

can I improve my ground fielding? 

(Rajib Roy, 19, Calcutta-17) 

Plenty of practice. You should ask your coach to devise 

drills that make you enjoy fielding and get the right techniques when you are 

stopping or throwing the ball.

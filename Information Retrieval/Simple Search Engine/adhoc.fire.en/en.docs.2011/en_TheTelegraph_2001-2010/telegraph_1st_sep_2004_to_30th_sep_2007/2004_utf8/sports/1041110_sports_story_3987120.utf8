Calcutta: East Bengal players Sasthi Duley 

and Dipankar Roy, who were released on bail on Tuesday after having spent a week 

in jail, said that they wanted to prove themselves on the field. 

The players were brought to the club following their 

release in the evening. Hundreds of fans, voicing support, accompanied the duo 

to the club. 

Sasthi and Dipankar held a brief press conference at the club tent stating that they are looking forward to return to the field as soon as possible. 

They however, declined to comment on the charges brought by the police and instead said: ?We want to play good football and prove ourselves on the field?. 

They also thanked the club and teammates, especially coach Subhas Bhowmick and Bhaichung Bhutia for standing by their side during their time of crisis. 

Sasthi and Dipankar were arrested in connection with their association with gangster Dilip Banerjee (known as hathkata Dilip). 

Bhaichung, who along with Bhowmick met the two in custody, said their release was a ?good news?. 

?It has been a difficult period in their life and I think teammates should help them get back to normalcy. 

?We are waiting to see them back in training,? the India striker said. 

Bhaichung also felt that their release should act 

as an impetus for the team, which will be facing Mohun Bagan in the Durand Cup 

final on Wednesday.

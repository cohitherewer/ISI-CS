Durban: Graham Thorpe scored his 16th Test century to put England in control on the fourth day of the second Test against South Africa on Wednesday. 

Thorpe scored 118 not out in England?s 570 for seven declared, their third highest second innings total in Test history. The Surrey lefthander batted for more than five hours, facing 209 balls and hitting 15 fours. 

South Africa, who are chasing a target of 378, were 21 for one at close. Herschelle Gibbs was batting on 11 with nightwatchman Nicky Boje on four after Matthew Hoggard trapped captain Graeme Smith leg before for five. The hosts need 357 on the final day. 

South Africa scored 332 in their first innings in reply to England?s 139. 

Thorpe, 35, said the match was one of the most remarkable of his 11-year career. 

?I haven?t played in too many matches where we?ve been bowled out for 130 and then been 200 behind on the first innings,? Thorpe said. 

?If you look at the psychology of the game, we were down but not quite out on the first day and we had to do something special to turn it around. 

?We?ve pushed the pendulum back over to South Africa?s side.? 

Thorpe said he was happy with his own contribution. 

 ?It was hugely satisfying because 

 I?ve been struggling,? he said. ?We were just 88 ahead last 

 night and the match was evenly balanced.? 

 The difference of 431 runs between England?s two innings 

 was their biggest disparity in Test history, surpassing 

 the difference of 400 runs when Australia dismissed England 

 for 75 and 475 in Melbourne in 1894-95.

 England, who won the first Test 

 by seven wickets, resumed on 281 for one but in the fifth 

 over of the day Andrew Strauss edged fast bowler Makhaya 

 Ntini to Martin van Jaarsveld at third slip. 

Strauss scored 136 in more than six hours at the crease in which he faced 285 balls and hit 16 fours. 

Eight overs later Ntini struck again to have Michael Vaughan caught behind down the leg side by wicketkeeper AB de Villiers for 10. 

England were 314 for four within five overs when Mark Butcher, on 13, edged Jacques Kallis again to Van Jaarsveld in the slips. (Reuters)

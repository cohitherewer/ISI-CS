 Injured Inzy pulls out

 - Second Test 

- Australia still hopeful about Langer; Woolmer warns of backlash 

 Ricky Ponting says Aussie batsmen will be better prepared 

Melbourne: Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul-Haq has ruled himself out of the second Test against Australia starting on Sunday due to a back injury. 

?I have been advised to rest for three weeks by doctors. My back is sore and hurting,? he said after undergoing medical tests. 

His absence in the Boxing Day Test will be a big blow for Pakistan, who were crushed by the world champions by 491 runs in the first Test. The captain, however, had a wretched time in Perth, dismissed for one in the first innings and, clearly in pain, a duck in the second. 

Inzamam said he was not yet sure about playing in the third and final Test in Sydney. 

Meanwhile, in-form opener Justin Langer will be given every chance to recover from a back injury and play for Australia in the Boxing Day Test, coach John Buchanan said on Saturday. 

Langer spent part of Christmas Day swimming, and having a massage on his lower back after the injury flared at Wednesday?s training. 

The 34-year-old left-handed opener wants to extend his lead at the top of the 2004 Test run-scoring table but, while the bulging disc in his lower back has improved, he still is in doubt to play. 

?I?m still a bit sore but I have not given up hope and I guess we?ll know what the form is Sunday morning,? Langer said. 

Buchanan said Langer would be given every chance to retain his place in the match. ?There?s still doubt ? definite doubt,? Buchanan said of Langer. 

?But he?s certainly improving so we?ll keep monitoring that and hopefully make a decision as early as possible ? one for his sake, but also for (stand-by) Simon Katich.? 

Langer?s long-term opening partner Matthew Hayden was the only Australian player to go down to the MCG on Christmas to have a look at the wicket. Pakistan trained soon after. 

The MCG?s drop-in wicket is expected to play slower and lower than the first bouncy Perth strip. 

Australian captain Ricky Ponting said he was confident his team would not find themselves on the back foot as early as at the WACA ground, where pacemen Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Sami had the world?s leading team reeling at 78 for five on Day I. 

This time, Ponting said, Australia?s batsmen would be better prepared. 

?We know how to play their fast bowlers,? he said. ?You have to be very sharp, you have to play straight and you have to be patient and wait for the bad balls because they will bowl you some.? 

Ponting will look back on his first year as captain with satisfaction, but tinged with frustration he failed to repeat his 2003 form that yielded 1,503 runs at an average of 100. 

Still without a century as Test skipper, Ponting scored 659 runs in 18 innings ?at 41 ? since his last century, the majestic 257 against India in last year?s corresponding Boxing Day Test at the MCG. 

 Inzamam-ul Haq is doubtful for the third 

and final Test as well

Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer believes Pakistan can rebound from the purgatory of Perth and make a game of the Boxing Day Test. 

Amid a flood of offers for help from outside the team, Woolmer said the most constructive session the side had was an honest self-appraisal the day after the Perth capitulation. 

?They?re not down, they?re very hurt,? Woolmer said on Saturday when asked if his players could bounce back. 

?I?ve seen them rebound from situations like this. They?re very disappointed in themselves and they now know they have to come out and fight hard and make sure it doesn?t happen again.? 

Paceman Shoaib Akhtar, who suffered a shoulder scare in Perth, is set to play although Pakistan must find another way of accelerating his over rate as he is not prepared to shorten his lengthy run-up.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 One more miss upsets Sourav

Calcutta: Sourav Ganguly?s wait for Test century No. 12 continues. 

Thirteen innings have passed since that statement-making 144 at the Gabba, a year ago, but this period has only seen five fifties and a couple of forties. 

In Chittagong, on Saturday, the Team India captain came closest to ending this century-less run, but went no further than 88. 

?I?m quite pissed off? I did want to clear the boundary, but ended up playing a half-hearted shot (off Mohammed Rafique),? a distinctly unhappy Sourav told The Telegraph when contacted at the team hotel. 

Significantly, Sourav began the second and final Test against Bangladesh with two fifties in the last three innings: 71 (in Dhaka), 57 (in Kanpur, versus South Africa). In the past year, the other fifties have been 77 (Rawalpindi) and 73 (Melbourne). 

Asked whether he had ?identified? just what was going wrong, Sourav replied in the same cut-up tone: ?Don?t know? In fact, given the way I?m getting out (after fifty), God only knows when I?m going to get the next century?? 

Unless Bangladesh?s performance sees a dramatic upswing, compelling India to bat a second time, the captain?s next chance will be in early 2005, against Pakistan. He is, after all, ?confident? of pocketing the ongoing series with yet another innings win (?in three-and-a-half days?). 

If the manner of his dismissal upset Sourav, the legendary Vijay Hazare?s passing away made it a tad worse. 

?I don?t recall meeting Hazare, but remember reading and hearing that he was both an outstanding batsman and a human being? Tomorrow, we?re going to take the field with black armbands,? he remarked. 

An early wrap-up at the M.A.Aziz Stadium will, of course, be the best tribute for the former captain. 

Footnote: A one-day century too is long over due ? Sourav?s last, his 22nd, was way back in March 2003 during the World Cup semi-final versus Kenya.

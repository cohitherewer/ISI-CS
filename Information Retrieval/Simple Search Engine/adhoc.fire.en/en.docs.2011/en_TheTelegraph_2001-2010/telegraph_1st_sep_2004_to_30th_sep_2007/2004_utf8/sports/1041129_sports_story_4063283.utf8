The Telegraph - Calcutta

 It was a good toss to win, feels Smith

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: South African captain Graeme Smith feels winning the toss could make the difference in the second Test. ?It was a good toss to win and we made most of it,? he said after stumps on Day I. 

?A lot of emphasis is placed on the first innings when playing in India. About 450 should be a good score in these conditions,? Smith explained. 

He, however, did not wish to make a direct comment on how the pitch could behave in the remaining days. ?The pitch is a lot drier here compared to Kanpur. The surface is already coming off. Let?s see... We need one big partnership tomorrow.? 

Picking the positives from the opening day?s play, Smith said: ?The fact that no spinner picked a wicket is a positive sign for us. We scored at a decent rate. We?re targetting a score of around 400-450. 

Smith felt Jacques Kallis? century ?was one of his best innings?. The skipper added it would take some more time for Kallis to be fit to bowl. ?As of today, Kallis will not be bowling in this match?? 

The captain also praised Hashim Amla. ?He played well and showed promise. A 20-30 leaves you with disappointment in the dressing room. But he is hungry and that is important. Hopefully another opportunity will come his way.? 

Irfan Pathan, who took three wickets, said: ?The pitch suited me? All the bowlers did well. We bowled a consistent line and length,? he said. 

He said reverse swing was the key to his success. ?It was at the beginning of the second spell that I started getting reverse swing. Bowling with the old ball at nets has helped in making use of the reverse swing,? he said. 

Pathan was all praise for Zaheer Khan. ?His performance helps and motivates others. When one bowls well it obviously rubs off on the others. He is our No. 1 bowler and it?s good to see him bowling well.? 

The Baroda pacer felt it was quite different bowling to Australian and South African batsmen. ?Australians were attacking while the South Africans take time to play their shots. It?s a contrasting style. You?ve to be ready to change strategy in international cricket. 

?I missed the last three Test matches. Even when I was not playing I was thinking about my game, planning strategy. I definitely did try to prove a point.?

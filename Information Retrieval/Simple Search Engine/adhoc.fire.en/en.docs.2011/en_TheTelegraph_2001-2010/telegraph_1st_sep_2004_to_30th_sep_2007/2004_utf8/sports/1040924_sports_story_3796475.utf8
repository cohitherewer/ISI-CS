 Delhi want Bagan trio

 A CORRESPONDENT 

New Delhi: The new eligibility rules of the Santosh Trophy, that only domiciled players can represent their states has led to an imbroglio between organisers Delhi and Mohun Bagan. The Delhi Soccer Association (DSA) wants to rope in a trio of players from Bagan, striker Sunil Chhetri, midfielder Rishi Kapoor and left back Praveen Rawat, all of whom were born in the capital. 

Bagan wants to release Chhetri and Rishi only after the IFA Shield, slated to finish on October 10. Rawat, selected for the India U-20 squad. 

Delhi start their Santosh trophy campaign on October 14, and also invited a trio from Salgaocar, goalkeeper Rajat Guha, defender Prashant Jaggi, midfielder Arjun Pandit and JCT midfielder Sumit Thapa. 

Meanwhile, it is learnt that Bengal is unseeded for the 59th Santosh Trophy, as they did not qualify for the semi-finals in Manipur last year. Hence Bengal will have to play preliminary group league matches.

 Maradona can leave clinic: Judge

Buenos Aires: Former soccer great Diego Maradona can leave an Argentine psychiatric clinic where he was being held against his will for drug addiction, a judge ruled on Monday. 

Maradonas family forced him to enter the clinic on the outskirts of Buenos Aires in May for cocaine addiction treatment after he was rushed to intensive care in April with a swollen heart and breathing problems. 

The 43-year-old needed a judges permission to leave the clinic. 

Judge Norberto Garcia Vedia allowed Maradona to continue his treatment in Cuba, which the Argentine has made his second home in recent years. His lawyer said Maradona may leave the country later this week.

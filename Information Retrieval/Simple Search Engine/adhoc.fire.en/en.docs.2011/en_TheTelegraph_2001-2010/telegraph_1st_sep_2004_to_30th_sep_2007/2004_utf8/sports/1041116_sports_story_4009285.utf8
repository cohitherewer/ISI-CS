Melbourne: Former Australian Test batsman David Hookes threw two punches at the hotel bouncer accused of his manslaughter before being knocked down and suffering fatal head injuries, a court heard on Monday. 

Hookes had been drinking with friends including Test player Darren Lehmann at the Beaconsfield Hotel in St Kilda on January 18 when the incident happened. Hookes, 48, died the next day. 

Lehmann, who is set to play in Thursday?s first Test against New Zealand in Brisbane, told Melbourne?s magistrates court on Monday that he could not recall Hookes being argumentative with the staff, an Australian Associated Press report said. 

Hotel security personnel Zdavko Micevic is charged with manslaughter and assault of Hookes. Defence barrister Terry Forrest told the court his client would give evidence that Hookes threw two punches at Micevic before he retaliated. 

Lehmann, 34, told the court he had drunk three beers and a vodka in the pub after consuming three beers earlier in the day after a cricket match. Lehmann also said he did not believe Hookes had drunk too much on the night. 

?Needless to say, the past 24 hours have been very difficult,? Lehmann said in a statement released on Monday. 

?However, it is all behind me now. The case is still before the courts, so it is inappropriate for me to make any further comments. It?s great to now be back with the boys, and I?m really looking forward to getting out there on Thursday.? 

The committal hearing continues this week in Melbourne while Lehmann is expected to rejoin the Australia camp in Brisbane for training on Tuesday.

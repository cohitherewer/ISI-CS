Calcutta: Chaos reigned supreme at the international terminal of the Dumdum Airport as Team India arrived on Tuesday after their successful tour of Bangladesh. 

After a slight delay, the Indian Airlines flight touched down at 5.15 pm. What followed was nothing short of high drama. 

To avoid the reporters waiting inside the airport building, security personnel tried to escort Team India members through a separate door, but as soon as the players stepped outside the international terminal, they were engulfed by a 700-strong crowd of onlookers and mediapersons. 

Captain Sourav Ganguly seemed extremely hassled. As the crowd jammed the exit, security personnel had to take him back to the building before leading him out through the airport manager?s door. 

The scribes who followed him were literally shoved away before securitymen bundled Sourav into his car. The other teammembers took connecting domestic flights to their respective destinations. 

The least that the BCCI can do is to organise a media conference with the captain, once the team returns home.It?s not insignificant that the BCCI continues to be headed by the city-based Jagmohan Dalmiya.

 David Beckham denies retirement reports

Madrid: England captain David Beckham has denied reports that he plans to retire from international soccer after the 2006 World Cup and says he wants to play for his country as long as possible. 

?I was asked if the next World Cup was going to be my last and I said possibly it could be, but I hope it isn?t,? Beckham told a news conference in Madrid before Wednesday?s friendly against Spain. 

?I want to carry on playing for England as long as I can and if that means playing after the World Cup then great. I don?t want to retire from playing for my country because it?s one of the best honours I?ve ever been given in football. 

?I set a target for myself when I got into the team and when I was given the captaincy and that was to reach the records of Bobby Charlton and Bobby Moore, both of whom were idols of my dad and myself.? 

Former Manchester United forward Bobby Charlton won 106 caps and England captain Bobby Moore won 108, to become the two outfield players to make the most appearances for the national side.

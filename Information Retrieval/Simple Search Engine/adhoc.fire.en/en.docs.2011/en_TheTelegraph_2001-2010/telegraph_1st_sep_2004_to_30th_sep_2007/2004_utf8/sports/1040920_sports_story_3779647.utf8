The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Espanyol hand Real another loss

 - EUROpean ROUND-UP - Palermo hold Inter 1-1 

 Real Madrid forward Ronaldo vies with Espanyol?s Ito during their Spanish League match in Barcelona on Saturday 

Madrid: Ronaldo missed a penalty and Walter Samuel and Michel Salgado were both sent off as Real Madrid lost 0-1 at Espanyol on a night of self-inflicted misery on Saturday. 

Three days after a humiliating 0-3 defeat against Bayer Leverkusen, Real went behind to a 42nd minute goal from Maxi Rodriguez but missed a chance to equalise early in the second half when Ronaldo?s spot kick was turned away. 

Samuel, the Argentine centre-back signed for 25 million euros ($30.45 million) from Roma, received a second yellow card in the 74th minute and Salgado followed him off in injury-time after landing an elbow on Ivan de la Pena. 

Victory for Espanyol gave the club seven points from three games . Valencia joined them at the top with a 3-1 win at home to Real Sociedad. Marco Di Vaio scored the opening two goals for the champions and Mista added a third before Mikel Arteta pulled one back from the penalty spot. 

Osasuna also have seven points after edging past Real Betis 3-2. Real are now on six points. 

With Zinedine Zidane and Luis Figo missing through injury, and Raul and David Beckham dropped from the starting line-up, Real Madrid were desperately short of ideas against a confident Espanyol. 

Michael Owen never so much as hinted at marking his first start with a goal and the England international striker made way for Fernando Morientes just past the hour mark. 

By that time, Real were already looking down and out. 

Raul Tamudo should have scored after 28 minutes when he was put through on goal but the Spanish striker?s shot was bundled away. Second-choice ?keeper Cesar, playing after Iker Casillas dislocated a finger in the warm-up, was adjudged to have pushed Tamudo at the resulting corner and the referee awarded a penalty. 

However, Cesar saved from Tamudo, then repeated the feat when the referee ordered the penalty retaken, and Espanyol continued to press, making the breakthrough three minutes before the break. 

In Serie A action, Inter Milan were held to a 1-1 draw at home to promoted Palermo on Saturday after Luca Toni cancelled out Adriano?s opener for Inter at the San Siro stadium, adds another report from Milan. 

The result was Inter?s second successive draw in Serie A this season but proof that Palermo, back in the top flight after a 31-year absence, are a side to be taken seriously. 

Two goals from 18-year-old Bulgarian striker Valeri Bojinov helped Lecce to an impressive 4-1 home win over Brescia earlier on Saturday.

 Dhoni cracks 92-ball ton

 Mahendra Singh Dhoni 

Jamshedpur: Mahendra Singh Dhoni cracked a classy unbeaten 113 (113 balls, 17x4, 1x6) to help Jharkhand gain the vital first innings lead against Orissa on the opening day of their crucial Ranji Trophy Plate group A tie at Keenan Stadium on Monday. 

Dhoni?s 100 came in 92 balls with 14 fours and a six. 

At stumps, Jharkhand were 147 for two with Rajiv Kumar giving Dhoni company. The home team has a lead of 37 runs with plenty of batting to come. Earlier, Orissa were bundled out for a paltry 110, thanks largely to Shiv Shankar Rao?s six-wicket haul.

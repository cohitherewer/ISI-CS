Calcutta: Eden wasn?t shorn of stars Saturday. As everyone from past and present jostled for attention, the onlookers found it real tough to focus on one individual. 

If Virender Sehwag and Sourav Ganguly thought it was their day, Yuvraj Singh and Inzamam-ul Haq had other ideas as they tried to grab the attention like a burglar attempting to break a safe. Ultimately, Salman Butt walked away with honours at the end of the day. 

The six-wicket victory left Pakistan?s unbeaten record against India under Bob Woolmer intact. 

The excessive dew was always going to be a factor and it worked both ways. It was difficult to grip the wet and soft ball. The outfield became slower, making things tough for the fielders as well. The bowlers? follow through was soggy and the stickyness of the pitch made strokeplaying difficult. 

Predictably, the Indians concentrated on restricting, rather than taking wickets. And as in such circumstances, Inzamam was more intent on the singles, after Butt and Shoaib Malik had put them on a firm footing with a 113-run partnership for the second wicket. The occasional boundary then was not difficult to come by. It served Pakistan?s purpose. 

The circumstances forced an excessive delay with the change of balls and bowlers taking time out to clear muck from the boots. Then there was the interruption due to Butt?s injury. 

The mind games were also being played out there in the middle. Irfan Pathan and Yusuf Youhana needlessly got engaged in a verbal duel, the Pakistani instigating the bowler, and it was left to Inzamam and the umpires to cool tempers. Youhana?s concentration was the worst affected and he departed a little later. 

Butt?s unbeaten maiden hundred in his sixth match remained the talking point. Whether the youngster manages to step into the shoes of any of his famous predecessors remains to seen, but he certainly showed promise to make it big. Gripped by cramps in the middle of his innings, he retired when on 68, but returned to steer Pakistan home. 

Inzamam is a master in these situations. He was denied a victory in Karachi in March despite playing one of his best innings. But this time he made sure it didn?t happen again. The laid-back attitude is often misleading as he remains the silent assassin. The power he instilled into his strokes often left people awestruck. His dismissal came too late in the day. 

That his ?luck? with the coin deserted him must have surprised the Indian captain himself. The roar that followed from the few thousands once Inzamam called wrongly almost signified more than half the battle was won. That the advantage was surrendered was more to the Pakistan batsmen?s prowess. 

India?s decision to go in with three left-arm seamers defied logic and with Harbhajan Singh finding the conditions tough, it meant bad news for India. 

Pakistan?s reliance on pace had earlier proved to be their nemesis. For a brief while, though, the off-spin of Shahid Afridi halted the Indian progress. But Sourav and Yuvraj demolished whatever little challenge the visitors had on offer. 

In many ways, Yuvraj?s knock was a timely reminder of his form and ability to turn the tide favourably in trying circumstances. The clenched fist on reaching his fifty must have been meant for the selectors, who put him under tremendous pressure after raising a debate over his role as an opener in the Test squad. Yuvraj?s 78 off 62 balls justified Sourav?s faith in his abilities. 

Much before the game started, Woolmer used his handycam to record moments to savour across the stadium. The events that unfolded thereafter must have forced him to store them for critical analysis and revision of strategies. 

On this slow wicket, the Pakistani fast bowlers strived for extra pace which brought about their downfall. Afridi?s early onset may have been forced because of the pacers? form, but his consistent line had for a while forced the Indians into a shell. Once his spell ended, none of his teammates managed to make the slightest of impression on the Indians. 

Sachin Tendulkar?s needless run out after an enterprising start and Laxman?s willingness to live dangerously at the outset were sure to send the wrong signals, but Sehwag held fort. The application and temperament shown by the Delhi batsman on this pitch with variable bounce once again proved his maturity. 

That Sehwag sets the tone and agenda for the innings has now become a norm. His presence meant the runs flowed regularly and a steady scoring rate made the task of the later order that much easier. The first 15 overs contributed 85 and the advantage certainly lay with the hosts. 

The 82-run second wicket stand between Sehwag and Laxman was laced with some superb strokeplay. The initial flamboyance over, Laxman batted as he usually does ? all flair and elegance. 

As the Indians took charge, sixes flowed ? even Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Sami were not spared. Sehwag?s six over long off took the sails out of Shoaib, who was brought on in his lone-over second spell after Sourav?s arrival. 

It was a sweet little innings from the city-based star. Not showing any signs of discomfiture, his sense of timing left the bowlers drained. Sourav fell to a well-judged catch by Kamran Akmal, running a good 20 yards behind, but not before the visitors? confidence was dented. 

Sourav and Yuvraj added 84 in 73 balls for the fifth wicket, a partnership that consolidated the innings at a crucial period. That, however, came to no avail in the end.

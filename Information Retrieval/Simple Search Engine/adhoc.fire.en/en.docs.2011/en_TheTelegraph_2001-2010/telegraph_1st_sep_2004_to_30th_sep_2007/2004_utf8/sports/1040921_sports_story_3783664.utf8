 Elistano shattered Bollywood?s dreams 

 STAR RACER

 Among many theories related to the bloodlines of horses, a greater credence to the dam side is given in Europe. Americans, however, think the other way round. Both sections in the past have, nevertheless, proved their point and there is no argument about it. It?s a matter of one?s belief. Therefore, the staunch followers of the staying dam-lines scored a point after the victory of Elistano in Friday?s Calcutta Derby Stakes, over 2,000m. 

 Elistano?s sire Metal Precieux may be rated as an emerging stallion. But make no 

 mistake about his dam, Pot Of Gold, who has already established herself as a producer of champion middle distance runners. It, therefore, hardly came as a surprise when Elistano simply knocked out a classy miler Bollywood Dreams by seven lengths in the prized event of the season. 

 About three weeks ago, the two horses had fought a lively duel in the shorter classic, the 1,400m Calcutta Colts Trial Stakes. In the Derby, the Dreams was definitely in contention until 300m from home but the rest of the journey weighed heavily upon the Bharath Singh-trainee and he made an abject surrender. It also ended his dream to avenge his Colts Stakes narrow defeat. Elistano, a Vijay Singh-trainee was ridden by C. Aford.

 Vijay?s rule during the afternoon had started in the eight-event-card much earlier. His day?s tally of four included three of the five trophy races. In fact, all his triumphs were bloodless coups. 

 Starting off with Approved?s start-to-finish victory in the 1,800m Desert Shot Cup, he continued the good work through Thrilling Proposal?s effortless triumph in the 1,400m Star Of Italy Cup before Corvino in the 1,200m Fair Ray Handicap and Elistano in the Derby completed the rout. 

 Approved is another youngster boasting of his strong dam-side connections and won the way he liked. Alford had the Steinbeck-Our Fantasy son settled upfront from the start, by a length or so. For rest of the journey, the three-year-old went on adding up a length with each passing furlong. Approved may have more winning opportunities coming his way in the months to follow.

 Thrilling Proposal killed a giant in Bold Raider, the Fillies Stakes? runaway winner. The Proposal, a Rebounding Thrill-Modest Proposal son ridden by S. Shanker, was always kept in close attendance of the 8-10 favourite but in the final stretch he drew away from the public-choice for a thumping nine-length-plus victory. In fact, the favourite was stretched to the fullest by Actuary to retain the second slot.

 Corvino, unlike Approved, was raced to the front with a long break. The American Chance-Engaging Girl three-year-old, however, needed a breather nearing the 600m, which cut his lead down to a mere length. With his batteries re-charged, the Vijay-ward was hard to catch thereafter.

 The Vijay-saga left a very little playground for brother Bharath and the Daniel David-stable. Nevertheless, the two professional managed to pick up three events between themselves with Daniel?s share being a couple. However, Daniel?s even-money favourite Cambridge Blue in the Eastern Air Command Cup was stretched by the Alford-ride Alessio. More importantly, the favourite, ridden by B. Prakash, could have faced a serious challenge from his stable-mate Predecessor had jockey Yacoob ridden the horse seriously. Yacoob was reported to the stewards who stood him down for three race days. Prakash had trying time on another favourite, Great Ambition, in the Alvarada Handicap. However, his stronger riding managed to hold Mark Reuben on Mayan Hiss.

 Bharath?s Evangeline in the Hovercraft Cup, once again, proved that the filly in form can be unstoppable. The Excalibur?s Lake-Glowing Tribute daughter carried her topweight to another fluent victory in the hands of Ryan Marshall.

 Zaheer recipe: 

Frustrate Aussie bowlers

 Zaheer Abbas 

Karachi: Former cricket great Zaheer Abbas on Saturday advised Pakistani batsmen to be patient at the crease and frustrate the Australian bowlers during the Boxing Day Test in MCG starting Sunday. 

?Just hold your horses, stay at the crease with patience and to a degree where the Australian bowlers get frustrated because that is the only way to come good against the world champions,? Abbas said. 

?Don?t panic, play positively and don?t think that the Australian bowlers are unplayable,? Abbas advised. Zaheer Abbas, known for his cover drives, played 78 Tests for Pakistan accumulating 5,062 runs. He was labelled ?Asian Bradman?, after the legendary Sir Donald Bradman. 

?It?s all in the mind and a matter of staying at the crease, you hold your horses and others get frustrated,? said Abbas, who made 1,141 runs in 20 Tests against Australia. 

Pakistan were widely criticised for their 491-run loss to Australia in the first Test at Perth. 

Ten of the 13 Pakistanis out caught in the first Test were snapped up behind the wicket as Glenn McGrath and Michael Kasprowicz exploited the visitors?s inability to cope with the extra bounce and pace at WACA. 

Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq managed just one and nought while Yousuf Youhana made one and 27, as the visitors were bowled out for a paltry 179 and 72 in the two innings. (AFP)

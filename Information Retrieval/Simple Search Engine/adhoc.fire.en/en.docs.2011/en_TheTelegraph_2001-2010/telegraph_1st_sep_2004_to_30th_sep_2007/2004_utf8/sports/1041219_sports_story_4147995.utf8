 Surya retains title

 - NATIONAL A CHESS - Sandipan loses out in tie-breaker 

Visakhapatnam: Grandmaster Surya Sekhar Ganguly of Petroleum Sports Promotion Board (PSPB) edged out teammate Sandipan Chanda yet again to defend his title in the 42nd National A chess championship here at Waltair club. 

At the end of the 19th and final round, both Surya Sekhar and Chanda scored 12 points each. But in the tie-breaker, Surya Sekhar emerged winner under the ?Koya system?. 

Last year too it was a similar story as Surya Sekhar had prevailed over Chanda via a superior tie-break score. 

In the last round, Surya Sekhar decided not to take chance against Prathamesh Mokal of Bank Sports Board. Chanda needed to win his game against GM Abhijit Kunte to claim the title. But Kunte defended doggedly till the end. 

Chanda surprised Kunte opening with the queen-pawn. But he was in turn for a surprise as his opponent employed the queen?s gambit. 

At the middle game the players entered a balanced bishop and pawns endgame where a draw was the only result. 

Kunte finished third and remained unbeaten along with Chanda and Grandmaster Tejas Bakre of Indian Airlines.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Balaji down, but not out

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

Southampton: ?I?m going to be back in action soon? it?s not that I?m very worried,? remarked Lakshmipathy Balaji late on Friday. 

Speaking to The Telegraph at the team hotel in neighbouring Portsmouth, he added: ?I?m still in pain (right lower abdomen) but, once better, will have to be particular with (physio) Andrew Leipus? rehab programme.? 

Balaji is down, yes, not out. 

Bhandari replacement 

The selectors decided that Amit Bhandari will replace Balaji in the Indian squad for the Champions Trophy, adds our Staff Reporter in Calcutta. 

The Tamil Nadu medium-pacer was ruled out of the tournament on Friday because of an abdominal injury. 

Bhandari was among the standbys, and since Zaheer Khan is yet to regain full fitness, the selectors decided on sending the Delhi medium-pacer. 

Bhandari last played against Zimbabwe in Perth in February.

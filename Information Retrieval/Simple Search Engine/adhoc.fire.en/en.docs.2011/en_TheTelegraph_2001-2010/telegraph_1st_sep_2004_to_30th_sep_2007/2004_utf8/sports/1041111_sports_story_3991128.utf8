The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Longer term for Sunny

 - Former captain to remain consultant till SA series 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Gavaskar 

Calcutta: Former captain Sunil Gavaskar?s appointment as the Team India consultant has been extended till the end (December 2) of the two-Test series against South Africa. 

Gavaskar, therefore, will wear the consultant?s hat during Saturday?s Platinum Jubilee ODI versus Pakistan. 

However, given that Gavaskar is currently in Dubai, he could only arrive on the morning of the match. 

?The Board would have extended Gavaskar?s appointment till the end of the year, covering the tour of Bangladesh as well, but he?s required to fulfil TV commitments on that trip,? a well-placed source told The Telegraph on Wednesday. 

The tour of Bangladesh is going to feature two Tests and three ODIs between December 9-27. 

Gavaskar, it may be recalled, joined Team India some 36 hours before the just-ended (four-Test) series against Australia. For the Tests versus South Africa, at least, Gavaskar has more time to plot in tandem with captain Sourav Ganguly and coach John Wright. 

Incidentally, the first Test will be in Gavaskar?s sasural ? Kanpur. The next is at the Eden. 

Sourav, meanwhile, is gearing up for the immediate big day ? Thursday ? which is going to mark the opening of his delightful signature-restaurant, Sourav?s The Food Pavilion. 

The inauguration is slated for 1.00 pm and the honours will be done by Sachin Tendulkar, who has himself launched two Mumbai eateries (Tendulkar?s in Colaba and Sachin?s in Mulund). 

Besides Team India, some Pakistani players are also going to be present. The list of invitees has been kept small to ensure the cricketers relax and don?t end up signing autographs only. 

According to one of Sourav?s partners in the venture, ex-cricketer Sanjoy Das, the Food Pavilion?s commercial opening will be at 7.00 am on Friday. 

It?s a new pitch for Sourav, but he isn?t lacking confidence.

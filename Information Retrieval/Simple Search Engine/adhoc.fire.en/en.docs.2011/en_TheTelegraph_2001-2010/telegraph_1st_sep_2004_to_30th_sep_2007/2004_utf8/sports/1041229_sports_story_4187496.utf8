 ?It?s a year they can?t take away from me?

Melbourne: For Damien Martyn, year 2004 has been a huge success. The middle-order batsman scored six Test centuries this year so far, the latest giving Australia a modest but crucial innings lead over Pakistan in the second Test here on Tuesday. 

The 33-year-old was Australia?s hero, batting for over six hours for his 142. And with fast bowler Jason Gillespie, he stitched together a near-century stand, which steered the home side past Pakistan?s first innings score of 341, giving the Aussies a 38-run lead. 

Martyn struck his 11th Test century to take the initiative away from Pakistan. 

It capped a stellar year for the West Australian, who scored 110 and 161 against Sri Lanka, 104 and 114 against India and 100 not out in the first Perth Test win over Pakistan leading up to Tuesday?s knock. 

?When you sit down and you are away from the game you think about it. It?s a year they can?t take away from me,? Martyn said. 

?It?s something special to score six centuries in a season and see your name up there with some of the greats who have made so many runs,? he added. 

?I try to keep pretty level about it; it?s that kind of a game where you can be up and down next week. But when your career?s over they are the sorts of things you look back on and feel very special about.? 

Martyn, with 1,353 Test runs at an average of 56.37, is second to teammate Justin Langer on 1,476 this calendar year. 

He, however, said batting at Test level was a difficult task. 

?It?s not an easy job making centuries at Test level. We are always going to go through patches, it?ll happen to me again, it can happen to the guys in our side... You can?t consistently make hundreds week-in, week-out. 

?It?s the faith of the selectors in me last year, which I hope I have rewarded, and (captain) Ricky Ponting for sticking by me and giving me the chance this year.? 

The middle-order batsman turned the tide on the third day of the ongoing second Test with his 142 and praised Australia?s bowlers for picking five Pakistani wickets late in the day. 

?Tuesday was always going to be a big day from the team?s point of view. We were behind and we wanted to reach their score and get a bit of a lead, which we did. And the way the guys bowled was fantastic. It sets up for a great day on Wednesday,? Martyn remarked.

 London: Senegal international Khalilou Fadiga is to defy a heart specialist?s advice and resume his career with Bolton Wanderers. Although professor Marcello Chimienti, the specialist who diagnosed Fadiga?s heart condition, has warned the 29-year-old one fall or kick could kill him in an instant, the player has decided to resume training with the English Premier League club.

 Fadiga has had an automatic defibrillator implanted in his chest after collapsing during the warm-up before a League Cup match against Tottenham Hotspur in October. The midfielder had been attempting to make a comeback from surgery to correct an abnormal heartbeat. 

 Madrid: Two Albacete fans have been fined 6,000 euros ($8,033) each and banned from football stadiums for up to five months after racially abusing Barcelona striker Samuel Eto?o.

 Albacete officials praised the action of the supporters who had helped identify the two culprits following the Primera Liga match on December 11 but said they were angry that the club itself had also been fined by the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF).

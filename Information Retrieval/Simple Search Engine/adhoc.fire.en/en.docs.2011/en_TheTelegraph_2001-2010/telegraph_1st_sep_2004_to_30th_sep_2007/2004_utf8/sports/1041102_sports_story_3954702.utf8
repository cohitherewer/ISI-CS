Mumbai: Team India coach John Wright hinted that batting maestro Sachin Tendulkar may open the bowling with Zaheer Khan in the fourth and final Test. 

India are planning to go in with all three spinners ? Anil Kumble, Harbhajan Singh and Murali Kartik in the inconsequential Test starting on Wednesday. 

When asked who would open the bowling with Zaheer in case the spinners are fielded Wright said, ?Sachin (Tendulkar). He?s been bowling quick in the nets.? 

However, the coach said they will decide on the morning of the match whether to play three spinners. 

?We reckon the wicket is going to offer bounce and turn. It has been watered last night and may be watered today. The option of going in with three spinners has to be considered. I can?t say exactly now whether it will happen. 

?We will decide on the morning of the match after looking at the wicket, but it?s not out of the question,? Wright said. 

?We need a good wicket. We have got batsmen who need to get good scores. I hope the wicket holds up for all five days and offers turn on the third, fourth and fifth days,? Wright added. 

All three spinners have tasted success against the visitors in previous Tests. Despite India losing the first Test in Bangalore, Harbhajan bowled well, taking 11 wickets. Kumble secured 13 in Chennai in the drawn second Test to win man-of-the-match award. While Kartik bowled well after returning to the starting XI after nine months and took five wickets in Nagpur Test, which again was won by Australia to clinch the four-Test series 2-0. 

The hosts, meanwhile, would be playing for pride and hope to get back into some form ahead of the two-Test series against South Africa beginning later this month. 

?The series is lost for us. We have four new players. It?s a fresh start for us. We are playing for form and pride and we want to win this Test badly. We are eager to perform,? Wright remarked. 

?It was very disappointing to lose the match in Bangalore and then with what happened in Chennai... The last match (in Nagpur) was a tough match. They played well. The conditions suited them. It looks like the conditions will favour our spin bowlers here. We see it as an opportunity to win. But we have to get runs on the board,? he said. 

India were bowled out for 185 and 200 in Nagpur and barring Virender Sehwag, who had fired away in Chennai and Nagpur, the top-order looked a pale shadow of their former selves. 

Wright said personally the series loss had been the most disappointing for him since he took over as India coach. 

?We had played three times against Australia since I came on board. And this is the first time we have lost. That?s pretty disappointing. Equally disappointing is we have not been competitive with the bat,? Wright said. 

But the coach said he was not in favour of chopping and changing. 

?We have got class players like (Rahul) Dravid, (V.V.S.) Laxman, Sachin and Sehwag. People can go three or four games without scoring. The key is to stick with them till they completely regain confidence.? 

?I do believe they will get runs eventually. I would have stuck with them, the six-seven batters we have had in Tests over the last few years,? Wright said. 

?I think these boys will turn it around with the series against South Africa coming up. The team is determined to win and are ready to take up the challenge,? he declared.

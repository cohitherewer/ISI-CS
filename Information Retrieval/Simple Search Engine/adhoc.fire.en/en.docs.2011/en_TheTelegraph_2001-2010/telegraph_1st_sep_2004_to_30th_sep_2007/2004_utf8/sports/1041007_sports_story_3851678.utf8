 Panis to quit after Japan GP

 Panis will move to Toyota test-driving 

London: Olivier Panis, the oldest driver and only Frenchman on the Formula One starting grid, says farewell to Grand Prix racing in Japan this weekend. 

The 38-year-old Panis will start his 158th race at Suzuka and then step out of his Toyota for a new career as a test driver with the Japanese team. 

The decision for Panis to stand aside before the season-ending Brazilian Grand Prix was made when Italian Jarno Trulli, already signed up for next season, became available after parting from Renault last month. 

Trulli will race in Japan instead of Brazilian Ricardo Zonta, who then returns for his home race in place of Panis. 

If the easy-going Frenchman feels disappointed about the decision, he is certainly not showing it. 

A loyal team member and always polite and positive, at least in public, the man from Grenoble said he was looking forward to one last race at a favourite circuit where last year he qualified fourth. ?Although I will miss the excitement of racing, I will have the chance to give a big input in (Toyota?s) future in my new role as a third driver,? he said. 

?All I am hoping for this weekend is to finish my racing career with some points.? 

Only three current drivers ? Ferrari duo Michael Schumacher and Rubens Barrichello and McLaren?s David Coulthard ? have started more races than the Frenchman, who made his debut in 1994, before Coulthard. 

Like them, he is a member of the winners? circle, even if he has just one victory to his credit from a decade of competition.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 National circuit in city from Tuesday

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The amateur wing, so to say, of the Indian golf tour, a new concept, arrives in the city Tuesday. The Royal Challenge Indian Golf Tour for the RCGC Cup, the precursor to the professional tour, will be held over the Royal Calcutta Golf Club between Tuesday and December 17. 

This will be followed by the Eastern India Amateur meet (December 19 to 25). 

Top amateur golfers from all over the country will be seen in action. The RCGC Cup will be played in the strokeplay format over four days, while the East India will have a combination of two formats. One hundred players will play the strokeplay over the first two days and will shift to the matchplay for the next five days. The two finalists play 36 holes on the concluding day. 

Manav Das, Keshav Mishra, Amarbir Singh Malik, Jaskeerat Dulet will be among those to take part. 

Jasjeet Singh, off his victory in the amateur meet of Pune, and Simarjeet Singh, Gaganjeet Bhullar will also be around. 

Ashit Luthra, council member of the Indian Golf Union and former captain of the Royal Calcutta Golf Club, said the Union was pushing its junior course in the country so that ?more top class professionals are in the circuit soon.? He said it has now been proved that golf can provide a good livelihood and more juniors, even from less affluent families are coming forward. 

?To this effect we have planned training programmes for youngsters and have started encouraging schools to send in the children for selection events,? he said. Much of this, though, is still in New Delhi because of the proliferation of golf courses in that city. 

?While Calcutta is catching up again, more publilc putitng and driving courses are necessary.?

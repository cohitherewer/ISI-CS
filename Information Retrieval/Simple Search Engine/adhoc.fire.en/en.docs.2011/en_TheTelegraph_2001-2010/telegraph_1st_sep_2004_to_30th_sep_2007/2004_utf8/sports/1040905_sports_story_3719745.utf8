The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Agarkar, Balaji likely to sit out

 - Both Kumble, Harbhajan may play 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Sourav is under pressure 

Calcutta: According to The Telegraphs sources, late on Saturday, Team India is set for two changes in the concluding NatWest Challenge match (on Sunday). 

Apparently, its more or less decided that Anil Kumble and Ashish Nehra are going to make a comeback, with the expensive Ajit Agarkar and Lakshmipathy Balaji being dropped. 

Initially, one understands there was a move to omit Rohan Gavaskar and play Dinesh Karthik, but thats unlikely to happen now that Rohan is Sachin Tendulkars replacement for the Champions Trophy. 

Agencies add: India are 0-2 down in the series and there is nothing about their batting, bowling or fielding to suggest they have it in them to put it across England. The Team India skipper said despite Virender Sehwags poor show, there is no other alternative but to start with the Delhi opener. Sehwag has not played well at the top of the order. Sachin is injured, so we dont have another guy who has played as an opener in ODIs. 

 We struggled with our bowling at The Oval. The seam aspect in the first 15 overs as well in the final 15 overs is not good. 

England, on the other hand, are on a high. Skipper Michael Vaughan said: It is not easy to bat first in these conditions. We have not won many games batting first, so it is a real psychological boost. 

TEAMS 

India (likely XI): Sourav Ganguly, Virender Sehwag, V.V.S. Laxman, Rahul Dravid, Yuvraj Singh, Mohammed Kaif, Rohan Gavaskar, Irfan Pathan, Harbhajan Singh, Anil Kumble, Ashish Nehra. 

England (from): Michael Vaughan, Marcus Trescothick, Vikram Solanki, Andrew Strauss, Paul Collingwood, Geraint Jones, Anthony McGrath, Gareth Batty, Andrew Flintoff, Darren Gough, James Anderson, Steve Harmison, Alex Wharf, Ashley Giles.

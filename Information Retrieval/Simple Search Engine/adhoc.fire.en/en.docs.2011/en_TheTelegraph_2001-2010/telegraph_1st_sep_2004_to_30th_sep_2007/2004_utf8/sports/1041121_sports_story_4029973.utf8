 AFI names 40 probables 

New Delhi: Star athletes Anju Bobby George and K. M. Binu were among the 40 probables who were Saturday named by the Athletics Federation of India (AFI) for next year?s World Championships. 

The AFI announced 19 men and 21 women in 10 disciplines for the world meet to be held in Helsinki in August. The probables will attend a camp to be held at SAI South Centre, Bangalore, from November 25. 

The federation also brought out a separate list of 134 athletes (74 men, 60 women) to prepare for the Asian Track and Field meet and Asian Grand Prix series. For the Helsinki meet, the AFI has identified 800m, 4x400m relay, shot put and discus throw for men while pinning hopes on women in six disciplines. 

Besides Binu, the ten probables of the relay team include the members of the Indian team which narrowly missed the bus to the Athens Olympics, AFI secretary Lalit Bhanot said in a press release here. 

In the double-lap race, the AFI has named Joshmon Mathew and Ghamanda Ram (Jr) of Services and P.S. Primesh of Railways. Anil Kumar (ONGC) and Sukhbir Singh (Railways) will look to face the challenge in discus. 

The four shot-putters shortlisted for the camp include 31-year-old Bahadur Singh, who put up a pathetic show in Athens fouling all his three attempts in the qualifying round. 

The women campers for the longer relay include K. M. Beenamol, four discus throwers and three for heptathlon.

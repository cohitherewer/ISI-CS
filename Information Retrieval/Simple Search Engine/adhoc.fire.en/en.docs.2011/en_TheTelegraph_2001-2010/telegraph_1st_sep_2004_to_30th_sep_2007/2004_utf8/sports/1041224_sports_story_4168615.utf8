 Start doosra early: Ayub 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Arshad Ayub feels that that the complexities associated with bowling the doosra have made it a controversial delivery. 

?It is very difficult to bowl. The rotation of the wrist is not like when bowling a googly (for the leg-spinner). It requires tremendous strength in the wrist and shoulder and has to be developed from a young age,? the former India off-spinner, now in the city for conducting the Level I coaching course, said. 

?For all these reasons, the doubts over the doosra will always prevail,? Ayub, the vice-president of the Hyderabad Cricket Association, said. 

He did not wish to make a direct comment on the controversy surrounding Harbhajan Singh?s doosra, but said: ?It will not be easy to adhere to the ICC regulations. It will depend on how badly he wants to master the delivery.? 

Ayub, who also runs an academy in Hyderabad, felt ?Bending of the arm is a crime and should never be encouraged.? He said Erapalli Prasanna was the first to use the doosra. ?Pras was the only one who could bowl it with a perfect action, but that was more of a drifter?. 

 Kotla only for ODI 

The Kotla in Delhi will only be ready to host a one-dayer against Pakistan during the forthcoming series. The Delhi and District Cricket Association is scheduled to host a Test and one-dayer this time by the BCCI?s rotation policy, but sports secretary Sunil Dev says the renovation work will not be complete before March.

 Rooney wary of the sharks

 - If anyone can help the teenager mature into a strong person, its Ferguson 

 HENRY WINTER 

 Rooney says he is strong enough to handle the pressure 

Not since Paul Gascoigne was bewitching fans and belching into microphones has English football witnessed an individual so well-suited to football and so ill-suited to fame as Wayne Rooney. 

Brilliantly adept at escaping opponents clutches on the field, Rooneys chances of out-swimming the sharks that circle the sea of celebrity depend on how closely he listens to the paternal authority figure who sat next to him at Old Trafford Wednesday. 

Sir Alex Ferguson, his new manager, has eyes and ears all over Manchester and Cheshire, keeping a check on his young charges; the teenaged Ryan Giggs could not attend a party without an irate Scot storming in. If anyone can help Rooney mature into as strong a person as he is a centre-forward it is Ferguson. 

Wayne will get the same advice and protection as all our players, said the Manchester United manager. Wayne will find security in the dressing-room with people like Keene, Scholes, Giggs and the Nevilles, who are all mature, stable professionals. Wayne will see what these players have grown into and it is not by accident. 

The point had already dawned on Rooney. I went into the changing-room this morning and there was Keane and Giggs sitting there. If I need any advice, I can ask them. 

Ferguson nodded. United get the most attention so we have to handle things. But it is more difficult for players now because television has made interest in Premiership players phenomenal. 

The number of kids waiting for autographs has multiplied. When players walk down the street, they get photographed wherever they go, not just by the press but people take photos with their phones and there is nothing they can do about it. 

As United are partly bankrolled by manufacturers of camera-phones it is hard to feel too much sympathy. 

Rooney himself should dispel any thoughts of self-pity. His rocketing profile has generated some tacky, self-inflicted front-page headlines over his private life but his success as a footballer also now brings him 55,000 a week and a chance to partner Ruud van Nistelrooy. 

Over the last year, I have matured a lot on and off the pitch, said Rooney. I have had to because a lot of people are trying to bring me down. There is going to be a lot more pressure on me now but I am big enough and strong enough to handle it. I dont think he [Ferguson] has to say anything to me. As a professional footballer, I know myself. No one has to tell me how to behave on or off the pitch. 

After hearing Rooney detail his determination to be professional, Ferguson whispered well done. 

Always listening, always watching, Fergusons surveillance stems from a desire to see youngsters like Rooney develop as footballers and men which is why he will rest Rooney during the season. Wayne is a young lad and we are not asking him to climb a mountain tomorrow. The important thing is that Wayne is a major player in five years time. Not tomorrow. 

The new No 8s immersion into the first-team fray depends on how well his broken metatarsal is healing. It is only a matter of two or three weeks, said Ferguson. He did some training this morning. 

When that bone snapped during Euro 2004, there were fears Rooney would return to training overweight, such has been a past predilection for fast-food. He has shown commendable discipline in avoiding the quarter-pounders. Even before those eye-catching displays in Portugal, Rooney had been considering leaving Goodison for a larger stage. 

When you are sitting with England and all the players are talking about weve got such and such in the Champions League on Wednesday, I want to be playing in the biggest club tournament in the world. 

United would have preferred to bid during the winter when Rooneys price would have fallen below the current 27 million valuation. 

It is a strange twist of fate that if Newcastle had not come in [and bid] Wayne would probably still be at Everton, said Ferguson. Once we knew Everton were talking to another club, we had to do something. Manchester United could not afford to miss him. It would have been a terrible shame for us.

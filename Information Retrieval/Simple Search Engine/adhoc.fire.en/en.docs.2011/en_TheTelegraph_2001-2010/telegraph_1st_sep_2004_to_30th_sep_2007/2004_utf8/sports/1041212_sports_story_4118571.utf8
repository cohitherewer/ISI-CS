The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Bagan panel exonerates ?keeper Pal

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: A special panel, constituted by Mohun Bagan club to look into the Federation Cup final incidents leading to Cristiano Junior?s death, viewed the recordings of Sunday?s match at the Sree Kanteerava Stadium in Bangalore and was convinced that goalkeeper Subrata Pal is not to blame for the tragedy. 

The panel consisted of the three special officers (Shyamal Sen, Indrajit Sen and G.N. Roy), ex-IFA joint secretary Ranjit Gupta, former referee L.N. Ghosh, coach Subrata Bhattacharya and three club officials. 

The panel, after watching the CD, agreed unanimously that referee M. Balu didn?t play his role perfectly in the final. ?We had already lodged an official complaint against the referee stating that several crucial decisions went against us? the AIFF?s decision to suspend him vindicates our stand,? said a Mohun Bagan official. 

Goalkeeper Pal?s reply to the suspension letter, as well as Mohun Bagan?s detailed letter on biased refereeing, are being worked out by the panel and will be sent to the AIFF in the next three-four days.

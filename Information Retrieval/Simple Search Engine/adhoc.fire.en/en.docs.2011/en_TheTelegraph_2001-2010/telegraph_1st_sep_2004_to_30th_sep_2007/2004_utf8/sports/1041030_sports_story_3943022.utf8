 IOC happy with Beijing preparations 

Beijing: The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said on Friday preparations for the 2008 Games in Beijing were on track and played down suggestions that China?s emphasis on frugality would compromise events venues. 

By 2008, Beijing expects to spend $37 billion for the Games, including $2 billion on venues, but there has been controversy over the cost of the venues and the city has halted construction on its showpiece 100,000-seat stadium. 

?Frugal Games are not a concern for us,? Hein Verbruggen, chairman of the IOC co-ordination commission told a news conference following three days of meetings with the Beijing Organising Committee. (Reuters)

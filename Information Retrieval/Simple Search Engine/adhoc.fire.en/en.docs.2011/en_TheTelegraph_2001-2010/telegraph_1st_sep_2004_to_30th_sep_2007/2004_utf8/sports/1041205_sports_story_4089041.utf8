The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Chelsea win big; United cruise

London: Chelsea maintained their drive for their first title for 50 years when they thrashed Newcastle United 4-0 at Stamford Bridge Saturday to stay five points clear of Arsenal at the top of the Premier League. 

Chelsea briefly led the table by eight points after kicking off early but the status quo returned at the top when Arsenal beat Birmingham City 3-0 at Highbury, Everton beat Bolton Wanderers 3-2 at Goodison Park and Manchester United beat Southampton 3-0 at Old Trafford. 

With 16 matches played, Chelsea lead the standings with 39 points followed by Arsenal (34), Everton (33) and Manchester United (30). 

It took Chelsea more than an hour to make the breakthrough against Newcastle, who have won only twice at Stamford Bridge in the last 50 years and were beaten there 5-0 last season. 

There was only going to be one outcome after Frank Lampard put Chelsea ahead in the 63rd minute with a volley after chesting down a header by Didier Drogba. Drogba doubled the tally after 69 minutes after being set up by a 30m pass by Lampard and goals from Arjen Robben (89) and Mateja Kezman with a stoppage-time penalty, completed the rout. 

Arsenal had things almost as easy at Highbury where they beat Birmingham thanks to goals from Robert Pires and Thierry Henry, who scored twice in the last 10 minutes to take his tally for the season to 16.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

Sans spin, India tour is not on

Neutral View

It was a hard-earned and well-deserved victory for 

India at the Eden on Thursday. Pre-series expectations were that India will clinch 

it 2-0. But South Africa, through discipline, planning and sheer dedication, managed 

to draw the first Test in Kanpur and took the second Test to the fifth day.

It?s the first series win for India in India since 

2002. The hosts leave for a series in Bangladesh soon, where the Indian batsmen 

must use the time for some quality batting practice and indulge in some aggressive 

mode of play. The away tour will take some pressure off the Indians and they can 

then ruminate on where they have been going wrong in recent times, because all 

the top six batsmen ? with the exception of Virender Sehwag ? have not achieved 

much success.

The South Africans surprised. The new coach, Ray Jennings, 

has made a huge difference. I can?t believe the dramatic change the team has undergone 

in this short period. They served proudly. 

However, they should have come down to the sub-continent 

with some specialist spinners. 

Look at the statistics that the South Africans have 

generated on their recent sub-continental tours. They were in Sri Lanka in August, 

and of the two Tests the managed to draw one, losing the other. They lost all 

the ODIs in that series.

They were in Pakistan September-October last year 

and of the two Tests, lost one and drew the other. In this instance, though, they 

won the ODI series 3-2. 

What I am trying to say is that to purchase success 

from sub-continental wickets you need spinners, very good ones. That?s most. South 

Africa?s Nicky Boje is a decent turner, but he isn?t here for whatever reasons. 

And the current team is left without a decent spinner. That is not done.

Yet they did chase, more than what was anticipated. 

Of special mention is, of course, Jacques Kallis, Andrew Hall?s performance in 

the first Test and Zander de Bruyn. De Bruyn should have made his place in the 

team for some time to come, I believe.

Harbhajan Singh rightfully deserves the Man of the 

Match award. His has been a remarkable record in terms of five-wicket hauls and 

success at the Eden.

Sehwag has been outstanding for quite some time and 

has been rightly selected as the Man of the Series. His batting is like a breath 

of fresh air in this Indian line-up where others also need to demonstrate a bit 

of Sehwag-like aggression.

I have spent a lot of time in this country recently, 

and there is just one word I am able to say about the cricket here ? intriguing. 

The Indians? passion for the game does not cease to amaze me and I look forward 

to coming back to this country soon.

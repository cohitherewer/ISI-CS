 IN THE CITY

 Eden Gardens may host an under-19 ?Test? between India and England in January. 

 It has been learnt that the England under-19 side will play a full series in India and CAB is trying to host one of the ?Tests?. A one-dayer between them may also be hosted in Siliguri. 

 Meanwhile, in another development, the CAB will convey their resentment to the BCCI about the ?unplayable conditions? in which the Bengal-Gujarat Ranji Trophy Elite group A match was held in Siliguri. 

 ?The last day of the match went on till about five o?clock, when the ball was not being sighted properly. We are studying the manager?s report and planning to complain to the BCCI on that incident,? CAB secretary Bablu Kolay said on Friday. 

 Manoj Khanna and Neil D?Souza reached the men?s handicap singles 

quarter finals in the floodlit hardcourt tennis meet being held at Saturday Club 

on Friday. 

 Also joining them in the last eight stage were Jaffer Nayeem, Sukanta Roy and Rohit Kumar. 

 CRICKET: Ranji Elite group A match ? Bengal vs Mumbai ? Day I at JU campus ground, Salt Lake, from 9 am. 

TENNIS: Floodlit hardcourt meet ? Men?s open singles qualifiers

 India to play for pride

 - Pak may field a few rookies 

 Tirkey?s absence has been a big blow 

Hyderabad: Having already lost the friendship hockey series 1-4, India will now look to play for pride and try to finish their campaign on a winning note in the last match against Pakistan to be played under floodlights on Sunday. 

The conditions at the Gachibowli complex here will be ideal for a game of hockey as against the matches so far, which have been played in mid-afternoon under a blazing sun. 

Indians are a dejected lot, their misery being compounded by the freak injury to their inspirational captain Dilip Tirkey, who is virtually ruled out of the last match as well. 

Tirkey was forced to watch the action from the sidelines following a blow he took on the chin in the opening match of the Indian leg in New Delhi, which resulted in a hairline fracture. 

Although the team management admitted that Tirkey?s absence forced a change in the game plan in Chandigarh and Amritsar, it declined to treat it as an excuse for the team?s failure to win matches. 

?Tirkey?s absence is a big blow as he was central to our plan of things. But that should not be an excuse. 

?We got so many chances to score in the last two matches, but failed to take advantage of those. That mattered in the end,? assistant coach Jagbir Singh said. 

With the series under their belt, Pakistan are likely to experiment in Sunday?s game, including fielding a few rookie players ahead of December?s Champions Trophy. 

Pakistan captain Wasim Ahmed said his team would not take the last rubber lightly. 

?We are happy to win the series with one match to go. But that does not mean we will be taking the last game lightly,? he said. 

?We will field some new players so that they can gain some experience. With the Champions Trophy coming, we want to have a bigger player pool and this series is our last chance towards achieving that,? he added. 

The teams are likely to have some practice at the hockey complex on Saturday and the match, despite being of academic interest, has evoked much response in general public. 

The state hockey association has made elaborate arrangements for the smooth conduct of the game and security measures have also been beefed up in and around the Gachibowli sports complex, where the match begins at 8.00 pm. 

The venue will be hosting an Indo-Pak tie for the third time, having already staged clashes between the arch-rivals last year when both the sides played each other twice in the Afro-Asian Games. 

Four Olympians each from the two countries ? Aktar Rasol, Jahangir Butt, Islahuddin Siddiqui and Samiullah Khan of Pakistan, and India?s Ajit Pal Singh, B.P. Govinda, S.S. Sodhi and Aslam Sher Khan ? would be felicitated after the match, that will pull the curtains on the first series between the Asian giants in five years.

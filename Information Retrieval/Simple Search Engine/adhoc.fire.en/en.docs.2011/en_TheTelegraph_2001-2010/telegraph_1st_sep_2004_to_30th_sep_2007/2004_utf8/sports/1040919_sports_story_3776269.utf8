 Chanu case is ?open and shut? 

 New Delhi: The two-member inquiry committee probing the Olympic dope scandal has found the case of one of the tainted lifters Sanamacha Chanu ?open and shut? as her B sample test had also returned positive. 

The committee, which has almost completed its report, has not drawn any conclusive evidence against the other lifter Pratima Kumari as her B sample is yet to be tested. 

?All I can say is that the case involving Chanu is open and shut. Her A and B samples have tested positive. She had appeared before the commission and given her side of the story. We have taken all the aspects into account,? the chairman of the commission, K.P. Singh Deo said on Saturday. 

Dr Manmohan Singh, the medical commission chairman, is the other member of the inquiry team. 

Deo said Chanu has tested positive for the banned diuretic furosemide and had also appeared before the International Olympic Committee (IOC) medical commission on August 19. She was given a hearing before the verdict was made public and she was asked to return her diploma of participation in the Olympics. 

?In the case of Pratima Kumari, her A sample has tested positive for testosterone but the B sample is expected to be tested on September 20. If there is a variation in both the samples, the procedure will be different,? he said. 

?The process for testosterone is different. It can take up to three months before the result of her B sample is known. It is an elaborate process and her drug record in the past three months would also be taken into account,? he said. 

Asked whether he would be submitting his report to the Indian Olympic Association president Suresh Kalmadi by Saturday?s deadline, Deo said: ?We have almost completed the report. It is just a matter of compiling everything. 

?We got very good co-operation from all the people who deposed before the commission but we would have been happy if the foreign coach Leonid Taranenko could have deposed before us after he returned to India,? he said. 

He said the panel had started the work in Athens itself and had summoned the two weightlifting coaches ? Pal Singh Sandhu and Taranenko for deposition. 

?Since the coaches were in Athens then, we had got their versions. The two lifters and top officials of the IWF were called to depose before the commission in India,? he said.

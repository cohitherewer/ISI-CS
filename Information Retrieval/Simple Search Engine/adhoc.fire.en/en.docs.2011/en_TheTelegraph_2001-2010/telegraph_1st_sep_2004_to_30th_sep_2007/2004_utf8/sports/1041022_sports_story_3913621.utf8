 United ring changes again

 SAM WALLACE IN MANCHESTER 

 Neville terms prospect of defeat ?unthinkable? 

The prospect of defeat to Arsenal on Sunday was so far from Gary Neville?s mind on Tuesday night that the Manchester United full-back was moved to describe it as ?unthinkable?. 

Unthinkable in the sense that his club treat any home defeat as intolerable, whether it is inflicted by the Premiership champions or not. But even before United struggled to a goalless draw against Sparta Prague this week, the really unthinkable aspect of defeat to Arsenal was that their greatest problem could yet come from within. 

They may be finally injury-free, but United will field yet another changed side this weekend for the 15th time this season. Even Ferguson has made no secret of the fact that he would rather have started the season with an unchanged team ? ?maybe at the moment I am making too many changes?, he said on Monday ? but on Sunday it will be inevitable. 

He has not fielded the same line-up for two consecutive games this season and against Arsenal he will have to accommodate Rio Ferdinand, Roy Keane and Cristiano Ronaldo in the side. ?I don?t care what other people think of our chances, I know there will be 11 United players going out there to do the best they can and 11 Arsenal players thinking the same,? Neville said. 

 ?Hopefully we can try to put doubts in their minds. We know they can win the league, but they know that we are the team that can win it if they don?t. It is very even. They are both clubs of great tradition who play the right way.? 

It is unthinkable not to win any game at Old Trafford. There is no way that should change because Arsenal are coming. That?s the way United have been for 70 or 80 years, not just the last 12.? 

Even before the Sparta game there was suggestions from within the United camp that some players who had found themselves bouncing in and out of the starting line-up had privately expressed disquiet at the strategy. The feeling was that there was little instinct within the squad, especially among more recent signings, about the habits of teammates and the kind of runs and decisions they were likely to make. 

The front two for United have changed nine times since the Community Shield defeat to Arsenal, and one of Ferguson?s biggest decisions will be whether he sticks with Wayne Rooney, who looked only little better than his last start against Middlesbrough. 

Mikael Silvestre has missed just one match all season, but his form of late might also warrant consideration. ?There is no more pressure on us, every game at Old Trafford over the last 11 years we have had to win,? Neville said. ?There is no score to settle after last year. All we have to do is win. 

?We are not going to be thinking about what happened last year, five years ago, 10 years ago. We just have to go and win a game in front of our own fans and pick up three points whether it is Arsenal or whoever.?

 Hall leads from the top as SA battle hard

 - FIRST TEST 

- Kumble scalps all four on Day I 

Kanpur: The inexperienced South Africans proved they were no push-overs as they launched a spirited fightback after a mid-innings jolt and kept themselves afloat in the first Test against India here on Saturday. 

Andrew Hall, opening the innings for the first time in Tests, played the sheet anchor?s role to perfection with a gritty unbeaten 78, and guided the visitors to a comfortable 230 for four at stumps on a good batting strip at the Green Park Stadium. This was Hall?s third Test half century. 

The make-shift opener had raised 61 for the opening stand with skipper Graeme Smith (37) in the morning and then added 85 with the experienced Jacques Kallis, who also made 37. Hall has faced 274 balls and struck nine fours. 

Boeta Dippenaar was giving him company with a cautious 46 after Anil Kumble had done the damage for the hosts by snapping up two wickets, each in the pre and post-lunch sessions. 

The veteran leg spinner provided the vital breakthroughs by evicting captain Graeme Smith (37) and Matin Van Jaarsveld (2) just before lunch and then dramatically removing Jacques Kallis (37) and Jacques Rudolph (0) off consecutive deliveries just before tea. He picked up the wickets for 54 runs. 

Both Hall and Dippenaar ensured that there were no further setbacks for the visitors as they defied the Indian spinners to remain unseparated in the last session. 

The pair has already stitched 76 runs for the unfinished fifth wicket stand, allowing the Proteas to bounce back after being 154 for four at one stage. 

After winning the toss the South Africans began well on the much-speculated Green Park track. The two openers Smith and Hall provided a solid start to the innings as they played cautiously to the Indian new ball operators Zaheer Khan and Sourav Ganguly, who failed make any impression. 

With the Indians opting for three specialist spinners, Sourav had to share the new ball with Zaheer. 

South Africa, rated the underdogs for the two-Test series, owed much to Hall. 

The all-rounder, asked to open after Herschelle Gibbs pulled out of the tour, showed soft hands to tackle spin. 

Hall and Smith seemed set to see off the morning without any setbacks when Kumble, introduced as early as in the tenth over, broke through. 

Smith, reprieved on 33 when ?keeper Dinesh Karthik dropped a tough bat-pad chance against Harbhajan Singh, then watched in dismay as the ball squeezed under his defensive shot to hit off-stump. 

Kallis, playing only as a batsman because of a painful side injury, joined Hall to steady the innings. 

The all-rounder completed 6,000 Test runs on 31, becoming only the second South African batsman behind Gary Kirsten to achieve the milestone. 

But Kumble trapped Kallis with a straighter ball going for a sweep and then removed Rudolph to be on a hattrick. 

Hall was dropped on 55 by Kumble at midwicket off Harbhajan, but kept his focus alongside Dippenaar as the pair frustrated the flagging Indian bowling attack until stumps. (AGENCIES)

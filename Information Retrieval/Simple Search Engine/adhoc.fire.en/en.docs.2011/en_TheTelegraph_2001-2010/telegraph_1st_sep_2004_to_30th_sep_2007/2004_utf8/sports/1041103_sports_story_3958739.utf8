The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Unimpressive TFA go down to JCT

A CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Thin wins marked the second day at the 117th Durand Cup here Tuesday. In group B Sporting Clube de Goa scraped past Army XI 1-0, before, in group D, JCT Phagwara, ousted TFA 2-0. 

The only goal of the lacklustre match came in the 65th minute. Services stopper R. Ramesh handled the ball in the penalty area and Nigerian Dudu Omagbemi converted the resultant penalty kick. 

TFA did not impress, despite having some junior internationals in their ranks. The cohesion and skills one associates with TFA were missing. Only ?keeper Shilton Paul and midfielders L. Mark Fernandez and Naoba Singh played well. 

In the 73rd minute, JCT?s Manjit Singh (Jr) sent a powerful shot from top of the box. It was parried by Shilton, but the TFA defence failed to clear and onrushing midfielder Sukhjinder Singh squared to Manjit who flicked in. 

In added time, hardworking midfielder Baldeep Singh surged down the right and gave a reverse pass to substitute Hardeep Gill who placed in. 

Wednesday?s matches: Mohun Bagan vs Assam Rifles; Salgaocar vs BSF.

 Moscow: Lindsay Davenport will take over the No. 1 spot from Amelie Mauresmo when the rankings are released next week after reaching the Kremlin Cup quarter finals with a 6-4, 6-2 win over Dinara Safina on Thursday. 

 The American, who trailed Mauresmo by 15 points at the start of the week, only needed to win her opening match in Moscow to take the top spot. 

 Davenport brushed aside the younger sister of 2000 US Open champion Marat Safin in their second round match in 86 minutes. 

 France?s Mauresmo withdrew from the $2.3 million tournament after injuring her left thigh in last Sunday?s Grand Prix final in Filderstadt against Davenport.

 Melbourne: Men?s world No. 4 Guillermo Coria and women?s world No. 2 Lindsay Davenport head the field for January?s Hopman Cup, a prelude to the Australian Open later in the month.

 Davenport will partner James Blake for the second seeded US in the mixed team event scheduled for Perth from January 1-8, Hopman Cup tournament director Paul McNamee said in a statement on Thursday. 

 Davenport and Blake led the United States to a successful Hopman Cup defence and a record third title in January this year. French Open runner-up Coria will combine with Giselle Dulko for fourth-seeded Argentina. 

 Russia will be represented by Anastasia Myskina and Marat Safin, while Mark Philippoussis and Alicia Molik will represent the hosts. Dominik Hrbaty and Daniela Hantuchova will play for third seeds Slovak Republic.

 Berlin: The grave of the mother of Formula One drivers Michael and Ralf Schumacher has been desecrated, authorities said on Thursday. 

 The grave was dug open in the Kerpen-Manheim cemetery on Wednesday night, police in the western town of Kerpen said.

 They said the coffin had not been opened. Elisabeth Schumacher died in April 2003 at the age of 55.

 In April, Germany?s Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper reported that Manheim, the village on the edge of Kerpen where the brothers grew up, would be demolished to make way for an open-cast coal mine and that its 1,700 residents would have to be moved along with its graveyard.

 New Delhi: Abhinn Shyam Gupta defeated Jan Vondra of the Czech Republic to reach the third round of the German Open badminton tournament played in Duisberg on Thursday. Among the other Indian?s in the fray, national women?s champion Aparna Popat moved into the second round while Nikhil Kanetkar and Arvind Bhat bowed out in the first and second round respectively, according to information received here. Gupta, seeded 16th, was given a run for his money by Vondra but finally prevailed 15-13, 15-13 to set up a clash with eighth seed Shoji Sato of Japan for a place in the quarter finals. 

 Bhat failed to keep the momentum going after upsetting 14th seed Hui Yen of Singapore in the first round and lost 1-15, 4-15 to Tooru Matsumoto of Japan in the second. Kanetkar was beaten 15-5, 15-3 by Keishi Kwaguchi of Japan.

 Glasgow: Scotland manager Bertie Vogts has been backed by the Scottish FA despite his team?s hopes of World Cup qualification having been all but dashed. ?We?re not in the market to be looking for a manager,? said David Taylor, the Scottish FA chief executive who was behind the decision to appoint Vogts to replace Craig Brown in March 2002. Newspapers have demanded the sacking of Vogts, who was verbally abused by fans after a 1-1 draw in Moldova on Wednesday left his team with just two points from three matches. 

 Scotland drew 0-0 with Slovenia and lost 1-0 to Norway at home in their opening group V qualifiers but failure to beat a side ranked 113th in the Fifa standings saw Vogts mauled. 

 New Delhi: Weightlifter Pratima Kumari on Thursday filed a petition in the high court challenging the life ban imposed on her by the Indian Olympic Association.

 ?We have filed a petition against the ban imposed on her for taking performance enhancing drugs,? her counsel Sushil Salwan said. Pratima was banned for life along with two other lifters ? Sanamacha Chanu and S. Sunaina ? by the IOA last month after an inquiry headed by K.P. Singh Deo. 

 Coach Pal Singh Sandhu was also slapped with a life ban. Pratima had tested positive for testosterone during the Athens Olympics in August.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Becks wins it for Real

 - Arsenal extend record unbeaten run to 45 matches 

 Roberto Carlos congratulates David Beckham after the latter scored from a free-kick on Saturday 

Madrid: A classy free-kick from Real Madrid?s David Beckham and smart goals from Barcelona new boys Ludovic Giuly and Henrik Larsson allowed both teams to maintain their 100 per cent records in the Primera Liga. 

The England captain sent the ball sailing over the wall and then dipping sharply into the far corner from 23 metres to give Real a 1-0 win over promoted Numancia. 

French midfielder Giuly paved the way for Barcelona?s authoritative 2-0 victory over Sevilla at a rain-sodden Nou Camp with his second goal in two games when his sharp close-range shot deflected off the ?keeper and into the goal 10 minutes before halftime. 

Former Celtic striker Larsson opened his account for the Catalans with a well-taken second, bursting into the area to volley home a fine cross from Portugal midfielder Deco midway through the second half. 

In the Premier League, champions Arsenal extended their record unbeaten run to 45 games with a 3-0 win at Fulham but title rivals Chelsea were held 0-0 at Aston Villa and Manchester United scraped a 2-2 draw at Bolton Wanderers. 

Arsenal lived dangerously in the first half but floored Fulham with a three-goal blast in 10 minutes, courtesy of Fredrik Ljungberg, a Zat Knight own goal and one from Spanish substitute Jose Antonio Reyes. 

Victory left Arsenal two points clear at the top after Chelsea lost their 100 percent record, with boss Jose Mourinho furious at referee Rob Styles for refusing his team a penalty and booking his Ivory Coast striker Didier Drogba for diving. 

United continued a faltering start to the season and were heading for defeat after Les Ferdinand got Bolton?s second in the 90th minute, only for an Alan Smith effort to go in off David Bellion in stoppage time. 

Liverpool cruised to a 3-0 win over West Bromwich Albion, Alan Shearer scored once as Newcastle United beat Blackburn Rovers 3-0 and Middlesbrough were 2-1 winners over Birmingham City. 

Arsenal rode their luck in the first half, with referee Mark Halsey initially awarding Fulham a penalty for an Ashley Cole challenge on Andy Cole before reversing his decision, having consulted his linesman after Arsenal protests. Fulham forward Collins John then had a goal disallowed, though Arsenal also had a spot-kick appeal turned down.

 Atherton rues Sachin absence

London: Sachin Tendulkar should have been included in the ICC announced Test Team of the Year in place of West Indies captain Brian Lara, former England captain Michael Atherton has said. 

Atherton, writing in a newspaper column, favoured two more changes to the World XI ? Andrew Flintoff and Muttiah Muralidharan in place of Jacques Kallis and Chaminda Vaas, respectively. 

?Sachin Tendulkar should have been included in the prestigious team instead of Brian Lara. There has since been some fierce criticism of the World XIs,? Atherton wrote. 

?I would have both Murali and Shane Warne in my Test team of the year, making just three changes to the official XI.? 

The former captain praised Rahul Dravid for winning the International Cricketer of the Year award and said his triumph proved ?that unassuming, nice guys can come first?. 

The ICC awards also saw Irfan Pathan being adjudged the Emerging Player of the Year. England allrounder Andrew Flintoff bagged the ODI Player of the Year beating Sachin Tendulkar who missed the function owing to an appointment with a leading radiologist.

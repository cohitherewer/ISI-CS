The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Injured Langer doubtful

 - Boxing Day Test

 - Katich asked to stand by 

 Langer has ?severe? back pain 

Melbourne: Australian opener Justin Langer has a 50 per cent chance of playing in the Boxing Day Test against Pakistan after injuring his back, team physiotherapist Errol Alcott said on Thursday. 

Langer was hurt while bending to pick up a ball during practice at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Thursday. A scan revealed a bulging disc. 

He had ?very severe back pain?, Alcott told newsmen, adding: ?It?s 50 per cent he might play, 50 per cent he might not play. But it?s just a bit too early (to say) at this stage. 

?He?s in bed and not feeling very good.? 

Langer is Test cricket?s leading scorer in 2004 with 1,426 runs, including five centuries. 

The 34-year-old left-hander was Man of the Match after scoring 191 and 97 in last week?s first Test win over Pakistan in Perth. 

New South Wales captain Simon Katich has been asked to stand by. 

?It is expected that if Justin can?t play, then Simon will open the batting with Matthew Hayden,? chairman of selectors Trevor Hohns said in a statement. 

?He is a versatile batsman and a quality player who can bat in a variety of positions.? 

Katich, who normally bats in the middle-order, will train with the Australian team in Melbourne on Friday. 

He missed Australia?s two home Test wins over New Zealand last month and the first Test against Pakistan after failing in the final Test against India in Mumbai last month.

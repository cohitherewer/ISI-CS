 London: Greek sprinters Costas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou have been charged by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) for missing drugs tests at August?s Athens Olympics. Their coach Christos Tzekos has also been charged with distributing prohibited substances.

 A statement on the IAAF website said the governing body?s Doping Review Board had concluded that evidence exists that the three committed doping violations. The trio have until December 16 to respond to the charges and if their explanations are rejected, they will be provisionally suspended pending a hearing before a disciplinary tribunal of the Greek Federation. 

 San Francisco: The head of the BALCO lab charged with distributing steroids to top athletes vowed on Wednesday to tell all in an upcoming television interview as defense lawyers in the case privately expressed dismay. 

 Also on Wednesday, US district court Judge Susan Illston said she was inclined to reject defense motions to dismiss charges against BALCO head Victor Conte and three others, although she would allow some hearings into how the government conducted the case.

 The judge spoke at a pre-trial hearing at which Conte?s lawyer Robert Holley said he did not know in advance that Conte had granted an interview to the ABC News magazine 20/20. 

 London: International Olympic Committee (IOC) chief Jacques Rogge has called for an end to the ?bickering? between the cities seeking to host the 2012 Games. ?I would ask them to focus on their own bid, stop looking at what the others are doing and stop bickering and accusing each other,? the IOC president said. London, Paris, Madrid, New York and Moscow remain in the race for the Games.

 London: Red Bull Racing owner Dietrich Mateschitz has given a fresh boost to David Coulthard?s hopes of staying in Formula One next year.

 After saying last week that the out-of-work Scot was still of interest to his team, the Austrian energy drink billionaire praised Coulthard in British weekly Autosport magazine on Thursday.

 ?I personally believe that he?s one of the brightest characters in F1,? said Mateschitz during a flying visit to a team test at the Barcelona circuit last week. ?What our team needs now is experience, because it?s difficult for us to have two rookies only.?

 Mateschitz bought the Jaguar team from Ford last month and has renamed it Red Bull Racing. 

 Tokyo: Argentine Osvaldo Ardiles is poised to sign an extended contract as manager of Tokyo Verdy, officials of the Japanese club said on Thursday.

 The former Tottenham Hotspur and Newcastle United coach will sign a deal keeping him at Verdy until January 2006 despite limited success at the club.

 2 warriors going at each other: Langer 

 Justin Langer shares a joke with Yusuf Youhana, moments after his altercation with Shoaib Akhtar at the MCG on Monday 

Melbourne: Australian opening batsman Justin Langer said he relishes his hair-raising duels with Pakistan express bowler Shoaib Akhtar after the pair?s verbal dust-up at the Boxing Day Test here on Monday. 

Shoaib launched into the little left-hander in one explosive over before tea with Langer taking apparent exception when Shoaib appeared to spit in his direction. 

The Pakistani spearhead then thundered down two bouncers and the pair exchanged words and fierce looks as Shoaib advanced down the pitch to within a few metres of Langer who was Man of the Match with scores of 191 and 97 in the Perth Test. 

But Langer, who scored 50 in Australia?s 203 for five in reply to Pakistan?s 341, later revealed there was no enmity between the pair, saying it was ?just two warriors going at each other.? 

?It?s great, isn?t it? For me, that?s why you play the game,? the 34-year-old batsman said. 

?As I said to (umpire) Rudi Koertzen, there was nothing malicious about it; it?s just like two warriors going at each other. 

?A bloke?s bowling 150 kmph, trying to rip the fingers off your arms, or probably even worse. 

?It gets your blood going, the adrenaline is pumping, you?re in a fight ? to me that?s what Test cricket is all about.? 

Langer revels in his new-ball battles with the Rawalpindi Express. 

?For me, it?s one of the great battles in Test cricket playing against Shoaib Akhtar. 

?Today I reckon he bowled as fast as I?ve seen him bowl in all our confrontations. 

?I?ve always said he?s the fastest bowler I?ve ever faced and I reckon today, besides an over or two he bowled at the WACA four years ago, it was as quick as I?ve faced for a long time,? Langer said. 

Langer, who is Test cricket?s leading scorer this year with 1,476 runs, was upset with himself getting out for 50 when he top-edged a sweep at leg-spinner Danish Kaneria and skied a catch to Imran Farhat at backward square leg. 

?I was just grumpy with myself for making a mental error; you should never mess with form, I was disappointed with that,? he said. 

?I was very keen to improve my consistency this year ? over the last few years, I felt I?d played some exceptional innings but in between times there?s probably been some lean trots. 

?I?ve also aimed to improve my second-innings performances from probably the last couple of years. 

?I think I?ve definitely improved my consistency. I?m a lot more balanced.?

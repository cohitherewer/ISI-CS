The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Amalgam of strength, skill and honesty

 HENRY WINTER 

 Rooney is just a kid with a ball eager to score

Amid the whirlwind of plaudits for Wayne Rooney, the praise for his technique, finishing and instinctive link-ups with Ruud van Nistelrooy, one especially welcome quality spiced his spectacular debut for Manchester United on Tuesday night at Old Trafford. Rooney was having fun out there. He has brought a whiff of the playground spirit back into the overly earnest world of modern football. 

Part of Rooney?s remarkable appeal, one that United will profit from on and off the pitch, is that the teenager radiates spontaneity and adventure. No fear of losing restrained the teenager?s approach to dismantling Fenerbahce?s defence. No caution inhibited his play. Rooney is not just a breath of fresh air. He is a hurricane. 

People talk about all the pressure Rooney is under, the difficulties of making a debut for such an illustrious club, and having to justify a ?27-million price-tag. But why? Sometimes we complicate football too much. Rooney cut through all the theorising to remind us that he is just a kid with a ball eager to score, whether growing up on the streets of Liverpool or coming of age on Europe?s grandest stages. 

No wonder United?s marketing men were all smiles afterwards. Their new signing fascinates all ages. To children, Rooney resembles a cartoon hero lashing in goals for fun. Adults appreciate his technique. To more senior members of society, Rooney represents a throwback to the straightforward days of Nat Lofthouse. Skill, strength and honesty: the real deal. 

Of course, flaws could be detected, notably an occasional over-zealousness in the tackle that could bring censure from more alert officials. One challenge on Baris Deniz, the Fenerbahce defender, bordered on the spiteful. A childish streak is inevitably present, witnessed when Rooney crashed the ball out for a corner, unnecessarily so. Fenerbahce quickly pinched a second goal in their 2-6 defeat. 

Yet United?s manager Alex Ferguson, made a smart point when he observed that Rooney does not need coaching. Like Paul Gascoigne, the Merseysider is a natural thoroughbred, a Nijinsky in boots. Again echoing Gazza in his playing days, what Rooney needs most is work on keeping his weight down, not lifting his technical levels up. 

?With the way he runs at players, Wayne has that same bullish look about him that Gazza had when he came through as a youngster,? said David Beckham.

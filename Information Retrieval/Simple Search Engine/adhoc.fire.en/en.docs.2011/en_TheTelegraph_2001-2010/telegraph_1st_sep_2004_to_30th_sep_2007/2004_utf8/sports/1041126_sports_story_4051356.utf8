 Star Angel set to claim the Guineas 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Friday?s race card is packed with major events like the Calcutta 1,000 Guineas, the Mayfowl Cup and the RCGC 175th Anniversary Trophy. The first two are terms events while the last, a Class II race, is the RCTC?s way of honouring one of the oldest golf clubs in the world in its 175th anniversary.

 However, the Guineas and the anniversary event are going to be mere formality for the two highly rated horses ? Star Angel and Approved.

 Star Angel had beaten the city?s champion horse, Calorific, in her preparatory run here early this month. Further, a line through Amazing Velocity, makes the Daniel David-trainee invincible against Autocop. B. Prakash partners the Placerville-Amazing Princess filly.

 Approved is going from strength-to-strength. The Vijay Singh-trainee is all set to make it three in-a-row in the hands of jockey C. Alford.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

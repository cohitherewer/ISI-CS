Calcutta: Paolo Roberto da Silva, it seemed, must have chosen a bad day to script his biggest achievement so far in India. He scored a hattrick and inspired East Bengal to a 4-0 demolition of Tollygunge Agragami at the Kalyani municipal stadium on Tuesday. 

East Bengal thus displaced Mohun Bagan by a point on top of the CFL Super Division table with 36 points from 16 matches. Tollygunge remained on 26 after 17 matches. 

But the Brazilian?s efforts and East Bengal?s elevation to the top receded in the background as the resumption of the CFL Super Division saw the return of Sasthi Duley and Dipankar Roy (who scored his team?s final goal) to football action after spending over a week behind bars. 

Sasthi entered the field after captain Shylo Malsawmtluanga and Madhab Das to an allround applause. He stayed for 36 minutes and came close to scoring at least on two occasions. Just on the stroke of half-time, Paolo scored and the whole complexion of the game changed. The Brazilian, who scored twice in the last time his team played at the ground (a 4-1 rout of Mohammedan Sporting in an IFA Shield match), chased the ball as soon as Chandan?s long-ranger got deflected off Isiaka Awoyemi and fell in the no-man?s land. Paolo deftly placed in past the onrushing Arindam?s left. 

The lead was eventually extended in the 69th minute. Paolo brilliantly played a one-two with his captain to set himself free into the box. He dribbled past one defender and slotted home coolly avoiding Arindam?s challenge. 

Adding further blows to Tollygunge, Isiaka pulled a hamstring and left the field in the 71st minute. As Tollygunge completed all their substitutions, they had to fight with ten men. 

The hattrick eventually came in the 89th minute Malsawmtluanga again fed Paolo into the box. He dodged past Arindam and completed the formality in style. Dipankar, by that time, was waiting along the touchline to come into the field. He got two chances, he missed first and achieved too many things with the second.

 Whistle-blower in ZCU 

Harare: The former chief executive of the Zimbabwe Cricket Union (ZCU) is all set to drop a bombshell into the International Cricket Council?s (ICC) investigation on racism within the sport in the country. 

Vincent Hogg will inform the ICC?s investigators ? Indian solicitor-general Goolam Vahanvati and justice Steven Majiedt ? this week about several incidents involving black ZCU directors. 

These were the main reasons he left the job two months ago after two-and-a-half years at the helm, he claimed. (AFP)

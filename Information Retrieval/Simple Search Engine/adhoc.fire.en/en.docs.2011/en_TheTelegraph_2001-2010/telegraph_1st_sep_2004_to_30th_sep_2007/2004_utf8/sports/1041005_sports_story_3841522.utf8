 Club confirms ?preliminary approach?

London: Manchester United, the world?s wealthiest football club, confirmed on Monday they have received a ?preliminary approach? regarding a possible takeover bid. 

It comes after weekend press reports suggested American multi-millionaire Malcolm Glazer, who holds a 19.2-percent stake in the club, was poised to launch a takeover bid for the English club, worth at least ?650 million. 

?The board of Manchester United Plc notes the recent press speculation,? the company said in a statement. ?It confirms that it has received a preliminary approach regarding a possible offer for the company. This approach contains a number of significant conditions. 

There was no immediate response from Glazer, owner of NFL franchise Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and the second-largest shareholder in United. 

Newspaper reports said on Sunday that Glazer had hired investment bank JP Morgan to advise him on a bid worth ?at least ?650 million?. 

Glazer was expected to seek the support of United?s major shareholders, Irish racing tycoons John Magnier and JP Mcmanus, the report said.

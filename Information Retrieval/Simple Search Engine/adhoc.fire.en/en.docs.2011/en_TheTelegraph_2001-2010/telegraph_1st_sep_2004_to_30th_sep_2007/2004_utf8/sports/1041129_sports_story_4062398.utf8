The Telegraph - Calcutta

Kallis ton couldn?t have been better-timed

Neutral View

Two very relieved gentlemen joined me pitch-side at 

the famous Eden Gardens ground for the toss Sunday morning: Sourav Ganguly, whose 

ICC appeal hearing was upheld, and Graeme Smith, who made rapid overnight improvement 

after having had a car run over his foot the previous day. In saying this, though, 

there was a different kind of tension and it had to do with the eternal importance 

of winning the toss in India and setting the pace with the bat.

Ganguly may need to look at a different coin-tossing 

technique, given that quite amazingly he has lost the last seven in a row. It 

is obviously a 50-50 situation, but does not seem this way for the Indian skipper 

at the moment. 

To be constantly informed you are going to do the 

opposite of what you would like, is not a good recipe for his team, particularly 

in India where batting first is crucial. This was a big factor during the recent 

Australian series.

One thing helping the skipper for this Test is the 

inclusion of Irfan Pathan at the expense of third spinner Murali Kartik, who was 

rightly selected for the Mumbai Test against Australia. Now with Pathan back, 

Ganguly has two quicks and two spinners, along with himself and Sachin to break 

things up. That?s much better balance, particularly if you keep losing the toss.

Pathan quickly made his presence known, grabbing the 

top edge of an attempted cut from Smith, who I feel was lured into a rash stroke 

because of unusual preparation due to his freak accident.

Zaheer Khan, sensing the return of Pathan ? the man 

who kept him out of the side for a short time ? backed up his opening partner 

and not to be outdone with the new ball, took the edge of a sparring Andrew Hall. 

This was a great start for both the left-arm quicks and immediate relief for Ganguly 

once again finding himself in the field on Day I.

One quality that certainly has not left the South 

Africans during a fairly inconsistent period is the will to fight. They very quickly 

repaired the early damage through an impressive and safe partnership of 109 between 

Jacques Kallis and Jacques Rudolph.

Rudolph, enjoying being back in his successful number 

three position, had his stumps removed by another well-targeted reverse-swinging 

delivery from Khan.

Pathan and Khan paired up nicely and made excellent 

use of the reverse movement, making batting quite difficult for the second half 

of the day. As always, it was hard for the new batsman to settle with this sort 

of movement alive.

Hashim Amla, with his distinct look and batting style, 

made what I thought was a steady start to his Test career, before being comprehensively 

bowled by Pathan for 24. Boeta Dippenaar then made a brief appearance until he 

misread an angled ball, which flicked the outside edge, and he too disappeared 

back to the pavilion without troubling the scorers too much.

The two Indian fast bowlers took all the wickets between 

them, but without a doubt, my hero of the day was Kallis. Kallis crafted his 17th 

Test century, first versus India, just when his team needed it most. He is one 

of the most consistent and talented campaigners on the world stage and the fact 

that he is still there, means South Africa can still amass a worthy first-innings 

total.

It was an intriguing first day of a Test match, which 

will have many twists and turns. I feel India?s nose is in front, but look out 

for South Africa. 

They have plenty of batting to come and the knowledge 

that the quicks are doing the damage for India will encourage them. These Calcutta 

conditions might just even things up.

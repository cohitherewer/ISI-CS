 Sport can unify people, says Coe

 - ?Politicians come and go, sport is a permanent fixture?

New Delhi: British double Olympic champion Sebastian Coe on Saturday said sports had a unifying ability and must not be used to meet cheap political ends. 

?I am always worried when sport is used in a way, in areas to do what the politicians want to do. It is very easy to use sport for cheap response, but it is a wrong vehicle,? said Coe who won back-to-back titles in the 1500m event in 1980 and 1984 Olympic Games. 

Coe, who is in the city as jury of appeal for the 13th world half marathon championships on Sunday, cited the India-Pakistan cricket series as an example of how sport could help bring people together. 

?Sport has the ability to unify, to help in situations of political complexity, as it helped between Pakistan and India through the re-implementation of cricket. Sport helps maintaining contacts, and when we stop sport, it creates a pressure for change. The last thing we want is countries being isolated. ?Politicians come and go, political systems come and go, sport is a permanent fixture,? he said. 

Coe is one of the greatest mile runners in athletics history. He broke a dozen world records in his career but is remembered more for defying Margaret Thatcher?s call for boycott of the 1980 Moscow Games. Athletics would always be indebted to Coe for that courageous act, because that Games and the next in Los Angeles witnessed the greatest rivalry on track, between him and Steve Covett, that made the mile an event of its own. 

In Moscow, Covett won the 800m, pushing Coe to second spot but the latter avenged the loss by winning the 1500m. A year later, the two swapped the world record thrice inside a week. After retaining his 1500m title in 1984, Coe turned his attention to sports administration and then mainstream politics, for which he had always had an interest even in his youth. Coming from a middle-class family, Coe got elected to the parliament as a conservative in 1992. But any ambition he nursed of becoming Prime Minister was nipped when he lost his seat five years later. He acted as chief of staff to William Hague who took over from John Major but Hague?s crushing defeat in the 2001 elections ended his political stint. 

Coe then returned to sports administration and is now on the IAAF council but more importantly the chairman of London?s bid committee for the 2012 Games. 

He turned 48 two days ago, but is slim and light on feet as he was 20 years ago. He still does his regular running on Sundays and will start the great Delhi run, a special event featuring celebrities and school kids from Delhi, on Sunday. Coe is believed to have played a crucial role in New Delhi winning the bid to host 2010 Commonwealth Games but his Indian connection runs deeper. 

His grandfather, Suraj Lal, was an Indian, as was his grandmother. He still has cousins in Delhi, including Julius Sen, former director of sports in the Union ministry. Talking of skyrocketing costs in hosting multi-disciplinary games, Coe said cities should look to build facilities that could not be returned as ?legacies? to the community. He pointed to the Pound report of 2000 under the guidelines of which bids for the 2012 Olympics and editions thereafter would be made. 

?Given my background, London would give paramount importance to the welfare of athletes, which lot of cities don?t do. The park (to come up in east London) with all the facilities will be close to the Games village, which would be about 15-20 minutes by train.? (PTI)

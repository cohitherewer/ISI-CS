The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Mumbai pacers dominate 

Mumbai: Debutant seamer Wilkin Mota grabbed three wickets as Madhya Pradesh struggled at 164 for seven on the opening day of their Ranji Trophy Elite Group A match against Mumbai on Tuesday. 

Mota, introduced as the third-change bowler by stand-in captain Vinod Kambli, grabbed his chance to finish at three for 21. 

Swapnil Hazare and another debutant seamer Santosh Shinde bagged two and one wickets, respectively, while Kambli took the other wicket to fall. 

The visitors lost their first wicket at 29 after being put in to bat. Their two most experienced batsmen, Devendra Bundela and Abbas Ali, departed in the space of five balls without opening their account. 

A 50-run stand for the second wicket between Naman Ojha (33) and captain Amay Khurasia (38) shored up the innings to an extent before they suffered a post-lunch slump.

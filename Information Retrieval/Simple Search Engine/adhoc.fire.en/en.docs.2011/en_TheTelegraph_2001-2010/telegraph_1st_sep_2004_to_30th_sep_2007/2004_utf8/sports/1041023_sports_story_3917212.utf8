 Laxman holds the key: Cairns

 Laxman 

Bangalore: Only V.V.S. Laxman can prevent a determined Australian team from conquering the ?final frontier?, believes dashing New Zealand allrounder Chris Cairns. 

Cairns says Laxman has been the difference between the two teams during the last two series and he would come back with guns blazing, having failed to click in the two Tests so far. 

?Between the two sides, his record in the last two series has been amazing and he is yet to score some runs. So, if the Aussies keep him quiet, they have a good shot (to win the series). Laxman is a wonderful player,? he told reporters on the sidelines of a promotional event here last night. 

But Cairns said it would be difficult for the Indians, trailing the four-match series 0-1, to stage a fightback as the Aussies were determined to break the jinx and register their first Test series victory on Indian soil in 35 years. (PTI)

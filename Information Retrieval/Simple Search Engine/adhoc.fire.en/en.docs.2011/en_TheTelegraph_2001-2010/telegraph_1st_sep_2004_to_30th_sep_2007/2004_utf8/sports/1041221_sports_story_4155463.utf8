The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Federer, Myskina best

London: Roger Federer, winner of three Grand Slams, and French Open champion Anastasia Myskina, who led Russia?s domination of the women?s game, are the 2004 world champions of tennis. 

Announcing the awards Monday, the International Tennis Federation said Federer was the overwhelming winner among the men with 11 titles in the year and an 18-0 record against the other players in the top 10. He had 74 match victories and six losses. 

Myskina, however, narrowly beat Amelie Mauresmo of France for the women?s honour. 

?Roger federer was the clear choice for the ITF world champion based on his extraordinary performance in 2004,? ITF president Ricco Bitti said of the 23-year-old Swiss who won the Australian and US Opens and held on to his Wimbledon title. ?The selection of Anastasia Myskina came down to her performance at the Olympic Games, where she reached the semi-final and her seven singles wins in Fed Cup in 2004.? 

Myskina became the first Russian woman to win a Grand Slam title when she beat countrywoman Elena Dementieva in the French Open final. (AP)

 Bangalore: Inconsolable teammates of Cristiano 

 de Lima Junior boarded the train for Goa on Monday night 

 after lodging a complaint of negligence against the Federation 

 Cup hosts, Karnataka State Football Association (KSFA). 

On the basis of Dempo?s complaint, the Bangalore City Police registered a case against KSFA on Monday. 

Police Commissioner S. Mariswamy told newsmen that the post-mortem report pointed at cardiac arrest, and not any physical injury. ?He died of cardiac arrest. He died on the spot,? he said. 

Junior?s body was flown Panjim by an Indian Airlines flight soon after the post-mortem examination at the Victoria Hospital. Dempo coach Armando Colaco and his deputy Mauricio Alfonso accompanied the body of the 25-year-old Brazilian. 

The players checked out of the team hotel with tears in their eyes. ?We are heart-broken. We are leaving with very bad memories,? captain Samir Naik said. 

?We have complained to the police about poor medical facilities at the venue of the championship (Sree Kanteerava Stadium),? midfielder Stanley Colaco said. 

?If medical attention was given immediately, Cristiano would have survived. The staff (medical) took ten minutes to give him first-aid. In the ambulance, they wrestled with the oxygen cylinder because it was not functioning.? 

Stanley said the team would head for a meeting with Dempo chairman Srinivas Dempo on arrival at noon Tuesday. ?We plan to have a memorial mass for Cristiano in the evening. 

?His body will be flown to Brazil on Wednesday,? Stanley said. 

 The team would follow up on the complaint through 

 R C Prakash, the Dempo striker from Bangalore.

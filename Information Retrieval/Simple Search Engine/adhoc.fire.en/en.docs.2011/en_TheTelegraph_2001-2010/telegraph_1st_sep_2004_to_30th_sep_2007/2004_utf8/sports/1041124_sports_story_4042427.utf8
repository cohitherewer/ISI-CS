 Waugh ?open? to coaching offer 

 Steve Waugh during a promotional campaign in Nagpur on Tuesday 

Nagpur: Former Australian cricket captain Steve Waugh said he was open to taking up a coaching assignment with India provided he gets a suitable offer. 

Although he said he had no immediate plans to take up any such assignment either for India or for his home side, he did not rule it out either. 

?I have no immediate plans to take up new assignment of coaching Australian team since I have lot of commitments including some social and charitable ones,? Waugh said on Tuesday. 

On whether he was open to the idea of coaching India, he said ?John Wright is doing well,? and added that he had no such offer from the Indian cricket board. 

?If at all an offer comes from Indian side, it would all depend on the situation and conditions thereof. If the terms and conditions are suitable to me, I might accept it.? 

On the ?walking? debate, the Australian great felt that there was no need for players to walk out without waiting for the umpire?s decision. 

?The umpire has got some responsibility and let him do it. Sometimes there is a possibility of an error of judgement on part of batsman and third umpire is the right person to give a correct decision.? 

On the just concluded India-Australia series, which the Aussies won, Waugh said the pitches prepared for the matches were good, including the one at Mumbai. 

Waugh is in the city to promote an Australian insurance company of which he is the brand ambassador.

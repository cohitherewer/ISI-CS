 - INTERNATIONAL OPEN CHESS - Saptarshi Roy earns first IM norm 

BIPIN SHENOY

 Surya Sekhar scored a fine win over Abhijit Kunte 

Calcutta: The International Open Chess tournament organised by Alekhine Chess Club at Gorky Sadan is poised for an exciting finish. City-based GM Surya Sekhar Ganguly set up a photo-finish beating overnight leader GM Abhijit Kunte in the penultimate round. 

Five players ? Abhijit Kunte, Aleksej Alexandrov, Ni Hua, Ehsan Ghaem Maghami, besides Surya Sekhar are on seven points in a neck-and-neck race for the top spot. 

In an interesting final round, Maghami faces Alexandrov, Ni Hua meets Surya Sekhar while Kunte is paired against GM Dao Thien Hai of Vietnam. On progressive score count, Abhijit Kunte is best placed and a win will ensure him the title in case of a tie. The prize money, though, will have to be shared. 

The game between Surya Sekhar and Kunte generated considerable interest among the spectators, as Kunte sacrificed a pawn and later a piece on b2 in a Sicilian defence where both the players had castled on the opposite wings. The resulting position left the local boy with three minor pieces against a rook and bishop. Surya Sekhar then played the endgame with precision to press home his advantage. 

Meanwhile, untitled Saptarshi Roy of Goodricke National Academy earned his first IM norm as he outwitted IM R.R. Laxman in a tactical battle which arose from the Sicilian defence. 

Top seed, GM Aleksej Alexandrov of Belarus was held to draw by the GM Tejas Bakre in a prolonged game which arose from the Nimzo Indian defence. 

On the third board veteran GM Oleg Romanishin of Ukraine drew in 24 moves against GM Ni Hua of China in a Slav defence. City based GM Dibyendu Barua squandered a comfortable position in the French defence against GM Ehsan Ghaem Maghami of Iran as he blundered and lost. 

The XIth and final round will be played on Wednesday from 9 am followed by the prize distribution at 6 pm.

 Miandad slams schedule

Karachi: Former Pakistan captain Javed Miandad has criticised the scheduling of the ICC Champions Trophy in England. 

The veteran of 124 Tests and 233 one-day Internationals also hit out at the sport?s ruling body for introducing two experimental rules at the meet. 

?The tournament is being organised at a time when most games will be disrupted by weather. The event is only being held because it had to be organised. There is no other objective except to earn money,? he in a TV interview on Saturday. 

He criticised the ?experiment? of third umpire calling no-balls and umpires being wired to stumps by microphones to judge caught-behind decisions.

 - Proteas concerned ahead of India tour 

 There have been calls for Smith?s sacking 

Durban: The chairman of the United Cricket Board selection committee Omar Henry Tuesday said a thorough analysis of the recent performances of the South African team would have to be made before it embarked on the tour of India in November. 

?We need to discuss the failure of the team at the ICC Champions Trophy and their performances in Sri Lanka,? said Henry said in an interview. 

South Africa have lost 11 of their last 12 one-day Internationals, five of them against Sri Lanka during their recent tour to the island country. Graeme Smith?s team also lost a two-match Test series 0-1. 

They are also slated to play a two-match Test series against India in the subcontinent in November. 

Henry said the Proteas did not boast of an impressive record in South Asia and needed to come up with an answer to tackle the condition. 

?South Africans are not the best travellers, especially to South Asia. Our record in South Asia is not very good. We, therefore, need to put our heads together and find out what is the reason for this. We need to come up with an answer so that we can tackle the conditions in the sub-continent,? said Henry. 

?We need to make the necessary adjustments to our own conditions in our own country in order to give our players similar conditions to play on that they would find in the sub-continent.? 

Asked whether coach Eric Simons should be given the sack, Henry said only the board could take a decision about it. 

?We have to discuss the matter with him and find out what has gone wrong. We got to find out what his views are regarding the team and make an analysis of this. It will then be up to the board to decide whether he carries on or stays. It?s not for me to say whether he should be removed or not. 

From my part all of us need to sit down and discuss what needs to be done,? said Henry. 

A former Test cricketer and leading coach, Ray Jennings, who has been tipped to take over as coach, said he did not think there should be any changes. 

?We have to give the coach and his boys full support so that they will once again start winning matches again,? he said. 

The poor performances of the national team continues to be the hot debate in the country, with many commentators calling for the coach and the captain to be replaced and for younger players to be brought into the team. 

Some of the players mentioned are Albie Morkel, an allrounder; Alfonso Thomas, Andrew Hall, and Adam Bacher, a swash-buckling batsman in the mould of Virender Sehwag of India.

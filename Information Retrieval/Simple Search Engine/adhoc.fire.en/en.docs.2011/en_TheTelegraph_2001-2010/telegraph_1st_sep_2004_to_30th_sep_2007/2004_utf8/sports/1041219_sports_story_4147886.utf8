 Jeev still in lead

New Delhi: India?s Jeev Milkha Singh survived a double bogey scare to maintain his overnight four-shot lead after the third round of the Asia-Japan Okinawa Open in Okinawa Saturday. 

Singh carded a two-under-par 69 at the Naha Golf Club to move into Sunday?s final round well clear of Japan?s Hideki Kase, who moved into the title frame with a fine 66, according to information received here Saturday. 

The Indian, who landed a step closer towards ending a five-year winless run with the three-day total of 15-under-par 198, however, had to survive some anxious moments after sending his tee shot out of bounds on the 13th hole before running up a six. 

He recovered strongly with birdies on 15th and 17th. 

First round leader Charlie Wi of Korea kept within striking distance with a 69 to lie five back along with Australian Scott Barr and Japan?s Soushi Tajima. 

Another Indian in fray, Amandeep Johl, also impressed and was placed joint eighth after a second round score of 67. With a two-under 69 in the opening round, Johl?s tally read 136. 

Jeev, who is yet to record a win since 1999, said, after claiming the Day I lead: ?I?ve shot nine-under-par twice previously but this is the first time on a par-71 course. 

?I just concentrated on each shot and didn?t think about the score. I have been playing well in the past three weeks, so I?m looking forward to the weekend. It?s been quite a while since I last won.? 

The cut was applied at 141 with 70 players qualifying for the weekend rounds

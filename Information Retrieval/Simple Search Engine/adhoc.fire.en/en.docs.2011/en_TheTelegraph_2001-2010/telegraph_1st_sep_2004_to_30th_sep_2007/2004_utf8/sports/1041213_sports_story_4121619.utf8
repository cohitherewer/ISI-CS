New Delhi: India?s Jyoti Randhawa beat Australian Terry Pilkadaris in a thrilling play-off to clinch the $550,000 Volvo Masters of Asia golf title in Kuala Lumpur on Sunday. 

Randhawa slammed a 15-foot birdie putt in the second hole of a sudden-death shootout at Kota Permai Golf and Country Club to end the Asian Tour on a glorious note. 

The Indian?s victory, worth $99,000, was his first success this year and prevented Pilkadaris from a third title in four months. 

The Aussie battled himself into contention with an impressive seven-under-par 65 in the final round, but Randhawa forced a play-off by holing an eight-foot birdie at the par five 18th in regulation enroute to a 67, according to information received here. 

Overnight joint-leaders Prayad Marksaeng of Thailand and Wang Ter-Chang of Chinese Taipei shared third place after an identical 72. Last year?s winner Thailand?s Thongchai Jaidee finished fifth, but that was enough to lift the Asian Tour Order of Merit crown. 

In the play-off, Randhawa and Pilkadaris birdied the first extra hole, played on the 18th. The Aussie seemed to have wrapped it up by setting up a seven-foot birdie chance, while Randhawa?s chip went well past the flag. 

But in a stunning turnaround, the Indian rolled home his putt and with the pressure on, Pilkadaris agonisingly missed his attempt, bringing an end to the gripping contest. 

?It was a great finish,? said Randhawa, whose triumph in the Masters of Asia earned him an invitation into next year?s WGC-NEC invitational. 

?This was one of the most exciting rounds of golf I?ve played since my Indian Open win in 2000 which also had a tight leaderboard. It was nerve-wracking, but I handled myself well and I was very focused. Dropping shots yesterday put me in a good position, as I didn?t have anything to lose. 

?I don?t know how I did it. I knew I needed to birdie the last hole in regulation but jumped on my tee shot and pulled into the trees. I managed to find a gap in between the trees and hit a fabulous nine iron to the flag to nine feet. 

?It?s amazing. Then I had two great drives in the play-off and made two great putts,? added Randhawa, who had a four-day total of 14-under-par 274. The champion said the win was timely. 

?I had started to doubt myself after making a few swing changes. I?ve not won for nearly two years, but my coach Kel Llewellyn told me to be patient. It?s a great thing to win as my confidence will just go up. 

?It?s a nice Christmas present. Anytime you win, it is significant. Terry played great, I wished him well and applauded some of his shots as he played some good golf,? said the 32-year-old Indian, whose win was his fifth career title in Asia. 

Thai star Thongchai sealed the Order of Merit title comfortably in his fifth-place finish. In total, he won $381,929 from nine tournaments, which is a new record for money won in a single season. Randhawa finished second with $351,709 while Simon Yates of Scotland was third with $310,988. 

Among other Indians, Rahil Ganjee and Jeev Milkha Singh finished ninth. Harmeet Kahlon ended 30th, while Amandeep Johl and Gaurav Ghei finished 39th and 41st respectively. (PTI)

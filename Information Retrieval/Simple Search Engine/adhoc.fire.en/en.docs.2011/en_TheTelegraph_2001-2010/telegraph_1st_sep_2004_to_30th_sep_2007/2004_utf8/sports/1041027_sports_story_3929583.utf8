The Telegraph - Calcutta

 ?I?ve given the job everything I could?

 - A Telegraph exclusive - Glenn McGrath, the first Australian quick to play hundred 

Tests, in a one-to-one 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Glenn McGrath 

Nagpur: Glenn McGrath is ?keeping fingers crossed? in his 100th Test, but he needn?t be too concerned: The VCA Stadium wicket, after all, has much to offer. The 34-year-old, who already has 446 wickets (?450 is an immediate target?) besides 289 in ODIs, spoke to The Telegraph on the eve of becoming the first Australian quick to join the most exclusive ?club?. 

The following are excerpts 

On the qualities needed by a fast bowler 

Skill, obviously, and the body to stand up to the demands of quick bowling... For me, though, attitude is most important... One must be aggressive and be able to execute any game plan. 

On what has ?carried? him to 100 Tests 

(Laughs) An easy action ? I?ve stuck to what came naturally ? and being able to land the ball pretty much where I want... The key to wickets is having the ability to bowl 99 out of 100 balls in the area of choice... I suppose my attitude has also helped. Moreover, I?ve given the job everything I could. 

On his attitude 

I don?t look for easy options and, if possible, would bowl every second over of the match... I?m definitely aggressive, but try not to cross the line. 

On fitness 

Luckily, I?ve only had two major injuries ? a stomach muscle tear in 1998 and last season?s surgery on the left ankle... That was necessitated by a decade of bowling. (After a pause) Looking back, it helped that I didn?t play much cricket when I was young... That allowed my body to grow... Ideally, the action should be stress-free without putting pressure on any one part of the body. Then, the off season training has to be thorough. 

On who made the biggest impression on him when young 

I did watch a fair bit of cricket growing up, but didn?t model myself on anybody. Of course, I enjoyed watching Dennis Lillee ? my hero ? and the West Indies fast bowlers of the Eighties... Michael Holding, Malcolm Marshall, Joel Garner... That was a great era of quick bowling. 

On whether he had a personal coach 

No... In fact, my first exposure to coaches was at the Academy when I was 22... My action has been pretty much the same throughout... What happened at the Academy? Refinement, really, as I didn?t have a mixed action. 

On five favourites (alphabetically) 

Wasim Akram: Had the ability to do anything... Swung the ball both ways, got it to reverse... The way he powered to the crease, off a short run-up, was fascinating. 

Curtley Ambrose: Was amazing... With his high-arm action, he got extra bounce and carry... He was intimidating and I enjoyed watching him. 

Holding: Had such a graceful run-up... Almost glided in, yet generated so much pace and bounce... 

Lillee: As I?ve said, he was my hero... Was very aggressive, had a classical action... 

Marshall: Was amazing... Very strong... Besides the pace, he was able to swing the ball and that made him a tough customer. 

On the most promising young fast bowler 

Without a doubt, Irfan Pathan... His attitude, body-language... It?s excellent. 

On what newcomers ought to keep in mind 

That the difference between strictly first-class and Test cricket is huge? 

On whether reverse swing is set to become the most potent weapon 

Perhaps in the sub-continent, where the ball does get scuffed early. 

On 100 Tests 

(After a pause) Well, nobody will ever be able to take away this achievement... It?s a trifle disappointing that the family (wife Jane and their two kids, in particular) isn?t here, but my dear ones are with me in spirit. Cricket Australia is going to make a presentation before the start of the first Test at home (versus New Zealand), in Brisbane, and the family and friends have already planned to be at the Gabba. 

On whether, given a chance, he would do something differently 

(Smiles) No... It?s important to learn from mistakes and, if you don?t make them, what do you learn? But, yes, back on my debut in 1993 I couldn?t have spelt out how my career would unfold over 11 years... 

Finally, on tips for emerging quicks 

Enjoy bowling... If the enjoyment isn?t there, no matter how good, you won?t be successful... Then, ensure you don?t have a mixed action wherein it?s side-on at the top and front-on at the bottom... Lastly, work very hard.

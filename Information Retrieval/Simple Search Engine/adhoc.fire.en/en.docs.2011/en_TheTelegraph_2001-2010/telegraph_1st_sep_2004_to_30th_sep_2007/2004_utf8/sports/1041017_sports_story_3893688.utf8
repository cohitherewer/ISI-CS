 Warne-Murali rivalry good for game: Sachin 

Mumbai: Batting maestro Sachin Tendulkar on Saturday described leg-spinner Shane Warne?s record breaking feat of claiming 533 Test wickets as a brilliant one and said the Aussie?s rivalry with Sri Lanka?s Muttiah Muralidharan was ?a healthy competition?. 

?Warne?s performance has really been brilliant and this kind of performances do not come everyday. It is the hard work he has put in the last 12 to 13 years that has paid rich dividends. It is a remarkable feat which was appreciated well by every one,? Tendulkar said. 

Tendulkar said the competition between the two spin wizards would challenge the batsmen to give their best, which is good for the game as a whole. 

?Personally their rivalry is very good for the game as the batsmen world over will take this as a real challenge to give out their best?, said Tendulkar. (PTI)

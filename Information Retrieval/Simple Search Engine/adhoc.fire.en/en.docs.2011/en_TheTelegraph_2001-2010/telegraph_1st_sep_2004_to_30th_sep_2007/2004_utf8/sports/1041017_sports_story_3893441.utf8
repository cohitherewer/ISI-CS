 Railways have it easy

 Ashim played a crucial role in Railways win 

New Delhi: Railways virtually assured themselves a berth in the quarter final league when they thrashed Bihar 3-0 in a cluster III encounter of the Santosh Trophy national football championships on Saturday. 

The railwaymen, who had won their opening league encounter against Uttaranchal by an identical margin, now have six points from two outings, while the latter, who beat Chandigarh 1-0 on Saturday, are second with three points. 

Railways only need a draw in their last game against Chandigarh on Monday to advance to the quarter finals. 

In other matches of the day, Uttar Pradesh drubbed Jharkhand 3-0, Maharashtra got a walkover when Arunachal Pradesh failed to turn up in cluster IV, Nagaland were held to a goalless draw by Jammu and Kashmir in cluster VIII and Andhra Pradesh beat Mizoram 2-0 in cluster I. 

Railways, with strikers Ashim Biswas and Khasif Jamal in their ranks, dominated the proceedings. Ashim Biswas, fresh from his injury-induced lay-off, played a stellar role, but missed scoring himself. Jamal drew first blood in the 30th minute. Gourav Dutta (48th) and Subhashish Roy Choudhary (83rd) then increased the tally. 

Uttaranchal skipper Sunil Chaudhary struck in the 52nd minute as they edged out Chandigarh by a lone goal. 

Meanwhile, Uttar Pradesh thrashed a haplessJharkhand 3-0 to take their points tally to six. Karan Singh (29th), Ramesh Rawat (52nd) and Shamsi Reza (58th) scored for the winners. 

Uttar Pradesh now top the cluster ahead of Maharashtra ? who have the same number of points ? on a better goal average. (PTI)

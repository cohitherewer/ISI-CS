 ?Rooney, Cristiano can take United back to top?

Noordwijk: Ruud van Nistelrooy believes Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo can fire Manchester United back to the top of English football. 

Rooney made a sensational impact on his debut, scoring a hattrick in the 6-2 defeat of Fenerbahce in the Champions League last week, while fellow 18-year-old Ronaldo has won many admirers since arriving from Portugal last season. 

?I really believe that they are the world?s best in their age group. It is so impressive if you see their technical skill combined with their physical strength, it?s unbelievable,? said Van Nistelrooy. 

United are nine points behind leaders Arsenal in the Premier League, but Van Nistelrooy says the Old Trafford club can still mount a strong challenge, especially with defender Rio Ferdinand back from his eight-month suspension. 

?We are on our way right now,? said Van Nistelrooy. ?The team is complete and now the coach can do his job. Our possibilities are enormous and we can reach a high level. 

The gap in the league is quite big but it all came through our struggling start with a defeat against Chelsea and several injuries. Since that defeat we didn?t lose a match.? 

Van Nistelrooy, who has scored 18 goals for his country in 38 internationals, said Rooney?s performance against Fenerbahce still had him shaking his head. 

?The whole country was upside down, and it was not only the three goals but also the way he scored. It really was unbelievable,? he said. 

?It?s hard for Rooney but he received strong support from players who also made their debut for Manchester at a young age like Ryan Giggs.? 

Van Nistelrooy, who will sit out The Netherlands? World Cup qualifier against Macedonia on Saturday because of suspension, says he can?t wait to return to the Dutch side after missing the 2-0 victory against the Czech Republic last month. 

The Manchester United striker was suspended for the opening game of their World Cup qualifying campaign after a two-match ban for insulting Swedish referee Anders Frisk in the Euro 2004 semi-final defeat by Portugal.He will also have to sit out Saturday?s clash with.

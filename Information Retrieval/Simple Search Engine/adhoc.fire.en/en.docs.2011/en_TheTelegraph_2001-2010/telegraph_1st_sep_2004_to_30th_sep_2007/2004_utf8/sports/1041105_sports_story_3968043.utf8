London: Juventus and Olympique Lyon joined Chelsea and Inter Milan in the last 16 of the Champions League after both scored late goals to seal their places on Wednesday. 

Juventus qualified from Group C by beating Bayern Munich 1-0 with a last minute Alessandro del Piero winner which gave them their fourth successive 1-0 victory and lifted them on to 12 points. 

Maccabi beat Ajax 2-1 in the other group match for their first-ever goals and victory in the competition proper leaving them both on three points. 

Olympique Lyon joined Juventus in the opening knockout round when they beat Fenerbahce 4-2 in a roller-coaster Group D match at home with two stoppage-time goals to take their tally to 10 points. 

They cannot now finish lower than second and are likely to be joined by Manchester United who beat Sparta Prague 4-1 to move to eight points. 

Fenerbahce (three points) have a slim mathematical chance of overhauling United and finishing second, but Prague (one point) are out. 

Lyon looked like they had blown their chance with 17 minutes to play when Tuncay Sanli equalised for the Turkish champions to make it 2-2. 

But Fenerbahce were reduced to 10 men after Servet Cetin was red carded two minutes later and paid the price when substitute Nilmar scored twice in stoppage time to seal the victory in a thriller. Fenerbahce led first before Lyon established a 2-1 lead early in the second half. 

Real Madrid overturned a two-goal deficit for the second time in the competition, coming back to draw 2-2 with Dynamo Kiev in Ukraine in their Group B match. 

But unlike on September 28 when they recovered to beat AS Roma 4-2 at home, Real had to settle for one point with goals from Raul and a penalty from Luis Figo, who is 32 on Thursday. Roma and Leverkusen drew 1-1 behind closed doors in Rome in the other match in the group leaving Leverkusen, Kiev and Real on seven points with Roma on one. 

Uefa banned spectators from the match as punishment for the coin-throwing attack on referee Anders Frisk when Roma played Kiev at home in September. 

Ruud van Nistelrooy maintained his incredible scoring record in the competition with all four goals in Manchester United?s 4-1 win over Sparta Prague at Old Trafford, taking his tally to 41 goals in the competition for PSV Eindhoven and Manchester United. 

The pick of Wednesday?s was his third when he battled a lost cause before winning the ball and lobbing Sparta keeper Jaromir Blazek. 

Only three other players have scored four goals in one Champions League game, the last being Dado Prso when Monaco beat Deportivo La Coruna 8-3 a year ago this week. 

In Group A Olympiakos beat AS Monaco 1-0 and Liverpool?s Spanish manager Rafael Benitez enjoyed his trip back home with Liverpool winning 1-0 at Deportivo La Coruna with an own goal from Jorge Andrade after only 14 minutes. 

Olympiakos and Liverpool are on seven points, Monaco on six and Deportivo, last season?s beaten semi-finalists, facing elimination with just two points. (Reuters)

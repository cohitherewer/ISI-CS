 Chandana doubtful

Colombo: Sri Lankan allrounder Upul Chandana has left for Singapore to undergo a medical test for an unnamed ailment, putting his participation in next month?s tour of New Zealand in doubt, the cricket board announced Wednesday. 

Chandana was part of a 20-member Sri Lankan training squad named for the tour earlier this month, but his inclusion in the final 14 will now depend on medical advice, Sri Lanka Cricket said. 

The statement did not specify the nature of Chandana?s injury and board officials refused to comment. (AP)

 Bagan in quarter finals

Bangalore: A solitary goal by Nigerian import James Ugwo helped city giants Mohun Bagan overcome Indian Bank, Chennai 1-0 and advance into the quarter finals of the Federation Cup here on Friday. 

James Ugwo and Roberto Mendes Silva of Brazil combined well to set up the match-winning goal in the 37th minute. With Silva passing the ball into the striking zone, Ugwo seized the opportunity and slammed it into the net. 

Two minutes later, Basudeb Mondal made a good effort to increase Bagan?s tally, but the bank custodian Felix Edward rose to the occasion to deny him. 

Bagan, who have bagged the Federation Cup on 11 previous occasions, did not allow their rivals any leeway. They were on the attack right from the beginning. 

In the eighth minute, Ugwo attempted to land the ball into the net through a reverse shot, but D Ravanan of Indian Bank came to the rescue. 

Indian Bank ?keeper, Felix Edward, effected a splendid save when Mehtab Hossain hammered a powerful shot in the 17th minute. 

The bankmen had a close look at the Bagan citadel in the 36th minute when M Sudeesh?s effort was blocked by Bagan goalie Subrata Paul. 

Apart from this sole effort, seldom did the bankmen trouble the Mohun Bagan defence in the first half. 

They stepped up the attack in the second half, but could not capitalise on a couple of chances.

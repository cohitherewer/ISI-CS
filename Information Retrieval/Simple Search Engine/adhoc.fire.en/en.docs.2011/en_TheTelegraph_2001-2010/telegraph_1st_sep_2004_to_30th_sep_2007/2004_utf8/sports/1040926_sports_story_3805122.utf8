The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Nayeem back after Bangla stint

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Nayeem had a satisfying time in Bangladesh 

Calcutta: Syed Nayeemuddin is back from Bangladesh, carrying with him a fine bundle of successes with top Dhaka team Brothers Union. He went over across the border in December last and joined the club, then took it to the National League title before taking it again to the pinnacle in the Dhaka Premier League with a fine title win. 

That made Brothers Union the top club of that country, but Nayeem did not rest on his laurels and went ahead and won a one-day meet as well ? the Independence Cup. Then he finished runners-up in another competitive meet, also called Independence Cup, though this was a full format meet. 

He has a breather period now, and isn?t too unwilling to involve himself in any local assignment ? there is a Santosh Trophy coach issue lingering and then Subhas Bhowmick seems to be steady with his decision of leaving East Bengal. 

Whatever the other options, Nayeem has had a satisfying time with the Bangla Club which has had a fresh lease of life when top Dhaka real estate developer AFM Jahangir invested 1 crore Taka for player purchase etc. That the current mayor of Dhaka, Sadiq Hussain Khoka, was former secretary and now a patron, also helps. 

The experience has been a little different from coaching top Indian clubs for Nayeem. ?I feel players there are physically stronger than in India. Their skill level is the same as in India too. Only, facilities are way below Indian clubs?. If you see the ground they play on you?d run, it?s that bad.? 

Not that the Bangladesh Football Federation has a great reputation in keeping its nose clean as far as administration goes, but Nayeem sees good days on the horizon with money coming into the clubs and some foreigners also moving in. The Dhaka league (Premier League) not only allows four foreigners to be registered, they can be registered any time of year. The National League allows four foreigners, though Brothers Union won the national title sans a single foreigner. 

At this point Nayeem may be back in Bangladesh if the footballing fraternity wants, or Calcuttans may be seeing him in another coaching capacity in the country.

 MCG to be ready in time 

Melbourne: The redevelopment of the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) will be completed in time to stage Australia?s Boxing Day Test with Pakistan, MCG trust chairman John Wylie said on Wednesday. 

The playing surface of the vast arena had to be excavated so the foundations of an athletics track could be laid, as part of the 2006 Commonwealth Games redevelopment. 

A recent wet spell had raised fears that the playing surface would not be ready in time for the December 26 second Test. ?It?s all going to be done in time for the Boxing Day Test,? Wylie said, referring to the turf rollout on the playing area. 

The rollout began last weekend and on Wednesday it was about a third completed. Drop-in wickets have already been installed. 

?We?ve obviously been reviewing the schedule very closely and making sure that the MCG management team have had it well under control ? and they have,? Wylie said. 

?They?re extremely confident, they know what they?re doing, they?re the best curatorial team in Australia, if not the world. We?re excited, it should be a fantastic Test.? 

The major difference with the new playing surface is that the ground will be flat after the old design had a downward slope from the middle to the edges to cater for drainage. 

?The quality of the turf will be pretty similar to what the players have experienced in the past,? Wylie said. ?It is the best turf system in the world, it?s got fantastic drainage and we think the players will respond very well to it.?

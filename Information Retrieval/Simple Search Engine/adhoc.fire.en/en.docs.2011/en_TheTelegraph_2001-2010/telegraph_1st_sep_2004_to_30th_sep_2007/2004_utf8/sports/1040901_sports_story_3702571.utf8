The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Maid-in-waiting melts hearts

 - A tribute to the British athletes in Athens 

 SUE MOTT IN ATHENS 

 Kelly Holmes 

Im afraid I embarrassed myself in the ladies lavatory beneath the Olympic Stadium. A tall, statuesque woman, studiously composed, was also availing herself of the facilities. Despite being a first-hand witness to the riotous assembly that was our 4x100metres relay team, the rhapsody in blue of our rowers, the courageous hoof plunging of our eventing team and the not inconsiderable charms of the Brazilian beach volleyball team (male branch), I became instantaneously and dangerously awestruck. 

Ah, I found myself saying in hideously accented schoolgirl French that had laid dormant for longer than Mark Lewis-Francis has been alive, etes vous Perec? 

The imperious 1996 double gold medallist, Marie-Jose Perec of France, acknowledged it was she. 

Quest ce que vous pense de Kelly Holmes? I hesitantly inquired. She smiled. She is wonderful, she replied in divine English. Holmes cracked a lot of ice in Athens. 

She broke records for crying and the 1500m. She won two gold medals, confounding the pre-Olympic pundits and her own fearful expectations. 

She arrived a maid-in-waiting to the formally regal Paula Radcliffe and returned to Britain on Monday the undisputed queen of middle-distance running. Paula, meanwhile, like Marie Antoinette, lost her head. 

Little things made you laugh. The olive crowns of the medal winners were sometimes presented at such perverse angles, their recipients looked like Just William after a particularly hazardous crawl through a hedge. 

Big things made you cry. Like Matthew Pinsent. It was natural that the performance of the British team should have claimed so much of our attention. But this was the ultimate international stage and dramatics were drawn from every corner of the globe. 

The last night of the athletics in the Olympic Stadium, when all you could see was the jubilant flags from every nation and all you could hear was Zorba being sung to, danced to, clapped to, and stamped to by 80,000 people, was flat-out tremendous. 

But it is all over now.

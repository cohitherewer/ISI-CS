The Telegraph - Calcutta

Jharkhand go down by 22 runs

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Jamshedpur: Himachal Pradesh defeated Jharkhand 

by 22 runs on the final day of the Ranji Trophy Plate group A tie at the Keenan 

Stadium on Saturday. 

The inevitable happened 21 minutes after lunch when left-arm seamer Ashok Thakur induced an edge from Shiv Shankar Rao much to the glee of his teammates. Mihir Diwakar remained unbeaten on 19. 

Needing 178 runs for victory, the hosts were sent packing for 155 thanks to Thakur, who bowled with lot of variation under overcast conditions. Jharkhand started cautiously at overnight score of 110 for six. 

Skipper Panda and Santosh Lal remained content on staying put at the wicket even though the visitors tried hard to break the partnership. 

Both the batsmen seemed to have gone into their groove as Jharkhand harboured hopes of victory. However, all hopes got shattered when Panda went back to the pavilion with addition of just nine runs to his overnight score of 11. The skipper edged a Thakur away swinger behind the stumps. He added 55 runs for the seventh wicket with Lal. 

Lal, who was batting on an enterprising 32 overnight, could not stay long either, getting castled by a Thakur off-cutter. With 120 runs on the board and eight wickets lost, it was a question of how quick the visitors manage to polish off the tail. 

Jharkhand, though, did not lose hopes when left-arm spinner Shahid Khan took guard. The city-based Khan, who scored 38 in the first innings and also added 93 runs for the eighth wicket with Panda, was expected to show his ability to spend time at the crease. 

However, he disappointed by falling leg before to Vikramjeet Mallick for a duck. Jharkhand were 142 for nine at lunch. The medium-pace duo of Mihir Diwakar and Rao added 35 runs for the last wicket before the latter was dismissed.

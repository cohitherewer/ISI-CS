The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Dew factor keeps Inzy worried

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The Pakistan team, led by Inzamam-ul Haq, reached the city on Wednesday night for the one-off one-day International against India on Saturday. 

Moments after reaching the hotel, the captain said they are looking for their fourth win over India. ?We have won the last three outings against them and are confident of winning the fourth as well,? Inzamam said. 

The captain however, praised the Indians and felt that it will be a good match. The two teams will clash at the Eden Gardens as part of the Board of Control for Cricket in India?s (BCCI) Platinum Jubilee celebrations. 

The visiting captain, though, was worried about the dew factor in the day-night encounter. ?We have to adjust to the dew here which is tough for any team,? Inzamam said. 

Earlier on arrival in New Delhi, Inzamam maintained that cricket should be used as a vehicle for ?building relations? between two countries, reports PTI. 

?We are coming back after 1999. We are happy to be here. People of both countries share a lot of warmth for each other. We are neighbours and know each other well,? he said. 

?Nothing will take away our focus from cricket, but the important thing is to build relations. So a win or loss will not matter on this occasion,? the Pakistan captain said. 

?I hope the boys will enjoy the game,? he added.

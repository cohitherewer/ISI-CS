 Brussels: Kim Clijsters will not need a new operation on her injury-plagued left wrist, but will be out of tennis until next season to let it recover, the former world No. 1 said on Thursday. The Belgian will have to rest for at least another six weeks, wear a brace and take anti-inflammatory medicine after she injured the wrist during her comeback tournament in Belgium last week.

 ?At the moment there is no need for an operation,? her website, www.kimclijsters.Com, announced.

 ?In the case of a powerful and agile player like Kim over-extension of the tendon is a constant threat,? her website said. 

 Pune: Four Pakistani badminton players are expected to undergo coaching at the BPL Badminton Academy in Bangalore in November.

 According to Padukone, around five to six leading badminton players from Pakistan are also expected to participate in the Satellite badminton championship to be held in Hyderabad from October 21-25 in which players from Sri Lanka, Iran, Thailand and Indonesia are also likely to take part, they said.

 Bangkok: Manchester United, the world?s richest football club, has launched a roadshow in Southeast Asia to find new corporate sponsors and strengthen its fan base, officials said on Thursday.

 ?The club is looking for new general Asian sponsors as Manchester United has a strong fan base in Southeast Asia,? an official from the public relations company of the club said.

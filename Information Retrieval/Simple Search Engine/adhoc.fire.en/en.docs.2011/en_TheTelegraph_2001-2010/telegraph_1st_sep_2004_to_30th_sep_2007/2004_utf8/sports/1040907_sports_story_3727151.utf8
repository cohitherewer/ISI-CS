The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Asafa Powell at it again

Rieti (Italy): Wilson Kipketer failed to earn a farewell victory when he repeated his bronze-medal performance at the Olympics in the Rieti Grand Prix 800m here. 

Exactly one week after the Athens Games finished, Kipketer again lost a lead after the final turn and finished third on Sunday. 

Kenyas Joseph Mutua won in 1:43.35, Youssef Saad Kamel of Bahrain was second in 1:43.43, and Kipketer, the Kenyan-born world record holder who competes for Denmark, finished in 1:43.89. 

Kipketer was positioned well at halfway and launched himself into the lead after 500m, but he appeared to run out of steam and was overtaken on the final straight. 

The race was good, the only thing that was a mistake was that I stayed behind for a long time, he said. This might be my second-to-last race. I dont think this will be my last race. 

A three-time world champion, Kipketer had indicated this could have been his final race. 

Kipketer, one of 13 Athens medallists competing in Rieti, said he would most probably close his career after one more meet. 

I dont know how Ill run, he said. My body today is good, tomorrow bad. 

In the 3,000m steeplechase, Russias Gulnara Samitova was ahead of her own world record pace after one kilometre, but slowed in the final two-thirds of the race. She still won in 9:21.40, far off her record time of 9:01.59 at a pre-Olympic meet in Greece in July. She was unable to compete in the event in Athens because it wasnt part of the Olympic programme. 

Fellow Russian Lyubov Ivanova was second in 9:28.02. 

Jamaicans swept the mens and womens 100m dashes. 

Asafa Powell followed up his fast win (9.87) at the Van Damme Memorial on Friday in Brussels with a 10.18 to take the Rieti crown. 

Abdul Aziz Zakari of Ghana was the runner-up in 10.20 and another Jamaican, Dwight Thomas, finished third in 10.30. There was a -1.3 wind factor, which attributed to the relatively slow times. 

Reigning world champion Kim Collins of St Kitts and Nevis came fifth on Sunday. 

Aleen Bailey won the womens 100 in 11.34 in even tougher conditions. The race was delayed for several minutes due to a breeze blowing directly in the runners faces, and the final results carried a -3.0 wind factor.

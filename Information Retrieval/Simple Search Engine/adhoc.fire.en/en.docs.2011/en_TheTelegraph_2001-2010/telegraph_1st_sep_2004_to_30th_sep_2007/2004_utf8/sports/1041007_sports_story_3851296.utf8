The Telegraph - Calcutta

 I?m not missing cricket at all: Mark Waugh

 - Trip to India is Australian?s second assignment as tour host for Aussie fans 

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI 

Bangalore: Unlike brother Steve, who doesn?t mind the Media attention, Mark Waugh steers clear of journos. Even two years after quitting international cricket ? he retired from all forms at the end of last season ? Mark hasn?t changed. 

?I?m here as a tour host and, really, don?t wish to talk about cricket... Don?t intend giving interviews,? Mark told The Telegraph on Wednesday afternoon. 

However, he did respond when asked if the on-field action and camaraderie was being missed: ?Not at all... If I felt that way, I wouldn?t today be with a group of fans... Indeed, I?m happy with life after cricket...? 

Mark is accompanying a batch of 40 which has tied-up with Australia Sports Tour (AST), a Victoria-registered company. He will be in India till just after the second Test, which begins in Chennai on October 14. 

?I made my tour host debut in the West Indies last year and, so, this is my second assignment... Am I going to take a group for next summer?s Ashes? Well, at this point, can?t say,? he remarked. 

Among Mark?s ?duties? is to dwell on what is likely to happen during the day. That interaction usually takes place over breakfast. In any case, given that he sits with the fans, he is actually on ?call? throughout. 

According to an AST spokesman, Merv Hughes will bring along another batch of 40 for the fourth and final Test, in Mumbai from November 3. The company had to strike off Nagpur (third Test) owing to hotel bookings ?being a problem?. 

Each fan on the present trip, one learns, has paid Aus $8,000 ? an amount which covers everything. 

Mark, incidentally, played 128 Tests and totalled 8,029 runs (20 hundreds). In ODIs, the majestic striker did a wee bit better, finishing with 8,500 (18 hundreds). 

On his day, he had no peers.

 Bedi salute to Kumble

New Delhi: Legendary spinner Bishan Singh Bedi feels leg-spinner Anil Kumble would have made one of the finest Indian captains. 

?It is not just me, coach John Wright himself has said that Kumble would have been the best captain, because he is such a humble and outstanding student of the game,? Bedi said, while praising the Karnataka bowler for equalling Kapil Dev?s tally of 434 Test wickets. 

The former left-arm spinner said Kumble?s humility made him a ?truly outstanding champion?. 

?It is tremendous and a great achievement. With Anil, it has been a combination of perseverance and performance?, Bedi said. ?He is highly intellectual and analytical, and above all humble and down to earth on and off the field. Never once did he betray his emotions on the field.? 

Bedi, who was the leading Indian wicket-taker with 266 scalps till Kapil Dev went past him in 1986-87, praised Kumble for achieving the landmark with the limitations he had. 

?He is not a spinner in the real sense of the word. But he sticks to his job and bowls within his limitations.?

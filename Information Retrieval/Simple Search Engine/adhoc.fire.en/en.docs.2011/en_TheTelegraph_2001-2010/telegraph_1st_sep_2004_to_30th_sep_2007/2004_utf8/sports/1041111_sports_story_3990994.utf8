Sydney: Shane Warne and Darren Lehmann have been recalled to Australia?s squad for next week?s first Test against New Zealand after the selectors dropped Simon Katich and Nathan Hauritz. 

Warne regained his spot as the team?s spinner from Hauritz after missing last week?s final Test in India with a broken thumb while Lehmann was chosen ahead of Katich in the middle-order pending a fitness Test on his injured hamstring. 

?Both Simon and Nathan performed exceptionally in India and it was a very difficult decision to leave them out,? Australia?s chairman of selectors Trevor Hohns said in a statement on Wednesday. 

?However, Darren is a highly-respected, experienced campaigner and is still our preferred choice at this stage, as long as his injured hamstring is fully recovered. 

?Darren was the vice-captain for much of the tour in India, and his form over the past 12 months has been very consistent, particularly on the tour of Sri Lanka earlier this year where he posted two centuries.? 

Hohns admitted Katich was unlucky to miss out after averaging nearly 40 in India and completing two half-centuries including a top score of 99 but said he would get another chance.The left-hander was ultimately squeezed out by the amazing performances of Michael Clarke, who scored 400 runs at 57 in his first series, including 151 on debut, as well as taking the remarkable figures of six wickets for nine runs in the final Test.?Michael Clarke demonstrated what an exciting prospect he is in India and we have rewarded his performances in the sub-continent by giving him an opportunity on home soil against New Zealand,? Hohns said. 

?We have every faith in Simon and are very confident that he will play in the Australian Test team again in the not too distant future. 

?He has done very well on those occasions when he has been called upon and it was a very hard decision to make.? 

Warne broke his thumb during batting practice in India.

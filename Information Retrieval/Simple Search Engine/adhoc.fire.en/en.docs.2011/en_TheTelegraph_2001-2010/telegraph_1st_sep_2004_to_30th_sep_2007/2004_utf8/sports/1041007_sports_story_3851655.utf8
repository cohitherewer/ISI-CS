 Natl records by Puneet, Rehan 

New Delhi: Puneet Rana of Punjab gave the best Indian performance in the men?s 50 metres breaststroke and won the gold on the second day of the 58th senior national aquatic championships here on Wednesday. Rehan Poncha of Karnataka clinched his second gold of the meet and set a new record in the men?s 400 metres individual medley. 

While Karnataka continued to lead the medal tally with as many as eight more medals, police swimmers were close behind with seven. Their women?s 4x200 freestyle relay team, despite being fastest, was disqualified because one of the team members jumped back into the pool even before the race was over. 

Maharashtra and SSCB bagged two medals each. Puneet clocked 29.85 seconds which was .03 seconds less than the previous mark of Deepak Kumar of police set in Thrissur edition of the championships. Deepak finished second with the time of 30.68 secs. 

Poncha was the centre of attraction after bagging his second consecutive gold medal in the meet. Poncha, who missed the last three senior nationals, was not very happy with his performance.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 I?ve learnt from situations... I?m confident of handling come what may: Sourav

 - ?Runs on the board? That?s the best way of putting Australia under pressure?

Bangalore: The countdown to what promises to be a down-to-the-wire series has begun and Team India captain Sourav Ganguly is bound to be a key player. Despite the pressure of time, Sourav spoke to The Telegraph at some length ? looking back and ahead ? on Tuesday afternoon. 

The following are excerpts 

Q How pumped up are you just a 

few hours from the start of yet another big series? 

A I?m excited... The adrenaline is flowing... The 

next few weeks are going to be very demanding and I?m confident we will be up 

to it. 

Is confidence alone going to be a huge factor? 

(Almost interrupting) It?s the keenness... 

The boys want to do well against the Australians because they represent the best 

and, really, nothing is more satisfying than being right up there versus the No.1 

side... Confidence merely gives that boost. 

But hasn?t Sachin Tendulkar?s non-availability 

come as a blow? 

Yes, but he should be fit for Chennai (second Test)... 

Till he returns, we won?t only miss his batting, but bowling too. On wickets where 

there is turn, he is as good as any specialist spinner. 

What have you been telling Sachin? 

Get back soon. 

Ricky Ponting, of course, is out for the first 

two Tests. Has that neutralised Sachin?s absence? 

Sachin?s impact on a game, to my mind, is greater 

than Ponting?s... So, Sachin?s absence is a bigger loss for us than Ponting not 

being there for his team. 

Given Ponting?s form in the last series (706 

runs), his absence has made it easier for you... 

Not necessarily... 

For now, the who-will-open question has been 

settled. Surely, the balance is right when a specialist is at the very top? 

I?ve got no problems with Choppy (Akash Chopra) opening. 

With Sachin?s absence providing a vacancy, he?s an obvious choice for the XI. 

Is there something we?ve learnt from the last 

series (in Australia) which ought to be kept in mind? 

(After a pause) That we have to take it session 

by session... The Australians play hard and are so competitive that one session 

could change a Test ? as, for example, happened at the MCG last December. Bottomline 

is that the quality of our cricket must consistently be of a high order. 

What, then, will make the difference? 

Runs on the board... That?s the best way of putting 

Australia under pressure. If we do that, then Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh 

are going to be a huge factor. As captain, I?m delighted both are around ? that 

wasn?t so either in the 2000-01 series at home or in the last three Tests during 

the 2003-04 series in Australia. 

How much of the series will be a battle of the 

mind and nerves? 

Quite a bit... Indeed, today, that?s how cricket is 

played ... The tougher one is in the mind, the better the chances. In fact, this 

holds true for all sport. 

Ian Healy feels you are Steve Waugh?s successor 

where playing mind games is concerned... 

Has he said so? Well, I don?t put on an act... What 

you see of me is what comes naturally. 

You?ve already had a meeting. What did you tell 

the boys? 

Asked them to relax... To enjoy the challenge and 

to retain the body-language of the past few days... The more positive we are, 

the better the results are going to be. As captain, I expect the best from everybody. 

After that, one just hopes for the best. 

Fair enough, but is there a worry that three 

of the six batsmen (Virender Sehwag, V.V.S.Laxman and Yuvraj Singh) haven?t been 

contributing in recent international engagements? 

No... In any case, Veeru and Yuvraj came through beautifully 

in the practice match here last week... As for Laxman, he has never been short 

on motivation when it comes to taking runs off the Australians... He has done 

so many times in the past, beginning with that blazing 167 at the SCG (1999-2000) 

and it shouldn?t be any different this time. 

Will Matthew Hayden be the most prickly thorn? 

The Australians have many outstanding players... I?m 

seeing them collectively, not as exceptional individuals. 

How must we handle the Glenn McGraths and Shane 

Warnes? 

By playing every ball on merit... Even somebody like 

Jason Gillespie... He?s going to be bowling on flatter wickets and, therefore, 

the adjustment has to come from him. (Again, after a pause) We?ve got big 

runs against all the bowlers and there?s absolutely no reason to get overawed. 

Have you set yourself a target? 

(Laughs) To win the series... 

What will the wickets be like? 

Good to start with... The turn, however, is going 

to be there. 

One can?t but avoid talking of that epic 2000-01 

series...What, for you, is the most abiding memory? 

Victory at the Eden... Following-on and, then, creating 

history... That won?t ever be bettered... To me, nothing will ever mean more. 

You?ve ?grown? in the last three-and-half years... 

Experience, attitude, mental toughness... On all counts, 

I?m a better cricketer and captain. I?ve learnt from situations, learnt from mistakes... 

Right now, I?m confident of handling come what may. 

It?s for the first time in a Test series since 

you?ve been captain that Steve won?t be around. Are you going to ?miss? him? 

His retirement certainly brought one era to a close... 

I?ve always been a Steve admirer... Have seen him as a role model.... Respected 

his never-say-die attitude... Without him, yes, it will be a bit different. 

The final question: With Sunil Gavaskar as consultant, 

isn?t Wright?s position going to get diluted? 

Why should it? John remains the coach... What?s the 

doubt?

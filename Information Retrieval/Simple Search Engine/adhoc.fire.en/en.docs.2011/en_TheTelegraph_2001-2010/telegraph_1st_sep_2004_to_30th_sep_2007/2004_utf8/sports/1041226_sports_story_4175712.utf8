The Telegraph - Calcutta

 England target ninth straight win

 - SECOND TEST 

- Boje, Gibbs set to return; Kallis may not bowl yet 

 Herschelle Gibbs is likely to partner Smith 

as opener

Durban: England will seek to take advantage of an unsettled South African team in the second Test starting at Kingsmead on Boxing Day. 

A seven-wicket win in the first Test in Port Elizabeth gave England a significant edge in the five-match series. The tourists went in short of match practice and lost the toss but still dominated for the most part. 

England captain Michael Vaughan said he expects his team to improve. 

While England, who have won a record eight Tests in a row, have a settled team and are playing with confidence, South Africa are in a state of disarray at the end of a year in which they have plunged from second to sixth in the world Test rankings. 

Captain Graeme Smith bemoaned the lack of stability in South African cricket following several changes in key personnel, including a coach and convenor of selectors who are both interim appointees. 

In a newspaper column, Smith said: ?We desperately need to share a common goal and purpose in everything from racial representation to playing style to administrative structures. 

?As far as the team is concerned, we simply can?t succeed with ever-changing views on who, and why, certain players should play ahead of others.? 

A squad of 14 assembled in Durban on Friday with uncertainty over who would make the final XI. 

Herschelle Gibbs is likely to return to partner Smith as an opener but will have to pass a fitness test after playing only one game. He scored just four runs. 

Another key fitness issue is whether Jacques Kallis will be able to bowl. He played as a batsman only in the first Test because of an ankle injury. 

Selection convenor Haroon Lorgat said he was confident Kallis would be able to bowl but Smith was more cautious, saying: ?Jacques probably won?t be 100 per cent to start with.? 

If Kallis can bowl, home town batsman Hashim Amla is likely to bolster a batting order whose shortage of specialists was exposed by the disciplined England bowling attack. 

There is also expected to be debate on whether Thami Tsolekile or AB de Villiers will keep wicket. 

Tsolekile performed efficiently behind the stumps but De Villiers, 20, who opened the batting in Gibbs? absence in Port Elizabeth, is rated a much better batsman with the potential to develop into a wicketkeeper-batsman in the mould of Australia?s Adam Gilchrist. 

Swing bowler Charl Langeveldt, a match-winner for South Africa A when they beat England in the touring team?s only first-class match leading into the Test series, is expected to make his debut, while left-arm spinner Nicky Boje may return. 

Smith said his team needed to play consistently for five days, especially when they were under pressure. Kingsmead is one of the most pace-friendly pitches in South Africa, although preparation has been affected by recent rain, which may mean the surface is not as hard as it sometimes is. 

Although conditions usually favour bowlers in the first few hours, the pitch tends to flatten out, enabling batsmen to play strokes with confidence. 

While South Africa?s final line-up is far from certain, England are likely to retain the team that won in Port Elizabeth. 

The only key player who has not made a significant contribution on the tour so far is fast bowler Steve Harmison, but he is likely to relish the bounce he will get in Durban, while his rhythm is likely to improve as the tour progresses. 

 Simon Jones has been declared fit for the second Test 

Coach Duncan Fletcher said England had developed a team with ?mettle? and a successful formula based on hard work, which led to confidence and enjoyment. 

He warned, though, that the return of Gibbs and Boje would make South Africa a stronger team. 

Jones fit 

Meanwhile, England pace bowler Simon Jones has been declared fit for the second Test. Jones had been struggling with a stomach bug but said on Saturday: ?I felt seriously rough but I slept it off and yes, I?m definitely available for selection.?

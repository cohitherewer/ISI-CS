 Star Angel cantered home with Oaks on day of coups 

 STAR RACER

 Racing baron M.A.M. Ramaswamy has substantially cut down his visits to the city. His arrival for Christmas day races, therefore, sent a clear signal that it was not going to be a pleasure trip. 

 His wards picked up four events on the day. While the victory of his filly Star Angel in the Ladies? Derby, the 2,400m Usha Stud Calcutta Oaks, was quite on the cards, little importance was attached to his less fancied runners. But it was clever manoeuvrings by M.A.M.?s trainers, Daniel David and Errol Bhungard, that ensured fancy odds on winners, other than Star Angel, who was a raging hot favourite.

 Star Angel?s victory in the 1,000 Guineas, last month, was bloodless and her class was established. Her quarter-money price in the Oaks? betting was, therefore, convincing enough that the Placerville-Amazing Princess daughter would stay the Derby trip comfortably. And she did full justice to her followers. Settled in third behind pace-setting stable-duo of Regal Fortune and Make A Wish, Jockey C. Rajendra let her make her own running 600m from home to win handsomely.

 Daniel?s quiet operation in the 1,200m Breeders? Cup was a smart doing. His Imperial Dynasty (Rajendra up) went to the start as an 11-10 but stable?s 5-1 chance Pure Valour (Kariappa) returned a facile winner. There was no foul play in the race despite the fact that the favourite was receiving weight from the winner. More importantly, the favourite was fully ridden out by C. Rajendra against the winner, a Conquering Hero-Moon Spell son, who is definitely a better breed. 

 Bungard?s Midas Touch, a six-year-old, won a thrilling encounter against two youngsters ? Bountiful Pleasure, a 4-10 hot-fancy, and Bollywood Dreams in the 1,600m Darbhanga Cup. The defeat of the favourite, however, did not surprise those who were in the know that all was not well with Bountiful Pleasure. Nevertheless, full credit to Rajendra who rode a well-judged race. When the favourite took a sizeable lead 600m from home, Midas Touch was yet to get into full motion in the mid-bunch. But Rajendra timed his challenge to necessity when Bountiful showed first hint of distress inside the last furlong. The Bollywood, too, came with an equal brilliance from a similar position but Rajendra?s handling proved decisive for the winner. 

 There was another smart M.A.M.-coup in the concluding event, the Goldfinder Handicap. With Ballet Master cornering a sizeable betting, the odds of Noble Investment, a comparatively better-prepared horse for the event, expanded like India rubber. He went to the start at 5?s having opened as a 6-4 favourite. However, Noble Investment brought about cheers for those who mustered courage to stay by his side, as he looked a winner long way from home. Ballet Master, who rarely in the past had felt comfortable with heavier weights, was no threat to the winner at any stage of the race. He ended up a poor fourth. 

 Singh bothers, Bharath and Vijay, and Farley Rodrigues, too, had a winner apiece in the seven-event card. While Bharath?s Ardella won the 1,600m Amrit Bhushan Gujral Memorial Cup the way the filly liked, Vijay?s debutant Serrafina had to fight tooth and nail to conquer Juneau in the Astrodance Handicap. Rodrigues? Capistrano defied her dicky legs to foil a big gamble on Wild Country, who would have definitely lost the second berth had Night Glade not burst blood vessels.

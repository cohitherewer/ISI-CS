The Telegraph - Calcutta

 ASEAN rally set for bumpy ride

 - Sponsor commitment low for mega project 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: The inaugural India-ASEAN car rally championship is set to start on November 23 on a trip of nearly 8,000 km (up from the original 5,000 km with the late inclusion of Malaysia, Singapore and a symbolic Indonesia), but no clear picture has evolved yet on the sponsorship issue. The Rs 5 crore budget (down from the original which was almost double that) is a float that comprises few firm commitments so far. 

And with a little over a month left for the project to take off, the Indian bureaucracy seems to have dipped its hands into a bit of political correctness, involving many more states to send ?a few cars each? way over to Guwahati from where Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will do the ceremonial flag-off. 

The original idea, when mooted in Bali ? just about a year back to the day ? by former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, was to have a rally, and business could piggyback on it (as first reported by The Telegraph in January). The strength of the rally, as a prime mover, has weakened it seems, though the scope remains as large. 

At a press conference here on Wednesday Chandra Mohan Bhandari, additional secretary at the Ministry of External Affairs and secretary general of the rally committee, said that only Tata Motors and JK Tyres have confirmed participation and Mahindra and Mahindra ?may come in?. Tata Motors, of course are the provider of the SUVs, and JK Tyre have always associated themselves with the sport. 

?That apart, some oil PSUs and the likes of GAIL, ONGC Videsh (they have a stake in the energy fields of Myanmar), are expected to come in,? Bhandari said. Proton, the car-makers from Malaysia are expected to put in a presence, and no talk of Maruti-Suzuki is heard, not yet at least. 

Rally commission chairman and FMSCI vice-president (FMSCI has the technical responsibility) Rajat Majumdar said he was planning an ASEAN motoring federation to look into motor sports in the entire region ?like in America and in Europe?, and the basics of the blueprint is ready. It, probably, could be the only sustainability factor in the rallying/motoring aspect of the venture. That could be a possible situation when neither will the rally be on the sidelines of business, nor business on the sidelines of a rally. 

The unification attempt of the two objectives looks pretty amateurish so far, and though Bhandari said that interest was keen abroad to have a reverse ASEAN rally in the future (a bigger part in India, starting off from a smaller part in the ASEAN region), the road to that remains as long and arduous as this traverse itself. 

?The final attempt is to push it towards the Paris-Dakar mould,? what was both Majumdar and Bhandari agreed upon. ?There are good sector rallies in Singapore and Malaysia and I have been approached by them on the extension of this,? said Bhandari. The cash-strapped FIA, the world body, wouldn?t disagree on any extras in the region. 

Maybe a little more throttle would see the objective zip through the ideas highway.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 EB hoping to displace Bagan

 - Bhowmick undecided on Sasthi, Dipankar 

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Buoyed by the Durand Cup victory, holders East Bengal will take on Tollygunge Agragami at the Kalyani Stadium on Tuesday with a single point agenda ? a win that will help displace Mohun Bagan (36 points off 16 matches) from the top of CFL Super Division table. 

But there?s another focus to the match ? marking the Super Division?s resumption after about two months. Questions doing the round are whether it will witness the return of Sasthi Duley and Dipankar Roy. 

The duo, who were arrested on charges of being associated with a noted criminal and later released on bail, practised with the team at the stadium on Monday morning. 

Coach Subhas Bhowmick, who joined the team in Kalyani in the evening, however, refused to comment on the possibility of fielding them in the starting XI. 

The worry for the coach, though, is the non-availability of some key players in his team?s Round XVI match. Douglas da Silva, the current top-scorer in the Super Division, is injured while Syed Rahim Nabi, Climax Lawrence and Alvito D?Cunha are in Muscat to play their last World Cup qualifier against Oman. Bijen Singh is also ruled out with double yellow. 

Chandan Das, who emerged hero in the Durand Cup final, is expected to join the squad on Tuesday morning. Tollygunge, on the other hand, have collected 26 points from 16 matches and coach Biswajit Bhattacharjee has the first-choice team at his disposal. 

East Bengal discard Suley Musah, who has joined Tollygunge, however, will not be able to play the match due to an IFA ruling which states that any foreigner who has turned out for one club in the league cannot play for another in the same season. The rule also applies to East Bengal?s Earnest Chukwuma Jeremiah, who switched allegiance from Ever-Ready.

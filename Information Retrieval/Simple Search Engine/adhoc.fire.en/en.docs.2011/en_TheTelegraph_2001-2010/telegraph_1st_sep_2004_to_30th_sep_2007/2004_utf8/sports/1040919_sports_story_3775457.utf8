The Telegraph - Calcutta

 EB leave with high hopes

 A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: East Bengal left for Damascus late Saturday night in a positive frame of mind for their must-win return-leg AFC Cup tie against Syria?s Al Jaish. 

The match is slated for Wednesday. Still ruing a barren draw in their home match, Subhas Bhowmick?s boys were cautiously optimistic. The 19-member squad is led by Sangram Mukherjee and includes Gurpreet Singh and Akshay Das. 

?We are not going to give up easily. If they could hold us for a draw here, why can?t we do it? The penalty shoot out will then come into effect, where anything can happen,? Subhas Bhowmick said during practice on Friday. 

The coach said they were travelling ?with the purpose of winning?, and there was no point in ?losing after putting up a tough fight?. 

?I have analysed the Syrian side. They are solid in some areas but also have flaws. If we can play to a plan and, execute the chances that come our way, there?s no reason why we cannot win,? Bhowmick said. 

East Bengal, who badly missed the injured Bhaichung Bhutia at the Salt Lake Stadium, would face a similar problem in the away match as well. The AFC has also turned down East Bengal?s plea for granting clearance to new Brazilian recruit Paolo Roberto da Silva. 

?We have to field more or less the same side in the return-leg match due to the limited options available,? Bhowmick said. 

The team has included Gurpreet Singh and Akshay Das in the squad while omitting Tushar Rakshit for the away tie. 

THE SQUAD 

Sangram Mukherjee, Rajat Ghosh Dastidar, Suley Musah, Dipak Mondal, Climax Lawrence, Madhab Das, Douglas da Silva, Debjit Ghosh, Sashthi Duley, Shylo Malsawmtluanga, Dipankar Roy, Alvito D?Cunha, Bijen Singh, Surya Bikash Chakraborty, Selvyn Fernandes, Syed Rahim Nabi, Chandan Das, Gurpreet Singh, Akshay Das.

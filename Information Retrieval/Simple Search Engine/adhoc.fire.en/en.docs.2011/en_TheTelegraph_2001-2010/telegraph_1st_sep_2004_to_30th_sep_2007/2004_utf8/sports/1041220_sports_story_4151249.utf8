 New Delhi: Overnight leader Jeev Milkha Singh 

 squandered a four-stroke lead and a golden chance of winning 

 his maiden Japanese PGA Tour title when he carded a two-over 

 73 in the final round to finish joint second in the Asia 

 Japan Okinawa Open golf championship on Sunday. 

 The Indian ended up just one stroke short of the eventual 

 winner, Kiyoshi Miyazato of Japan, with a tournament tally 

 of 13-under 271. 

Jeev, who shared the second place along with five others, earned 5,416,666 yen for his effort, according to information received here. 

Local hero Miyazato fired a superb seven-under 64 to pocket the winner?s cheque with an aggregate of 14-under 270 in the tournament played at the par-71 Naha golf club. 

Jeev?s final round started with a bogey but the 32-year-old made up with birdies on the fourth and sixth to make the turn at one-under. 

However, the very first hole of his return journey, the par-5 tenth, witnessed Jeev take five strokes to get to the green followed by a double bogey. The Chandigarh pro then went on to drop another shot on the 16th but made up with a birdie on the 17th. 

Jeev would have taken Miyazato into a play-off but for the fact that he dropped another shot on the 18th, his closing hole. 

The Indian, who had shot a superb nine-under 62 on the second day to surge into contention, finished the tournament with an impressive 23 birdies.

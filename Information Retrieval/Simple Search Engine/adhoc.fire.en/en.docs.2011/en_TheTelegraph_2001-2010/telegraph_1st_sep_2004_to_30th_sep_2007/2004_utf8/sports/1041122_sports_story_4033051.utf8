 PCB clears Shoaib

Karachi: Pakistan fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar is free to play in English county side Worcestershire next year, provided his national duties are not affected, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said on Sunday. 

?We have no objection to Shoaib?s playing in county as long as it does not coincide with the national team?s duties,? a PCB spokesman said. 

?Pakistan is not scheduled to play in the period when Shoaib is signed to play for Worcestershire, but if any international commitment comes up out of schedule then he will have to return to play for Pakistan,? he said. 

Shoaib, one of the fastest bowlers in the world, will join the second division team in July, following Pakistan?s tour of the West Indies.

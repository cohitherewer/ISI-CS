 Changes in Indian squad won?t affect us: Border 

Mumbai: Former Australian Test captain Allan Border on Sunday said the four changes to the Indian squad would not stop the world champions from winning the fourth and final Test and complete a 3-0 rout of the hosts. ?I don?t think four new faces in the Indian squad will make much difference to the Australians,? Border said. 

?We will go all out to win the Mumbai Test and as we are leading 2-0 with one match to go, I don?t think the new faces would matter much,? he said. ?The Australians had done their home work this time round unlike in the previous away series and did not let the Indian top-order batsmen to settle down in any of the three Tests so far,? Border, who led Australia to their first World Cup victory in 1987 in India, said after a game of golf with leggie Shane Warne and former teammate Dean Jones.

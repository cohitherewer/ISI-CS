The Telegraph - Calcutta

A warning note for F1

- Clearly, I feel that we should share more revenues, says Jean Todt

 Barrichello, who won Italian GP on Sunday

Monza: Even in the most one-sided Formula One season in years, champions Ferrari still have the ability to astonish. 

Their eighth one-two finish in 15 races was met with some amazement as Brazilian Rubens Barrichello led seven times world champion Michael Schumacher across the line in Sunday?s Italian Grand Prix.It was one of the Maranello team?s most dominant performances of the year but it had looked far from that initially. 

With Schumacher spinning off on the first lap, rejoining at the rear, and Barrichello pitting for new tyres after just five laps, the glorious homecoming could so easily have turned into a nightmare. Instead clever strategy, and Ferrari?s ability to lap far faster than their rivals in the heat of battle, paid off. 

?At the beginning of the race I thought maybe it would be our first race without scoring points,? confessed team boss Jean Todt afterwards. ?Then I thought one or two points and slowly the points were improving.? 

Already with more wins (12) in a single season than any other driver in the history of Formula One, Schumacher should be back on the top step of the podium soon ? possibly in the inaugural Chinese Grand Prix in two weeks? time. 

But even as the motorhomes were being packed up around him in the Monza paddock, with teams turning their backs on Europe for the season?s three final long-haul races, Todt was sounding a note of warning. 

All may be well with Ferrari on the track, but Formula One as a whole is suffering off it. Some of the teams were struggling and unless something was done, the Frenchman said, they might not be back. 

?Clearly I feel that we should share more revenues, but that?s not a secret,? said Todt. ?As long as major manufacturers are involved (in Formula One), it will cost money and then it?s very difficult for the small teams to get engines and to find the money. 

?The economic situation is not very good, so definitely there are some risks of losing teams next year ? one, two, three and then it will definitely damage Formula One. 

?We have seen some teams which have disappeared ? Prost and Arrows. Some teams are really struggling...the balance is not easy.? 

Ralf return 

German Ralf Schumacher will finally return to the cockpit at Silverstone on Tuesday after spending the last three months on the sidelines through injury.

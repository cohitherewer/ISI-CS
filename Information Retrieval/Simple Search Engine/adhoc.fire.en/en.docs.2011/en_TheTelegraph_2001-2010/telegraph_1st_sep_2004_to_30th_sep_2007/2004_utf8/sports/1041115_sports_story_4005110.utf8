 IN THE CITY

 East Bengal seem to have finally come out of the shadow of police problems involving two of their players. That will allow the red-golds to take on Tollygunge Agragami in their league engagement in a better frame of mind in Kalyani Tuesday.

 Sasthi Duley and Dipankar Roy practised with the team at their home ground Sunday. Coach Subhas Bhowmick put all his wards through the paces. Duley said he was only ?eager to be back into football? and would refuse to think of ?anything else?. The team is expected to move to Kalyani Monday to be able to practise there for a day before the match.

 Central Calcutta men and Hooghly women claimed the respective team titles in the 70th state and inter-district table tennis championships at Netaji Indoor Stadium Sunday. In the men?s team event, Central Calcutta trounced Hooghly 3-0. In women?s, Hooghly defeated Siliguri by same margin. 

 CHESS: Ninth round of International Open meet at Gorky Sadan from 2pm.

 TABLE TENNIS: 70th state and inter-district championships at Netaji Indoor Stadium from 9 am.

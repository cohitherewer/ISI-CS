The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Bhutia appeal to fans

 A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Bhaichung Bhutia had no role to play in Saturday?s ?big? match, but the India captain is not one who can stay away from the arc-lights too long. Having watched his team draw goalless with Mohun Bagan from the Salt Lake Stadium press box, the much-in-demand striker wore a different hat at the post-match conference. 

?I appeal to all football-loving fans of the city to support the team when they take on Al Jaish in the AFC Cup quarter final on Wednesday? East Bengal will be representing India, so forget club loyalty and turn up at the ground to cheer the players,? Bhutia said, sitting beside club secretary Kalyan Majumdar. 

Bhutia, nursing a leg injury, will of course miss the Al Jaish tie, just as he had to sit out the Japan game. ?You feel bad missing these international games, but what to do? Injuries are part of sport and you have to take them in your stride,? he said, camouflaging his disappointment like a true pro. 

Satisfied with his team?s performance on Saturday, Bhutia said: ?The boys played quite well in the second half creating a number of openings? I didn?t see Mohun Bagan get a single chance after half-time.?

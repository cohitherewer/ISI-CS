 Jharkhand concede slender lead

A CORRESPONDENT

Jamshedpur: Despite opener Manish Vardhan?s fighting 94, Jharkhand conceded a slender six run lead to Kerala in their first innings of the Ranji Trophy Plate Group A tie at Keenan Stadium on Monday. 

Jharkhand were all out for 315, one-and-a half hour after tea on Day III, when Vardhan was castled by Sreesanth. At stumps, Kerala were 18 for no loss. Visitors lead by 24 runs. 

Resuming at 159 for four, Jharkhand lost Mohit Goyal with the addition of just three runs on the board. Kerala pacers Tinu Yohanan and Sreesanth bowled with lot of fire in the early stages of the game to arrest the run flow. A lot depended on former Bihar captain Sunil Kumar. But, he fell for 10. 

Jharkhand went to lunch at 254 for six. Skipper Sumit Panda added 59 for the seventh wicket with Vardhan. 

The hosts lost their captain for 35 when he was looking to settle down. Shahid Khan soon returned to the pavilion to compound the team?s problem. 

However, Vardhan and debutant Shahbaz Nadeem frustrated the Kerala bowlers with dogged batting.

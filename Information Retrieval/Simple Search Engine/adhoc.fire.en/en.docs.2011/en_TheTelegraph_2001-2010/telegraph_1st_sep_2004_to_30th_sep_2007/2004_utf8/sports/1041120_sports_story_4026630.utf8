 Gagandeep hattrick floors Assam

Amritsar: A hattrick by Gagandeep Singh, who bagged six for 26, helped hosts Punjab defeat Assam by an innings and 51 runs on the fourth and final day of their Ranji Trophy Elite group B match on Friday. 

Resuming at 146 for seven, the visitors added 12 runs on Friday. Assam, asked to follow on with a 209-run deficit, folded up for 158 in their second innings. 

In Mumbai, Devendra Bundela struck an unbeaten century to ensure Madhya Pradesh collect two points from their Elite group A tie against holders Mumbai, which petered to a draw here Friday. 

In Bangalore, an altercation broke out between some players of Karnataka and Gujarat during their Ranji Trophy Elite Group A match. 

Gujarat?s Hitesh Majumdar and Karnataka?s Tilak Naidu got engaged in a verbal duel when the former objected to ?delaying tactics? being adopted by Karnataka?s Dodda Ganesh. 

With the last over to be bowled, Ganesh called for new protection gear. When Majumdar objected, Naidu raised his willow in a threatening gesture, forcing umpires Rajan K. Seth and Sudhi Asnani to intervene. They reported the incident to match referee Subrata Banerjee, who warned the errant players but decided against any punitive action.

Lahore: Spain claimed their maiden Champions Trophy hockey title beating defending champions Holland 4-2 in a thrilling final at the National Stadium here on Sunday. 

Spain proved their prowess with three strikes after the break to rattle their opponents, who were seeking to win their third successive title. 

Pau Quemeda (18), Santiago Friexa (51 and 62) and Victor Sojo (57) scored for the winners, while Taeke Taekema (43) and Karel Klaver (61) sounded the board for Holland. 

Spain took the lead through Quemada who flicked to the right of goalkeeper Guus Vogels from a penalty corner as his side went to half time with a 1-0 lead. 

Holland, stunned by the early reverses, fought back hard to draw parity when Taekema?s drag-flick sent the ball crashing into the net at shoulder height giving the Spanish defenders no chance at all. 

Eight minutes later, Spain took charge, with Freixa sounding the board with a low shot to the left side of the post that was deflected in by a Dutch defender. 

The Spaniards swelled the lead further when Sojo scored off a rebound after David Alegre?s goal bound shot was saved by Vogels. 

Even though Holland threatened to bounce back with a Klaver goal in the 61st minute, Friexa came up with his second strike a minute later to ensure Spain?s maiden title. 

 Germany finish fifth 

New Zealand were relegated from the elite six after suffering a 1-2 defeat to Germany in the classification match for the last two places on Sunday. 

Germany ended their campaign on a positive note after Florian Keller?s brace ensured victory for the side. 

After a barren first half, Keller?s goals in the 43rd and 53rd minutes gave the Germans a 2-0 lead before Bevan Hari reduced the margin just a minute before the hooter. 

The world champions, playing with an experimental side, gained an automatic entry into the next edition of the event, to be held in Chennai, while New Zealand will be playing the qualifiers for a berth in the six-nation tournament. 

New Zealand paid dearly for missing several chances on either side of the break and their misery was further compounded when umpire Virendra Singh of India disallowed a goal by Darren Smith just seconds before the half time.

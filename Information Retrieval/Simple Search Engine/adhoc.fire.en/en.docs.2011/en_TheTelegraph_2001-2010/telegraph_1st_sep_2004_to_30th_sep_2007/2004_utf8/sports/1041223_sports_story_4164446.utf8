 Smith wants greater say

Durban: South African cricket captain Graeme Smith would like to have a greater say in selecting the national team which has been on a downslide for the past few months. 

?At the moment I am only consulted and I have no vote,? Smith said in an interview, a day after his team suffered a seven-wicket defeat to England in the first Test in Port Elizabeth. 

He was speaking from the western Cape Town of Knysna where he is spending Christmas holiday with his parents before the start of the second Test here on Sunday. 

Clearly disappointed over the loss to England, the captain told a Johannesburg radio station, that there should also be greater stability as far as team management was concerned. 

 Gibbs back 

Herschelle Gibbs was named on Wednesday in the South African squad for the second and third Tests against England. Gibbs, who has recovered from a hand injury, is almost certain to return to his opening slot alongside captain Graeme Smith. 

Uncapped fast bowler Charl Langeveldt, who had match figures of seven for 73 in South Africa A?s victory over England in Potchefstroom, has also been included in the 14-man squad for the next two matches.

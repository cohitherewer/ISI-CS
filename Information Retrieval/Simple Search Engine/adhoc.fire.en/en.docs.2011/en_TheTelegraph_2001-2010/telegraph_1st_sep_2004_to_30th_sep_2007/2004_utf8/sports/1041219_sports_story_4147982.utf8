Santos: Kidnappers on Friday freed the mother of Santos forward 

Robinho, one of Brazil?s most talented young players, 40 days after seizing her 

at gunpoint while she was attending a barbecue.

Marina de Souza was discovered when she knocked on the door of a 

house in the working-class district of Perus on the outskirts of Sao Paulo, after 

being released from captivity nearby, the residents told Brazilian television.

The police were called, she was taken to hospital for a check-up 

and then driven home and reunited with Robinho. ?There?s nothing better than seeing 

your mother happy and laughing,? the 20-year-old striker told a media conference 

on Friday. ?I can have a happy Christmas with my family whether or not we win 

the title.

Milan: Serie A leaders Juventus will don shirts with Olympic 

logos and fill their pitch with mascots to help the cash-strapped organisers for 

Turin?s 2006 Winter Games drum up some publicity, a government official said on 

Friday.

The club, drawn earlier in the day to play nine-time European champions 

Real Madrid in the last 16 of the Champions League, pledged to take over some 

Olympic advertising after Turin?s committee said it was short of the necessary 

funds.

?They (Juve) are going to help us. There will be speeches, mascots 

on the pitch, an exchange of mascots, posters in the stadium and shirts with the 

Games logo,? culture ministry under-secretary and Games supervisor said.

Frankfurt: In the land of beer, a politician is pushing for 

milk to be sold at 2006 World Cup stadiums. The governor of lower-saxony state, 

Christian Wulff, wrote open letters to Fifa chief Sepp Blatter and organising

to be set up at World Cup stadiums. One of the stadiums is in Hanover, where Wulff?s 

government is based. Two milk bars have been set up and those are running successfully.

Belfast: A footballer was given a 30-year ban here on Saturday 

for headbutting a referee during an amateur match. Victor Sproule, 32, attacked 

Jim Edwards after he abandoned a game in South Belfast. The match saw another 

player barred for five years for racial abuse directed at Edwards, a Scot. Northern 

Ireland Referees? Association secretary Basil Marshall praised the punishments

Vienna: Hans Knauss, one of the best known Austrian skiers, 

has tested positive for the anabolic steroid nandrolone. Knauss, Giant Slalom 

world championship silver medallist in February 2003, raced in a super-G event 

at Val Gardena, Italy, on Friday, finishing sixth.

London: Seven-times Order of Merit winner Colin Montgomerie 

has ruled out the prospect of captaining Europe?s Ryder Cup team at the K Club

on Saturday.

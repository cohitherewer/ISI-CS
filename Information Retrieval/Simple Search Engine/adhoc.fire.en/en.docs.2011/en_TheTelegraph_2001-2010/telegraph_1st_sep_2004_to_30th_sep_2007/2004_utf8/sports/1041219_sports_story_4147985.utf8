The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Rushmi beats Ankita to title

 Rushmi 

New Delhi: Top seed Rushmi Chakravarthi used her experience against young Ankita Bhambri to claim the Le Meridien $10,000 ITF women?s tournament at the NTA in Gurgaon on Saturday. 

Rushmi outlasted second seed Ankita 6-7 (5-7), 7-6 (7-2), 6-4 in a hard-fought battle after the match had been delayed by 15 minutes due to heavy fog. 

Both players looked hungry and determined, but it was Rushmi who won the day with her more consistent play. 

The 27-year-old Chennai girl, who had been knocked out in the first round of the Calcutta meet, played the big points better. 

Ankita, serving for the first set at 5-4, dropped her serve at a critical juncture. Ankita, who won the title in Calcutta, came right back to force a tie-breaker which she captured 7-5. 

Both finalists struggled with their serves in the second set. It was Rushmi who rallied to take the match to the decider. 

In the decider, it was a case of who would hang in and commit lesser mistakes. 

Ankita?s lack of experience showed as she lost nerve to drop serve at 4-4. Rushmi did not let that opportunity slip and closed out the match in style. 

Rushmi received a cheque for $1,600 and six WTA points while Ankita got $1,000 and four points. (PTI)

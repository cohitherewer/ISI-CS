 India still have hope

New Delhi: A seventh-place finish in the Athens Olympics was certainly not enough for the India hockey team to earn a berth in the Champions Trophy, but the side could still make it to the elite six-nation meet albeit by default. 

The Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) officials are keeping fingers crossed as two of the six teams in fray Australia and New Zealand are contemplating pulling out of the December 4-12 meet in Lahore, on security grounds. 

Hockey Australia chief executive Lyndon Adamson has reportedly said he had asked organisers for details of security plans after the Australian government last month renewed its warning for citizens to avoid all non-essential travel to Pakistan because of possible terrorist attacks. 

Similarly, New Zealand Hockey Federation (NZHF) chief executive Ramesh Patel has said that the NZHF would contact its Australian counterpart, ministry of foreign affairs and trade as well as the International Hockey Federation (FIH) before taking a decision on whether to proceed to Lahore. 

[The Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF) reacted quickly, saying extensive security arrangements would be in place for the Lahore meet. There are no security problems in Pakistan and, through the FIH, we have assured foolproof security arrangement for all the teams, PHF secretary Brigadier Musaratullah Khan told AFP. 

Some members of the Olympic gold medal-winning Australian squad are concerned about the visit to Pakistan. 

It has been talked about and there are some guys who are saying they dont think it is the right idea to send a team there, said Aussie player Nathan Eglington. 

The New Zealanders, who finished an impressive sixth at the Athens Games, also dont want to take any chances, as the countrys foreign affairs ministry still regards Pakistan a dangerous country to visit.

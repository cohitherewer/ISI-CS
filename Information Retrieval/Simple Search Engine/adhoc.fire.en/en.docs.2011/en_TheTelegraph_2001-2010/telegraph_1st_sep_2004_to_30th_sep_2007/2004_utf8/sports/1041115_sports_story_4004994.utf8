Jaipur: Sairaj Bahutule exposed South Africans? vulnerability against spin with a four-wicket haul as the Board President?s XI fought back on the opening day of the three-day tour match at Sawai Mansingh Stadium here Sunday. 

The visitors were off to a rollicking start as their top order made most of a placid track with some aggressive strokemaking, before Bahutule?s spin ensnared them. 

The South Africans lost four wickets to the Mumbai leg-spinner for 53 runs in the evening session, as they slid from a strong position of 164 for one at tea. They finally declared their first innings at 226 for five. The hosts? captain finished with four for 65. 

At stumps, the hosts were four for no loss with Dheeraj Jadhav on three and Gautam Gambhir on zero at the crease. 

In the morning, Graeme Smith and his boys lived up to their pre-match statement of playing aggressive cricket and putting the pressure on the hosts. Smith dominated the two partnerships he shared with opener Jacques Rudolph and Justin Ontong. After adding 72 runs for the opening stand, the captain featured in a 92-run association with Ontong. 

Smith, however, perished as he stepped out to Bahutule off the second ball after tea to be stumped by Mahendra Singh Dhoni. His 86 came off 172 balls and contained five hits to the fence. Smith, who won the toss, handled both spinners and fast bowlers with equal ease. The captain started with a glance to third man boundary of Amit Bhandari and then drove off-spinner Ramesh Powar through the on side. 

While, Smith attacked the bowling at one end, Ontong ? who has been included as a specialist spinner ? showed maturity at the other. 

His enterprising knock of 70 that consumed 146 balls and spanned 183 minutes, was studded with five fours and a six off Powar. The 24-year old was quick on his feet against the spinners and looked comfortable both on the front and off the back foot. 

Owing to the placid nature of the track, spin had to be introduced in the eighth over. 

The hosts got a lucky break when Rudolph failed to beat Bhandari?s throw from fine-leg while attempting a second run. The left hander?s 26 from 102 balls included three fours. 

Rudolph?s dismissal was the only success the hosts could manage before tea. However, it was in the post-tea session that the tide turned in favour of the Board President?s XI as Smith and Ontong decided to go all out. 

Ontong followed Smith while attempting to hoist Bahutule out of the ground only to be caught by Gambhir at mid-on. Jacques Kallis did not look happy with his leg before decision while Boeta Dippenaar succumbed to poor shot selection. 

Earlier, the Board President?s XI decided to field three opening batsmen in Gambhir, Jadhav and Sadagopan Ramesh. (PTI)

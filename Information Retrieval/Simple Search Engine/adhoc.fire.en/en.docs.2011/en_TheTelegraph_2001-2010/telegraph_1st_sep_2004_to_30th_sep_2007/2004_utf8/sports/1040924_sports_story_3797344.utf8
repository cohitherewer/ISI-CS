 UCBSA denies pullout threat 

Durban: South Africa?s tour to India in November will take place as scheduled and there are no threats by players to boycott the tour, the United Cricket Board of South Africa (UCBSA) said on Thursday. 

Moabi Litheko, media officer for the cricket board, said the players have just returned from England and they had not given any indication of skipping the tour. 

?The United Cricket Board enjoys very good relations with India and there is no question of players boycotting any tour. In any case it will be against the rules of the ICC,? Litheko said. ?As far as we are concerned the tour is on and the players for the tour will be selected at the end of October,? he said. 

Litheko was reacting to news reports that South Africa may pull out of the Test series if there was no assurance that two of their players ?Herschelle Gibbs and Nicky Boje ? would not be prosecuted during the series. 

?The Indian authorities have not given us any indication whether they will question the players but we are negotiating with them. We have not yet received any indication,? Litheko added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Shepherd too being treated

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Shepherd suffered a cut on the ring finger of his left hand 

Nagpur: The Indian cricketers aren?t the only 

ones calling on the medical fraternity here ? veteran umpire David Shepherd too 

is getting treated! 

Shepherd, who stood in the Chennai Test as well, hurt 

himself in a fall in the hotel?s health club there. Specifically, he suffered 

a deep cut on the ring finger of his left hand, something which necessitated six 

stitches. 

That?s hardly forehead-creasing, but Shepherd is a diabetic and the wound took time healing. The stitches were removed the other evening, but the dressing is still being done. 

?I?m much better though, initially, I was in considerable 

pain,? Shepherd told The Telegraph after yet another visit to the doctor, 

on Tuesday evening.

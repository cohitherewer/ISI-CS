 Midfield worries Nayeem vs Andhra

 A CORRESPONDENT 

 Nayeem has a score to settle with Andhra coach 

New Delhi: Coach Syed Nayeemuddin is in a quandary about the composition of his midfield on the eve of his crucial cluster 1 match vs Andhra Pradesh in the 59th IOC-Santosh Trophy at the Nehru Stadium here. 

Both defensive midfielders Noel Wilson and Chandan Das are doubtful due to injury. In fact, Noel ? with a troublesome ankle ? wants to return home to Bangalore. In their place, coach Nayeem has limited options: young Sankha Roy Chowdhury of Ever-Ready Association and Amjad Hossain of Mohammedan Sporting. Amjad, though, is more comfortable as an attacking medio. 

The other problem for Bengal is the swollen left leg of ace playmaker Basudeb Mondal. However, Nayeem says that the swelling is subsiding and he hopes Basudeb will be fit by the morning. 

Bengal need a draw to ensure progress to the quarter final. Andhra and Bengal are on 3 points each, but Bengal beat Mizoram 5-1, whereas Andhra managed a 2-0 win over the same opponents. 

Nayeem, understandably, feels that going for a draw is the wrong option. He wants an attacking game, relying on the speed of Syed Rahim Nabi and Mehtab Hussain. 

There is some tension between Nayeem and the coach of Andhra Pradesh, Habib Ali Khan. When Nayeem was coach of Andhra Pradesh during the National Games in 2002, Habib Ali did not release some players from his institutional side South Central Railway for the state team. So it?s a matter of pride as well, for Nayeem. 

The only cheer for the beleaguered Bengal camp was that Habibur Rehman Mondal?s MRI head scan report showed there was no major injury and so Nayeem took him for stretching exercises in the evening. In case of an emergency Habibur may be tried out. 

Meanwhile, in matches on Tuesday, Punjab from cluster V and Karnataka from cluster VI qualified for the quarter finals with all-win records. Punjab today beat Meghalaya 3-0 and Karnataka routed Rajasthan 7-0. 

Incidentally, Karnataka have not called for their domicile players internationals S. Venkatesh and Noel Wilson and are relying on home based players. In cluster 2, Delhi?s chances of qualifying improved with a 3-1 win over Assam, Mohun Bagan?s Sunil Chhetri scoring twice. He is now the tournament?s top-scorer with six goals.

 Hewitt takes crazy conference in stride

 - After fielding questions on outer space, Karol Beck poses no problems

 Lleyton Hewitt in action against Karol Beck on Tuesday. Hewitt won 6-4, 6-2, 6-2 

It might have looked easy for Lleyton Hewitt on Tuesday (6-4, 6-2, 6-2 in an hour and 40 minutes) but very few of the spectators inside the Arthur Ashe Stadium would have known just how impressive a performance it had been from a man with a hopelessly scrambled brain. Karol Beck, of Slovenia, might have been a pushover on paper, but not when you?re still in trauma from the previous day?s press conference. 

The Australian is a bit wary of the media at the best of times, but after breezing through his previous match against Spaniard Feliciano Lopez, what should have been an equally comfortable media briefing left him at best reaching for smelling salts, and at worst in urgent need of counselling. 

It began with the usual stuff about double-handed backhands, and first-serve percentages, but just when Hewitt was starting to relax, he was hit by what?s known over here as a curve ball out of left field. The exchange is worth recording verbatim. 

Female American reporter at back of room: ?What?s your favourite outer space movie, and why?? 

Hewitt: ?Er, I think you must be at the wrong press conference. We?re playing tennis here, aren?t we? Who are you?? 

Reporter: ?It?s for Nickelodeon magazine. For the celebrity page space issue.? 

Hewitt: ?Well, I don?t watch too many space movies.? 

Reporter: ?Have you ever thought about being an astronaut?? 

Hewitt (whose eyes now bore the look of someone who?s been sniffing illegal substances): ?No.? 

For a man who has been known to rottweiler Australian journalists back home, this was a hopeless performance against an opponent playing the type of game he?d never experienced before. Victory in straight sets for the strange American lady, but you have to hand it to Hewitt for the way he played against Beck, knowing all along that another press conference was just around the corner. 

Hewitt is not famous for his sense of humour, otherwise he might have come through the door with a pair of pointy ears humming the theme tune to Star Trek, but this time the questions were all about tennis, and pretty boring it was, too, a bit like the match against Beck. 

Beck is not exactly box-office, and Hewitt described him before the match as ?compact?, which didn?t sound like a compliment. The Slovenian recently beat Tim Henman on grass in the second round of the pre-Wimbledon Queen?s tournament. 

Henman?s style is more or less made for a counter-puncher like Hewitt, and apart from a boomerang, nothing in Australia comes back with such relentless monotony as a tennis ball landing on Hewitt?s side of the net. 

Hewitt broke serve in the first set when Beck, having punched away what he clearly thought was a certain winner, looked on in astonishment as the Australian, on the run and at full stretch, conjured up a backhand lob that plopped on to the baseline. Which is all it took for Beck to realise the game was up after a semi-competitive first half an hour.

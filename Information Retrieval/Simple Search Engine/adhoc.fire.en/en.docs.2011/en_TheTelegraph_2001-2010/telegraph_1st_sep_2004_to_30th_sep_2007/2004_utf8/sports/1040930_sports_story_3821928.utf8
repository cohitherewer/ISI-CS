 Sachin refuses to rule himself out 

 Sachin feels his tennis elbow has improved a lot 

Mumbai: Reporting ?tremendous improvement? in his tennis elbow that has kept him out of cricket for the past six weeks, batting maestro Sachin Tendulkar on Wednesday refused to rule himself out of the first Test against Australia in Bangalore on October 6. 

Tendulkar turned up at the Brabourne Stadium on Wednesday morning wearing a two-inch brace on his left elbow. He was there to cheer his Mumbai teammates who take on the Australians in the tour opener on Thursday. 

?I feel much better. There?s tremendous improvement,? Sachin said, adding however that there has been a muscle loss in his elbow, which should be built gradually. 

On his chances of playing the first Test, he said, ?I am not (ruling myself out). I am waiting for the doctors to give the green signal and let them know how I feel. 

?Obviously there?s not enough strength (on the affected part). I have not played or practised for six weeks on doctors? advice. I have to go step by step, build it (strength) up gradually,? the master batsman said. 

Asked how much net practice would be required to get match fit, he replied, ?as much as possible, but only if circumstances permit it. There?s been a muscle loss and I have to build it up gradually. Basically I have been advised rest. I have to take gradual steps. Initially I would be using a lighter bat to practice with,? Tendulkar said. 

On whether he would be mentally prepared to take on the Aussies if certified fit at the eleventh hour, Tendulkar said, ?I have no option. I would very much like to play as early as possible.? 

Sourav Ganguly, meanwhile, welcomed the news that Tendulkar could play the first Test. ?Tendulkar is not ruled out, we know that. It?s good. As I said before, even if he makes himself available the day before the Test match, he picks himself,? the captain said in Bangalore. (PTI)

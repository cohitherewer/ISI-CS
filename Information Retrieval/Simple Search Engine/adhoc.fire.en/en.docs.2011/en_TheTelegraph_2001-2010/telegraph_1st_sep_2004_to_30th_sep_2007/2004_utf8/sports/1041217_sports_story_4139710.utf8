 Iceland offers Fischer a home

 Tokyo: Fugitive chess master 

 Bobby Fischer has been offered a new home in Iceland, where 

 he won a classic victory in 1972, but it is unclear whether 

 he will be able to make the move from his detention in Japan. 

Fischer?s Icelandic fans said they had persuaded Fischer, wanted by Washington for playing a 1992 chess match in Yugoslavia in violation of sanctions, to write to their government requesting residency and that it was granted. 

?Bobby Fischer has been wanted for 12 years for playing chess in a country that no longer exists, according to laws that no one has been incriminated for before,? Icelandic chess fan Hrafn Jokulsson said from Reykjavik on Thursday. 

An official at Iceland?s embassy in Tokyo said an embassy staffer would visit Fischer and give him the permit. 

But the former champion may not find a safe haven there since Iceland has signed a deportation agreement with its ally Washington, Iceland?s immigration chief Georg Larusson told local media. 

?If Fischer comes to Iceland the government would have an obligation to deport him if the US government requests it,? Morgunbladid newspaper reported, citing Larusson. (REUTERS)

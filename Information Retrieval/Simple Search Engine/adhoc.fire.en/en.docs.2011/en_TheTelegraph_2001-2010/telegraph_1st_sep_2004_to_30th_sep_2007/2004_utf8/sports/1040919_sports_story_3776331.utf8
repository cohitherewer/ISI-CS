The Telegraph - Calcutta

 You can?t always be the champion bowler, can?t always be a winner: Harbhajan

 - ?I?m not getting enough time to work on the ?magic? ball at nets... It?s going to be a slower one? 

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI 

 Harbhajan feels cricket won?t be fun if wickets everywhere are the same 

Birmingham: Ten months ago, Harbhajan ?Bhajji? Singh underwent surgery just off his spinning fingers. Today, the 24-year-old is well into his comeback and, in captain Sourav Ganguly?s opinion, probably bowling at his best. Harbhajan, who has 151 wickets (including a hattrick) in Tests and 116 in ODIs, spoke to The Telegraph for over 45 minutes on Friday evening. 

 The following are excerpts 

 Q You?re in your 

 third month after making a post-surgery return. Are you 

 happy with your bowling? 

 A Quite happy... I?ve got wickets and, more important, 

 have been economical... Mera comeback accha raha hai. 

 Did the surgery (in Melbourne) 

 sow some doubts? 

 For a while, I was scared... Wasn?t sure of making 

 a return.... Wasn?t sure of being the same bowler... Of 

 getting the turn and bounce and being able to bowl with 

 variety... I suppose every bowler who undergoes surgery 

 gets scared. 

 How confident did you feel 

 the first time you gripped the ball? 

 Almost thought I would again end up with torn ligaments... 

 I was that scared to even grip the ball at home (Jalandhar)... 

 It took quite some time to regain confidence. (After 

 a pause) What worried me more was the warning from doctors 

 ? that the tissues would ?break? once I resumed bowling. 

 Did you seek professional 

 help? 

 No. However, family and friends gave lots of support 

 and helped me get back the confidence... They kept saying 

 I would again be a matchwinner... Of course, in the lead-up 

 to my comeback, I went through a lot of pain... (Adds 

 laughing) Actually, the team was doing so well, when 

 I wasn?t available, that I wondered whether I would really 

 be needed! Shayad zaroorat nahin ho... 

 Were you in regular touch 

 with any teammate? 

 With Ashish (Nehra) and Zaheer (Khan). Others too... 

 They would say I shouldn?t look to make a premature return... 

 That I must be patient during the rehab. 

 Are you continuing with 

 the rehab exercises? 

 Very much so. Indeed, I need to ice the fingers fairly 

 regularly as well. 

 Thus far, your comeback 

 has been in ODIs. Well, how much of a role can spinners 

 have in limited overs cricket? 

 A significant one, provided a spinner bowls to his 

 field... He won?t then be hit... Khair, maar jub parti 

 hai, fast bowler bhi spinner dikhne lagta hai. 

 Spinners are being filmed 

 by the ICC in the Champions Trophy. Is that putting you 

 all under pressure? 

 I don?t think so... It?s okay if the chucking issue 

 is going to be sorted out. My opinion, though, is that even 

 the quicks should be scrutinised. Is it that only spinners 

 chuck? 

 What are your views on 

 Muttiah Muralidharan? 

 There are many who look up to Murali and I?m one of 

 them... Frankly, I don?t have to talk about him as his achievements 

 do all the speaking... What amazes me is that people have 

 raised such a hue and cry over his action years and years 

 after his debut (1992-93)... If corrective measures were 

 to be taken, it ought to have been done in Murali?s first 

 year of international cricket... If his action has always 

 been suspect, why wasn?t he hauled up in his very first 

 over? How do you place restrictions on somebody who, today, 

 is the most successful bowler (532 Test wickets)? Yeh 

 to galat baat hai... I doubt if anybody appreciates 

 the pressure he must be under... 

 Banning Murali?s doosra 

 then is uncalled for... 

 Absolutely... Not after he has picked up over 500 

 Test wickets. 

 Have you, at any time, 

 doubted his action? 

 Haven?t... But, clearly, Murali is of a different 

 type... He doesn?t get that much bounce, but the turn is 

 phenomenal... I see him getting 700-800 Test wickets. 

 Where do you see yourself 

 finishing? 

 (Laughs) With many more than I have at the 

 present... 

 And, how has your career 

 gone? 

 I?ve had ups and downs, but have always been a trier... 

 I mean, I got 32 wickets in three Tests against Australia 

 (2000-01), but struggled after just a few months... However, 

 it?s not that I didn?t try hard enough. 

 Does being tough in the 

 mind come easy? 

 Easy or not, one has to be tough... You can?t always 

 be the champion bowler, can?t always be a winner... If that 

 begins to happen, you will cease being a human being... 

 What about the ?magic? 

 ball you?ve been threatening to unleash? 

 Aaye ga... I?m not getting enough time to work 

 on it at nets... It?s going to be a slower one. 

 Have you begun to think 

 of the Test series versus Australia? 

 To an extent, yes... 

 Surely, you will be under 

 a lot of pressure... 

 Everybody is already expecting me to again take 32 

 wickets.... Pressure to bahut ho ga... I may take 

 more than 32... Equally, I could take less than five... 

 Among the Australians, 

 who is the biggest threat? 

 The whole team is good... They play tough cricket 

 and their body-language is exceptional... Matthew Hayden, 

 Ricky Ponting, Adam Gilchrist... They have outstanding batsmen... 

 (Again, after a pause) Jeetne ke liye bahut mehnat 

 chahiye. 

 Any thoughts on the type 

 of wickets? 

 I?ve hardly ever bowled on a surface (at home) where 

 the ball has turned square from the first day... I believe 

 the wickets must suit the team?s strength. After all, Australia 

 and England won?t prepare a turner... It?s a challenge playing 

 on different surfaces and there?s a bit of charm involved 

 too... Cricket won?t be fun if wickets everywhere are the 

 same. 

 Is there any awkwardness 

 when you get preferred to the more experienced Anil Kumble 

 for the solitary specialist spinner?s slot? 

 It?s good to have healthy competition... It?s nice 

 if I?ve got to ?fight? it out with somebody of Kumble?s 

 stature... Whatever, we have a fine understanding and wish 

 each other well. 

 You?ve been around for 

 six years... What has cricket taught you most? 

 That no individual is bigger than the game. If somebody 

 actually thinks otherwise, he is going to be quickly brought 

 down to earth. 

 What should the young off-spinners? 

 approach be? 

 They must be courageous... Ought not to be scared 

 of being hit... Agar maar nahin khao ge, to sikho ge 

 kaise? Being hit is part of any bowler?s education. 

 The final question: You?re probably indebted 

 to Sourav for having brought you back in the last Australia 

 series at home...

 (Emotionally) It?s a debt 

 for life... If ever Sourav wants anything done, I?ll be 

 there... He treats me like a younger brother... Can I ever 

 forget this? He has a huge role in my being successful... 

 Unka bahut bada haath hai.

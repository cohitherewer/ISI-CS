Calcutta: Gautam Gambhir feels the presence of two other openers ? Akash Chopra and Shikhar Dhawan ? besides himself, in the Delhi side has only helped in raising the performance of the team. 

Gambhir had partnered Chopra in the first innings, but in the second the former came in at No. 3. 

?The gameplan was to change the opening combination and not to lose wickets at the outset. Playing for Delhi always charges you up. That is enough motivation. At the end of the day, it is the result that matters,? Gambhir said on Saturday. 

?It was always important to stay positive. I was seeing the ball well and played my shots. I played my natural game and there was nothing extravagant about my style,? Gambhir said. 

The opener felt that his exposure with Team India has helped him mature. ?My confidence has increased. There?s been no change as far as style or approach goes.? 

He is looking forward to the tie versus Mumbai. ?That should be interesting and we?re all geared up. This victory will put us in good stead.?

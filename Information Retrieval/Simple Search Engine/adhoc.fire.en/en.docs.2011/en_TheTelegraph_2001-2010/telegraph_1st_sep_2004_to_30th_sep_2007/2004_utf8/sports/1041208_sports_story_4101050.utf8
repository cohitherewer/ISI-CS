The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Bagan coach flays Bhaichung

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Mohun Bagan coach Subrata Bhattacharya feels that blaming goalkeeper Subrata Pal for the death of Brazilian Cristiano Junior is sending a ?wrong message? to the supporters. He fears that it could lead to an enmity among the players. 

Reacting to Bhaichung Bhutia?s call for suspending Pal, Bhattacharya told reporters at the club tent on Tuesday that such comments could destroy one?s career and add fuel to an ?already vicious atmosphere.? 

?What kind of a role model is Bhaichung? When he supported Sasthi (Duley) and Dipankar (Roy), we all stood by him because he was fighting for the footballers? cause. How can he blame a footballer now? 

?His comments are sending wrong message to the supporters. Is he going to take the responsibility if another August 16 resurfaces because of such comments? 

Two more Mohun Bagan-East Bengal matches are still to be played this season (in the upcoming National Football League). I can?t help but fearing the worst,? Bhattacharya remarked. 

?Subrata?s charge towards Junior was spontaneous, not intentional. As a player, Bhaichung should have understood it,? opined the Mohun Bagan coach.

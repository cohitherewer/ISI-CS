 McMillan dropped 

Auckland: Batsman Craig McMillan has been omitted from the New Zealand Test squad for their tour of Bangladesh next month. 

McMillan, who has played 52 Tests at an average of just over 40, is likely to join the squad for the three-match one-day series, coach John Bracewell said on Monday. 

Hamish Marshall, who has played just one Test against South Africa in 2000, takes McMillan?s place.

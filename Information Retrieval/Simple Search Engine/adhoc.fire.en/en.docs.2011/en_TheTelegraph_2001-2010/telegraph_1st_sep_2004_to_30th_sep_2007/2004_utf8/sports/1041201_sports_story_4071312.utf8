Adelaide: Australia wrapped up a 2-0 win in the series after beating New Zealand by 213 runs on the fifth day of the second and final Test at the Adelaide Oval on Tuesday. 

The Black Caps, chasing a huge target of 464, were bowled out for 250 when Shane Warne (two for 79) had last man Chris Martin caught by Ricky Ponting for two in the second over after lunch. 

Australia opener Justin Langer was made Man-of-the-Match for his knocks of 215 and 46. Paceman Glenn McGrath, who took six wickets in Adelaide and three in the first Test in Brisbane, was selected as Man-of-the-Series. 

Captain Ponting said his side had played brilliant cricket in the series. The home team won the first match in Brisbane by an innings and 156 runs. 

?We planned this game really well and we?ve come away with another great win,? Ponting said. 

Ponting?s counterpart Stephen Fleming said his team had performed below expectations and deserved criticism, even though they were up against the world?s top-ranked side. ?It was a comprehensive display from Australia, one of the better displays throughout a series that I?ve seen,? Fleming said. ?Some of their bowling during the Test matches was superb. It was like having three Richard Hadlees and the greatest leg-spinner of all (Warne). 

?We lacked a bit of sting with our bowling but we also know how good their batting unit is. 

?We deserve the criticism. At times there have been sessions that have been exasperating for us all. 

Brett Lee in ODIs 

World champions Australia will unleash strike bowler Brett Lee for this week?s one-day series against New Zealand, coach John Buchanan said on Tuesday. 

?We very, very much expect him to be playing two if not all three of the one-day matches to be a good lead-in to the Pakistan series,? Buchanan told Australian Broadcasting Corp. Radio. 

Lee has been 12th man for both matches of the two-test series against New Zealand, which Australia won 2-0 in Adelaide on Tuesday. 

?We?ll rest a couple of them (fast bowlers) at certain times,? Australia captain Ricky Ponting said. 

Meanwhile, batsman Mark Richardson cheered up New Zealand?s suffering fans by winning a 110m sprint race against Australia allrounder Darren Lehmann at the Adelaide Oval on Tuesday. 

?We needed a win,? Richardson said after his five-metre victory over a puffing Lehmann, 34.

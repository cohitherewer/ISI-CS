 Overrule costs chair umpire dear

 Mariana Alves won?t officiate any more at the Open this year following a mistake in the Serena Williams vs Jennifer Capriati match 

New York: Mariana Alves, the umpire at the centre of the controversial US Open quarter final between Jennifer Capriati and Serena Williams on Tuesday, will not officiate any more matches in this year?s final Grand Slam event. 

At deuce in the opening game of the third set, Portuguese Alves overruled a backhand from Williams, calling it out after it had clearly landed inside the line and been deemed good by the line judge. 

?Regrettably, the replay on television showed that an incorrect overrule was made,? tournament referee Brian Earley said in a statement. ?A mistake was made and I have discussed the call with Ms Alves. Ms Alves is not scheduled to officiate another match during the 2004 U.S. Open.? 

Though Alves? overrule was inaudible on television, and Williams said she thought the call was a score mistake, replays proved the ball was clearly in. 

Capriati went on to win the match 2-6, 6-4, 6-4, leaving fellow-American Williams claiming she had been ?robbed?. 

At Wimbledon earlier this year, British umpire Ted Watts was stood down after a bizarre incident in which he incorrectly gave Karolina Sprem a point she should not have been awarded, against Serena?s sister, Venus. (Reuters)

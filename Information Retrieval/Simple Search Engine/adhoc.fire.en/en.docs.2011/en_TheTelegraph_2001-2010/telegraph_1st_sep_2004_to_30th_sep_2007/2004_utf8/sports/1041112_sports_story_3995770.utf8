 Harika on course for title

Heraklion (Greece): Top seed woman Grandmaster Dronavalli Harika was held to a draw by Anna Muzychuk of Slovenia in the 8th round of the under-14 girls in the World Youth Chess championships on Thursday. 

Following this draw, Harika was joined by Elena Tairova of Russia at the top on seven points from eight games. With just three rounds remaining, it has now almost become a race between the two for the world title. 

But Harika has a better chance, thanks to her excellent tie-break score and given the opposition she has played. 

Mary Ann Gomes scored a fine victory over Choisy Mathilde of France in the under-16 girls. With this win, Gomes has moved up to joint fourth. Purtseladze Maka of Georgia shot into sole lead as her compatriot Bela Khote Nashvili suffered a shock defeat at the hands of Joanna Majdan of Poland. 

In the under-12 boys, Parimarjan Negi recovered from his seventh round loss to Zhao Nan of China and drew against another Chinese Ding Liren to move to 6.5 points. 

Zhao, who started as an unrated 120th seed, has been brilliant on the board, stretching his lead to a full point over his nearest rivals after scoring a fine win over Julian Jorcjik of Germany in 8th round.

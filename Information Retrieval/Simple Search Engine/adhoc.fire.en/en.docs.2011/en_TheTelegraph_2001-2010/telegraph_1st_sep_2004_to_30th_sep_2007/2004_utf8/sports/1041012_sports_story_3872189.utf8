The Telegraph - Calcutta

 India fill in as Aussies pull out

New Delhi: India are expecting a formal invitation 

from the International Hockey Federation (FIH) to take part in the Champions Trophy 

after Australia pulled out of the event on Monday citing security reasons. 

[Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) secretary K. Jyothikumaran 

told The Telegraph that India are now ?positively in the championship, 

and I will get this confirmation when I return to New Delhi from Hyderabad.?] 

India had been asked by the FIH to be ready for the event in case any team pulls out at the last minute and Australia?s withdrawal has paved the way for the Asian team to take part in the six-nation championship to be held in Lahore in December. 

?It?s a good news for us. We got a communication from FIH only a couple of days back to get ready for the event in case any team pulls out. Now we hope to get a formal invitation from them in next one or two days,? Jyothikumaran said. 

Australia?s pull-out came a day after a suicide bombing in a mosque in Lahore killed four people. 

Jyothikumaran said India do not have any such security fears as the team played four Test matches in Pakistan just a few days back. 

He also said that the trip would provide a good exposure to the young players and help India prepare a team for the future. 

?It?s a top competition with the best teams participating. It would be a very good experience for the young players in the side,? he said.The other four teams besides hosts Pakistan ? Germany, Holland, Spain and New Zealand ? have already confirmed their attendance for the elite six-nation annual event scheduled to be held from December 4-12. 

Meanwhile, in New Delhi the 18-member Pakistan team was felicitated by Aziz Ahmed, the high commissioner of Pakistan to India on Monday. 

Ahmed hosted a lunch for the team, which arrived here after playing the last tie of the friendship series in Hyderabad on Sunday. Pakistan won the eight match Test series 4-2. (PTI)

 Ricky Ponting hopes to avoid operation 

 - Australian skipper sees injury as a ?real big blow? 

Sydney: Australian captain Ricky Ponting said he wanted to avoid an operation on his broken left thumb so he could play in the much-anticipated Test series in India next month. 

Ponting arrived here on Friday from London for treatment on a broken left thumb suffered while fielding in Australia?s six-wicket loss to England in the Champions Trophy semi-final at Edgbaston on Tuesday. 

He will miss at least the first Test, which starts in Bangalore on October 6, but said he had no guarantee of being right to play the second Test in Chennai, which follows only four days after the first Test. 

Ponting said he was hopeful of avoiding an operation on the thumb, but said he would not be taking any chances on re-injuring the bone. 

?I?ll take it pretty cautiously for the first two weeks and make sure I give myself the best chance of being over there as early as I can,? Ponting said. 

?It?s just going to depend on, first of all, if I have to have an operation on it, and if I don?t, just how it feels for me day-to-day. 

?Hopefully, I don?t have to have an operation.? 

Ponting said the injury setback was a major blow with such a significant series in prospect in India, where Australia have not won a series in five tours since Bill Lawry?s team?s 3-1 victory there in 1969-70. 

?We?ve been looking forward to the Indian tour for a long time, and for me personally, being captain of the side, also not having made many runs on the last tour, I was pretty keen to get there and play well,? Ponting said. 

?Knowing what the build-up will be like in India, it?ll be huge over there... Everything was pointing to the direction of it being a huge series,? Ponting said. 

?It?s just a real big blow for me and a big blow for the team. It?s going to be a frustrating couple of weeks.? 

Ponting had a poor series in the last series in India in 2001 and he tallied just 17 runs in five innings at an average of 3.4, including three ducks. He lost his wicket to spinner Harbhajan Singh in every dismissal. 

Since that momentous tour, Ponting has blossomed into one of the world?s premier batsmen, scoring over 3500 runs at a touch over 66 in 37 Tests. 

Ponting said he was still hopeful of playing in the second Test against in Chennai. 

 ?It couldn?t have come at a much worse time. It capped off a pretty ordinary day for us all round the other day.? 

Ponting said he would be visiting a hand specialist to learn more about the extent of the injury. 

?It looks like I?m not going to be there for the first Test, hopefully I can make it there for the second Test and won?t miss too much of the action,? he said. 

Uncapped batsman Brad Hodge has been named Ponting?s replacement in the 16-man squad. 

Hodge came calling 

Interestingly, Hodge made sure selectors knew of his availability when he heard that Australian cricket captain Ricky Ponting would miss the first Test against India next month with injury. 

Hodge contacted Michael Brown, CA operations manager, and said on Friday: ?I did let them know I was available because the only person that knew where I was, was the travel agent. 

?So I rang up Michael Brown and said ?just in case you need me, this is where I am?. 

?Luckily he rang back about three-and-a-half hours later and said ?I?ve got you. Can you come back?? it was good fun, a nice story.? (AFP)

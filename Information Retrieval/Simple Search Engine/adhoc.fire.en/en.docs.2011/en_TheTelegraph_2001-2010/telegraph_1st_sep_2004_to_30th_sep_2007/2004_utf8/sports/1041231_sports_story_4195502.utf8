 PCB chief backs coach and captain

Islamabad: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Shaharyan Khan on Thursday came out in support of captain Inzamam-ul Haq and coach Bob Woolmer, saying there was ?no need to press the panic button? although the team?s performance on its ongoing tour of Australia was ?disappointing?. 

The PCB chief however warned the beleaguered team that he might be hard-pressed to take drastic measures if it failed to pick up its performance. 

Pakistan have lost the three-Test series 2-0. They are scheduled to play the last Test at Sydney from January 2-6 followed by a one-day tri-series with the West Indies as the third team. 

Shaharyar Khan, known to be a supporter of both Inzamam and Woolmer, said the team?s showing and that of the management would be reviewed after the Australian tour.

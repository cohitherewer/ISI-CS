 New-look France begin campaign against Israel

Clairefontaine (France): France start their World Cup qualifying campaign against Israel in Paris on Saturday badly needing victory to put their ignominious Euro 2004 exit behind them. Les Bleus have had little time to build a new squad since inspirational Zinedine Zidane and influential defenders Lilian Thuran, Bixente Lizarazu and captain Marcel Desailly quit the team. 

After their defeat by Greece in the Euro 2004 quarter finals, the French drew 1-1 with Bosnia following a lacklustre performance last month. 

A new generation is coming and a new squad is to build up, striker Thierry Henry said. We need a string of victories because its easier to work when you win. I dont know what the story was back in 1996 because I wasnt there but it took them some time to set up a competitive side. 

When Aime Jacquet took over from the sacked Gerard Houllier after France failed to qualify for the 1994 World Cup, he set off on a French record run of 30 matches without defeat. 

This helped the squad find the right balance and confidence they needed to prepare for the victorious 1998 World Cup campaign. 

We are now the old ones, said Henry. We have to help the youngsters to find their place into the squad the way others did it for us in other times. Its our duty. 

Like Jacquet, new French coach Raymond Domenech is a strong character, a man players listen to when he speaks and obey when he gives orders. Since replacing Jacques Santini, Domenech has implemented a new discipline and imposed new rules. 

No mobile phones calls are allowed during massage sessions anymore and all the players have to be on time for breakfast and training sessions. 

Domenech has also changed the teams strategy, turning to a 3-5-2 formation after the old-fashioned 4-4-2 cherished by Santini proved unsuccessful during the European Championship. The three-defender system is more demanding, especially for the midfielders who have to come back swiftly to cover their defence when opponents carry the ball. 

Domenech, however, said he hoped such a formation would create a greater solidarity among the players. Whatever option he chooses on Saturday, the France coach remains wary of Israel, a side France have had problems with in the past. They tamed them 2-1 in a tough match in Palermo during the Euro 2004 qualifiers but lost 2-3 in Paris in 1993. With them (Israel), you never know what to expect, Domenech said. 

England coach Sven-Goran Eriksson is putting his faith in an England side peppered with reserves when their 2006 World Cup qualifying campaign opens in Austria on Saturday. 

The game at the Ernst Happel Stadium is the start of a double-header which takes England to Chorzow, Poland next Wednesday as they bid to rack up two quick wins in Group Six. 

Top of the list of absentees is teenage striker Wayne Rooney, who has just completed a 27 million move from Everton to Manchester United despite still being sidelined after breaking a bone in his foot at Euro 2004. 

The 18-year-olds four goals propelled England to the quarter finals, while his injury during their defeat by Portugal was probably the biggest reason for their exit. 

Rooneys place alongside Michael Owen up front should go to Alan Smith, who is blossoming in his debut season at Manchester United, scoring five goals in his first seven games. 

Eriksson also has problems in midfield, where the retirement of Smiths club teammate Paul Scholes from international football has deprived Eriksson of his most inspired playmaker. 

Nicky Butt, expected to return to the base of a midfield diamond after missing out at Euro 2004, is unavailable for Saturday, while Steven Gerrard pulled up in Thursdays training session with a groin problem. 

If he shrugs off the setback, Gerrard will partner Frank Lampard in central midfield, with skipper David Beckham on the right and a vacant slot on the left that could well go to Joe Cole ahead of Wayne Bridge or Kieron Dyer. 

A scare over Gerrard was the last thing Eriksson needed before flying to Austria as he is already missing three central defenders Sol Campbell, Jonathan Woodgate and Rio Ferdinand through either injury or suspension. 

John Terry and youngster Ledley King, who impressed in Englands 1-2 defeat by France at Euro 2004, should cope with the frontal assault, flanked by Ashley Cole and Gary Neville. 

Judging by Austrias 1-3 defeat to a modest Germany side in Vienna last month, that assault should not give Terry and King nightmares. 

Ranked 90th in the world when fully fit, Austria will be missing two first-choice midfielders in Martin Amerhauser, who scored against Germany, and Markus Schopp.

Melbourne: Pakistan paceman Shoaib Akhtar kept Australia on the back foot with a fiery performance as the home side battled to reach 203 for five by the close of the second day of the second Test on Monday. 

Shoaib took three for 56 and leg spinner Danish Kaneria two for 70 as Pakistan, who suffered a crushing 491-run loss in the first Test, maintained control after dominating Sunday?s opening day of play. 

Damien Martyn was unbeaten on 67 and held the key to Australia?s fortunes with wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist, who was 26 not out. 

Pakistan, who had started the day on 318 for six, were dismissed for 341 in their first innings on the stroke of lunch. 

However Shoaib then removed Australia opener Matthew Hayden, for nine, and captain Ricky Ponting, for seven, to put the hosts under early pressure at 32 for two in the ninth over. 

Opener Justin Langer, who scored 50, did well to survive as Shoaib?s aggression peaked in his eighth over shortly before tea. Langer ducked one short ball before being struck on the hand by the next delivery. 

The pair exchanged words several times during the over as the umpires and Pakistan captain Yusuf Youhana tried to calm the situation after Shoaib had spat in Langer?s general direction. 

Langer was dismissed shortly after tea, caught by Imran Farhat at backward square leg via an attempted sweep shot off Kaneria. 

Shoaib claimed his third wicket when he had Darren Lehmann caught at short leg for 11, and then took a simple catch at long-off as Kaneria removed Michael Clarke for 20, Australia slipping to 171 for five. 

Australia had been quick to pounce in the morning session when Kamran Akmal was caught behind for 24 off the bowling of Glenn McGrath in the third over. 

Pakistan then lost their last three wickets without further addition in 14 balls as a total of 23 runs were added in the 17.3 overs before lunch. 

Leg spinner Shane Warne (three for 103) recovered from his first-day mauling at the hands of Pakistan?s acting captain Youhana (111) to claim the wickets of Mohammed Sami (12) and Shoaib (0). 

Kaneria was run out for a duck, leaving Abdul Razzaq unbeaten on four from 76 balls. 

Langer said the sixth-wicket stand of 32 between Martyn and Gilchrist had been pivotal for the home side. 

?Marto is in exceptional form and we all know how Gilly can play. While those two are at the crease, anything can happen,? he said.

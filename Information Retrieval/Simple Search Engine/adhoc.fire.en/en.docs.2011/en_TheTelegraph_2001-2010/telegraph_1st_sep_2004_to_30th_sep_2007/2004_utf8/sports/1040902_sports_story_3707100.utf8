Heavy loss is not a bad thing: Smith

- South African skipper hints at the possible changes in team

 Graeme Smith feels there is need for a fresh 

outlook 

Durban: South African skipper captain Graeme 

Smith believes the heavy loss against Sri Lanka in the recent Test and one-day 

series may actually help re-energise the national team.

Maybe heavy loss is not a bad thing. We need a fresh 

outlook somewhere down the line, maybe after the ICC Champions Trophy, Smith 

said.

As a proud sportsman, a proud sporting team and nation, 

its very disappointing to perform the way we did. (But) maybe its good to hit 

rock bottom, he was quoted as saying by a local newspaper upon arrival from Sri 

Lanka, where the South African team lost the two Test series 0-1 and suffered 

a 0-5 whitewash in the subsequent one-day series.

The team will spend a few days at home before leaving 

for England to participate in the Champions Trophy from September 10.

Hinting at a few changes in the national team, Smith 

said, maybe we had become too predictable in the last four or five years. Maybe 

we need to throw the net wider. Sri Lanka has done that very successfully and 

players have come through and done the business. Its an opportunity for the younger 

guys. Maybe that is the way to go now.

Coach Eric Simons also indicated that the management 

would look at new faces as it assesses the poor performance of the team, which 

had increased the pressure all-round.

Meanwhile, South Africas chairman of the selection 

committee Omar Henry said there might be changes in the side.

I dont want to comment directly at this stage, 

he said.

I wasnt there and I want to receive the feedback 

from Simons and Smith. I hope we can do this before the team leaves for the ICC 

Champions Trophy on Sunday, while everything is still fresh everybodys minds.

What is obvious is that we have not changed the mindset 

since we first started going to the Asian sub-continent more than ten years ago. 

You have to play on the sub-continent the way the home teams play. It is the only 

way to go, said Henry.

After the ICC tournament, the South Africans will 

return to South Asia for a two-Test series against India before playing England 

in a full Test and one-day series at home in December/January. (PTI)

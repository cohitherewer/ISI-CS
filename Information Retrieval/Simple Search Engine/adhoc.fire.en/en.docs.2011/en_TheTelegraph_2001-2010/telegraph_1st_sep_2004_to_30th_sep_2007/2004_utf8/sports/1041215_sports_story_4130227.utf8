 Pathan hungry for more

Dhaka: It has been one exhilarating ride for Irfan Pathan on the fast lane of international cricket. But one year after his debut, the 21-year-old pace sensation is hungry for more success. 

?It has been a good year, I am quite happy with my performance. But I want to look at what is in front, look forward. I want to keep doing the good work that I have done so far. I don?t want to sleep on my success,? Pathan said on Tuesday. 

Pathan?s success is all the more creditable because of his style of bowling. While the likes of Jawagal Srinath and Zaheer Khan have reinforced the argument that a bowler needs to hit the deck hard to succeed on Indian pitches, Pathan has shown that skilful use of seam could also bear fruit on the dusty tracks of the subcontinent. 

?Zaheer is close to taking 100 wickets, Srinath and Akram have all done well. My strength is swing, the pace will improve,? Pathan said. (PTI)

 Wenger?s no to offers

ANDREW WARSHAW

 Wenger

Arsene Wenger rejected approaches to become manager of both the French and German national teams in order to remain with Arsenal. 

Wenger, who has just signed a three-year extension to his Arsenal contract, spoke to officials from both countries during Euro 2004 but was not given sufficient incentive to end his eight-year reign at Highbury. 

Last week, Arsenal vice-chairman David Dein admitted that Wenger had had chances to leave the club during the summer but refused to name the suitors. 

But it is understood that representatives of France and Germany, both of whom under-performed at Euro 2004, sounded him out. France opted instead for Jacques Santini?s unheralded assistant Raymond Domenech ? and are already sweating on the choice as France only have five points from a possible nine in their World Cup qualifying group ? while 2006 World Cup hosts Germany replaced the lacklustre Rudi Voeller with the high-profile Jurgen Klinsmann. The fact that two of Europe?s most successful nations wanted Wenger, brought up in France close to the German border, speaks volumes of the esteem in which he is held. 

It also sends a strong message to fans about his ambitions to keep Arsenal, who have won three championships and three FA Cups under him, ahead of their rivals in the build-up to the opening of their new 60,000-strong stadium in 2006. 

Meanwhile, Arsenal continued to play down reports of a rift between Wenger and Alex Ferguson in the light of Manchester United ending the Gunners? 49-match unbeaten run last Sunday. 

United are reported to have compiled a dossier of what happened in the tunnel afterwards, when Ferguson is reported to have been struck by food thrown by Arsenal players.

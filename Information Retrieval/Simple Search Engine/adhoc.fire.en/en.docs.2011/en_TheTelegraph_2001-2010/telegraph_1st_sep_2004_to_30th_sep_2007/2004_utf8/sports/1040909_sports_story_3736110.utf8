 Strasbourg: French runner Fouad Chouki was detained by police for allegedly raping a 15-year-old girl in the eastern French city of Strasbourg, police said on Wednesday.

 Chouki, who was barred from this summer?s Olympic Games after testing positive for a banned performance-enhancing drug, was under investigation ? a step short of formal charges ? for raping a minor, police in Strasbourg said.

 The 26-year-old middle-distance runner was questioned by police on Monday and denied any wrongdoing. The teenager filed a complaint against him on Sunday, a day after the alleged crime took place, police said.

 London: Australian Michael Rogers has been named world time-trial champion in place of David Millar after the Briton?s disqualification for a positive dope test.

 The UCI, world cycling?s ruling body, said Millar had decided not to contest his disqualification from the 2003 world championships after he later admitted taking doping products at the time of his victory at the event in Canada.

 The silver medal goes now to Uwe Peschel and the bronze to another German, Michael Rich.

 Zurich: Swiss cyclist Oscar Camenzind, who tested positive for the banned drug EPO before the Athens Games, has been formally banned from the sport for two years, the Swiss Olympic Association said on Wednesday. The scandal around the 1998 world road race champion came to a head just days before the start of last month?s Olympic Games, prompting the Swiss cyclist to retire from the sport before cycling authorities could suspend him from competition.

 The ex-Phonak team member had tested positive for EPO. Under Swiss rules, anyone who tests positive is banned with immediate effect even before the result of a second sample. The Swiss Olympic Association said Camenzind was suspended as of August 19 and would be fined 10,000 Swiss francs ($7,868). He was ordered to pay costs. 

 London: Former England coach Clive Woodward will take the British and Irish Lions to New Zealand next year, the combined team?s manager said on Tuesday. Woodward, who guided England to World Cup success last year, quit his job with the Rugby Football Union (RFU) last week.

 A Lions committee meeting was held in Dublin on Tuesday to discuss the ramifications of Woodward?s sudden decision to leave the England job but he was given full backing by the committee. 

 Woodward had said earlier that he would not take up any other paid position before his commitments with the Lions ended.

 New Delhi: India suffered a major set back as they lost their second quarter final league tie to hosts Qatar in the 12th Asian junior men?s volleyball championship in Doha.

 According to information received here, the Indians went down 18-25, 25-23, 26-28, 18-25 on Tuesday night.

 India now face a must-win situation against Japan in their last league encounter.

 Bucharest: Andrei Pavel, top seed for the next week?s Romanian Open, is unlikely to play in the tournament because of a back injury, a Romanian tennis official said on Wednesday.

 Earlier this week, Pavel was forced to pull out of his US Open fourth round match against Switzerland?s Roger Federer with a herniated disc in his lower back.

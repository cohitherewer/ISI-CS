 Bengal on the backfoot

 J.P. Yadav top scored for Railways with 93 

New Delhi: Railways? bowlers wrecked the Bengal top order to force the visitors on the backfoot on the second day of their Ranji Trophy Elite Group A cricket match here Wednesday. 

After posting 348 in their first innings, Railways exploited the seamer-friendly conditions well to restrict Bengal to 153 for four at stumps at the Karnail Singh Stadium. 

J.P. Yadav, who top scored for Railways with 93, grabbed two wickets with his medium pace. 

Captain Rohan Gavaskar (24) and Laxmi Ratan Shukla (22) shared in an unbeaten 40-run stand to pull out Bengal, after they had slumped to 113 for four. The visitors, however, are still 195 runs behind with six wickets remaining. 

?We are aiming for a first innings lead. If we manage that it will be a good thing,? Bengal coach Karsan Ghavri said. 

?In the morning the pitch was a bit damp, but it improved as the day progressed. Towards the end, however, the ball was keeping low,? Ghavri added. ?We are pinning our hopes on Gavaskar and Shukla besides the lower order batsmen, most of whom can bat.? 

Earlier, resuming at 305 for nine, Railways went on to score 348 as Yadav, batting overnight on 69, hit some attractive shots all around the park before holing out to Sanjib Sanyal at deep point off Ranadeb Singh, who finished with five for 67. 

The 30-year-old all-rounder from Madhya Pradesh, who faced 143 balls for his knock that included 10 fours and a six, added 43 valuable runs for the last wicket with Santosh Saxena, much to Bengal?s dismay. 

Yadav then returned to strike in the sixth over of the innings as he got rid of opener Arindam Das (8), who was caught by Harvinder Singh with the visitors? score reading 13. 

Gandhi (18) was caught behind by wicketkeeper Sudhir Wankhede. Haldipur (30) and Deep Dasgupta (32) added 44 runs for the third wicket before being dismissed by Yadav and Saxena, respectively. (PTI)

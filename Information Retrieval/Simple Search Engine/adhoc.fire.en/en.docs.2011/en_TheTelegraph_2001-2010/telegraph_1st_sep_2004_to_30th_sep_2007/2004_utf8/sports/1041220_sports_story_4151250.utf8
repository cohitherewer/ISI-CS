 Berlioz wins thrilling Guineas 

 HONKY DORY

 Mallesh

 Brilliantly ridden by Mallesh Narredu, the S. Padmanabhan-trained ward Berlioz lifted the Indian 2,000 Guineas at the Mumbai races held on Sunday.

 Settled in sixth till the halfway stage, the 7-1 chance was pushed into a three-length lead soon after the field turned for home. The Sri Pekan-Innocent Pleasures son was, however, strongly challenged in the last 150m of the race by the S. Ganapathy-trainee Southern Regent but Berlioz held on to win by half-a-length.

 IN THE CITY

 Douglas da Silva believes there has been a witch-hunt of sorts from the club authorities as far as he was concerned. He says in his reply to the club?s show-cause notice (a reply that he will send on Thursday) that he was unwell and that he had informed club doctor Shanti Ranjan Das Gupta and coach Subhas Bhowmick about that. ?I don?t understand why this, despite my making all clear to the authorities,? he said Wednesday. The club has hauled up the Brazilian on grounds of indiscipline, and for not joining practice.

 Meanwhile, Ever-Ready recruit Nigerian Ernest Jeremiah practised with the East Bengal players Wednesday. He is yet to get his release order.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 ?We are determined to win?

 - The tour of India is an opportunity for us to come back as heroes, says Graeme Smith 

 Captain Graeme Smith says he believes in his teammates 

Durban: South African captain Graeme Smith has said that despite being written off as ?no-hopers?, his team is determined to come back as heroes by winning the two-Test cricket series in India beginning next week. 

?We are going to India to win and we are determined to achieve just that,? Smith said after a five-day training camp at the high performance centre in Johannesburg. The team left for the sub-continent on Thursday. 

Smith said he was confident of doing well because the spirits were high among the players. ?I know many people are writing us off as no-hopers but I know that when I go onto the field I believe in every member of the team ? and I believe them because they made me believe,? the 23-year-old Smith, South Africa?s youngest captain, said. 

He also rejected reports that South Africans would be happy to come away with a draw. 

?I play cricket to win, whether it is at club level, provincial level or national level. We are going there to try to win, and we believe we can win,? he was quoted as saying by the local media Thursday. 

Smith said the team had talked about the 1952 tour to Australia, where the young team, led by Jack Cheetham, had been written off, but came back heroes after drawing the series against a strong Australian side. 

?We see this as an opportunity to come back as heroes.? 

National coach Ray Jennings also said there was excitement in the team and total commitment from the players including former captain Shaun Pollock and stylish all-rounder Jacques Kallis. 

?We?ve done a lot of work on our fielding, and I think you will see something special. There is total commitment from all 14 members of the squad,? Jennings said. 

The team meanwhile, is seeking inspiration from an unusual motto, ?love and care? that the new coach has asked his boys to adhere to during the tour. ?It?s funny what you can do when there?s love and care around,? Jennings remarked. 

The coach said he had included Pollock and Kallis in his management team. Pollock will help in the bowling department while Kallis will help the batsmen. ?These players have been very encouraging. They know the conditions in India and I am sure with their help we are going to make our mark,? he said. 

Kallis confirmed that he had regained his love for the game during the camp. ?Ray has introduced new thoughts and new energies. So I am having fun again, but don?t expect me to jump around like Jonty Rhodes,? he said. 

Pollock, who was part of the Hansie Cronje-led team which beat India 2-0 in 2000, was confident that the team had bowlers capable of taking 20 wickets in India. ?You have to do it differently in the sub-continent, and particularly in India. Sometimes it might not be pretty, but we believe we can do it,? he said. 

Both the captain and the coach rejected suggestions that the team would face a volley of questions on match-fixing. ?Most of the players weren?t there, and it?s unfair to ask them about it,? Jennings said. 

Smith said he didn?t think the team has to be protected (from such queries). ?We want to experience the toughest conditions. We want to experience everything India has to offer, and we are determined to deal with it.?

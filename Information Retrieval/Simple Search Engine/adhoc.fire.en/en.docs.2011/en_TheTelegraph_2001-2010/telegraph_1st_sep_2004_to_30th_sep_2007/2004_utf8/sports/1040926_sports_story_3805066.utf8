 We are better prepared this time: Gilchrist

 - I will carry out Ponting?s plans, says stand-in captain

Mumbai: Stand-in Australian captain Adam Gilchrist said Saturday his team is better prepared this time to meet the stiff Indian challenge and promised a lot of excitement in the four-Test series commencing in Bangalore on October 6. 

?A lot of water has flown under the bridge since that series in 2001 (which India won 2-1). We have played a lot of cricket all over the world. The visit to Sri Lanka (last year) was significant. We played the spinners very well there. We are much better prepared mentally and cricketwise,? Gilchrist said at the team hotel here. 

The majority of the squad, including Gilchrist and coach John Buchanan, arrived early morning from England after another failed bid to break the Champions Trophy jinx. Simon Katich reached on Thursday, while Justin Langer, Nathan Hauritz, Shane Warne and Cameron White landed on Friday night. 

Brad Hodge will be arriving on Sunday while southpaw Darren Lehmann, back in Australia due to a sickness in the family, will be joining the team before the tour-opener against Mumbai. 

Gilchrist said both teams would be hit hard by the likely absence of Ricky Ponting and Sachin Tendulkar for at least part of the rubber. 

?I don?t have the update on Sachin?s injury, but India would certainly miss him. We, too, would miss Ponting, but we are used to missing players due to injuries,? Gilchrist said. ?But the quality of the series would not diminish one bit in the absence of any player. This rivalry between India and Australia has developed into a great one. The series would be exciting for the fans.? 

Ponting had to return to Australia for treating his fractured left thumb after sustaining the injury during the semi-final loss to England. Tendulkar has been out of cricket since the Asia Cup in July due to an elbow injury. 

Highlighting the intense Indo-Aussie rivalry, Gilchrist said both teams had played competitive cricket on each other?s soil over the last two series. 

?India and Australia have played a lot against each other recently. We were competitive in 2001, but did not get the desired result. India were competitive last year in Australia. But this cannot be compared to the Ashes series? Each series has its own identity,? he pointed out. 

The 34-year-old conceded that he and some other players were distracted by commercial and other commitments on the last visit to India. ?There are huge opportunities in India off the field, not only for commercial purposes. There?s a lot to see in India too. I personally had too much on my plate in 2001. This time we have decided to temper our off-the-field activities,? Gilchrist said. 

He aims to be in constant touch with Ponting and carry out his plans as he had desired before having to return home. 

?I am not going to change anything, not try anything different from what Ricky had planned. I will be calling him and taking his inputs. Things will go as he had planned,? he said. 

Gilchrist also said Shane Warne, who has not tasted much success against India, would be a major factor. ?Warne is a major part of our strike force,? he remarked about the ace leg-spinner. 

Asked whether he would miss playing at Eden Gardens, venue of the fantastic Test match that turned the series on its head in 2001, Gilchrist said yes and no. 

?Personally I may not miss it (as Australia lost). But, yes, that?s a great venue and we would have liked to play there. However, the other venues for the series are also very good ones.? 

For the match against Mumbai, commencing at the Brabourne Stadium on Thursday, the Aussies are keen to field youngster Michael Clarke and Hodge, who has replaced Ponting. (PTI)

 A timely title for Woods

Miyazaki: Tiger Woods collected his first strokeplay title of a difficult year when he stormed to an eight-shot victory at the Dunlop Phoenix tournament on Sunday. 

Leading by 10 strokes overnight, the American produced a three-under-par 67 for a 16-under total of 264 to taste success for the first time in four visits to Japan. 

Woods? triumph signalled a welcome return to form after his five-year reign as world No. 1 was ended by Fiji?s Vijai Singh two months ago. 

It also halted a run of 20 consecutive strokeplay events without a win, his longest drought since turning professional in 1996. 

?It?s a great feeling,? said Woods. ?It?s a great sign. I?ve come close this year but to finally get over the top is such a great feeling.? 

Japan?s Ryoken Kawagishi finished runner-up at the $1.9-million event after a final-round 65. South Korean K.J. Choi was a further two shots back in third place on six-under 274. 

Last year?s winner Thomas Bjorn of Denmark shot a closing 64 to finish seventh on 277. 

Woods has revamped his swing this year but had still produced 10 top-10 finishes in his previous 12 tournaments before arriving in Miyazaki. 

He won the last of his eight majors at the 2002 US Open and his last strokeplay victory was in October last year. But Woods insisted he was close to returning to his best form. 

?I?m excited things have started to come together in the last three or four months,? said the 28-year-old Woods, whose last title came at the Matchplay Championship in California in February. 

?With all the changes I?ve made with my golf swing, it was just a matter of time. I?m excited about my prospects for next year.? 

Woods was never troubled in Sunday?s final round and carded five birdies against two bogeys at the Phoenix Country Club. 

?I knew that if I shot under par on each side the guys chasing me would have to shoot in the 50s to catch me and that?s pretty tough to do,? he joked. 

Jyoti Randhawa finished joint 12th after tallying an aggregate of 281. The Indian, 14th overnight, shot a one-under 69 in the final round. 

Daniel Chopra, a Swede of Indian origin, finished a creditable joint fifth with 276.

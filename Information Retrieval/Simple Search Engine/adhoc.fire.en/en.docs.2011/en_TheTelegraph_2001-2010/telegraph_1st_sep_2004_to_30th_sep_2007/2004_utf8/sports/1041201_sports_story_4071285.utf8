 Vijay swept all but 1,000 Guineas 

 STAR RACER

 Vijay

 The back-to-back fixtures, beginning last Friday, saw the complete dominance of trainer Vijay Singh. He left his rival schooler, Daniel David, with a solitary victory against his tally of seven. But it was the most sought-after wins, from among the 13 events held during the two meetings, that Daniel claimed ? the 1,600m Calcutta 1,000 Guineas, the first classic of the season. 

 His hot-favourite, Star Angel, not only justified her odds on Friday, but she also raised hopes of another classic win. The 4-10 favourite never came under pressure and to make her task easy, Vijay?s Almara got planted at the gates and left her stall nearly after 20 seconds late.

 Most of Vijay?s favourite winners were, however, at prohibited odds. His dream run of success started with the victory of Anzello in the RCGC Patron?s Cup, which the three-year-old claimed without a fuss. But Aperitivo?s success in the 1,400m Adelina Handicap was an eye-opener. The way the three-year-old left a good field of five cold, it may not surprise if his connections decide to push him in the 2,000 Guineas line up next Saturday.

 Approved?s victory in the 1,600m RCGC 175th Anniversary Trophy was equally overwhelming. The Excalibur?s Lake-Our Fantasy son literally gave an armchair ride to his jockey C. Alford who was associated with all of Vijay?s wins, excepting Corvino?s, the following day.

 Vijay?s bench-strength of male classic youngsters is so strong that he is in a position to send Approved for the Delhi Derby early next month. The horse may, however, return in time for the city?s Derby on January 8.

 Exclusive Affair completed Vijay?s rout on Friday with the four-length-plus victory. The Alnasr Alwasheek-Baroque Pearl son did shift out in the final stretch but it happened in view of his debut run. More races are in store for him.

 On Saturday, Vijay continued from where he had left off the previous day. The trainer?s Apprise, in the 1,600m Bangalore Turf Club, recorded his fourth straight win, and with an equal ease to indicate that he was not a spent force yet. But the most fluent of all Vijay?s winners on the day was Corvino, ridden by S. Shanker. The American Chance-Engaging three-year-old had let down a large following in last outing when pushed straight into a mile race after his failed attempts over sprints. Not bothered about horse?s expanding odds, Shanker virtually made it a start-to-finish affair.

 The 1,200m Army Cup, the feature event in the afternoon?s card, was expected to be a formality for Vijay?s Alaskan. But the Tecorno-Loud Water three-year-old made heavy weather of his three-length victory. In fact, 300m from home, the topweighted hot-favourite appeared to be sluggish in his movement as Daniel?s La Fantasie called the shots. But he got going inside to last furlong to the relief of his followers.

 Trainer H.S. Bath?s Karan?s Choice foiled Vijay?s attempt to match his Friday?s tally of four in the 1,100m Gen. A. S. Vaidya Memorial Cup. The winner, a Sizzling Melody-Rush O Gold son, in fact, never faced any threat from Vijay?s favourite Arakawa. Mark Reuben had the three-year-old filly settled in fifth till the halfway stage and brought her in to the contention 250m from home. She skated clear of the field in a trice leaving the favourite to defend the second berth from High Chief.

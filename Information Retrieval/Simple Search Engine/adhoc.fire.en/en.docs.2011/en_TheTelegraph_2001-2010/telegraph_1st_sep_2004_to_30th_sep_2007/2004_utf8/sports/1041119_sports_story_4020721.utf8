 Woolmer sceptical

Dubai: Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer has welcomed proposals for a new throwing law but says it might not put an end to controversies in the future. ?Essentially it?s a good thing for cricket although I don?t know how it will be implemented,? he said on Thursday. 

?There will always be people who are going to find fault with it, but I know people involved in putting together the proposed changes and they are all good. 

?The scientific evidence shows that every time your wrist moves, your elbow moves. The point the ICC is trying to make is that no one has a completely straight arm because of the muscle texture.? 

An ICC chief executive meeting scheduled for February will consider proposals to allow all bowlers to bend their elbows by 15 degree. 

?I am not sure if the issue of throwing will be settled once the laws come into force,? added Woolmer, who is on a coaching assignment here. 

?The same thing will happen if the match referee and umpire think the ball is not going out legally.? (Reuters)

 Rossi can make F1 switch, feel drivers 

Shanghai: Motorcycling world champion Valentino Rossi has the talent to drive in Formula One, Rubens Barrichello said on Friday. 

Rossi impressed during a secret Ferrari test this year and Barrichello believes, with enough mileage under his belt, he could switch from two wheels to four. 

?I would have no problems ? I?m a big fan,? said the Brazilian, bidding to win his second race in a row at Sunday?s inaugural Chinese Grand Prix. ?If he can do in a car what he does on a bike it would be fantastic. He would beat all of us.? 

The Italian press has speculated that Rossi could have a chance if champions Ferrari have to run three cars next year to make up the numbers on a depleted starting grid. On the eve of the last race in Monza, Ferrari boss Jean Todt was quoted as saying: ?If Rossi wants to race in Formula One, it is entirely up to him.? 

Seven-time F1 world champion Michael Schumacher praised Rossi as a ?natural? after the Italian drove the Ferrari at the team?s Fiorano test track in April. 

Barrichello, however, sounded a note of caution. ?I was there the day Valentino (tested) the car and he ran very well,? he said. ?Obviously, for him to race I think he will need more than just the month of December to test. He will need a lot of testing to get reasonable times out of the car.? 

Meanwhile, former world champion Jacques Villeneuve also backed Rossi.?He is so quick on a motorbike, there?s no reason for him to be slow in a car,? said Villeneuve, who will make his race return after a year out on Sunday. 

?He?s a great driver. I?m sure with enough testing he would be up to speed. The main difficulty would be physical because F1 hurts. 

?If you haven?t been in a car and you have been on a motorbike, the first winter won?t be enough physically. You just need a lot of mileage.?

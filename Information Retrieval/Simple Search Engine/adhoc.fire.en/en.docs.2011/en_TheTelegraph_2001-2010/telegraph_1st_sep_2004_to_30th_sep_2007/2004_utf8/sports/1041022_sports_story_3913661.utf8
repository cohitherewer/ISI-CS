 Beckham let off with warning

 - BOOKING AGAINST WALES 

 David Beckham 

London: England captain David Beckham was let off with a warning and will not face disciplinary action after telling a newspaper he deliberately got himself booked in a World Cup qualifier against Wales, the Football Association (FA) said on Thursday. 

Beckham caused a furore by saying he fouled Wales defender Ben Thatcher in order to get a yellow card and serve out a one-match suspension for the qualifier against Azerbaijan while injured. 

Beckham suffered a rib injury moments before his booking in the Group Six game on October 9 and knew he would be ruled out of the 1-0 victory in Azerbaijan four days later. 

?Following due process under the FA?s disciplinary regulations, the FA?s compliance department has reviewed all available information and concluded that there is insufficient evidence to pursue a disciplinary charge,? a statement said. 

?However, David Beckham has been reminded of his responsibilities and the rules of conduct he is expected to adhere to both as an England player and as captain. ?The FA now considers this matter to be closed.? 

The Real Madrid midfielder could have been suspended for England?s next qualifier in March at home to Northern Ireland. 

England lead Group Six on 10 points, ahead of Poland (9), Austria (5), Northern Ireland (3), Wales (2) and Azerbaijan (2).

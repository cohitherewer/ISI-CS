Melbourne: Australia?s Damien Martyn scored 142, his sixth Test century of 2004, before Pakistan suffered a spectacular top-order batting collapse on the third day of the second Test on Tuesday. 

Pakistan limped to 85 for five in their second innings at the close of play to lead by 47 runs. 

The unbeaten batsmen were Mohammed Sami on eight and Shoaib Malik on 11. 

Martyn?s patient knock of more than six hours lifted Australia?s total from 171 for five to 379 all out at tea in reply to Pakistan?s 341, which included 111 from stand-in-captain Yusuf Youhana. 

Martyn put on 59 for the sixth wicket with Adam Gilchrist (48) and 93 for the eighth wicket with Jason Gillespie (50 not out). 

Pakistan paceman Shoaib Akhtar (5/109) claimed his second five-wicket haul of the series and leg-spinner Danish Kaneria was also a constant threat, taking five for 125 from 39.3 overs. 

With Australia resuming on their overnight score of 203 for five, Pakistan had been aiming to snatch a big first innings lead. 

The touring side?s depleted bowling attack removed Shane Warne (10) and Gilchrist in the first session. 

Martyn then combined brilliantly with the long-haired fast bowler Gillespie, who hit four fours and one six in two-and-a-half hours to score his second career Test half-century. 

The 33-year-old Martyn is the second-leading scorer in Test cricket this year with 1,353 runs, behind team mate Justin Langer?s 1,476. South Africa?s Jacques Kallis is third on 1,278. 

Martyn took almost five hours and 189 balls including seven fours to reach his 11th Test century, pushing a ball from Sami to mid-wicket and jogging through for a single with both arms raised. 

The Western Australia right-hander, who made 100 not out in Australia?s 491-run win in the first Test in Perth, was eventually trapped by Kaneria after hitting 12 fours, leaving the hosts on 347 for eight. 

Shoaib then claimed his fifth wicket when he had Michael Kasprowicz caught in the gully for four and Glenn McGrath fell soon after to Kaneria for one. 

Buoyed by their first innings advantage of 38, Australia?s new-ball attack tore through Pakistan?s top order. 

McGrath removed Salman Butt for a duck in the opening over and Yasir Hameed for 23 after Imran Farhat had been caught at deep square leg off Jason Gillespie for five. 

 Razzaq in hospital 

Abdul Razzaq was taken to hospital on Tuesday after complaining of dizziness and shortness of breath, team officials said. 

Razzaq, 25, fell ill at the team?s hotel before the start of the third day?s play. He was learnt to have fallen out of bed and found himself unable to return to bed, complaining of dizzy spells, with an abnormal pulse rate. 

An ambulance crew was called to treat him at the hotel, a Metropolitan Ambulance Service spokesman said. 

The spokesman said the player was taken to a private hospital for further treatment. 

Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer said Razzaq had returned from hospital but the problem was not diagnosed.

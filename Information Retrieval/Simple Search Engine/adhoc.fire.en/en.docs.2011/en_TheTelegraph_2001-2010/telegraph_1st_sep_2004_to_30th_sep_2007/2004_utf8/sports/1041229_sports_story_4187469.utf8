 Romario quits 

 Rio De Janeiro: Romario, the man who led Brazil to their 1994 World Cup triumph, said he was retiring from the game, Brazilian media reported on Tuesday. 

?I stopped. I can?t do it anymore. I don?t have the desire,? Romario was quoted in the O Globo news agency. 

The 38-year-old striker, who was vacationing in Florianopolis said he planned to play one final game as farewell to fans at Maracana Stadium in 2005. 

?I thought of playing one half with a Vasco jersey and the other with a Flamengo jersey,? Romario remarked. (AP)

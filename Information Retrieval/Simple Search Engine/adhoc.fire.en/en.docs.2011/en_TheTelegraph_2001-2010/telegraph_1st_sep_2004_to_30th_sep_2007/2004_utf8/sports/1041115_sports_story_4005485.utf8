Los Angeles: Top-ranked Lindsay Davenport pulled off a stunning 3-6, 7-5, 6-1 win over Serena Williams at the WTA Tour Championships on Saturday, but her battling effort was not enough to get her into the semi-finals. 

Davenport ended Red Group round-robin play with a 2-1 record, identical to that of Serena and Anastasia Myskina, who overcame Russian compatriot Elena Dementieva 6-3, 6-3 in the late match. 

However, Serena and Myskina advanced to the semi-finals because they both won five sets in their three matches compared to Davenport?s four. 

World No. 2 Amelie Mauresmo, who defeated Wimbledon champion Maria Sharapova 7-5, 6-4 in their final Black Group match, can now take over the year-end top ranking if she wins the tournament. 

The Frenchwoman went undefeated in round-robin play and has won 11 straight matches dating back to her title runs in Linz and Philadelphia. 

?If she wins this tournament, she deserves it (the No. 1 ranking),? Davenport said. 

?You come in and win all three tournaments, that?s a great accomplishment. Amelie is the best player not to win a Grand Slam who is competing now. 

?I respect Amelie a lot because she makes no secret of what troubles her. She?s very honest and open to what she needs to work on and how the pressure gets to her. 

?I think that?s a healthy way of dealing with it and one she can overcome. She has a lot of game.? 

While Davenport would prefer to end the year at No. 1, she was still pleased with her year. 

?No matter what happens, reaching number one was a huge accomplishment after going through the injuries I have,? said Davenport, who won seven titles this year. 

?It was a lot of fun to play the whole season without major injuries.? 

Even though their match meant little because they had already qualified for the semi-finals, Mauresmo was successful in imposing her athletic, all-court attack upon the 17-year-old Sharapova, who admitted to tiredness after playing three straight days. 

?She has so much experience and knows what to do more at points,? Sharapova said. ?She moves very well, makes me play a lot of balls and has a great slice.? 

Mauresmo is thrilled with her play this week, having beaten three of Russia?s most highly touted young players without dropping a set. 

 ?I?m in Moscow now. I don?t need to go there. Moscow is in LA this week,? Mauresmo laughed. 

Serena appeared to be on her way to victory after controlling the first set but Davenport upped her serve a notch in the second and exhausted her opponent by taking the ball early and gunning them into the corners. 

Davenport broke Serena to win the second set when the six-time Grand Slam champion double-faulted. 

The top seed dominated the third set, breaking Serena twice and pummelling her forehand side. 

Davenport won 80 per cent of her first serve points in the match and committed only 22 unforced errors to Serena?s 28. 

?I pretty much shot myself in the foot a few times,? Serena said. 

?I didn?t take my opportunities. There was no way I should have lost that match, but I did. I sucked. I cannot put it in any other words. I would, but I?m a Christian woman.? 

In the semis, Mauresmo will face Serena and Myskina will play Sharapova for a place the final.

 London: Britain?s Olympic Games boxing silver medallist Amir Khan could be paid ? 70,000 a year to preserve his amateur status in order to fight at the Beijing Games in 2008, it was reported here.

 The 17-year-old middleweight has been deluged with offers to turn professional since his sparkling performances in Athens last month but Khan has insisted he wants one more shot at the Olympic gold in China in four years? time.

 On Thursday, Paul King, development officer of the Amateur Boxing Association (ABA), told the BBC that they are set to table an offer of ? 70,000-a-year tax-free for the Bolton boxer to preserve his amateur status. 

 Santiago: Chile midfielder Claudio Maldonado has been given a two-match suspension after being sent off in the World Cup qualifier against Colombia and will miss next month?s matches with Ecuador and Argentina. Brazilian-based Maldonado was in the squad for the tie with Argentina in Santiago on October 13 but the Chilean football association (ANFP) said on Thursday that world governing body Fifa had added an extra game to his automatic one-match ban. 

 Madrid: Real Madrid defender Jonathan Woodgate has successfully recovered from a long-term thigh injury and should be ready to train with the rest of the team in a maximum of two weeks, according to club medical staff.

 Doctor Juan Carlos Hernandez said that the England international, who signed for Real for 20 million euros ($24.64 million) in August, was being subjected to a pre-season training regime in order to recover his fitness after a five-month injury layoff.

 Newcastle: Newcastle United midfielder Kieron Dyer will be out of action for up to four weeks because of injury, ruling him out of England?s World Cup qualifiers next month.

 The 25-year-old suffered a hamstring strain in Newcastle?s Uefa Cup tie against Israel?s Bnei Sackhnin last week and is likely to miss England?s qualifiers against Wales on October 9 and Azerbaijan four days later.

 ?Kieron will be out for a while because he has a hamstring and with a hamstring I would think that he will be out for four weeks from now,? the Premier League club?s manager Graeme Souness said on Friday.

 Athens: Paralympic judo champion Sergio Perez has been stripped of his gold after failing a doping test but has escaped a ban.

 The Cuban, who won the over-60 kg category, returned a positive test for a glucocorticosteroid agent prednisolone after winning the gold. The IOC decided not to impose a ban as the drug is not considered to enhance performance. The rules of judo do not allow redistribution of medals, meaning that Japan?s Makoto Hirose will not be upgraded to gold.

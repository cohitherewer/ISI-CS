The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sport

 Friday, December 17, 2004 

 Sydney: Women?s world No. 1 Lindsay Davenport and men?s No. 3 Lleyton Hewitt headed the list of entries released on Thursday for next month?s Australian Open warm-up event, the Sydney International.

 ?Lleyton?s resurgence began at this tournament in 2004 after having a year-end ranking of 17 in 2003,? Sydney International tournament director Craig Watson said in a statement.

 ?Lindsay won a tour-high seven titles out of nine finals this year. There were suggestions she might have hung up her rackets so we are delighted to see she has changed her mind and will return to Sydney.?

 French Open champion Anastasia Myskina and fellow-Russian Elena Dementieva will also compete.

 Brussels: Former world No.1 Justine Henin-Hardenne will return to action in an exhibition match this weekend after being out for three months with exhaustion.

 The Belgian will face Nathalie Dechy in Charleroi on Saturday after recovering from the lingering effects of a virus which has kept her out since her fourth round US Open defeat in September.

 ?Justine?s richer and more promising tennis will be tested at the Women?s Tennis Trophy,? a statement on her personal website said. ?Justine is fully aware of the fact that it will still take a while before she will be back on the physical level she was before the virus.?

 New York: Mike Tyson has closed the book on one of his many run-ins with the law: his brawl last year with two men outside a Brooklyn hotel.

 Wearing a pink button-down shirt, leather jacket and cap pulled low over his eyes, Tyson made his way through a clump of photographers and the occasional fan to a downtown Brooklyn courtroom.

 The former heavyweight boxing champ had completed the 100 hours of community service imposed when he pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct under an agreement with prosecutors, lawyer Mel Sachs told the judge on Wednesday. Tyson also completed six months of counselling ordered by the judge. With prosecutors? consent, the judge dismissed the charge against Tyson and ordered the record sealed. 

 Madrid: Arsenal midfielder Edu, whose contract with the London club expires at the end of the season, says he has yet to make up his mind whether his future lies at Real Madrid, Valencia or Barcelona.

 ?They are three very prestigious clubs and they all have a lot going for them,? the Brazilian international told Spanish sports daily AS on Thursday.?I?m very proud that they are talking about me so much. I?m looking at all the possibilities to see which one will suit me as a footballer but haven?t taken any decision yet as I?m not allowed to do that until January 1.?

 Fifa regulations allow players to start negotiating with other clubs six months before their contracts expire. The midfielder said that Arsenal had offered him a new contract but that the proposed deal had not lived up to his expectations. 

 Madrid: Atletico Madrid have agreed a deal with Birmingham City to sign Denmark winger Jesper Gronkjaer for a fee of around 2 million euros ($2.67 million), Spanish media reported on Thursday. The 27-year-old joined Birmingham from Chelsea for ? 2.2 million last July, but has failed to settle at St Andrews.

 Title will mean more than record: Pires

Paris: Arsenal?s French midfielder Robert Pires said the English champions were more concerned with retaining their Premier League title than stretching their unbeaten record to 50 games. 

If Arsenal avoid defeat against Aston Villa this weekend and at Old Trafford against Manchester United the following weekend they will reach the half century mark. 

?The English fans dream of seeing us not lose next weekend against Aston Villa and then go to Old Trafford to seek a 50th unbeaten game against Manchester United,? Pires told sports daily l?Equipe. ?That?s nice but the only thing we?re interested in is to be crowned champions once more.? 

Pires believes the introduction of new players like Spain?s Jose Antonio Reyes has given the Gunners more strength in depth than last season when they struggled to emulate their domestic form in the Champions League. 

?You can?t complain. Competition is healthy and this year we have enough players to fight on all fronts,? said Pires. ?Last year we were ousted from the Champions League and the FA Cup because we were caught in an incredible whirl of games. 

?We played every other day and ended up exploding physically. ?This year, with the arrival of Jose Antonio Reyes but also with the rise of Gael Clichy, Francesco Fabregas, Robin van Persie and Philippe Senderos, we are far more solid.? (Reuters)

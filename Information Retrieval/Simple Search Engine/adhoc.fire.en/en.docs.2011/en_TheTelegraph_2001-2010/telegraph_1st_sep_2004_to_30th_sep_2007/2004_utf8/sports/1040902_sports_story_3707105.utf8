The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Indo-Pak clash on Nov. 13 

 BCCI Platinum Jubilee

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta: The one-day International 

 match between India and Pakistan, organised by the Board 

 of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to celebrate its 

 platinum jubilee, will be held on November 13 at the Eden 

 Gardens, according to BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya. 

 The match was originally scheduled 

 on November 14.

 Announcing this on Wednesday, 

 Dalmiya said the change in date was necessitated by a Calcutta 

 Police request, who raised genuine concern that November 

 11 being Kali Puja, the scheduled date for the match (November 

 14) would clash with the last day for idol immersion. 

 Moreover, the Id festival would 

 be observed on November 15 and 16.

 Dalmiya said he had a discussion 

 with the Pakistan Cricket Board chief Shaharyar Khan and 

 the alternate date of the match was agreed upon. 

 Subsequently, I had a discussion 

 with Calcutta Police authorities and though there may be 

 some difficulties, they have given their consent, he said.

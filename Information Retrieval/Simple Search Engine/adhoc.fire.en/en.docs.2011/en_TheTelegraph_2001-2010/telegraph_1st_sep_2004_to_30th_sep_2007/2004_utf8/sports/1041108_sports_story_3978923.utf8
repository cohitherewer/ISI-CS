 Hong Kong: England claimed a crushing five-wicket victory over Sri Lanka on Sunday to win the Hong Kong international cricket sixes tournament for the second successive year. A superb bowling display by England restricted Sri Lanka to a modest 61 for four in the five eight-ball overs of the final.

 England then knocked off the runs with almost two overs to spare to win their fourth title and equal Pakistan?s record for the most number of wins.

 ?We bowled magnificently. Our bowlers won the game for us,? said England captain Matthew Maynard.

 England had booked their berth in the final with a 15-run victory over the UAE in the semi-final. In the other semi-final, Sri Lankan off-spinner Dilruwan Perera took a hattrick with a 10-run victory over Pakistan.

 New Delhi: India?s Ashok Kumar finished a creditable fifth in the inaugural $200,000 Carlsberg Masters golf tournament in Hanoion Sunday. Although he was nowhere at his best in carding a one-over 73 at the newly-built Chi Linh Star Golf and Country Club par-72 course, his fine 68 in the penultimate round on Saturday ensured him a fat pay packet.

 Joint fourth overnight, Ashok finished with an aggregate of 282 (71-70-68-73), six strokes adrift of winner Angelo Que of the Philippines. Asian No. 1 Thongchai Jaidee of Thailand finished second with 278 in the apga tour event.

 Arjun Singh finished with an aggregate of 291, while Harmeet Kahlon and Amandeep Johl finished with identical totals of 292. 

 New York: Britain?s world record holder Paula Radcliffe won the New York marathon on Sunday in 2: 23.10. Kenyan Susan Chepkemei was second in 2:23:14 after running alongside Radcliffe during the final 10kms of the 42.195 kms race. Radcliffe, 30, was running her first marathon since dropping out of last August?s Athens Olympic race after starting as the favourite. She also failed to finish the 10,000m final. ?I was reasonably confident I could outsprint her,? she said on Sunday.South African Hendrick Raamala won the men?s race in 2:09:28.

 London: Adrian Mutu, banned for seven months for testing positive for cocaine, has been offered a job as Romania?s assistant coach. 

 Romania boss Anghel Iordanescu said: ?I have invited him to join the national team during his break to become my assistant coach. ?I am sure Adrian will come back from this and we want to help him. He has the ability because he is a strong individual and has the support of everybody in Romania.?

 Brussels: The ball burst on impact when midfielder Walter Baseggio scored Anderlecht?s equaliser in their 2-1 home win over La Louviere in the Belgian first division on Saturday. Baseggio shot from edge of the penalty area and, despite bursting, the deflated ball found the net.

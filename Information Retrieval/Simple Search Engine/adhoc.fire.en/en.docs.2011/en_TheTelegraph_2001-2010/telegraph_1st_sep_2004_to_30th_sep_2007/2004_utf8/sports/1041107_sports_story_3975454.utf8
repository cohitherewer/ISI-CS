Paris: Russian sixth seed Marat Safin overcame an injury scare to beat Argentina?s 13th seed Guillermo Canas 6-2, 7-6 (7-5) on Saturday to move into the final of the Paris Masters. 

The 24-year-old Russian, winner here in 2000 and 2002, wrapped up his semi-final in 1hr 35 min and will face either Max Mirnyi of Belarus or Czech Republic?s Radek Stepanek in Sunday?s final. 

As well as chasing his third title here ? a feat only matched by Boris Becker ? Safin will also be eyeing his third title of the season after winning in Beijing and the Madrid Masters. 

It will be his fifth final of the year that saw him languishing at 86 in the world at the start of the season. 

But Safin?s title push almost suffered an agonising and premature end in the second game of the opening set. 

He crashed to the ground chasing a Canas forehand and limped back to his chair where he needed treatment on his right ankle from the trainer and tour doctor. 

On Friday, Safin outshone Lleyton Hewitt in straight sets. 

The Russian, seeded sixth, stormed into the semi-finals 6-4, 7-6 (7-2) and is the only favourite left in the last four of the tournament after his victory over the Australian second seed. Canas dismissed Spaniard Feliciano Lopez 6-3, 6-3. 

Czech qualifier Radek Stepanek reached the last four with a 7-6 (7-1), 6-3 victory over Russian Mikhail Youzhny. He will play another qualifier, Belarussian Max Mirnyi, who beat Sweden?s Robin Soderling 6-7 (5-7) 6-4 7-6 (7-5). 

?I don?t want to have a lot of expectations by saying that I am a favourite. I would love to see myself there, as well as the other three guys going to be in the semi-finals,? Safin said. 

But he admitted he felt especially well in Paris. ?I feel like I?m playing really my best tennis here, every time I come here. ?For some reason I feel really great on the court. I cannot explain why,? he said. 

And the Paris magic, which Safin would like to work at the French Open as well, was there again on Friday, perhaps more than ever before. 

Safin has never won a tournament three times and, should he make it this weekend, he will emulate Boris Becker, the only player with a trio of titles in Bercy. 

The Russian struck 10 aces in the 100-minute match, won 80 percent of his points on his first serve and was a model of consistency against one of the most impressive tennis machines on the circuit. 

His backhand was probably the key to the match as it was the weapon he used to secure his two breaks, in the third game of the first set and the sixth of the second. 

Safin?s serve only let him down once but at a crucial time, when he was serving for his first match point at 5-4 in the second set, letting Hewitt back in. But it was only a reprieve as the Russian cruised ahead in the tie-break, which he won 7-2.

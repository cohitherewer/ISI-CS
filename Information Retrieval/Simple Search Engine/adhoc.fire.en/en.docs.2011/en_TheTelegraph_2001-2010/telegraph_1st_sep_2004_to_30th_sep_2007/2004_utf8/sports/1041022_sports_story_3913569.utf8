 Bhupathi?s team pips Paes-Rikl

New Delhi: Indo-Belarussian pair Mahesh Bhupathi and 

Max Mirnyi got the better of Leander Paes and David Rikl and entered the doubles 

quarter finals of the 2.45-million-euro Madrid Masters on Wednesday. 

The fifth-seeded Bhupathi and Mirnyi won a closely fought first-round match 6-4, 7-6 (7-4) to oust Paes and Rikl, according to information received here on Thursday. 

The Indo-Belarussian pair will now face Dominik Hrbaty of Slovakia and Germany?s Rainer Schuettler. 

The loss left Leander Paes and David Rikl with a difficult 

task of pushing up their team ranking from 10 to eight in the next two weeks so 

as to qualify for the year-end world doubles championships in Houston.

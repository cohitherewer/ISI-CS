Chandigarh: Pushed to the wall, India face an onerous task of saving the series against arch rivals Pakistan when they play the sixth Test here Wednesday, possibly without their most experienced player and captain Dilip Tirkey who looks a doubtful starter. 

The showing in Delhi, where they lost 1-3 Monday, should serve as an eye opener to the Indians who must regroup themselves fast before the series, being played for the first time after a gap of five years, goes out of their grasp. 

A victory Wednesday will ensure yet another series win for Pakistan, already leading the eight-Test contest 3-1 after five matches. The side has so far emerged triumphant in five out of eight bilateral series with India, taking two and the other ending in a draw. 

It could be an extremely difficult task for the home team to beat Pakistan, who seem to have settled into a rhythm after some ordinary showing in Pakistan. 

The possible absence of Tirkey, struck on the wrist and temple during the Delhi match, could further affect their chances. 

Tirkey was lucky not to suffer any broken bones from the Sohail Abbas drag flick. But the impact of the rasping shot was so much so that he had to be stretchered out of the ground before being rushed to the hospital to get the affected areas examined. 

If Tirkey misses the match, it would be a big blow to the side containing a number of young players since there was hardly anyone who could match the veteran?s performance on the field or his vast experience. 

India?s assistant coach Jagbir Singh has already admitted that his side would be under pressure to deliver in Wednesday?s match as even a small mistake would ring the curtains down on their hopes of winning the series. 

?Yes, my boys will be under pressure and I am not denying that. But all are quite capable players and I hope they will overcome this and play to their potential,? Jagbir said. Jagbir also said his side must not repeat the mistakes that it did in Delhi and should make the most of the chances that come their way to win the match. 

?We missed several sitters. When were trailing 1-2, a goal there could have levelled the score and who knows may have squared the series as well. We must score when there is a chance,? he said. 

India need to overcome a confident Pakistan, boasting several match-winners including ace penalty corner expert Sohail Abbas. Abbas is just one goal away from becoming the top goal-scorer in the world. 

Monday?s match exposed the inexperience of the Indian forwards who failed to be at the right place at the right time, which was evident from the number of misses. 

The failure of Sandeep Singh to double up as the penalty corner expert has added to the team?s problem. 

The teenager from Haryana played for a brief period Monday during which he unsuccessfully took one penalty corner before being withdrawn by chief coach Gerhard Rach.

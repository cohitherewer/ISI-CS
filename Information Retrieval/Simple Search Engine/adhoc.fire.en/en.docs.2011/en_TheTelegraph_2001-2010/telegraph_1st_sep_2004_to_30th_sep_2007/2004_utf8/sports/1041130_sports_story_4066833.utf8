The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Sehwag leaves SA clueless

 - Anil Kumble bags 61st wicket of the year 

INDRANIL MAJUMDAR

Calcutta: The empty terraces at Eden Gardens may have taken all by surprise, but Jagmohan Dalmiya amp; Co. can look to Virender Sehwag for solace. If South Africa?s batting, apart from Jacques Kallis, came as a dampener, the Indian opener?s cameo on Monday can do a lot in wooing the crowd back. 

However hard South Africa might have prepared for this tour, they have been left clueless when confronted by Sehwag?s might. His presence at the crease in sure to give Graeme Smith another sleepless night ahead of the third day. 

Not without reason did Ray Jennings react in good humour when asked at the media conference on how he planned to stop Sehwag ? ?Shoot him in the hotel,? he quipped. 

Till Sehwag launched into the attack, it was the Mandira Bedis and the Jonty Rhodes that hogged all the attention. South Africa?s never showed the urgency to make things happen and it was left to India to take all the initiative. 

Only 78 runs were added to their overnight tally in more than 166 minutes of batting on the second day. Once Sourav Ganguly removed Jacques Kallis with an inswinger, the batsman misjudging the delivery, it was a question of how long it would take for the last rites to be completed. 

But the batsmen stuck to their crease and very little of positive cricket was on show. The hosts did their chance no good by flooring a couple of offers, Dinesh Karthik being the culprit. When Harbhajan Singh finally got the opportunity to bowl ten overs after lunch, he struck with two wickets in three balls to bring the curtains down on a yawn-inducing session. 

Anil Kumble, meanwhile, grabbed his wicket No. 431 and joined England?s Steve Harmison as the highest wicket-taker this year with 61 scalps, Shaun Pollock being the victim. Shane Warne is just one behind on 60. 

The early departure of Gautam Gambhir had very little impact as Sehwag took charge. He batted with the flourish and extravagance of a multimillionaire at a casino, dealing in boundaries, and big shots. Eighteen short of his second consecutive hundred in the series, he gives the comfort and confidence to his teammates which others only dream of. 

None of the bowlers were spared the treatment they deserved, Justin Ontong being picked for special mention. Nineteen runs off one over from the leg-spinner, including a huge-swept six, have almost nipped his aspirations of bowling in sub-continent conditions in the bud. 

There hasn?t been any quality spinner in this South African side. Nicky Boje?s pulling out has left them rudderless. Jennings blames it on spinners not being nurtured back home. 

?Spinners don?t just get the chance to develop in South African cricket. Too many wickets are taken by the medium pacers in the domestic competitions. State sides don?t encourage spinners to bowl,? he said. The experience here has already forced him to ponder about the need for ?things to change.? 

Even the pacers haven?t come good. Pollock and Makhaya Ntini apart, there has hardly been any awe-inspiring effort. 

The unbroken second wicket pair has already added 112 runs. If Sehwag?s flamboyance has been the talking point, Rahul Dravid?s cool presence has given the assurance needed for partnerships to blossom. The vice-captain?s sternly-disciplined and impeccable 33 has been timed to perfection. 

If the Indians can bat through the third day ? which in all probability they should ? with confidence, the visitors will then find the going tough. The pitch still isn?t causing much worry, but as Harbhajan Singh pointed out ?it will be good fun? for the visitors tackling the Indian spin duo again. 

The brisk rate of scoring will assume importance considering that almost 18 overs have already been lost. No solution seems to be in sight after play was again called off seven minutes early, prompting a 9.23 am start on Day III.

 Parma face elimination

 - UEFA CUP 

London: Managerless Parma, who won the Uefa Cup twice in the 1990s but are now struggling to cope with financial hardship, face the prospect of elimination from the competition on Thursday. 

The Serie A strugglers must secure a big win over Besiktas in their final Group B game to reach the first knockout round. 

Parma sacked coach Silvio Baldini on Monday after a weekend defeat by Livorno left them stranded near the foot of Serie A. 

The Italian side are still reeling from the financial problems that beset their former parent company Parmalat last year that forced a sell-off of key players. 

Twelve qualifying places remain up for grabs from the final round of matches this week. 

Newcastle United, semi-finalists last year, can seal top spot in Group D by taking a point at home against Portugal?s Sporting, who also need a draw to progress. 

The English team, whose domestic form, especially at home, has not matched their Uefa exploits, have a strong incentive to win the group, thus avoiding a Champions League team in the knockout rounds when the competition resumes next year. 

The eight group winners are guaranteed a tie in the last 32 against a side finishing third in a group. The runners-up will face one of the eight sides ? including Cup holders Valencia ? who drop in from the Champions League. 

Newcastle, who have won all three of their group games to date, will want to take revenge for a pre-season 1-0 home defeat by Sporting. Sochaux need only to avoid defeat against Panionios to also advance. (Reuters)

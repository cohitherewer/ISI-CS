 Idaho triumphs 

 STAR RACER

 Trainer Daniel David leading in Idaho (Md Amil up) after winning the Monsoon Cup at the RCTC on Thursday

Calcutta: The short suspension of apprentice 

Gajender Singh opened the avenue for jockey Md Amil who scored a long-priced double 

at the RCTC on Thursday. The upcoming apprentice always had a choice of rides 

in Daniel David?s stable.

 Amil?s was a trophy double. Starting off with Idaho who claimed the 2,000m Monsoon Cup, the star attraction in the afternoon?s six-event card, Amil went on to guide Brighter Future to an easy victory in the 1,200m Mysore Race Club Cup. 

 He rode his winners in contrasting style. Idaho was ridden off the pace and brought into the fray in the final stretch to account for course-favourite Accuser. Brighter Future, on the other hand, was sent into a narrow lead from the start and Amil gave his rivals a slip with a long break in the home stretch to win untroubled.

 The afternoon also witnessed Assagi and Almara justifying their short odds in the 1,400m Roll ?N? Twist Cup and the Amazing Handicap, respectively. However, the former had to be belted excessively by his jockey Imran Chisty to beat Autumn Fantasy while Almara gave an armchair ride to C. Alford despite her top-weight of 60-kg.

 Pesi to quit riding, may train 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Champion jockey Pesi Shroff has decided hang up his riding boots after the conclusion of the Pune season, according to Mumbai sources. A nagging back injury and a weight problem has prompted him to cut short his riding career, though he is still considered one of the best in the profession.

 Pesi, a fine judge of pace and thoroughbreds, has a record eight Indian Derby wins and seven Turf Invitation Cups under his belt during a career spanning nearly two decades. His love for the sport may, however, see him in a different role ? training horses from the forthcoming Mumbai winter season.

 Surya back in lead with Sandipan

 Sandipan held by Venkatesh in Round 17 

Visakhapatnam: PSPB Grandmasters Surya Sekhar Ganguly and Sandipan Chanda continued to lead the tables after drawing their 17th round encounters in the 42nd national A chess championship on Thursday. 

Both Ganguly and Chanda have an identical 11 points from their 16 games so far and with just two more rounds to come in this 19-player contest they are almost reliving the experience of last edition when both tied for the top spot. 

Grandmaster Abhijit Kunte, also of PSPB, almost made certain of making it to the Indian team for another year with an easy draw with Ganguly in this round. 

Playing black, Abhijit had little problems in his pet Sicilian defence and he moved to 10 points with two more games in hand. 

Also on 10 points are IMs M. R. Venkatesh and S. Kidambi, but they both have just one game left to play. 

Venkatesh had it easy against Chanda while Kidambi was brilliance personified in crashing through the defences of seasoned grandmaster Dibyendu Barua who was thrown out of contention from the team after another disaster. 

Kidambi in fact outplayed Barua right from the opening. Looking at the championship situation Barua took to the English defence as black but he found Kidambi quite well-armed in that too. 

It took just 15 moves for Kidambi to get a stronghold on the position and an exchange sacrifice soon after made Barua?s position quite difficult. Barua found some solace in a piece sacrifice but the much needed counter play never surfaced. Kidambi wrapped the issue in just 24 moves. 

Grandmaster Koneru Humpy spoiled the party of IM Neelotpal Das in a keenly contested game where the former played black. 

Bakre, meanwhile, was involved in a none-too-eventful draw with Roktim Bandopaddhyay who is also training his sight for a place in the team now. 

With 8.5 points each in the bag, Roktim and Saptarshi Roy Chowdhury are in with a chance to come in the top six.

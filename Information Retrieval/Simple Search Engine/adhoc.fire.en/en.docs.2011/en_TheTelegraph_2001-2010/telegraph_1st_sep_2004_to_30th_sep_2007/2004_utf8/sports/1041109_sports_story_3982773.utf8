Madrid: Real Madrid moved into second place in the Primera Liga, behind arch-rivals Barcelona, after a penalty from Luis Figo and second-half strike from substitute Michael Owen earned them a 2-0 victory away to Malaga on Sunday. 

Owen secured Real the win after a shining moment of individual skill, tucking home from 12 metres out after cutting inside a defender to notch his fifth goal in six games. 

Victory left Real seven points behind unbeaten leaders Barcelona, who came from a goal down to claim an entertaining 2-1 win over Deportivo La Coruna at the Nou Camp on Saturday. 

This season?s surprise package Levante are in third, level on points with Real, after a close-range strike from defender Jesule gave them a 1-0 win at home to Athletic Bilbao. 

Sevilla slipped back to fourth when they were held to a 1-1 draw at home by lowly Real Mallorca in Hector Cuper?s debut in charge of the islanders. 

Last season?s champions Valencia continued their miserable run of form by slumping to a 0-1 defeat at Primera Liga newcomers Getafe, a result that left them in seventh place in the table, 11 points adrift of Barcelona. 

Claudio Ranieri?s side, who had not won in their previous eight outings in all competitions, were unable to cope with their determined and ambitious opponents who claimed the win thanks to a first-half strike from midfielder Michel. 

Despite his impressive recent scoring record, Owen found himself dropped from the starting line-up as Real coach Mariano Garcia Remon opted to strengthen his midfield by bringing in Albert Celades. 

Zinedine Zidane earned his side a penalty when he was brought down on the fringe of the area by Malaga defender Gerardo. 

Luis Figo sent keeper Juan Calatayud the wrong way with his perfect spot-kick to put Real in front in the 24th minute. 

Malaga were given few chances to get back on level terms and, when they did, they were unable to make the most of their opportunities. 

Former Manchester City striker Paulo Wanchope missed the target from inside the area on the half hour and the Costa Rican had a goal-bound shot deflected wide by Roberto Carlos just before the break. 

Real failed to press home their advantage in the second half, with Ronaldo and Raul missing a string of scoring chances. It was not until Owen extended their lead eight minutes after replacing the Brazilian that they were able to relax. 

Controlling a neat pass from Michel Salgado with his chest, the former Liverpool striker shimmied past a defender and drilled home inside the near post to continue his impressive scoring run. 

In Italy, title hopefuls AC Milan and Inter Milan were held to draws in Serie A on Sunday failing to take full advantage of leaders Juventus? first defeat of the season. 

Champions Milan drew 1-1 at home to a depleted AS Roma while Inter had to come from a goal behind to draw with an 80th minute Adriano equaliser at Fiorentina. 

Despite Juventus going down to Reggina on Saturday, Fabio Capello?s side still have a four point lead over second-placed Milan. 

Third-placed Lecce are 10 points behind the leaders after suffering their first home defeat of the season, an injury-time penalty from Czech midfielder Marek Jankulovski earning Udinese a thrilling 4-3 win. 

The victory allowed Udinese to climb six places to fourth, joining Lecce on 15 points. Messina, who drew 2-2 at Bologna, are fifth with the same number of points. 

At the San Siro, Milan took the lead in just the sixth minute when Brazilian Cafu raced down the right flank, picked out an unmarked Andriy Shevchenko at the back post and the Ukrainian striker made no mistake with a firm header. 

Milan withdrew Shevchenko for Argentine Hernan Crespo at the break but they quickly paid for not having wrapped the game up when three minutes after the restart Vincenzo Montella brought Roma level. 

Milan?s defence failed to clear from Brazilian winger Mancini and Montella first struck the bar and then pounced on the rebound to equalise. 

After Juventus? defeat, Inter are the only unbeaten side in Serie A but they will be frustrated not to have closed the gap on the leaders. 

Francesco Toldo was recalled to the Inter goal to face his former club after a month on the bench but had no chance of stopping Dario Dainelli?s superb header from a Fabrizio Miccoli corner in the 26th minute. Fiorentina were on top for most of the first half but Inter fought back after the break with Dejan Stankovic forcing a fine save from Cristian Lupatelli while Toldo produced a brilliant save to keep out the impressive Miccoli. 

Ten minutes from time Inter drew level when Cristiano Zanetti flicked on a corner that Adriano headed home from close range. 

Inter?s Stankovic was then sent off after picking up a second yellow card for dissent. 

Zdenek Zeman?s Lecce continue to produce the most exciting, open football in Serie A but were outdone by Udinese?s clinical counter-attacking and the finishing of Zeman?s fellow Czech Jankulovski.

Adelaide: Australia were in complete control of the second Test against New Zealand on Sunday, taking an overall lead of 381 after bowling the visitors out for 251 in their first innings. New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming scored 83, but his dismissal was the first of five wickets to fall in the post-lunch session of the third day?s play, including Nathan Astle, who scored 52. 

Glenn McGrath (4/66) and Jason Gillespie (3/37) shared seven wickets between them for Australia, who lead the two-match series 1-0. Australia captain Ricky Ponting opted not to enforce the follow-on after Australia?s first innings of 575 for eight declared. 

The hosts reached 57 without loss in their second innings by the close, with Justin Langer on 31 after his first innings 215 and Matthew Hayden 21 not out, becoming the first player to score 1,000 runs in four consecutive calendar years. 

After New Zealand had resumed on their overnight score of 56 for two, Michael Kasprowicz took the first wicket of the day when he trapped nightwatchman Paul Wiseman in front of the wicket for 11 at 80 for three. McGrath and Gillespie each took two wickets in the afternoon session before world record-holder Shane Warne claimed his 550th victim. 

McGrath triggered the collapse when he had Fleming caught behind after the left-hander shared a 73-run partnership for the fourth wicket with Nathan Astle. 

Astle was deceived by a slower ball from McGrath and popped a catch to Langer at short mid-wicket at 178 for five. 

Gillespie struck twice in five balls, removing first Test century-maker Jacob Oram caught behind for 12 and wicketkeeper Brendon McCullum leg before for 10. Warne then trapped James Franklin in front for seven. 

Scott Styris, battling a middle ear complaint which affected his balance and sight, joined Daniel Vettori and they went to tea at 216 for eight. 

Vettori was out in the seventh over with the second new ball when he was lbw to McGrath for 20 and Styris was the Australian?s fourth victim after belting 28, including four fours and one six. Australia were able to set their big total after Langer shared century stands with Hayden (70), Ponting (68) and Darren Lehmann (81).

Age not a factor with Aussies 

Stump Vision 

Ian Healy

Plenty of people in India are saying the Aussies are 

getting old, which will cost them this tour. Even some in Australia are mentioning 

age more than ever before, using pure statistics to draw some uneducated conclusions 

at times. All that is plain rubbish.

You cannot make any sort of judgment on a team, regarding 

the age of the players unless you are in the room with them. Don?t we all know 

some 60-year-olds or 40-year-olds with the constitution of much younger people?

Cricket players, too, could be the beneficiaries of 

stellar genes, unusually high pain thresholds and extraordinary motivation to 

get the absolute best out of themselves, allowing them to defy chronological statistics. 

Being physical is only one part of this great contest between Australia and India.

Supreme stability in the Australian ranks has seen 

this team become the oldest team (average age 32.6) since 1932-33 in Australian 

cricket. They are giving up six years per man to India in the cricket world?s 

toughest arena. Ninety percent of cricket however comes down to the psychological 

and this is where age comes in handy. How many years is this young Indian team 

handing straight back? 

The ability to separate cricket and life when things 

don?t go so well, being able to relax in between deliveries yet switch back in 

time for long periods and snatching initiative when an opportunity arises, is 

what cricket is all about. Knowledge of and belief in one?s ability are crucial 

and yet have precious little to do with the chronological. These players are keyed 

up and perfectly trained for this contest and much fitter physically than they 

need to be so that they can persist with concentration, patience and skill.

Bowling desperately calls for the above qualities 

and India must make Australia toil for far longer if they wish to see a change 

in opponent.

McGrath is running in the best I have seen for years, 

Kasprowicz is hustling and bustling beautifully, Gillespie conserving pace for 

consistency with quality and Warne is fighting impressively. Brett Lee chomping 

at the bit to target a rib cage or two would be an effective proposition in the 

last Test, if required.

Watch to see who rebounds to form quickest between 

Lehmann, Yuvraj, Laxman or Patel. The team goal is to get more out of your team 

than your opponent and this is where Australia are superior to India. 

Both teams have superstars about to return without 

match-play under their belt. Players today are more able to turn up and find rhythm 

with just net practice but it must be tough doing what Tendulkar and Ponting are 

about to do. It will help if Tendulkar uses a lighter bat to provide some relief 

to his arm. I felt in the last 12 months he had lost the flashing blade of previous 

years.

Ponting arrives to practice for a week and he will 

have a constant companion in the nets called Brett, the man the captain has ruled 

out of playing this series.Protective gear will be the order of the day for ?Punter?, 

not just good gloves to protect the suspect thumb.

 Immaculate annexes Hilliard Cup 

 STAR RACER

Calcutta: The Errol Bhungard-trained less fancied 

horse Immaculate romped home with the 1,200m Hilliard Cup, the first Class I event 

in the winter racing calendar and the star attraction in Wednesday?s card. Jockey 

Paul Kujur partnered the eight-year-old to victory over the strongly fancied Bharath 

Singh trainee Gypsy King. Errol had also saddled Chief Commissioner to victory 

earlier in the afternoon to end the day with a priced double.

 The day was, otherwise, ruled by trainer Vijay Singh and his stable jockey C. Alford who combined to notch up a good treble in a six-event card. The Vijay-Alford duo started off with Alashaan?s win in the 1,600m Zifi Handicap. The 6-10 favourite by Diffident out of Take A Powder not only travelled the mile trip comfortably but the three-year-old also registered the longest winning verdict of the day.

 Another of their half-money favourites Apprise, in the Ardiles Cup, was an equally facile winner. The fact that the four-year-old was returning to the race-track after nearly an eight-month lay off, his victory over Daniel David?s highly-rated three-year-old Royal Bounty looked very impressive.

 The trainer-jockey combination scored their third winner in the Soultline Handicap which the 3-1 chance Annabee claimed in a tight-finish from her stablemate Shalom, the 7-4 favourite.

 Daniel?s well backed Amazing Career delivered the goods in the Rising Star Cup. But the victory for the horse came at the expense of stable-apprentice Gajender Singh?s suspension. The apprentice was seen making a half-hearted bid on his ride Secret Prospector. He was, however, lucky to have escaped longer suspension than six-race days after a stewards? inquiry into the running and riding of the horse. Gajender will remain suspended between November 20 and December 25.

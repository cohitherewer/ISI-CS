 Queen?s grandson in car crash

Shanghai: Peter Phillips, grandson of Britain?s Queen Elizabeth, escaped injury after being involved in a car crash on his way to Sunday?s Chinese Grand Prix, the Williams Formula One team said. 

Phillips, who works in the team?s marketing department and is the son of Princess Anne, was one of four Williams employees in a van that was hit by a car at high speed on the way to the Shanghai circuit. 

A following car with Formula One doctors Sid Watkins and Gary Hartstein stopped at the scene of the accident a few minutes later to lend assistance, the team said. 

A spokeswoman said two team members, one of them marketing director Jim Wright, were taken to hospital for further checks but neither were seriously hurt. 

None of the occupants of the other vehicle were hurt.

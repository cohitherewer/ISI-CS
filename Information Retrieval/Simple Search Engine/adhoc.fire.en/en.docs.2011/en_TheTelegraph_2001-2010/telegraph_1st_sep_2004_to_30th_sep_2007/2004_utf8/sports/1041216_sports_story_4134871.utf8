The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Dempo fitness consultant dies at training

Margao: Fate seems to offer only irony to Goa?s 

Dempo Sports Club. The first ever Federation Cup win in Bangalore, on December 

5, was accompanied by the very player who gave them the Cup, Brazil?s Cristiano 

de Lima Junior. 

He scored twice versus Mohun Bagan in the final before 

collapsing on the field after a clash with Bagan goalkeeper Subrata Pal. 

That death was attributed to a heart attack. 

On Monday, the club suffered another tragedy. The club?s fitness consultant, Lancy Sequeira, died following a massive heart attack at Campal ground in Panaji, coach-cum-secretary of the club, Armando Colaco said Wednesday. 

The sequence of things were spine-chillingly similar. 

Sequeira, 48, former coach of the Indian athletic team, collapsed on the ground while training, Colaco said adding he was rushed to a nearby hospital but was declared brought dead. 

Sequeira was attached to Sports Authority of India 

as an athletic coach and was Dempo?s fitness consultant for four years.

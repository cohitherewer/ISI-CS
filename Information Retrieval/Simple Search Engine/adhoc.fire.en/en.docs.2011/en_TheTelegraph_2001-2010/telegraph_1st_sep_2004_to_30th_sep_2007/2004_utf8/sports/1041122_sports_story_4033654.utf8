 WICB rejects players? offer

Bridgetown (Barbados): The West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) has rejected a players? union proposal to resolve a dispute over personal endorsement contracts, and said that no new negotiations were scheduled. 

WICB head Roger Brathwaite said Saturday the board has rejected the West Indies Players? Association?s (WIPA) request ?to remove from the contract or substantially alter? a clause between the two bodies relating to the ?process by which a player can enter into personal endorsements.? 

The issue concerns the standard contract required by the WICB to participate in a three-week training camp in Barbados this month as preparation for the triangular one-day series in Australia in January. 

The camp will also introduce new coach Bennett King and assistant David Moore, both from Australia. 

The two sides held discussions for almost 18 hours Friday without any solution. Brathwaite did not give any indication about when negotiations could resume. 

The main issue concerns as many as 10 senior players, including captain Brian Lara, who have sponsorship deals with Cable and Wireless, a telecommunications competitor of Digicel, which recently signed multi-million dollar sponsorship deal with the WICB. (AP)

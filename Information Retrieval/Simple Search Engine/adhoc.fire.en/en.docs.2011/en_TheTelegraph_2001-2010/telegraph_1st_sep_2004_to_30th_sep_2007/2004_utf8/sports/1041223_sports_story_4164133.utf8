 England riding on Strauss? brilliance

 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

 Andrew Strauss can 

 become England?s best batsman 

 Michael Vaughan?s team took only 

 58 balls to complete their seven-wicket win over South Africa 

 in Port Elizabeth Tuesday, becoming the only England side 

 to win eight Test matches in succession.

 As was entirely fitting for a 

 man scoring 220 runs in the game, Andrew Strauss struck 

 the winning boundary to finish six runs short of a second 

 hundred in the game. Since launching his Test career by 

 accident last May, when he was picked as a late replacement 

 for Vaughan, Strauss, has known nothing but victory ? a 

 debunking of the claim that Test cricket is never an easy 

 game. 

 England?s winning margin will 

 look comfortable when assessed in years to come, but this 

 match was won with many players barely half-cooked, a gamble 

 the visitors only got away with because of South Africa?s 

 inexperience in key areas.

 Yet, given that England?s sinews 

 and attitudes are hardening by the day, it is difficult 

 to see how their winning streak will not be extended in 

 Durban, where the second Test begins on Boxing Day.

 Vaughan said: ?Going into the 

 Test, the idea of making history wasn?t in my mind at all. 

 Now we?ve achieved that, I do realise we?ve created something 

 very, very special.?

 The record means that Vaughan 

 has joined a small group of successful England captains, 

 though he will have to go some length to beat Steve Waugh, 

 who masterminded Australia?s world record trot of 16 wins 

 in a row four years ago. To overtake that run, England need 

 to win this series 5-0, beat Bangladesh 2-0 and then regain 

 the Ashes for the first time in 18 years by winning the 

 first three Tests.

 Although Vaughan refused to admit 

 his side lacked the necessary mental and physical preparation, 

 the evidence was everywhere from Flintoff?s ginger bowling 

 to Marcus Trescothick?s grim dead bat survival in England?s 

 first innings. Contrast their tentative cricket to the composed 

 certainty shown by Strauss, on tour for over a month now, 

 and the difference was obvious. With Strauss making three 

 hundreds and four fifties in his eight Tests, his stock 

 has risen to the point where he may be England?s best batsman, 

 something he certainly looked in this match. Possessed of 

 an organised mind, he appears to know his limitations and 

 rarely exceeds them. 

 Strauss is similar, if more phlegmatic 

 than Border, and Vaughan was right when he suggested the 

 left-hander would be a great asset to England for a good 

 while to come.

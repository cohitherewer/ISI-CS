The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Security head lands in Dhaka

 - Best has been done: Azad 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: A senior New Delhi-based IPS officer, Tapan Deka, has joined Team India in Bangladesh as its security head. 

Deka reached Dhaka on Friday morning, the opening day of the two-Test series, some hours before the Indian government?s recce team (headed by IG Yashovardhan Azad) returned home. 

The 1988 batch officer is going to stay with Sourav Ganguly and Co. throughout the tour, which concludes on December 28 after the three ODIs. 

That at least one officer will be sent by New Delhi was reported in these columns on Friday. The Bangladesh government, it may be recalled, has already assigned an SP (Shoaib Ahmed) to the Indians. 

?The best has been done and the recce team is back with the confidence that the trip is going to go off smoothly,? Azad told The Telegraph at the airport?s VIP lounge here, while in transit. 

He was accompanied by Shantanu Mukherjee, director in the ministry of home affairs, and Brij S. Katoch, joint secretary in the ministry of external affairs. 

While Azad didn?t go into details, one learns that the role of the local police ? both in Dhaka and Chittagong ? is minimal. 

The bulk of the security is (and will be) handled by the para-military Bangladesh Rifles and the elite Rapid Action battalions. 

Significantly, owing to security reasons, the Indians could fly to (and from) Chittagong aboard a chartered aircraft. 

Apparently, the players were ?very concerned? about the port city-leg of the tour, but have been ?convinced? New Delhi wouldn?t have okayed the Test and ODI if there was even the ?slightest risk.? 

In any case, the security assessment has been done by Azad who, earlier this year, was given the responsibility of approving arrangements in Pakistan before the Revival Series. 

That five-week trip went off without a hitch.

 Harika is sole leader

Heraklion (Greece): WGM Dronavalli Harika took the seventh round honours with a brilliant victory to emerge the sole leader in the under-14 girls section of the World Youth Chess Championship here Wednesday. 

Top-seeded Harika beat Germany?s Ohme Melanie to take her points tally to 6.5 out of a possible 7 and is half-a-point ahead of Elena Tairova of Russia (6). 

With just four more rounds to go, the Indian girl looks all set to clinch the gold in this section.

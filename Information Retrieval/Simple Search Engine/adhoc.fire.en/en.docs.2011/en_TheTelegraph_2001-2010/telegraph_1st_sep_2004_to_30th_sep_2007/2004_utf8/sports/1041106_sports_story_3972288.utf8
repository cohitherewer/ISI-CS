The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Paul 16th man in Bengal squad

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The test of frustration with the Indian team wasn?t good for mediumpacer Shib Shankar Paul. Now that the final Test is over quick, Paul will be included as the 16 th member in the Bengal squad to play Karnataka in the Ranji Trophy Elite Group match starting at the Jadavpur University ground (Salt Lake) on Sunday. 

However, Paul will ?surely? be in the playing XI, according to a Bengal team source. 

?The Test is over, so Paul will be back Saturday,? the source told The Telegraph Friday. ?We will surely keep him in the playing XI.? 

Since the CAB has already declared the 15-member squad, that won?t be trimmed because it ?might hamper the spirit of the team. So we decided to add Paul over and above those chosen,? the source said. 

Now, according to the source, either Ranadeb Bose or Sabir Ali will have to make way for Paul. 

Anustup Majumdar, Rakesh Krishnan, Dilip Yadav and Ritam Kundu look almost certain to sit out the opening tie.

 Severriano may strike 

 HONKY DORY 

 Severriano is strongly fancied to lift the 1,800m Shree Shankarrao Wakalkar Memorial Trophy at the Pune races on Saturday. In his last run, the Jaggy Dhariwal-trained four-year-old was a good third against a formidable opposition. Rupesh partners the well-bred son of Placerville and Condon Bleu.

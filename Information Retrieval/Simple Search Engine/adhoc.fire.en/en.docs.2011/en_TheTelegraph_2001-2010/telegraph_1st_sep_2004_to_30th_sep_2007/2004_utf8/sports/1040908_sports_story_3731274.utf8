The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Dinesh Karthik is special: Patil

Mumbai: India A coach Sandeep Patil said he was pleased with the teams performance on its recent tour of Zimbabwe and Kenya and also delighted that the national selectors kept a close watch on the players performance. 

The former India batsman was also highly impressed with the glovework and batting talent possessed by Dinesh Karthik on the first leg of the twin tour. 

Dinesh is my sort of a man. Hes a special talent. His glovework is very clean and hes a tremendous batsman, Patil said on Tuesday. 

I sincerely hope hes given the same number of chances that Parthiv Patel got, he added. Bihars Mahendra Singh Dhoni, was also very impressive, said Patil, adding it was great to see two equally gifted wicket-keepers. (PTI)

 England posted an emphatic 161-run 

 win over Zimbabwe in the second ODI in Harare on Wednesday. 

 Zimbabwe were dismissed for 102 in 36 overs. Wharf took 

 4/24.

 Harare: A record stand 

 between Kevin Pietersen and Geraint Jones lifted England 

 to a decent total of 263 for six in the second one-day International 

 against Zimbabwe on Wednesday. 

Pietersen, playing only his second one-day International, scored an unbeaten 77 off 76 balls, while Jones clubbed 66 off 46 deliveries to rescue the touring side from a shaky 121 for five. 

Pietersen and Jones shared an England record sixth-wicket stand of 120 off 82 balls, beating the 112 between Neil Fairbrother and Adam Hollioake against South Africa in 1998-99. 

Fast bowlers Tinashe Panyangara and Christopher Mpofu used early life in the pitch to keep the England top order under pressure. The pair conceded only 50 runs from the first 14 overs of the innings, removing Ian Bell (5) and Michael Vaughan (11). 

Zimbabwe?s three off-spinners, among them former rebel player Gavin Ewing, claimed the next three wickets to fall. 

Prosper Utseya had Vikram Solanki stumped down the legside for 42 by wicketkeeper Tatenda Taibu to end a third-wicket stand of 63 with Andrew Strauss. 

Strauss gave himself room to cut a delivery from Ewing and was bowled for 33. 

Paul Collingwood prodded at legside delivery from Stuart Matsikenyeri to be caught behind by Taibu for seven. 

Pietersen and Jones, however, hammered the ball to all parts of the ground for the next 13 overs with booming drives and meaty pulls. 

Their partnership ended in the 48th over when Jones holed out to Hamilton Masakadza at deep mid-wicket off Panyangara, who finished with figures of three for 61.

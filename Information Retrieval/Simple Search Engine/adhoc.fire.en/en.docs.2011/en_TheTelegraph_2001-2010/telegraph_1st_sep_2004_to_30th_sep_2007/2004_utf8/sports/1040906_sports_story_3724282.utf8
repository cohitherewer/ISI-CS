Its not easy to stay ahead of the game

Champion Speak

John McEnroe

The idea of more than a year going by without either 

of the Williams sisters winning a Slam would have been inconceivable a couple 

of years ago. It is indicative of how much they have fallen or how much others 

have caught up that even with them now both back from injury this US Open still 

looks wide open and we havent been able to say that in a long while. Its not 

easy to stay ahead of the game. Im not suggesting what happened to me is what 

has happened to them but the scenario looks familiar. 

Its only natural that they will have wanted to enjoy 

the fruits of their labours, but in this game you have to work harder just to 

stand still. I remember I made the mistake of thinking I was a cut above the other 

players and instead of continuing to work at my game I sort of said, Well, lets 

wait and see what the others do.

Like the Williamses, I had six months off from tennis, 

in my case in order to spend more time with my first-born son. But when I came 

back and after all six months isnt that long things had changed. Maybe I 

inspired them to work harder, guys like Ivan Lendl. 

All of a sudden they won a couple of big matches and 

the aura which I thought I had started to fade and with it my confidence. The 

way in which young Maria Sharapova attacked Serena Williams in the Wimbledon final 

this summer was a classic example of that. 

No doubt the Williamses will point at injuries as 

the reason for their temporary decline and maybe theyre right. Maybe, too, theyve 

been distracted and the reason for the injuries is that they havent worked quite 

as hard as they used to. Who knows. 

Unlike Serena, Venus doesnt look quite as physically 

imposing as she used to. Its difficult to put your finger on what has been wrong 

with her game. Maybe they were both over-tennised. One thing is certain: they 

are great for the game, Serena in particular with all her outfits. 

The latest one, with the knee-length boots, takes 

me back to the time of my old friend Vitas Gerulitis and Studio 54, which was 

the night-club of the time. I would go there occasionally with Vitas and they 

would roll out the red carpet for him, but I could never seem to get in without 

him, despite my protestations that I was No. 5 in the world. 

It was like Get out of here. I thought, God, this 

is an incentive to get better, five in the world isnt good enough, I need to 

be one or two. Im sure Serena doesnt have those kind of problems, but people 

will look to knock her down if she doesnt back up the fashion and the photo-shoots 

with her tennis. Its an unforgiving, sometimes brutal, sport as I was reminded 

for the umpteenth time watching a tearful Daniela Hantuchova lose to Patty Schnyder 

on Friday. It is like being undressed in public and is about as lonely as a boxing 

match. 

At least in boxing if you freeze some guy will, more 

than likely, pop you and put you out of your misery, but in tennis there is no 

escape. But to get back to work ethics. 

Thats why I give credit to Tim Henman and my birthday 

wishes, too; hes 30 tomorrow. He continues to work hard at his game. For example 

his forehand is a much better shot these days than it ever used to be. 

But sometimes even working hard at your game and improving 

isnt enough. Lleyton Hewitt is a highly dedicated player, who looks certain to 

make the semi-finals after the defeat on Friday of both David Nalbandian and Sebastien 

Grosjean who were in his quarter. Im sure the Australian thinks hes a more rounded 

tennis player than he used to be and maybe he is, but he still isnt playing with 

the same confidence as he was when he was winning Wimbledon and the Open a few 

years ago.

Someone who clearly is, is his prospective semi-final 

opponent Andy Roddick, who blasted the excellent young Spaniard Rafael Nadal out 

of his path in straight sets late on Friday. 

It was even too much for last years finalist Juan 

Carlos Ferrero on Friday Ive never seen him get so mad but Roddick, the reigning 

champion, is positively energised by it. Ive seen nothing so far to dissuade 

me from the view that he will win it again this year. 

If only all the Americans could thrive on it in similar 

fashion. After hitting a new low at the French Open, when no American man advanced 

to the third round, US mens tennis took another definite turn for the worse with 

just two survivors Roddick and Andre Agassi. 

This is the worst showing by the host nation in Open 

history. I had hoped after his Olympic exploits that at least Mardy Fish would 

make a decent fist of it here but even with the enticement of an intriguing third-round 

match with Henman, the fifth set of his match against Michal Tabara, of the Czech 

Republic, was disappointing. 

Perhaps its all come too easily for Fish. Taylor 

Dents lack of progress has been more difficult to fathom. He just doesnt seem 

to pick up on what he needs to do at the crucial time. It looks like my brother 

Patrick, who is US Davis Cup captain, will have to rely on Vincent Spadea for 

their forthcoming tie. 

Hes a trier but even that wasnt enough against Austrias 

Jurgen Melzer. The worst of it is when you see a great talent like Marat Safin 

going to waste early in a Slam. The sport needs players like him because he is 

a genuine Slam contender. 

Another is the Australian Mark Philippoussis, whose 

father rang me last week to ask if there was anything I could do to help his son 

raise his game. Like Safin, for whatever reason, the big fellah just hasnt been 

able to carry on his success of last summer at Wimbledon. Sometimes, though, you 

find yourself in awe of the modern-day tennis player, particularly his power. 

Watching the young Swede Joachim Johansson hitting 

139mph serves out wide on Friday against another big hitter, the young American 

Jan-Michael Gambill, made me grateful that I play on the seniors tour these days. 

It also made me want to go out and hit a few balls myself, see if I still had 

a 110 in me. With the wind behind me.

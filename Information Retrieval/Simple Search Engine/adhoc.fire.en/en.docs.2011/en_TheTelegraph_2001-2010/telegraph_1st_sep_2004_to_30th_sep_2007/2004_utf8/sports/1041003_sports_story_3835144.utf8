The Telegraph - Calcutta

 I won?t belittle my side: Subrata

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Beto, after scoring one of his three goals, at the Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday 

Calcutta: Mohun Bagan pumped in nine goals without reply against Sri Lanka?s Renown SC on Saturday, opening up debates as to when such a C-grade foreign team had last featured in the IFA Shield. 

But Subrata Bhattacharya is not one to subscribe to the C-grade theory. ?There is a tendency to brand the opposition low-grade as soon as any Indian side beats a foreign team? I am not one to belittle my boys? efforts. 

?Maybe they put in that extra effort today and got some early goals to run out comfortable winners,? the Mohun Bagan coach observed at the post-match conference. 

He gave the Sri Lankan side the benefit of doubt. ?They are a good side? it was their first outing in Calcutta, so maybe they took time to adjust to the new conditions. They could be more effective in their next game (versus Myanmar Finance amp; Revenue FC),? Bhattacharya said. 

Did he instruct his players to pile on the goals so that Mohun Bagan could avoid a possible semi-final clash with East Bengal if it came to goal-difference settling the group-toppers? issue with the Myanmar side? 

?We always have to keep such things in mind?? 

Renown coach M.V. Fereira was not available for comment. He left the ground without attending the press conference as he was feeling unwell during the match. After the pounding his boys took, can?t really blame Fereira?s health.

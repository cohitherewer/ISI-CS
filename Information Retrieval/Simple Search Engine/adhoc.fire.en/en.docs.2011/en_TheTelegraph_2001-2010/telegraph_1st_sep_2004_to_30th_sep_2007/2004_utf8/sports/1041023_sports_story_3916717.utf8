 Vieira recovery encouraging for Arsenal

 JOHN LEY 

Patrick Vieira?s sprained ankle is responding to treatment so encouragingly that the Arsenal captain, on Tuesday virtually ruled out of Sunday?s Premiership trip to Old Trafford, has been given a healthy chance of making the game. 

Vieira was injured in a challenge with Aston Villa?s Jlloyd Samuel during last Saturday?s 3-1 win and Arsene Wenger, the Arsenal manager, had admitted that he was ?80 per cent? certain the influential midfielder would miss the game. 

Vieira was sent off in last season?s controversial goalless draw in Manchester, but was left behind when Arsenal went to Athens in the European Champions League this week. While Wenger?s team was being held to a 2-2 draw by Panathinaikos, Vieira was improving and has now been given a 50-50 chance of leading his team out at Old Trafford. 

It would be a massive boost for Arsenal, particularly if Edu, his replacement in Greece, fails to recover from an injury sustained there. However, Thierry Henry, who was also injured in the lively draw, is expecting to be fit to face United. 

He said: ?I twisted my ankle in the first half. At first, I thought it was going to be worse, but I?m fine.? 

On the Old Trafford meeting, Henry added: ?Everyone is now talking about this game and we know it will be special. We will just try to go out there and take what we can take. If it?s a draw, it?s a draw. 

?I respect Manchester United a lot. All the time, people try to write them off, but at the end of the season, they?re always around.?

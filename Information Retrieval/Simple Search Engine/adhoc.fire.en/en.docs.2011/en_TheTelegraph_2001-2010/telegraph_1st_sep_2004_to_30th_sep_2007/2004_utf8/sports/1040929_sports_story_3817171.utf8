Singapore: India?s Anju Bobby George ? the centre of attraction at the inaugural Asian All-Stars athletics championships ? was in a ?holiday mood? Tuesday, even as she easily won the women?s long jump. Mediocre performances dominated the one-day event that lacked many of the region?s best athletes. 

Anju, who won bronze at the 2003 world championships in Paris and Asian Games gold a year earlier, easily took the gold here with a leap of 6.66 m from Kazakhstan?s Yelena Kochsheyeva who recorded 6.41m. In third place was Filipino Marestella Torres. 

Another Indian success was Hari Shankar Roy of Bengal, who claimed the silver in the men?s high jump. 

He topped a personal best 2.25m, as good as the gold winner, but lost out in the tie-breaker. Roy?s best before this was a 2.2m at the state meet in Calcutta, but that was not ratified as a national record because no national body technical delegates were present. He later set a national record of 2.18m, hence this Singapore meet height should be the new national record, if ratified. 

Anju said: ?Next year, I?m looking for something big,? referring to the Helsinki World Championships. ?Here, I was just in a holiday mood.? 

Anju finished sixth at the Athens Olympics, and claimed her allergy to dust affected her performance in the Greek capital. 

Kazakhstan?s Gennadiy Chernovol and China?s Ni Xiaoli won the men?s and women?s 100m sprints. Other winners included China?s Wu Tao in the men?s discus, Yevgeny Melashenko of Kazakhstan in the men?s 400m hurdles and Kyrgyzstans Tatiano Borisova in the women?s 1,500m. Anju stood out in an event sadly lacking big names and record times or distances. 

Asia?s Olympic champions ? 110m hurdler Liu Xiang from China, hammer thrower Koji Murofushi from Japan and compatriot Mizuki Noguchi (women?s marathon) ?made guest appearances at the event but did not compete and neither were the events scheduled. 

?The event was patterned after the Grand Prix events in Europe. But if Asian athletes went to Europe, many of them would not stand a chance,? said Asian Athletics Association secretary Maurice Nicholas. 

?What you have instead is close competition here,? he said

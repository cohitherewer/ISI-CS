 Ronaldo fit, raring to go

Rio de Janeiro: Recovering from a leg injury, Ronaldo ran, dribbled, shot and proclaimed himself fit to face Venezuela in a World Cup qualifier on Saturday. 

The announcement came as a relief for Brazilians, who watched anxiously as the Real Madrid striker missed practice this week to treat an injury to his right thigh. 

Ronaldo laid doubts to rest in the team?s final practice in Brazil on Thursday. ?I?m completely recovered. I?ll be at 100 per cent on Saturday,? he said in the mountain city of Teresopolis, near Rio. 

Ronaldo didn?t score in the intra-squad scrimmage, which ended 3-3. The standout performer was FC Porto striker Luis Fabiano, who netted all three goals for the reserve team. 

But Ronaldo?s good showing lifted team spirits. ?I didn?t avoid any movement. I felt no pain,? he said. ?This removes any doubts.? (Agencies)

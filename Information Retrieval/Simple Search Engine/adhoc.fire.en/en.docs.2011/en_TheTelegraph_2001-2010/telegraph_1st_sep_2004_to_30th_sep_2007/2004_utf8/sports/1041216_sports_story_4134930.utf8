Yokohama: Oliver Kahn will be determined to exorcise his World Cup demons on Thursday when Germany take on Japan in the first leg of their three-match Asian tour. 

A mistake by the Bayern Munich goalkeeper in the 2002 World Cup final in Yokohama led to Brazil?s first goal in a 2-0 win over Germany. 

Kahn?s return to the International Stadium will give the 35-year-old the opportunity to shrug aside the disappointment he felt two years ago. 

?Returning here is very positive,? Kahn told reporters on Wednesday. ?Perhaps it will help us get over what happened to us. 

?I?ve tried to hold on to the positive memories from the World Cup but once I walk into the stadium it will all come flooding back, the disappointment too.? 

Germany play South Korea in a repeat of their 2002 World Cup semi-final in Busan on Sunday before meeting Thailand in Bangkok on December 21. 

Kahn?s performances for club and country have come under increasing scrutiny and he is no longer an automatic choice since Juergen Klinsmann became Germany coach in July. 

However, the goalkeeper called for an end to the long-simmering row over whether he or Arsenal?s Jens Lehmann, who did not make the trip to Asia, should be Germany?s No. 1. 

?When you read the German tabloid papers, you can only assume that there?s some sort of smear campaign,? said Kahn. ?You have to let it go and respect each other.? 

Klinsmann, who has brought a relatively inexperienced squad to Asia, backed Kahn to prove himself in the absence of Lehmann. 

?People have been trying to point out whenever he makes a mistake but for me he has been solid,? said Klinsmann, who won the 1990 World Cup and Euro 96 as a player. Kahn and Lehmann are fighting for the position so naturally they will make the odd mistake.?

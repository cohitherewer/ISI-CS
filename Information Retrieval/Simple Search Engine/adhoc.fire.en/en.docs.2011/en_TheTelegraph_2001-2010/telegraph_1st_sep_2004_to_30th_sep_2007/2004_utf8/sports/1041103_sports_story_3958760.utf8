The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Woolmer warning to Pak batsmen

 - ?The players need to be disciplined and stick to the game plan? 

Karachi: Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer has warned his batsmen that they will have to be mentally tough to combat the likes Glenn McGrath and Jason Gillespie later this month. 

?This Pakistan side has a lot of talent. But there are certain measures needed for an Australian tour which is always tough for a visiting side,? the Briton said before returning home on Monday. 

He will join the Pakistan team before their one-day International against India in Calcutta on November 13. 

Pakistan travel to Australia this month to play three Tests and the VB one-day triangular series, with West Indies being the third team. 

Pakistan have never won a Test series in Australia despite managing single Test wins in 1977, 1979-80, 1981 and 1995. 

?Australia have been dominating world cricket for a long time now and they have been unbeatable at home. The way Gillespie has been hitting the stumps in India is admirable,? Woolmer said. ?To stand up to them, the batsmen will have to learn the art of leaving the ball on bouncy wickets there. Something that the New Zealanders have managed well against in recent times,? he added. 

Pakistan drew the two-Test series 1-1 against Sri Lanka on Monday, but lost the final of the triangular one-day series to the island nation ? which had Zimbabwe as the third team ? in Lahore. 

?To win in Australia, a touring side has to be very disciplined in many areas of the game and stick to the game plan. We are working on it,? said Woolmer. Admitting that Pakistan are yet to find a suitable opening pair, he said the team?s strength however, lies in the bowling attack. 

?In the absence of Shoaib Akhtar, Mohammed Sami and Shabbir Ahmed in the second Test against Sri Lanka, the back-up bowlers did a magnificent job. This is a plus for us.? 

Captain Inzamam-ul Haq said confidence would be the key to doing well against the world champions. 

?If you go to Australia with a couple of victories under your belt it helps to adjust better to the Australian conditions. We are keen to go there with a win over India,? said Inzamam, who has travelled there four times starting with the 1992 World Cup.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 A year of Olympian highs and lows 

 - ATHENS 2004 - While the capital shone, Greece bore the financial burden 

 Anju was a big disappointment 

London: The critics, sceptics and doomsayers were left speechless by a spectacular Summer Olympics in 2004. 

The Olympic efforts of Athens crippled Greek finances but at the same time put the ancient city on the map as a modern European capital with sports facilities to match anywhere in the world. 

Its August extravaganza ? for years a cause for concern for Olympic chiefs ? proved a heartwarming success. 

Starting with a doping controversy and ending with a stripped gold medal, the Athens Games were not just a test of Olympic ability, they were also a test of the Olympian ideals. 

Before the athletics had even begun, two of its potential heroes had disappeared in a cloud of shame. The withdrawals of Greek 200 m Sydney Olympics champion Costas Kenteris and his training partner 100 m sprinter Katerina Thanou cast a shadow over the first week of the Games. 

The pair pulled out after an unseemly cat-and-mouse episode with officials after they missed a drugs test in mysterious circumstances the day before the opening ceremony. 

Prior to these Games, the last track and field gold medallist to have been stripped of glory was 100 m sprinter Ben Johnson in Seoul in 1988. Never before had two track and field golds been taken away. 

In Athens, the count was three ? Irina Korzhanenko?s shot put gold for testing for stanozolol, the crude steroid Johnson had used 16 years earlier, and the gold medals of Hungarian discus thrower Robert Fazekas and compatriot hammer thrower Adrian Annus for refusing to give urine samples. 

Despite recording more than double the previous number of doping violations at a Summer Games, the Athens Olympics proved a roaring success everywhere except on the balance sheet. 

The total cost of the Games shot up to more than 8 billion euros from an initial estimate of 3.5 billion. 

[For Indians, it was a rather sad mix of the first ever individual silver ? from Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore in the men?s double trap shooting ? and some incredible sub-par performances, not to mention the doping scandal that hit the women weightlifters, adds a Staff Reporter in Calcutta. 

[Kunjurani Devi, Pratima Kumari and even the seemingly innocent Sanamacha Chanu were thrown out of the Olympic arena and banned for having tested positive for banned substances. 

[If that wasn?t enough shame, Sydney Games bronze medallist weightlifter Karnam Malleswari didn?t as much as even try to lift her weight before giving up with a ?back pain? that she hardly had even in the morning of the competitions. There was also this weird instance of national champion and record-holder shot-putter Bahadur Singh who fouled all his throws at the ancient stadium because, as he said, the surface was ?slippery!? 

[Then came the utter disappointment of the best medal prospect of the country, long jumper Anju Bobby George. On her first jump she did her personal best, and instead of improving thereafter, kept going downhill with every progressing jump. The Athens air was ?polluted,? she explained. 

[All the while, though, the Indian officials were wining and dining at plush Indian restaurants in the ancient Games city.]

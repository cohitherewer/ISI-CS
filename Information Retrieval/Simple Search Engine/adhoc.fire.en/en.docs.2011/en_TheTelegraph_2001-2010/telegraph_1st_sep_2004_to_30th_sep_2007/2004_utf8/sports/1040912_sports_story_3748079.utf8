Southampton: Team India showed signs of rediscovering their form as they launched their Champions Trophy campaign with a resounding 98-run win over Kenya in a Pool C match here on Saturday. 

Indian batsmen shrugged off their indifferent form to rattle up an imposing 290 for four before restricting Kenya to 192 for seven at the Rose Bowl to claim two points. 

Skipper Sourav Ganguly led from the front once again with a fine 90, and along with V.V.S. Laxman (79), provided the foundation with a 161-run second wicket stand. 

Mohammed Kaif then took centrestage with a swashbuckling 49 in the slog overs to propel India to 290, the last 10 overs yielding 90 runs. Kaif found an able ally in Rahul Dravid, who produced a breezy 30 off 16 balls aided by three fours and a six. 

Indians were brilliant in the field. Kaif, the live-wire shone once again, running out opener Kennedy Otieno. Harbhajan Singh is looking better and better with each match since his return from injury. He grabbed three for 33 on Saturday. 

But Sourav might be concerned that they could not bowl out the African team. India also gave away 44 runs via extras, including 19 wides and 12 byes. 

Maurice Ouma top-scored with 49 and with Brijal Patel, unbeaten on 38, added 93 runs for the seventh wicket. 

Sourav Ganguly hit a well-paced 90 off 124 balls aided by eight fours. Laxman, who had collided with Sourav mid-pitch to run out his captain in the NatWest challenge one-dayer against England prior to the series, played a perfect foil as he made 79 off 99 balls and hit eight fours. 

The Indian total, however, owed much to the whirlwind knocks of Kaif and Dravid. After Laxman fell while trying to improvise and Yuvraj Singh (9) had gone cheaply, Kaif and Dravid stitched 77 runs in less than seven overs to lift India from 213 for four in the 43rd over to the final scoreline. 

Missing out on the party was Virender Sehwag (17) who was bowled by Thomas Odoyo after playing all over the delivery. 

Indians came to the game with enough batting worries and it showed when only seven runs came from the first five overs as the batsmen tried to come to terms with the pitch and their own form.

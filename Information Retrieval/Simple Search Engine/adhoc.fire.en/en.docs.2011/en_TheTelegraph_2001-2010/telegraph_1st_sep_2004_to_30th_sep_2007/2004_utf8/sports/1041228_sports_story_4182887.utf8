The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Pal banned for two months

A CORRESPONDENT

 Bagan will appeal Pal?s suspension 

 New Delhi: Mohun Bagan 

 goalkeeper Subrata Pal can breathe easy at last. He has 

 been suspended for just two months ? from the first day 

 of 2005 till the end of February. 

Announcing this here on Monday, Hardev Jadeja, chairman of All India Football Federation (AIFF) disciplinary committee said Pal needs to be disciplined following impulsive and aggresive behaviour in Durand and Federation Cup finals. 

The decision should come as a relief for the youngster who has been exonerated of all charges following Cristiano Junior?s death in the Federation Cup final in Bangalore. 

However, according to Pal?s lawyer Sushil Salwan, the green-and-maroon club will file an appeal against the decision on Wednesday. 

They will be challenging the time span of the two-month suspension. Salwan said that Pal should have been banned from December 6 to February 6, and not from January 1 to February 28, 2005. 

Salwan felt the suspension was due to Pal?s aggressive behaviour, for which he should have been penalised on the field and not by a disciplinary committee. He also observed that Pal?s past behaviour was not within the jurisdiction of this committee. 

The club will be filing another appeal to let Pal play in the matches proposed between Mohun Bagan and East Bengal and the former versus Dempo, which have been earmarked as a tribute to Junior. 

Despite happy that Pal was not held responsible for Junior?s death, green-maroon officials felt the suspension was a bit too harsh and was based solely on his past conduct. 

Doubts were also cast on the validity of the AIFF?s disciplinary committee. According to Fifa rules, such a commitee should be chaired by a practising lawyer. The current chairman has completed his LLB degree but is not a practising lawyer. 

The disciplinary committee comprised off chairman Jadeja, vice-chairman Nasir Ahmed Khan, former Fifa referee L.R. Natarajan and Rajeev Bakshi of Chandigarh. Mohan Raj of Karnataka could not attend due to poor health. 

The AIFF president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi briefly attended the meeting. 

Jadeja later said, ?We viewed the footage several times from many angles and cross-examined Subrata Pal and his lawyer before arriving at a decision.? 

The chairman added the decision was unanimous. ?Pal is not guilty of Junior?s death and should not be blamed for the incident. But his off-the-ball challenge was not in the true spirit of the game and could be construed as violent conduct. 

 ?But, considering his age, we did not give him a longer 

 suspension,? Jadeja added.

 Azhar backs three-spinner strategy

Patna: Describing as a ?right decision? the strategy of playing with three spinners in the first Test against South Africa in Kanpur, former Indian skipper Mohammed Azharuddin said, ?India remain heavily dependent on spinners, and based on this theory, have performed miracles in the past. 

?Moreover, Murali Kartik and Anil Kumble are performing well,? he told a press conference here on Saturday after an inter-school cricket tournament. 

Azharuddin also feels that India should play aggressively against South Africa to get back on the winning track in the two-Test series. 

?Play aggressively instead of performing under pressure. We have the talent and I am sure India will win the matches,? he said.

Calcutta: Former Indian cricket team trainer Andrew Kokinos blames the system for the growing number of injuries among the Indian players. ?The system in Australia is completely different and so the Australians are much fitter than the Indians,? Kokinos said during an hour?s visit to Jadavpur University ground in Salt Lake on Friday. 

Kokinos spelt out changes required in the system, stating that they need to come into immediate effect to put a check on the number of injuries. ?In Australia, we train the boys from the age of 14-15, and by the time he comes into the fray, his body is ready to take the pressure of international cricket, which unfortunately is not the case for the Indians,? he stated. 

According to the Australian trainer, mostly the fast bowlers are getting injured as it is an imposing task and not that easy for a good athlete also to put so much effort without risking injury to his body. ?For this reason, in Australia, we hold proper training classes for the young ones to make them aware of the modern day fitness.? 

Kokinos, who joined the Indian team in early 1998 and was there with the team till the 1999 World Cup, rated Robin Singh as the fittest cricketer seen by him in this sub-continent. ?Mohammed Azharuddin was equally good, while the likes of Jawagal Srinath, Anil Kumble and few others were also very fit,? the trainer remarked. 

The Australian, who was India?s first overseas trainer, will be going to Mumbai to witness the fourth and last Test match between India and Australia starting on Wednesday. ?I have been invited by Raj Singh Dungarpur on behalf of the Cricket Club of India (CCI) and so I will definitely watch the guys with whom I had a stint for more than a year,? Kokinos informed. 

But the trainer, who was roped in at the recommendation of the then consultant Bobby Simpson, haven?t seen either of the two trainers India have recruited after his departure. He doesn?t even know their training schedules. 

Kokinos, who is in India with the Guild Cricket Club of Australia on a tour, where they will play some matches in different parts of the country, said he is open to any offer from the BCCI. ?If any such offer comes I will think over it,? he signed off.

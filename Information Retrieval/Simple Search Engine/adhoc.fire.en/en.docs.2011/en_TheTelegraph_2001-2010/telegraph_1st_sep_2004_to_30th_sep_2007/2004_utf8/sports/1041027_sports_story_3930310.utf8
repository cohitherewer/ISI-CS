The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Decision on Rach fate early next week

SUJIT BHAR

 Rach will be in India within a few days 

Calcutta: Wednesday, in Chandigarh, India start preparations for yet another adventure, this time the premium Champions Trophy hockey meet to be held in Lahore. The invitation to the meet ? falling into Indian hands like manna from heaven ? is likely not only to spot youngsters who can become staple in the national squad, but also settle the coach issue once and for all. 

The national camp starts with the 18 who were in the India-Pakistan Test series. More will be added as soon as the juniors return from their Australia ?Test? tour. The campers will now report to Dr Sidhu, joint director in the department of sports there. 

Chief coach Gerhard Rach will be in within a week, while assistant coach Jagbir Singh is expected to move in Tuesday itself. 

The physical trainer takes charge in the first week, before training commences. 

The Indian juniors were whipped 1-6 by their Australian counterparts in Perth on Sunday, but Tuesday morning the youngsters paid it back with a 3-2 victory in the second Test. 

Skipper Nitin Kumar, Virender Lakra and Jatinder Pal Singh scored for India. The next match is on Friday. 

The camp apart, a spokesman of the Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) told The Telegraph over phone, the more important work pending will be taken up when IHF president K.P.S. Gill returns from a work trip. The executives will sit around a table and decide on the contract details of Rach early next week. 

This has been hanging fire, and though a source says it is expected that it will again be till the end of the Champions Trophy only, there is a school of thought pressing for longer terms. 

If the second opinion is heard, Rach just might have to make way for a more reputed coach immediately after the Lahore meet. This is also looking ahead to the Chennai Champions Trophy the year after. 

Rach will be in India ?in a few days? time? as IHF secretary K. Jyothikumaran put it.

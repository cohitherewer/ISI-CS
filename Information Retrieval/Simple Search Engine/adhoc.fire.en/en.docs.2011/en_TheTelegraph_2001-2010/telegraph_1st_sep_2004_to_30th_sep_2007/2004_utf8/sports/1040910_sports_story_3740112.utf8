The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Hari, Sandipan share 2nd spot

Pune: P. Harikrishna overpowered top seed GM Liviu-Dieter Nisipeanu of Romania in the sixth round of the category-16 Super GMs meet to move within striking distance of the title on Thursday. 

While Harikrishna made merry, GM Krishnan Sasikiran ? the top rated Indian in the fray ? was stunned by Alexander Beliavsky. 

Sandipan Chanda gave Rustam Kasimdzhanov a tough time before they decided to split points. The other game of the day was also drawn with tail-enders Abhijit Kunte and Surya Shekhar Ganguly signing peace. Former world junior champion Emil Sutovsky of Israel too suffered a shock defeat to Zurab Azmaiparashvili of Georgia. 

With just three rounds to go, Nisipeanu and Kazimdzhanov led with four points with Harikrishna and Sandipan close on their heels on 3.5. Another half-a-point adrift are Beliavsky, Sutovsky and Azmaiparashvili, while Sasikiran remained on 2.5. On the drop zone are Surya Sekhar Ganguly on 2 points and Kunte half point behind him. 

Playing white, Harikrishna had his sights trained for the maximum and turned down a draw offer from Nisipeanu on the 11th move. By the 20th move, the die was decisively cast in the Indian?s favour and when Nisipeanu failed to capitalise on a relatively simple repetition on the 28th turn, it was virtually over for the Israeli. 

Sasikiran had only himself to blame for the disaster against Beliavsky. After nearly outplaying his experienced rival in all departments, Sasikiran failed to spot some effective winning plans after netting the bishop pair against a rook. In the end, he went down tamely in 73 moves.

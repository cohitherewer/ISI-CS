The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Juggling between cricket, golf and wine

 - Former NZ captain Jeff Crowe, now a Match Referee, has shifted base to Florida 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Kanpur: Cricket, golf and wine... That?s an extraordinary mix, but former New Zealand captain and manager Jeff Crowe is quite comfortable splitting loyalties between the three. 

Jeff (elder brother of another one-time captain, Martin) is also on the Match Referees? panel. And, on this trip, he is wearing the ICC hat. His last visit to India was as New Zealand?s manager, five years ago. 

Incidentally, Jeff no longer stays in Auckland but has shifted to Florida after marrying a second time. ?I did so as my wife Lara?s roots are there,? he told The Telegraph on Wednesday evening. 

Asked about dabbling in golf and wine (besides acting as cricket consultant) Jeff said: ?I?m involved with the golf tour business and am marketing wine from Australia and New Zealand... If it?s of any interest, I play off three on the greens.? 

Jeff?s first assignment as Match Referee was in the West Indies, earlier this year, and he confessed having been tense. ?Of course, now, I?m growing into the job,? he pointed out grinning. 

Obviously, Jeff is disappointed at the manner New Zealand lost in the Brisbane Test, a few days ago, but is hopeful of a ?much better show.? That?s driven by his faith in the current captain, Stephen Fleming. 

The other night, by the way, Jeff was seen having dinner with Team India coach John Wright. ?John is the one who succeeded me and it was good catching up with him,? he remarked. 

Both, according to Jeff, now intend calling on another former captain ? Geoff Howarth ? widely regarded as New Zealand?s Mike Brearley. 

?Geoff has settled somewhere near Oxford and, at the earliest, John and I are going to meet him,? Jeff informed, ending our conversation as he had some first Test-related ?paperwork? to finish.

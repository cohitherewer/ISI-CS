 Kartik willing to wait again 

 - Wicket was interesting, says Man of Match

Mumbai: Spinners, it?s said, need to be nursed. 

Often, then, it?s a matter of faith. Rahul Dravid, for one, has plenty in left-armer 

Murali Kartik. 

In fact, on what became the last day of a four-Test series, Dravid?s first choice spinners at the Wankhede were offie Harbhajan Singh and Kartik ? seasoned Anil Kumble was forgotten till Australia were 71 for seven. 

?I was influenced by Michael Clarke?s success... Even before the innings, I?d decided to have Kartik at one end as quickly as possible,? the stand-in captain informed. 

As for the Man of the Match, he is prepared to again 

bide time... ?I know three spinners won?t always be played and I accept that... 

If needed, I?m going to wait for my turn,? Kartik told The Telegraph. 

Upbeat after his maiden MoM award, Kartik insisted he hadn?t ever bowled ?badly? except in the first innings of last season?s Sydney Test. 

Kartik?s Test debut, by the way, was here itself ? against South Africa in early 2000 ? and, so, Mumbai will always be somewhat special. 

Having been a big beneficiary of the wicket, this time, Kartik chose to toe Dravid?s line: ?It was interesting...? 

Incidentally, Harbhajan?s indisposition on the eve of the third Test (Nagpur) is what brought Kartik into the series. He made a neat impression there and, then, retained his berth when Dravid and coach John Wright opted for all three spinners. 

Some moves click, others don?t. Surely, fielding Kartik sits in the former category. Now, consistency is going to earn a promotion when the contract-placements are reviewed next season. 

At the moment, the 28-year-old Kartik is in category 

C. At the Wankhede, though, he did script an A performance.

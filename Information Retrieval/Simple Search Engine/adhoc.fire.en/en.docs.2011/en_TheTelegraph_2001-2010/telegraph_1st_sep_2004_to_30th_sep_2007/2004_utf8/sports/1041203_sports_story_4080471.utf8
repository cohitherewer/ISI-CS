The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Rudolph is off to the mountains

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: South African middle order bat Jacques Rudolph has found a novel way of putting out his series defeat blues. He plans to go to the Himalayas. There is not religious motive in this, except that he wants to be able to see for himself the great heights of the northern ranges. 

?It has always been my wish to see the Himalayas. I have read about it in the books, and I?ll be off to Darjeeling now, trying to get a glimpse of Mt Everest,? Rudolph told The Telegraph on Thursday. 

Wife Elna will accompany Rudolph on the trip to the mountains. 

?We will spend four days there and return to South Africa via Calcutta and Mumbai,? he said. 

Jacques? wife Elna, a final year medical student, is also a keen social worker. While her husband was busy at the Eden, Elna found her way to a Missionaries of Charity workplace in Calcutta, putting in two days of voluntary service (Tuesday and Thursday). 

?If opportunity comes I?ll be happy to serve at the ?home? again. I have really come to like it,? she said.

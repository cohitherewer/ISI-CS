 Dalmiya meets coach, Rohan

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Amid whispers that the team members were losing faith in Rohan Gavaskar?s captaincy, CAB president Jagmohan Dalmiya met the selectors, coach Karsan Ghavri and Rohan for over one and-a-half hours on Saturday. 

The coach and captain had to rush from the airport to attend the meeting following a delayed arrival of their flight. 

According to sources, Dalmiya stressed on the need for proper co-ordination between the team management and the selectors. He also reposed his faith in the captain. 

Rohan was repentant at the meeting and acknowledged that the performance has been at a low key.

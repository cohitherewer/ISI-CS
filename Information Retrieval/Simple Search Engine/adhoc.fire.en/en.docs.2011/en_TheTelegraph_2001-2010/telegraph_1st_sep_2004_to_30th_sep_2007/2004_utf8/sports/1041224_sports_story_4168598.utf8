 Schumacher arrogant, say fellow athletes

 Schumacher skipped awards function 

Berlin: Formula One champion Michael Schumacher drew sharp criticism from some German athletes after he skipped the weekend?s German sports awards ceremony. 

Schumacher, who was chosen the male sportsman of the year for the second time, sent a video to the nationally broadcast programme on Sunday instead of appearing in person. 

?He disrespects all of us,? said Birgit Fischer, the eight-time Olympic gold-medallist in canoeing who won the women?s award. 

Schumacher?s use of the video as a stand-in drew sharp criticism from former German soccer captain Lothar Matthaeus, ex-boxing world champion Sven Ottke and even a state governor. 

Matthaeus said, ?These awards need the presence of the winner. Schumacher owes sport a big thanks. The fans want to see him live, not on video.? 

The Bild newspaper devoted a long story to Schumacher?s absence at the event ?Is Schumi really arrogant or are the others just jealous?? was Bild?s headline. ?This has nothing to do with jealousy. It just shows a lack of respect to others,? said Ottke. 

Schumacher also had his defenders, including his manager, Willi Weber, who said the Ferrari driver had very few days open in his busy schedule to spend with his family. (AP)

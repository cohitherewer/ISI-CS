 Golf on shortlist

London: Golf has been shortlisted for the 2012 Olympics but a row could be brewing within the sport over whether to press ahead for its inclusion in the Games. 

The Royal and Ancient Club (R amp;A), which governs golf outside the US, is backing the bid but there could be opposition from the European and US PGA Tours. 

?It?s good to hear that we have been confirmed (on the shortlist),? R amp;A secretary Peter Dawson said on Thursday. ?But it?s true to say that the two Tours are less supportive than they were. ? 

Dawson stressed that there was still a long way to go before golf returned to the Games schedule. He said the matter would be discussed between the various governing bodies at an International Golf Federation meeting in Puerto Rico on October 26. (Reuters)

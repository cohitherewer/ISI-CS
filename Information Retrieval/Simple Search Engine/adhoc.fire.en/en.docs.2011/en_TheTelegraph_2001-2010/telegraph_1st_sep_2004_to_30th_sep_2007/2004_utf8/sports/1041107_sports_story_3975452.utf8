 Ashok Kumar tied at fourth spot

New Delhi: India?s Ashok Kumar carded a fine four-under 68 to be tied fourth after the third round of the inaugural $ 200,000 Carlsberg Masters golf tournament in Hanoi, Saturday. 

Ashok shared the spot with Boonchu Ruangkit of Thailand, who scored 70, according to information received here. 

Coming into the tournament with four straight Indian Tour titles under his belt, Ashok said he hoped to translate that form in his rookie year on the Asian Tour. 

?I?m shooting a lot of birdies but am dropping bogeys as well. I hope to stay clear of trouble tomorrow,? said the 23-year-old who has an aggregate of 209 (71-70-68) after the third round. 

Another Indian, Arjun Singh, was joint 18th after a third round card of two-under 70. Thai star Thongchai Jaidee fired a course record of eight-under-par 64 to stay on track for a third victory this season. (PTI)

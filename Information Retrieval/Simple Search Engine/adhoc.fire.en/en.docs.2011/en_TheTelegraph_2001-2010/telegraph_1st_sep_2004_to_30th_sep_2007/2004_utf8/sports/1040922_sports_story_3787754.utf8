 London: The shirt worn by Pele when he scored two goals as a 17-year-old for Brazil in the 1958 World Cup final against Sweden was sold at auction at Christie?s on Tuesday for ?59,000. The blue, short-sleeved, V-necked shirt with Pele?s number 10 on the back went to a telephone buyer for substantially less than the pre-sale estimate of ?70-100,000. It had been on show at a museum in Sao Paolo but was sold off to raise funds.

 In 2002, the number 10 shirt Pele wore in the 1970 World Cup final fetched ?157,750 ($283,000). 

 Rio de Janeiro: Brazil coach Carlos Alberto Parreira has praised the improvement shown by next month?s World Cup qualifying opponents Venezuela and says they can no longer be considered ?a dead chicken?. The world champions play in Maracaibo, where they won 6-0 on their last visit four years ago, on October 9 and will be defending an unbeaten record against Venezuela in full internationals. But Parreira warned on Monday that Venezuela, who have won three out of eight matches in the 2006 World Cup qualifying competition, are a vastly improved side.

 ?Without wanting to cause panic, Venezuela have improved a lot, they?re not a dead chicken any more,? he told the Brazilian Football Confederation?s official website. ?It?s no longer the Venezuela that would go on to the field, concede six or seven goals and lose easily.?

 London: Liverpool and England midfielder Steven Gerrard could be out of action for two months after suffering a suspected broken bone in his foot during his side?s 2-1 Premier League defeat at Manchester United on Monday. Gerrard went off five minutes before halftime in the match and left Old Trafford on crutches. ?There was nobody near me when Xabi Alonso gave me the ball but as I tried to turn the foot got caught in the turf and I heard something crack,? Gerrard said. ?I?ll know more in the morning when I have an X-ray and obviously I?ll be devastated if I?m out for a long time.?

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Nabi brace takes Bengal to quarters

 - Uttar Pradesh knock out Maharashtra to book last-eight berth 

 A CORRESPONDENT 

New Delhi: Two opportunistic first half goals by Syed Rahim Nabi and a Mehtab Hussain free-kick helped Bengal defeat Andhra Pradesh 3-0 in the Santosh Trophy football tournament on Wednesday. 

With this victory Bengal topped cluster I with six points and moved into group A of the quarter final league. Other teams in the group are seeded Services and surprise qualifiers Uttar Pradesh, who upset Maharashtra 2-1. 

Bengal will meet Services in their opening group A quarter final league tie on Sunday. Two days later they will take on Uttar Pradesh. The 12-team quarter final league phase of the Santosh Trophy kicks off on Thursday at the Ambedkar Stadium. Holders Manipur will miss the services of international midfielder Rennedy Singh in their opening group B match against qualifiers Karnataka. Rennedy has a thigh strain and is doubtful for the tournament. 

Bengal coach Syed Nayeemuddin?s experimental midfield quartert (without injured Chandan Das and Noel Wilson) clicked on the day. Nineteen year-old Sankha Roy Chowdhury took a heavy load as central midfielder. 

But the biggest gain was the assured tackling and support play of Habibur Rehman Mondal in the unusual position of left half. 

Nayeem expressed satisfaction with Habibur?s tackling and positional play and said ?we can use him in midfield in the quarters.? 

Basudeb Mondal, meanwhile, was his usual best, orchestrating the moves down the middle, while Mehtab provided thrust and penetration from the right. 

The opening goal came in the second minute. Basudeb found Dipendu Biswas with some space and the Bengal skipper sent a deft through pass to Nabi. 

Outpacing the rival central defenders, Nabi placed home from close. 

Despite such an exhilarating start, Bengal went slightly off the boil. Goalkeeper Abhijit Mondal had to come to Bengal?s rescue, as he twice dived to foil strikers Mohammed Qizer and Ayaz Abdul Haq. 

Just before the breather, the tireless Mehtab surged past his marker and sent in a low cross. Nabi darting in at the first post converted with a first time flick. 

Nayeem chose to rest Habibur in the second half and Vimal Periyar was introduced in attack. Dipendu played deep in midfield while young Periyar and Nabi combined well upfront. 

In the 84th minute Periyar was fouled outside the penalty box. Mehtab found the net with a superbly executed curling free kick, which left goalkeeper Omer Khan rooted to the spot. 

Nayeem hopes that the arrival of Kalyan Chowbey and Debjit Ghosh on Sunday will further bolster the squad. He thinks the team is getting more cohesive, and with more concentration in defence, can go far in the tournament. 

The biggest upset of the day was the defeat of 2000 champions Maharashtra. In a cluster IV match, Uttar Pradesh, despite being plagued by factionalism in their local association, upset Bimal Ghosh trained Maharashtra 2-1. 

Former East Bengal player Prahlad Rawat scored a brace in the 33rd and 47th minutes. For Maharasthra, international midfielder Khalid Jameel reduced the margin from a penalty in the 88th minute. 

Meanwhile, Tamil Nadu, despite being held to a 1-1 draw by spirited Jammu and Kashmir in cluster VIII, qualified with four points. 

Tamil Nadu join Punjab and Goa in group D of the quarter final league.

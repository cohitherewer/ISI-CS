 Success in India will be the pinnacle: Justin Langer

 Langer 

Mumbai: Echoing the views of retired captain Steve Waugh, Australian opener Justin Langer said beating India in India in a Test series would signify the pinnacle in the careers of Australian players. 

?It is a challenge we have set for ourselves ? to beat India ? who are a very good side. They (India) have got some great players. To beat India in India will be the pinnacle of our careers,? Langer said here on Friday on his arrival from Australia via Singapore. 

Langer flew in along with teammate Nathan Hauritz and chairman of the Australian selection panel, Trevor Hohns. Ace leg-spinner Shane Warne and his understudy Cameron White, who were supposed to arrive with them, missed the connecting flight at Singapore and are scheduled to reach late on Friday. The main tour party, led by wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist, is scheduled to arrive from England early on Saturday. 

Langer, who tasted moderate success when the team led by Waugh visited and lost the Test series to hosts India 1-2 in 2001, said he loved to visit the country and taste its different culture. 

?I love India. Although I had good success against India in Australia (in 2003-04), my last tour to India was only reasonably moderate,? the left-handed batsman said. 

Langer scored only 161 runs, batting mainly one down, at a modest average of 32.20 in the 2001 series which India lost by an innings at Mumbai and then turned the rubber around on its head winning the second and third Test in Calcutta and Chennai respectively. 

Since that historic visit, the 33-year-old Langer has forged a great combination with Matthew Hayden, after the exit of Michael Slater, at the top of the Australian Test order. 

?It?s (series win in India) something we are keen to achieve. It?s probably the only thing the current team has not been able to do. They have beaten India in India in one day cricket, but have not beaten India in a Test series.

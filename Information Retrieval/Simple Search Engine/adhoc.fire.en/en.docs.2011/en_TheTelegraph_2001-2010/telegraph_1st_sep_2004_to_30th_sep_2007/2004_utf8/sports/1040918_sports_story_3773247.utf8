The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Ashok set for title

 A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Indifferent weather notwithstanding, Ashok Kumar continued the great form he showed in his course record breaking second round to open a five-shot lead over Mukesh Kumar in the third round of The Hindu Open, at the Cosmo-TNGF Golf course, Chennai on Friday. 

The Delhi-based pro, with a 54-hole aggregate of 15 under-201, is all set to win the third leg of the Amby Valley PGAI Tour. Mukesh submitted a card of 3-under 69 to trail Ashok by five strokes, according to information received here. 

Veteran Vijay Kumar shot a brilliant 67 to share the third spot with Basad Ali, while day one leader Ranjit Singh returned a second best card of four-under 68 to remain fourth at an aggregate of 209. 

Ashok Kumar, the 2003-04 Order of Merit winner, opened the day with a two-stroke lead over Bangalore based pro, Rahul Ganapathy. With birdies on the first, second, fifth and sixth holes, Ashok quickly took his tally to 14-under. He birdied the par-4 tenth where the blind tee-shot proved too much for the rest of the field, before making two careless bogeys on the 11th and 14th. On both occasions his putter let him down. 

Meanwhile, L. Selvadurai continued to lead the amateur field at 229. 

The other two amateurs who made the cut, R. Prithviraj and V. Darshan were at 240 and 243 respectively.

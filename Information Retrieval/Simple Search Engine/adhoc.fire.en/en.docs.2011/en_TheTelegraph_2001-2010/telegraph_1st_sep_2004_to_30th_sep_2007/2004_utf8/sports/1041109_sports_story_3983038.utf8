Paula Radcliffe?s response to those who doubted her ability to bounce back from her Olympic disasters could not have been more emphatic on Sunday when she triumphed in a thrilling New York Marathon. [Hendrik Ramaala became the second South African to win the men?s race in 2::09:28.] 

In the closest finish seen in the race?s 35-year history Radcliffe outsprinted Susan Chepkemei in the last 200 metres to cross the line in 2hr23min 10sec. Chepkemei, who finished behind Radcliffe in the London Marathons of 2002 and 2003, had always been among the leading pack. 

Chepkemei tracked Radcliffe?s every move for the final five miles, but after their stride for stride struggle through the Bronx and Upper Manhattan, it was the 29 year-old Kenyan who had to accept second best. 

Radcliffe?s margin of victory was four seconds while the rest of the field, who had promised to give the Briton a bigger test, were more than two minutes adrift, blown away by a pace that was, at times, more than half a minute inside the course record. It was only in the closing stages that the pace slowed and both Radcliffe and Chepkemei tried to break each other with surges through Lower Manhattan, Harlem and finally on the rising gradient of Fifth Avenue. 

With both athletes running stride for stride and grimacing with their efforts, Radcliffe?s stumble as she turned into Central Park might have proved costly. But she recovered to produce the decisive change of pace and become the fourth Briton, after Priscilla Welch in 1987, Steve Jones in 1988 and Liz McColgan in 1991, to win in the Big Apple. 

Radcliffe said: ?The quality of the field and the nature of the course meant that it was always going to be a competitive race. I struggled with a stomach upset at 23 miles, but I was pretty determined and always confident that I could outsprint Susan.? 

In a year when the most important race to win was in Athens, this was very much the second prize, but victory means that Radcliffe can at last consign to history her failures to finish the Olympic marathon and 10,000m. The time was the slowest of all Radcliffe?s four completed marathons, but was also rendered irrelevant by the manner of the win. This was the sort of duel she had only faced in cross-country events. 

It was dramatic and hugely impressive, but Radcliffe, who celebrates her 31st birthday next month, refused to talk of having redeemed herself. She said: ?It was really important to win here in New York. It?s very difficult to make up for what happened in Athens, but it happened and it?s over. This was about moving on. The time didn?t matter. What mattered was running well, enjoying the race and winning. Coming here wasn?t about proving a point. I just wanted to get back to what I do best and it was great to be part of race like that.? 

Victory here earned Radcliffe more than ?75,000 in prize money and bonuses, on top of the ?270,000 she was paid just to take part and a new car.

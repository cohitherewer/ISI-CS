London: Chelsea booked their place in the League Cup semi-finals with a late 2-1 win at Fulham and were joined by unfancied Watford after the second division side trounced Premier League Portsmouth 3-0 on Tuesday. 

Chelsea, who thrashed Fulham 4-1 just over two weeks ago, needed an 88th minute winner from substitute Frank Lampard to scrape victory on their return to Craven Cottage. The Premier League leaders went ahead in the 55th minute with a deflected shot from Ireland winger Damien Duff, only for American striker Brian McBride to level in the 74th. 

Watford, who thrashed Southampton 5-2 in the fourth round, claimed another top flight victim with two goals from Icelandic striker Heidar Helguson and one from Bruce Dyer. 

Fulham made much the better start, though, and striker Andy Cole was among those missing chances. They paid the price when Duff?s shot from the edge of the area took a deflection off defender Ian Pearce and beat goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar. 

McBride equalised when Elvis Hammond provided a low cross just a minute after replacing Cole and the American forward steered home for Chris Coleman?s side. Lampard settled the tie with a shot from outside the area that cannoned off Van der Sar into the roof of the net.

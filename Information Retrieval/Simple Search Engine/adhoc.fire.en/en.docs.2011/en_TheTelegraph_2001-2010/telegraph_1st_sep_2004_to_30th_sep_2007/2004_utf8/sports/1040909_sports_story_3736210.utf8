Calcutta: Both the coaches were ?satisfied?, none ecstatic. One because the victory margin was lesser than Saitama, the other because his boys had put up a fight. One was already planning out his campaign for the 2006 World Cup, the other was planning for the 2006 Asian Games. 

Japan?s Brazilian coach Zico admitted: ?Our main aim was to get full points. In fact, we faced many difficulties in the first half. But the second half was easy and now that we are leading in our group, our planning for the future has become easier.? 

The Indian coach Stephen Constantine was waxing eloquent about how his players had ?proved the point?. ?We showed the whole world that we can play football. Yes we gave away poor goals? but our performance here has been much better than in Saitama? But there was nothing we could do, their players are always one or two levels above us.? 

After all they are the best team in Asia and ?the real question was when they would score.? 

The first half did see some Indian resistance and the great Brazilian was the first to acknowledge that, ?In the first half, the Indian marking was good. They also created some opportunities. But sadly, they lost momentum after the second goal and there was no coming back.? 

Though the concept of a draw may never have come in Zico?s mind, he admitted ?if it would have happened today, we would have taken it in the right spirit.? 

Constantine lamented the absence of his star striker Bhaichung Bhutia. ?R.C. Prakash and Abhishek Yadav are not in the same category as Bhutia and his absence was one of my biggest problems.? The Indian coach didn?t stop at that, slicing a dig at the Indian clubs, ?It?s after all not helpful that all foreigners at the club level are strikers. It doesn?t give the Indians much scope to develop.? 

Yes, Zico came, he saw and as expected he conquered. He also paid a compliment, so to say. 

After a 4-0 drubbing of India at the Salt Lake Stadium on Wednesday, Zico remarked, ?Indian football has developed,? while adding, ?but it needs much more. The most important thing India need is total professionalism.? 

So will he mind coaching India one day? ?Even though my present is with Japan, I cannot say for sure I will say no to an offer to be the coach of India. Right now I just want to return to Brazil.? 

Japanese midfielder Shinji Ono admitted after the match, ?my goal from the free-kick was clearly lucky.? 

?This game was very difficult, but we always believed we could do it,? Ono said. Quite a diplomat. His captain Tsuneyasu Miyamoto wasn?t far behind. ?Our finishing was not the best, while the Indian defence was performing quite well. The high humidity was an important factor.? 

All said and done, the curtains have come down on the Indian World Cup adventure. It?s all darkness, quite like the unforeseen darkness that fell upon the stadium just after halftime.

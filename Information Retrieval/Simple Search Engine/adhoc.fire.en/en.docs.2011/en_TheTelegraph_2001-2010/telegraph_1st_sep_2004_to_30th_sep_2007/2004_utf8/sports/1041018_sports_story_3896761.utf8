The Telegraph - Calcutta

 When Hussain targeted Sachin

 - 2001 tour of India - ?I really can?t believe people expected me to just stand 

back and admire him? 

London: Former England captain Nasser Hussain says his team had worked out ?very precise plans? to tackle the Indian batting might, specially Sachin Tendulkar, during the 2001 tour by packing the off-side and bowling a yard outside off-stump, but claims it was not a negative tactic. 

?I thought the best way to approach India was to control their batsmen and the rate they scored at. I felt that if we could stop them scoring fluently we could exercise a degree of control over them,? the Chennai-born Hussain wrote in his just released autobiography, Playing with Fire. Admitting that he did not have the firepower to try to blast out the likes of Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid, he said he had needed to think of alternative ways of dealing with them. 

?I asked the lads (shortly before the first Test in Mohali) what they thought about it that night at dinner, and they were enthusiastic, so we worked at it in the nets and then went into all the warm-up games with packed offside fields. I didn?t care if we were going to be boring,? said Hussain, considered one of England?s finest captains. 

But despite the plans, India defeated England by ten wickets in Mohali and went on to win the three-match series 1-0. 

?We didn?t treat Tendulkar very differently from the others at this stage. All I knew was that I didn?t want to feed his strengths, didn?t want to make it easy for him to dominate,? Hussain said. 

?Yes, I wanted Matthew Hoggard to bowl a yard outside off-stump to him with an eight-one field. I wanted Freddie Flintoff to come round the wicket to him every now and then and try to hit him in the ribs, with two men out on the hook and a short leg to try to unsettle him. 

?We hadn?t talked about Ashley Giles bowling over the wicket to him, but it was a tactic we had used in the past and Duncan Fletcher (team coach) and I were certainly not averse to him doing it.? 

Hussain claimed that the approach by England was not a negative one as suggested by many. 

?People went on and on about it being a negative tactic and against the spirit of the game, that sort of stuff, and I think that affected Ashley?s career for a while, but I think it was totally unfair and simplistic to call it a negative tactic. 

?What did people expect us to do? Just lob it up to Sachin and then see him smack our inexperienced attack all over the place? 

?Then we moved to Bangalore for the third Test, where I noticed, when it was batting, that it was a very unusual wicket and was rock hard by Indian standards. 

?So that night I thought to myself, ?I?m not just going to let Ashley run up and bowl on a perfect strip. He?s not the biggest turner of the ball and they?re going to love that on this concrete strip. I?m going to get him to land it in that rough?. 

?When Tendulkar came in, I asked Ashley to land it out in the rough, with James Foster keeping in a helmet outside the leg stump and the ball exploding when it hit certain areas,? Hussain said. 

?Sachin was a bit taken aback by this and didn?t really seem sure what to do, the very object of our exercise. Sehwag went after Giles and succeeded to a large extent, but we were just picking wickets off at the other end while a confused Sachin was kicking it away and scoring very slowly.? 

Hussain said he had asked Flintoff to shake up Tendulkar by bowling short-pitched stuff. 

?I wanted Freddie to get it into his ribs and shake him up a bit. I wanted Freddie to hit him on the head, encourage him to pull with two men in the outfield. It was an unusual plan, I grant you, but to this day I do not consider it a negative one. 

?We were bowling on a flat wicket in Bangalore, for heaven?s sake, against some of the best batsmen in the world, with a hugely inexperienced attack. 

?In the end Tendulkar had had enough, went down the wicket to try to hit Ashley out of the rough and was stumped for the first time in his Test career for a slow 90. And we bowled them out for 238. That to me, is laudable.? 

Hussain said he was surprised to receive a letter from Ted Dexter, a former England captain and chairman of selectors, complaining about his tactics. 

?I certainly couldn?t believe it when I was sent a letter by Ted Dexter, complaining about my tactics to MCC. He seemed to be saying that he went out there to watch Tendulkar bat and score at four an over and I?d spoilt his little trip. I really can?t believe people expected me to just stand back and admire him.? 

The 36-year-old Hussain, who retired from international cricket last year, said: ?During the India trip, I discovered that my passion and my fire came from the Indian side of me and their passion for the game of cricket.?

Busan: Germany?s unbeaten record under Juergen Klinsmann came to an abrupt halt on Sunday when they were beaten 1-3 by South Korea in a re-run of their 2002 World Cup semi-final. 

Kim Dong-jin, Lee Dong-gook and Cho Jae-jin were on target to give South Korea a measure of revenge after their 0-1 defeat by Germany at the World Cup two and a half years ago. 

Germany captain Michael Ballack, who scored the winner in that match, missed a late penalty that would have made it 2-2. 

Midfielder Kim put South Korea ahead in the 16th minute, firing a left-footed volley past Oliver Kahn from 20 metres. 

But Ballack, who scored in Germany?s 3-0 victory over Japan on Thursday, equalised for the three-time World Cup winners eight minutes later when he steered a low free-kick past Lee Woon-jae from the edge of the box. 

The South Korea goalkeeper rescued his side moments later, making a sharp stop to deny striker Miroslav Klose after some slack defending. 

Ballack, who missed Germany?s 0-2 defeat by Brazil in the World Cup final after being booked against the Koreans, then had another free-kick deflected against the post. 

Klose nearly scored with an opportunistic volley that dipped just over in the 66th minute. 

Lee Dong-gook struck five minutes later, finding space to loop a superb right-footed volley past Kahn from just inside the penalty area. 

Ballack had a penalty brilliantly saved by Lee in the 85th minute after defender Park Jae-hong was harshly adjudged to have handled. 

Substitute Cho scored from close range two minutes later following good work from German-based striker Cha Du-ri, whose pace had bothered the visitors all game. 

Germany play Thailand in Bangkok on Tuesday in the last game of their three-match tour which is a reward for the backing Asian countries gave Germany in their successful bid to host the 2006 World Cup. 

Before Sunday, Germany had won four games and drawn one under Klinsmann since he took over in July.

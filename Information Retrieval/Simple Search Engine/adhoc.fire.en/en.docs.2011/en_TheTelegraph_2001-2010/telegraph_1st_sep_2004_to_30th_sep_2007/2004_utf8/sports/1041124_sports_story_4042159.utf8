The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Classy three failed to impress 

 STAR RACER

 The arrival of Moon Emperor was expected to add a new dimension to the December 4 classic, the Calcutta 2,000 Guineas. But nothing has changed significantly, though purists argued after the running of the 1,600m Artaius Cup last Wednesday that Moon Emperor will be the horse to beat in the male classic. 

 In that race, the Daniel David-trained 6-10 favourite was at a 3-kg weight disadvantage against Vijay Singh?s main Guineas? hope Elistano. And the verdict between the two was a mere neck.But each side maintains that his three-year-old has more scope for improvement. It, therefore, makes the race an open contest. Also in the contention is Bollywood Dreams. He stumbled in the final stretch to fare badly with his topweight in a Class III race. His performance, on the day,is best ignored.

 The Bharath Singh-ward is known to raise his performance-level on big occasions. Further, one may also need to see and judge Star Angel?s effort in the 1,000 Guineas. She is ante-post favourite for the fillies? classic on Friday. .One thing is, however, for sure ? all of four are just about moderate gallopers. Had Thrilling Proposal not shifted out in the last furlong of the race, the four-year-old would have beaten both Moon Emperor and Elistano handsomely, instead of finishing less than a length behind the two youngsters. 

 If B.Prakash demonstrated his riding artistry on the Emperor, he faced no opposition on Star Emblem, the hottest order of the day. However, it is too early to talk about his classic prospects as the Placerville-Astana three-year-old claimed a Class IV race ? the 2,000m Birthday Girl Handicap. 

 Daniel?s other wards who also did well in their respective events were Amazing Career and Far Hope. The former posted a back-to-back win to further enhance the winning potential of Secret Prospector.

 The Pros-pector?s rider apprentice Gajender Singh was suspended recently for six race meetings in view of making a half-hearted attempt on the horse. However, the same yard- stick was not applied on jockey Yacoob (on Red Sea) who had dropped his hands 100m from home to allow stablemate Bay Dragon to occupy the second slot. Yacoob was let off with a reprimand only. 

 Stiping has been a weak link in the city racing for quite some time. In fact, had a senior steward, it is learnt, not put his foot down on opening an inquiry, stipes would have cleared Gajender (on Secret Prospector) with a routine warning. The two horses who were impressive winners on the day and could strike again were Calescent and Salient Star. The former was returning to the track after nearly seven months and the latter found the mile trip to his liking after wasting away his energy over sprints. 

 Far Hope triumphed in the 1,400m Easter Parade Cup as the 5-4 favourite Bollywood Dreams went out of contention after stumbling in the home stretch.Acualite, on the other hand, bravely countered the favourite Noble Investment?s challenge as the latter was sluggish in his movements.

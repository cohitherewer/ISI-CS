The Telegraph - Calcutta

 ?Wish I was Dravid-cool? 

A STAFF REPORTER

 Harbhajan Singh 

Calcutta: The Australians fear him for his attitude and aggro. The South Africans, too, have got a whiff of those characteristics in this series. 

And Harbhajan Singh says, ?I wish I was as cool as Rahul Dravid.? 

?The way I play my cricket, there?s no harm in being aggressive. I want to do well for India. I would say it?s my age that is responsible? I?m only 24. As I grow older, maybe?? Harbhajan, who was named Man of the Match for his nine-wicket match-haul, said on Thursday. 

Jacques Kallis survived, courtesy umpire Daryl Harper, on the fourth day off Harbhajan. The disappointment and frustration shown at the appeal being turned down resulted in captain Sourav Ganguly being fined on Wednesday. Harbhajan, though, took it coolly. 

?I was calm, though felt bad about the decision. You have to be prepared to take it in the right spirit. Sometimes you have things going in your favour, while on other occasions things don?t fall in place,? the off-spinner said. 

?I got Shaun Pollock today, which replays suggested shouldn?t have gone in my favour. But that?s the way things are? Umpiring is a hard job.? 

He felt the dismissal of Kallis on the final morning was the ?turning point?. Harbhajan, ?pleased with his performance?, said he enjoyed ?bowling on this wicket?. 

?Eden has always been lucky. I got 13 wickets against Australia in my comeback match here in 2001.? 

?In the first innings there wasn?t much in it for the spinners. But in the second innings we got some purchase.

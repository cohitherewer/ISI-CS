The Telegraph - Calcutta

 ?We?re pretty much still in the game?

 - Kumble?s ?half-century? vs Australia 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI 

Mumbai: For senior pro Anil Kumble, it?s a ?half-century?: Fifty wickets in two series?, within a year, versus Australia. 

?Now that you?re telling me, yes, I?ve got 50 wickets? Definitely feels very nice,? Kumble told The Telegraph on Thursday evening. 

 Kumble wasn?t picked for the first Test of the last series, in Brisbane, but collected 24 wickets in the next three. This time, with one innings remaining, he has already got 26. 

?I feel I?m getting rewarded for consistently giving that hundred per cent,? he remarked. 

Actually, Kumble began this series with a milestone on the opening day ? in Bangalore ? when he reached 400 wickets. He hasn?t looked back since. 

However, the star leg-spinner does have a regret: ?I wish, today, we hadn?t conceded a lead of 99? Wish the deficit was much less?? 

Yet, this role model competitor hasn?t given up. ?We?re pretty much still in the game,? he insisted. 

Perhaps, Kumble couldn?t have framed his thoughts otherwise.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

Lead of 100 will be difficult to beat

Neutral View

By far the biggest attendance at Eden Gardens has 

been on Day III, and no surprises, why, of course, India were batting. There still 

seems to be a lob-sided love affair with the Indian batting days as opposed to 

their bowlers and fielders going to work. 

Why is this, with the charisma, personality and skill 

of Zaheer, Pathan, Harbhajan, Kumble and the likes? 

I suppose it is the same world-wide, really. Calcutta 

folk came out in droves to hopefully see Sehwag continue in swashbuckling style, 

as well as all the other stars in this Indian batting unit perform. They must 

have left at stumps a little disappointed indeed, even though a lead was accomplished. 

The reason I say this is that Sehwag?s wicket was lost early and the middle-order 

could not convert. 

An extremely well planned and directed bouncer from 

Ntini cramped Sehwag terribly and ballooned to Graeme Smith (who in running under 

the early chance and in joyous celebration showed full recovery from his recent 

tangle with a car). This created instant silence throughout the arena for a few 

seconds until the Little Master emerged from the pavilion. 

Once again a frenzied applause even before Tendulkar 

had faced a ball, conjuring up thoughts like, how does he handle the pressure 

and expectation? I wonder how all the Indian batsmen handle this constant expectation, 

given their god like status in their own country, and question whether in fact 

they are handling it.

There has been no noticeable change in their struggling 

form or mode of play since South Africa has replaced Australia. Understandably, 

batting was going to be tough against the Aussie quicks and runs hard to come 

by, but you can?t tell me South Africa are of the same strength in this respect. 

Shaun Pollock is without doubt a class act and a genuine 

wicket-taker in all conditions, but not supported in the same way Glenn McGrath 

is for Australia. However, the conservative survival approach shown against the 

Australians is still in place, and once the lone-ranger Sehwag is dismissed, the 

run-rate never pushes too far beyond 2.5 runs an over.

Surely, with a batting line-up which matches Australia?s, 

India should be looking to dominate in most circumstances ? and that means not 

being dictated to by bowlers for too long. The middle-order should take over from 

innings like Sehwag?s, and take the total to a level from where it is up to the 

bowlers. 

Not all batsmen play the same, but the intent can 

be. At the moment I see the Indian middle-order not backing themselves up, almost 

in fear of getting out, or dare I say it, protecting statistics (I hope this is 

not the case). 

The example should be taken from a Sehwag quote while 

interviewed in Kanpur, ?I see the ball to hit and hit it!? It can be that simple 

if you want it to be, but I do not see that from such naturally gifted players. 

I feel the Indian batsman should now be setting the standard for world cricket, 

which they did in patches not too long ago. 

In saying this, the middle-order in this first innings, 

underachieved, all getting starts but no one going on. Credit does need to go 

to the South African?s though, who were impressively patient and disciplined throughout 

the entire third day, making it difficult to score.

India, with a lead of 54, are now in the box seat 

with Karthik and Pathan building a crucial partnership. Should the lead move in 

excess of 100, I feel the Indians will be very hard to beat. Do not rule out the 

South Africans though, they are well drilled and enjoying their cricket in India.

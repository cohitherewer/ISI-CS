 Selectors warning for Smith amp; Co. 

Durban: South African cricket selectors have warned the national team members that they could be replaced by second stringers if they do not shape up during the ICC Champions Trophy beginning next week in England. 

Convenor of the selection committee, Omar Henry, said in an interview on Saturday that he was keeping a close watch on the performance of the South African A team players, who would be involved in a home series against the New Zealand A side. 

There are places available for the tour to India in November, but the possibility of playing against England should not be discounted either, said Henry. 

West Indies sponsor 

Meanwhile, Caribbean Ispat, owned by the Indian-born Mittal family, will sponsor the West Indies team in the Champions Trophy. 

The group has earlier also sponsored the team in the World Cup last year, and also during their 1994 tour of India. (PTI)

 New law should make ICC?s job easier: Mani

 Ehsan Mani 

Dubai: A proposed new throwing law should make the rules of cricket fairer and easier to apply, ICC chief Ehsan Mani said on Sunday. 

?What we are trying to do is to come to a system which is fair, which we can protect in the sense that once we put the criteria in place no-one can breach it,? Mani said. 

The issue of throwing has long caused controversy in cricket with fierce debate over whether the unorthodox action of bowlers such as Sri Lanka?s Muttiah Muralidharan should be allowed. 

The ICC is proposing to increase the elbow flex allowed to bowlers. ?Our cricket committee has recommended 15 degree tolerance limit for all bowlers because bio-mechanics have told us that if the bowling arm is bent less than 15 degrees the human eye cannot detect it,? Mani said. 

?We are looking at a two-stage process. If a bowler gets reported, his home board takes over the process. He has six weeks to correct his action during which he can play and once the home board feels is he okay, he can continue.? 

?The minute a bowler is reported, his action will be analysed in a laboratory. If the experiments show he is going beyond the level of tolerance, the ICC will step in immediately and testing will be done under our supervision at 15 degrees, and it has to be done in four weeks. In lab conditions if it is shown that flexing of the arm is more than 15 degrees, he will not be allowed to play.? 

Current rules impose limits of five degrees for spinners, 7.5 for medium-pacers and 10 for fast bowlers. 

Asked about Muralidharan, who has been reported twice, Mani said: ?His action is so quick that the speed at which his arm comes down is quicker than most fast bowlers.? 

Mani said the old limits had been set without any scientific evidence. ?We realised that some slow bowlers? actions were as quick as those of fast bowlers. So the question arose whether to treat them as fast bowlers or spinners. Instead of getting involved in that sort of discussion, we thought it better to have same level for everyone.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Pak fans unlikely for ODI

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Eden Gardens was to have played host not only to the Pakistan cricket team, but also to the neighbouring fans for Saturday?s Platinum Jubilee one-dayer. 

That was what chairman of the Platinum Jubilee committee, Jagmohan Dalmiya was hoping for. However, till Friday evening, none of the Pakistan supporters made the trip across the border. 

Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) had expected the presence of nearly 200 Pakistani fans for the day-night encounter and accordingly, tickets had been arranged well in advance. 

?But we have no idea whether they have been collected,? a CAB official said. 

Police sources feel it may be due to the holy month of Ramazan that Pakistan fans have stayed away from making the trip. 

Meanwhile, Pakistan cricketers visited the Nakhoda Masjid prior to their net session at the Eden Gardens on Friday.

 Steve: Sourav has a problem with short ball 

Melbourne: Former Australia captain Steve Waugh says Team India captain Sourav Ganguly is suspect against the short ball. 

Waugh made his comment in a dossier analysing the strengths and weaknesses of India?s batsmen ahead of the four-Test series against Australia which starts in Bangalore on Wednesday. 

The 39-year-old published his list of ?the batsmen we must stop? in a column in the Herald Sun on Tuesday. 

Waugh said Sourav was India?s best player of spin but not so fond of the quick stuff. ?(He) gets caught up with the short ball at his body and is unsure when to play the hook shot,? said the former Australia captain. 

Sourav would be under enormous pressure if he lost the first Test, Waugh added. 

Waugh also said that ego could affect the concentration of strokeplayer Virender Sehwag and Akash Chopra was uncertain against the short ball. 

Rahul Dravid has the greatest mental strength in world cricket, Waugh said, before adding: ?(He is) due for a mediocre series to prove he?s human?. 

Waugh said Sachin Tendulkar, who is battling an elbow injury, could lose his edge if he engaged in on-field banter while V.V.S. Laxman was not in top form, had poor footwork and played away from his body outside the off-stump. 

Yuvraj Singh could struggle with nerves despite a confident swagger, added Test cricket?s most capped player. 

Waugh retired in January after a 1-1 draw in the four-Test series at home against India, who retained the Border-Gavaskar Trophy after they had won 2-1 on their own soil in 2001. 

Throughout Waugh?s celebrated 168-Test career, a Test series victory in India eluded him. Australia have not won a series there since Bill Lawry?s team triumphed 3-1 in 1969. 

Australia assistant coach Tim Neilsen said on Tuesday the team would use Waugh?s dossier in their planning for the first Test.

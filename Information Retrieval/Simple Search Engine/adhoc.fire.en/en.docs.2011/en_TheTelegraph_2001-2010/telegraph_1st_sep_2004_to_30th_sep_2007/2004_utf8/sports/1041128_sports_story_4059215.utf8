In another match, scoring once in each half, Sporting Clube de Goa knocked out last year?s runners-up Mohammedan Sporting 2-0 while JCT, Phagwara, prevailed over SBT 2-1 to enter the quarter finals. 

Against the local champions HAL, East Bengal launched into the offensive after the change sides. 

In fact, East Bengal could have scored in the 76th minute when Bhaichung Bhutia struck a powerful shot but the ball hit the post and rebounded. Bhutia took another shot in the very next minute, but HAL custodian Abhra Mondal effected a save. 

The all-important goal for the visitors came seven minutes from time. Syed Rahim Nabi crossed the ball from right and D?Cunha intercepted it and ensured that it landed into the net. 

Sporting Clube de Goa went into the lead when Ajay Diwakar scored off a pass from Alvito Rodrigues in the 28th minute. Rodrigues, then, neatly intercepted a pass from Dudu Omagbemi and shot into the net in the 47th minute. 

Manjit Singh scored in the seventh and 43rd minutes for JCT while K.M. Abdul Naushad reduced the margin for SBT on the stroke of half-time.

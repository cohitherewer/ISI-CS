 Pak beat India to title

Lahore: Pakistan outplayed India to win the revived Kirlosker Trophy golf tournament in Lahore on Wednesday. 

The Kirlosker Trophy was last held in 1991 and was revived amidst a thaw in India-Pakistan relations. Pakistan made a clean sweep by winning five matches in the foursome play on Monday, while the sixth match was tied. 

On Day II, Pakistan and India won three matches each, but Pakistan outplayed their rivals 8-4 in the individual two-ball play on Wednesday to emerge winners by 16.5 to 7.5 points. (AFP)

 Becks may retire after World Cup

London: England captain David Beckham says he may retire from international soccer after the 2006 World Cup, media reported Sunday. 

The 29-year-old has been named in Sven-Goran Eriksson?s squad for Wednesday?s friendly with Spain after recovering from cracked ribs, but says the current World Cup qualifying campaign and the finals in Germany could be the last for his country. 

?I think the World Cup is probably as far as it will go for me as an England player,? the Real Madrid midfielder was quoted as saying in the Sunday Express. 

?But you never know. If I feel good I may carry on.? 

England are well-placed to make the 2006 finals, sitting top of group VI on 10 points. 

Beckham?s Real Madrid teammate Zinedine Zidane and Luis Figo have already retired from playing for France and Portugal, respectively in a bid to extend their club careers and, Beckham says he will carry on playing as long as he can. 

?I want to play on for as many years as people want to give me. When I start fading out and the legs start getting heavy, is when I will look to do something else,? he said. (Reuters)

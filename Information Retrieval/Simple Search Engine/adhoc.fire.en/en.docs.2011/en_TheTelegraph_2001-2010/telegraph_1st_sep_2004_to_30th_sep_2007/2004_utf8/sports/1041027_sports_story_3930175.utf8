The Telegraph - Calcutta

 ICC meeting concludes

Dubai: The two-day meeting of an International Cricket Council (ICC) committee to review flawed bowling actions concluded here on Tuesday. Former internationals Aravinda de Silva, Angus Fraser, Michael Holding, Tony Lewis and Tim May joined ICC?s general manager-cricket, David Richardson, and a panel of human movement specialists here to discuss the bowling actions of slow bowlers. 

The outcome of the meeting, however, would be known later after the review committee makes its recommendations to the full ICC Cricket Committee (Playing). 

The committee had been asked to review the current process for dealing with potentially flawed actions and to make recommendations on any changes that may be required. The meeting followed a research project carried out at the ICC Champions Trophy in England by Dr Paul Hurrion. The expert panel of human movement specialists assisting the committee was made up of Dr Hurrion, Professor Bruce Elliott and Dr Marc Portus. 

Fraser, De Silva and May ? all members of the ICC Cricket Committee ? would make recommendations to the full ICC Cricket Committee (chaired by Sunil Gavaskar) when it meets to discuss the issue in November. (PTI)

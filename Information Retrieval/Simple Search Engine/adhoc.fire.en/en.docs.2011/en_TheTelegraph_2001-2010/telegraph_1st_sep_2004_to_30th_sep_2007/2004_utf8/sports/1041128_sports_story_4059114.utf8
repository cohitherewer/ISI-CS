 Ranadeb helps Bengal fight back

A STAFF REPORTER 

 Ranadeb picked up six for 75 

Calcutta: A sparkling bowling display by Ranadeb Bose helped Bengal claw back into their Ranji Trophy Elite group A match against Gujarat in Siliguri on Saturday. 

According to information received here, Gujarat, who ended the Day II with 269 for three, were dismissed for 361, taking a first-innings lead of 63. Ranadeb returned the figures of six for 75. Captain Rohan Gavaskar provided an early breakthrough by dismissing former India wicketkeeper Parthiv Patel. Ranadeb then took over and simply tormented the visitors. Gujarat?s last seven wickets fell for 62 runs. 

In the second innings, Bengal lost opener Arindam Das on a personal score of 15. But the losses of former captain Devang Gandhi and Nikhil Haldipur in a span of six overs put the hosts in the dock. 

However, Gavaskar again showed resilience with his bat and in association with Deep Dasgupta, put up an unbeaten 93-run stand in the fourth wicket.

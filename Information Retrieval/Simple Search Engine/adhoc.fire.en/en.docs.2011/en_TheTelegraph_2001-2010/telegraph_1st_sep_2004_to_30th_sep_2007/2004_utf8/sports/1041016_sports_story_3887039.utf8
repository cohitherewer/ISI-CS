 Rooney?s talent runs deep 

 Rooney?s work ethic is impressive 

With every passing match and every matchless pass, the feeling is beginning to take hold that those canny men at Manchester United may just have got Wayne Rooney on the cheap. The fee, ? 27million for a teenager, appeared high at the time, given that United were the only significant bidder for the then Everton striker in a market of declining transfer prices. Now Rooney looks a snip. 

Sir Alex Ferguson knows his footballing thoroughbreds and how to bring the best out of them. Even before Rooney had kicked a ball in anger for his new employers, United?s manager was talking excitedly about deploying the player in the hole behind two strikers. England?s head coach, Sven-Goran Eriksson, has also adopted this stance to good effect; Rooney shining against Wales and Azerbaijan behind Michael Owen and Jermain Defoe. 

It will be interesting to see whether Ferguson uses Rooney behind Ruud van Nistelrooy and either Alan Smith or Louis Saha, a move that might complicate life for Paul Scholes. Ferguson has yet to field Rooney this deep. Whatever the Scot?s plans for his English sensation, one thing is certain: he has bought a real diamond, slightly rough in parts, notably in occasional mistimed tackles and screaming foul-mouthed abuse at linesmen, but the teenage prince will definitely mature into a king. 

Ferguson had initially wanted to wait until the winter transfer window before landing Rooney. It is just as well he brought the move forward. If the youngster maintains his current, post-metatarsal form, all the leading clubs of Europe will be chasing him in January. Not that he would dream of leaving Old Trafford, but he will still receive covetous glances. 

Little wonder. He has struck a hattrick in the Champions League and sparkled in two internationals. He has shown an understanding of the right runs to make which is astonishing decision-making for one so young. His work ethic is impressive while his passing, particularly from right to left, can cut defences asunder. He fancies his luck from free kicks and as for his first touch, Rooney makes even bad incoming passes look good. He has Dutch brains, Brazilian touch and an English heart. 

Performing with such precocity will inevitably have the presidents and coaches in Madrid, Barcelona and Milan swooning, perhaps even in west London, although Chelsea?s coach Jose Mourinho has long since signalled his lack of interest in Rooney. Most significantly, ?Project Rooney?, as the Madridistas call it, is still under consideration at the Bernabeu. 

Rooney, though, looks completely suited to life at Old Trafford, and it is hard to imagine him adjusting to life abroad. The old United-England tension will doubtless surface around Rooney, but both parties can benefit. England have helped hone Rooney?s talents, while United, and Ferguson in particular, can make him a person better equipped to handle fame.

 Irina relents

Moscow: Russia?s Olympic shot put champion Irina Korzhanenko, who refused to surrender her Olympic gold medal after failing a drugs test, has decided to give it back. 

?I?ve spoken to Irina and she told me that she?ll hand the medal back,? Russia?s chief athletics coach Valery Kulichenko said on Sunday.

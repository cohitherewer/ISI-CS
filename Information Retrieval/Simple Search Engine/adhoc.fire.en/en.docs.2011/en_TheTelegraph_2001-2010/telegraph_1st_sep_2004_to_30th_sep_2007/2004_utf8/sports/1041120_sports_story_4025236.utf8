 Love to know how much my arm bent: Imran

 Imran Khan 

Islamabad: Former Pakistan great Imran Khan Friday backed proposed changes to cricket?s throwing laws and said he would love to see how much his arm bent when he used to bowl. 

?I would love to see how much my arm used to bend. I was under the illusion that my arm was always right and did not bend,? Imran said. 

?It would be interesting to see through the modern technology how much the former bowlers used to bend their arms,? said the 52-year-old legend, who took 362 wickets in 82 Tests and 182 in 175 one-day Internationals between 1971 to 1992. 

?When we used to play, such a modern technology was not available and I have always said that the bowling law was faulty. But now I am happy that this has come under discussion and it should be resolved,? the cricketer turned Parliamentarian commented. 

An International Cricket Council (ICC) committee comprising former Test playerslast month found that almost every international bowler flexed his arm at some stage of delivery. 

The committee was headed by ICC general manager Dave Richardson, a former South African wicketkeeper. It also included former Test stars like Sunil Gavaskar, Aravinda De Silva, Angus Fraser and Michael Holding. (AFP)

 Fleming to lead Notts

London: New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming has agreed to become Nottinghamshire?s skipper in 2005. 

?I have harboured an ambition to captain a leading English County team,? Fleming, 31, was quoted as saying on the club?s official website. 

?Nottinghamshire proved they are one of the up and coming Counties with promotion (in two competitions) last season and Trent Bridge holds special personal memories with my Test century on the ground this summer.? 

Fleming has represented New Zealand in 85 Tests and 226 ODIs. (Reuters)

 Karthikeyan just misses pole

Mumbai: Ace Indian driver, Narain Karthikeyan, outgunned some big names, including Renault?s Formula One development driver Helkkl Kovalnainen, to qualify second in the Nissan World Series at Estoril, Portugal on Sunday. 

Narain came second to local circuit driver Tiago Monteiro by half a second, while Kovalnainen, Le Mans Tristan Gommendy and BAR-Honda Formula One driver Enrique Bernoldl finished behind the Indian champion, a release from his sponsors Tata Racing, said on Tuesday. Narain had the misfortune to suffer two tyre punctures, an unusual occurrence in a day at a top-class facility, and was forced into pit stops.

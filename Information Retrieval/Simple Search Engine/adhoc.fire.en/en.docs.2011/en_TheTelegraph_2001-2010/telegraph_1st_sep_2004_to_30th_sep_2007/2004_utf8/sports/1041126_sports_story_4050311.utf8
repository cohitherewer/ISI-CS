 Adelaide: A baggy green cap worn by Australian legend Don Bradman on the 1948 ?Invincibles? tour of England has come to light after being stored away in a Melbourne home.

 The discovery of the cap came as a surprise because it was believed that the 1948 touring members received just one cap each and a collector paid A$400,000 for Bradman?s other cap last year. The cap was uncovered in the wardrobe of retired lawyer Kevin Truscott?s home in Melbourne and was now in the Bradman collection in Adelaide?s state library. When Truscott came forward recently with the second cap, a check of player contracts for the 1948 tour by Bradman collection manager Barry Gibbs revealed each player had been given two caps.

 Mumbai: Former sprint queen PT Usha on Thursday said the Indian athletes should have a long term plan and start preparing for the 2012 Olympics from now itself. ?There is no point thinking about the Beijing Olympics, which is four years from now. There is no meaning in thinking about short term returns,? Usha said after inaugurating the seventh Ryan Open athletic meet here.

 ?It is difficult to understand why our athletes start performing below par after putting up a very good show in the initial stages of international meets?, she added.

 La Quinta: Annika Sorenstam and Tiger Woods meet in a golf showdown this weekend here at the $1 million Skins game with Australian Adam Scott and 2003 winner Fred Couples completing the foursome. Sorenstam, whose eight titles this year included a major at the LPGA championship, has been the top women?s golfer for years. Her historic PGA Tour appearance last year at the Colonial was the first for a woman in half a century.

 Couples won last year with $605,000 to $225,000 for Sorenstam, who captured five Skins in the 2003 event, which also included Mark O?Meara and Phil Mickelson. ?The more you are around the guys, the more comfortable you feel,? Sorenstam said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 SA thrash Bangladesh 

Birmingham: The South Africans ended their 10-match losing run with a nine-wicket thrashing of Bangladesh in the group B league tie of the ICC Champions Trophy at Edgbaston on Sunday. 

After Charl Langeveldt laid the foundation with a three-wicket opening spell to shut Bangladesh out for a paltry 93, Graeme Smith and Jacques Kallis beat the rains in time to overhaul the target. 

Smith remained unbeaten on 42 that included six fours while Kallis was 40 not out. 

Electing to bat, Bangladesh lost their top four batsmen for only 20 runs and were bundled out in 31.3 overs. No. 3 Nasif Iqbal and Khaled Mashud stitched 43 runs for the fifth wicket. 

 Langeveldt struck first when he had Mohammad Ashraful caught by Kallis in the second slip in his second over. 

Two overs later, Langeveldt scalped two in three balls to send back Javed Omar and Saleh before Pollock had Aftab Ahmed caught-behind.

 London: Drinks firm Red Bull has bought the Jaguar team on Formula One?s deadline day, ending months of uncertainty triggered by Ford?s withdrawal from the sport.

 Jordan had previously used engines made by Cosworth that Ford put up for sale along with Jaguar in September. Ford said they had sold Cosworth to Kevin Kalkhoven and Gerald Forsythe, the co-owners of the US based Champ Car Series.

Morariu, strongly supported by former tennis player Tiriac who steps down after eight years in charge, had a clear run at the job without any opponents. Gymnastics coach Octavian Belu and Dinamo Bucharest sport club?s head Marcel Popescu abandoned the race after initially announcing they would run for the post.

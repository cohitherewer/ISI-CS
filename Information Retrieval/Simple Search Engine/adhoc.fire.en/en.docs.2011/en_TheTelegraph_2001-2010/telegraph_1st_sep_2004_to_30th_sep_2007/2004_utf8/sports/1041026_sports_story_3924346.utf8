 IN THE CITY

 East Bengal have ?tentatively? reached an agreement with Ever-Ready?s Earnest Chukwuma Jeremiah and the Nigerian striker will join the red-and-gold outfit in practice at the club ground on Tuesday. 

 ?Jeremiah has been asked to join practice tomorrow,? a senior East Bengal club official said on Monday. Coach Subhas Bhowmick, holidaying in Shantiniketan, is also set to join the team on Tuesday. 

 East Bengal, however, may find it difficult to sign Jeremiah as the fourth foreign player in their ranks, as the Ever-Ready officials are keen not to release him. His inclusion in the East Bengal squad on lien is, therefore, not ruled out. 

 About 90 students from 12 states are expected to vie for a total prize money of Rs 12,000 in the second national school chess championship for the visually handicapped, to be held in Uttarpara, Hooghly.

 Leicester rope in Mongia

London: Dinesh Mongia has been signed by the English county Leicestershire as one of their overseas players for the 2005 season. 

The 27-year-old Indian left-hander will replace Australia?s Brad Hodge for his third stint with any English county. 

?Dinesh is a high quality player,? Leicestershire?s director of cricket, James Whitaker, was quoted as saying on the BBC website on Thursday. 

?Dinesh will offer the team exciting options with both bat and ball. With a very good record and an excellent attitude, we believe that he has the ability to contribute significantly on and off the field in 2005,? Whitaker added. 

Mongia had two separate stints with Lancashire last season when he replaced Carl Hooper and then Stuart Law. In the nine championship innings, he averaged 67.14. 

He has also played 48 one-day Internationals for India, with a highest score of 149 not out, and has a modest average of 27.78. 

The left-arm spinner was, during his first spell with Lancashire, the most economical bowler in the country in the Twenty20 Cup competition.

 Athens: Getting Greeces European champions in the right frame of mind for the World Cup qualifier against Albania on Saturday could depend on soccer association officials turning up in Tirana on Friday with a chequebook. The bonuses for Greeces upset Euro 2004 victory in Portugal in July have become a bone of contention with the team saying they are disappointed that government officials went back on their initial promise to be generous. We are left with a bitter taste, not because of the financial part but because they went back on their word, the players said in a statement. The players want one million euros ($1.22 million) each but the Greek state says it can only afford four million euros to be divided among the 23 squad members, around 173,000 euros each, the same amount it gives to Olympic medal winners.

 Teresopolis: Brazil branded AC Milan rude and intransigent on Thursday over the Italian Serie A clubs refusal to release three players for last months friendly with Haiti.

 Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) president Ricardo Teixeira accused Milan, where veteran captain Cafu, goalkeeper Dida and midfielder Kaka play, of creating problems over the release of players since the start of the year. The crunch came last month when Milan refused to release the trio for the game in Port-au-Prince. The match had been arranged to promote peace between warring factions in the strife-torn Caribbean nation where Brazilian troops lead a United Nations peacekeeping force.

 Beijing: Chinas surprise Olympic womens doubles gold medallists Li Ting and Sun Tiantian are hoping their success in Athens leads to bigger things on the worlds tennis circuits. Our next goal is to play well at the China Open, Su said in Beijing on Friday. Our medal will be a big boost for Chinese tennis, getting more people to play and understand the game, said Li. The pairs unexpected medal is another sign that a concerted push by the Chinese government to develop tennis before the 2008 Games is paying off.

 Bucharest: Romanian Elisabeta Lipa, the most-medalled Olympic rower in history, has agreed to continue until the 2008 Beijing Games just before she turns 40 after persuading the government to improve facilities for the sport.

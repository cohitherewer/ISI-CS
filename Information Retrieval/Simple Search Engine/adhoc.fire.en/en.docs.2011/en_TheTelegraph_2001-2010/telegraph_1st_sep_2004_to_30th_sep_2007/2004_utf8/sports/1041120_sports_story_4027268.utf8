The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Spanish body apologises 

London: The English Football Association (FA) said on Friday it had received a letter of apology from the Spanish football association in this regard. The FA?s website said the letter, from general secretary Jorge P. Arias, categorically condemned the fans? behaviour and reiterated the Spanish FA?s position against racism in football. 

?The FA welcomes the response and now looks forward to receiving details from Fifa on its investigation initiated yesterday,? a statement said. 

Meanwhile, Fifa ordered an investigation into the racist abuse directed by Spanish fans at England?s black players. Some critics said Spain should be forced to play their home games in empty stadiums. 

In a so-called ?friendly? match that shamed the sport, Spanish supporters repeatedly made monkey noises whenever Shaun Wright-Phillips and Ashley Cole touched the ball during Spain?s 1-0 win on Wednesday. (Agencies)

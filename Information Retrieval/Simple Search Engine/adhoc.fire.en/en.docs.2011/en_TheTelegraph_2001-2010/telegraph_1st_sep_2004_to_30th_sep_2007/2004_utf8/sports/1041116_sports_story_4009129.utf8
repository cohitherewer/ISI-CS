The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Super Division resumes today

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: The proverbial Big Two ?East Bengal and Mohun Bagan ? are once again in the fray for the title as the CFL Super Division resumes on Tuesday. 

While Mohun Bagan are currently placed at top of the table with 35 points (from 16 matches), holders East Bengal (33 off 15 outings) may displace them if they can beat Tollygunge Agragami at the Kalyani Stadium on Tuesday. 

Ever-Ready, the third contender, are on 32 and are certain to face an uphill task. They have to beat both Mohun Bagan (match slated for Thursday) and East Bengal (to be held after the Federation Cup) in their final two matches and hope that East Bengal will lose or draw at least one match. 

Of the three in contention, Ever-Ready also have the lowest goal average (21-11) against East Bengal?s 27-6 and Mohun Bagan?s 25-7. George Telegraph have lost all their matches in the Super Six and finished at the bottom. Two other teams ? Tollygunge Agragami and Mohammedan Sporting ? have no hopes of laying claims to the crown. 

It may be recalled that East Bengal and Mohun Bagan finished last year?s league table with 41 and 39 points, respectively, leading to a play-off final between the two. 

East Bengal scraped past Mohun Bagan 6-5 via tie-breaker to the title (the match was tied 1-1 after the regulation and extra times). Since the concept of play-off has been abolished this year, the team finishing with most points, will be the winners. 

A packed national calendar ? with the IFA Shield, Santosh Trophy and Durand Cup ? has seen the League getting delayed since the last match was held on September 27. 

In Mohun Bagan?s last match, they managed a 1-0 win over George Telegraph. East Bengal, then, outclassed the same opponents 3-0 on September 27.

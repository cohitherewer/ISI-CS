The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Subhomoy may make XI

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Subhomoy Das is likely to be included in the XI in place of Anustup Majumdar, while Sabir Ali will replace Ritam Kundu against Andhra Pradesh in the Ranji Trophy tie in Visakhapatnam from Monday. 

It was also learnt that Deep Dasgupta will open the innings with Arindam Das. Nikhil Haldipur will come in at No.3. 

Bengal, who lost their last two games against Gujarat and Mumbai, have four points from as many matches. They won against Karnataka and drew with Railways after surrendering the first innings lead. 

Andhra, too, are struggling and have two points from four games. 

?This is a crunch game for us and we have to play positively. The boys are all charged up,? said coach Karsan Ghavri from Visakhapatnam. 

It is the failure of the batsmen that has put Bengal in a spot this season. ?The batsmen must deliver and I hope they will get their act right in this match,? Ghavri said. 

The pitch is likely to aid spinners from the third day. 

LIKELY BENGAL XI 

Arindam Das, Deep Dasgupta, Nikhil Haldipur, Rohan Gavaskar, Subhomoy Das, Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Sanjib Sanyal, Sourashish Lahiri, Murtaza Lodhgar, Ranadeb Bose, Sabir Ali.

 Moore joins WI team

Bridegtown: David Moore was formally named the West Indies cricket team?s assistant coach, joining fellow Australian Bennett King on the staff. 

The announcement came two days after the West Indies Cricket Board named King as head coach with a three-year contract. 

Moore, 40, is a senior coach at Australia?s Commonwealth Centre of Excellence. He is a former player for New South Wales in the Australian first-class competition and was assistant coach to the Australian team at the under-19 World Cup in Bangladesh earlier this year. 

?Moore?s experience and training in coach education and cricket development will also be a tremendous asset to the development of cricket,? the WICB said. (AP)

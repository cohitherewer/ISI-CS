 ?Wenger?s mental problem with Ruud?

 Ferguson goes on the offensive 

London: Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson blasted Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger, accusing him of having a ?mental problem? with striker Ruud van Nistelrooy. 

United?s Dutch hitman was branded a cheat by Wenger after his tackle on Arsenal defender Ashley Cole, which earned him a three-match suspension. 

Wenger also rapped Van Nistelrooy for his part in Patrick Vieira?s red card in the same fixture last season. 

?The guy has obviously got a mental problem with Ruud Van Nistelrooy for some reason. It?s always Ruud Van Nistelrooy,? said Ferguson. ?Ruud has accepted responsibility and held his hands up. Having seen the video of the incident, Ruud couldn?t believe how high his knee was. 

?He was trying to bring his foot down on to the ball to turn back into Sol Campbell, but he accepts his responsibility and so do we. 

?Wenger obviously has a problem with him. I can?t understand it, I really can?t. But Ruud knows that he has the support of the club and that?s important.? 

Arsenal vice-chairman David Dein met with United chief executive David Gill in Manchester on Wednesday in an attempt to diffuse the tension between the two clubs, following the ill-tempered clash at Old Trafford last Sunday, which United won 2-0, ending Arsenal?s 49-match unbeaten record in the league. 

But, after acting in what they view as a responsible manner over the Dutchman?s conduct and the tunnel bust-up which followed the match, United have again been upset by Arsenal?s approach to the whole affair. 

Wenger has claimed nothing happened in the tunnel despite reports of a slice of pizza being hurled at Ferguson by an Arsenal player believed to be Cole. 

Arsenal midfielder Edu also launched another scathing attack on United?s roughhouse tactics. 

?At the moment what we are doing is saying nothing, and we believe that to be the correct attitude,? added Ferguson. 

?There was supposed to be an agreement between the two clubs that neither would say anything, but that has obviously been washed aside by Arsenal?s actions during the week. 

?What we are doing at the moment is collating a lot of information about Arsenal and of what happened last week,? said Ferguson. ?We will present to the FA video evidence and statements from independent witnesses and that?s important.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Md. Sp. eyeing another surprise

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Henry Chukwukei will be marked 

Calcutta: One man believes his team can go the distance. His opposite, contrarily, is surprised to see his boys in the semi-final stage. 

One man believes his team has the power and potency to clinch the issue within the regulation time. The other, rather putting a wishing cap on, intends to drag the game on towards a shoot-out battle. 

One team held the defending champions Mohun Bagan before beating the tournament?s shame, Renown SC of Sri Lanka, black and blue (10-1). The other, pushed down the barrel by serious contenders East Bengal, staged a remarkable recovery to send Bangladesh?s Muktijoddha Sansad packing. 

For U Myint Kyu and Mridul Banerjee, respective coaches of Myanmar Finance and Revenue SC and Mohammedan Sporting, Thursday?s IFA Shield at the Salt Lake Stadium is a case in contrast. And their match-eve practices saw no exception. 

?This is an easier semi-final for us. They (Mohammedan Sporting) are good but we are confident that we?ll beat them and reach the final,? was how Kyu wanted to put things into perspective. Packing further punch to his seriousness about this objective, Kyu let his wards sweat out under an overcast morning sky for about two and half an hour. 

Banerjee?s idea of pulling off another surprise looked simple ... pray for (rain) god, luck and a favourable shoot-out battle. He might not say all this in as many words, but his emphasis on spot-kicks during Wednesday?s practice, was not to be misconstrued by any other means. 

As he said later: ?I want to play cautiously, particularly in the first half. In between, counter moves will be my offensive line.? 

In his scheme of things, Raman Vijayan?s attacking instincts will be curbed, forcing the veteran to play deep to reinforce the midfield. 

The presence of ?quite a few national players? in the team is also a ?big factor? Mohammedan Sporting coach is putting stress on. But he viewed that, when it comes to the knock-out stage, nothing is guaranteed. 

?It?s really a big achievement for us to come so far. Really surprising. But from now on, anything can happen,? Banerjee maintained. 

Kyu, however, had a first-hand experience of his rivals ... he had watched Banerjee?s boys fighting against Muktijoddha Sansad at the Salt Lake Stadium the other day. ?Two foreigners of them are good... so is Vijayan. They really fought it well in the second half and snatched the victory,? he pointed out. 

It?s almost certain that Henry Chukwukei and Stanley Festus will be marked by the Myanmar. 

But Kyu chose to keep his cards close to his chest, saving his intention to ?finishing the match inside 90 minutes?. 

For the record, both the Nigerian duo didn?t attend the team practice on the match-eve, but the Mohammedan Sporting coach insisted they would play. ?They have some niggling injuries... plus I want them to get a bit of rest before the match,? Banerjee, who termed his team ?underdogs?, said. 

However it seemed, there is something more beyond this ?underdogs? tag. His gestures, his players? body language may be indicating to another ?surprise? against another foreign outfit.

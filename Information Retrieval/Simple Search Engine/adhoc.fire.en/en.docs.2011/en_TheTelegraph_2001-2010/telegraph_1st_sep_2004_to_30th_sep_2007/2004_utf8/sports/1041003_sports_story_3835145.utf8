 Club and country fight for Rooney

 - United, FA set to clash over players? availability for national side 

 SAM WALLACE 

Wayne Rooney will get his first taste of the unique relationship between his new club Manchester United and the Football Association next week as the two look set to clash over the player?s availability to train with the England squad ahead of Saturday?s crucial World Cup qualifier against Wales. 

Sir Alex Ferguson said Friday that the English internationals in his team ? Rooney, Rio Ferdinand, Gary Neville and Alan Smith ? would not be participating in England?s 4pm training session in Manchester on Tuesday. United have already made Ryan Giggs subject to the four-day rule, which dictates the maximum amount of time a player can join up with his country before a game, and he will not train with Wales on Tuesday. It means that Sven-Goran Eriksson will only get to see Rooney for the first time at Wednesday morning?s training session which, ironically, will take place at United?s Carrington training headquarters in south Manchester. 

The club has agreed that the FA can use their state-of-the-art headquarters for the week but they will not have access to United?s England players for the first training session. Although the England squad will not be announced until Sunday evening, Ferguson confirmed that both Giggs and his England players would be treated equally. ?He [Giggs] can travel there on Tuesday night and meet up but he won?t be training. That?s important, neither will the English players be training,? he said. 

Privately, United were unhappy that Giggs had been told to meet up with his national squad in Cardiff on Monday by the Football Association of Wales, instead of resting after Sunday?s game against Middlesbrough. The United winger was due to appear at a dinner for sponsors before travelling back up to Manchester with the Wales team ahead of the match at Old Trafford on Saturday. 

The four-day rule is an edict set by Fifa and United feel that they have no option but to follow it to the letter. Sources at Old Trafford have pointed out that they are simply following the law in the same way that the FA pushed for Ferdinand to receive the maximum one-year ban over his missed drugs test. 

The clash over the availability of United players for England comes as Ferdinand is expected to make his return to the national team for the first time since he was controversially dropped from the squad to face Turkey on October 11 last year. 

That decision led to the premature disclosure that the player had missed a drugs test and set of a chain of events that ended in a serious rift between United and the FA. There have been moves to heal that division, not least the election of United?s chief executive, David Gill, as an FA councillor, but the club still feel they have been poorly treated by national associations. 

During the summer, Portugal refused to compromise over releasing Cristiano Ronaldo from Olympics duty and the winger could also be subject to the four-day rule ahead of his country?s game against Liechtenstein next week. 

Ferguson will lose all of his senior squad to international duty until the middle of next week with the possible exception of Louis Saha, Phil Neville and reserve goalkeeper Ricardo Lopez. However, Ferguson has reconciled himself to the probability that Rooney will almost certainly start for England against Wales, and said Friday that he would have to make sure the 18-year-old would be ready by playing him against Middlesbrough.

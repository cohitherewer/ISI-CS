 Woods? slide reflects new order

Waterford (Ireland): Tiger Woods? slide down the world rankings over the last month underlines the changing face of golf in 2004. 

For five years, Woods retained a stranglehold as the game?s leading player. The likes of Ernie Els, Vijai Singh and Phil Mickelson, more often than not, had to settle for second best behind the talented American. 

No longer, though. While Woods has dropped to three in the official rankings and failed to contend for any of this season?s majors, Els, Singh and Mickelson have notably made a consistent impact. 

South African Els and Mickelson thrilled the galleries at the US Masters in April, producing a scintillating display of shot-making before the American left-hander beat his rival by a stroke with a birdie at the last. 

Els played in the final group of the US Open but slipped back with an 80 in brutal conditions at Shinnecock Hills as his compatriot Retief Goosen edged out Mickelson for the title by two shots. Four weeks later in the US PGA Championship at Whistling Straits, it was Singh?s turn. The workaholic Fijian held his nerve to win a third major crown in a three-way playoff. 

Singh, who in 2003 ended Woods? four-year reign as the PGA Tour?s leading money winner, made a further dent in the American?s record four weeks ago by taking over as world number one. 

Woods could hardly complain as his record run of 264 weeks at the top finally ended. And he accepts it was simply a matter of time before his rivals challenged his supremacy. 

?The guys are working harder and are in better shape,? said the eight-time major winner. ?Their techniques are better. They?re working more hours on the range, as well as in the gym. 

The last few weeks have been particularly difficult for Woods. He was part of the US Ryder Cup team that slumped to a record 18-1/2 points to 9-1/2 defeat to Europe at Oakland Hills. 

He then came close to pulling out of last week?s WGC-American Express Championship at Mount Juliet in Ireland, after straining his shoulder the previous week sleeping awkwardly on a flight to Orlando. 

However, the former world No.1 is now without a stroke-play title for the first time since he won the 1996 Las Vegas Invitational, the fifth tournament of his career. ?I?ve been close this year and I?ve come within a shot of making a playoff two straight weeks,? said Woods after being replaced as world No.2 by Els, the tournament winner. 

?It?s just a matter of eliminating the little mistakes which will allow me to win tournaments.? 

Woods has chances to end his title drought at the season-ending Tour Championship in Atlanta and the Dunlop Phoenix tournament in Japan before the end of the year. 

However, he is likely to achieve that next victory as a married man. Media reports suggest he will tie the knot with his Swedish fiancee Elin Nordegren at the Sandy Lane luxury resort in Barbados on Tuesday.

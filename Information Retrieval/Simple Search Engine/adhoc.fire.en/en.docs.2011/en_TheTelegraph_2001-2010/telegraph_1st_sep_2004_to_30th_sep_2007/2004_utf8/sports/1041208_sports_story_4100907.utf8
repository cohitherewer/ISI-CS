Calcutta: Every defeat is hard to digest. But the way Bengal surrendered to Mumbai by an innings and 132 runs in their Ranji Trophy Elite group A match at Jadavpur University?s Salt Lake campus ground on Tuesday, is simply shameful. 

Bengal coach Karsan Ghavri had this to say after the match: ?If some of the boys feel happy with the way they performed today, they better stay at home.? 

The impact of this defeat is going to be huge as Bengal will now fight for relegation. As Mumbai return home as the leaders of the group with 14 points, Bengal, having suffered consecutive losses, are still on four. 

The wicket may also come under scrutiny as it assisted the spinners and had low bounce. 

Though the visitors had a much superior bowling attack, their main strength lay in spin. The option, therefore, of playing on a pitch conducive to pace bowling could have been explored, even though Mumbai had the likes of Ajit Agarkar in their ranks. 

As it turned out, Mumbai captain Sairaj Bahutule was ?pleasantly surprised.? 

?Frankly speaking, I didn?t expect to win so easily. The wicket was good to bat on. So we concentrated on taking a first-innings lead. 

?Winning the match was not our top priority to start with,? the former India leg-spinner remarked. 

As the day?s action began, Bengal?s agenda was clear ? survival for 90 overs. For that to accomplish, Rohan Gavaskar amp; Co. needed to show application and willingness to stay at the crease. 

Apart from Bengal captain?s unbeaten 70, the rest threw in the towel soon after tea on the final day for just 181 in the second innings. Agarkar took four for 32 while Ramesh Powar, who destroyed Bengal in the first innings, returned a match haul of 10 wickets. 

Arindam Das failed to carry on his first-innings momentum and was caught by Wasim Jaffer at point off Agarkar. 

In the very next over, Bengal lost the other opener as Nikhil Haldipur committed an error of judgement, offering no shot to a Santosh Shinde delivery which uprooted his off-stump. 

Former India wicketkeeper Deep Dasgupta went without troubling the scorers. The manner in which he wanted to steer a low Agarkar delivery was suggestive enough that patience was at the bottom of his priority list. 

It was 43 for three and Bengal?s abject surrender was imminent. 

Anustup Majumdar came in to join his captain. It was a wonderful opportunity for the young debutant to seize on and send a message to the selectors. But he failed. 

Allrounder Laxmi Ratan Shukla, who seems to be occupying his place in XI as a batsman rather than a bowler nowadays, didn?t trouble the scorers either. He had offered a rash shot to the very first ball he faced in the first innings. His end in the second essay came almost in a similar fashion. This time he swept Powar, only to find Nilesh Kulkarni at deep fine leg. 

Agarkar then completed the final rites, his direct throw from mid-on found Ranadeb Bose well short of the crease.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Rhodes my inspiration, says Amla

A STAFF REPORTER 

 Amla 

Calcutta: He?s seen a few Indian movies, but not an avid follower of Bollywood. Instead, Hashim Amla loves to relax and spend times in watching Sourav Ganguly amp; Co. on television. 

The 20-year-old player in the South African squad with Indian connection, however, prides on being part of a new-generation cricketers in the country and believes the side under Graeme Smith is ?immensely potential?. 

For Amla ? born and brought up in Natal, but whose grandparents were based in Surat ? his journey to the India-bound squad was ?tough and challenging?, but tips from some of the South African greats did help his cause a lot. 

?Before coming to India, I spent a lot of time with people like (Jonty) Rhodes and Gary Kirsten and sought tips from them. Incidentally, I played with Rhodes for Natal last season. Watching him at close quarters was a great learning experience for me,? Amla, who arrived with teammates in the city on Thursday, told The Telegraph. 

Amla, though, is honest in saying that he?s not sure of his place in the XI at the Eden. 

The middle-order batsman (?I usually bat at No. 3 or 4 and love to bowl off-spin a bit?) doesn?t have any role-model in the proper sense of the term, but has learnt a lot from Brian Lara, Steve Waugh and Jacques Kallis.

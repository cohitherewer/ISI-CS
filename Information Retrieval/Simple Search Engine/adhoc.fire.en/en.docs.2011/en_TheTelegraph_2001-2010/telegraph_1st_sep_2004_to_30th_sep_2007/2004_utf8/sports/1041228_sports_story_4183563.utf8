Dhaka: Team India captain Sourav Ganguly credited his team for shrugging off last night?s defeat to Bangladesh and playing very well to clinch the series 2-1 here Monday. 

?After what happened last night, the team came out and played very well,? said Sourav after India beat Bangladesh by 91 runs in the third and final one-day International. 

The skipper said the team had a chat with coach John Wright last night after the shock 15-run defeat to the hosts. 

?We did have a chat, John (Wright) was pretty worked up ? had to be with the kind of performance that we put up. But it was a one-off thing and I hope it doesn?t happen again,? he said. 

On the match, Sourav said it had been a good toss to win and the good start that the openers gave laid the foundation for a big score. 

 ?It was a good track, we batted very well. We had a good start which laid the foundation for a big score.? Sourav also praised Bangladesh for having put up a ?very good show? in the one-dayers. 

?They put up a very good show in the one-day format of the game. They have some good players and if they can get their combination right, they will improve greatly as a team.? 

Bangladesh skipper Habibul Bashar rued giving away too many runs but credited the Indians for the way they batted. However, he said his side had gained in confidence after its show in the one-dayers and it would hold them in good stead in the upcoming series against Zimbabwe. 

?We can take a few positives from the one-dayers, the biggest revelation has been Mushrafee Mortaza who bowled and fielded very well in the one-dayers,? he said. 

Man-of-the-Match Virender Sehwag said he enjoyed batting on the ?excellent? track. ?I had told myself that I would play my natural game. The first five overs I put my head down and then opened up,? said the Delhi opener who made a 52-ball 70 to set up the game for India. 

Man-of-the-Series Mohammed Kaif said although he would like to ?face more overs?, he was happy batting at No. 7, a position given to him by his captain and coach. 

?I think I have done quite well. The captain and the coach have made the decision for me although I would be happy if I get to play more overs.?

Calcutta: Bengal cricket touched another nadir on Saturday as they suffered their fourth consecutive Ranji Trophy defeat. At the Eden, Delhi romped home with am eight-wicket victory. 

Already struggling to stay afloat in the Elite group, Bengal will now have to fight it out with another relegation-threatened side, Madhya Pradesh, in their final game to decide the issue. 

Bengal had earlier lost to Gujarat, Mumbai and Andhra Pradesh in group A. 

Delhi, who grabbed four points here, took their tally to 12 and are very much in contention for the semi-final slot. They play Mumbai next. Victory was achieved through a no-ball almost at the stroke of tea. 

Rohan Gavaskar and Laxmi Ratan Shukla had raised hopes of an improbable victory for the hosts last evening, but all that faded as the last seven wickets fell for only 42 runs. Amit Bhandari grabbed his second five-wicket haul to finish with match figures of 10 for 116. This was the second ten-wicket haul in his career. 

A target of 222 was not difficult under the circumstances. Gautam Gambhir took charge as he toyed with the insipid Bengal attack on way to his 126 (111 balls, 20x4, 1x6). A delightful innings exposed the bowling that showed little variation. Also, there was no support bowler in sight once Shib Shankar Paul and Ranadeb Bose ? who had picked up five wickets each in the first innings ? hit a dead end. 

While Ranadeb looked enterprising only in patches, Shib Shankar seemed more inclined to be involved in verbal duels with Gambhir rather than concentrate on his line. 

?The victory has come at the right time. We took the initiative away from them in the morning,? said Ajay Jadeja after the match. The Delhi stand-in captain was all praise for Bhandari. ?He?s a fighting horse and came back well to deliver when it mattered most.? 

Kunal Lal also grabbed four wickets in the second innings, but Jadeja said the left-arm mediumpacer may have to sit out the next game since Ashish Nehra will be back. 

Gambhir looked supremely confident during his essay. It was a superb display of exquisite timing, wide repertoire of strokes and strong determination. The only blemish was when Murtaza Lodhgar dropped a sharp caught-and-bowled chance. 

Never for a moment did it seem like any of the bowlers would succeed in trying to make a breakthrough. Gambhir found a suitable ally in Akash Chopra (62), who dropped anchor at the other end. The pair added 153 runs for the second wicket. 

In contrast, Bengal?s collapse defied logic. The wicket was assisting seam and swing movement but it wasn?t anything that some cautious batting wouldn?t have thwarted. Most of the batsmen fell to rash strokes. 

They did not show the application and tenacity needed to flourish in these conditions. As has been evident right through this season, the temperament was badly missing. The irresponsible manner in which they surrendered was appalling. 

Later, Rohan refused to accept this as a setback. The Bengal captain indicated, virtually in as many words, that this was his ?strategy!? However that may be interpreted, this ?gameplan?, so to say, hardly paid off. The flurry of wickets only helped Delhi gain the psychological edge and it showed in their performance. 

Rohan was dismissed to the first ball this morning and the slide started thereafter. Shukla stayed till he completed his half-century and that was the end of the Bengal resistance. 

Bengal also lost out to experience when it mattered, studied in the backdrop of the fact that Bengal were playing two rookies and many barely experienced ones, while Delhi showed a hand of six India players. But what hurt most in this defeat was the abject submission of most of the players. The seniors were not inclined to take the responsibility required of them and it seemed the youngsters were thrust into the big stage without proper grooming. 

Slow over-rate 

Bengal were fined 15 per cent of their match fee while Delhi charged double the amount for slow over-rate by Match Referee Sanjay Patil.

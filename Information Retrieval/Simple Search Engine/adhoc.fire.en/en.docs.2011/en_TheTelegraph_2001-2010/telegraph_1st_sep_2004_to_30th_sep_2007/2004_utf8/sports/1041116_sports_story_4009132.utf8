Madrid: Barcelona suffered their first Primera Liga defeat of the season when they lost 1-2 at Real Betis on Sunday, allowing fierce rivals Real Madrid to cut their lead to four points with a 6-1 thrashing of Albacete. 

Barcelona created plenty of opportunities throughout a dramatic match in Seville but were unable to recover after their hosts went 2-0 ahead in the second half, despite a late goal from Gerard. 

At the Bernabeu, Ronaldo, Zinedine Zidane and Raul all found the net in a fast-paced first half with Walter Samuel and substitute Michael Owen scoring after the break, before Ronaldo rounded off the demolition with a sixth in injury time. 

The results sharply narrowed the gap between Real Madrid and Barcelona before next weekend?s showdown between the two teams at the Nou Camp. After 11 games Barcelona lead the standings with 26 points, four ahead of Real Madrid. Espanyol, who beat Racing Santander 2-1 on Saturday, are third on 20. 

In Madrid, Albacete were powerless to stop a devastating early onslaught from Real, with Raul flicking a Zidane corner on to the far post for Ronaldo to head home unopposed in the third minute. The visitors gradually found some rhythm and equalised in the 15th minute when Francisco turned the ball into the net. 

Real then upped their game and, helped by a run of errors in the Albacete defence, scored twice more before the break. 

Zidane claimed his first league goal of the season with a fine left-footed strike after a pass from Figo and three minutes later the French midfielder set captain Raul up for a neat header. In the second period, Real looked even more threatening as the Albacete defence crumbled. They went 4-1 up in the 49th minute after a David Beckham free kick following a foul on Figo was headed inside the post by Samuel. 

Ronaldo was the provider as English substitute Owen finished with cool precision in the 89th minute before the Brazilian dribbled past a clutch of defenders to score the Real?s sixth in time added on. Owen?s goal was his sixth in eight games. Earlier Atletico Madrid salvaged a 1-1 draw at Real Mallorca to leave their hosts languishing at the bottom of the table. 

Meanwhile in England, Wayne Rooney scored twice and Ruud van Nistelrooy converted a penalty as Manchester United beat Newcastle United 3-1 away on Sunday to record their first win in three Premier League matches (as reported in Monday?s City Edition). 

Former Manchester United captain Bryan Robson had an unhappy start as West Bromwich Albion manager as his struggling side went down 1-2 at home to Middlesbrough on the ground he once graced as a budding England midfielder. 

United remain 11 points behind leaders Chelsea, who won 4-1 at Fulham on Saturday. 

United manager Alex Ferguson, telling Sky Sports his side can still fight for the title, said: ?We?ve come away with a victory that maybe some others won?t get (at Newcastle).? 

Rooney put United ahead after seven minutes when he volleyed his second goal in six league matches and fifth altogether since Ferguson won the race against Newcastle for the England striker?s transfer from Everton in August. Newcastle captain Alan Shearer equalised in the 71st minute after robbing substitute defender Wes Brown of the ball but complained bitterly about the penalty awarded to United three minutes later. 

Keeper Shay Given palmed down a Rooney effort but then brought down Paul Scholes as they went for the loose ball and Van Nistelrooy converted from the spot for his third league goal and 12th overall this season. 

In Serie A action, Alessandro Del Piero?s goal gave Juventus a 1-0 win at Lecce as the Serie A leaders maintained their six-point advantage over second-placed AC Milan on Sunday. 

Ukrainian striker Andriy Shevchenko scored both goals as Milan beat Siena 2-1 at the San Siro to take his career tally to 100 Serie A goals. 

Third-placed Udinese were held to a 1-1 draw at home to Messina, who moved above Lecce into fourth place. 

AS Roma?s troubles continued as they lost 1-0 to Reggina while a Paolo Di Canio penalty gave Lazio a 2-1 win over Bologna. 

After two successive draws Milan could ill-afford to slip up again and the return to fitness of Shevchenko did the trick. The Ukrainian put Milan in front in the 26th minute with a right-foot finish after being set up by Brazilian Kaka. 

Siena fought back well though, drawing level six minutes later through a Stefano Argilli header from an Enrico Chiesa free kick. But Milan swiftly restored their advantage with Shevchenko?s 100th Serie A goal from close range after captain Paolo Maldini headed down a corner. 

In Udine, Nicola Amoruso gave visitors Messina a 12th minute lead but a fine shot from David Di Michele after the break ensured the points were shared between two of the surprise sides of the season so far.

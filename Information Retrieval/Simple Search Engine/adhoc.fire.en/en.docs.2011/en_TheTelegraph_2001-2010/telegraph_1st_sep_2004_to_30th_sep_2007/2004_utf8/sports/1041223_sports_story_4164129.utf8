 Nantes: Former France midfielder Christian Karembeu is discussing a move back to Nantes, his first professional team, the club said. Karembeu, currently playing for struggling Swiss side Servette, has agreed to join in principle during the transfer window but financial details are still being discussed.

 Karembeu, 34, played for Nantes between 1991 and 1995, winning the Ligue 1 title in his last season with the Canaries.

 The New Caledonia-born midfielder also had spells with Sampdoria, Real Madrid, Middlesbrough and Olympiakos Piraeus. A member of France?s World Cup-winning squad in 1998, Karembeu has played 53 times for his country. 

 Paris: Former Fifa World Player of the Year George Weah, who is to contest Liberia?s presidential elections, will hold a farewell match in Marseille next June. The 1995 African, European and World Footballer of the Year, who reached his peak with AC Milan between 1995 and 2000, ended his European career three years ago with Olympique Marseille after spells with Monaco, Paris St Germain, Chelsea and Manchester City.

 He then played for Al Jazirah in the United Arab Emirates. ?I wanted to bid farewell to my fans and friends,? he told daily France Soir of the June 11 game. ?Through this game, I wish to close the soccer chapter of my life and start a new venture in politics.? 

 Madrid: Real Betis president Manuel Ruiz de Lopera has decided not to sell midfielder Joaquin to Chelsea because of a dispute with city rivals Sevilla over his side?s right to wear their traditional green-and-white shirts.

 ?We had planned that Joaquin would play his last game for Betis wearing the green-and-white shirt against Sevilla at the weekend,? Lopera told reporters after his side?s 1-0 win over Atletico Madrid on Tuesday. ?But we were deprived of that right and he will not now leave until he can wear that shirt again against Sevilla in the league later this season.?

 Betis were ordered to change their shirts in last week?s city derby after referee Fernando Teixeira Vitienes said they clashed with Sevilla?s all-white strip even though the two sides have always played each other in these colours.?

 Sofia: Maria Grozdeva, who won gold and bronze medals for Bulgaria in shooting at the Athens Olympics, was voted her country?s Athlete of the Year on Tuesday.

 The 32-year-old, who has competed at every Olympics since the Barcelona Games in 1992, defended her Olympic title in the women?s 25-metre pistol event with an Olympic record score. She also won the 2004 World Cup in the same event.

 Grozdeva, mother of three children, earned the Olympic bronze in the 10-metre air pistol event. Her husband Valeri Grigorov, who is also her coach, was named coach of the year. 

 Sydney: The southern hemisphere?s three major rugby unions have signed a $323 million contract with News Limited and South Africa?s Supersport to secure the financial future of the expanded Tri-nations and Super 14. 

 After months of speculation, SANZAR, the governing body of the South African, New Zealand and Australian unions, announced on Wednesday it had agreed to extend the current 10-year deal, which expires at the end of 2005, through to 2010.

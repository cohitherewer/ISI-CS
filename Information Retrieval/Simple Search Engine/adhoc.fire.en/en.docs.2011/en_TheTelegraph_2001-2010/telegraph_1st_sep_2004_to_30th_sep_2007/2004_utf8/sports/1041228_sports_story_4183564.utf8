 Remedial work must for Malik

 Malik?s off-breaks and doosras are illegal 

Karachi: Off-spinner Shoaib Malik must undergo remedial work on his action before he can bowl again, Pakistan cricket authorities said on Monday. 

Professor Bruce Elliot, the bio-mechanic specialist at the University of Western Australia, has conducted tests on Malik?s bowling action and has concluded that his off-break and doosra deliveries are illegal. 

?We have received the report from the University and have shown it to our group of bowling advisors who have also concluded Malik needs to undergo remedial work on his action before he can bowl again,? Pakistan Cricket Board spokesman Abbas Zaidi said on Monday. 

Malik, who has taken eight Test and 80 one-day International wickets, is playing in the second Test against Australia in Melbourne after missing the first match in Perth. However, he did not bowl on day II. 

The International Cricket Council (ICC) has proposed that bowlers be allowed a flexibility of 15 degrees in their elbow extension, but current rules say that spinners are only allowed a flexibility of five degrees. 

?Both the off-break and doosra deliveries are characterised by elbow extension values above the current and proposed levels of acceptability as defined by the ICC,? Elliot said in his report. 

?It is therefore recommended that Shoaib Malik undergoes a remedial programme, prior to be subjected to further series of tests to determine his eligibility to bowl.? 

The 22-year-old Malik was reported for a suspect action for a second time by umpires Aleem Dar and Simon Taufel during a one-day match against Sri Lanka in Lahore in October. 

Pakistan fast bowlers Shoaib Akhtar and Shabbir Ahmed had also been reported in the past for suspect bowling actions.

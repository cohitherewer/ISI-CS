The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Anand happy with India?s show

 - CHESS OLYMPIAD 

-?Ivanchuk lives on planet Ivanchuk... it?s hard to emulate him? 

 Anand feels winning by bigger margins could have resulted in a medal 

Mallorca: Viswanathan Anand rated India?s performance as ?good? in the recently-concluded 36th Chess Olympiad. 

Leading the team in the event after 12 years, the World Rapid Champion stressed that the Indians are now ready to move in the big league after their best-ever sixth place finish. 

?We did not lose a single match by more than 1.5-2.5, that itself proves (that performance was good),? Anand said. 

?Perhaps we could have done even better taking into consideration the number of winning positions that we failed to convert and number of losing positions that we drew or won,? he added. 

According to him, had India recorded some more wins with bigger margins they could have finished inside the medal bracket. 

?Perhaps not winning by bigger margins made the difference. If we look at teams like Ukraine and Armenia, they scored many 4-0 or 3.5-0.5 victories, we did that only twice,? he said. 

On his own experience here, Anand said he was ?pleased?. 

?I played 11 games in all and I scored plus five (five victories and six draws), I am also adding a few rating points which is good.? 

Anand, who rested against Cuba in Round 10, which India eventually lost and could never recover thereafter, explained: ?I wanted to take one rest in last five rounds as I had already played quite a few games. The question was when? 

We decided that the 10th round was the best as I could regroup myself and play in the final four matches?. 

On the other hand, Ukraine?s top board player Vassily Ivanchuk laid the foundation for his team?s triumph by winning the first six games. The Ukrainian played in the first 12 games for his team and only took one rest in the penultimate round when things had already gone Ukraine?s way. 

?Ivanchuk lives on planet Ivanchuk,? Anand quickly pointed out. ?It is hard to emulate him, just three days before Olympiad he lost around 15 points in an event and here he was just winning.?

 Lehmann may miss opener

 - Australia in India 

Mumbai/Sydney: Darren Lehmann was appointed vice-captain for the first Test versus India (Adam Gilchrist leading in the absence of Ricky Ponting) in Bangalore from October 6. However, he will be arriving in Mumbai only on the morning of the Aussies? tour-opener against Ranji Trophy champions Mumbai. That is likely to keep him out of the match. 

?Lehmann?s flight out of Melbourne was delayed because of fog and he is now expected to arrive in Mumbai on Thursday morning,? Cricket Australia media manager Jonathan Rose said in Mumbai Tuesday. 

Asked if that meant he will sit out the match, Rose said: ?It is unlikely he will play.? 

Lehmann had gone home from England for personal reasons, and is a vital member of the squad with his ability to play spin bowling well. The left-handed middle-order batsman also provides variety to the bowling attack with his left arm orthodox slow bowling. 

Lehmann, who was a huge success on the Australians? successful visit to Sri Lanka recently by garnering 375 runs in five innings ? including two centuries and one half century ? has played one Test earlier on Indian soil, in Bangalore during the 1997-98 visit. That Test was won by the visitors to narrow the margin of defeat in the series. 

Meanwhile, the visitors in Mumbai had their second workout ? a slightly extended session than on Monday ? this morning at Mumbai?s Brabourne Stadium. They are set to have a full practice and conditioning session on Wednesday morning. 

The Australian assistant coach and cricket analyst Tim Nielsen said on Tuesday that computer analysis of the games had become a vital part of his squad?s preparations for Tests and ODIs. Nielsen, who has played first-class cricket and represented South Australia in his country?s domestic cricket in over 100 games, told reporters here that younger players gravitate more towards computer analysis. 

?I am here to help coach John (Buchanan) in the training track and also in helping players prepare physically. I am also the computer analyst. At team meetings I am responsible for putting the vision (of games played). We use it a lot, it?s very critical (in preparations),? he said. 

?(Opener) Justin Langer uses the data and vision quite a bit as also Michael Clarke. The computer stuff is a lot more common to the younger players,? said Nielsen who has also assisted Aussie great Greg Chappell during his coaching stint with South Australia. ?Some older players like Shane Warne and Darren Lehmann have grown up in a different system and (prefer to) talk to each other, see (video clippings) on television and talk to their coach,? he explained. 

?It?s just another tool. Some guys are happy to see a few balls. We are conscious of not trying to over-use it,? he said.

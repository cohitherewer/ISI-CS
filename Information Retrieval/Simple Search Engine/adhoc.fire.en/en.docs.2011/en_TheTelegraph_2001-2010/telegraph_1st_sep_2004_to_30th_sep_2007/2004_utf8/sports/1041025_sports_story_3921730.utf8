 Hari anchors Indian victory 

 Harikrishna was very impressive against Cordoba 

Mallorca: GM P. Harikrishna led India to a 2.5-1.5 victory over Spain A in the eighth round of the 36th chess Olympiad at Gran Casino here. 

World rapid champion Viswanathan Anand got another easy draw with top Spanish Grandmaster Alexei Shirov, Sasikiran signed peace with Francisco Vallejo Pons while Surya Sekhar Ganguly was forced to take only half point against Roberto Cifuentes Parada. 

In the seventh round, the Indians had lost to Ukraine going down by a minimal margin of 1.5-2.5 in a keenly contested encounter. 

After the eighth round, Ukraine consolidated their position at the top of the table with a brilliant 3.5-0.5 victory over Bulgaria. With this victory, the second seeds took their tally to 25 points out of a possible 32 and they have now emerged as the clear favourites for the title with a three-point lead over nearest rivals Russia who beat Armenia with a minimal margin of 2.5-1.5. 

Indian men again jumped to joint third spot following their excellent triumph and now share the spot with Armenia on 21 points. 

Harikrishna was very impressive against Miguel Illescas Cordoba, the third board player for Spain A. Playing the semi slav defence, the Indian was never in any serious trouble during the course of the game and when opportunity arose, he struck with a vengeance. 

Playing the middle game in spectacular fashion, Harikrishna was quick to spot that his position was slightly inferior and came up with a double piece sacrifice for a rook that netted him enough practical chances. Harikrishna spotted a very neat tactical stroke that netted him an extra piece. The rest was child?s play and Cordoba called it a day after 58 moves. 

In August, Anand had beaten Shirov 5-3 in a one sided 8-games affair at Mainz classics and there too Anand had played the open Spanish as black, an opening he does not use very frequently these days. 

Trading one minor piece after another, the Indian ace made sure that Shirov would not be able to make any decisive progress despite his superior pawn structure and with the exchange of the last minor piece, the players agreed to sign peace. The game lasted 24 moves. Riding on the efforts of International Master S. Vijayalakshmi, Indian eves cruised to an emphatic 2-1 victory over eighth seeds France in the eighth round. 

Vijayalakshmi scored the winner against IM Marie Sebag after Grandmaster Koneru Humpy, playing on the top board, and Nisha Mohota settled for draws with IM Almira Skripchenko and Sophie Millet, respectively. 

In the seventh round, the Indian women had held third seed United States to a creditable draw. 

China continued to dominate the 87-team event and defeated Poland 2-1 to move to 20.5 points out of 24 games played so far. India share the fifth spot with Poland, US and Ukraine with 15.5 points each. Playing white against Sebag, Vijayalakshmi knew that her game was very important for the team as this was the only white the Indians had. 

Marie thought she had a defendable position when she went for the trade of queens in the middlegame but that, in hindsight, proved a wrong decision as Vijayalakshmi had an easy game with clear targets. 

Cashing in on further errors from Sebag, Vijayalakshmi stamped her absolute authority in the endgame with excellent timing. Sebag resigned after 67 moves. 

Earlier in the day, Nisha drew quite easily with Millet. The peace was signed at the behest of the French after 39 moves. (PTI)

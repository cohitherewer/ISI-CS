The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Zimbabwe to hold 10-day camp in India

Mumbai: The Zimbabwe cricket team will play two three-day practice matches against Andhra Pradesh as well as attend a 10-day camp in Visakhapatnam from Sunday to December 30. 

The Zimbabweans are arriving here to get acclimatised to the conditions in the sub continent before their tour of Bangladesh. 

They will leave for Dhaka from Calcutta on December 30, a BCCI release said here on Saturday. 

It was not clear, however, why the Zimbabweans did not pick either Calcutta or Bangalore as their practice and acclimatisation venues. 

This two cities would have been a normal acclimatisation centres when the tour is of Bangladesh. 

Zimbabwe have been hit with an internal factionalism and boycott, leading to the desertion of top talent.

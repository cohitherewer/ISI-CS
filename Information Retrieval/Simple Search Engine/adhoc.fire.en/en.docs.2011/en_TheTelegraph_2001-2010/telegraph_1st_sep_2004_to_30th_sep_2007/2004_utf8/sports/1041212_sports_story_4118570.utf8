 London: Severiano Ballesteros will not be punished by the European Tour for his alleged assault on one of the Tour?s tournament directors at his home course Pedrena.

 The Spaniard had been under investigation for the incident involving Jose Maria Zamora at the Spanish amateur championship in September.

 In a statement issued by the European Tour on Friday, George O?Grady, who takes over as executive director in January, said: ?There was an incident. Both Seve and Jose Maria regret that it took place.

 ?I have had a full and frank talk with Seve and I am now aware how bad he feels about the whole situation.? 

 Ballesteros, who has won two US Masters and three British Open titles, said: ?I apologise to the European Tour and to those affected by my wrong manners.?

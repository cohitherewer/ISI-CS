 Lehmann passes fitness test

 - McMillan likely to be recalled 

Melbourne: Australia batsman Darren Lehmann has been passed fit for the first Test against New Zealand starting on Thursday after recovering from a hamstring strain. 

The stocky left-hander completed a series of sprinting and fielding drills and also batted without any discomfort at the Gabba ground in Brisbane, which will host the opening match of the two-Test series. 

?Yes, that?s confirmed that he?s fit to play. He trained really well,? team spokesman Graeme Vimpani said on Tuesday. 

The injury had kept Lehmann out of the fourth Test against India in Bombay earlier this month. Lehmann, who averages 48.02 in 23 Tests, has endured a rushed preparation for this week?s match. He replaces Simon Katich, who was dropped after making seven and one in the fourth Test against India. 

Meanwhile, New Zealand batsman Craig McMillan is likely to be recalled for the first Test after joining the squad as back-up, according to coach John Bracewell. ?We may look at playing him because he can bowl. He has the hard nut experience the Australians respect.? 

The 28-year-old McMillan played the last of his 52 Tests in June. He was overlooked for the two-Test series in Bangladesh which ended last month. Not selected in the original tour party but then called up as cover, he made 14 and 17 in last week?s four-day tour defeat against New South Wales. 

He remained with the squad in Brisbane this week on standby for ill skipper Stephen Fleming and injured batsman Nathan Astle, although both are expected to be fit. 

Bracewell said Hamish Marshall, a 25-year-old batsman with two caps, could make way instead. (AGENCIES)

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Ashok closes in on title 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Ashok Kumar gave himself a four stroke cushion, thereby edging closer to four consecutive wins on the Amby Valley PGAI Tour after he fired a third round 69 at the ONGC-Noida Open being played at the par-72, Noida Golf Course. 

Ashok, who fired his tenth straight under-par score on the Tour on Friday, has a three-day tournament tally of 13-under 203, according to information received here. 

Bangalore lad S. Madaiah fired a level-par 72 for the sole second position at nine-under 207, while Mukesh Kumar and Shiv Kapur (who joined Ashok on the final round leader-group for the second successive week) were tied-third at eight-under 208. Both fired rounds of 68 on the day. 

 Ashok Kumar, surprisingly, was far from happy with his showing.

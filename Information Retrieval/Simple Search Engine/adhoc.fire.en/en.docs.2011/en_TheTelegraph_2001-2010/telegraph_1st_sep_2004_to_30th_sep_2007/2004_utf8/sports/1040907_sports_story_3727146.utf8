 Advantage Australia: Symonds 

London: Australian allrounder Andrew Symonds believes his side has a big advantage going into the ICC Champions Trophy which starts here on Friday. 

Many in the Australian squad have played County cricket in England and Symonds is happy that experience will give his side a unique insight into the conditions the tournament will be played under. 

Symonds has had successful stints with Gloucestershire and Kent and many of the Australian squad, including Glenn McGrath, Michael Clarke, Michael Kasprowicz and Matthew Hayden, have enjoyed equally profitable summers in the English game. 

And the 29-year-old is certain that knowledge can be put to good use as the Australians try to win one of the few trophies in world cricket that has eluded them. 

Symonds said: Playing County cricket helped me develop as a player greatly. The best way to learn how to play cricket is in a match situation and playing County cricket really helped me out. 

You can be hitting it well in the nets, and that gives you confidence, but the only way you know where you are is by playing cricket.

 We?ve mental plans versus SA: Vaughan 

 South Africa will target Harmison, says Smith 

Port Elizabeth: England captain Michael Vaughan says his team has ?mental plans? as part of its arsenal in the Test series against South Africa. 

Vaughan told a news conference on Thursday on the eve of the first Test: ?In any series there are a few (verbal) battles and a few confrontations. ?We?ve got game plans on all their players and mental plans on a few of their players. The odd bit of verbal might upset some of their players.? 

Vaughan dismissed comments by South African counterpart Graeme Smith that fast bowler Stephen Harmison would come in for special attention from the home side batsmen. ?He?s the number one bowler in the world and he?s got there by bowling sides out,? Vaughan said. 

Smith had earlier maintained that his batsmen will look to dominate Harmison in the series. ?He (Harmison) is a big confidence bowler and we need to put him on the back foot,? Smith told a news conference. ?We?ve worked hard on facing fast bowling in our preparations and we?ve grown up on pace and bounce.? 

South Africa?s young team, ranked sixth in the world, cannot match England in terms of experience but Smith saw that as an advantage. ?We have a big unknown factor that could squash out the inexperience factor,? he said. 

Smith confirmed that left-arm spinner Nicky Boje, who is recovering from thyroid surgery, would withdraw from the squad and that fast bowler Dale Steyn would make his debut. 

There was more positive news about allrounder Jacques Kallis, who was unable to bowl in the Test series in India last month because of a side strain. ?It looks as if Jacques will be able to bowl, although we?re preparing as if he won?t be able to,? Smith said.

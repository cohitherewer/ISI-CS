The Telegraph - Calcutta

 McGrath: Couldn?t have hoped for a better start 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Glenn McGrath 

 Bangalore: Glenn McGrath 

 was forced to miss the last series against India, in 2003-04, 

 and so has been doubly keen to make a mark in this one. 

Well, he has done so quickly ? returning the best figures (four for 55) in the very first Indian innings. 

?I couldn?t have hoped for a better start in conditions tough for fast bowlers... I got wickets in each of my first two overs and Rahul Dravid?s (dismissal) was a pretty big moment for all of us,? he remarked during an interaction with the Media. 

McGrath accepted that the ball had been ?reversing?, thanks to the leather being scuffed on a distinctly barren wicket. 

 Later, talking to The Telegraph,he 

 confirmed a change in shoe (?low cut Puma?) actually made 

 a huge difference. ?The one I?ve been wearing here is much 

 lighter and I just seem to take off,? he said smiling. 

Irfan Pathan, by the way, pointed out he ?continued to learn? and that the biggest lesson in his first Test on home soil was rather telling: That ?bad deliveries? will be hit. 

 Indeed, yes.

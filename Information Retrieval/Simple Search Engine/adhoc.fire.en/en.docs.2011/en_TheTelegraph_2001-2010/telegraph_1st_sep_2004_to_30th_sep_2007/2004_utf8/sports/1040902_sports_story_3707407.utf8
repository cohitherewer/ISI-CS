 Pressure more in Italy: Voeller

Rome: Former Germany coach Rudi Voeller took charge of AS Roma on Tuesday following the resignation of Cesare Prandelli. 

Voeller flew into Rome, signed a one-season contract and immediately assumed control of the Serie A teams training session. 

Former Parma coach Prandelli, who replaced Fabio Capello during the close season, stepped down this month due to his wifes ill health. 

Ive come here because we are all in a tricky situation Im here to replace Prandelli and I will try to do that in the most professional way possible, Voeller told a news conference. 

I will try to help and I believe I know how to help. Ill do my best but I also know that involves having to win at least a match or two, maybe a few more than in Germany anyway. The pressure is higher here in Italy, he said. 

Voeller, who resigned as Germany coach after a disappointing Euro 2004, played for Roma between 1987 and 1992 and was the clubs first choice after Prandelli stood down. 

The 44-year-old, whose wife is Italian, represents something of a risk given his lack of experience in club coaching. Voeller took over the Germany squad in 2000 after working for four years as sports director of Bayer Leverkusen, who Roma face in this years Champions League. 

Two years later, he took an unfancied German team to the 2002 World Cup final where they lost to Brazil. 

Germanys elimination in the first round of Euro 2004, however, led to Voellers resignation. 

The German now faces the difficult task of getting the team into shape for the September 12 opening of the Serie A season. Obviously, it will be very difficult, there are several players away with their national team in the next week or so, he said.

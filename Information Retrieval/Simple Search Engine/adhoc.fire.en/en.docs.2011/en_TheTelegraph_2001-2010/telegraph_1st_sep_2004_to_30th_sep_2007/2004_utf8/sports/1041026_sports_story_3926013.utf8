The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Motivation problem for Bengal

A CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: In some inconsequential league matches of the 59 th Indian Oil Corporation (IOC)-Santosh Trophy, former champions Karnataka and Railways salvaged some pride with decisive victories in their group matches. 

Four-time champions Karnataka routed Sikkim, sans Bhaichung Bhutia 6-1 in a group B tie. In group C, Railways missed chances but managed to beat hosts Delhi 2-1. Holders Manipur and runners-up Kerala have already qualified for the semi-finals with an all win record from groups B and C, respectively. 

National selectors V.P. Sathyan, Brahmanand Shankhwalkar, Mohammed Afzal and Anadi Barua are recommending players of potential for the national camp, for the last World Cup qualifier on November 17 against Oman. The camp is in Delhi, from October 27. 

Man of the match, striker Dayanand scored three goals while other goals for Karnataka were scored by J. Murali, A. Xavier Vijay Kumar and M. Satish Kumar. For Sikkim, the lone goal was scored by Sisil Karthak in the 62nd minute. Railways could also have won by a larger margin but national team striker Ashim Biswas missed easy chances. 

Meanwhile, Bengal coach Syed Nayeemuddin is having injury and motivational problem on the eve of his group A league match against Uttar Pradesh. Custodian Abhijit Mondal is a doubtful starter due to a back injury. 

Others on the injured list are midfielder Noel Wilson, Amit Das and Dulal Biswas. Debjit Ghosh, who is not fully fit, would also like to be on the bench. As Madhab Das is ruled out after he got red card in the previous match against Services. 

Instead, Nayeem may use Habibur Rehman Mondal in the defence. Midfielders Amjad Hussain and Gouranga Dutta and goalkeeper Kalyan Choubey, who are yet to play in the tournament so far, may get a look in. 

Tuesday?s matches 

Bengal vs UP; Punjab vs Tamil Nadu.

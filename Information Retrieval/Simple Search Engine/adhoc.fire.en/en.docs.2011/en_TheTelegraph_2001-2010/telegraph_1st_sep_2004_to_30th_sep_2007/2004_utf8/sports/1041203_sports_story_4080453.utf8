The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Harishankar jumps to gold

A STAFF REPORTER

 Though he clinched gold, this wasn?t Harishankar?s best performance 

Calcutta: Bengal?s high-jump prodigy Harishankar Roy has scaled a new high. At the second Youth Commonwealth Games athletics competition in Bendigo, Australia, Roy clinched gold with a jump of 2.13m Thursday. 

According to information reaching here, the other Bengal entry in the championship, Rehmatullah Mollah, wasn?t too impressive in the 100m dash, finishing sixth. 

It wasn?t Roy?s best, though, not by far. His first superlative performance had been at the state meet when he jumped 2.2m, but that was not ratified because there were no Athletics Federation of India (AFI) technical officials present. Roy soon made amends for that, hitting 2.18m in the Chennai nationals that followed, setting a national record. 

He improved upon that quickly when he soared to 2.25m at the Asian All-Star meet in Singapore recently. That, ratified, will stand as the national mark. In comparison the 2.13m pales, but having been set for a gold at an international event, it stands out as another major milestone for the young athlete. 

India have sent their best promising athletes to this championship, in preparation for the next World Championships and the Beijing Olympic Games. Harishankar, AFI secretary Lalit Bhanot has said, is among those junior athletes on whom the national body?s eyes are fixed as great prospects. 

This is also the championship that sprinter (and middle distance) star of the state Pinky Pramanik could have been headed, had she not been involved in extraordinary circumstances.

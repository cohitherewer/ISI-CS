- Australia do not play the turning ball too well

London: India received a vote of confidence ahead of the Tests against Australia with former England captain Michael Atherton backing the hosts to win the four-match series starting on Wednesday. 

Atherton said although Australia had done well in the sub-continent in recent past, they were likely to crumble under pressure against the Indian spinners. ?The Australians tour the sub-continent more often than they used to, and they recently put Sri Lanka in their place with a 3-0 demolition in Sri Lanka,? Atherton wrote in his column in the Sunday Telegraph. 

?Nevertheless, I feel India?s incredibly strong batting will hold sway and, under pressure, Australia do not play the turning ball as well as they might. India is the hardest place to win. For this series, my money is on the home team,? he wrote. 

Atherton said though both the sides were not at their best in the Champions Trophy and Australia would be without Ricky Ponting, it would not take the gloss away from the series. 

?...These factors have not removed the gloss from what should be a compelling series. Such is the demand for Test cricket between these two teams that a planned one-day series was scrapped in favour of an extra Test match ? an extraordinary reversal of global trends,? he wrote. (PTI)

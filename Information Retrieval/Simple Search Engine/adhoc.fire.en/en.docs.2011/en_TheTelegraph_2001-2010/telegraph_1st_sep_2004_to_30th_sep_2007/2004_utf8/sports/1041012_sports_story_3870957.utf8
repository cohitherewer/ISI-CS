 Bengal favourites versus Mizoram 

Margao: Bengal, who have remained unbeaten so far, are the clear favourites to win the 27th sub-junior (under-16) national football championship title, when they lock horns against defending champions Mizoram in the final on Tuesday. 

Bengal, the only team to win all their group games, were given a scare by Meghalaya who missed a hatfull of chances before going down to a Sudip Banik goal in the semi-final. Mizoram, who beat Tamil Nadu by Zohmingliana?s goal in the other semis, lost their only match during the group stage to Bengal 0-3. 

?We have played well so far, winning all our matches. Now we need to conquer the last barrier which will make us feel proud,? asserted Bengal coach Ranjit Mukherjee. 

An optimistic Mizoram coach Vanlalngheta said: ?Every game is a new game. Now we play them again, they are a team we know everything about and we should be able to beat, if our team plays to its potential.? (PTI)

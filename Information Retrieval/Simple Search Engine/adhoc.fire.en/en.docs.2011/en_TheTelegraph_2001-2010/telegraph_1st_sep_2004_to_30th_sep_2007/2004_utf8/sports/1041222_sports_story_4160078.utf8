 Thorpe asked to make up mind 

 Ian Thorpe is fearful of burnout 

Sydney: Australia?s head swimming coach wants Ian Thorpe to make up his mind about competing at next year?s world championships in Montreal. 

Thorpe is considering skipping the championships to give his body a break so he can swim at his peak at the 2008 Olympics. 

But with the Australian selection trials less than three months away, new head coach Alan Thompson said it was time for Thorpe to make a decision. 

?Ian has got to decide what is the best way he can ensure he gets the best out of himself,? Thompson told Australian Associated Press on Tuesday. 

?He has got to do what is best for his performance, and if that (missing the world championships) is the best, then I will support that. 

?Ian has to make sure he gives us his best when it really matters. I would like to have Ian swimming at his best in 2008.? 

Thorpe has already won 11 gold medals at the world championships, more than any other swimmer in history. He became the youngest man to win a world title when he took the 400 metres freestyle as a 15-year-old in Perth in 1998. 

He won a record six gold medals at Fukuoka in 2001 and last year in Barcelona, he became the first swimmer to win the same event three times when he triumphed again over 400. 

The 22-year-old took two golds at this year?s Athens Olympics to add to the three he won in Sydney as a teenager, but is fearful of burnout. 

Thompson said it was up to Thorpe whether he swam at Montreal and although the Australian team would be severely weakened by his absence it would give other swimmers a chance for invaluable experience. 

?I think rather than look at the negative we should look at the positive and it will give younger guys to opportunity to come through,? Thompson said. 

?It is an opportunity for someone else, as opposed to someone not doing it.?

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Kumble on home stretch to 400

 - Our plans have been put in place? we have accounted for the noise and? wickets: Lehmann 

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI 

 Kumble feels both sides will start evenly 

Bangalore: Thirty-four months after becoming 

the first Indian spinner to break into the 300 Test wickets? club, on home turf, 

Anil Kumble is aiming for the three wickets that will catapult him into the 400-league. 

If all goes well, he should achieve that too at home ? the Chinnaswamy Stadium. In any case, the wicket is expected to be an ally. 

?I hope it won?t be on the very first day of the Test (against Australia)... After all, I would like our team to bat first... But, yes, quickly getting that milestone in front of family and friends is going to be great,? Kumble remarked. 

Speaking on Monday afternoon, he added: ?Of course, it isn?t that I?m under more pressure because I?m on the threshold of becoming the second Indian (after Kapil Dev) to take 400 wickets... Pressure is always there...? 

Asked whether India possibly enjoyed an edge in the (four-Test) series, Kumble responded: ?I feel both sides will start evenly... Having said that, I?m convinced we?re going to carry forward the confidence from the big Test series? last season...? 

Obviously, he was referring to the 1-1 draw in Australia and the 2-1 win in Pakistan. 

For good measure, Kumble emphasised the Indians ?respected? the Australians and that they ?must? now be better players of spin. 

Is there a formula, so to say, for getting the better of the No. 1 team? 

The usually intense Kumble laughed: ?Yes... For us to get 600 on the board, batting first, and then getting 20 wickets... Basically, one should play to potential and be better than the Australians.? 

Expectedly, Kumble had much praise for Shane Warne, who is poised to overtake Muttiah Muralidharan as the most prolific wickettaker in Tests. 

?Shane has been a wonderful ambassador for spin... A lot of people look up to him and I?m one of them... At some stage in the series, one does expect him to get past Murali,? Kumble pointed out. 

Warne is five adrift of Murali?s 532. 

Meanwhile, according to vice-captain Darren Lehmann, the Australians will take to the opening Test with confidence fuelled by their 1997-98 triumph here. 

?That victory (under Mark Taylor) hasn?t been forgotten... Yet, we realise India are a good side... Our plans have been put in place and, yes, we have accounted for the noise and the nature of wickets,? he observed. 

Lehmann confessed he was surprised on being named 

Adam Gilchrist?s deputy, but added both were essentially standing-in till Ricky 

Ponting returned ? in all probability before the third Test, in Nagpur, from October 

26. 

Postscript: Talking to The Telegraph, 

Team India coach John Wright saluted Kumble somewhat emotionally: ?He?s only a 

few wickets from a fantastic achievement... Anil is the type leaders are made 

of and the respect he enjoys is huge... Really, he has deserved each of the 397 

wickets already in his bag...?

 Bengal reach 206/6 on Day I

Viskhapatnam: Openers Deep Dasgupta and Arindam Das laid a solid foundation putting on 82 runs for the opening wicket as Bengal reached 206 for six on the opening day of the Ranji Trophy Elite Group A match against Andhra Pradesh at the ACA-VDCA stadium on Monday. 

Electing to bat after winning the toss, the two Bengal openers toyed with Andhra bowling and scored runs on either side of the wicket, with Das being the more aggressive. 

Dasgupta was out for 48 with nine boundaries, while Das made 69 off 187 balls with six hits to the fence. 

Ten bowlers sweated it out Andhra during the day. (PTI)

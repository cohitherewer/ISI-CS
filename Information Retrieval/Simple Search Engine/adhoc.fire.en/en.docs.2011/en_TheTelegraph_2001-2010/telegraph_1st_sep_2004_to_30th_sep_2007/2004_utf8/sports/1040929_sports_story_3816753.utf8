 Seville to host final

Madrid: Spain will stage the Davis Cup final against the United States in Seville rather than in Madrid after deciding the capital?s high altitude would give too much of an advantage to the big-serving Americans. 

The final, running from December 3 to 5, will be held at the Olympic Stadium of La Cartuja in the Andalucian city, with a capacity of around 22,000 spectators around a specially constructed, covered clay court. 

Madrid?s tennis federation had lobbied hard for the rights to stage the final to boost the city?s campaign for the 2012 Olympics but players and coaches vetoed the proposal, insisting on a venue at or near sea level. 

?Everyone was talking about Madrid because of the Olympics but there was a conflict of interests,? Spanish Tennis Federation president Agustin Pujol said on Tuesday. 

The concern among the team was that playing in Madrid would give too much of an advantage to Andy Roddick and the rest the Americans. 

?All the Americans serve like trucks,? Spanish captain Jordi Arrese warned after the semi-final win over France.

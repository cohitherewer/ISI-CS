 Anand enters last four

 - Corsica Masters

 Anand will face Etienne Bacrot in the semi-finals 

Bastia: World rapid chess champion Viswanathan Anand was on course for his fifth successive Corsica Masters rapid chess title as he stormed into the semi-finals. 

Top seed Anand, undefeated here since 2000, blanked Mikhail Gurevich of Belgium in the quarter finals to set up a last four showdown with Frenchman Etienne Bacrot. 

The other semi-final will be an all-Russian affair between Sergei Rublevsky and Alexnader Motylev, who registered upset wins over their higher rated opponents. 

In the first quarter final tie, Gurevich?s queen pawn advance was tackled by Anand through the Nimzo defence to clinch full point after 60 moves. 

With the colours reversed, the 34-year-old needed just 24 moves to move into the last four. 

Anand, who received a direct entry into the last 16 stage here, began his campaign with a draw against Sulava before outplaying his lesser known opponent in the second game to win the tie. 

Big upsets marked the day in the bottom half, where Alexi Shirov of Spain and last year?s finalist Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria were shown the door in the last eight stage. 

While Shirov was upset by Alexander Motylev in a tie-breaker after they were locked 1-1 in two matches, Sergei Rublevsky beat world No. 5 Topalov 2-0.

Rosario (Argentina): Germany and The Netherlands drew 1-1 and both advanced to the final of the women?s Champions Trophy hockey tournament. 

Both teams finished round-robin play on Saturday atop the standings with 11 points each, setting up a rematch of the final at the Athens Olympics, where the Germans upset the Dutchwomen 2-1 to take gold. 

Argentina, who played china, will meet defending champion Australia ? who beat New Zealand 3-0 ? for the bronze medal. 

The Netherlands pressed from the outset against a German team looking to counterattack. But imprecise passing and miscues left play mostly in the midfield throughout the first half. 

Fanny Rinner put Germany up 1-0 two minutes before halftime, off a penalty corner. 

In search of the equaliser to ensure a final berth, the Dutch pressure after the break finally told in the 47th minute when forward Ellen Hoog made a reverse shot off her own rebound. 

Germany will seek their first Champions Trophy title, while The Netherlands won previously in 1987 and 2000. 

Earlier, Jessica Arnold scored twice for Australia to beat New Zealand, leaving the New Zealanders to play for fifth against China in Sunday?s playoffs.

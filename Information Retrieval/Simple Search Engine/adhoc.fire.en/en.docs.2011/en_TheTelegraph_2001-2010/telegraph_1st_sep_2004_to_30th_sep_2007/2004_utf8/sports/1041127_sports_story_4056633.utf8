 Shoaib ready to make the ?difference?

 Shoaib Akhtar 

Karachi: Fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar said on Friday that he wanted to make an impact during Pakistan?s tough tour of Australia and would give his all for the team. 

?I want to make a difference because I don?t know whether I would get another chance to play in Australia,? Shoaib said. 

?I know it?s a tough tour for us but I want to show my ability because I have been waiting for this series for a long time. 

?I know pace is not what they (Australians) fear, you need to be accurate and take wickets with your aggression and I am up to it,? he added. 

The 29-year-old will spearhead Pakistan?s pace attack on the tour due to start with a warm-up one-day match in Perth on December 7. The three-Test tour begins on December 16 in Perth. 

Reminded of Australia?s superb batting against New Zealand in Brisbane in the current series, Shoaib said: ?At least we won?t allow bunnies like McGrath to score. 

?Our bowling is better than New Zealand and we will show that difference.? 

Since making his Test debut in 1997, Shoaib has taken 133 wickets in 33 Tests and 186 in 118 one-day games. But in seven Tests against Australia, Shoaib?s tally is an unimpressive 20 wickets while in 19 one-dayers against the world champions he has 29. 

?I know you make your mark from a big series like against Australia and I am anxious to do well, the whole team is willing to do that,? said Shoaib, whose team was routed 0-3 in both the last series against Australia. 

Now led by Inzamam-ul Haq, Pakistan face their first real test since starting to rebuild after their first-round exit from the World Cup in March last year. 

?This is the first Australian tour for many in the team but I don?t think it?s a weak team and people saying we would be thrashed is wrong,? said Shoaib, whose best Test figures against Australia were five for 21 in Colombo, two years ago. 

Then Shoaib unleashed a deadly spell in the second innings of Pakistan?s neutral venue series but Pakistan?s batsmen failed to make 137 with seven wickets intact on the last day. 

?That loss always haunts me...but now we have a world-class batsman in Inzamam who can win a match single-handedly,? said Shoaib. (AFP)

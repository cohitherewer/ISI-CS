Calcutta: Sourav Ganguly has welcomed the Board of Control for Cricket in India?s (BCCI) move to introduce the contracts system, which comes into effect from Friday, saying it will help improve the performance of the players. 

Speaking at a media conference to unveil Sourav?s ? The Food Pavilion on Monday, the Team India captain said: ?I accept it. It?s a forward looking step? a step in the right direction. 

?All teams except India and Pakistan had this contracts system. This is a good thing for Indian cricket. We now have a good system in place and know what is coming. The entire policy is based on performance and so you?ve got to deliver.? 

Sourav said that his decision to stay away from the gradation committee meeting on Sunday was in the best interests of the team. ?Whatever you do, disputes are bound to arise. I did not want to be part of that. 

?As captain I am answerable to the boys and I did not want anything to go wrong in the dressing room. I did not wish to be termed partial by somebody. We accept whatever has been done and we move forward from here,? Sourav said. 

He did not agree that the selection of 17 instead of 20 (the maximum number) reflected poorly on the pool of players available. ?The minimum criterion for players is three Tests or 10 ODIs and many don?t fit into the same. So? 

?In selecting 17, the committee has also sent out a clear message that whoever does well will be included. They have kept the options open and not shut the door on anyone.? 

Sourav did not want to comment on the forthcoming series versus Australia, saying the performances in the four-day match between India and India A, starting in Bangalore on Tuesday, would be taken into account during selection. 

He was all praise for Shib Shankar Paul. ?He?s very close to playing for the country. He has got the potential and got to keep performing.? 

The absence of Ricky Ponting wouldn?t make much of a difference. ?It?s not an advantage for us. They?re a good enough side for somebody else to take over.? 

Sourav felt the Champions Trophy was a ?fair tournament?. 

?The World Cup is your major one-day tournament. If you have a parallel meet running on similar lines, the glamour would be taken off the quadrennial showpiece. I wouldn?t want that to happen.?

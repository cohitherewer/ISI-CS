The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Aussie board may consider alternative to West Indies

Melbourne: Cricket Australia (CA) said on Thursday it could consider an alternative team to replace the West Indies in next year?s tri-series Down Under if the Caribbean side does not resolve a dispute over player contracts. 

Captain Brian Lara and 15 others were dumped on Wednesday from a 25-man preliminary tour squad because of their contracts with Cable and Wireless, a telecommunications rival of Digicel, which recently signed a multimillion-dollar sponsorship deal with the West Indies Cricket Board. 

Ramnaresh Sarwan, Wavell Hinds, Chris Gayle, Courtney Browne, Marlon Samuels and Corey Collymore are other front-line players involved. 

CA said it is monitoring the dispute, and could consider inviting anther country for the one-day tournament, starting in January. 

?At the moment we?re talking about hypotheticals, but if they don?t (agree) we will start thinking about alternatives,? spokesman Peter Young said. 

?If a week is a long time in cricket, then seven weeks is an eternity so it?s not on the radar just now.? 

Australia?s problems are compounded by a lack of alternative oppon-ents. 

Only Zimbabwe, rebuilding after the sacking of its best players, will be free over the first six weeks of next year. The Zimbabweans played in the Australian tri-series earlier this year. 

?That would be disappointing,? Australian captain Ricky Ponting said of the possibility of playing an under-strength West Indies side. ?You want to be playing the best teams you possibly can around the world. 

?Hopefully it will be sorted out and resolved and hopefully they do send out their full-strength side.? 

Meanwhile, in Tiruchirappalli, former Australian captain Steve Waugh described as unfortunate the sacking of Brian Lara and other top players from the West Indies team for the tri-series . 

?It is unfortunate that Lara and the others have been dropped from the West Indies team. Avid lovers of the game would have loved to watch such brilliant players in action. I hope the controversy will get sorted out,? he said.

 Harika lifts gold

 Negi lost steam in later stages 

Heraklion (Greece): Woman Grandmaster Dronavalli Harika annexed the world under-14 girls title after settling for a quick drawing in the 11th and final round against Gopiko Mirashivili of Georgia in the World Youth Chess Championships here. 

Also joining her in the medals list was national under-11 champion and India?s youngest International Master-norm holder Parimarjan Negi, who claimed the bronze medal in the under-12 boys? category. 

Negi scored a fluent victory over Tar Sahakyan Samvel of Russia in the last round to finish on nine points, behind the Chinese duo of Zhao Nan and Ding Liren who claimed the gold and silver, respectively, with an identical score of 9.5 points. 

For Harika the event turned out to be a cakewalk even though Anna Muzychuk of Slovenia caught up with her after her last round triumph. 

Having a half-point cushion to back her before the last game, Harika played it safe and signed peace with Mirashvili. Overall Harika won seven games and drew four to ensure her gold medal. 

Parimarjan had began his title challenge with a brilliant 6/6 start but a loss in the seventh round and a couple of draws towards the end proved costly for him. However, in his final assault, Parimarjan was in top form and defeated Samvel in an hour. 

Earlier in the 10th and penultimate round, Harika had scored a comfortable victory over Irina Gevorgyan of Uzbekistan while Parimarjan had drawn with Liren to stay in hunt for the medal. 

Mary Ann Gomes was the only other Indian after the penultimate round who had raised hopes of a medal after her fine victory over joint leader Purtseladze Maka of Georgia. After the victory Mary had jumped to joint second spot in the under-16 girls category but a loss in the final round against Joanna Majdan of Poland proved costly for her.

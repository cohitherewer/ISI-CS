 Giggs in search of international success

The words Ryan Giggs and failure sit uncomfortably together, so when the Manchester United winger leaves the visitors? dressing room on Saturday to face England, he will be looking to emulate some of his finest club form in this high-profile international match. 

 Giggs is United?s most decorated player ever, having won just about every honour going in more than 600 appearances for the club. Yet he remains fearful that his career will be incomplete without an appearance in the finals of a major international tournament. 

On Saturday against England, at his club home and against some players he regards as his best friends, Giggs will make his 49th appearance for Wales and, at the age of 30, his chances of leading his country to success are diminishing. 

?There have been a lot of highlights in my career,? said Giggs, ?and some of the performances we have produced at the Millennium Stadium have made me very proud, but a good result against England would top everything off.? 

?Ever since I?ve been in the team the aim has been to qualify for a major championship. The only way I can look at my career and be happy with it is if Wales qualify,? said Giggs, who captained England schoolboys before representing Wales at youth, under-21 and now senior level. 

One would presume that there are few players with more knowledge of how to stifle the England captain, but Giggs warned: ?A lot of people think they know Beckham?s game and the best way to deal with him, but they can?t do anything about it. That?s what makes him such an exceptional player.? 

In addition to Beckham and Butt, Giggs could face the Neville brothers, Rio Ferdinand, Alan Smith and United newcomer Wayne Rooney. And Giggs is only too aware of what Rooney is going through after emerging in similar fashion. 

?If you are the sort of player Wayne Rooney is? very laid back with massive confidence in his own ability? nothing surrounding his football will have an effect. He is at the best place.?

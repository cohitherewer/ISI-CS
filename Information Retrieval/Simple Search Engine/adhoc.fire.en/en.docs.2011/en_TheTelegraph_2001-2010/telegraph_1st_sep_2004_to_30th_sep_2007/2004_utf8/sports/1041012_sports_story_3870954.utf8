Quito: Ecuador striker Ivan Kaviedes, kicked out of the squad for indiscipline one month ago, celebrated his reprieve by notching the opening goal in a 2-0 World Cup qualifying win over Chile on Sunday. 

Mexican-based midfielder Edison Mendez added the second as Ecuador rose to fourth place in the South American World Cup qualifying group after a match which started one hour late because of a hailstorm. 

Kaviedes, who was sent home from a training camp before last month?s tie against Uruguay and did not make the trip to Montevideo, justified his recall with a superb individual strike in the 59th minute. 

The Crystal Palace striker eluded two defenders before slipping a clever shot through goalkeeper Nelson Tapia?s legs to break the deadlock for Ecuador, who reached their first World Cup finals in 2002. 

Kaviedes, who hit the winner when Ecuador beat Brazil for the only time in 2001 and the historic goal against Uruguay which clinched their place in the 2002 finals, nearly added another goal three minutes later but his shot was pushed away by Tapia. 

Substitute Paul Ambrossi set up the second with his first contribution of the game in the 64th minute as he burst down the right and crossed for Mendez to score from the edge of the area. 

Chile?s best chance came early on when striker Patricio Galaz broke clear of the defence but sent a weak shot wide of the post. 

The visitors sorely missed midfielder David Pizarro, who was left out of the squad by coach Juvenal Olmos for throwing a tantrum when he was substituted in last month?s goalless draw with Colombia. 

Ecuador have 13 points from nine games in the 10-nation group, which has now reached the halfway mark. Chile are fifth on 12 points. 

The Chileans have failed to win their last three matches and have not scored in their last two.

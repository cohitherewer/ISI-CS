 Big test for youngsters: Tirkey

New Delhi: The forthcoming Champions Trophy in Pakistan would offer an excellent opportunity for young players to establish themselves at the highest level, Indian hockey captain Dilip Tirkey said on Wednesday. 

?The Champions Trophy would be a big test for all of us, particularly the young players. They were outstanding in the series against Pakistan and we hope they grab the opportunity,? Tirkey said over the phone from Bhubaneswar. 

India, who finished seventh in the Olympics, earned a place in the elite six-nation event to be held in Lahore in December after Australia pulled out citing security reasons. 

?It?s a top competition with the best in the world competing for honours. It would provide the perfect exposure to the side which is being prepared keeping an eye on the future,? the 27-year-old defender said. 

Tirkey said though the team got a last-minute invitation, it has enough time for preparation. 

?We have close to two months to prepare, which I think is enough for a top-level competition. We would be having a camp very soon and a team would be picked for the series.? 

Drawing positives from the just-concluded eight-match test series against Pakistan, which India lost 2-4, Tirkey said the series was a step in the right direction. 

?The heartening factor is that whoever was given a chance, rose to the occasion. Pakistan wasn?t an easy opponent either. They had come with their best team. (PTI)

Calcutta: With three more rounds to go, there?s a neck and neck battle for the top spot between GM Abhijit Kunte of India and top seed, GM Aleksej Aleksandrov of Belarus in the International Open chess meet organised by Alekhine Chess Club. 

Both are well placed on 6.5 points, a point ahead of their nearest rivals, GM Ni Hua of China, Enamul Hossain of Bangladesh and GM Ehsan Ghaem Maghami of Iran. 

Kunte, playing white, beat GM Niaz Murshed of Bangladesh in the eighth round on Sunday. 

Hossain went down to Alexandrov with black pieces. 

Saptarshi Roy of Goodricke National Chess Academy held the Bangladeshi GM Ziaur Rahaman to a draw in 40 moves in a Modern defence. 

Roy, who is paired against GM Murshed in the ninth round, requires only a draw to earn his maiden IM norm.

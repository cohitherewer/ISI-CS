The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Pathan swings it at Eden

 - Kallis? unbeaten century steers SA to 227/5 after early jitters; Rudolph offers dogged resistance 

INDRANIL MAJUMDAR

 Jacques Kallis celebrates after reaching his century at the Eden on Sunday 

Calcutta: Slowly he made his way to the team bus, kit bag on left shoulder and the right hand trying to bring some order to the unruly locks hanging over his forehead. A gentle, almost sheepish smile hung on his lips as he waited for his turn to board the team bus at the end of the day. 

The anxious Eden Gardens crowd, waiting eagerly, burst into a roar, getting a glimpse of Irfan Pathan. The smile widened a bit, to an almost apologetic grin as his name seemed to echo in the vast expanse of the Maidan. Modesty hasn?t quite left the left-arm pacer even in the middle of his roaring success. 

Another Test match, another day, another venue, but success seems to follow him. His presence, besides lending balance to the Indian attack, can work wonders in bringing out the best in his teammates. Pathan has become a player comfortable with his gifts and hungry for challenge, two factors that separate the winner from the rest. Driven by ruthless ambition, he can cut a swathe through the best of batting orders with consummate ease. 

The sparse turnout, on the opening day of this Videocon Cup Test, never dampened spirits as his three-wicket haul along with Zaheer Khan?s two, managed to keep the South African run flow under check. Only Jacques Kallis with his unbeaten hundred, apart from Jacques Rudolph?s dogged brilliance, stood the challenge of the Indian pace duo. 

Zaheer was brilliant too, with his consistent line and ability to work up admirable pace on this slow wicket but, in the end, Pathan stood out with his diligence and discipline and was posing to be a greater threat with every passing spell. 

That the circumstances will help the seamers in the morning and evening at this time of the year was not unknown. The south-westerly winds from the Ganges, the cool climes, the moisture and the open surroundings will always aid seam and swing movement at Eden despite all the talk about the proliferation of concrete structures around the stadium. 

Not without reason Sourav Ganguly took the second new ball as early as after the 81st over. It was another matter, though, that play had to be called off six minutes before scheduled close and after 83.3 overs. An early start on Monday with make up for the time lost. 

Zaheer and Pathan were always going to be a handful, given the conditions. The hint of reverse swing in the afternoon session also helped the duo. The manner in which Zaheer bowled the well-set Rudolph was interesting. He fooled the batsman with an outswinger and brought back the very next delivery to leave him clueless. 

The pace duo prevented the visitors from putting the hosts under pressure after Sourav lost his fifth successive toss. The wicket is already showing signs of wear and tear with the dust and portions flaking. 

Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh may have been ineffective, but will surely make their presence felt. Their unwillingness in flighting the ball to make use of the turn proved to be their impediment. Kallis and Co., too, did their bit with clever use of feet and eagerness to attack the spinners. 

If Graeme Smith making himself available came as a surprise, he ensured that it didn?t cost India dear. He left to the second ball of the day, slashing at a wide Pathan loosener. Kanpur Man-of-the-Match Andrew Hall was snapped up by Zaheer a little later. 

Rudolph and Kallis then stitched 109 runs for the third wicket, the runs coming mainly through some intelligent placement initially followed by solid strokeplay. 

Quality control was the buzzword in Kallis? 17th century ? a typical demonstration of his indomitable will and enduring skill. The pumped fist and leap of joy on reaching his hundred signified its worth to him. Still going strong on 103, Kallis? early departure is sure to open the floodgates for an early end to their innings, feel the Indians. 

The one other visitor who made an impact was debutant Hashim Amla, the third South African after Lance Klusener and Herschelle Gibbs to debut at the Eden. 

Amla was the first victim during Pathan?s third spell, before removing Boeta Dippenaar. The Baroda medium-pacer will again hold the key to the important first session on the second morning.

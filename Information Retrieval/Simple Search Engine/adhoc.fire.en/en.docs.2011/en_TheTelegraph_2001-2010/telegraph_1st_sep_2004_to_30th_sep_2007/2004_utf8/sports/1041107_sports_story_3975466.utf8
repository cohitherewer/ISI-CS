 Paula to return at Big Apple

New York: World record holder Paula Radcliffe will race back into the spotlight at the New York Marathon on Sunday when she returns to action for the first time since her stunning collapse at the Athens Games. 

The 30-year-old Briton was last seen slumped over on the roadside in Athens sobbing uncontrollably after giving up 6 km from the finish in the Olympic marathon. But Radcliffe says she has put that disappointment behind her and is ready to replace those images with ones of celebration as she focuses on adding New York to her list of triumphs. 

?I put it behind me,? Radcliffe said. ?It was frustrating, but I?ve moved on.? (Reuters)

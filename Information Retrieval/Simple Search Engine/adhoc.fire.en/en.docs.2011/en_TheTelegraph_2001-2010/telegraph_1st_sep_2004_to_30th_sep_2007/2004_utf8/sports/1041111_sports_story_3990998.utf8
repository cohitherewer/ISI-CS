 Le Roux tips for SA team

Durban: The South African players must not think of the upcoming two-Test series with India as a nightmare but take it up as a challenge ? this is the advice of Adrian le Roux, India?s former fitness trainer. 

The South African also exhorted the players to adopt the ?right? attitude. 

?A cricket tour to India is different from anything you will experience anywhere else in the world. The people are fanatic cricket supporters. However, I believe any cricket squad should look forward to travel to India and arrive without reservations,? le Roux said. 

?The tour to India should be considered a challenge and you must come to terms with the difficult conditions as soon as possible. If you have the right attitude, you will make a success of the tour, but if you arrive there with the wrong attitude, it can become a nightmare,? he said on Wednesday. 

?John Wright will make sure his players are in the right frame of mind following their series defeat against Australia,? he said. 

Meanwhile, South Africa captain Graeme Smith may lead English county Somerset next May, provided he gets clearance from the UCB.

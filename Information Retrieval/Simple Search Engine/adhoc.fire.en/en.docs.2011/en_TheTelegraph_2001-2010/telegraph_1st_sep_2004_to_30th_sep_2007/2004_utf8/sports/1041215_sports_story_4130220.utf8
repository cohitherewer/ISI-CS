 Thorpe looks at past successes

 Thorpe feels he plays well under pressure 

Potchefstroom: England batsman Graham Thorpe says he will draw inspiration from past successes against South Africa as his team prepare for this week?s first Test in Port Elizabeth. 

?Obviously we would have liked more preparation, but we don?t have a choice after we played poorly against South Africa A,? Thorpe said on Tuesday. 

?In an ideal world, the batsmen would have liked to spend more time on the crease, but it?s important that we don?t get down on ourselves,? Thorpe said just before leaving for Johannesburg, where the England squad will board a flight for Port Elizabeth. 

?We?re going to have to dig deep into the memory banks and remember the times we?ve done well against them,? he added. ?I have played well at times, under more pressure, against South Africa, so I will draw on that.? 

The experienced left-hander scored a century against South Africa in his comeback Test at the Oval in 2003, 11 months after withdrawing from England?s tour of Australia for personal reasons. 

England slumped to a seven-wicket loss to South Africa A on Monday. 

?We lacked intensity and we need to rise to the level that South Africa will be at,? the batsman remarked. 

?We have two days in the nets in which to get mentally attuned and it?s most important that we focus on increasing our intensity. It is only then that we?ll have an excellent chance of putting South Africa under pressure. 

?We?re a fraction short of where we want to be and some of us will need to scrap really hard in the first Test. The key is not to panic. You have to create the balance between enjoying and wanting to win the game. Enjoying the game is very important.? 

?The good thing about not spending too much time at the crease is that I don?t know whether I?m in bad form or not,? he stated.

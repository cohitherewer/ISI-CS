The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Tour starts from Feb. 25

Karachi: Pakistan will tour India in February next year to play three Tests and five one-day Internationals, Pakistan cricket authorities said on Monday. 

?The Indian cricket Board has agreed in principle to host us from February 25 for a six-week tour with the Tests being played first,? Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Shaharyar Khan said. 

?They have also agreed to tour Pakistan in 2006 in the same period for a return visit,? he added. 

It will be Pakistan?s first Test tour to India since early 1999. 

Cricket ties resumed between the two neighbours last March when India broke a five-year deadlock and played five one-dayers and three Tests in Pakistan.

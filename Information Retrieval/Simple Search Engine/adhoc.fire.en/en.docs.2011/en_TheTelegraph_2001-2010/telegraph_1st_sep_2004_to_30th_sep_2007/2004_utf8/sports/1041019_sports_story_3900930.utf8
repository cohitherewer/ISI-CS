The Telegraph - Calcutta

 High-profile partner for Usha

 Usha 

Amby Valley: Morocco?s Nawal el Mouttawakel, the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics women?s 400m hurdles gold medallist, and P.T. Usha, who missed the bronze by a whisker in the same race, have come together for a project called ?Women in Sport in India?. 

Mouttawakel, the first African woman to win an Olympic gold and the vice-chairperson of the Laureus World Sport Academy, told a press conference on Monday that the two had met up again during the Athens Games and decided to start the project in 2005. 

?We met 20 years after we competed as rivals at Los Angeles. I won that race and unfortunately she didn?t. We met (again) during the Athens Games,? She said. 

?Thanks to the support we have got from Sahara and with the help of Laureus we are setting up the new Laureus Sport for Good Foundation in India.? 

Charlton surprised 

Meanwhile, English football legend Bobby Charlton on Monday expressed surprise as to why India have not made a mark in world football, while advocating the employment of good foreign coaches to improve the standard of the game in India. 

?I would be glad to see India doing well in football. I am surprised how a big country like yours has not been able to produce a national team of some substance. 

?One way out would be to employ good foreign coaches though that would cost a lot of money,? Charlton told reporters at the Laureus World Sports Academy?s forum. (PTI)

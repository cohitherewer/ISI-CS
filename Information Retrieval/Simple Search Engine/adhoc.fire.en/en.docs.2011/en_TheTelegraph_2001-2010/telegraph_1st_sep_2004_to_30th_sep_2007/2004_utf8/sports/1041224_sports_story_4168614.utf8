 Kulkarni, Powar put Karnataka on the mat

Mumbai: Mumbai spinners Nilesh Kulkarni and Ramesh Powar spun a web around Karnataka batsmen to skittle the visitors for a paltry 166 on the second day of the Ranji Trophy Elite group A tie on Thursday. 

Kulkarni took five for 39 with his left-arm spin, while off-break bowler Powar grabbed four for 70. The duo helped Mumbai take a handy 126-run first innings lead . 

Karnataka, who managed to send back the last two Mumbai batsmen after the hosts added only 19 runs to their overnight first innings score of 273 for eight, were shot out 20 minutes before close in 83.2 overs. They lost their last eight wickets for 50 runs. 

The visitors were sailing smoothly at 82 for no loss and then 116 for two in reply to Mumbai?s 292. Openers Barrington Rowland 43 (6x4, 1x6) and Robin Uthappa 39 (4x4, 1x6) gave them a good start before the duo perished in the space of four balls. They never fully recovered from the double strike and kept losing wickets thereafter.

 IOC clears Hamilton

London: Olympic time trial champion Tyler Hamilton has been cleared of any doping offence at the Athens Olympics, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said on Thursday. 

American Hamilton had been told he gave a positive A, or first, test for a blood transfusion in Athens on August 18, but the IOC clarified in a statement that the result of the B, or second, test was ?non-conclusive because of a lack of enough intact red blood cells?. 

Hamilton faced losing his gold medal if his B test at the Olympics had been positive.

 Shoaib Malik action reported

Lahore: Pakistan?s Shoaib Malik has been reported for a suspect bowling action in Saturday?s tri-series final, sources close to the team said. In another development, three Pakistani bowlers have apparently been verbally cautioned for tampering with the condition of the ball during the match, reports said. 

Umpires Simon Taufel and Aleem Dar reportedly spoke to the bowlers after they looked dissatisfied with the condition of the ball. Though Match Referee Jeff Crowe and the team management denied any bowler had been reported for ball-tampering, well-informed sources said a warning had been issued on the field. ?The umpires had a word with Inzamam-ul-Haq and cautioned the concerned trio not to change the condition of the ball,? sources were quoted as saying by a newspaper.

 Arunava, Amit shocked

Manesar (Haryana): Tenth seed Arunava Ganguly and 15th seed Amit Das of Railways Sports Promotion Board were shown the door while fifth seed Sourav Chakraborty survived a scare in the men?s first round of the national ranking table tennis (North Zone) championship here Friday. 

Ganguly was made to bite the dust by Maharashtra?s Aniket Koparkar while Das failed to overcome the stiff resistance of Pathik Mehta of Gujarat in a seven-set cliff-hanger. 

Mehta trailed his much fancied opponent thrice but kept his nerve to win 17-19, 19-17, 8-11, 12-10, 3-11, 11-8, 14-12. Koparkar had a relatively easy outing against Ganguly, prevailing 11-5, 7-11, 11-6, 11-8, 11-13, 11-5. Top seed Sharath Kamal received a walkover from Rahul Das of Bihar, while second seed Subhajit Saha, third seed Ranabir Das and sixth seed Soumyadeep Roy easily won their respective matches. (PTI)

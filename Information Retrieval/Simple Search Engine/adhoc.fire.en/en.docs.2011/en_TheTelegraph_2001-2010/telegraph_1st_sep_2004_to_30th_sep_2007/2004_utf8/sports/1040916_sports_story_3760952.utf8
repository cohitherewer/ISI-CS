The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Rise of Andrew the great

London: Penetrating the cheers and applause as Andy Flintoff saunters to the crease, a shrill note has resounded around English cricket fields. 

Signalling the arrival of the most dynamic England cricketer in a generation, scores of small boys whistle with unrestrained delight in anticipation of heroic deeds to come. 

?He strides the Test field like Beowulf among his retainers, ready to do battle with giants or monsters,? commented former England captain Mike Brearley. 

During the course of a glorious summer for the national side, Flintoff, derided as an overweight national joke four years ago, has become an international hero. 

Once a raw slogger out of his depth in international cricket, Flintoff now strikes the ball enormous distances and with massive authority. 

He is technically sound enough to score at close to a run-a-ball in any form of cricket without taking undue risks. His strength is such that he has already hit 44 sixes in Test cricket, more than halfway to the world record of 87 held by New Zealand?s Chris Cairns. 

Flintoff was born on December 6 1977; the year Ian Botham announced his presence on the international stage. 

Brearley provides an interesting insight into the respective career trajectories of Botham and Flintoff. ?I suspect Botham was the most complicated of the two,? he wrote. 

?He never quite came to terms with the demands of his varied jobs on his body. Nor did he quite make the transition from brilliant hitter to a frontline bowler. 

?Flintoff?s rise has a steadier feel to it. He has shown that he can modify his technique and learn from his mistakes. He seems to have accepted the need for intense physical training... we must wait eagerly to see how he does in the ultimate Test, against Australia.?

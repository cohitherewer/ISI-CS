The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Tour opener shifted to Mumbai

New Delhi: Australia?s opening match during their tour of India later this month has been moved to Mumbai following criticism of the original venue in Hyderabad. 

The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) announced on Monday that the three-day match from September 30 against Ranji Trophy champions Mumbai was being moved to the Brabourne Stadium. 

Media reports said two Cricket Australia officials, who visited Hyderabad a few days ago had been critical of the conditions at a new stadium in the southern city. 

BCCI secretary S.K. Nair said although the board felt the venue would be ready, it did not want to take any chances. 

The BCCI has also changed the team to face Australia, having originally named the Board President?s XI side. 

Australia will play four Tests in India.

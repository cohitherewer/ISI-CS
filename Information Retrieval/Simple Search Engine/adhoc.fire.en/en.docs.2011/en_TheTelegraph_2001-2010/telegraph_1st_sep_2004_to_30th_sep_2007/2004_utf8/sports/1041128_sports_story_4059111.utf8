 Chelsea trounce Charlton

London: Chelsea crushed Charlton Athletic 4-0 to go five points clear at the top of the Premier League, while Manchester United extended their winning run with a 3-0 victory at West Bromwich Albion on Saturday. 

Chelsea piled the pressure on defending champions Arsenal, who play Liverpool on Sunday, with an early strike by Irish winger Damien Duff. Two goals after the break from skipper John Terry and another from Iceland striker Eidur Gudjohnsen completed the rout. 

United, playing a West Brom side under new boss and former Old Trafford idol Bryan Robson, notched up a third consecutive league win and fifth in all competitions courtesy two goals from Paul Scholes and one by Ruud van Nistelrooy. 

Portsmouth?s first game since Harry Redknapp?s midweek resignation as manager ended with a 1-0 win at Bolton Wanderers, Southampton drew 2-2 with Crystal Palace and Birmingham City drew 1-1 with Norwich City. 

Blackburn Rovers moved off the bottom of the table with a 2-0 win at Fulham in the day?s early kick-off.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Of careers cut short

 Sanjib Dutta 

The Cristiano Junior tragedy is only the second such incident on Indian turf (and the first foreigner on Indian soil). The first such incident on Indian soil was involving a Railways midfielder, Sanjib Dutta, in 1993. He died off a collision in the Santosh Trophy in Kannur. The following is a list of onfield deaths: 

 Cristiano de Lima Junior 

 (Brazil) 2004 ? Striker and prolific scorer, was a constant 

 support for East Bengal last season before he moved to Dempo 

 of Goa. Here, too, he was the terror that he was with the 

 red-golds of Calcutta. Was scorer of both goals in Dempo?s 

 victory over Mohun Bagan in the Federation Cup final in 

 Bangalore. Clashed with Bagan goalkeeper Subrata Pal, collapsed 

 on the ground and died before he could be transferred to 

 the hospital. He was 24 years old. 

 Serginho (Brazil) 2004 ? The 

 Sao Caetano defender died in Sao Paulo, after suffering 

 an apparent cardio-respiratory arrest and collapsing on 

 the pitch during that Wednesday?s Brazilian championship 

 match against Sao Paulo. The match was abandoned after Serginho 

 (full name Paulo Sergio de Oliveira Silva), was taken to 

 hospital early in the second half of the game at the Morumbi 

 Stadium in Sao Paulo. Television pictures showed Serginho, 

 who celebrated his 30th birthday eight days ago, being carried 

 off as doctors from both teams tried to revive him. 

The Sao Luiz hospital said in a statement the player died 40 minutes after being brought in.. 

 Miklos Feher (Hungary) 2004 ? 

 The Hungarian international died after collapsing from a 

 heart attack in a Portuguese league game between his club 

 Benfica and Vitoria Guimaraes. 

 Marc-Vivien Foe (Cameroon) 2003 

 ? In perhaps the most high profile international onfield 

 death, the Cameroon midfielder collapsed and died during 

 a Confederations Cup semi-final against Colombia in France. 

 He was suffering from a heart-related condition. Sao Caetano 

 goalkeeper Silvio Luiz told television reporters that Serginho 

 had been found to have a heart condition during routine 

 tests at the start of this year. 

 Marcio Dos Santos (Brazil), 2002 - The 

 28-year-old striker died of a heart attack just hours after 

 scoring a goal for Peruvian side Deportivo Wanka. 

 Geovanny Cordoba and Hermann Gaviria 

 (Colombia), 2002 - The duo, of which the latter was a former 

 international, died after being struck during a training 

 session. A third player was struck by lightning and died 

 after a match in Ukraine the previous July. 

 Stefan Vrabioru (Romania), 2000 

 - The 26-year-old Astra Ploiesti player died on the way 

 to hospital following a fall just minutes after being brought 

 on for his first division debut against Rapid Bucharest. 

 Sanjib Dutta (India), 1993 - The 27-year-old 

 Railways midfielder died after an on-field collision in 

 the Santosh Trophy match against Andhra Pradesh in Kannur 

 on February 14. 

 Dave Longhurst (Britain), 1990 

 - The 25-year-old York City striker collapsed in a league 

 match against Lincoln City and passed away. An inquest revealed 

 he had suffered from a rare heart condition. 

 Samuel Okwaraji (Nigeria), 1989 

 - Collapsed 10 minutes from the end of a World Cup qualifier 

 against Angola in Lagos and died from cardiac failure. An 

 autopsy found the 24-year-old had an enlarged heart and 

 high blood pressure. 

 Oliver Petit (France), 1987 - 

 The 20-year-old brother of French international midfielder 

 Emmanuel Oliver died during a match playing for amateur 

 club Arques. 

 Erik Jongbloed (Netherlands), 1984 - 

 The DWS goalkeeper was killed by lightning during a match 

 in front of his father, the former national team goalie 

 Jan Jongbloed. 

 Fernando Pascoal 

 das Neves (Portugal), 1973 - The Porto player collapsed 

 and died during a league match - in the 13th minute of the 

 13th game of the season. 

 Constantin Tabarcea 

 (Romania), 1963 - The 26-year-old Petrolul Ploiesti player 

 died after collapsing during a first division match. 

 John Thompson (Scotland), 

 1931 - The 23-year-old Celtic and Scotland goalkeeper dived 

 at the feet of Rangers forward Sam English in Glasgow and 

 suffered a fractured skull. He died later in hospital without 

 regaining consciousness. 

 Note - One of the most infamous soccer deaths 

 of recent years did not happen on the pitch, but as a direct 

 result of what happened on it. Andres Escobar (Colombia, 

 1994) scored an own goal in Colombia?s 1-2 defeat to the 

 US in the 1994 World Cup finals and was murdered soon after 

 returning home to Colombia by a hitman. (Agencies)

The Telegraph - Calcutta

Sub-standard wicket backfired on India

StumpVision

Ian Healy

The Indian top order in the first Test was guilty 

on many counts. No runs, no intent to score, looking unbelievably tentative and 

not providing sufficient time for the team?s spinners to relax between innings.

Relaxation is crucial but more important is physiological 

recovery before they have to bowl long spells again. Time for muscles to recover, 

fluid levels to be replenished, sore feet to abate, spinning joints to loosen 

before they start to think about batting let alone bowling a second time.

Their top order is not providing them with enough 

time to shower, let alone relax. They won?t last if this continues or if they 

make it through the four Tests, they will not be effective.

Both spinners are returning from freshening breaks. 

Surgery to Harbhajan and not too much cricket for Kumble have them in good shape 

for this series but the pressure they both bowled under in this Test was incredible. 

They certainly have not been allowed to re-enter at their own tempo. Both men 

had the task of keeping the runs down and removing Australian batsmen ? a combination 

which so rarely happens. 

The Aussies love seeing off fruitless spells by opposition 

strike bowlers and it won?t get any easier from here, so the Indian batsmen have 

to take responsibility. Their bowlers? spells will not get shorter, so the rests 

in between must be larger. Both spinners are playing under huge expectations without 

a great deal of form under their belt.

Radio commentators have already questioned Kumble?s 

shoulder, saying he does not have his usual zip and rip. This is unfair and harsh, 

because it is the variable bounce of wearing Indian pitches that provides the 

rip for him. This pitch died and rarely spat at the batsmen?s unsuspecting splices, 

which would never help his style.

Harbhajan came into his own during the second innings 

but Australia had no inclination to be patient. When they need to be, the left-handers 

can continue to pad him away unless he develops a liking for bowling around the 

wicket.

One must mention the state of the pitch produced for 

such an important fixture. It was sub-standard and backfired on Indian cricket 

due to losing of the toss. Someone in Indian cricket made a massive error of judgement 

regarding this pitch.

Did they underrate Warne so badly, not know about 

the quality reverse swinging skills of all the Aussie quicks or refuse to recognise 

the impressive performances of Australian batsmen in Sri Lanka early this year. 

Bad move. 

The questions that I posed about the Australians have 

all been answered emphatically. Glenn McGrath can finally say he is back to his 

best and actually mean it. He penetrated like a surgeon and never let up. Pace 

accompanied the penetration and so did economy. A performance of the highest order.

Warne was an admirable workhorse who never complained 

during his toil. He did not extract enough bounce to partner his sideways spin 

but he will when he makes the relevant technical adjustments to his action. There 

is plenty more of him to come ? look out. McGrath?s dominance released potential 

stresses from Gillespie and Kasprowicz who revelled in the conditions provided.

Maybe once before has a Gilchrist century been second 

fiddle. This Test saw the second time. The supreme composure on debut of Michael 

Clarke, matched by flawless shot selection and skill to execute them, had us focussed 

on the other end from the Aussie keeper for longer periods than ever before.

 Healy feels Indian top-order failed to use Harbhajan-Kumble 

plinth

I have said Clarke has debuted two years later than 

he should have. It has not hurt him at least, his absolute hunger for performance 

was obvious. Batting at a time when a false shot could possibly be excused, he 

nailed it. The bowlers were on a roll, the crowd in full voice and even commentators 

contemplating a collapse and here Clarke began a long career. The best Test debut 

in the history of our Australian game with the bat. 

Naturalness is crucial at this level of play and India 

forfeited their?s immediately on Day I, when pushed back continuously by gutsy 

Aussie partnerships. No Indian played like a potential winner until it was over. 

This needs rectifying if they wish to compete, let alone emulate 2001.

Skill, endurance and patience played major roles in 

a tremendous Australian victory but what I loved the most was the absolute togetherness 

the team demonstrated. There were plenty of tough times but they were there as 

a team urging, lifting or just plain toiling.

The spirit of the baggy green is talked about often 

and I hate it. Loud and clear it came through to me, that the Aussies are here 

to do something special and now it will take even more stopping than one week 

ago. The message was delivered to me non-verbally and I?m sure a copy has been 

sent to the Indian dressing room! (PTI)

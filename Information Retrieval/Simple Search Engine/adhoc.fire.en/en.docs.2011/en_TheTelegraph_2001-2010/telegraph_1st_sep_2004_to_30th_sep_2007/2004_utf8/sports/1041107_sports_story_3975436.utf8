The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Aussie, English media slam wicket

 Murali Kartik took seven wickets 

Sydney/London: The wicket at Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai was slammed as ?heavily doctored? and ?under-prepared? by the Australian media which nevertheless had little sympathy for their team?s defeat in the fourth and final Test against India. Joining up was the English media, which called the victory a famous one, but ?achieved on an infamous pitch.? 

The track was also scorned as ?spiteful?, ?sub-standard?, ?dustbowl? and ?stinker? in the leading Australian dailies Saturday but was not used as an excuse for Australia?s defeat. ?Admittedly the pitch was a stinker but that does not excuse an appalling display by the world champions. Unwilling to defend and unable to attack with any semblance of reason, the Australians threw wickets away with a series of ill-advised strokes,? wrote Peter Roebuck in the Sydney Morning Herald. 

?...The Australians made a complete hash of chasing a target that ought to have been reached for the loss of a few wickets,? he said. 

Australia failed to chase a paltry target of 107 as India snatched a narrow 13-run win in Mumbai on Friday. 

A report in the same daily said Australia?s dreams of a 3-0 series victory over India vanished in the dust of the Wankhede Stadium?s controversial pitch. ?Madness followed madness. It was the collapse of defensive skills that cost the visitors dear. Ricky Ponting?s men batted without any hint of patience or soft hands. None of the batsmen put a high enough price on his wicket,? it said, while writing how a ?reluctant spinner? (Michael Clarke) had earlier destroyed a determined opponent. 

A report in the Sun Herald said the under-prepared pitch would have created enormous controversy had this been the deciding match of the series. ?Although Australia won the series 2-1 to regain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, India retrieved a measure of pride in a dramatic turnabout in fortune late on the third day,? it said. ?Australia?s frailty in fourth-innings run chases was exposed as India ripped through them in 30.5 overs.... None of the Australians was able to withstand the Indian onslaught on a dusty, spiteful wicket.? 

In a report headlined ?Dust to Dust? in The Daily Telegraph, Robert Craddock wrote that one of Australia?s most stunning bowling performances of all-time was blotted out by one of their most embarrassing losses in a Test match turned mad. 

?Australia lost a pulsating fourth Test against India and were re-acquainted with their dead rubber syndrome after being bowled out for 93 in 30.5 overs, chasing 107 for victory on a Mumbai dustbowl,? he wrote. 

?It was the worst botched chase in Australian cricket history. No Australian side had faltered in reaching such a modest ask...? 

?Australia took to the batting crease and tried to get the runs quickly before the dusty, sub-standard deck got them. Every Australian wicket produced progressively wilder crowd scenes with jubilant Indian bowlers dancing and gliding like aeroplanes in celebration as a Test match was reduced to a frenzied shootout,? wrote Craddock. 

?Stands which were half empty three hours before were suddenly full and shaking as Australia lost their patience and their nerve against India?s potent three-man spin attack of Harbhajan Singh, Murali Kartik and Anil Kumble in devilishly tough conditions.?The English reaction was also vitriol. The Guardian reported: ?The biggest contributor to India?s 13-run victory was a truly awful pitch? It was so conducive to spin, as it had been from the start, that even the young and part-time trundler Michael Clarke returned the remarkable analysis of 6.2-0-9-6. So it was hardly surprising that Australia fell short (of a modest target of 107),? the newspaper said. The Times said: ?This was a famous win by India but it was achieved on an infamous pitch.? 

The Guardian, though, also said that ?Australia may be the finest cricket team in the world but they are the worst chasers since the Keystone Cops.?

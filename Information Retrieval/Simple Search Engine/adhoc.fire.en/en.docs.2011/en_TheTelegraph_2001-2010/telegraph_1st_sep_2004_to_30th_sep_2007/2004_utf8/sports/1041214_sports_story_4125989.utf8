Madrid: Real Madrid?s Primera Liga match against Real Sociedad was abandoned on Sunday with the scores level at 1-1 after police received a warning that a bomb would explode at the stadium at 2000 GMT. 

Close to 70,000 fans together with players and officials from both clubs evacuated the Bernabeu stadium a short time after Basque newspaper Gara had received the warning phone call in the name of the Basque separatist group ETA. 

Police searched the stadium with sniffer dogs but no explosive device was found in the vicinity of the stad- ium. 

?The police have said they have completed their search and have not found anything,? Real Madrid president Florentino Perez told reporters. ?The best thing we can all do now is to put this nightmare behind us. The police said the threat was a credible one and that?s why we decided to evacuate the stadium a quarter of an hour before the deadline. The evacuation plan worked to perfection.? 

Real Madrid will play the final seven minutes of their league match against Real Sociedad on January 5. 

Representatives of Madrid and Real Sociedad agreed at a meeting at the Spanish football federation on Monday to play the remainder of the match at 6.00 pm on January 5. 

Ticket holders from the original match will be able to watch the seven remaining minutes of play, including four minutes of injury time. 

If the result remains at 1-1, Real will have dropped to fourth place in the standings, 11 points behind leaders Barcelona, who snatched a late 2-1 win at Albacete on Saturday. 

Household names including David Beckham, Ronaldo, Roberto Carlos and Michael Owen were all on the pitch at the time the match against the Basque side was abandoned. 

The players left the stadium in their kit and had to wait in the street before being allowed to return when the police had given the all-clear. 

ETA has targeted the Bernabeu stadium before. In May 2002, an ETA car bomb exploded nearby hours before a European Champions League semi-final between Real Madrid and Barcelona and 17 people were treated for shock or slight injuries. ETA had warned of that attack in a call to Gara. 

Real took the lead just before the break when Brazilian striker Ronaldo cracked home with his left foot after controlling a Michel Salgado cross with his chest. 

Sociedad levelled the match midway through the second half when Turkish striker Nihat Kahveci smashed home with an acrobatic finish. 

Catalans Espanyol moved into second place in the league after giving an assured performance in their 2-1 victory at home to struggling Real Mallorca. 

Earlier Valencia had put their European woes behind them to notch their fourth Primera Liga win in a row with a 1-0 victory at home to basement side Numancia. 

The win put Claudio Ranieri?s side ? who exited the Champions League midweek ? into third spot in the table, 10 points behind Barcelona. 

In Milan, AC Milan crushed Fiorentina 6-0 at the San Siro with Andriy Shevchenko and Clarence Seedorf scoring two goals each. 

The Italian champions still remain four points behind leaders Juventus, who won 1-0 at Bologna. 

Ukrainian Shevchenko took his season tally to 11 goals as Milan turned in their best performance of the season. 

Juventus needed a superbly struck 86th minute free-kick from the winner of last years Golden Ball, Czech Pavel Nedved, to win at Bologna and maintain their advantage over Milan before the two teams meet at the Delle Alpi stadium on Saturday. 

Inter Milan drew for a remarkable 12th time in 15 games with a late Christian Vieri strike giving them a 2-2 draw away to lowly Siena, who had defender Stefano Argilli sent off in the 57th minute. 

Brazilian Adriano, who had opened the scoring, missed a 59th minute penalty and Tore Andre Flo?s 87th minute header looked to have given Siena a 2-1 win until Vieri struck in injury time. 

AS Roma also left it late ? a penalty deep in injury time from Brazilian Mancini giving them a 1-0 win away to Brescia. 

Chelsea hold Arsenal 

In London, Premier League leaders Chelsea twice came back from a goal down to hold champions Arsenal to a 2-2 draw in a pulsating encounter at Highbury (as reported in Monday?s Late City edition). 

Goals from Chelsea captain John Terry and striker Eidur Gudjohnsen cancelled out two strikes from Thierry Henry, who played superbly only to miss a clear chance to grab all three points for his team 13 minutes from ti-me. 

Chelsea stay top after 17 games with 40 points, four ahead of Everton who are a point better off than Arsenal after beating Liverpool 1-0 in Saturdays 200th Merseyside derby. Manchester United are fourth with 30 points. 

Earlier in the day, Aston Villa?s unbeaten home record disappeared in the worst way possible as they were outplayed and lost 1-2 to Birmingham City.

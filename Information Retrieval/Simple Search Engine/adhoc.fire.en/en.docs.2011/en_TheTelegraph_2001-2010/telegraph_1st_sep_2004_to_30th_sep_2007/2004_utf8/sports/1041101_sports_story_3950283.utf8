 Touching send-off for Pesi on season?s last day 

 HONKY DORY

 Jockey Pesi Shroff, who had announced his retirement plans about 10 days ago, was given a touching send-off at the Pune races on Sunday, the concluding day of the 31-day season. The atmosphere in the paddock area was so charged with emotion during the lap of honour that the entire racecourse desired to kiss, hug or shake hands with the jockey. Pesi did not disappoint many.

 It has been a long journey from My Squaw, Pesi?s first winner as an apprentice in the year 1981. He has booted home more than1700 winners from about 5,000 rides in his illustrious career with an enviable strike-rate. His record classic haul of 106 also includes 30 Derby wins. Pesi will start training horses during the Mumbai season which begins from November 18.

 Jockey B. Prakash was also honoured on the day for achieving the 1,000 winners landmark during the recently concluded Mysore season.

 Narrendra Lagad emerged as the champion trainer during the season with 28 wins while C. Rajendra claimed the top-jockey honours (29 wins). Apprentice Anil Baandal was adjudged as the champion jockey claiming allowance.

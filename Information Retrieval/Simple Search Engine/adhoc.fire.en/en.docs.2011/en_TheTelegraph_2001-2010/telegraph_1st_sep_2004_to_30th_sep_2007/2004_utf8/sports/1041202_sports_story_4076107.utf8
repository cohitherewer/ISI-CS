 Six-month ban on Rashid Latif

 - Ex-captain rues conceding domestic match 

 Latif says the ban will ruin chances of a Pakistan comeback 

Karachi: Former Pakistan skipper Rashid Latif was banned for six months on Wednesday by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) for conceding a domestic match while captaining his team Karachi Blues. 

?The chairman of the PCB has taken serious note of the breach of playing conditions by Rashid Latif and given his past record has decided to impose a fine of $250 on him and ban him for six months from all first-class cricket,? PCB spokesman Abbas Zaidi said. 

The 36-year-old Latif, leading the Karachi side in a match in Faisalabad, declared his team?s innings on 40 for four and conceded the match saying the pitch was too dangerous. 

Latif, who has played 37 Tests and 166 one-day Internationals, captained Pakistan until November 2003. 

Latif described the decision as ?very harsh? and said he would appeal. 

?I regret my decision and I may have acted impulsively but still such a ban will destroy any chances of a Pakistan comeback for me and ruin my career,? he said. 

?I acted purely out of concern for my players and spoke to the match officials about the condition of the pitch. The board didn?t seek my viewpoint while making its inquiry,? he added. 

Latif is out of contention for the Test series in Australia and next year?s tours of India and the West Indies. 

Latif has been no stranger to controversy during his career, which started in 1992. 

Among other incidents, he accused teammates of being involved in match-fixing in 1995, was banned for five one-day matches for wrongly claiming a catch in a game against Bangladesh last year and has criticised PCB selection policies.

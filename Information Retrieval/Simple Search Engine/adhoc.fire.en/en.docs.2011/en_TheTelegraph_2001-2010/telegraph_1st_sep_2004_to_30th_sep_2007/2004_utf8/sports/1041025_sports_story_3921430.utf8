The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Stage set for Gopichand comeback 

Hyderabad: The Asian satellite badminton championship, beginning at the Gachibowli Indoor Stadium on Monday, provides a perfect stage for former All England champion P. Gopichand to stage a comeback into the main circuit. 

Gopichand, who was out of action in some of the major national and international events due to knee injury, looks fit and is raring to go with the advantage of playing on home turf in the eight-nation championship. 

With the quick and powerful China, Malaysia and Korea not taking part, India have to grapple with Thailand and Indonesia to aspire for laurels. 

Gopichand, who has the record of fighting injuries to win titles as he had done during the All-England Championship, has a good chance to bounce back into limelight. 

National champion Chetan Anand, returned from Indonesia after a month-long training and looks fit and the women?s team will have in its ranks doubles champions Jwala Gutta and Shruti Kurien besides Trupti Murugunde and Manjusha Kanwar. 

Winner of the $10,000 tournament will get 180 points, runner up 150, semi-finalists 120 and quarter finalists 90. 

THE INDIANS IN MAIN DRAW 

Men: P. Gopichand, Chetan Anand, Abhin Shyam Gupta, Utsav Mishra, Thomas Kurien, Anup Sridhar, J.B.S. Vidyadhar, Hemant Duggal, Sachin Ratti, Jaseel P. Ismail, V. Diju, Sanove Thomas, Rupesh Kumar, A. Pridvi, Marcos Bristow and Jaison Xavier. 

Women: Trupti Murugunde, Sruthi Kurien, C.H. Deepthi, B.R. Meenakshi, Manjusha Kanwar, Aditi Biswas, Jwala Gupta, Krishna Deka Raja, Fatima Nazreen, Sarada Govardini and Dhanya Nair.

 Justine not sure what to expect

 - Australian Open

 Justine Henin-Hardenne feels the illness has taken a toll on her 

Charleroi (Belgium): Former world No. 1 Justine Henin-Hardenne says she is ready to defend her Australian Open title next month but admits she does not know what to expect following her recent illness. 

The Belgian was top-ranked in the world after winning in Melbourne, 11 months ago, but was then laid low by a viral condition that sapped her energy and left her exhausted. 

She did make a temporary comeback to win Olympic gold in Athens, but was hit by the illness once again and withdrew from the circuit. 

The build-up to the Australian Open will mark her competitive comeback and she insists that her motivation remains intact. 

?I will be heading to Australia with a lot of question marks over me. I know that,? she said after losing 2-6, 5-7 to France?s Nathalie Dechy in an exhibition match in Charleroi on Saturday. 

?But I think there will be less pressure on me than last year, even if I am the defending champion. 

?Above all, the first games will matter most. They will be very important for me.? 

Henin-Hardenne said she was confident she had put the viral illness behind her but admitted it had taken its toll on her fitness. 

?Physically, it?s obvious that I hit rock bottom,? she said. ?Since April, with exception of the Olympics, I have not done much. 

?All the successes I had prior to that was mainly due to the work I put in on building up my fitness. 

?Now it?s time to get back to putting in 200 percent effort and I think I am capable of doing that.? 

She did, however, add that her time off had helped her to put things into perspective and appreciate other things in life than tennis. 

?I don?t have to prove myself to anyone now. I just want to go out and enjoy myself,? she said.

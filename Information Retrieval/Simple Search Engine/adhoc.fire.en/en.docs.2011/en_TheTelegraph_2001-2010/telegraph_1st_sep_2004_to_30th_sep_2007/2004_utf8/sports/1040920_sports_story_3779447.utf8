 Harmison rules himself out 

 Harmison decision due to political and sporting reasons 

London: England pace bowler Steve Harmison has ruled himself out of November?s controversial tour of Zimbabwe. 

Harmison said he had decided to boycott the trip for political and sporting reasons. 

?In all honesty my decision was made in Cape Town over 18 months ago when England?s World Cup squad spent an horrendous four days before finally deciding not to go to Harare,? Harmison told News of the World on Sunday. 

?Nothing has changed for me. The situation there is worse now ? that?s what the official reports say ? and Zimbabwe?s top players have been sacked. Being a personal decision, I realise I could be the only player who does not go. I?ll respect what everyone else decides but I hope my refusal is not held against me. 

?I?m grateful the ECB said that not touring will not be held against any player.? 

November?s series consists of five one-dayers and no Tests. The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) said the tour will go ahead subject to it being safe and secure and that all England players have been asked to make themselves available. 

?Steve Harmison is the only player to have informed the Board that he will be unavailable for the tour,? an ECB statement said. 

?The ECB has previously stated that any player who makes himself unavailable to tour Zimbabwe for reasons of personal conscience will not be penalised and this remains our position.?

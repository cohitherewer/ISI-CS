 Players more hungry than ever: Sourav

Chittagong: Team India captain Sourav Ganguly on Thursday said his record-breaking batsmen and bowlers were more hungry than ever before. 

?It is difficult. The seniors have played eight to 10 Tests this year and don?t want to sit out. It is very difficult to give somebody rest when he doesn?t want it,? Sourav said on the eve of the second Test at the M. A. Aziz Stadium on Thursday. 

The Indian captain also reiterated that his boys were not in the team for merely improving their individual records. 

?It doesn?t work that way in a Test match. In the first Test, there was only one century and the last time (Bangladesh?s inaugural Test in 2000) we played against them, there were only two big scores,? he said. 

The top order might not have exactly clicked when the team was reduced to 36 for three in the only innings of the series so far, and the current season in general, but Sourav chose to look at the issue differently. 

?We withstood the new ball early on and did well to get to 500 and then bowl them out twice,? he said. 

?We have got totals of above 400 in recent matches. If the ratings are read as they are, we have been the best Indian team in many years.? 

Bangladesh have their problems compounded with medium-pacer Tapash Baisya being a doubtful starter with a sour back. 

Captain Habibul Bashar said he hoped that by Friday morning the right-arm bowler would have recovered. 

Bashar said he wanted the team to put up a fight. ?Our primary goal is not to gift wickets to the new ball.?

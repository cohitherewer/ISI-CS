 Murali comeback

New Delhi: World?s highest wicket-taker Muttiah Muralidharan is hopeful of being fit in time for Sri Lanka?s tour of New Zealand in December, contrary to some reports which suggested that his comeback may be delayed. 

In fact, the off-spinner, who has 532 Test wickets to his credit, has stepped up his rehabilitation programme to expedite his return to the game. 

Muralidharan, who is using the lay-off prompted by a shoulder surgery to indulge in some charity work, currently visited England and Canada in connection with a global fund-raising mission for a charitable trust. 

He will return to Sri Lanka next week and then fly to Australia in mid-November for a check-up with Dr David Young, the surgeon who operated on his bowling shoulder in August. 

Although he has stepped up his rehab programme, he will not resume bowling until after his meeting with Dr Young.

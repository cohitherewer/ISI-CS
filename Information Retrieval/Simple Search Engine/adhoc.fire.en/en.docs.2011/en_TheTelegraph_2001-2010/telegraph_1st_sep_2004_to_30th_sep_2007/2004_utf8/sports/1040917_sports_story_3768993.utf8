 Delhi to host Santosh Trophy 

 A CORRESPONDENT 

New Delhi: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) has decided to stage the twice postponed Santosh Trophy in Delhi from October 14-31. The tournament was originally to be held in Kerala in May 2004. 

The All India Football Federation of India (AIFF) president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi said Kerala had backed out stating unavailability of grounds. The Santosh Trophy was then offered to Tamil Nadu and later Andhra Pradesh but both expressed their inability to stage the tournament. 

As the AIFF elections are due in December 2004, the office-bearers felt they would face a lot of flak if the senior national championships were not held for two consecutive years. It was last staged in Manipur in October-November 2002. 

The AIFF hence decided to allot the Santosh Trophy to Delhi and will sanction the Delhi Soccer Association (DSA) a sum of Rs 25--30 lakhs for staging the tournament. All this will be ratified at a working committee meeting in the capital on Saturday. 

The national championships were last held in Delhi 60 years ago in 1944. The DSA secretary, Narender Kumar Bhatia said that the 32 participating teams, including holders Manipur, runners-up Kerala, Bengal and Goa will be divided into equal groups and the group winners will advance to the quarter final knock out stage.

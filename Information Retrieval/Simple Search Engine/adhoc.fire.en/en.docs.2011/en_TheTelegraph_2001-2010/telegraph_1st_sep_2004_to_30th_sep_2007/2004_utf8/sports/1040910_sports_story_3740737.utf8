 ICC awards a farce: Arjuna

 Arjuna Ranatunga feels Murali should have been picked ahead of Warne 

Colombo: The omission of highest Test wicket-taker Muttiah Muralidharan from the ICC awards list made it a ?farce and a joke,? according to Sri Lanka?s former World Cup-winning skipper Arjuna Ranatunga said on Thursday. 

Sri Lanka?s star spinner Muralidharan did not get a berth in the Test Team of the Year announced at the inaugural award function Tuesday night in London, but the man who is trailing him ? Australian Shane Warne ? was included. 

?You expected better from a respected panel of judges,? Ranatunga said. ?They said they looked at the performance of players in the past year, but that does not appear to be the case. 

?This is a farce. It is a joke to leave out Murali and select Warne. People will have doubts about (the credibility of) the ICC. The performance of Murali in the past year was far ahead of Warne.? 

Ranatunga, who led Sri Lanka to World Cup triumph in 1996 and is now deputy minister of tourism, said he believed the ICC selections had been ?very biased.? 

The only Lankan to make it to the ICC Test team and the ODI squad was paceman Chaminda Vaas.

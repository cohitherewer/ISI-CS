The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Sehwag will be back as opener

 - India most likely to revert to seven-batsman formula 

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI 

John Wright

London: Virender Sehwag, who batted at No. 4 in Sundays NatWest Challenge game, is going to return to an openers slot in the Champions Trophy which gets underway on Friday. The other opener will, of course, be Team India captain Sourav Ganguly. 

Yesterday was just a one-off (with V.V.S. Laxman being promoted)... Veeru hadnt been getting runs, as an opener, and we felt hes going to be better off in the middle-order... That a change was needed... Only, that wont be repeated, Sourav (MoM in the game) told The Telegraph on Monday evening. 

Sehwag, who failed at No.4 too, himself said he wanted to continue as an opener. Ek bad patch aa gaya hai, but theres nothing I want to do more than open, he pointed out during a brief interaction at the team hotel, the Victoria Park Plaza. 

Seeming unfazed, Sehwag added: This lack of runs hasnt shattered me... This can happen to anybody and, indeed, may happen more than once in somebodys career... Im biding time and, hopefully, things will be fine in the Champions Trophy... 

Asked about handling the pressure associated with failure, Sehwag replied: Main jyada nahin sochta hoon... Nor do I listen to everybodys advice... Ive been studying videos and, as I see it, longer and more intense nets could do the trick... Theres no point just looking back, though.

In a different context (Sundays win over England), Sourav feels much the same: Its good that we won... The sequence of defeats has ended but, then, much remains to be done... We must consistently play to potential and should strive to lift our game... The Champions Trophy is a huge tournament and we need to be spot-on throughout. 

Incidentally, Sourav indicated that fielding Dinesh Karthik (and playing with only six specialist batsmen) was also a one-off happening. 

Joint-holders India have been clubbed with Pakistan and Kenya in the Champions Trophy and, eventually, one team alone is going to advance to the semi-finals from that group. For Sourav and Co. the tournament begins with the match against Kenya, in Southampton, on Saturday. 

Inaugural ICC awards 

Meanwhile, Indias Irfan Pathan is being seen by many as the hottest contender for the ICCs Emerging Player of the Year award, to be presented on Tuesday. Laxman, of course, has got three nominations, while Rahul Dravid has made it in two categories. Both of them arent badly placed either in fact, it wont surprise if Dravid, in particular, bags one award.

 No chin music from Lee

Mumbai: Brett Lee is a chastened man after the whacking he got from the Indian batsmen in Australia. He is not talking about chin music any more! 

?Chin music? The only music coming from me would be from my guitar,? the musically inclined pacer from New South Wales told reporters on Sunday. 

The pacer indicated he was going to bowl fast through the air and try to get some reverse swing going his way once the ball gets scruffed up due to the hard outfield. 

?Pace is my biggest asset. I am not a 130-kph bowler. I can also bowl seam-up, but there are others ? Glenn (McGrath), Jason (Gillespie) and Mike (Kasprowicz) to do so. I will try to bowl fast and smartly too,? the fast bowler said. 

?We need to bowl a different length here as compared to what we do at home. The ball is roughed up quickly and there is a chance to get my reverse swing going. (PTI)

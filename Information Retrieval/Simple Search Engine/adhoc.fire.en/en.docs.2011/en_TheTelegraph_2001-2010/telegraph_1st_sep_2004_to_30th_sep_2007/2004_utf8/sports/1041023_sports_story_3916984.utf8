The Telegraph - Calcutta

 There will never be 

another Ali

 Ali, now 62, battles Parkinson?s Disease 

London: The action was set for 4am, two or three hours before the African dawn. That did not stop over 60,000 people crowding the Stade du 20 Mai for one of the landmark sporting occasions of the century. 

When the Rumble in the Jungle was done, the battle lost and won, there was a thunderstorm which flooded the stadium and cut TV communications. 

But the outside world knew by then that Muhammad Ali had produced one of the most astonishing feats in boxing history to knock out the fearsome George Foreman and regain the world heavyweight title. 

The venue was Kinshasa, in Zaire, now known as the Democratic Republic of Congo. The date was October 30, 1974. The Thriller in Manila between Ali and Joe Frazier was another 11 months down the line. 

Thirty years on the victor, now 62, battles the ravages of Parkinson?s Disease; the loser, at the age of 56, is, remarkably, contemplating fighting again. 

All those years ago, Foreman was considered unbeatable with a 40-0 record. His eight previous bouts had ended in the first or second rounds and he was widely viewed as the heaviest puncher the sport had known. 

Ali was Ali ? a PR dream, a walking quotes-bag, poet, and showman supreme. But last and not least, he was a highly skilled fighter and tactician. A man who could take a punch although in later years his health was to pay a melancholy penalty. 

The fight was largely put together by Don King. The purse was $ 10 million, split 50-50, with most of it coming from the Zaire government of President Mobutu, keen to raise the profile of his country. 

Ali flew in with his costly 35-strong entourage a month in advance of the original scheduled date of September 25. A week before the big day Foreman cut an eye in training and the bout had to be put back. 

More time for the wit and wisdom of Ali, caught and recalled in Thomas Hauser?s book Muhammad Ali, His Life and Times. 

?I got a punch for George. It?s called the ghetto-whopper and the reason it?s called that is because it?s thrown in the ghetto at three in morning which is when me and George are gonna fight.? 

And the poetry: 

?Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee 

His hands can?t hit what his eyes can?t see 

Now you see me, now you don?t 

George thinks he will, but I know he won?t.? 

In fact, Foreman saw plenty of Ali, catching him hard and often, but it was part of the strategy hit on by the challenger after the first round. Apart from dancing on his feet, Ali was thinking on his feet. The ring surface proved slow and Ali quickly concluded not even he could dance all night 

He decided instead to entrench by the ropes, duck and take the blows and tire his opponent out. The blows came in, some so fierce even the battle-hardened at the ringside shuddered. But gradually they became slower and less punishing. By round eight, Ali felt ready to emerge from the ropes where much of the fight has been conducted. 

A fierce right-hander to the head and the ?rope-a-dope? champion was down.

 Vijay strikes three more 

 STAR RACER

 Vijay

 Calcutta: Vijay Singh continues with the good work. The champion trainer, who had saddled four winners on Friday, followed it up by a quick treble on Saturday to the delight of his fans. C. Alford partnered two of the three to victory. 

 Vijay started off with the fluent victory of Apprise, in the Bangalore Turf Club Cup. The hot-favourite, incidentally, reeled off his fourth win in-a-row. Corvino took Vijay?s tally to two, after the American Chance-Engaging Girl son outclassed his rivals in the 2,000m Phoebe?s Fire Handicap. S. Shanker guided the three-year-old to victory. It was Alaskan who took Vijay?s score to three, following the favourite?s belaboured three-length victory in the Army Cup which was presented to the winning owner D. Khaitan by the Chief of the Army Staff, General N.C. Vij.

 Mithali helps India pull one back 

Mumbai: An unbeaten 62 by vice-captain Mithali Raj and a responsible 47 by Jaya Sharma fashioned India?s six-wicket win over world champions Australia in the third One-Day International women?s cricket match at the Mumbai Police Gymkhana on Thursday. 

Put in to bat, Australia were bowled out for 147 in 47.1 overs on a track that helped the bowlers and India reached the target in 44 overs losing four wickets for their first win in the seven-match series. 

The visitors got off to a flying start with their skipper Belinda Clark (32, 4x4) and her deputy Karen Rolton (40, 3x4) putting on 63 runs off 20.2 overs. 

The Australians had another fruitful partnership between Jisa Keightley (56, 5x4) and Rolton, which added 57 run for the second wicket off 15.3 overs before the former was run out going for a risky single. 

The visitors, who were sitting pretty at 120 for two off 36.3 overs at one stage, then slumped to 147 all out with India?s left-arm spinner Neetu David (three for 27) and pacer Jhulan Goswami (two for 22) doing the maximum damage. 

Brief scores: Australia 147 in 47.1 ovs (L. Keightley 56, K. Rolton 40; N. David 3/27, J. Goswami 2/22). India 151/4 in 44 ovs (Mithali Raj 62 n.o., J. Sharma 47). India won by 6 wkts.

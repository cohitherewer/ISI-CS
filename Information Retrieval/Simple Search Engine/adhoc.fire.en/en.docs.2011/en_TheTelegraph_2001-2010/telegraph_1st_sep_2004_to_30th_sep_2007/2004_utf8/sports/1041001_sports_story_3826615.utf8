The Telegraph - Calcutta

 India to host China in March

 A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: India have been drawn to play China in their next Davis Cup tie in March 2005. According to information received from Madrid, where the draw ceremony was held on Thursday, India will host the Asia-Oceania group I first-round tie from March 4-6, 2005. 

If India get past China, which they should, Leander Paes? team will face the winners of the Uzbekistan versus Indonesia tie. Victory in that second-round encounter will give India a passage to next September?s World Group play-off round. India?s bid to regain footing in the elite World Group this year ended with a 2-3 defeat in Japan in April. India have been out of the World Group for six years now. 

The draw for next year?s World Group competition, which was also done on Thursday, gave the US a home tie against Croatia. But Spain, the other 2004 finalists, will have to travel to Slovakia for their first-round tie. 

In other World Group duels next March, Roger Federer?s Switzerland will face The Netherlands, Australia meet Austria, Argentina host Czech Republic, Chile play in Russia, France come up against Sweden and Romania clash with Belarus. 

Junior Davis Cup 

Indian boys have had a wonderful first two days in the ongoing junior Davis Cup meet in Barcelona. According to information received here, they began their campaign with a 3-0 sweep of Tunisia in group II and repeated that scoreline against Morocco on Wednesday. 

Jeevan Nedunchezhiyan beat Mehdi Benhamou 7-5, 6-4 in the opening rubber against Morocco. Rupesh Roy then battled past Reda el Amrani 7-5, 7-6 (7-5), before Jeevan and Sanam Singh overcame Benhamou and Ayoub Benamar 6-3, 6-2.

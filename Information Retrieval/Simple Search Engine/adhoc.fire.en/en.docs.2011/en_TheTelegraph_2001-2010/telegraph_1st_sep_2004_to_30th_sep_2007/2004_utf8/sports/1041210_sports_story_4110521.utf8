 Styris, McCullum cleared of charges

 Scott Styris 

Melbourne: New Zealand batsmen Scott Styris and Brendon McCullum are free to play in Friday?s third and deciding Chappell-Hadlee Trophy one-day match after being cleared of charges from Wednesday?s loss to Australia. 

The pair faced a disciplinary hearing on Thursday in Brisbane to explain their reactions after being dismissed in Wednesday?s 17-run loss to the world champions in Sydney. ICC Match Referee Mike Procter found McCullum not guilty of showing dissent after he was given out leg before to spinner Brad Hogg for 21. 

Styris, who was facing a charge of abusing cricket equipment when he made contact with an open gate with his bat while leaving the field, after falling leg before to Andrew Symonds for five, was also cleared. 

Both appeared to be unlucky to be adjudged out in Wednesday?s game as the Black Caps battled to 244 all out in 47.1 overs in reply to Australia?s 261 for seven. 

New Zealand coach John Bracewell expressed his disappointment with the standard of umpiring in Wednesday?s game. 

Adam Gilchrist (60) and Matthew Hayden (43) gave Australia an 86-run opening stand, but Bracewell says the Black Caps should have had Hayden leg before early in the home team?s innings. 

?We?re looking at getting Hayden leg before in front and see if we can get a dismissal and then work from that point,? Bracewell said. (Reuters)

INDRANIL MAJUMDAR

Calcutta: The Gaddafi in March and Eden Gardens in November. 

The characters remain almost the same while the circumstances are vastly different. To match the intensity and fervour witnessed during the Friendship Series will be tough, if not impossible. 

Be it the screening of the digitally enhanced all-colour Mughal-e-Azam at 89 Cinemas or a heritage tour of the city for the Pakistan delegates, the Platinum Jubilee match of the Board of Control for Cricket in India may be mistaken to be an extension of the Diwali celebrations. 

The cricketers, though, are in no mood to be part of this festive fervour. ?Id and Diwali has taken a backseat because of the match,? remarked Inzamam-ul Haq. ?Just because it?s a one-off match doesn?t mean it is less important. In fact, this has multiplied its importance. Lots will be at stake for players of both teams.? 

Sourav Ganguly, however, was pragmatic. ?The game has not started. So I won?t be able to make an assessment. But it?s an ODI and an Indo-Pak match is always a big event. We will play with the same intensity and want to win.? 

That India haven?t won against Pakistan at the Eden in their two previous meetings is making Sourav more determined. ?When we went to Pakistan earlier this year, we had never won there before. Winning in the past does not mean that you will win every time and vice versa. It?s a new day and anything can happen. It all matters how you play on that given day.? 

The Indian skipper, who formally confirmed his availability after a ?test? in the presence of Andrew Leipus ? it was limited to some running between the wickets to check his agility after nets were completed ? stressed the need for collective effort. ?We have to play as a unit. Each one of us needs to perform. This is important to remain consistent,? he said. 

Batting has been India?s nemesis in recent times and the captain knows the need to set things in order. According to Sourav, the availability of Sachin Tendulkar ?does make a difference? ? he was absent during the losses in Amstelveen and Birmingham because of a tennis elbow ? and the new-found confidence after the win in Mumbai has given his side the much-needed boost. 

Sourav has shelved his plans to open the innings in the interests of the team. ?(Virender) Sehwag is comfortable opening the innings,? he said. This means he will continue at No.3 with Rahul Dravid at No. 5. 

The Indians are going in with a three-pronged pace attack ? Zaheer Khan, Irfan Pathan, who was declared fit, and, in all probability, Ajit Agarkar. 

The choice of picking a lone spinner can be tricky. Harbhajan Singh, nursing a stiff neck, didn?t practise this morning. But his condition improved by the evening bringing him back into the frame along with Anil Kumble. 

Sourav thinks the toss ?will not be a factor?, but the dew can sway things a bit. ?There?s not much dew on all days. I don?t know how much of it will be there tomorrow,? the Indian captain, however, said. 

Whatever little grass was there on the pitch on Thursday was shaved off on Friday. Sourav described it as ?typical Eden wicket?, shorn of much pace or bounce. 

Grass or no grass, Inzamam declared that they were keeping faith in their fast bowlers. Shoaib Akhtar will be eager to prove his worth, though the slowness on the wicket will hardly come to his aid. 

The Pakistan captain, who is planning a victory as an Id gift for his countrymen, visited the Nakhoda Masjid at noon and seemed very impressed. He was relaxed and at his witty best at the post-match press conference. The arrival of one Mr Bob Woolmer must have offloaded much of the pressure from his shoulders. 

The real plotting of strategies will now be done behind the scenes. The coach played a big role in Pakistan?s last three victories over India and it wouldn?t come as a surprise if he has reserved a new trick up his sleeves this time too.

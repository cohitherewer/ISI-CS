 India invited for Dutch tourney

New Delhi: The Indian hockey team will take part in an eight-nation meet in August, billed as the first-ever mini World Cup in Holland. 

The Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) authorities have received an invitation from their Dutch counterparts. 

?It?s like a mini World Cup and will involve all the top countries in the world ? India, Pakistan, Holland, Germany, Australia, Korea, Spain and England,? IHF media manager Anupam Ghulati said. ?It?s a good opportunity and we are looking forward to it,? he said. 

Besides the World Cup, the biggest tournament Holland have organised so far is the BMW Trophy in 1990. India had finished fifth among seven nations on that occasion. 

Some other important fixtures also await the Indians in 2005 when the country will host the prestigious Champions Trophy. 

Chennai, the venue for the six-nation Champions Trophy, may host another six-nation event after the laying of a new astroturf in January. 

The country will also host Belgium soon after the Lahore Champions Trophy this year to play ?some Tests besides a few side games.? 

?Few weeks before Belgium?s visit in January, France will be coming on a 15-day tour during which they will play three Test matches,? Ghulati informed. 

?Both the teams are coming here to get some preparation ahead of the European Nations Cup,? he said. 

France will play two matches against the President?s XI in Mumbai and an equal number of matches against the junior side in Hyderabad before coming to Delhi for the Test matches. (PTI)

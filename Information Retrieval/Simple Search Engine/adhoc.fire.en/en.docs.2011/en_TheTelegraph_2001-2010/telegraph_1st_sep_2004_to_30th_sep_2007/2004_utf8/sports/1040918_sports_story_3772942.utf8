 Svetlana turns up in Bali

Bali: Svetlana Kuznetsova is a woman who keeps her word. Just five days after winning her maiden Grand Slam title in New York, the Russian was back in business on a much smaller stage. 

It would have been easy for Kuznetsova to make excuses for not travelling to the holiday island of Bali this week, especially as the Wismilak International tournament?s $225,000 purse is just a fraction of the million-dollar cheque she picked up for her US Open exploits. 

A bomb explosion in Jakarta last week, which killed nine people, could also have been used as an excuse but the thought of skipping the Tier III WTA event never crossed the Russian?s mind. 

?I know I need a break but if I give my word I have to do it, no matter what,? said the world No. 6. 

?I know everyone would understand if I didn?t come but it?s important that I keep my word and I want people to respect me. I also like being in Bali and it?s a good place to get calm. 

?If I went to Russia there would be so many crowds. I could have gone to Spain to practise, but I have a good feeling in Bali.? 

Kuznetsova admitted the last few days had taken a toll as she attempted to come to terms with being in the spotlight. 

?After I won I was up until four in the morning. I had to pack and only slept for four hours before playing the doubles final (on Sunday),? she said. ?Then I went straight from the courts and doing the press and photos to the flight, and the flight was so tough. 

?It was 24 hours and I was dead when I got here. But now I?m feeling great. 

?I still can?t believe that I won, you know. When you?re on the court and you hear ?US Open champion? you say, ?wow, who is that? I don?t see any champion?. It?s just great. It?s amazing.? Kuznetsova might not have turned out to be a professional tennis player as she grew up in an environment of world-class cycling. 

Her father, Alexander, coached five Olympic and world champions while her mother, Galina, was a six-time cycling champion and holder of 20 world records. 

Her brother, Nikolai, was a silver-medallist at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. 

Despite her family?s deep roots in cycling, Kuznetsova failed to excel on two wheels. ?My father told me to try something else, and I did swimming for a while and then started playing tennis.?

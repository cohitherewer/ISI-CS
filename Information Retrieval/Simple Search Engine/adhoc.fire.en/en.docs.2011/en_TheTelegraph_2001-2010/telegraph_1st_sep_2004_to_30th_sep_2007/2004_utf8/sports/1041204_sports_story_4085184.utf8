The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Wright: We must climb higher

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Calcutta: Coach John Wright is ?happy? at Team India?s climb to No.3 in the ICC Test rankings, after Thursday?s series win over South Africa, but wants the ?boys? to move even higher. 

?I realise it?s our best ranking but, really, we have to quickly move to No.2? As for the top position, the Australians are currently way ahead,? Wright told The Telegraph on Friday. 

Reflecting on the eight-wicket win at the Eden, the team?s 18th under his guidance, he said: ?Very good? After all, the toss wasn?t won by us, yet we made it with much to spare?? 

In the ODIs, by the way, the Indians are ranked No.8, one point behind South Africa. Again, the Australians are right at the top. 

THE TEST RANKINGS 

1. Australia (128); 2.England (109); 3.India (107); 4. Pakistan (105); 5. Sri Lanka (103); 6. South Africa (100); 7. New Zealand (93); 8. West Indies (73); 9. Zimbabwe (51); 10. Bangladesh(0).

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sport

 Monday, November 15, 2004 

 London: Manchester United winger Ryan Giggs has turned down a new one-year contract at Manchester United and is holding out for a longer deal, media reported on Sunday. The 30-year-old Welsh international, whose contract runs out at the end of next season, has spent his entire career at Old Trafford.

 ?I have been offered a one-year extension to my current deal but I turned it down,? he told the News of the World.?I was hoping for a longer deal. I want to end my career at Manchester United and asked them to reconsider.? The Sunday Mirror said Giggs could be sold as early as January after chief executive David Gill told manager Alex Ferguson that players must be sold before anymore can be brought in.

 London: Premier League leaders Chelsea are looking to become financially independent of billionaire owner Roman Abramovich and want manager Jose Mourinho to stay for the next 10 years, media said on Sunday. The Sunday Telegraph said chief executive Peter Kenyon had prepared a five-year plan to generate profits and cut the club?s dependency on oil tycoon Abramovich, who has poured hundreds of millions of pounds into Chelsea since buying the club last year. ?It is not prudent to run a football club on the basis of a benefactor building up a big debt stream. It is in the best interests of Chelsea to be self-sufficient,? Kenyon said.

 London: Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy attacked Jacques Santini on Saturday after the Frenchman said he had quit as manager because of his lack of control over first-team affairs rather than because of personal reasons. Santini, who was working for French television at White Hart Lane on Saturday where Tottenham lost 4-5 to Arsenal, said he was unhappy with his role in the Premier League club?s European-style management set-up.

 Paris: Former French international Emmanuel Petit, out of work and battling back from knee surgery, is training with Arsenal in the hope of finding a new club in the winter transfer window.

 ?I was looking for a ground where I could train. I called (Arsenal manager) Arsene (Wenger) who kindly offered to take me with them,? said Petit, who played for Arsenal between 1997 and 2000.

 ?Players and staff welcomed me with a smile and it?s a good feeling,? he told l?Equipe.

 ?After one and a half year in the doldrums, everything is possible. I still feel like playing.?

 Paris: The most expensive bidding battle in Olympic history begins in earnest on Monday when five of the world?s most recognisable cities attempt to win the right to host the 2012 Olympics. The final bid books, supplying minute details of how each city plans to put on sport?s most glittering prize, have to be delivered to the IOC?s marbled headquarters on the edge of Lake Leman by Monday.

 And their arrival heralds the start of an intense international campaign to win over the hearts and minds of the 120-odd IOC members who will declare the winner in Singapore on July 6.

 London: Ireland stopped South Africa?s Grand Slam bid in its tracks as world champions England and southern hemisphere heavyweights New Zealand swept to easy victories in Saturday?s internationals. Irish flyhalf Ronan O?Gara scored all his teams points in their 17-12 victory at Lansdowne Road over the Tri-Nations champions.

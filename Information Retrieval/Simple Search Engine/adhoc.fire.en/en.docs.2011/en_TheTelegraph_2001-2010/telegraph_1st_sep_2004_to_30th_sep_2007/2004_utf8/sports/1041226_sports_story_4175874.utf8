The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Desperately seeking Sourav 

OUR STAFF REPORTERS

 Rohan will check Sourav?s availability 

Calcutta: The alarm bells have started ringing. As the focus shifted to Bengal?s ?crunch match? against Madhya Pradesh after Saturday?s eight-wicket loss to Delhi, efforts are on to convince Sourav Ganguly to participate in the last game. 

?I will check with Sourav if he is available? His presence will make a big difference. The team needs him at this hour of crisis,? Rohan told The Telegraph. 

Ranadeb Bose also echoed similar sentiments. ?I will also request Maharajda to play this match and save the side from relegation,? the mediumpacer said. 

The tie versus Madhya Pradesh begins Friday and the Team India captain will be back in the city on Tuesday. 

It was learnt that the captaincy will also be offered to Sourav in case he decides to play. Rohan felt that Bengal?s collapse on the final day, when seven wickets fell for 42 runs, was part of the ?gameplan?. 

?I don?t think much went wrong today. The plan was to declare quickly and the target of 222 was okay. The strategy was to get as many runs as possible in the quickest time? could be two/three overs. We lost wickets but also got the runs. 

?The wickets have been tumbling in the first and last sessions for the past three days and the idea was to give the bowlers the chance to make use of the moisture on the strip. 

?The match was much closer than the result suggests. We had nothing to lose and had to take a chance. It?s sad that it didn?t pay off,? the Bengal captain explained. 

He admitted that he missed a genuine third seamer in the team. 

What did he think went wrong with the batting? ?We got off to starts but couldn?t build on that. We didn?t get enough partnerships going,? he said. 

Rohan wanted the players to work individually on their drawbacks. ?Everyone has to put their hands up and work harder. They?ve to try and analyse their mistakes and work individually.?

 Amelie No. 1 following Linsday loss

 New York: Amelie Mauresmo 

 became world No. 1 for the first time after Lindsay Davenport 

 lost to Svetlana Kuznetsova in the US Open semi-finals on 

 Friday. 

The 25-year-old Frenchwoman, who lost in the quarter finals at Flushing Meadow, replaces Belgian Justine Henin-Hardenne who has held the position since November 2003. 

Former world No. 1 Davenport would have returned to the top spot if she had won the US Open. 

 Mauresmo, who has won three titles 

 this year, becomes the 14th player to reach world No. 1 

 since the inception of computer rankings in 1975.

Bulawayo: England captain Michael Vaughan was keen to express his team?s respect for Zimbabwe on the eve of the third one-day International. 

England won the first two games of the four-match series by five wickets and 161 runs against a Zimbabwe side which has now lost 15 consecutive one-day Internationals. 

Vaughan, however, said his team was taking nothing for granted before games in Bulawayo on Saturday and Sunday. 

?We respect the Zimbabweans as we do every other team we play against,? Vaughan said at a news conference on Friday. 

?We?re 2-0 up and expect to win both games over the weekend, but in both the games we?ve played so far they?ve had periods of play when they put us under pressure. 

?We?ve come out the other side and won two games of cricket comprehensively, but we certainly respect them.? 

Vaughan said one of the areas of concern in the England camp was the new-ball bowling of James Anderson and Darren Gough. 

?They?ve been open and honest to admit that they haven?t utilised the new ball as well they would have liked in the two games, and they?ll be looking to come back strong tomorrow,? Vaughan said. 

Vaughan said Gough?s presence in the squad had been valuable during the difficult time when England postponed their arrival in the country after the Zimbabwe government refused to give accreditation to 13 media representatives. ?Over that tricky week before the first game Gough?s sense of humour was a priceless asset to our young team,? Vaughan said. ?He certainly kept us smiling in some circumstances.? 

Zimbabwe captain Tatenda Taibu was confident his team could salvage something from the series. ?We didn?t have a great start to the series, but we can still win the last two games,? Taibu said. 

Taibu admitted his players were playing poorly at crucial stages of matches. ?We need to play good cricket for all 100 overs, and we need to look at certain areas,? he said. 

Zimbabwe had their Test status suspended after they were forced to select an inexperienced squad in the wake of 15 experienced players refusing to play for the country. 

They are due to return to the Test arena next year.

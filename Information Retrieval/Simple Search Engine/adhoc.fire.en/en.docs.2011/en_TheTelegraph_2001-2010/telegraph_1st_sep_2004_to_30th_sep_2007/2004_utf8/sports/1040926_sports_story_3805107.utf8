London: Andy Roddick cracked a 155mph (249kph) delivery, two mph quicker than his own fastest serve record, to help push the US into a 2-0 lead over Belarus in their Davis Cup semi-final on Friday. 

An inspired display by Paul-Henri Mathieu also put France 1-0 up against Spain in a semi-final disrupted by bad light in Alicante (as reported in Saturday?s Late City edition). 

World No. 2 Roddick overwhelmed Vladimir Voltchkov 6-1, 6-4, 6-4 in the opening match between the US and Belarus before Olympic silver medallist Mardy Fish followed up by defeating Max Mirnyi 7-5, 6-2, 3-6, 6-3. 

Roddick broke his own serve record in the final game against Voltchkov and then closed the match with his 17th ace. 

Voltchkov, who has a sprained left wrist, had not played since the August Olympics and admitted he was rusty. The US are bidding to make their first Davis Cup final in seven years. Belarus have never advanced this far. 

In Alicante, Juan Carlos Ferrero completed a 6-3, 6-1, 1-6, 6-3 victory over France?s Fabrice Santoro to haul Spain back level at 1-1 in their semi-final on Saturday. 

Ferrero had been struggling to deal with a Santoro fightback when the light closed in on Friday evening with the scores level at 3-3 in the fourth set. 

When the two returned on Saturday, Ferrero was once again in trouble as Santoro forced two break points in the seventh game. The Spaniard saved both of them with huge serves, though, and broke his opponent in the next game with a brilliant wrong-footing forehand that flashed past Santoro at the net. 

Ferrero then served out to complete victory in two hours 43 minutes, levelling scores in the match after Paul-Henri Mathieu?s 6-3, 3-6, 2-6, 6-3, 6-3 victory over Carlos Moya in the first match on Friday (as reported in Saturday?s Late City edition). 

Aussies clinch tie 

In the World Group playoff ties, Australia opened up an unbeatable 3-0 lead over Morocco by winning Saturday?s doubles match at Perth?s Royal Kings Park. 

Todd Woodbridge and Wayne Arthurs defeated Mounir El Aarej and Mehdi Tahiri 7-6 (9-7), 7-6 (7-2), 6-3 to ensure Australia remain in the World Group next year while Morocco are relegated to the next tier. 

El Aarej and Tahiri were thrust into the tie after Morocco?s two best players, Younes El Aynaoui and Hicham Arazi, pulled out, and the pair gave their more experienced rivals a stiff examination. 

The Moroccans had three set points in the opening tie-break but failed to convert their chances and had two break points in the second set which they also wasted. They successfully fought off eight break points in the first two sets but were unable to stop the Australians, who were better suited to the grass surface. 

Russia, winners in 2002, Croatia and Romania also grabbed the opening-day honours by taking both points against their respective opponents. 

Austria?s Stefan Koubek hammered Britain?s Tim Henman 6-3, 6-3, 6-1 in the first singles at Portschach on Saturday. 

Australia?s hold on the Davis Cup lasted 10 weeks after they were dumped out of this year?s event by Sweden but a rampant Lleyton Hewitt trounced Morocco?s Mehdi Tahiri 6-0, 6-2, 6-2 to become his country?s most successful Davis Cup singles player. 

Hewitt?s 25th singles victory allowed him to eclipse the mark he shared with Adrian Quist, who established his run in the 1930s and 1940s. 

Marat Safin continued his winning form and trampled all over Danai Udomchoke 6-4, 6-1, 6-2 to give Russia a 2-0 advantage over Thailand. Igor Andreev overwhelmed Thai No. 1 Paradorn Srichaphan 7-5, 6-2, 6-4 in the opening singles rubber to put the home side ahead in Moscow. 

Germany took a 2-1 lead over Slovakia as Tommy Haas and Alexander Waske defeated Karol Kucera and Dominik Hrbaty of Slovakia 6-3, 6-3, 4-6, 3-6, 6-4 in Bratislava on Saturday. 

Nicolas Massu and Fernando Gonzalez put Chile 2-0 up on Japan in Santiago while Jiri Novak and Tomas Berdych gave the Czech Republic a similar advantage over Paraguay in Asuncion. (Reuters)

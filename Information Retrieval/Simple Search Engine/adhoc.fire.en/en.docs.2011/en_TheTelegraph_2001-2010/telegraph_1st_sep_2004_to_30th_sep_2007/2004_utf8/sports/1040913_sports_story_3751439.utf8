Calcutta: Rain greeted the Al Jaish football team, which had its first real practice at the SAI on Sunday afternoon. The Syrian outfit, in the city to play the AFC Cup quarter final against East Bengal on Wednesday, sounded worried about the inclement weather. 

Soggy ground conditions added to their trouble. The manager, Hasan Alswaidan was initially reluctant to train at the ground and demanded proper dressing room. But later decided to go along with the available amenities. 

Coached by Romanian Stefaneseu Castica, the Syrian players had nearly two-hours workout under steady drizzle. Present at the ground was East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick to watch the Syrians. The players started with ball control and then went on to play rugby with soccer balls. Sessions of stretching and set-piece movement followed, before rounding off with a practice match. And Bhowmick was present throughout to catch a good view of the opponents. 

The Syrians, who had won the Syrian Cup only last month, have released all their foreign players. 

?This is a new season and we have only Syrian players in the squad,? Alswaidan said. But it is not the newly-strung team (the transfers being recently over) that is the main worry. ?If the weather remains the same and if the ground remains like this, it will be very difficult for us to play. It will not be a football match, but more of a jostle,? Castica said. ?However, we can?t do anything about it. We will have to play,? he added. 

His concern was shared by Alswaidan as well as team skipper Tarek Mohammed Jabban. The Romanian plans to bring a dash of European soccer to the team and will focus on tactical build-up. ?We will be cautious here and then try to win back home,? both the manager and coach said. 

However, they revealed they had very little information about the opponents. 

East Bengal coach, meanwhile, tried to evade questions that flew at him. Asked how he saw the Syrian team ? currently placed seventh in the Syrian league ? Bhowmick said: ?They will be a tough opponent. The players look strong and well built (with an average height of nearly six feet).? Asked whether the ground condition would benefit his team, Bhowmick felt the Syrians could adapt to the conditions, before diving away in a hurry.

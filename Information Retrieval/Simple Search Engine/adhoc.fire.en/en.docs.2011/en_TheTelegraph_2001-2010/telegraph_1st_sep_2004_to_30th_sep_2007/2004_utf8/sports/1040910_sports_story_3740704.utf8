The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Bwalya braces for final fling

Johannesburg: Zambia coach Kalusha Bwalya says he may still play a few more games for his country after scoring an unlikely World Cup winner at the weekend. 

The 41-year-old former PSV Eindhoven winger brought himself on as a second-half substitute to strike home a late free-kick for a 1-0 win over Liberia in Zambia?s African Zone group I qualifier in Lusaka last Saturday. The goal kept Zambia?s otherwise youthful side in contention for a place at the 2006 World Cup finals in Germany and increased Bwalya?s almost mythical status in his country. 

?I am still fit, and I like to keep myself in shape,? Bwalya said in an interview on Thursday. ?I love to be on the pitch with the boys, to challenge them, but I also have to be realistic about just how much I can contribute at this age.? 

Bwalya first came to prominence with a hattrick for Zambia against Italy at the 1988 Olympic Games, a performance that carved a niche for African football and saw Bwalya crowned African Footballer of the Year. 

In July, Bwalya surprisingly awarded himself what was expected to be a farewell appearance in a match against Mauritius ? a genteel enough environment against lightweight opposition. When he scored a goal after just seven minutes on the pitch, Bwalya set the stage for an unlikely Indian Summer five years after he ended his club career in the Mexican second division. 

As a result, Bwalya brought himself on and then hit the winner with a free-kick through the wall and past the unsighted goalkeeper. ?We did sneak it a little,? he laughed. Bwalya views his Zambia side as a ?long shot? for qualification for the World Cup finals in Germany. Togo lead the group on goal difference from Senegal and Zambia.

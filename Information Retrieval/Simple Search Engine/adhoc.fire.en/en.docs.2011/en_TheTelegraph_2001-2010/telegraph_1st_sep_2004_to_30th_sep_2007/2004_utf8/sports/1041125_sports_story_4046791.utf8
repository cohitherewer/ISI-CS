Kanpur: Come Thursday noon and Sourav Ganguly is going to face his toughest test since Lord?s, in the summer of 1996, when he made his Test debut. 

That, after all, is when the ICC-appointed Appeals Commissioner, barrister Tim Castle, will begin hearing his plea against the two-Test ban imposed by Match Referee Clive Lloyd. 

Being the captain, Sourav got booked for the slow over rate in the November 13 ODI versus Pakistan. 

The hearing is going to be conducted via a tele-conference, with Sourav and his counsel, top gun Siddhartha Shankar Ray, sitting in New Delhi. New Zealander Castle will be at home, in Wellington. 

?I?m not tense, neither am I only thinking of tomorrow... What?s to happen is going to happen... I can?t change that,? Sourav told The Telegraph moments before leaving for Lucknow airport en route to the capital. 

He did, of course, add: ?Actually, it?s not so much destiny... If I have to, it?s Mr Castle that I need to think about...? 

Earlier, interacting with the Media after the draw versus South Africa, he said it would be best to ?forget? a Test played on such a bland Green Park wicket and look to ?winning? at the Eden Gardens. 

Asked about the ?positives,? Sourav spoke about Gautam Gambhir?s excellent 96. He also praised his spinners for restricting the visitors on the first two days. 

Significantly, unlike teammates Virender Sehwag and Murali Kartik, Sourav didn?t flay the South Africans? approach. ?It wouldn?t be proper for me to criticise their strategy... It?s obvious they wanted to post a big total and put us under pressure...? 

However, Sourav accepted that losing the toss affected India. ?The outcome would have been different had South Africa not won (the toss)... Then, the loss of time (about 60 overs) also had an impact...? he pointed out. 

Learning from the Nagpur experience, Sourav declined to talk about the wicket. ?Look, we have to play on whatever is offered by the curator,? is all that he commented. 

Graeme Smith, by the way, was all smiles. ?We?ve taken quite a few positives from the draw... Nobody gave us a chance after the tour-opener (in Jaipur), but we showed character... Did we play negatively? No... 

?Whatever others may feel, we had plans and executed them according to the situation... Moreover, it could have been different had we taken all the catches and not missed a stumping (of centurion Virender Sehwag),? the South African captain observed. 

 The revolver show 

Meanwhile, Kanpur Cricket Association president Naimuddin Siddiqui?s son, Taslim Pasha, was held on Wednesday afternoon for moving around Green Park with his (Siddiqui?s) licensed revolver. 

The youngster was quickly taken to the Colonelganj thana for questioning. Till late in the evening, though, it couldn?t be confirmed if he was arrested. 

Whether or not Pasha is put behind bars, that he got through the metal detectors won?t be well received by the higher-ups. A breach of security is, indeed, serious stuff.

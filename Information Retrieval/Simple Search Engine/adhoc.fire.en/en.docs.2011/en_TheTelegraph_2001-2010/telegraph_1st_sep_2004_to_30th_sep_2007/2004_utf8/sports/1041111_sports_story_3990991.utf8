Calcutta: Bengal registered a thumping 116-run win over Karnataka in their opening match of the Ranji Trophy Elite Group tie at the Jadavpur University?s Salt Lake campus ground on Wednesday. 

Bengal left-arm spinner Murtaza Lodhgar scalped his second five-wicket haul in the match, thus completing an 11-wicket match haul. Team India captain Sourav Ganguly was also very much in the thick of things, taking three brilliant catches at first slip. 

Karnataka?s atrocious batting display in both the innings led to their downfall and the Bengal bowlers had everything going in their favour right through the match. No wonder the visitors desperately tried to get Rahul Dravid before this game. 

Resuming at 41 for one, the visitors never looked positive in getting those 302 runs. Rowland Barrington (20) was the first to depart at the score of 61. Sourav took a superb reflex-action catch to his left at first slip off Murtaza. 

Shyam Ponnappa was also shown the door by the left-arm spinner. Ponnappa scored only 14 before he edged one to Sourav. Thereafter wickets fell regularly and the home side won at the stroke of tea. 

S. Somasunder at No. 3 was the highest scorer with 46, includingsix boundaries. Somasunder?s departure virtually ended Karnataka?s hopes of saving the match. He was trapped leg before by Sourashish Lahiri. The off-spinner looked a much better bowler on the day. 

Vijay Bharadwaj and Stuart Binny made an attempt to salvage some pride by putting on 58 for the seventh wicket. Bharadwaj (40), who batted for 142 minutes, hit some glorious boundaries. Though Binny (42) hit the biggest six of the match over long-off, he never looked to be in command. 

Trying to cut, Binny edged an outgoing Ranadeb Bose delivery to Arindam Das at slip. The medium-pacer maintained superb line all through and frustrated the batsmen. He deserved more than one wicket on the last day. 

The last three Karnataka wickets fell in the space of five runs. After Bharadwaj got dismissed by Lahiri, it was just a matter of time. Bengal managed to prove a point by collecting four important points against a side that forced them to follow on in Mandya last season. 

Sourav praised the Bengal team for the brilliant performance but didn?t like to equate Murtaza with Utpal Chatterjee. ?Utpal has taken nearly 500 wickets and he has just started, he has long way to go.? He also felt that Bengal would do better in the forthcoming games after having made a good start here. 

Coach Ghavri termed Murtaza?s showing as a dream performance but lashed out at the umpires. ?These umpires are not even fit for any carnival match,? he said. 

According to Ghavri, many of the decisions went against them and he would mention that point in his report to the board. ?We will surely make it a point to criticise the umpires when we send our report to board,? he said.

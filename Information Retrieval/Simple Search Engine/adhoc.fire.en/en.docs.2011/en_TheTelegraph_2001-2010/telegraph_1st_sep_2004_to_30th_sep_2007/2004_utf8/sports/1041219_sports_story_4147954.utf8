Perth: Damien Martyn completed a century while Justin Langer and Ricky Ponting both narrowly missed out as Australia took complete control of the first Test against Pakistan at the WACA on Saturday. 

When play ended on Day III, Pakistan were struggling on 18 for one in their second innings, chasing a near-impossible 564 to win after Australia declared their second innings closed at 361 for five. 

Ponting called his players in about half an hour before stumps as soon as Martyn had scampered through for a single to finish on exactly 100 not out. 

Ponting and Langer had also seemed certain to reach their hundreds earlier in the day but both fell short. 

Langer, who made 191 in the first innings, was poised to become the first player to score twin hundreds in a Test at Perth when he fell for 97 while Ponting, who has yet to make a Test hundred this year, departed for 98. 

Langer was racing towards triple figures when he drove Abdul Razzaq to the ropes for his 14th boundary to reach 97. 

However, the paceman got his revenge next ball when he found the inside edge and Langer dragged the ball back onto his stumps. 

Shoaib Akhtar once again made the breakthrough for Pakistan but his celebration was more subdued. Shoaib, who took five for 99 in the first innings, sent Hayden packing with a vicious inswinger that crashed into the off stump. 

Ponting aborted the innings when Martyn reached his century and was rewarded with an early wicket.

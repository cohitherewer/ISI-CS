 Lanka rely on Sanath

Faisalabad: Sri Lanka are relying on ?match-winner? Sanath Jayasuriya to find his form as they attempt to maintain their successful streak in Pakistan. 

?He is not in the team just because he is a senior player. He is there because he is a match winner for us,? captain Maravan Atapattu said on the eve of the first Test starting Wednesday. 

Jayasuriya is 36 short of becoming the second Sri Lankan to complete 6,000 Test runs, but critics have questioned his place in the team after some indifferent form. 

The 35-year-old left-hander has scored two hundreds and four half-centuries in his last 12 Test appearances, but had a top score of 40 in the one-day tri-series against Pakistan and Zimbabwe. He, however, took five wickets for 17 runs in last Saturday?s final. 

?Every player goes through a bad patch, but he has contributed a lot and he will be very important for us in these conditions,? said Atapattu, who was criticised by Sri Lanka?s chief selector Asantha De Mel last week for not picking younger players. 

?Team development should go hand in hand with success. As captain, my job is to do the best with the team provided by the selectors,? Atapattu said in response to the comments. 

?My mission is to see Sri Lanka reach the top of the ratings in Test and one-day Internationals,? he added. 

Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq ruled out any new Test caps in the first match despite the inclusion of rookie fast bowler Riaz Afridi and wicketkeeper Zulqarnain Haider in the squad. The hosts are expected to play spinners Kaneria and Shoaib Malik, who was reported for a suspect action after the tri-series final. 

Panel for Malik 

Meanwhile, the PCB announced on Tuesday it has formed a five-member panel to correct Malik?s suspected bowling action. ?We have formed a panel to help Malik undergo corrective measure on his bowling action,? PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan said. 

The panel consists of Waqar Younis, coach Bob Woolmer, former Test off-spinner Ejaz Faqih, former Test umpire Khizar Hayat and Bruce Yardley. (Agencies)

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 We are ready for Pakistan: Sourav 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

Southampton: Captain Sourav Ganguly is disappointed at having missed a hundred for the second time in less than a week, but is happy Team India got its second win in that period. 

After beating England at Lord?s last Sunday, the Indians thrashed Kenya by 98 runs in their opening Champions Trophy game at the Rose Bowl on Saturday. 

And, as at Lord?s, the MoM award went to Sourav ? this time too he fell for 90. 

?It?s disappointing, yes, but can?t be helped... Talking of the team, the boys are getting things right and we are ready for the next game (against Pakistan, on September 19),? he said. 

Of course, Sourav is 90 closer to 10,000 ? a milestone he has his sights on, something he acknowledged in a chat with The Telegraph on match-eve. 

Asked to bat by Steve Tikolo, the Indians raised 290 for four. In reply, the Kenyans ? playing their first ODI in all of 17 months ? managed 192 for seven when the 50 overs ran out. 

If Sourav top-scored in the opening session, in front of a record Indians-dominated crowd, Harbhajan Singh did the star turn in session No. 2: Three for 33. 

Meanwhile, Lakshmipathy Balaji is likely to stay on for a week (and get treated by physio Andrew Leipus) before leaving for home. His replacement, Amit Bhandari, should join on Sunday.

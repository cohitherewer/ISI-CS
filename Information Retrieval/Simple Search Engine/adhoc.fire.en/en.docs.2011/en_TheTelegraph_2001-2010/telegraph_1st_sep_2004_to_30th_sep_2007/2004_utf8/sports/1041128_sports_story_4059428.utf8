The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Milestones beckon star duo

 - I?m keeping things simple... I?m not rushing: Sachin l I?m not too excited or ... The wickets will come: Kumble 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: Often, individual goals run alongside a larger team ambition. The script which unfolds at the Eden, Sunday, should have provision for both. 

Collectively, it?s an opportunity for Team India to get the act together in last season?s exciting manner. Yet, that?s not all. 

Sachin Tendulkar is one short of equalling Sunil Gavaskar?s world record of 34 centuries; Anil Kumble is four shy of matching Kapil Dev?s India-best of 434 wickets. 

Landing both milestones is a distinct possibility during the second and final Test against South Africa. 

However, be it Sachin or Kumble, they are pretty cool being on the doorstep of mega achievements. 

?I?m keeping things simple? I?m not rushing,? Sachin told The Telegraph, smiling enigmatically. 

Predictably, Kumble took much the same line: ?I?m not too excited or? The wickets will come?? 

That, for you, is confidence. 

But, then, Kumble has already taken 60 wickets this year. Whatever the label critics may talk of, he has been a huge performer. 

Sachin, on the other hand, began the year with an epic unbeaten 241 at the SCG, but hasn?t been a big contributor since the 194 not out in Multan. 

That has obviously impacted on Team India. 

Given captain Sourav Ganguly?s ?victory? in his battle with the ICC and counterpart Graeme Smith almost rendered hors de combat, the build-up points to India having more than just the home advantage. 

One is speaking about the circumstances-driven benefit(s). 

Unless there?s a rethink (which, by the way, isn?t really expected), the Indian XI is going have one change: Irfan Pathan taking Murali Kartik?s place. 

Irfan, of course, will be making a comeback. He missed the Nagpur and Mumbai Tests, versus Australia, through injury and wasn?t picked in Kanpur. 

While the Indians have (for now) settled on a 2-2 bowling attack, Smith?s freak injury has thrown the visitors? plans for a six. 

If the injury is bad enough to keep him out of a Test South Africa must win if they are to claim the series (and the Videocon Cup), either Hashim Amla is going to make his debut or Justin Ontong will get another cap. 

In any case, one of them should play as Martin van Jaarsveld is set to be dropped, There?s a question mark over the rather pedestrian specialist spinner, Robin Peterson, too. 

The toss ought not to be a significant factor, but whoever wins is expected to take first strike. In the sub-continent that, perhaps, is inevitable.

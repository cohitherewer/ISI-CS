The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Aleem Dar: I?m not under pressure

 - First Pakistani to officiate in a Test in India 

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI 

Nagpur: Aleem Dar, who has a striking resemblance to Waqar Younis, will become the first Pakistani to officiate in a Test in India when he takes position at the VCA Stadium on Tuesday. 

The Lahore-based Dar, a first-class umpire for five seasons, made the ICC?s Elite Panel early this year. He is going to officiate in the fourth and final India-Australia Test, in Mumbai, as well. 

While veteran David Shepherd is Dar?s on-field colleague here, the consistent Rudi Koertzen will keep him company at the Wankhede. 

?It?s nice to be in India and, frankly, I?m not under pressure... The history bit apart, I?ve got a job to do and intend giving off my best... That?s it,? the soft-spoken Dar told The Telegraph on Sunday evening. 

Dar, of course, is going to be careful when Sachin Tendulkar is on strike: In the 2003 World Cup, after all, the maestro almost decapitated him during the India-Namibia match in Pietermaritzburg. 

?Yes, that was a close shave... I?ll have to be as alert if not more,? he quipped. 

Some of Dar?s countrymen ? among them Khizar Hayat and Mahboob Shah ? have umpired in India, but all either in the 1987 or 1996 World Cups. Shah even officiated in the 1987 final at the Eden. At the other end was India?s Ram Babu Gupta. 

Incidentally, after Srinivas Venkatraghavan decided to quit, the Elite Panel doesn?t have an Indian.

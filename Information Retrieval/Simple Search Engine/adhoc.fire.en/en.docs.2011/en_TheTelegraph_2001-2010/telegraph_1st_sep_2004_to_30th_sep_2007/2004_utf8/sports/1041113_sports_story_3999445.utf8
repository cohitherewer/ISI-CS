The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Selection set for tomorrow

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Calcutta: The Indian team for the first Test against South Africa is set to be picked here on Sunday. The captain for the two-Test series, however, should be named on Saturday itself. It can only be Sourav Ganguly. 

?As everybody is around, it makes sense to have the selection a day after the ODI... We also have to remember that this is the festive season and some of those selected may have problems with their tickets,? BCCI secretary S.K. Nair told The Telegraph on Friday evening. 

The first Test, in Kanpur, begins on November 20 and the players will probably report on the 18th morning. The second (and final) Test is going to be at the Eden from November 28.

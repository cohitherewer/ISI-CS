 Century a mark of maturity: Ashraful

Chittagong: Mohammed Ashraful said his unbeaten century in the first innings of the second Test against India marked his coming of age as a batsman. 

The 20-year-old cracked the best-ever individual Test score by a Bangaldeshi when he made 158 not out, but his second Test century came after three years and 22 matches since his first one on debut against Sri Lanka in 2001. 

?I had come close to scoring a hundred many times but I realised I won?t be getting a century in every match. However, I have matured now, and this hundred is a mark of that maturity,? said Ashraful, who also holds the record of being the youngest to score a century on debut at the age of 16. 

The middleorder bat said it was disappointing that Bangladesh could not avoid the follow on after they were bowled out for 333 in reply to India?s 540. 

The hosts suffered a familiar batting collapse in the second innings to be 118 for nine at stumps on the third day, and need 89 runs more to avoid an innings defeat. 

Irfan Pathan, who claimed his third five-wicket haul in the second innings to trigger a collapse, said he was disappointed to miss out on a hattrick. 

Pathan, who had gone wicketless for most part of the day, turned things around with two wickets off successive balls towards the end of home team?s first innings. 

?I was thinking of getting one (hattrick) but bowled a bad delivery,? he said. ?I think I was trying too hard in the first innings. One thing I learnt today was that I am not going to get a five-wicket haul every time I bowl in a Test match. 

?The important thing is to bowl well. Sometimes you don?t get wickets even when you bowl well.? 

He said captain Sourav Ganguly consulted them before enforcing the follow on. 

?He always consults us,? said the left-arm pacer who bowled 14 overs on the trot. 

?I felt I could go on. The ball was moving a bit, and I felt good...,? he said. (PTI)

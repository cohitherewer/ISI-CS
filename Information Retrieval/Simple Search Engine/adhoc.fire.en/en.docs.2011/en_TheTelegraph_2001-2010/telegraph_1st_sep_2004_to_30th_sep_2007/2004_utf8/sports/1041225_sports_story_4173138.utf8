The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Sharma cool, post-debut

 Joginder Sharma 

Dhaka: There was nothing spectacular about Joginder Sharma?s maiden appearance in one-day Internationals. But the figures that went against his name on the scorecard show that he plays his game the hard way. 

He could face only seven balls in the Indian innings and remained unbeaten on five. But he also bowled eight overs in two spells for one for 28, and took a well-judged catch in the deep. 

Importantly, he did not have an iota of stage fright. Playing for India A made him feel ?normal?, he said. ?I did not get enough time with the bat,? was how he summed up his first game in India colours. 

The 21-year-old lad from Rohtak, Haryana, belongs to a middle class family, which depends on the meagre income earned from a paan shop business. Yet, he talks about his India debut in the first ODI against Bangladesh in Chittagong Thursday in a matter-of-fact manner. 

?It was very difficult at the start. You know it is a bit expensive and I had to depend on my friends? help. It was tough, hard. But somehow I never thought about such things,? Joginder said as he looked back on the thorny path he had walked. ?I just played my cricket, concentrated on the game.? he said. 

Joginder made his Ranji Trophy debut three years ago. He merited the selection with two back-to-back centuries and 30 wickets in four matches so far this season. ?I did not think about it, exposure and other things. Many people from the state have played for India before,? he said. 

Abdul Razzaq and Jacques Kallis are the two he keenly follows. ?What I like in them is their fighting spirit,? he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Rain factor Subrata?s greatest worry

Calcutta: Before sending out his players to practise amid incessant rain on Thursday, Subhas Bhowmick must have been bracing for a spectrum of emotions ? ranging from crossing the biggest hurdle to win back the IFA Shield to seeing the door to another trophy slammed. 

Following East Bengal?s quarter-final exit in AFC Cup, Bhowmick must cross defending champions Mohun Bagan before he can heal his Damascus wounds. The Paolo Robertos and Louis Aniwetas engaged in set-piece movements. Understandably so, since rain is certain to play a big role in Friday?s IFA Shield semi-final between the city rivals. 

Like Bhowmick, Subrata Bhattacharya also has a self-proclaimed motive. He wants to win this mother of derbies in Indian football as a ?reward for Mohun Bagan supporters?. ?The urge to win tomorrow is strong. Good to see players are responding to it pretty well. I could not make it to the tent in time because of the rain. But some of the players, in the meantime, called me up to inform that they were waiting for me and ready for practice. This is the kind of attitude that I like. Everybody knows it?s time to deliver,? he later told reporters. 

Bagan players have been offered incentives if win comes their way. 

However, what Bhattacharya is fearing most, he has no hand in it. ?Rain will be my bigger worry than the opponents,? he said. For, it means a setback for his team?s ?speedy game? and navigating the unchartered waters at the Salt Lake Stadium. It also means, as he pointed out rather dispassionately, ?advantage to East Bengal.? 

?But this is a natural disaster and I can?t change it. So, even if it gets down to a waterpolo match tomorrow, a win will be my principal objective,? Bhattacharya said. 

Bhowmick, however, refused to acknowledge any of these pre-match benefits. This is the match, he believes, which does not just build character, but reveal it. ?So much emotions are associated with this game and both teams want to give it a blast,? he remarked. 

Trouble, though, is lurking on Bhowmick?s front. Four of his first-choice players will miss the tie because of their pre-World Cup national camp commitments. Sandip Das is certain to slip into Dipak Mondal?s role as a sweeper while Rajat Ghosh Dastidar will replace Sangram Mukherjee under the bar. But how the coach deals with the vacuum created by the absence of Rahim Nabi and Alvito D?Cunha remains to be seen. Dipankar Roy may be in, but Douglas is doubtful. 

Bhowmick got only one thing off his chest, indicating that the new Brazilian signing, Paolo, who scored four goals in two group matches, would be in the starting line-up. No surprise in that though. 

There will be no Palash Karmakar (injury), no Tomba Singh (national camp) on the Mohun Bagan roster. The match, however, may see Ashim Biswas? return after an injury lay-off. Ashim said: ?The ground will be slushy, not an ideal condition for my return. I want to play a little later in the match.? 

With elements not favouring, Bhattacharya is banking a lot on Basudeb Mondal and Amit Das. ?Amit is probably in his best form and Basu is adept at situations like this. I hope both will rise their game by one or two notches.? Bhattacharya, incidentally, had a long session with his Brazilian duo ? Eduardo Coelho and Beto. 

?I know tomorrow is a big match and we?ll play for a win,? Beto said through his Brazilian teammate. 

This attitude percolates both camps. Elements permitting or not, this is elementary, Dr Watson!

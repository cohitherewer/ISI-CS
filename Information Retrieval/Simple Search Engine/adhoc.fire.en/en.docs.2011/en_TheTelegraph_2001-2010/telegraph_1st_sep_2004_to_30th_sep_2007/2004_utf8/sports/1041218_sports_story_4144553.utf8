 Surya back in joint lead 

Visakhapatnam: PSPB GMs Surya Sekhar Ganguly and Sandipan Chanda continued to lead the tables after drawing their 16th round encounters in the 42nd national A chess championship on Thursday. 

Both Ganguly and Chanda have 11 points so far and with just three more rounds to come in this 19-player contest they are almost reliving the experience of last edition when both tied for the top spot. 

GM Abhijit Kunte almost made certain of making it to the Indian team with an easy draw with Ganguly in this round. Abhijit moved to 10 points. 

Also on 10 points are IMs M. R. Venkatesh and S. Kidambi, but they both have just one game left to play. Venkatesh had it easy against Chanda while Kidambi was brilliance personified in crashing through the defences of seasoned grandmaster Dibyendu Barua who was thrown out of contention from the team after another disaster.

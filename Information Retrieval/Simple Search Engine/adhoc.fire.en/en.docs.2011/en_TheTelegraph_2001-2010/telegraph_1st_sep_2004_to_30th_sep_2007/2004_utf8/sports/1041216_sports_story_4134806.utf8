 Zagreb: Croatias former national soccer coach Miroslav Ciro Blazevic is to contest the countrys presidential election in January, the state electoral commission confirmed Wednesday. Blazevic, 69, led Croatia to a surprise third place at the 1998 World Cup in France.

 He recently had successful surgery for prostate cancer and recovered in time to lead club team Varteks Varazdin to third position in the Croatian championship before the winter break.

 Local surveys give incumbent president Stjepan Mesic a comfortable edge over 12 opponents with Blazevic forecast to poll only two or three percent. Blazevic has said he will triumph in the end and quot;bring back a smile to a tired and demoralised Croatia quot;. 

 Madrid: Valencia midfielder Miguel Angel Angulo has been banned for seven matches by Uefa for behaviour that led to him being sent off during a Champions League defeat by Werder Bremen earlier this month.

 The Spain international was dismissed for an ugly tackle on Paraguayan striker Nelson Valdez, whose two late goals ended the Spanish champions? hopes of qualification as they lost the Group G match 2-0 and had to settle for a place in the Uefa Cup. Angulo also spat at Werder midfielder Tim Borowski .

 Chennai: India?s Ritwik Bhattacharya and Saurav Ghosal moved into the semi-finals of the second world doubles squash meet on Wednesday. The Indians overcame Australian duo Dan Jenson and Cameron Pilley 9-3, 11-8, 4-9, 8-9, 9-6 in 71 minutes. Ritwik and Saurav will next meet Americans Jamie Crombie and Preston Quick.

 In the other quarter-finals, David Palmer and Anthony Ricketts (Australia) beat Safeerullah Khan and Farrukh Zaman (Pakistan) 9-3, 9-7, 9-7, while Byron David and Cameron White (Australia) saw off Roger Ngan and Wai Hang Wong (Hong Kong) 9-5, 9-6, 9-5. Crombie and Quick defeated Zaman brothers Mansoor and Shahid 8-9, 11-10, 9-7, 9-6.

 The Indian interest in the mixed doubles evaporated when Ghosal and Joshna Chinappa lost to Dianne Desira and Cameron White (Australia).

 Sydney: Former Wimbledon and US Open runner-up Mark Philippoussis has been given a wildcard entry for next month?s Sydney International. The 28-year-old Australian is trying to resurrect his career after winning only 11 matches this year and slumping to 109th in the world rankings.

 Open officials have already promised to give Philippoussis a wildcard entry for the first Grand Slam of the year and organisers of the Sydney event, held a week before the Open, have followed suit in the hope it will give him a boost.

 London: Tim Henman?s best year on the tennis tour was capped on Wednesday by the birth of his second daughter.

 The British No. 1 and wife Lucy are to call the girl Olivia. Their first child, Rosie, was born in 2002.

 London: England?s home Test matches will disappear from terrestial television after BSkyB won exclusive rights to cover live matches from 2006 to 2009, officials said on Wednesday. The ECB announced the deal at Lord?s.

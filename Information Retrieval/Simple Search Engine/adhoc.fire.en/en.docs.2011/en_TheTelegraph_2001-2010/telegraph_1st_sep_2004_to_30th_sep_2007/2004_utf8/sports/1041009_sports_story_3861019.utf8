 Oliver can?t take it anymore

 Kahn wants ?keeper issue to be resolved soon 

Berlin: Germany?s Oliver Kahn criticised teammate and rival Jens Lehmann on Friday for repeatedly claiming to be the country?s top goalkeeper. 

?Lehmann is constantly provoking and he?s been doing it for years,? Kahn told Bild newspaper on Friday after the Arsenal goalkeeper said earlier in the week he expected to be first-choice ?keeper by the 2006 World Cup. 

?I don?t have any problem with a rivalry, but it should be carried out on the pitch and not verbally,? said the 35-year-old Kahn, who is also Bayern Munich?s goalkeeper. 

?Perhaps he wants me to quit,? added Kahn, who led Germany to the 2002 World Cup final but has since been stripped of the captaincy by new coach Juergen Klinsmann. ?Or maybe he wants goalkeeping coach Sepp Maier to quit. The direction we?re headed isn?t good at all. It?s insane.? 

Maier, who coaches Kahn at both national and club level, has repeatedly endorsed him ahead of Lehmann and did so again ahead of a friendly against Iran on Saturday. Maier was rebuked by Klinsmann for similar comments in August. 

?The situation is escalating and has to be resolved,? said Kahn, who did not make the trip to Iran as part of a previously agreed rotation with Klinsmann and Lehmann. ?This can?t continue like this. We have to resolve it internally.? 

In Kahn?s view either he or Lehmann, 34, had to be named as the No. 1 goalkeeper before 2006, while the other man would have to leave. 

Klinsmann has stayed out of the dispute, saying only: ?Obviously we are going to have to have a talk about it. But we have got to get our priorities right and that is clearly the match on Saturday.?

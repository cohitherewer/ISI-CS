The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Series in bag, a shade before tea

 - Harbhajan, Kumble provide icing to victory 

INDRANIL MAJUMDAR

Calcutta: As Harbhajan Singh and Anil Kumble basked in the glory of their individual and cumulative achievements, Team India ?head honchos? chose to spend time a little away from the melee. The relief on the faces of Sourav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid and Sachin Tendulkar was evident as they engaged in a freewheeling conversation during the prize distribution ceremony. 

The celebrations were muted, but the series victory (achieved 13 minutes before tea) in varying ways has made them feel at ease. The spirit and emotion that held Team India together last season seemed to be on view at the Eden and the trio has largely been responsible for bringing the smiles back. Only time will tell whether this eight-wicket victory will put the team back on its revival path, but the groundwork for tougher battles ahead has begun on a positive note. 

The South Africans, going through a transition phase, were seen as hardly the opponents capable of giving the hosts a tough competition. Their performance may have exceeded most expectations, but the Indians showed dour attitude on the last two days to pull off the victory. In the end, as Graeme Smith admitted, they badly missed a quality spinner. 

Harbhajan had sent the alarm bells ringing Wednesday itself as the turn and bounce made him almost unplayable. If Jacques Kallis had managed to live through the night, courtesy a Daryl Harper error in judgement, Harbhajan ensured things were set right on the final morning. 

Kallis could add only three runs to his overnight 52 before pushing the ball back to Harbhajan?s hands. It was 183 for six and very little challenge remained in the visitors. 

Harper was again in the thick of things on the final morning when he gave Shaun Pollock caught at forward short leg off Harbhajan. The ball came of Pollock?s pads and Gautam Gambhir also seemed to have taken it on the first bounce. 

Justin Ontong was dismissed in the same over and it seemed Harbhajan would run through the side. The crowd was eagerly waiting for Kumble to reach the 434 mark as much as an Indian win. 

The leg-spinner, though, did not disappoint. He first removed Thami Tsolikile and, as Makhaya Ntini threatened an offensive, had him snicking to Dravid at first slip to equal Kapil Dev. The clenched fist said it all. 

The congratulations over, Kumble headed to the pavilion, holding the ball as souvenir, and pointing towards wife Chetna in the lower tier of the Club House. 

Harbhajan?s match haul of nine for 141 (seven in the second innings) may have fetched him the Man of the Match award, but Kumble?s four wickets should also rank alongside. It was their joint operation that singed South Africa and figures alone do not reveal all. 

A target of 117 was never going to be tough under the circumstances. But as the pacers failed to make an impression, Smith was forced to fall back on Justin Ontong, who switched from leg-spin to off-spin, to capitalise on the footmarks at the pavilion end. Jacques Rudolph was tried out and even Smith tried his off-breaks. Nicky Boje was sorely missed. 

For Sourav, this was a much sought-after win. He missed the last two Tests against Australia, lost the ODI against Pakistan and has been through the Clive Lloyd imposed ?ban? threat episode. It was essential to get back into the fold and this win will do him a world of good. 

The departure of Virender Sehwag ? the Man of the Series for his 262 runs ? and Gautam Gambhir had no adverse effect since Dravid and Sachin never allowed the pressure to get onto them by rotating the strike. The way Dravid has held fort confirmed his form and commitment to the side. 

Sachin, too, looked comfortable in the second essay. The ease with which he hit Ontong for a huge six over mid wicket must come as a fresh whiff of air to the side aiming to build on this success.

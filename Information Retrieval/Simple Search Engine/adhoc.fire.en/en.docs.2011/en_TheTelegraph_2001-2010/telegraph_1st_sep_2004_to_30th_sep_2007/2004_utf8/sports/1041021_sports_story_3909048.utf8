 Board in dilemma over Glazer

 SAM WALLACE 

Malcolm Glazer?s third purchase of Manchester United shares in five days left the club?s board Tuesday close to a potentially devastating choice over Old Trafford?s future: whether to recommend a takeover to shareholders or oppose a new owner. 

The American businessman raised his stake to 28.11 per cent, just a fraction away from the 30 per cent that would trigger a takeover, leaving United chief executive David Gill close to a decision on whether his board should support a takeover by Glazer. 

There has been bitter opposition from United fans? groups to Glazer, and should the Plc Board come out in support of him then it is likely that the directors? box at Old Trafford would become the focus of supporters? anger. However, as the chief executive of the club, Gill is duty-bound to examine what option would prove best for shareholders and the business. 

As United prepared to face Sparta Prague in the Champions League last night Gill remained in England for talks with the club?s lawyers and advisers. 

Glazer has spent almost ? 70 million on United shares in less than a week after his talks with the club?s major shareholder, John Magnier, broke down last Thursday. While he has not yet persuaded the Irish multi-millionaire to part with any of his 28.89 per cent stake, he could yet reach 30 per cent without his help, at which point he would have to make an offer to all the club?s shareholders. 

The United Plc board supported BskyB?s proposed ?623 million takeover which was eventually rejected by the government in April 1999, and their decision to recommend the Rupert Murdoch deal caused a rift with supporters which has still not healed.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Indians to retain the Eden XI

 - Sourav against record-only approach 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Team India captain Sourav Ganguly and Sachin Tendulkar at the Bangabandhu Stadium on Thursday 

Calcutta: Unless the Team India thinktank decides ? overnight ? to experiment, in the first Test against Bangladesh, the XI which did duty at the Eden last week (versus South Africa) will be retained. 

?As of now (late Thursday) the full side is going to be fielded,? was how a well-placed source told The Telegraph from Dhaka. 

Agencies add from Dhaka: Indian captain Sourav Ganguly, however, warned his teammates against taking Bangladesh lightly and against just looking for personal milestones during the series, saying the desire to break records should not affect the team?s strategy. 

?We cannot go into a Test looking at records. Anil (Kumble) and Sachin (Tendulkar) are obviously the two players who are in sight of records, but we cannot prepare for a match with such things in mind,? Sourav said on the eve of the first Test. 

Sourav said Bangladesh may not have an impressive track record but it was important to give them some more time to establish themselves. ?It is still early days for them. We have to give them time and people involved must be a patient. 

Kumble is on the verge of becoming India?s leading wicket-taker, having equalled Kapil Dev?s tally of 434 in the second and final Test against South Africa and Sachin is in search of that elusive century to move on a par with Sunil Gavaskar for most Test hundreds by an Indian. 

?However, we cannot take them lightly,? reiterated Sourav, arriving here after a gap of four years. He has still not forgotten the tough baptism he had as captain against Bangladesh. 

?I remember very well because it was my first Test as a captain. We were in a spot of bother after they had scored 400 and we were 200 for six in the first innings. We managed to win, but Bangladesh did well despite playing their very first Test,? Sourav said. 

The Indian captain was not unduly worried about the pitch at the Bangabandhu Stadium. ?The wicket looks a bit damp. It is winter, so it is going to be foggy as well,? he said. 

Bangladesh, meanwhile, are hoping to better their performance of the inaugural Test and have prepared a batting track. ?Our batsmen have done better on bouncy tracks outside Bangladesh, but they have not done well on low bouncing pitches at home,? Bangladesh captain Habibul Bashar said. 

The 32-year old right hand batsman, among those who made his Test debut that match in 2000, himself made a polished 71 while Aminul Islam became his country?s first to score a century. 

The host captain felt that the track, while making things easy for his batsmen, would help his bowlers too. 

?Against New Zealand, it was our bowling and fielding that helped us. Our batting wasn?t good. So I would say bowling is my strength for the moment,? he said. 

The pitch might offer only slow spin, somewhat blunting Harbhajan Singh and Anil Kumble. ?Harbhajan and Kumble are world class bowlers who can take wickets on any track. We have to counter them anyway,? Bashar said. 

The home team will be boosted by the return of pacers Mashrafe Mortaza and Talha Jubair, both of whom were coming back from a long injury lay-offs. 

The 21-year-old Mortaza is rated as a genuine fast bowler and has 29 wickets at 35.96. He has played in 12 matches so far since his debut in 2001-02. 

THE TEAMS 

India: Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly, V.V.S. Laxman, Dinesh Karthik, Irfan Pathan, Harbhajan Singh, Anil Kumble, Zaheer Khan.

 SA diplomat meets police chief

 Nicky Boje 

New Delhi: Amid apprehensions that Nicky Boje could be detained by Delhi Police for match-fixing interrogations, South Africa?s deputy high commissioner D. M. Nxiwemi Tuesday met commissioner of police K. K. Paul to discuss the issue. 

The diplomat is understood to have sought an assurance from Delhi Police that Boje would not be detained during the team?s tour of India starting November 12. 

Nxiwemi also said Boje would co-operate fully with the police in the investigations. 

Boje and one of his teammates, Herschelle Gibbs, have been under a cloud for their alleged involvement in the Hansie Cronje match-fixing scandal. While Gibbs opted out of the tour fearing interrogation, Boje, who has been named vice-captain, agreed to tour on the condition that he would not be detained. 

Boje is waiting for such an assurance, adds another report from Durban. ?Until such time he receives some sort of assurance he will not travel to India,? Gerald de Kock, a spokesperson for the United Cricket Board of South Africa, said Tuesday. 

?We are, however, hopeful that we will receive some communiqu? soon that will make it possible for Boje to join the team,? he added.

 IN THE CITY

 The eighth inter-school tennis championships, organised by the Indian Tennis Academy, will be held at the SAI Eastern Centre complex from Thursday to Sunday. 

 Twentytwo teams (including ten girls?) will take part.

 The tournament would be conducted on the Fed Cup format, which means that each game will be decided by the best of three matches ? two singles and one doubles tie.

 St James? and Calcutta Boys? have been seeded first and second, respectively. 

 Last year?s champions St Xavier?s Collegiate School have been seeded fourth this time and La Martiniere for Boys third. 

 The seedings have been made taking into account the cumulative AITA/BTA points of the members of the team.

 The CFL Super Division match between East Bengal and Mohammedan Sporting, which was originally scheduled to be held Saturday evening at the Salt Lake Stadium, will now instead be held next afternoon at the same venue, Subrata Dutta, IFA secretary, said on Wednesday.

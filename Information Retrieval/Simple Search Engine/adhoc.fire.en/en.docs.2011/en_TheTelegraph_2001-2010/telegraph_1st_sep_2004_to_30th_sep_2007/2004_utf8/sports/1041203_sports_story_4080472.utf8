The Telegraph - Calcutta

 ?Kumble should look beyond 500?

NILESH BHATTACHARYA

Calcutta: In a cricketing career spanning around 15 years, Anil Kumble must have trudged along quite a few rough blocks before equalling legendary Kapil Dev as the highest Indian Test wicket-taker on Thursday. 

But nothing seems to have been more agonising and depressing for him than missing out on sharing the dressing room with teammates soon after he received the Indian cap in 1990. He was dropped from the 1992 World Cup squad and the tour of Australia. 

Kumble returned to the squad during India?s tour of Zimbabwe and South Africa in 1992-93 and it was under Ajit Wadekar?s managership that the leg-spinner found his bearings. Since that season, Kumble has never looked back. 

?Kumble is a link between our old spin glory and the present,? is how Wadekar wishes to describe Kumble?s journey from a trying beginning to an institution in himself, with 434 wickets behind him. 

?To me what separates Kumble from others is his will to fight. He shouldn?t concentrate just on the 500-mark, but beyond,? Wadekar told The Telegraph on Thursday. 

Talking about Kumble at the start of his career, the former India captain felt that ?Kumble?s sincerity, hardwork and perseverance helped him survive that crucial period.? 

?He was and has been always there, giving hundred per cent and trying to get as many wickets as possible. A perfect teamman and an asset for Indian cricket,? said the former captain over phone from Nagpur. 

Like Kapil, maintained Wadekar, Kumble is certain to leave a legacy for the next generation. 

?Our traditional strength is spin, and that?s dying now. But whenever I see Kumble and Harbhajan bowling in tandem, it reminds me of those days when Bedi, Prasanna, Chandrasekhar and Venkatraghavan used to bowl. The upcoming generation will now look up to Kumble for inspiration,? opined Wadekar, who as team manager, had seen Kumble grow from 1992-93 till the 1996 World Cup. 

The 63-year-old, however, regarded Kumble?s 10-wicket haul in an innings (against Pakistan in New Delhi in 1999-2000) as the bowler?s ?standout moment?. 

?I still remember Kumble came to me and said that he wanted to bowl round the legs. He was not looking for record, but exploring variations to take wickets. That?s Kumble for you, a fighter as well as an innovator,? Wadekar, who watched that match from the Kotla?s stands, recalled.

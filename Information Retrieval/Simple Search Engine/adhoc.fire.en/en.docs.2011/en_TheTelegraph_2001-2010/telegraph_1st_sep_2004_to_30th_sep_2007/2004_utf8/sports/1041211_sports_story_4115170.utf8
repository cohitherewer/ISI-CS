Dhaka: Irfan Pathan produced a devastating spell to give India an early control of the first Test against Bangladesh who relied on their late-order batsmen to wriggle out of a complete disaster here on Friday. 

Pathan ripped through the top-order to return a career-best five for 45 on a truncated opening day?s play at the Bangabandhu National Stadium, but the hosts did quite well to recover from a precarious 50 for five before folding up for 184 in their first innings. 

Young Mohammed Ashraful top-scored with a gritty unbeaten 60 while Mohammed Rafique also contributed a useful 47 on a day which saw Anil Kumble become the highest wicket-taker in Indian Test history. 

Pathan?s heroic effort, combined with Zaheer Khan?s two for 51, almost denied Kumble his 435th Test scalp. Finally, the leg-spinner claimed two wickets off successive balls. He had equalled Kapil Dev?s record of 434 in Calcutta against South Africa. 

Bangladesh owed their total to 20-year-old middle-order batsman Ashraful whose unbeaten 60 lifted them from a disastrous 106 for seven at one stage. 

The Indian innings will resume Saturday after Gautam Gambhir and Virender Sehwag returned to the pavilion without facing a ball due to poor visibility. 

The host batsmen were found wanting in technique against the swing of Pathan who set himself twice for a hattrick but was denied on both the occasions. This was also Pathan?s maiden five-wicket haul. 

After picking three wickets in the new ball spell, Pathan returned for another destructive spell after tea and struck twice off the last two balls in his very first over.

Ashraful, who had thwarted his hattrick attempt earlier, once again rose to the occasion and denied the Baroda pacer his due. 

The diminutive Ashraful, who as a 16-year-old broke the record for youngest to score a century on debut against Sri Lanka in 2000-01, shared two vital partnerships that formed the backbone of the Bangladesh innings. 

Rafique played a cavalier innings at No. 9 and his 69-ball 47, studded with eight boundaries, provided the late thrust as the last five wickets added 134 runs. 

Rafique added 65 for the eighth wicket with Ashraful and his dare devil knock gave some nail-biting moments for Sourav before Kumble stepped up to provide the breakthrough. 

Last batsman Mashrafe Mortaza too threw his bat around for some useful runs towards the close under fading light. 

The Bangladeshi batsmen proved to be a sitting duck against a relentless opening spell by the Indian seamers after Sourav won his first toss in five Tests this season and put them in on a lively track. 

Bangladesh prepared a bouncy track going by their batsmen?s better performance abroad on hard wickets. 

But any hopes they had of an improved performance in the first full-fledged series against India were dented after overcast skies left enough dampness on the pitch. 

The start was delayed by two hours to allow for the pitch to dry enough but the remaining moisture proved to be too helpful for Pathan and Zaheer. 

Javed Omar (4) earned the first runs for the hosts with a sweetly timed boundary off Pathan in the third over, but the opener fell in the same over when he shouldered arms to a delivery that held its line after pitching. 

Pathan then struck successive blows in his fifth over as Nafis Iqbal (20) and Rajin Saleh (0) were declared lbw. 

A hush descended when captain and the most successful batsman Habibul Bashar (8) pulled Zaheer and found Sachin Tendulkar at backward square leg. 

Khaled Mashud (8) brought up the 50 after drinks break with a boundary behind point but Zaheer?s extra bounce snared him up two balls later. 

The hosts were in danger of folding up for their lowest total but for some adventurous batting by Manjural and a more refined knock by Ashraful. 

 Rafique?s joining Ashraful turned out to be the most fruitful partnership. 

Kumble trapped Rafique plumb in front with a trademark top-spinner. The very next ball, Kumble put himself on a hattrick when a thin bat-pad chance from Tapash Baisya was taken at first slip by Rahul Dravid. 

Kumble said it was a great feeling to get past the record of a legend like Kapil, who he had looked up to always. 

?I?ve played with Kapil paaji. My first three or four years were with him, so it?s really nice to go past somebody you have looked up to from a young age. To be alongside him and then cross him, after having watched him on TV at one stage, is really good.? 

Later, Mortaza was run out when he tried to scramble a single off Kumble to leave Ashraful stranded at the other end.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Bagan win by lone goal

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Eduardo Coelho scored versus George Telegraph 

Calcutta: Mohun Bagan defeated George Telegraph by a solitary goal in the CFL Super Division championship leg match at Kalyani Stadium on Saturday. 

Brazilian defender Eduardo Coelho scored the all-important goal in the 30th minute. Following a corner, Eduardo found the net from a melee. 

However, despite the victory, the match never rose to much heights. The ground was in good shape, but still the Bagan strikers failed to utilise the conditions. 

Coach Subrata Bhattacharya rued the number of missed chances and was clearly not happy with the day?s performance. Mohun Bagan are currently based in Kalyani for their league matches, the next to be played on September 28 against Ever-Ready. 

The coach did not field Brazilian Roberto Beto in the day?s match. ?He needs a little bit of conditioning. He would be playing in the next match,? Bhattacharya said. Nigerian Suleiman Hamid, who partnered Sunil Chettri upfront failed to leave a mark. Biman Mondal, however, did score a second for the club in the second half, but was disallowed due to offside. 

Meanwhile, in the CFL Super Division relegation play-off matches, Railway FC defeated Mohammedan AC 1-0 at Rabindra Sarobar, Wari AC beat FCI by the same margin at Howrah Stadium while the match between Peerless SC and CFC at Barasat Stadium ended goalless.

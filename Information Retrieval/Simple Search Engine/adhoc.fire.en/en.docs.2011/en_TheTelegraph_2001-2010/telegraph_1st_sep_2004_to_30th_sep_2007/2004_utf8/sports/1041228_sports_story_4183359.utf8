 Lanka decision on tour today

Wellington: Sri Lanka Cricket officials have put off until Tuesday a decision on whether its tour of New Zealand will continue following devastating tidal waves which killed more than 6,000 people in the island nation. 

The team held talks with New Zealand Cricket officials Monday and will consult with its own board before making a final decision on the tour?s future. Sri Lanka were scheduled to play the second of five limited-overs Internationals against New Zealand on Wednesday at Napier, but that match has been postponed to a tentative date of January 11. 

The third match at Queenstown is scheduled for Sunday, which New Zealand officials hope will be go ahead as planned. 

?The last thing on our minds right now is cricket,? manager Brendon Kuruppu said at a news conference in Napier Monday. ?One player?s relative has lost his life and so many others have no contact with their relatives. It is a very sad situation for us.? 

Kuruppu said several issues needed to be resolved before it could be decided whether the team would play their remaining matches. 

?It?s too early. It?s not even 24 hours since the disaster. So we are still in the process of gathering information.? 

New Zealand Cricket chief executive Martin Snedden said he was liaising closely with the Sri Lankan team. 

?We?re just trying to work through a process at the moment. We don?t know (if the tour will continue). That?s the answer,? Snedden said. 

Earlier, the board said in a statement after an emergency meeting in Colombo: 

 ?Sri Lanka Cricket has reached an agreement with New Zealand Cricket to reschedule the rest of the one-day Internationals and Test matches and the revised dates will be notified later.? 

Sri Lanka and New Zealand are also set to play two Tests, in Hamilton from January 15-19 and Wellington from January 22-26. 

 U-19 tour postponed 

Meanwhile, Sri Lanka have also postponed an under-19 cricket tour to Pakistan following the tsunami, adds another report from Karachi. 

?The Sri Lankan board has informed us that they have postponed the tour indefinitely,? PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan said Monday. (REUTERS)

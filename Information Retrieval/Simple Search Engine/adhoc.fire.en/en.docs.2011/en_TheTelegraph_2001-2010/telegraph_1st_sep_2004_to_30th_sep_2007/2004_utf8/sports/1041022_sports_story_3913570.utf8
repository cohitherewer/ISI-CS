 Humpy loses, but India draw level

 - CHESS OLYMPIAD - Crushing victory for men over Holland 

 Nisha had little trouble in securing a draw 

Mallorca: Grandmaster Koneru Humpy suffered a shocking defeat but the India women bounced back to hold Hungary in the sixth round of the 36th chess Olympiad at the Casino Gran on Wednesday. 

Meanwhile, Viswanathan Anand and Surya Sekhar Ganguly powered the men?s team to a 3-1 win over Holland (as reported in Thursday?s Late City edition). The fine win over the eighth seeded Dutchmen, took India to the joint third spot in the standing list along with Bulgaria on 17 points. 

Among women, top seed and defending champions China stamped their authority over second seed Russia with a 2-1 win and maintained their huge three points lead over France that holds the sole second spot at this stage on 13 points. 

The Indians managed 1.5 points against Hungary which was enough to propel them to share the third spot with Russia, Ukraine, United States, Bulgaria and Armenia, all of whom are on 12 points. 

Humpy essayed modern defence against Szidonia Vajda who seemed a little tense at the start of the game. The Indian played the opening in a subtle way and gained control of the centre with thematic manoeuvres leading to a slight advantage. 

Humpy then went for an all out attack against the king and sacrificed a pawn on the queen side that proved a mistake in the end as she also had to sacrifice a bishop to continue the attack. 

Vajda was resourceful in her defence and managed to pass her king almost through a minefield and cross fire of the opponent forces to safety on the queen side. 

With her king guided to a safe corner, the reassurance on Vajda?s face was there for all to see as the extra piece became a decisive factor. 

The Hungarian survived the remaining complications easily before spelling disaster for the Indian girl. The game lasted 51 moves. 

Thankfully for the Indians, S. Vijayalakshmi struck form yet again and crushed Anita Gara in a one sided affair to score the equaliser. 

On the third board, Nisha Mohota had little trouble in securing the draw with black pieces. Playing the Sicilian Nazdorf that occurs rarely in her games, Nisha got a balanced position in the middle game and signed peace in just 14 moves. 

The Ukrainian men grounded the talented Azerbaijanis 2.5-1.5 to stretch their lead to a full point. The chess superpowers are now sitting on 19 points. 

However, it was the top seed and defending champions Russia who caught everyone?s fancy in the sixth round as Peter Svidler guided his team to a very impressive 3.5-0.5 triumph over Israel. 

Svidler, who is highly regarded the world over, was not present in Mallorca for the first few rounds and his arrival on Wednesday gave Russia, winner of the last six Olympiads, the momentum it was lacking thus far. 

Significantly, India is the only team in the Olympiad thus far that has won all its matches. Even leaders Ukraine have conceded one draw to Israel while the Russians were tamed by the leaders in the fourth round itself. 

While Anand and Ganguly won their respe- ctive boards, the other two Indians ? Krishnan Sasikiran and Abhijit Kunte ? split points with their rivals. 

Playing white, Anand was up against a Sicilian opening, an opening he particularly does not like, adopted by Loek van Wely. But that failed to deter Anand as he changed directions as early as on the 10th move surprising his opponent with a knight retreat that is played very rarely. 

The move seemed to have paid off as the Dutchman committed an error which was followed by a flurry of attacks by the Indian. 

?We could have just agreed to a draw had he played correctly, but then I just didn?t quite understand why he was panicking,? Anand said.Van Wely resigned after a few unnecessary checks that could not change the course of the game. 

?It keeps life interesting?, said Anand when asked about what prompted him to try new things against the Sveshnikov. 

Surya appears to be in great form if his games are any indication and Erik van dan Doel proved no match against his onslaught on the third board. 

Playing on the second board, Sasikiran drew with Sergei Tiviakov from the black side of Sicilian game. Indians could have done a little better had Kunte kept his cool after attaining a winning position against Friso Nijboer on the fourth board.

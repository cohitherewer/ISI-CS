Birmingham: Michael Vaughan found his one-day feet at last as England stunned world champions Australia to reach the Champions Trophy final on Tuesday. 

Their six-wicket success, completed with 3.3 overs to spare, was their first one-day victory over the Australians in five-and-a-half years, ending a 14-match losing streak. 

Vaughan, following a wretched run of form with the bat, could do no wrong at Edgbaston as he won the toss, took two key wickets with his occasional off spinners and completed a neat run-out as the Australians were restricted to 259 for nine. 

Vaughan then anchored his side to victory with a well-paced 86, his best score in one-dayers. He and opener Marcus Trescothick (81) put on a rapid 140 for the second wicket to wreck Ricky Ponting?s tactic of sweeping England away with a battery of pace bowlers. 

Andrew Strauss sealed the win with an impressive 52 not out off 42 balls in his first match against the Australians. Put in and seeking to win the title for the first time, the world champions never looked at their best, with Damien Martyn top-scoring with 65. 

England have never reached a Champions Trophy final. West Indies and Pakistan meet in the second semi-final on Wednesday, with the final at The Oval on Saturday. 

Vaughan, a fine Test technician but struggling to adapt to the shorter game, found the perfect foil in Trescothick. The left-hander?s aggression allowed Vaughan to play an innings based on his classic technique. So often before he has over-improvised. 

He was still sticking to rotating the strike when Trescothick smashed Glenn McGrath out of the attack with four boundaries off the ninth over. When Vaughan did attack, however, he did so with devastating precision. 

The 15th over of the innings, from Brett Lee, was to cost 18 as Vaughan clattered him through the covers repeatedly and then whipped him over mid-on. The England captain smashed six boundaries off 12 deliveries from the fastest bowler in the world. 

Trescothick fell in the 32nd over and Vaughan continued until near the end before he toe-ended an attempted pull off Lee straight up in the air. 

Lee, brought into the team to intimidate England, ended bruised and battered after taking two for 65 off 8.3 overs. 

Feasting on some short-pitched bowling, Australia cruised to 96 for two after 20 overs only for Vaughan to turn to left-arm spinner Ashley Giles ? considered by many as the team?s weak bowling link ? while serving up his off-spin from the other end. 

Giles strangled the scoring before completing figures of one for 40. His dismissal of Ponting, who misjudged the flight and chipped to long on after making 29, was a key moment.

Calcutta: It was a great Christmas gift for Joseph Chakola Saturday. At the Goodricke East India amateur golf championship which concluded at the par-70 Royal Calcutta Golf Club, Chakola beat A. S. Lehal 5 amp;4 to win the title. 

The event was a part of the eastern swing on the Royal Challenge Indian (amateur) Golf Tour. 

The final, a 36-hole affair, saw Chakola on top from the very beginning. The Coimbatore lad first moved into the lead on the fourth hole when Lehal?s second shot hit the tank and the recovery cost him a bogey. Chakola made par. 

He then went on to win the next three holes to be 4-up after seven holes, the scoreline reading the same after both tied the eighth and ninth holes. 

Chakola then claimed the tenth hole with the next two being halved. Lehal won his first hole of the match when he made par as against Chakola?s bogey on the 13th. The score was now 4-up in Chakola?s favour. 

The following hole saw Chakola?s putter do magic when he sank a difficult left-to-right, 30-feet putt to record a birdie with Lehal scoring a par. With both players making birdies on the 15h, Lehal claimed the 16th for his own. On the 17th the Chandigarh player missed a birdie and a chance to halve another hole when his ball stopped right at the edge of the cup. With Chakola making a birdie on this hole and a par on the next, he had a comfortable lead of six against his name at the end of 18 holes. 

The second round began with Lehal taking charge as he made a birdie on the 19th with Chakola having to contend with a par. 

Lehal went on to win the next hole and tied the 21st with Chakola. The score at this stage was 4-up in favour of Chakola who then claimed the 22nd, 23rd and 25th holes for himself to be 7-up. He bettered this score by one on the 28th when he recorded par against Lehal?s bogey. 

Lehal won the next three holes ? 29th , 30th , 31st ? on the trot but it was too late by then. He was still five holes down and there were just four holes left to play. 

For 20-year old Chakola, the day was even more special since this was his first win in Calcutta. ?Even though I have been coming to Calcutta for events since I was 14, this is my maiden title and I am obviously delighted beyond words,? he said.

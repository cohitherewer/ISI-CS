The Telegraph - Calcutta

Indians need to unwind and relax

- Pakistan must jell strategy and planning with natural flair

If Australia is the benchmark of excellence and beating 

Pakistan an emotional high, then India on both counts have recently faltered to 

fall short of the mark. Both teams have their own patches of worry. Pakistan have 

a problem of ?scarcity?. In economic terms, it refers to a situation of ?limited 

resources? and ?unlimited wants?. If translated into cricketing terms, it would 

mean something like limited talent and unlimited expectations.

India is faced with the other extreme syndrome ? unlimited 

talent and limited reserves.

Let?s face it. Pakistan today have only the basic 

talent to showcase and for a team to grow into a consistent side, it is imperative 

that whatever talent is on view, it is managed and harnessed in a highly-energised 

cricket environment.

When you do not have a ring of world-class players, 

you have to then follow a given gameplan. Now, that maybe asking a lot from a 

team like Pakistan which has by tradition overcome crisis through individual brilliance 

rather than a chalked-out strategy.

Yet, there have been examples, especially under Imran 

Khan, of youngsters who were not ?natural born-killers? but became ?giant-killers? 

because they were exposed to a healthy and competitive cricket environment. The 

process eventually seasoned them into world class players.

Who would know this better than Inzamam himself who 

was part of the brigade. He, as a leader, now has to create the same magic and 

intensity. To help them is coach Bob Woolmer who every Pakistani thinks as a ?Bob 

wand? to lift Pakistan of all its misery.

For Pakistan to do well, it would mean change of style. 

The tricky part will be how well they jell this culture of strategy and planning 

with the natural flair that has epitomised Pakistan cricket.

India today, more than anything else, has made the 

impression of a team that is not enjoying this sport. The three simple, yet big, 

alphabets are missing from their dictionary ? RUN.

Of late, the bunch has appeared to be tense, at times 

lost. Too much focus on the job, too many serious individuals, too many individual 

individuals ? take your pick.

The nucleus of this team is batting. All batting stars 

are senior key members of the team. When they flop, not only do India lose matches, 

but their failure seems to grip the entire team. Then, even the fizz of Harbhajan 

or the serenity and sobriety of Kumble is not enough to shake the team out of 

a ?special coma? ? at least, that is what appeared on TV until they won the last 

Test match in Mumbai.

At times, and purely for professional reasons, it 

is important for teams to smile to ease the frustration out of the system. This 

may also send the right signals to the opposition that the team may be down but 

have not yet hit the mat.

This was one thing that was frequently echoed by our 

guru Imran Khan so that players can relax and perform to the best of their potential.

I distinctly remember two important team meetings 

under him. One was in 1988 when we were touring the West Indies, who were then 

the best in the world. The other instance relates to the final of the 1992 World 

Cup.

During the first one he constantly reminded us the 

importance of self-belief, self pride and to look at the contest as an opportunity 

to excel and become best players and the best team in the world, a title which, 

by the way, we won that season. The other centred at making the team relax. We 

were asked to enjoy the event, the atmosphere and the mega stage of a World Cup 

final, something that we may never experience again in our career.

We were lucky to have two guys who always kept us 

in good spirits ? Mudassar, who would make you laugh every minute in the dressing 

room, and Javed, who kept us smiling on the field even when the chips were down. 

Even though this kind of contribution cannot be weighed in statistics, yet, they 

kept the spirits high in trying circumstances.

This Indian team has enough talent to enjoy the sport, 

but amazingly, they seem to have forgotten how to unwind. Parthiv Patel, for example, 

aged dramatically during the Australia series. He developed a frown that ill-suited 

his soft face, and finally ended the series with a bigger frown.

Failures should never take away the fun from the game. 

Maybe it is time for India to change from being grim to gorgeous. Maybe a win 

against Pakistan on Saturday can bring a Michael Clarke smile on their face. Even 

if they do not succeed a smile may be good enough for all of us.

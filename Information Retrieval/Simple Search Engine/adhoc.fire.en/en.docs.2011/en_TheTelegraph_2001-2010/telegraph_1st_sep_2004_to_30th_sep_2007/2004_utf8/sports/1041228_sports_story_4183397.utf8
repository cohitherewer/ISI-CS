 Sydney: Tennis great Martina Navratilova will compete in the WTA Australian hardcourt championships on the Gold Coast early next month, organisers said on Monday. Navratilova, winner of 58 Grand Slam titles, will partner Nathalie Dechy of France. The American was coaxed out of retirement by Indian mixed doubles partner Leander Paes earlier this month.

 Navratilova played in last year?s tournament in her first trip to Australia in 14 years when she teamed up with Russia?s Svetlana Kuznetsova to take the doubles championship. The Australian hardcourt title was one of five doubles crowns she won with Kuznetsova last year. Since turning pro in 1975, Navratilova has won 167 singles and 174 doubles titles.

 The Australian hardcourt championships, scheduled from January 2 to 8 is a lead-up to the Australian Open, starting in Melbourne on January 17. 

 Jerusalem: Portsmouth midfielder Eyal Berkovic says he will never play for Israel under coach Avraham Grant.

 Berkovic, who has represented his country 82 times, was axed by Grant before the World Cup qualifying campaign.

 ?I am not going back to play for Israel... I have been pensioned off,? Berkovic said in a television interview on Israel?s Channel Five. 

 ?It?s over. As long as Avraham (Grant) is there, it?s over.? Grant has, however, said the door is not permanently closed for the 32-year-old.

 Israel are level on points with European qualifying group IV leaders Ireland and France and are still in contention for a place in the 2006 World Cup finals. 

 Zagreb: Croatian soccer club Dinamo Zagreb are set to sell midfielder Niko Kranjcar after a series of rows between the former captain and management this season.

 The 21-year-old will be put on the transfer list after he refused to accept a salary cut following the club?s poor performances this season.

 Dinamo vice-president Zdravko Mamic said the son of national coach Zlatko Kranjcar no longer deserved to play for the club.

 London: Former National Football League (NFL) all-time sacks leader Reggie White has died. He was 43. White, a defensive lineman who retired in 2000 after 15 years in the NFL, suffered a massive heart attack at his North Carolina home.

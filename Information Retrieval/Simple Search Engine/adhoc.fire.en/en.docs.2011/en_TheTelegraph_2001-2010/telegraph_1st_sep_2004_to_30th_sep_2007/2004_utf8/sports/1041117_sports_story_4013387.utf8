 New York: Former world heavyweight champion Evander Holyfield has been placed on indefinite medical suspension by the New York State Athletic Commission after a loss here on Saturday, the New York Daily News reported. 

 Larry Donald won a unanimous 12-round decision over the 42-year-old Holyfield, who won only one round according to two judges and got just two from the other.

 Holyfield will have to be cleared by Barry Jordan, a commission physician, before he will be cleared to fight anywhere in the United States because other states will honour the ban, said Ron Stevens, the commission chairman. 

 Buenos Aires: Paraguayan goalkeeper Jose Luis Chilavert fittingly scored during his farewell testimonial match at Argentine first division club Velez Sarsfield.

 The 39-year-old former Paraguay captain, who notched 56 goals from penalties and free-kicks during a 24-year career, equalised from the spot in a 2-1 win over a South American All Stars team in Monday night?s game.

 Both sides were made up largely of retired players, Velez fielding many of the team that Chilavert helped to win the South American Libertadores Cup and World Club Cup 10 years ago.

 London: Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard says he is ready to make his comeback at Middlesbrough on Saturday after a two-month injury absence.

 Gerrard, who broke a bone in his foot during Liverpool?s 2-1 Premier League defeat by Manchester United on September 20, came through 45 minutes of a reserve match on Monday unscathed.

 ?Hopefully I?ll be included in the squad at the weekend,? the England midfielder told Sky Sports News. ?I?ve taken my time and been really patient, and the doctors and physios have been brilliant.? 

 Brussels: Six-time Tour de France champion Lance Armstrong plans to compete in next year?s one-day Tour of Flanders race.

 ?I want to prove to the world that I can also do this,? Armstrong was quoted as saying in Belgian newspaper Het Volk on Tuesday.

 His comment was made during an interview to be broadcast on Dutch television in January.

 The 257-kilometre Tour of Flanders from Bruges to Meerbeke takes place on April 3. Some of the route is over cobbled roads where riders risk falls.

 Armstrong is the only rider in history to win July?s Tour de France six times. He suggested earlier this month, though, that he may skip next year?s race to chase other ambitions.

 Canberra: The Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) will spend A$17.8 million (US$13.7 million) to help top athletes like swimmers Ian Thorpe and Grant Hackett prepare for the 2008 Games.

 ?The AOC funding for athletes includes A$8.2 million to the national sporting federations to spend on international competition in the lead-up to Beijing, A$4.6 million for medallists and their coaches (and) A$5 million to develop young athletes in the 2005 and 2007 (Youth Olympic Festivals),? the AOC said in a statement on Tuesday.

 Moin axed, Akmal in

Karachi: Pakistan have dropped wicketkeeper Moin Khan for the second Test against Sri Lanka starting on Thursday because of his indifferent form with the bat. 

?Moin has been dropped from the team and we have called up Kamran Akmal for the second Test on the request of the team management,? chief selector Wasim Bari said on Monday. 

Pakistan lost the first Test in Faisalabad by a massive 201 runs and captain Inzamam-ul-Haq indicated that Moin may have played his last Test because of his recent poor form. 

?Moin has been struggling for batting form and we are going to try out Akmal,? Bari said. Moin, who has played 69 Tests and 219 one-day Internationals scored just five and one in the first test. Bari said 18-year-old reserve keeper Zulqarnain Haider would remain in the 15-member squad. 

Earlier, Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer had asked for a third wicketkeeper to be added to the squad, signalling the end of Moin?s distinguished international career. 

Akmal, 22, has played six Tests and 12 one-day Internationals. His last Test appearance was against India in Rawalpindi in April.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Players? protest rocks national A

 - Premier tournament delayed by a day 

A STAFF REPORTER

 Barua amp; Co. are opposed to a change in format 

Calcutta: The national A chess championship failed to take off in Visakhapatnam on Friday following a strong players? protest over some decisions taken at the annual general meeting of the All India Chess Federation (AICF) in Kochi last fortnight. 

The country?s premier chess event will, however, get underway on Saturday after the players got the assurance they were looking for. 

The main issue was a change in format proposed by the AICF without consulting the top players, as is the tradition. ?It was decided last year that the top eight finishers in the national A and the top 14 from the national B meet would qualify directly for next year?s national A,? GM Dibyendu Barua told The Telegraph from Visakhapatnam. 

?But at the Kochi GM, where no players? representative was present, the AICF decided to reduce that number to six and 12, respectively. We are not saying it?s right or wrong to change the format. Our protest is against this unilateral decision without discussing it with the top players,? explained Barua. 

All the top players, who have recently come under the Indian Chess Players? Association (ICPA) fold, agreed not to take this lying down and refused to start the tournament on Friday. 

A letter, on behalf of the AICF, was e-mailed to P.T. Ummerkoya informing the AICF secretary of the players? stand. 

?We agreed to start the matches tomorrow (Saturday) only after the organising secretary Mr V.R. Bobba gave it to us in writing, after speaking to Mr Ummerkoya, that the old format will remain in place,? Barua informed. 

There was another AICF decision which the players didn?t like. Having agreed to withdraw the proposed 10 per cent deduction from players? prize-money, the AICF did so with effect from December 31, 2004. 

?Why have they fixed that date? Why not from the day they imposed that deduction? They could at least have done it from the day they took the decision. Prize-money is an important source of income for most players, why deprive them?? argued Barua. 

But why did the players wait for nearly two weeks to react to these AICF decisions rather than resolving the dispute well before the national A? 

?Actually Mr Ummerkoya was due to come for the opening ceremony of the national A and we thought we?d discuss the issue then and sort things out,? Barua said. ?But the AICF secretary didn?t turn up and we were left with no option but to write to him.? 

Not a very convincing defence that.

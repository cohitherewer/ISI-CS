The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Captains to be feted seniority-wise

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The winners of the Platinum Jubilee one-dayer between India and Pakistan will receive $25,000 while the runners-up will be richer by $15,000, Platinum Jubilee committee chairman Jagmohan Dalmiya said on Friday. The Man-of-the-Match will get $5000, he added. 

Dalmiya also disclosed that the captains will be felicitated according to seniority. However, Inzamam-ul Haq, Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid will be feted at the beginning to allow them time to relax before the match. 

Meanwhile, former captains Nari Contractor, Chandu Borde, Ajit Wadekar, Gundappa Vishwanath and Dilip Vengsarkar from India, and Hanif Mohammed, Imtiaz Ahmed, Zaheer Abbas and Rameez Raja from Pakistan have reached the city. 

Dalmiya said that apart from speaker Somnath Chatterjee and Union sports minister Sunil Dutt, state sports minister Subhas Chakraborty will also be present at Eden Gardens on Saturday. 

The chairman of the Platinum Jubilee committee informed that in case of disruption, provisions will be there to extend the match half an hour. 

The organisers expect a full house. Some tickets priced at Rs 1500 will be sold from the Mohammedan Sporting ground on Saturday as well.

 GFA fails to learn from Junior?s death

 - Another tragedy averted in 2nd div. tie

Margao: The Goa Football Association (GFA) seemed not to have learnt any lesson from the tragic on-field death of Dempo striker Cristiano Junior. 

Once again they failed to provide medical facilities to a player during a local second division league match at Varca grounds on Sunday nearly costing him his life. 

The incident occurred ten minutes into the match when the goalkeeper of Mundvel Sports Club and ABC Benaulim Sports Club midfielder went in for an aerial ball. 

It is believed that the midfielder?s elbow hit goalkeeper Alex on the chest, leaving him unconscious on the ground for nearly five minutes. 

With no medical facilities available from GFA side, officials tried hard to regain his consciousness. 

It was only after sustained mouth-to-mouth resuscitation by one of the players, Alex gained consciousness and was latter taken to a nearby doctor where his condition was reported to be stable. 

A GFA official admitted that Sunday?s incident was indeed an eye opener for the football body. 

The official said the association ought to give a deep thought to the medical requirements during all GFA leagues matches. 

?We spend quite an amount on the referees and the match commissioner to supervise a match. Requisitioning the services of a doctor on match basis would not make much difference,? he stated. (PTI)

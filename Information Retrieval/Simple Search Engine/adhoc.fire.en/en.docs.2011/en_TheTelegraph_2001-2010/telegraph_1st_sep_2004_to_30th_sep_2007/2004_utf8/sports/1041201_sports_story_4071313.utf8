 ICC officials in Kenya

Nairobi: Two International Cricket Council (ICC) officials arrived in Kenya on Tuesday to carry out investigations linked to the Maurice Odumbe inquiry. 

They are expected to interview players who represented Kenya between July 1999 and June 2000 over the next two days. 

Former Kenya captain Odumbe was banned for five years by his national cricket board in August for inappropriate contact with a bookmaker. Former Zimbabwean Supreme Court Judge Ahmed Ebrahim, in his report on the case, said Odumbe?s behaviour had been ?dishonest and devious?. (Reuters)

 Reid: Indians will rediscover intensity

 Bruce Reid feels India can get back to the form they were in during the tours to Australia and Pakistan 

Nottingham: The beleaguered Indian team found some much needed psychological boost with bowling coach Bruce Reid saying Sourav Gangulys men had the ability to lift their intensity in the NatWest Challenge and the Champions Trophy in England. 

They came out of a break after the superb showing in Australia and Pakistan and immediately it is not easy to get back into groove, said the former Australian seamer, whose services the Indians have sought to get their bowling combination sorted out. 

But they have a couple of big tournaments in England and you would find the intensity would lift. They would be back where they were in Australia and Pakistan. 

By what Reid saw of the Indian fast bowlers in the last two days, the former left-arm pacer is pleased with the progress Irfan Pathan has made and feels Lakshmipathy Balaji has gone a little away from what he had advised the young Tamil Nadu fast bowler in Australia. 

Irfan is okay but Balaji has tried out a few things. They are very young and have got enormous talent. Young boys always try and change a few things and talk to other people as well. 

They are learning and trying to do what is best for them. Between my knowledge and theirs, we try to work out what is best for them. 

Reid is also pleased by what he has seen of Ashish Nehra. 

Ash Nehra looks better than what he did in Australia. He has got over a couple of niggles and is getting through to the crease better. Hope- fully he can now bowl well again. 

So we should make a good unit with couple of left-arm pacers and couple of right armers. 

Reid said in his association with the team in the last two days, he has impressed on them to try and bowl as many slower deliveries and yorkers as possible. 

Obviously they are going to play a major role, especially in the last 10 overs when it is crucial these deliveries come into play. 

Reid said even though his stint with the Indians would be interrupted during the NatWest Challenge because of his commitments with Hampshire, he will again be available for five days (between the matches against Kenya and Pakistan) during the Champions Trophy. 

I have a fly-in, fly-out kind of scenario with the Indians and thats because I was already committed to Hampshire when I worked with them in Australia last year. 

Meanwhile, Pathan said he knew the conditions in England too well to have any difficulty in adjusting his line and length. 

Of course the length here is different but this is not the first time I am making a trip to England. This is my fourth trip and I understand the conditions, said Pathan. 

Pathan does not think that the failure of the batsmen is putting extra pressure on the bowlers. 

Batting failures or not, as bowlers we have our targets in mind. In any case, batting failures dont affect me as I concentrate on the stuff which I have to perform, he said. 

Pathan welcomed the return of Reid. His concentration was on action and it always helps my bowling when I keep my action simple, said Pathan.

 Federer makes a winning return

Houston: World No.1 Roger Federer made a winning return from injury on Monday, opening the defence of his Masters Cup crown with a ruthless 6-1, 7-6 (7-4) win over Gaston Gaudio. 

It was the only match to be completed as a steady drizzle that had already wiped out doubles play finally halted Lleyton Hewitt?s tie against Spain?s Carlos Moya with the Australian leading 5-4. 

A left thigh strain suffered while preparing for his home tournament in Basel nearly a month ago had threatened to cut Federer?s season short. 

But the 23-year-old Swiss was quickly back at his brilliant best, easing past the French Open champion in 91 minutes and with a minimum of fuss in the opening Red Group match. 

Having not played competitively since claiming his 10th title of the season in Bangkok six weeks ago, Federer could not have asked for a better opponent for his opening round-robin match of the $4.45-million season finale. 

The only debutant in the elite eight-player field, Gaudio?s prowess on clay is in sharp contrast to his struggles on the North American hardcourts, having claimed just two wins on the surface since the U.S. Open. 

?I?m quite relieved to have played my first match and come back after a long time without a tournament, without playing a match,? said Federer, after posting his 19th consecutive win over a top-10 ranked opponent. 

?I?m very happy with my game. I went two weeks without playing. Beating a player like Gaston is very satisfying,? he added. 

When play resumed, Gaudio held serve but Federer seized control on his next opportunity hammering a running forehand winner down the line to break the Argentine and go up 3-1. 

Now back to his familiar flowing rhythm, Federer stormed through the next four games taking the set in just 31 minutes. 

In the second, Gaudio offered some stern resistance but the feisty Argentine was never able to penetrate Federer?s defences. 

The evening match finally got under way following a three hour rain delay with both players struggling to find their rhythm. Hewitt was the first to take the initiative, breaking Moya to go in front 4-3, but the Spaniard broke back immediately at 4-4 just as more rain forced another 10-minute delay.

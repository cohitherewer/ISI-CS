 Ponting wary of Vettori

Sydney: Skipper Ricky Ponting has warned his Australian batsmen to see off the threat from New Zealand spinner Daniel Vettori in the second Chappell-Hadlee Trophy one-day International here. 

Vettori had a big impact in the Black Caps? four-wicket victory over the world champions in the opening game in Melbourne on Sunday. 

Australia were set for a score of around 300 but lost four of their top-order batsmen, with Vettori claiming three quick wickets and cutting off the run flow of the world champions. 

The Australians were restricted to 246 for nine and New Zealand won the match with two balls to spare. 

Ponting expects the left-arm spinner to relish the slow and turning Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) pitch for Wednesday?s pivotal game of the best-of-three series. 

?He?s a quality bowler in both forms of the game and he certainly bowled beautifully the other night ? he?s bowled well right through this tour so far,? Ponting said on Tuesday. 

?He varies his pace well and he turns the ball just enough ? that SCG wicket will suit him so it?s up to us to make sure we don?t give him our wickets. 

?If we can get through his 10 overs without being too aggressive and without giving him too many wickets, we should score freely off the other guys.? 

Ponting also expects veteran allrounder Chris Harris to play in Sydney after missing the opening game last weekend. 

Harris plays a limited amount of cricket these days and is usually reserved for pitches which suit his slow, crafty bowling variations. 

?Harris may come in on that wicket,? Ponting said. ?He?s a great fielder and a handy lower-order batsman as well but I?m not sure where he?ll fit into their side. I think the side they had the other night was pretty well balanced.? 

Ponting indicated the weather may play a part in Australia?s selection, with spinner Brad Hogg likely to miss out if forecast rain eventuates. 

?Bowling spin with a wet ball is very difficult so if it does rain Hoggy may miss out,? Ponting said.

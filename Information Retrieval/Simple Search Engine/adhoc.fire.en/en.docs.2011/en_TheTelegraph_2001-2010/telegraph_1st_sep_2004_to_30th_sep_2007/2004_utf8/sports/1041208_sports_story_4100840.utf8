The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Rach all praise for forwards

 Arjun Halappa scored the second goal vs Germany 

Lahore: Indian coach Gerhard Rach said his side?s 3-1 win over Germany in the Champions Trophy hockey tournament should put to rest doubts over the forwards? scoring abilities. 

Rach, breathing easy after India?s first win in the tournament, said his team played ?wonderfully well? to ensure three points from the match after trailing 0-1 at half time. 

?We played wonderfully well, particularly in the second half. We had tried hard for the equaliser in the first half itself, but somehow that did not materialise,? Rach said after the match. 

Sandeep Michael opened the account in the second half, followed by strikes from Arjun Halappa and Vivek Gupta. 

?Now no one should ask anything about the forwards. They played really well and scored from most of the chances that came their way,? he said. 

With Wednesday?s crucial match against Pakistan likely to determine whether India make it to the top four, Rach said his team will give its best. 

?Pakistan are no doubt the better team. We definitely have a hard game against them. We are trying hard in the tournament and we will do the same tomorrow. If we win it will be wonderful for the country.? 

Rach also reiterated that he was stressing on building the team for future. ?I am just a coach and can?t do magic in just four weeks,? he said referring to the training camp at Chandigarh that was held for the Champions Trophy. 

Germany coach Bernhard Peters said though his side 

lost, it put up a tough fight.

 Final-round 59 gives Mickelson win 

New York: US Masters champion Phil Mickelson tapped in a birdie on the final hole to become the fifth player in history to shoot 59 as he charged to victory in the PGA Grand Slam of Golf event in Kauai, Hawaii, on Wednesday. 

The American?s 13-under-par final round gave him a five-shot winning margin over Fiji?s Vijay Singh in the 36-hole four-man $1 million event that brings together the season?s four major champions. 

?I felt like this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and I was glad when that last putt went in,? said Mickelson, who picked up $400,000 for the victory. 

?When I made the (45-foot birdie) putt on 16, I knew what was going on and I was really excited because I knew 18 was a birdie hole.? 

Overnight leader Retief Goosen of South Africa fired a four-under-par 68 to finish a shot behind world number one Singh, who matched his first-round score of 66.

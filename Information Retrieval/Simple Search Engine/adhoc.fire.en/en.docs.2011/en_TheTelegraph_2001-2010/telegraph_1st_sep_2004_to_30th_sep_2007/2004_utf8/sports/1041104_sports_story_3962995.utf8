 - Durand Cup

A CORRESPONDENT

 Sunil Chhetri scored a brace 

New Delhi: Mohun Bagan raced to victory in their opening group C match of the 117th Durand Cup football tournament on Wednesday. 

Bagan led their opponents Assam Rifles 4-0 at the breather before easing off in the second half to win 5-0. 

Striker Sunil Chhetri scored a brace, while midfielders Mehtab Hussain and Dharamjit Singh and defender Eduardo Coelho added one apiece. 

Meanwhile, in group A, defending champions Salgaocar were held to a 2-2 draw by Border Security Force (BSF). Samson Singh and Jothi Kumar scored for Salgaocar, while Santosh Sethi and substitute P.H. Boy Singh found the net for BSF. 

Salgaocar need to beat Air India in their final group game on Friday to progress to the last four. Air Indian had earlier defeated BSF 2-1. 

The big victory margin gave Bagan an edge in goal difference over their other group C rival State Bank of Travancore (SBT), who had defeated Assam Rifles 3-1. 

The 16-time champions need only a draw in their last match against SBT on Friday to reach the semi-finals. 

The green-and-maroon brigade?s new Nigerian recruit James Ugwo gave a good account of himself, functioning well in the dual role of marksman and playmaker. It is from his moves that Bagan lapped up four goals. 

They opened their campaign in the 17th minute. Mehtab crossed from the right and James squared on to Chhetri, who placed in. 

Three minutes on, James surged down the left and sent a back pass to Chhetri. The striker finding himself blocked, backheeled to Mehtab who found the net with a powerful rightfooter. 

Bagan again found the target in the 36th minute. Dharamjit Singh placed a measured free-kick on the far post and an overlapping Eduardo headed home. James was involved in the team?s fourth goal as he darted down the centre and essayed an angled pass to Chhetri, who scored from close. Dharamjit rounded off the tally in the 81st minute, scoring off a rebound. 

Coach Subrata Bhattacharya tried out new defender T. Roopesh and midfielder Manas Das in the second half. Jo Paul Ancheri, another latest recruit, was not played. 

Salgaocar were in danger when they went 1-2 down, before a 75th minute goal by Jothi Kumar gave them a crucial point against BSF. 

The Goans took the lead in the 36th minute when medio Samson Singh volleyed home from edge of the box. Their opponent restored parity at the stroke of halftime following a superb solo effort from Santosh Sethi. 

Sethi moved up from the right and lobbed the ball into the post past an advancing goalkeeper. As the ball dipped in, defender John Dias came up with a valiant clearance. The linesman was not sure whether the ball had crossed the line, but later changed his mind following protest from BSF players.Substitute P.H. Boy Singh then gave BSF the lead in the 62nd minute, going past Dias through the right.

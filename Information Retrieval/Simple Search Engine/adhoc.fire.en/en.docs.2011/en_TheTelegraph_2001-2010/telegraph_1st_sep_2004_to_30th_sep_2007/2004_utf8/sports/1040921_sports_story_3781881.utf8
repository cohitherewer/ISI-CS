The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Woolmer not taking WI lightly 

Birmingham: Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer insisted his side would not take West Indies lightly when they meet in the semi-final of the ICC Champions Trophy at The Rose Bowl on Wednesday. 

West Indies chased down 247 to beat South Africa by five wickets at The Oval on Sunday while, later in the day, Pakistan overcame arch-rivals India by three-wickets with four balls remaining in a tense encounter at Edgbaston. 

Woolmer said that the West Indies, whitewashed 4-0 during their recent Test series in England, would be hard to beat. 

?I think they?ve gone through some tough times but they are an ever-improving side. They?ve got some quality batsmen, Brian Lara obviously,? added Woolmer. 

?Ramnaresh Sarwan made runs today too. So it?s not going to be an easy game by any stretch of the imagination.? 

Pakistan booked their place in the last four, having restricted India to 200 all out, they finished on 201 for seven with four balls to spare. (AFP)

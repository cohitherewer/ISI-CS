 Harbhajan to play for Surrey

London: India off-spinner Harbhajan Singh will play for English County Surrey next year, the club confirmed in a statement on Friday. 

The 24-year-old, who has played 39 Tests and 91 one-day Internationals, replaces Pakistan off-spinner Saqlain Mushtaq, who has been plagued by knee problems. 

?This is great news for the club,? said Surrey manager Steve Rixon. ?With Saqlain struggling to recover from two serious knee injuries I felt we needed to strengthen our spin attack. 

?He?s one of the world?s best spin bowlers and he?ll relish the sort of pitches produced here at the Brit Oval.? 

Harbhajan took 21 wickets in India?s recent home Test series defeat by Australia. He made his Test debut in 1997 and has taken 172 wickets at an average of just under 28. (Reuters)

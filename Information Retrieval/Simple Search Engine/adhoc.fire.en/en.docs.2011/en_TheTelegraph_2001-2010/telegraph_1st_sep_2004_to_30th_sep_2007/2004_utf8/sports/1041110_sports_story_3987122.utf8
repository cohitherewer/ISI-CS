The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Bob Woolmer to arrive later

 - JUBILEE MATCH BUILD-UP 

- Coach in Dar-es-Salaam; Captain on religious tours; Squad lands tonight 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: Bob Woolmer, who used to make a trip here ( till the age of 11) each time his school in the UK had vacations, won?t be arriving with the Inzamam-ul Haq-captained squad on Wednesday night. 

Woolmer, in his fifth month as Pakistan?s coach, is currently in Dar-es-Salaam celebrating his 30th wedding anniversary. 

?I?m on a short holiday and, given that you?ve caught me on our anniversary, I?ll just accept your congratulations? I?m not going to talk cricket,? Woolmer told The Telegraph on Tuesday evening. 

Clearly, Woolmer is in the ?switched-off? mode. 

In any case, as Pakistan have beaten India in the last three ODIs (Colombo, Amstelveen, Birmingham), he can probably afford to take it a bit easy. 

Woolmer, by the way, informed only wife Gillian and he were at a resort. ?Our sons haven?t joined us,? he remarked. 

Asked about his travel plans for Saturday?s Platinum Jubilee ODI at the Eden, Woolmer said: ?I intend flying to Johannesburg and, then, taking a flight for Mumbai. I?ll be in Calcutta on Friday morning.? 

Woolmer?s arrival is surely going to mark the renewal of a nostalgic association with this city. 

His father (Charles), it may be recalled, held a senior position with Royal Exchange Insurance Company and was stationed here till 1959. 

Thereafter, the Senior Woolmer ? a one-time UP captain ? was transferred to Karachi. From there, he went back to England. 

The Woolmers stayed at ?4 Alipore Estate? and the former England allrounder visited his parents? residence during the 1976-77 Test. 

Woolmer?s last trip to this city was in 1996-97, when the Hansie Cronje-led South Africans battered India. He was then the Proteas? coach. 

Actually, Woolmer has been a truly International Citizen: Born in Kanpur, settled in England till 1985 and, then, shifting to breathtaking Cape Town? Now, he has links with Lahore too. 

It?s no surprise that Woolmer?s coaching isn?t one-dimensional.

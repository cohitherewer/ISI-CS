 Elistano for Derby Trial 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Both Elistano and Bollywood Dreams have in them the making of a champion. They stand cut above the rest in the eight-horse field vying for the Calcutta Derby Trial Stakes on Friday. The two runners are also expected to attract maximum support in the betting ring.

 However, it is Elistano who is fancied to win the prized event. The Metal Precieux-Pot Of Gold son has matured late and gives the impression of being more comfortable over the 2,000m trip. Although his narrow victory over Bollywood Dreams in the 1,400m Colts Stakes was a laborious effort, yet it was impressive one. He won after losing much ground at the start. Further, he is full kin of Calorescent and a half-brother to Sonalika ? both comfortable over middle distances. C. Alford partners the Vijay Singh-trainee.Read as: Sl nos, last four runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

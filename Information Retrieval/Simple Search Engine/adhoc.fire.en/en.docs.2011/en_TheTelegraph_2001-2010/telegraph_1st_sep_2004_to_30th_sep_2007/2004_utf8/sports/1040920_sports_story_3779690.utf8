The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Chelsea held goalless 

London: Chelsea were held to a 0-0 home draw by Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday and remain two points behind champions Arsenal in second place after the weekend?s Premier League action. 

A thrilling match at Stamford Bridge ended with both sides retaining their unbeaten starts to the season but with Spurs unable to end a 14-year, 29-match wait for a league victory over Chelsea. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho, upset with what he saw as ultra-defensive tactics by Spurs, said: ?As they say in my country, they brought the bus and they left the bus in front of the goal because everybody was there. 

?They didn?t play football, they just defend, defend, defend,? the Portuguese coach said. Tottenham climbed to fifth place on 10 points, six behind Arsenal and two short of Chelsea, who have been held goalless in their last two league games. Everton beat Middlesbrough 1-0 at home on Sunday to climb to third on 13. 

Bolton Wanderers, who held Arsenal 2-2 at Highbury on Saturday, are fourth on 11 points and Middlesbrough sixth on 10. Arsenal dropped their first points but extended their record unbeaten league run to 46 matches. 

Newcastle United marked their first Premier League match under Graeme Souness with a 2-1 win at Southampton, their first away league victory in 17 attempts going back 11 months, and climbed to eighth on eight points. (Reuters)

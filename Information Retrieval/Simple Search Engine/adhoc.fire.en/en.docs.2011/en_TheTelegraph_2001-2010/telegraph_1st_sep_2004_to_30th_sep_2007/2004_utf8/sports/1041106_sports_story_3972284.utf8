London: Boudewijn Zenden scored twice as European rookies Middlesbrough beat Lazio 2-0 in the group stage of the Uefa Cup. 

Zenden scored in the 16th minute with a 20-yard left-footed volley, then twisted to head past Lazio goalkeeper Fabrizio Casazza in the 71st. 

The Dutchman also scored the winner in Boro?s 2-1 win over Charlton on Saturday. 

Managed by Steve McClaren, who is deputy to Sven-Goran Eriksson in the England coaching set-up, Boro are fifth in the Premier League ? ahead of Manchester United. 

Boro are the only group E team with a 100 per cent record. Partizan Belgrade won their first game on Thursday, a 4-0 win over Egaleo of Greece off a hattrick from Sasa Ilic. Partizan have three points, Lazio and Villarreal one and Egaleo none. 

Other clubs to win on Thursday included Schalke, Besiktas, Parma, Newcastle, VFB Stuttgart, Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk, Austria Vienna, AZ Alkmaar, Grazer AK, Dinamo Zagreb and Lille. 

German club Stuttgart shook off three consecutive defeats in the Bundesliga with a 3-0 victory over Benfica. 

Stuttgart, who had crushed Beveren 5-1 in the opening match in group G two weeks ago, took the lead with a deflected shot from Cacau on the half hour and further goals from Silvio Meissner and Germany striker Kevin Kuranyi sealed the points. 

Dinamo Zagreb are second in the group after opening their group account with a 6-1 victory over Belgians Beveren with Dario Zahora twice on target. Newcastle United made it a good night for English clubs with a 2-0 victory over Dinamo Tbilisi in group D, Alan Shearer and Craig Bellamy scoring the goals either side of halftime. Former England striker Shearer?s 38th-minute strike was his 22nd goal in Europe. 

Elsewhere in Europe?s secondary club competition, twice former champions Parma enjoyed a 1-0 group B victory against a Steaua Bucharest side coached by former Italy and Inter Milan goalkeeper Walter Zenga. 

Norway?s John Carew was on target for Turkish side Besiktas as they beat Athletic Bilbao 3-1 to top group B on goal difference. 

In group A, Dutch club Feyenoord earned a point against Ferencvaros with Ivory Coast forward Salomon Kalou cancelling out a strike by Daniel Tozser. 

Ukrainian side Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk maintained their 100 percent start to the group stage with a 2-1 victory away at Dutch side Utrecht in group C. Sevilla made a winning start in group H with a 2-0 victory against Aachen to give them three points alongside Lille who bounced back from an opening game defeat by Aachen to beat Russians Zenit St Petersburg 2-1. 

In group F, three goals from Austria international Roland Kollmann helped Grazer AK beat Polish side Amica Wronki 3-1. Dutch side AZ Alkmaar beat Auxerre 2-0 off two first-half goals from Stein Huysegems. 

In group H, Matt Moussilou grabbed the winner as Lille 

beat Zenit St Petersburg 2-1. Gregory Tafforeau put Lille ahead in the 35th minute, 

only for Alexander Kerzhakov to level in the 39th. Moussilou pounced in the 42nd 

to give Lille their first win. (Agencies)

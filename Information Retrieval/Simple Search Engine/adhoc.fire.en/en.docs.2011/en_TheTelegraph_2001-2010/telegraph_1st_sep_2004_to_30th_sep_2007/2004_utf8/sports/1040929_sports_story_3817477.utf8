The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Bhupathi, Paes advance

 A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Mahesh Bhupathi and Leander Paes recorded a facile win in their Thailand Open first-round match in Bangkok on Tuesday. The top seeds beat Attila Savolt (Hungary) and Jiri Vanek (Czech Republic) 6-2, 6-1. The Indians, who have 23 ATP titles together, no longer team up on a regular basis. This week, they came together as their regular partners (David Rikl and Max Mirnyi) chose not to play.

 Tricky task for Parma, Udinese

 Alberto Gilardino seems to be returning to form 

London: Italy will have just one representative in the inaugural group stage of the Uefa Cup unless former winners Parma or Udinese can negotiate tricky first round, second legs on Thursday. 

Lazio?s passage through to the 40-team group stage of the competition seems a formality after a 3-0 first leg win over Ukraine?s Metalurg Donetsk. 

But Parma, winners of the Uefa Cup in 1995 and 1999, only edged out Maribor 3-2 in the first leg, and the return in Slovenia could be just as tight if their Serie A form is anything to go by. 

Parma lie bottom of the division, with two points from four matches, although a first goal of the season by striker Alberto Gilardino in the weekend?s 2-2 draw with Inter Milan indicated he could be returning to the shape that made him Serie A?s leading Italian striker last season. 

Udinese, meanwhile, risk crashing out of the competition after being outclassed by Panionios in the first leg in Greece. 

For the return, the Greeks start without suspended striker Alexandros Tziolis but Udinese will have to be at their best to overturn the 3-1 deficit. 

Another club in deep trouble are former European champions Red Star Belgrade, Uefa Cup runners up in 1979. 

The Serbian champions lost their coach Ljupko Petrovic after their 0-4 first leg hammering at Zenit St Petersburg, although his replacement Ratko Dostanic remains optimistic. 

The only other Eastern European side to win the European Cup, Romania?s Steaua Bucharest, also face a tight second leg after their 1-2 home defeat of CSKA Sofia two weeks ago. 

But the other former European champions in the draw, Benfica and Feyenoord, as well as 1997 Uefa Cup winners Schalke 04 should progress to the group stage with ease. 

The tie between Maccabi Petah Tikva and Heerenveen will be decided in a single match in the Netherlands, with no advantage for away goals, after the first leg was cancelled because of a general strike in Israel. 

Petah?s rival Israeli club Bnei Sakhnin must overcome a two-goal deficit when they host Newcastle United if they are to extend the first campaign by an Arab team in European competition. 

Newcastle coach Graeme Souness, who took charge of last season?s beaten semi-finalists for the first time in the ill-tempered first leg, is expecting a tough match in Israel. 

Souness will be without Nicky Butt as the England midfielder was sent off with Sakhnin?s Abas Suan after a wrestling match in the first game. 

The winners of the first round ties will be split into eight groups of five teams with three from each group advancing to a second knockout stage. 

There, they will be joined by eight sides finishing third in their Champions League groups. The final is in Lisbon on May 18.

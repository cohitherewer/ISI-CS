 China win title, bronze for India 

Hyderabad: China defeated Korea 3-2 by an extra-time golden goal to annex the Asian Women Junior (U-21) title while India trounced Japan 2-0 to take the bronze medal on Thursday. 

Li Li Wen scored the winner via the penalty stroke earned in the extra-time after the two teams were locked at 2-2 after the regulation period. 

China in fact, twice clawed back into the game as the defending champions took the lead through Kim Jong Eun and Park Mih Yun in the 14th and 37th minutes. 

Cheng Jia Yan (36th) and Li Hung Xia (47th) kept China in the hunt by restoring parity. The Koreans then messed up two golden chances at the goal-mouth in the extra-time before Li sealed the fate of the match. 

Earlier, India put behind the disappointing show in the league stage to beat Japan in the third place play-off. 

The hosts, who had gone down to the same opponent 2-3 in the league phase, scored on either side of the half time to avenge the defeat. 

Soy Fulmani put India ahead in the third minute and Deepika increased the lead to 2-0 in the closing minutes of the play. (PTI)

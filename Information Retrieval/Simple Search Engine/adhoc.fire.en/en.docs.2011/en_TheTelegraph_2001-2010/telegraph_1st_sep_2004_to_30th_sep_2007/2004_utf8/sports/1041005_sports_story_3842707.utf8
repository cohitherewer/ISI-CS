The Telegraph - Calcutta

 An Aussie security hattrick

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

Bangalore: It?s a hattrick for Reg Dickason. If you?re wondering who he is, well, the gentleman is the Australian team?s security co-ordinator. 

A former Victorian policeman, Dickason first came with Steve Waugh?s side in 2000-01 and, then, visited India last season when Ricky Ponting and Co. had that tri-series date. 

The security co-ordinator, though, doesn?t travel the world with the Australians ? for example, he wasn?t in England during the recent Champions Trophy. 

?Actually, Dickason is largely required on tours where the population is large and the presence of fans heavy,? a source explained in a chat with The Telegraph on Monday.

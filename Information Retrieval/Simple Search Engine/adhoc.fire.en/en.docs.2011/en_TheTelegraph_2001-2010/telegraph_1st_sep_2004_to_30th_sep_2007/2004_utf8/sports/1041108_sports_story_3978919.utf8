The Telegraph - Calcutta

Stage set for Wright-Phillips

Guest column

 Wright-Phillips has all ingredients to make 

a successful player 

After watching Manchester City?s game against Norwich 

last Monday I sent Ian Wright a text, saying: ?Your boy?s a proper player?. Whether 

or not the England captain David Beckham is fit to play in the friendly against 

Spain on November 17, I think the time is right to give Shaun Wright-Phillips 

his first start. 

Sven-Goran Eriksson knows all about the qualities 

of Beckham and since this game is not the lead-up to an important competitive 

fixture, I think it is perfect opportunity to find out more about Wrighty?s step-son 

and see whether he has what it takes to be an international footballer. 

I think he has. It takes a while to find that out, 

but he has already scored on his debut, against Ukraine. One can never be certain 

whether a player will make the step-up because international football is as much 

about mental strength as it is technical ability, skill or speed. But the very 

fact that Wright-Phillips has managed to forge a career for himself at the highest 

level of the game in England, while being the step-son of a famous footballing 

father, suggests that he has the necessary bottle. 

It is not easy growing up in the shadow of a famous 

father, particularly a larger-than-life one like Ian Wright. Comparisons are inevitable 

and sons invariably suffer by them. For example, one could only sympathise with 

Jordi Cruyff, the former Barcelona and Manchester United player. 

All right there?s the genes, but only 50 per cent 

of them. I?ve got four sons but that doesn?t say they are going to be good footballers. 

I mean, my wife Michelle is completely useless at football. 

Of course, there have been some successful offspring, 

a few who have been as, if not even more, successful than their fathers ? Paolo 

Maldini, the son of Cesare, springs immediately to mind. While here in England 

Frank Lampard and Jamie Redknapp have each followed with great success in the 

footsteps of more than useful fathers ? Frank senior and the incomparable Harry, 

respectively. 

But for the most part it?s difficult for sons. Generally 

speaking, footballers and their families nowadays lead comfortable lifestyles. 

It?s quite hard for sons to be sufficiently driven to succeed at football and, 

unless they are determined from the very start, they are not going to make it 

in what is an unbelievably competitive sport. It takes a special kind of young 

man to have that drive and I believe Shaun Wright-Phillips is just such a young 

man. 

Wrighty is hugely proud of the 23-year-old, I know, 

but prefers not to talk about him too much. Knowing Wrighty, he must have had 

a big input in his career, but he?s never discussed it with me. Young Wright appears 

to have all the ingredients to make a successful player. He?s lively, he wants 

the ball, can beat people, can see a pass and he works his socks off as well. 

He can also play in different positions ? I?ve seen him play impressively at full-back 

? which is also very useful for an international wannabe, not to mention his manager. 

He is a different kind of player to Beckham and it?s 

great to have someone like him to fall back on when the Real Madrid player is 

injured or off form. It seems the old guard are finally getting some back-up, 

what with the emergence of players like Jermain Defoe as cover for Michael Owen.

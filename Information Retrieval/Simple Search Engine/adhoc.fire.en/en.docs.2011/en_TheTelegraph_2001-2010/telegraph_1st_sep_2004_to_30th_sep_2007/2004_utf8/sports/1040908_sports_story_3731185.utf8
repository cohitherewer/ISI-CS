 London: Former England captain Terry Butcher has hit out at David Beckham, claiming his performances during the last three years hardly merit his being in the team. Butcher, writing in his column on BBC Sport Online, said Beckhams fame had helped him stay in the side when his performances dipped.

 There has been criticism of Beckham and I think he is now the closest he has ever been to playing himself out of the team, Butcher wrote. If it wasnt Beckham wearing that number seven shirt and playing like that, a lot of people would be saying what a wretched match he had and should be dropped.

 Brasilia: Real Madrid striker Ronaldo and his girlfriend, model Daniella Cicarelli, plan to marry in January at a ceremony in Paris, local media reported. Cicarelli, 24, who is a hostess on Brazilian MTV told the Globo TV network that the couple planned to wed on January 2.

 I suggested Paris, because it is a romantic, marvellous city, Ronaldo told Globo. The couple has been dating for about three months and the soccer celebrity has been dedicating all his goals to Cicarelli.

 New Delhi: The Indian colts played below par but managed to hold their nerves to scrape past Australia in their quarter final league opener of the 12th Asian junior mens volleyball championship in Doha.

 The second-seeded Indians looked rusty but ensured that their bid to grab the title, which they lost by a whisker in 2002, was not derailed in the opening match itself. According to information received here on Tuesday, the Indians needed an hour and 43 minutes to overcome their opponents 25-16, 18-25, 31-29, 18-25, 15-6 on Monday night.

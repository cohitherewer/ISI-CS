 Patil ready to face ACU 

Mumbai: India A coach and former Test star Sandeep Patil said on Tuesday he was willing to talk to anyone from the International Cricket Council (ICC) which is probing the match-fixing scandal allegedly involving 12 Kenyan players. 

?They are welcome to come and talk to me,? the former Kenya national coach, who guided the Africans to a surprise semi-final place in the 2003 World Cup said. 

?In fact no one had said anything to me on this count when I visited Kenya as the coach of the India A team last year. I am yet to hear (on the issue) from the ICC or anyone else,? the former dashing middle order batsman said. 

News reports from Nairobi on Monday said investigators from the ICC?s Anti-Corruption and Security Unit will soon interview 12 players implicated in the match-fixing scandal involving former team captain Maurice Odumbe.

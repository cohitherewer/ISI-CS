 7-batsman strategy not working for India: Patil 

 Sandeep Patil feels Kumble should have been fielded 

Mumbai: Former Test star and coach of Indian junior cricket team, Sandeep Patil felt India should do away with the strategy of playing seven batsmen in one-day Internationals following India?s defeat to Pakistan by three wickets in the ICC Champions Trophy on Sunday. 

?If six batsmen cannot put up a defendable score, what guarantee is there that the seventh batsman can do it. Moreover, five specialist bowlers are required when you are playing against Pakistan,? Patil said on Monday. 

?Not playing Anil Kumble was like having a Mercedes Benz in the garage and not using it at all,? observed Patil. 

?Being the coach of the junior team I know that wicketkeeper Dinesh Karthik is an exceptional batsman, but unfortunately he did not find a place in the crucial match,? he added. 

?Sunday?s debacle was because our batting failed to click, and despite a lion-hearted bowling by young Irfan Pathan in early stages of Pakistan innings, other bowlers failed to give him good support to swing the match in India?s favour,? he added. 

?May be India need a couple of more Irfan Pathans to win matches in future,? Patil added. Patil also felt that Rohan Gavaskar was not an ideal seven down batsman as he was more a grafter than a big hitter, which was the need of the hour for any number seven batsman. 

Another former Test star and former selection committee chairman, Chandu Borde said, ?I think the Indian team were short of match practice and Tendulkar?s absence was surely felt in the Indian camp. 

?The way the Indians took to the field after skipper Sourav Ganguly lost the toss was very strange. They looked as if they were under unnecessary pressure just because their opponents happened to be Pakistan,? he added. 

?Somehow the Indian batsmen looked out of focus and I think it is time some one starts doing Tendulkar?s job of holding the innings together because every member of the team should take up the responsibilities when representing the country,? Borde said. 

However, despite Sunday?s defeat, Indian cricketers have been advised not to panic prior to facing the Australians in the home series. 

?We tend to panic after every match, every series. We?ve performed well in the last two years. So there is no need to really get disturbed by these defeats,? national selector Kirti Azad said.

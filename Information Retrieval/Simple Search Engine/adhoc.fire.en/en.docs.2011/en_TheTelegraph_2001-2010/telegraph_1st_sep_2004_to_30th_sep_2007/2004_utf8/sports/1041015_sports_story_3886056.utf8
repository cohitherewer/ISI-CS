 Racism to top agenda

London: A review of the structure of the game and inquiry into racism allegations in Zimbabwean cricket top the agenda of the International Cricket Council?s (ICC?s) executive board meeting to be held in Lahore on Saturday-Sunday. 

The meeting will be the first opportunity for the ICC board to consider the future structure of the programme of Test matches and one-day International cricket following discussions by the chief executives of all countries at their meeting in September. 

?The ICC board will consider a range of alternatives identified by the chief executives committee and provide direction to ICC management as to which, if any, it wishes to be examined further,? a press release said on Thursday. 

The board will also consider the report of India?s solicitor general Goolam Vahanvati and South African high court judge Steven Majiedt into the allegations of racism in Zimbabwe cricket. 

Other matters on the agenda include a recommended amendment to the ICC Code of Conduct to include team selectors in the definition of team officials and further discussions on the future location of the ICC. 

The ICC executive board is made up of presidents and chairmen of the ICC?s 10 full member countries plus three representatives from associate member countries. It is the key policy making body for international cricket. (PTI)

 Alok bows out

New Delhi: Asian snooker champion Alok Kumar?s dream of making it big at the world level came crashing down after Pakistan?s Saleh Mohammed beat him 5-0 in the knock-out stage of the world snooker championships in Veldhoven, The Netherlands on Wednesday. 

Saleh Mohammed, seeded fifth, won five sets in a row in the best of nine game to send the Indian packing in the morning session, according to information received here. 

Alok surrendered rather meekly against his higher ranked opponent 37-64, 33-57, 22-69, 5-73, 59-74. India?s hopes now rest on defending champion and sixth seed Pankaj Advani and Manan Chandra in the men?s section.

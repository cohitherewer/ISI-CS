 Services eye revenge vs Kerala

A CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Services will be eyeing revenge when they take on Kerala in the first semi-final of the 59th Santosh Trophy to be played at the Ambedkar Stadium on Thursday. 

Two years back, Kerala beat Services 3-2 to enter the final of the 58th edition of the meet in Imphal. 

The semi-final should be played at a brisk tempo as both teams rely on speed and one touch passing in their build-ups. Services? fitness is superior but Kerala have more guile in attack and midfield. The fate of the match will depend much on how Services? hard tackling back four cope with the speed and flair of Kerala?s attack, in which SBT?s S. Ignatius and Abdul Hakeem are in good form. 

The Services? coach Stanley Rozario feels the key players for Kerala are 23-year-old midfielder Abdul Naushad (State Bank of Travancore), with his snappy long range shots and nippy 24-year-old striker, Abdul Hakeem. Naushad, is the top scorer, with three goals out of his team?s tally of six.

 229 not an easy target: Martyn

 INDRANIL MAJUMDAR 

Chennai: Damien Martyn termed his 104 as ?one of the best knocks? in his career and is disappointed to have got out at a crucial time and not build on his innings further. 

?This is one of the best knocks considering that I batted on the fourth day on a turning Indian wicket in extreme hot and humid conditions and against two best spinners in the world. I?ve played a lot of one-day cricket in similar conditions here and that helped me a lot today,? said Martyn. 

He feels the target of 229 will be tough for India in the circumstances. ?There?s a lot of footmarks and it?s quite natural on a fifth day wicket. If we were to chase this target and on this track, it would not have been easy,? Martyn said. 

He said the target was a ?fighting? one. ?We batted a lot better than we did in the first innings. It was a great fightback. The plan this morning was to bat as long as possible and Gilly?s (Jason Gillespie) performance was obviously a bonus. It was really disappointing to lose two quick wickets when both Gilly and myself were well set,? he said. 

Martyn said that fielding will hold the key to their chances on the final day. ?We had put down quite a few chances in the first innings. Hopefully, we?ll have luck on our side tomorrow.? 

Hayden ?hearing? 

Match Referee Ranjan Madugalle summoned Matthew Hayden for a ?hearing? at the end of the day?s play. Madugalle, however, declined to divulge details.

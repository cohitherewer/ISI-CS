The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Three share early lead

Sydney: Skandia, Konica Minolta and Nicorette shared early lead in the 60th Sydney-Hobart yacht race on Sunday with a fleet of 114 boats preparing for bad weather as they approached Bass Strait. 

The $3.8 million Nicorette, untried since its launch two weeks ago, snatched the initial lead but was soon overtaken by the bigger Skandia and Konica Minolta as they surfed out into the Tasman Sea in the annual 630 nautical mile race. 

Super maxis Skandia and New Zealand?s Konica Minolta, then known as Zana, staged an enthralling battle in last year?s race, sailing within sight of each other for more than two days before Australia?s Skandia triumphed by just 14 minutes. 

This year?s race began in similar fashion as the trans-Tasman rivals enjoyed trailing north-easterly winds, with property developer Grant Wharington?s Skandia ahead by about three miles and travelling at up to 21 knots, seven hours after the start. 

The leaders were striving to cover as much distance as possible before two predicted south-westerly changes slam into the fleet somewhere near Bass Strait between the Australian mainland and the southern island state of Tasmania on Monday. 

On Friday, meteorologists warned of gale-force winds averaging between 40 and 50 knots and with gusts of up to 60 knots as well as huge seas averaging between six and nine metres when the change hits. 

While difficult, conditions were not expected to be as bad as those during the 1998 race, when six sailors died and five boats sank. (Reuters)

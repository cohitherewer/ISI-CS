 Gajender suspended 

 STAR RACER

 Reuben

Calcutta: Fancied runners once again failed on Wednesday, leaving the field open for outsiders to rule. The biggest blow was delivered in the day?s opener, the Own Ability Cup, which saw a friendless Star Above marching to victory while the hot-favourite Ballet Master surrendered his chances at the start itself.

 The favourite, an Errol Bhungard-trainee, lost about six lengths at the gates and hardly received any assistance in the saddle from apprentice Gajender Singh for rest of the journey. He was, however, handed a four-day suspension following a stewards? enquiry.

 Way To The Stars followed the day?s trend in the feature event, the 1,200m Moon Fairy Cup. Known to be an unreliable galloper, the 10-1 shot from J. Stephens? yard displayed amazing acceleration in the final stretch to post an easy win in the hands of Mark Reuben who had also guided Arian to victory in the Contralto Handicap.

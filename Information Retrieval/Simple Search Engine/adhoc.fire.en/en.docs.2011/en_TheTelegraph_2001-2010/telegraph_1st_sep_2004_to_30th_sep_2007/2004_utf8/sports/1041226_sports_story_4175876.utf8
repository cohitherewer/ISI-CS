The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Bangladesh tread a cautious path

Dhaka: The 11-run loss Bangladesh suffered in the first ODI in Chittagong was close enough to get the home team pepped up for the second and third in the series, Sunday and Monday. Not that coach Dav Whatmore is in any doubt about the potential of his wards, having conceded that India remain a ?vastly superior side.? 

While India are playing their cards confidently, naming many changes in the squad, Bangladesh?s case seems to be more complicated. They are expected to include paceman Mashrafee Murtaza in place of Mushfiqur Rahman but skipper Habibul Bashar is still not clear on his batting line-up. 

Bashar said Javed Omar, who was not in the team for the first tie, might play but not open the innings. Rajin Saleh, who failed to produced runs in Chittagong after being dropped from the second Test, might face the axe. 

?We have been making progress step by step in every match. Winning or losing is not on our minds, we are trying to improve,? said Bashar who would be playing in his 100th one-dayer. 

He said the team needed more than one player to deliver. ?So far in the Tests and one-dayer, it has been one player producing the runs. We need two or three batsmen to do well. The idea is to keep wickets in hand and attack in the later stages.? 

Although the hosts did not really put the Indians to the sword in the first match, they realise that they are capable of a fightback in this shorter version of the game. 

Bangladesh (from): Habibul Bashar (captain), Khaled Mashud, Rajin Saleh, Khaled Mahmud, Mohammed Rafique, Mohammed Ashraful, Mushfiqur Rahman, Tapash Baisya, Mashrafee Murtaza, Nafis Iqbal, Manjural Islam, Aftab Ahmed and Nazmul Hossain.

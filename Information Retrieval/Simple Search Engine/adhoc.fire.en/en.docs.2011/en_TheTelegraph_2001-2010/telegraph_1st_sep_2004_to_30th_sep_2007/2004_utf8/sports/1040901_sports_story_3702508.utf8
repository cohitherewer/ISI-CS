New York: Defending champion Justine Henin-Hardenne was given a scare by 15-year-old Czech Nicole Vaidisova before claiming her place in the US Open second round on Tuesday. 

The top-seeded Belgian breezed through the first set but trailed 1-4 in the second before coming back with five straight games to seal a 6-1, 6-4 victory. 

Against an opponent making her main draw debut at a Grand Slam event, Olympic champion Henin-Hardenne cruised through the first set in just 17 minutes. 

But the 15-year-old, who won her first Tour title in Vancouver this month in only her third WTA event, showed courage to break the Belgian twice as Henin-Hardenne struggled in the windy conditions. 

Just when it looked like she might be forced into a deciding set, however, the Belgians experience proved crucial and a series of unforced errors from Vaidisova gave the top seed victory. 

Olympic champion Nicolas Massu, meanwhile, continued his golden run with a 6-4, 6-0, 6-2 victory over Argentine Jose Acasuso. 

The 10th-seeded Chilean, who won both singles and doubles in Athens, looked high on confidence as he outplayed the world No. 79 in just under two hours. 

Acasuso had not won a match in three previous visits to the US Open, and once Massu had taken the first set, the writing was on the wall. 

The Chilean won 11 of the next 12 games as he romped through the second and third sets to cruise into the second round. 

In other mens matches, South Koreas Lee Hyung-taik beat seed Ivan Ljubicic of Croatia after the 24th seed retired 3-6, 6-3, 1-1. 

Fifteenth seed Paradorn Srichaphan of Thailand overcame beat Victor Hanescu of Romania 4-6, 6-4, 6-1, 6-1, while 22nd seed Dominik Hrbaty of Slovakia swept past Spains Oscar Hernandez 6-1, 6-2, 6-1. 

On Monday, Andre Agassi returned to his favourite hunting ground to serve up a traditional late-night feast. 

After mens top seed Roger Federer and womens third seed Serena Williams had posted impressive first round victories on a muggy day at Flushing Meadow, it was the 34-year-old Agassi who stole the show with a 7-6, 6-4, 6-2 victory over fellow American Robby Ginepri. 

It was the sixth time in seven years that the eight-times Grand Slam champion had topped the bill on the opening night session, and he did not disappoint despite a few anxious moments. 

After edging the first-set tiebreak, Agassi, who is bidding for a third US Open title, showed that age has not blunted his ground-strokes as he took his record for night matches at the US Open to 24-3. 

Top seed Federers 7-5, 6-2, 6-4 victory over Spains Albert Costa was routine for the Swiss who is bidding to become the first player since Swedens Mats Wilander in 1988 to win three Grand Slam titles in the same year. 

After second seed Amelie Mauresmo and Jennifer Capriati both eased into the second round of the womens singles, two-times champion Serena showed off her Open credentials with a quickfire 6-1, 6-3 victory over Sandra Kleinova. 

Taking to the court in knee-length boots, denim skirt and diamond-studded crop top, the twice former champion showed flashes of her dazzling best during a routine 53-minute victory. 

Williams was told beforehand by the USTA that she would only be allowed to wear her boots during the warm-up, but after reverting to more traditional tennis shoes she trampled all over the world number 84. 

Earlier, Mauresmo, still looking for her first Slam, enjoyed a comfortable 6-4, 6-2 victory against American Marissa Irvin while eighth seed Capriati recovered from a poor start to beat Czech Denisa Chladkova 2-6, 6-1, 6-2. 

Mens third seed Carlos Moya had to dig deep against 19-year-old American wildcard Brian Baker, losing the first set before coming through 6-7, 6-4, 6-4, 6-2.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 King under no pressure

Bridgetown: Bennett King, the West Indies? first foreign cricket coach, feels no pressure in his new job despite the high expectations of Caribbean fans. 

?I fully understand I will have no honeymoon period,? the Australian told the Caribbean Broadcasting Corporation in an interview. 

?I don?t feel pressured. The things I know about myself is that I?m well planned, I?m always well prepared, I work very hard and I have good methodology for teaching cricket. 

?If you start listening to the fans too long, sooner or later you are going to be sitting with them.? 

King began his three-year contract two weeks ago, and walked into an unresolved contract dispute between the players and West Indies Cricket Board. (AP)

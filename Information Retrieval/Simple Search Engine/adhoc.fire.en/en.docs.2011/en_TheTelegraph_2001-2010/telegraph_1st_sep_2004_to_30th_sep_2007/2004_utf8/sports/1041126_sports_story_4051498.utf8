The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Pathan likely for Murali Kartik 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

Calcutta: It?s more or less confirmed that there will be one change in the Team India XI for the second Test against South Africa. 

According to The Telegraph?s sources, the thinktank is set to revert to the more conventional 2-2 attack. And, so, Irfan Pathan is expected to replace Murali Kartik. 

The Test, of course, begins on Sunday.

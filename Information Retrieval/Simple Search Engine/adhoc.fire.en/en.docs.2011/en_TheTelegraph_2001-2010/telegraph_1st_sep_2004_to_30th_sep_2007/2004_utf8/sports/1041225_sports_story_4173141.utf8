Calcutta: The Bengal team management believes all is still not lost in the Elite group A Ranji Trophy tie against Delhi. Despite surrendering the first-innings lead, Bengal came back strongly through positive batting from Laxmi Ratan Shukla and Rohan Gavaskar to be 179 runs ahead on the penultimate day. 

Another 100-odd runs in the first session on Saturday will help Bengal throw up a challenge at Delhi. Ajay Jadeja remained positive, saying they will ?try for an outright victory if the chances are realistic.? So, a lively final day?s play is very much on the cards. 

?The outcome will depend more on Rohan? the timing of his declaration,? said the Delhi captain. 

Bengal owe a lot to medium-pacers Ranandeb Bose and Shib Shankar Paul for restricting Delhi?s first-innings lead to 11 runs through some enterprising seam bowling in the morning. They sent down 27.1 unchanged overs as Delhi failed to negotiate the seam and swing movement. That Delhi managed to take the lead was mainly due to Rajat Bhatia?s 39. 

Ranadeb and Shib Shankar grabbed five wickets each, and more importantly, helped Bengal wrest the psychological edge. 

Ranadeb (five for 53) has had a dream run this season, picking his fourth five-wicket haul ? the previous three being against Railways and in both innings versus Gujarat. This is Bengal?s fifth encounter and he has a tally of 32 wickets till date. His probing line and ability to generate bounce caused batsmen all sorts of discomfort. 

Shib Shankar (five for 89) was equally impressive. He trapped Ajay Jadeja plumb in front with one that came back. The ?stint? with the Indian team in Dhaka has done his confidence a world of good and it is showing in his performance. 

?Both the bowlers put in a lot of hard work. Their endeavour is commendable,? complimented Jadeja. ?Bengal put in a good effort. We were lucky to get the lead. The way Bengal have come back fighting is superb,? he added. 

For the third day running, play had to be called off early. Shukla and Rohan were offered the light by the umpires as early as 3.40 pm but they continued till 4.18, when the umpires thought it would be ?unfair to the game? to continue any further. While the batsmen were hell bent on continuing, the fielders had ?appealed? against bad light! 

?They (Bengal) batted remarkably well in this light and have put themselves in a strong position. We didn?t continue in similar circumstances on Thursday and that was a mistake,? Jadeja admitted. 

Time-wasting tactics were also resorted to by the Delhi fielders during the Shukla-Rohan 43-run partnership which came off just 23 balls. The Delhi team may have to pay the penalty for this. 

Shukla?s unbeaten 44 came off 51 balls with five boundaries, while Rohan?s 34 took only 14 balls and included six boundaries and a six. The Bengal captain, however, profited when Jadeja dropped a tough caught-and-bowled chance. 

Till Shukla and Rohan got together, the Bengal innings struggled to get the necessary momentum. Deep Dasgupta was lucky to get to his half-century, having been let off early in his innings. Rakesh Krishnan?s cameo didn?t last long but the youngster impressed with his shot selection. 

The start was slow and boring. Runs almost kept pace with the numbers of overs bowled. The openers invited undue pressure with Arindam Das becoming a victim of extra cautiousness. 

The first sessions have seen a number of wickets tumble and Bengal have to survive those two and a half hours on Saturday if they hope to harbour any winning hopes.

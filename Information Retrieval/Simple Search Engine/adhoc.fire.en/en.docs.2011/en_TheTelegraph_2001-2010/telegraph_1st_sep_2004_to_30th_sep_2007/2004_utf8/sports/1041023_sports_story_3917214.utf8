 I will not walk, says Kaif

New Delhi: The Aussies caused a stir with their new trend of ?walking? and a couple of Indians may have followed suit, but Mohammed Kaif remains unimpressed. 

Kaif, who celebrated his Test recall with a maiden half-century during the second Test in Chennai, says he would stay put at the crease until the umpire asked him to go. 

?I will not walk. The umpire has a job to do, I will wait for his decision,? he said. 

Kaif also said there was no understanding between the two teams to relieve the umpires of their pressure. 

?There has been no team talk or plan as such. It is an individual?s decision,? he said at a function to launch the first-ever souvenir of the veterans? cricketers association Thursday night. (PTI)

Brisbane: Australia demolished New Zealand bowlers on Saturday to open up a 211-run lead with two days remaining in the first Test. 

Michael Clarke and Adam Gilchrist blasted centuries in a record sixth-wicket stand, while fast bowler Glenn McGrath joined in the run spree, registering a career-first fifty in his 102nd Test. 

At stumps, Australia were at 564 for nine with McGrath unbeaten on 54 and Jason Gillespie on 43. The two tailenders had shared an unbroken last-wicket stand of 93 to break New Zealand?s spirits. 

?We were pretty happy with the way things were going until that last session,? said Black Caps? left-arm spinner Daniel Vettori. 

?It was pretty tough to watch that partnership develop and there was a lot of frustration out there but we realise we need to get that wicket pretty quickly on Sunday and put a score on the card that?s going to be competitive.? 

Vettori and paceman Chris Martin were the pick of the New Zealand bowlers, capturing four wickets apiece, but were unable to stem the run flow as the Australians piled on 367 runs in the day after resuming on 197 for four. 

Clarke top-scored with 141 on his home debut while Gilchrist smashed 126 to rack up his 12th Test ton to turn the match Australia?s way, after New Zealand had dominated the previous day. 

The pair added 216 for the sixth wicket after Damien Martyn departed before lunch for 70, caught by Craig McMillan at third man off a short ball from Martin. 

Clarke, playing his fifth Test but first on home soil, was batting on 31 overnight but raced to his century off 148 balls in 206 minutes when he hooked Martin to the boundary from the last ball before lunch. 

The 23-year-old batsman also recorded a ton on his debut in India last month and joined Harry Graham and Kepler Wessels as the only Australians to score hundreds in their first Tests at home and away. 

?I?ve had a little bit of luck and I?ve been playing pretty well so I hope that continues,? Clarke said. ?I understand there are going to be times when I get a duck, and I accept that, but I just want to make the most of the good times.? 

Gilchrist was in a typically aggressive mood, reaching his century in less than three hours off 130 deliveries as he and Clarke blasted the New Zealand bowlers to every part of the Gabba. 

Clarke plundered 21 fours and a six while Gilchrist struck 13 fours and four sixes, including one into the stands which took almost five minutes to find. 

Their partnership ended with the total on 438 when

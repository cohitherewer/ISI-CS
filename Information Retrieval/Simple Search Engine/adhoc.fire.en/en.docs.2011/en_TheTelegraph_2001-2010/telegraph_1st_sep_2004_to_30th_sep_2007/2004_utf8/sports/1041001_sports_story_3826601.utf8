The Telegraph - Calcutta

India determined to draw level

 Rach is happy that his team is shaping up well 

Lahore: India go into the decider of the four-Test hockey series against arch-rivals Pakistan here Friday, determined to restore parity and leave for the return leg at home with heads high. 

It has been a roller-coaster series with favourites Pakistan taking a lead before being stunned by a largely inexperienced Indian side in the second match in Quetta. 

The Indians did well to fight back after being down by two goals in the third tie in Peshawar Wednesday before the irrepressible Sohail Abbas slammed home the match-winner to fetch a narrow 3-2 victory for the home team. 

The two teams are to play a return four-Test series in India starting October 4 in New Delhi. 

It is vital that India continue their spirited display, for, a reverse in this series here would certainly have a bearing on the team?s performance before the home crowd. 

Although Pakistan enjoy a 2-1 lead in the series, they would hardly be breathing easy as the Indians have performed better than expected even with a side missing stalwarts like Dhanraj Pillay and Baljit Singh Dhillon. 

Pakistan coach Roelant Oltmans admitted as much when he said his team would have to be wary of Indians. ?I am pleased that the boys played all the way to get a good result, but we needed to have more possession,? he said referring to Wednesday?s match. 

Praising the Indians for their fine performance, Oltmans said: ?If this team continues to play like this, I am sure they are going to be back in the 2006 World Cup.? 

Although India have not been outstanding, their performance has not been disheartening either. Young penalty corner expert Sandeep Singh exorcised the ghosts of Athens with some fine performances in the earlier matches although he disappointed in the Peshawar match. In fact, exploiting short corners continue to be the weak link for India. They earned four corners in all in Wednesday?s game but could not convert any. 

Also, the forward line needs to put up a better show Friday. The forwards have been struggling, but that could be put down to their inexperience and the responsibility of filling in the shoes of the likes of Gagan Ajit Singh, Prabhjot Singh and Deepak Thakur. 

On the other hand, the positives have been performances by skipper Dilip Tirkey and Adrian D?Souza to help the side, packed with as many as four rookies, make an impression. 

India?s German coach Gerhard Rach said his side was not treated seriously when they arrived in Pakistan. ?But now after we have put in some good performances, all that seems to be quickly changing.?

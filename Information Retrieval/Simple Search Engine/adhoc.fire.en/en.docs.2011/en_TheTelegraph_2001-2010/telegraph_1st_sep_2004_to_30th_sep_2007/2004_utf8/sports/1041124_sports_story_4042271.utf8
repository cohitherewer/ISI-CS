 Chinese star pays $282,000 compensation

Beijing: Zhang Yuning, a former striker of China?s national soccer team, has paid 2.34 million yuan ($ 282,000) in compensation to his former clubmate Qu Leheng, who became disabled in a car crash four years ago. 

Zhang, sued by Qu over the accident which left the latter in a wheelchair for life, has paid the total amount and also apologised. 

?I have asked my parents to remit the money to the account designated by the court,? Zhang was quoted as saying by the Xinhua news agency. 

Zhang was driving the car when it crashed into a tree on April 26, 2000. Zhang, who had fastened the seat belt, sustained slight injuries, but Qu, who was not in the belt protection, became paraplegic. 

Qu, now 27, was a rising star in 2000 when he replaced Zhang as the starting forward in that year?s Super Cup duel between the Chinese league champions Shangdong and the League Cup champions Liaoning on March four. 

He scored a hattrick to help his team beat Shandong 4-2. 

Qu had originally sought 5.74 million yuan ($ 691,560) to cover his lifetime expenses and make up for the loss of income owing to his disability. 

According to Zhangs lawyer, although his client thought the compensation was high, he would not seek a retrial.

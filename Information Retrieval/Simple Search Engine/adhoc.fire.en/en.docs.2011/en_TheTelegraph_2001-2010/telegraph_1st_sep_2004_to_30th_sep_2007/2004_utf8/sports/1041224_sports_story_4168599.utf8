The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Kaif thankful to John Wright

 - It was important not to panic, says Man of the Match 

Chittagong: Mohammed Kaif had not donned India colours since the eventful Mumbai Test versus Australia, early last month. But, as he showed in Chittagong on Thursday, the seven-week gap had done little to affect his hunger for the game. 

?I am thankful to John (Wright) for keeping me involved and making me work hard at nets throughout the Test series in which I had no role to play,? the middle-order batsman said after his MoM-winning 80 in the first ODI on Wednesday. 

Kaif went out to the middle with Team India in trouble at 45 for three. As captain Sourav Ganguly, Sachin Tendulkar and Yuvraj Singh had fallen cheaply, he and vice-captain Rahul Dravid set about repairing the damage. The two went on to collaborate 128 crucial runs. 

?Having Rahul at the other end during that partnership really helped,? Kaif said. ?Since we had lost early wickets, the key was not to panic. I kept my cool and that allowed me to prosper.? 

 On the M.A. Aziz Stadium track, Kaif felt it was double-paced. 

?Some balls kept low, some bounced high? it was easier to bat once you stayed at the wicket for some time and got your eye in,? Kaif said, adding that he was happy that he hung in and got 80.

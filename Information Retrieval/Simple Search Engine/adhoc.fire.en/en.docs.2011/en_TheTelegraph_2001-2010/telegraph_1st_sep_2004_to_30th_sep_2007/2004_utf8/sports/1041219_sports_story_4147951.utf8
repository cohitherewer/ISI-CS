The Telegraph - Calcutta

A fighter extraordinaire 

 - ?A great human being who had no enemies on or off the field?

Vadodara: On the cricket pitch, Vijay Samuel Hazare was a fighter par excellence. In life, too, he fought a prolonged battle with intestinal cancer before bowing to the killer disease at the age of 89 on Saturday afternoon. 

One of the legendary figures of Indian cricket, Hazare played 30 Tests between 1946 and 1953, scoring 2,192 runs at 47.65 per innings with seven centuries. He also bagged 20 wickets with his part-time seam bowling. 

But for World War II, which robbed him (and many others) of vital playing years, Hazare would have had several more Test runs and centuries in his kitty. 

The fact that Hazare had to wait till the 1946 tour of England to make his Test debut at the age of 31, tells its own tale of missed opportunities. 

Hazare?s first-class record provided a clearer picture of his talent and ability. In a career spanning 32 years, he compiled 18,754 runs in 239 matches at an average of 58.06, hitting 60 centuries and 73 fifties. He also took 599 wickets at 24.53 and held 166 catches. 

Hazare dominated the 1930s and 40s along with Vijay Merchant. The competition between the two ?Vijays?, to outdo one another in the Pentangular and Ranji Trophy meets, is part of Indian cricket?s folklore. 

According to contemporary cricketers and writers, Hazare?s forte were an immaculate defence and intense concentration which helped him notch up big knocks with pleasing regularity. 

Besides his seven Test centuries, Hazare had the distinction of scoring three hundreds in consecutive innings on three separate occasions in first-class cricket. 

His career-best 316 not out came for Maharashtra versus Baroda in 1939-40. Another significant knock saw him smashing 309 for Rest of India against Hindus in the Pentangular meet out of a total of 387 ? a staggering 80 per cent of the team tally. 

In Tests, Hazare averaged above 40 against every country he faced, with his best being 111.50 versus Pakistan at home in the first-ever series between the two countries. Hazare led India in 14 Tests, winning one, losing five and drawing eight. The solitary victory under his leadership was a landmark match as it happened to be India?s first Test triumph ? versus England in 1952. 

Hazare was discarded after a personally poor tour to the West Indies as captain in 1953 when he could muster only 194 runs at under 20 an innings. 

Against the same Caribbean side, Hazare had topped the averages five years earlier at home, accumulating 543 runs (at 67.87) including a typically gutsy, match-saving 134 not out in the second Test at the Brabourne Stadium. 

But the feat for which Hazare will be remembered forever 

is his two centuries in the 1947-48 Adelaide Test between Lala Amarnath?s India 

and Don Bradman?s Aussies ? the first-ever Test series between the two countries.

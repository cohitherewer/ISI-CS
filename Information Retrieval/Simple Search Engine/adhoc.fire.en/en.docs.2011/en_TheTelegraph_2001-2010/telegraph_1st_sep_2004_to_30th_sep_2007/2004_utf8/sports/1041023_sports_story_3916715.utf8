 Services cruise, Goa struggle

 A CORRESPONDENT 

 Climax Lawrence scored the all-important goal for Goa 

New Delhi: Seeded teams continued to hold sway in the quarter final phase of the 59th Indian Oil Corporation Santosh Trophy. In group A, Services swamped Uttar Pradesh 3-0 on Friday. Both teams are in Bengal?s group and coach Syed Nayeemuddin, after watching the match, has realised that the fit and fast Services will be no pushovers. 

In a group D match, Goa, with seven internationals in their team, lacked thrust upfront and struggled to oust tenacious Tamil Nadu. East Bengal?s international midfielder Climax Lawrence?s crisp volley enabled Goa win 1-0 and get three vital points. 

Both the winning skippers, Climax (Goa) and midfielder M. Raghu Kumar (Services) bagged the Man of the Match awards today. Goa coach Marcus Pacheco felt that his team would have to improve considerably in their crucial last match against Punjab on Sunday. He was worried about the lack of penetration of his strikers Alvito D?Cunha and R.C. Prakash. 

In contrast Services assistant coach Tapan Guchait said: ?We are ready for Bengal. People may raise eyebrows, but we can win.? He felt that Mehtab Hossain and Syed Rahim Nabi are Bengal?s key players and success will depend on their ability to keep them in check. 

Services meet Bengal on Sunday. As it is a three-team group, a defeat will leave Bengal with very little chance of advancing further. 

Nayeem is worried that Services may opt for a draw, using ultra-defensive tactics. In that case Bengal will have to score more goals in their last match against UP on Tuesday. Commenting on the situation, Nayeem said, ?we have to go for a win in both matches. Against Services we will try to get an early goal to control the game.? 

Bengal had an intensive workout this morning and Nayeem was happy with the form of Kalyan Chowbey. However he wants to continue with Dempo goalkeeper Abhijit Mondal. Dulal Biswas and Basudeb Mondal skipped practice Friday, but the coach was confident that all the injured players, including Chandan Das and Noel Wilson, will be fit for Sunday. 

Another major worry for Nayeem is Debjit Ghosh?s arrival on the morning of the match. Nayeem is in a quandary whether to risk starting with Debjit against the speedy Services. He may use him as a second-half substitute.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Defensive strategy taking shape

 - Selector V.P. Sathyan laments fall in standards

Calcutta: Debjit Ghosh and Co. got their first taste of the Salt Lake Stadium on Friday, three days after their preparation for the World Cup qualifier against Japan began following a dismal show in the LG Cup in Vietnam. The team, under Stephen Constantines tutelage, sweated out for about two hours at the venue of the match, slated for Wednesday. 

And with defence being the catchword in the camp, coach Stephen Constantine concentrated on various defensive formations during the practice. 

Having Sandip Nandy under the bar, he made a line of five in front of the custodian. Sameer Naik, captain Debjit, Dipak Mondal, Mahesh Gawli and Rennedy Singh formed the line from right to left. 

With a wire tied to all of them, the five players in tandem moved up and down while chasing the ball, while Constantines assistant, Aloke Mukherjee, played the referees role. 

Being up against the formidable opponents of Zicos boys, Constantines strategy of adopting a cautious approach looked much in progress, when he put another three in front of the rearguard. And it seemed obvious now that any plans of attacks were being given little importance in absence of Bhaichung Bhutia, who was ruled out due to knee injury. 

India lost to Asian Cup champions Japan 0-7 in the away tie, held in Saitama on June 9. 

Meanwhile, two selectors S. Brahmanand and V.P. Sathyan joined the camp on Friday. Standing by the coachs approach to the home match, Sathyan admitted the team stood little chance against the mighty Japanese. Qualitywise, they are far superior to us. Weve to be defensive against them, he said. He further lamented an existing dearth of talents in the county, who could act as back-up force for the current team. 

Aloke had played with me as a side back (for India). But regrettably, I find no body from the current crop of players who could match his talent and quality. True, standards have definitely fallen, Sathyan said. 

He, however, revealed that the national selectors have suggested to the AIFF to pick and train A team. The federation is planning on this line. But itll take time to have a good upcoming, back-up force, he said. 

But till then? Sathyan had no answer.

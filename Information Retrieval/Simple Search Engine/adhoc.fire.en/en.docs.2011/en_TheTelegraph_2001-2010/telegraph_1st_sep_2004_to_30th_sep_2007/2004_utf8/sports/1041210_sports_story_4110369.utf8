The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Police get Balu?s statement 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Bangalore: The police, despite their initial disinterest in the matter, have now started asking questions regarding the death of Dempo striker Cristiano de lima Junior. 

Maheswaran Balu, who was the referee during the Federation Cup final, told police officers here on Thursday that Mohun Bagan goalkeeper Subrata Paul collided with the Brazilian near the goalmouth while trying to gain control of the ball. 

?Balu gave us the sequence of events before Cristiano scored the second goal and the tragedy soon after. He said the striker and the goalkeeper rushed to take control of the ball, but collided in the process. Soon after scoring the goal, Cristiano took a few steps and fell down. He (Balu) said he noticed that Cristiano was lying still and then signalled for medical assistance. He spoke of action on the field (78th minute of the game), but not his conclusion on whether it was a deliberate attack by the goalkeeper,? a senior police officer told The Telegraph. 

When contacted, Balu refused to comment, only saying that ?I have submitted my report to AIFF.? 

The referee?s statement was recorded as part of investigations launched by the city police on a complaint submitted by Dempo?s coach Armando Colaco. 

The officer said the statements of linesmen, coaches of both teams and office bearers of KSFA will be recorded as part of the investigation. ?This will take some time because we have to send notices to a large number of witnesses to come here and give their statements,? he said. 

On Thursday, a copy of the preliminary autopsy report was sent to Goa. The copy was sought by Cristiano?s relatives to complete the formalities for flying the body to Brazil. 

This report has stated that cardiac arrest was the cause for death. However, his pathology investigations were on at the Forensic Science Laboratory here and the Bangalore Medical College. 

?These reports will help detect whether it was caused by excitement or induced by any performance-enhancing drug. These findings will help draw up the final report on the cause for Cristiano?s death,? doctors at the Government Victoria Hospital here said.

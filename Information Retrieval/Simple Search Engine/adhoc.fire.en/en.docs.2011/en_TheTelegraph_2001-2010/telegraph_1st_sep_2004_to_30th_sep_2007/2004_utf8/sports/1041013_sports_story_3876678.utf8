Dubai: Former Pakistan skipper Imran Khan has compared Indian left-arm medium pacer Irfan Pathan to Wasim Akram, saying the 19-year-old has all the qualities that the retired pace spearhead had in his youth. 

?I see all the qualities that Akram had as a youngster in Pathan. In fact, I find that he (Pathan), at his age, has more patience than Akram had. He has a bright future ahead of him,? Imran said during a luncheon here. 

?I think Pathan could go on to become another Akram,? Imran was quoted as saying by the Gulf News on Tuesday. 

During the series in Australia, Pathan had approached Akram, who he idolises, for a few tips and the paceman readily obliged. Only to face severe criticism back home in Pakistan. 

Imran also complimented Sunil Gavaskar at the luncheon speech. ?Gavaskar was the only one who had predicted that Pakistan would win the 1992 World Cup and when we did it, he became a hero with the Pakistanis,? he said.

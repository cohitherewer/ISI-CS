 IN THE CITY

 Mohun Bagan are likely to leave Jo Paul Ancheri, Palash Karmakar and Bivash Ghosh out of the Federation Cup-bound squad. According to sources, the trio has been observed by coach Subrata Bhattacharya as ?not match-fit? and therefore, ?unlikely to make the squad.? The 20-member squad will be formally announced on Sunday.

 Meanwhile, Rennedy Singh, who signed for Mohun Bagan on Friday, has joined the practice session. While he would be available for the Bangalore tournament, Brazilian Eduardo Coelho, who is yet to recover from injury, may sit out the first match.

 The officials? supposed meeting with the players didn?t take place on Saturday. But Bhattacharya held a long session with his wards.

 Ever-Ready coached by Aloke Mukherjee leave for Bangalore on Sunday for their maiden appearance.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Kunte in quick draw with top seed 

 - International Open

- Four stay half-a-point behind leader after Round VI 

BIPIN SHENOY

Dibyendu Barua and Surya Sekhar Ganguly drew 

their game in 17 moves 

Calcutta: Overnight leader, GM Abhijit Kunte 

of India, expectedly drew his game quickly against top seed, Aleksej Alexandrov 

of Belarus, to retain his position at the top in the international open chess 

tournament at Alekhine Chess Club, Gorky Sadan, on Friday. 

After the end of the sixth round, Kunte leads the fray with 5 points. He is followed by four players ? Ni Hua, Enamul Hossain, Oleg Romanishin and Alesej Alexandrov? on 4.5 points. 

With most players unwilling to take risks on the day, the games were short and insipid. The spectators, who had gathered to witness some fireworks by the players on the board were clearly disappointed. 

The only solace for them was the blitzkrieg win by the Chinese Hua against Bangladesh GM Ziaur Rahaman and the Bangladeshi IM Enamul Hossain?s upset victory over GM Nguyen Anh Dung of Vietnam. 

Hua, playing white, kept his king in the centre and went for a sharp kingside attack in reply to Zia?s Pirc defence. 

Zia lost a pawn on the kingside and later was unable to withstand the collective onslaught of Hua?s pieces. Zia resigned on the 24th move when faced with inevitable mate. 

Hossain, on the other hand, once again accounted for a Grandmaster on Friday. Playing with black against GM Nguyen Anh Dung in a Slav defence, Hossain obtained a superior minor piece endgame and went on to win the game after a marathon 70 moves. 

Hossain, who had earlier scalped Zia and GM Surya Sekhar Ganguly, stands a good chance of getting his second GM norm here. 

On the third board, GM Timur Gareev of Uzbekistan and Dao Thien Hai also settled for quick draw. Local GMs Dibyendu Barua and Surya Sekhar drew their game in just 17 moves in the Pelikan variation of the Sicilian defence. 

GM Oleg Romanishin of Ukraine faced little resistance from the Indian IM Dinesh Kumar Sharma in a Catalan opening. Sharma not only lost a pawn on the 15th move but had to bear the brunt of Romanishin?s attack on the kingside.

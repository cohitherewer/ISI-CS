 Jones to sue 

 - ?Truth will come out? 

 Marion 

San Francisco: US sprint queen Marion Jones says she?ll sue accused steroid peddler Victor Conte over his allegations that she received banned drugs before winning five medals at the Sydney Olympics. 

?Victor Conte?s allegations about me are not true, and the truth will come out in the appropriate forum,? Jones said in a statement issued through her attorney. 

?I have instructed my lawyers to vigorously explore a defamation lawsuit against Victor Conte.? 

Conte, one of four men facing criminal charges in the investigation of the Bay Area Laboratory Cooperative (BALCO), which he founded, says in a television interview that he supplied Jones with several banned drugs and instructed her how to use them. 

Jones, who has steadfastly denied any wrongdoing, won three gold medals and two bronze medals in Sydney but struggled this year simply to qualify for the Athens Games. 

She has never failed a drug test. 

However, the US anti-doping agency (USADA) fingered BALCO as the source of the previously undetectable designer steriod tetrahydrogestrinone (THG), and information gathered by federal agents in the BALCO case has already been used to impose sanctions on athletes for various drug infractions, even though they hadn?t tested positive.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Bengal lose a thriller

A STAFF REPORTER

 Rohan?s 111 not out went in vain 

Calcutta: Gujarat snatched a thrilling two-wicket victory in their Ranji Trophy Elite group A match against Bengal at Siliguri?s Kanchenjungha Stadium on Sunday. 

According to information received here, the visitors reached their target of 217 in 41.4 overs with Akash Christian (67) and Niraj Patel (70) playing the lead roles yet again. Ranadeb Bose bagged five for 77 for a match-haul of 11, but his effort went down the drain. 

So did Rohan Gavaskar?s. The skipper remained unbeaten on 111 before declaring the innings on 279 for six, thus setting Gujarat a challenging target of 217 at almost five an over. 

Ranadeb struck early, but a century stand between Christian and N. Patel set Gujarat on road to victory. The two this time collaborated 128. 

Ranadeb and Shib Sankar Paul struck at regular intervals after the departure of Christian and Patel, but Gujarat just about scraped through in a nail-biting finish.

Calcutta: The Zico-orchestrated Japanese show has left town, leaving an indelible impression on this soccer-crazy city. It?s time to quickly switch back to the real world, the mundane business of a Super Division Super Six duel featuring East Bengal and Mohun Bagan. 

Mundane it may be, compared to the high-quality fare dished out by the Asian giants against our clueless national team, but by no means will a clash between the traditional rivals ever lack interest or passion. Those fans who lapped up every move of the Shinji Onos and Miyamotos Wednesday evening, will flock to the Salt Lake Stadium Saturday afternoon, fully aware that there will be a significant difference in the quality of soccer. 

Zico?s boys won?t be on view, but attention will once again be focussed on the foreigners (two in each side) who have become an integral part of Indian clubs these days. East Bengal will bank heavily on the allround skills of Brazilian Douglas da Silva, while adding muscle to the defence will either be Ghanaian Suley Musah or Nigerian Louis Aniweta. 

Mohun Bagan, on the other hand, have Eduardo Coelho at the heart of defence, the Brazilian having established himself as the Mr Dependable. They were also hoping (against hope) that striker Roberto Beto - another one from Ronaldo-land - would get his international transfer certificate in time to be registered for the Saturday derby. The clearance didnt come till late at night. 

Betos loss was Nigerian Suleiman Hamids gain. Both strikers were in the thick of action during the two-hour workout Friday morning as coach Subrata Bhattacharya was keen to field one of them as Sunil Chhetris partner up front. Hamids papers were ready, so he was made to sign across the dotted lines around 9 pm. 

It?s the strikers who have given the coach severe headaches this season. Chhetri had a long lay-off early on and by the time he got fit, Ashim Biswas was ruled out following a surgery. No wonder Bhattacharya is desperate to rope in a foreigner for the crucial game. 

The midfield will get a boost with the return of Tomba Singh from India duty. The absence of the in-form Amit Das (red card) and the hard-working Noel Wilson (malaria), however, could well be felt. Also out of action is injured goal-tender Prasanta Dora, giving young Subrata Pal the chance to make his ?big match? debut. 

Mohun Bagan have their nose in front after the first phase of the league, enjoying a one-point advantage over East Bengal. A victory on Saturday will put Bhattacharya?s men firmly on course to the coveted title. But that is easier said than done. 

 For starters, Subhas Bhowmick has a more balanced outfit at his command. And this, despite the fact that Bhaichung Bhutia has been ruled out of the game for some time to come. East Bengal, after all, have got used to life without their star striker. 

The red-and-golds have had a pretty ordinary run-up to this big clash, dropping as many as 10 points in 13 first-phase games. The absence of a clutch of top players, who were at the national camp, was a factor in East Bengal?s dip in form. Now that all of them have rejoined club duty, Bhowmick should be a relieved man. 

The return of Sangram Mukherjee, Dipak Mondal, Debjit Ghosh, Climax Lawrence and Bijen Singh will give East Bengal the fillip they need to shrug off the mediocrity of the recent past. Climax is carrying a minor injury and Bijen is running a fever, but both are expected to be in the starting line-up. 

Though neither coach revealed his first XI, Bhowmick is likely to stick to his trusted 3-5-2 formation. Bijen will be the lone striker, but Bhowmick ? unlike his opposite number ? will not lose sleep over his team?s lack of firepower. Douglas has amply demonstrated his scoring skills this season ? he is the leading scorer with seven goals. Then there are the likes of Alvito D?Cunha and Dipankar Roy, who can chip in when the chips are down. 

In the season?s first clash, almost two months ago, East Bengal had to come from behind to salvage honours. This one could well go their way.

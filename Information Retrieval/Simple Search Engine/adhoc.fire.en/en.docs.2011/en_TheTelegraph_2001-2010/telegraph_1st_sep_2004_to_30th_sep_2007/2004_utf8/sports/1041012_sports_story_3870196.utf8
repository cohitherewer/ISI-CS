 ?I was looking to run 2:05 flat but the weather wasn?t good,? said the 26-year-old. Rutto held off compatriot Daniel Njenga and Japan?s Toshinari Takaoka who were second and third respectively.

 Zagreb: Croatia?s national soccer coach Zlatko Kranjcar returned home after his side?s disappointing 2-2 draw against Bulgaria on Saturday to find his flat had been burgled during the game. 

 ?While Croatian players could only watch their advantage melting (against Bulgaria), Kranjcar?s assets at home were also disappearing,? a leading daily said on Monday.

 The Zagreb police confirmed the burglary but declined to say what had been taken from the flat where the 47-year-old coach lives with his wife and daughter, who had both attended the game. Kranjcar said the stolen items included two gold watches and some jewellery.

 Jockeys force cancellation 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: The Royal Western India Turf Club (RWITC) stewards were forced to cancel Sunday?s Pune race card after jockeys refused to participate in the day?s proceedings, according to RWITC sources. ?Jockeys were mourning fellow-professional Yogender Singh?s death on Saturday,? added a Mumbai source.

 Yogender had a fatal fall from his ride Dilnawaz in Saturday?s second race, the Prince Jehan Trophy. ?We appreciate jockeys uniting in this hour of grief. But such a decision could have been taken on Saturday itself in order to avoid harassment to the public on Sunday,? said an RWITC member, who did not want to be identified. 

 Stewards, however, tried their utmost to see the day?s programme through. An hour- long meeting, with jockeys? representatives, which begun shortly before the start of the first race at 2 pm, yielded no result. Jockeys Association of India (JAI) president, Pesi Shroff, was not available for comment. 

 In view of the cancellation, stewards decided to defer Sunday?s star event, the Idar Gold Trophy, to October 1.

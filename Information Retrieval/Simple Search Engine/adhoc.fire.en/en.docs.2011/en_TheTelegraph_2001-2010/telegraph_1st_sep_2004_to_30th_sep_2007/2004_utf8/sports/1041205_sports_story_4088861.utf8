The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Achrekar advice for Sourav

A STAFF REPORTER 

 Ajit Agarkar gets a tip from Ramakant Achrekar during the Bengal-Mumbai Ranji Trophy match at Jadavpur University?s Salt Lake campus ground on Saturday 

Calcutta: Ramakant Archekar has a piece of advice for Team India captain Sourav Ganguly. That as a leader, he should control his temper. 

According to Sachin Tendulkar?s guru, Sourav is the ?best captain in India?, but ?he shouldn?t be so hot-tempered.? 

?He (Sourav) should take things in his stride. Captaining India is a big responsibility and he need to be patient when things won?t go his way,? felt Archrekar, who came to the Javadpur University?s Salt Lake campus ground to watch the Bengal-Mumbai match on Friday. 

 Archrekar, who turned 73 on Friday, will be in the city for about a month to coach one of his students here. 

The septuagenarian was all praise for Wasim Jaffer and believed the Mumbai opener should find a place in the Indian squad. 

Talking about his most-renowned disciple, he admitted that Sachin ?is not as dominating as he used to be?. 

?Sachin had to curb his natural instincts for the sake of his team. 

?And it?s not easy to maintain the same standards for so many years,? he said of the batting maestro.

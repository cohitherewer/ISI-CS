 CA shelves Darwin, Cairns

Sydney: Cricket Australia announced on Thursday that it was dropping plans to hold more Test matches in the northern cities of Cairns or Darwin until at least 2007. 

Chief executive James Sutherland said Cairns and Darwin were being temporarily dropped as Test venues so Australia could focus on retaining the Ashes Trophy in England next year. 

The so-called Top End series in the two northern cities started in 2003 with two Tests and a one-day match against Bangladesh. 

This year, Australia hosted Sri Lanka for a Test in each of the cities. But Sutherland said the Australian team would not play up north again before Zimbabwe and Bangladesh tours to the country in 2007 and 2008. 

Our absolute priority and focus in 2005 is on retaining the Ashes Trophy in England, which rules out any possibility of bringing cricket to the Top End next year, he said.

 New Delhi: Former world amateur snooker champion Pankaj Advani will be heading to England next year for advance training under the central government?s talent search scheme.

 This is the second time that Advani would be going for training under the scheme, which provides monetary support of up to Rs 5 lakh for training-cum-competition in England, Billiards and Snooker Federation vice-president Ravi Tandon said. The 20-year-old had availed of this scheme in July last year and two months later, won the world title in Jiangmin, China.

 An elated Advani said he was looking forward to his English stint. ?This year I did not participate in tour events outside India as travelling to England is very costly and if you want to play in the professional league, one needs to be based there.?

 Saurav Kothari, the country?s second-ranked junior, went to England in March this year under the same scheme.

 Glasgow: Scottish Premier League (SPL) officials are to have discussions in January about bringing back the popular three-week winter break. Rangers and Celtic managers Alex McLeish and Martin O?Neill are among those who have advocated the return of the break, which ran for three weeks in January from the 1998-1999 season to 2002-2003. 

 An SPL spokesman confirmed the topic is up for debate at the next meeting of the Football Working Group (FWG), which includes the likes of Aberdeen director of football Willie Miller and John Robertson, assistant manager of Celtic.

 ?We have set up the FWG... They look into a range of matters from a purely football point of view and one of the issues is the structure of the season, which includes the winter break,? he said. ?They put forward their recommendations for the (SPL) board to consider.?

 Seoul: Busan I-cons beat Bucheon SK 4-3 in a penalty shootout to win the South Korean FA Cup on Sunday after a 1-1 draw following extra-time. Coached by former Chelsea manager Ian Porterfield, Busan took the lead in the sixth minute when Brazilian Adriano pounced from close range in Changwon.

 Bucheon?s Byun Jae-seop restored parity two minutes later in a Christmas Day clash between two of the K-League?s perennial strugglers. Neither team had previously reached the final of the tournament, which was launched in 1996.

 Busan, who finished ninth in the overall K-League standings this season, thrashed Ulsan Tigers 5-1 in the semi-finals, while bottom club Bucheon overcame Taejon Citizen on penalties.

 Suwon Bluewings won the K-League earlier this month.

 Lagos: Former Nigeria captain Segun Odegbami has been named interim secretary-general of the country?s Football Association (NFA) as part of plans to free it from government interference and avoid an international ban. 

 Odegbami takes over from ex-international Taiwo Ogunjobi, who was appointed by the government in 2002. Fifa has threatened to bar the team from international competitions if association officials continued to be appointed by Nigeria?s sports minister rather than being elected.

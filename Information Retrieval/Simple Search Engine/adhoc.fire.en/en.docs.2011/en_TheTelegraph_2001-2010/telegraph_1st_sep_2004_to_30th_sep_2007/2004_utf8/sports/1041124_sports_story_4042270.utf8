 Allan Lamb criticises SA approach

New Delhi: The approach of the South Africans in the first cricket Test against India drew flak from former England batsman Allan Lamb, who said on Tuesday such defensive tactics would not produce a result. 

?There is not point in batting till the third day, that won?t bring any result,? said Lamb, who was born to English parents in South Africa and played domestic cricket in that country in the initial stages of his career. 

Lamb was also critical of the South African board?s transformation policy and said form and not colour should be the criteria for selecting a team. 

?I do not support Omar Henry for forming a coloured team. You have to consider their form and not their colour to include them in team,? he said at a press conference. 

The 50-year-old, who made both his Test and one-day debut against India, also said South Africans were struggling because they lacked quality fast bowlers especially since the retirement of Allan Donald. 

Lamb said England had their best chance of beating Australia in the ashes this summer because they had strong bowlers in Steve Harmison and Andrew Flintoff. 

On the ?walking? debate, he said he was not in favour of walking out without waiting for the umpire?s decision. 

?I don?t believe in walking. It is okay in County cricket but not at the international level, at least I would not walk.? 

Lamb is in town for a rib-tickling live chat show along with his former teammate Ian Botham and MTV VJ Cyrus Broacha. The show will have the two cricketing icons regaling audiences with anecdotes from their playing days and repartee to tricky questions. 

The show will also be staged in Bangalore and Mumbai.

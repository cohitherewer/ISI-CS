Madrid: Leaders Barcelona dropped points for only the second time this season when they drew 1-1 at 10-man Athletic Bilbao in a Primera Liga game on Saturday. 

Samuel Eto?o scored his eighth goal of the campaign to put the visitors ahead in the 11th minute but Bilbao hit back almost immediately thanks to a spectacular volley from midfielder Fran Yeste. 

Last season?s champions Valencia, who had lost their last four games in all competitions, gave a nerve-riddled performance as they allowed 10-man Atletico Madrid to fight back from a goal down to claim a 1-1 draw in a disjointed match at the Mestalla. The results left Barca six points clear at the top of the table. Valencia remain third, one point ahead of Atletico. 

Barca, who fell victim to third division Gramenet in the King?s Cup in midweek, were forced on to the back foot in the opening minutes at San Mames. But Frank Rijkaard?s side weathered the early storm and took the lead against the run of play courtesy of the in-form Eto?o. 

The Cameroon international cracked the ball past keeper Daniel Aranzubia after youth team defender Damia, who was making his debut for Barca in the league, had ballooned in a cross from the right. 

But Bilbao were unflustered by the early setback and hit back just three minutes later when the highly-rated Yeste equalised with a classy volley after centre forward Ismael Urzaiz had headed the ball over the static Barca defence. 

Both sides pushed forward in the second half, but it was Bilbao who enjoyed what was probably the best chance to take the lead when the outstanding Yeste shaved the far post after controlling an Asier Del Horno cross with his toe. 

Bilbao had to endure a nervous finale after Carlos Gurpegi was sent off for successive fouls on Andres Iniesta, but held on to join Atletico Madrid as the only two sides to have held the Catalans this season. 

Valencia midfielder Pablo Aimar was discharged from hospital on Sunday after spending the night under observation after a blow to the head but has been ruled out of next week?s Champions League match at Inter Milan. ?Aimar will undergo further tests during the week to monitor his condition,? Valencia said on their website. ?He is out of the match against Inter Milan.? 

The Argentine international collapsed two minutes into the match at the Mestalla after being accidentally kicked in the face by defender Pablo Ibanez as he dived to head a ball. ?He suffered a complete loss of consciousness, was unable to breath properly for a short while and remembers nothing about the match,? club doctor Jorge Candel told Radio Marca. 

Aimar?s injury appeared to affect both teams and the game only really sparked into life after Miguel Angel Angulo put Valencia ahead midway through the second half. 

But although they were reduced to 10 men with the dismissal of forward Veljko Paunovic five minutes later, Atletico grabbed a point when striker Fernando Torres drilled home from the edge of the area after wrong-footing the Valencia defence. 

The match was Valencia?s seventh without a win, and is likely to add to the pressure on Ranieri after Wednesday?s humiliating King?s Cup loss to second division Lleida. 

Meanwhile in Italy, AC Milan maintained the pressure on Serie A leaders Juventus on Saturday after a goal by striker Andriy Shevchenko gave them a 1-0 win against Sampdoria. 

The result consolidated Milan?s second place in the division with 20 points from nine games, two fewer than Juve.ntus. Milan?s city rivals Inter are a further seven points adrift after losing the lead to draw 1-1 with Lazio at the San Siro stadium. 

Milan had won all their away matches this season, but Sampdoria?s defence comfortably soaked up the pressure in a tight first half. 

After the break Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti replaced Tomasson with Shevchenko and the substitution paid off in the 76th minute when winger Serginho surged through Sampdoria?s defence. Antonioli blocked his shot, but couldn?t prevent the ball falling into the path of the Ukrainian, who slotted home the rebound. Inter came out in a more determined fashion after the break, however, and took the lead less than 60 seconds later when Adriano raced on to a long pass and beat keeper Matteo Sereni with a powerful left-footed shot. 

For long periods of the second half Lazio?s attack failed to threaten at all, but with six minutes remaining defender Leonardo Talamonti rose to head a cross past Fontana and condemn Inter to their seventh draw in nine games. 

In Bundesliga, Bulgarian striker Martin Petrov scored all four of VfL Wolfsburg?s goals as the surprise leaders completed a thrilling 4-3 comeback win against FSV Mainz on Saturday. Schalke 04, on a five-match winning streak under new coach Ralf Rangnick, leapt into second on 21 points with a 3-2 win over Stuttgart, who slipped back to third on 20. 

Bayern Munich also lost, upset by lowly Borussia Moenchengladbach 2-0. (Reuters)

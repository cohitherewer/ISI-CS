Calcutta: When Zico took over Japan soon after their pre-quarter final exit from the World Cup, a significant paradigm shift took place in the countrys footballing psyche. 

During the reign of his predecessor, Frenchman Philippe Troussier, tactics and discipline were most important. Zico imbibed into it the attacking flair and the result was immediate. 

As one of the Japanese officials pointed out, its not straight from the books of Brazilian gharana, but something in conformity with the island-nations style of fast-paced football. 

The Brazilian is now sitting pretty on his job, with satisfactions coming from his teams unbeaten run in the World Cup qualifiers here and the Asian Cup win there. 

Asked if he had any dream of coaching Ronaldo and Ronaldinho, he promptly said no, with an emphasis on his association with Japan. 

Ive never thought of coaching Brazil. At present, Ive been given a job by the Japanese Football Association and Im pretty satisfied with it, Zico told a press conference on Tuesday. 

The creative midfielder, however, admitted Carlos Alberto Parreiras side is in an enviable position right now. Brazil have the luxury of choosing the upfront from six attacking players. Such depth bodes well for Parreira, and his team is definitely favourite to retain the World Cup in Germany, he maintained. 

Queries on his famous miscued penalty against France in 1986 World Cup came and he brushed it aside as a thing of past. Its better not to dwell on the past and look forward for something new, he replied. 

His association with J-League side Kashima Antlers as a player was key in transforming Japan from an also-ran to a force to reckon with. Brooding over those days, Zico felt his experience of playing in Brazil and Serie A of Italy came in handy when he came to Japan. 

The huge Salt Lake Stadium gave him a semblance of the Marcana back in his hometown, Rio de Janeiro. The only difference is that its empty here and I hope itll be full tomorrow, he signed off.

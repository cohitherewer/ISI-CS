The Telegraph - Calcutta

Hopes on Sania, Karan 

- Waiting for a new star to emerge from India's seemingly 

barren tennis landscape

Serve and Volley

Naresh Kumar

In the past, thank heavens my predictions about the 

future of Indian tennis have invariably gone awry. From the moonscape, as I have 

often described the Indian tennis scene in the past, emerged the great of Indian 

tennis.

After Ramanathan Krishnan came Vijay Amritraj, then 

Ramesh Krishnan followed by Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi. The common factor 

among them was that they had very strong family support.

Paes and Bhupathi took Indian tennis to a new high 

and created history by winning Grand Slam doubles and mixed doubles titles.

In the Davis Cup, India?s ratings soared with upset 

victories over much higher ranked teams. With not even a handful of players, India 

have been kings of Asian tennis and enjoyed a more than respectable presence in 

international events. It gave Indian tennis a false sense of well being. 

Paes and Bhupathi have kept the flag flying in the 

high visibility Grand Slams for many years and are now in their twilight of their 

careers. At the same time, Asian standards, both in the men and women?s world 

have dramatically shot up. 

In recent years, while no Indian man or woman has 

even qualified for the men?s or ladies? singles, countries like Thailand, Korea, 

Taiwan and China have made an impact at the Grand Slams? ATP and WTA tournaments.

For the first time in Indian history a young Pakistani 

? Aqeel Khan ? won our national championships. 

In the Davis Cup we may dream of making the elite 

group of 16 but in reality it is a mirage. In fact, if Thailand, Korea or Taiwan 

participate with their top players, we will be under pressure to win the Asia-Oceania 

Group I in the future. The glory days of the Davis Cup belong to the past and 

are now deeply buried in Indian tennis history.

Our Davis Cup players, Prakash Amritraj, Harsh Mankad 

and Rohan Bopanna (recovering from an injured shoulder) ? leaders of India?s young 

brigade ? are now getting long in the tooth and have not been able to break through 

and make a significant impact even at the lower levels of the game.

Other promising youngsters, who have been participating 

in Futures and Challenger tournaments held in India have also been struggling 

to win matches in spite of the advantage of playing on home courts. 

Moving from junior level to the senior level is the 

most difficult phase in a successful tennis player?s life. 

The record books show that it takes approximately 

three to four years for juniors to mature and achieve peak levels in fitness and 

match play.

So many great talents never make it. Mostly, it is 

due to lack of adequate and sustained financial support.

The other very important factor is to be shown the 

path by proper coaching, physical training and exposure to high-level competition. 

Exposure to competitive pressures alone determines 

the true mettle of a player. For this, continuous play at the higher levels of 

the game is an absolute must. 

All this costs big money.

Currently two of our youngsters who have done reasonably 

well at the international level are 18-year-olds Sania Mirza and Karan Rastogi. 

Sania won the Wimbledon girls? junior doubles title 

in 2003 much to everyone?s surprise, while Karan was ranked the No. 3 junior in 

the world after he reached the semi-finals of the Australian Open juniors this 

year. 

 Paes and Bhupathi now are in the twilight of their 

career.

Sania?s victory in the junior girls? doubles at Wimbledon 

was a shot in the arm for Indian tennis. Tennis fans and the press were euphoric. 

It seemed like a future champion had popped out of the hat.

On Sania?s young shoulders fell the telling burden 

of great expectations. Today, more than a year later, Sania has not been transformed 

into an Indian Sharapova. Yet, her perseverance has shown a steady and heartening 

improvement. 

With a generous sponsor (GVK group) and solid parental 

support she has, by participating and winning smaller tournaments, moved to 193 

in the women?s ATP rankings. Being a finalist in the Asian Championships has secured 

her a direct entry into next year?s Australian Open.

Currently being coached and advised by Bob Brett at 

his Sen Remo academy on the Italian Riviera in three sessions annually which include 

physical training, she is on the right path. 

When I talked to her on the phone, there was passion 

and determination in her voice and words. 

After having all this, one also needs luck. While 

wishing her luck in breaking through to the top 100 one must pay tribute to the 

parents for their unstinted support.

Karan happily enjoys as much parental support as Sania. 

He was picked by IMG talent scouts after he won the Asian under-14 championships 

in Vietnam. For the last four years IMG has supported him by allowing him free 

coaching and physical training at Nick Bolletieri?s coaching academy, which is 

owned by them. 

They strictly monitor his tournament schedule and 

he has to report on his performance and physical condition every week. Three or 

four visits a year to the academy ensure that Karan stays on track. 

Karan was selected by the ITF as a member of the junior 

team to participate in eight tournaments, including the French Championships and 

Wimbledon.

It is obvious that he is very talented, and is being 

well tutored. He has to make the breakthrough at senior levels within a couple 

of years or else it will be too late. One can wish him the very best of luck.

There are many talented boys and girls in India who 

have been striving to make a breakthrough to the higher levels. The stumbling 

blocks are not the lack of talent but meaningful sustained sponsorships, top-level 

world-class coaches and facilities and constant exposure to international competition.

All these in ample measure can put India back at the 

top of Asian tennis in a few years. They say that history repeats itself. I hope 

it does and like in the past a new star emerges from the seemingly barren landscape 

of Indian tennis.

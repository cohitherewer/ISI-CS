 Rice comments irk UCBSA

Durban: The United Cricket Board of South Africa (UCBSA) has expressed its disappointment over former captain Clive Rice?s remarks that transformation of cricket in the country was ?inverted racism?. 

?Everybody knows this is not true,? Moabi Litheko, a spokesperson for UCBSA said. ?There?s more white players in the system than players of colour. What kind of reverse racism is this?? he asked. 

Rice, who led South Africa when they visited India on their return to the world sporting arena after the end of apartheid in the early 1990s, made the controversial comments to the Daily Telegraph in Johannesburg. 

He also said that young white players were leaving the country because the board was practising reverse racism. He claimed that South African cricket was heading in the same direction as Zimbabwe. 

?Why do you think South Africa is slipping down the rankings? We aren?t much better than Zimbabwe or Bangladesh, who are, frankly, pathetic. They call it Test cricket when it?s no better than a series of charity matches. The public aren?t stupid. Mediocrity chases crowds away,? Rice said.

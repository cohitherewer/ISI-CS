The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Bagan may field two new faces

 - Easy start for Bhattacharya?s men likely today 

A CORRESPONDENT

 Ancheri may be a defensive medio 

New Delhi: Playing in the Durand tournament after a two-year gap Mohun Bagan start their campaign Wednesday with a relatively easy match. The sixteen-time champions take on the Gautam Sarkar-coached Assam Rifles in group C. 

Bagan, though, will be without four key players ? midfielders Tomba Singh and Jerry Zirsanga, goalkeeper Prasanta Dora and striker Ashim Biswas ? who are in the Indian team bound for Kuwait. 

Bagan coach Subrata Bhattacharya said he intends to try out his new recruits against Assam Rifles. Defenders Roopesh and left back Niaz, recruited in the second transfer window from Fransa Club, Goa will both make their debut for Bagan Wednesday. Eduardo Coelho, the Brazilian defender in Bagan?s ranks is also certain to play. Jo Paul Ancheri will also be tried as defensive midfielder. 

Bagan have a problem of plenty in midfield. Both Noel Wilson and Ancheri can function as defensive midfielders. The in-form midfielders Mehtab Hossein, Basudeb Mondal, Amit Das and Dharamjit Singh are also available. 

Subrata?s problems are up front. He has only two strikers, Delhi based Sunil Chhetri and new recruit Nigerian James. Subrata said that their Brazilian striker Roberto Mendes Silva (Beto) is recovering from fever and will play if the team reaches the semi-finals. Beto has been registered in the Bagan squad for the Durand tournament. 

Chhetri will be playing in front of his home crowd, for the first time in the Bagan jersey. He played creditably in the recent Santosh Trophy for Delhi scoring seven goals. 

Bhattacharya said: ?Ourtarget is the trophy, and we want to start with a big win.? 

The other team in the group, State Bank of Travancore, have already beaten Assam Rifles 3-1 and Bagan need a superior goal difference before the their deciding match with SBT Friday. 

Bagan last won the Durand tournament in 2000 beating Mahindra United 2-1 in the final. Subrata was the coach then also.

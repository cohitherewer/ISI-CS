Alicante (Spain): Fabrice Santoro will need to play the Davis Cup tie of his life if France are to upset claycourt specialists Spain here and reach their fourth final in six seasons. 

With Sebastien Grosjean and Nicolas Escude both unavailable, France captain Guy Forget on Thursday named Santoro to play singles and doubles and surprisingly relegated Arnaud Clement to the sidelines. 

That will mean three matches for Santoro on successive days from Friday in hot and humid conditions at the Plaza de Toros, the city?s 10,000 capacity bullring. 

Santoro has a modest Davis Cup singles record, losing five of his 11 matches dating back to 1991, and has not played an opening-day singles match in the competition since 1997. 

The 31-year-old will take on Juan Carlos Ferrero in the second match out on court on Friday, after Carlos Moya and Paul-Henri Mathieu have contested the first point, and he is aware of the difficulty of the task facing him. 

After Friday?s opening singles, Santoro will line up alongside Michael Llodra to take on Rafael Nadal and Tommy Robredo in the doubles, before returning on Sunday to play Moya in the first of the two reverse singles. 

In Moya and Ferrero, Spain have two of the world?s best claycourt players and with weather and court conditions in their favour, the 2000 champions are confident of making what would be a third final in five years, against either the US or Belarus. 

Ferrero has had a frustrating season after suffering a rib injury and going through a bout of chicken pox, and he is eyeing a second Davis Cup crown to round off the year on a more satisfying note. 

?My form is ideal now,? Ferrero said. ?I?ve been training hard and I?m fully fit.? 

Spain have beaten France on four of the five occasions they have played in the Davis Cup. The last meeting was back in 1972.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Subroto eyes level III course 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Remember medium pacer Subroto Banerjee, who played only one Test for India against Australia in Sydney in 1992 and a couple of years thereafter shifted his base permanently to Sydney? In that match in 1992, he scalped three wickets in the first innings but never got an opportunity in the second. 

The former medium pacer is now engaged as the fast bowling coach-cum-player for the Black Town Club in Sydney. The club is placed in the grade I of the Sydney Grade Cricket. ?Michael Bevan and Gavin Robertson also play for my club,? Banerjee revealed, while speaking to The Telegraph at the Eden on Tuesday. 

Banerjee, however, intends to complete his level III coaches? coaching course by 2005. ?I have already completed Level II and will do level III,? he said.

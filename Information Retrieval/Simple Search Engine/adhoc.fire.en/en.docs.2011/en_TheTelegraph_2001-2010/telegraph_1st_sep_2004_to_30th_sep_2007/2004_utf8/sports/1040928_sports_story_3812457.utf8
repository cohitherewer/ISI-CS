 London: Injury-hit England fast bowler Alex Tudor has been released by Surrey County Cricket Club with a year remaining on his contract. Tudor, who has played 10 Tests, was released after completing just one championship match this year.

 ?Alex has been struggling with his fitness for a while now and unfortunately he has only been able to complete one championship game this season,? said chief executive Paul Sheldon. Once considered one of England?s most promising quick bowlers Tudor, who turns 27 next month, has suffered dips in form and a succession of injuries. ?Surrey has been my home for the past 10 years and I am sad to be leaving,? Tudor said. 

 Rijeka (Croatia): Former Wimbledon champion Goran Ivanisevic may have retired from tennis but he insists he can still lead Croatia to Davis Cup glory. Ivanisevic, who retired this summer, is now No. 2 to Croatian Davis Cup captain Nici Pilic and was closely involved in his country?s 3-2 win over Belgium which gave Croatia a place in the Davis Cup World Group for 2005. Ivanisevic said: ?I feel this team with Ivan Ljubicic and Mario Ancic can go all the way some day and win the Davis Cup.? 

 Madrid: Roberto Heras became only the second rider to claim three Tour of Spain title?s on Sunday when he held off a charging Santiago Perez in the final stage. Only Swiss Tony Rominger had previously managed to win the race three times with a hattrick of triumphs between 1992-1994.

 Perez began the final stage, a 28.2-km time trial, 43 seconds behind Heras and powered through the Madrid streets, but could only slice 13 seconds off the lead. Francisco Mancebo finished second on the final stage, and third overall, to complete a Spanish sweep of the podium. Heras, who held on for fourth place in the final time trial, thanked his Liberty Seguros team for helping him add another victory to his titles in 2000 and 2003. 

 Berlin: Former Tour de France champion Jan Ullrich will not compete in the time trial at the world cycling championships on Wednesday in Verona because of a stomach problem. German team trainer Mario Kummer said on Monday he hoped that Ullrich, a twice world time trial champion, will be fit in time for the road race on Sunday. 

 Bucharest: Romanian gymnast Oana Ban, who won a team gold at last month?s Athens Olympics, has retired from competition, team coach Octavian Belu said on Monday. Ban, 18, qualified for the all-around and individual floor contests but did not compete because of injury. Her 19-year-old teammate Silvia Stroescu has also retired since the Games. 

 Athens: Four more athletes tested positive for banned substances at the Athens Paralympics and were disqualified. Three powerlifters from Estonia, Syria and Iran were disqualified, along with a cyclist from Slovakia. Ali Hosseini of Iran was stripped of his bronze medal in the under 60 kg class, and Cheikh Younes of Syria lost his bronze in the under 56 kg class. They were also banned for two years from competitions sanctioned by the IPC.

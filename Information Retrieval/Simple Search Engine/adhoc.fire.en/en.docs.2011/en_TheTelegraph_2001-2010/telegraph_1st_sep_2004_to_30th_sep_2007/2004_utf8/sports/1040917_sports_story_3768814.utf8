The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Reid doesn?t favour policy of rotation

 - ?Quicks must be honest about injuries? 

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI 

Birmingham: Being Southampton based in the English summer, one had expected to bump into Bruce Reid there ? after all, he is Hampshire?s bowling coach. That didn?t happen because, well, he was holidaying in France. 

?The vacation, with my wife (Sandra) and our three kids, had been planned months in advance and, so, I couldn?t avoid that,? Reid told The Telegraph, smiling, on Thursday morning. 

Back with Team India as part-time bowling coach, the Australian will be around till the Champions Trophy game against Pakistan, on Sunday, before flying off home (Perth). 

?A couple of days still remain (before the match) and I intend studying videos of the Pakistani batsmen... After that, I?m going to advise the boys,? he remarked. 

Reid, of course, is particularly pleased with young Irfan Pathan?s progress: ?It has been amazing... Now, he should get that extra half-yard of pace and, looking to the ODIs, I?m keen he develops the slower ball...? 

His first interaction with the Vadadora-based quick was during last season?s tour of Australia. That was Pathan?s maiden call-up and also Reid?s first exposure to the Indians as bowling coach. 

Reid informed that coach John Wright is ?very keen? on his going over to India later in the season, but nothing has been finalised. A trip during the Australians? visit there, though, is unlikely. 

Earlier, interacting with the Media the previous evening, Reid expressed concern over injuries to the quicks. 

?I believe players must be honest if they have a niggle... It?s better to take a break than risk playing on and being sidelined for long... 

?Personally, I?m not sure how a rotation policy will work ... I mean, if somebody is bowling well, how can you give him a break? But, yes, I accept the one-day game (specially) takes a lot out of the body,? he said. 

Talking about the Indian quicks? priority, Reid commented: ?They have to tighten up... At times, they are erratic... In this tournament, I hope they go the way they did in Australia ? loose to start with, very effective thereafter.? 

We hope so too.

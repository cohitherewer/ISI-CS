Calcutta: The scorecard will reveal Bangladesh ran India close in the first ODI in Chittagong, but Sourav Ganguly and John Wright are going to continue with the rotation-policy. 

And, so, Harbhajan Singh and Irfan Pathan are set to be rested in ODI No. 2, on Sunday, with their berths being taken by Murali Kartik and Zaheer Khan. 

Assuming both Kartik and Zaheer figure in the XI, the captain and coach will then be left trying to ?accommodate? Dinesh Mongia and bringing back Virender Sehwag. 

Sehwag and Zaheer, it may be recalled, were the two regulars rested in Chittagong. 

Incidentally, Ajit Agarkar and Joginder Sharma are the two specialist bowlers expected to be retained for Sunday. Sharma, of course, made his debut in the first ODI. 

?We?re sticking to our plan? I?m more or less sure about the bowlers to be rested/fielded? As for the batsmen, though, I haven?t yet spoken to Sachin (Tendulkar) or Rahul (Dravid) about possibly taking a break,? Sourav told The Telegraph on Friday evening. 

The captain was speaking from the team hotel (Sonargaon) in Dhaka. 

Clearly, no decision is going to be taken without ascertaining the top guns? views. That?s understandable. 

Sourav, by the way, confirmed he is himself playing on Sunday. However, it?s to be seen whether the captain figures in ODI No. 3, India?s last commitment in 2004. 

The second and third ODIs, both day-night games, will be back-to-back. 

Significantly, Sourav is 163 shy of becoming the third entrant (after Sachin and Inzamam-ul Haq) in the 10,000 runs? club. Also, he isn?t very far from completing 1,000 for the year. He has already done that five times. 

The Indians had a day off cricket, but a collective appearance was still made at a lunch hosted by our high commissioner in Bangladesh, Ms Veena Sikri. 

The invitees, according to manager Ramchandra Sudhakar Rao, included ?over a hundred? Indian families. 

Saturday?s nets, by the way, is going to be in the morning: Given the level of ?threat?, Sourav and Co. don?t need to train under floodlights.

 Rain plays spoilsport

 - Trescothick hits unbeaten 64 as England struggle 

Southampton: Opener Marcus Trescothick hit an unbeaten and streaky 64 to steer England to 118 for three before rain stopped play against Sri Lanka in the ICC Champions Trophy Pool D decider on Friday. 

The winners will take on world champions Australia in the semi-finals next week. Play was abandoned for the day and the two sides will return on Saturday to complete the match. 

Sri Lanka could have restricted England further in the 32 overs bowled if they had taken their catches, Mahela Jayawardene spilling an easy chance at slip when Andrew Flintoff, 21 batting at the break, was on one. 

Nuwan Zoysa and Sanath Jayasuriya also dropped catches in the deep off Trescothick and Andrew Strauss. 

Strauss was run out for seven soon after his escape, attempting to run two after tickling the ball to third man. 

Opener Vikram Solanki edged Farveez Mahroof behind for 18 after Maravan Atapattu chose to field first with menacing clouds. 

Michael Vaughan was bowled middle stump by Zoysa for five when he wandered across his stumps to leave England on 52 for two after 15 overs. 

Trescothick never seemed convincing. He received a reprieve thrice, including a faint outside edge to the ?keeper which umpire Billy Bowden failed to pick. 

First, when on nine, he mistimed a leg glance but Zoysa at mid off made a mess of a sitter. Then followed Bowden?s turning down for caught behind. Sangakkara then himself negated another appeal after he collected Trescothick?s weak prod on first bounce. 

Mahroof had a hand in the run out of Strauss as his throw from the third man was right on top of the stumps to beat the lefthander on the second run. That brought Flintoff to the crease. 

The new claimant to the world?s best allrounder crown was fortunate to be at the crease still after he was dropped on one by Jayawardene in the catching cordon. 

Flintoff then survived an appeal for stumping as Sangakkara whipped the bails off in a flash after the batsman was beaten by Upul Chandana. Bowden referred it to the third umpire and TV replays showed Flintoff had enough of his right foot on the batting crease to get the benefit of doubt.

New Delhi: The Dhyan Chand Stadium (formerly National Stadium) here continues to be a happy hunting ground for penalty corner specialist Sohail Abbas and the Pakistan team as well. 

When the arch-rivals last met here on February 4, 1999, Sohail, then a rookie in the squad scored twice and Pakistan won 4-3. Now after five years and eight months, Sohail again scored a brace to help Pakistan win their opening match of the Indian leg, 3-1. Pakistan now lead the eight-match Dosti series 3-1, with one match drawn. 

For Sohail, it was another achievement after his second goal. He equalled Dutch legend Paul Litjens? world record tally of 267 goals. 

India suffered a big blow when captain Dilip Tirkey was struck on the face, by a powerful rising drag flick by Sohail and had to be taken out to apply ice-pack treatment in the 64th minute. 

Assistant coach Jagbir Singh said that Dilip will be taken to hospital for an MRI test. Indian skipper may thus be ruled out of the remaining three Tests. Not only did Dilip get injured, it also led to a penalty stroke, which Sohail converted. 

Coach Gerhard Rach was also a victim of dehydration and humidity. He was administered sugar treatment during break by team doctor Joginder Singh. The pace of the game was also not fast due to the excessive heat and humidity. 

Tirkey has suffered no fracture, X-rays revealed, and can play in the remaining Tests. Abbas? shot first hit his wrist before ricocheting to his face and he was rushed to the hospital. 

Playing in the new 2-3-2-3 system, India?s attack lacked fluency and cohesion. Pakistan?s incisive passing, better control and greater variety in attack made them the better team on the day. 

The visitors controlled midfield with their timely interceptions and deservingly forged ahead in the 6th minute. Central midfielder Mudassar veered to the right and caught the Indian defence napping. His penetrative reverse pass was neatly converted by striker Kashif Jawad. 

Attacking midfielder Vikram Pillay was India?s most consistent performer. 

For Pakistan, Kashif and left winger Mohammed Shabbir were always threatening in breakaway moves. They earned two successive penalty corners just before the 30 minutes and Sohail converted the latter (Pakistan?s third) with a hard and high push into the net. 

In the second half, India piled on the pressure, with left half Ignace Tirkey initiating several moves. Pakistan goalkeeper Nasir Ahmed twice saved penalty corner attempts by Dilip Tirkey. 

Finally India got the reducer in the 50th minute, due to an error of judgement by the Pakistani goalie. Dilip sent a crisp diagonal from the left, which went to Michael. Nasir let the ball go but did not notice the lurking Michael, who finished without trouble. 

After the match Pakistan coach Roelant Oltmans said, ?this was our best performance in the Test series so far. We played more cohesive hockey than in the four tests in Pakistan.? The Dutch coach however added that he would continue to experiment as he was using the Test series as a build up for the forthcoming Champions Trophy in Lahore. 

Jagbir, on the other hand said, ?the pressure of expectations probably took its toll on India?s young team and they got a little stiff today.?

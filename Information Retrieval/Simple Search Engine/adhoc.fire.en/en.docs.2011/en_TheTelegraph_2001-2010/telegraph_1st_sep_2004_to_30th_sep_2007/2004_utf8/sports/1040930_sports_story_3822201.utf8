 Accuser may defy weight 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Champion trainers Daniel David and the Singh brothers ? Bharath and Vijay ? are expected to rule Thursday?s six-event card. But Bharath?s Accuser may steal the thunder in the star attraction of the afternoon, the 2,000m Monsoon Cup.

 Accuser, the monsoon Derby winner last year, may not have done anything of note in the winter but the Twist And Turn-Arisen colt has struck a purple patch now. His recent two wins were stamped with class, therefore, it may not come as a surprise if he defies the handicap and carries his topweight to victory in the hands of C. Alford.

 Alford may also guide Vijay?s Announcer and Almara to victory in their respective events ? the Mysore Race Club Cup and the Amazing Handicap, both 1,200m sprints. While Announcer badly needed his last run and could do better now, Almara is out to return to winning ways after her unfruitful but short stint in Bangalore. The Brave Hunter-Cool Tempo filly, in her maiden start, had conquered champion performers like Calorific and Bold Raider.Read as: Sl no, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

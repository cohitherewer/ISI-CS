 ECB asks team to stay in Johannesburg

Johannesburg: England were ordered to stay in South Africa rather than fly to Zimbabwe on Wednesday after the Harare government barred most British media from covering the five-match tour. 

In London, the British foreign office summoned the Zimbabwean charge d? affaires to express its ?deep concern? that the Harare government had denied access to British journalists. Team spokesman Andrew Walpole told reporters that England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) chairman David Morgan had instructed the team to stay in Johannesburg ?pending further discussions with the Zimbabwean authorities?. 

At a stopover at Johannesburg airport, England coach Duncan Fletcher and captain Michael Vaughan met Richard Bevan, chief executive of England?s Professional Cricketers? Association. Bevan said the England team would also meet Morgan, who is currently in Zimbabwe. It was unclear whether the team would fly to Harare on Thursday. 

The first of the five one-day Internationals is due to be played in Harare on Friday. 

?The likelihood is that David will stay in Zimbabwe but we are expecting (ECB director of cricket) John Carr to join us on Thursday,? Walpole said. 

The majority of British media organisations hoping to cover the tour, including the BBC, were told on Tuesday they had been denied accreditation by the Harare government. 

Earlier England asked the head of the ICC whether Zimbabwe?s decision to bar the media gave the ECB enough grounds to cancel the tour. ?The acting chief executive of the ECB, Hugh Morris, has emailed ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed and asked if the Zimbabwe government?s action constitutes an acceptable reason for non-compliance with the tour,? Walpole said. 

ICC president Ehsan Mani said: ?I?m very concerned and very disappointed. We are trying very hard to have this decision (by Zimbabwe) reversed. (REUTERS)

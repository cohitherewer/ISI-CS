The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Atwal-Bhalotia best 

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Arjun Atwal on Saturday showed the city?s golfing fraternity what went into making him India?s first pro on the US Tour. Atwal was in a scintillating form and stamped his class en route to lifting the four-ball title with Indrajit Bhalotia at the 175th year celebrations of the Royal Calcutta Golf Club, held in association with The Telegraph and, presented by Airtel. 

The two European title-holder set a blistering pace to be 7 under after 13 holes when the foursome match ended. Bhalotia also played some delightful shots but looked like a passenger all along. The winners pocketed the top cheque of Rs 50,000. The much-hyped duo of Rahil Gangjee and Shiv Kapur had to settle for the second position.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Rohan leads from front

 A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Captain Rohan Gavaskar led from the front with 80, but Bengal failed to capitalise on the captain?s knock, finishing the opening day against Gujarat at 278 for eight at Kanchenjungha Stadium in Siliguri on Thursday. 

According to information received here, all top-order batsmen did get a start, but failed to turn it into a big innings. Devang Gandhi (31 off 57 balls), Deep Dasgupta (27 off 108) and Laxmi Ratan Shukla (44 off 84) spent quite sometime in the middle, but were unable to carry on despite showing signs of big innings. 

Having won the toss, Gavaskar didn?t hesitate to bat first. Arindam Das, who scored a sparkling century against Karnataka, and Nikhil Haldipur gave the hosts a patient start. Arindam (20) was the first to depart with the scoreboard reading 25. Haldipur played a patient knock of 21 off 109 balls, but a miscommunication with Devang on the pitch resulted in his dismissal.

 Sourav stands tall amid ruins 

 India Senior?s Sourav Ganguly en route to his 65 on Day II of the match against India A in Bangalore on Wednesday 

Bangalore: Skipper Sourav Ganguly hit 65 but other frontline batsmen squandered a fine opportunity to get back among runs on the second day of the four-day practice game between India Senior and India A here on Wednesday. 

Replying to India A?s 302, India Senior were all out for 213, giving the rival team a first innings lead of 89. Ashish Nehra did not bat on the Day II because of a swollen ankle. 

Virender Sehwag?s batting woes continued as he made only six. The other batsmen ? Akash Chopra (18), Rahul Dravid (22), V.V.S. Laxman (14) and Yuvraj Singh (14) ? also failed to impress as Sourav-led team put up an unimpressive show at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium. 

The disappointing batting performance by senior batsmen ahead of the first Test against Australia commencing here on October 6, did raise doubts about the preparations of the team ahead of the series against the world champions. 

At stumps, Dinesh Mongia-led India A were 47 for the loss of the wicket of Gautam Gambhir (0), who was caught by Sourav off Zaheer Khan. Dheeraj Jadhav was batting on 27 and Mongia on 19 at close. 

Sourav, whose 104-ball knock had nine fours, stood among the ruins as the team?s much-touted batting line-up crumbled. 

M.S. Dhoni caught the eye on Wednesday, taking four catches behind the stumps ? that of Chopra, Laxman, Yuvraj and Parthiv Patel. The day also belonged to Joginder Sharma. The Haryana medium-pacer was drafted into the team on the second day, after Nehra hurt his ankle and could not play. 

Meanwhile, Sourav put the players on notice when he warned them not to take their place for granted. ?Options are open. Definitely, yes. We will probably have to reach the stage where we might pick those who are in form. That?s the key,? Sourav said after the day?s action. 

Asked if any good performance caught his attention in the ongoing practice match, he pointed to Sriram?s century as well as Sharma?s three-wicket haul. 

Sourav, however, pointed out that Zaheer has a ?very, very good chance? of playing in the upcoming Test series. 

?He (Zaheer) is back to where he was. He is back to his best. He is looking fit, running in and bowling in great areas. He has definitely a very, very good chance of playing in this series,? Sourav added.

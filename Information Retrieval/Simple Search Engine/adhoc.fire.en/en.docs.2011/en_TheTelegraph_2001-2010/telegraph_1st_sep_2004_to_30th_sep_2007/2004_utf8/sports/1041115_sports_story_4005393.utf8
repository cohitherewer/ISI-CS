Calcutta: The East Zone has, finally, come of age in the karting world. In the Calcutta leg of the fifth JK Tyre National Karting Championships here Sunday evening saw city boys and even a city girl, walk away with top honours in three of the four categories that were run. 

The senior category, though, was won by Rayomand Banajee, who at last made it to the New Delhi finals (in December) after several tries throughout this season in these championships, presented by General Motors and powered by Speed. 

The rest of the races, run at the Monte Carlo race track in Clown Town, were Calcutta affairs. 

The ladies started it all. Malini Chakravarty, daughter of veteran rallyist Mitil Chakravarty, was a clear winner from Dishali Patel. 

Malini won Rs 5,000 and a trophy. Patel won Rs 3,000, while third-placed Divya Malik earned Rs 2,000. 

The junior class (13-15 years) also showcased how well the city?s talents have come up. 

Chirag Malhotra, a year into his trials and tribulations, won the title and Rs 10,000. Malini was again in the picture, in this open event, finishing second and winning Rs 7,000. Johann Britto was third and won Rs 5,000. 

The cadet class brought more cheer to the city with Karan Goenka not only logging the fastest lap, but also clinching the title from Mohit Ahuja. 

Goenka won Rs 5,000, apart from the trophy. Ahuja won Rs 3,000. 

Akshay Maheswari wasn?t far behind in third place, winning Rs 2,000. 

Action moved to the senior category (over 16 years). Banajee had qualified from the semi-finals in first place and was tipped to win. The race overall wasn?t particularly fast, but the competition remained intense. 

The lead never really changed hands and Banajee looked the winner from start to finish. 

He even logged the best lap time of 25.59 seconds in wining the title. He won Rs 15,000 and a place in the finals. 

Sudarshan K. Rao was second (won Rs 10,000) and Kartik Shankar third (Rs 7,500). 

That does not mean the East Zone and the city will remain unrepresented in the senior category in the finals. Amittrajit Ghosh, who has also become an ace in the Formula Maturi class racing, has already qualified for the finals from the Bangalore leg.

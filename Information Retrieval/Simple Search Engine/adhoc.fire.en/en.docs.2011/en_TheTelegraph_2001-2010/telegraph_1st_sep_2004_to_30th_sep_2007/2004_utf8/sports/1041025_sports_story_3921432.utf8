Madrid: Marat Safin overpowered Argentina?s David Nalbandian 6-2, 6-4, 6-3 to win the Madrid Masters on Sunday. 

Safin dominated from the baseline throughout, with Nalbandian unable to live with the pace of his opponent?s ground strokes. 

The Russian third seed emerged from a run of three broken service games with a 3-1 lead and held with authority for 4-1 before taking the opening set in 29 minutes. 

Nalbandian, seeded fourth, made a backhand pass down the line to gain an early break in the second set but Safin hit back in game six, setting up break-point with a withering forehand crosscourt. 

Safin broke again in game 10 to move two sets ahead and coasted through the third to complete victory in one hour 52 minutes. 

On Saturday, in the semi-finals, Safin defeated Andre Agassi 6-3, 7-6 with a powerful performance that under- lined his recent return to top form. 

Safin dominated the game from the start, using his strong service and some daring baseline shots to peg back Agassi, who looked tense and tired after a three-set quarter-final bat- tle with Spain?s Tommy Robredo. 

?It?s a long time since I?ve played as well as that ? a really long time,? Safin said. 

?I knew Agassi would be a little tired after a long match yesterday (Friday), so I just concentrated on my serve. I?m really surprised I played so well from the baseline.? 

The number three seed broke the American six games in and easily held on to his lead to close out the set. 

Fourth seeded Nalbandian beat Croatia?s Ivan Ljubicic 6-4, 6-4 in the semis. 

Unseeded Ljubicic, whose quarter-final match on Friday lasted almost three hours, looked sluggish and over-reliant on a serve that was not enough to hold off Nalbandian.

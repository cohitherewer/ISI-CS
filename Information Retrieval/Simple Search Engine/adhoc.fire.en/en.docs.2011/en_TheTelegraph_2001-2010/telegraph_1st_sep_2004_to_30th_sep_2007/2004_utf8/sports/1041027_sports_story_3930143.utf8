Nagpur: Barely a few minutes after stumps were drawn on the opening day, John Buchanan and Adam Gilchrist walked up to have a first-hand look at the wicket. The turn of events had left the Australian thinktank hoping against hope that early life on the 22-yard strip sustains in the remainder of this third Test. It would mean encouraging news for Glenn McGrath and Co. and time for the Indians to stand up and face the challenge of the ?chin music? brigade. 

Whatever hopes the visitors might harbour, this track will get slower as the match progresses, making batting that wee bit easier. As was evident in the last session on Tuesday when Australia lost three quick wickets, the role of the spinners will once again gain importance. Murali Kartik and Anil Kumble have already shared five wickets between them. 

If Sachin Tendulkar?s inclusion came as a psychological boost for the side, it was quickly negated by the exit of Sourav Ganguly and Harbhajan Singh. Ricky Ponting must have heaved a huge sigh of relief after the duo?s unavailability was confirmed this morning. 

The hint of green on the wicket must have come as a welcome relief for the Indian bowlers after Adam Gilchrist won his third consecutive toss in the series. Even a change in captaincy did not alter the hosts? fortunes with the spin of the coin. It has now almost started to become a dreary practice for Justin Langer and Matthew Hayden to pile up a solid opening partnership after choosing to bat on the first morning of a Test match. 

The script almost unfolded in a familiar fashion until Zaheer Khan got Hayden to snick one to be caught behind, to nip the 67-run stand in the bud. However, as the ball moved around in the first session, edges flew thick and fast. Langer was his usual profligate self while Hayden, a bit subdued. 

Zaheer threatened to be lethal on this wicket. Once the change of ends was necessitated after his first spell, he had the Aussies running for cover. Hitting the deck and the corridor of uncertainty with alarming regularity, he got the ball to move and cut off the seam. The bounce was disturbing, too, as the batsmen struggled to keep him off. His second spell, during which he removed both the openers, read 6-1-22-2. 

Hayden?s departure was followed by Langer, whose attempted full blooded drive without getting in line ended in the hands of first slip. In the afternoon, Zaheer got the reverse swing to work in his favour, but as the moisture on the pitch had dried up, it became easier for the batsmen. 

It prompted the 148-run fourth wicket partnership in 186 balls between Damien Martyn and Darren Lehmann. Having rescued the side from 86 for three, the pair launched the perfect platform for the late-order to launch an all-out attack. 

Lehmann?s superb 70 is sure to raise fresh debate as to who will replace Ponting once the Australian captain declares himself fit for Mumbai. The lefthander?s torn right hamstring, suffered during his 129-minute stay at the wicket, may come as a welcome relief to the team management if he doesn?t recover in time. Having survived a difficult chance at gully off Zaheer early in the innings, he batted with authority and grit. Most of his ten boundaries had the hallmark of his resolve and determination. 

Martyn?s ninth hundred and the second successive against India once more brought to the fore his utility and importance to the side. Australia?s Mr Dependable, Martyn has been the glue with which the top-order has been held together. His last three centuries have been on the subcontinent, in the second innings and on rapidly deteriorating pitches. Highly commendable for someone who grew on the bouncy WACA in Perth and has often been accused of not handling the spinners with conviction. 

His 114 (165 balls, 16x4, 1x6) ensured that the Aussies never lost the momentum having scored at more than four runs an over. He timed the innings with consummate nerve, accelerated sweetly when the bowlers seemed to be holding sway. It was a controlled display, directing the tempo of the day?s play. 

After Lehmann?s departure, taken by surprise by the bounce on the wicket, Michael Clarke enthralled the gathering. On his second trip to India, he has already shown much promise with his footwork, selection of shots and temperament. Following his debut hundred in Bangalore, he has matured with every innings. His unbeaten 73, though, had two blemishes ? Parthiv Patel first missed a stumping off Kumble, and then an edge off Zaheer went past the outstretched wicketkeeper?s hands. 

Parthiv, after a disappointing show in Chennai, is 

under the scanner again and until he improves admirably, it will be tough for 

Sourav to continue backing him in the team.

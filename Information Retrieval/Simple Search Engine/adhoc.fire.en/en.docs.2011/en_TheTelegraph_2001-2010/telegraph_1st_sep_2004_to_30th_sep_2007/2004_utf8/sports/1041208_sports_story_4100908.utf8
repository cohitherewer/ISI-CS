The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Harmison now targets Graeme Smith and Co.

Johannesburg: Steve Harmison hopes to pick up where he left off when South Africa and England clash in the first Test in Port Elizabeth on December 17. The lanky fast bowler finally made his mark when he took four wickets in South Africa?s second innings in the last Test at The Oval in 2003 to help England win the match and square the series. 

?It was massive, from that game onwards I felt I could play at this level,? Harmison told a news conference on Tuesday. ?It was make or break at The Oval, that changed everything for me.? 

Harmison, 26, has since risen through the ranks to become Test cricket?s top-rated fast bowler but remains modest about the title ahead of the five-Test series. 

?It?s not something I?m going to shout from the rooftops,? Harmison said. ?I can?t see Graeme Smith being too fearful about that when I?m running in to bowl in Port Elizabeth. Batsmen are still going to hit a 98 mile-an-hour half-volley for four.? 

Despite his honesty, Harmison is keen to show South Africa just how far he had progressed since they last faced him. ?The West Indies and New Zealand have seen the best of me,? he said, recalling his excellent displays which helped England to 10 Test wins out of 11 so far in 2004. 

?South Africa haven?t, but I hope they will on this tour.? 

Harmison withdrew from England?s tour to Zimbabwe on moral grounds and believes the break has primed him for the series in South Africa.

 Pakistan, Holland win big

 Pakistan?s Shabbir Hussain tries to get past Germany?s Michael Purps in the Champions Trophy match on Saturday 

Lahore: Defending champions Holland started their title defence in style, trouncing New Zealand 5-2 in the inaugural match of the Champions Trophy hockey tournament. 

Holland, seeking to win their third Champions Trophy title in a row, rode on a double strike by Taeke Taekema and a goal each by Ronald Brouwer, Rob Reckers and Karel Claver. 

Holland took the lead in the 26th minute, Taekama converting a penalty corner. But the Dutch joy was shortlived as New Zealand equalised just three minutes on through Bevan Hari. 

Brouwer struck in the 31st minute to give his side the lead as the teams went to the breather with a 2-1 lead. 

Bevan came to New Zealand?s rescue, finding the target in the 42nd minute to restore parity. But the defending champions surged ahead through Reckers in the 44th minute. Goals by Taekema and Claver in the 50th and 60th minute ensured that the Dutch collected full points from the match. 

Meanwhile, hosts Pakistan warded off a spirited challenge from Germany to register a 3-1 win in their opening match of the Champions Trophy. 

Egged on by thousands of supporters, the hosts got the better of the Germans after Sohail Abbas (34rd), Shaqeel Abbasi (52nd) and Kashif Jawad (64th) sounded the board at the National Hockey Stadium. 

Germany?s lone goal came through Montag Jan-Marco who scored five minutes into the second half. 

The visitors, who entered the event without several of their key players, put up a tough fight to deny Pakistan any leeway in the early part of the match before Sohail?s goal just before the half-time opened them up. 

Infact, the Olympic bronze medallists made some good moves and even came close to taking the lead, but failed. 

Sohail, world?s leading goalscorer, gave the side the lead with his trademark drag flick, but that setback failed to dampen the morale of the Germans. 

They came back from the break with determination and restored parity four minutes after the break with Jan-Marco scoring from a penalty corner. 

But Pakistan shut the door on the Germans as they scored twice in 10 minutes, Abbasi deflecting in a sharp shot from Sohail and Jawad converting a penalty corner. 

In Sunday?s matches, Germany play Spain, Pakistan take on New Zealand and Holland play India.

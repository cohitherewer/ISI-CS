 Pakistan get warm welcome

New Delhi: The Pakistani hockey team was accorded a warm welcome upon its arrival here on Saturday for the return leg of the Test series, revived after a gap of five years. 

The visiting players, soon after they came out of the IGI Airport alongwith the Indian team, were greeted by cheers from a handful of people waiting there to have a glimpse of the hockey stars from both nations. 

The IHF officials were also present to receive the Pakistan contingent that included the four Olympians, who would be honoured during the series.

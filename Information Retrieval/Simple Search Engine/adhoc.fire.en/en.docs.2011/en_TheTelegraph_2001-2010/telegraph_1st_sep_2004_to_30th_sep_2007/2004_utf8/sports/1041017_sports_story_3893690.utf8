 Pain is much less, says Sachin

Mumbai: Sachin Tendulkar said on Saturday that the pain in his left elbow has subsided considerably and that he was ?very hopeful? of playing in the third cricket Test against Australia starting in Nagpur on October 26. 

?I saw Dr Anant Joshi (cricket board-appointed sports medicine expert) yesterday. It?s much better now. The pain has gone down considerably and am very hopeful of playing in the next Test,? Sachin said. 

Asked when he intended to start practising, the ace batsman said: ?In three or four days. I have been practising indoors with tennis balls.? 

The champion batsman said he has been following a rehabilitation programme chalked out for him. 

?I have been following a programme that I have been given by physio Andrew Leipus and the trainer (Gregory King). That has helped in strengthening the muscles,? Sachin added. 

Meanwhile, Sachin is all set to expand his restaurant business with another venture ? a ?sport?s caf?? named Sachin?s. 

The ace batsman, who owns a restaurant in south Mumbai, a stone?s throw away from the Gateway of India and named ?Tendulkar?s?, said he was launching the new cafe in the suburb of Mulund in north Mumbai. (PTI)

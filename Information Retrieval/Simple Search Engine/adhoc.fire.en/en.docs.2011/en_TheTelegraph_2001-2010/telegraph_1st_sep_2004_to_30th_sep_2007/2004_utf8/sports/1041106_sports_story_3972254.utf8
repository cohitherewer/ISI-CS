The Telegraph - Calcutta

It would have been different with Warne in 

Guest Column

Ajit Wadekar

Not much should be read into this Indian victory. 

Don?t get flattered by the ?heroics? of our players, because this triumph at the 

Wankhede should not to be taken too seriously. 

A Test match over in a two-and-a-quarter days! This 

is no way to prepare a wicket, for it does great injustice to the game and the 

paying public. This is just absurd; simply not done in any form of the game.

The situation would have been very different had Shane 

Warne played in this Test. The leg-spinner would surely have got more than ten 

wickets in this match and an Australian victory wasn?t impossible in such a scenario.

In the absence of Warne, India won, because they were 

better suited to bowling on such wickets. You need to bowl flatter and pitch on 

the right areas and the Indians reaped the benefits of doing just that.

Murali Kartik made full use of the conditions while 

bowling to a plan. Harbhajan could have bowled much better had he been a little 

more flatter. Anil Kumble was his usual self and was unlucky not to have got a 

few more wickets.

The nature of the wickets seems to have taken centrestage 

in the last two Tests of the series. Nagpur shouldn?t have happened, and instead, 

we should have prepared a flat wicket to suit our batsmen. Batting is our strength 

and we should always play to our strength.

It was really unfortunate to see the mainline top-order 

batsmen fall victim to either bad form or injuries during this series. The Sachin 

injury also came at the wrong time and it was unfair to expect him to score runs 

without match practice.

India?s success over the last couple of years has 

been mainly due to their batsmen, and a collective failure is bound to tell heavily 

on the team?s performance.

Even the bowlers weren?t spared through injuries. 

Zaheer is still making a comeback to peak form, Irfan and Harbhajan have also 

missed Test matches and we were at no time at our very best.

Moreover, persisting with Parthiv Patel for too long 

didn?t help the team?s cause. We should have tried Dinesh Karthik much earlier.

That we managed to win the fourth Test was because 

our batsmen came good in the second innings. Laxman batted sensibly and aggressively 

and Sachin was also not to be left behind. We should have showed a little more 

aggro in the first innings, too. 

One reason why Sachin had been successful against 

them in the past was because he went after the bowling from the outset. They didn?t 

know where to pitch the ball in the face of the onslaught. Had he employed the 

same tactics in the first innings too, we could have ended with a lead.

Somehow I get the feeling that India are on the downside 

of their performance cycle. Every team goes through it, except Australia. The 

reason is simple ? we never try to develop our second line. For this, participation 

of our stars in domestic cricket is a necessity and only that can improve our 

bench strength.The Australians encourage youngsters at the right time, Michael 

Clarke being the find of this series. This breeding of youngsters made all the 

difference.

 Plan to block Ecclestone move

 Bernie Ecclestone 

London: British Grand Prix organisers will stage an emergency meeting Thursday aimed at blocking Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone?s plans to scrap the race. 

The absence of a British race in the 2005 calendar ? a strong likelihood according to Ecclestone ? would be ?a severe body blow to the sport?, British Racing Drivers? Club president Jackie Stewart said Wednesday. 

Ecclestone has finally lost his patience with Silverstone?s owners after the 73-year-old tycoon repeatedly failed to reach an agreement over financial terms or the length of the BRDC?s commitment to the race. 

He said another unnamed country had been lined up to take the place of Britain ? which staged the first Grand Prix in 1950 ? in the calendar. 

But Stewart, a former three-time F1 champion driver and team owner, is still hopeful Ecclestone can be persuaded to relent. 

?Mr Ecclestone?s unilateral decision to cancel the Grand Prix is bad news for Britain,? Stewart said Wednesday.

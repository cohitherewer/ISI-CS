 London: Manchester United on Tuesday confirmed to the stock exchange that they had paid a fee of up to 1.5 million to football agent Paul Stretford for organising the transfer of Wayne Rooney from Everton. The payment is believed to be the biggest ever paid to an agent in English football and will inevitably fuel concern over what many regard as the undue influence agents have over player movements and the excessive amounts they earn from their role as intermediaries.

 Stretfords company, formation group, was guaranteed an initial payment of one million pounds with a further 500,000 contingent on Rooney seeing out the six-year contract he has signed at United. The statement also broke down the payments Everton will receive, which could total up to 27 million. United paid 10 million immediately and will make an identical payment on August 1, 2005. Everton will receive a further 3 million if Rooney remains a United player in three years time and will be entitled to 25 per cent of any profit from a resale.

 London: Birmingham City have completed the signing of Trinidad and Tobago striker Dwight Yorke from Blackburn Rovers for an undisclosed fee, the English Premier League club said on its website on Wednesday.

 The 32-year-old signed a one-year deal with a further years option just minutes before Tuesdays midnight deadline for the European summer transfer window.

 Scottish champions Celtic were reported to be interested in the striker but he opted to remain in England.

 Mumbai: Second seed Karan Rastogi of India rallied to beat Vander dum Antal of The Netherlands 3-6, 6-1, 6-1 and move into the third round of the Canadian Open junior tennis championship. 

 According to information received here on Tuesday, Rastogi, who is suffering from a stiff shoulder, struggled with his first serve. However, as the match progressed, he picked up his game and took the last two sets quite comfortably.

 To avoid further risk to his shoulder, the Indian junior has withdrawn from the doubles event where he and his Chinese Taipei partner Yi Chu-huan were the top seeds.

 Jerusalem: Amos Mansdorf, the captain of Israels Davis Cup team for the past four years, has stepped down, the Israel Tennis Association said. 

 Mansdorf asked to be relieved of the position because of the pressures of personal commitments, the association said in a statement. Israel play in the Euro/Africa Zone Group 1 division.

 Mansdorf was Israels best-ever male player and won six major ATP titles during his 11-year professional career. The association said team coach Oded Yaacov would replace Mansdorf for the tie against Finland in Tel Aviv later this month but a permanent captain would be named at a later date. 

 Moscow: Russias Olympic shot put champion Irina Korzhanenko, stripped of her gold medal after a drugs test, said on Tuesday she was determined to keep her medal because she was innocent. For me to give the medal back would mean to betray myself, to admit my guilt, but I consider myself innocent, Korzhanenko was quoted as saying by Russian media. The 30-year-old, who won the first athletics gold of the Games at Ancient Olympia, tested positive for the steroid stanozolol. I didnt steal this medal, I honestly earned it, she said. 

 London: Englands rugby World Cup-winning coach Clive Woodward resigned on Wednesday with immediate effect after seven years in charge of the national team, Sky Sports News reported. Woodward, who masterminded Englands 20-17 victory over hosts Australia in last years World Cup final, met with English Rugby Football Union (RFU) chief executive Francis Baron on Wednesday morning to discuss media speculation that he was planning an unprecedented move into football.

 He announced his resignation outside the RFUs Twickenham headquarters later in the day. Woodward, who wanted to play for top-flight club Everton as a boy, is reportedly keen to get fast-tracked into a role with the England football team before making a bid to succeed Sven-Goran Eriksson as manager after the 2006 World Cup finals.

 Crans-Sur-Sierre (Switzerland): World No. 3 Ernie Els says he feels a failure after narrowly missing out on three of the years four major championships. The big South African has set himself a fitness goal to try to add to his career tally of three Majors. Speaking on Wednesday before defending his European Masters title, Els, second in the US Masters and British Open and fourth in the US PGA Championship, agreed he felt deflated.

 Els three-putted the 72nd hole and missed out on a playoff for the US PGA title won by Vijai Singh last month. He lost a playoff to Todd Hamilton for the British Open in July, having finished runner-up to Phil Mickelson in the Masters after leading the American going into the last nine holes.

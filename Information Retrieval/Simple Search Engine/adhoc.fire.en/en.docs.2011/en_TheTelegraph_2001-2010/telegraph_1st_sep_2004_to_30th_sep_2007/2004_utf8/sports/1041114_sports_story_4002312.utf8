The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Former skippers touched

 - PLATINUM JUBILEE CELEBRATIONS l BCCI gesture draws allround praise 

NILESH BHATTACHARYA AND SANJIB GUHA

Calcutta: For Nari Contractor, it was an occasion to meet his ?friends and foes.? For Intikhab Alam, it rekindled his past and his final bow on Indian soil way back in 1961. 

As a galaxy of legends from India and Pakistan descended at Eden Gardens, to be part of a felicitation ceremony, accorded to them by the BCCI as part of its Platinum Jubilee one-off one-day International in the city on Saturday, emotions ran deep into their hearts. 

During the break, a packed Eden saw legendary Indian and Pakistani skippers ? Imtiaz Ahmed, Hanif Mohammed, Nari Contractor, Chandu Borde, Intikhab Alam, S. Venkatraghavan, Bishan Singh Bedi, Gundappa Viswanath, Ajit Wadekar, Zaheer Abbas, Imran Khan, Dilip Vengsarkar, Kapil Dev, Rameez Raja, Ravi Shastri and Waqar Younis ? being feted according to their seniority. Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid and Inzamam-ul Haq were also honoured on the occasion. 

The Union sports minister Sunil Dutt handed over a memento, embossed with BCCI insignia on a silver salver, a tie and an exquisitely-handcrafted Kashmiri shawl to the celebrities. 

INDIAN LEGENDS 

Bishan Singh Bedi: The fact I could get to meet so many of my friends from across the border has made the occasion special to me. A really good and moving gesture from the BCCI. 

Nari Contractor: It?s a great honour. Wonderful to see the BCCI helping all to come together on a single dais. My reaction to this move cannot be anything other than saying that I?m touched. 

After coming here, I feel like past memories resurfacing and embracing me. What is more moving is perhaps the fact that I?ve got a chance to meet my friends and foes once again. 

Kapil Dev: Are you expecting me to say I?m not feeling great? (Laughing) You better not. I?ve been honoured elsewhere also, but this is special. Because a number of greats from India and Pakistan are involved here. Kudos to the Board for such a gesture. 

Ravi Shastri: I?m grateful to the BCCI for inviting me and making me a part of the occasion. I?ve never had such a gesture from anybody. I?m touched and honoured. 

S. Venkatraghavan: This is something that makes you not only happy and honoured, but gives kind of a feeling that here, you?ve got an opportunity to meet so many greats of the two neighbouring nations. Such a meeting is rare and therefore, has to be cherished. 

Ajit Wadekar: A wonderful gesture from BCCI. And what a gathering! It?s only because of such an occasion, I was able to get to meet Hanif, Rameez, Intikhab, Imran and our boys like Bedi, Contractor and Dilip. A moving experience. What turned out to be a double delight is the fact that all this is part of an India-Pakistan match. A match which is as good as the Ashes. Or may be more since so much sentiments are attached to such clash. 

PAKISTAN LEGENDS 

Intikhab Alam: Never got such an honour. What the BCCI has done to us is absolutely fantastic and moving. This has come at a time when I?m coaching in India. There have never been any dearth of talent here. 

It?s as if the Eden has turned the clock back for me. I can still remember I had hit a fifty-plus and took three wickets in a Test match in Calcutta way back in 1961. That?s my last Test on Indian soil. 

Imran Khan: It?s a wonderful experience. Being part of a felicitation and that too in front of such a huge gathering is something unforgettable. 

Rameez Raja: Nothing can be a better stage for being felicitated on such an occasion than this. No doubt the BCCI has done a great thing. It also gave an opportunity to meet my friends, keeping our egos aside. 

Waqar Younis: An occasion worth remembering and cherish in life. A match between Pakistan and India at the backdrop and a meeting with so many legends? you can?t ask more than this.

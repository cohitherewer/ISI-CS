Calcutta: Former India Davis Cup captain Jaidip Mukerjea has agreed to be an honorary life member of the Cricket Club of India (CCI). The CCI body had passed a resolution to offer the former international this membership and Mukerjea has already indicated his willingness for the same. The formal handing over of the membership will be on December 14 at the CCI, Mumbai. 

?Mukerjea is the latest addition on the list of renowned tennis players on our membership roll,? CCI chief executive R.N. Renjen told The Telegraph from Mumbai on Monday. 

?Naresh Kumar, Ramanathan Krishnan, Leander Paes, Mahesh Bhupathi are among others already with life memberships of our club,? Renjen added. 

According to him, the list of honorary life members outside cricket, also includes badminton player Nandu Natekar. 

?I am really honoured after Mr Raj Singh Dungarpur sent the letter inviting my wife (Sharmin) and myself for the official function in Mumbai on December 14,? Mukerjea said. Dungarpur is the president of the club. 

The letter from Dungarpur ?Welcome to the CCI family?, says that Mukerjea has been added to the list of celebrities for his contribution to the game as a player, coach and an administrator as well. 

Mukerjea also won the lifetime achievement award from the International Tennis Federation (ITF) in 2002. ?The ITF honour was given to me by my own fraternity. This membership is a special one in the sense that I am getting a recognition from outside the fraternity of tennis,? he said. 

Mukerjea also spoke to Dungarpur over telephone when the CCI president was in the city during the India-Pakistan ODI to commemorate the Board of Control for Cricket in India?s (BCCI?s) Platinum Jubilee. 

Mukerjea is expected to leave for Mumbai on December 12.

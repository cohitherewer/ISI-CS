 European clubs give nod

London: Europe?s top clubs have withdrawn their opposition to Fifa?s new-look Club World Championship and agreed to play in the six-club tournament. 

Fifa announced early this year that the annual championship would start in December 2005 with all six confederations sending their champion club to Tokyo. The G-14 group of top European clubs immediately announced their strong opposition to the idea which, it said, ran against the clubs policy of trying to ease the workload on players. 

Uefa, European soccer?s ruling body, said Friday its 102-strong European Club Forum had agreed to the championship although the team concerned would not necessarily be the winners of the Champions League. (Reuters)

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Inzy accepts blame for top-flight miss

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Southampton: With Inzamam-ul-Haq deciding to bat on a Rose Bowl wicket which wasn?t exactly inviting, the Asian challenge in the Champions Trophy ended rather quickly on Wednesday. 

Saturday?s final, therefore, will pit hosts England and the West Indies. 

After dismissing Pakistan for a paltry 131 in under 39 overs, the West Indies got the runs in just over 28 (losing three wickets), with MoM Ramnaresh Sarwan not out on an excellent 56. 

Of course, had captain Brian Lara not taken a Shoaib Akhtar bouncer in the neck region, he would himself have probably been there at the early finish. 

Lara didn?t attend the customary post-match Media conference and The Telegraph learns he is going to undergo an MRI either late in the evening in Portsmouth or in London on Thursday. 

Significantly, though it was a ?team decision? to bat, Inzamam took the rap. ?I?m the captain and must accept responsibility,? he said, adding: ?I don?t know what went wrong with our batting...? 

For good measure, Inzamam insisted his boys hadn?t become complacent after putting India out on Sunday. And, indirectly, he suggested the team wasn?t happy with third umpire David Shepherd?s decision on Abdul Razzaq?s run out. 

In any case, Shepherd isn?t the most popular umpire in the Pakistani dressing room.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Railways ahead by 230 runs

 Shukla hit an unbeaten 90 

New Delhi: J. P. Yadav followed up his masterly 93 with a five-wicket haul as Railways skittled out Bengal for 255 in the first innings on the third day of the Ranji Trophy Elite Group A match on Thursday. 

The home side, which took a first innings lead of 93 runs, swelled it further reaching 137 for four in their second innings at stumps at Karnail Singh Stadium. 

With six wickets still standing, Railways were 230 runs ahead. Although they are assured of two points, the hosts were hoping to set a target to Bengal on the fourth and final day on Friday in a bid to secure an outright win. 

?We will be batting for sometime and give them a target of around 300 runs. With the pitch offering assistance to bowlers, anything is possible,? Railways coach Vinod Sharma said after the day?s play. 

Railways? bid to effect the declaration on this day itself did not materialise in the face of some disciplined bowling by the visitors. 

Moreover, even though play was extended by half an hour, the scheduled 90 overs could not be completed. 

?The nine overs that could not be bowled could have helped us pile some more runs. Also Bengal bowled a very good line on the track on which scoring is difficult,? Sharma said. 

At close, opener Amit Pagnis, who showed good resilience, was unbeaten on 62 and Raja Ali on 11. 

Earlier, allrounder Laxmi Ratan Shukla was stranded on 90 as Bengal, resuming at 153 for four, were all out for 255 in 102 overs. 

Skipper Rohan Gavaskar fell in the second over of the day without adding anything to his overnight score of 24. Gavaskar was bowled by medium pacer Santosh Saxena (three for 32). 

Sanjib Sanyal made just four and was castled by captain Sanjay Bangar. Yadav then wrecked the lower order to return with impressive figures of five for 37 in 27 overs. 

The lower order contributed too little to Bengal?s cause and barring Sourashish Lahiri (10), none of the last five batsmen could reach double figures. 

Murtaza Lodhgar made nine and both Sabir Ali and Ranadeb Bose failed to open their account. 

Railways had a shaky start as Bangar, as in the first innings, was dismissed cheaply by Sabir Ali. The opener faced 20 balls for his two before edging to wicketkeeper Deep Dasgupta when the team?s score was seven. 

Tejinder Pal Singh made an attractive 45, studded with five fours, and steadied the innings with a 90 run stand with Pagnis. 

When Devang Gandhi ran Tejinder Pal out, Railways lost couple of more wickets in quick succession to slump from 97 for one to 122 for four. 

Yadav (5) missed the line completely to be bowled by Sanyal for five and Siddharth Verma (0) mistimed a sweep shot to be caught by Nikhil Haldipur off Lodhgar.

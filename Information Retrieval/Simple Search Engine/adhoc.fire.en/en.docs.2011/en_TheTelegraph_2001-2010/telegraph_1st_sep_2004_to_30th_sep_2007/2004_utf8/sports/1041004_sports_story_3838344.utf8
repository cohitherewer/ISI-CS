New Delhi: History will be made in more ways than one when the India-leg of the hockey series with Pakistan commences at the Dhyan Chand Stadium on Monday. 

The sixth series between the two nations (first of the millennium) will see foreign coaches in charge of both teams for the first time. Portly 56-year-old German Gerhard Rach is in charge of India since the Olympics and Dutchman Roelant Oltmans has been with Pakistan for a year. 

Another first will see two channels ? ESPN and Doordarshan ? beaming the action live. 

It is being called the ?Dosti? series, but neither side will leave any stone unturned to emerge victors. Both India and Pakistan desperately need to win every match to improve their declining status in world hockey. 

Rach expressed satisfaction with the Indians? performance in the four Tests in Pakistan. India lost the series 1-2, but improved with each game to finish with a 4-4 draw. ?My team is my star. Earlier, there were superstars in the team but the biggest gain of the tour is that we played as a team.? 

The German refused to single out any player for praise, but observed that newcomers Tushar Khandekar and Vivek Gupta adjusted well and that Viren Rasquinha and Vikram Pillay carried out their attacking roles with consistency. Another gain from the tour, according to Rach, is penalty corner expert Sandeep Singh?s regaining confidence. 

The Indians now play the 2-3-2-3 system with Rasquinha and Vikram as attacking midfielders or supporting the three-man attack. The new-look forwardline consists of Khandekar, recalled Bangalore forward Sandeep Michael and Arjun Halappa. 

The three defensive midfielders are Sandeep Singh (on right), Dehra Dun-based newcomer Vivek Gupta (centre-half) and Ignace Tirkey on the left. Dilip Tirkey and William Xalco are the defenders and Adrian D?Souza is the first choice goalkeeper. 

According to Rasquinha, the players have already adjusted to the new system, which requires constant mobility and running off the ball. The Indian team has impressed Oltmans too. He expects a tough ?away? series and doesn?t want to go into any prediction. 

Rach said the outcome of the Delhi Test, as well as the other matches (Chandigarh on Wednesday, Amritsar on Friday and Hyderabad on Sunday), will depend on how India cope with Pakistan?s speedy wingers Rehan Butt, Shabbir Ahmed and striker Kashif Jawad. 

Skipper Wasim Ahmed is their main playmaker, but India?s biggest threat will undoubtedly be penalty corner king Sohail Abbas. A relative newcomer in the squad when the last series was held in 1999, Abbas needs three more goals to equal Dutch legend Paul Litjens? world record tally of 267. 

Oltmans felt he has managed to improve Pakistan?s strategical play, as well as their discipline and fitness. 

It will be Oltmans? last international engagement with Pakistan. He will return home in December to take over as chief coach of the Dutch national team. Oltmans? first stint with the Dutch side had resulted in gold medals in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and the 1998 World Cup. 

Monday?s match will start at 1.30 pm, the early start due to prime time problems on the DD national channel. 

For the statistically minded, Pakistan have won four of the six series and India one. Of the 42 Test matches, Pakistan hold a 20-14 edge with eight having been drawn.

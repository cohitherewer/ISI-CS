 Gambhir, Dravid smash barriers

 - Indians set for huge total again, this time in Chittagong 

 Gautam Gambhir hits a boundary en route to his 139 against Bangladesh on Day I of the second Test in Chittagong on Friday 

Chittagong: India put themselves in a commanding position after centuries from Gautam Gambhir and Rahul Dravid ensured the visitors another huge total against Bangladesh in the second and final Test here Friday. 

Left-handed opener Gambhir (139) cracked his maiden Test hundred and the Indian vice-captain Dravid his 18 th. Dravid thus became the first batsman ever to score centuries in all ten Test playing countries as India reached 334 for two at close of Day I. 

Dravid was unbeaten on 145 with Sachin Tendulkar 36 batting at the other end at close on the opening day, but it was Gambhir?s rollicking innings that put the team on a roll after Sourav Ganguly elected to bat on a pitch that looked firm enough. 

While the Indians made merry with their top order batsmen feasting on the easy-paced track at the M. A. Aziz Stadium, it turned out to be a day of hard toil for the hosts. 

Dravid?s century also meant that he surpassed Dilip Vengsarkar (17 centuries) to perch himself on the fourth place in the list of most century makers for India. Sachin Tendulkar, Sunil Gavaskar (both 34) and Mohammad Azharuddin (22) top the charts. 

Gambhir slammed 19 fours during his 196-ball knock that compensated for his cheap dismissal in the first Test when he was run out after a mix up with Sachin Tendulkar in Dhaka. 

His opening partner Virender Sehwag was the only batsman to miss out on the party when he edged Mashrafee Murtaza to Habibul Bashar at first slip in the fifth over of the innings. 

But Gambhir?s unrestrained shot-making quickly took this initiative away from the hosts and his partnership for the second wicket with Dravid, worth 223 runs from 346 balls, negated Bangladesh?s early advantage. 

Dravid was content to allow his younger partner enjoy the limelight but smoothly accelerated to his 18 th hundred with 14 fours from 196 balls and 226 minutes. 

The Delhi batsman reached his 50 with a boundary to point fence from 60 balls with 10 fours and kept playing his strokes without inhibitions. 

The left-hander was severe on Rafique whom he repeatedly drove through the on side. Gambhir, who had got out on 96 against South Africa in Kanpur earlier this season, was not to be denied on this day. A single to mid off gave his first Test hundred and the youngster celebrated with some fist pumping. 

The century helped Dravid break a bad patch and gave him his first century this season in eight Tests. 

Tendulkar, who scored his record 34 th century in Dhaka, seemed to continue from where he left off as he struck six fours to race to 36 from 54 balls. 

The run rate hovered around four throughout the day and probably dipped a bit after the dismissal of Gambhir.

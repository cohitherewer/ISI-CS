 Nawab grabs Day I honours

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Jamshedpur: Little-known Mohammed Nawab surged into the lead with a career-best seven under 63 in the opening round of the Rs 15 lakh Amby Valley PGAI Tour Tata Open 2004 at the Beldih amp; Golmuri Golf Courses on Tuesday. 

Nawab?s achievement came at the par-70 Golmuri course, which also was the scene of Chandigarh?s Amritinder Singh hitting his 16th career hole-in-one. 

Delhi?s Shiv Kapur fired a six-under 64 at Golmuri to settle at second place, one stroke better than fellow-Delhi golfer and Tour leader Ashok Kumar, who shot a five-under 65 to occupy the third position. 

At Beldih, the lowest cards of the day were returned by Delhi?s Ali Sher, Kanpur?s Shiv Prakash and Bangalore?s C. Muniyappa, all three shooting a four-under 68. 

Asian Games gold medallist Shiv along with Ashok was the centre of attraction. Shiv, much like Ashok did not disappoint. 

The 22 year old rookie dropped a shot on the second where he two putted from six feet. 

Thereafter, the golfer let loose a string of birdies on the third, fifth, eighth, tenth, 11th, 12th, 16th and 17th and would have tied for the lead but for an unfortunate bogey on the18th. 

Shiv?s childhood rival, 23-year old Ashok had six birdies studding his card, with one bogey. 

Navtez Singh, meanwhile, shot a three-over 73 at Golmuri to assume a one-stroke lead among the amateurs at Beldih. Karun Taunk was second with a four-over 76 .

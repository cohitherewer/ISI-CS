 Sri Lanka race past Zimbabwe

 - TRI-SERIES - We are taking two steps forward and one step backward, says Simmons

Rawalpindi: Sri Lanka crushed Zimbabwe by seven wickets to virtually guarantee their berth in the tri-series final against hosts Pakistan. 

The Sri Lankans skittled the Zimbabweans out for 104 and then raced to 108 for three in 18 overs to leave the Africans needing a miracle to make the October 16 final. 

Zimbabwe, who have just one point from three matches, now must pull off an unlikely victory with a bonus point against Sri Lanka on Monday. They must also hope Pakistan beat Sri Lanka with a bonus point when the two teams meet in their last league match in Lahore on October 14. 

Sri Lanka, beginning their innings in the first session itself, notched up 56 for one by lunch, losing Saman Jayantha for 21. 

After the interval, Sanath Jayasuriya hit Elton Chigumbura for a six and two boundaries before the Zimbabwean got his revenge by castling the opener off the fourth delivery of that over for 40. 

Tillekeratne Dilshan hit the winning boundary to finish 26 not out. 

Earlier Sri Lanka?s four-pronged pace attack shared seven wickets while leg-spinner Upul Chandana returned with best figures of three for 15 as Zimbabwe collapsed crumbled in 33 overs. 

Stuart Matsikenyeri (37) and Dion Ebrahim (24 not out) offered some resistance in an otherwise disappointing batting display. Zimbabwe lost their last nine wickets for just 50 runs in windy conditions. 

Nuwan Zoysa forced an edge from opener Brendon Taylor for wicketkeeper Kumar Sangakkara to take a straightforward catch in the fourth over. Taylor?s opening partner Matsikenyeri hit seven boundaries in his rapid 37 to take his team past 50. 

But first-change pacer Farveez Mahroof struck twice (Matsikenyeri and Vusimuzi Sibanda) within the space of one run to trigger the collapse. 

Ebrahim, who watched wickets falling like nine pins at the other end, added 17 for the fourth wicket with Mark Vermeulen before Dilhara Fernando dimissed the latter with a slower delivery. 

Spearhead Chamida Vaas returned for his second spell to dismiss skipper Tatenda Taibu for nought and Mluleki Nkala in successive overs. 

Chandana matched Vaas? double strike with the wickets of Elton Chigumbura and Tinashe Panyangara to leave Zimbabwe reeling at 84 for eight. 

Ebrahim took them past the 100-mark before Chandana wrapped up the innings by dismissing Edward Rainsford. 

Pakistan, who have beaten Zimbabwe twice and Sri Lanka once in this series, have already qualified for the final. 

?We played terribly today,? Zimbabwe coach Phil Simmons said. ?We are taking two steps forward and one step backward. 

?We give a good performance in one match, get complacent and undo the good work,? he said.

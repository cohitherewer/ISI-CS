Dhaka: New Zealand rode fast bowler James Franklin?s hattrick to seize the initiative on the second day of the opening Test against Bangladesh here on Wednesday. The hosts were bowled out for 177 after resuming on 165 for six. 

The tourists then reached 207 for five at stumps on Day 2, thanks to opener Mathew Sinclair?s 76, after surviving a spin scare on a slow turning pitch with variable bounce. 

Left-arm spinners Mohammad Rafique (three for 50) and Manjural Rana (two for 54) raised hopes of a Bangladeshi fightback when they reduced New Zealand from 97 for one to 139 for five. 

Allrounder Jacob Oram and wicketkeeper Brendon McCullum (48 batting) then put on 68 for the unfinished sixth wicket to ensure their team did not lose the advantage provided earlier by left-arm seamer Franklin. 

Franklin, 23, began the day in sensational style when he dismissed Rana and Rafique with the last two balls of his opening over and then removed Tapash Baisya with the first delivery of his next over to complete the hattrick. 

?It was a bit of a surprise,? said Franklin, who finished with a career-best five for 28 off 17 overs in his fourth Test. ?Things are going on nicely at the moment. It was certainly a good day and I am happy to get the first fiver in Tests.? 

Franklin became only the second Kiwi, after off-spinner Peter Petherick, to grab a Test hattrick. Petherick achieved the feat on his Test debut against Pakistan in 1976-77. Bangladesh this morning lost Rana (16) when he edged Franklin to McCullum, while Rafique was caught at second slip by Scott Styris off the next ball. 

Baisya offered no stroke to a delivery that moved in slightly to knock back the off stump.

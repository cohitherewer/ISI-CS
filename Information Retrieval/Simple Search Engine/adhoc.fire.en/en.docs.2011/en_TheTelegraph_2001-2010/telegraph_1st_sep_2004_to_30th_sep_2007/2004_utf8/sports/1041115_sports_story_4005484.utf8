Even if Evander Holyfield is not ready to leave boxing, most of his skills have already departed. Losing for the fifth time in his last eight bouts, Holyfield (38-8-2) was beaten by Larry Donald in a unanimous 12-round decision on Saturday night at Madison Square Garden. 

Nothing seems to convince Holyfield that the time has come to say goodbye, but maybe if he watches enough videotape of his most recent fights, something will persuade him to stop at age 42. 

In his prime, as a four-time champion, Holyfield would have surely brushed aside Donald (40-2-2), a 37-year-old journeyman. But Donald dominated this fight from the beginning, and in many rounds, Holyfield went long stretches barely throwing a punch, while being hit repeatedly. 

According to post-fight statistics, Donald landed 260 punches, Holyfield 78. The three judges scored the bout, 119-109, 119-109, 118-109, but their verdicts were really not necessary. 

Holyfield was shaken a few times, but there were no knockdowns. Donald was good enough to punish Holyfield, and the former champion wasn?t good enough to make a dent. Yet Holyfield?s post-fight comments indicated he wanted to keep fighting. 

?I?ve never given up on anything,? he said. ?I?m going to pray on it. I felt good, better than the last time. He just landed more. I saw all the shots coming. I feel good. I thought maybe I hurt him a few times, but I didn?t get off as much. I still feel that I can rise to the occasion, so why not continue to pursue the dream?? 

After the third round, Holyfield?s legs looked unsteady, and it was clear he would have trouble mounting a consistent attack. Even the crowd, which was pulling for Holyfield and chanted his name midway through the sixth round, was not enough to help. 

At the end of the sixth, the four-time champion ambled slowly back to his corner, looking weary and old. He would have saved everyone time if he had decided to quit at any point, but his pride would not let him. Holyfield had one brief shining moment in the ninth round, when he caught Donald with a right hand that rocked him. But not surprisingly, Holyfield failed to follow it up, giving Donald time to recover, and the one-sided beating continued. 

Donald was pleased with the victory, no matter how inept Holyfield looked. 

?Ain?t no doubt I won the fight,? he said. ?I won every round. He?s a seasoned veteran, and he can hurt you in the ring if you go to sleep. He?s very sneaky with his punches. This is the first step for me to becoming world heavyweight champion, which is my goal. I want to challenge all the world title belt holders because I think I earned a shot with my performance tonight.?

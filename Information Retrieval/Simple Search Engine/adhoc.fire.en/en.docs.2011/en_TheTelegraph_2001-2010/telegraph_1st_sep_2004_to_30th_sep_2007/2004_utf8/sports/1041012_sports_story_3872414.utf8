 IN THE CITY

 With the IFA Shield getting over only on Sunday and the India camp for the World Cup qualifier versus Singapore on in Goa, Bengal?s Santosh Trophy preparations have been badly hit. To make matters worse for Syed Nayeemuddin, the technical director may have to leave out some leading players.

 Shylo Malsawmtluanga left for home stating that there has been a family bereavement, Rajat Ghosh Dastidar is ruled out with an injury, there is a big question mark over Prasanta Dora who has a knee injury, and ?Debjit Ghosh is limping?, informed Nayeem.

 ?The Mohun Bagan players joined the camp today? they were so tired, I had to give them a rest,? said Nayeem. 

 ?This is not the ideal preparation, but I have no choice. I can?t afford to think negatively and find solutions to all the problems.?

 Nayeem hinted that no captain may be named when the squad is picked on Tuesday. ?I am toying with the idea of rotating the captain for each game,? the TD said. The squad will leave for Delhi on Wednesday. 

 Bengal play Mizoram on October 18 and Andhra Pradesh on October 20 in the preliminary group phase.

 The IFA Shield over, the state association can now turn its attention to the incomplete business of the CFL Super Division. 

 But much as the IFA would like to get the league over and done with quickly, a packed national calendar may push the rema- ining matches to early December.

 Santosh Trophy will keep the players occupied till the end of this month, the Durand Cup is scheduled from November 1 to 10 and the Federation Cup (in Bangalore) is from November 20 to 30. 

 The National League is due to kick off on December 10. The only ?free? slots for the remaining league matches are about a week in November and a week in December.

 ?I need just three playing days to complete the league,? said IFA secretary Subrata Datta. 

 But squeezing out those three days will hardly be easy as East Bengal ? who have their nose slightly in front than Mohun Bagan ? will be featuring on all three days (versus Tollygunge Agragami, Ever-Ready and Mohammedan Sporting). 

 Mohun Bagan have two matches left (Tolly- gunge Agragami and Ever-Ready).

 The Bhawanipur Bayam Sangha-organised table tennis meet will be held from October 29-31.

 The last date for entries is October 25, at the BTTA office.

 Logie contract terminated on mutual consent

London: West Indies coach Gus Logie has had 

his contract with the team ?terminated by mutual consent?, the West Indies Cricket 

Board has said. 

Former Test batsman Logie was appointed to the job in 2003 and his contract was to run till June 2005. ?A mutual decision was reached and it was decided that his contract would be terminated on September 30,? a board spokesman said from Antigua on Tuesday. 

The West Indies won just four of their 22 Tests under Logie. In ODIs, the side won 20 of 39 matches. 

Robertson said the board had been conducting interviews for a replacement for ?about a month? and would make an announcement after making its choice. 

They appointed Australian Cricket Academy head Bennett King as their coach, replacing Roger Harper, last year, but he pulled out saying he wanted to stay in Australia.

 Becks vows to come out fighting vs Bayer 

 - Hashemian out as Bayern travel to Israel 

 Pavel Nedved claims he is still not fully fit 

Paris: Real Madrid will try to revive memories of their last glorious moment on the Champions League stage when they face German side Bayer Leverkusen away in their first match of this season?s tournament on Wednesday. 

Two years ago a stunning volley from Zinedine Zidane was the standout moment as Real beat Bayer 2-1 in the final in Glasgow but Wednesday it will be another of their galacticos, David Beckham, who will be looking to build on his fine freekick in the 1-0 victory over Numancia on Saturday. 

The 29-year-old was still at Manchester United when Real last won the Champions League and last season?s campaign is one he would rather forget for the ?Meringues? when his marital problems intruded on his form. 

Poor performances for England at Euro 2004 and subsequent World Cup qualifiers has presented him with a huge challenge to show he is still worthy of his place in England?s side but he has come out fighting. 

?Of course my performances have not been as good but I don?t think they stretch back as far as people are saying,? he said. 

?When you get criticised some people go the other way, but some people come out fighting and my way is to come out doing just that. 

?And when people come out and criticise my family or my football then I just go out there and play my football.? 

Many Real fans will be hoping that Jose Antonio Camacho opts for a strikeforce of Spaniard Fernando Morientes, top scorer in the competition when on loan at Monaco last season, and Brazilian Ronaldo as both Raul and Englishman Michael Owen are desperately out of form. 

Real meet a side that slipped to its first defeat in 14 matches at the weekend, a 0-2 reverse against newly-promoted Mainz, and to which their coach Klaus Augenthaler held his hands up to. 

?You cannot win a football match without effort,? raged Augenthaler, who was a member of the 1990 World Cup winning West German side. 

?I have failed to take the player?s minds off the match against Madrid.? 

Fabio Capello will be looking for a measure of revenge when he takes Juventus to Ajax Tuesday as it was the Dutch side that beat his then AC Milan team in the 1995 Champions League final. 

One major doubt for Capello is Brazilian star Emerson, who suffered a leg muscle injury during the 3-0 victory over Brescia on Sunday, but on the positive side there was a goalscoring display by Czech maestro Pavel Nedved and summer signing from Ajax Zlatan Ibrahimovic. 

Nedved, though, claimed that he was still not fully fit after suffering an injury in the Euro 2004 semi-final defeat to Greece. 

?I am only playing at half my capacity,? Nedved said. ?But that is a warning to the rest of our rivals as I will very soon be back to my best and I am looking to win the Champions League this season, and at any cost,? he added. 

The play-maker, however, denied reports that he is quitting from the national team. ?I never said I am ending my career as a Czech national team player,? Nedved said. 

He said he has taken a temporary break since his health does not permit him to show equally strong and reliable performances for both the Czech national team and Juventus.

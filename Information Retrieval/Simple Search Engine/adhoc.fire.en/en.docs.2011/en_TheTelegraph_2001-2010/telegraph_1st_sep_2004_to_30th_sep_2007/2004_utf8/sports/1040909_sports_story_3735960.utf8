 Amritinder in lead

Chennai: Chandigarh?s Amritinder Singh shot into the lead with a two-stroke advantage relegating Tuesday?s leader Mukesh Kumar to the second spot midway the four-round Sahara-MCG Open golf championship here Wednesday. 

Amritinder, the last golfer to tee off for the second round, returned a seven under par 65 as compared to his first round score of five under. He has tallied 128 for two rounds, while Asian Games gold medallist Shiv Kapur maintained his second position along with MHOW?s Mukesh Kumar at 130 each. 

Delhi?s Digvijay Singh (131) and Sri Lanka?s Lalitha Kumara and C. Muniyappa (Bangalore) were in fourth, fifth and sixth spots, respectively. 

In the amateur section, V. Darshan was still in lead with 145 followed by D. Nagaraj at 148. 

The fact that 30 professionals were able to return sub-par scores and that the cut was made just two-over par 142 tell the tale of the golfers making good use of the favourable conditions. 

Amritinder gained a birdie on the long par-5 third hole and then got a hattrick of birdies from the sixth hole. He shot into the lead with four birdies on his walk back home. (PTI)

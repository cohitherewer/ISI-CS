The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Indian men outclass Poland

 - CHESS OLYMPIAD 

- Chinese women beat India 2-0 to retain title 

 Anand gave an early lead with a crushing win over Macieja 

Mallorca: Indian men beat Poland 2.5-1.5 but their medal hopes remain dim after the 13th and penultimate round of the 36th Chess Olympiad at Gran Casino here (as reported in Friday?s Late City edition). 

World rapid champion Viswanathan Anand gave the team an early lead with a thumping victory over Bartlomiej Macieja while Krishnan Sasikiran dazzled in his brilliant triumph over Michal Krasenkow. 

But on the third board, P. Harikrishna succumbed to his second straight loss bowing to Robert Kempinski while Surya Shekhar Ganguly blew away a winning endgame before signing peace with Miton Kamil. 

Anand though was a class act in crushing Macieja with black pieces. Significantly, this was also the first win with the slight unfavourable colour by the Indian in this Olympiad. 

Playing the white side of a Torre attack, Macieja could boast off a slightly better position in to the middle game but gradually Anand neutralised his initiative. 

Almost spectacularly, the Indian ace punted a brilliant knight sacrifice just while Macieja thought he was pressing for an advantage and the Polish?s position fell apart soon. Adding to the woes of Macieja was the clock as he also fell under time pressure. 

Just simple and effective manoeuvres ensured Anand a dangerous attack against a centralised white king, and the dominance of his pieces was further attested as Macieja was forced to part with his queen. The rest was child?s play with central passed pawns for Anand and he wrapped the issue in 39 moves. 

Krishnan Sasikiran was brilliance personified in his crushing victory over highly-regarded Michal Krasenkow. Having one just one game so far apart from 10 draws, Sasikiran wanted desperately to contribute in a better way and as the opportunity arose, he delivered what will also go down as one of the best games played by an Indian. 

It was a Dutch Defence by transposition wherein Krasenkow got the dynamic balance he was looking for. In the middle game Sasikiran showcased his growing tactical maturity and surprised the Polish with a queen sacrifice for just two minor pieces. However, to go with them, Sasikiran made sure he had a set of passed pawns in the middle of the board. 

Krasenkow had no suitable replies to such exploits and he caved in after the pawn roller started. Giving up another minor piece to facilitate the pawn advance, Sasikiran forced resignation after 47 moves. 

Surya missed out on the fourth board after he nearly outplayed Miton Kamil who played the black side of a Pirc Defence. The national champion looked in his element in the middle game as he exerted pressure on the king side. 

Winning a pawn after the dust settled Surya looked in fine fettle to cruise to a fine victory when suddenly disaster struck as he allowed simplifications leading to a piece up position that was a theoretical draw. The game lasted 63 moves. 

Harikrishna was outdone from the Slav Defence again. Playing with a lot of zeal, Kempinsky was determined not to let the cup slip from his lip once he managed a stronghold from a level middle game and knocked down two rooks for two knights before completing the victory. 

Russia defeated Cuba with a minimal margin in other important matches of the day while Israel drew with the US. 

Eves succumb 

Chinese eves emerged as the superpower of women?s chess yet again with another fine victory over India to take their tally to an unassailable 29 points after the 13th and penultimate round of the women?s section. 

Indian women crashed to a 0-2 defeat against the defending champions after Koneru Humpy settled for a quick draw on the top board with former world champion Xie Jun and S. Vijayalakshmi suffered a defeat at the hands of Zhao Xue while Dronavalli Harika, who kept her no-loss record intact, held Huang Qian to a draw. 

Gunning for the silver medal are Russia and the US who have 25.5 points each while Georgians are next in line on 25. 

Indian eves are on 22.5 with no chances of a medal left. 

Against China, Humpy drew without much ado against Xie Jun. The Indian mainstay could have done better had Jun gone for some complications with her white pieces but looking at China?s position in the event it was quite understandable that they were just looking at winning the gold and not bothered about big margin of victory. 

Humpy had employed the Petroff defence as black before signing peace in just nine moves. 

On the second board, Vijayalakshmi suffered a defeat at the hands of Xue after overestimating her chances in the middle game. 

Playing the white side of an English opening, Vijayalakshmi had some advantage in the middle game but could not quite capitalise on it as Xue made steady progress that led to a queen and minor piece endgame. 

The Indian had no chances after her opponent penetrated with queen leaving the white king defenceless. 

Harika drew on the last board after surviving some anxious moments. Playing the kings Indian, Huang Qian held some advantage in the ensuing endgame but thanks to a spirited defence by the Indian, the game was drawn after routine exchanges.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Decision rests with Gibbs

Durban: South African opener Herschelle Gibbs is unlikely to be penalised by the United Cricket Board of South Africa (UCBSA) even if he refuses to tour India for the two-Test series. 

Gibbs and his teammate Nicky Boje fear being interrogated by the Delhi Police regarding the match fixing scandal that broke out in 2000. 

UCBSA spokesman Gerald De Kock said the call on whether to tour rested with Gibbs. 

De Kock also said UCBSA didn?t yet consider Gibbs unavailable because there was a possibility that Delhi Police could assure the board that the player would not be arrested, media reports said here on Wednesday. 

?It won?t be a black mark against his name if he doesn?t tour. But it?s still not definite that he won?t go to India,? De Kock said. 

The UCBSA has so far not received any answer from the Delhi Police on the matter. 

After the King Commission inquiry into match-fixing, Gibbs was banned from cricket for six months and fined rands 60,000. 

The team for the series against India is expected to be selected next week and although Gibbs is not on the top of his game, he is a certainty for the tour. (PTI)

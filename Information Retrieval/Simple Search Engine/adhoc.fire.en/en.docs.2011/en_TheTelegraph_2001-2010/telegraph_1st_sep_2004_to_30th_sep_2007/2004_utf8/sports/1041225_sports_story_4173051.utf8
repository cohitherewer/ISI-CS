 Chakola, Lehal in title clash

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Joseph Chakola and Sandy Lehal, who ousted experienced campaigners Keshav Misra and Navtez Singh, respectively, will clash for the title in a 36-hole final at the Goodricke Eastern India amateur championship on Saturday. 

Chakola?s was the bigger surprise as the Mysore golfer, now based in Delhi, pulled the carpet from under former India No.1 Keshav Misra?s feet on the 21st hole. 

Sandy Lehal defeated Jamshedpur?s Navtez Singh one-up. 

Misra was clearly the favourite not just in Friday?s battle but to lift the title as well. The front-nine in the Chakola-Misra contest was a neck-to-neck affair at the closing stages of which, the former managed to nudge ahead to go one-up before making the turn. 

Misra won the tenth to settle scores. The next eight holes were halved necessitating a play-off. After a tied 19th, Misra nearly pulled off a win on the par-3 20th but his 30 feet birdie putt stopped just short of the cup. 

On the 21st, Misra pulled his tee shot into the water tank to the left of the hole to concede the match to his opponent. 

The Lehal-Navtez contest witnessed both golfers go hammer and tongs at each other. Lehal made the first move by sinking a 35 feet birdie putt on the third, but Navtez retaliated with birdies on the fourth, fifth and sixth to go two two-up after nine. 

Surprisingly the latter fell apart on the return journey.

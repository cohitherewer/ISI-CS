 Uefa award Kiev 3-0 win

London: Dynamo Kiev were awarded a 3-0 win over AS Roma on Tuesday after their Champions League match was abandoned when the referee was hit by an object thrown from the crowd in Rome. 

Roma will have to play their next two European games behind closed doors, Uefa said in a statement. The matches are against Bayer Leverkusen on November 3 and Real Madrid on December 8. Uefa?s disciplinary committee acted after Swedish referee Anders Frisk was injured at the Olympic Stadium at halftime of last Wednesday?s game, shortly after sending off Roma defender Philippe Mexes. 

Kiev were leading the Group B match 1-0 at the time. 

France?s Mexes has been suspended for two matches ?for particularly unsporting conduct?, Uefa said.(Reuters)

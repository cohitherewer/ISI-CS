Madrid: A superb late strike from Barcelona midfielder Xavi allowed the Primera Liga leaders to snatch a 2-1 win away to a determined Albacete on Saturday. 

The Spanish international volleyed into the far corner from a metre outside the area five minutes from time to grab the winner. The win put Barcelona 12 points clear at the top of the table. 

Atletico Madrid missed their chance to consolidate a place in the upper reaches of the table when they went down 0-1 at Athletic Bilbao in Saturday?s late match. 

Bilbao defender Asier del Horno grabbed the winner when he steered in at the far post on the stroke of halftime after midfielder Andoni Iraola had swept a fine pass over the Atletico defence. 

Barcelona got off to a flying start in their match when Andres Iniesta put his side ahead with less than two minutes on the clock. 

The under-21 international dispossessed Albacete defender Franciso Pena as he tried to play the ball out of the area and then poked a sharp shot under goalkeeper Ronald Gaspercic inside the near post. 

But Barcelona eased up a little too soon and struggled to put together their usual fluent passing game as they found themselves under pressure from the Albacete midfield. 

The home side equalised when Gonzalez got the faintest of touches to direct an Antonio Pacheco free-kick into the net midway through the second half. 

With the match heading to a draw, it was left to Xavi to decide the match. 

In Germany, Bayern Munich did just enough to claim the honorary title of Bundesliga winter champions on Saturday, snatching a 2-2 draw at home to VfB Stuttgart just as Schalke 04 were conceding a late equaliser to SC Freiburg. 

Bayern looked set to spend the six-week mid-season break down in third place as they fell 0-2 behind to Stuttgart through Silvio Meissner and Kevin Kuranyi goals. 

Claudio Pizarro pulled one back in the 67th minute, though, and his fellow Peruvian striker Paolo Guerrero grabbed the equaliser two minutes from time. Bayern?s failure to get all three points gave Schalke the chance to move into first place, but Ralf Rangnick?s side were denied victory by bottom club Freiburg. 

Mladen Krstajic put Schalke ahead in the 24th minute, but they failed to kill the game off and Lebanon international Roda Antar headed in with three minutes to go to claim a surprise 1-1 draw. 

At the halfway stage in the season, Bayern lead the standings with 34 points from 17 games, ahead of Schalke on goal difference. Stuttgart stay third on 31 points. 

Stuttgart took the lead with their one clear chance of the first half, as Mathieu Delpierre nodded the ball on from a corner for Meissner to lash in. 

A bad mistake from Oliver Kahn led to the second goal after 65 minutes, with the ?keeper failing to hold a weak shot from Cacau and allowing Kuranyi in for a simple finish. 

Bayern reduced the arrears almost immediately when Pizarro swept in from 15 metres out and the home side just about deserved the equaliser, turned in by Guerrero after the custodian had saved a Michael Ballack header on the line.

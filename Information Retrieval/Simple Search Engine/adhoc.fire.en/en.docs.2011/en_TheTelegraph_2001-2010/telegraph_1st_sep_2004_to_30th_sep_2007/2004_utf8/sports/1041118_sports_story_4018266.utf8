The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Atwal to play four-ball

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: In its 175th year, the Royal Calcutta Golf Club will not only see a week of celebratory events and the presence of 16 of the 61 Royal clubs around the world, but also the action of Calcutta prodigy Arjun Atwal, arguably one of the best golfers the country has ever produced. 

On the first day of the celebrations, Saturday, hosted in association with The Telegraph, and presented by Airtel, a ?glow golf?, a candlelit version of the gentlemen?s and ladies? game, will be played. Before that, however, if things go to plan, Atwal, Indrajit Bhalotia, Shiv Kapur and Rahil Gangjee will play a four-ball, all for charity, informed Gaurav Ghosh of the Royal who is putting this occasion together. 

All these are class players of the area and have been nurtured at the Royal. And it would present a rare occasion that they would be getting together for a foursome four-ball. 

Four-ball is an ideal game to be watched by juniors of the city. It will be an added tough, too, to the high-profile celebrations. Also, Atwal will be taking up the clubs and irons at the Royal after almost two years. He is now on a break, with the USPGA season over, and having attended a family marriage in New Delhi, and will be taking a couple of days? tour in his hometown. 

The match is scheduled to be Arjun and Indrajit versus Rahil and Shiv Kapur. 

And, as an icing on the cake, all proceeds will go to charity, specifically to the Sivananda Math.

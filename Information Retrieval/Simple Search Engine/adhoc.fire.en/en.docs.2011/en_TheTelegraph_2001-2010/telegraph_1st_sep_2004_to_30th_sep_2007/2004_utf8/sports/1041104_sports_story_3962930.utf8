The Telegraph - Calcutta

 ?You need guts and character, not only talent, to succeed at the highest level? 

 - Wickets are part of home advantage, there?s nothing wrong in tailoring them to suit your strength, says Imran Khan 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Mumbai: Nowadays, Imran Khan rarely gives cricket-specific interviews ? after all, he is neck deep in politics. Imran, however, did make an exception for The Telegraph on Wednesday morning and interacted in the customs area of Sahar Airport. 

The following are excerpts 

 On the ongoing India-Australia series 

 I can only repeat what I told you the other 

 day ? India?s capitulation has been, to say the least, surprising. 

 I?m amazed that a team which did so well in Australia and 

 beat us at home hasn?t been able to get its act right... 

 I?m not sure whether a game plan has been in place... If 

 there has been one, then the execution hasn?t been proper. 

 On Jason Gillespie, the series? most successful 

 quick (16 wickets in the first three Tests) 

 He?s the world?s No.1 strike bowler... 

 Really, today, he has no peers. He lands the ball perfectly 

 and it may either go out or come in. He needs to be careful 

 about fitness, though. 

 On the quality of present-day fast bowlers 

 Well, you can count the top quicks on your 

 fingers... Indeed, that?s one reason why the Australians 

 are so successful... I mean, because other sides don?t have 

 such quality fast bowlers, a big impact is easily made... 

 Handling sustained pressure becomes difficult for batsmen. 

 On the furore over the Nagpur wicket 

 Look, wickets are part of home advantage 

 and there?s nothing wrong in tailoring them to suit your 

 strength. (Adds laughing) Of course, years ago, we 

 enjoyed both the legitimate advantage and the illegitimate 

 one ? umpiring! 

 On Pakistan drawing the just-ended home series 

 against Sri Lanka after trailing 0-1 

 I?m not reading much into it as, without 

 (Muttiah) Muralidharan, the Lankans are weak... Our team, 

 though, will get better as Bob Woolmer is an excellent coach. 

 On whether Woolmer has interacted with him 

 (Interrupting) Not yet, but I myself 

 intend meeting him and sharing thoughts. He must be given 

 time to deliver. 

 On Shoaib Akhtar again having had a fitness 

 problem 

 Because of too much cricket... If I had 

 anything to do with the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), I 

 would have a policy on playing our quicks... For instance, 

 I would severely cut down Shoaib?s ODI appearances... You?ve 

 got to appreciate that limited overs cricket takes a lot 

 out of fast bowlers. 

 On the PCB having been grilled in the Senate 

 They wanted me to be part of that Senate 

 committee, helping out on technical issues, but I declined. 

 I didn?t want to... 

 On the continuing Sachin Tendulkar-Brian Lara 

 rivalry for the best batsman tag 

 In my book, (Inzamam-ul Haq) Inzy is in 

 the same league... I can?t understand why he gets underrated... 

 I suggest those who award labels should get Inzy?s statistics 

 and see for themselves the number of matches won by him... 

 He has got runs whenever Pakistan has needed them... I can?t 

 understand, though, why he doesn?t bat at No.3 in ODIs and 

 consistently at No.4 in Tests... Given that he?s the captain, 

 there?s one more reason to do so. 

 On having nursed Inzamam 

 (Laughs) Actually, he had been written 

 off by the selectors, but I insisted he be part of my side... 

 And, as is known, he responded by helping us win the 1992 

 World Cup. 

 On whether Inzamam is the ideal captain 

 Captaincy involves a lot of things... Also, 

 much depends on the team at your disposal... So... 

 On whether, having won the last three ODIs against 

 India, Pakistan start favourites for the November 13 game 

 at the Eden 

 Don?t think so as limited overs cricket 

 is a lottery... One spell by Shoaib or a Virender Sehwag 

 blinder may change everything.... 

 Finally, on what it takes to succeed at the 

 highest level 

 (Grins) Surely, not talent alone... 

 You require guts and character too.

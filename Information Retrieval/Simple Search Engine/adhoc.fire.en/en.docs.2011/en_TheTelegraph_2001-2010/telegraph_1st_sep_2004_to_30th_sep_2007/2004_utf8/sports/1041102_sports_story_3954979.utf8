The Telegraph - Calcutta

Weight of expectation off, India could now sparkle 

- Australia will need real guts to maintain the stellar standard of the first 

three Tests 

Stump vision

Ian Healy

The pressure is off, the expectations are low, so 

anything creditable will be a refreshing bonus for India in this contest in Mumbai. 

Once again they have faltered under the weight of expectation even though this 

time they have really valid reasons for moderate performances as a team.

Their injury toll has been horrific at an hour when 

they could least afford it. I doubt even Australia could expect to win without 

two strike bowlers, their captain and a star batsman who hasn?t lifted a bat for 

two months against a team full of confidence and brilliance.

Form deserts a percentage of every team but to foresee 

Dravid and Laxman?s misery was impossible and it has been damaging. Let?s not 

fool ourselves, Australia were clear favourites in this series and the result 

has surprised no one.

New blood for the fourth Test without the stress of 

worrying about the result should ensure some spark returns to the lifeless outfit 

that has been India. Laxman nailed an amazing century in Sydney years ago after 

the result mattered little so I hope he can do that again and have all others 

follow, to provide an appropriate finale to this series.

For these reasons I think this will be the easiest 

of the four Tests for India to play, unless they continue to worry about their 

position in the team, continually watching over their shoulder for approaching 

traffic. 

Little is expected of newly-selected players and this 

is the best platform from which to launch long careers. Many a career has started 

from outside the radar screens. Go for it, play hard and enjoy the fight but demonstrate 

plenty of ability to perform the tasks that are your job.

To perform your job you need to know what it is and 

this communication between the team prior to playing must improve. After discovering 

what it is that the team expects of a rookie, he must accept the responsibility 

of owning that role so that he can get close to performing it every day. Once 

these aspects are crystal clear, a youngster can set about enjoying his cricket.

Jason Gillespie has referred to Australia?s superior 

planning for the series and it is that absolute clarity of role that has allowed 

them to perform their facets of play magnificently as individuals.

 This game should see a better-equipped Sachin 

Tendulkar at the wicket 

Critics of the team?s planning in Australia last summer 

were continually refuted by the team saying they had been outplayed by a rampaging 

India but everything else was spot on.

Interesting now there is an admission that maybe those 

critics were onto something at a time when things could have been remedied. Great 

to have clarity of role but there should also be a flexibility to adapt when things 

aren?t so smooth and before critics feel the need to be involved. 

This Australian team has addressed the issue of dead 

Tests and some past average performances, but will need to muster some real guts 

to maintain the stellar standards of the first three Tests in India.

The desire to remain unbeaten and performing to the 

current levels must come from the individual and not a team meeting.

One of Australia?s great skills is their ability to 

treat every single appearance for the country as special. With workloads increasing 

it would be easy to develop a club mentality whereby an underachievement here 

or there can be tolerated but tournaments and series are still won.

The Australian team is so much more than a club and 

efforts to approach perfection in every outing are part and parcel of the philosophy.

India must see them as a little vulnerable though. 

Having experienced the relief of wrapping this one up so early, Australia have 

to gather all their toughness and aggression when they are feeling so content.

This game should see a better-equipped Sachin Tendulkar 

at the wicket. All the questions he would have been asking himself about the injury 

withstanding five days and how he would feel at the crease have been answered. 

It is great credit to the man that as soon as he could lift a bat he made himself 

available knowing how short on form he was going to be. Time in the middle is 

crucial to batting form and he had had none of it for three months. 

In 2001, it was one bowler and a classy batting order 

that saw India beat Australia in the series. This year, India have had neither 

for long enough and Harbhajan?s absence from Nagpur was a killer blow. If India 

are to own their individual roles then they must find some consistent performers 

who spend quality time in the team.

It is not acceptable to see injured unavailable players 

sitting around with the team during home Tests. This merely makes it harder for 

new blood to fully commit to their roles that need to be based on simplicity and 

repetition.

Unavailable players must return home where they can 

reassess their desire to perform for their country from an appropriate distance, 

not feel as if they are still part of it ? captain or not. (PTI)

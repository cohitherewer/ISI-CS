 Mysore season starts today 

 WILLIAM TELL

 Mysore: Stablemates Bouncy Babe and Vivid Colours, from Michael Eshwer?s yard, may fight it out in the 1,100m Rajakumari Leelavathi Devi Memorial Cup here on Monday, the opening day of the winter season. The two horses have been doing well in their workouts and also in the gate-practices. But Bouncy Babe, to be partnered by K. P. Appu, looks the better of the two and the Tecorno-Rustle Of Spring filly may triumph.

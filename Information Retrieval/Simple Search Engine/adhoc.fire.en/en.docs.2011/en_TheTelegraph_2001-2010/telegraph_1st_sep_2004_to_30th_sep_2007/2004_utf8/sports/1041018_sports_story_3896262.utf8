 Deco strikes in Barcelona win

Madrid: A deflected strike from Deco gave Barcelona a 1-0 derby win at Espanyol on Saturday, taking Frank Rijkaard?s in-form side five points clear at the top. 

Deportivo Coruna moved up to fourth on 11 points with a 2-1 win at home to Getafe but Real Madrid lost further ground as they needed a second-half goal from Ronaldo to claim a 1-1 draw at Real Betis. 

With Samuel Eto?o and Ronaldinho both missing good chances, Deco?s ninth-minute blast was all Barca had to show for another vibrant attacking display but disappointing Espanyol only occasionally threatened a comeback. The result gave unbeaten Barcelona 19 points from seven games and left Valencia, in second spot with 14 points, needing victory at home to third-placed Sevilla on Saturday to stay within striking distance. 

Real Madrid are in 10th place with 10 points after another unconvincing league display, salvaged only by Ronaldo?s second goal of the season. Real, with Guti in for the injured David Beckham, showed plenty of fight against Betis but produced precious little good football and were grateful to Iker Casillas for keeping them in the game. 

The Spain ?keeper made two outstanding saves from Ricardo Oliveira after sweeping breaks from midfield before the Brazilian striker finally made the breakthrough at the third attempt. 

Chelsea suffered their first defeat under coach Jose Mourinho on Saturday when the Premier League title contenders went down 0-1 at lowly Manchester City, adds a report from London. An 11th-minute Nicolas Anelka penalty caused the upset at the City of Manchester Stadium and left champions Arsenal five points clear at the top after they had cantered to a 3-1 win over Aston Villa earlier in the day. 

In Milan, Serie A leaders Juventus ended Messinas unbeaten start to the season with a 2-1 win over the Sicilian club on Saturday. 

Goals from Uruguayan Marcelo Zalayeta and European Footballer of the Year Pavel Nedved helped unbeaten Juventus to their fifth win in six matches, opening up a five-point lead. In Tuscany, Vincenzo Montella confirmed his return to form as AS Roma won 2-0 away to Livorno to claim their first away win of the Serie A season. 

Messina, playing their first season in the top flight since 1965, brought a huge travelling support with them to Turin but after their triumphs over AC Milan and Roma, Bortolo Mutti?s side were unable to produce another upset. 

Juventus took the lead in the 26th minute when Zalayeta, in for the injured David Trezeguet, headed home a Mauro Camoranesi cross. 

Ten minutes after the break, Czech Nedved made it 2-0 with a confident finish after excellent work from Zlatan Ibrahimovic on Juventus? right flank. 

Messina?s Riccardo Zampagna reduced the deficit in the 69th minute with a smart shot on the turn after being picked out by Salvatore Sullo. 

But despite some late pressure the Sicilians were unable to extend their unbeaten run although they remain in second place on 11 points while Juventus lead on 16. 

At Livorno, Montella set up the opening goal for Francesco Totti on the half hour when he chipped a blocked shot into the path of Totti who fired home a volley from close range.

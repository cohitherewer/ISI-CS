New York: Serena Williams latest wardrobe created a stir with the US Open spectators on Monday, but it was not welcomed by the tournament organisers. Serena was told by the USTA that she could not play in the knee-high black go-go boots because those were not customarily acceptable tennis attire. 

Besides the stylish footwear, Serena made a fashion statement with her studded tank-top and matching jean skirt and jacket. Serena has a multi-million dollar endorsement deal with American footwear and garment giant Nike and the trademark Swoosh was prominent on the items she showcased on Monday. 

 Serena agreed to an endorsement deal last year with 

 the shoe firm. Nike declined to disclose specifics of the 

 contract, but it is believed to be under the five-year $40-million 

 deal Venus inked with Reebok in 2000. 

 Pulling strings 

 Jennifer Capriati had to pull some strings with 

 a ballgirl in order to beat Czech Denisa Chladkova 2-6, 

 6-1, 6-2 in the first round. The eighth-seeded American 

 struggled early to find her game losing the first set of 

 her three-set match. At one point, she handed her racket 

 to a ballgirl to get it restrung during a changeover. The 

 ballgirl returned with racket and Capriati won the next 

 two sets to advance to the second round.

 Bitter taste 

 American tennis fans are 

 finding a sharp hike in food prices a bit hard to swallow 

 at the US Open. A pastrami or roast beef sandwich that cost 

 $12.50 last year now costs 18.50 and a lobster roll has 

 increased to 16.75 from 15.75. An American style hamburger 

 will set a spectator back $7.50 and a hotdog $4.75. Pizza 

 is 7.75. What can you do? said an irritated spectator. 

 It is not like you can bring your own sandwiches.

 New weapon 

 Law enforcement officials are carrying a new 

 weapon in the battle against a potential terror attack at 

 the US Open a device which detects biological, chemical 

 and radiation levels. There are also bomb sniffer dogs and 

 swat teams on stand-by as security personnel at this years 

 Grand Slam is up 50 per cent over 2003. Several police officers 

 are also carrying devices that can detect cyanide and nerve 

 gas. (AFP)

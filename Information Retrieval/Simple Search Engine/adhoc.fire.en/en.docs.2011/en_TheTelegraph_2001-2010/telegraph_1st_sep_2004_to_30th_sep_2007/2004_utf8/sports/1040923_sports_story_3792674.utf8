 Patel, Kartik shine for Rest

Mohali: Parthiv Patel and Murali Kartik led the rearguard action as Rest of India pulled itself out of early trouble and reached 293 for six against Mumbai on the first day of the Irani Trophy cricket match here on Wednesday. 

Patel and Kartik featured in a 95-run partnership for the unbroken seventh wicket stand as the rest plundered 114 runs in the post-tea session to wrest back the initiative from the Ranji Trophy champions. 

Patel remained unbeaten on 56 while Kartik was 45 not out, having faced just 69 balls and hit six fours at stumps. 

The duo?s brilliant counter attack that denied Mumbai the advantage of second new ball not only made up for the Rest?s top order collapse, which saw them slump to 198 for six soon after tea, but also overshadowed Sridharan Sriram?s painstaking half century that actually began the rebuilding process. 

Sriram?s 77 consumed 196 balls, spanned 261 minutes and contained seven fours. The Tamil Nadu left-hander also was associated in a 60-run partnership with Venugopal Rao (20) for the fourth wicket. 

Earlier, Mumbai were given a brilliant start by their seamers, particularly Avishkar Salvi. The right-arm pacer finished with the lowest count, 1-70, among the Mumbai bowlers but was clearly the most impressive. 

Sairaj Bahutule scalped three for 50 and Robin Morris picked two for 57 but it was Salvi?s disconcerting movement and bounce that rattled the Rest batsmen. 

Rest skipper Dinesh Mongia was adjudged leg before for four before Sriram and Venugopal (20) kept the Mumbai attack at bay for a while. (PTI)

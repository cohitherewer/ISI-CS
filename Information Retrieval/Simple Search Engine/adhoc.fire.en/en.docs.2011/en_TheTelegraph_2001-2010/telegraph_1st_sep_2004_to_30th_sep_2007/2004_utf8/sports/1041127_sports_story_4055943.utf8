 Myskina still breathes fire

 Myskina says she doesn?t regret her words about Sharapova?s father 

Moscow: Anastasia Myskina refused to back down on Thursday after saying she would not play for Russia if Wimbledon champion Maria Sharapova joined the team. 

?Why should I feel sorry for what I said yesterday?? Myskina said when asked if she regretted her words about the Florida-based teenager and her father. 

?I don?t want to be on the same team with people who don?t show respect to me as a person. End of story.? 

Sharapova has been kept out of this year?s Fed Cup team by Myskina and US Open champion Svetlana Kuznetsova, but Russian captain Shamil Tarpishchev has said he would welcome the 17-year-old next season. 

Myskina, spearheading Russia?s challenge for their first Fed Cup title this week in Moscow, was angry at Sharapova?s father Yuri for his behaviour during their match at this month?s season-ending WTA Tour Championships in Los Angeles. 

Sharapova beat Myskina in the semi-finals on her way to capturing the Los Angeles crown. 

?Every time Maria was playing a Russian girl there, her father?s behaviour was simply outrageous, nasty and out of control,? said six-time Grand Slam doubles champion and Russia Fed Cup coach Larisa Neiland this week. 

Myskina backed her up: ?I totally agree with Larisa. I feel his behaviour is totally incorrect, simply rude. I don?t want to be around people like him. 

Tarpishchev, however, tried to play down the controversy, which could jeopardise his team?s chances for their first Fed Cup title in the weekend?s final against champions France. 

?(Yuri) Sharapov has a strange, quickly-changing nervous system. It often leads to stressful situations,? Tarpishchev said.

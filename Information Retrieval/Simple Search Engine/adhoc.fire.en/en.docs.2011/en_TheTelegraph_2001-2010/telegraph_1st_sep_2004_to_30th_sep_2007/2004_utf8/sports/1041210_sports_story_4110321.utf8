New York: Mia Hamm, who is to women?s soccer what Pele was to the men?s game, retired from competition on Wednesday, having inspired a generation of young girls while leading the US to Olympic and World Cup titles. 

A friendly international against Mexico in Carson City, California, provided the final stage for Hamm as she bowed out in front of a cheering crowd. 

She retired as one of the most prolific scorers ? male or female ? in the history international soccer. 

The 5-0 US victory marked the end of a golden era in American soccer with captain Julie Foudy and Joy Fawcett also hanging up their cleats. 

The trio played together in three Olympics and three World Cups. 

Capped 276 times, Mia Hamm began her international career as a 15-year-old and finishes it 17-years later still the world?s best known women?s soccer player and one of America?s most recognisable and marketable athletes. 

A combination of skill and beauty, Hamm was twice selected Fifa Women?s World Player of the Year and once named to 

People magazine?s list of 50 Most Beautiful People. 

However, Hamm was much more than the pretty face of women?s soccer. 

A wondefully gifted finisher with devastating power, Hamm scored a record 158 goals helping the US to World Cup titles in 1991 and 1999 and Olympic gold in 1996 and 2004. 

Her popularity provided the foundation and marquee name for the WUSA, a professional women?s soccer league that flourished then folded but hopes to make a comeback next season. 

She remains the best known soccer player in the US, man or woman. 

?There are obviously highlights but I think competing for this long is the biggest,? said Hamm, during a teleconference prior to her final match. 

?We were fortunate to start as young as we all did, but at the same time we have to consider the months and years of training on our own and finding a place to play and living day-by-day on part-time jobs.? 

Having spent over half her life travelling around the world building and promoting the sport, Hamm will now embark on a new life with husband Chicago Cubs shortstop Nomar Garciaparra, who was in the stands to watch her final game. 

The 32-year-old said she had mixed feelings about walking off the field for the last time. 

?There are mixed emotions,? said Hamm. ?There are things in your life that you have had to put on the back burner and you can focus more time and energy on that now. 

?I have to see what is out there and not commit to everything at the beginning. I hope my golf game improves, I have family who I haven?t been able to spend a lot of time with, and obviously my husband and seeing where we are going to end up next year. 

?It?s nothing but exciting, and I am just looking forward to it.?

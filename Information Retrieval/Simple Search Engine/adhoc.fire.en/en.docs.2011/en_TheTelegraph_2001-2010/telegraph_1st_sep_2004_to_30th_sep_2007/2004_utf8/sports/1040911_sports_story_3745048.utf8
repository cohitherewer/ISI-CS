New York: Sweden?s Joachim Johansson left Andy Roddick shellshocked after beating the defending champion in five sets on Thursday to reach the US Open semi-finals. 

After Andre Agassi?s hopes were ended by Roger Federer earlier in the day, Roddick was left to fly the American flag but he lost 4-6, 4-6, 6-3, 6-2, 4-6 in an explosive match featuring 64 aces (as reported briefly in Friday?s Late City edition). It is the first time since 1986 that no American has reached the last four of the men?s event here. 

Second seed Roddick, who blazed through his four previous matches without losing a set, fell two sets behind as the 6-foot-6 Johansson let rip with lethal serves and forehands. 

Roddick, who cracked 34 aces to Johansson,s 30, hit back to win the next two sets and with the fans going crazy he looked ready to pull off a stunning rally. 

But Johansson, 22, a former junior doubles partner of Roddick, showed remarkable calm in the storm, staving off break points in the first game and then at 4-4. The Swede then went 40-0 up as Roddick served to stay in the championships and held his nerve to clinch victory on his third match point as the American hit a backhand long. 

The 28th seed, who goes out with Lleyton Hewitt?s sister Jaslyn, now plays the Australian fourth seed for a place in the final after the 2001 champion thrashed Germany?s Tommy Haas 6-2, 6-2, 6-2. 

Hewitt produced near flawless tennis to beat Tommy Haas 6-2, 6-2, 6-2 and reach the semi-finals. 

The 23-year-old Australian, winner here in 2001, was at his clinical best to crush the unseeded German and extend his winning streak to 15 matches. 

Haas, who has shown flashes of the form that took him to world number two in 2002, could make no impression against the fourth seed in a difficult swirling wind. Hewitt made just 10 unforced errors in the one hour 38 minute contest, closing it out with forehand winner. 

As Wednesday?s rain was replaced by a swirling breeze, top seed Federer returned to complete a 6-3, 2-6, 7-5, 3-6, 6-3 win and clinch a semi-final against Tim Henman. With a vicious crosswind playing havoc, Australian Open and Wimbledon champion Federer showed that behind the cool persona and flowing groundstrokes is a core of steel.

Bali: Svetlana Kuznetsova followed up her US Open triumph last week by defeating Germany?s Marlene Weingartner in the final of the Wismilak International on Sunday. 

The Russian?s 6-1, 6-4 victory against an unseeded opponent earned her the fifth singles title of her career, and her third this year after she won in Eastbourne and New York. 

The second-seeded Russian began slowly, as she had all week, but a nervous Weingartner, playing in her first career final was unable to take advantage. 

The German won more points on Kuznetsova?s serve than she did on her own in the first set, but the world No. 6 was able to stave off several break point opportunities. 

Weingartner rallied well. She earned a break point to lead 4-2, but Kuznetsova saved that with a fierce backhand volley. It was Kuznetsova who claimed the only break of the second set, for 4-3, when Weingartner netted a weak double-handed backhand. The Russian duly closed out the match.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Signing of contracts set for today

 - Bangla tour selection put off by a day on Sourav?s request 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: The much delayed signing of contracts by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI)-shortlisted players is expected on Wednesday evening. 

According to The Telegraph?s sources, 12 of the 17 who are in the city for the ongoing Test against South Africa, gave the contracts a final look-over on Tuesday (after Day III). 

The draft, by the way, was already agreed upon. 

The remaining five ? Ajit Agarkar, Yuvraj Singh, Parthiv Patel, Lakshmipathy Balaji and Akash Chopra ? will sign after their contracts have been couriered. 

The 12 players got together in BCCI constitutional president Jagmohan Dalmiya?s room at the Dr B.C.Roy Club House. Also present were secretary S.K.Nair, constitutional joint-secretary Prof. Ratnakar Shetty and joint-secretary elect Goutam Das Gupta. 

The players, one understands, ?invited? Team India consultant Sunil Gavaskar to join. The meeting lasted a shade over half-an-hour, with Gavaskar staying away from centrestage. 

[Coach John Wright, incidentally, wasn?t around and his future is going to be discussed at a one-to-one between him and Dalmiya either at the end of the current Test or just before the tour of Bangladesh.] 

The BCCI, it may be recalled, offered contracts in three categories soon after the Champions Trophy, on September 26. 

Those in Grade A (Sourav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar, Anil Kumble, V.V.S.Laxman, Harbhajan Singh, Virender Sehwag) are to get an annual retainership of Rs 50 lakh, while the ones in Grade B (Agarkar, Ashish Nehra, Mohammed Kaif, Yuvraj, Zaheer Khan, Balaji, Irfan Pathan) are assured of Rs 35 lakh. 

The Grade C players (Murali Kartik, Patel, Chopra) will get Rs 20 lakh. 

Meanwhile, the naming of the Bangladesh-bound squad(s) has been deferred following a request from Sourav. 

The captain didn?t want the selection at a time when the ongoing Test is interestingly poised. 

The selectors (Kiran More, Yashpal Sharma, Pranab Roy, Gopal Sharma, V.B.Chandrasekar), therefore, are now going to meet on Wednesday evening. 

Apparently, they prefer separate squads for the two Tests and three ODIs, but the BCCI?s mind isn?t made up. 

Should More and Co. have their way, the squad for the ODIs will definitely see new faces, almost surely including Jharkhand wicketkeeper Mahender Singh Dhoni. 

It?s to be seen if Dhoni makes the Test squad as well. 

Footnote: It couldn?t be confirmed, but the players are learnt to have suggested (to Dalmiya) that a full-time manager be appointed at the earliest. Actually, that ought to have been done years ago.

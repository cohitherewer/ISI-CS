 Mumbai face tricky contest vs Railways 

New Delhi: Defending champions Mumbai face a tricky contest when they take on Railways on what should be a low and slow turner at the Karnail Singh Stadium in the Ranji Trophy season opener from Sunday. 

Mumbai, who have struck a purple patch with back-to-back titles in the last two seasons, will have to negotiate a typical Railways wicket as they seek to extend their monopoly on the premier domestic championship. The black parched clay that makes up the track has tested the best of visiting batsmen in the past. 

Mumbai coach Chandrakant Pandit said the addition of Ajit Agarkar has increased Mumbai?s options. ?Agarkar coming in has made a lot of difference. He is a quality bowler for whom it doesn?t matter what track we are playing on.? 

Meanwhile, former champions Madhya Pradesh will begin their campaign against Andhra Pradesh to be played at Usha Raje Ground in Indore.

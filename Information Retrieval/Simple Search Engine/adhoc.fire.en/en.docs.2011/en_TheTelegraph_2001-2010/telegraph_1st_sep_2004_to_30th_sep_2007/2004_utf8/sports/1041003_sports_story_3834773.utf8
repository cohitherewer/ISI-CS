The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Ayhan cleared

Ankara: European 1,500 metres champion Sureyya Ayhan was cleared of doping allegations by the IAAF, but said the athlete violated rules while taking her test, Turkish news reports said on Saturday. 

Allegations that Ayhan may have attempted to cheat on a pre-Olympic doping test surfaced in August after testers complained of being obstructed from carrying out their work. Reports said the IAAF ruled that Ayhan had not taken performance-enhancing drugs, but said the athlete had broken testing rules.

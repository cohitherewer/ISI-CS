 Drugs cloud over top Premiership player 

 Arsene Wenger has voiced his concerns about doping 

London: Drugs testers from English football?s ruling body, the FA (Football Association), are targeting a top Premiership player who is suspected of using banned blood boosting drugs, a media report said. 

The news comes only days after Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger voiced his concerns that the banned hormone EPO (erythropoietin) had been unwittingly administered to some of the foreign players who had arrived at his club. 

According to Sunday Mirror, Fifa?s drug testing bodies have made the English FA and UK sport aware of one of English football?s biggest names having a very high level haematocrit level (volume of red blood cells in blood) when he was tested on international duty. 

The Football Association?s drug testers have since singled the player out. He was tested three times last season and has already been dope tested again this season. 

They were hoping regular testing would catch him if he was using performance enhancing drugs. 

Currently, the FA does not routinely test for EPO. 

However since Wenger?s revelations last week the FA has revealed plans to carry out widespread testing for EPO, which since the early 1990s has been the scourge of cycling and other endurance sports. 

EPO drugs boost the number of red blood cells, enabling the blood to carry more oxygen and thus increase energy and performance levels.

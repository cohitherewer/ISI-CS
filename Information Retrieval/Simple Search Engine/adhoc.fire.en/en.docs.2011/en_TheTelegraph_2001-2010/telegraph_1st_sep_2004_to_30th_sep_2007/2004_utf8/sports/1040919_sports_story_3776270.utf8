 Diego returns to Cuba tomorrow 

Havana: Fallen football legend Diego Maradona will return to Cuba on Monday to be shut away in a mental clinic for more drug treatment, Argentine diplomats said on Friday. 

?Everything is ready for him to arrive on Monday night,? an Argentine embassy official said. 

After a press conference at Havana airport, the 43-year-old former Argentina captain will be confined to Cuba?s Centre for Mental Health (CENSAM) until he kicks his cocaine addiction. 

He will be accompanied by a sister and his personal doctor Alfredo Cahe. 

Maradona has made Cuba his second home in recent years, saying the island offers him respite from the media and fan frenzy in Europe and South America. (Reuters)

 Fifa fine on Spain 

Zurich: The Spanish football federation was fined 100,000 Swiss francs ($ 87,340) on Tuesday for the racist chanting of its fans at the friendly match against England in Madrid in November. 

Fifa announced the punishment Tuesday following a meeting of its disciplinary committee. Several black England players were subjected to monkey noises and other abusive chants from the crowd during their 0-1 defeat at the Bernabeu on November 17. 

The punishment also took into account racist abuse at the under-21 match the previous evening. Fifa, warned in a statement that any repeat of the racist behaviour could result in them playing behind closed doors or expulsion from one or several Fifa competitions. (Reuters)

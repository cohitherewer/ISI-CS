 Brisk business at RCTC on bandh day 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Defying all odds, RCTC conducted the eight-event race programme on Wednesday, the bandh day. The attendance was good at the raceground and the totalisator did brisk business. ?Tote collected about Rs 32 lakh. The amount is about 12 per cent more than our regular collections on mid-week race days. Attendance also exceeded our expectations. It shot up by 10 per cent. About 4,000 people made it to the ground,? said Boman Parakh, secretary RCTC.

 Racing too was very competitive with three and four-year-old fancied horses dominating the card. However, it was trainer Daniel David who reaped the harvest. He reeled off four events ? including the afternoon?s feature, the Artaius Cup. Assisted by the visiting jockey B. Prakash?s superb riding, Daniel?s classic aspirant Moon Emperor necked out the Monsoon Derby winner Elistano, a Vijay Singh trainee. The finish would have turned further exciting had Vijay?s Thrilling Proposal not shifted out when the heat was on.

 Daniel?s Star Emblem ? the hottest favourite on the day ? and Far Hope were, however, very facile winners in their respective events. And so was Vijay?s Calescent.

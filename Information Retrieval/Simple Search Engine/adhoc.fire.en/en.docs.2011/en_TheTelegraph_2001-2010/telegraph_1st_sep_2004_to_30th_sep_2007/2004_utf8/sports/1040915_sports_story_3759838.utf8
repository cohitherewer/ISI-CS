The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Uneasy lies the crown

 Mauresmo?s main goal is to win a major 

London: More from a mathematical anomaly than a badge of honour, the world No. 1 ranking rests uneasily on the shoulders of Amelie Mauresmo. 

Monday?s rankings released by the arbiter of women?s tennis, the WTA, elevated the 25-year-old Frenchwoman to the top of the world. 

The first player from France, male or female, to scale such heights, she has more computer points than any player on the women?s tour, but none of the Grand Slam silverware. 

Indeed, that Mauresmo should replace Justine Henin-Hardenne at the pinnacle of the rankings makes little sense to anybody other than the statisticians at the WTA. 

Last month it was Henin-Hardenne who added Olympic gold to her Australian Open title this year, and the Wimbledon and US Open crowns she won in 2003. 

But, after a year blighted by a mysterious viral illness, the Belgian was forced to surrender the top spot she had occupied in the rankings for 46 weeks since last October. 

Mauresmo won the silver medal at the Athens Olympics and helped France win the Fed Cup last year. But she has managed to reach only one Grand Slam final, losing to Martina Hingis at the 1999 Australian Open. 

At the French, she has never progressed beyond the quarters, always succumbing to crippling nerves unbecoming a world No. 1. 

Such has been Henin-Hardenne?s dominance; the only player to have interrupted her tenure at the top was compatriot Kim Clijsters, who reclaimed it briefly at the end of 2003. 

Clijsters had been the first player to reach the top without a Grand Slam crown when she claimed it in August 2003. Mauresmo is the second. 

But while there is a feeling Clijsters will one day win a major title ? she has reached four finals and has won the season-ending championships twice at just 21 years old ? Mauresmo?s future is less certain. 

?Hopefully, now the Grand Slams will follow,? Mauresmo smiled at the weekend, adding that her main goal was still to win a major crown. ?It?s all about building things step by step. This gives me an incentive.? 

It is not incentives Mauresmo needs, however, rather steelier nerves and more confidence in her undoubted abilities. Perhaps attaining the world No. 1 ranking will give her that confidence. 

Certainly the WTA would hope so ? its ranking credibility depends on the top players having both the ability and the character to win the Grand Slams.

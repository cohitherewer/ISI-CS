The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Dope scam stranger than fiction

 - Equestrian scandal 

Dublin: A theft from a doping lab near London. A break-in at an office outside Dublin. Anonymous faxes and sinister turns. An investigative trail that stretches from Switzerland to Hong Kong. 

The plot for a detective novel or spy thriller? 

No, it?s the latest instalment in an Olympic drug-testing scandal that has divided Ireland?s equestrian elite and seriously jeopardised the country?s only medal won at the Athens Olympic Games. 

The latest episode unfolded on Tuesday with confirmation that the headquarters of the Equestrian Federation of Ireland was ransacked overnight and files stolen. 

?It?s another grubby chapter in a rather sinister saga,? said the federation?s president, Avril Doyle. 

The raid happened hours after the international equestrian federation (FEI) in Lausanne, Switzerland, announced that a crucial urine sample from Ireland?s gold-winning horse, Waterford Crystal, was stolen on October 21 in England. 

Doping experts working for the federation, called the FEI, had identified banned sedatives in an initial urine sample of Waterford Crystal after jockey Cian O?Connor rode him to Olympic Glory on August 28 in Athens. 

O?Connor protested his innocence and demanded that a second sample be tested, his right under international sports law. 

The scandal has taken several murky turns since. Police in Cambridgeshire, Northeast of London, confirmed on Monday night that they had opened an investigation into the alleged theft of urine sample while it was in transit from a laboratory in Paris to England?s most-respected drug-testing lab, Newmarket. 

?The sample never arrived,? a Cambridgeshire police statement said. ?The courier company delivered the package, which was signed off. It was only later the sample was discovered to have been stolen.? 

Steve Maynard, director of Newmarket lab?s drug surveillance group, denied taking receipt of the sample. 

?We never actually had possession of the sample,? he told the Irish Times. 

O?Connor and his veterinarian James Sheeran have refused to identify the substances allegedly found in Waterford Crystal?s first urine sample. 

But within hours of yesterday?s break-in outside Dublin, the Irish state broadcasters RTE received anonymous faxes of leaked FEI documents. They identified the substances as two high-powered drugs designed for use in humans suffering from schizophrenia and other psychiatric problems.

 Buenos Aires: Argentine 1986 World Cup winning defender Jose Luis Cuciuffo died after being shot in a hunting accident, Argentine newspapers reported on Sunday. He was 43.

 Cuciuffo, a central defender in the side captained by Diego Maradona that won the 1986 tournament in Mexico, was fatally wounded in the stomach while out hunting in southern Buenos Aires province on Saturday evening, they said on their websites. He died in hospital.

 He played in the Argentine first division for Talleres, in his home city of Cordoba, Velez Sarsfield and Boca Juniors and French clubs Nimes and Reims.

 Abuja: Nigeria?s captain Jay Jay Okocha was named on Sunday as one of five finalists for the 2004 African Footballer of the Year. The Bolton Wanderers player leads a list that also includes South Africa?s Benni McCarthy, a Champions League winner with Porto, Didier Drogba of Chelsea and the Ivory Coast, and 2003 winner Samuel Eto?o of Cameroon, who plays for Barcelona.

 Togo international Emmanuel Adebayor, who plays for French club Monaco, is a surprise finalist.

 Okocha is the favourite after his performance at the African Nations Cup finals in Tunisia earlier this year. The winner will be announced at an awards ceremony in Durban on February 15. 

 Stockholm: Manchester United?s Swedish midfielder Bojan Djordjic will next week sign for Glasgow Rangers, Swedish daily Aftonbladet reported on Saturday. ?I spoke to (United manager) Alex Ferguson today and I found out that it?s ready... I?m going (to Glasgow) on Monday to sign the contract,? Djordjic, told the paper.

 Aftonbladet said the contract with the Scottish club would be for two-and-a-half years.

 Djordjic joined United in 1999 but has struggled to make the first team. The 22-year-old played on loan for Danish super league club AGF Aarhus during the 2002-2003 season and for Serbian side Red Star Belgrade the following season. 

 Yokohoma: Portugal?s Porto beat Colombia?s Once Caldas 8-7 in a penalty shoot-out to win the World Club Cup on Sunday, following a goalless draw after extra time. Pedro Emanuel stroked home the decider to give the European Cup holders their second title after winning it in 1987.

 ?Everyone fought hard for this title so its very gratifying,? said Porto midfielder Maniche. ?It?s a final so we expected a tough battle. But we got what we deserved.?

 Benni McCarthy was unlucky not to score a hattrick in the last annual clash between the European and South American champions under the present one-off format. McCarthy had a goal controversially ruled offside.

 Mexico City: UNAM Pumas, coached by former Real Madrid and Mexico striker Hugo Sanchez, clinched a double by winning the Mexican Apertura title on Saturday. Francisco Fonseca scored the only goal as Pumas won 1-0 away to Monterrey to take the two-legged final 3-1 on aggregate. UNAM had won the Clausura, second of the two championships played , in mid-year.

 ?Security? computer of the Beckhams stolen 

 - Two arrested as police alerted over alleged attempts at blackmail 

London: Two men have been arrested over the theft of a desktop computer containing security details about England captain David Beckham and his family, police said. 

The computer was reportedly stolen from Chase Security Management, a firm based in Leeds that was hired by the Beckhams to beef up their personal security, the Sun newspaper reported on Saturday. 

Chase Security Management alerted police after alleged attempts at blackmail over the contents of files about the Beckhams on the computer?s hard drive, the Sun reported. 

They were said to include detailed information on the family?s security arrangements at home and abroad, as well as the positioning of all the cameras and alarms at their Hertfordshire mansion. 

?I can confirm two men have been arrested in relation to allegations of theft and blackmail relating to a property at the centre of a dispute with a security company,? a spokesman for South Yorkshire Police said. ?Both were questioned and released on bail pending enquiries.? 

Police said the men were both from south Yorkshire and had been bailed to return to a police station at a later date. 

The Sun said that one of its reporters had been offered a computer allegedly containing the information, which it handed over to the police. 

Leeds security management chief Peter Consterdine, told the Sun: ?I have passed on all this to the police because we have had an extortion demand. 

?The information is our proprietary information, and confidential, and they are now using that to blackmail us.? 

The files showed that every member of the Beckham family has had DNA swabs taken and stored by police for identification in case they are kidnapped and held to ransom, the Sun reported. 

Beckham, his pop star wife Victoria and her parents Tony and Jackie were advised to take a special driving course on how to tackle ?security threats? while out on the road, the newspaper said. 

It reported that the master plan was sent to every police control room including London?s Metropolitan Police as a guideline on how to tackle an emergency.

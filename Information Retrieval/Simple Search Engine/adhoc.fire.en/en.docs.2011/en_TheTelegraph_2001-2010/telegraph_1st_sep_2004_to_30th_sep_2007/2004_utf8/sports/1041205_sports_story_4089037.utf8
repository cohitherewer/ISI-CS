The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Twins keep US in hunt

Seville: Twins Bob and Mike Bryan breezed past Spain?s Tommy Robredo and Juan Carlos Ferrero on Saturday to give the United States a glimmer of hope of rescuing the Davis Cup final. 

The former Roland Garros champions destroyed the makeshift Spanish pairing 6-0, 6-3, 6-2 in just 98 minutes at Seville?s Olympic Stadium to win Patrick McEnroe?s team their first point of the tie. 

Holders of a record 31 Davis Cup titles, the US still trail 2-1 after both Andy Roddick and Mardy Fish were beaten in the opening day?s singles. 

Saturday?s one-sided doubles victory subdued the 27,000 partisan fans who had roared Spain on in the first day and gave the U.S. a lifeline. 

Spain need just one more win to clinch their second Davis Cup title. Carlos Moya clashes with Roddick in the first singles match on Sunday while Roddick?s conqueror on Friday, Rafael Nadal, plays Fish. 

Nadal had been due to team up with Robredo for Saturday?s doubles match but Spanish coach Jordi Arrese announced the switch with Ferrero just hours before the start. 

Ferrero has endured a miserable, injury-strewn year and was devastated to have lost his singles spot to Nadal. 

His performance in the doubles will have done little to lift his spirits. 

?I am barely used to playing doubles but I am here to play and this was what I was asked to do,? a downbeat Ferrero said. 

The former world No. 1 appeared subdued throughout the match, often lashing forehands long and failing to penetrate with his serve.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 The boys must remain as hungry as at Lords: Wright

 - The team must realise past is past... you cant live on that 

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI 

 John Wright 

London: It isnt only the captain who is under pressure when the team isnt doing well, the coach is equally affected. It has been no different for the Sourav Ganguly-John Wright twosome. 

Sundays win over England, however, has eased some of the pressure but both are aware that the task at hand (read the Champions Trophy) is daunting. And, given Indias recent run, Wright refuses to accept that the start against Kenya, on Saturday is potentially a soft one. 

Thats not how Im going to approach it... In any case, Im not the sort to take anything for granted, Wright told The Telegraph on Tuesday. 

He added: The victory at Lords definitely came at a good time... We needed it... Having said that, the boys must remain as hungry... They need to carry the same body language into the Champions Trophy... After all, just one team from the group will move up (to the semi-finals)... 

[India and Kenya apart, the group has Pakistan.] 

Asked whether Sachin Tendulkars non-availability is never quite leaving the back of his mind, Wright replied: Not really... I mean, what can I or anybody else do? Weve got to back the 14 at hand... Obviously, I hope Sachins recovery is quick and that he is available for the home series versus Australia.

In Wrights opinion, the recent defeats (in Sri Lanka, Holland and in the first two NatWest games) should make everybody aware that the outstanding 2003-04 season is history. Most definitely, the boys must realise the past is past... You cant live on that... It appears everybody hasnt really come out of that season, is how he put it. 

According to the coach, Team Indias biggest problem has been not playing to potential: At this level, in particular, mistakes have to be minimised and, more important, not repeated... So, its essential to consistently play to potential.... And, yes, its important for our batters to fire... 

Well, is there a formula for consistency? 

I wouldnt call it a formula, but one must play to his strengths and be aware of his limitations... Once that is got right, its going to be difficult to go wrong, Wright answered professor-like. 

For now, facilitating the right balance is his priority.

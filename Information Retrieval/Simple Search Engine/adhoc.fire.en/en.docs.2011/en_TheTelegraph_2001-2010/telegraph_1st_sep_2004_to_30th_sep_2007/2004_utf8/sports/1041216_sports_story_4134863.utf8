The Telegraph - Calcutta

 India XI set to wear same look

 - Not one regular bowler inclined to take a break in Chittagong

Calcutta: Shib Shankar Paul and Gagandeep Singh?s spirits may have lifted with captain Sourav Ganguly talking about the ?possibility? of giving youngsters a chance, in the second (and final) Test versus Bangladesh, but disappointment seems to be in store for the two mediumpacers. 

They are the only rookies in the XV. 

According to The Telegraph?s sources, after all, ?not one? of the regular bowlers has shown any inclination to take a break in Chittagong, where Team India?s concluding Test of 2004 gets underway on Friday. 

Apparently, a member of the team management did ?speak? to the regulars after India?s huge (innings and 140 runs) win in Dhaka, but met with a ?we-definitely-want-to-play? response. 

That?s hardly a surprise: Who wouldn?t like to add easy wickets, more so after a tough time against Australia not many weeks ago? 

?At this moment (Wednesday evening), I don?t see any change in the XI which did duty in the first Test? Bangladesh must prepare to again face our full might,? a well-placed source informed, when contacted in the port city. 

In any case, irrespective of the opposition, a Test cap should always go to the most deserving. No exceptions, please. 

The Indians arrived in Chittagong rather early on Wednesday and, within hours, were at the ground for a workout. 

The wicket, one learns, is firm and without grass. ?It?s bound to help batsmen,? the source added. The question, of course, is: Again, will one innings be enough from the Indians? 

Among the newest of Test centres, all six matches hosted by the port city have been won by the visitors ? Zimbabwe, Pakistan, West Indies, South Afr- ica, England and New Zealand. 

Meanwhile, as promised by the Bangladesh government ? after a specific request from New Delhi ? security in Chittagong is on the Dhaka-lines. 

The touring contingent, by the way, has grown with Dona and Sana joining Sourav and Vijeta turning up to keep vice-captain Rahul Dravid company. 

V.V.S.Laxman and Virender Sehwag?s wives have been in Bangladesh from the first day.

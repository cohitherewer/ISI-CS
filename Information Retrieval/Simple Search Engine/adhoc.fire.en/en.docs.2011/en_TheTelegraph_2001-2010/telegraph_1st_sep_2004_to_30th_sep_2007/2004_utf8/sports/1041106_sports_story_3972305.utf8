New Delhi: A tactical change in the second 

half and a superlative display by their midfield quartet, Mohun Bagan overcame 

State Bank of Travancore (SBT) 3-1 in a Group C match of the Durand Cup on Friday. 

Noel Wilson, Mehtab Hussain and Eduardo Coelho scored for the Calcutta giants while Hakim netted for the losers. 

Bagan could have won by a bigger margin, but striker James Ugwu squandered sitters by wayward shooting. Bagan topped group C with six points and will meet group A toppers Salgaocar in the Sunday?s semi-final. 

Earlier in the day, holders Salgaocar struggled to overcome Air India 1-0. 

Substitute Bhuvan Joshi scored the winner heading in a Freddy Mascarenhas cross in the 77th minute. 

Salgaocar had four points in their kitty, one ahead of Air India. 

The Mohun Bagan team and their coach Subrata Bhattacharya?s joy at their enthralling display was restrained as stalwart defender Eduardo Coelho picked up his second yellow card in this match after a needless one in the previous outing against Assam Rifles. 

Now Eduardo will have sit out of the semi-final. 

Initially, SBT rattled green-and-maroon defence with their speed and one touch attacks. 

In the 28th minute, midfielder Lanel Thomas? angular try was deflected home by a seemingly offside, striker Abdul Hakeem. Bagan?s vehement protests fell into deaf ears. 

In the injury time of the first half, Wilson equalised for Bagan with a stunning 30-yard rising shot. After the breather, Bagan?s midfielders adopted pressing tactics and distributed the ball in space to harass SBT?s defence. 

In the 58th minute, Dharamjit Singh?s tantalising cross to the far post was headed in smartly by Mehtab Hussain. 

Sneaking in on the blind side, Eduardo powerfully headed in a Mehtab corner in the 85th minute. 

Teams 

Mohun Bagan: Subrata Pal, Manitombi Singh, Mehrajuddin Wadao, Eduardo Coelho, Rishi Kapoor, Mehtab Hussain (Jo Paul Anchery 88), Basudeb Mondal (T. Roopesh Kumar 85), Noel Wilson, Dharamjit Singh, Sunil Chetrri and James Agbo Ugwu. 

SBT: P.V. Harshat Rehman, Paul Anthony, M. Abdul Basheer, V. Sivakumar, N.P. Pradeep, T. Shabeer Ali (A.B. Kabeer 60), Lenal Thomas, K.M. Abdul Naushad, S. Ignatius (Mohammed Aslam), M.A. Abdul Hakeem and M. Mohammed Rafi. 

Referee: Benjamin D?Silva 

Paolo injured 

East Bengal striker Paolo da Silva has a hamstring injury and is doubtful for Saturday?s crucial group B tie against Sporting Clube de Goa. 

Assistant coach Bikash Panji is not unduly worried as newly registered striker Earnest Jeremiah has joined the squad. 

Panji said he will telephonically check up with Subash Bhowmick before deciding whether to play Jeremiah or Paolo. 

East Bengal need a draw to make the semis.

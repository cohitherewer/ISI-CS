 UCBSA dismisses reports 

Durban: The United Cricket Board of South Africa (UCBSA) on Saturday brushed aside reports which claimed that black players were being racially discriminated by their white counterparts in the national team. 

UCB CEO Gerald Majola said no player of colour had complained of being a victim of racial discrimination and that board officials had not come across any incidents of racism. He was reacting to newspaper reports that several players of colour have complained of being treated with disdain because of their colour. 

?None of the players I spoke to within the last week made any mention at all to me of being a victim of racist incident,? said Majola. ?These are serious allegations and powerful and convincing proof would be needed to back them up,? he said. 

The claims of racism were published in the Independent group of newspapers in Durban, Johannesburg, Pretoria and Cape Town. 

Players of colour, who declined to be named, claimed that they were made to feel ?very unwelcome? in the South African camp. They also claimed that they were not welcomed by some of the ?white? players. 

?The last two months can be described as the worst in my life. In the changerooms, we are made to feel we have encroached into their territory. However, when we are in the eye of the public, a totally different picture is painted to the masses,? one black player was quoted as saying in the reports. 

One said that in the past 18 months he had said not more than ten sentences to star batsman Jacques Kallis.

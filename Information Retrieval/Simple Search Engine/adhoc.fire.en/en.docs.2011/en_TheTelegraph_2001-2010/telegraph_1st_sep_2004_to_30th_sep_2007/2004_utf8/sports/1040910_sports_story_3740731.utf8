 No place for MacGill

 - TOUR OF INDIA - Four rookies, three spinners in Australian XVI 

 MacGill lost out to Hauritz and Watson 

Sydney: Leg-spinner Stuart MacGill and allrounder Andrew Symonds were left out of Australia?s squad on Thursday for the tour to India in October and November after the selectors decided to go for fresh blood. 

Despite being the leading wicket-taker in the last series with India, MacGill failed to win a place in the 16-man squad that has three specialist spinners. 

Symonds, who sparkled when Australia won last year?s World Cup in South Africa, was also overlooked as four uncapped players were picked. 

Australia have not won a Test series in India since 1969-70 but chairman of selectors Trevor Hohns said he was confident of ending the long drought. 

?This is a well-rounded squad that gives us enormous flexibility and it?s one that we?re very pleased with and excited about,? Hohns said in a statement. 

?One of Australian cricket?s greatest challenges remains winning a Test series in India and we?re confident that this squad will give us every opportunity to do so.? 

Michael Clarke, Nathan Hauritz, Shane Watson, Cameron White and the experienced Brett Lee were added to the squad which defeated Sri Lanka 1-0 in July, while MacGill and South Australian youngster Shaun Tait were the only casualties. 

Since Indian wickets traditionally offer turn, MacGill was expected to join fellow wrist spinner Shane Warne and one other slow bowler in the squad. But the experienced leggie lost out to White and Hauritz. 

Hohns said White was chosen because of his superior batting while Hauritz got the nod because he was a specialist off-spinner. 

?We were very keen to include two allrounders in the squad and Cameron?s ability with the bat worked strongly in his favour,? Hohns said. ?In Nathan?s case, we thought it sensible to include a finger spinner given the conditions and our history of including a finger spinner in the squad on our last two Indian tours.? 

Watson, who toured South Africa in 2002 but is yet to play a Test, won the allrounder?s spot ahead of Symonds after recovering from injury, while Clarke, also uncapped, was included as an extra middle-order batsman. 

Lee, missing since January because of an ankle injury, was recalled to bolster a pace attack that includes Glenn McGrath, Jason Gillespie and Michael Kasprowicz. 

Australia will travel to India after the ICC Champions Trophy in England ends later this month. 

The first match of the four-Test series begins in Bangalore on October 6. Chennai, Nagpur and Mumbai will host the other Test matches.

 Sohail, Waseem call it a day

Lahore: Pakistan?s penalty corner expert and the world?s highest goal-scorer Sohail Abbas announced his retirement on Sunday. 

The announcement came after Pakistan clinched the Champions Trophy bronze beating arch-rivals India 3-2. 

?I have played enough for my country and it is now time for the youngsters to take over,? said the 28-year-old who scored 274 goals during a seven-year career. ?I am getting married in two weeks? time and that will mark a new chapter in my life.? 

Pakistan skipper Waseem Ahmed also decided to hang up his boots. 

Waseem, who was appointed captain before the Test series against India, said he was vacating his slot for a youngster but that he would continue playing in the European league. 

?I have been playing for 13 years now. I think the time has come to say goodbye to the game. I need some mental and physical rest,? the diminutive midfielder said. 

?We have some very promising players and keeping an eye on the future, we need to have a young side,? said the veteran of over 250 internationals. 

Waseem, who besides Sohail was the only Pakistani to be included in the World XI which played against Holland in 1999 as part of the FIH?s 75th anniversary celebrations, said he may think of coming back for the 2006 World Cup if the team needed him. 

?I may consider it if they need me. But I know that?s not going to happen since the young players are doing a great job,? he said. 

?As of now, I will take a break before continuing in the European league,? said Waseem who got the Man-of-the-Match award on Sunday.

 Warne rules out ODI return

Melbourne: Shane Warne on Saturday ruled out a return to one-day Internationals, saying he hoped the decision would prolong his Test career by another three years. 

?If people didn?t believe me for the last 18 months or two years that I?ve retired, hopefully they do now,? Warne said. 

?Of course I?d love to keep playing one-day cricket,? the 35-year-old Australia leg-spinner added. 

?But I?m smart enough to realise if I continue to play both forms of the game, then I don?t think I can play another three years of Test cricket, as I?d like to do.? 

One of Wisden?s five cricketers of the 20th century, Warne formalised his departure from ODI cricket on Saturday by presenting batsman Michael Clarke with his number 23 one-day shirt. 

?It?s a tradition that hasn?t really happened in cricket and I wanted to be the first guy,? Warne said. ?It?s pretty simple. I love the way he plays the game. He entertains the crowd. 

?There?s nothing he has to live up to. I don?t believe in that stuff. It?s just a tradition I wanted to start.?

 Alford wasted early advantage 

 STAR RACER

 Star Angel could not have given a better start to trainer Daniel David?s classic hunt. Last Friday, the filly not only overcame the weight disadvantage against another classic hopeful, Calorific, but she also handed a sound thrashing to the Vijay Singh-ward in the 1,400 m Gavin Johnston Cup.

 The two horses were evenly poised in the first half of the trip but Calorific?s jockey C. Alford faulted turning for the final bend which the horse negotiated very wide. It not only ensured the filly?s victory but also made her a hot-property for the November 26 classic. 

 The argument does hold the ground that Calorific could have placed a lot closer to the winner had the 12-10 joint favourite not taken the home-turn wide. Therefore, kudos are for jockey Mark Gallagher?s sense of positioning. 

 Luck was not by Alford?s side, perhaps. Earlier in the afternoon, too, he had failed with Corvino ? Vijay?s another hot-favourite. But the defeat of the 6-10 favourite in the 1,600m Too Hot To Touch Cup had more to do with the three-year-old?s inexperience over the metric-mile than the jockey?s artistry in the saddle. Straight after his monsoon season victory, albeit an easy one over a sprint, Corvino was trusted to deliver the goods over the slated trip. The American Chance-Engaging Girl son did take a commanding two-length lead in the home-stretch but he found the aged T.N. Jaiswal mare Finders Keepers? challenge too hot to counter. A brief resistance inside the last furlong was all Corvino could offer but, finally, experience prevailed over youth. Only half-a-length separated the two at the wire.

 It was the changed tactics and the revised allocation of weights that worked to Royal Contenders? advantage in the 1,200m Wind Song Handicap. On the opening day, the Jaiswal-trainee had lost a close contest to Beyond The Clouds when ridden in a check. Jockey Prithviraj decided to gallop the favourite up with leaders April Ace and Dream Sovereign, on this occasion. Royal Contender surged into the lead in the final stretch and was home to leave the rest to sort out the minor placings.

 Javed Khan?s Thanks To All had been knocking on the door for long. In the 1,200 m Sunray Handicap he looked unstoppa-ble. In fact, the Metal Precieux-How Come four-year-old looked a winner after he slipped into the lead. Mark Reuben allowed Great Ambition and Frontier Flame to call the shots in the first-half of the sprint before taking the charge. In his present form he could score a brace of wins.

 Bharath Singh?s Sparkling Clear was neither comfortable with her unstable ?ring? odds nor during the running of the 1,400m Royal Double Handicap. If her increasing odds sent a clear signal that all was not well with the Bharath Singh-trainee, Alford failed to maintain the striking position the Flitch-Million Stars filly was in, in the home stretch. As a result of this, Gallagher on the 2-1 second favourite Steinlen found a free galloping room to shoot into a comfortable lead which was challenged only in the final stages of the race by the lesser-fancied Bharath-duo of Deeqa and Followme. By then, however, the Daniel-ward had already had the title well in his custody.

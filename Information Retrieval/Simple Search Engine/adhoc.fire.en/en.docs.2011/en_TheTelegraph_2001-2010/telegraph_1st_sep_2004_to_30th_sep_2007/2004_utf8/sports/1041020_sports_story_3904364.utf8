 Constantine?s time is up

Free Kick

P.K. Banerjee

 Another international match, another defeat. The public is utterly disgusted seeing our national team lose with such regularity. No wonder Indian football has failed to kick off despite a few hints of revival in the last decade or so.

 None expected India to top a group containing Japan and Oman and advance to the second stage of the Asian zone World Cup qualifiers. But we should certainly have done better than the performance dished out so far. With a game in Oman (against whom we lost 1-5 at home) remaining, I sincerely hope we don?t end our campaign with another depressing result.

 The Indians started off on an encouraging note, dominating Singapore and beating them 1-0 in Goa. Another home match was up next but, instead of maintaining the momentum, Constantine?s men caved in meekly to go down 1-5 against Oman. Two routs followed against Japan, and now a 0-2 result in Singapore.

 Constantine?s head is on the chopping block and I can?t blame the critics. The only yardstick to judge the performance of a coach are results. In the World Cup qualifying campaign, Constantine?s record is four losses and one win. And, in those five games, we have conceded 18 goals and scored just two. Those are frustrating figures by any standard.

 This compares poorly with our previous pre-World Cup showing. Four years ago, under Sukhwinder Singh, the spirited Indian team came within a whisker of earning a berth in the second round of the qualifiers. They beat the UAE at home and lost a close away game, defeated Bahrain twice and drew with Yemen both home (1-1) and away (3-3). Had they managed to win any of those matches versus Yemen, Sukhi would have achieved what many coaches dream of.

 Sukhi, however, ran out of favour soon and had to make way for Constantine in 2002. Constantine had a decent first year, winning the LG Cup in Vietnam and coming close to qualifying for the Asian Games quarter finals in Busan. 

 Thereafter, the disappointments have outnumbered the positives. Now, I think it?s time for the federation to look for an alternative.

 I feel bad for Constantine. He did put in a lot of effort, but not all of it was in the right channel. He wanted total control and authority over the team, nothing wrong with that. But the problem is, he thinks he knows everything and can?t stand any advice. He has even gone to the extent of insulting some coaches and players indiscriminately.

 Problem with Constantine is that he thinks he 

knows everything

Some federation officials, instead of trying to put some good sense into Constantine?s head, encouraged him to act like an autocrat, thus giving him a rather long rope. Those same officials are now baying for Constantine?s blood! This is India.

 Ours is such a strange country. There?s so much diversity, so many states with different languages, culture and habits, so much politicking in every walk of life. Coaching an Indian team is more difficult than coaching a World XI. And the task gets even more tough for a foreigner.

 I have always believed that no matter what the credentials, no foreign coach can single-handedly solve our problems. 

 Simply put, it is almost impossible for him to go to the crux of the matter. Unless, of course, he has lived in this country for many, many years and merged with its people like Sister Nivedita and Mother Teresa have done. 

 They understood the pulse of this country as well as its people and earned their respect and love, not overnight, but over a long period of time.

 If at all we are to go for a foreigner, we should firstly target a top-grade coach and hire him with the full compliment of support staff (physio, analyst, psychologist etc). Even that won?t guarantee success, but it?s worth a try. The point is, can we afford to hire a top-class coach and his team? 

 I am talking about not just football, but every discipline. John Wright has been around for over four years, but it was only last season that India showed the consistency of a champion team. It didn?t last long, as we are already seeing this season. When we have such legends and great cricketing brains like Sunil Gavaskar, why should we look elsewhere? 

 I can?t explain in words how happy I was the day I read that Sunil had agreed to be the team?s batting consultant. I hope this sets a new trend in Indian sport.

 Returning to football, it?s for our federation to decide how long they want to stick with Constantine. I have read reports the AIFF is hunting for another foreigner to replace Constantine with. 

 I?m praying their search is a futile one so that they are forced to give the job to an Indian. Not that an Indian coach will work wonders overnight, but we will be saving a great many dollars, which can be better utilised in the development of Indian football.

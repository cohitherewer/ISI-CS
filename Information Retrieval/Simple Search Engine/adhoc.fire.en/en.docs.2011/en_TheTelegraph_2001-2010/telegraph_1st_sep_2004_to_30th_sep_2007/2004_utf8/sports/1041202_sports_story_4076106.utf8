 Slim chance of winning, says Akram

 Akram feels the team has talent, but no experience 

Karachi: Former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram thinks his team has only a very slim chance of winning its Test series in Australia starting this month. 

?I have been there (Australia) some 10 times in the last 20 years and I know how tough it is going to be there,? Akram said on Wednesday. 

?In the past we went there with better and more experienced sides and still struggled. Australia is the best Test side today and it is a different experience playing there. 

?Pakistan has a lot of talent and ability but they lack experience and the fast bowlers are struggling,? Akram added. 

Pakistan play Tests in Perth, Melbourne and Sydney against the all-conquering Australians, who have not lost a home series in 12 years. 

Akram ? who captained Pakistan in their last two Test series in Australia which they lost 1-2 and 0-3 ? however, thinks the team is moving in the right direction under new coach Bob Woolmer. 

?My advice to the players is to remain confident and relaxed and just to enjoy the cricket,? he said. (Reuters)

 Australia are ready for spin: Gilchrist

 - ?Clarke is in contention for debut in Bangalore? 

 Adam Gilchrist 

Mumbai: Australian stand-in captain Adam Gilchrist said the experience of playing Mumbai spinners would benefit the squad in good stead when they face the square up against the redoubtable Indian spin duo of Harbhajan Singh and Anil Kumble in the Test series starting in Bangalore from Wednesday. 

?We had a quality time out in the middle against the spinners. Now it depends on how we take this lesson into the series. We have come with a game plan on tackling the Indian spinners. 

?It depends on how we execute it,? the left-handed batsman, who is shouldering the captain?s responsibility due to the injury-induced unavailability of Ricky Ponting, said on Saturday. 

Gilchrist said he was happy with his team?s outing against Ranji Trophy champions Mumbai, especially his top order batsmen?s ability to tackle the spinning ball, in the three-day match that ended in a draw on Saturday. 

?It was good to start the tour like this. We lost half a day due to rain. Otherwise, there could have been a result. Still we had a few good days here. We also got to do what we set out to do at the beginning. We are pretty happy,? the wicketkeeper-batsman said. after the match. 

Australia dominated Mumbai, taking a lead of 47 runs over the hosts, and then rattling up 207 for one in quick time in the second innings before the match ended. 

Gilchrist was also pleased with the way the two pace bowlers ? Glenn McGrath and Brett Lee ? bowled in the match. ?Both Glenn (McGrath) and Brett (Lee) are coming out of one-day cricket and we are pretty pleased with the way they bowled here. The more they bowl the better it would be for them,? he said. 

McGrath bagged four for 25 in 21.2 overs, while Lee grabbed two for 53 from 21. 

?We have the option of using Shane Watson as well,? he said in response to a question whether the allrounder, who was also among wickets, could be used as a stock bowler in the first Test in Bangalore. 

Gilchrist praised the batting of Justin Langer and Michael Clarke in the second innings and Matthew Hayden and Damien Martyn?s in the first. 

Talking about Clarke, he said the exciting youngster, yet to play in a Test, was well in contention to make his debut in Bangalore. 

?Clarke is in contention. He played pretty well. He did what he was asked to do. We have quite a few options (to fill up the slot left vacant by Ricky Ponting?s absence). Now we have to look at selecting a well-balanced team,? he concluded.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 ?Credit to my work ethic?

 - Mixed day for Kumble 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: For somebody ?accused? of not spinning 

the ball, Anil Kumble has spun quite a record: He has caught up with Kapil Dev?s 

India-best of 434 wickets. 

More to the point, he has done so in all of 41 Tests less. 

The journey, by the way, began at Old Trafford in the summer of 1990. 

?I suppose it?s my commitment and work ethic which 

has made a difference? Obviously, I?m very happy,? Kumble told The Telegraph, 

a couple of hours after drawing level with ?Paaji.? 

Asked if he would have preferred No. 435 too at the Eden, Kumble replied: ?Definitely? Now, I?ve got to look at the (two-Test) series in Bangladesh.? 

Kumble, though, didn?t dedicate his effort to any one individual. 

?I guess my wife (Chetna) and other members of my family need to be given some of the credit? The many well-wishers as well? Having said that, I wouldn?t like to make a dedication as such,? he remarked. 

Incidentally, Chetna and their infant son were present at the Eden and, in his moment of achievement, Kumble remembered where they were seated. 

While the first half of Thursday was memorable with a capital M, the afternoon brought disappointing news: Specifically, Kumble wasn?t picked for the three ODIs in Bangladesh. 

Instead, the selectors opted for Murali Kartik to keep Harbhajan Singh company. 

Just how disappointed, then, was he? 

?Disappointed at not playing Bangladesh? Given a chance, I would opt out?? was Kumble?s answer. 

Significantly, he insisted there were no plans to now focus wholly on Tests. 

?I haven?t thought on those lines? I?m not thinking of quitting limited overs cricket,? Kumble pointed out. 

He has 321 wickets in 259 ODIs. 

The year 2004 has, of course, been phenomenal for Kumble in Tests. With two remaining, he has already taken 64, well clear of the leaders? pack. 

Has he consciously been different this year? 

?Look, I don?t think I?ve done anything new? If anything, I?m just a year older,? Kumble signed off, as he prepared to leave for home town Bangalore. 

Celebrations, if any, are going to be spontaneous 

? not planned, as his bowling is.

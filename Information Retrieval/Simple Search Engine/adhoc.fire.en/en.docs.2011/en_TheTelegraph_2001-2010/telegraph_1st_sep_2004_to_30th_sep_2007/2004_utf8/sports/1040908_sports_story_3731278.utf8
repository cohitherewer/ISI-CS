 Ponting looking for historic double

 Ricky Ponting 

London: Australian captain Ricky Ponting is hoping to land the first leg of a historic double when the ICC Champions Trophy starts on Friday. 

Australia have never won the tournament, which has been played three times since 1998, something Ponting aims to put right over the next two-and-a-half weeks. 

Then he takes his men to India, where Australia have not won since 1969-70, for a four-match Test series which Ponting says could go down as one of the biggest-ever played. 

Steve Waugh was the last Australian captain to try and conquer what he called the last Frontier when he led his team to India in 2000-01 only to lose a pulsating series 1-2. 

Ponting said: It is going to be a huge series. The last series in India was the best one Ive played in and we should have won. The last Test went to late on the last day and we lost. 

But we have the got the side and the players to do well. We have played very well on the subcontinent in the last couple of years, we have come a long way and are a better team now playing in those conditions. 

Our result in Sri Lanka, where we won 3-0, was outstanding. I think that was the first time that had been achieved by a touring side and that gives us a lot of confidence. 

Before that potentially historic series Ponting is determined to land the one major honour to elude the Australians. 

We are pretty disappointed with the way we have played in the Champions Trophy, Ponting said. In the first two years we lost in the first round to India and we made the semi-final last time but got beaten by Sri Lanka. 

This is the second biggest one-day tournament and while we have managed to win the last couple of World Cups, it would be nice to win the Champions Trophy as well and if we perform our skills well we should be in the mix. 

First up for Australia are the US in Southampton on Monday, followed by arch-rivals New Zealand at The Oval next Thursday. 

They are expected to beat the Americans easily but Ponting may pay them the compliment of watching some tapes of their past performances before trying to blow them away. 

He added: We might have some videos and Ill have a bit of a look. Our preparation is always very thorough. We are always going flat out trying to improve and make us better as individuals and as a team. 

When we play one of the smaller countries we try to finish the game off as quickly as we can. If we perform our skills as well as we can then games should finish early and we will be hoping to do that in the first game against the US. 

Australias biggest problem would seem to be the make-up of their bowling attack with Brett Lee, Jason Gillespie, Michael Kasprowicz and Glenn McGrath competing for just three places. 

We can only play three of those at one time, Ponting said. There are going to be some tough selections and one of them will miss out. You cant play them all, so youve just got to make a tough pick.

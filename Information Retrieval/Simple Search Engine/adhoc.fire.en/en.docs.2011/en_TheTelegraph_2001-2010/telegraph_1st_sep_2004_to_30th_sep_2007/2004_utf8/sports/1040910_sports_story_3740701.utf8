The Telegraph - Calcutta

 We?ve a proud record in meet: Dravid

 - Dinesh Karthik in the frame for a berth against Kenya tomorrow 

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI 

Southampton: Kenya did make the 2003 World 

Cup semi-finals, but nobody expects them to do a repeat in the biggest tournament 

outside that quadrennial showpiece ? the Champions Trophy, which begins on Friday. 

However, Indian captain Sourav Ganguly isn?t taking Saturday?s match here lightly. 

Speaking before Thursday afternoon?s nets, he emphasised: ?It?s going to be an important game as some of our batsmen and bowlers need a handsome outing to gain in confidence? Somebody like Virender Sehwag, for example?? 

That?s a reasonable point. Actually, vice-captain Rahul Dravid mirrored that, while adding: ?Our record in the tournament is a proud one? So, for us, there?s plenty to play for.? 

India are the joint-holders with Sri Lanka and also reached the final of the Champions Trophy?s precursor ? the ICC KnockOut, four years ago. 

According to Dravid, one-off situations suit India: ?After all, on any given day, we can be as good as anybody else? I know we haven?t done well in recent weeks, but Sunday?s win at Lord?s (over England) has put us in a better frame of mind.? 

Briefly talking about bagging the two most coveted awards presented by the ICC, two days ago, he said: ?It has sunk in? Definitely? But, today, I have a new goal and the team has a fresh challenge? At this moment, I?m not looking beyond the match against Kenya.? 

Meanwhile, according to The Telegraph?s sources, 

a rethink of sorts has seen specialist wicketkeeper Dinesh Karthik come into the 

frame. He was fielded at Lord?s, but that was viewed as a one-off happening. 

Now, it appears Karthik is reasonably well-placed to keep wearing the big gloves and won?t be ?penalised? for missing the team bus prior to the day?s workout. The youngster got the departure time from the hotel wrong and, very embarrassed could only make it to the lovely Rose Bowl a good 45 minutes after the rest. 

Incidentally, as the team sponsor?s logo is just allowed 

on the shirts, the Indians had to fold their trousers/shorts during the nets. 

?From tomorrow, a tape will be put,? informed manager Goutam Das Gupta.

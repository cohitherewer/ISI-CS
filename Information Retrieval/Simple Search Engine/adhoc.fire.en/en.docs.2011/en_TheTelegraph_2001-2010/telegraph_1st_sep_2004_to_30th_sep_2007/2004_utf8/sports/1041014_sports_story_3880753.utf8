The Telegraph - Calcutta

 David Collier new ECB chief

London: David Collier was named as the new England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) chief executive on Wednesday, replacing Tim Lamb. 

Lamb, who had been in the job since the ECB?s inception in 1997, resigned in May but stepped down last month. 

?I am delighted to have been offered the opportunity to lead the ECB at such an important point in the game?s history,? said Collier, who has been acting as chief executive for Nottinghamshire. He takes over during a difficult period for the ECB, with political strife in Zimbabwean cricket still having ramifications on the English game. 

The England team, who forfeited a World Cup match in Zimbabwe last year because of the players? concerns over security and alleged human rights abuses, are to tour the country next month for five one-day Internationals. 

Collier, however, deflected questions about Zimbabwe, and said the ECB had already said it would tour the country. Zimbabwe?s board has also become embroiled in a bitter dispute with a group of white players who have made allegations of racism influencing selection. 

Collier told a news conference at Lord?s that England would only have pulled out over security concerns or if the British Government had ordered them not to go, adding: ?The board took the best possible advice... and made the collective decision to go.? 

He added that he would probably not begin his duties until the end of the year and any further decisions would be made by the board, guided by acting chief executive Hugh Morris.

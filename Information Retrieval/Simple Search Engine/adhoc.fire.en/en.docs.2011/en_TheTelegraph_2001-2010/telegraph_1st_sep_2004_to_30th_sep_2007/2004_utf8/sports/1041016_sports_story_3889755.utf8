 Ponting hails Warne

 Ponting

Melbourne: Shane Warne was hailed as one of the sport?s all-time greats by his captain Ricky Ponting after the leg spinner became Test cricket?s highest wicket-taker on Friday. Warne surpassed Sri Lankan Muttiah Muralidharan?s mark of 532 wickets by dismissing Irfan Pathan in the second Test against India in Chennai. 

?He is one of the all-time greats. What he has done not only for cricket in Australia but for spin bowling worldwide has been remarkable,? said Ponting, who is in Sydney recovering from a broken finger. 

Warne briefly shared the record with off-spinner Muralidharan in July with 527 wickets. 

Muralidharan has not played since August after having a shoulder operation but former Australia captain and leg spinner Richie Benaud expected the Sri Lankan to reclaim the record. 

?It?s a great performance by Warnie to become the leading wicket-taker but I believe Murali will challenge again,? Benaud said. ?He (Muralidharan) has had a similar shoulder operation to Warne and I believe he?ll come back fully fit,? Benaud, now a television commentator, added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Paes-Rikl finishes 2nd best

 - US OPEN - Heartbreak in mixed doubles semi-finals 

New Delhi: Leander Paes had a mixed day at the US Open on Friday. The Indian Davis Cup star and his Czech partner David Rikl advanced to the men?s doubles final but failed to make the mixed doubles title-round in Martina Navratilova?s company. 

Leander Paes and David Rikl had to be content with 

the runners-up trophy in the mens doubles when they lost to the third seeds, 

Mark Knowles of Bahamas and Daniel Nestor of Canada 3-6, 3-6 in the final on Friday. 

According to information received here, the 13th-seeded duo of Paes and Rikl beat Spain?s Rafael Nadal and Tommy Robredo 6-3, 6-3 Thursday afternoon. In the final, Paes and Rikl will take on third seeds Mark Knowles (Bahamas) and Daniel Nestor (Canada), who edged out the French pair of Julien Benneteau and Nicolas Mahut 7-6 (7/5), 7-6 (7/5). 

The Indian?s dream of going for a rare double crown at Flushing Meadow was shattered in the evening session when he and American legend Navratilova lost a three-set thriller to Todd Woodbridge and Alicia Molik. The eighth-seeded Australian pair won 6-4, 3-6, 7-6 (7-3). 

It was sweet revenge for Woodbridge as he and Jonas Bjorkman, the top seeds, had suffered a three-straight defeat at Paes-Rikl?s hands in the third round. 

Pair?s maiden entry 

A Staff Reporter in Calcutta adds: This was the best result for Paes and Rikl, who have been playing together for the last two years. They have three Tour titles as a pair, but never before did they manage a Grand Slam title-round entry. Their best was a semi-final showing, at the 2003 French Open. 

Paes, who now has 10 Grand Slam final appearances, would be gunning for his seventh major doubles title. Of his six Slam triumphs thus far, three have come in men?s doubles and three in mixed. 

All three previous men?s doubles titles have come in the company of Mahesh Bhupathi, two in mixed doubles were with Navratilova and one with Lisa Raymond. 

Of the three times he tripped at the final hurdle, 

two were in 1999 with Bhupathi. (PTI)

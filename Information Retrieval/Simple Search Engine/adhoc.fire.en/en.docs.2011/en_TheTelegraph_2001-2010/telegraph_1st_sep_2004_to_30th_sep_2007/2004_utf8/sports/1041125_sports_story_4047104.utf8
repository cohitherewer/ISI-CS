The Telegraph - Calcutta

 School meet for a cause

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Leprosy isn?t a thing of the past in Calcutta. While polio is definitely on its way out, leprosy, an age-old curse, is going strong. According to city-based doctor Faiyaz Alam, just one hospital, near Manicktala, sees 160 new cases each week. The statistics for the country are scary. 

To this effect, The Leprosy Mission, Calcutta, is organising a six-a-side inter-school cricket meet (in its third edition) involving 12 teams on Friday and Saturday. The idea is to raise funds for the Mission. There is s modest expectation of Rs 1 lakh being generated, though at this point the figures aren?t adding up to that. 

The teams will play in a knockout preliminary stage, qualifying into the quarter finals. Last year?s champions MP Birla School isn?t around because of examinations, but runners-up Birla High School will play. 

All matches will be held at St James? ground. 

A basketball tournament, for the same cause, will be held at the same venue, alongside the cricket meet. 

Minor sponsors in New York Max Life, National Insurance and Dendrite have confirmed. Each team pays an entry fee of Rs 1,000. 

The participating teams: St James?, La Martiniere Boys, National Gems (James Long branch), Saifee Hall, St Thomas? Kidderpore, St Thomas? Free School Street and St Thomas? Howrah, Birla High School, St Xavier?s Collegiate School, Don Bosco Park Circus, Assembly of God Church and St Augustine?s.

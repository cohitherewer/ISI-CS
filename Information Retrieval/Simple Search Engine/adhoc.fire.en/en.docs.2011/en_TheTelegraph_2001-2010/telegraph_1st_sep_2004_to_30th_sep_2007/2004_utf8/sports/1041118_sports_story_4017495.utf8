 Chinese goalie tests positive

Beijing: Liaoning goalkeeper Liu Jiansheng, who is also linked to a match-fixing scandal in Chinese football, has tested positive for the use of recreational drugs, state press said on Wednesday. 

The anti-doping commission of the Chinese Olympic Committee (COC) said he had returned positive tests for amphetamine and methyl amphetamine. Liu was tested by China?s sports doping agency after he let in all five goals in the 1-5 loss to Dalian Shide on September 26. 

The China Football Association (CFA) was notified that his A sample tested positive on October 26. ?Liu?s B sample also turned positive,? a COC told Xinhua news agency. 

The COC official refused to comment on how severe the punishment would be, only saying that it was under the jurisdiction of the CFA. It was the second doping case for a Chinese player this year. Liu had initially said the positive test was a result of ?using drugs to cure his pulmonary disease?. 

?His explanation is groundless as his urine sample showed traces of amphetamine and methyl amphetamine,? said Lu Feng, general manager of Liaoning Zhongyu. 

According to Lu, Liu left the Shenyang-based club in late October, citing ?health problems?. ?Nobody knows where Liu now is. Our news about Liu all came from a relative of him,? said Lu. ?Whatever the result of B sample is, and whatever the punishment he faces, Liu will not play football any longer,? his brother was quoted as saying.

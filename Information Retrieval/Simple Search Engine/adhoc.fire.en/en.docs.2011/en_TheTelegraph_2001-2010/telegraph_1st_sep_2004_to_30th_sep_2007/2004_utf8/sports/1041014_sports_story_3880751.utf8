Chennai: If the battle on the field is proving to be exciting, the war of words off it is becoming murkier by the day. 

Glenn McGrath had fired the first salvo and Harbhajan Singh has been quick to retaliate. 

The off-spinner is ?surprised? by Glenn McGrath?s allegation that he went scot-free with his barrage of abuses during the first Test in Bangalore. 

?I?m surprised that it has come from someone called Glenn McGrath who has been admonished in the past by the International Cricket Council for his behaviour against Ramnaresh Sarwan. Even Sachin Tendulkar and Brian Lara have been at the receiving end of McGrath?s vitriol,? Harbhajan said on Wednesday. 

?I have played my cricket the hard way all my life, and the harder it becomes, the more I enjoy it,? he sounded a note of warning for the visitors ahead of the second Test. 

McGrath has been quoted by the media back home as saying: ?You can?t take his statistics away from him, he?s done pretty well against us. But he doesn?t mind having a chat, especially when he?s just gotten a batsman out. A lot of times I think if that was one of us, there might be a bit more done about it.? 

Adam Gilchirst, however, said that he did not face any untoward comment from Harbhajan during his innings in Bangalore. ?I didn?t get involved with any discussion with anyone out there,? the stand-in captain said. 

?We know Harbhajan is a lively and passionate cricketer and draws a lot of inspiration from himself being fired up. He is not the first player we?ve come across and there are many players in our team who play in a similar fashion. 

?It?s inevitable in something that we too are passionate about, and that there?s going to be some sort of conflict out there on the field. Hopefully, things will be monitored closely and we can get on with it.? 

The normally cool off-spinner, who finished with 11 wickets in the first Test, is not the one to be cowed down by such remarks from McGrath. ?If they wish to create a mental block, it will definitely not help them,? Harbhajan countered. ?If they are ready with one, I?ll be ready with ten.? 

McGrath and Co. better watch out. The mind games are here to stay.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Depleted Mohun Bagan look to regain lead

 - Ever-Ready coach wishes to settle a personal account 

A STAFF REPORTER

 Jo Paul Ancheri could be used in a dual role 

Calcutta: Mohun Bagan will be looking to snatch back their top position in the current CFL Super Division League when they meet Ever-Ready Association at the Kalyani Municipal Stadium, Thursday. 

That won?t be easy, though. Mohun Bagan are on 35 points after 16 matches, but East Bengal, with their 4-0 rout of Tollygunge Agragami Tuesday, have already moved to 36 points, also from 16 matches. Add to that the fact that they take on a problem team in Ever-Ready, this year?s major surprise, and that the ?outsiders? have already beaten the green-maroons (1-0) this year. 

And if all that weren?t enough, injuries, bookings and national team duty isn?t allowing a decent complement of players for coach Subrata Bhattacharya. 

Bhattacharya isn?t saying much, but told The Telegraph over phone from Kalyani that the team situation wasn?t too good, but the last defeat to Ever-Ready (Eugene Gray scoring the winner) is definitely not playing on their minds. ?We are not worrying about that at all,? he said. ?That chapter is in the past.? 

But look at the team roster. Stars Ashim Biswas, Jerry Zirsanga, Tomba Singh and Prasanta Dora are in Oman doing national duty. Dharamjit Singh?s injury makes his inclusion in the first XI ?unlikely.? 

Top defender, Brazilian Eduardo Coelho ?won?t be able to play?, because of the knee injury he picked up in the Durand meet. Sunil Chhetri and Rishi Kapoor are back from Delhi, ?but Rishi is out with two yellow cards, and Sunil has a fever. I am not sure I?ll be able to play him.? 

Nigerian James Ugwo ?is out because we cannot use an on lien player from the same league (James has been taken from Kidderpore). 

What does that leave Bhattacharya with? 

Roberto Mendes Silva ?Beto?, the Paolo in the Mohun Bagan ranks, so to say, should be in the attack. Palash Karmakar?s groin strain showing signs of recovery, he should be around a little deep, Manitombi Singh will be there to keep the citadel from crumbling, and Mehraj ud-din Wadao?s loping runs could be useful. 

The big inclusion could be of Jo Paul Ancheri. If he plays, he will be seen in the Bagan jersey after almost a decade. ?I am yet to decide on how to play Ancheri, if he does play,? said Bhattacharya, but indications are that he could be used as a defensive screen as well as a withdrawn attacker. 

This is probably because Ancheri has in his career played in all positions except in the goal. 

The goal will be manned by Subrata Pal, who was quite a hit in the Durand meet. 

Ever-Ready coach Aloke Mukherjee said: ?The last victory was a good one, but we will not rest on our laurels, and my boys are ready to give their best Thursday. The only thing to be remembered that the team we will play is Mohun Bagan. 

?Whatever their condition, whoever is injured and booked out or out on national duty, the jersey does matter.? 

Eugene will be playing and there is also this small personal account to settle. ?The way I came out of Mohun Bagan, I believe this little bit is due to me. My team has already secured third position, and all we can do is better that,? he said.

Calcutta: When East Bengal began their campaign at the ASEAN Cup last year, their initial target was to reach the quarter finals. They surpassed all expectations and won the title. At the AFC Cup, they began with the same mission. But can they repeat the feat? 

?AFC Cup is a tougher tournament. The teams from Arab countries play a different blend of football,? East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick said after practice on Tuesday morning. 

Bhowmick?s agenda, therefore, is clear. ?My sole objective would be to ensure they don?t get any away goal advantage.? 

The Arab team in context is Syria?s Al Jaish ? the group C toppers. And East Bengal are giving the quarter final tie on Wednesday every ounce of significance it deserves. ?Everybody is saying the wet ground would help us. Take it from me, it will not. The ground will be to their advantage, their strong builds the clinching factor,? Bhowmick admitted. 

Al Jaish?s Romanian coach Costica Stefanescu gave weight to Bhowmick?s words. ?The technical rivalry will not be so important. Given the condition of the ground, we have to run more, fight more. It?s very difficult to work out a strategy,? he said. ?I would be happy to go with a draw.? 

East Bengal?s source of good physique ? their foreign firepower ? is not giving Bhowmick the boost either. As per the AFC rules, East Bengal could play three overseas recruits. 

The coach opted for Ghanaian Suley Musah, Brazilian Douglas da Silva and decided to wait for the other Brazilian, Paolo Roberto da Silva?s transfer documents to arrive. But with Paolo?s registration almost certainly ruled out, chances of playing him look bleak. The coach had only the officials to blame on the Paolo fiasco, calling them ?callous? and ?stupid?. 

The in-form defender Louis Aniweta cannot even be considered. Douglas, who was diagnosed with a muscle tear in his left ankle on Monday, seemed to be in much better shape. In fact, he was practising hard this morning. Though Bhowmick wouldn?t divulge his team plans, leaving the decision to ?not before 1 pm on Wednesday?, it?s very likely that Douglas will take the field against Al Jaish. 

Musah, on the other hand, has just played one match this season ? a Super Division tie against Tollygunge. 

?Beggars cannot be choosers,? Bhowmick quipped. ?We will have to begin on the defensive and depend on counter-attacks.? One problem, however, lurks in this horizon. There is no Mike Okoro, no Cristiano Junior and no Bhaichung Bhutia upfront ? on whose game-making skills Bhowmick could have depended last season. To find the target from these counter-attacks would be Bijen Singh, whose prowess as a striker cannot be vouched for. 

East Bengal?s weakness in this department is something their coach is ready to admit. ?My biggest problem is that I don?t have a striker,? Bhowmick said. Of course, the Indian captain Bhaichung has been ruled out with an injury. 

Indications are that Rajat Ghosh Dastidar might be preferred over Sangram Mukherjee under the bar. Sangram did the duty for East Bengal during the Mohun Bagan derby on Saturday. Bijen will play as the sole striker with Alvito D?Cunha operating from behind. 

Debjit Ghosh was still suffering from breathing problems and if he doesn?t recover, Madhab Das will take his place.Bhowmick has watched Al Jaish practice on two consecutive days. Did he mark out their striker Zyad Shaabou? ?Their Shaabou is no Mike Okoro,? Bhowmick concluded. 

Stefanescu, however, had a special mention for the Syrian striker. ?He is my No. 1 and he just loves to score goals,? he said. 

Without a single foreigner in his team, Stefanescu also lost the services of star midfielder Feraz Ismail. Ismail missed the flight to India because of his national engagements and was due to arrive on the morning of the match. The coach, however, thought it wise to omit him: ?He would be out of match practice and it would be immensely difficult for him.?

Mumbai: Justin Langer sent out an ominous warning to the Indian bowlers ahead of the Test series with a scintillating century as the three-day warm-up match between Australia and Ranji Trophy champions Mumbai ended in a tame draw on Saturday. 

Langer retired after making 108 with two sixes and 12 fours, after Glenn McGrath?s four-wicket haul helped the visitors bowl out Mumbai for 255, in reply to Australia?s 302 for seven declared in the first innings. The Australians finished the day at a strong 207 for one, to take an overall lead of 254 runs when play was called off by mutual agreement after the first of 15 mandatory overs into the last hour of play. 

Batting at the crease were Brad Hodge (29) and Simon Katich (7). 

It was Langer who personified Australia?s domination over the match as he toyed with the Mumbai spin attack with ease in the only warm-up game for the tourists ahead of the four-Test series against India commencing on October 6. 

Langer, who put on a breezy stand of 142 for the first wicket with makeshift opener Michael Clarke, completed his century off 149 balls in just over three hours. He raced to his half century in 63 balls with nine hits to the fence. 

The only time the 34-year-old left-hander looked in some spot of bother was when he faced Ajit Agarkar, who got rid off him in the first innings. 

Clarke also spent some valuable time in the middle, using his feet well to tackle the spinning ball in his 145-minute stay studded with eight hits to the fence, before he was declared caught at short leg off Ramesh Powar by umpire T.K. Handu, though the batsman indicated the ball had gone off his hip. 

Earlier, McGrath warmed up nicely for the Test series snaring three top order Mumbai batsmen in his superb figures of four for 25 in hot and humid conditions. 

The fast bowler made light of the slowness of the pitch with sustained spells of fast bowling to help the visitors bundle out the Ranji Trophy champions soon after lunch, 47 runs short of the Australian tally, after the hosts had resumed at their overnight 150 for four. 

He started the slide of Mumbai?s first innings, trapping overnight batsman Amol Muzumdar leg before for 52, off the eighth ball of the day. 

McGrath added the wicket of last man Avishkar Salvi, who was clean bowled, in the post-lunch session to terminate the Mumbai innings 12 minutes into the second session. Brett Lee, wicketless on Friday, finished with two, while Shane Watson also picked up two wickets. 

The fact that McGrath ? who had played only two Tests following his lengthy post-surgery lay-off ? ran through the Mumbai top order, accounting for three of the top four batsmen, must have pleased the Aussie team management. 

The pace bowler?s victims were openers Wasim Jaffer and Vinayak Mane, Amol Muzumdar and Salvi. 

With Muzumdar?s dismissal, who added only two runs to his overnight score, Mumbai lost three quick wickets in the morning session, before some useful contribution from Ajit Agarkar, who made 37 with six fours, bailed them out. 

Vinayak Samant and Nilesh Kulkarni helped the home team cross 250, after the team was struggling at 179 for seven before the end of the first hour of play. (PTI)

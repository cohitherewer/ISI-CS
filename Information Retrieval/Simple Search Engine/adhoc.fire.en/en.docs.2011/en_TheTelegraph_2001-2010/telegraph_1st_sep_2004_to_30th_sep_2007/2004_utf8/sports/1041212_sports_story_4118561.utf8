 Pak stars laud Sachin

 Javed Miandad 

New Delhi: Former Pakistan cricketers Saturday hailed Sachin Tendulkar for equalling Sunil Gavaskar?s world record of 34 Test centuries and described him as a ?legend? of contemporary cricket. 

?It?s no small achievement. Sachin has proved to the world that he is the best player. After a long gap, maybe after Sunil Gavaskar, India has produced such a great player,? former captain Javed Miandad said. 

?His performance speaks for him. We should understand it is legendary,? he said. 

Former captain Waqar Younis said one cannot doubt the quality of a player like Sachin after accumulating such huge scores. ?If any batsman scores so many runs definitely he has some quality. There is no doubt about it that he is one of the best players today.? 

Mushtaq Ahmed said he was most impressed by Sachin?s undiminished hunger for runs. 

?I think he is the best player because he has still maintained his hunger for runs. As a cricketer, I can tell that a situation comes when this hunger for runs dies but Sachin wants to do it again and again. He has tremendous concentration and still does not give his wicket easily.? 

Former opening batsman Saeed Anwar said: ?He is one of the top-class players. But I rate Gavaskar as the best Indian player, the reason being the class of bowling he played during his time.

 Punters protest falls on deaf RCTC ears 

 STAR RACER

 Amil

 Calcutta: Punters 

 at the RCTC ground vehemently protested on Wednesday when 

 Joy Of Living was declared the winner of the Flower Dust 

 Handicap, which they thought was claimed by Karans Choice, 

 the 7-4 course favourite. 

 The punters protest was based on facts that the race commentator had pronounced Karans Choice as the winner and also that S. Shanker, the jockey of the fravourite was congratulated by Imran Chisty who was on a beaten horse. To make matters worse, the digital telecast all over the country also carried numerical order highlighting Karans Choice as a winner. 

 Hell broke loose as 3000-odd punters screamed for justice but the turf authorities struck to their decision because they firmly believed that the camera does not lie. Punters also demanded a photograph of the finish be displayed but RCTC could provide it only after an hour. Such pictures in the past were produced in minutes but the inordinate delay left punters doubting the authenticity of the picture.

 To the RCTCs discomfiture, lightning had struck in close proximity of the course, leaving its telecommunication and cabling facilities defunct. What happened was unfortunate after lightning had crippled our telecommuncation system and a series of things went wrong. We are taking remedial measures to ensure such things are not repeated, said Boman Parakh, secretary, RCTC.

 Racing, otherwise, was very enjoyable during the afternoon, though favourites failed in masses leaving the lower order to rule. Anokato, from Daniel Davids yard, brought about the biggest upset when Md Amil guided the horse to victory in the Roubaix Cup.

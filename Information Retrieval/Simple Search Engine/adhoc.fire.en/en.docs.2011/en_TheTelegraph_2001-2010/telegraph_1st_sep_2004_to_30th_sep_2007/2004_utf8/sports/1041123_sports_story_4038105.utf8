 Sehwag, Gambhir on an early roll

 Kumble finished with six for 131 

Kanpur: Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir cracked rollicking half centuries as India hit back with a record opening partnership to restore the balance in the first Test against South Africa here on Monday. 

The two openers set the Green Park ablaze with their fireworks to propel India to 185 for no loss in response to South Africa?s 510 for nine declared on a fog-hit third day. 

The two Delhi batsmen not only recorded the highest-ever opening partnership against South Africa but also the highest opening partnership at the Green Park on a highly entertaining day which saw play start late because of a dense fog. 

Gambhir notched up his maiden Test half-century and was batting on 85 while Sehwag was giving him company on an equally belligerent 85 at stumps. 

Play was called off 54 minutes before the revised time of closure due to bad light. 

This was India?s highest opening partnership since the Multan Test against Pakistan and the first time the opening stand crossed the 50 mark in the last six tests since then. The pair erased the previous 90-run opening record against South Africa between Vikram Rathore and Nayan Mongia in Johannesburg in 1996-97. 

The unbroken stand also took them to the record books as the highest opening partnership at the Green Park erasing Devang Gandhi and Sadagopan Ramesh?s 162 against New Zealand in 1999-2000. 

The start of the third day?s proceedings was delayed by two hours because of a thick fog but Sehwag and Gambhir enthralled the noisy home crowd with some entertaining cricket in the two extended sessions. 

Both the Indian openers seemed to be in no discomfort on a lifeless track as they blunted out the South African pacers Shaun Pollock and Makhaya Ntini and then plundered runs at will against spinner Robin Peterson who hardly could make much of an impression. 

Sehwag was in fine nick exhibiting his trademark cover drive and was severe on the loose balls while Gambhir was more circumspect in the initial stages before outpacing his senior partner. 

The two openers brought 50 on the board in 14.5 overs and then brought about the century partnership in 25.4 overs, maintaing a run-rate of more than four runs an over. 

Earlier, resuming at the overnight score of 459 for seven, South Africa were on the lookout for quick runs when play started after a delay of two hours due to a dense fog. 

The hosts removed overnight batsman Tsolekile (9) in the very second over of the day with vetern leg-spinner Anil Kumble trapping him leg before to claim his 430th Test scalp. 

Kumble emerged the pick of the Indian bowlers with figures of six for 131, claiming his 28th five-wicket haul in Tests. 

The Karnataka bowler is now one wicket away from equalling the Test tally of New Zealand?s Richard Hadlee and needs just five more wickets to eclipse Kapil Dev?s record of 434 wickets and become India?s highest wickettaker. 

Pollock also hit some delightful strokes as the visitors made a determined bid to accelerate the pace of scoring. 

The total was South Africa?s highest ever on Indian 

soil, erasing the previous best of 479 recorded in Bangalore during the 2000-01 

series.

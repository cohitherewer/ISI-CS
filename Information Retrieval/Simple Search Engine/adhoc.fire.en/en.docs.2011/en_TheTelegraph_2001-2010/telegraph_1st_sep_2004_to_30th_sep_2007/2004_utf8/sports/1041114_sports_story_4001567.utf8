The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sport

 Sunday, November 14, 2004 

 Nyon: Inter Milan striker Adriano has been suspended for two Champions League games after his sending-off against Valencia last week.

 The Brazilian international was dismissed for violent conduct in the last moments of the group G match which ended 0-0. The ban, imposed by Uefa?s control and disciplinary body, rules him out of Inter?s remaining group matches away to Werder Bremen on November 24 and home to Anderlecht on December 7.

 London: Former England, Leicester City and Chelsea forward Keith Weller has died after a long illness. He was 58. Weller, remembered fondly by Leicester fans for once wearing a pair of white tights in a Cup game, won four international caps in the 1970s, scoring once. ?Keith was one of the club?s all-time greats and he will be sadly missed,? Leicester said in a statement.

 La Paz: Bolivia were on the point of pulling out of their trip to Washington for Saturday?s friendly against Guatemala after players demanded more money at the airport and threatened not to board the plane.

 ?The strange thing is that the request was made when the squad was about to get on the plane at Viru Viru airport in Santa Cruz,? Bolivia Football Federation (FBF) president Walter Castedo told reporters. ?They had initially agreed $500 (per player) but they demanded $1,000.?

 Tbilisi: Georgian police have arrested a man after he tried to sell a bronze soccer ball stolen from the gravestone of one of Georgia?s most popular players.

 A police spokesman said on Friday that Shukri Aroshidze was detained after he tried to sell the 67-kg ball to a scrap metal yard for 40 lari ($20). Aroshidze admitted that he had stolen the ball from the grave of former Soviet and Dinamo Tbilisi striker Mikhail Meskhi.

 London: Fulham have failed to win damages from former manager Jean Tigana in a High Court case that could cost the club more than ?4 million ($7.4 million).

 The Premier League club, owned by Mohamed Al Fayed, had alleged that Tigana had overpaid more than ?7 million for new players and had negotiated transfers in secret, in breach of his contractual duty to the club.

 ?I consider that the defendant has behaved properly and conscientiously in his dealings with Fulham and did not act dishonourably towards the club,? Justice Elias said in his judgement.

 Moscow: Lokomotiv Moscow claimed the Russian title on the final day of the premier league season with a 2-0 win at Shinnik Yaroslavl on Friday.

 Diniyar Bilyaletdinov and Dmitry Sychev scored in the first 20 minutes to power Lokomotiv to their second premier league crown in three years.

 Durban: The chief executive of the Border Cricket Board Reunert Bauser is being investigated for misappropriation of funds.

 BCB president Vido Mgadle said the board?s offices had been raided by an elite police unit on Thursday in connection with ?allegations of misappropriation of funds that have been levelled against our chief executive, Reunert Bauser?.

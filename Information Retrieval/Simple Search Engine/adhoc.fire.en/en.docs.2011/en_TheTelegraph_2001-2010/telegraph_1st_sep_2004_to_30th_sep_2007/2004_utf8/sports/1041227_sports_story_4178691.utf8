Melbourne: Stand-in captain Yusuf Youhana led from the front with a century on Sunday as Pakistan reached 318 for six on the first day of the second Test against Australia. 

Rebounding from their crushing 491-run loss in the first Test, Pakistan showed greater resolve on the lower, slower Melbourne Cricket Ground pitch than they had on last week?s bouncy conditions in Perth. 

Leading his country for only the second time in his 55-Test career, Youhana scored his 12th century off 117 balls, finishing on 111 when he was stumped down the leg side off the bowling of Shane Warne at 286 for four. 

Youhana batted for 3-3/4 hours, hitting 11 fours and four sixes from 134 balls to record his first century against Australia before a crowd of 61,552. 

The 30-year-old righthander dominated a 192-run stand with Younis Khan (87) after Pakistan had lost three wickets for nine runs shortly after lunch. 

The partnership was a record fourth-wicket stand for Pakistan against Australia, beating the 177 by Saeed Anwar and Youhana in Brisbane five years ago. 

?This is very special for me, to make a 100 against this bowling attack. Also it?s a very good batting pitch,? Youhana told a news conference. 

?Inzamam (the injured captain) is always the best player in the team. He is not playing and there is a lot of responsibility on me as acting captain.? 

After Pakistan won the toss and elected to bat, 20-year-old opener Salman Butt scored his maiden half-century in his third Test, hitting 70 from 99 balls. 

Pacer Jason Gillespie (three for 72) took two wickets in successive overs late in the day?s play as Australia regained some momentum. 

Butt, who hit 10 fours, was dropped by Matthew Hayden at gully in the first over of the morning bowled by Glenn McGrath. 

Imran Farhat (20) put on 85 for the first wicket with Butt, 13 runs more than Pakistan?s second innings total in the first Test. 

Farhat was caught at second slip by Australia captain Ricky Ponting off the bowling of Michael Kasprowicz. 

Pakistan were 93 for one at lunch but Australia hit back when Gillespie had Yasir Hameed leg before for two in the first over after lunch. Butt was run out in the next over. 

Pakistan signalled their intentions from the outset to regain credibility. Butt, dropped by Hayden on two off the third ball of the Test, paid for a lazily-taken second run when he narrowly failed to beat home a throw from Michael Clarke at backward point and was out for 70 soon after lunch. The 20-year-old left-hander batted for 130 minutes and 99 balls. 

Youhana was also dropped by Hayden, who spilled a head-high chance at gully when the batsman was on 43. 

After Warne (1 for 100) dismissed Youhana at 286 for four, Younis fell 12 runs later, caught behind by Adam Gilchrist after edging a leg cutter from Gillespie. 

Gillespie struck again when Ponting took a juggling catch at second slip to remove Shoaib Malik for six at 301 for six. Inzamam and pacer Mohammed Khalil were replaced in the Pakistan side by Hameed and Malik. 

Australia named an unchanged side after opening batsman Justin Langer passed a fitness test on his injured back.

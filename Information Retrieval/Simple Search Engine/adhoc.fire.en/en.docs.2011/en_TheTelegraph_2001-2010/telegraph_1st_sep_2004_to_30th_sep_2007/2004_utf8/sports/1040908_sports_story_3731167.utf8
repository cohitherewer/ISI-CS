 Vijai Singh on top of the world

Norton: Fijis majestic Vijai Singh took over as world No. 1 from playing partner Tiger Woods after winning the Deutsche Bank Championship by three strokes at the Tournament Players Club of Boston on Monday. 

Singh and Woods finished with identical 69s after their showdown but the Fijian had done enough in the earlier rounds as he finished on 16-under-par to eclipse the deposed Woods and defending champion Adam Scott, who tied for second on 13-under. 

The 41-year-old Singh, the hottest player of the last 14 months, clinched his sixth PGA Tour title this season, the biggest haul of his career, and his 10th since the start of last year. My focus today was really winning the golf meet and I didnt get out of focus, said a jubilant Singh. I was very patient, that was the key. 

Asked how it felt to be the world No. 1, he remarked: Its great and I cant wait to celebrate. I thought I was playing good enough to be No. 1 for a while, but obviously the ranking, I kept telling you guys (reporters), I cant do anything about the ranking. 

Finally, its turned in my favour. So, I dont know how long the ranking is going to favour me or anybody else. But it feels great right now and Im really proud to achieve that. 

However, it was a roller-coaster final round as the Fijian took a four-shot lead with a birdie on the first hole that moved him to 15-under-par before his third bogey at the 14th left him level with Woods at 13-under until he pulled away again. 

Ive had a good run and (being No. 2) isnt too bad, is it? said Woods, trying to hide his disappointment. 

The Fijian became only the 12th man to own the world No. 1 ranking since its 1986 debut. He became the first golfer from outside the United States to own the top spot since South African Ernie Els in June 1998. 

Ive been putting great. My driving has been good. My whole golf game has been good, Singh said. I work on the putting range. If you do that its going to get grooved in. My driving I think thats the key. If you keep it in play and hit it long, its great.

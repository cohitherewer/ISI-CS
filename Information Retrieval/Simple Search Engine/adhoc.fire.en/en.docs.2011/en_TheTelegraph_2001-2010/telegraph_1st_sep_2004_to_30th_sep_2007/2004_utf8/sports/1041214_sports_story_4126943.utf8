The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Sourav credits it to Sachin, Pathan

 - Youngsters may get a chance in second Test, says Team India captain 

Dhaka: Team India skipper Sourav Ganguly attributed his team?s huge win over Bangladesh on Monday to outstanding performances by Sachin Tendulkar and Irfan Pathan. 

?He (Pathan) bowled pretty well,? Sourav said, praising the track at the Bangabandhu National Stadium after India thrashed the hosts by an innings and 140 runs. 

?It was a very good Test wicket. It helped the seamers and had some turn for the spinners as well. Even the batsmen could score runs if they put their heads down and focused on the job at hand.? 

The Indian captain said one or two youngsters in his team might get an opportunity in the second Test and the three one-dayers. 

?We had a thought about it. There are a couple of youngsters in the team, we need to give them an opportunity. We have not spoken about it but there is a possibility,? he said. 

Singling out the maestro, Sourav said, ?Sachin batted outstandingly well.? 

On his knock of 71, the Team India skipper said big scores had been eluding him for some time but he was happy to stitch a partnership when the team was struggling at 68 for three. 

?I have got some good starts but haven?t been able to convert these into big ones. But it was good to put a partnership when we were three down for 68,? he said. 

Bangladesh skipper Habibul Bashar blamed his team?s poor show on the failure of his top order. 

?The top order has failed to score runs. This is one area where we really need to improve,? he said. He also praised Irfan Pathan. 

The Indian seamer, however, said he concentrated on putting the ball in the right areas. 

?We got a very good wicket on the first day, the track was a bit damp and I just focused on putting the ball in the right areas,? Pathan said. 

?In the second innings, the wicket got a bit harder so I tried to bowl more bouncers to put the batsmen on the backfoot. Then I resumed bowling normally,? he said. (PTI)

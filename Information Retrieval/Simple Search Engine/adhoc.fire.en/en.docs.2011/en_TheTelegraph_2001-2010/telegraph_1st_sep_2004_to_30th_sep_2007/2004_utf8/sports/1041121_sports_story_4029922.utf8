The Telegraph - Calcutta

 A second state meet in 2 weeks

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: The ?battle? between the Table Tennis Federation of India (TTFI) and the Bengal Table Tennis Association (BTTA) has taken a new twist. Less than a week after the state body held the state championships at Netaji Indoor Stadium, another ?state? meet was announced on Saturday, to be held from Monday to Friday. 

The meet, dubbed the state and inter-district table tennis championship, will be held at the Children Park (Railways campus), Naihati, under the auspices of the TTFI and the SAI-based Centre of Excellence (CoE). 

Top-ranked national players like Soumyadeep Roy, Ranabir Das, Subham Chowdhury, Anirban Nandy, East Zone champion Subhajit Saha (top five seeds in men?s singles) as well as Poulami Ghatak, Mouma Das, Nandita Saha and Mantu Ghosh (top four seeds among women) will participate in the Naihati meet. 

All these players had skipped the BTTA-organised meet, which concluded last Tuesday. 

BTTA secretary Ashish Dutta questioned the validity of another state meet. 

?We had sought clarification from TTFI officials whether they had approved another state meet, but haven?t got any reply from them yet,? Dutta said on Saturday. ?Even the SAI has not approved this meet.? 

TTFI vice-president Prabir Mitra, however, insisted the national body does recognise the Naihati meet as a state championship. 

?Since the BTTA disaffiliation issue is sub-judice, we can?t stop them (the state body) from organising a state meet. But as far as the TTFI is concerned, the Naihati meet is also a state championship,? Mitra told a press conference on Saturday. 

Mitra maintained that plans are afoot to involve the BTTA into the TTFI?s project of setting up a national academy in the city.

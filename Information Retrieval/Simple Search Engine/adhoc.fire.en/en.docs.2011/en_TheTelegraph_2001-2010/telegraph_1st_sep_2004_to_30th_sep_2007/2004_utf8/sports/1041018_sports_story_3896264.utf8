Moscow: Anastasia Myskina trounced Elena Dementieva 7-5, 6-0 in the Kremlin Cup final on Sunday to retain her Moscow title in a rematch of their all-Russian French Open final earlier this year. 

After a close first set, with plenty of errors and poor serving from both sides, the third-seeded Myskina raced through the second against a hapless Dementieva in just 24 minutes. In Paris in June, Myskina crushed her close friend 6-1, 6-2 in less than an hour to become the first Russian woman to win a Grand Slam title. 

With her third title of the year, Myskina will move up one spot, to No. 3 in the world, behind Lindsay Davenport and Amelie Mauresmo. 

Mahesh-Jonas up 

Meanwhile, Mahesh Bhupathi and Jonas Bjorkman moved into the doubles final on Saturday. The top seeded Indo-Swedish pair overcame Zimbabwean duo Wayne Black and Kevin Ullyett 6-2, 7-6 (8-6) to set up a the title clash with Russians Ivor Andreev and Nikolay Davydenko, who were given a walkover from Czechs Leos Friedl and Radek Stepanek.

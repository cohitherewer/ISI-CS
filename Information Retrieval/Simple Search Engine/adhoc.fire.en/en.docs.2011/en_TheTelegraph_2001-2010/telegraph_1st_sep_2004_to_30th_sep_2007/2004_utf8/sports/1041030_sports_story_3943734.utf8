 Pak ride Younis ton

 Younis Khan in action in Karachi on Friday 

Karachi: Younis Khan hit his first Test century for two-and-a-half years on Friday and captain Inzamam-ul Haq struck an undefeated 79 as Pakistan took control of the second Test against Sri Lanka. 

The pair added 149 runs for the third wicket from 282 balls to propel Pakistan to 298 for four at stumps on the second day with a first innings lead of 90. 

Younis was caught at slip by Thilan Samaraweera off left-arm spinner Rangana Herath for 124, four overs before the close after a 215-ball innings containing 12 fours and a six. 

He also shared a second wicket stand of 122 in 175 balls with Imran Farhat (72). 

Sri Lanka took the second new ball immediately after Younis? dismissal and Chaminda Vaas bowled nightwatchman Riaz Afridi (9) to signal the end of play. 

The Sri Lankans, who won the first test of the two-match series in Faisalabad by 201 runs, were dismissed for 208 runs on the opening day. 

On Friday their bowlers had to toil for 46 overs after getting rid of Yasir Hameed (3) and Farhat before lunch before they got another wicket. 

Younis paced his innings perfectly and played Dilhara Fernando square after tea for two runs to reach his sixth Test hundred from 164 balls. 

It was his first century since he scored 153 against the West Indies at Sharjah in February 2002 in his first test since September last year. 

?This is perhaps the most valuable and memorable hundred for me in my career. I was under pressure in this match to perform and I came good,? said Younis. (REUTERS)

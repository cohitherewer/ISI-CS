The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Australia end 35-year wait on Indian soil

 - A reward for our game plan: Gilchrist - We were outplayed: Dravid 

INDRANIL MAJUMDAR

Virender Sehwag wages a lone battle while 

Adam Gilchrist?s joy knows no bounds as he celebrates the fall of the last Indian 

wicket on Friday 

Nagpur: Almost two hours after the finish, the Australians were still inside their dressing room at the VCA Stadium. The celebrations refused to stop as beer flowed freely and the players took time to come to terms with reality. 

As Justin Langer held on to the skier at deep mid-wicket and Adam Gilchrist leapt up in the air, his teammates were locked in a huddle that signified the bonding in the team. It is this joint effort and collective will that has made the end of the 35-year-wait possible. The Indian frontier has finally been overcome, not by Steve Waugh or Ricky Ponting, but by the man with the golden gloves. 

Ponting, of course, was there to rush in from the sidelines along with the reserve players and the support staff to join the party. Far from the limelight stood John Buchanan, quietly recording the historic moment on his handycam. 

If the players have made it possible, the coach has planned it all. Not for a moment did he sulk after the 2001 defeat, but has utilised the time in between to give final touches to his cherished dream. It was more a sense of relief for Buchanan than a time to bask in glory. 

At 4.23 pm, his hard work paid the dividends. A series victory in India with a day and a Test to spare. What could have been an innings victory finally was achieved with a 342-run margin. 

The Aussies seemed to relive the moment every time Zaheer Khan?s dismissal off Shane Warne was being repeated on television. Michael Slater, a member of the 2001 team, joined in the dressing room balcony. Justin Langer and Shane Warne pulled him inside, screaming ?we?ve done it, mate?. 

India?s unbeaten record at home since 2000, when they lost to South Africa, has been laid to rest. 

There were very few moments in this Test match when it seemed the hosts would bounce back. The visitors enjoyed all the advantage and their domination culminated in the fourth day finish. 

?We were outplayed,? admitted Rahul Dravid. ?We haven?t batted as well as we should have and that?s made the difference. People go through these phases. It?s unfortunate that it has happened to us jointly,? the stand-in captain said. 

?It?s a reward for our game plan,? Gilchrist said. ?In time we?ll sit back and reflect on the achievement. I?m sure Ricky would have accomplished the same, such was the planning.? 

Gilchrist, however, feels that India went wrong with their team selection and had to pay for it in the end. ?I thought the Nagpur wicket was a lot similar to Australian conditions. It was obvious that India needed another seamer out there, which could have made things very difficult for our batsmen,? he opined. 

Hailing the team effort after the series victory, Gilchrist said: ?I?ve got to give credit to all the players, I have used everyone?s knowledge, shoulder at some time to lean on and have a chat to? even the support staff.? 

If the appointment of Sunil Gavaskar as consultant just before the series was a pressure tactics on the visitors or a well-planned motive in favour of the hosts, it certainly failed to inspire the Indians. 

Sunny?s plan had been simple ? stay put and tire the Aussie bowlers into submission. What he hadn?t thought of was the top-order playing roulette with his reputation with a reckless display of application and discipline. 

There is hardly anything common between Glenn McGrath and Michael Schumacher. But the fast bowler?s suffocating off-stump line can only be compared to Schumacher?s string of victories in the F1 circuit that had threatened to make the outcome boring. It was business as usual for McGrath on Friday. As he made life difficult for the batsmen at one end, Gillespie and Kasprowicz reaped the maximum benefits at the other. 

The start was always going to be important and India faltered. Akash Chopra possibly played his last Test innings as Jason Gillespie broke through his defences in the fourth over. Dravid left in a similar fashion an over later. The Australians were making use of the bounce on this slow wicket. Virender Sehwag edged wide of third slip after McGrath whizzed one past his nose. Time was ripe for Sachin Tendulkar to make his presence felt. 

McGrath and Gillespie welcomed Sachin with a barrage of short deliveries. It was evident that the ploy was to make his life miserable, thereby allowing very little breathing space. With a forward short leg in place, McGrath bounced one on the off stump and Sachin sliced it into the hands of Damien Martyn at point. 

For McGrath, playing his 100th Test match, this was his 450th wicket and the defining moment of the match. 

This is not the first time the Little Master has been a victim of such dismissal. His increasing tendency to glide the ball past the slip cordon has, of late, cost him his wicket on quite a few occasions. 

V.V.S. Laxman?s frustration showed as he hooked a loosener from Kasprowicz. Mohammed Kaif isn?t still out of the one-day mode despite playing two Test matches. In a hurry to take the first possible flight out of the city, he nicked one behind. 

The top-order had failed again, managing just 37 and it was left to Virender Sehwag to wage a lost battle. His 58, which included eight boundaries, was too little too late. Man of the Match Damien Martyn missed out on becoming the first Australian after Don Bradman (1947-48) to score three successive hundreds, falling just three runs short. Michael Clarke one again proved his credentials with a superb 73, but it was Martyn?s anticipated century that delayed their declaration.

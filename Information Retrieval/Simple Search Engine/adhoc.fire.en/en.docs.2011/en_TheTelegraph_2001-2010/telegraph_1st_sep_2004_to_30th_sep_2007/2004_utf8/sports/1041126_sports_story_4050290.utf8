 Rach shoots down stars

A CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Chief national hockey coach Gerhard Rach witnessed a domestic hockey match for the first time since taking up the Indian coaching job when he watched the final of the 41st Nehru hockey tournament between Punjab Police and Border Security Force here Thursday. He wasn?t impressed, tough, announcing that nobody from the finalists will be welcome to the national camp. 

That, in the backdrop of Punjab Police fielding two recently discarded internationals, striker Gagan Ajit Singh and playmaker Baljit Singh Dhillon. Rach said: ?Baljit played skilfully, but is too slow and we should look to the future.? There was no talk about Gagan Ajit?s ?attitude problems? but just said that he needed to lose some weight and regain his mobility. 

Jugraj Singh also played in the final but did not impress Rach. ?Jugraj is still not match fit and has lost his mobility,? was what Rach said. 

What about the Chandigarh camp? Rach admitted that was affected by injuries to three key players ? Dilip Tirkey, Viren Rasquinha and Vikram Pillay. ?These three may not be fit for the two Tests vs Spain on November 28 and 30,? he said, but will be fit for the Champions Trophy. ?India will have only 15 fit players for the Tests.? 

For the record, Punjab Police won the Nehru meet for the third year in-a-row, beating BSF 4-3 in the penalty shoot-out after the match ended in a goalless.

 Gibbs-Boje issue not closed

Durban: Some South Africa players, including Herschelle Gibbs and Nicky Boje, may not join the national squad during its tour of India in November for fear of being arrested and questioned by Indian police about match-fixing. 

Gibbs and Boje were implicated with the late Hansie Cronje when the South Africans toured India in 2000. Gibbs was subsequently suspended for six months. 

?At this stage we have not received any assurance from India that the players will not be arrested by the police,? UCBSA CEO Gerald Majola said on Wednesday. He said he was busy negotiating with the ICC and India about the match-fixing affair. 

?At this stage we don?t have clarity and are waiting to hear what?s going on. We are worried that any of the players who toured India may be questioned by the Indian police when they arrive there.? 

Majola said because of the uncertainty, several players could decide not to make themselves available.

The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Atwal starts with 4-under

 - ORLANDO GOLF l Dazzling 10-below par by Lewis 

 Arjun Atwal 

Orlando: With this year?s US PGA Tour on its home stretch, J.L. Lewis produced a dazzling 10-under-par 62 to grab a two-shot lead after the opening round of the $ 4.2 million Funai Classic at the Walt Disney Resort on Thursday. 

[Most starts were good, even the one by India?s Arjun Atwal, adds A Staff Reporter in Calcutta. Coming off a fine sixth-place finish at the Chrysler Classic of Greenboro, Atwal is aiming to finish around the top to keep his fully-exempt card. 

[In the first round he hit five birdies (fifth, seventh, tenth, 11th and 13th), his Lady Luck of putting not looking entirely away. Only on the par 4 18th did he get stuck a bit, with his bogey luck back. 

[At the time of going to press, Atwal had gone through seven holes of the second round, but he started with a bogey before recovering to par and then to bogey on the third. That is 27 on the second round card so far. 

[Around Atwal, on 68, also are Hidemichi Tanaka of Japan, Geoff Ogilvy of Australia and Richard S. Johnson of Sweden.] 

Australians Mark Hensby and Scott Hend were in joint second place on 64, alongside John Huston. A further stroke adrift were Briny Baird, Spain?s Jose Maria Olazabal and Stephen Ames of Canada. 

World No. 1 Vijai Singh of Fiji was among a group of nine players on 66. 

The tournament is being played on two par-72 courses, the Magnolia and Palm. 

Lewis, 44, twice a winner on the PGA Tour, made his intentions clear from the start. Beginning his round on the 10th hole at the Magnolia, he reeled off four successive birdies. He dropped a shot at the 15th but hit back with another birdie at the 16th. 

Lewis then crammed in six birdies in a spectacular eight-hole stretch coming home to be back in 30, six under. 

?I shot 63 in the first round (of the Las Vegas Invitational) two weeks ago, 63 in the last round of the Texas Open (four weeks ago) and 63 at home one day, so I?ve been playing very well,? Lewis told reporters. 

?Nobody can explain golf, so I?m not going to try. I just try to hit each shot the best I can and get myself in a situation where hopefully I?ll have a chance to do something good on Sunday.? 

Lewis needed only 25 putts on Thursday but believes he could have gone lower. 

 ?Everybody in the tournament is capable of that, though, that?s the thing,? he said. ?I don?t think people realise really what they are capable of sometimes.?

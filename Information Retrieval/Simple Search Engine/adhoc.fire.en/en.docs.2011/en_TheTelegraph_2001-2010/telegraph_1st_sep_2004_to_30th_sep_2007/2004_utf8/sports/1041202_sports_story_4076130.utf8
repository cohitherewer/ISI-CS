The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Bhutia for NFL, not honeymoon 

 Bhutia feels the NFL can be improved 

Bangalore: Indian football star Bhaichung Bhutia is getting married on December 30, but says he would skip honeymoon for playing in the National Football League (NFL) commencing next month. 

?No, I am not going on a honeymoon as the NFL is starting in January,? the ace striker said here on Wednesday. 

Bhutia had been courting Madhuri, a Maharashtrian hotelier, for the past seven-eight years. 

It was not love at first sight, the 28-year-old player confesses. 

?We met through common friends. We just became friends and slowly?,? added Bhutia, who plays for East Bengal. 

The traditional Sikkim wedding ceremony would be held in Calcutta, he said. 

 More teams 

To make the NFL more competitive, Bhutia thinks it should be expanded. 

The Indian captain feels that the number of teams as well as matches needs to be increased. 

The disappointment of not winning the Federation Cup, despite taking part in it in the last seven-eight years, shows on him. 

?I will keep trying... May be next year,? he said a day after East Bengal crashed out of the tournament, losing 0-1 to Sporting Club de Goa in the quarter final. 

?We did not control the match. We did not keep the ball,? he admitted. 

?The entire team did not play well. It?s not correct to blame an individual,? he said. 

On the role played by the All India Football Federation, Bhutia said: ?AIFF is doing its bit but needs to do more. The system has to be reviewed. 

?The standard of football in India can only improve from where it is now. ? 

The sport, right now, is not getting the popularity it deserves,? the East Bengal striker said. 

Bhutia said he expected to be 100 per cent fit by the time the NFL kicks off in January. 

Bhutia said he had a few offers from foreign clubs in Malaysia and Singapore but none were attractive.

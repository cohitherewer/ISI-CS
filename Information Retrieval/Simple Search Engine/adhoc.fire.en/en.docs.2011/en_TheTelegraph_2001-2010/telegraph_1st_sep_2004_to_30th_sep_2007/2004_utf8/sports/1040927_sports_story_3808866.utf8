Calcutta: Mohammedan Sporting and Tollygunge Agragami played out a hard-fought 1-1 draw at Salt Lake Stadium on Sunday to virtually ensure third place for Ever-Ready in the CFL Super Division championship leg. 

The prolific Henry Chukwukei gave Mohammedan Sporting the lead halfway through the opening session, making him joint top-scorer with Douglas da Silva, Sanjib Mishra and Mohammed Ali (seven goals each). Dinesh Swar restored parity moments before half-time, with his sixth goal of the league. 

Mohammedan Sporting have 25 points in their kitty from 17 matches, while Tollygunge moved to 26 from 16 matches. Ever-Ready, already on 32 with two games left, will finish third unless they lose both remaining games and Tollygunge win both theirs. 

Tollygunge had the first looks at opposition goal, thanks to some sloppy work in the Mohammedan Sporting defence. Danny Muinao fumbled on the left to let Kabijit Khotel move up and float a cross. Stopper Aga Abdul Wahid?s back-header would have gone into his own goal had an alert Chinmoy Banerjee not palmed the ball away. 

A little later, Naushad Moosa thought he had a long ball from the Tollygunge half under control only to find Akeem Abolanle sneak in and nearly flick it into the goal. 

Mohammedan Sporting took time to get into their stride and scored with the first cohesive move. Jiten Rai laid the ball on to Raman Vijayan?s path and the veteran striker pushed the ball through the Tollygunge defence for Chukwukei to sprint past Debkumar Sasmal and unleash a booming right-footer from just outside the box. 

That happened to be Vijayan?s sole good deed. With his reaction to any given situation being either too slow or too late, a couple of chances went abegging. 

Tollygunge were rewarded for their nagging forays when Khotel set up Akeem Abolanle who, in turn, found Swar with a neat pass. The opportunistic medio wasted no time in breaching the defence with a powerful right-footer. 

There were close calls for both sides after change of ends, the most glaring ones being those of Khotel pushing the ball wide with goalkeeper Chinmoy at his mercy and a last-minute Saumik Dey back-header which almost resulted in a Tollygunge own goal.

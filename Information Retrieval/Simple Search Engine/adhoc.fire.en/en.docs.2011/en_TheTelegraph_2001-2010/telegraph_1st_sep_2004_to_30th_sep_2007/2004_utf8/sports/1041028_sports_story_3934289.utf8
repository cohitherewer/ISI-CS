 Fleming slams 202

 New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming celebrates after scoring a double century in Chittagong on Wednesday 

Chittagong: Captain Stephen Fleming struck a fine double-century as New Zealand looked on way to notch up another win over Bangladesh in the second and final Test on Wednesday. 

Fleming hit 202 in the visiting side?s first innings score of 545 for six declared and Bangladesh were struggling at 82 for three in reply at the MA Aziz Stadium. Opener Javed Omar was unbeaten on 45 as Bangladesh, who lost the opening Test in Dhaka by an innings and 99 runs, still needed another 264 runs to avoid follow-on. 

 Fleming, who on Tuesday became the most-capped player for New Zealand as well as their highest run-getter in Tests, added another feather to his cap when he touched the 200-run mark. 

He became only the third New Zealand batsman to score two double centuries in Tests after Glenn Turner and Matthew Sinclair. 

Fleming, 137 overnight, hit 21 fours and one six before he failed to keep a drive down and was caught at cover by Mushfiqur Rahman off off-spinner Rajin Saleh. 

Fleming added 99 for the fourth wicket with Nathan Astle (39) and 87 with Hamish Marshall (69) for the fifth. Marshall was out towards the end of the second session when he got a leading edge to a delivery from left-arm spinner Enamul Haque Jr. Tapash Baisya took a fine catch while running in from mid-wicket.

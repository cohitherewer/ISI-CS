 CRICKET ONLINE - RAVI SHASTRI

 Think about your best on match-eve

 Keep a still head when going down the track

 I am a right-handed batsman. When playing the sweep, I always end up missing the ball and it hits the pads. Why does this happen? 

 (Rajarshi Banerjee, 14, Calcutta-40) 

 You are getting into a wrong position when playing the shot. Also misjudging the line and length of the delivery.

 I am a right-handed batsman. I always fail to read my off stump while facing fast bowlers. Please help. 

 (Ansaj Taparia, 14, Sibsagar) 

 Try and take a middle stump guard, it may help. 

 I am a left-handed batsman. I face problems when facing a leg spinner. Please help. 

 (Soham Roy, 14, Calcutta-40) 

 Watch the ball like a hawk coming out of the bowler?s hand and try and get as close to the pitch of the ball as possible. 

 What sort of mental preparation is needed on the night before a ?big? match? 

 (Tapan Roy, 19, Siliguri) 

 Try and concentrate on your strengths. Think about your best performances.

 I am a right-arm medium-pacer. Whenever I bowl a bouncer I end up with a wide or overstep. Why does this happen? 

 (Roshan Khatiwora, 15, East Sikkim) 

 You are obviously trying too hard. Be normal. 

 I am a left-arm spinner. Whenever I take a diagonal run-up for bowling round the wicket, I end up bowling a no ball. How can I overcome this problem? 

 (Dipayan Bhattacharya, 16, Howrah) 

 It?s just in your mind. Work on your run-up in the nets. 

 I am a medium pacer. Is it necessary to come close to the stumps when bowling an outswinger? 

 (Rajib Saha, 18, Calcutta-21) 

 It?s a very good habit. It gives you more chance of getting lbws. Also helps the outswinger. 

 I am a right-handed batsman. I have been often dismissed (bowled) by yorkers of late. Please help. 

 (Rajat Datta, 19, Calcutta-16) 

 Watch the backlift and the ball coming out of the bowler?s hand. Should help immensely.

 I am weak on the leg side. Will practice at nets help me improve? 

 (Ranadeep Chakraborty, 11, Calcutta-37) 

 Open up your stance a bit. It will help you get a better sight of the ball. 

 I am a right-handed batsman. I often miss the flight when stepping out to off-spinners. Please advise. 

 (Subhro Roy, 23, Calcutta-14) 

 Keep a still head when going down the track. Also get close to the pitch of the ball.

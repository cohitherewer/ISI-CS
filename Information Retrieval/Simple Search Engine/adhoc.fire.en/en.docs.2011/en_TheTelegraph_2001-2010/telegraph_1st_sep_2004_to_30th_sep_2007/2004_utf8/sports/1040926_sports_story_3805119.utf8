London: Champions Arsenal retained their two-point lead at the top of the Premier League with a 1-0 victory at Manchester City after title rivals Chelsea beat Middlesbrough 1-0 on Saturday. 

Manchester United?s revival continued as they ended Tottenham Hotspur?s unbeaten run with a 1-0 win at White Hart Lane, courtesy of a Ruud van Nistelrooy penalty. 

Liverpool cantered to a 3-0 win over Norwich City, Dutch newcomer Patrick Kluivert and skipper Alan Shearer scored one each in Newcastle Uniteds 3-1 victory over 10-man West Bromwich Albion and Fulham were 1-0 winners over struggling Southampton. 

Arsenal?s win at the City of Manchester stadium, secured by a rare goal from England defender Ashley Cole, helped extend their record unbeaten league run to 47 games. 

Didier Drogba struck nine minutes from time to give Chelsea a 1-0 win at Middlesbrough on Saturday and prevent a third successive goalless Premier League draw for the Londoners. Chelsea had struggled to turn their superiority into clear chances during the early kickoff at the Riverside Stadium until the Ivory coast striker scored with a low shot from the edge of the box after a clever free kick by Frank Lampard. 

Lampard shaped to deliver a right wing free kick deep but instead cut the ball back to the edge of the box where Drogba having pulled out from the ball-watching Boro defence, neatly sidefooted the ball into the bottom left corner. 

Boro did not manage a single shot on target. Their only hope was a claim for a penalty in the 63rd minute when a Stuart Parnaby shot struck Terry?s arm on the edge of the box. (REUTERS)

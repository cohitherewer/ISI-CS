Norton (Massachusetts): Fijis Vijai Singh took a step closer to gaining the world No. 1 ranking by extending his lead to three shots over Tiger Woods in Sundays third round of the $5 million Deutsche Bank Championship. 

After shooting an eight-under-par 63 on Saturday, Singh tied the lowest round of the day with a three-under-par 68 to move to 14-under 199. 

Woods shot a two-under-par 69 to slip a shot further back from Singh who will take over from the American as world No. 1 if he wins the tournament. He will also move past the $7 million mark for earnings this year, eclipsing his 2003 total of $7,573,907 his best year on the PGA Tour. 

A victory would also virtually sew up the Player of the Year award for the US PGA champion who has five Tour victories this season. 

Bill Haas shot an even-par 71 to stay in the hunt at nine-under-par and third overall, while Japans Shigeki Maruyama also shot an even-par 71 and is six shots behind Singh in fourth. 

Jay Williamson and defending champion Adam Scott are tied for fifth at seven-under-par, while first round co-leader Ryan Palmer dropped to ninth place at five-under-par after shooting 74. 

At 41, Singh is on the best run any golfer has had over the last two years with 30 top-10 finishes in the last 49 events and nine victories in two seasons. 

Woods had five wins in three consecutive seasons from 2001, but since his triumph at last years WGC American Express Championships in Atlanta, he has only one match play tournament victory to his name. 

It was a tougher day, Singh said. The wind conditions were different. I missed a few fairways through not thinking the right way. 

Singh sank three birdies to make the turn at three-under-par 33, but had to wait until the final hole for his next birdie to cancel out a dropped shot on the 14th. You have got to be very patient, Singh said. Thats the key. Normally when you have a lead and dont have a good start, a lot of guys press and try to get the shots back. 

You just go out there and play hole-by-hole, take your time and get settled in. Thats what I do. I dont rush myself. 

Singhs strategy was epitomised at the PGA Championship where he failed to beat par on any of the final 18 holes, but made a birdie on the first playoff hole to take a lead that he would not relinquish for his third major title.

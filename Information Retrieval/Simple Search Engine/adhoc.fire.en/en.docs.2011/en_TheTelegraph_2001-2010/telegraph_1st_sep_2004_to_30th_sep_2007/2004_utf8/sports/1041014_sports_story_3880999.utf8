The Telegraph - Calcutta

 Today, I don?t see Aussies losing the series: Greg

 - ?Sometimes you do have to change a combination to kick-start a revival? 

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI 

 Greg Chappell

 Calcutta: Much as the Indians 

 may draw inspiration from Lance Armstrong, only big runs 

 on the board will have some impact on the Australians. Sub-250 

 totals just won?t suffice. 

?Surely, the Indians have to bat much better than in Bangalore... Be it first or second, they must have enough runs to make the Australians think. Otherwise...? Greg Chappell trailed off during a conversation on Wednesday evening. 

The second Test begins in Chennai on Thursday. 

 Speaking to The Telegraph from 

 Sydney, the former captain added: ?Frankly, today, I don?t 

 see Australia losing this (four-Test) series... For me to 

 change my opinion, the Indians have to bat as they did in 

 Australia last season.? 

[India?s scores in the four Tests there were: 409, 73/2 (Brisbane); 523, 233/6 (Adelaide); 366, 286 (Melbourne); 705/7 decl., 211/2 decl. (Sydney).] 

He continued: ?It?s quite apparent that, this time, Australia have come much better prepared... The Adam Gilchrists won?t repeat the mistakes of 2001.? 

According to Greg, who has been approached by the West Indies to coach Brian Lara and Co., the Indians should ?immediately re-focus? and ?quickly appreciate? what needs to be done, particularly in Sachin Tendulkar?s absence. 

?Problem, of course, is that the batsmen haven?t been scoring in any form... I didn?t expect the poor one-day run to get reflected in Test cricket but, sadly, that has happened,? Greg observed. 

India have taken to the ongoing series after drawing a blank in four successive one-day tournaments. 

Asked whether he supported the move to drop Akash Chopra and open either with Yuvraj Singh or Parthiv Patel (as Virender Sehwag?s partner), Greg replied: ?I wouldn?t like to comment on individuals, but it?s a fact that the present line-up isn?t doing the job... 

?If fielding a Mohammed Kaif and changing the opening combination is going to work, so be it... Sometimes, you do have to change a combination to kick-start a revival or whatever... Being different and less predictable could make a difference.? 

Will Glenn McGrath be the biggest threat for the Sourav Gangulys? 

?No... I know Glenn was outstanding in the first Test, but it?s a combination which worked... Jason (Gillespie) had a role as also (Michael) Kasprowicz and Shane Warne... I definitely wouldn?t underestimate Warne,? was Greg?s answer. 

 As for the Indian bowlers, he felt they can only be 

 effective once the batsmen deliver. Well, till the other 

 day, India?s USP was batting...

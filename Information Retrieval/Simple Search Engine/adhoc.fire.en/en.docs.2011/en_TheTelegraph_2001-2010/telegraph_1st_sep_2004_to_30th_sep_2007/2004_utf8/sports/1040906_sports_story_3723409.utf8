 India go down to 10-man Iran

 A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: India failed to capitalise on a one-man advantage as they went down 0-1 to Iran in their opening group C encounter of the AFC under-17 football meet in Shizuoka (Japan) on Sunday. According to information received here, Amiri headed in the winner from a flag-kick, 14 minutes from full time. 

The Iranians had medio Kor sent off for a foul. 

The result left Indian TD P.K. Banerjee ruing what might have been. We created half-a-dozen openings and had the goalkeeper at our mercy thrice, but still couldnt put the ball into the net, PK told The Telegraph from Shizuoka. They played for most of the match with 10 men and we should have taken advantage and won 

PK praised his boys for the fight. They fought really hard and that was good to see. Our disadvantage was height most of my players are only about five feet.

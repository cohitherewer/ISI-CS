 Top players to get $3,500 per month

Karachi: The top 17 Pakistan cricketers will get a monthly salary ranging from $3,500 to $1,200 under the first-ever national contract they signed late on Sunday, officials said. 

Speedster Shoaib Akhtar has, however, raised a few objections and not signed the contract yet. 

Captain Inzamam-ul Haq, vice-captain Yusuf Youhana, allrounder Abdul Razzaq and Akhtar were offered category A contracts and will get a monthly salary of around Rs 200,000, PCB sources said. 

Players put in category B will get Rs 125,000 (around $2,100) while those in the C category will get Rs 75,000 (around $1,200) per month. 

In Pathan?s footsteps 

Pakistan?s uncapped left-arm pacer pacer Mohammad Khalil hopes to emulate Irfan Pathan on his maiden tour of Australia. ?If Pathan can succeed on his first tour, why can?t I,? Khalil said before the Pakistan team?s departure for Australia. 

?I also have the example of Pakistani great Wasim Akram who surprised the world by taking 10 wickets in only his second Test on his first tour in New Zealand 20 years ago,? Khalil said. 

The 20-year-old Pathan made his Test debut in Australia last year where India squared a four-match Test series 1-1. 

The 22-year-old pacer Khalil is one of the two uncapped players in the Pakistan squad for three Tests in Australia and a tri-series. The first Test starts in Perth from December 16. 

Pakistan are also seeking Akram?s guidance for Khalil to help him master the inswing like Pathan, said Woolmer. But Akram said he would not be available in Australia. 

?I have seen him (Khalil) bowl in a match and he is good but since I have turned down an offer to do commentary in Australia I won?t be there,? Akram said.

 Dhaka: Sachin Tendulkar cracked a world record-equalling 34th Test century as India maintained their stranglehold by keeping themselves on course for a huge first innings lead in the first Test against Bangladesh here Saturday. 

Sachin overcame a shaky start before equalling Sunil Gavaskar?s record and was unbeaten on 159 as the visitors reached 348 for seven at close on the second day, a lead of 164 runs. 

The 31-year-old star batsman?s memorable moment came just before the tea break when he took a single off pacer Tapash Baisya to join Gavaskar at the top of the century-maker?s list. 

Sachin had his share of luck in the initial stages but settled down to exhibit his class with some glorious shots and steer his team out of early trouble when they lost three quick wickets with just 68 runs on the board. 

Anil Kumble, yet to open his account, was giving Sachin company at stumps with India having taken a firm control of the game. 

The hosts, who threatened to spoil India?s party when they picked three early wickets, gradually conceded the advantage, thanks to some sloppy fielding and lack of support to their strike bowlers Baisya and Mashrafe Mortaza. 

For the Indians, it was second day on the trot to celebrate an individual performance following Kumble claiming his 435th Test wicket to become the country?s leading wicket-taker. 

Sachin and Gavaskar are among the three batsmen to have 30 or more centuries, with former Australian captain Steve Waugh having 32 tons to his name. 

Like Gavaskar, Sachin too achieved the milestone in his 119th Test. And while the now retired maestro was 37 years of age when he notched up his final hundred, Sachin is only 31. 

The Master Blaster also became the third batsman after South Africa?s Gary Kirsten and Steve Waugh to have scored centuries against all Test playing nations. 

But for all his feats, Sachin almost walked back to the pavilion without opening his account when his fierce pull off Mortaza nearly got stuck in Mohammad Ashraful?s hands at forward short leg. 

The star batsman then snicked a rising delivery from the same bowler when on 28 but Habibul Bashar spilled a simple catch at first slip. 

Another chance went abegging on 47 when a sharp delivery from left-arm spinner Mohammed Rafique struck the shoulder of his bat but Rajin Saleh at silly point let it go. 

Besides, Sachin also needed Gautam Gambhir to sacrifice his wicket after a mid-pitch mix-up when the former was on 19. 

But the batting genius, much like when scoring his 29th ton against the West Indies to be on par with Don Bradman, fought the demons inside him and went on to play what could be a match-winning knock. 

Sachin has faced 272 balls and hit 23 boundaries during his unfinished knock. 

Sourav Ganguly was the second highest scorer. The skipper was more solid in his 71 and added 164 runs with Sachin for the crucial fourth wicket. 

In the end, Bangladesh would have been better placed had their fielders supported their bowlers. 

The Bangladeshi seamers made the most of the morning moisture as the play began half-an-hour early to compensate the loss of time Friday. 

Mortaza, in particular, making a comeback after more than a year?s gap from injury, had the Indian batsmen hopping on their feet. 

Both Sourav and Sachin ducked and weaved at his ferocious bouncers. Sachin was even hit on the helmet. 

Mortaza was clearly the outstanding bowler from the moment he sent Rahul Dravid?s off stump cartwheeling in the eighth over of the day. 

Baisya had struck the first blow when he rapped Virender Sehwag (13) on the pads in his third over but Dravid completely misjudged the line of Mortaza and let go a straight delivery at his own peril. 

Sachin lived dangerously during the entire morning session. 

He, however, was determined to play his shots and his run graph covered all parts of the ground. There was the square drive, punched on-drive and the back foot square cut that marked his trademark aggression. 

Gambhir also looked quite comfortable before he was run out for 35. 

The Delhi lefthander had collected 14 runs off Mortaza with the help of three fours ? a drive off the pads, a cover drive and a glance through the slips. Gambhir?s 35 came from 50 balls and contained six fours. 

Sachin kept playing his shots and was particularly severe on the spinners Rafique and Manjural Islam.

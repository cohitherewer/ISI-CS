 BJP sees no gains from Aziz visit

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Ranchi, Nov. 25: The BJP has said Pakistan Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz?s India visit has fetched no results.

 A resolution on foreign policy passed at the party?s national executive tonight said: ?No progress has been made even on such confidence-building measure as the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus service.?

 The resolution said Aziz also failed to officially convey President Pervez Musharraf?s publicly-announced proposal on Jammu and Kashmir. It said the BJP rejected the proposals because the state was and would remain an integral part of India.

 Noting that issues between India and Pakistan were ?complex and of long-standing?, the resolution expressed its concern over the US government?s decision to supply sophisticated arms to Pakistan, especially F-16s, in the ?name of fighting terrorism?.

 The BJP said it was incumbent on the US to ensure that nothing was done to ?derail the delicate peace process? involving India and Pakistan. Briefing the media, spokesperson Yashwant Sinha said when the National Democratic Alliance was in power, it managed to persuade the US not to make such moves and he added with ?deep regret? that the United Progressive Alliance government had allowed the US to take such a ?dangerous step?.

 ?This will have the most adverse impact on the current India-Pakistan peace process,? the resolution said. It added that the UPA government had made state-sponsored cross-border terrorism a virtual ?non-issue?.

 ?Infiltration continues unabated and the infrastructure of terrorism remains intact in Pakistan and PoK (Pakistan-occupied Kashmir),? the resolution said. It took note of the security breach in Srinagar hours before Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was to address a public meeting.

 The BJP said the present dispensation had allowed the India-Pakistan dialogue to become ?wholly J amp;K centric?. It failed to carry forward the Vajpayee government?s initiative to engage all groups, including the Hurriyat, the party added.

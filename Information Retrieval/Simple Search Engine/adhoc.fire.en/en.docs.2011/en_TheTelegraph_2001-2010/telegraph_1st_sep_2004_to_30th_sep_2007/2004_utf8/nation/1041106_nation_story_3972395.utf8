The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 George, Naidu talk of BJP slide

 KAY BENEDICT

 New Delhi, Nov. 5: Alarmed by the BJP?s factional feuds, the chiefs of the Telugu Desam Party and Janata Dal (United) today quietly discussed their ally?s ability to lead the National Democratic Alliance and the nation. 

 Desam president N. Chandrababu Naidu and George Fernandes met at the Dal (U) chief?s 3 Krishna Menon Marg residence. 

 The leaders also discussed L.K. Advani?s taking over as BJP chief and his subsequent hardline statements on Hindutva even as an NDA meeting has been called on November 14 to discuss the matter.

 Sources said Naidu and Fernandes are concerned at the way the BJP?s fortunes have dipped after May?s Lok Sabha elections and last month?s Maharashtra polls.

 They are more worried at the BJP?s failure to throw up a leader of stature to head the party and the squabbling among second-rung leaders. Desam sources said even the Sangh parivar appears divided.

 Naidu was here to address a two-day convention on ?Do reforms need course correction?, organised by the newly-floated Lok Awaz, an apolitical organisation set up by Fernandes and his confidant Shambu Shrivastwa. 

 The Dal (U) chief invited leaders from all parties other than the Congress and the BJP to the convention, but Naidu was the only politician of consequence to turn up.

 Shrivastwa said Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh and Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee are expected to attend tomorrow.

 After speaking at the convention in the morning, Naidu called on Vice-President Bhairon Singh Shekhawat. He is thought to have discussed the political situation with the politically savvy Shekhawat, who is close to former Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayee.

 Sources said the Desam chief sat down with Fernandes in the evening to discuss the BJP?s fortunes but would not say what was discussed.

 After Advani became BJP chief, Naidu had expressed concern that the party could return to hardline Hindutva. The Dal (U) national executive held in Ranchi earlier this week also urged the BJP not to deviate from the NDA agenda. Both Naidu and Fernandes are under pressure from their party rank and file to sever ties with the BJP.

 Earlier, Fernandes said in his inaugural address at the convention that ?there is an urgent need to debate on changes required in on-going economic policies?. He said reforms and globalisation were meant to unshackle the economy and use its full potential to end poverty, unemployment and disparity, accelerate growth and raise living standards. The Dal (U) chief said the Left should protest against unchecked reforms.

 Naidu said reforms help development, adding that India needs foreign direct investment and liberalisation.

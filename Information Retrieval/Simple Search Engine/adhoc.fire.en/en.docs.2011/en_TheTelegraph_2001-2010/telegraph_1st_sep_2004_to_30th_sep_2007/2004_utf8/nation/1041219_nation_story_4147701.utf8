 Laloo between budget amp; poll 

 KAY BENEDICT

 New Delhi, Dec. 18: The three-phase election to the Bihar Assembly in February has thrown up a headache for three key poll players.

 The Centre is worried that the poll dates of February 3, 15 and 23 will coincide with the budget session of Parliament commencing in the middle of that month. It may urge the Election Commission to reschedule the dates.

 With the railway budget to be presented in the last week, railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav will be torn between the budget, his speech and campaigning for his ruling Rashtriya Janata Dal in Bihar.

 The BJP is concerned that a staggered poll will give the RJD the opportunity to indulge in violence and rigging.

 The poll panel announced the Assembly election schedule for Bihar, Jharkhand and Haryana yesterday.

 Parliamentary affairs minister Ghulam Nabi Azad said today: ?We have to think over it (poll schedule) as it would affect the budget session. We will discuss it on Monday.?

 The budget session, Azad said, usually begins between February 15 and 20 and the railway budget is presented on February 24 or 25 and the general budget on February 28.

 With the coming elections considered crucial for both the ruling United Progressive Alliance and the National Democratic Alliance, many senior leaders and ministers would be away campaigning in the three states.

 One of them will be Laloo Prasad, who is otherwise happy with the prolonged poll schedule as he thinks it will benefit his party. His only worry is spending considerable time in the ministry to finish the budget at the cost of campaigning.

 A BJP team led by vice-president Sushil Kumar Modi met chief electoral officer K.C. Saha in Patna today and submitted a memorandum for the chief election commissioner asking him to ?reconsider? his order.

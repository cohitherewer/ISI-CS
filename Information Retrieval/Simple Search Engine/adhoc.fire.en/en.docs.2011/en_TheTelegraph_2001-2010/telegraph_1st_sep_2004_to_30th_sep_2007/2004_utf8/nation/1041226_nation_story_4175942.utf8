 Malaysian driver found dead

Chennai (PTI): A driver from Malaysia, Subramani, who was 

reported missing from December 12, was found dead in a casuarina grove in a village 

in Tiruvannamalai district of Tamil Nadu a few days ago.

 The 47-year-old?s wife, Valliamma, identified the body. Police had taken her to the village following media reports giving details about the dead man?s identification marks.

 The couple had received a letter in November from a company in Chennai stating they had won a prize of a dinner with an actor and, therefore, should be present in person. Two air tickets were also sent to them. 

 The couple reached Chennai on December 12 and were taken to two different destinations near Pondicherry by the company?s officials.

 Sensing that she had been kidnapped, Valliamma managed to escape from the captors in Pondicherry and lodged a complaint a few days ago with the airport police.

 When news about this incident was reported in some newspapers, Cheyyur police got in touch with the airport police to inform them about the body.

 The post-mortem report revealed that the death was from strangulation, police sources said.

 Dozen held for Haj protest

Srinagar (PTI): At least 12 activists of the Muslim League, 

including its chairman, were taken into preventive custody on Saturday when they 

staged a demonstration in violation of prohibitory orders.

 The activists were protesting against the government?s decision to deny permission to over 50 people, including hardline Hurriyat leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani, to go for Haj.

 The Muslim League is a constituent of the hardline faction of the Hurriyat Conference headed by Geelani. 

 The activists gathered at Regal Chowk in the heart of the city and started raising slogans against the government. As the assembly was illegal in view of prohibitory orders being in place, police took the protesters into custody and lodged them at Lothibagh police station, official sources said.

 One of the protesters accused the Mufti Mohammad Sayeed-led coalition government of interfering in religious matters at the Centre?s behest.

 Air travellers vent ire

Chennai (PTI): Irate passengers allegedly damaged the Deccan 

Airlines office on Saturday when they found that the airline had made no alternative 

arrangements following the cancellation of a Chennai-Hyderabad-Delhi flight on 

Friday night.

 Marriage in caste balance

 GAJINDER SINGH

 Chandigarh, Oct. 31: Satyajit and Pinki don?t seem to be as lucky as Rampal and Sonia, for whom Punjab and Haryana High Court intervened to save their marriage.

 An Asanda khap panchayat had earlier ruled that Rampal and Sonia become siblings as they shared the same forefather and gotra. However, the court ordered the panchayat to stop meddling in the couple?s marital lives.

 But caste friction has complicated matters for Satyajit and Pinki. The Lohan khap panchayat meeting in Hissar remained inconclusive about the boycott of the community ? they had objected to the couple?s engagement as the two shared the same gotra ? by the Kadiyans. The khap panchayat will meet again on Tuesday at Jakhauli in Kaithal.

 Members of the Lohan community from Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh were also present at today?s special assembly. 

 ?While we are yet to decide whether Satyajit, a Kadiyan from Rajpura Bhain, and Pinki, a Lohan, from Jakhauli can get married by breaking tradition and customs, we would like to first discuss the matter of the boycott of Lohans by the Kadiyans in their very own village,? said Lohan leader Ram Diya over phone. 

 ?We have decided to go there on Tuesday and hope to solve the issue. As far as the wedding is concerned, we will have to discuss the matter further among us,? Diya said.

 Expressing dissatisfaction over the panchayat?s decision, Kadiyan leader Mani Ram said the Lohans should have first settled the marriage issue. 

 ?A complete non-issue has been turned into something evil. The Lohan biradri would have never come to know about the marriage had some members not objected to the match and gone running to areas where they are in a majority. It is time for the people of the state to stop thinking about gotras,? Mani Ram said.

 ?Let them come here. We will discuss the matter with an open mind and come to a solution that is not seen as barbaric or medieval,? he said.

 ?Gotra issues are giving Haryanvis a bad name. We must be seen as progressive and for achieving our goal we must leave behind old ideas and traditions,? he said.

 But Umi Devi, the sarpanch of Jakhauli ? where the next meeting is scheduled ? claimed she knew nothing of what was happening in her village. 

 The 20 Lohan families in Jakhauli have said they do not object to Satyajit?s and Pinki?s engagement but are helpless as the issue has been hijacked by members who do not reside in their village. 

 The district administration, however, is keeping a watch on the developments. 

 ?Strict security arrangements will be made at Jakhauli on Tuesday to ensure the meeting takes place in a peaceful atmosphere. We will not hesitate to arrest potential troublemakers. Like the Sonia and Rampal case in Asanda, we would like both sections at loggerheads to come to an amicable settlement,? an official said.

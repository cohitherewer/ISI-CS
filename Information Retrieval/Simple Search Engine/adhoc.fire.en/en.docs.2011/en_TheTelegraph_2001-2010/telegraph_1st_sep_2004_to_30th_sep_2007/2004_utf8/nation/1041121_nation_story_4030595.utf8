The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 PM in peace pledge

 SUJAN DUTTA

 Imphal, Nov. 20: As in Kashmir so in Kangla.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today held out the promise of justice for peace and declared that he was in this strife-torn state to herald ?a new process? for security and development.

 ?I have come to Manipur to start a new process, recognising your legitimate aspirations of a life of dignity with self-respect. That new process will be one in which we can ensure the security of all our people and the security of the nation in a manner that is just and humane. That was my message to the people of Kashmir. That is my message to the people of Manipur,? the Prime Minister said at a special convocation of Manipur University.

 At the core of Singh?s ?new process? is a patient ear and the recognition ?that it is only but natural? that the people of Manipur should yearn for peace with dignity. 

 Recalling his own convocation at university, the Prime Minister quoted Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan to make it clear that he will not get into a blame game.

 ?There is so much good in the worst of us and so much bad in the best of us that it does not behove us to blame the rest of us,? he said.

 But he did not fight shy of touching upon the killing and alleged rape of Thangjam Manorama by Assam Rifles personnel that provoked mass anger in the state. 

 ?While it is unfortunate that the brave men of our armed forces have on occasion become the object of public resentment because of the unacceptable behaviour of a few, we must remember that they are here to uphold the rule of law,? Singh said.

 He pointed out that he had already ordered a review of the Armed Forces Special Powers Act. The Apunba Lup, a 32-outfit forum, is leading the movement demanding scrapping of the act.

 Responses from residents of Imphal ? the state capital had downed shutters in response to a bandh called by the underground Revolutionary Peoples? Front ? were measured. 

 ?This air of optimism will pass in a day,? said Ajaib Singh Dholakia, who runs an automobile spares shop. ?It will all be back to the same tomorrow?.

 In Manipur University, just after the convocation, senior assistant professor Haobam Mamata Devi was more hopeful. 

 ?Very good, very good,? she said when asked for an immediate reaction to the Prime Minister?s speech. ?He has declared our institution a central university so we should get more money.?

 What about his announcement of a review of the act? ?What took him so long?? she wondered. ?It has come very late.?

 But Singh is confident it is not too late. Both in the university and later in the afternoon, presiding over the ?handing over? of the Kangla Fort to the state government in a ceremony pregnant with symbolism, he sought to empathise with a people trapped between the military and militancy. 

 The Prime Minister said development would accelerate with peace. ?I believe that Manipur?s foremost concern is economic and social development,? he said.

 At the Kangla Fort grounds, the turnout, which included hundreds of schoolchildren in uniform, surprised many in Singh?s entourage. A police officer said there were 25,000 people. Singh, for whom the crowd cheered louder than it did for chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh, waved enthusiastically. The loudest cheers rang out when he said he had constituted a committee to study the act.

 ?The committee will suggest checks and balances in the act or (suggest) replacing it with a more humane law which takes into account your legitimate aspirations and national security concerns. It will complete its work in six months,? Singh said.

 But the delegation from the Apunba Lup, which met him in the evening, rejected his assurance and set December 10 as the deadline for withdrawing the act.

 The Prime Minister is scheduled to fly to Guwahati tomorrow afternoon for a day-and-a-half in Assam.

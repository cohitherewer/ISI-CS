 Desam worker hacked

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, Sept. 8: The killing of Telugu Desam Party workers in Andhra Pradesh?s Anantpur district continues unchecked, with another functionary being butchered in the district headquarters last night.

 Kedar Naidu, 35, a follower of former Desam MLA from Dharmavaram, Suryapratap Reddy, was set upon with axes and swords by unknown assailants as he was downing the shutters of his car decor shop.

 The shop owner is the fourth Desam worker to be killed since Sunday when K. Prabahakar, reportedly the right-hand man of Penugonda MLA P. Ravindra, was killed as he was returning home with his children from a salon in Anantpur town. Two more Desam activists were killed in the same district over the next two days.

 Desam activists went on the rampage in Warangal and Anantpur districts yesterday, taking out a procession and burned an effigy of the Congress chief minister, Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy, after garlanding it with slippers. Many workers were injured when police caned the protesters. 

 Desam chief . Chandrababu Naidu called on Governor Surjit Singh Barnala this morning along with senior party MLAs and MPs and submitted a five-page memorandum. Naidu, Reddy?s predecessor, told Barnala that the violence was ?all the handiwork? of panchayat raj minister J.C. Diwakar Reddy, who hails from Anantpur, and his brother.

 Home minister K. Jana Reddy refuted the accusation and said political killings were common during Naidu?s days.

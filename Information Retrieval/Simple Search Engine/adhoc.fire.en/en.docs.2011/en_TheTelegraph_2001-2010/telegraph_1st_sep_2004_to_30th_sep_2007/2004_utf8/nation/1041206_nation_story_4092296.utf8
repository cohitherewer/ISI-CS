 Joke book leaves red faces 

 RAJ KUMAR

 Ranchi, Dec. 5: It was 

 meant to tickle a few ribs but a book of jokes sent by the 

 Jharkhand Education Project to libraries meant for primary 

 and middle school students has left the government red-faced 

 because of their risqu? content. 

 The book, Superhit Jokes, authored by Harish Yadav, has been published by the Delhi-based Pustak Mahal. The jokes, some of which refer to national leaders such as Sarojini Naidu, contain sexual innuendoes not fit for the eyes of junior school students. 

 That the book was occupying place on the library shelves along with literary classics like Oliver Twist and Treasure Island was first noticed by a teacher in Ghatshila, who immediately took up the matter with subdivisional officer Amitabh Kaushal. 

 Kaushal ordered the withdrawal of the books from all schools under him. 

 State project director Jyotsna Verma Ray was not available for comment. Human resource development secretary Ashok Kumar Singh ordered an inquiry yesterday.

 Education department sources said the books had not been distributed in all Jharkhand schools. ?The matter is not so serious. The books have not been distributed in the entire state. A district-level committee selects books for libraries. We are trying to find out how this book was picked,? said an official. Sources said the jokes are downright vulgar and are littered with double meanings. Some of them even target India?s icons. 

 Sample this: ?The first woman governor of the country, Sarojini Naidu, had a good sense of humour. Once she went to meet the then West Bengal Governor C. Rajagopalachari. Rajaji took Naidu to his Raj Bhavan. Rajaji showed her his bedroom and his cot in Raj Bhavan. While showing his beautiful cot to Naidu, he said: ?What is the use of the cot for a widower and an old man like me?? At this, Naidu replied: ?I have earlier helped you many times but this time I cannot do anything.? 

 Some of the jokes are downright ribald. ?Shikarpuria was travelling in a bus. A woman, sitting in front of his seat, was breast-feeding her baby. Shikarpuria asked the woman ?Sister! How is your baby so healthy?? The woman replied: ?I cannot say. I feed baby my own milk and orange juice.? Hearing the woman?s reply, Shikarpuria asked: ?Does your breast give milk or orange juice???

 Another joke reads: ?Is kissing healthy?? a girl asked, when she was kissed. She got the reply: ?Though it does not contain vitamin, it helps cure pain.?

 Teachers were aghast when the book of jokes was brought to their notice. ?Humour is acceptable, but the jokes in this book go beyond the limits of decency, more so when it is meant to be distributed among schoolchildren,? said a senior teacher in a Ranchi school.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Dogged by ?legal ordeals?

 R. VENKATARAMAN

 New Delhi, Dec. 23: In the five years that he reigned, P.V. Narasimha Rao lurched from one ?legal ordeal? to another.

 Rao made history by becoming the first Prime Minister to be convicted of bribery by a trial court. The JMM bribery case rocked the nation after four Jharkhand Mukti Morcha MPs, including present Union minister Shibu Soren, were alleged to have been paid crores of rupees to defeat the July 1993 no-confidence motion against the government.

 However, Rao was acquitted. Delhi High Court quashed the three-year sentence the trial court had handed down.

 In the St Kitts forgery case, Rao faced the charge of helping forge documents to malign his predecessor V.P. Singh. The documents showed that Singh?s son, Ajeya, had an illegal bank account in the Caribbean island worth millions of dollars. As foreign minister in the Rajiv Gandhi government, Rao had allegedly ordered the documents to be attested through the Indian high commission in London. In this case, too, he was discharged for lack of evidence.

 The Lakhubhai Pathak cheating case is virtually buried with the pickle king?s death. But Pathak generated enough heat when he accused Rao of duping him of $100,000 with the promise of a contract for supply of newsprint and paper pulp. Rao was cleared of the charge only last December.

 The urea scam was the biggest in the sense that the entire money, Rs 130 crore, was paid as advance without a grain of urea reaching Indian shores. Rao?s son P.V. Prabhakar Rao was allegedly involved. But the enforcement directorate stopped questioning Prabhakar Rao and no chargesheet has been filed against him.

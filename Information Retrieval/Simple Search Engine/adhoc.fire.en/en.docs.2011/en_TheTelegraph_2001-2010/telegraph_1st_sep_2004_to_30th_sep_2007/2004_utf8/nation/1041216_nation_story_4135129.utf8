 Smut schoolboy chase

 AYSWARIA VENUGOPAL

 New Delhi, Dec. 15: IIT 

 student Ravi Raj has been thrust into public glare for selling 

 smut on the Net but the schoolboy who is suspected to have 

 shot the video clip has so far stayed in the shadows.

 However, the comfort of anonymity may end soon as police have begun investigations to find out whether the clip could be traced back to the erstwhile student of Delhi Public School, R.K. Puram, who engaged in a sexual act with a girl. 

 Delhi police sources said the footage on the video clip suggests that only the boy could have shot it on the mobile phone during the escapade with the girl, both Class XI students. So far, the police could not probe the boy?s role as no one has registered any complaint.

 However, the police are now trying to establish whether the boy passed on the clip to a friend who sold it to the underground market, from where it reached Ravi Raj. The IIT student, who was picked up yesterday on the Kharagpur IIT campus, has been taken to Delhi on a five-day transit remand. 

 The police are investigating a trail that suggests that the Delhi boy?s friend had sold the clip for Rs 10,000 to someone. If the sale and the friend?s link with the schoolboy could be established, the police would have to either proceed against the teenager or question him as a witness.

 Ravi Raj, who has been charged with selling the clip on an Internet auction site, was suspended from the IIT today. But the boy who started it all has now found admission in another renowned school in Delhi. Sources said he is the son of an exporter living in a sprawling house in an upscale South Delhi neighbourhood. The girl, who is said to be good in studies, has left Delhi for Canada.

 The arrest of the IIT student has had a fallout on the underground compact disc market in the capital, which was briskly selling copies of the video clip sporting inlay cards labelled ?DPS Dhamaka?. 

 Following raids conducted by the economic offences wing of Delhi police today, copies of the CD have gone off the shelves. The police are also investigating reports that the clip was sold on other websites. 

 Ravi Raj had received a draft for Rs 17,787 from the auction site as payments for the merchandise he sold. The sale of the school clips had fetched him around Rs 1,000 while the rest was for selling DVD players and other pornographic material, the police said.

 The eight people who bought the clip have been identified as two engineering students in Delhi, an employee of an event management company, a doctor from Chennai, a call centre employee in Hyderabad, two engineers from Bangalore and a woman from Chennai.

 Bakery case

 Mumbai, Nov. 1: The second eyewitness in the Best Bakery case, Raees Khan, identified five of the accused in court today, reports our special correspondent.

 Among them, three had earlier been identified by the first eyewitness, Taufel Ahmad.

 Unlike Ahmad, who was scared and had to be reassured by police and the prosecution while identifying the accused, Khan was ?not frightened?. 

 Gujarat police recorded two ?statements? as being made by the 19-year-old Khan, who used to work in Baroda.

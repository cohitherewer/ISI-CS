 Sangh ok, VHP not 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi, Oct. 18: The Sangh parivar is divided 

on the appointment of L.K. Advani as the BJP president. 

 While the RSS welcomed it, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad sounded upset. But BJP sources said the RSS? endorsement was ?far more important? to them than the VHP?s, whose ?extreme ideology? was out of sync with the current political ambience.

 The RSS hoped that Advani?s appointment would meet the expectations of the ?larger Hindu movement? and re-establish the BJP?s credentials as a ?party with a difference?. 

 ?He is a highly respected and mature leader who had grown up in the Sangh ideology and understands the significance of the sentiments of the people spearheading the ideology. Naturally, we hope that he would be able to bring the changes necessary to meet the expectations of all,? Sangh spokesman Ram Madhav said.

 The VHP expressed disappointment. ?By electing the leader who is responsible for betraying Hindus, the BJP has given a message that they don?t want to return to Hindutva,? said general secretary Praveen Togadia.

 He recalled that Advani had not only described the demolition of the Babri mosque as the ?most shameful day? in his life but also termed the post-Godhra riots as a ?blot?. 

 ?He chose to take the priest of Ajmer Sharif and not the Sankaracharya on his pre-election Bharat Uday yatra to get a fatwa issued by the Shahi Imam in the party?s favour,? added Togadia.

Uma ill on hill trek

 Uma Bharti complained of chest pain while trekking to the Himalayan shrine of Buda Madmaheshwar, sources said. 

The sadhvi is in Uttaranchal and may be airlifted 

to Delhi if necessary.

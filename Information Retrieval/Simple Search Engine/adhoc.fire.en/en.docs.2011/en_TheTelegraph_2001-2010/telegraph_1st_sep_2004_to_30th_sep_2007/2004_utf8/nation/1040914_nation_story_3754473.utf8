 Patil does a Singh

 ALOKE TIKKU

 New Delhi, Sept. 13: The United Progressive Alliance government?s first Jammu and Kashmir initiative will have to wait as Union home minister Shivraj Patil appears set to follow Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in putting off his visit to the state.

 Singh was slated to begin his two-day trip on Thursday while Patil is scheduled to visit the state next week. The Prime Minister called off his visit on Saturday after the Election Commission told the state government Singh could not visit or meet officials in Srinagar, Anantnag, Jammu and Kathua. By-polls are to be held there on October 13.

 The Prime Minister?s visit was put off as it was felt that the model code of conduct would not permit him to derive the political mileage the UPA government hoped for by having him address rallies and cut ribbons.

 Singh was expected to address a rally in Srinagar to announce a hike in central assistance, lay the foundation stone for the South Kashmir campus of Kashmir University in Anantnag, deliver the convocation address at the Sher-e-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences and flag off the first train on the Jammu-Udhampur railway line.

 Patil, who was still finalising his tour schedule till this evening, wanted to visit Ladakh, Jammu and Srinagar and tour the areas where the Border Security Force has been deployed to see first-hand the fencing project it has undertaken.

 The home minister, who met Jammu amp; Kashmir deputy chief minister Mangat Ram Sharma this evening to work out the details of his three-day visit that is scheduled to begin on September 24, said he is still undecided.

 Unlike Singh, Patil had no plans to address huge political rallies where he would make announcements for the entire state. But the home minister conceded he could not go there empty-handed and may have to make some announcement, possibly on increasing security forces? recruitment from border areas.

 Officials said Patil?s visit would not violate the model code of conduct if he keeps off the four election-bound constituencies and makes his announcements elsewhere.

 His junior ministers ? S. Reghupathy and Sriprakash Jaiswal ? have already toured Jammu and Kashmir once, inspecting border fencing and receiving briefings from the state police. Patil?s visit, an official said, would have been along similar lines.

 If the minister does put off his visit, he will make sure he heads to the Valley once elections are over.

 New Delhi, Dec. 9: India today told the US that its supply of sophisticated weaponry to Pakistan is a matter of concern when the New Delhi-Islamabad peace talks were ?generating the right atmospherics?, senior officials said here today after US secretary of defence Donald Rumsfeld?s visit.

 The defence secretary was quoted as having said Washington is ?sensitive? to Indian concerns.

 President George Bush had ?impressed upon all his senior colleagues the importance of improving relations with India? and that ?(India) is going to have a very important role to play in the world?, Rumsfeld told senior Indian leaders, Indian and American officials said. At the top of Rumsfeld?s agenda on the visit initiated by Washington was conveying to New Delhi before the inauguration of the second Bush administration next month that India is a top-priority country.

 Rumsfeld met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, defence minister Pranab Mukherjee and external affairs minister K. Natwar Singh.

 It was in Rumsfeld?s meeting with Mukherjee that India raised the issue of the US? proposed sale of F-16 fighter aircraft and P-3C Orion surveillance aircraft to Pakistan. The officials quoted Rumsfeld has having said he was ?sensitive? to India?s concerns. The officials stressed that Rumsfeld?s visit was an opportunity to ?sensitise? Washington to the delicate nature of the peace process with Pakistan and that it was important to maintain the right external atmosphere for the talks.

 Rumsfeld and his team were informed that India?s concerns on the supply of arms to Pakistan were twofold. First, India is de-inducting troops from Kashmir ? over which Washington has expressed concern in the past ? and this was helpful for talks. Second, India is concerned that the US should consider selling equipment that are conventional military hardware and not weapons specifically meant for the war on terrorism.

 India also clarified that while the US regarded Pakistan as an ally in its war on terrorism, New Delhi is not convinced of this despite counter-terrorist operations by Islamabad in Waziristan. India has been given to understand that Pakistan?s importance to the US arose from the ?regional considerations? of the ?war against terrorism?.

 ?We have expressed concern on the repercussions of the US arms supplied on the ongoing India-Pakistan dialogue that is poised at a sensitive juncture,? external affairs ministry spokesperson Navtej Sarna said. ?These (arms supplies) can impact on the positive sentiments and goodwill for the US in India.?

 A defence ministry official said Rumsfeld was told that Washington should note the ?perception of the US in India?.

 Rumsfeld signalled that the second Bush administration would seek a deeper engagement with India.

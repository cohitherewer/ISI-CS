 Bihar cloud on Centre allies

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 14: The Left parties and the Rashtriya Janata Dal are best of friends in the seat of power in Delhi. But back in Bihar, on the eve of every election ? Assembly or Lok Sabha ? the equation changes from friendliness to acrimony.

 This time, the by-election to the Madhepura parliamentary constituency is threatening to drive a wedge between the Left and the RJD.

 RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav had won from both Madhepura and Chhapra in the last Lok Sabha elections but resigned from the former.

 The CPM unit in Bihar wants to put up a candidate against the RJD in the coming elections. It is still not known whether the CPI wants to follow suit. It is, however, unlikely that Laloo Prasad will give up the seat to the Left.

 Central CPM leaders, as often in the past, are walking a tightrope on the issue. On the one hand they cannot summarily dismiss the state unit?s claims. On the other, they also do not want to rub Laloo Prasad the wrong way.

 ?Our state secretariat is meeting tomorrow to take a decision. The party politburo meeting on September 17 will discuss the decision,? said politburo member Sitaram Yechury.

 For the CPI, fielding a candidate in Madhepura will be easier because the party is not in an alliance with the RJD in Bihar. 

 In fact, the Bihar unit of the CPI has been agitating against the RJD and lack of governance in the state. The CPM unit, on the other hand, has kept away from the agitation because it is in an alliance with Laloo Prasad.

 But the alliance was not of much use to the CPM in thrashing out a seat-share arrangement with Laloo Prasad in the last Lok Sabha polls. The CPM had even then staked claim to Madhepura, but Laloo Prasad did not oblige. The RJD chief held prolonged negotiations with the CPM but ignored its proposal for fielding candidates in five constituencies.

 At present, relations between the Left and the RJD are extremely amiable in Delhi, particularly after Laloo Prasad became railway minister. Even the CPI, which in the past had been cut up with the RJD leader, has been full of praise for him.

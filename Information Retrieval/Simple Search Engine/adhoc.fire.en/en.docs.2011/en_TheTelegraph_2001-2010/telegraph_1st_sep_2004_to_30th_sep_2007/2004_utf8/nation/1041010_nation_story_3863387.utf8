 BCCI plea against HC order

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 9: The cricket board today moved a special leave petition in the Supreme Court against the Madras High Court order that restrained its newly-elected office-bearers from assuming charge.

 Arguments will begin on Monday before a bench headed by Justice . Santosh Hegde, who also presides over the five-judge Constitution bench hearing the telecast rights case between Zee TV and the BCCI. Board counsel Radha Rengaswamy tried to list the matter for today itself but the court registry fixed Monday for the hearings. 

 The BCCI said in its plea the high court?s order yesterday has made it difficult for the board to even select players for the ongoing Test series with Australia. ?(The Madras) High Court order restraining the newly elected board from functioning will prevent the process of selection of players by the selection committee for the Test series with Australia and the appointment of third and fourth umpires by the umpires committee,? the board said.

 It contended that the court order would bring Indian cricket ?to a standstill?. ?In the event the high court order is given effect to and acted upon, the entire game of cricket at (the) national and international level would come to a standstill,? the SLP said, seeking an ?ex-parte stay? on the order.

 The BCCI said retired apex court judge S. Mohan did not have the ?authority to select players? for the Indian team.

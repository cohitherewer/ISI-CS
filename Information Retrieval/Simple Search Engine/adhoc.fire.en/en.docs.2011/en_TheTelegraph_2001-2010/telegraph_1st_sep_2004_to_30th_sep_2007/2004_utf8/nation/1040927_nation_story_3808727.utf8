 Kudos for Benegal?s Netaji

 London, Sept. 26: Indian directors are set to make a big impact at the London Film Festival, with Shyam Benegal?s Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose: The Forgotten Hero being one of the highlights.

 ?This is a very important film, a three-and-three-quarter hour historical epic,? said the British Film Institute?s Cary Rajinder Sawhney, who helped choose most of the Indian entries.

 If Netaji was ever forgotten, he certainly isn?t now. There is a biography out on him and BBC Radio 4 has just broadcast a documentary on the Indian prisoners of war who fell into the hands of the Nazis at a time when Netaji had a meeting with Hitler.

 Sawhney found Benegal?s Hindi-language film ?very, very good?.

 He said: ?It gives us a view of India which you don?t see in the west. The stereotypical view is that the Indian freedom movement was non-violent, a view that you get in films like Richard Attenborough?s Gandhi. You know it wasn?t.?

 Commenting on the popularity of Bollywood in Britain ? this is increasingly becoming a lucrative business for all concerned ? Sawhney said the inability of British actors, even British Asians, to speak Hindi would restrict their roles in Indian films.

 ?The future lies in English-language Indian films,? he predicted. ?I have seen 10 such films.?

 One is Mira Nair?s Vanity Fair, which was shot in Bath. It has already been released in America to less than ecstatic reviews, but the London Film Festival reviewer, Sandra Hebron, has been more generous.

 ?Nair?s understanding of the colonial underpinnings of British society enables her to bring a fresh perspective to the classic material, whilst her exuberant visual style makes it a sumptuous, sensory treat,? writes Hebron.

 Another English language film at the festival, which runs from October 20 to November 4, is American Daylight, set against the background of call centres. 

 The female star is India Today editor Aroon Purie?s daughter, Koel, who pretends to be ?Sue? and develops a relationship with a man on the phone. 

 ?The trouble is he is in Texas, she is in India,? Sawhney pointed out.

 Sawhney also spoke highly of Raincoat, made by the ?celebrated Bengali director Rituparno Ghosh?, which stars the ubiquitous Aishwarya Rai and Ajay Devgan who give ?virtuoso performances as two fated lovers?.

 Sawhney described it as ?an intense romantic drama with Chekovian hues?.

 ?These performances show that actors and actresses from Bollywood are more than able to match Hollywood,? observed Sawhney.

 Now that Manmohan Singh and Tony Blair agreed in their recent joint declaration that there should be increased co-operation in the field of film production, there will be added interest in a conference on Indo-British collaborations in making movies organised by the Commonwealth Business Forum in London on October 29.

 Sawhney, who is to chair the conference, said: ?Subhash Ghai, Mira Nair, Shyam Benegal and others coming to the film festival will be there.?

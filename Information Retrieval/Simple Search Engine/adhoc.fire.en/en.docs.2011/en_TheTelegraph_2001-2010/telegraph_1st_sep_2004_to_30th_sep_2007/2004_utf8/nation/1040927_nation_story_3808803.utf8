 Naga rebels challenge CM?s writ

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Kohima, Sept. 26: The NSCN (I-M) has stepped into the political limelight, appropriating for itself the role of a government.

 With the ban on the Naga outfit no longer in place, it is slowly but surely shedding its ?underground? tag. From social vigilantism, it is now overtly trying to step into the Neiphiu Rio ministry?s domain.

 The chief minister has not taken kindly to the move. 

 The NSCN (I-M) has directed all private schools in Nagaland to register themselves with it, a step perceived by the government as an ?intrusion? into its affairs.

 The schools have also been asked to add four more days to their list of holidays by incorporating in the list the ?Naga national holidays?. These include the outfit?s raising day (on January 31). The other three are ?agony day ? a day of sadness for the nation? on September 27, ?Naga republic day? on March 21 and ?independence day? on August 14. 

 The chief minister described the directive as ?direct interference? in the government?s functioning. ?They cannot issue any directive to the schools as this is entirely under the jurisdiction of the state government,? he said. 

 Rio made it clear that his government would not allow itself to be ?dictated? by the outfit in this manner. 

 In a press communiqu?, NSCN (I-M) deputy secretary L. Luiyik said the outfit was concerned about the quality of education in private schools. He said the organisation had been forced to monitor the functioning of such schools. This, he argued, necessitated registration of schools with the organisation. 

 The outfit also wants the student-teacher ratio in each school to be maintained at 50:1. It further said all teachers should undergo basic training. ?Maladministration in the education sector will be checked by the GPRN (Government of the People?s Republic of Nagalim),? it declared. 

 The NSCN (I-M) statement said such steps were necessary to enable students to ?grow in the right direction?. 

 It also issued a list of directives to schools on hostel facilities. No private hostel will be allowed to be set up without the outfit?s permission. 

 The NSCN (I-M) even mentioned the size and number of rooms a hostel ought to have and the composition of the teaching staff. ?Sixty per cent of the teachers in a school should be local indigenous people.? It had recently published advertisements in newspapers seeking applications from local youths for recruitment to its civil and armed wings.

 The organisation had long been running a parallel government, but never before directly interfered in the functioning of the state government. It only collected ?taxes? from government departments. 

 Rio appreciated the steps taken by the outfit to eliminate ?social menaces? like drug abuse and black marketing of liquor in the dry state. ?It is not that we are taking any help from them. Any good step for the welfare of the society, by anyone, is always welcome.?

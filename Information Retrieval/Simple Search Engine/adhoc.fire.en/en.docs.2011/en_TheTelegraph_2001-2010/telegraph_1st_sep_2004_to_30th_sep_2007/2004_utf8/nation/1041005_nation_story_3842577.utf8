 Britain sees India threat

 AMIT ROY

 Gordon Brown

 London, Oct. 4: Gordon Brown, the chancellor of the exchequer and the most important man in the government after Tony Blair, appears to be on the warpath against India and China. 

 At least, it appears that way to some senior Indian observers in London after the chancellor?s comments in the US over the weekend were headlined in today?s Times newspaper. Brown had made similar comments at last week?s Labour Party conference in Brighton when he said Britain ?can be the global success story of future years? but for that to happen, the country ?must respond to the global economic challenge of countries like China and India?.

 Is Brown, whose ambitions of taking over as Prime Minister have been frustrated by Blair?s declared intention to serve a full third term if Labour is re-elected, pitching Britain against India? Some Indian observers say the Times story ?definitely is negative?.

 The report, headlined ?Brown sounds warning on might of China and India?, by its Washington correspondent begins: ?Gordon Brown yesterday gave his strongest warning yet of the threat to Britain?s prosperity posed by the rising economic might of China and India and urged businesses to do more to meet the growing strategic threat to their markets.?

 It went on: ?In his starkest comments yet on implications for the UK of the emergence of China and India as economic powerhouses, the chancellor highlighted their vast cost advantage over the UK industry and vowed to do more to bolster British companies as they fight to retain their grip on key global markets.?

 The Times continued: ?Addressing fellow world finance ministers at the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund in Washington, Mr Brown noted that the wage costs of Chinese and Indian companies were ?just 5 per cent of those in the UK?. Mr Brown said that Britain could not compete on cost with this new economic challenge by cutting wages and instead must do far more to bolster productivity by boosting the skills of the nation?s workforce.?

 ?Mr Brown?s heightened attention to the economic energy of China and India came after China?s top economic officials this weekend, for the first time, participated informally in meetings of finance ministers and central bankers of the Group of Seven leading economies,? the paper said.

 When Manmohan Singh had talks with Blair at 10 Downing Street, last month, the two Prime Ministers struck an entirely different and much more positive attitude. They saw India and Britain as equal partners, who were now resolved to take their economic relationship to an entirely different level through close cooperation in many fields.

 The attitude of the British government so far, as stated by many cabinet ministers, has been: ?What?s good for India is also good for Britain.?

 Brown, who might be trying to get closer to the trade unions who have been angry at the loss of outsourcing jobs to India, appears to be saying: ?What?s good for India is bad for Britain.?

 At least, that is how his warning about the rise of India has been interpreted by some Indian personalities in London.

 Luckily for Brown, who is widely seen as the architect behind Britain?s economic success after seven unbroken years as chancellor, he is not without influential Indian friends who support Labour.

 One of them, Sir Gulam Noon, immediate past president of the London Chamber of Commerce and still on its board, insisted: ?Gordon Brown has not said anything negative. He?s stating a fact of life ? India and China are becoming the economic powerhouses. Britain cannot compete with India on price advantage. What can he do about it??

 What he has to do is some serious explaining to the Indian government.

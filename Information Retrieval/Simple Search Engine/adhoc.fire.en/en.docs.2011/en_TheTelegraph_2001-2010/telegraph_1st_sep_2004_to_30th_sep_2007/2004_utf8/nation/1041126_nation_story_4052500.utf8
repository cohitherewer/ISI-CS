 Airport director spills bribe chain

 New Delhi: The Hyderbad director of the 

 Airports Authority of India, who was arrested by the CBI 

 on Wednesday on bribery charges, has told interrogators 

 that he had to share the booty with his superiors, reports 

 our special correspondent.

 However, K. Ramakrishna admitted that he made quite a sum for himself, too. 

 CBI officials said when they raided his house, they found documents suggesting Ramakrishna owned three houses besides a plot of land. 

 The search also led to the discovery of Rs 2 lakh in cash, another Rs 12.5 lakh stashed away in a bank locker and deposits in bank accounts.

 During preliminary questioning, sources said, Ramakrishna had admitted to taking bribe from a man, who was awarded a contract for running two shops on the Hyderabad airport premises.

 ?He said he had to share the money with his superiors,? a CBI sleuth said.

 Notice on ex-militant in army

 New Delhi (PTI): The Supreme Court on 

 Thursday issued notices to the Jammu and Kashmir government 

 and the Centre on an application stating that a militant 

 who had surrendered was appointed a commissioned officer 

 in the Indian Army.

 A bench of Chief Justice R.C. Lahoti and Justice G.P. Mathur issued the notices on an application filed by a human rights and civil liberties organisation, which alleged that Dahir Ahmed alias Thathu, who was in charge of the Ikhwan-ul-Muslemoon, had been recruited by the army.

 The organisation had earlier filed a petition challenging the state government?s policy of giving huge financial grants to militants who surrender, saying such grants would encourage citizens of other states to take up arms.

 The petitioner urged the court to quash the state?s policy of giving Rs 1.5 lakh as a fixed deposit in the name of the surrendering militant. The militant would also be entitled to a monthly allowance of Rs 2,000 and an incentive up to Rs 1 lakh depending on the weapons surrendered, the petitioner said.

 Sukhoi, Indian-made

 Nashik, Nov. 28: It can fly, it can turn turtle, dip sideways, take a somersault and appear to be hurtling down when it suddenly picks up speed and soars straight up. Then it can hang in air, almost still, can nosedive and start falling freely. It plays in the sky like a dolphin dances in the waves. Those watching it can?t have enough.

 But it can also drop missiles. Or bombs. Or rockets. It?s one of Indian Air Force?s prize ?multirole? fighters ? the lean, mean Sukhoi 30 that charms its audience by playing pranks in the air, but is one of the country?s deadliest assets in war. 

 Now it is made in India. But how Indian is indigenous?

 The Centre and the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) announced the first ?indigenous? production of a Sukhoi 30 aircraft in Nashik today. At a function at the HAL plant presided over by defence minister Pranab Mukherjee and his deputy V.K. Handique ? after the Sukhoi 30 aircraft, SU 30 Mki, did the rounds of the small stretch of blue sky over the plant runway in a scintillating performance that lasted about 10 minutes, including a cobra manoeuvre ? outgoing HAL chairperson N.R. Mohanty announced that it was the country?s first Sukhoi aircraft not made in Russia.

 The 21.9-metre-long Sukhoi that can fly up to 3,000 km without refuelling came to India after the October 2000 pact between Russia and India and a subsequent contract for transfer of technology. India was to acquire the cutting-edge aircraft that would greatly enhance its defence capabilities. The pact also projected production of 140 aircraft, its engines and equipment.

 The Sukhoi that took off today, HAL said, was fitted with indigenously developed equipment such as mission computer, radar computer and radar warning system, developed by the Defence Avionics Research Establishment. It added, however, that equipment such as flight data recorder and navigational system were imported from Russia.

 At a news conference later, Mohanty said the indigenisation will be done in a phased manner ? of the 140 Sukhoi aircraft, 114 will be built out of raw materials in India; the rest will be made out of assembled parts, several of them Russian exports.

 But the pilot today was Russian.

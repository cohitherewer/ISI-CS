 Rahul on road mission

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Lucknow, Oct. 10: Rahul Gandhi is expected in Amethi tomorrow for an interaction with his constituents ? the fifth since he was elected to the Lok Sabha in May ? to decide which roads needed immediate attention. 

 Congress sources said Rs 10 crore has been sanctioned by the Congress-led Centre and at least 11 roads are likely to be taken up for development in the Gandhi pocket borough.

 Earlier, Rs 9.72 crore was given for the repair and reconstruction of a 24-km road in Amethi. 

 While Rahul is busy building roads with his voters, the distance from his party workers is increasing. 

 Congress workers are discontented over his non-availability to campaign in the state for 12 Assembly byelections on October 13. 

 Supporters in the poll-bound segments seemed demoralised as they concluded a lacklustre campaign today. 

 Even party leaders have accepted in private that they don?t expect to win more than two seats. 

 The party had hoped to snatch at least three more seats riding on Rahul?s popularity, believing he would lead a couple of roadshows like he did during the general elections. 

 According to party insiders, many candidates withdrew from campaign much earlier sensing defeat. ?If it is a test case for improving the Congress image in Uttar Pradesh, we have lost,? said a senior leader. 

 Rahul, who will spend four days in Amethi, might meet party workers in Amethi once, said the source. 

 Workers might seethe, but the Congress heir apparent knows what he is doing. 

 ?Amethi will continue to be the microcosm of my political model. This is how I want to have direct first-hand knowledge of politics. Only if I can do justice to my voters can I think of going beyond this constituency. I foresee many more such visits to Amethi,? he had said in August, during his last visit to Amethi.

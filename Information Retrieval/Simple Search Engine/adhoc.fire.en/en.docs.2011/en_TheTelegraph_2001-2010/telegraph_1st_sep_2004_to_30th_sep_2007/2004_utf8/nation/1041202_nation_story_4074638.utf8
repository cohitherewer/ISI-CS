 Cong dusts varsity gun

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Dec. 1: The Congress has decided to exploit the controversy over a proposed Urdu university in the course of its campaign for parliamentary bypolls scheduled later this month.

 Senior party leaders said the university, to be set up for Rs 150 crore, would figure prominently in the campaign for the Akbarpur and Mainpuri constituencies, which will go to the polls on December 20.

 The aim is to strike before the Samajwadi Party can get into the act as the ruling party may have to wait for a few days for governor T.V. Rajeswar?s consent to the Maulana Mohammad Ali Jauhar Urdu University bill.

 ?We are in the government and we have passed the bill. We will give some time to the governor before firing a fresh salvo,? a senior Samajwadi Party leader said here.

 The bill was passed yesterday by voice vote in the Assembly amid a storm of protest from the Congress and the BJP.

 The bill was today sent to Rao, who had opposed it on the same grounds as the Congress ? making state parliamentary affairs minister Azam Khan the lifetime pro-chancellor.

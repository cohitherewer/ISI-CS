 Tea industry split on bonus formula 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Dibrugarh, Sept. 7: The garden-grading formula that was to have been the basis for fixing the rate of bonus to tea workers this year was today shelved after some members of the Consultative Committee of Plantation Associations (CCPA) objected to being put in the top bracket. 

 The lack of consensus in the CCPA was embarrassing for the industry, which had only recently convinced labour unions that grading tea gardens on the basis of profitability was the best way to decide who should pay how much.

 No agreement could be reached on the grading formula since the CCPA failed to come up with a concrete proposal. Therefore, it has been decided that the earlier method of paying bonus through negotiations and bilateral agreements will be adopted this year, too, a joint statement by three associations, including one representing the industry, said. 

 The development came a day after the Assam Chah Karmachari Sangha, which represents office staff of tea companies, gave industry the freedom to solve the problem at hand before taking up its demand for pay revision. 

 A source in the CCPA said the grading proposal died a premature death because some companies lobbied for lower grades to avoid paying bonus at high rates. Many gardens that paid bonus at the rate of over 15 per cent last year wanted to be in the C or D category. Associations of relatively smaller gardens objected, leading to infighting. 

 Some of the CCPA constituents suggested three bonus slabs on the basis of labour output a worker who toiled for 300 days or more should get a 20 per cent bonus, somebody who worked for 200 days should be entitled to 15 per cent and the rest should be happy with a rate between 8.33 and 10 per cent.

 The Assam Tea Planters Association vetoed the proposal. Such a system might create more confusion and law and order problems. 

 The rate of bonus payable to workers has long been the subject of a bitter dispute between tea companies and labour unions. 

 Last year, irate workers killed three tea executives during the unrest over bonus. The crisis reached flashpoint when seven labourers were killed in police firing at Khobang tea estate of Tinsukia district. 

 The industry and the state government initiated negotiations on bonus rates three months before Durga Puja to avoid a rerun of the incidents that marred the festive season last year. The Assam Chah Mazdoor Sangha (ACMS) agreed to the proposed grading system as an experiment. 

 ACMS general secretary Madhusudhan Khandait said he had issued circulars to all gardens, asking them to finalise bonus rates as soon as possible. We do not want it to be dragged till just before the Pujas, when labourers become restless for their bonus.

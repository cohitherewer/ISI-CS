 Pilot brawls delay planes

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Dec. 13: Pilots were at the centre of in-flight storms in Mumbai today. An altercation with one delayed a plane to Calcutta for as many as five hours and another?s flight without air-conditioning triggered a political uproar in Maharashtra.

 The Indian Airlines flight to Calcutta could not take off because the pilot had a tiff with a passenger. Officially, the airline blamed the delay on ?operational error?.

 After a prolonged standoff, another pilot flew the plane, originally scheduled to reach Calcutta around 8 pm.

 The ride from Mumbai had turned bumpy in the morning itself with passengers of a Jet Airways flight saying they were treated badly by a pilot.

 The flight to Nagpur, which was scheduled to depart at 7.05 am, was delayed following a dispute between its pilot and angry passengers who complained that the plane?s air-conditioning system was not working. 

 Several ministers and MLAs, who were on the flight to attend the winter session of the Assembly being held in Nagpur, joined the fray. 

 ?It was very evident soon after we entered the plane that the air-conditioning was not working. We took the matter up with the pilot, who was adamant and determined to fly in this condition,? said BJP legislator Gopinath Munde.

 ?The passengers became very angry and went to the cockpit and opened the door, but the pilot still insisted on flying,? said Munde. Minister of state for labour Baba Siddique was among the passengers who opened the door. 

 ?A Jet engineer present on the flight also advised the pilot not to fly, but he did not listen,? said Munde. 

 The atmosphere inside the plane had reportedly become suffocating. Then the airline arranged for another plane that took off two-and-a-half hours after the scheduled time. 

 On reaching Nagpur, the MLAs took the matter up in the Assembly. Deputy chief minister and home minister R.R. Patil announced a high-level probe into the behaviour of the pilot.

 Patil said an FIR would be filed, adding that aviation experts will be consulted on the appropriateness of flying an aircraft when its air-conditioning system was not working. Jet Airways said the morning flight was delayed because of ?an engineering error?.

 Mauritius off Manmohan roster

 Manmohan Singh: Not keen on trips

 New Delhi, Dec. 14: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh?s proposed visit to Mauritius later this month has been called off. 

 The move comes at a time when India has been making statements about a review of its agreement with Mauritius to avoid double taxation. The pact allows companies registered in Mauritius to pay the low local tax and make investments in India, where the levy is much higher. Indications suggest that the island-nation, which has been benefiting from the agreement, is not willing to tango. 

 Singh was set to travel to Mauritius for two days from December 26. South Block is yet to react officially as the trip was not formally announced. Sources said the visit was called off because of a ?scheduling problem?. 

 Foreign ministry officials pointed out in private that Singh, unlike his predecessors, is not too keen on travelling abroad frequently. So far, he has been on foreign visits only to participate in regional or multilateral meets. The Mauritius visit would have been his first bilateral visit. 

 South Block officials do not expect the cancellation to have any negative impact on bilateral ties as Sonia Gandhi, the Congress chief and chairperson of the United Progressive Alliance, visited Mauritius a few weeks ago to inaugurate a centre named after Rajiv Gandhi. 

 But in some diplomatic and political circles, Singh?s move is bound to be viewed in relation to India?s unhappiness with its tax pact with Mauritius. The agreement was signed in the early nineties and has helped turn the island into the beachhead for all investments into India because of the tax breaks offered by successive governments there. 

 Delhi has been wary about the misuse of the agreement by several foreign companies and investors to avoid paying taxes on income generated in India. It wants to negotiate a fresh deal with Mauritius. ?We will revisit some aspects of the treaty to ensure that provisions of the model DDTA (the tax agreement) are reflected,? finance minister P. Chidambaram told Parliament last week. 

 But he also made it clear that since Delhi has excellent relations with Mauritius, nothing should be done in haste and jeopardise bilateral ties. The finance minister said he was consulting the external affairs ministry and formal re-negotiation on the treaty had not begun. 

 The tax agreement with Mauritius has run into trouble on a number of occasions, particularly during the 2001 stock scam. Many in India felt that several rogue investors had misused the terms of the treaty to dodge taxes on their earnings in the country. According to official estimates, there are over 20,000 companies, including more than 7,000 global firms, currently registered in Mauritius.

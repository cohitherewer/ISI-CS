 US watch on Indian ships

 Mumbai (PTI): India continues to 

 be on the United States Coast Guard?s ?watch list? after 

 14 Indian flagships were detained abroad from January 2004 

 till date for failing to meet the guidelines set by the 

 Port State Control inspection authorities.

 The inspection body, an authority coordinated by the International Maritime Organisation, carries out inspection of foreign ships at various ports to verify if their equipment comply with international regulations and if the vessel is manned and operated in compliance with these norms.

 The number of such ships has, however, decreased in the last six months as a result of strict remedial measures taken by the Indian shipowners in consultation with the director-general of shipping, officials of the Indian National Shipowners? Association said.

 As many as 11 Indian ships were detained between January and April 2004. ?Gradually, the detention came down due to all-round efforts of the director-general of shipping in consultation with the industry and the classification societies,? an official said. 

 India remains on the ?black list? in the medium-risk category under the Paris memorandum of understanding and on the ?grey list? under the Tokyo MoU 2003.

 Farmer curfew in Rajasthan

 Jaipur (PTI): Four Rajasthan towns remained 

 under curfew on Tuesday as the situation continued to be

 water supply from the Indira Gandhi canal for rabi crops.

 Almost all towns in Sriganganagar district observed a bandh on Tuesday to protest police action against the agitating farmers.

 The farmers were also demanding the release of their three leaders ? Hetram Beniwal, Sahib Singh Punia and Vallabh Kochar ? arrested under the National Security Act for inciting violence.

 The agitation in the first-phase areas of the canal project spread to neighbouring Bikaner district on Monday and one person was killed in a stampede in Khajuwala during a clash between the agitators and the police.

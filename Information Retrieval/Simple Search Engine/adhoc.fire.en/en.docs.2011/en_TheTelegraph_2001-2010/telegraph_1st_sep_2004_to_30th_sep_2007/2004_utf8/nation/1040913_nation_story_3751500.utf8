 Antony does a reality check

 JOHN MARY

 Antony

 Thiruvananthapuram, Sept. 12: Much of A.K. Antony?s time these days is spent reading or attending to an occasional visitor at Anjanam, his modest residence. And some of it doing a ?reality check?. 

 ?I need time to unwind and look at my three-and-a-half years in office. Conduct a reality check myself? I?ve not planned anything. I was getting ready to quit but the Congress high command?s permission came rather late in the day,? the former Kerala chief minister told The Telegraph.

 Before taking up his new assignment as chairman of the Congress screening committee for the Maharashtra Assembly elections, he plans to meet party chief Sonia Gandhi, possibly next week after the election of the Speaker here.

 His arch foe K. Karunakaran might say Antony should ?let the new generation take over, with both of us stepping aside?. At 86, it is for Karunakaran to say so, but Antony has another 23 years to reach that age.

 Antony?s first priority would be to set the contours of his new role in the Kerala Assembly. 

 Once a high command favourite as the architect of the Congress-led United Democratic Front?s victory in the May 2001 Kerala elections, Antony now finds himself out of reckoning, even as his successor, Oommen Chandy, hogs the limelight. 

 Antony?s presence in the front row of the treasury benches might embarrass Chandy, with the Marxist-led Opposition trying to prove the chief minister is an Antony clone and not much should be expected from him. Chandy?s efforts would be to live down his image as a mere Antony successor. But this redefining of their relationship might witness some bitterness.

 Antony has his limitations in encouraging a group build-up around him, given his open stand against factionalism. There have been few like him in recent times who gave up office for not being able to ensure the party?s victory in the Lok Sabha elections.

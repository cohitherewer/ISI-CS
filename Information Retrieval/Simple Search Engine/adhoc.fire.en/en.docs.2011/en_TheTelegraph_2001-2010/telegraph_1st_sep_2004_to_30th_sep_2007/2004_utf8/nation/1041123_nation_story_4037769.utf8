 Protest on Zahira U-turn

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Nov. 22: The Muslim community here has registered a strong protest against the turnaround by Zahira Sheikh and her family in the Best Bakery case.

 ?When the case was shifted by the Supreme Court for a retrial, there was an assurance that justice will be done. But with Zahira taking a U-turn, that hope is shattered for us, or for any citizen of India who believes in justice,? said Maulana Khalilur Rahman Noorie, general secretary of Tanzeem Aime Masajid, an Islamic organisation.

 Yesterday, his organisation, with several other Muslim organisations, participated in a public protest organised by the All India Muslim Minority Sangathan.

 In another development, Zahira?s elder brother, Nafitullah, who turned hostile in court like his younger brother Nasibullah, was cross-examined for the second day at the special court in Mumbai holding the retrial.

 Nafitullah denied most of the statements attributed to him in the police records and said he did not remember anything about the incident because he became unconscious after being hit on the head.

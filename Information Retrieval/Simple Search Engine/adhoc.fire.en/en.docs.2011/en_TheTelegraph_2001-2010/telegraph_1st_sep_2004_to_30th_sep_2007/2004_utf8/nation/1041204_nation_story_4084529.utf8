 Kanchi chase

 M.R. VENKATESH 

 Kancheepuram, Dec. 3: On a day of high drama and confusion, police appeared to have come close to arresting two accused in the Kanchi murder ? Appu, the alleged kingpin of the gang that killed temple manager Shankar Raman, and Ravi Subramanian, a builder and associate of Jayendra Saraswati who is believed to have acted as the link with the killers.

 At 8.45 pm, the court of the first judicial magistrate here was still open on the expectation that Appu could be produced any time for remand, sources said.

 Subramanian, believed to have been in Delhi and then slipped to Hardwar, is proving a harder nut to crack.

 But one source said both have been ?secured? by the police even if their ?formal arrest is delayed?.

 Appu is alleged to have spoken to the Kanchi seer before and after the murder on September 3. Subramanian, the Chennai-based builder and real estate developer, was suspected to be the one who first got in touch with the contract killers and arranged for disbursal of the money to them. 

 Jayendra Saraswati, who was arrested on November 11, is the first accused in the murder.

 Seven members of the special investigating team probing the murder reached Delhi early this morning by the state government?s special aircraft, Cessna, to arrest Subramanian, popularly known as RS. But there is no definitive word about his whereabouts.

 The police were tightlipped amid conflicting reports reaching the court of the judicial magistrate, Uthamaraj, whose office staff have been asked to stay till late in the night in case either of the two key accused has to be remanded in the the most sensational case in Tamil Nadu since Rajiv Gandhi?s assassination.

 Initially, the large media contingent waiting here since afternoon was given to understand that Appu had been arrested near Puthur in nearby Andhra Pradesh and was being brought by road to Kancheepuram to be remanded in police or judicial custody. But later, an intelligence source said Appu had been taken to Hyderabad on the way to Delhi for further questioning.

 The Kanchi Mutt?s manager, Sundaresa Iyer, was today questioned for the fifth time. The interrogation went on almost all day. He signs the mutt?s cheques. His role is being probed along with that of the mutt accountant, Viswanathan, and Jan Kalyan movement activist Pashupathy.

 Even as the state unit of the Indian People?s Front and some other pro-Left organisations have stepped up demands for Jayendra Saraswati?s ouster as acharya through hard-hitting posters in the town, the main Opposition parties are attacking the BJP and other Sangh parivar outfits for politicising the issue.

 The DMK-led Democratic Progressive Alliance, which includes the Congress, the PMK, the MDMK and the two main Left parties, met under the chairmanship of M. Karunanidhi in Chennai earlier today to formulate its response for the first time since the November 11 arrest of the seer.

 The alliance, in a cautious resolution, condemned the BJP and the VHP for seeking to needlessly whip up a ?communal propaganda? that could cause conflict particularly at a time when Madras High Court had reserved its order on the acharya?s second bail plea. The arrest upheld the principle that the law was applicable equally to everyone, it said.

 The Sangh outfits? attempt to ?politicise? the arrest by dragging in Congress president Sonia Gandhi?s name into the controversy was ?highly mischievous and condemnable,? the resolution added. To highlight this and other issues against the Jayalalithaa government, the Opposition alliance has decided to organise state-wide protests in Tamil Nadu on December 10.

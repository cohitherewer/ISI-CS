 Sangh?s swadeshi soldier dead

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 14: Dattopant Thengadi, the Sangh parivar?s ?swadeshi? ideologue and an Atal Bihari Vajpayee-baiter, died this afternoon at Pune.

 Thengadi, 84, recently underwent a minor surgery and was recuperating when he fell in the toilet. He died at 4.30 pm at a Pune hospital

 An excellent organiser, Thengadi was a RSS pracharak for over half a century and founded several RSS outfits, notably its labour wing, the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, its students front Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarti Parishad and the Swadeshi Jagran Manch.

 But he attracted most attention during the six years the National Democratic Alliance was in power, using every opportunity to slam Vajpayee and the ?pro-reforms? ministers in his cabinet. He went to the extent of dubbing then finance minister Yashwant Sinha a ?criminal? and termed his polices ?anti-people and anti-national? during a controversy over the privatisation of the public-sector Balco and Modern Foods.

 This was not the only time an ?anti-national? slur was cast on the ?nationalistic? BJP by one of its own. When the Vajpayee regime cleared the Sankhya Vahini (data carrier) project in collaboration with the Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Thengadi joined the Left in protest and accused the government of ?selling? India?s ?sovereignty?.

 But Thengadi did not merely issue statements, taking to the streets when required. In April 2000, he set off on a swadeshi yatra to ?educate? people about the ?dangers? of liberalisation and a World Trade Organisation regime.

 The veteran did not stop at this and instead warned there were leaders around who were ready to compromise the country?s interests. Coming as this did days after Vajpayee said nobody would dream of selling the country away to a foreigner, the parivar was abuzz with speculation that Thengadi was fingering the then Prime Minister.

 In 1998, he sat on a dharna outside Parliament with fellow swadeshi S. Gurumurthy to protest the tabling of the Insurance Regulatory Authority Bill. Two years later, he was up in arms over the ?white? countries? refusal to cut agricultural subsidies for their farmers.

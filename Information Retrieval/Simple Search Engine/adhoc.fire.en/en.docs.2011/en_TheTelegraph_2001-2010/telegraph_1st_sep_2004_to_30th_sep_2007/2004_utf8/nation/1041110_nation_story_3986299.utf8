 Sehwag kin in bill bother 

 AYSWARIA VENUGOPAL

 Sehwag

 New Delhi, Nov. 9: A little rain on wedding day might be a good omen for some brides. But the deluge that drenched the capital the day Virender Sehwag tied the knot has certainly not proved lucky for his bride?s father.

 Or for the decorator.

 The lack of a waterproof tent and a DJ has sparked a row between them.

 After the wedding on April 22 ? by Delhi?s standards a perfect day for nuptials ? the cricketer?s father-in-law Swaraj Singh Ahlawat was handed a bill of Rs 3.47 lakh. Six months and an unpaid bill later, Virender Saini, the owner of Flower Art Shop, has sent a legal notice to Ahlawat for recovery of the amount. He has also filed a police complaint alleging intimidation by Ahlawat.

 The Ahlawats say Saini had initially offered to do the decoration for free as he was a Sehwag fan, but they paid him Rs 60,000. They had also asked for a waterproof tent and a DJ. The Ahlawats allege Saini is trying to extort money.

 Saini says the family ?never said anything? about a waterproof tent. ?It was their bad luck there was a hailstorm,? the decorator says. ?We were not expecting it to rain that day.?

 In his notice, Saini said he incurred expenses of Rs 1.5 lakh on tent decoration, Rs 1 lakh on flowers, Rs 12,000 on DJ and music system and Rs 30,000 on waiter services.

 Saini says he filed the complaint after Ahlawat waylaid him on November 4. ?In the middle of the road, Ahlawat told me he would break my legs if I went to court. If I was trying to extort money, I would have demanded Rs 10 lakh.?

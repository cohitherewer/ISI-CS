 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Dec 23: The World Bank will provide the cash-strapped Orissa government around Rs 650 crore this financial year.

 During his visit to Orissa, country director Michael Carter said the World Bank is willing to provide financial support to the government to help it restructure the budget. 

 The funds will be released through the Centre, he added. ?It is an untied support to the government of Orissa,? he said during his visit to Ganjam on Tuesday. 

 Carter said the World Bank is keen to provide more funds to the state in the next four years. He added that the financial assistance might be higher than the current Rs 650 crore in the coming years. 

 The sectors in which the World Bank is interested in Orissa are education, health and removal of poverty alleviation programmes.

 Muted protest

 New Delhi, Sept. 7: The Congress and the BJP are not in favour of taking precipitate action against the Uttar Pradesh government, reports our special correspondent.

 This is not because they are keen to see Mulayam Singh Yadav secure himself as chief minister but, as a BJP source said, because of the perception that on the ground a drastic move like enforcing central rule will strengthen him and weaken us.

 The lack of response even in Lucknow to yesterdays bandh called by the Congress to protest the police firing on agitating lawyers put paid to further protests, sources admitted. Mainstream parties had initially hoped the police action against lawyers would snowball into an imbroglio matching the mayhem unleashed at Muzaffarnagar in 1994 on those demanding a separate Uttarakhand state. They thought such a controversy would be the beginning of Mulayams end.

 But this did not happen because the Uttarakhand movement owed its origin to grassroots protests dating back several decades and it acquired an emotive hue when Lucknow enforced 28 per cent reservation for backward castes in the hill regions as well. The lawyers agitation had no such largescale resonance.

 Another reason for the lack of public support is, as BJP sources said: Any movement spearheaded by lawyers will not gain popular support because large sections are wary of them.

 Lawyers apart, the BJP and Congress camps feel that Uttar Pradesh politics is dominated by the two casteist poles represented by the Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party and they have no option but to ride piggyback.

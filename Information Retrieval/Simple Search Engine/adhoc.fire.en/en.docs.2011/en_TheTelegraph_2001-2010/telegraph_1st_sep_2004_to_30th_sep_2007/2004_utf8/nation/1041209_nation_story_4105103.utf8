 Islamabad, Dec. 8 (Agencies): Pakistan today test-fired a nuclear-capable, surface-to-surface ballistic missile capable of hitting targets deep inside India.

 The military said Pakistan had informed neighbouring countries about the test.

 ?Pakistan today carried out a successful test-fire of its indigenously developed, medium-range surface-to-surface ballistic missile, Hatf-IV Shaheen-I,? it said in a statement.

 ?The missile is capable of reaching targets up to 700 km and can carry nuclear and other types of warheads,? it said.

 Today?s testfiring does not contradict its policy of rapprochement with India, Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf said.

 ?We know they are a nuclear power and they know we are. We inform each other when there are missile tests. There is no violation of our confidence-building measures,? Musharraf said at a media briefing.

 ?Pakistan?s policy is based on minimum defensive deterrence. When they (India) went nuclear, we went nuclear. When they started producing missiles, we did. We believe in maintaining our dignity and national sovereignty,? he said.

 Relations between the two have improved in recent months due to what Musharraf described as a ?twin-track approach of confidence-building measures and dialogue?.

 On November 29, Pakistan test-fired a short-range, nuclear capable Hatf-III Ghaznavi with a range of 290 km. A day later, India test-fired its short range, surface-to-surface Akash, which can hit targets up to 25 km.

 Pakistani and Indian officials say their missile tests are neither a response to tests by their rivals nor aimed at provoking a reaction.

 Shells in Siliguri

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Siliguri, Oct. 11: Six mortar shells were recovered from a riverbed on the outskirts of this town today, a senior police official said.

 A police team, acting on a tip-off from stone-crushers who frequent the Balason river-bed, found five used mortar shells and an unused one. The area, near Khaprail More in Matigara, was cordoned off following the find.

 Two explosives experts from the army, who visited the site after the local police sought their assistance, said the shells were manufactured in 1967 but could not confirm where. 

 They said the unused shell had outlived its utility and did not pose any danger.

 Darjeeling superintendent of police Rajeev Mishra said: ?We are trying to find out how the mortar shells found their way under the bridge and whether they were abandoned by a scrap dealer who may have bought something auctioned by the army.?

 ?We are investigating the case along with the army. We hope to make a breakthrough soon and find out who all are involved in the case,? said a senior police officer.

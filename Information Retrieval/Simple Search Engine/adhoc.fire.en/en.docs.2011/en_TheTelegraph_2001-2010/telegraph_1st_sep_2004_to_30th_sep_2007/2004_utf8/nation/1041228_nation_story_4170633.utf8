 Court blow to Bihar degree shops

 FARHANA KALAM

Patna/Gaya, Dec. 27: Institutions without proper 

affiliation or recognition are in for trouble.

 Dealing a blow to the ?degree shops? of Bihar, Patna High Court recently passed an unfavourable judgment on the plea of some students of one such institution to be allowed to appear in the intermediate examination on the grounds of ?sympathy? and ?career?.

 Justice Narayan Roy turned down the prayer of Vikram Kumar and others to be registered with the Bihar Intermediate Education Council as students of Nalanda Shodh Sansthan evam Mahavidyalaya, Biharsharif.

 According to sources in the council, the annual turnover of these degree shops is more than Rs 20 crore and business worth about 5 crore is transacted in Gaya alone. Gaya and Darbhanga are the two most important centres of the degree racket. 

 In a bid to rein in the ?degree mafia?, council chairman Nageshwar Sharma recently cracked the derecognition whip on more than 100 institutions ? which did not have the infrastructure and facilities required ? and put quite a few under the scanner. The axe is also likely to fall on officials who are involved in the racket.

 Delivering his judgment, Justice Roy said students of such institutions could not be allowed to appear in the examination on the grounds of sympathy and compassion. 

 Kumar and a few other students filed the writ, challenging the decision of the council to refuse registration to students of Nalanda Shodh Sansthan evam Mahavidalya. Earlier, the institution was derecognised by the council.

 Before turning down the request, the council had sought admission registers, cashbooks, lists of teachers,details of emoluments and other documents. However, the council did not get the documents.

 Quoting from the Supreme Court order in CBSE vs P. Sunil Kumar and others, Justice Roy said the maintenance of educational standards and fulfilment of duly prescribed norms was a must for the furtherance of higher education.

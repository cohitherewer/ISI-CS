 CBI crack at politicians

 ALOKE TIKKU

 New Delhi, Sept. 29: On a day the CBI cracked down on 190 people, including 63 officials, the premier investigative agency?s director admitted in public political interference.

 ?(But) It is not easy to manipulate (probes),? U.S. Misra said, as cases are monitored by the Supreme Court or high courts.

 Misra spoke of representations he receives from people every day complaining of harassment or some other perceived injustice and then proceeded to defend politicians. ?I receive 10 requests in my office every day,? he said. ?Why can?t he (a politician) approach??

 The comments came at a news conference to announce the CBI special drive that involved raids at 147 places. Sixty-three officials and 127 private persons were raided and 65 cases registered by the bureau today. The anti-corruption drive netted cash and valuables worth Rs 9 crore.

 In an unintended outburst, Misra wondered why the CBI was held responsible for the faults of the criminal justice system that have on occasions led to an accused being let off and not other wings like the judiciary. He referred to the Babri Masjid demolition in December 1992 to make his point.

 ?Do you know when the CBI submitted the chargesheet...? October 1993,? Misra said. Once the chargesheet was filed, the bureau?s role was technically over. But if the case is dragged to the high courts and the Supreme Court, 15 petitions filed at various stages, why should the CBI be blamed? he asked.

 The CBI chief also spoke of the difficulties created by the Single Directive in the Central Vigilance Commission Act that makes it mandatory for the bureau to seek government permission before investigating a central government official of the rank of joint secretary and above.

 Misra emphasised there was not much the bureau could do about this provision. ?It is the law of the land and we have to go by it,? he said. But he made the point that seeking permission from the government not only delayed action against corrupt officials but could also compromise the secrecy of the bureau?s operations.

 Since January, the CBI has registered 23 cases against 32 officials of the rank of joint secretary and above after getting permission.

 CBI officers later said Misra was not off the mark as this safeguard did create hurdles with the accompanying risk that information could get leaked. ?In anti-corruption operations, secrecy is of utmost importance,? an official said.

 It was because the bureau could keep plans secret that it could hold back raids and conduct them on a single day, an official said, referring to today?s countrywide crackdown.

 Among those against whom cases were registered are retired Brigadier Satish Kumar and former project director of the National Highway Authority of India S.K. Soni. The case relates to alleged bungling in the execution of a highway project in Bihar. A case was also registered against stamp scam kingpin Abdul Karim Telgi.

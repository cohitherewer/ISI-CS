 India link in SA bribe scandal

 Durban (PTI): A forensic investigation 

 into corruption has found that South Africa?s Deputy President, 

 Jacob Zuma, received millions of rands in bribes from his 

 Indian-origin businessman friend Schabir Shaik, a newspaper 

 report claimed here on Sunday.

 The probe, carried out by the international auditing company, KPMG, will be presented as evidence at Shaik?s corruption trial in Durban in a week?s time, the report said. Zuma?s name appears on almost every page of the 45-page chargesheet against Shaik.

 The Shaik family has been a long-time supporter of the ANC. During the underground struggle against white minority rule, Shaik and his brothers took an active role in providing support to leaders such as Zuma.

 Shaik has denied that he was involved in corruption, saying he had merely helped out a ?struggle friend?. Zuma has also rejected the allegations against him, repeatedly saying that the national director of public prosecution should charge him in a court of law if had any evidence against him.

 He had repeatedly claimed that there was a plot to discredit him so that he was denied the opportunity of replacing President Thabo Mbeki when he steps down in 2009.

 Scavenging on court campus

 New Delhi (PTI): An Andhra Pradesh court 

 complex employs a part-time manual scavenger to clean two 

 dry latrines, despite Parliament enacting a law banning 

 the degrading practice more than a decade ago.

 The Supreme Court has taken a serious note of the prevalence of this practice in certain states and sought an explanation from their principal secretaries. When volunteers of the Safai Karmachari Andolan, which has filed a public interest litigation before the Supreme Court, gathered before the court complex at Yellareddy in Nizamabad district to demolish the latrines, they were prevented from doing so. The Nizamabad district judge has issued a showcause notice to the scavenger asking why action should not be taken against him for joining the Safai Karmachari Andolan volunteers in demolishing the latrines.

 The SKA has mentioned these developments in an application filed before the Supreme Court. ?As per the survey conducted by the state government, it was found that in Nizamabad district there were a total of 327 manual scavengers and 19 community dry latrines,? it said.

 Vaishnodevi pilgrim raped

 Jammu (PTI): An 18-year-old pilgrim visiting 

 the Vaishnodevi shrine was allegedly raped in a hotel in 

 Katra in Jammu and Kashmir.

 Contractor loot

 Madurai (PTI): A building contractor 

 was robbed of Rs 40,000 and a gold chain by a gang at Tirunelveli, 

 150 km from here on Saturday night, police said. The unidentified 

 assailants robbed the contractor when he was on his way 

 to pay his workers.

 Pension boost

 New Delhi (PTI): Twenty-nine years after 

 a lieutenant commander retired from the Indian Navy, Delhi 

 High Court has ordered the government to clear his pension. 

 Kailash Prasad Ray joined the Indian Navy on March 23, 1953, 

 and retired on May 15, 1975. However, his pension was not 

 finalised as the government and the navy refused to count 

 his apprentice service and the service rendered as a boy 

 for computing his pension.

 Cyclone weakens

 Ahmedabad (PTI): The cyclone in the Arabian 

 Sea off the coast of Naliya in Kutch district of Gujarat 

 has weakened into a depression, the meteorological department 

 said here on Sunday. However, Kutch and Saurashtra districts 

 are expected to get heavy rains at isolated places.

 Head severed

 Madurai (PTI): A severed head, found 

 in a street at Kamuthi in Ramanathapuram district on Sunday, 

 caused a flutter. Police, who identified the head as that 

 of one Karnan, located the body at Muthukulathur several 

 kilometres from Kamuthi. Karnan was accused of murdering 

 one Chinnasamy. The head was found at the same spot where 

 Chinnasamy?s head was found a few years ago, police said.

 A recent study carried out by a voluntary organisation has shown that more than half the hotels and tea shops in Chennai employ children under the age of 14.

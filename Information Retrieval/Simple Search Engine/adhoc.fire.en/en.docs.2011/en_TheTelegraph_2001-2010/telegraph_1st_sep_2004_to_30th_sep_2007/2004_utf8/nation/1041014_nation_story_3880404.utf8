 Unsure of role, Uma plays pilgrim

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Bhopal, Oct. 13: Former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Uma Bharti today left for the Himalayas alone and unsure after failing to secure a ?concrete? offer over her future political role in the BJP.

 Uma met former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, leader of the Opposition .K. Advani and party chief M. Venkaiah Naidu before leaving for 45 days of solitude at Madhmeshwar, Badrinath, Kedarnath and other religious places in Uttaranchal.

 Sources close to Uma admitted that the former chief minister had failed to extract a firm commitment over her future role.

 The fiery sadhvi feels the BJP leadership should have considered her supporters? ?expectations? that range from her being made chief minister again to being anointed national chief of the BJP. There are no takers for this ?wish list? but Uma camp followers say equations may change after the Maharashtra election results come in.

 Die-hard Uma supporters do not relish a Shiv Sena-BJP victory in Maharashtra for a loss there would diminish rival Pramod Mahajan?s clout and also make Naidu vulnerable. 

 Another electoral setback for the BJP so soon after the May Lok Sabha polls could win support for Hindutva hardliners? ?back to basics? approach and win Uma favour with the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and the Bajrang Dal.

 For the record, before leaving for Uttaranchal, Uma told her aides: ?As a sadhvi, I have certain religious obligations and I am glad to have found time to pursue things that are close to my heart.?

 But those who know her well said politics is also close to the sadhvi?s heart. 

 Uma quit as chief minister in August after a non-bailable warrant was issued against her in Hubli, Karnataka, for leading a violent political rally 10 years ago.

 The BJP leader then began a ?tiranga yatra? from Hubli to Amritsar which attracted publicity largely for the ?wrong reasons?, leading her to announcing ?political sanyas? at Mathura. This was followed by an equally dramatic retraction in a few hours for Uma declared that she would soldier on.

 BJP circle regard Uma?s ?disillusionment? as a sign of her power struggle with Naidu, Mahajan and Sushma Swaraj, with each engaging in one-upmanship.

 The former chief minister?s legacy in her native Madhya Pradesh, where she ended Digvijay Singh?s 10-year Congress rule with a crushing defeat in December last year, is eroding fast. At first many state ministers and BJP MLAs professed loyalty to her, with some even crossing the ?laxman rekha? of party discipline by asking the central leadership to ?restore? the chief minister?s post to her.

 But Uma baiters here are openly calling the shots now, even questioning her move to gauge how the state government is faring. A prominent BJP organisational secretary mocked Uma?s statement that she would tour the state in December to ?review? successor Babulal Gaur?s performance. The BJP office-bearer, who acts as an ?interface? between the party and government, said ministers would not be accompanying her on her review. ?That would be extra-constitutional,? he said.

 Uma has been regularly saying she is not hankering for power and is ?happy? to function as an ?ordinary party worker?. But her supporters here are dismayed at how she has been ?sidelined?. Many leaders who are close to Uma and head state commissions and corporations fear that Gaur will remove them.

 The new chief minister has been non-committal about a purge. ?I will review their performance and see how they are functioning,? Gaur said before leaving for Sharjah to take part in the Ramadan Festival in the United Arab Emirates.

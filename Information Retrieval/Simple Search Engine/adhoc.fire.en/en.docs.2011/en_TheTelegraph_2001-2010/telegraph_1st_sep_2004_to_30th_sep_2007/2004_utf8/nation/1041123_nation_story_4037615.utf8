 BJP skips Somnath feast for fast

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov 22: BJP leaders tonight gave Somnath Chatterjee?s dinner a miss to fast for Jayendra Saraswati.

 The Lok Sabha Speaker had invited almost all top party leaders, including Atal Bihari Vajpayee , L.K. Advani, Jaswant Singh and Sushma Swaraj, to discuss modalities for conducting a hassle-free winter session in Parliament. 

 Since Saturday, BJP leaders have been taking turns to observe daylong fasts to protest the Kanchi seer?s arrest. Today was the last day of the agitation.

 Vijay Kumar Malhotra, the BJP?s deputy leader in the Lok Sabha, said: ?I conveyed to him (Chatterjee) our regret at not being able to attend the dinner. All of us are observing a 24-hour upvas.?

 However, an all-party meeting to work out the modalities for the House will be held tomorrow.

 Today?s cancellation of the dinner meeting has triggered speculation that the BJP might stay away from Parliament over the Kanchi seer?s arrest. 

 The party had earlier assured the Speaker that there would be no disruption during the winter session. But they would ? Malhotra today stressed ? raise issues in an ?aggressive, assertive and offensive manner.?

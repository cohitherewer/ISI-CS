 Scam sparks cry for Chautala axe

 Chandigarh: All India Youth Congress chief Randeep Singh Surjewala has demanded the removal of Haryana chief minister Om Prakash Chautala for his alleged involvement in a Rs 125-crore Gurgaon land scam, one of three such scandals concerning Delhi?s neighbouring town, reports our correspondent.

 Only last week, the Haryana government had to cancel the auction of prime land worth nearly Rs 150 crore in Gurgaon and nearby areas after it was sold for much less than the market price.

 State Congress MLA Karan Singh Dalal also added his voice to the scam saga, alleging Chautala?s involvement in a separate multi-crore land scandal.

 On Tuesday, Surjewala, who is also an AICC secretary, released official documents on the Rs 125-crore deal and a memorandum addressed to governor A.R. Kidwai alleging Chautala?s direct involvement. 

 He said the state government had handed over 19.5 acres of prime land at a throwaway price of Rs 4 crore to a real estate developer to set up an IT park.

 ?The documents are self-explanatory. In each and every move on the land deal the hand of the chief minister is visible. Land that is worth Rs 150 crore is being handed for a pittance overriding the objections of government departments,? Surjewala said. 

 He said Haryana principal secretary B.D. Dhalia was also involved. 

 Kovalam palace takeover

 Kochi (PTI): Kerala High Court on Tuesday 

 declined to stay the government takeover of the royal Halcyon 

 Palace at a Kovalam beach resort near Thiruvananthapuram, 

 but held that the takeover would be subject to the result 

 of a petition pending in the court. 

 The court also issued a notice to the Indian Tourism Development Corporation (ITDC) through a special messenger.

 Justice K. Balakrishnan Nair issued the order when a petition by Gulfar Group challenging the takeover, came up on Tuesday. The petitioner had sought a declaration that the government had no right to the property, which the Union government and the ITDC had sold to the group. 

 The petitioner also sought quashing of the September 25 government order, as it was passed without hearing them and without considering the relevant documents.

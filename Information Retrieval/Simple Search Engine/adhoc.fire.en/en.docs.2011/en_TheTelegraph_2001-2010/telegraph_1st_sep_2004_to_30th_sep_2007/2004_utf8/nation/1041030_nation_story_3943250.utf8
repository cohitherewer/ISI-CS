 CPM faces policy tightrope

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 29: The CPM will be forced to walk the tightrope when it drafts the political resolution to be adopted at next April?s party congress.

 The party will have to explain to the cadre its topsy-turvy relationship with the Congress. It will have to say why it needs to keep the United Progressive Alliance government in power though it disagrees with the Congress on many policy issues.

 The Left, which has an all-time high of 63 MPs, can topple the government if it chooses. But, as a senior CPM leader said, ?We have made our stand clear that on no account are we going to destabilise the UPA government.?

 The CPM politburo began a meeting here today with a discussion on the political strategy and tactics that will figure in the political resolution. The document, endorsed by the party congress, will guide the CPM?s relations with other parties, especially the Congress.

 CPM leaders say the conflict between the party and the Congress centres around Bengal and Kerala where the outfits are bitter rivals. The other areas of serious disagreement are globalisation and economic policy.

 The draft resolution of the party will have to work out a middle path where the CPM will oppose the central government?s economic policies, take on the Congress in Bengal and Kerala, but still not waver in its support of the ruling coalition at the Centre.

 ?We have our own constituency to address,? a CPM politburo member said. This constituency, which has been nurtured on an anti-liberalisation diet, will not take kindly to the party agreeing to any policy that negates its previous opposition.

 Citu general secretary and politburo member M.K. Pandhe has been most outspoken against the government?s economic policy, especially the Centre?s move to raise the cap on foreign direct investment in telecommunication and insurance.

 The Citu leader even threatened that the CPM might withdraw support if the Congress-led government did not drop the move. However, the high command clarified that Pandhe was not voicing the party?s opinion.

 The new political resolution will have to keep the heat on the Congress considering Assembly elections are due in Bengal and Kerala in 2006.

 Senior CPM leaders admit the political resolution will have to carefully weave its way through these contradictory pressures.

 Pervez push to Hurriyat unity

 Srinagar, Oct. 31 (Reuters): Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf held talks this month with a top separatist leader from Jammu and Kashmir in a bid to unite separatist factions, a newspaper reported on Sunday.

 Mirwaiz Umer Farooq, chief of the moderate faction of the All Parties Hurriyat Conference, told the Greater Kashmir newspaper that it was a ?chance encounter? in Amsterdam, but the two ended up holding a wide-ranging discussion on Kashmir.

 ?The one-to-one meeting continued for over three hours during which issues like the split in Hurriyat... were discussed,? the Mirwaiz was quoted as saying.

 The Hurriyat split last year between moderates and hardliners over the issue of holding talks with New Delhi.

 Its hardliners, headed by Syed Ali Shah Geelani and backed by Pakistan and militants, are opposed to direct talks with the Centre without including Pakistan.

 The moderates held talks with Delhi this year, for the first time since 1989, but there has been no progress.

 Citing unnamed sources, the paper said the factions could reunite when their leaders travel to Delhi this week for a meeting at the Pakistan embassy. The Mirwaiz was not available for comment.

 The disclosure comes days after Musharraf proposed that Kashmir be demilitarised and India and Pakistan agree to a compromise over its status. 

 India said it expected such proposals to be discussed during peace talks, rather than through the media.

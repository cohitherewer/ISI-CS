 Jaya sends milestone missive to PM

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, Dec. 22: Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayalalithaa has urged Manmohan Singh to ?immediately stop the practice? of inscribing details on milestones on state national highways in Hindi.

 ?I request you to kindly take up the matter with the ministry of shipping, road transport and highways (headed by DMK?s T.R. Baalu) and instruct the ministry to revert to the practice of depicting the details in Tamil and English only,? she wrote to the Prime Minister yesterday.

 In a separate statement, Jayalalithaa hit out at the DMK for ignoring what she alleged was a recent central practice. She questioned if the DMK, which often claimed to be a guardian of the Tamil language, had begun to ?hang on to the coat tails of Hindi for political gains?.

 In her letter to Singh, Jayalalithaa said: ?We have noticed the problem of the inscription of place names on the kilometre stones on roads that have been taken up by the National Highways Authority of India; they are now being inscribed in Hindi which is contrary to the time-tested practice prevailing in Tamil Nadu so far.?

 Only the two-language policy of using Tamil and English had been followed for decades, she said.

 Claiming that the new practice was based on norms developed by the Indian Road Congress, Jayalalithaa said such a code had never been followed in Tamil Nadu, where ?language has always been an emotive issue.? The recent move by the NHAI was ill advised and it caused ?great concern and anguish in the public mind?, she said.

 Tamil status

 The task of implementing the government?s decision to accord classical language status to Tamil should be entrusted to the human resource development ministry, ADMK member P.G. Narayanan said.

 Raising the issue during zero hour in the Rajya Sabha, he said Tamil scholars were not very comfortable with the decision to entrust the work to the department of culture.

 They felt the department could not do justice to decisions like funding the research of the language, he said.

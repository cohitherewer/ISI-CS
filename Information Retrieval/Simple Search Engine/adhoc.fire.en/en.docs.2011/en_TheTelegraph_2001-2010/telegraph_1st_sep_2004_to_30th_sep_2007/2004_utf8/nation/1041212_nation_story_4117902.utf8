 Hurriyat passport poser

 ALOKE TIKKU

 New Delhi, Dec. 11: The All Parties Hurriyat Conference is testing the Centre?s remark that it has no problem issuing passports to Kashmiri separatists who formally apply for the travel documents.

 When Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and home minister Shivraj Patil visited Jammu and Kashmir last month, they had said Delhi was unlikely to object to passport requests by Hurriyat leaders.

 Senior home ministry officials here say the government recently received passport requests from three moderate leaders, including Maulana Abbas Ansari and Abdul Ghani Bhat. They would not say if the request will be met.

 ?The decision will need to be taken at the highest level,? a home ministry official said. ?But we must acknowledge what the passports are for and see the application in that light: to go to Pakistan.? The officials said in principle the government should not have a problem issuing the passports.

 There was a tacit understanding between the Centre and the Hurriyat during the two rounds of talks with the then deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani, that the leaders would visit Pakistan after the third round that was never held.

 The Centre now believes that the strategy of refusing the separatists passports was drafted when the thinking was that if the separatists were allowed to go abroad they would talk about India?s ?occupation? of Kashmir and project Delhi in a poor light.

 That the Centre no longer thinks so was apparent earlier this year when acting Hurriyat chief Mirwaiz Umer Farooq was issued a passport with a one-year validity.

 However, the matter now is one of timing. Delhi believes the moderate Hurriyat has not come out clean during recent months ? it refused to meet Indian leaders, including Patil, but instead met Pakistan?s Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz, its foreign minister and foreign secretary at the high commission here.

 The government is also annoyed at the Hurriyat attempt to make permission for the Pakistan visit a condition for meeting Indian leaders by indicating it was ready to come to North Block for a meeting if this put them to the road to Pakistan.

 It is none too happy either that Farooq used his passport, not to visit Pakistan, but to secretly meet ISI officials in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf in Amsterdam.

 Hurriyat leaders have been insisting it is necessary to meet leaders in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir before they finalise on a strategy for talks with Delhi. But government officials counter that the visit is only to gauge the mood on the other side, which can even be done at a meeting being organised by a US think-tank in Kathmandu.

 The team of moderates, led by Farooq and Bhat ? hawk Syed Ali Shah Geelani is not attending ? must have realised that they can do without a passport. Officials said the separatists, even Farooq who has a passport, travelled on party identity cards rather than government identification documents.

 The conference is being held with a view to improving India-Pakistan communication under Track II diplomacy and developing people-to-people contacts. The meet will be attended by around 45 people from both countries.

 Victory boost for Modi

 BASANT RAWAT

 Ahmedabad, Oct. 16: Narendra Modi has emerged a winner from Wednesday?s Assembly byelections in Gujarat, wresting two seats from the Congress largely on the strength of the pre-poll campaign he and his handpicked ministers carried out.

 The BJP?s strength in the 182-member Assembly has risen to 130 with the twin victories, while the strength of the Congress, which retained the three other seats for which by-polls were held, has dipped to 43.

 Chief minister Modi, whose popularity had suffered after the reverses in May?s Lok Sabha polls, must be most pleased with wresting Khedbrahma in north Gujarat by defeating the Congress? Vaishali Chaudhary who was contesting the seat after the death of former chief minister Amarsinh Chaudhary. The BJP?s other win came in Bhanwad, Jamnagar.

 Modi, who has survived a determined ouster bid by dissidents, had held at least two elections meetings in each constituency which he placed under the charge of his favourite ministers.

 Modi had taken on the Opposition Congress single-handledly in the byelections to five assembly seats, all held by the Congress, wresting two seats ? Bhanwad in Jamnagar and Khedbrahma in north Gujarat which is seen as a credible performance even by his political rivals.

 Aware of serious political implications of the elections, Modi and his handpicked ministers campaigned hard. The chief minister himself held at least two elections meetings in each constituency.

 If the Congress had retained all the five seats, Modi would have been exposed to fresh attacks from dissidents.

 An air of anticipation was created about the results of the by-elections as there has been so much at stake for the chief minister who has survived a determined attempt by dissidents who wanted to oust him.

 If the Congress had retained all five seats, Modi would have been exposed him to fresh attacks from dissidents with the blessings of his arch- rivals in Gandhinagar and Delhi.

 But the dissidents who were lying low, hoping that the chief minister would get much needed shock, were indeed shocked themselves Modi managed to capture two crucial seats, which has strengthened his position.

 The most notable victory for the BJP, though by a slender margin, is the Khedbrahma seat which fell vacant following the death of Congress legislature party leader and former chief minister Amarsinh Chaudhary.

 Bhanwad is another seat that the BJP won by an impressive margin, 25000, highest among all five winners.

 The Congress managed to retain Borsad in central Gujarat, Vyara and Dharmapur seats in South Gujarat, the later two are tribal constituencies.

 Senior Congress leaders J V Momin and Hasmukh Patel agree that the sole winner in these by-elections is the chief minister himself who, many thought, was vulnerable but he had defied all predictions. The by-elections has actually boosted Modi?s image.

 Blaming the ruling BJP for the misuse of the government machinery, GPCC president B.K. Gadhvi says does not agree that the party has suffered a major setback. Not all the Congressmen share his views.

 Some party leaders blame Gadhvi for the party?s defeat in Khedbrahma and Bhanwad. The local people, they say, were unhappy with the candidates. So the local Congressmen, who were opposed to party president?s wrong choice of candidate, remained inactive as they felt that they were being sidelined.

 State BJP president Rajednra Sinh Rana said the BJP had really performed well in the by-elections compared to Lok Sabha polls. ?Our vote share has increased in the five Assembly segments by 50,000,?? he claimed.

 Now that Modi is here stay, the party is expected to announce the name of new state president. It has been almost two years since Rana?s term expired. The party could not announce new state chief as it has been a prestige issue between Modi and dissidents who wanted their own nominee to hold the coveted post.

 But Modi was adamant. He had even threatened to quit if his candidate was not made new party chief. The chief minister wants one of his loyalists ? Purshottam Rupala or Kaushik Patel to be appointed president. But it is not acceptable to former chief minister Keshubhai Patel who wants his prot?g? BallabKathiria to replace Rana.

 Party insiders feel that now it is unlikely that Kathiria will be made party chief.

 It is Modi who will handpick new party president.

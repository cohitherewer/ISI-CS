 Kidnapped engineer jumps out of vehicle, rescued

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Nov. 26: One of 

 the two abducted National Hydroelectric Project Corporation 

 (NHPC) engineers, K.K. Singh, was rescued this evening from 

 Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh.

 ?Singh was rescued from Siktor village under Korava police station in Gorakhpur after police confronted the abductors and raided a hideout. Understandably, the police operation is still on and we hope that the other engineer will be rescued soon,? Bihar director-general of police Narayan Mishra said in Patna.

 Unconfirmed reports said Gorakhpur police, acting on a tip-off, reached the village and spotted the two engineers in a vehicle. Two armed men were keeping an eye on the NHPC engineers. On seeing the police, Singh jumped out of the vehicle. However, the criminals managed to escape with the other engineer, T. Mandal. 

 According to reports, the police team is still in search of the gang and is trying to rescue Mandal. ?The operation is still on,? DGP Mishra said. 

 The police also arrested Rishi Muni Tiwari, a gangster from Nepal, in connection with the abduction. ?Apparently, the abduction was the work of an inter-state gang, which included Tiwari, who operates from Nepal,? he added.

 In a related development, Delhi police said Rs 19,000 was withdrawn from Mandal?s bank account yesterday. The money was withdrawn from the Connaught Place ATM of ICICI Bank. 

 Since the ATM had a camera in place, the special cell of Delhi police is examining the video records for leads.

 Bihar police has been pursuing the abduction case and has despatched several teams to north Bihar and places near the UP-Nepal border. They also raided the residences of Lok Janshakti Party leaders Munna Shukla and Rajan Tiwari. 

 While the police conducted a series of raids, the Rashtriya Janata Dal and the LJP accused each other of patronising criminal gangs and using them for their own purposes.

 The LJP will hold a rally in Patna tomorrow, in which the likes of Rajan Tiwari, Munna Shukla and Suraj Bhan are expected to participate. ?The rescue of the engineer on the eve of the rally from the clutches of a gang that is seen to be known to some of these politicians might be used by the RJD to attack the LJP,? said a political observer here.

 Bihar police also claimed that they were successful in tracing the ransom calls that were allegedly made by the abductors from Singh?s phone. 

 The two officials ? chief engineer Singh and general manager Mandal ? were abducted from Sarai in Vaishali on November 19.

 Kasuri talks peace

 Lahore, Nov. 21 (PTI): Pakistan was back in a conciliatory mood today with foreign minister Khurshid Mehmood Kasuri soft-pedalling President Pervez Musharraf?s tough talk on Kashmir and hoping that glitches in the peace process would be sorted out.

 The foreign minister used the same forum at which the President had yesterday accused India of having a patronising attitude, to affirm Islamabad?s commitment to peace. He said Musharraf was not angry but pained when speaking about bilateral ties.

 ?But the President is committed to peace with India,? Kasuri said in his address to the South Asia Free Media Association conference being held here.

 PMO primacy on Valley 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 21: The 

 Manmohan Singh government appears keen to continue the previous 

 regime?s formula of the Prime Minister?s Office, rather 

 than the home ministry, having the upper hand in framing 

 the Centre?s response to developments in Jammu and Kashmir. 

 This follows the security establishment?s recognition that the United Progressive Alliance government has not been able to firm up its policy on Jammu and Kashmir beyond the rhetorical ?we are ready to talk to everyone? line.

 In contrast, there is acknowledgement that the National Democratic Alliance regime?s handling of Kashmir was a high watermark of the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government which culminated in bringing the Hurriyat Conference to the talks table. 

 A source said Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was keen that his advisers, national security adviser J.. Dixit and special adviser M.K. Narayanan, directly coordinate with the home ministry on the government?s strategy on Jammu and Kashmir. 

 This, he said, would ensure that the Prime Minister was kept posted on all developments and the proposed response of the government at conceptual or implementation stages. 

 There are suggestions that somewhere down the line the Centre?s interlocutor on Jammu and Kashmir, .. Vohra, might find his role in the entire exercise diminishing. 

 Instead, officials said, Narayanan had been asked to chalk out a strategy paper to build a roadmap for the government, look at the existing response mechanism at the Centre ? including Vohra?s role ? and play adviser to home minister Shivraj Patil.

 The new government?s insistence, in its first few months, on talking to the Hurriyat within the four corners of the Constitution indicated the Centre?s inadequate appreciation of the ground realities. 

 Patil has given up this line and instead emphasises that the talks would be ?unconditional?. But his junior minister, Sriprakash Jaiswal, still asserts there is no change in the position vis-a-vis the Constitution. 

 The home minister, however, has suggested that it is unfair to compare the UPA government?s performance with that of the NDA because the present regime is only a few months old.

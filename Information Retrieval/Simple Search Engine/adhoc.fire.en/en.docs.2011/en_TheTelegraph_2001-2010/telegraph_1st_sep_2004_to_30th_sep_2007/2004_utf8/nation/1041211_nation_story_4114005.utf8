 Laloo faces minority spoiler

 KAY BENEDICT

 New Delhi, Dec. 10: Laloo Prasad Yadav, who has formed a Muslim-Yadav vote bank, and Ram Vilas Paswan, who is trying to forge a Dalit-Muslim alliance in Bihar, face a challenge from an unexpected quarter.

 The threat comes from the newly-formed All India Pasmanda Muslim Mahaaj which is planning to emulate the Indian Union Muslim League in Kerala by entering electoral politics in poll-bound Bihar and Jharkhand.

 The Muslim Mahaaj, which sources say is opposed to fundamentalism of all hues, be it the Sangh Parivar variety or the kind practised by radical Muslim organisations, will probably be the first Muslim party to contest an election in the cow belt.

 Mahaaj chief Ali Anwar said regional parties, be it Laloo Prasad?s Rashtriya Janata Dal or Mulayam Singh Yadav?s Samajwadi Party have been using Muslims, especially Dalits and Other Backward Classes who form 80 per cent of the community, as a vote bank, but did nothing to empower them.

 Anwar, who is also a coordinator of the Medha Patkar-led National Alliance of People?s Movement, said then too, it was upper caste and elite Muslims who enjoyed the fruits of power.

 Aware that the Mahaaj could affect their electoral prospects, Laloo Yadav and his bete noire, Janata Dal (United) leader Nitish Kumar, have had talks with Anwar. The Muslim politician said these were just preliminary talks, adding that if the parties did not offer sufficient seats ? he would not say how many ? his party would go it alone.

 Anwar said the Mahaaj was willing to ally with any ?secular, democratic? party and would have no truck with the BJP and Muslim fundamentalist parties. ?We had great expectation from the so-called social justice governments, the RJD in Bihar, the Samajwadi Party in UP (Uttar Pradesh), but they proved even worse. The Congress, the BJP, the SP (Samajwadi Party) and the RJD are promoting only elite Muslims,? he said.

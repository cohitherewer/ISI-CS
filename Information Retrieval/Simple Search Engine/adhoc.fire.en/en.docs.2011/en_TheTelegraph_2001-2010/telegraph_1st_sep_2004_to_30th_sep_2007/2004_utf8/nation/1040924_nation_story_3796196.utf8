 Free hand to rein in rebels

 ALOKE TIKKU

 New Delhi, Sept. 23: The Centre today promised to support initiatives taken by states to enter into talks with Naxalites, but made it clear it would not assume the role of state governments to deal with the problem.

 Union home minister Shivraj Patil said his ministry was ready to give a free hand to states like Andhra Pradesh, which has invited the People?s War Group for talks, on the conditions that should be imposed.

 This includes the contentious issue being debated in Hyderabad on whether the state government should insist that PWG cadre do not carry arms while the talks are on.

 Patil, who chaired a meeting of Naxalite-affected states in Hyderabad on Tuesday, has told the Andhra government not to look to the Centre for a directive but take a decision based on its assessment. The home minister referred to a strategy adopted by the Centre in Nagaland that did not allow NSCN (I-M) cadre to carry arms beyond their camps.

 The home ministry will have no problem either way, Patil said. ?If they drop arms, it is good. But if they carry arms and still want to talk... we don?t have any difficulty. We are not afraid of that also,? he emphasised.

 The minister said the only principle he wanted states to bear in mind was whether their decision would eventually strengthen peace and reduce the dependence of the extremists on violence and arms.

 But the home ministry is clear that it does not want to take on a role that constitutionally belongs to state governments. At the Hyderabad meeting, Patil had stressed that the Centre had no specific role as law and order was a state subject. ?We are telling the state governments we are always available for any advice, monetary support or supply of troops, if needed,? he had said. But the decision to tackle the menace, either through force or negotiation, was the prerogative of states.

 A home ministry official said the Centre?s stand was based on the argument that Naxalites were no longer as ideology-driven as they were when Left-wing extremism was in its formative years. Instead, castes have come into play in some states ? like Bihar ? and tribes in states like Jharkhand, and a variety of other factors, including geographical features of a region.

 A single plan would obviously not work at every place, said the official who outlined a supportive rather than tactical role for the Centre.

 PWG talks

 After months of shadow boxing, the Andhra government and the PWG propose to begin unconditional peace talks on October 2.

 Home minister K. Jana Reddy today sent official invitations to the PWG, the Jana Shakti and another extremist group. In the letter, Reddy indicated that the government had accepted the PWG proposal to make the issue of arms part of the agenda for the talks.

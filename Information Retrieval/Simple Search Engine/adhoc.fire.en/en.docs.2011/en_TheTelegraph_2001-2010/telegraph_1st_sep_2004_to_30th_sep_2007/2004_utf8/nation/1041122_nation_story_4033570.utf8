 New Delhi, Nov. 21: Central government babus planning a vacation abroad this winter onwards may have to explain before they take off how they intend paying for the trip out of their salary. 

 Nudged by Delhi High Court, the government and the Central Vigilance Commission have tightened the noose on government employees quietly flying their families to holidays abroad.

 Last month, the commission and the department of personnel and training got together to keep a closer watch on high-flying bureaucrats and issued instructions to other departments to go by the rules to the last letter on letting officers fly out. The vigilance commission also put its own officers ? each department has a chief vigilance officer ? on the job to keep tabs on employees.

 The chief vigilance officers have been asked to produce a list of employees who went abroad, complete with their designations, countries visited and the source of funds at the end of each year. While on the job, the vigilance officers have also been told to collect information about employees who went on private visits abroad last year.

 A note from the department of personnel and training has asked departmental heads to ensure that government employees take permission before leaving for abroad. It adds that employees seeking permission to go abroad also need to provide information relating to previous visits.

 In essence, an official said, the fresh government directive is not anything new and has always been an integral part of the rulebook. According to this rulebook, government officials cannot move out of the place of their posting without their superiors? nod even during leave.

 But quite like the rule that makes it mandatory for government servants to declare their assets to their department annually, this one, too, was hardly ever followed. Till a Delhi High Court bench got down to hearing a petition by a senior scientist of the Central Forensic Science Laboratory, C.K. Jain, challenging his detention under the Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Act.

 Jain had been caught with foreign exchange worth Rs 65 lakh before he was to board a Dubai-bound flight in March 2003. Raids at his house by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence led to the recovery of another Rs 6.2 lakh.

 Unlike the bureaucracy, which glossed over reports that Jain had made 161 visits to Dubai and Singapore, the high court was in no mood to let go and prodded the government to look at the administrative mechanism available to create a databank of officers? private visits abroad. 

 The court also asked the government to prepare guidelines so that a strict watch could be kept on the ?seemingly unaffordable? lifestyles of government officials.

 Jain clearly was not the only one flouting the rule. A senior government official spoke of a stenographer working in his department several years ago who went on medical leave for 18 months, someone who religiously produced applications to extend his leave backed by medical certificates from a doctor back home in Kerala. It later transpired that he had been working all these months in the Gulf and had earned enough to build a house.

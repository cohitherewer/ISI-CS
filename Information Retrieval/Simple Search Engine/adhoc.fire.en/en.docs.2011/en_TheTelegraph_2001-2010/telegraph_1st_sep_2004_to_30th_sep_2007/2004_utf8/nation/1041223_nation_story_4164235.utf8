 Fog stills air and train movement

 New Delhi (PTI): Dense fog over the capital 

 and its adjoining areas once again disrupted normal life 

 on Wednesday after two comparatively clear days and led 

 to the cancellation and delay of some flights and trains.

 The runway visibility range between 250 and 300 metres at Palam airport forced airlines to suspend operations for several hours.

 Most flights were rescheduled and the first one, an Indian Airlines plane to Bangalore, took off at 6.55 am using the Cat-III instrument for landing, an airport spokesperson said. An Indian Airlines flight to Vadodara followed 10 minutes later.

 Ten domestic and three international flights had to be diverted to other cities. Normal operations resumed only after 9.30 am, he added. Jet Airways and Air Sahara cancelled their flights to Kathmandu, airline sources said.

 Train services were also affected, with a few trains from eastern India being cancelled and over 30 trains running up to 25 hours late.

 The Magadh Express, Saryu Yamuna Express and Janata Express, running from Delhi, were cancelled on Wednesday, a northern railway statement said. 

 Dowry life term for family

 Hissar (PTI): A session court has sentenced 

 four members of a family to life imprisonment for burning 

 a woman to death for dowry on January 24, 2002. 

 Additional district and sessions judge Shiva Sharma on Tuesday held the accused ? Dharambir, the husband, Wazir, a brother-in-law, Santosh and Sarupi, the mother-in-law ? guilty of eliminating Bhagwanti two years ago. Besides life imprisonment, all the accused were ordered to pay a fine of Rs 5,000 each. In case of default in payment, they would further undergo imprisonment for two more months.

 Bhagwanti, who was married to Dharambir, was admitted to hospital on January 20, 2002 with serious burn injuries. She said in her statement that the four, along with her father in-law Dariya Singh and another brother-in-law Mahabir, locked her in a room on the night of January 19 and set her ablaze after pouring kerosene. She died on January 24. 

 The police registered a case under various sections of the IPC. Dharambir?s brother Mahabir was, however, acquitted for lack of evidence and Dariya Singh died while the case was on. 

 Fine for secrecy

 Akola (PTI): Five Akola Municipal Corporation 

 officials have been fined over Rs 1.5 lakh for not supplying 

 information sought by applicants.

 Corporation commissioner Gajananrao Ghate on Tuesday passed the order under the Right to Information Act and on the basis of petitions filed by the applicants. The fine will be recovered from the salary of the officials, the order clarified.

 Models? case

 Mumbai (PTI): The hearing in the obscenity 

 case registered against models Madhu Sapre and Milind Soman 

 has been deferred to January 4 by a local court. The two 

 had posed semi-nude with a python wrapped around their bodies 

 for a shoe advertisement nine years ago.

 Organ traders

 Srinagar (PTI): Three persons were arrested 

 for allegedly being involved in human organ trade. Kalim-ud-din, 

 M.K. Talashi and Ramesh Talashi were arrested on Tuesday 

 after court officials became suspicious of the donor?s identity. 

 Din had filed an affidavit as Suresh Kumar who was willing 

 to ?donate? his kidney, sources said.

 Jewellery fest

 Jaipur (PTI): Manufacturers from Pakistan 

 and Nepal will participate in the Jaipur Jewellery Show 

 next week. This is the first time that the two neighbours 

 will take part in it. The four-day show will promote coloured 

 gemstones and studded jewellery made in the pink city.

 Temple theft

 Sabanmala (PTI): An official on pilgrimage 

 season duty at the Lord Ayyappa hill temple was arrested 

 on Tuesday on the charge of stealing gold and cash offerings 

 made by devotees.

 Lover stabs girl

 Guntur (PTI): T. Balaabbai stabbed 17-year-old 

 P. Balakumari after she spurned his love. He then committed 

 suicide by throwing himself before a running train. The 

 girl is battling for life in a government hospital.

 Karnataka, in an attempt to boost tourist inflow, has come up with ?honeymoon gift coupons?, for newly-weds. The coupons purchased by well wishers will entail the couples to visit attractive destinations in the state.

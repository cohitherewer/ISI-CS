 Konkan cold to Congress 

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 Ratnagiri (Maharashtra), Oct. 11: Congress worker Abdul Wahab is a picture of frustration. His party?s candidate for Sangameshwar Assembly seat, Hussain Dalvai, has no money, no infrastructure and the ?half-hearted? support of its leaders. 

 For Dalvai, who did the socialist gamut via the Janata Dal and Samajwadi Party before landing in the Congress, things cannot get worse. This is his first foray into electoral politics, but evidently he rooted for the wrong party.

 Once its stronghold, the Congress lost Konkan ? accounting for 30 seats ? to the BJP-Shiv Sena combine in 1991. If the dejection among Dalvai?s supporters is any indication, the Congress-Nationalist Congress Party combine has not strained its nerves to win it back either. 

 Last Wednesday, a meeting addressed by chief minister Sushil Kumar Shinde in Sangameshwar drew a surprisingly large crowd. But ?no thanks to the CM?, Wahab said. ?People thought filmstar Govinda was coming. He did not and nobody then waited to listen to Shinde.? 

 The Congress? calculation is, since conventionally Konkan?s politics was tied to Mumbai, the alliance would ?do well? as Mumbai was tipped to go the Congress-NCP way like it did in the Lok Sabha polls.

 This logic was contested by the BJP-Sena, which said in the May elections, of the four parliamentary seats in Konkan, three were won by them. 

 The verdant belt, fringed by the Sahyadri hills that span the coastline from Thane to Sindhudurg, is a problem area for the Congress-NCP alliance not just because of the BJP-Sena combine, but also because of the Peasant and Workers Party ? an old offshoot of the Congress ? and the perception that the ruling Democratic Front government has ignored the region.

 Deepak Patwardhan, a Ratnagiri-based lawyer, attributed the BJP-Sena?s growth to the ?historical neglect? of Konkan by successive regimes (barring the BJP-Sena?s) and the roots the RSS and Hindu Mahasabha have struck. 

 V.D. Savarkar had worked here to ?liberate? Hindu temples from Brahmin dominance and although the BJP-Sena alliance?s campaign avoided any overt reference to the removal of the plaque inscribed with Savarkar?s sayings in Port Blair, ?the message is in every Hindu?s heart here?, Patwardhan said.

 When the BJP was a nascent entity in Maharashtra, Konkan produced the party?s first important leader in Kusumtai Abhayankar, who became its first MLA from the region and campaigned for rural electrification. 

 Sena leader Bal Thackeray?s ?Maharashtra for Maharashtrians? slogan caught the imagination of the Konkan voters because they were dependent on the government sector for jobs. Even today, Ratnagiri has only two industries while Konkan?s tourism potential remains untapped. 

 ?It is a remittance economy. Those who can help it migrate to Mumbai and sustain their families through money-order remittances,? said Bhau Desai, a Sena corporator. The Konkan-Mumbai economic network has also translated itself into similar voting patterns in successive elections.

 If the Sena alerted Mumbaikars about the ?potential threat? of Maharashtrians being overrun by Uttar Pradesh and Bihar migrants, in Konkan south Indians are an eye-sore. 

 A Marathi-speaking employee of a nationalised bank said: ?Every bank here has a Krishnan or Subrahmaniam as a manager. These chaps bring their Muthus and Swamis from Tamil Nadu as their drivers and chaprasis because they say they can communicate better with them. Over the years, they pull strings and regularise their appointments without going through the employment exchange. Our boys twiddle their thumbs.?

 The other pluses for the BJP-Sena were their control over the rural panchayats and zilla parishads and the presence of former chief minister Narayan Rane as Konkan?s ?tallest? leader.

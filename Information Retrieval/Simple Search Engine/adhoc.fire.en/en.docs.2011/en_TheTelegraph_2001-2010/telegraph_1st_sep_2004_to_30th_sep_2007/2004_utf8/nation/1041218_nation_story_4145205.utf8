The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Good vibes for peace, ahead of talks

 PRANAY SHARMA

 New Delhi, Dec. 17: Pakistan has not put forth any formal proposal on Pervez Musharraf?s out-of-the-box proposals on Kashmir but India acknowledges that there has been a discernible shift in its stand.

 Delhi hopes the change in position will help strengthen the ongoing peace process.

 India thinks ?internal dynamics? in Pakistan have created a situation where ?anti-Indianism? has been replaced by ?anti-Americanism?.

 Delhi feels this has left little room for the Islamabad establishment to make the fine distinction between jihadis operating in Afghanistan and those who are in Kashmir.

 This, along with a strong constituency for peace in Pakistan, has forced its leadership to take the normalisation process more seriously than it has done in the past. India has argued that the confidence-building measures it has proposed are not an attempt to distract the focus from resolving the Kashmir issue.

 Delhi has stressed it would do anything ?in the realm of realistic possibility? on Kashmir.

 But it has made clear that the confidence measures are an ?integral part?, not just of the attempt to resolve the Kashmir problem but also of the process that will ultimately lead to lasting peace.

 Delhi?s positive signals barely 10 days before foreign secretary Shyam Saran meets his Pakistani counterpart Riaz Khokar in Islamabad will help the sides conduct talks in a cordial atmosphere and with a positive approach to narrowing down differences.

 The two senior officials and their delegations meet in the Pakistani capital on December 27 and 28.

 Changing the status of Kashmir?s regions, including the part under Islamabad?s control, was among Pakistan President Musharraf?s proposals.

 South Block?s initial reaction of dismissing most of the proposals, albeit privately, as ?nothing new? led Pakistani leaders to clarify that they were not meant for India but intended instead to generate a ?debate? in their own country.

 The Indian establishment is now willing to see some of the ?positive elements? in Musharraf?s proposals.

 The most significant, feels Delhi, is Islamabad?s acknowledgment that Jammu and Kashmir is a ?complex entity? not limited to the Srinagar Valley.

 India has long argued that links between Shias on either side of the Line of Control and affinities between various tribes living in the two Kashmirs are very strong and should be encouraged. As a result, Delhi has stressed on measures that would result in increased people-to-people contact.

 Delhi has said it is willing to be more flexible to get the proposed Muzaffarabad-Srinagar bus service started so long as it does not have to compromise overly with its ?national and security interests?.

 India feels the last round of talks on the nuclear confidence-building measures has gone off quite well as substantial discussions took place. However, the two countries failed to finalise a draft agreement on prior notification of missile tests.

 Even so, the neighbours have agreed they need to be ?more generous? in sharing data on the tests.

 This would include giving each other more time before the tests are conducted, providing information on where the tests are taking place and the range of the missiles.

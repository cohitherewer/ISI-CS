 PM wishes Bardhan, sends flowers

Singh (top), Bardhan: Birthday greetings 

 New Delhi, Sept. 25: Days after declaring he didn?t remember his own birthday, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh remembered A.B. Bardhan?s and called all the way from New York to wish him.

 The call first came at 8 in the morning when the CPI leader was in the bath. Ten minutes later, Singh called again. An hour and a half later, a bouquet from the Prime Minister?s Office landed at Ajay Bhavan, the CPI headquarters, with a letter from the Prime Minister.

 Bardhan, who turned 74, was pleasantly surprised that Singh had remembered and bothered to call in the midst of weightier preoccupations.

 The leader congratulated Singh on his talks with President Pervez Musharraf. Singh asked whether he had read the joint statement and told him the talks would have to proceed to something more substantive.

 In his letter, Singh said: ?As a trade union leader and a leader of the Communist Party of India your selfless service and contribution to the cause of the upliftment of the poor and working class is an inspiration for the first generation of political leaders.

 ?Please accept my best wishes for your continued well-being and for many years in the service of the nation.?

 CPI leaders said never before had a Prime Minister wished the party general secretary on his birthday. Although they tried to appear casual, they were pleased with Singh?s personal touch and his gesture of friendship towards his crucial allies. ?It was 10.30 in the night in New York and 8 in the morning here when the call came from New York,? a leader said.

 The days when the Left was particularly suspicious of Singh ? after he piloted the reforms during the Narasimha Rao regime ? appear to be over. Bardhan now certifies him as a ?gentlemen? who is ?sincere? about what he wants to do. The CPM, too, has spared him overt criticism barring one instance when Singh said he wanted education to be free of the influence of both Left and Right fundamentalists.

 Singh?s gesture comes at a time when barbs have been flying between Left leaders and the UPA government. But this is interspersed with occasions when they have shaken hands and broken bread together.

 Doctors? strike to protest assault

 Mumbai (PTI): Nearly 500 resident doctors 

 of KEM Hospital went on strike on Monday, protesting manhandling 

 of one of their colleagues.

 A patient?s relatives allegedly assaulted Dr Amol Bhalekar, a resident doctor of the radiology department, on Sunday night, hospital sources said. He had to be admitted to the hospital for treatment.

 As no technicians are on duty in the radiology department on Sundays, the doctors themselves take X-rays of patients.

 On Sunday, when some persons from the casualty ward came for an X-ray, one of the patient?s relatives demanded that the patient be given priority. However, when Bhalekar replied that he would follow the order of first-come-first-served, he was beaten up.

 The attackers ran away when another doctor from the radiology department, Amol Ingole, came to Bhalekar?s rescue. A doctor said Bhalekar sustained an injury in the skull.

 The resident doctors alleged that there was not enough security in the hospital. The dean of the hospital is meeting the doctors to sort out the matter, sources said.

 Tainted officer surrenders

 Jammu (PTI): Jammu and Kashmir financial 

 commissioner Ajit Kumar surrendered before the vigilance

 Kumar had been evading arrest for the past fortnight since raids on his residences in Jammu, Srinagar and New Delhi in connection with the scam.

 Kumar, who gave himself up before the deputy inspector-general, vigilance, was taken away in the presence of his lawyers.

 Kumar?s pleas for bail in the anti-corruption court, Jammu and Kashmir High Court and the Supreme Court have been rejected.

 Badal gets trial respite

 has stayed the trial of a disproportionate assets case against

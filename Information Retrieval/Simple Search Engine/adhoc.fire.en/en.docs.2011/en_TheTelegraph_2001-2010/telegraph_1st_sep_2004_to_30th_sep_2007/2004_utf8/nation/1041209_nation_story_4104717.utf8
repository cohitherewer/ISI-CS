 Delhi complains of F-16 shadow

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 8: India has told the US that the sale of arms to Pakistan when peace talks between the neighbours are at a ?sensitive stage? will have a ?negative impact? on the goodwill Washington currently enjoys in the country.

 Foreign minister K. Natwar Singh told the Lok Sabha this today while replying to a debate on the government?s foreign policy. 

 The minister tried to calm anxious MPs worried by newspaper reports about the possible sale of F-16s to Pakistan.

 Singh said the government was aware that the George W. Bush administration had approached the US Congress over a weapons package for Pakistan that includes surveillance aircraft and anti-tank missiles.

 The minister told the House that Delhi has told Washington of the fallout the arms sale may have on peace talks. 

 The US government has said no decision has been taken and a sale is not imminent.

 Singh said he would take up the issue with US defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld when they meet tomorrow. He assured Parliament that if the US sold arms Pakistan, India would also upgrade its defence systems.

 Terming India?s relations with the US as ?special?, the minister said ties were being expanded across the board. 

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh?s meeting with President Bush in September had led to a re-affirmation of the strategic partnership between the countries, he added.

 ?Our perspectives on specific issues may be different and that may lead to differences in policies. However, we share a great and enduring affinity as peoples wedded to democratic values... India-US relations are beginning to acquire a degree of stability and predictability. We are ready to work together on shared concerns,? Natwar Singh said.

 The minister said India had left behind a reactive policy towards Pakistan that regularly oscillated between euphoria and despair. 

 ?We are engaged in a sustained and comprehensive dialogue process. We will not be deflected by transient developments and often contradictory pronouncements from the other side of the border,? he said.

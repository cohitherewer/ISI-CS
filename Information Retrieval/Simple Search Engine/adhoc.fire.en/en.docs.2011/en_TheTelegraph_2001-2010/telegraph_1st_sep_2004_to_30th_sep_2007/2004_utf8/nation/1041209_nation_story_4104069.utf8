 Land reform gets a boost

 R. VENKATARAMAN

 New Delhi, Dec. 8: The Supreme Court has upheld the constitutional validity of the West Bengal Land Reforms Act in a judgment that will drastically expand the scope of land-reform measures by various states.

 ?Land reforms? in its sweep and ambit would also include ?agricultural lands?, ruled the division bench of Justices Shivaraj V. Patil and B.N. Srikrishna in a judgment delivered on December 3 and made available today.

 A land reforms act by a state would thus include in its sweep reforms relating to agricultural lands, too, and provide all related regulating powers to a government ? as applicable to any land other than agricultural land.

 ?Agrarian reforms itself is a wide concept and we do not see (any reason) why the objects attempted to be fulfilled by the specified Acts would not fall within the ambit of this compendious term,? Justice Srikrishna observed, writing the judgment for the bench.

 The bench upheld the constitutional validity of a tenancy tribunal to adjudicate cases relating to land, and said that hence ? with particular reference to Bengal ? all pending cases might be transferred to the tribunal.

 In the instant case, the basic challenge to the West Bengal Tenancy Tribunal Act ? coming under the land reforms act ? was that it was violative of the Constitution?s basic structure as it provided for transfer of all pending cases to the tribunal.

 The apex court rejected the argument.

 A land reforms law, as long as it related to ?land reforms?, was sufficient to fall within the ambit of Article 323B of the Constitution, the bench said. The article enables a state to introduce land reforms laws and form tribunals to adjudicate disputes relating to land, including agricultural or ?agrarian? land.

 ?In testing as to whether the law (a land reform law brought in by a state) was intended for agrarian reform, the court is required to look to the substance of the act and not its mere outward form,? the bench said.

 The judges went on to quote Justice V.R. Krishna Iyer from a judgment in the case of State of Kerala vs Gwalior Rayon, 1973. 

 ?The concept of agrarian reform is a complex and dynamic one promoting wider interests than conventional reorganisation of the land system or distribution of land,? the bench quoted.

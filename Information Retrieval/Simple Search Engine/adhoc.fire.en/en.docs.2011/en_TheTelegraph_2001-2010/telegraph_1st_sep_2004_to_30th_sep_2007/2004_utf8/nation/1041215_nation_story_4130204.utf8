 Naxalites fire truce salvo

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Hyderabad, Dec. 14: The Naxalites today blamed the Andhra Pradesh government of violating the ceasefire agreement reached before the first round of peace talks in October. In the same breath, they called for extension of the truce, which expires on Thursday, by another six months to facilitate the dialogue. 

 Spokesperson of the Communist Party of India (Maoist) P. Varavara Rao, another representative G. Kalyan Rao and Chandranna of Janashakti told reporters that the Greyhound ? an anti-Naxalite force ? was let loose on their activists in the name of maintaining law and order. ?It is the government which is violating the conducive environment for talks, not the Maoists,? Varavara Rao said. 

 He added that the government should immediately end the combing operations and extend the ceasefire pact, pointing out that the public and democratic organisations were keen on the second round of talks to find a lasting solution to the Naxalite problem. 

 Police have reported two incidents of clashes with Maoists in the jungles of Khammam and Karimagar. Moreover, five Naxalites, including two top leaders, surrendered early this week. Last week, six prominent rebels had laid down arms.

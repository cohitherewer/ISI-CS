 Unhappy with seats, Left to go it alone

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 21: Sore 

 at being allotted only four out of the 288 seats on offer 

 in the Maharashtra Assembly, the Left parties have refused 

 to accept the Congress? seat-share deal and say they will 

 go it alone in the October 13 elections.

 ?The CPM and the CPI will together field candidates in 22/23 seats,? CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan said. Pointing out that the CPM has two sitting MLAs in the Maharashtra House and the CPI none, the general secretary added: ?This virtually means that the Congress is offering us not four but just two (new) seats.?

 The Congress thinks the Left demand for more seats is unjustified. Its leaders want a tight seat-sharing deal to prevent secular votes from splintering. But the Left appears determined to contest elections on its own. ?There will be fights with the Congress in the constituencies where we have our own candidates,? Bardhan said.

 Senior CPI leader D. Raja said he had taken up the matter with Congress chief Sonia Gandhi before her party announced the seat-share deal last night. But Sonia said the high command had left the decision to the Maharashtra state committee.

 Congress chief minister Sushil Kumar Shinde met CPM leader Sitaram Yechury at the party headquarters last week to discuss the Sholapur (South) seat: the CPM had unilaterally announced candidates for 18 seats including Sholapur, Shinde?s constituency.

 The chief minister said it was important for secular forces to band together to prevent fragmentation of anti Shiv Sena-BJP votes.

 This is not the first time the Left has had differences with allies over seat-sharing. The CPM had demanded five Bihar Lok Sabha seats from partner Rashtriya Janata Dal for last May?s elections but had to make do with only one ? Bhagalpur, where the party already had a sitting MP.

 In Andhra Pradesh, the CPM put up candidates unilaterally without working out an arrangement with the Congress. But it later withdrew candidates from many seats and backed the Congress to shut out the Telugu Desam Party-BJP combine.

 Left leaders admit they are dependent on partners like the Congress, RJD and the Samajwadi Party in most states as their influence is limited to Bengal and Kerala. Despite this, the Left?s state units are always keen to field as many candidates as possible.

 Bansi Lal boost for Congress 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 14: The Congress today further consolidated its position in Haryana ahead of next year?s Assembly polls after Bansi Lal?s party merged with it.

 The merger of the Haryana Vikas Party was formally announced in the presence of leaders from both sides at the Congress headquarters here this evening.

 The return of the veteran leader, who had broken away to float his own party eight years ago after internal squabbles, was round the corner after his son Surender Singh, the HVP general secretary, met Congress chief Sonia Gandhi here last week.

 Surender represented his father here today in the company of state Congress chief Bhajan Lal, once a rival of Bansi Lal, AICC general secretary in charge of Haryana Janardhan Dwivedi, and foreign minister K. Natwar Singh.

 Bansi Lal?s return is not expected to disturb the equations in the state Congress as he may not seek an active role but accept governorship of one of the northern states, probably Rajasthan, if incumbent Madan Lal Khurana decides to opt for active politics in Delhi.

 His return will help the Congress woo the Jats in Haryana though even without a credible leader from the community, the party had won nine of the 10 Lok Sabha seats in the state in May. The HVP was virtually decimated in the polls, prompting Bansi Lal to open up to the Congress before Assembly polls in February, 2005.

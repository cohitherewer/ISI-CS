 ?Tough? Uma dogs Advani

 New Delhi, Nov. 8: As L.K. Advani turned 78 today, sources close to him admitted that the former deputy Prime Minister, into his fifth term as BJP chief, faces his ?toughest? challenge ever.

 He is up against a rebellious Uma Bharti; at the same time, those opposed to the way she is being ?indulged? by the party brass are growing in number.

 Advani opted for a low-key celebration at his residence, welcoming guests ? mainly BJP leaders and activists ? with laddoos.

 He went into a huddle with some of his confidants in the evening, seeking a ?solution? to the crisis that has erupted after Uma, a former Madhya Pradesh chief minister, took on the BJP leadership on various counts.

 The BJP?s senior leaders meet again tomorrow to ?review? the Madhya Pradesh situation and consider if it would be right to accede to the sadhvi?s demands to buy peace with her. The demands reportedly include not having a chairperson for the proposed government-party coordination panel in Madhya Pradesh so that every member is on an ?equal footing?.

 The original plan was to have Arun Jaitley chair the panel, which would comprise Uma, Madhya Pradesh chief minister Babulal Gaur and BJP state unit chief Kailash Joshi. But sources close to Uma said it would be ?improper? to have Jaitley in control since both are BJP general secretaries. If a dispute arises, Advani should be the arbiter, the sources said.

 Uma?s other demands, conveyed to Advani through mutual well-wisher S. Gurumurthy, include making prot?g? Prahlad Patel the BJP state chief and being given charge of the Bihar election campaign. The sadhvi also wants to be actively involved in training party cadre.

 Sources said Uma is ready to drop her ?oust Pramod Mahajan? campaign if her demands are met.

 The former chief minister won the first round of the battle of attrition when BJP leaders agreed to retain her candidates for the mayoral elections in Bhopal and Indore.

 Sumitra Mahajan, the Indore Lok Sabha MP who handed in her resignation to Advani to protest the nomination of Uma?s proxy candidate, was persuaded to stay on with the argument that Uma Shashi Sharma was Sumitra?s ?original prot?g?? and there was ?little point? in making her nomination a prestige issue.

 But BJP leaders say Uma?s other demands may not be met. ?The question of making Patel the state BJP chief does not arise,? a party leader said, as he had defied the party whip and filed papers as an Independent for the Nahota byelection. His candidacy was rejected on a technical point.

 Besides, with a backward caste ?public face? in Uma and a chief minister in Gaur, the BJP does not want to risk losing upper caste support by having a member from the Other Backward Classes occupy another top post.

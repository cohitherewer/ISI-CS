 Ranchi, Nov. 24: L.K. Advani today made it clear that his party?s mass mobilisation strategy would have Hindutva as its core, Jayendra Saraswati?s arrest and other such ?assaults on Hinduism? as its substance and ?genuine secularism? and ?national unity? as the outward wrapping.

 Delivering the presidential address at the BJP national executive, which began a three-day meeting here, Advani said the Kanchi acharya?s arrest had ?deeply wounded people?s faith?.

 Advani explained why his party took to the streets. ?Recently, the BJP demonstrated its mass mobilisation capabilities by taking up two issues that touched the hearts and minds of every patriot in this country ? namely, the insult meted out by the UPA government and the Congress-communist combine to a national hero, Veer Savarkar, and to a national icon, the Tricolour.?

 The second reason he gave was that the Kanchi seer?s arrest, like the Ram temple issue, was a ?powerful? counter to the BJP?s ?ideological and political adversaries?. ?By launching the relay hunger strike and dharna on November 20, we have begun a campaign through which, as in the Ram Janmabhoomi issue, we will powerfully counter our ideological and political adversaries, reaffirm the meaning of genuine secularism (and) strengthen national unity?? 

 To prove his contention that the Kanchi issue transcended the bounds of Hindutva and had ?wider ramification?, he thanked those from the non-BJP spectrum who backed its agitation: former President R. Venkataraman, former Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar and NDA convener George Fernandes.

 While the executive is expected to devise ways to sustain the perceived tempo generated by the protests, Advani indicated that the new line would be that Hindus got the wrong end of the stick while non-Hindus were indulged by ?secular? parties in similar cases. ?But let every adversary of ours be warned: if anybody tries to take the cover of secularism to indulge in anti-Hindu politics and statecraft, the BJP will stand in their path like a rock, prepared to make any sacrifices,? the party chief declared.

 The talking points offered by Advani to take the campaign forward were: why did the Congress government in 1994 apologise to a Muslim seminary in Uttar Pradesh (Lucknow?s Nadva) when the Intelligence Bureau had raided the campus to arrest suspected ISI-backed terrorists?

 Aware that he was speaking in a state which has a large tribal presence, he asked why no voices were being raised against the ?fraudulent conversions of poor tribals?.

 Without mentioning human resource development minister Arjun Singh, Advani fulminated at his ?detoxification? agenda. ?Who has created this bizarre and perverse intellectual atmosphere in this country where anything associated with Hinduism, Hindu ethos and Hindu faith is considered communal, obscurantist and ? my blood boils when I hear the term ? ?toxic?,? he thundered.

 Advani said India was what it was principally because of its Hindu ethos. ?Remove this Hindu ethos, and there will be no India left.?

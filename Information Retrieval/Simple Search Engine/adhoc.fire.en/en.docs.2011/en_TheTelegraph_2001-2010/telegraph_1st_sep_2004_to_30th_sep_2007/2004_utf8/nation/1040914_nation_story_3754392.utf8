 Modi plea in NRI deaths

 Ahmedabad, Sept. 13 (PTI): Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi and former state home minister Gordhan Zadaphia, in identical written statements before a court, today said they could not be held responsible for the killing of two UK-based NRIs in the post-Godhra violence in the state.

 The submissions by the two before the designated judge M.M. Kayastha in Sabarkantha district were similar to the one by the state government that Modi and the seven others named as respondents could not be held responsible for the death of the two British citizens. 

 The government said ?an attempt is being made to project Modi, the then minister of state for home Zadaphia and six others as anti-Muslim?, and urged that the Rs 22 crore compensation suit for the killing of Saeed Safid Dawood and Shakeel Abdul Haid on February 28, 2002, be dismissed.

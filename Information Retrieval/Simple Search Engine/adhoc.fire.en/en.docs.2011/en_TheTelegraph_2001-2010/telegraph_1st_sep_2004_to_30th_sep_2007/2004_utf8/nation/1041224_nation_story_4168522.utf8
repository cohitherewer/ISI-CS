 Ex-MLA killed

 Patna, Dec. 23: Former MLA Pankaj Kumar Sinha was shot dead this morning. Police said local criminals are the prime suspects as Sinha had been vocal against their activities. 

 Sinha, who once represented Islampur in Nalanda district, had left the Congress to join the Janata Dal (United) before the Lok Sabha poll. He was likely to contest the Assembly poll as a Dal (U) candidate.

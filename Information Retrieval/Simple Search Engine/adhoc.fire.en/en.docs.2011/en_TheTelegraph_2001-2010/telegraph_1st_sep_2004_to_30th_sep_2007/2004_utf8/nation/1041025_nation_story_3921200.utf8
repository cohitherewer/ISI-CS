 Cong offers more berths for CM seat

 New Delhi, Oct. 24: The Congress has offered to yield more ministerial berths and portfolios to the Nationalist Congress Party but has insisted on the chief minister?s chair in Maharashtra.

 In the first formal proposal to end the eight-day old deadlock over government formation, the Congress leadership today communicated to the NCP leadership that the Congress would continue to head the government.

 The NCP, which emerged as the larger of the two parties in the new Assembly, was offered three additional ministerial berths and two additional portfolios over and above those it held in the outgoing Sushil Kumar Shinde ministry. 

 Congress president Sonia Gandhi?s political secretary Ahmed Patel is understood to have conveyed the proposal over phone to NCP leader Praful Patel late this evening.

 Within minutes of formally communicating the party?s offer, senior party leader and chief negotiator Pranab Mukherjee went public.

 The proposal is learnt to have been firmed up after a meeting of senior party leaders last night at Mukherjee?s residence. Among those present were Arjun Singh, Ghulam Nabi Azad, Ahmed Patel, Margaret Alva and Shinde. 

 The NCP leadership continued to maintain that chief ministership should come to its nominee. Party leader Sharad Pawar and his senior colleagues were scheduled to meet at his residence later tonight to consider the Congress proposal.

 Before he went for the meeting, Praful said he did not ?see much enthusiasm about the proposal?. 

 ?This is the first proposal from their (Congress) side. I have to discuss with my colleagues before making any formal comment. However, I can say that initial response from colleagues is not very enthusiastic. I can?t see much enthusiasm in my party,? he said. 

 The fact that the Congress has chosen to sent a formal proposal has fuelled speculation in the party ranks that the NCP might be prepared to leave chief ministership to the ally, its public posture notwithstanding. 

 Sources said the NCP has been ?waiting? for a concrete move from the Congress for the past few days. 

 In the outgoing 43-member Shinde ministry, the two parties had 21 berths each. 

 According to the new proposal, the NCP can have up to 24 slots. 

 In addition to all the plum portfolios the NCP currently holds ? home, finance, PWD and power ? the Congress is understood to have offered to give up revenue and cooperatives and urban development portfolios to NCP nominees. 

 From Praful?s initial reaction, it appeared that the NCP is bargaining for more. Last night, there was speculation that the party was seeking two deputy chief minister slots in the new ministry for its nominees. 

 Though NCP circles discounted the possibility, the Congress camp talked about a possible meeting later tonight between Pawar and Mukherjee with a view to pave way for ministry formation.

 During the day, CPM general secretary Harkishen Singh Surjeet offered to mediate. But Pawar did not favour third party mediation. 

 Asked about Surjeet?s offer, the NCP chief said he had not ?heard of anything directly? from the CPM leader. However, he added: ?We (the Congress and the NCP) are competent to deal with the situation. It is a matter directly between the two parties.? 

 Confident of clinching an agreement that would allow it to keep the chief ministership, the Congress high command has convened a meeting of the legislature party in Mumbai tomorrow to elect the leader.

 Indications are that the party would favour Shinde?s continuation as chief minister. The NCP, too, has called its legislature party meeting tomorrow.

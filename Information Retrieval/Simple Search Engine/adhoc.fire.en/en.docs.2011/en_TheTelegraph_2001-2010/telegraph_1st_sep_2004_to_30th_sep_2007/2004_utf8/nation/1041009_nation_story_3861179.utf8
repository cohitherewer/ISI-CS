 Assam outfit calls truce

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Guwahati, Oct. 8: The banned National Democratic Front of Boroland today announced a unilateral ceasefire for six months, beginning October 15, ?to create a congenial atmosphere and initiate talks? with Delhi. 

 However, Dispur said the veracity of the statement was yet to be ascertained. ?They have not communicated anything to us. So we have to wait and watch,? chief minister Tarun Gogoi said.

 The group?s announcement ? that comes 18 years after it was formed to fight for a ?sovereign Bodo state? ? came within hours of the Unified Command?s decision to launch an all-out offensive against militants.

 ?In response to the ceasefire offer by chief minister Tarun Gogoi, the NDFB has declared a ceasefire with effect from October 15 for a period of six months to create a congenial atmosphere and initiate talks with the government of India,? the Bodo group said in its statement, purportedly signed by its president D.R. Nabla and ?commander-in-chief? B. Susranggra. 

 The special secretary to the chief minister, B.K. Gohain, said the government would have to verify the statement and consult the Centre before deciding on a reciprocal gesture.

 Id spirit soars among Kashmiris

 MUKHTAR AHMAD 

 Srinagar, Nov. 12: After tumult over the alleged rape of a woman and her daughter by an army major, preparations for Id received a shot in the arm with the Prime Minister?s Diwali announcement of troops reduction in the state. 

 The people are already enjoying the benefits of a ceasefire along the borders with Pakistan that came into force exactly a year ago. 

 The markets are in the grip of a buying frenzy. ?This is a welcome step. Our hope is the security forces deployed in the narrow alleys in Srinagar and villages would be withdrawn forever,? said Abdul Rashid, a shopkeeper here. 

 Chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed described the move as a ?major step after the ceasefire on borders to take forward the ongoing process of reconciliation?.

 ?The announcement is a befitting Diwali and Id gift to the people of the state. The troops reduction will further bring down the level of violence in the state,? he said. 

 But separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani said the ?Indian government was trying to hoodwink the world by declaring reduction of troops on one side and restraining Muslims from offering Friday prayers on the holiest Friday of Ramazan?. 

 Geelani was placed under house arrest today as he had called for protests against the alleged rape. 

 Mirwaiz Omar Farooq, chairman of the moderate faction of the All Parties Hurriyat Conference, welcomed the decision and demanded that the Armed Forces Special Powers Act, too, should be withdrawn. 

 ?Demilitarisation is an important step towards peace and resolution of the Kashmir problem and we welcome it. But this must be followed by withdrawal of AFSPA,? the Mirwaiz said.

NATION BRIEFS

 Indore, Oct. 16 (PTI): A superintendent of police and three women constables 

have been suspended for allegedly torturing a woman in Sanyogitaganj police station 

during interrogation into a theft case.

 The constables and other policemen, in the presence of SP Vineet Jain, allegedly used third-degree methods to extract a confession from the woman in connection with a theft of Rs 1.90 lakh belonging to a trader with whom her husband worked as a cashier. A medical examination showed the woman was tortured severely.

 New York (PTI): A US court has sentenced a 22-year-old India-born bank teller to 13 months in prison for being an accomplice in a bank robbery. Rajiv Sidhana was convicted for committing the crime with three others. Sidhana, who would have received a Bachelor of Science degree in information technology in December, faces deportation after release as he is not a permanent resident or a US citizen.

 Madurai (PTI): A monkey entered the chamber of a sub-judge 

on the district court premises in Tiruchirapalli and fled with a cellphone and 

a pen. The monkey entered the room as the judge was busy elsewhere. After several 

efforts to retrieve the articles failed, an advocate dialled the cellphone number. 

As the phone vibrated, the panicky monkey abandoned it.

 Students ail at crimson tide

 Thiruvananthapuram, Sept. 17: 

 A nauseating smell associated with the ?red tide bloom? 

 phenomenon in coastal waters sent nearly 300 pupils in the 

 coastal hamlets near here to hospital.

 But most of the students who were vomiting and complaining of headache this morning were discharged by afternoon after their symptoms cleared. 

 Sree Avittam Tirunal Hospital superintendent Dr K. Rajmohan said there was no need to worry as the children had merely reacted to the non-toxic smell of decaying fish.

 The ?red time bloom? occurs when the coastal waters turn red as plankton (algae) breed quickly during the monsoon, emitting neuro-toxins. Fish that feed on toxic planktons die and are washed ashore, leading to a strong stench on the coast.

 Local fishermen say this is not a new phenomenon, adding that there are times when they don?t eat fish, fearing contamination. This usually happens during the monsoon when nutrient-rich sewage drains into the sea, leading to a favourable marine environment for quick reproduction of plankton.

 The bloom was first reported from Kollam, 75 km south of the Kerala capital, a fortnight ago.

 A team from the Centre for Earth Science Studies, led by scientist P.P. Ouseph, identified the organism as coclodeneum, a species belonging to the dinoflagellate group of marine plankton.

 Centre director M. Baba said the ?red tide bloom? also depletes the water of oxygen content, leaving several fish species, especially those confined to the seabed, virtually asphyxiated. 

 Red tides are caused by the abundance of dinoflagellates that produce potent neuro-toxins. The plankton-rich water turns red, thus causing a ?red tide bloom?.

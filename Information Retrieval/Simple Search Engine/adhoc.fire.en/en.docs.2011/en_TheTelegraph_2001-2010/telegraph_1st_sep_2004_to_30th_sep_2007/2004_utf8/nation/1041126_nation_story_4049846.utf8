 Jammu hugs ceasefire silence

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Jammu, Nov. 25: Buses whizzing between Jammu and Sialkot, instead of bullets across the border, is closer to fruition for the people living here, now that a year has passed since the ceasefire between India and Pakistan started.

 On the first anniversary of the ceasefire today, border resident Sham Lal said: ?It is a great feeling. We had not imagined we would be back at our homes and there would be no fear and disruption from gunfire.?

 Sham Lal travels daily from Abullian, the village that suffered much of the devastation during the skirmishes between India and Pakistan.

 Not a single bullet has been fired at each other by either side since the ceasefire came into effect last year on the midnight of November 25, which was Id.

 In the silence of the guns, the sounds of domesticity have taken over with the return of the border families that had fled the daily exchange of fire.

 They had abandoned their homes and taken shelter in tented colonies and dilapidated buildings, looking to government doles to survive.

 With the restoration of their dignity, the border residents now want the proposed bus service to seal the prevailing peace forever. Taking up an Indian suggestion, Pakistan yesterday renewed the proposal to start the service between Jammu and Sialkot at the bilateral talks in Delhi. Islamabad had earlier rejected the idea.

 Personnel of the Border Security Force, too, are breathing easy, now that the volatile border duty is no longer a daily feature. BSF officers on duty at Suchetgarh Octroi said nothing can match the benefits of peace.

 Big RDX haul

 Security forces in the Valley have seized 648 kg of the high-power explosive RDX within a week following the latest haul last night, reports our correspondent from Srinagar.

 On a tip-off, troops raided a place deep in the jungle near Ashmuqam, 75 km from Srinagar in south Kashmir?s Anantnag district, late yesterday, a defence spokesman said. ?During the search of the jungle, the troops recovered 300 kg of RDX.?

 Earlier this week, army and state police in a joint operation recovered 348 kg of the deadly explosive during a raid on a shop in Anantnag town.

 Today, four persons, including two policemen, were killed in separate incidents in south Kashmir. Police said militants attacked with grenades and assault rifles a team of the special operations group (SOG) of the state police that was raiding a suspected hideout in Anchidoora in Anantnag town on a tip-off.

 Two SOG members, identified as constables Imtiaz Ahmad and Sanjiv Singh, died on the spot. Another constable was critically wounded and rushed to hospital.

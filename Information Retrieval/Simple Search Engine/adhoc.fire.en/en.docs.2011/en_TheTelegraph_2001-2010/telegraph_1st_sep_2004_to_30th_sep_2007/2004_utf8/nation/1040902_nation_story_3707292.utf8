 Niyogi case in apex court

 R. VENKATARAMAN

 New Delhi, Sept.1: The Shankar Guha Niyogi murder case today came back to haunt Mool Chand Shah and Chandrakant Shah, the owners of Simplex Group, with the CBI contending before the Supreme Court that they should be convicted.

 Niyogi, a firebrand trade union leader from Bengal, had founded the Chhattsigarh Mukti Morcha in undivided Madhya Pradesh and worked for the uplift of the working class. 

 Viewed as a threat by industrialists in the area, Niyogi was murdered by hired assassins belonging to the Paltan Mallah gang in 1992.

 Commencing arguments for the CBI, solicitor-general Amarendra Sharan told a division bench of Justices K.G. Balakrishnan and A.R. Lakshmanan that Madhya Pradesh High Court had erred in acquitting the accused.

 The Shah brothers were awarded life imprisonment for conspiring to kill Niyogi in 1997 after five years of trial in Durg, Madhya Pradesh. 

 A fine of Rs 10 lakh was also slapped on each of them. 

 The amount would have to be divided among Niyogis widow and his three children and invested in a scheme for a minimum period of five years, the trial court had ordered.

 Mallah was sentenced to death, while the hired killers, Gyan Prakash Mishra, Abhay Singh and Awadesh Rai, were given life imprisonment and a fine of Rs 2,000 was imposed on each of them. 

 However, acting on an appeal in 1998, Madhya Pradesh High Court had quashed all the charges and acquitted the accused for want of evidence.

 The CBI appealed against the ruling, saying the high court had erred in assessing the evidence and links on the basis of which the trial court had come to a definite conclusion that Niyogi was murdered by contract killers hired by the owners of Simplex Group.

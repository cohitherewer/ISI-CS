The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 House stalemate continues

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Dec. 8: The Orissa Assembly was adjourned for the fifth day today over the Tangarpada mining issue with the Opposition insisting on a debate on the outcome of the high court judgment and seeking the resignation of chief minister Naveen Patnaik.

 Yesterday, the Speaker had summoned advocate-general B.K. Mohanty to find out if the issue can be discussed in the House. Mohanty is understood to have told the Speaker that the issue cannot be tabled in the House.

 Soon after the House assembled this morning, Congress chief whip Satya Bhusan Sahoo said the Opposition wanted to have a discussion on the contentious issue. Referring to Mohanty?s remark that the House could not discuss the judgment of Orissa High Court, Sahoo said the AG was trying to bail out the government. 

 He further alleged that the government was backtracking from its earlier position of discussing the issue. The government?s chief whip, Kishore Mohanty, then rose to say that since the government had appealed before the Supreme Court against the high court?s verdict, there was no scope to discuss the issue in the House. 

 The chief whip suggested that since the business advisory committee will meet later in the day to discuss the matter, the House should be adjourned till that time. Deputy Speaker Prahallad Dora said he had no option but to adjourn the House till tomorrow.

 The forced adjournments of the Assembly in the past five days have cost the state exchequer Rs 1 crore as Rs 6,666 is spent per minute to run the show. 

 Law school

 The Orissa government has decided to set up a national law school in the state on the lines of the one in Bangalore. 

 A decision to this effect was taken at a meeting presided over by Naveen Patnaik in the state secretariat yesterday. The law school is expected to function from the next academic year. 

 Industry minister Biswa Bhusan Harichandan, higher education minister Sameer Dey, chief secretary Subash Pani and advocate-general B.K. Mohanty, among others were present in the meeting.

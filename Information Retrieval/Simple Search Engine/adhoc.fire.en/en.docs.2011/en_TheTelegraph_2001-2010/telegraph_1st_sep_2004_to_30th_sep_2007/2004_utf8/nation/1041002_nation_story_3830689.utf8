 Software aid to probe

 G.S. MUDUR

 New Delhi, Oct. 1: Lawyer Kapil Sibal didn?t get the law portfolio, but as minister of science and technology he still wants to transform India?s criminal justice system ? with help from technology.

 Sibal has asked the Centre?s Technology Information Forecasting Assessment Council to develop software for ?tamper-proof? audio-visual records that police officers can use during criminal investigations.

 Police could use it to record statements by witnesses and others during investigations and confront those who make contradictory statements in court, Sibal said today.

 But technology experts and lawyers caution that such ?tamper-proof? records could be unrealistic and may find no use in court.

 ?We can?t change people?s characters, but we would have records of exactly what they had said,? Sibal said. Such records are inadmissible in court, but witnesses who change statements can be confronted with them, he added.

 ?Many of the pieces required for this technology exist, but they need to be put together,? said Anand Patwardhan, the executive director of the council which is involved in assessment, forecasting and funding the development of new technologies.

 Experts say electronic techniques can be devised to determine if an audio-visual record has been tampered with ? an electronic ?red flag? can be made to show up on a record that has been altered.

 Under the current criminal justice system, witnesses can get away by making statements in court that contradict what they initially told investigating officers.

 ?The minister?s intentions are good, but I?m not sure how this is going to translate into reality,? Pavan Duggal, a Supreme Court advocate and cyber law expert, said. 

 ?Existing law makes such an electronic record inadmissible in court and, barring confronting a witness with contradictory statements, I don?t see its use. Lawyers could argue that the record has nothing to do with the case.? 

 Statements to police are inadmissible in court because, lawyers say, the law recognises that police may extract statements through third-degree methods.

 A technical expert said in principle it is possible to detect alteration of electronic records but this would pose a huge challenge. ?I?d like to see it happen, but I don?t think this technology exists,? Sugata Mitra, head of research at the National Institute of Information Technology, said.

 Standard video images run at 25 frames a second and an alteration would, in principle, show up as a ?discontinuity? between two frames. But finding a discontinuity in even a five-second-long sentence would involve scanning 125 frames one by one.

 The technology assessment council will have a brainstorming session here on November 7, bringing together stakeholders to discuss the proposal. Law-enforcement officers and representatives of the technology sector are expected to attend.

 ?The best way to do this is through automation, but to the best of my knowledge, such a system is yet to be developed,? Mitra said.

 Patwardhan said if the idea develops into a project, the council would work with software and technology companies as well as potential users of the technology.

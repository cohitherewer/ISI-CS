 Jaya, Patil in war of words

 Patil

 The Tamil Nadu government?s application before the Supreme Court includes the following conversation between Union home minister Shivraj Patil and chief minister Jayalalithaa on changing the governor, P.S. Ramamohan Rao. The conversation took place on Thursday at 12.30 pm:

 Patil: I am sorry to inform 

 you of the change of the governor of Tamil Nadu.... I have 

 spoken to Mr Barnala and he has agreed.

 Jayalalithaa: Are you consulting 

 me or are you informing me?

 Patil: I am informing you.

 Jayalalithaa: Whether it 

 is a decision already taken?... I would like to have two 

 days to think over the matter and get back to you.

 (The application says: ?But the Union home minister said that the time cannot be granted because the file had already gone from him?)

 Jayalalithaa: Has the order 

 been issued?

 (?Patil said it can be issued any time since the decision has been taken?)

 Jayalalithaa: How could 

 you take the decision without consulting the chief minister? 

 Should I not have been consulted before the decision was 

 taken?

 Patil: The Sarkaria Commission 

 has made this recommendation, but this is the way we usually 

 do these things.

 Jayalalithaa: How could 

 you remove the governor without any reason?

 (?When Patil said that on August 15, 2004, the governor did not take the salute, the chief minister replied that in Tamil Nadu on Independence Day, it is always the chief minister who takes the salute and hoists the flag. The home minister said the governor did not host the tea party on Independence Day.?)

 Jayalalithaa: Are you saying 

 that you are removing the governor only because he did not 

 host the Independence Day tea party?

 Patil: Yes, it is a serious 

 mistake but I don?t want to discuss the reasons any further.

 Jayalalithaa: Can you give 

 me some time, at least two days, to consider the matter 

 and get back to you?

 Patil: I am sorry. It is 

 a decision already taken.

 Jayalalithaa: This means 

 you are informing me and not consulting me.

 Patil: Yes, I am informing 

 you.

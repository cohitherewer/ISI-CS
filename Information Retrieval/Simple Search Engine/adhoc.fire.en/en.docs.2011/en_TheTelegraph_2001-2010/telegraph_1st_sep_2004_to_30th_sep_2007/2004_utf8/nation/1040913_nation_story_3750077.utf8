 TRS heat on Sonia 

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, Sept.12: Till two days ago, they had had hailed Sonia Gandhi as a goddess. But Telengana activists are now threatening to pull her down the pedestal. 

 Furious over a proposal to form a second state reorganisation committee, TRS chief K Chandrasekhar Rao has lashed out against Congressmen of all ranks.

 ?If they (the Congress leaders) continue to place hurdles in the path of a separate Telengana, I will drag both Sonia Gandhi and Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy to the streets,? thundered Rao at a recent conclave of partymen near Hyderabad.

 The street rhetoric of the TRS chief shocked both the state Congress committee and the AICC. 

 The state?s Congressmen were furious over Rao?s choice of words. ?One day he praises Sonia Gandhi as goddess of Telengana and the next he vows to drag her to the streets,? said PCC president D. Srinivas. He has also sent a letter to the Congress president urging her that the Congress part ways with the TRS.

 Strangely, the TDP and the BJP chose to join issue with the Congress. TDP women?s wing chief . Rajakumari castigated Rao for using such words against a woman.

 Doctor recounts days in captivity

 ASHISH SINHA

 Patna, Nov. 21: The Samastipur doctor, who ran away from captivity on Wednesday, has revealed that crime gangs do not kidnap people on a case-to-case basis. Instead, abduction is an ?ongoing industry? for them, which works like a well-oiled machine.

 ?Cases of only prominent people are reported after a hue and cry is raised. But for every such case, there will be at least three or four low-profile cases in which villagers or their children are regularly abducted for ransom. While in captivity, I learnt about a village child who had been kidnapped and released after a payment of Rs 4 lakh,? Dr Nagendra Prasad, told The Telegraph today.

 Prasad was held captive for 20 days. He was shifted at least five times in the Begusarai-Khagaria-Naughachia area adjoining the Ganges. The doctor ran away one day before his kidnappers said they would kill him because the ransom was not coming through and his brother had scaled the amount down to Rs 10 lakh from the ?agreed? Rs 25 lakh.

 Prasad said he had been treated well because he was a doctor.

 ?They gave me whatever food I asked for and even fetched sedatives after I wrote them out on a piece of paper. But they kept me locked in a dingy room most of the time. I was allowed to go out twice ? around 8 pm and 4 am ? to answer nature?s call. One person would sleep with me while two would guard the room with arms,? he recalled.

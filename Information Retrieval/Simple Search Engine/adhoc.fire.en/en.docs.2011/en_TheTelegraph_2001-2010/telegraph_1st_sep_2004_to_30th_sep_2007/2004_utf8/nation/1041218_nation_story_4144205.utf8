 More Indians die in Dubai

 Dubai (PTI): Two Indian workers have 

 allegedly committed suicide here, apparently out of depression.

 The incident comes six days after an Indian worker committed suicide when his company refused to pay him for medical treatment.

 Shelva Kumar, a 25-year-old from Chennai, killed himself on Tuesday. He had been depressed for the past eight months, police said.

 Thomas Anthony, a 30-year-old accountant, committed suicide on Wednesday. He was due to fly home the same night.

 According to Kumar?s roommate, Babu, he came to Dubai a year ago to take up a job as a construction worker in Satwa. ?I met Kumar a year ago and we became good friends. He was a very good person and we all loved him a lot. Kumar was very kind and humble,? he said.

 Babu said that about eight months ago, Kumar?s sister committed suicide in India. From that time on, he had been depressed, the Gulf News quoted him as saying.

 He said they did not have any problem with their employer and got salaries on time. 

 ?When we came back from work, the room was locked and we could not open it from the outside as the key was inside . We called a carpenter to open the door and found Kumar hanging from the ceiling,? Babu said.

 69% injections unsafe: Govt

 New Delhi (PTI): The government on Friday 

 told the Rajya Sabha that a decision has been taken to introduce 

 ?auto-disable? syringes, which can be used only once, and 

 admitted that 69 per cent of the injections given at government 

 hospitals were unsafe.

 Quoting the draft report of a study funded by the World Bank, Union health minister A. Ramadoss said during question hour that 35 per cent of injections given at government hospitals were unsafe because of improper sterilisation while another 34 per cent were unsafe because of wrong injection habits of those administering them.

 ?In order to reduce unsafe injections, the government has taken a decision to introduce auto-disable syringes in all immunisation clinics and central government hospitals from 2005,? he said. Since this type of syringe can be used only once, it is better than the disposable one which can be reused.

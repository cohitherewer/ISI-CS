 Cong sniffs big brother push

 K. SUBRAHMANYA

 New Delhi, Nov. 10: The Congress considers Uma Bharti?s suspension from the BJP?s primary membership today as reflective of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh?s growing disenchantment with its political protege.

 Uma was known for her unpredictable behaviour, said AICC general secretary Digvijay Singh, but ?I am told she was in continuous discussion with (K.N.) Govindacharya and (S.) Gurumurthy (considered members of the RSS thinktank)?.

 ?I am also aware that after six years of the NDA government, the RSS is quite disappointed with the BJP. So Uma might have done it (question the BJP leadership) deliberately,? added Singh, who as chief minister was Uma?s arch rival and immediate predecessor in Madhya Pradesh.

 Singh was certain that Uma invited action from the L.K. Advani-led BJP leadership ? by challenging its authority in front of the media ? on prompting from ?hardline? RSS elements.

 But he did not elaborate. Some senior Congress leaders, however, referred to recent reports about sections of the Sangh parivar contemplating a new political outfit to draw a link between parivar hardliners and todays dramatic developments.

 Some ?middle-level RSS functionaries?, disillusioned with the BJP, were quietly wanting to know from Congress leaders why they were not open to interactions with the RSS, a senior Congress leader said.

 ?Our response was that the party could have no reservation in talking to the RSS if it gave up its divisive agenda,? the leader said.

 Congress leaders believe Uma may not be able to draw enough support from within the BJP to get RSS backing to float a new political outfit. They drew attention to the RSS?s silence on today?s developments even though Uma met the outfit?s brass here soon after her suspension.

 Congress media department chairperson Girija Vyas said the suspension showed that the BJP had become a ?directionless and leaderless party? after its successive poll defeats.

 Vyas likened the suspension to the Kauravas? open humiliation of Draupadi in the Mahabharata. The BJP leadership, she said, was ?scared? of another woman, this time from within its ranks. 

 Uma, she added in a veiled attack on the BJP?s attitude towards backward-class leaders, was the second such leader after Kalyan Singh to be shown the door.

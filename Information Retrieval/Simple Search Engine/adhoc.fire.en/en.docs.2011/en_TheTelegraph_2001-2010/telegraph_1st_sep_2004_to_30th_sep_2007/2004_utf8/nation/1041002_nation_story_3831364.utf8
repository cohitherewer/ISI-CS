 Bakery prosecutor

 Mumbai, Oct. 1: Special public prosecutor in the Best Bakery retrial P.R. Vakil passed away tonight following a heart ailment at Breach Candy Hospital, reports our special correspondent.

 The 81-year-old Vakil was admitted to the hospital on September 22, the day the retrial began. He was present in court on that day. 

 An angioplasty was performed on him the next day, hospital sources said.

 Activist Teesta Setalvad said the trial would not be affected by Vakil?s death as a second public prosecutor had been appointed along with him, who would now take charge.

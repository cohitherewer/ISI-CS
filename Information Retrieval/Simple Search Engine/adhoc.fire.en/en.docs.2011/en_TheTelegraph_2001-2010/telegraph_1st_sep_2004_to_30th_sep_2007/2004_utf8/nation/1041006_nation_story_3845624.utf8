 Left piles Israel heat

 New Delhi, Oct. 5: The CPI has criticised the United Progressive Alliance government for not taking a stand against Israel in the wake of continued attacks by its army on the Palestinian people, reports our special correspondent.

 ?The CPI calls upon the government to denounce the Israeli occupation and its renewed attacks. The government should demand an immediate withdrawal of the Israeli army from all parts of the Gaza strip,? the CPI said in a statement today.

 Since the UPA came to power, the CPI has been demanding that it take an active stand in favour of the Palestinian people unlike the previous regime, which had moved close to the Israeli government.

 ?It is unfortunate that the UPA government till now did not react to this development even though the CMP (common minimum programme) talks a lot about India?s support to the Palestinian cause,? the statement said.

 The Congress has asked the Left to restrain from attacking Union home minister Shivraj Patil on the spurt of violence in the Northeast. ?We would like to remind the Left that the home minister is a good socialist. The Left should keep this in mind before passing a judgement on him,? said Congress leader Salman Khursheed.

 The Left parties have been critical of the way Patil handled the Northeast crisis beginning with the spate of violence in Manipur. In fact, they have stopped just short of seeking his removal from the home ministry.

 Khursheed, however, defended the home minister and criticised Patil?s predecessor .K. Advani instead for trying to make political capital out of the crisis.

 ?We regret that the former home minister wants to sabotage every effort of this government to improve the situation,? said Khursheed. 

 ?It is easy to advocate the use of force. But we are not fighting an enemy. These are our own people who are cut up with us. And we want to bring them back to (the) mainstream,? he added.

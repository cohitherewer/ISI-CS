 Paedophile in net

 CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA

 Mumbai, Sept. 6: Allan Johan Water, a Briton wanted on charges of paedophilia, was extradited by the US and brought to the city this morning by Mumbai police.

 A two-member team from Colaba police station brought him from New Jersey after he was arrested by US police. A red-corner notice had been issued by Interpol on a request from Mumbai police. Deputy commissioner of police Nuval Bajaj said Water will be produced in court tomorrow.

 Water, who was on his way to Bermuda when he was arrested, has been wanted by Mumbai police for more than two years. India initiated an extradition process after the arrest and a Mumbai police team reached the US last week to take Waters custody. Along with fellow Briton Duncan Grant, Water faces several charges of child sexual abuse.

 Water and Grant are accused of sexually exploiting street children in a home for boys the two set up in Colaba in south Mumbai in 1995. The home, called Anchorage, was being run with generous funds from British sponsors.

 The two opened other shelters in Cuffe Parade and in a tourist getaway near Mumbai called Murud-Janjira in Raigad district.

 Grants activities first came into spotlight in August 2001 after the death of a boy in the Murud-Janjira shelter. In November 2001, following complaints from four boys, a case was registered by Colaba police. A number of the children said they were lured by Water and Grant with the hope of food and shelter and later sexually abused.

 The police booked them but both escaped the country. In 2002, Mumbai police routed through the CBI a red-corner notice request to the Interpol for Water and Grant.

 Grant seems to have evaded Mumbai police so far. After fleeing the country, he was spotted in Tanzania recently. He opened three shelters in Dar es Salaam and Bagomayo. He called them Anchorage, too, and arranged for money from British sponsors.

 Mumbai police said Tanzanian police arrested him last month after he was allegedly found involved in similar child sexual abuse. But getting Grant here to face the charges may not be easy, as India does not have an extradition treaty with Tanzania. 

 There were times when there would be 200 boys at the Colaba shelter. Grant and Water would arrange for visitors for the boys, usually elderly men, who would bring many gifts like toys, chocolates and watches, the boys alleged.

 According to recent media reports, paedophilia is rampant in India, especially in beach resorts like Goa and Kerala which attract foreigners.

 Colaba, where Water and Grant ran their shelter, is also a popular tourist attraction.

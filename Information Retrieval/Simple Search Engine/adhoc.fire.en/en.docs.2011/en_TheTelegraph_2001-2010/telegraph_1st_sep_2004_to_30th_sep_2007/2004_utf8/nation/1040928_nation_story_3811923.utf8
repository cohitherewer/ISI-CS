 Pakistan gurdwara probe

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Islamabad, Sept. 27: Officials 

 of the Evacuee Trust Board in Lahore have said they are 

 investigating Saturday?s alleged attack on the Nanakana 

 Sahib gurdwara by college students.

 The provincial education department had announced that Gurunanak Devji Degree College, which is located in the gurdwara complex on the outskirts of Lahore, would be demolished to facilitate the construction of a bigger complex for Sikh pilgrims. 

 Azhar Jaffari, a board official, said that ?according to an initial investigation report, a group of students (from the college) protested against the decision?, but they did not attack the gurdwara as was being propagated by the Sikh Sangat Committee.

 The committee, however, stuck to its stand. ?This attack is the first of its kind in the history of Pakistan,? Kalyan Singh, a member of the panel, said. 

 The incident would not have a negative impact on the ongoing talks process between Pakistan and India, he added.

 ?We respect Sikhs as members of an important Pakistani minority and the decision to demolish the college was taken to expand the gurdwara complex to accommodate more than 6,000 Sikh pilgrims who visit Pakistan from all over the world to attend the annual religious festival,? Jaffari said.

 The gurdwara is the birthplace of Guru Nanak.

 He said the plan, approved by chief minister of Punjab province Pervaiz Elahi, envisages the construction of a modern complex and a railway station near the shrine. 

 A government handout said Elahi has taken serious notice of the incident and directed the inspector-general of police to immediately launch a probe.

 Sikh leaders in Delhi deplored the alleged attack and demanded that the local government take immediate action, adds PTI.

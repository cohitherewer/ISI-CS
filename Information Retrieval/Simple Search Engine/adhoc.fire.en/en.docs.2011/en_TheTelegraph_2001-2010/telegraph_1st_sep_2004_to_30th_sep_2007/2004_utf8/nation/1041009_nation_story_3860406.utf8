 Gandhi institute row

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 8: The human resource development ministry has ordered a probe into the way the Indian Council of Social Science Research (ICSSR) has handled the revival of the Varanasi-based Gandhian Institute of Studies.

 The ministry has also decided to restore central aid to the institute, which had been stopped by the previous National Democratic Alliance government.

 S. Sathyam, a former secretary at the Union government, will head the probe.

 The Gandhian Institute, founded by Jai Prakash Narayan, is one of the social science research institutions the ICSSR funds and supports on the Centre?s behalf.

 Sathyam will be allowed access to all material relating to ICSSR and the Gandhian Institute.

 ?He has been asked to identify the lapses, if any, on the part of individuals or group of individuals affecting the normal functioning of GIS,? the ministry said.

 Ministry officials say the former human resource development minister, Murli Manohar Joshi, wanted to shift the focus of research from Gandhian thought to Deen Dayal Upadhyaya and V.D. Savarkar.

 When the institute resisted, Joshi tried to squeeze it out of funds ? from the time it was set up, the Gandhian Institute has run on equal grants from the Centre and the Uttar Pradesh government.

 ?The ICSSR stopped the grants to the institute with effect from August 29, 1999 on basis of directives issued by the HRD ministry,? a ministry note said.

 The BJP government ruling Uttar Pradesh at the time also stopped its share of grants. The institute was officially shut down last year.

 After taking charge of the ministry, Arjun Singh had summoned a meeting of officials with the Gandhian Institute. Singh had withdrawn the directive to stop grants and authorised the ICSSR to release the central share of grants, totalling Rs 22 lakh, to the institute last July.

 The ministry is now co-ordinating with the Mulayam Singh Yadav-government in Uttar Pradesh to release the state?s share of funds.

 Singh is set to order another inquiry into the functioning of the Shimla-based Indian Institute of Advanced Studies, which was in the eye of a storm during Joshi?s tenure as minister.

 Census probe 

 Rae Bareli, Sept. 16 (PTI): Congress president Sonia Gandhi today said the government would investigate if there was any goof-up in the release of census figures.

 ?Is report ko kendriya sarkar dekhegi, garbad hui hai ki nahin, iski jaanch hogi (the Centre will look into the census report and inquiry will be held if any discrepancy is found),? she said. The announcement comes in the wake of a controversial analysis of Muslim growth rate.

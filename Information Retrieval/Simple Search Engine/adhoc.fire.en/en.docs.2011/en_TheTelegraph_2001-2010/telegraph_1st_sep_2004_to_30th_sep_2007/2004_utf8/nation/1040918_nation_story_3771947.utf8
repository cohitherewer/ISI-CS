The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Zee, rival in same boat

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Sept. 17: Bombay High Court today said that if BCCI?s criteria for bidding for cricket telecast rights were strictly adhered to, neither Zee Telefilms nor ESPN-Star Sports would be eligible.

 Hearing the argument of Zee, whose eligibility has been challenged by ESPN after Zee was declared the highest bidder by the BCCI for telecast rights for four years of all cricket matches played in India, the court said that if Zee?s argument was accepted, none of the two channels would be eligible.

 The observation came when Zee counsel Harish Salve countered the ESPN argument that Zee did not have the required experience of two years of telecasting matches of international standard and did not have its own production unit for live telecast.

 Salve said ESPN hired its facilities, too. He said that like ESPN, Zee would also hire production professionals and equipment.

 In about two years of telecast experience, Salve said ESPN has produced only one series exclusively ? which did not fulfil the required minimum two-year experience criterion.

 A Zee spokesperson later said if individual production units were a criterion, no broadcaster in India would be eligible, because all channels used rented production facilities.

 Salve also presented the court with a list of international matches Zee has broadcast in the last two years.

 The court, however, said the word production was conspicuously missing in the documents submitted by Zee. The court also said Zee?s letter to the BCCI says what it will do in the future and not what they have done in the past.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Negotiators savour Bangkok bonhomie

 BHARAT BHUSHAN

 Thuingaleng Muivah

 Bangkok, Oct. 24: Thuingaleng Muivah dressed in a conservative dark blue suit and deep red tie sat quietly next to K. Padmanabhaiah, the chief Indian negotiator for the Naga peace talks, in a restaurant of Hotel Intercontinental in the Thai capital. 

 Padmanabahaiah was trying to order a soup for Muivah at the formal lunch he had hosted for the two delegations. 

 As Muivah and Padmanabhaiah nostalgically recalled a particularly good lunch they had had together at an earlier occasion, glancing at Muivah?s plate one could see that his interest in food was largely theoretical. 

 Muivah, like his colleagues of the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isak-Muivah), is an extremely frugal eater. A bowl of soup and some rice in the morning and he can go on for the whole day on endless of cups of hot tea. Today, it was a celebratory lunch so besides a bowl of soup he had also taken a chapatti and a small piece of chicken.

 ?You even have chapattis?? a surprised member of the Indian delegation asked him. ?Sometimes I like eating one,? Muivah replied with smile.

 Earlier, while coming down for lunch Muivah was heard confessing to one of his assistants, ?You know when I was young I used to love sweets. But Indian sweets have too much sugar. I particularly liked rasogollas. I was so fond of them that you might even find them mentioned in some of the NSCN literature.?

 Muivah had reason to be happy. The final meeting between the negotiators from the two sides on Saturday morning had gone exceptionally well. There was such a meeting of minds that someone commented, ?this was perhaps the fastest round of talks since the ceasefire began? seven years ago.

 Isak Chisi Swu 

The thirty-second floor Club Lounge of Intercontinental Hotel had never seen so many Nagas trooping out of a small conference hall as it did on Saturday. Ten leaders of the NSCN and three Indian negotiators had been closeted for about 45 minutes when they took a coffee break to draft a joint statement.

 N. C. Padhi, additional director 

 in the Intelligence Bureau and Ajit Lal, joint director 

 in the same organisation, represented India besides Padmanabhaiah.

 The Naga delegation besides Muivah consisted of V.S. Atem (emissary of the collective leadership), Ghevehe Chisi Swu (acting chairman of the NSCN?s steering committee), Puni Mao (senior member of the steering committee), Q. Tuccu (the ?finance minister? of the underground Naga government), Angnaikham Makunga (?minister for arts and culture?), Tongmeth Konyak (?minister for education?), Meren Nokpu (?deputy finance minister?), Imcha Longkumer (deputy secretary of the NSCN) and Raylung Nsarangbe (assistant to Muivah). The chairman of NSCN, Isak Chisi Swu was held up in the Philippines and could not be present in Bangkok.

 This was the third meeting of the two delegations since the talks began formally on Friday. The first day?s talks had ended with the Indian representative to the peace talks Padmanabhaiah handing over a formal letter of invitation from the government to Thuingaleng Muivah to visit India. 

 After the brief coffee break, the two delegations met again for about 10 minutes and released a simple and clear joint statement.

 The statement said: ?Taking into account the progress in the talks till now and in order to give further impetus to the same, the Representative of the Government of India invited the NSCN (I-M) leadership to visit India. Thanking the Government of India for the invitation, the NSCN (I-M) leadership responded that they accepted the invitation as yet another indication of Indias commitment to find an early, peaceful and mutually satisfactory solution.?

 The statement also noted, ?Both the delegations strongly condemned the barbaric and inhuman killing of innocent civilians, by bomb blasts, on October 2 in Dimapur. They particularly regretted the choice of October 2, the anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi?s birthday, for the despicable act.?

 In condemning the Dimapur blasts formally, the NSCN set itself apart from all those insurgent groups in India?s northeast who think nothing of targeting civilians indiscriminately. 

 The NSCN is the only insurgent group from India that refuses to use landmines as they can kill civilians. 

 ?Why should we want to kill our own people or other civilians nothing to do with the Naga issue?? one of them said.

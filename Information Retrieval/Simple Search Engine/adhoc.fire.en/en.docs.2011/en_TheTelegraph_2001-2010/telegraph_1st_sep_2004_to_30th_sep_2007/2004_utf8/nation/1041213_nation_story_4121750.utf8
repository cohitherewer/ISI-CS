 Aamir?s bat mints millions

 Islamabad, Dec. 12 (PTI): The cricket bat used by Aamir Khan to hit the winning six in Oscar-nominated Lagaan has fetched Rs 6 million at an auction in Lahore.

 The auction was held at a fundraising dinner last night to mobilise funds for former Pakistan cricketer Imran Khan?s cancer hospital. 

 The bat was bought by Ali Imran, a residential complex builder of Pakistan?s Bahria town. 

 The actor is currently touring the country to raise funds for the hospital.

 Aamir said he had kept the bat as a souvenir of his film but chose to bring it to the auction in Pakistan to raise funds for the hospital in Lahore, built in memory of Imran?s mother Shaukat Khanum. 

 Imran is planning to build another such hospital in Karachi. 

 Later, the former Pakistan skipper announced that the money raised during the dinner would be spent to treat poor patients, local daily Dawn said in a report. 

 Aamir, who arrived in Lahore on Friday, said his visit to Pakistan was a memorable one as he had been shown great respect and love. 

 The actor said that he was lucky that he had come to Pakistan to participate in the noble cause of helping the poor. 

 Aamir also appeared on a three-hour live programme on a local channel along with Imran. 

 The actor said he was passionate about campaigning for cancer as one of his sisters, living in Karachi, had died of it.

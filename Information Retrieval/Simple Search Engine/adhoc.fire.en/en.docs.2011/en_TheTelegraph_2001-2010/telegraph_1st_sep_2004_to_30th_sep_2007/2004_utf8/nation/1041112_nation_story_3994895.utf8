 Repoll blow to Mulayam

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Nov. 11: The Election Commission today ordered fresh polls in the Mainpuri Lok Sabha constituency where all Opposition parties had alleged that Samajwadi Party workers had captured booths and threatened voters to ensure their candidate?s victory in the October 13 byelection.

 Two persons died as rival groups clashed during the bypoll, necessitated after Mulayam Singh Yadav resigned to stay on as Uttar Pradesh chief minister.

 Mulayam Singh ? who was in Saifai, Etawah ? went into a huddle with senior leaders on learning of the order.

 In Mainpuri, about 45 km away, Congress, Bahujan Samaj Party and BJP workers burst crackers. Congress spokesman Akhilesh Singh said the order had vindicated his party?s allegations that Samajwadi workers rigged the polls to ensure victory for Mulayam Singh?s cousin Dharmendra Yadav.

 On October 18, a three-member team from the poll panel had visited the constituency. Today, the commission said the probe had revealed ?a shocking state of affairs where, in more than 70 per cent of the polling stations, the polling personnel either connived or were overawed by one party or the other to rig the poll in their favour?.

 The panel said the report also brought out the ?complete bias? on the part of the police and district administration.

 Samajwadi sources blamed ?some Congress ministers and a section of bureaucrats at the Centre?. The party, they said, would play up the ?conspiracy angle to the countermanding? during the campaign for the December 20 repoll.

 ?The order of the Election Commission is an insult to the wishes of the voters. The voters of the constituency will give a fitting reply,? Mulayam Singh said in Etawah. ?We will go to the people on how the Congress conspired to order a repoll.?

 Samajwadi sources said Mulayam Singh would visit Mainpuri on Saturday to talk to boost the morale of polling agents.

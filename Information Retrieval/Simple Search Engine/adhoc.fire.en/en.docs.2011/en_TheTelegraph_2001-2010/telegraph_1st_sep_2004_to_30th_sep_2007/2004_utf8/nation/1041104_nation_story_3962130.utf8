 Delhi mourns with UAE

 PRANAY SHARMA

 New Delhi, Nov. 3: India today sent a high-level delegation led by President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam to condole the death of President Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahayan, signalling the importance Delhi attaches to the United Arab Emirates.

 The team ? including junior foreign minister E. Ahmed, minister of state in the Prime Minister?s Office Prithiviraj Chavan and senior South Block officials ? reached the UAE in the evening. It missed the special prayer meeting but was present at the burial.

 The decision to send Kalam at short notice clearly shows the UAE?s importance to Delhi because normally the vice-president or a senior minister leads an Indian condolence team when a head of state or an important world leader dies.

 The UAE is not only India?s second largest trading partner but also home to 1.2 million Indian workers.

 The Centre has declared official mourning for three days from tomorrow when flags will fly at half-mast at all government buildings.

 ?The UAE has lost its father figure, the Arab world a great visionary and an elder statesman, and India a highly cherished friend,? Kalam said. He could not meet an indisposed Sheikh Zayed when he visited Abu Dhabi last year.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh recalled Sheikh Zayed?s efforts in strengthening the emirates? education and protecting its environment and his ?progressive modernisation?. Singh described the UAE leader?s emphasis on consensus-building and his inclusive approach as ?exemplary and worthy of emulation?.

 Sheikh Zayed was a committed friend of India who deported ?ring leaders? of anti-India protests following the Babri mosque demolition, allocated a cremation ground for Hindus and sent clam-up or clear-out signals to anti-India elements following an extradition treaty.

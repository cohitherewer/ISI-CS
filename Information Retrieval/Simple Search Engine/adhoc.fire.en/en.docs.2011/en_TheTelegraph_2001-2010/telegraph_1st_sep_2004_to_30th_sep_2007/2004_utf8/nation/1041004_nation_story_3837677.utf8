 Indian faked death for insurance money

 AMIT ROY

 London, Oct. 3: An Indian businessman has begun a 15-month jail sentence after being convicted of faking his own death while on a trip to India, so that his wife back in England could cash in three life insurance policies worth a total of ?323,788.

 But the company, which was being asked to pay the biggest sum ? ?287,000 ? became suspicious, sent investigators to India and discovered that Pritpal Kaila, 45, a former market trader, has paid Rs 20,000 (about ?285) to obtain a forged death certificate.

 Kaila even persuaded a friend in India to telephone his wife, Karamjit, at her home in Scunthorpe, express deep sorrow at his passing and provide details of his cremation. 

 Convinced her husband really had died, Kaila?s wife put in claims to collect insurance policies worth ?287,000 from Century Life, ?30,000 from Scottish Amicable and ?6,788 from Scottish Widows. 

 While the two smaller sums were paid, the biggest handout was held back while investigations were carried out by agents from Century Life.

 Kaila?s tale unfolded at Grimbsy Crown Court where he admitted seven counts of dishonesty.

 Kaila, who lived in London, had separated from his wife in 1994 but he did make the effort periodically to travel to Scunthorpe to see her. The court was told he became fed up of his old life of supporting his wife and his son at university and desired to break with the past. 

 Prosecutor Tony Stevenson told the court that in March 2001, Kaila went to India, where he hatched the plan to fake his own death. He handed over Rs 20,000 for the forged documents, which he sent to his wife at her marital home in Scunthorpe. 

 She also received a phone call from one of Kaila?s friends, who told her that her husband had died from a heart attack and that a cremation had been held.

 The court heard that Kaila stayed in California for a while but eventually returned to the UK and confessed to his crime. Stevenson said the two smaller claims had since been repaid by Kaila?s wife, who had recently sold her home.

 Nicholas Neale, for Kaila, said his client had never been in trouble with the law previously. Kaila had found himself under pressure for money from his family ?and took this somewhat bizarre course to rectify it?.

 Neale said: ?He was trying to wash away the pressure of his life and start again, like shedding his skin and beginning as a new person.?

 Kaila admitted he had been ?crazy? to attempt the deception and would not try it again, according to Neale.

 The three insurance companies are seeking to recover Pound11,000 in legal costs in the case, but the judge said it would not be appropriate to impose a financial penalty in addition to a jail sentence.

 Recorder Stuart Brown QC told Kaila: ?This was a serious matter. The sums of money involved were substantial and there was a degree of sophistication. It was an offence so serious that only a custodial penalty is appropriate.?

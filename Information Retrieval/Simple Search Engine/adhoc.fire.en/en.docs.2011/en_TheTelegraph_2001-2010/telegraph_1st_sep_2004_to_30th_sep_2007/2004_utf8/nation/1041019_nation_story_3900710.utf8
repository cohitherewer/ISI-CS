 Hrithik amp; Amisha: 

 Boost from Bollywood 

 Mumbai, Oct. 18: It pays to script in New Zealand in the films.

 New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark, on a four-day tour of India aimed at ?strengthening business and cultural ties? between the two countries, took time out in Mumbai to personally thank actors Hrithik Roshan and Amisha Patel and Hrithik?s producer-director father Rakesh Roshan for their ?contribution? to the land of the Kiwis.

 At a dignified ceremony held at a five-star hotel here, Clark presented each of the three with a letter, a jade pendant and the observation that Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai, the Roshan production in which Hrithik and Amisha debuted, was very special for her country.

 Roshan?s contribution lay in the fact that New Zealand was mentioned as New Zealand and not as any other romantic destination with an Indian name, said Clark. It helped increase the country?s popularity among Indians, she added.

 Clark said the film had also encouraged Indian tourists to visit her country. Prior to the film, about 3,000 Indians would visit annually, but currently the figure is between 16,000 and 18,000.

 It was not the first time that a Hindi film was being shot in New Zealand, but Kaho Naa? encouraged the shooting of films there in a big way. Over 100 Bollywood productions have been filmed in the country since 1995, a bulk of them since 2000, the year Kaho Naa? was released.

 There is another major area in which Indians contribute to New Zealand?s economy: an estimated 2,500 Indians are there as students.

 Today?s event was attended by the New Zealand high commissioner and trade commissioner. The Roshans and Amisha thanked the Prime Minister.

 Clark went in for a hard-sell of her country as a film destination ? and as a hub for other industries.

 ?Business and cultural relations between India and New Zealand will continue to grow strongly,? said the Prime Minister. 

 ?In many areas ? from film to software development and biotechnology ? New Zealand businesses are exceeding international benchmarks,? she said.

 Clark listed the reasons why filmmakers from abroad should look at New Zealand for shoots. As well as being home to a ?superb line-up of technology companies? and a ?dynamic local film industry?, New Zealand also offers a host of natural advantages for overseas film, television and commercial productions, she said.

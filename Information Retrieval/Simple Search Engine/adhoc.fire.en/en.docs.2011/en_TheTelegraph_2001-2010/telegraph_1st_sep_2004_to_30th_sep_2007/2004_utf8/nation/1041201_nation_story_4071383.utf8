 BJP dares Laloo on Paswan

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Nov. 30: The BJP today dared railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav to raise the corruption charges he has levelled against Ram Vilas Paswan before the Union Cabinet and get a CBI probe ordered into the matter.

 Laloo Prasad recently alleged that his LJP counterpart, as railway minister during 1996-97, had been involved in dubious deals worth Rs 800 crore. Paswan was accused of stashing away the money in a Swiss bank.

 The Lok Janshakti Party president has described the allegations as baseless, daring Laloo Prasad to order an investigation, and promising to quit politics if he was proved found guilty of swindling.

 BJP vice-president Sushil Kumar Modi said the trading of serious charges between two ministers of the same government was ?unprecedented? and the spat violated the oath of secrecy taken by Laloo Prasad.

 Former Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said Prime Minister Manmohan Singh should make a statement on the matter, which was the ?first of its kind since Independence?.

 Attacking Paswan as well as the state government, Modi said Bihar faces a fertiliser crisis at present. ?DAP fertiliser, which costs Rs 510 a bag, is being sold in the black market at Rs 600. A bag of MPK fertiliser is being sold for Rs 550 while the actual price is Rs 450. There is no supply of urea in Bihar because the state government has failed to issue the sales tax certificate, which is mandatory for providing subsidies. Urea is being smuggled from Uttar Pradesh,? he added.

 Modi said no anti-RJD alliance could replace the Rabri Devi government unless the BJP was apart of it. ?Parties opposed to the RJD have contested the elections on their own since 1995 but registered little success. We appeal to all parties, especially the LJP, to join hands unconditionally and form an anti-RJD coalition in Bihar. This is necessary to defeat Laloo Prasad,? he added.

 Former Union minister Shahnawaz Hussain said ignoring the BJP would only make the RJD stronger. ?Communalism is not an issue in Bihar. Local issues will matter in the Assembly elections and we are determined to raise only such matters. The minorities too are feeling cheated under the RJD misrule,? he said.

 Modi said his party is busy making preparations for the Patna rally on December 2. Party president L.K. Advani and former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee are likely to attend it.

 ?The rally will be a show of our strength and an assertion of the fact that the BJP cannot be ignored in any anti-RJD alliance,? he added.

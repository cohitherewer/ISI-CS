 Suicide plea in court

 Ahmedabad, Oct. 20: An accused lodged in the Sabarmati central jail has sought permission from the city sessions court to commit suicide, reports our correspondent.

 Ashwin Shah, 46, has filed an application with city sessions judge Sonia Gokani, seeking the permission because he is fed up with life due to his heart ailment and his inability to get a bypass surgery done.

 Arrested on charges of forgery and cheating, Shah had been trying to get bail to undergo the surgery. But his bail plea has not proceeded since his arrest 23 months ago, said Sudhir Brahmbhatt, a senior advocate.

 Shah has pleaded in his application to be either released on bail so that he can undergo treatment or be allowed to commit suicide. The court has taken note of the unusual request.

 Attempting suicide is punishable with life imprisonment under the IPC. 

 Public prosecutor H.M. Dhruv said Shah?s plea to commit suicide is a serious offence and a case should be registered against him. It amounts to blackmailing the jail authorities and thus calls for an inquiry, he added.

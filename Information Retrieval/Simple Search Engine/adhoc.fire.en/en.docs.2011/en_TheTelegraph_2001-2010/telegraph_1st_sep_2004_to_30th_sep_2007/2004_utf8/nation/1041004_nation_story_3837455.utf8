 Greetings of death before birth

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Ahmedabad, Oct 3: Greetings 

 like ?Jai Shri Krishna? or ?Jai Matadi? can mean the difference 

 between life and death for an unborn baby in Ahmedabad.

 This, said a speaker at a recent advocacy workshop on sex selection and pre-birth elimination of females, is the ?code language? some city doctors use to indicate the sex of a foetus.

 The message comes for Rs 2,000-5,000, and some more for the abortion, and is so effective that not a single doctor guilty of the practice has been caught, said Illa Vakharia, programme officer of the Centre for Health Education, Training and Nutrition Awareness (Chetna).

 The price is little disincentive for parents fixated on having a son -- or not wanting a second girl child -- so that the practice is particularly rampant in Gujarat, especially in Mehsana district.

 The Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Technique (Prohibition of Sex Selection) Act was meant to impose a legal ban on sex determination of an unborn child.

 The law allows pre-natal diagnostic tests only on medical grounds to detect abnormalities and to carry out abortions if the foetus or the mother is at risk.

 This very provision is misused in most cases to terminate female foetuses, said Dr Rajshree of Ahmedabad-based Chetna, an NGO that organised the workshop.

 The child sex ratio (0 to 6 years of age) in the state has declined alarmingly in the last decade because of the illegal practice, said speakers at the workshop.

 The figures, they said, speak for themselves. The ratio of 928 girls to 1,000 boys in 1991 has fallen to 883 to 1,000 in 2001 -- well below the national average of 927 -- according to a report of the directorate of census operations in Gujarat.

 At 45 points (the difference between 928 and 883), Gujarat is among the states that have seen a huge decline in the child sex ratio in a decade. Punjab tops the list with 77 points and Ahmedabad district alone shows 82 points.

 Mehsana district at 98 points has recorded the steepest fall in child sex ratio (801 girls to 1,000 boys now). The situation is such that people there spend an estimated Rs 5 crore on buying brides each year from outside their community, Vakharia claimed.

 Not so long ago, hoardings in Punjab would lure would-be parents by asking them to ?spend Rs 2,000 to save Rs 2 lakh?, a reference to saving dowry by aborting the girl child.

 Times have changed but not the practice. ?Though such open advertisements by unscrupulous clinics have been stopped as pre-natal sex determination has been made a culpable offence, there is little perceptible decrease in female foeticide,? said Chetna director Indu Capoor.

 The NGO estimates that nearly 6 million abortions are performed every year in the country.

 The Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (Regulation and Misuse) Act was enacted in 1994 and came into effect from January 1, 1996.

 But certain inadequacies and practical difficulties in its implementation came to the government?s notice. As a result, the act was amended on February 14, 2003, thus coming to be known as the Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Technique (Prohibition of Sex Selection) Act.

 This, however, has been no dampener on the craving for a son in a patriarchal society that thinks a boy would be an old-age support and continue the lineage.

 ?Besides, there is a mindset that sons are important as many religious functions can be performed by them,? said Capoor. She believes female foeticide will end only with a more effective implementation of the law and a change in the social mindset.

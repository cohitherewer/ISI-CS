The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Antony out of power, but not out of favour 

 K. SUBRAHMANYA

 New Delhi, Aug. 31: A.K. Antonys exit as Kerala chief minister is unlikely to be the end of the road for him.

 The Congress Mr Clean continues to enjoy the trust and confidence of Congress chief Sonia Gandhi even though she asked him to make way for Oommen Chandy.

 AICC leaders are quite sure that Sonia will bring Antony to the party headquarters to shoulder organisational responsibilities at the first opportunity.

 That she has confidence in Antony is borne out by the fact that among a dozen Congress chief ministers, he is the only one who continued to have a place in the party working committee after the organisational reshuffle that Sonia Gandhi carried out a few weeks ago, a party leader said.

 Ahmed Patel, Sonias political secretary and working committee member in charge of Kerala, has dropped enough hints that Antony could make a comeback to national politics after nearly 10 years. The former chief minister was briefly a party treasurer under P.V. Narasimha Rao while holding charge as a Union minister.

 A few months after he quit as Union minister in late 1994, Antony returned to Kerala to take over as chief minister from his arch-rival K. Karunakaran. Ironically, Chandy, who succeeded Antony this morning, orchestrated Karunakarans replacement with the latter in April 1995.

 There is no slot vacant at the AICC at present, but party leaders reckon the Congress chief might entrust Antony organisational responsibilities in his capacity as a working committee member. It is pointed out that over the last one year, Sonia has opted to give organisational responsibilities to working committee members without formally making them a member of her team of AICC office bearers.

 Antonys rehabilitation in Delhi may be on the cards, but he is unlikely to find a place in Parliament. Rajya Sabha elections are not due in Kerala for 18 months and two of the three Upper House MPs Karunakaran and former AICC general secretary Vayalar Ravi are unlikely to make way for him. If Antony is to enter the Rajya Sabha, only state Congress chief Tennala Balakrishna Pillai can make way for him.

 Teething troubles

 Chandy, 61, who took over as Keralas 19th chief minister today, is already facing the strains of running a rickety coalition for the 21 months that remain in the United Democratic Fronts term, adds our special correspondent from Thiruvanthapuram .

 Chandy, the first Jacobite chief minister in the state, was sworn in along with four of the seven non-Congress UDF partners. The ones to miss out were the Kerala Congress-Jacob, Kerala Congress-B and the RSP-B, the latter splitting a few hours before the swearing-in.

 Governor R.. Bhatia administered the oath of office to Chandy, the Indian Union Muslim Leagues P.K. Kunhalikutty, Kerala Congress-Ms K.M. Mani, K.R. Gowry of the Janadhipatya Samrakshana Samiti and the Communist Marxist Partys M.V. Raghavan.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Easts sunshine state

 Think poverty and Kalahandi springs to mind. Tomorrow that same Kalahandi could become the countrys aluminium capital.

 Mulayam Singh Yadav is collecting all the big names Amitabh Bachchan and Anil Ambani, to name but two to promote his state.

 Farther east from Uttar Pradesh, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is initiating what is grandly called an industrial renaissance on the back of some call-centre jobs.

 All the action is, however, to the south of Bengal. But Naveen Patnaik may have little to do with the thousands of crores heading towards Orissa.

 When money talks, chief ministers dont need to open their mouths. And money is talking Orissa.

 Rich in minerals, industrialisation for some odd reason had passed the state by. Among the countrys poorest states, it has a per capita income of Rs 10,234, way below the national average of Rs 17,947.

 But 2004 could well turn out to be the year Orissa the land of the nations most famous sun temple at Konark begins its journey out of the darkness of decades of deprivation.

 Its also the year of steel, on whose foundations the structure of a different future for the state will rise. International steel prices have gone up by 66 per cent on the strength of soaring demand in China, fuelled by an expanding economy as well requirements for the Beijing Olympic Games of 2008.

 Prices show a stunning rise in India, too.

 Orissas unfolding story alas, theres no . Chandrababu Naidu to sell it boggles the mind. Some Rs 50,000 crore of investments are proposed to be made in steel. If these come through, by 2007-08, Orissa could be Indias steel capital.

 The response is surely market-driven as the demand for steel is strong. The demand would remain strong for another 10-15 years, says Don Carroll, country president of BHP Billiton, which plans to set up a 10-million-tonne integrated steel plant at Duburi with South Korean giant Posco.

 The names that are stamping their presence in Orissa belong to the A-team of global industry. Tata Steel, after an abortive attempt earlier, is moving in too its chosen destination again is Duburi in Jajpur district because of its proximity to iron ore sources. 

 Large projects that will come up will create their own infrastructure. For instance, BHP-Posco is investing Rs 39,000 crore, which includes the cost of power plants.

 The rush is such it blows away the belief that industry will not invest if the infrastructure does not exist. 

 Last month, when Tata Steel decided to build a steel plant at a cost of Rs 15,000 crore, its managing director B. Muthuraman said: We have applied for land and this time we want to develop our own infrastructure.

 The context for the words this time is the failed attempt at Gopalpur earlier to build a steel plant. In 1997, the Tatas had acquired land but shelved the project because of the slow pace of development of Gopalpur port and a resistance movement by the local people.The company will not only develop a port on its own at Dhamra but also lay a railway line to it. 

 For a mineral-based company, Orissa is now the best place to be, says a senior official of Tata Steel in Bhubaneswar. 

 The role of the state in the investment spurt is a decision to offer mining lease only to companies that invest in a steel plant. A company will get a mining lease only after 50 per cent of the proposed investment is already grounded, said Padmanabha Behera, the minister for steel and mines.

 Some 11 projects are lined up for Duburi where land is cheap and which is connected by road and rail to Paradip port. 

 At Paradip, Indian Oil is investing Rs 20,000 crore in a petrochemical complex in another example of the huge dimensions of projects that are being planned for Orissa.

 Investments of such size generate high-voltage economic activity not only within them but around, too, creating business opportunities and employment.

 At a capacity of 4 million tonnes, Tata Steel employs over 40,000 people. In Orissa, it is putting up a 6-million-tonne plant.

 I have every reason to be optimistic about Orissa. All that it needs to do is to grab the chances coming its way with both its hands, says Carroll of BHP.

 The Australian companys optimism is such that it is investing in a second project, this one in Kalahandi. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee please note image is not a handicap when business considerations are overriding. BHP is setting up an alumina plant in association with Sulakshna Mines and Minerals at a cost of Rs 4,000 crore. 

 Vedanta Resources Plc, the London-listed company of the Sterlite group, is spending a similar amount on an alumina project also in Kalahandi.

 We will not miss the bus this time, says Behera.

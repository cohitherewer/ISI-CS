The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Last step before PWG talks 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, Sept. 3: A final round of discussions between the Andhra Pradesh government, coordination committee members and emissaries of the Peoples War Group and Janashakti has been scheduled for next Friday.

 A final pitch is expected to be made to settle differences between the government and Naxalite representatives on the modalities of the ceasefire and pave the way for a fruitful dialogue.

 Announcing this today, home minister K. Jana Reddy denied the Naxalite accusation that ulterior motives had prompted its rigidity on clause seven of the ceasefire pact with the PWG.

 The Congress government amended clause seven to say the extremists should not carry arms when conducting political campaigns in villages. The PWG countered by saying: Our movement and our philosophy cannot survive without arms. However, we assure the government that we will not use the weapons against either the police or the people.

 Reddy told a Janashakti and PWG delegation that the Congress is still bound to its pre-poll commitment to hold talks with the extremist group to end violence in rural Andhra.

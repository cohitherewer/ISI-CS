The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Army chief set for delayed Manipur trip

 SUJAN DUTTA

 N.C. Vij: On Northeast recce 

New Delhi, Sept. 1: The army chief, General 

N.C. Vij, is scheduled to visit Manipur and formations in the Northeast over two 

days from tomorrow in the wake of a wave of protests against the alleged assault 

on and killing of Thangjam Manorama. 

 The army has also sent the blood samples of 33 Assam Rifles personnel from its 17th battalion who were in the patrolling party that had taken Manorama into custody to the Central Forensic Science Laboratory in Calcutta for DNA testing. This measure was taken after a second forensic report was said to have found evidence of a sexual assault on the woman who the army insists was a corporal in an underground outfit, the PLA.

 General Vij was slated to visit last month but it was rescheduled after the public outcry in Manipur. 

 The army chiefs visit will be followed by the visit of the Union home minister, Shivraj Patil, on September 5. Even if the outrage in Manipur has now morphed into a movement to demand the withdrawal of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, the army has firmly put its foot down against any such move.

 The army and the defence ministry have advised the security establishment that such a step will leave the security grid in the Northeast toothless. At least one former army chief, General A.S. Malik, recalled in an article today that he had threatened to withdraw the army from Manipur when a chief minister had suggested to him several years ago that the act should be withdrawn.

 The army chief is the first high-ranking dignitary from the Centre to visit Manipur partly on a mission to check out first-hand the impact of the protests in Manipur. He would also be visiting Nagaland for a briefing in the headquarters of the 3 Corps in Dimapur. Sources in the army headquarters said the chief will not receive deputations or memoranda from the protesters.

 General Vijs schedule in the Northeast is not being publicly disclosed. As a routine, the army chief visits areas in the Northeast and in Jammu and Kashmir at least once a month. But since the protests against the Assam Rifles, the paramilitary force officered by the army that is in the eye of the storm, the general was advised against visiting Manipur last month after having first made up his mind to do so.

 Headquarters sources said the blood samples of the entire patrol party was a voluntary step taken by the army to clear itself of the taint. Our priority is to ensure prompt action if required, a source said. During his visit, the army chief will seek to transmit this message.

 Despite the pressures on the Assam Rifles, the sources described General Vijs visit as a routine visit to an operational area. Three months ago, the army had also relocated its 44 Mountain Brigade to southern Manipur in a move that was seen as a precursor to an operation against insurgents near the Myanmar-Manipur border.

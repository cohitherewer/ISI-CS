 Census for elephants

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Sukna, Dec. 2: The West Bengal forest department?s ?tentative? elephant census plan is enough to keep tour operators, still fuming over the last-minute booking cancellation during the November census, on tenterhooks.

 The department?s plan was announced at a news conference which, many feel, was called to put to rest the controversies and bad blood the November animal census generated.

 ?Tourism is a priority, but not greater than protection and conservation of forests and wildlife,? the divisional forest officer (wildlife I) Raju Das said at today?s meet, hinting at the protests that greeted their decision of cancelling bookings to forest bungalows last time.

 Private tour operators? associations had raised a protest for not informing them of the decision in advance and closing the national parks and sanctuaries from as early as November 15 for the census which began with only five days of prior notice.

 But if the details given at the meet are any indication, the tour operators would do well to expect a rerun of the cancellation of bookings.

 ?We cannot fix the dates or plan the census before receiving funds from the Centre,? said Das. ?We have tentatively slated the census for February, but it could be conducted any time before April depending on when the funds are released.?

 Rajeev Sharma and Kalyan Das, the divisional forest officers of wildlife-II and Cooch Behar ranges, also addressed the meet.

 Explaining the limitations that caused the problems during last month?s census, Sharma said: ?Funds for the census came at the end of October. We could not delay the count as winter snow would stall census work in Neora Valley National Park.?

 ?We have an elephant census slated for February, and if we do not use the funds by March, we will have had to return them. It was the same reason that prompted us to conduct the animal census in in November itself.?

 Naxalite scare in poll states

 ALOKE TIKKU 

 New Delhi, Dec. 11: The Union home ministry is concerned about reports hinting at the possibility of clashes between groups of the Maoist Communist Centre and the People?s War in election-bound Bihar and Jharkhand. 

 The two Naxalite outfits merged to form the Communist Party of India (Maoist) this September, ending a ?tortuous? exercise spanning two decades to unite the factions that have often been at war. 

 The merger, kept under wraps for a month, included unification of the guerrilla groups of the two outfits into the People?s Liberation Guerrilla Army. 

 But home ministry officials suggest that the merger of the foot soldiers ? that was to lay the foundation for a ?full-fledged People?s Liberation Army? ? was nowhere near completion, largely due to friction resulting from conflicting interests of local commanders. 

 They said clashes between the MCC and the PW have never been isolated incidents. Undivided Bihar saw a series of attacks and retaliatory strikes since violence between the two outfits intensified in 1998, a period the Naxalites concede was the ?black chapter? of their revolution. 

 In the months preceding the merger, an official said there were several reports of PW and MCC extremists attacking each other. 

 A case in point is the incident in May under Islampur police station in Nalanda district when two dozen PW militants killed three MCC activists following differences over collection of levy. In retaliation, MCC extremists killed a PW area commander under Belaganj police station of Gaya district in July. 

 There were also reports of 50 PW extremists killing two MCC supporters over differences in Gaya district that same month. ?There have been some reports of violence after the merger, but we are yet to determine the details yet,? the official said. 

 Fears of violence in the run-up to the elections are also being fed by the perception that the two outfits back rival parties. 

 In political circles, it is believed that the Yadav-Dushad caste combination among the MCC commanders, who have called for boycott of elections earlier, often prompt them to back Rashtriya Janata Dal candidates in several places in their ?personal capacities?. The PW commanders, on the other hand, are said to have a ?soft corner? for the Samata Party.

 ?If a group with a particular political affiliation tries to force a unified stand down the other partner?s throat, there is a very good chance of violence escalating to very high levels,? said the home official. He pointed out that the division of areas where extortion rackets were run would also lead to problems. 

 ?I would not worry about the extortion rackets as the Naxalites are very capable of splitting areas,? said a CPI (M-L) leader in Patna, but he suggested there were other problems. Like the PW threat not to allow any political formation in Bihar to hold a rally after the government denied the CPI (M-L) permission.

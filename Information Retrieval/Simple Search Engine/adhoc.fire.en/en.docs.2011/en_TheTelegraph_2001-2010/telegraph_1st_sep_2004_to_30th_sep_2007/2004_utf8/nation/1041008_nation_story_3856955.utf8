 More talks with Pak

 New Delhi, Oct. 7: India and Pakistan have decided to take another shot at sorting out their differences by holding one more round of talks on the proposed Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus service that could bring people of the two Kashmirs closer, reports our special correspondent. 

 The two sides have agreed to take up eight more issues ? not those part of the Composite Dialogue. Among them is the proposed rail link between Munnabao and Khokhrapar, finalising an MoU for closer cooperation between the narcotics control authorities, the draft agreement on advance notification on missile tests and expert-level meeting on conventional confidence-building measures.

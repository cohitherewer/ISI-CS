 Civic bodies under scanner

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Dec. 19: Orissa urban development minister K.V. Singhdeo has said the government is determined to crack down on promoters and officials of Bhubaneswar Development Authority (BDA) and Cuttack Development Authority (CDA) who are responsible for illegal constructions in the two cities.

 Replying to queries on the supplementary budget of his department in the Orissa Assembly, Singhdeo said the government would take similar action against development authorities of other cities also.

 The minister pointed out that since the absence of any provision for the transfer of employees of civic authorities was primarily responsible for the nexus, the government would make an amendment in the Orissa Development Act to check irregularities.

 Admitting that the provision of civic amenities in urban local bodies is not up to the mark due to resource constraints and several other social factors, Singhdeo added that the urban development department is making concerted efforts to improve matters.

 While there is limited scope to increase the revenue income of the local bodies, the government assistance continues to be meagre. 

 Singhdeo warned it would be difficult to sustain the rising demands of the local authorities without addressing the issue of holding tax, which was yet to be revised. Migration from rural to urban areas has added to the problems of the local bodies, which do not have the infrastructure to meet the needs of the rising population, he added.

 Singhdeo further revealed that the share from entry tax has declined though the government promised to increase it every year from 1999-2000, which was considered the base year.

 Entry tax collection in the base year was Rs 97.40 crore while the department received Rs 85 crore in the 2000-01 fiscal. The target for the current fiscal was Rs 152 crore but the Orissa finance department has released only Rs 128 crore so far. 

 Responding to the criticism that the urban development department has not constructed a single new road in any of the local urban areas, the minister said the government has spent Rs 7 crore of the sanctioned amount of Rs 15 crore for the repair of roads.

 On providing land for housing projects to lower income groups, the minister said the department has mooted a land bank scheme for this purpose and also approached the general administration and revenue departments for the transfer of over 900 acres of land in Bhubaneswar.

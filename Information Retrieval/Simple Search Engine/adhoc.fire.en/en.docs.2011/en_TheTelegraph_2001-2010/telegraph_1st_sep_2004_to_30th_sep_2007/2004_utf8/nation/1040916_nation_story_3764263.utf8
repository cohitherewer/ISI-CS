 PM aide plays down ?interview?

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 15: The Prime Minister?s media adviser tried to underplay Manmohan Singh?s first media ?interview? given to the RSS mouthpiece, saying ?every citizen has the right to meet him?.

 Sanjaya Baru denied that Panchajanya editor Tarun Vijay was granted an ?interview?. ?Various editors have been meeting the PM from time to time. There?s a difference between seeking time for a meeting and an interview.?

 Baru added there was no ?hard and fast? rule that they would not report on these ?interactions?, mentioning that editors of at least two newspapers and a weekly had referred to the meetings in their columns. ?The PM did not say anything that was off-the-record. The discussions were open and so we saw nothing wrong if they were reported or referred to.?

 Baru emphasised that Singh?s quotes in Vijay?s article ? Let?s Work Together ? which did not use the conventional question-answer format, were ?factually correct?.

 As for ?interviews?, Baru said, the Prime Minister has given only two so far ? to Time magazine and the Times London. ?This is because he is visiting the US and the UK.? Sources said the article was of a piece with the BJP?s ?strategy? to drive a wedge between Singh and Sonia Gandhi.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 To progress, with ?minority ethnic?

 AMIT ROY

 London, Oct. 6: Britain?s 

 Law Society, which has been embroiled in a long running 

 dispute with a former Indian vice-president amid allegations 

 of racial discrimination, today issued new guidelines on 

 the use of language and especially the term ?ethnic minority?.

 The society, which represents 90,000 solicitors in England and Wales, wants language to reflect the reality of a modern, progressive, multi-racial and multi-cultural country.

 It wants ?ethnic minority?, a term which encompasses Indians, Pakistanis, Asians and black people generally, to be replaced by ?minority ethnic?, since not all minorities are ethnic.

 It also wants ?spouse? to be ditched in favour of ?partner?, on the grounds that the use of ?spouse? may offend homosexuals.

 While the society?s intentions are, no doubt, honourable, it suffers from something of an image problem itself ? especially among a section of the Indian population because of its protracted war with Kamlesh Bahl.

 Bahl, who was the organisation?s vice-president, was set to take over as its first woman and first Asian president in 2000. But she was kicked out after being accused of bullying staff. She, in turn, accused her senior colleagues of racial discrimination ? and an increasingly acrimonious battle has raged since then between the two sides.

 In July 2001, the society was found guilty of race and sex bias by an employment tribunal which ruled in favour of Bahl, who alleged that she had been discriminated against because of her racial origin and sex. She is an Indian who arrived with her family from Kenya.

 However, Bahl herself was accused of lying under oath and a separate external inquiry upheld allegations of bullying made against her by Law Society staff in 2000.

 Bahl?s case has been taken up by several Indian organisations, which have backed up her view of the Law Society as ?institutionally racist?. But the society has also hit back and sought to paint a portrait of Bahl as an overbearing woman who threw her weight around. Bahl is determined to fight on.

 Whatever the rights and wrongs, the row has poisoned the atmosphere in the world of Asian-origin lawyers. And today many Indians, especially women, are taking up the law.

 Explaining the need to modernise use of language, the society?s new Equality and Diversity Handbook argues the need to replace ?ethnic minority? with ?minority ethnic?.

 ?Some people prefer not to use this term because they feel it implies that only minority communities have ethnicity,? the guide says.

 Minority ethnic, however, is ?all-embracing and inclusive? and ?perfectly acceptable to use to describe all minority ethnic communities?.

 The book explains: ?The term minority ethnic makes it clearer that it is just not minorities who have an ethnic identity but also the majority. The emphasis is on the minority status rather than the ethnicity.?

 The old phrase, while it generally did not cause offence, failed to recognise that ?white? is an ethnicity, and also did not encompass white minority groups such as Irish, Jewish and eastern European communities, it adds.

 The most inclusive term to use was ?black and minority ethnic? or ?BME?, it suggests.

 This may prove about as easy as trying to replace the word ?Bollywood?, which some Indian stars such as Amitabh Bachchan find demeaning, with ?the Indian film industry?.

 On sexual orientation, the guidebook says: ?Avoid assuming that everyone belongs to a traditional family. The use of the term ?partner? instead of ?spouse? is more inclusive.?

 A Law Society spokeswoman said: ?The handbook has been designed to help the Law Society council members to be even more inclusive. The language we use is an important part of this and is continually changing as attitudes change. The handbook reflects how people wish to be referred to.?

 Deuba lands at Delhi door

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 8: Pressure from armed Maoists and democratic forces has forced Nepal?s Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba to come here to seek legitimacy and support.

 Deuba, who arrived today on a five-day visit, is leading a team of about 40 members and may even sign a few agreements on culture and science and technology. But his main objective will be to seek the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government?s support for his government.

 An agreement on a proposed pipeline from Amlikgunj to Rukswal is scheduled to be signed by Indian Oil Corporation and Nepal Oil. There may be discussions on a proposed extradition treaty, but there is little chance of a pact being signed during Deuba?s visit.

 The Opposition in Nepal warned the Prime Minister before he left for India not to make any formal agreement with Delhi as it would not be supported by the Nepalese people.

 Deuba is likely to talk to key Indian leaders including his Indian counterpart Manmohan Singh, foreign minister K. Natwar Singh and national security adviser J.. Dixit.

 Deuba?s selection as Prime Minister by King Gyanendra did not go down well with the Maoist rebels or democratic forces in Nepal. The Maoists have blockaded Kathmandu economically and have threatened to hit all companies where the King has interests and which have Indian or multinational investment. The rebels have asked 47 such companies to shut shop.

 Some days ago, they attacked the Nepal Lever factory to show they meant business.

 Opposition from politicians, especially the Nepali Congress-led democratic forces, has only made things worse for Deuba.

 The gamut of bilateral relations will be discussed over the next few days, but Deuba will be most interested in gauging Delhi?s mood towards his government and seek its support, particularly for his fight against the Maoists.

 India has made it clear it will extend any support Nepal needs to deal with the Maoists. It realises that Nepal and the rebels are engaged in a tussle for supremacy, preparing the ground for the time when they might have to return to the talks table to find a solution.

 House is home to leaders in metal

 New Delhi, Nov. 15: Parliament is full of towering leaders, not in the flesh but in metal or stone.

 If the growing demand for statues and portraits is any indication, the House of Indian democracy will soon resemble a museum. As many as 34 statues and 87 portraits have already found a place in the Parliament complex. Only 25 designated spots for statues remain available, of which 13 have been booked as demands pour in.

 On December 10, Marxist leader A.K. Gopalan, better known as AKG, veteran communist S.A. Dange and socialist leader Acharya Narendra Dev will join the hallowed gallery. Seven days later, a statue of Saheed Durga Mallah, a freedom fighter from Sikkim, will be unveiled.

 But first off the mark will be Subramania Bharati, Sarat Chandra Bose, Tridib Kumar Choudhary, an RSP leader, and Basudev Balwant Bhadke, a freedom fighter from Maharashtra, whose portraits will be unveiled on December 3.

 Sources in the parliamentary committee on statues and portraits attributed the scramble to a tendency among parties, especially regional ones, and individuals to use the installation of statues to score political points.

 The Telugu Desam Party, for instance, has been pressing for a statue of its founder, N.T. Rama Rao.

 The Shiv Sena lobbied for Chhatrapati Shivaji?s statue and got its way last year. Then Speaker Manohar Joshi, of the Sena, had played a major role in getting the Rs 40-lakh statue installed.

 The Atal Bihari Vajpayee regime had installed Hindu Mahasabha leader Veer Savarkar?s portrait in the Central Hall amid a boycott by the Left and the Congress.

 Sources said Vice-President Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, former high commissioner to Britain L.M. Singhvi and Congress leader Karan Singh pressed for the installation of statues of former rajas of Rajasthan and Kashmir.

 On November 8, the statue and portrait panel, led by Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee, approved the installation of a sitting Rabindranath Tagore. The statue will be put up in the library complex but it is not known when.

 The statues ? made of materials ranging from bronze and rock to alloys ? are usually sponsored by the governments of the states to which the late leaders belonged or by organisations. The AKG statue, for instance, is sponsored by the Kerala government.

 The cost varies from Rs 5 lakh to Rs 10 lakh each.

 This will be the first time that communists will join the hallowed gallery that has leaders from Chandragupta Maurya of ancient India to Mahatma Gandhi.

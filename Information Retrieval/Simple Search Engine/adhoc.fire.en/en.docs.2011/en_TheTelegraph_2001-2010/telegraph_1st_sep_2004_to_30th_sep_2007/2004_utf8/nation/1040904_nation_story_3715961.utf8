 Judeo-tape man to appear in HC

 New Delhi(PTI): Bhupendra Singh Patel 

 alias Rahul, who conducted a sting operation against former 

 Union minister Dilip Singh Judeo in 2003, has been asked 

 to appear before Delhi High Court on September 9.

 He will be examined on the status of the unedited original tapes of the cash-on-camera scam.

 According to the August 12 order of the court, he was to appear before the court on Friday but his examination was postponed at the request of senior counsel D.C. Mathur.

 Justice S.K. Agrawal had sought Rahuls presence for his failure to file an unambiguous affidavit in conformity with his earlier submission that the unedited original tapes of the cash-on-camera scam have been destroyed.

 You either have it (the original tapes) or you dont have it. Produce the original tapes as ordered by the court or face the consequences, the judge, who had earlier given two weeks to Rahul to file an affidavit, had said.

 On the CBIs request, the high court had on January 13 ordered Rahul to hand over the tapes to the bureau. The order was reiterated on February 17 and May 31. But on July 5, Rahul told the court that the unedited original tapes of the scam involving the BJP leader had been destroyed. The CBI could use the tape shown on TV channels, Rahul said.

 The bureau had alleged that the accused was not cooperating with it and urged the court to vacate the stay on his arrest.

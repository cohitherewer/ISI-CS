 Grassroots health care plan rush

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Nov. 2: The Union health ministry is working overtime to prepare the blueprint for a national rural healthcare mission to be announced by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on November 14, Jawaharlal Nehru?s birth anniversary. 

 The stress on rural health follows the government?s common minimum programme, which is aimed at improving the condition of the vast majority of people living in poverty in the villages. The government is committed to increase public health spending to 2-3 per cent of the GDP over the next five years. 

 Health minister Anbumani Ramadoss made a presentation to Singh and his senior colleagues, including finance minister P. Chidambaram and deputy chairman of the Planning Commission Montek Singh Ahluwalia, three weeks ago. His ministry has been co-ordinating with the Prime Minister?s Office and the states for several months to finalise the scheme, which will be placed before the cabinet shortly. 

 However, Ramadoss told reporters this evening that the mission would be effective only from next April. ?Next year, the programme will be in full swing,? the minister said. He believes it will take time for the plans to be implemented. The cost of the scheme is expected to be between Rs 6,000 and Rs 8,000 crore.

 The first phase of the programme will be confined to 17 states. Today, the Union minister held consultations with his counterparts in those states. 

 Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan, Orissa, Jharkhand, Uttaranchal, Chhattisgarh, Jammu and Kashmir, and Assam sent their ministers for detailed consultations. The scheme will also be extended to the Northeast states.

 The mission aims to integrate the existing programmes and involve people at the grassroots to take care of basic health and hygiene. The focus will be the accredited social health activist (ASHA), who will be a local woman selected by the panchayat or its health committee. 

 These women would be trained for a year on basic health needs like immunisation programmes, pre- and post-natal care of mothers and how to deal with common ailments. The activist will receive a nominal stipend of Rs 100, but can supplement her income by helping in immunisation programmes and care of mother and child.

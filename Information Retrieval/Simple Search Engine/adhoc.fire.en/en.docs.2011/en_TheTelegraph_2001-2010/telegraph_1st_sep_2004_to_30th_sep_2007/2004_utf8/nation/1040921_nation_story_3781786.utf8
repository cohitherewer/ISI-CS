 Uma plots vanishing act

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Bhopal, Sept. 20: Uma Bharti 

 may flaunt the Tricolour and badmouth Sonia Gandhi and Laloo 

 Prasad Yadav during her 3,500-km long ?tiranga yatra?, but 

 privately, she is quite upset with some powerful leaders 

 of her own BJP.

 Uma, one of the most public faces of the post-Lok Sabha election BJP, is sulking and by all indications, will opt for ?agyatvas (hiding)? soon after her yatra concludes in Amritsar on Saturday.

 Sources close to the former Madhya Pradesh chief minister said her destination would not be the temple town of Kedarnath in Uttaranchal, but could be Udupi in Karnataka where her spiritual guru has an ashram. During the ?agyatvas?, Uma will not think about politics or interact with political workers; she will devote time to ?spiritual pursuits?.

 Apart from airing her discontent by disappearing, Uma and her camp hope to hurt the BJP?s prospects in poll-bound Maharashtra where pre-election surveys show the BJP-Shiv Sena alliance trailing the ruling Congress-Nationalist Congress Party combine.

 The sadhvi yesterday demanded to know of Madhya Pradesh BJP chief and veteran leader Kailash Joshi why he had stopped telephoning her. Uma regretted that many state BJP leaders and ministers had turned their back on her when she was in judicial custody in Hubli. The septuagenarian Joshi mumbled that he had tried calling up but Uma was not impressed.

 She then turned to the BJP organising secretary Kaptan Singh Solanki, saying the ?Hubli episode? had taught her many lessons. ?I have come to know the true character of many,? Uma said referring to ?good-weather? friends who changed loyalty minutes after she quit as chief minister.

 Sources close to the sadhvi confirmed she had had a ?showdown? with party chief M. Venkaiah Naidu who was absent during her Bhopal rally. Uma supporters today claimed ?victory? pointing out that her outburst has had an impact on the BJP leadership, forcing it to alter former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee?s programme. Vajpayee will now be present at Amritsar on Saturday instead of attending a party function here.

 Uma is also upset with the BJP leadership over the delay in granting a by-election ticket to her prot?g? Prahlad Patel from Nahota. Patel, a former Union minister, is keen on contesting the elections and Uma has been openly backing his candidature; however, the issue has not been clinched.

 An Uma supporter was heard saying here yesterday: ?Didi gave tickets to over 200 BJP nominees in November 2003 and 173 of them won. Now things have come to such a pass that she is struggling to ensure a ticket for Prahlad Patel.?

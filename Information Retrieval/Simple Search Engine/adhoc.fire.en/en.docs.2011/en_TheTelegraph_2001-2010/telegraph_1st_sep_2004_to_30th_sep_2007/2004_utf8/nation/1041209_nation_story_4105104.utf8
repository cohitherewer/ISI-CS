 Qaida-hit father mourns dead son

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, Dec. 8: One father grieved for his dead son. Another thanked god.

 In a sprawling bungalow in Janaki Nagar, a cloud of despair hung heavy as Mohammed Raheemuddin mourned his youngest son, Basheeruddin, who died in Monday?s crossfire between security forces and al Qaida militants who stormed the US consulate in Jeddah.

 ?My youngest son died just six days before his 29th birthday,? the 52-year-old retired government employee said.

 Raheemuddin?s other two sons ? Aneesuddin and Naseeruddin ? also work in Jeddah, but he missed his youngest the most.

 Nine people, including four militants, died in the attack in what al Qaida said was a reprisal for last month?s US assault on Falluja in Iraq. The brazen attack showed that Saudi-born Osama bin Laden?s network still poses a threat despite an 18-month-long crackdown in which leading militants have been killed or captured.

 It also highlighted flaws in US and Saudi security measures to protect the mission from the militant group, which has repeatedly vowed to strike at US interests in Saudi Arabia. 

 In Hyderabad, friends and relatives trooped to the posh bungalow in the NRI colony in the city?s Toli Chowki area as news of Basheeruddin?s death reached the family yesterday afternoon. Senior police and political leaders also dropped in to console Raheemuddin.

 Basheeruddin?s former classmates from the local St John?s school and St Paul?s junior college stood in silence as visitors placed flowers before a portrait of their dead friend in his school uniform. None could believe that Basheeruddin, who was in Hyderabad for Ramazan and spent a lot of time with friends and relatives, was no more.

 ?My son has been very unlucky. He had married in July last and my daughter-in-law Aisha is pregnant,? Raheemuddin said. He plans to leave for Jeddah today to conduct the last rites. ?We have been told that we cannot get the body to India,? he said.

 While Raheemuddin grieved, his neighbour Mohammed Syed Khadri thanked Allah for his son?s second providential escape. Syed Khadri?s son Jaleeluddin works in the office of the marketing attach? in the consulate. 

 ?By Allah?s grace, my son is safe. We received information that he is safe,? Syed Khadri, who went to console Raheemuddin yesterday, said. Two years ago, Jaleeluddin had escaped another militant attack on a residential complex in Riyadh.

 Basheeruddin is the third person from Hyderabad to have died since January in the backlash from anti-US forces after America?s invasion of Iraq. The other two ? both construction workers ? were posted in Kuwait and Iraq.

 Larger SC bench for media row

 R. VENKATARAMAN

 New Delhi, Dec. 9: The Supreme Court today referred to a seven-judge constitution bench the question of the ?right to comment/report/ criticise legislative proceedings and the right of privilege of the legislature?.

 The issue arises from the Tamil Nadu Assembly?s resolution last year sentencing six journalists to imprisonment for breach of privilege.

 The Speaker had sentenced five senior journalists of a newspaper, as well as the editor of the DMK mouthpiece Murasoli to seven days? imprisonment for the offence.

 A five-judge constitution bench comprising Chief Justice R.C. Lahoti and Justices B.N. Agrawal, H.K. Sema, G.P. Mathur and P.K. Balasubramanyam referred the matter to a seven-judge bench today. 

 This followed submissions by senior counsel Harish Salve, appearing for the newspaper, that the Supreme Court had given conflicting rulings on the freedom of the press.

 Salve cited a 1954 case in which the apex court had ruled that privilege of a state legislature would not bind freedom of speech and expression guaranteed as a fundamental right under Article 19(1). 

 But a 1965 judgment said that though the privileges of the House were subject to the right to life guaranteed under Article 21, the right to free speech under Article 19 could not come in the way of the House deciding an issue relating to its privileges.

 This in effect meant that a journalist or citizen could not report, comment and/or criticise any part of the legislative proceedings if the Speaker so desired.

 Salve said ?even the portions expunged by the Speaker? could be reported and commented on by the media in the public interest because of its ?right to know and inform?. 

 He added that the public had the right to know why a particular portion of the proceedings had been expunged.

 The counsel said the Assembly had later revoked its own November 7, 2003 resolution in which it found the six journalists guilty of breach of privilege and sentenced them to seven days? imprisonment. But the larger question of media freedom had not been resolved, he said.

 Appearing for the Centre, solicitor-general G.E. Vahanvati said this was a sensitive issue.

 As the cause of action no longer existed ? since the arrest resolution had been revoked ? there was no need for the court to go into the issue, he added.

 At this, the court asked Vahanvati why Parliament had not framed a law to deal with this and why the court was having to ?poke its nose? into the spat between the legislature and media.

 Salve said laws relating to freedom of press, speech and expression had undergone a ?sea change? worldwide as the media had been recognised as the ?Fourth Estate of the realm?. 

 He said the media in several countries reported and analysed even significant remarks that the Speaker may have expunged.

 At this the bench said the freedom should be available to those who deserved it and the media too had its ?responsibilities attached to the right? and should function within its limits.

 ?Protection available under Article 19 should be available only to those who deserve it. Should we not have a responsible press?? the chief justice asked Salve.

 When Salve said the media had been recognised as the ?fourth pillar of democracy?, Lahoti responded: ?This is not to be told to us alone. The media should also be told that they are the fourth pillars of the democracy and function in a responsible manner.?

The air field services unit is in addition to an Indian special forces and an IAF contingent that are already in the war-torn nation. The airfield services unit will be accompanied for the first time by the IAF unit called Garud.

 They will touch down in Mauritius before reaching South Africa. 

 The contingent, led by Air Commodore R. Pratap as overall supervisor and with Group Captain Rajan Bhasin, will also showcase its abilities at the African Aerospace and Defence Exhibition during its stay in South Africa

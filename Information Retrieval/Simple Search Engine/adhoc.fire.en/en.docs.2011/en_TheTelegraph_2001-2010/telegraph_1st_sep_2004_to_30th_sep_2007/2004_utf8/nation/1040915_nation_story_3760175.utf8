 Khurana keen on capital comeback

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 14: Rajasthan 

 governor Madan Lal Khurana is threatening to quit and return 

 to active politics in his home turf Delhi as he is at loggerheads 

 with chief minister Vasundhara Raje.

Sources said Khurana recently met leader of the Opposition 

L.K. Advani and BJP chief M. Venkaiah Naidu here to work out his rehabilitation 

in Delhi, either as BJP in-charge or as a Rajya Sabha member. But the party brass 

is not keen on his return as it may upset the delicate organisational equation.

 The RSS, too, has reservations about Khurana as he had once raised a ruckus over an attack on Christians in Gujarat, the sources added. As for an Upper House nomination, there is no vacancy now. But the hardboiled politician that he is, Khurana is averse to remaining a recluse in Raj Bhavan. Even as his party keeps its fingers crossed, the former Delhi chief minister may put in his papers and return to the capital within a week, sources said.

 They cited three reasons for the governor?s threat to quit. The first is Khurana?s friction with his own party?s chief minister.

 He has been using Raj Bhavan for ?janata durbar? much to Raje?s discomfiture. Also, he sought a report on purported starvation deaths in Rajes former constituency of Jhalawar -- from where her son Dushyant Singh was elected to the Lok Sabha in May -- though the chief minister denied these.

 Party insiders said Raje even complained to the high command against the governor?s ?political? activities.

 The second is the chorus of demand for his return from his supporters in the BJP and trade and industry associations in Delhi, who dread the Congress-run Delhi government?s decision on relocating polluting units in the city.

 The third is Khurana?s preference to be politically active instead of occupying a gubernatorial post.

 When the BJP sent Khurana as governor after the partys poor show in the Delhi Assembly polls last year, the idea was to reward a veteran leader with the ease of a Raj Bhavan stint.

 Speculation over Khurana?s return to the capital gained currency after his visit to Delhi on Sunday. Local BJP legislators and supporters mobbed the governor at his home here and begged him to take charge of ?Delhi durbar?.

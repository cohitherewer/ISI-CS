 Pollsters find pulse

 New Delhi, Oct. 16: The Maharashtra election results have helped pollsters salvage their reputation, with most getting the poll tally right.

 Psephologists had ended up with egg on their face after last May?s Lok Sabha elections, which most got completely wrong. The majority had written off the Congress and its allies, saying the National Democratic Alliance would return to power.

 But the results proved the pollsters wrong, making them the butt of ridicule and shattering the people?s faith in election surveys.

 However, today?s Assembly results have brought the smile back to their lips even if doubting Thomases in the Congress and BJP alike were unwilling to believe exit polls till this afternoon. 

 Reacting to the forecast today, senior BJP leader Arun Jaitley had described the verdict as a ?cracked mirror?.

 The Telegraph-STAR News-AC-Nielsen survey, which gave the Congress-Nationalist Congress Party 142 seats, the BJP-Shiv Sena 122 and others 24, got the numbers right. Its region-wise forecast was quite accurate too.

 Aaj Tak had the Congress-NCP at 140-150 seats, the BJP-Sena at 100-110 and others between 30 and 40. Zee News gave 125 seats to the Congress-NCP combine, 115 to the rival alliance and 48 to others. 

 Among television channels, NDTV got it wrong for it projected 125-135 seats for the BJP-Sena, 120-135 seats for the Congress-led alliance and between 30 and 45 for the other players.

 The Congress was nervous over the election predictions, but the BJP was more vocal in trashing the exit poll projections. 

 Rejecting the surveys, Jaitley had said: ?The Congress is facing a considerable anti-incumbency factor and the existence of the rebels has hurt the Congress-NCP and is more advantageous to us.?

 BJP spokesperson Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi had added: ?Maharashtra is reeling under an anti-incumbency factor.? 

 The response of Margaret Alva, the Congress leader in charge of the Maharashtra elections, was: ?If we go by the exit polls, then we will be having a government of Independents.?

 Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayavati was also unhappy with pollsters for saying her party, which contested 272 seats, might not do as well as expected. The BSP as well as the Samajwadi Party, which contested 95 seats, drew a blank.

 Responding to exit polls that said ?others? may win seven to nine seats in Vidarbha, a supremely confident Mayavati had said: ?Wait till the 16th, then you will get the real picture.?

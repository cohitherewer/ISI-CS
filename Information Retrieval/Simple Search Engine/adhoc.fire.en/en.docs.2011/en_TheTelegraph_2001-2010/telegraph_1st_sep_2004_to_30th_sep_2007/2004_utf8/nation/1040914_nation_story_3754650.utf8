 Army chief call to retain special law

 SUJAN DUTTA

 New Delhi, Sept. 13: Army chief General .C. Vij today gave a presentation to home minister Shivraj Patil on internal security and was understood to have pointed out that counter-insurgency operations in Manipur would be difficult to conduct without the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA), even as the Centre mounted back-channel efforts to rope in the 32-organisation Apunba Lup for talks.

 The briefing is likely to continue tomorrow. Vij refused to give details of the presentation. ?It was a regular meeting on everything concerning security,? he said. Vij is likely to brief Patil periodically.

 The army and the defence ministry feel a withdrawal or dilution of the act in Manipur will lead to similar demands elsewhere. The act is invoked for counter-insurgency operations against militants in the Northeast and in Jammu and Kashmir.

 It is understood that the Centre is also using the services of former Manipur chief minister and state Congress leader Rishang Keishing to wean the 32-outfit umbrella organisation called Apunba Lup to the negotiating table.

 Vij is also understood to have dwelt on counter-insurgency operations in Jammu and Kashmir. The army has reported that infiltration had increased over the last three months.

 The army?s view against withdrawing the act reflects the dominant opinion in the government?s security establishment. But Vij did make the point that Manipur chief minister Ibobi Singh?s decision to withdraw the act from the municipal limits of Imphal threatens to weaken the case for the counter-insurgency forces.

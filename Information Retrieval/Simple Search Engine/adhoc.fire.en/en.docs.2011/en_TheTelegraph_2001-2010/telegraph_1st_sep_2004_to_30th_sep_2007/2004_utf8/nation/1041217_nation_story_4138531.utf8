 Pride killing plotter jailed

 AMIT ROY

 London, Dec. 16: The reputation of the otherwise law-abiding Asian community in Britain continues to be besmirched by a handful of fathers who would much rather murder their daughters in so-called ?honour killings? rather then countenance the disgrace of seeing them run off with someone considered to be the wrong man.

 The latest example is that of Kalvinder Dosanjh, a 51-year-old man, who plotted to have his daughter, Sanjit, 23, killed, along with her 43-year-old Jewish boyfriend, Temple Jazac.

 Dosanjh?s plan was to have Jazac?s father killed first and then, when his daughter and her boyfriend attended his funeral, have them murdered, too. He plotted the three killings with an associate, Jagi Rai, 54, a man with underworld connections. The father was prepared to pay ?10,000 per killing.

 Yesterday, at the Old Bailey, Dosanjh, a builder of Rochester, Kent, got 14 years and Rai, a businessman and restaurant owner, of Ilford, east London, nine.

 Their whole scheme misfired because the contract killer who pretended to go along with their plans, turned out to be an undercover policeman. It also transpired that because of a mistake with addresses, the man Dosanjh believed was Jazac?s father was an innocent third party, Malcolm Calver, who was totally unconnected with the affair.

 Such trials also invariably point up the superiority of western culture over what is held to be Indian. Although most honour killings in Britain have occurred among the most orthodox of Pakistani Muslims, some Punjabis have been involved as well. Several women?s groups have urged the government to take action, which is why David Blunkett, home secretary until yesterday, was considering a law to make ?forced marriage? a criminal offence.

 The Dosanjh family can scarcely be called normal. Sanjit first met Jazac over the Internet on Christmas eve, 2000, when he pretended to be a 23-year-old trainee doctor. She ran up a ?600 sending him emails. They met, fell in love and had a whirlwind romance, the court was told.

 After finishing a science degree at the University of Greenwich in May, 2001, Sanjit left a note at home (?I?m sorry but I have to leave to start a new life. I?ve found someone who makes me happy. I hope you understand I have nothing to live for?) and moved in with Jazac at a secret address in Sheffield.

 This kind of behaviour of the part of a daughter would have worried any father but he decided after a showdown with Sanjit and Jazac that he would have them killed to save family honour. The couple moved home several times as he pursued them, until Dosanjh and Rai hired a killer to commit the three murders. The latter turned out to be an undercover cop, identified only as ?Pumi?.

 While Rai pleaded guilty before the trial, Dosanjh claimed he was only trying to get back his daughter. However, he found it hard to explain the single barrel sawn off 12 bore shotgun with live ammunition found in his white van when he was arrested.

 In passing sentence, Judge John Rodgers, QC, told Dosanjh that Sanjit ?left home to live with her boyfriend. You disapproved and you were angry. In my judgment you regard her more as your property than your daughter. Your pursued her for two years. In 2003 you decided to have her and her boyfriend killed?.

 The judge continued the East/West theme: ?You both thought that this young woman had brought dishonour upon your family and upon the community. A police officer bravely pretended to you he would carry out the killings. As a result of police intervention you were arrested before three people lost their lives. The sentence must reflect the public outrage and send out a clear deterrent message.?

 Outside court, detective chief inspector Ron Scott said: ?Dosanjh couldn?t deal with the shame he felt his daughter had brought upon his family by beginning a relationship with someone outside her religion and culture. I have no doubt that if we had not intervened he would have gone through with the murders. It is shocking to think three people would have been killed for honour. No killing is honourable.?

 It is this kind of tragedy that makes some older Indians feel life would have been much simpler had they never come to Britain.

 Dosanjh?s barrister, Jo Sidhu, had told the court that the convictions were a tragedy for the whole family. ?For every day he is incarcerated he will relive these events. He will carve answers as to how he put himself at the centre of an emotional storm. He must live with the knowledge that it is his actions that cast his family into the endless void.?

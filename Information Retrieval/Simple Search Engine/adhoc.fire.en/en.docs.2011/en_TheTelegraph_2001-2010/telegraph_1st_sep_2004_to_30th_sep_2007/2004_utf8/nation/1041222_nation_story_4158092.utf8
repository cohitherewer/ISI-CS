 Rajdhani mishap averted

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Dec. 21: An alert railway signalman helped avert a collision between the Guwahati-New Delhi Rajdhani Express and a goods train at a station in Begusarai last evening.

 The New Delhi-bound Rajdhani Express switched onto a wrong track at Tilrath station in the Begusarai-Barauni section of East Central Railway?s Sonepur division due to a fault in the interlocking system. A goods train was standing on that track near the station. 

 The signalman, who noticed the fault, alerted the driver by raising an alarm, which prompted the latter to apply the emergency brake and avoid a collision, sources said. 

 The assistant stationmaster and a pointsman of Tilrath were suspended following the incident. The train was reportedly moving slowly, which allowed the driver to stop it on time .

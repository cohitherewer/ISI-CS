 BCCI row

 Bhopal, Sept. 14 (PTI): A fresh application was today filed in a local court accusing the Board of Control for Cricket in India of violating the court?s previous order restraining it from taking any decision outside its rule book on appointing Jagmohan Dalmiya patron-in-chief.

 The application, filed by Bhopal Division Cricket Association member Yogesh Khattar through his counsel Ajay Gupta in civil judge P.K. Nigam?s court, alleged that Dalmiya?s appointment to the new post till 2007 at the BCCI?s Chennai meeting on Sunday amounted to contempt of court.

 Gupta sought ?attachment of property of BCCI, its agents, servants and office-bearers? and also their ?detainment in civil prison for a period of three months?.

 The counsel said the respondents have ?acted in violation? of the Bhopal court?s order on Friday and made ?themselves liable to be punished under order 39, rule 2-a of the civil code procedure for disobedience and breach of injunction order passed by his honourable court?.

 The application filed yesterday was withdrawn as it named the office-bearers seeking action against them.

 Justice Nigam, who heard Gupta after he filed a fresh application, reserved his verdict on its admissibility till later in the evening.

 The court had earlier accepted a petition by Khattar alleging the move to appoint Dalmiya as patron-in-chief was outside the BCCI?s rule book. The next date of hearing is Monday.

 Party nod to terror law in BJP states

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Vajpayee 

 New Delhi, Sept. 12: The BJP has decided to get its state governments to enact their own anti-terror laws if the Centre repeals the Prevention of Terrorism Act.

 The two-day conclave of six BJP chief ministers concluded here this evening with the creation of a five-member task force to take up issues of governance in their states. Topping the agenda was the anti-terror law.

 ?The moment the Centre repeals Pota, the states will enact their own (anti-terror) laws,? BJP chief M. Venkaiah Naidu said. He criticised the Manmohan Singh government?s decision to repeal the legislation and accused it of ?reversing? the steps taken by the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance regime to strengthen national security.

 The topic of national security also saw Atal Bihari Vajpayee and .K. Advani speaking in one voice, endorsing each other on the matter close to their hearts.

 When they were governing the country, Opposition parties often spoke of ?dual centres of power?.

 This evening, former Prime Minister Vajpayee took a leaf out of his former deputy?s book and harped on the need for greater internal security, insinuating the Congress-led Centre was not doing enough.

 Advani had in his speech accused the UPA government of not coming up with a considered strategy to combat terrorism even after 100 days in power. ?Internal security in the states should be strengthened. The people in the country should make a firm resolve to defeat all internal and external threats,? Vajpayee said.

 For the rest of his 30-minute speech, the former Prime Minister skipped from vocational education to unemployment and law and order, often losing the thread between one and the other.

 Without naming Sonia Gandhi, Manmohan Singh or the UPA government, he took a dig at the Congress. ?When we wanted to call a conclave of chief ministers, the Congress, particularly its leadership, put a spoke in the wheel. Because they did not want their chief ministers to talk about their differences at our forum,? Vajpayee said.

 The states will submit a memorandum to the 12th finance commission to demand an increase in the states? share of revenue from the present 29.5 per cent to 40 per cent.

 Naidu said they will make the Centre?s discriminatory attitude towards BJP-ruled states a focal point of agitation only after the Task Force gathered enough material on it.

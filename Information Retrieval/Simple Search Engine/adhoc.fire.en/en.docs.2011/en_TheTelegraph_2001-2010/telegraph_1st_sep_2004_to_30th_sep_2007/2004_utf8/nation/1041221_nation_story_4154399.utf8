 Zahira to face court today

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Dec. 20: Zahira Sheikh, the prime witness in the Best Bakery case who has taken a U-turn, will depose in the retrial at a special court here tomorrow. 

 Zahira, who was present in the court today, did not depose because the prosecution did not conclude the cross-examination of her mother Shehrunnisa till the evening.

 Shehrunnisa, whose cross-examination began last week, continued to be in denial of various circumstances under which the carnage on March 1 and March 2, 2002, took place in the Vadodara bakery, leading to the death of 14 people. Among the dead were Shehrunnisa?s daughter Sabera and her brother Qausar Ali.

 She said her family was threatened at their Meera Road-Bhayandar residence in Mumbai by Raees Khan, a colleague of Teesta Setalvad, an activist who highlighted the case, since Navratri last year. 

 Shehrunnisa said she did not know why she left for Vadodara with her family from Meera Road, but did so because Zahira asked her to. On their return to Vadodara, Zahira held a news conference where she said she had named innocent people as accused because of pressure from Setalvad.

 Charged by the prosecution that she and her family have been bribed by the Jandhikari Sangathan in Gujarat to give false evidence in court and not to identify the accused, Shehrunnisa said that was not the case.

 Previously she has said that it was better that her daughter was dead and that Quasar, her brother, was not present at the bakery during the carnage.

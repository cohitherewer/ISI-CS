 George Yangon meet

 PRANAY SHARMA

 New Delhi, Oct. 16: George Fernandes, whose on-going convention for the restoration of democracy in Myanmar has run into rough weather, today said he did not want to organise it earlier to avoid embarrassing the NDA government in which he was defence minister.

 The convention, coming as it does a few weeks before the chairman of the State Peace and Development Committee of Myanmar ? the ruling junta in Yangon ? General Than Shwe is scheduled to visit the country, has raised eyebrows and ruffled feathers in South Block.

 Foreign secretary Shyam Saran had requested the NDA convener to postpone the convention in view of the trip that begins on October 24.

 ?I was not aware of the timing of this visit and it is not being done with an aim to embarrass the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government either,? Fernandes stressed. ?Despite my sympathies for the Burmese cause, I could not organise this convention earlier since I was in the government.?

 Asked whether he could have done something informally, the former defence minister said: ?I had done what I could.?

 Later, members of the convention said that, as defence minister, Fernandes would refuse to meet senior members of Yangon?s military junta when they would come visiting. They also alleged that he would intervene, most of the time discreetly, on behalf of pro-democracy supporters whenever they needed his help.

Yesterday ? the first day of the convention ? was 

clouded by controversy when some of Fernandes? supporters forcibly removed a portrait 

of Congress president Sonia Gandhi from the walls of the convention hall.

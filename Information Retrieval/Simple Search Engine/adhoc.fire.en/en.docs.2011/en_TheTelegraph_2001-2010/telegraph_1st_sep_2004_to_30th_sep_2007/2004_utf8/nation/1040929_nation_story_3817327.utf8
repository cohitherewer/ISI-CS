 Joint patrol clicks, rebel camps don?t

 New Delhi, Sept. 28: India and Bangladesh are likely to finalise plans for joint patrol along the border over the next few days but there has been no meeting point yet over claims of insurgents operating from each other?s territory. 

 Bangladesh Rifles chief Major General Jehangir Alam Chowdhury dismissed Delhi?s allegations that anti-India insurgent camps were active in Bangladesh. ?There is not a single terrorist camp in Bangladesh,? he said after the five-day talks with the Border Security Force got underway today.

 The Bangladeshi force, armed with its own list of anti-Dhaka camps in India, claimed that some of the locations of rebel bases cited by Delhi were cantonment areas or places where the BDR?s offices were situated or had been traced to the Bay of Bengal or coastal areas.

 BSF officials later laughed away the response, saying Dhaka was playing copycat. The BSF had earlier dismissed the BDR?s list of insurgent camps in India suggesting that their locations matched those of BSF outposts or schools. 

 Chowdhury went on to dub the insurgent camps a ?creation of the media?, though he made it clear that forward movement was possible on other issues.

 BSF chief Ajai Raj Sharma, who listened to Chowdhury rubbishing his claims, looked on with a smile on his face. He spoke once the BDR chief was out of sight ? they had come to North Block for a courtesy call on home minister Shivraj Patil ? to defend the Indian position.

 Sharma said he had told his counterparts during the daylong deliberations that there was not much anybody could do if they did not want to look at facts. ?If it is daytime and you keep on insisting that it is dark, what can anyone do?? the BSF official asked. 

 But Sharma, who said he had a good meeting with Chowdhury, decided to explain the BDR?s denial.

 ?It is possible that the BDR may not really know about the camps because they fall beyond their territorial jurisdiction, but other security outfits in Dhaka would know,? Sharma said.

 An official later suggested that Sharma was only trying to ensure that the talks with the BDR delegation were fruitful and India?s concerns about insurgent camps did not come in the way of agreements on other issues.

 Coordinated patrolling of the border was one of them. Sharma, who had floated the concept of joint patrol on India?s eastern border, said a proposal on the modalities had been submitted to the BDR. The two delegations are likely to carry on discussions on this issue and finalise a draft by the weekend.

 There was no breakthrough on the contentious issue of allowing the BSF to erect a fence within 150 yards of the zero line. 

 The BDR is waiting for Dhaka to take a stand when the foreign secretaries of the two countries meet in November. But Delhi has said it is free to go ahead with the fencing even if there is no negotiated settlement as it was a country?s sovereign right to do what it wants on its land. The two sides have agreed on joint teams to inspect development projects stalled as they fall within 150 yards of the zero line. 

 About 30 projects on the Indian side have been held up because the BDR said they violated the 1975 guidelines that bar construction of ?defensive structures?.

 A home ministry official said forward movement was expected on this issue as the BSF, too, had retaliated by opposing work on the other side. Union home secretary Dhirendra Singh had during his recent Dhaka visit called for correct interpretation of the guidelines so that civilians are not affected by the differences between the two security forces.

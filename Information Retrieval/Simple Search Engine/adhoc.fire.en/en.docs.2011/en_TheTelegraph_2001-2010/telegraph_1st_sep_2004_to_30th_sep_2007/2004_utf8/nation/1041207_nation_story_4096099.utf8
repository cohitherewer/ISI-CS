 Seer prize on pause

 CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA

 Balamuralikrishna

 Mumbai, Dec. 6: Noted Carnatic singer M. Balamuralikrishna has declined to accept an award instituted in Jayendra Saraswati?s name until the Kanchi seer is cleared of murder charges.

 The classical singer, who was here today to perform at a concert at the Shanmukhanand Hall in central Mumbai, said he could not accept the Shri Jayendra Saraswati National Eminence Award for Fine Arts right now.

 ?He (Balamuralikrishna) said that he would accept it at a later date from the hands of the Sankaracharya himself, as he, like the rest of the community, respects the Sankaracharya,? a spokesperson for the South Indian Education Society said. The seer is venerated by Tamils as their highest religious authority and the 74-year-old singer is Tamilian.

 The singer is known for his vibrant, wide-ranging voice and has perfect control in all three octaves. He plays the kanjira, mridangam, viola and violin and has several ragas and over 400 classical music compositions to his credit.

 Balamuralikrishna?s move comes on the eve of a publicity drive by the Kanchi Kamakoti Mutt to set the record straight about the seer?s arrest.

 Advertisements are set to appear in leading newspapers tomorrow clarifying that the seer has not ?confessed? as reported in the media nor is the mutt as rich as it is made out to be. It also asks why writer Anuradha Ramanan chose to keep quiet for 12 years about the alleged attempt to molest her and points out that she presided over an August 2003 function at a hospital run by the trust.

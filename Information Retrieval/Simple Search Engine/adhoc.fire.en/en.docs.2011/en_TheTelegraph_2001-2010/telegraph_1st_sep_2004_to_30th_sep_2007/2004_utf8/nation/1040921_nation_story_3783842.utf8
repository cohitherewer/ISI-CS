reverses aid policy

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 20: The Manmohan Singh government has reversed the previous BJP-led regime?s policy not to accept ?chicken-feed? aid from nations critical of India.

 It is rethinking the BJP government?s move to screen aid being sent to non-governmental organisations, including churches and Muslim organisations. The moves have the potential to spark a controversy. The government today said it would accept aid from European Union nations that are not G8 members if the bilateral aid is more than $25 million (about Rs 112.5 crore). 

 However bilateral aid will only be accepted from the European Commission, EU nations and the rich man?s G8 club comprising the US, UK, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, Canada and Russia. 

 The new policy says all countries can give bilateral aid directly to autonomous institutions, universities and NGOs as before.

 A government spokesperson said: ?A simplified policy to facilitate the flow of bilateral assistance to non-governmental organisations and autonomous institutions will be announced shortly.?

 Aid to NGOs and autonomous organisations attracted controversy when the BJP was in power as questions were raised about funding to religious outfits that had been accused of being involved in conversions and other ?nefarious activities?. BJP vice-president Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said: ?The present government should be very cautious in taking any decisions on this as it is extremely sensitive.?

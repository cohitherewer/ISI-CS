 Full-term leeway for Shah

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 22: The United Progressive Alliance government is planning a second shuffle in Raj Bhavans across the country over the next month but will not disturb Bengal governor Viren J. Shah who will complete his tenure at the end of the year.

 The Centre may force a vacancy in the Bihar Raj Bhavan by asking governor Rama Jois to step down even as it drafts its list of recommendations to fill vacancies that will arise in Bengal, Maharashtra, Orissa, Jharkhand and Arunachal Pradesh. Jois was spared the axe in July when Union home minister Shivraj Patil went about dismissing governors with Sangh parivar links.

 Jois, a former Chief Justice of Punjab and Haryana High Court, has never made a secret of his ideological leanings and had recently contributed to a magazine published from former BJP chief M. Venkaiah Naidu?s residence that reportedly backed the BJP?s theory on secularism.

 On Republic Day this year, the governor had publicly criticised the state?s law and order situation, prompting Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Laloo Prasad Yadav to demand his recall.

 A senior central government source confirmed that a change of guard at the Bihar Raj Bhavan is being considered because of ?several complaints? against the governor. Jois was appointed governor of Jharkhand in July 2002 by the National Democratic Alliance government before being moved to Bihar in May 2003 for the remainder of his term.

 Sources said a decision had been taken not to recall governors who were on the verge of completing their tenure. The list includes Shah and Ved Marwah in Jharkhand who complete their terms in early December, M.M. Rajendran who finishes his term in Orissa in mid-November, V.C. Pande in Arunachal Pradesh and Mohamed Fazal in Maharashtra who complete their terms in November-end.

 The Union home minister is understood to have consulted President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh yesterday. Patil had emphasised after the first shuffle in July that it was not ideology but fears that the incumbents would let ideology influence their working, which had prompted the changes.

 The bottomline, Patil had indicated, was that the Congress-led government would change governors it did not trust to give a true picture of the situation in the states to the Centre.

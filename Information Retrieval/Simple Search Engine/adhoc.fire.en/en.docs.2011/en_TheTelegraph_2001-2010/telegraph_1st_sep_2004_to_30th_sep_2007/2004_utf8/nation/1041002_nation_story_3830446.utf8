 Naxalite talks date

 Hyderabad, Oct. 1: Emissaries of two Naxalite groups today met the Andhra Pradesh home minister to acknowledge acceptance of the invitation for peace talks that had run into trouble over the start date, reports our special correspondent.

 Conveying the acceptance by the underground Naxalite brass ? Ramakrishna of the PWG and Amar of the Jana Shakti ? the five emissaries suggested October 13 for talks kick-off instead of the government?s October 2 date. The agenda and the modalities would be finalised on Monday.

 Yesterday, the ruling Congress and bureaurcrats had wanted to start the talks to coincide with Gandhi Jayanti but the Naxalites? emissaries insisted on October 1, the day they said communists took over in China in 1949.

 The Naxalite top brass finally suggested a fresh date of October 13 to home minister K. Jana Reddy, because, ?in view of ongoing continued vigilance on movement of our activists and lack of coordination, we need time to come out?. The emissaries also handed over final draft copies of the ceasefire agreement without the contentious condition that Naxalites will retain arms. The issue has been put off for later in the scheduled talks.

 Chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy today expressed happiness over the removal of final hurdles to the peace process. ?What matters is the resolving of people?s problems and ushering in of peace.?

 He said individual problems like criminal cases, arrests and litigation would take some time to resolve. ?We have to see how far we can resolve them,? the chief minister said, indicating there might be an amount of amnesty once the peace talks take shape.

 But Rajasekhar Reddy described Naxalites? rigidness on retaining arms as an act of ?playing to the gallery?.

 A day before yesterday?s first public meeting of the PWG in Hyderabad in almost 14 years, the Congress government had announced a nine-member team, including four ministers, to head the talks with the ultra brass.

 Chandrika on power mission

 PRANAY SHARMA

 New Delhi, Oct. 31: Chandrika Kumaratunga will be here on Wednesday to get Delhi?s assurance that it has no favourites in Colombo.

 The Sri Lankan President is trying to garner support to change the existing system of an executive presidency that may allow her to stay in power for a longer period.

 Her arch rival and former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was here earlier this month for talks with the Indian leadership on a number of developments in the island, including stalled peace talks between Colombo and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam.

 Although her party is a major partner in the ruling coalition in Sri Lanka, Kumaratunga will have to decide by the end of next year if she wants the system of executive presidency to continue or revert to the old one where most of the powers lie with the Prime Minister, not the President. 

 To stay powerful, she needs the support of several political parties, including those close to the LTTE, to support a constitutional amendment. But observers feel the LTTE may play for time and instead cut a deal with Wickremesinghe to push through their agenda.

 If Kumaratunga manages to bring about the required changes in the country?s Constitution, she may then get herself elected as Prime Minister and remain powerful.

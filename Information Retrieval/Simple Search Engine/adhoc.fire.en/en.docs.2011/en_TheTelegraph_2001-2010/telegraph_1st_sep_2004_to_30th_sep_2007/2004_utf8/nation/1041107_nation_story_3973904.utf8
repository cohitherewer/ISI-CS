 Glimpses of Nobel years

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, Nov. 6: Did you know that Douglas Dean Osheroff, who won the Nobel prize for physics in 1996, failed in a weekly test on calculus in school?

 Or that as co-editor of his high school newspaper, he ?almost went into journalism? but did not because he had to ?reinvent? his ?personality?.

 Samuel Chao Chung Ting also went on to win the physics Nobel, though the 1976 winner came within a hair?s breadth of achieving nothing. Born to Chinese parents working in the US, he could not go to school till he was 12.

 The quirks of fate that shaped Nobel laureates are on display here at a global touring exhibition organised by the German Exchange Academic Service or DAAD for short in German.

 The exhibition commemorates 100 years of the prize that Swedish inventor, entrepreneur and philanthropist Alfred Nobel instituted. On till Tuesday at the Indian Institute of Technology here, it brings moments from a century-long chronicle of the pioneering, sometimes exciting, sometimes painful journey of individuals who have changed the way we live.

 ?This unique exhibition has come to Chennai from Egypt and is on its way to Poland from here,? says DAAD?s Bettina Katharina Dinter, also a visiting faculty at the IIT. She says one aim of the show, produced and developed by the Smithsonian Institution?s Lamelson Center and the Deutsches Museum, Bonn, is to get youths interested in science and research.

 The students get to hear the great minds speak as 13 iMac computers play rare interviews, while questions invite them as they enter the exhibition hall. Some of the questions are: Were Nobel laureates good students in school? Who or what motivated them? Did the spark of creativity come early or late? How do they sustain their efforts in the face of setbacks?

 As many as 31 Nobel winners were interviewed when they assembled at Lindau, Germany, in June 2000 to mark the 50th meeting of Nobel Laureates. There are first-person accounts from 19 of those interviews.

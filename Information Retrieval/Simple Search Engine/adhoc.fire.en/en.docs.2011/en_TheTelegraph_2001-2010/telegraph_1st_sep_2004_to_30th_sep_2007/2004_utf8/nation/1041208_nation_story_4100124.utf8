 Cops caught in demand-supply gap 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 7: A severe manpower shortage has kept central police organisations from dealing effectively with militants and has forced some gaping holes in the security grid.

 Central police organisations say they have little choice as their entire contingent is often deployed in terrorist or Naxalite-affected states, leaving them with no reserves to fall back on in cases of an emergency. Nor are there enough numbers to retrain police personnel to prepare them for new challenges or even let stressed-out policemen take some time off their gruelling duties and be with their families.

 The incident on November 27 in which an overstressed Central Reserve Police Force jawan Samarendra Deka killed seven of his colleagues in Kashmir?s Barumalla district apparently because he was punished for missing a roll call is seen as a reflection of this problem.

 Police officers believe the Deka massacre is just one aspect of the problem. The absence of reserves ? which has forced the government to defer the replacement of the Border Security Force with the CRPF in Jammu and Kashmir ? is another.

 Ordinarily, one of the six companies that make up a battalion ? in the BSF for instance ? is sent on rotational training whenever the battalion is moved from one troublespot to another. But the excessive demands on security forces have forced the police to keep training schedules to the minimum.

 The CRPF has reportedly come to such a pass that it cannot spare any men for retraining which is crucial before security personnel can fight terrorists. ?Kashmir needs a very strong training component? Or they will be sitting ducks for the terrorists,? warns BSF director-general Ajai Raj Sharma. He believes it will take the CRPF two to three years to replace the BSF.

 The CRPF is not the only overstretched force. Sharma himself has faced such severe manpower shortage that he has had to frequently pull out security personnel from one location when told to provide back-up in another.

 When Manipur was on the boil in July and August over the death of Thangjam Manorama in Assam Rifles custody, the Centre ordered the BSF chief to send eight battalions to Imphal to assist the state in counter-insurgency operations. The BSF was forced to withdraw eight battalions from the Bangladesh border and spread out the remaining force to make up for the resultant gaps.

 Officials insist the government has plans to improve the strength of the central forces but they clearly have not been able to keep up with the rate at which fresh demands for deployment of additional forces crop up.

 At the 39th Raising Day parade of the BSF, Sharma pleaded with the Centre to listen to the central police organisations and urged home minister Shivraj Patil ?not to deploy reserve battalions, and if this is not possible, to raise 19 more battalions?.

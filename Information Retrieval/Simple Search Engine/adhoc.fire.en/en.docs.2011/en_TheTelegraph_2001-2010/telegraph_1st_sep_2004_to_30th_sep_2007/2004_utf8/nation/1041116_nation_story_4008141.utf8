 Khursheed: Heartland move

 New Delhi, Nov. 15: Salman Khursheed is set to unveil his agenda to win over heartland Muslims ahead of formally beginning his second innings as the Uttar Pradesh Congress chief.

 As chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav unveils the Uttar Pradesh pavilion at the ongoing international trade fair here tomorrow, Khursheed will start off from the AICC headquarters for a three-day roadshow of the state.

 Appointed state unit chief a week ago, Khursheed and his convoy will pass through some thickly populated Muslim areas of the heartland state before arriving in Lucknow three days later to formally take charge after the customary Friday prayer.

 The route charted for the roadshow is a clear signal to the Samajwadi Party that the Congress is determined to make another bid to wean away the former?s Muslim support base, according to a leader close to Khursheed.

 His convoy will touch Muslim-dominated western and central Uttar Pradesh towns such as Moradabad, Amroha, Rampur, Bareilly, Pilibhit and Shahjahanpur.

 It was not clear till late this evening whether Congress chief Sonia Gandhi would be there at the AICC headquarters to see off her nominee in charge of the party?s heartland renewal challenge.

 But she is scheduled to be in her Rae Bareli constituency for a couple of days, coinciding with the roadshow.

 The Congress continues to extend outside support to the Mulayam Singh government, but Sonia?s move to send Khursheed to Uttar Pradesh is widely seen as a clear indication of her intention to take the Samajwadis head-on so as to wean away Muslims.

 Conveying such a message was not possible with the help of outgoing state Congress chief Jagdambika Pal as he was known to have a friendly equation with Mulayam Singh, an Uttar Pradesh leader said.

 ?This time, the campaign for weaning the Muslims away will be decisive as it is our assessment that they were inclined to support the party even during the parliamentary elections,? an AICC functionary said.

 He added that if the Muslims ended up backing the Samajwadi Party in the Lok Sabha polls, it was because of a perception that supporting the Congress would not ensure the BJP?s defeat.

 But since the BJP has done badly both in the Lok Sabha elections and in the recent round of Assembly bypolls ? seemingly because of large-scale desertion by its upper-caste support base ? the Congress leadership believes Muslims could be more inclined to return to the partyfold.

 ?With the BJP on the decline in the state, Muslims may be more inclined to return to the Congress,? a party leader said.

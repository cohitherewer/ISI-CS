 Air cargo cracker scare 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Chennai, Oct. 12: A Kuwait Airways flight was nearly grounded early this morning when some firecrackers were found in the cargo to be loaded.

 These would have made it to the plane undetected had it not been for some Central Industrial Security Force personnel.

 Packed in five suitcases, the Diwali firecrackers were meant for Indians in the Gulf. Two airline employees who were pushing the suitcases into the aircraft were arrested.

 Sources at Anna international airport said 43-year-old traffic superviser Abdullah and 40-year-old duty manager (cargo) S.A. Ahmed were found dragging the suitcases inside bypassing baggage scanners.

 But the CISF personnel on duty insisted that the suitcases be ?put through the scan?, the sources said.

 The flight took off later. Security at the airport has been beefed up as cricket players have begun arriving for the second India-Australia test in the city from Thursday.

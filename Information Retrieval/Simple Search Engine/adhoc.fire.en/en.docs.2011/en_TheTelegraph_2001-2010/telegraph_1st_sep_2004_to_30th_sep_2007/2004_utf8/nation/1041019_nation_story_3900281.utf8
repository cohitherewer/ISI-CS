 New Delhi, Oct. 18: The chief of the British army, General Sir Mike Jackson, who began a three-day visit to India, will be touring Indian Army installations close to the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir. 

 In preparation for his visit, he was given an hour?s briefing on the ?Indian security perspective? in the war room at the defence headquarters today.

Army chief General N.C. Vij also had an hour?s talk 

with the visiting British officer. General Jackson has come with an agenda to 

intensify military-to-military programmes with India.

 ?On what is my first visit to India, it is evident that the defence relationship between the two countries is in excellent shape. And I look forward to working out ways to increase that cooperation when I meet Indian defence secretary Ajai Vikram Singh, the service chiefs and other senior members of the Indian armed forces,? the general said on arrival.

 British high commission sources said the general will take forward a discussion on bilateral defence initiatives in his meetings with the chiefs of the Indian armed forces. The talks will cover joint training, exchanges and defence equipment cooperation.

 The sources said three Royal Navy ships have visited India so far this year and a fourth visit is planned in Goa next month. There would be five visits of British naval vessels in 2005. A joint deployment command post exercise ? Exercise Emerald Mercury ? is planned for spring 2005 in India, following UK-Indian collaboration on joint operation planning courses.

 The two sides are also working on more exchange initiatives. Exercise observers, mountain and jungle warfare specialists, air crew, logistic experts and training instructors will be visiting each others? installations.

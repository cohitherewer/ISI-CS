 SC nod sought to open moonlit Taj

 moved the Supreme Court on Friday seeking permission to 

 throw the Taj Mahal open to tourists on moonlit nights during 

 the six-month-long Taj Mahotsav, which is expected to draw 

 a large number of tourists to Agra.

 In May 2000, the apex court had banned night-viewing of the Taj but said the issue could be considered after the state government made adequate arrangements for the safety of the 17th century world heritage monument maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India.

 The application was directed to be listed for hearing on Monday by a three-judge bench comprising Chief Justice R.C. Lahoti, Justice G.P. Mathur and Justice P.P. Naolekar when senior advocate Mukul Rohtagi mentioned it.

 The state government said the Taj Mahotsav would start from September 27 and continue till March 24 next year. The festival, marking the 350th year of the Taj, is expected draw a huge number of domestic and foreign tourists.

 Citing that the Supreme Court had relaxed the ban on night viewing of the Taj for three days on an earlier occasion, the state government said it had already made adequate security arrangements for the monument. The government requested the court to permit the world heritage monument to be opened on three nights ? the full moon night and the nights preceding and succeeding it.

 First test tube goat

 Karnal (PTI): The National Dairy Research 

 Institute here claimed on Friday to have produced a test 

 tube goat for the first time in the country. Institute director 

 Nagendra Sharma said the experiment was carried out to develop 

 knowhow to artificially establish pregnancies in goats using 

 invitro fertilisation through the laparoscopy technique.

 He said a team of scientists, comprising Dr Dhruba Malakar, Dr S.K. Das and Dr S.I. Gowami of the institute?s animal biotechnology centre, had been working on the project for the last three years.

 The scientists said oocytes isolated from ovaries collected from slaughterhouses were cultured in the laboratory and then fertilised. 

 The embryos were allowed to grow for a few days in the laboratory and then transferred to surrogate goats using laparoscopy.

 The scientists said the results had been confirmed through DNA finger printing of the surrogate parents. The technology developed could also be applied in advanced areas like animal cloning, they added.

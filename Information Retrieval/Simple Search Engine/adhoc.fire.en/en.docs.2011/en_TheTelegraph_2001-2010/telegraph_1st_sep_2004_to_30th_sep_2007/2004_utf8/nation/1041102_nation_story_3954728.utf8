 Bash costs Naqvi crown

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 1: Mukhtar 

 Abbas Naqvi was today dropped as BJP spokesperson, paying 

 the price for being ?irreverent? towards the Rashtriya Swayamsevak 

 Sangh.

 Party sources said Naqvi had committed a ?cardinal sin? by celebrating his birthday in style on the day swadeshi ideologue Dattopant Thengadi passed away. 

 Naqvi?s October 13 do had been planned in advance, but many in the BJP felt he would call it off when news of the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh founder?s death reached by early afternoon. Instead, he held a grand party at home, which was attended by media baron Subhash Chandra Goyal. The BJP stayed away, with only Arun Jaitley making an appearance.

 Sources said the former spokesperson had apparently thought that nobody in the BJP would mind if he went ahead with his bash as Thengadi had had several run-ins with Atal Bihari Vajpayee when he was Prime Minister. 

 However, things took a different turn. Vajpayee rushed to Pune to attend Thengadi?s funeral and the Sangh reportedly took serious note of Naqvi?s trespass. 

 Sources said had his mentor and former party president M. Venkaiah Naidu not intervened, Naqvi might have been dropped as party vice-president as well. He has also been retained in the 16-member central election committee that was reconstituted by the BJP?s new president, .K. Advani, today. 

 Sushma Swaraj has replaced Naqvi in Advani?s panel of spokespersons, which includes Jaitley, Yashwant Sinha and Manavendra Singh.

 In addition to V.K. Malhotra and Sushma, Bihar representatives Sushil Modi and Ravishankar Prasad were enlisted as spokespersons of the parliamentary party, who will brief the media when Parliament is in session. 

 The Bihar elections and the imperative of being aggressive towards Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Laloo Prasad Yadav seem to have prompted their inclusion.

 Uma Bharti found herself even more isolated today ? she did not figure either in the parliamentary board or the election committee. Her perceived rival, Shivraj Singh Chauhan, continues to be secretary of the parliamentary board and the election committee. He is also a general secretary.

 Sources said Chauhan is being put up as the new backward-class face of Madhya Pradesh because ?he is more mature and reasonable? and has the Sangh?s backing.

 Another significant change made today was the inclusion of Karnataka MP Ananth Kumar in the election committee.

 Girl shot man to prevent rape 

 Jamnagar (PTI): A girl confessed in a 

 court on Wednesday that she had shot a man who had tried 

 to rape her on September 20, though police had then registered 

 a case of suicide.

 According to police sources, labourer Guddu alias Krishnasinh from Bihar, who was staying as a tenant in the Nandanvan Society here, was found dead with a bullet shot in his forehead and the police had registered a suicide case. Later, they found that Guddu had been murdered.

 It was revealed that the 19-year-old daughter of the landlord had shot him after he allegedly pulled her into his room and tried to rape her.

 ?During the scuffle, the girl snatched his countrymade revolver and shot him,? the police said. The girl and her parents left for nearby Jamjodhpur after leaving the revolver by the side of his head.

 The girl was detained on Tuesday and confessed to having fired in self-defence.

 Her father said outside the court: ?I am proud 

 of my brave daughter who has done this in self-defence single 

 handedly.?

 Teacher faces abuse probe

 New Delhi (PTI): Delhi High Court on 

 Wednesday quashed the Delhi Music Society?s in-house inquiry 

 into the alleged sexual harassment of a 10-year-old girl 

 by a piano teacher and ordered a fresh probe by a retired 

 district judge.

 The order came on a writ petition filed by the girl?s mother earlier this year, describing the music society?s in-house inquiry as a ?sham?. She also questioned the reinstatement of the accused.

 She had urged the court to direct the Delhi government to order an independent inquiry against the music society and issue guidelines for the protection of minors from sexual harassment.

 The court has directed the parties concerned to jointly approach retired district judge Kanwal Inder within 15 days to start the inquiry. The report is to be submitted in a sealed cover to the court.

 The petitioner and the Delhi Music Society have agreed to share the cost of the inquiry proceedings.

 The accused, facing a criminal case, has been chargesheeted by the police.

 in court despite several notices. 

 Gujarat plea

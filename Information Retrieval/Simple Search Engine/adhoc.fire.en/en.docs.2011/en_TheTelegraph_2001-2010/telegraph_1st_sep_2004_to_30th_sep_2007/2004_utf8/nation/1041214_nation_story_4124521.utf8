 Mob fury after murder

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Dec. 13: The Rashtriya Janata Dal today rushed to calm the nerves of members of a minority community here after the murder of a person last night.

 Two unidentified persons shot dead Muhammad Farooq, a grocery dealer of Samanpura in the Rajabazar area, allegedly for his refusal to give in to their demand for extortion money. 

 After the incident, people of the locality went on the rampage, attacking police vehicles and setting at least seven vehicles, parked at the basement of an apartment building, on fire. Residents of the apartment rushed to the terrace for fear of their lives.

 The fire-fighters too had to face stiff resistance from the rioting crowd. 

 The police had to fight a pitched battle with the mob to bring the situation under control. Senior police officials, including deputy superintendent of police Arshad Jaman, were targeted by the mob and were forced to take shelter in a hospital nearby. Forced to beat a retreat, the police returned with additional forces to control the angry mob. 

 RJD parliamentarian from Patna Ram Kripal Yadav and party leader Ramanand Yadav rushed to the spot today to assure the people that the government would give Rs 10 lakh to the victim?s family, a job in the railways and a weapon licence.

 The protesters, who staged a sit-in on Bailey Road this morning, wanted the leaders to give the assurance in writing.

 The situation is totally under control now, Patna police said. Shastri Nagar police have registered a case against the unnamed criminals and the investigation has started. ?Efforts are on to arrest the culprits,? police sources said.

 ?This locality is known for violent incidents. The people here go mad even after an accident,? said a local cloth merchant.

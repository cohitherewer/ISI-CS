 Portugal court no to Monica release

 New Delhi, Nov. 16 (PTI): The Supreme Court of Portugal has dismissed a petition of Abu Salem?s girlfriend Monica Bedi seeking release after completion of her jail sentence of two years.

 The Portuguese court ruling comes even as the Central Bureau of Investigation here turned down a request for cancellation of extradition proceedings against the Bollywood actor.

 Bedi was sentenced to a two-year jail term in Portugal for entering that country on a forged document and continuing to use it for her stay there. The Bollywood actor had claimed in her petition to the Portuguese court that she had completed her sentence on September 17 and should, therefore, be released, according to CBI sources.

 However, the Portuguese prosecutor-general?s office challenged the actor?s petition. The prosecutor-general said Bedi is facing trial for extradition to India and should be kept in judicial custody, the sources said. 

 Earlier, a high court in Portugal had ruled that Bedi could be extradited to India for trial in a case related to possession of a forged passport.

 The actor had also recently written to President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh seeking pardon and allowing her to go to Norway where her parents are settled.

 The letter was handed over to the CBI for opinion, which suggested to the government that it would not be feasible to stop the extradition trial against her at this stage.

 In the letter to Kalam, Bedi has sought cancellation of all criminal proceedings initiated against her by the CBI and asked for a ?second chance?. She also apologised for forging her passport in Hyderabad. ?When the blasts took place, I was merely 16 years and was staying in Norway,? she said.

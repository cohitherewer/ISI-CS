 Warrant sword hangs on doctors

 CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA

 Mumbai, Nov. 20: A criminal court has issued non-bailable arrest warrants against six eminent doctors in Thane following a complaint of malpractice and misrepresentation of facts that led to the death of a patient. 

 The complaint is supported by People for Better Treatment, an organisation founded by Dr Kunal Saha in Calcutta that aims to probe medical malpractice. Rajiv Thakur, a member-advocate with the organisation, claims that anaesthesia administered by a non-specialist and subsequent malpractice led to the death.

 On November 16, the court of the judicial magistrate, Thane, issued the warrants against Dr V.P. Jog, Dr Sujata Rathod, Dr Anand Bhave, Dr Ganesh Mahajan, Dr Jaideep Mehta and Dr Sachin Dharane following a complaint made by Shasikant Kisan Vichare, whose wife Sashikala died last year. 

 The doctors, who have to be produced in court by December 3, are yet to be arrested. 

 According to the complaint made by Vichare, his 28-year-old wife was pregnant and was under the supervision of a doctor in Dombivli, who advised her to get registered with a hospital in Thane for the delivery. Vichare is an employee with a private firm and earns a salary of Rs 7,000. 

 The couple chose Dr Jog?s Maternity Nursing Home in Thane, where Sashikala went for a routine check-up on July 7 last year in the ninth month of her pregnancy. 

 The complaint says Sashikala was hurriedly told by Dr Rathod at 6.30 pm that an emergency caesarean operation needed to be performed on her. Her husband was asked to sign on the letter of consent immediately. 

 After Dr Jog administered anaesthesia to her, Sashikala was operated on at 8.30 pm and delivered a girl. She was under the general supervision of Dr Mahajan, the resident medical officer.

 Three days later, Sashikala developed severe chest pain. As facilities in the nursing home were not adequate, she was made to climb up and down 21 steps for an X-ray that had to be conducted twice. 

 Dr Bhave, a consultant at the nursing home who was called in, told the other doctors that wrong treatment had led to the deterioration of Sashikala?s condition, the complaint says. 

 He then advised Vichare to shift his wife to Lok Hospital, which had the necessary equipment to remove the congestion from her chest and where she would be cured within two days. He said it would cost him about Rs 15,000. 

 But Sashikala?s condition did not improve and the bills ran up to Rs 1,35,000 in 12 days. 

 When Vichare said he would not be able to pay, the treatment was discontinued for two days. He then obtained a letter from his company promising reimbursement. But there was no improvement in Sashikala?s condition and she died on October 10, 2003. 

 The hospital said she died of respiratory failure and pneumonia, but did not hand over the case papers. After two months, it sent bills of Rs 3,35,000 for 31 days of treatment. 

 Vichare got in touch with Thakur. He also lodged a complaint at Vartaknagar police station in November last year.

 Flock spots silver line

 Uma: Glimmer of hope?

 Bhopal, Oct. 17: Uma Bharti loyalists see a silver lining in the Maharashtra poll cloud on the BJP. 

 They are convinced the loss would trigger a chain reaction in the BJP at the national level which could bring Uma back to the party centrestage. 

 According to reports doing the rounds here, .K. Advani is frantically trying to get in touch with the sadhvi, camping in the Himalayas to fulfil her religious obligations. 

 There is also talk of Advani seeking the services of Uma?s Udupi-based spiritual guru, Pajeshwar Swamy, to prevail upon her to cut-down her 45-day sabbatical to meet political exigencies. 

 In the Madhya Pradesh Assembly byelections, too, the BJP suffered a setback, conceding Balaghat to the Congress. 

 Balaghat is in the heart of the Mahakaushal region, where the BJP had trounced the Congress in the December 2003 Assembly polls. 

 The BJP posted a thin victory at Nahota, where Dashrath Singh Lodhi pipped Ratnesh Solomon of the Congress. Ratnesh, a former state minister, is the brother-in-law of former Chhattisgarh chief minister Ajit Jogi. 

 The mood in the Uma camp here is one of cautious optimism. Legislators and party functionaries believe the sadhvi will bounce back as a key player in the BJP organisation. Their confidence stems from the possibility of Uma?s arch rivals Pramod Mahajan and BJP chief M. Venkaiah Naidu getting marginalised. They are also banking on support from the Vishwa Hindu Parishad. 

 VHP leaders Ashok Singhal and Giriraj Kishore came out strongly against the BJP leadership and attributed the poor performance in Maharashtra to discarding of ?Hindutva? issues. 

 Speaking in Patna, Singhal said: ?There is an urgent need for change in the leadership and the entire set up of the BJP and people who can vociferously talk about the well-being of the Hindu samaj should be brought to the helm.? 

 Both Singhal and Kishore criticised the BJP for ?downplaying? Uma?s tiranga yatra, which passed through Maharashtra but did not get the BJP?s backing. 

 Kishore claimed that ?emotive issues? were more important than topics like governance and development, which he claimed do not fetch votes. ?Neither the BJP nor the Shiv Sena had any issue that could influence people,? he said. 

 Not everyone in the state BJP shared the Uma camp?s optimism. 

 A senior functionary said much of Uma?s success in Madhya Pradesh was a result of the BJP?s backing. Uma, he said, has the ability to pull in the crowds, but she needs the party?s cadre to translate the numbers into votes. 

 He pointed to the tiranga yatra as a case in point, claiming that when it failed to get the party?s patronage in Maharashtra, it failed to make an impact.

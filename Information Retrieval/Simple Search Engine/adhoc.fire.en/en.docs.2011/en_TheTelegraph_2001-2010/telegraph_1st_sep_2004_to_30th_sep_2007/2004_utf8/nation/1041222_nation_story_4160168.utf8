 CM pitches for wife, ex-CM for friend

 Meera: Ready for battle

 Ranchi, Dec. 21: After the heavyweights, their ?favoured ones? and friends are donning battle gear to take potshots at politics.

 While chief minister Arjun Munda is keen to field wife Meera, his predecessor Babulal Marandi wants friend Manju Rai to contest the Assembly poll. 

 After a long time, Munda and Marandi, rumoured to have drifted apart, had a closed-door chat yesterday. What transpired at the meeting, however, remains a mystery.

 Today, they met BJP national general-secretary and Jharkhand affairs in-charge Rajnath Singh to thrash out future strategies. Munda is reportedly ?eyeing? Kharsawan, Jugsalai, Ghatshila and Chaibasa Assembly seats for himself and his wife. 

 In the recent months, he has campaigned extensively in these areas. While the Kharsawan Assembly seat is held by Munda, Jugsalai belongs to the JMM. The Congress won the Ghatshila and Chaibasa seats in the last poll. 

 Though little is known about Meera Munda?s political acumen, she has been accompanying her husband to all social dos. She shared a dais with BJP president L.K Advani at Morabadi ground on November 26 during the Mukhya Mantri Kanyadan Yojna.

 Rai, sources said, is interested in contesting the Kanke Assembly seat, which is held by the BJP?s Ram Chandra Nayak. Party workers had told BJP organisation general secretary Sanjay Joshi that the party would be forced to eat humble pie in Kanke if Nayak was fielded again. 

 However, party workers did not approve of Rai?s candidature. They contended that the candidate in Kanke should be closely associated with grassroots politics. Marandi?s rivals claim that Rai was the ?super chief minister? during his regime. 

 As Marandi is going to play a key role in ticket distribution, Rai?s candidature is being regarded with great curiosity. But, the BJP workers have no objection to Meera?s candidature. Sources say this is because she is interested in contesting only those seats which do not belong to the BJP.

 ?Munda may field his wife in Kharsawan and try his luck in Ghatshila or Chaibasa. It is almost certain that more than 50 per cent of our sitting MLAs are not going to win the Assembly election. The party ought to try out new faces and ensure proper representation of women candidates,? said a BJP member, known to be a regular visitor to the chief minister?s residence.

 State BJP chief Raghubar Das said a candidate?s prospect will be the main consideration for allotment of tickets. ?Ticket allotment will be finalised by the party high command. We will be forwarding the list of potential candidates ? be it Meera Munda, Manju Rai or anyone else ? to the party high command.?

 Rajnath Singh refused to comment. ?It is too early to talk about such things. As I have already said earlier, everything will be taken into account during ticket allotment. Now I am busy meeting my party leaders,? he said.

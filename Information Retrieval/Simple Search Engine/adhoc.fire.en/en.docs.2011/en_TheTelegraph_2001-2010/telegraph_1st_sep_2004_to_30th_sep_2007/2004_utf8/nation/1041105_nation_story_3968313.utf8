 Dilip arrest amp; Kabir exit on CPM plate

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Nov. 4: The Dilip case, which continues to cast a shadow on several CPM functionaries despite the leadership?s clean chit to Subhas Chakraborty yesterday, will figure prominently at the party?s state secretariat meeting tomorrow.

 Party officials said the secretariat members are expected to press chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to throw light on the transfer of police officer Humayun Kabir who arrested Dilip Banerjee, better known as hatkata Dilip, from footballer Sasthi Duley?s Hooghly house.

 As the CPM leadership sees it, Kabir?s transfer within hours of the arrest has begun to show the party in a poor light because, in popular perception, the party plotted his exit from the probe which could have sucked prominent functionaries into its vortex.

 ?There was a tacit agreement between the party and the government about easing out Kabir at an opportune time because he managed to embarrass both sides with his unconventional methods. As a matter of fact, some of Kabir?s superiors are unhappy with him for his penchant for doing things unilaterally. But what surprises the party is the timing of the transfer,? said a senior functionary.

 Apparently, Bhattacharjee, too, had informally expressed his unhappiness with Kabir?s style of functioning to several politburo and central committee members when certain details ? soon after Dilip?s arrest ? reached them in Delhi where they had gone for party meetings.

 Kabir was accused of ?unethical practice? earlier this year when Avtar Singh, the wife of CPM MP Jyotirmoyee Sikdar, was produced before photographers and detained for several hours at Bidhannagar (East) police station after a raid on his hotel before being arrested.

 But Bhattacharjee is believed to have assured leaders like Jyoti Basu, Anil Biswas and Biman Bose of an ?appropriate response? to the Kabir issue after a suitable gap of time.

 The chief minister, known to be critical of Chakraborty for his ?un-Marxist and controversial style of working?, however, maintained a studied silence on his party?s clean chit to his cabinet colleague. He refused to comment on the exoneration, though Chakraborty showered encomiums on the leadership, saying ?my faith in the party has further gone up?.

 Basu is expected to articulate the party?s stand on Kabir?s transfer. Sources said the secretariat chose not to have the issue discussed informally with the chief minister ? either over telephone or a one-to-one meeting ? because the party believes it calls for a fuller discussion at a party forum.

 Also, the secretariat might question the chief minister on Chakraborty?s observation that Dilip had been released from police custody just before the May parliamentary elections on the recommendation of one or more senior CPM leaders from North 24-Parganas.

 The idea behind such a query is to establish whether Dilip?s benefactors, perceived to be Chakraborty?s foes in the state CPM, were those who had reportedly accompanied Kabir on the raid on the footballer?s house from where the criminal was arrested.

 As it appears, the secretariat is largely convinced about Chakraborty?s assertion ? before Biswas and Bose who held an inquiry at the behest of Basu ? that he had no links with Dilip.

 Governor ruling

 New Delhi, Nov. 5 (PTI): The Supreme Court today sent a warning to politicians in power by ruling that a governor can sanction the prosecution of a minister for an illegal act even after the council of ministers has refused permission.

 This order will have a far-reaching impact on those taking refuge in decisions by the government not to sanction their prosecution.

 The judges thus allowed the prosecution of former Madhya Pradesh ministers Rajendra Kumar Singh and Bishau Ram Yadav, accused in a land scam. 

 The governor had sanctioned the duo?s prosecution although the council of ministers had decided against it.

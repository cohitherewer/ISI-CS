 Delhi drive to lure tourists 

 GARIMA SINGH 

New Delhi, Dec. 29: If the Indian government has its way, tsunami-hit Thai and Indonesian hotels and tourism firms are likely to take another hit, this time round from Indian tour operators trying to lure away their clients. 

 The Indian government has asked tour operators to contact stranded tourists in destinations ranging from Sri Lanka and Maldives to Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia to divert their stay to India. 

 The bait is an easy transit visa on arrival and the chance to continue their holiday in yet another exotic tropical locale unaffected by the crisis ? thanks to India?s vast size ? which the tsunami has sprung on parts of India and its Asian neighbours. 

 ?All tour operators have been asked to contact foreign tourists who had scheduled their vacations in Maldives, Sri Lanka and Thailand. I expect a lot of responses from Maldives to begin with,? Union tourism minister Renuka Chowdhury told The Telegraph.

 ?The stay can be easily extended from a week to 10 days or even longer,? she said, adding that the civil aviation and home ministries are working in close co-ordination with the tourism ministry on this project. 

 Chowdhury said the government hopes to get a ?good response? to the transit visa option very soon. These same tour operators initially organised trips to these destinations. It will, therefore, not be very difficult for them to track down these tourists. They are working round the clock,? she explained. 

 The decision to try and divert tourists to India was taken at a crucial meeting between Chowdhury, civil aviation minister Praful Patel and other senior officials of the tour and travel industry. 

 The government wants to sell destinations in the Thar desert, the Himalayas as well as beaches along the largely untouched west coast as part of the Incredible India drive it has been working on for the past one year. 

 The western media is describing Sri Lanka and Thailand as badly hit by the tsunami, while India is not getting the same kind of ?bad press?.

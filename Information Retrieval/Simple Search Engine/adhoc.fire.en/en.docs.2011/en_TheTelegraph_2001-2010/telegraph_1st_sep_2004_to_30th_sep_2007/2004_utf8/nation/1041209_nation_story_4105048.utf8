 Govt steam for ?tainted? ministers

 R. VENKATARAMAN

 New Delhi, Dec. 8: The Congress-led government has defended the ?tainted? ministers in the Union council, telling the Supreme Court that their inclusion in the council and continuing as ministers were ?not unconstitutional?.

 In an affidavit filed by the Union home secretary, the Centre said it was the Prime Minister?s prerogative to constitute his council of ministers. But the affidavit indicated that it was the parties making up the ruling coalition that decide which of their MPs should become ministers.

 ?There is at present a coalition government which has formed the United Progressive Alliance and there are various parties which are part of the present coalition government. The members of Parliament from such parties would be required to be considered for inclusion in the council of ministers if the parties so desire,? the affidavit said. ?The ultimate decision is taken by the Prime Minister whilst selecting his council of ministers,? the home secretary added.

 The affidavit was filed in response to a public interest litigation by Manoj Nirula seeking a Supreme Court directive to the Centre to remove ?tainted? ministers like Laloo Prasad Yadav, Shibu Soren and Mohammad Taslimuddin from the cabinet.

 The affidavit pointed out that the Constitution does not specifically ?bar? any person facing criminal charges from being appointed a minister. ?The constitution in terms has not provided for such an impediment or bar.?

 Asking for the PIL to be dismissed, the Centre said the proceedings were ?on the misconceived ground that the mere pendency of criminal proceedings against a minister runs foul of Article 75 (1) and Article 75(4) of the Constitution of India or in any manner violates the oath of office and secrecy taken under the Third Schedule?. 

 It added: ?Article 75 and the oath of office taken by the minister concerned in terms of the Third Schedule do not state that any person who has criminal proceedings pending against him has to be read as disqualification of being appointed a minister.

 ?It would be incorrect to read into the provisions of Article 75 such a disqualification when there is none in law.?

 Article 75 provides the Prime Minister shall be appointed by the President and the other ministers by the President on the Prime Minister?s advice. It adds that a minister who has not been a member of either House for six consecutive months shall cease to be a minister once that period is over. The affidavit thus argues that the ?only qualification? for a minister is that he or she should be an MP.

 Arrest push for Sangh unity

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, Nov. 23: The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh is likely to mediate to ?synergise? the agitational efforts of the BJP and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad against the Kanchi seer?s arrest, well-placed Sangh sources said.

 But the ?mediation? will occur at a ?later stage? when the RSS thinks the agitation has snowballed into an Ayodhya-like ?movement? with the potential to ?ignite the passions of Hindu samaj?.

 ?After all, before the Ram temple issue picked up, the BJP and the VHP worked separately. Once the political spin-offs were obvious, they coordinated their resources,? a Sangh source said.

 For the moment, the RSS is apparently content with the ?limited success? it has achieved in Tamil Nadu where it managed to bring the BJP, the VHP and the Hindu Munnani, another Sangh front, on the same platform.

 A bigger ?achievement? for the Sangh, the source said, was that the Kanchi episode forced the BJP to go ?back to basics (Hindutva)? faster than the moderates would have wanted.

 Before the party could ruminate on the finer points of hardline-moderate politics, the Kanchi seer?s arrest brought the representatives of the two schools of thought on a common dais.

 If BJP chief L.K. Advani and former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee genuflected before guru Asaram Bapu, Jaswant Singh ? who supped with the likes of US leaders Strobe Talbott and Colin Powell ? rubbed shoulders with the tantrik, Shri Shri 1008 Kapalik Mahakaal Bhairavanand Saraswati.

 Also, Advani, Vajpayee and Murli Manohar Joshi appeared together long after posters of the BJP ?trimurti? were consigned to the dustbin of the party?s history.

 ?The BJP?s return to Hindutva could not have happened at a more opportune moment because the RSS was under great pressure to take sides,? a Sangh source said. ?The VHP was threatening to float a new pro-Hindutva party if the BJP insisted on being moderate. Now the RSS can tell the VHP that the BJP was true to its character.?

 Things reached a head at the RSS? national executive in Haridwar earlier this month where VHP supremo Ashok Singhal shunned a session at which Advani was present. ?He (Singhal) had reasons to feel hurt because he was ill-treated by the BJP when in power,? the source said.

 But if the RSS had to choose between Singhal and Advani-Vajpayee, the Sangh, the sources said, would root for the latter. ?It is because of the quality of these individuals. Singhal has his limitations,? the source said.

 The RSS has also ?made it amply clear to the VHP that if they float a party, we will not support it?, the sources added.

 In return for its unstinted support, the RSS has extracted from the BJP brass the promise of a return to Hindutva.

 ?Advani and Vajpayee figured out that if they cannot keep the cadre and the core constituency together, there is not much of a future for their party. If they lose their core voters and are unsure of the fringe ones, they will fall between two stools,? the source said.

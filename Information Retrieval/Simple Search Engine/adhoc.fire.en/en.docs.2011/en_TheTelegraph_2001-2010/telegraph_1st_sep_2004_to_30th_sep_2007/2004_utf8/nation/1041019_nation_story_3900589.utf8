 B-brains for Modi policy

 Ahmedabad, Oct. 18: Having failed to transform Gujarat into a ?techno-savvy state?, the government is planning to pick the brains of B-school students to draw up a new IT policy, reports our special correspondent.

 At Confluence-2004, a three-day meet at IIM Ahmedabad, the state will ?use the expertise of the best brains of the world?? in formulating and revising its information technology policy. This is the reason it chose to be a partner at the annual meet, the biggest B-school event in the Asia-Pacific region, beginning Friday.

 Big names in the industry like Alan Rosling (executive director, Tata Sons), Sankalp Saxena (managing director, i2 Technologies) and Rajiv Mody (chairman, Nasscom) are expected to attend the event to be inaugurated by former information technology and commerce minister Arun Shourie. The panel will discuss the theme, Future Direction for the Indian IT Industry.

 The government had established Gujarat Informatics Limited in 1999 to act as the nodal agency to promote information technology and e-governance. However, Gujarat could not create an atmosphere as conducive to investment in the sector as the southern states.

 The inputs gathered at Confluence-2004 are expected to make a difference. ?That is because they (the participants) know the latest global trends in the IT industry,?? said Gujarat Informatics managing director Anil Mukhim, who is also the additional principal secretary to chief minister Narendra Modi.

 The organisation had asked the IIM-A students to come up with concrete recommendations. Students from 12 management schools from India and abroad ? including IIM-A, Bangalore and Calcutta, the National Institute of Singapore and the Richard Ivey School of Business, Canada ? will look into the problems faced by the nodal agency.

 The solutions, to be put in a report titled Gujarat Informatics Limited: Success Of State Intervention, will go into shaping the new information technology policy.

 The teams, which have submitted papers on this subject, will be judged on the basis of the depth of analysis and usefulness to the organisation. The final presentation will be made to a panel of IIM-A faculty and representatives from the nodal agency.

 ?It is a win-win situation for the students as well as GIL,?? said Mukhim. Students will be able to deal with a real-life case where a state is trying to improve its information technology initiatives and make itself an IT destination, he said. The state will get to know the global trends and practices in information technology across the world. These inputs from the future managers and policy-makers will provide the government a ?holistic perspective??.

 The IIM-A students ? the organisers of the event ? gain by associating with the state government. ?All along we have been a B-school event. Now, we want to grow to become a management summit where we have greater partnership from industry. The fact that we have tied up with GIL is one step towards that,?? says Niranjan Rao, joint co-ordinator, Confluence-2004.

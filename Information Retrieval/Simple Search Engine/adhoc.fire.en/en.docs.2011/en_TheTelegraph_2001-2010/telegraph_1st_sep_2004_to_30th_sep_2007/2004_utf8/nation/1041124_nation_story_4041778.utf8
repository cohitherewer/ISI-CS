 Drug abuse scare looms on Punjab

 GAJINDER SINGH 

 Chandigarh, Nov. 23: After militancy, Punjab has to contend with another menace ? drug trafficking ? with nearly 40 per cent of its youths hooked to drugs.

 Information gleaned from various government departments reveals that drug abuse is not limited to some pockets but has spread throughout the state, cutting across religion, caste and occupation.

 Even in the mid-nineties, according to the state?s human development report for 2004, which cites earlier statistics from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, of the country?s 2.5 million addicts, one million were in Punjab.

 Latest figures with the government point to a scary future. Chief minister Amarinder Singh cited a state-sponsored secret survey in Ludhiana which revealed that 67 per cent of boys and 52 per cent of girls in schools and colleges were hooked to some drug or the other. ?A national policy should be framed to tackle the menace,? the worried leader said.

 Sources said the government would ask the Centre for help to tackle the problem.

 A survey conducted a couple of months ago in the state?s three regions ? Malwa, Doaba and Majha ? revealed the presence of at least one addict in 66 per cent of households. Nearly 40 per cent of the addicts fall in the 15-25 age group. ?While derivatives of opium are the choice in Majha and Malwa, tranquillisers are the most favoured in Doaba,? a senior officer said.

 Village health personnel are said to be sources of drugs and intoxicants, while quacks, chemists and grocery shops act as conduits. The police claim those too poor to afford drugs make do with snakebites.

 While the civil administration grapples with the problem, the Sikh clergy has been asked to educate the masses against the evils of drug abuse. The Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee, an independent body that manages the community?s religious interests, has asked employees to narrate teachings of the Sikh gurus against drug consumption.

 The state?s social security, women and child development department is the nodal agency to deal with drug abuse. An action plan involving the departments of health and family welfare, home, education and public relations has been chalked out. But with little grant from the government, the department?s activities remain on paper.

 ?We have only seven drug inspectors and two assistants when we need at least 72,? said an official of the health and family welfare department.

 The police blame smugglers from Pakistan for flooding Punjab with drugs.

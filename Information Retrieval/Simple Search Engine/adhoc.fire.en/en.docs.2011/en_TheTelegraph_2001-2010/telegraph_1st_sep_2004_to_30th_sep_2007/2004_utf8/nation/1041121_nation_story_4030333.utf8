 Pervez slams Delhi vibes

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Islamabad, Nov. 20: A day after accusing India of failing to show flexibility on solving the Kashmir dispute, Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf ruled out a unilateral change in his country?s position.

 ?We are ready to meet India half-way, not all the way, to discuss with sincerity and an open mind different options and solutions for the Kashmir dispute,? Musharraf told a gathering of South Asian journalists, organised by the South Asia Free Media Association (Safma) in Lahore.

 In an interview to a foreign wire service yesterday, the Pakistan President had expressed disappointment at the signals emanating from India. He again told a seminar: ?I see a light at the end of the tunnel. There is hope, but vibes from across the border are not encouraging.?

 Musharraf said: ?All the talk of Kashmir being an integral part of India, the reference to the Indian Constitution and the refusal to think of redrawing the map of Kashmir are all negative vibes from across the border.?

 His remark was an obvious reference to a statement made by Manmohan Singh during his maiden visit to Srinagar. On Wednesday, the Prime Minister had made it clear that India would not accept any proposal about Kashmir that entailed redrawing of international boundaries.

 Emphasising the need for reciprocity, Musharraf said Pakistan would never step back from its stated positions ? the implementation of the 1948 UN resolutions and plebiscite in the Valley ? unilaterally.

 However, he added, the ongoing dialogue process would lose pace if both sides remained rigid on their ?maximalist stated positions?.

 ?Let us pick up courage and resolve to look at all options with an open mind,? the President said.

 Last month, Musharraf, who also holds the post of army chief, proposed a gradual demilitarisation of Kashmir as an option to settle the decades-old problem.

 The two countries are set to begin a second round of talks later this month that will include issues ranging from Jammu and Kashmir, peace and security and nuclear and conventional confidence-building measures to promotion of trade ties and communication links.

 This will be followed by foreign secretary-level talks. Pakistan has proposed that the meetings be held on December 21 and 22. Foreign ministry officials said India?s response on the dates is awaited.

 Musharraf said Pakistan supports the commencement of bus services between the two countries, including one between Muzaffarabad and Srinagar. However, he added, Pakistan is averse to people from Indian-administered Kashmir crossing the Line of Control with Indian passports.

 Pakistan had initially proposed that those travelling between the two Kashmirs carry UN documents.

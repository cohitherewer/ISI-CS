 Transfer cloud on riot top cop 

 ALOKE TIKKU

 New Delhi, Sept. 25: P.C. Pande, the former Ahmedabad police chief whose appointment to the CBI was as controversial as the role of police during the post-Godhra riots, is likely to be moved out of the agency.

 The Gujarat-cadre IPS officer had taken over as additional director in the CBI this March, weeks before the NDA lost the elections. Six months on, there are indications Pande might be pushed up the police hierarchy and out of the CBI.

 Pande?s case is quite like P.S. Pasricha, the IPS officer in Maharashtra who took over as Mumbai police commissioner in November 2003 but found himself out of the post three months later on a promotion. He was posted as director general, Police Housing Corporation. A PIL filed in Bombay High Court against Pasricha?s ouster was dismissed after the state government contended he was promoted this February in conformity with rules. 

 It was argued that the Mumbai police commissioner was of the rank of additional DG, lower than the DG-rank, but that he had come to enjoy the promotion.

 A PIL is also pending in the Supreme Court in Pande?s case. But it opposes his appointment in the CBI since the bureau was handling investigations into the Gujarat carnage.

 Last month, hearings were adjourned till October after solicitor-general Vahanvati informed the court that Pande was not involved in the riot probe. Pande handles economic offences that include investigations into the Telgi fake stamp paper scam.

 Pande had recently deposed before the Nanavati Commission probing the riots. He said he did not remember details of the events. He had also denied that he knew former MP Ehsan Jafri or had got a call from him. Pande was the Ahmedabad police chief when the city was in flames. Jafri?s family had alleged he assured he would protect them but never did. Jafri was killed by rioters hours later.

 Pande?s deposition had come in for media criticism but his supporters say he is caught in political crossfire. Former chief justice J.S. Verma, who visited Gujarat after the riots as chairman of the National Human Rights Commission, had commented that Pande could have acted under pressure.

 After a lecture rapping CBI officers for not using the independence given to them, Verma had advised Pande in full public view to ?listen to your conscience? in the CBI as ?you don?t have such pressures as you had in Gujarat police?.

 However, the indications that Pande may not remain in the CBI too long are clear. He is due to be promoted to a DGP-rank post ? he has been empanelled and is awaiting his turn according to seniority ? but his name is not on the two-member list sent to a committee headed by the Central Vigilance Commission for appointment as special director.

 Within the CBI, there are suggestions that Pande?s imminent transfer makes a mockery of the protection given to senior officers by the Supreme Court and raises questions on the effectiveness of the bureau?s selection procedures.

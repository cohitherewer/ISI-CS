 SC reserves order on nod for probe

 New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Wednesday reserved order on a petition challenging the ?single directive? that barred an agency like the CBI from probing corruption charges against an officer of the rank of joint secretary and above without government permission, reports our legal correspondent.

 The court reserved its verdict after hearing senior counsel Anil Baburao Dewan, appointed amicus curiae in the case to assist the court.

 The petition, filed by Janata Party president Subramanian Swamy, relates to investigations into the over Rs 3,000-crore Indian Bank scam in which powerful politicians and several former and present ministers are allegedly involved.

 The Centre for Public Interest Litigations also joined issue with counsel Prashant Bhushan filing a petition challenging the incorporation of the ?single directive? in the new Central Vigilance Commission Act.

 The United Front government, which came to power in 1996, had brought the ?single directive?. In case of banks, the post of branch manager was made equivalent to that of a joint secretary. So, to investigate a branch manager in a scam, prior sanction was needed from the finance ministry.

 The apex court had quashed this order but by that time the BJP-led NDA government had taken charge at the Centre. The NDA regime brought an ordinance, which again contained the single directive clause. The bill was later passed in Parliament with the clause intact.

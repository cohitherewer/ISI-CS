 Nepal spanner in extradition

 ALOKE TIKKU

New Delhi, Sept. 5: Nepal is likely to agree 

to a clause in the proposed treaty with India to extradite nationals of other 

countries but has stood its ground over not allowing Nepalis wanted for crimes 

in India to be extradited.

 Delhi and Kathmandu held talks late last month in an unsuccessful attempt to finalise the draft extradition treaty in time for Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba to sign the treaty on his India visit next week.

 Deuba begins his visit on Wednesday but it is not clear if he will stay till Sunday as originally planned after the murder of 12 Nepalis hostages in Iraq sparked off protests back home.

 The two countries have been negotiating a new extradition treaty to replace the 1953 treaty that is restrictive and does not cover many crimes. That only one person has been extradited to India in the last 50 years indicates the ineffectiveness of the treaty.

 India sought to have extradition of each others national and third-country nationals included in the treaty when talks began more than a year ago to expand the list of offences for which a criminal can be extradited. The existing provisions only notify 17 conventional crimes including murder, rape and arson as extraditable offences.

 In course of last months talks, the two sides broadly agreed to include extradition of third country nationals on the lines of the model extradition treaty drafted by the UN. But the two sides have not got around to finalising the draft because of Delhis insistence that the new treaty cover Nepalis who flee to the Himalayan kingdom after crimes in India.

 Nepal has argued that accepting this demand would compromise its sovereignty. But India has said Kathmandu should be practical instead of taking an ideological stance.

 Singapore model for Orissa

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Dec. 2: Orissa will follow in the footsteps of Hong Kong and Singapore to effectively check corruption.

 At the annual conference of the vigilance department here, chief minister Naveen Patnaik said some of the successful models of Southeast Asian countries have proved that investment in anti-corruption agencies yields rich dividends. 

 The joint mission of the World Bank and DFID, which has collaborated with the government for fiscal reforms and good governance, had recommended higher budgetary support and incentives for the vigilance department and its personnel.

 Patnaik said the government will give serious thought to such proposals so that the morale and motivation of vigilance officials are not allowed to erode. 

 Hong Kong?s Independent Commission Against Corruption was successful in removing corruption from the highest echelons of power. Similar is the record of Singapore?s anti-corruption agency, the Corrupt Practices Investigation Board. 

 The message of Singapore and Hong Kong?s successful campaigns to eliminate corruption was clear: zero tolerance. The underlying idea was that once corruption takes hold, as these economies have experienced, it can spin out of control and threaten the entire fabric of a society, weakening development prospects in a disturbing and dangerous manner. 

 Stressing the achievements of the vigilance department in the past two years, officials said in 2002, cases were lodged against 54 IAS, IPS, OAS and IFS officers. In 2003, the number of cases went up to 207.

 Patnaik said the vigilance division opened this year for the KBK region with its headquarters at Jeypore will help supervise and monitor development projects there, he said.

 He said the government could also set up vigilance offices in six more districts of the state. These districts are Malkangiri, Jagatsinghpur, Nuapada, Deogarh, Sambalpur and Boudh. Besides, vigilance squads in 10 districts will be upgraded to regular offices.

 The conference also discussed the problem of vacant posts in the department. 

 There are a number of vacancies in the posts of superintendents of police, deputy superintendents and inspectors, besides others.

 Mumbai, Sept. 21 (PTI): Bombay High Court today allowed Iqbal Kaskar, younger brother of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, and MLA Anil Gote to file nominations from prison for the Assembly elections in Maharashtra.

 Kaskar, lodged in the central prison here in a case of extortion, sought permission to file his nomination from Umerkhedi and Nagpada constituencies in south Mumbai while Gote, housed in Pune?s Yerawada prison in the fake stamp paper case, said he would file his nomination from Dhule. 

 Both were held under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act.

 Earlier in the day, a special court rejected Kaskar?s petition seeking police protection to file his nomination from Umerkhedi and Nagpada. Prosecutor Rohini Salian opposed his plea to go to file nominations in the special court, saying that there was threat to his life from rival gangs. She also expressed fear that he may escape from police custody if he was released to file his nomination. 

 Designated judge A.P. Bhangale disallowed police protection on the grounds that the accused was the brother of a fugitive wanted in the 1993 blasts and that he had underworld connections.

 Kaskar then moved the high court, which said there was no need for him to go personally to file his nomination and he could do so from the prison through the jail superintendent.

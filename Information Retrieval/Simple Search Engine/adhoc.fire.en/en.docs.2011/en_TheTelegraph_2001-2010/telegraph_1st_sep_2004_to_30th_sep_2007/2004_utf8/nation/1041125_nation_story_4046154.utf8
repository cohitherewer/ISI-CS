 Naxalites line up rally in Delhi

 KAY BENEDICT

 New Delhi, Nov. 24: The CPI (Maoist) today said it was not averse to talking to the Centre if invited even as it was refused permission to organise its first-ever procession in Delhi.

 Maoist leaders, however, said they did not think the United Progressive Alliance government would like to have negotiations with them.

 The rally organisers had sought clearance from Delhi police 20 days ago. They were informed today that they could not hold the procession, said Varavara Rao, revolutionary poet and Maoist sympathiser.

 The Naxalite outfit, however, will go ahead with a public meeting tomorrow though there is no confirmation whether it has police clearance or not.

 The CPI (Maoist), formed in September by the merger of the People?s War and the Maoist Communist Centre, had planned to venture out of villages to spread the revolutionary message among city dwellers. The public meeting and the procession were aimed towards that end.

 The meeting, scheduled to be held at the Ferozshah Kotla ground, will be addressed by revolutionary singer Gadar, All India League for Revolutionary Culture general secretary Raj Kishore, and World Peoples? Resistance Movement convener Tara Singh.

 The Maoists are also planning a rally each in Patna on December 5 and Calcutta on December 15. The first rally was held in Hyderabad in September.

 Maoist leaders, whose second round of talks with the Andhra Pradesh government is scheduled for February, said chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy had emphasised the agenda would include giving up of arms by the Naxalites.

 They had earlier rejected the demand. Rao, however, said in reply to a question today that the Naxalites were ready to lay down arms for the period of the talks.

 The state government had asked for two months? time to hold the second round of talks as it first wanted to distribute 1 lakh surplus acres among the landless on January 26, 2005.

 Tracing the communist and revolutionary movements across the world and the country, Rao said the Maoists did not have faith in the parliamentary system as it had failed to solve people?s problems.

 Knives honed on session-eve

 New Delhi, Nov. 30: The winter session of Parliament begins tomorrow under the shadow of the Bihar and Jharkhand elections, with the NDA and the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) gearing up to score brownie points over who is more ?tainted?.

 Keen to live down the charge of being an ?irresponsible? Opposition ? after it paralysed the first two House sessions under the United Progressive Alliance government ? the BJP has decided to get into action by protesting against price rise tomorrow. 

 A rally at the Ram Lila ground will be addressed by party leaders, including Atal Bihari Vajpayee and L.K. Advani, before they court token arrests. The BJP has also served a notice under Rule 184 for discussion on the hike in the prices of petrol, diesel and LPG. If the discussion is allowed, it could embarrass the Left because it entails voting.

 Briefing reporters, BJP deputy leader in the Lok Sabha V.K. Malhotra said: ?In the 180 days of this government, the communists have criticised it every day, sometimes several times. But they continue to stick to it. We want to call their bluff through such a discussion because they will have to show on which side their sympathy lies.?

 The Left, too, has decided to raise the price hike along with increase in railway freight charge, allowing FDI in banks and 100 days? work in the proposed Employment Guarantee Scheme.

 Despite an optimistic Ghulam Nabi Azad predicting a ?smooth? session, the crunch is expected on day three or four when the BJP is set to bring up two controversial subjects: the reinduction of JMM leader Shibu Soren in the cabinet and arrest of Kanchi seer Jayendra Saraswati. 

 ?He (Soren) will have to appear in the courts in Delhi and Ranchi where he will be summoned as a criminal. This is an unfortunate situation and it has damaged whatever little credibility there existed of the Manmohan Singh government,? Malhotra said.

 A decision on whether the NDA will continue its ?boycott? of ?tainted? ministers, including railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav, will be taken at a meeting tomorrow.

 The BJP?s calculation is that once it raises Soren?s reinstatement, the RJD may bring up allegations levelled against a senior BJP leader by a former family member ? as threatened by Laloo Prasad. ?If that happens, we cannot guarantee whether the House will function,? said a BJP source. 

 ?We want the House to run because we want a debate on our issues. But if they (the UPA) raise things against our leaders, naturally we will protest aloud,? Malhotra said.

 The BJP had also planned to cash in on the row between Laloo Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan to expose the ?divisions? in the ruling coalition. 

 ?Never in any democracy the world over has it happened that senior cabinet ministers have levelled charges against each other. Laloo wants a CBI probe against Paswan. He said ?if I show all the files against him, no mortal on earth will be able to save him?. If that?s the case, why is the PM shielding Paswan? What is happening is unconstitutional. If a government cannot be run as per the Constitution, it should go,? said Malhotra.

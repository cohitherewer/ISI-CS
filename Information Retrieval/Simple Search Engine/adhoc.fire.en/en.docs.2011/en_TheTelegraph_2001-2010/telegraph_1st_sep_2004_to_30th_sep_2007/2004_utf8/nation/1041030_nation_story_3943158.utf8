 Message twist to Godhra riots

 Ahmedabad (PTI): A police inspector 

 has told the Godhra commission that he could not convey 

 any information about mob attacks on February 27 and March 

 1, 2002, as the police control room was not receiving any 

 wireless message.

 Inspector .K. Barot, posted at Bapunagar police station, told the commission of retired Justices G.T. Nanavati and K.G. Shah probing the Godhra train carnage and its aftermath that he ?could not send a wireless message about the several incidents as the police control room was only giving messages to policemen and not receiving them?.

 Barot was replying to a question raised by advocate Mukul Sinha of the Jan Sangarsh Manch, who wanted to know why the inspector did not inform the control room that he was gheraoed by a crowd of 8,000 on the first two days of rioting.

 Asked if the police control room was intimated about the one-way communication during the riots, Barot replied in the negative.

 He said 22 FIRs of rioting incidents were registered in Bapunagar police station and 27 people, including 19 Hindus and eight Muslims, had died.

 Baby-killer arrest claim

 Jalandhar (PTI): Police claim to have 

 arrested an alleged serial baby-killer, who had been terrorising 

 residents with frequent incidents of abduction, rape and 

 murder of children.

 District police chief G.P.S. Bhullar said the accused identified as Darbara Singh, in his early fifties, was allegedly responsible for kidnapping as many as 21 children, out of whom 17 were raped and killed.

 The police constituted a special team and prepared a computer-generated sketch of the suspected killer following a number of such incidents, he said. 

 The team recently got a tip-off that a person matching the description and movements of the serial baby-killer had been sighted at Basti Bawa Khel, Bhullar said. A special policy party was immediately deployed at strategic points to intercept and interrogate suspects matching the description.

 Finally, the police intercepted a person riding a bicycle and carrying a bag containing a handful of toffees, the officer said. He was arrested after the police grilled him for several hours.

 Haj invite for victims? kin

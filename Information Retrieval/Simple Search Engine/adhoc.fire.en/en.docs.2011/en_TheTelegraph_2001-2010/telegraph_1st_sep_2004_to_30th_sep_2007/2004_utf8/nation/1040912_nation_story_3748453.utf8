 Smooch starlet stomps out

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, Sept. 11: Hold her hands, get close, but ? for heaven?s sake ? don?t kiss her on the lips. Even if you are playing man and wife and it?s night on the sets.

 Tollywood comedian Rajendra Prasad has learnt that even an accidental brushing of lips ? as he claims it may have been ? can inflame, not the passion, but the wrath of your co-star when Bollywood damsel Shweta Konnur stormed out of the Telugu film Appa Rao Driving School.

 Not only did she walk out of the sets after the Thursday incident, she also flew out of Hyderabad by the first available flight to Mumbai.

 Shweta said she was vexed with the repeated retakes that director Anji Sreenu insisted on and that during one of the retakes, Prasad kissed and also ?physically assaulted? her.

 The producer, Gopal Reddy, tried to pacify the actor and her entourage but could not stop them from leaving.

 Shweta, who was on a weeklong shoot in the Andhra capital for the film, also complained of misbehaviour by her screen partner and others.

 Prasad claims he did not do anything wrong. ?I have been instructed by dance director Swarna and director Sreenu to appear more intimate during the shoots. After all it was the first night scene of a married couple. I might have accidentally brushed her lips while turning my face. I had no bad intentions,? he said.

 But Shweta differs. Without taking any names, she said several people had demanded sexual favours from her. ?There were hints from even the co-actor and the director,? she fumed. ?They offered more footage and also another song.?

 This is not the first time that male Tollywood figures have been accused of misbehaviour. Last year, Coca-Cola girl and Bollywood actor Shilpa Shivanand was slapped by producer-director Mohan Babu for not doing a kissing scene in the film Vishnu.

 Mohan Babu had also prevented the actor from leaving Hyderabad after she filed a police complaint against him. The case was resolved only after Sakshi Shivanand, Shilpa?s actor sister, and producer-director Dasari Narayan Rao, now a Union minister, intervened. Jayanti, a popular Kannada actor, had also accused Mohan Babu of ill treatment.

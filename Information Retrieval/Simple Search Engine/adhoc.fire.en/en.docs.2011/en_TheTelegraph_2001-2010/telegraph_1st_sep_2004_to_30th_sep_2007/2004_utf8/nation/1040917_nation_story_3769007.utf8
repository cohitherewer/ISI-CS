The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Cricket telecast back-up poser

 OUR BUREAU

 Sept 16: Cricket authorities will seek a clarification from the court whether they can prepare a contingency plan if the dispute between Zee Telefilms and ESPN-STAR is not resolved soon.

 SAB TV, a free-to-air entertainment channel, joined the case in Bombay High Court today, throwing its weight behind Zee.

 Yesterday, Bombay High Court had asked the Board of Control for Cricket in India to maintain status quo on award of telecast rights for four years beginning next month until the case filed by ESPN is settled. ESPN had challenged the BCCI?s decision to give the contract to Zee.

 After a meeting of the working committee in Calcutta today, BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya said: ?We need to get clarifications from the court on whether we can prepare a back-up plan.? 

 He said the BCCI needs to know what exactly the court means by ?status quo? and, only after some clarity is achieved on this, will it make a move on the possibility of a contingency telecast plan.

 A senior BCCI official was confident that the case would be settled before October 6 when the first Test starts against the Australians but kept open the option of asking the court to give the board interim relief from yesterday?s order if the dispute lingered beyond that.

 Interim relief will mean permission to make temporary arrangements to show the matches through a third party, a possibility Zee and ESPN have opposed.

 Dalmiya?s comment about seeking the court?s clarification falls within this course of action. Yesterday, the BCCI declined to make a commitment in court not to call in a third party to beam the Australia series because it said it would fall foul of International Cricket Council rules under which live telecast has to be organised for the third umpire. 

 ?We are also conscious of the fact that the public will beat us up, if cricket is not shown,? said the BCCI official speaking on condition of anonymity.

 Asked when he expected the clarification, Dalmiya said since the matter was in the hands of the court, the timeframe could not be predicted. The BCCI?s effort now is to see that the case is settled quickly. It decided to ask its lawyers to assist the court in ?expeditious disposal?.

 Bombay High Court showed how eager it was to get through with the case when it held a hearing today, though an adjournment was made till September 21. The judges heard ESPN?s arguments why the contract should not be awarded to Zee, but the truly unexpected element was introduced by an intervention application by SAB TV, owned by Sri Adhikari Brothers.

 Ram Jethmalani, appearing for SAB, said ESPN should prove its own eligibility before questioning that of Zee. The case took on a swadeshi Zee versus videshi ESPN hue when he argued that the sports channel should provide the details of its composition since it declares itself as being a ?joint venture through subsidiaries?.

 Behind the argument lies the hint that it is a foreign company ? Jethmalani said ESPN does not pay its taxes in India.

 Arjun research push

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 22: Human resource development minister Arjun Singh has granted reprieve to research scientists who were left in the cold when the National Democratic Alliance was in power.

 Singh ticked off the University Grants Commission and revived its research scientist scheme, which had become defunct because of a standoff between the UGC and the scientists. ?The faulty implementation of the programme, particularly in the last five years, has caused serious friction between the scientists and the UGC, leading to a number of litigations in various courts,? said a ministry note. 

 ?The HRD ministry has directed the UGC to withdraw the cases against the scientists and asked it to reintroduce the scheme with a view to promote high standards of research in science and humanities.? 

 A panel has been set up under scientist C.N.R. Rao to work out the modalities.

 Nine scientists had taken the UGC to court for arbitrary termination of their services. The UGC kept filing case after case despite losing each time. 

 Launched by the UGC in 1983-84, the scheme provided research facilities to 200 scholars ? 100 each in science and social science. After five years, their work was evaluated before giving them an extension. The UGC supported the researchers in grades A, B and C ? equivalent to the posts of lecturer, reader and professor. 

 In 1999, when Hari Gautam was appointed by minister Murli Manohar Joshi to head the UGC, nine scientists complained of harassment by review committees that decided on promotions. ?The review committees, after meetings with the scholars, described their work as unsatisfactory and terminated their contracts,? said an official.

 S.K. Jain was a research scientist in IIT Delhi. In 1995, he was promoted from lecturer to reader following ?excellent? annual reports. In 1999, his services were terminated. At the UGC?s behest, IIT sealed Jain?s office even after Delhi High Court told the commission to pay his salary.

 Social science scholar Anita Rampal?s work was evaluated in 1999 by educationist Anil Sadgopal who recommended a promotion. But she was called for two more reviews and shown the door in 2001.

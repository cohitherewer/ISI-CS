 Dropout scanner on states 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 1: The 

 human resource development ministry is tightening the noose 

 around state governments over school dropout figures.

 The Centre has decided to send an independent team to evaluate the number of children who have dropped out of primary schools in the states.

 The decision comes after the government found serious discrepancies in the figures sent by states like Bengal, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan.

 ?We will identify independent agencies which will evaluate the implementation of Sarva Siksha Abhiyan (SSA), a programme for universalisation of elementary education),? a senior ministry official said.

 According to the officials, the total number of dropouts that stood at 61 lakh on December 31 last year has now jumped to 70-80 lakh on the basis of fresh data sent by the states.

 The ministry attributes the sharp rise to a deliberate reduction in the dropout numbers sent by the states during Murli Manohar Joshi?s tenure.

 After taking charge as HRD minister, Arjun Singh had asked the states to re-examine the numbers because there was a question mark over the sudden drop in the number of children out of schools.

 Last week, ministry officials held a two-day meeting with state representatives who submitted new figures of dropouts. The numbers showed a startling rise that the ministry found difficult to explain by normal standards.

 For instance, the number of dropouts in Bengal has gone up from 4.39 lakh to 10 lakh; in Bihar, from 7.46 lakh to 29.8 lakh; in Uttar Pradesh, from 2.10 lakh to 7.27 lakh, and in Rajasthan, from 62,000 to 3 lakh.

 These have traditionally been the ?problem? states where the growth of primary education has been particularly sluggish as their governments have found it difficult to contain the number of dropouts.

 The Centre believes getting a correct picture of the situation would not be possible unless it has an independent mechanism to assess and monitor the implementation of the SSA.

 Officials at the Centre maintain that the states have to carry out the primary work of the SSA because education is on the concurrent list.

 The HRD ministry is essentially relying on the project to reach its goal of universalisation of elementary education.

 Officials pointed out there has been some improvement in Bengal and Uttar Pradesh in areas like teachers? appointments but Bihar continued to rely massively on people who are not fully qualified to teach.

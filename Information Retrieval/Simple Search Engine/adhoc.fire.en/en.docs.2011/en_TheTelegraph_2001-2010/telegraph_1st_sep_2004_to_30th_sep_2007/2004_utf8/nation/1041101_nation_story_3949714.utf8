 Bengal in race for DVC crown

 INDRANIL GHOSH

 Calcutta, Oct. 31: Jharkhand and Bengal are locked in a tussle over the appointment of the chairman of the Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC), one of the few profitable state-run power utilities in the country.

 The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government favours the appointment of its transport secretary, Sumantra Chowdhury, as the chief of the DVC, jointly owned by the Centre and the governments of Bengal and Jharkhand.

 But the Arjun Munda government has put forth the name of Rajiv Ranjan, a former chairman of the Jharkhand State Electricity Board. 

 ?The two have been short-listed from over a dozen names that reached the Union power ministry over the past few weeks,? an official associated with the screening said. 

 Lobbying the Centre for the induction of Chowdhury, the Bhattacharjee government has pointed out that Ranjan had opted out of the IAS and contested unsuccessfully the last Assembly election on a BJP ticket.

 ?The Bengal government?s emphasis on Ranjan?s BJP association is meant to contain the message that if Anupam Kher had to go from the censor board, why should a BJP sympathiser like Ranjan be invited to head DVC,? an official said. 

 Having clocked a net profit of over Rs 900 crore in the last fiscal, the DVC is in the limelight because it has planned a string of lucrative joint ventures. The hunt for private partners for the projects would be started by the Union power ministry shortly.

 The new chairman will have a significant say in deciding the partners, the location and the size of investments. Now an additional secretary in the Union power department is overseeing the working of the DVC.

 Another reason for Bengal?s eagerness for the post is the Munda government?s demand to shift the DVC headquarters from Calcutta to Ranchi. 

 Bengal is banking on Union ministers from the state, such as Pranab Mukherjee and Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, to ensure that its nominee gets the post.

 Defence minister Mukherjee and water resources minister Das Munshi ? his ministry is also concerned with the running of the DVC ? are believed to have conveyed Bengal?s case to Union power minister P.M. Sayeed. ?I have brought it to the attention of my government,? Das Munshi said. Also interceding for Bengal with the Centre is CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury.

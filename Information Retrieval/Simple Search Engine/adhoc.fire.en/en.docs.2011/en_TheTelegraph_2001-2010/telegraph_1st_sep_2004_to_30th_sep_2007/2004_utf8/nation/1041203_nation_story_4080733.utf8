 Fraud slur on seer disciple

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, Dec. 2: After the reprieve yesterday, the heat is back again on Usha.

 Jayendra Saraswati?s controversial disciple, whom the prosecution cleared of involvement in the murder case that has embroiled the seer, came under fresh glare today after Andhra Pradesh police said they wanted to take her into custody in connection with a cheating case.

 ?We will send our police team to arrest Usha only after getting the green signal from Tamil Nadu police,? a police officer said.

 Usha and her husband R.L. Narayana are accused of duping a branch of the State Bank of India in Srikalahasti of Rs 32.8 lakh. The state police say they took a loan for setting up a brick-making unit for which they submitted documents of a house in Chennai as surety.

 ?They defaulted on payments within three months which made the bank issue notices to the guarantor. Investigations revealed they had forged the signature of the owner of the house,? said a police official in Srikalahasti, 40 km from Tirupati.

 ?We have a very tight case against Usha,? Srikalahasti circle inspector Srinivasa Naidu said.

 The police said Narayana, who has been arrested thrice in different cases and is on bail in the cheating case, confessed that the documents submitted to the bank were forged. He is likely to be taken into custody again, the police said.

 The police said both Usha and Narayana used to be part of Jayendra Saraswati?s entourage whenever he toured Andhra. They said the Kanchi seer came to Srikalahasti to inaugurate Usha?s factory, Sumeru Concrete Housing Materials Pvt. Ltd, in 1996.

 Investigations have revealed that the two are also responsible for misappropriation of Kanchi mutt funds. ?Almost Rs 1.5 crore had been embezzled by them. We are inquiring into everything now,? a police official said.

 In Kancheepuram, police began a probe into the mysterious death of Vedic scholar Ayyappa Sharma, a devotee of the mutt, whose body was found in a temple tank two years ago. 

 The move follows the police assertion that each case in which anybody associated with the mutt had died would be looked into afresh in the wake of the murder of Shankar Raman which has landed the seer in jail.

 A police team from Tamil Nadu also visited the Kerala residence of Keshavan Namboodiri, a Sanskrit student of Kancheepuram Chandrasekhara College who was allegedly electrocuted in the mutt 19 years ago. 

 The visit followed a fax message by his family to Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayalalithaa seeking a probe into his death.

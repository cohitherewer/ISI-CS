 Zahira runs to minority panel

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Zahira

 New Delhi, Nov. 8: Zahira Sheikh today went to the National Commission for Minorities with her allegations against Teesta Setalvad and her NGO.

 ?We received a letter from her (Zahira) today in which she has complained of being coerced to name innocent persons in the (Best Bakery) case by Setalvad and her NGO. She has written that she is feeling helpless as she belongs to a minority community,? commission chairman Tarlochan Singh said.

 The key witness in the case had last week made the accusations against rights activist Setalvad, who had helped her take the case to the Supreme Court after a Vadodara court acquitted all the accused.

 The commission will meet here tomorrow to discuss the complaint and order an inquiry into the allegations, commission sources said.

 Zahira ? whose turnaround was considered shocking as she had earlier said she turned hostile in the Vadodara court under duress, leading to the acquittal of the accused? is staying with relatives in an undisclosed location in Gujarat under police protection.

 She sought an appointment with the commission for personal appearance but changed her mind and sent her lawyer with an attested letter.

 In the letter, Zahira repeats the allegation that some NGO activists at Setalvad?s behest forcibly took her to Mumbai, where she was ?threatened with dire consequences? if she did not cooperate in the case and was confined by the activist.

 Setalvad, associated with the NGO Citizens for Justice and Peace, had on Saturday approached the apex court to order a probe into Zahira?s U-turn. She had declined comment on what could have spurred the turnaround.

 Singh said the commission had taken cognisance of Zahira?s complaint.

 Without commenting on the ?sub judice? case, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had yesterday said the developments should make the country ?introspect and reflect on what is going on?.

 A Vadodara police official today left for Ahmedabad to serve summons on Zahira and two others ?as they have been asked to remain present in the special court in Mumbai on November 17?, city police commissioner S.K. Sinha said tonight.

 In and around Vadodara, where 14 people were killed at the Best Bakery in March 2002 in the post-Godhra riots, some organisations burnt Setalvad?s effigy yesterday. The Hindu Chetna Vahini and the Tad Faliya Yuvak Madal demanded her arrest.

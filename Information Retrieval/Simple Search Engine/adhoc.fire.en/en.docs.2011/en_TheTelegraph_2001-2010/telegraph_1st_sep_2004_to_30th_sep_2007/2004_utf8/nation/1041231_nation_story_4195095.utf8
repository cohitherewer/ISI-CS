 Mobile phone drivers in Andhra face jail

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, Dec. 30: The Andhra Pradesh government has decided to register cases, from January 1, against people using mobile phones while riding two-wheelers or driving other vehicles.

 So far, those using mobile phones while driving were only fined and warned, according to director-general of police S.R. Sukumara. ?Now, we will slap section 11 of the motor vehicles act on them to detain and register cases against them,? said the police chief. 

 Violators will now face sentences ranging from three months to two years in jail.

 In Bengal, the use of even hands-free mobile phones is banned while driving. Violators face a fine of Rs 100.

 Nearly 10,614 people died and 53,816 people were injured in 39,156 accidents during the year, the officer said, adding that there has been a nearly 14 per cent rise in road accidents compared to last year.

 The state has also slipped on the crime graph for which major factors are the rise in gender crimes, white-collar offences and cyber crimes, the director-general said. In 2004, 15,255 cases of crime against women have been registered compared to 13,555 in 2003, he said.

 The number of gender crimes registered has risen sharply also because of the greater awareness that has prompted women to speak out, the police chief said.

 Sukumara said white-collar offences have increased with the easy availability of cyber tools and the eroding of non-bank financial institutions as well as credit-card fraud. 

 Economic offences have increased from 5,569 in 2003 to 6,197 this year, he said.

 However, crimes prompted by Naxalites have come down sharply, he said. The Maoists had committed 78 murders and 790 other crimes during 2004 compared to 151 killings and 923 other offences the previous year.

 Those killed this year include 34 elected representatives and eight police personnel. Fifty-two rebels had been gunned down in encounters this year compared to 175 last year, said the police chief.

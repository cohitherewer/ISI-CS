 Job prospect for Pandits

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Jammu, Dec. 22: Kashmiri Pandit migrants can expect some relief in the form of jobs for the married and unemployed. 

 ?A survey to identify such couples will be conducted soon,? Jammu and Kashmir revenue, relief and rehabilitation minister Hakim Mohammad Yaseen said yesterday. 

 He was assuring a visiting team of the Centre?s inter-ministerial committee of the state?s ?sincere and committed efforts to offer jobs to the Kashmiri Pandit migrants?.

 They have been seeking a job quota in government services in the state. This was a major theme among migrants at all the camps that the central team, led by Planning Commission adviser Sushma Choudhary, visited during the past three days in Jammu region.

 The team was set up and deputed to visit the migrant camps as a follow-up to the announcement here last month by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. He had announced lifting the freeze on central government service for the state and promised to create more jobs in the next four to five years. Singh had been moved by the plight of the migrants.

 Yaseen said the state would give ?top priority? to Kashmiri Pandits still living in the Valley. The ?special employment package as a source of sustenance for Kashmiri Pandit youths is under active consideration with first priority to those who are putting up in the Valley despite odds of turmoil?.

 About 2,000 Kashmiri Pandit families live in various parts of the Valley; 30,000 others are settled outside.

 The locals, Yaseen said, will be ?followed by those migrants who are willing to return to the Valley. Those willing to return would be provided adequate accommodation in secure clusters?.

 The package will form a part of the Prime Minister?s overall rehabilitation plan for Kashmiri migrants.

 Yaseen said the state has sought some relaxation in rules in centrally sponsored schemes for extending benefits of education scholarships and social welfare programmes to the children of camp-dwellers.

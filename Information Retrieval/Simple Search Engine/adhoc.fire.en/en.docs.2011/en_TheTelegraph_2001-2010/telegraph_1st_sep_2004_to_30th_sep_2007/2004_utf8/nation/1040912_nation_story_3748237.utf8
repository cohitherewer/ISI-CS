 Harass cops come under CBI scanner

 Madurai, Sept. 11 (PTI): The Madurai bench of Madras High Court today ordered a CBI inquiry into the allegations of ?sexual abuse and harassment? made by saleswoman ?Sivakasi? Jayalakshmi against several police officials in Tamil Nadu.

 A division bench of Justices .V. Balasubramanian and T.V. Masilamani told the CBI director to get the allegation investigated by an official not below the rank of deputy director.

 The judges, who expressed concern over the nature of allegations made against the police department, asked the CBI director to submit a report on the progress in investigation in two months to the registrar-general of the high court.

 Stating that the allegations made by Jayalakshmi ?reveal only the tip of an iceberg?, the bench said: ?We are of the view that a thorough and impartial investigation alone would bring out the truth in the allegations against the police officers alleged to have committed the offences for their personal gains and private satisfaction.?

 The court said the investigation should cover all the aspects of Jayalakshmi?s complaints.

 Besides taking into account the 22 officials against whom charges had been made, others not mentioned in Jayalakshmi?s affidavit but reported to have played some role should also be considered, the court ordered.

 The judges ordered that the 17-page affidavit filed by Jayalakshmi on August 23 could itself be treated as a complaint and a case registered.

 The court said Jayalakshmi could stay at her home or a place of her choice and ordered that she be given adequate police protection.

 The court had ordered the police to produce Jayalakshmi before the high court bench here after her father Alagirisamy sent a telegram to high court Chief Justice B. Subashan Reddy on August 9. The telegram was treated as a habeas corpus petition.

 Alagirisamy charged that some persons, including two police officials, had kidnapped Jayalakshmi and also claimed that he received telephone calls saying Jayalakshmi had been murdered.

 Refuting all the charges against them, the police said Jayalakshmi was involved in several cheating cases. However, Jayalakshmi, in her affidavit, alleged that police officials had sexually abused her and claimed that she did not cheat anyone as claimed by the police.

 The police had also threatened to file a prostitution case against her, she alleged, and there was a plan to sell her off to a brothel in Mumbai.

 Al Jazeera in India

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Sept. 2: The Arab world will reach Indian homes directly now.

 Al Jazeera, the Qatar-based network that shot into prominence during the Afghan war, entered into a tie-up with India TV, a recently-launched Indian news channel.

 According to the agreement signed today in Delhi, Al Jazeera, which put an end to the monopoly of western media coverage on the Arabic world, and India TV will provide each other with news coverage and bulletins. 

 We will telecast a half-an-hour bulletin everyday at 11 pm that will compile all the days news from Al Jazeera, said India TV chairman Rajat Sharma. 

 As of now, the tie-up is based on content-sharing, Sharma added. There is a dearth of composite and immediate news reporting of events in the Arabic world. 

 There is no equity partnership between the two channels. 

 The managing director of Al Jazeera, Wadah Khanfar, who was in Delhi, said: India holds an important audience base for us.

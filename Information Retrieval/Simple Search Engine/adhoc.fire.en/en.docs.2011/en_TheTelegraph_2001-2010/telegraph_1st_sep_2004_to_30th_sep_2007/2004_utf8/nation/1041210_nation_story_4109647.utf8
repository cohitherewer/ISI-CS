 Stress tells on forces again

 MUKHTAR AHMAD

 Srinagar, Dec. 9: The country?s most stressful conflict zone claimed two more victims as a Jammu and Kashmir police officer killed himself with his service rifle last night, barely 24 hours after a paramilitary trooper shot dead his senior.

 Police said sub-inspector Mushtaq Ahmad, of the elite Special Operations Group of Jammu and Kashmir police, locked himself up in a room in a camp in Baramulla, north Kashmir, before pulling the trigger. 

 Hearing gunshots, his colleagues in the anti-militancy force broke open the door and found Mushtaq lying on the floor in a pool of blood. He was taken to the local hospital where doctors declared him dead.

 The reasons for the suicide were not immediately known, though official sources said Mushtaq took the extreme step after he was ?severely reprimanded? by some senior officers.

 However, an official at the Baramulla police control room said the officer had suffered bullet injuries somewhere else which led to his death, but did not elaborate.

 The incident came 24 hours after an irate Central Reserve Police Force trooper shot dead his officer at a guard post in Rawalpora in the summer capital at the residence of Sajjad Gani Lone, a moderate separatist leader.

 Police sources said Leena Thapa went berserk on Tuesday evening and pumped bullets from his service rifle into sub-inspector Prem Singh who died on the spot.

 ?Outcast? Pappu back in RJD

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Pappu Yadav

Patna, Sept. 21: Controversial politician Pappu Yadav, an ?outcast? till recently for the Rashtriya Janata Dal, was today welcomed into the party with a ticket for the Madhepura byelection next month. 

 The turn of tide took place soon after Patna High Court granted bail to Yadav earlier in the day. 

 The former Purnea MP yesterday resigned from the primary membership of Ram Vilas Paswan?s Lok Janshakti Party, calling it a ?refuge of rejected people?. 

 Soon after the court decision, RJD president Laloo Prasad Yadav, who was in Thiruvananthapuram, announced that Pappu Yadav would be the candidate for Madhepura, where the byelection is slated for October 13. The seat was vacated by Laloo Prasad after he was elected to the Lok Sabha from Chhapra as well.

 Pappu Yadav is expected to file his papers tomorrow. 

 The RJD?s decision has rubbed the CPM the wrong way. The former MP is an accused in the murder of popular CPM legislator Ajit Sarkar, who was shot at Tatma Toli near Purnea on June 14, 1998, along with two party workers. 

 The high court granted bail to Yadav on two sureties of Rs 50,000 each, observing that there was no apparent ground to believe that he was ?guilty of an offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life?. 

 The CPM, which has been strongly opposing Pappu Yadav ever since Sarkar?s murder, has already announced its decision to field Balram Singh from Madhepura. But the party?s bigger problem is that Pappu Yadav would contest as a candidate of the RJD, which happens to be an ?ally? of the CPM in Bihar as well as at the Centre. 

 CPM state secretariat member Ram Dev Paswan described the decision as ?unfortunate? and said the party?s Bihar unit would hold a meeting on September 30 to ?decide? on its ?relations? with the RJD. ?The decision of that meeting would be communicated to the politburo,? he said. 

 The Janata Dal (United) has fielded former MP R.P. Yadav from the seat as Sharad Yadav, who was defeated by Laloo Prasad, decided against seeking re-election. 

 Pappu Yadav?s wife Ranjeeta Ranjan, who won the neighbouring Saharsa seat, continues to be an LJP parliamentarian. 

 Pappu Yadav?s joining hands with Laloo Prasad is also significant in the light of the Assembly election early next year as he is said to enjoy a good following in the Purnea-Madhepura belt. 

 Yadav was once a loyalist of the RJD chief but the two had fallen out.

 Britain clings to Edwina headband

 AMIT ROY

 London, Oct. 27: The British government has placed a temporary order banning the export of a Cartier bandeau, encrusted with precious Indian gems, which was once worn by Edwina, Lady Mountbatten, the glamorous wife of Lord Mountbatten, the last Viceroy of India.

 In trying to create a sense of excitement around the item, government sources said that Edwina ?had a string of affairs including a rumoured one with Jawaharlal Nehru, India?s first Prime Minister?.

 The implication here is that a new buyer might have just as fascinating a life as the woman who captured Mountbatten?s heart and later became a darling of the English upper classes.

 She and Mountbatten had something of an ?open marriage? ? which is an English way of saying one did not mind too much if the other had an affair (which Edwina did from time to time). It has also been alleged that Mountbatten?s preference was not only for the opposite sex.

 It is also being pointed out that the bandeau ? a fancy French word for a headband ? reflected Edwina?s softness for India. The item, described as a unique piece of Art Deco jewellery, has been bought by a foreign collector for ?300,000 but Estelle Morris, the British arts minister, is giving buyers in the UK until December 27 the chance to buy the piece. The deadline can be extended until February 27 if a potential buyer shows serious intention of trying to raise the money.

 The British government does not prevent art works from leaving the country after a legal sale but if an item is considered to be of exceptional interest, it will step in and allow time for a local buyer to come forward, thereby preserving the national heritage.

 Edwina bought the bandeau in 1928 from Cartier. The tutti-frutti style gem is in the form of a sinuous creeper, the stem set with diamonds, and the leaves and fruit formed of carved Indian rubies, sapphires and emeralds.

 The department of culture, media and sport gushed today: ?The bandeau is a triumph of Art Deco jewellery manufacture in the capital. It is an object of pre-eminent importance to the history of jewellery in England between the two World Wars. The bandeau was made by English Art Works, a company established in 1922 and deliberately staffed with British craftsmen by Cartier in response to depression-era unemployment in the jewellery industry. There is no multi-gem Art Deco jewel of comparable significance in a British public collection.?

 It went on: ?The bandeau can also be seen as a symbol of Lady Mountbatten?s colourful life. The goddaughter of Edward VII, she was a woman of independent mind and great wealth, who became a leader of fashion between the two World Wars. Although clearly an object at the very height of fashion, the bandeau equally reflects Lady Mountbatten?s interest in India, and its Indian stones must surely have had resonances for her.?

 It pointed out: ?As a young woman in love with Lord Louis, but not yet in receipt of her inheritance, she had had to borrow ?100 from her great-aunt in order to sail to India to see him while he was aide-de-camp to the Prince of Wales. It was here that their engagement was announced in February 1922. Later, as Vicereine, she witnessed the end of British rule in the subcontinent. The bandeau itself was the piece which, in the form of two bracelets, she chose to highlight in a studio portrait on the birth of her second child.?

 Edwina died in Borneo in 1960 and her body was buried at sea. Lord Mountbatten was assassinated by an IRA bomb in Co Sligo, Ireland, in 1979.

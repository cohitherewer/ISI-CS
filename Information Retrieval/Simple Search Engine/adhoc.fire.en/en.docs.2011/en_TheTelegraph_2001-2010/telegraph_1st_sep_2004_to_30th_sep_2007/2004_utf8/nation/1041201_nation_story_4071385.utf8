 Council nod to alumina plant

 DEBABRATA MOHANTY

 Bhubaneswar, Nov. 30: The council of ministers in Orissa yesterday gave its consent to the establishment of an alumina refinery plant at Lanjigarh in Kalahandi district. 

 An agreement to this effect was signed between Vedanta Alumina and the state-owned Orissa Mining Corporation (OMC) in October.

 The contentious mining issue, which had rocked the Assembly during the last session, has been a constant headache for the government. 

 The Opposition had trained its guns on the Naveen Patnaik government over the deal and had also petitioned former Governor M.M. Rajendran. Following the governor?s intervention, the agreement was placed before the council of ministers yesterday.

 Vedanta is currently engaged in setting up a 1 million-tonne alumina refinery at Lanjigarh at an estimated cost of Rs 4,000 crore. The plant is likely to be commissioned by March 2007. According to the agreement signed with OMC, Vedanta would operate as its agent to develop the mines.

 Governor Rajendran had questioned the decision of the government for not opting for an open tender for the project. The former governor had also questioned Patnaik?s decision to lay the foundation stone in Kalahandi while the company did not have a captive mine of its own. 

 Some other uncomfortable questions ? why didn?t the government and OMC opt for bauxite export and why did the mining corporation agree to a price of Rs 250 per tonne when the market price was much higher ? were raised as well. 

 In yesterday?s meeting, the government made it clear that the deal was to be executed within the framework of the agreement signed by the previous Congress government in 1997, which did not envisage any tendering process. 

 The agreement clearly mentioned the transfer of lease for the Lanjigarh and Karlapat mines by OMC to Sterlite. Going back would have meant vitiating the investment climate, it said.

 Referring to the issue of bauxite price, the government said bauxite is not sold in the open market. 

 Major companies such as Nalco and Hindalco have captive deposits and use the bauxite for their alumina plants. It claimed that the approximate price of Rs 250 per metric tonne to be paid by Vedanta Alumina is in tune with the prevailing price. 

 The official version was that the price of the ore for Nalco was only Rs 168 per tonne. In the international market, the price is Rs 782 per metric tonne but it also includes cost of transportation, loading, chemical analysis and port charges.

 While most of the questions and their answers were a repetition of what was discussed during the last Assembly session, the fact that the entire matter, including the agreement, was placed before the council of ministers as desired by the governor assumed much significance.

 Census probe rolls 

 ALOKE TIKKU

 New Delhi, Sept. 18: Union home minister Shivraj Patil has ordered an inquiry into the release of controversial religion-based census figures that triggered a controversy over the high growth rate among Muslims.

 The decision to go in for a formal inquiry comes a fortnight after the controversial figures were first released after Congress chief Sonia Gandhi asserted in Rae Bareli that the Centre would look into the census report and hold an inquiry if any discrepancy was found.

 Patil, who had earlier summoned census commissioner Jayant Kumar Banthia to ascertain how the lapse occurred, reportedly took the cue from Sonia?s statement and ordered a formal inquiry today.

 Earlier this month, Banthia released the census growth figures without taking into account that the headcount was not conducted in Jammu and Kashmir in 1991. The unadjusted growth rate indicated that Muslim population had grown by 36 per cent over the last decade.

 Criticism that the wrong methodology had been used ? Banthia accepted that the census commission erred on this count ? had pushed the commission into releasing unadjusted growth rate figures arrived at after excluding Assam and Jammu and Kashmir that revealed that the Muslim growth rate had slowed to 29.3 per cent over the last decade.

 The inquiry headed by the home secretary will ascertain why the census commission departed from the earlier system of excluding states where census may not have been conducted in previous years and also determine if commission officials were up to some mischief.

 Sonia peace pledge in Kargil

 MUKHTAR AHMAD AND AGENCIES

 Srinagar, Sept. 30: The ongoing peace process with Pakistan would be ?further strengthened?, Sonia Gandhi said today on her first visit to Kargil since the change of guard in Delhi.

 ?The Union government has initiated talks with Pakistan. The relations with Pakistan would be further strengthened,? the Congress chief and United Progressive Alliance chairperson told the crowd of residents, neighbouring villagers and people from Drass.

 ?Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had talks with the Pakistan President recently and it was a step towards establishing peace in the region,? she said. The reference was to the leaders? meeting in New York on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly.

 Sonia said neither India nor Pakistan would benefit from continuing with belligerent postures. ?The government will take every step to resolve the Kashmir issue peacefully,? she said.

 Calling the residents ?soldiers without uniform?, Sonia said: ?The people of Kargil stood shoulder-to-shoulder with the Indian Army facing the trans-border shelling to foil the evil designs of the enemy during the Kargil conflict.?

 The border town had witnessed hostilities between Indian and Pakistani troops in 1999. The residents, Sonia added, have kept Kargil clean of the ?menace of militancy?.

 Addressing the long-standing local demand of a full-fledged airport, she said possibilities of expanding the existing facility to help operate commercial flights would be explored.

 The Congress chief promised to take up with defence minister Pranab Mukherjee the rehabilitation of those displaced by the Kargil war. Sonia also promised a women?s college, upgradation of a local hospital and a solar energy plant.

 She urged the Jammu and Kashmir government, in which her party is a partner, to take special care of people in border areas as they had suffered much.

 Sonia was earlier given a rousing welcome by the people, several of whom had turned out in traditional attire. The road from Kargil airport to the rally venue was full of welcome banners and arches.

 Minister from Dhaka to call

 SEEMA GUHA

 New Delhi, Dec. 4: Bangladesh finance minister S. Saifur Rahman will arrive in India late tonight for a five-day visit and interaction with India?s top political leadership.

 He will be here primarily to attend the India Economic Summit ? organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry and the World Economic Forum ? but will take the opportunity to meet leaders in the new government in Delhi.

 The seniormost cabinet member in Khaleda Zia?s government, Rahman is familiar with India and knows Prime Minister Manmohan Singh personally.

 A chartered accountant by training, he is regarded as the architect of Bangladesh?s economic liberalisation programme in the early 1990s. In his first stint as finance minister, he had introduced value-added tax to bolster state finances, which was then in a shambles.

 The visiting finance minister will have his main interaction with his Indian counterpart, P. Chidambaram, but will also call on Singh.

 Also on the agenda are meetings with commerce minister Kamal Nath, foreign minister K. Natwar Singh and petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar. The timings are yet to be finalised, high commission sources said.

 During his discussions with the Indian leaders, Rahman will plead for the removal of non-tariff barriers on Bangladeshi goods. Dhaka is keen that the trade balance, which is heavily in India?s favour, be corrected.

 India?s annual imports from its eastern neighbour accounts for $80 million while Bangladesh buys $2 billion worth of goods each year from India.

 But more important will be Rahman?s meeting with the captains of Indian industry, who are organising the economic summit. 

 The minister will try to get Indian businessmen to invest in his country. 

 The Tatas have already pledged a $2-billion investment in Bangladesh.

 Price heat on govt

 New Delhi, Dec. 2: The United Progressive Alliance government came under fire over petroleum prices for the second consecutive day of Parliament?s winter session, reports our special correspondent.

 Like yesterday, both the Left ? an ally ? and the BJP mounted an attack on the Congress-led regime for hiking petroleum prices.

 At the end of a half-hour discussion on the issue, the NDA walked out in protest against the Centre?s refusal to give an assurance on rolling back prices. CPI?s Gurudas Dasgupta asked whether the government was going to roll back prices fully or partially.

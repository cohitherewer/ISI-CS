 After poll, Shinde faces party battle

 New Delhi, Oct. 14: If the Congress-NCP combine emerges triumphant in the Maharashtra polls, chief minister Sushil Kumar Shinde will have the rare distinction of overcoming reverses in an election to register victory in another less than six months later.

 Only M.G. Ramachandran and Ramakrishna Hegde share the honour so far. The two late leaders guided their parties to convincing Assembly poll victories in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka in the early eighties, a few months after suffering defeats in the Lok Sabha elections.

 But even if Shinde succeeds in keeping the Democratic Front in power after conceding majority to the BJP-Shiv Sena combine in the May general elections, he is unlikely to be the obvious choice to head the new government.

 According to informed sources, Shinde is a little ?indifferent? to the idea of continuing as chief minister for another term. ?Madam (Sonia Gandhi) had entrusted me (with) a task last year ? to lead the party in the run-up to the Assembly elections. Once the Assembly elections are over, my job is also over,? he is believed to have told his colleagues in the Congress.

 Yesterday, Shinde himself said he would prefer to return to national politics.

 It was not clear if he was speaking from his heart or indulging in political posturing ahead of Saturday?s verdict. But what is certain is that the powerful Maratha lobby in the state Congress is unlikely to give up on the leadership issue.

 Former chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh, senior ministers Patangrao Kadam and Govindrao Adik and even state Congress president Prabha Rau ? all Marathas ? are believed to be eyeing the top job.

 With the Maratha lobby determined to stake a claim for chief ministership, the party high command is not committing itself. Asked if Shinde would be re-elected chief minister, AICC media department chairperson Girija Vyas today said: ?It would be decided by the new legislature party.?

 Sources said the high command, too, might prefer to have a fresh look at the leadership issue as it is not satisfied with Shinde?s record.

 Much would also depend on NCP leader Sharad Pawar. While the party leadership does not believe the NCP would get more seats than the Congress to stake claim for one of its candidates, Pawar?s concurrence may be necessary.

 Although Pawar would prefer Shinde, he may not be in a position to campaign for him for fear of alienating the Maratha lobby. 

 ?During campaigning, Pawar realised the extent of discontent among the Marathas who were not reconciled to losing the chief ministership to Shinde,? said a Congress leader.

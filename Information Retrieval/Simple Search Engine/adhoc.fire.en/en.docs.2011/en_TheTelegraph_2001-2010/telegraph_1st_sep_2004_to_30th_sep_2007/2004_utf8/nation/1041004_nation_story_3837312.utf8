 Polls delay Naxalite talks

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Hyderabad, Oct. 3: Talks between the Andhra Pradesh government and Naxalites, led by the People?s War Group, will begin on October 15. 

 The PWG had proposed talks from October 13, but the government requested a change citing bypolls on that day. 

 The PWG endorsed the change and requested that the venue be shifted from the secretariat to the Jubilee Hall.

 Jubilee Hall is a historic building constructed to commemorate the silver jubilee of the rule of Mahboob Ali Pasha, the last Nizam of Hyderabad. It is situated on the western edge of the 25-acre garden complex about half-a-kilometre from the secretariat. 

 Home minister K. Jana Reddy said today that in view of the two Assembly bypolls at Asifnagar and Siddipet, in Karimnagar, on October 13, whose results are expected the next day, it was not possible to hold talks with the Naxalites.

 ?The political situation will not be conducive for talks in view of unsteady relations with electoral partner TRS (Telengana Rashtra Samiti) which has a major stake in the bypolls,? he said.

 Jana Reddy added that due to his pre-arranged schedule, he was not available tomorrow to fix the modalities and agenda with the Naxalite emissaries. ?We will meet on October 5 for a final touch-up for the sensitive negotiations,? he said.

 Congress haute on ?western? Fashion Street

 Mumbai, Oct. 7: Fashion Street has a special place in Mumbai?s underbelly. The 3-km stretch along Cross Maidan is packed with kiosks sporting ersatz versions of the latest western fashions. 

 No churidar-kurtas or sari-blouses. The shop-owners would be seen dead than hawk stuff for ?auntyjis?. Their sales pitch is interspersed with jargon from the fashion lexicon. Until red spittle dribbles from the salesman?s mouth after his feverish spiel is over, it?s difficult to place him geographically. Then you know he must be from Uttar Pradesh or Bihar. And he is. 

 Fashion Street has the elements of a migrant success saga in a tough metropolis: far-sightedness, grit, ethnic solidarity and political aspirations. It is the product of an assembly-line kind of operation that starts in the sweatshops of Sewree and Dharavi which make the shirts, sarongs, shorts, pedal-pushers, scarves and send them to wholesalers in Dadar, where they are picked up by the retailers. 

 From start to end, the process is manned by migrants from the eastern Uttar Pradesh districts of Ghazipur, Azamgarh, Varanasi and Ballia, who came in search of the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow some 25 years ago. 

 Loosely called the ?Uttar Bhartis?, they are in danger of losing the pot of gold if the Shiv Sena has its way. 

 The Sena-dominated Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) sent notices to them asking why they should not be relocated because of street ?congestion?. When it was challenged by the shop-owners, the high court ruled in their favour. The BMC filed a review petition in the Supreme Court which is being heard. 

 The elections are here and the Fashion Street coterie has resolved to show its political clout to the BJP-Sena. ?We are voting the Congress because it is the only party which integrates every community. The Sena is parochial,? said Lal Chand Gupta. 

 While back home in the Hindi heartland, Gupta would configure caste equations before casting his vote, in Mumbai, he said: ?Casteism is counterproductive. Brahmins, Banias, Thakurs, Yadavs, everybody live cheek by jowl. Even Muslims. Our solidarity will be shattered if we think in terms of religion or caste. Our battle is for survival.? 

 By the Sena?s admission, ?Uttar Bhartis? can tilt the political scales in 28 of Mumbai?s 36 constituencies. ?Because their survival stakes are high, they vote en bloc,? said Sena Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Nirupam, himself a Bihari. 

 The Fashion Street psyche is a small byproduct of the ?Maharashtra for Marathis? campaign the Sena unleashed after it was voted out. 

 Last year, its activists beat up Bihari students who arrived at Kalyan for a railway entrance exam. In Kapoli, on the Mumbai-Pune highway, Sainiks have forced private companies to sack their ?Uttar Bharti? employees. 

 Nirupam says there was no ?diktat? from Sena patriarch Bal Thackeray to victimise the ?outsiders?. 

 ?I keep saying, okay you people punished us in the Lok Sabha elections for the Kalyan episode. I will guarantee such things won?t happen again,? he said. 

 But even the handful of ?Uttar Bhartis? in the Sena is not buying the argument. 

 ?The Sena cannot abdicate its basic philosophy of Maharashtra for the Marathi-speaking people. Every party has to first pander to its basic voters before thinking of the others. The most charitable explanation we give in our meetings is that when Balasaheb talks of Mumbaikars or Maharashtrians, he means everybody except Bangladeshi immigrants,? said Shesh Narayan Tripati, who works for the Sena?s Hindi mouthpiece, Saamna. 

 The only consolation for the BJP-Sena combine is that the Congress-NCP has not put up too many ?Uttar Bhartis?, a fact that angered the politically ambitious in the community who felt their loyalty was being taken for ?granted?. Many of them are considering the Samajwadi Party as an option.

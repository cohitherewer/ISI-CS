 Jail hunt to house Pappu

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 14: The Supreme Court today asked the CBI to find a ?suitable jail? to lodge Rashtriya Janata Dal MP Rajesh Ranjan alias Pappu Yadav as his ?illegal activities? inside Patna?s Beur jail were going on unabated.

 A division bench of Justices N. Santosh Hegde and S.B. Sinha made it clear that Yadav should be shifted to some other place to curtail the ?extra-legal and extra-constitutional activities? he was carrying out from the jail.

 The court took on record an exhaustive report of the CBI and the Bihar inspector-general (prisons) to come to the conclusion that Yadav was violating all norms and rules of the jail manual. It asked the CBI counsel: ?What is the punishment for violating jail manual rules??

 In his report, the IG detailed how Yadav?s supporters had gathered inside the jail and the RJD leader had threatened him with dire consequences as he was now an MP. The CBI, too, said the jail superintendent had violated rules to allow supporters of Yadav inside the jail, where the Madhepura MP was said to be running almost a parallel system.

 The Supreme Court transferred to itself proceedings against Yadav in Patna High Court and said it would monitor the cases and the MP?s activities. It also said the notices issued by Patna High Court would be ?deemed? to have been issued by the Supreme Court.

 ?The notices issued by the high court to cellular phone companies would be treated as notices issued by this court,? the bench said and directed all concerned, including the CBI and the cellular phone companies, to respond by January 3. It posted the matter for hearing on January 4. 

 Yadav was allegedly carrying a cellphone inside the jail and conducting his business from inside.

 The judges said the accused would be given a hearing as Yadav?s counsel R.K. Jain gave an undertaking that in future there would be no complaint about his client?s behaviour in prison. ?If the court finds any violation, its hands were long enough to catch the culprit and take action,? Jain said.

 At this, Justice Hegde observed: ?Our hands were long enough to cancel his bail twice in the case but not long enough to keep him as an undertrial in prison. We had directed him to be kept in prison, not in a five-star hotel.? 

 The judges took serious note of the unauthorised presence of a large number of alleged supporters of Yadav inside the jail and the seizure of cellphones from him. ?This type of cavalier activities cannot be condoned,? the bench said.

 ?The impunity with which Yadav is violating rules under the jail manual needs to be taken serious note of,? the bench said and asked the CBI to respond if the trial could be smoothly conducted if Yadav was shifted out of Beur jail.

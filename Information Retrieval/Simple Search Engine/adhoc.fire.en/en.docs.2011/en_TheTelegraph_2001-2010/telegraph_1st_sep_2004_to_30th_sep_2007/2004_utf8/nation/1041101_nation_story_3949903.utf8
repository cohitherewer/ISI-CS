 VRS offer to Congress staff

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 31: The Congress is going in for serious reform at home.

 Aiming for a smaller, younger and more efficient secretarial staff at the party?s 24 Akbar Road headquarters, the leadership has offered permanent employees ? about 170 ? voluntary retirement.

 On Tuesday, party treasurer Motilal Vora, who is in charge of the AICC hub, issued a circular inviting VRS applications. The scheme is open till November 9.

 Besides statutory dues like provident fund, Vora has offered 15 days? salary for every remaining year of service of employees opting for the VRS. The retirement age for permanent employees is 65 years.

 ?It is felt that the number of employees in the AICC are surplus ? more than are actually required. The objective of the VRS is to downsize the strength of employees so that it may enable the AICC to enhance efficiency in its operations,? the October 26 circular said.

 Apprehensive employees said this was not the first time they had been offered VRS but felt Vora?s circular could be an advance notice of largescale retrenchments. Few would be lured by the offer, they said.

 Last month, Vora had sent home over a dozen employees, some on post-retirement extensions. The employees fear ?the party wants to get rid of the existing employees and bring in younger people to man the party secretariat?.

 An employee retired compulsorily last month said: ?Indiraji would have never allowed this kind of unkind action against the employees who have served the party more out of loyalty than for money.? He said that in 1980 Indira Gandhi had overturned then general secretary Vasantdada Patil?s order retrenching 36 people.

 Senior employees said they were being sidelined because party officials ? general secretaries and secretaries ? preferred bringing their own workers to respective secretariats than availing the services of permanent employees.

 Sources close to Vora said the move sought to cut establishment expenses at the party headquarters. Three months ago when Sonia undertook the first major revamp, she disbanded all AICC departments. Vora had then asked the staff to help cut expenses on electricity, stationery and transport.

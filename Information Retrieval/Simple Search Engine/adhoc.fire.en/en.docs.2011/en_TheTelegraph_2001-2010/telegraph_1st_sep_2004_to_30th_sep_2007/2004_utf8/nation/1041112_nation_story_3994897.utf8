 Subway-shy? Try escalator

 AYSWARIA VENUGOPAL

 New Delhi, Nov. 11: The country?s capital will bring pedestrian comfort overground with two escalator-equipped footbridges as the residents are fighting shy of subways.

 A brainwave of chief minister Sheila Dikshit, the swanky pieces of street furniture ? a first for the country ? will come up in front of the Inter-State Bus Terminus at Kashmere Gate in north Delhi and at Moti Bagh in the south, both on Ring Road.

 These will help decongest both areas of heavy pedestrian traffic.

 Subways abound in the capital but the administration has been puzzled why people are not using them. Dikshit had earlier said that subways in Delhi are a failure because these have become havens for criminals and so people do not feel safe.

 The escalator footbridges will be built on build-operate-transfer basis for Rs 2 crore-2.5 crore each.

 The idea hit Dikshit when an emergency footbridge was built a few metres from her house to ease pedestrian traffic headed to the India International Trade Fair earlier this year.

 The fair organiser dismantled the structure after the fair. The chief minister, however, improvised on the idea to come up with the plan for an elderly- and disabled-friendly footbridge.

 The escalator-footbridges will be operated and maintained by private companies. The revenue is to be generated from advertising on the structure.

 The response to the Delhi government?s invitation of expressions of interest has been enthusiastic but it is mulling over an appropriate advertising policy for the footbridges. A Supreme Court order of 1996 had banned hoardings that distract traffic.

 The private companies will also employ watch-and-ward staff for the security of the pedestrians.

 Escalators in Delhi will now no longer be the mall-crawlers? delight. Thanks to the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), jaywalking Delhiites have had ample experience of escalators at its stations since their inception almost two years ago.

 The DMRC had paid special attention to the safety of its escalators after a seven-year-old girl died in an escalator accident at the Indira Gandhi International Airport in 1999.

 The metro escalators were equipped with a variety of safety devices ranging from three emergency switches and speed governors to broken-chain safety device, handrail safety device and a dress guard to deflect loose clothing.

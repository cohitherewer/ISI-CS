 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 20: Foreign minister K. Natwar Singh has constituted a policy advisory group to help him out on major regional and international developments.

 The six-member group has a number of experts whose hardline views are not only well known but some who were close to the previous BJP-led regime. The members are Muchkund Dubey, Gharekhan, Brahma Chellaney G. Parthasarathy, Hamid Ansari and Vinod Grover. 

 ?The group is expected to meet on a regular basis to deliberate on international issues and advise Singh on international developments and the foreign policy options available to India,? a ministry statement said.

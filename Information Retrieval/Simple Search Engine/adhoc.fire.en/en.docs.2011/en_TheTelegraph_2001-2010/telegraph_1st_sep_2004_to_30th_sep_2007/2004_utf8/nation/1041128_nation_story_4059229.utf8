 Singh: Rare honour

 Chandimandir, Nov. 27: Lt Gen. Joginder Jaswant Singh, the head of the Western Command, was today named chief of army staff and will succeed General Nirmal Chand Vij when he retires on January 31 next year.

 Singh, the seniormost lieutenant general, is the first Sikh officer to be named to the army?s top post. 

 The officer is the 11th Western Command head to take over as army chief ? Singh assumed charge at the Western Command on February 1 this year.

 The lieutenant general was commissioned into the 9 Maratha Light Infantry in August 1964.

 Singh has seen a variety of first-hand combat during his 12 years in the field. He has been decorated with the AVSM and VSM while commanding troops and during his stint at the military operations directorate. He served as additional director-general and became the army?s public face during the Kargil conflict. 

 Singh was awarded the Param Vishisht Sewa Medal ? India?s highest peacetime military award ? on Republic Day this year.

 He was seriously wounded in anti-terrorist operations in Jammu and Kashmir as a mountain brigade commander and received the War Wound Medal and a commendation from the chief of army staff.

 There was jubilation at the Western Command headquarters here near Chandigarh, after news of Singh?s appointment spread.

 ?We are extremely pleased at the general?s appointment that has come after 12 years. It was in 1992 that Lt Gen. B.C. Joshi was appointed chief. Since then, this major forward strike command has not seen anyone at the top?? a senior officer said.

 Lt Gen. Singh was not available for comment, but close relatives said his elevation was a ?bolt from the blue? as other senior officers were in the running for the post. ?But we are extremely happy. It is a joyous occasion and calls for celebration,? a relative said.

 Western Command sources said Singh?s closest rival was General Hari Prasad, GOC-in-C of the Northern Command. National Defence Academy batchmates, both the officers were commissioned on the same day ? August 2, 1964. 

 However, Singh nosed ahead on Indian Commission number: his is IC 16078 to Prasad?s IC 16109.

 ?Forty years ago, neither could have guessed that the top seat would boil down not to passing grades but some minutes? seniority in the commissioning,? an officer said.

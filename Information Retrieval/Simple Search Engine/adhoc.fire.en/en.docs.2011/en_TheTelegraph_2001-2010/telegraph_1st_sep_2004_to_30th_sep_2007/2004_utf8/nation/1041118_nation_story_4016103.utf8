 Custody death cloud on cops

 R. VENKATARAMAN

 New Delhi, Nov. 17: Taking serious note of the ?widespread? deaths in police custody, the Supreme Court today upheld the conviction of a Madhya Pradesh police officer responsible for brutal torture of a convict that killed him 20 years ago.

 A division bench of Justices Arijit Pasayat and C.K. Thakker said ?the diabolic recurrence of police torture? results in scaring common people ?because guardians of law destroy human rights by custodial violence and torture, and invariably resulting in death?.

 The state functionaries? ?paramount duty is to protect the citizens and not to commit gruesome offences against them?, the judges pointed out.

 Shambhu Tyagi had been brought to a police station in Madhya Pradesh at midnight on June 19, 1984. He was beaten up severely for a confessional statement, resulting in his death. A trial court and the high court convicted the police officer in-charge.

 The apex court today sounded a warning to trial courts against evidence given by fellow policemen in cases of custody deaths. ?Bound as they are by the ties of brotherhood, it is not unknown that the police personnel prefer to remain silent and more often than not even pervert the truth to save their colleagues,? the bench said. 

 It cited Tyagi?s case as an ?apt illustration as to how one after the other police witnesses feigned ignorance about the whole matter?.

 The judges condemned ?the exaggerated adherence to and insistence upon the establishment of proof beyond every reasonable doubt by the prosecution? ignoring the ground realities?, which, they said, ?often results in miscarriage of justice?. 

 The judges said ?custodial violence, torture and abuse of police powers? are a global problem and pointed to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which says ?no one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment?.

 However, the bench rued that ?despite this pious declaration, the crime continues unabated, though every civilised nation shows its concern and makes efforts for its eradication?.

 In a veiled attack on politicians, the judges said the evil ?is assuming alarming proportions merely on account of the devilish devices adopted by those at the helm of affairs, who proclaim from rooftops to be the defenders of democracy and protectors of people?s rights?. Yet, they do not hesitate to let loose their men in uniform to settle personal scores?.

 The court said police excesses not only tarnish the image of a civilised society but also encourage ?men in khaki to consider themselves to be above law and sometimes even to become law unto themselves?.

 The judges advised trial courts to ?deal with such cases in a realistic manner and with the sensitivity they deserve?. Otherwise, they said, the common man may gradually lose faith in the efficacy of the system?.

 They added that ?it is the duty of the police to collect evidence when a crime is reported. That certainly would not include torturing a person?. Law enforcers cannot take law into their hands in the name of collecting evidence?.

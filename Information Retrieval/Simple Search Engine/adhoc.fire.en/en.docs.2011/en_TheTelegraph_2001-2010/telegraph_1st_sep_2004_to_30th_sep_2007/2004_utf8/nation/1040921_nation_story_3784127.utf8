 Sonia before Singh in J amp;K

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN AND K. SUBRAHMANYA

 New Delhi, Sept. 20: Sonia Gandhi might touch down in Jammu and Kashmir before either Manmohan Singh or Shivraj Patil, highly placed Congress sources said.

 Sources in the government confirmed that such a trip is on the cards by the end of the month, saying the dates are being worked out and it could be before the campaign for the Maharashtra polls takes off.

 Political parties are expected to kick off their campaign for next month?s elections after September 28, when the Ganpati festival concludes.

 Explaining why Sonia would visit the troubled state, the sources said: ?It is appropriate because she is the mass leader in the Congress and, therefore, best suited to reach out to the people.? The Congress chief is expected to prepare the ground, as it were, for the Prime Minister?s prospective visit to Srinagar and Jammu.

 If the trip materialises, it will be Sonia?s first ? and also the first by any United Progressive Alliance leader ? since the coalition formed the government at the Centre. Singh was to have gone to Srinagar on September 16 but did not because the Election Commission?s model code of conduct was in place in the state where bypolls are being held.

 Singh?s advisers reportedly felt that rather than make a perfunctory visit, he should wait till the bypolls are over so that he is in a position to announce a package and inaugurate projects.

 The other reason being mentioned by Congress sources is ?political?. The Congress, which is part of the ruling coalition in the state, has not had an easy time with its ally, the People?s Democratic Party (PDP). There is a feeling that the PDP functions unilaterally ? as when chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed curtailed the duration of the Amarnath yatra and introduced the controversial domicile bill before the Lok Sabha polls ? and is out to consolidate its base at the Congress? expense.

 The Congress? counter was to expand its own turf, which it did by inducting six Independent legislators to swell its numbers.

 Sources said the Prime Minister, whose forte is not politics but who had nonetheless planned to interact with party workers in the state, may have found the situation ?too hot? to handle. Patil deferred his trip when the Prime Minister changed his plans. Official sources said the Union home minister was also waiting for something ?substantive? to happen on the Hurriyat front before landing in the Valley. 

 If Sonia?s proposed visit is part of a discreet strategy to fine-tune government-party co-ordination, the campaign schedules of the Prime Minister and the Congress president for the Maharashtra elections will be another component of this effort. Government sources said the dates and the places will be ?carefully choreographed? to avoid what was described as a ?clash of perception? on the response the two leaders evoke.

 While Singh is likely to address meetings in urban centres ? Mumbai, Pune and Nagpur ? Sonia will go on a ?jan sampark abhiyaan? (mass contact campaign) on the lines of her Uttar Pradesh roadshow.

 ?The idea is we don?t want comparisons. We don?t want people to say Sonia got a crowd of three lakh in Nagpur and Singh only, 30,000,? a source said.

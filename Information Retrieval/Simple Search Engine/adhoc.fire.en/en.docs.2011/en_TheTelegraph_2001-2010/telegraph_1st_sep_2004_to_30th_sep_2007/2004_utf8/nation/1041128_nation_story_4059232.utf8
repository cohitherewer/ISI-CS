 Rahul: Stemming the rot

 Lucknow, Nov. 27: Rahul Gandhi has set himself a new task ? harness youth power in Uttar Pradesh to stem the rot in the Congress. 

 The first-time MP from Amethi has formed a youth brigade that includes three MPs and four legislators from the state. To prepare them for the plunge, he has lined up a three-day crash course on economics, parliamentary affairs and panchayat laws in Noida next month.

 The crash course will be followed by a brainstorming session in Varanasi, expected to be addressed by his mother, Congress chief Sonia Gandhi.

 Sources said these exercises are aimed at motivating state Congress leaders to implement the young Gandhi?s concept of development politics to counter the politics of caste which, Rahul concedes, has contributed to the erosion of the party?s support base in the heartland.

 The Congress, which had a strength of about 260 in the early eighties, is now reduced to a mere 25 seats in the 403-member Assembly. In the bypoll early this month, it drew a blank.

 The Rahul formula is being implemented under the leadership of new state unit chief Salman Khursheed. ?Rahul is an asset in the party. He will be joining us on a suitable platform we are working diligently for. We are putting together a team which will be at the vanguard of programme implementation involving the youth,? Khursheed said.

 Khursheed argued that caste politics, which propelled the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party, is ?an accident in history?. These parties, he added, are bound to run out of steam once the backward castes realise they cannot fulfil their aspirations.

 The ?Team Rahul? being readied for ?Operation UP? consists of MPs Jatin Prasad from Shahjahanpur, Chaudhary Brijendra from Aligarh and Rajesh Mishra from Varanasi. The four MLAs are Vivek Bansal from Aligarh, R.P.N. Singh, Kushinagar, Sanjeev Dariyabadi, Kanpur, and Ajay Kapur from Govindanagar.

 Khursheed, who is busy striking up a rapport with all factions, will be joined by former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Digvijay Singh. The sources said Digvijay might be made an additional in-charge of party affairs in Uttar Pradesh.

 Khursheed confirmed that Digvijay would have a role in the revamp. ?Oh yes, he will be with us soon,? he said.

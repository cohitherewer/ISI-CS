 Rail remedy

 New Delhi, Dec. 22 (PTI): A parliamentary committee has identified human failure as the factor most responsible for train accidents and recommended that railway staff should not work more than eight hours at a stretch to ensure passenger safety and security.

 The committee on railways has suggested in its fifth report presented to Parliament today that the 10-hour daily roster system should be reviewed. At times, operational staff, especially gangmen and drivers, have to work 22 to 24 hours in a row.

 The panel said the staff should not work more than eight hours as drivers have to concentrate for long periods and stress, fatigue or even a slight deviation could cause a mishap. 

 The committee recommends that competent instructors with good educational background and training acumen should be employed at a decent salary. It says trainers? skills should also be upgraded from time to time and adds that the railway ministry should strive to reach a zero-accident rate.

 The panel felt the 20,000-odd Group D vacancies in the safety category and 3,500 posts in the Railway Protection Force should be filled up. It said further vacancies for additional work after new trains are introduced should be filled within six months.

 Observing that the modernisation drive and the move to renew and maintain tracks lacks direction, the committee said a proper survey of routes and infrastructure capacity should be done before more trains are introduced and frequency is increased.

 The panel said the system was over-stretched and over-stressed and suggested that the railway network should be expanded and technological installations upgraded.

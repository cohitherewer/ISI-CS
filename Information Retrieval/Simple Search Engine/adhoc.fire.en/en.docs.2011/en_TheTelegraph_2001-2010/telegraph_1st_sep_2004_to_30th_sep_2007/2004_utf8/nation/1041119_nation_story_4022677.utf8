 Mulayam denies Cong bias

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 18: Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav today dismissed Sonia Gandhi?s charge that his government was discriminating against Rae Bareli and Amethi, represented in the Lok Sabha by her and her son, Rahul, respectively. 

 The Samajwadi Party chief said he would have appreciated if she had written to him instead of approaching the media even as the Congress claimed that Sonia had sent a letter to Mulayam Singh, bringing to his notice the ?step-motherly? treatment of the constituencies. 

 Mulayam Singh also took a dig at Sonia for her concern for Rae Bareli and Amethi, saying ?Gandhi should also have concern for other regions, like Bundelkhand, central UP, Sambhal, Etawah, Mainpuri districts?.

 The chief minister was here today to inaugurate the state pavilion at the International Trade Promotion Organisation?s annual fest at Pragati Maidan.

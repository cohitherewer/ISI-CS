 Left vetoes EC role in Iraq

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 28: The Manmohan Singh government will not send Election Commission officials to train Iraqis for the polls due early next year, the Left said today.

 ?The government agreed with us that there was no question of giving either military or civil assistance to Iraqis,? said CPI?s D. Raja after leaders of four Left parties met Singh for breakfast at his 7 Race Course Road residence.

 ?The Prime Minister told us Parliament has already passed a resolution against sending Indian troops to Iraq,? said Raja. The same principle would be extended to any civilian assistance as long as Iraq remains under US occupation.

 Left leaders said both political and security concerns motivated the stand. ?If Iraqis want lessons on how to conduct elections, they can come to India through the United Nations. The government can then consider their request,? said Raja.

 National security adviser J.. Dixit did most of the talking at the meeting, which focused on foreign policy. Left leaders want the government to raise the issue of democracy during talks with Myanmar?s military ruler General Than Shwe, who is in the country.

 ?We recognise the need for a dialogue with the ruling military regime to stop terrorist activities and drug trafficking from across the border. But at the same time, the Indian government must also underscore its support for the National League for Democracy,? said Raja.

 The Left is now widening its ambit of engagement with the government from economic issues to foreign policy and political matters. At the breakfast meeting, the Left iterated its demand that the Centre must break with the previous NDA government?s pro-Israel policies. ?We asked the government to condemn the attacks on Gaza Strip,? said Raja.

 The contentious economic policies on which the Left and the government have differences will be discussed at the UPA-Left co-ordination committee meeting likely to be held early next month.

 Yesterday, leaders of the four Left parties ? the CPM, CPI, RSP and the Forward Bloc ? met and chalked out the agenda for the next co-ordination committee meeting. The Left has expressed ?concern? over the government?s decision to divest shares in 35 public sector undertakings, including those making profits. It wants the government to stick to the common minimum programme, which favours autonomy for the PSUs so that they can decide whether to offload shares in the capital market.

 The CPM politburo will meet in the capital tomorrow to take stock of the government?s functioning and discuss the party?s political and organisational report that will be adopted at the congress scheduled in April.

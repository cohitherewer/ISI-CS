 Bhopal, Nov. 28 (PTI): 

 At least 12 youths were run over today by a speeding train 

 at Sukhi Sevania railway station, 5 km from here.

 Eight youths were injured, one critically, police said, adding that the victims were mostly college students.

 The 12 were crushed to death by the Chennai-Lucknow Superfast Express while they were crossing the railway track after alighting from the Bhopal-Bina passenger train. The bodies were mutilated, making identification difficult.

 The victims, most of whom were residents of Rahul Nagar here, were on their way to a fair at Sanchi, the police said. 

 Railway and police sources said the youths, instead of getting off on the platform, got on to the tracks apparently in a hurry to catch another train for Sanchi.

 The railway announced an ex gratia of Rs 1,00,000 to each bereaved family and Rs 15,000 each to the injured.

 This is in addition to the Rs 1,00,000 compensation announced by the Madhya Pradesh government to the next of kin of the deceased and Rs 25,000 each to the injured.

 A magisterial inquiry has been ordered, said Madhya Pradesh health minister Gaurishankar Shejwar, who visited the scene.

 Railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav has expressed grief over the tragedy.

 The deceased include Rahul Nagar residents Ajay Bhavaskar (17), Vishal Parde (18), Ashok Ambure (22), Nitesh (20), Sanjay Bhavaskar (25), Pinki Kumar Vishwakarma (20), Rajesh Chouhan, Mangesh Joshi (18), Rahul alias Deepu (18) and Sunil Sarodkar (19), as well as Dinesh Jhamke (26) and Anil Ingle (18) of Shiv Nagar, railway sources said.

 Sunil Dopare (19), who was critically injured, was admitted to Hamidia hospital here while seven others were discharged after first-aid, the sources said. 

 Divisional railway manager D.P. Pandey, who inspected the scene shortly after the accident, denied that there was any lapse on part of railway officials, but said the facts would surface after a probe. 

 Train services have resumed and police personnel have been deployed to keep the situation under control, he said.

 Relief medical vans from Bhopal have also reached the site, a railway spokesperson said, adding that there was no damage to the tracks or rolling stock.

 Confusion prevailed at Sukhi Sevania station for some time when a crowd had gathered at the accident site. A large crowd also gathered at Hamidia hospital where the bodies were taken for identification.

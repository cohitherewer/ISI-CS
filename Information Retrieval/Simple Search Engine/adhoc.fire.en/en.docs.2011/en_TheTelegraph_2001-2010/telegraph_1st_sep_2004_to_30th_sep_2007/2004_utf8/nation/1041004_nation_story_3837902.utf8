 CPM calls for blasts action 

 New Delhi, Oct. 3: Expressing shock over the twin blasts in Nagaland and rebel strikes in Assam, the CPM today asked the Centre to work out a strategy with the states to counter terrorism, reports our special correspondent. 

 In a statement, the CPM politburo said ?the pre-meditated manner in which the bombs were placed at a railway station and a market (in Nagaland) shows the aim of these attacks is to disrupt peaceful atmosphere in the state?.

 ?The state government and the Centre should spare no effort to identify the culprits and apprehend them,? the statement said. 

 The CPM said ?the growing trend of extremist groups resorting to indiscriminate violence must be countered by firm action and popular mobilisation to isolate them?.

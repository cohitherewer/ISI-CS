 Centre drops quick-fix security

 SEEMA GUHA

 New Delhi, Dec. 19: The Manmohan Singh government has a clearly defined strategy to deal with internal security, though the rhetoric is not as high-pitched as it was during the reign of the National Democratic Alliance.

 The new policy?s contours are based on a rational and pragmatic three-pronged approach that will give long-term results and may not deliver quick-fix and dramatic results.

 Security forces will be deployed to crush armed insurrection against the state. No tolerance will be shown to those who want to take up arms.

 But separatist groups that have renounced armed struggle will be welcome. The United Progressive Alliance government is ready to talk to any militant outfit willing to give up arms and opt for a negotiated settlement.

 There will be ?connectivity?, too, which means the Centre will try to get the state government concerned involved.

 The approach is measured in dealing with the various militant outfits ? be it the Naxalites in Andhra Pradesh, the rebel groups of the Northeast or Kashmiri separatists, according to highly placed sources in the cabinet.

 The Congress-led Centre has been severely criticised in Parliament?s ongoing session by the BJP and its allies for a ?soft? approach to terrorism, internal security and handling of the People?s War Group. BJP leaders in the House have claimed that the UPA is turning India into a soft state and the country will have to suffer its consequences. 

 The Opposition?s criticism notwithstanding, the government is in no mood to change its stand and believes there is no need to cry from the rooftop about the country?s determination to wipe out terrorism.

 Neither are restrictions necessary on individuals and groups committed to peace, the sources said. The Centre will allow Kashmiri separatists to visit Pakistan and wherever else they wish to travel.

 Delhi is for the first time encouraging intra-Kashmir dialogue by allowing the separatists to meet leaders from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.

 This happened at the recent Pugwash conference in Kathmandu, which was attended by important Hurriyat Conference leaders, except Syed Ali Shah Geelani. Earlier, Mirwaiz Umer Farooq travelled to Amsterdam and had a meeting with Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf. Delhi accepted this without a fuss.

 The NDA regime had imposed restrictions on travel by the Hurriyat leaders and several of their requests to visit PoK or Islamabad had been turned down by then deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani.

 The present government?s decision to allow Kashmiri separatist leaders to attend the Kathmandu meeting helped create the right atmosphere for peace in the region, the sources said. Kashmiris on both sides of the Line of Control agreed that violence was not the answer to the Kashmir issue and that a solution had to be found through negotiation. 

 There was no demand for the Hurriyat factions to unite to put up a more spirited fight against Delhi and the Kashmiri leaders welcomed the current India-Pakistan dialogue. Such meetings, the sources said, would help build confidence on both sides.

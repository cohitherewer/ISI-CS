 Indians in backyard, Musharraf talks peace

 IMTIAZ GUL 

 Islamabad, Dec. 14: President Pervez Musharraf called for lasting peace in South Asia on a day Indian and Pakistani delegations began the latest round of talks on a host of confidence-building measures. 

 He was addressing information ministers of Saarc states, who are here to attend a two-day conference beginning here tomorrow. 

 ?Media in South Asia can serve as a catalyst in promoting peace and harmony for the collective well-being of one-fifth of humanity living in the region. 

 ?We can provide better economic opportunities to our people by establishing durable peace through resolution of our disputes,? he said, referring to the Kashmir dispute. 

 The Saarc ministers are expected to discuss ways to promote media cooperation in the region. Since the first conference in Dhaka in April 1998, little has been achieved towards that end as was enshrined in a plan of action adopted in the meet. 

 Pakistan hosted the second meet in 2002 and India the one last year. The meetings in the intervening period could not be held owing to postponement of summit-level meetings for three years. 

 The Pakistani and Indian officials opened the second round of two-day talks here focusing on measures to avoid accidental nuclear catastrophe and a draft agreement on prior notification of missile tests. 

 Indian officials had handed over the draft to a Pakistani delegation during first round of talks in New Delhi in June. 

 Officials here expect substantial progress towards a broad agreement on ?strategic stability? encompassing both nuclear and conventional restraint during the talks. 

 Pakistan and India have already signed an agreement in 1991 not to attack each other?s nuclear installations. Moreover, they exchange lists of their nuclear facilities at the start of every year. 

 The teams will hold talks on conventional confidence building measures tomorrow. The Pakistani delegation is expected to ask for symmetry in conventional arms between the countries. 

 Top defence officials from the two countries are also meeting in the garrison town of Rawalpindi to discuss a dispute over a common boundary in the Sir Creek area in Gujarat. The two countries will finalise a joint statement in the last round of talks tomorrow.

 This is the first time that at least five Indian delegations are in Pakistan for talks to promote mutual trust in the area of defence since the start of the peace process early this year. 

 These talks are taking place ahead of a meeting between the Pakistani and Indian foreign secretaries scheduled in Islamabad on December 27-28. 

 The top diplomats will review progress in the composite dialogue, which began in February, and work out a schedule for the next round of meetings on the eight agenda items.

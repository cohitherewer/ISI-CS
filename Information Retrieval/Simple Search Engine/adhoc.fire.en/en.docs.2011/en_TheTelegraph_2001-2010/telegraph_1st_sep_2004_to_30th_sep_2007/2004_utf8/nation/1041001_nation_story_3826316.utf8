 Text tussle

 New Delhi, Sept. 30: The Congress and the BJP today traded blame for the glorification of Hitler and Mussolini in Gujarat schoolbooks in a barely concealed attempt to flog the latest text controversy for the Maharashtra polls, reports our special correspondent.

 Earlier, the Congress-led regime in Kerala had come under fire from the BJP for omitting Gujarat from the national anthem printed in a textbook. The state had apologised to Gujarat.

 Congress spokesman Anand Sharma today said ?voters in Maharashtra? should take into account how the BJP government in neighbouring Gujarat had made a hero of dictators while belittling Mahatma Gandhi?s role in the freedom struggle.

 But the BJP asserted that the Narendra Modi government had not authored the textbook. It was brought out in 1986 during Congress rule in the state, party spokesman Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said.

 Change in rape FIR ?formula?

 - Delay in reporting assault 

not escape hatch: SC

 R. VENKATARAMAN

 New Delhi, Sept. 15: Observing that a rape accused cannot use delay in filing an FIR ?as a ritualistic formula? to escape conviction, the Supreme Court has sentenced a teacher to seven years? imprisonment and fined him Rs 5,000 for sexually assaulting a student.

 A division bench of Justices Arijit Passayat and Prakash Prabhakar Naolekar on Monday ruled that lower courts could not ?disregard? the prosecution case because an FIR had been filed late.

 In this case, a teacher in Himachal Pradesh continued to sexually abuse a student ?of tender age?, who ?out of fear? did not tell anyone. When she continued to complain of stomach pain her mother took her to a doctor who confirmed ?pregnancy? with a gestation of 28 weeks. The girl then told her mother of the assaults and an FIR was filed.

 A trial court sentenced the teacher to seven years? imprisonment and fined him Rs 5,000 but on appeal the high court raised doubts because of the delay in filing the FIR. The court added that there was no evidence to prove the Class IV student had not consented to sex and acquitted the accused.

 Setting aside the high court judgment, the Supreme Court said in rape cases ?there is no rule of law that her (the victim?s) testimony cannot be acted upon without corroboration?. The judges said a rape victim ?stands at a higher pedestal than an injured witness?.

 The apex court said that ?delay in lodging a first information report cannot be used as a ritualistic formula for discarding a prosecution case and doubting its authenticity?. It said trial courts and high courts should only consider ?if any explanation has been offered? for the delay in lodging the FIR and ?once it (explanation) is offered, the court is to only see whether it is satisfactory or not?.

 ?Satisfactory explanation (for the delay) is weighty enough to reject the plea of false implication or vulnerability of a prosecution case? against the accused, the apex court said. In this case, which dates back to 1993, ?the victim was totally unaware of the catastrophe which had befallen her. That being so, the mere delay in lodging of the first information report doesn?t in any way render prosecution version brittle?, the bench added.

 The Himachal teacher made the girl wait till classes ended to clear her doubts and then bolted the classroom from inside to sexually assault her. ?Her cries were not heard from outside,? the court pointed out. The teacher also threatened to throw her into a river if she told anyone of the assault. He then called her home with three other students and after sending them off, abused her again. 

 The victim did not have the courage to inform her parents but her pregnancy revealed what had occurred. The Supreme Court said the ?sacred relation of teacher and his pupil was besmirched? by the assault and that ?such offenders are a menace to civilised society?. 

 It said a sexual offence is an unlawful intrusion on a woman?s privacy and sanctity and ?is a serious blow to her supreme honour and offends her self esteem and dignity. It disregards and humiliates the victim and where the victim is a helpless innocent child or a minor, it leaves behind a traumatic experience?.

 ?A rapist not only causes physical injuries but more indelibly leaves a scar on the most cherished possession of a woman, her dignity, honour, reputation and not the least, her chastity. Rape is not only a crime against the person of a woman, it is a crime against the entire society. It is a crime against basic human rights and is also violative of the victim?s most cherished of fundamental rights, namely, the right to life,? Justice Passayat, writing for the bench, said.

 He said sexual crime cases should be dealt with utmost sensitivity. 

 ?Such cases need to be dealt with sternly and severely? and ?a socially sensitised judge is a better statutory armour in cases of crime against women than long clauses of penal provisions containing complex exceptions and provisos,? he said.

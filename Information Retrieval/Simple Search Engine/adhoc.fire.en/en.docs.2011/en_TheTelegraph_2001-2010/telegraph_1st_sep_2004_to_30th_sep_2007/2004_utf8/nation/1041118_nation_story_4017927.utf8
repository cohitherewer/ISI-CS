 Left fumes at short sessions

 New Delhi, Nov. 17: The Left has found a new stick to beat the government with.

 CPI leaders today accused the Manmohan Singh government of deliberately shortening the winter session of Parliament to dodge discussions on crucial issues.

 The winter session of Parliament usually begins in November and lasts five weeks. But this time, it starts on December 1 and concludes 22 days later ? making it the shortest session in India?s parliamentary history. The government has not stated any reason for the move.

 ?Parliament sittings are becoming meaningless,? CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan said at a news conference today. ?The government has been assuring us of a lot of discussions. But the session will last barely 17 days if you exclude the weekends. Where will there be time for any serious discussion?? he asked.

 The CPI has demanded that Parliament be in session for at least 100 days a year. It wants a code of conduct to be framed to ensure it functions smoothly.

 ?An ineffective Parliament gives rise to authoritarianism,? CPI MP Gurudas Dasgupta said. It is being speculated that the government has curbed the winter session because it fears trouble from the BJP. The main Opposition party has repeatedly stalled Parliament since the United Progressive Alliance government assumed power.

 But the CPI does not think this justifies shortening the session. ?If the BJP is responsible for disrupting Parliament, the government is responsible for not allowing a meaningful Parliament,? Dasgupta said.

 He clarified that Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee, who belongs to the CPM, has no role in the decision since it is the government that decides the schedule.

 The CPI leadership reeled off statistics to show how successive governments of various hues have shortened parliamentary sessions since 1952.

 Parliament met for 137 days in 1953, but only 105 days in 1981. That number dipped to 102 seven years later. ?After 1975, there was a new feature of a Parliament session spanning less than 100 days,? Dasgupta said. Parliament was in session for a mere 51 days in 1999 when the National Democratic Alliance came to power. ?In 2004, it will be 59 days,? the MP added.

 ?Over the years the tendency to bypass and ignore Parliament has gained ground. Manmohan Singh, when in Opposition, had supported me when I had raised this issue. Now in the seat of governance, he is doing the same,? Dasgupta said.

 Bail denied for sex

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Ahmedabad, Sept. 13: The 

 law has come in the way of Firozkhan Zafarkhan?s conjugal 

 rights.

 The Godhra accused had on August 18 applied for a 30-day temporary bail on the ground that he needed to go home to satisfy his physical desires. Today, Sonia Gokani, the designated judge of the anti-terror court, refused to grant him bail.

 The judge, who heard the arguments on September 2, said the accused is involved in a serious crime because of which some of his rights are bound to be curtailed.

 Firozkhan had sought bail on ?humanitarian ground?. He said his prolonged imprisonment and abstention was causing his wife immense stress.

 Ashok D. Shah, the counsel for the petitioner, argued that his client was ?mentally perturbed? after 30 months of incarceration. The court, he said, should consider the plight of Firozkhan?s wife, who is innocent.

 Shah argued there was no harm in allowing an accused bail if his conduct was good. He also underlined the importance of an undertrial mixing with society for a limited period as it would ensure that he is not seen as an outsider when he comes out of jail.

 But public prosecutor H.M. Dhruv contended that conjugal rights were not a constitutional right and that bail should not be granted on grounds that the rights were being curtailed.

 Dhruv also argued that this would set a precedent and encourage similar applications. Moreover, he added, there had been no request from the wife of the accused.

 Pak bus talks hit roadblock

 SEEMA GUHA

 New Delhi, Dec. 7: Indian and Pakistani officials are making the right noises publicly, even though talks on the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus service have hit a roadblock.

 The differences centre around travel documents to be used by passengers to cross the Line of Control.

 ?Technical talks between India and Pakistan on the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus service started today and there was an exchange of views. They will continue tomorrow,? was the terse one-liner from foreign office spokesman Navtej Sarna.

 ?We covered a lot of issues. Discussions were very good and are continuing. We will now meet tomorrow,? the leader of the Pakistan team, Jalil Abbas Jillani, director-general, South Asia division in the Pakistan foreign office, said.

 India today came up with a new proposal for entry permits to be used by the bus passengers. Passports have to be carried but will not be stamped. Instead the entry permit will contain the data that the visa generally carries.

 Delhi thinks it is showing some flexibility by suggesting entry permits along with the passport. ?The passport will not be stamped,? an Indian official said. ?But the passport has to be carried to establish the person?s nationality.?

 Pakistan has made it clear that it is against using passports as the basic identity document since it regards Kashmir as ?disputed? territory. Accepting Indian passports for Kashmiris would amount to accepting Delhi?s claim that the region is part of India.

 Realising Pakistan?s problem, India softened its stand somewhat and is now talking about entry permits.

 India also said the entry permits would have to be issued and processed by the high commissions in Islamabad and Delhi.

 India wants the bus route to be open to all Indian and Pakistani citizens and not just Kashmiris.

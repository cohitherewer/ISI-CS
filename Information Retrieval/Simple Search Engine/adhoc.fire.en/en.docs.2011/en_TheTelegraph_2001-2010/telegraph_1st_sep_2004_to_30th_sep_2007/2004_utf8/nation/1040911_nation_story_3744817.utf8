 Lawyer-cop clash replay

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 10: Days after lawyers in Lucknow went on strike to protest police violence against colleagues, their counterparts here besieged the Karkardooma lower courts after an associate was allegedly attacked by a sub-inspector.

 The lawyers said advocate Ravinder was beaten up in the Karkardooma courts by a sub-inspector posted in the Shahdara area around noon. Ravinder had gone to the court of additional sessions judge S.P. Garg for a bail hearing.

 The lawyer and sub-inspector began to argue and came to blows. The sub-inspector was injured and began to bleed profusely from his right eye.

 Other lawyers surrounded Garg and when his colleagues tried to help, they surrounded the courtroom and shouted slogans against the police. The sub-inspector had to be led out from the judges? exit and was taken to hospital.

 The joint commissioner of police, the deputy commissioner of police (crime) and the DCP, East District, tried to placate the lawyers, but to no avail.

 The Shahdara Bar Association comprising lawyers from the Karkardooma courts has decided to go on an indefinite strike from Monday. Lawyers from lower courts at Tis Hazari and Patiala House could join them.

 Rap on vacant MBBS seats

 New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Wednesday ordered the directorate-general of health services (DGHS) to fill 160 seats in the MBBS and dental courses that are vacant in the 15 per cent all-India quota, reports our legal correspondent.

 This is the first time that the vacant seats in the quota have been ordered to be filled up. 

 The order came on a batch of petitions by students who made it to the merit list of the Central Board of Secondary Education in the All India Medical Quota, but could not get seats because the 15 per cent quota was not full. A three-judge bench of Justices Y.K. Sabharwal, D.M. Dharmadhikari and P.K.I. Balasubramanyan also said this extended counselling would not be open to those candidates who have already taken admission in MBBS courses.

 The 160 seats 122 seats for MBBS and 38 seats in BDS (dental) were vacant in Bihar, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Bengal. If these were not filled, the vacant seats would go to the respective state quotas.

 The DGHS has been told to complete its second round of counselling by September 8 and the successful candidates would be admitted by September 13, the court said in its order.

 Suicide over caste certificate

Pondicherry (PTI): A 16-year-old tribal girl committed suicide 

in a village near here after reportedly being unable to get a caste certificate, 

officials said. 

 Lalitha, a Scheduled Tribe member, hanged herself on Tuesday in her house. 

 Revenue authorities, however, said they could not issue the community certificate as there was no recognition for Scheduled Tribes in Pondicherry. 

 The government of Pondicherry had already written to the Centre to give its clearance for recognition of Scheduled Tribes residing here and to earmark the one per cent reservation for them in educational institutions. The reply from the Centre is awaited.

 On Wednesday, residents of Arumbathapuram village, where Lalitha stayed, and her parents staged a dharna near the Assembly to bring to the governments notice the hardships faced by the Scheduled Tribes in procuring caste certificates.

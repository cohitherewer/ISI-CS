 Opp. sticks to CBI probe demand

 DEBABRATA MOHANTY

 Bhubaneswar, Dec. 21: The Vedanta issue continued to rock the Orissa Assembly with the Congress today sticking to its demand for a CBI probe into alleged irregularities in a mining deal.

 On the same day, the two-member central team from the ministry of environment and forests seemed to give a clean chit to Vedanta Alumina. 

 Under pressure from the Opposition, Speaker Maheswar Mohanty allowed a discussion on the government?s mining agreement with Vedanta, a subsidiary of the Sterlite Group. 

 Leader of Opposition J.B. Patnaik, Congress MLA Lalatendu Mohapatra and Orissa Gana Parishad member Arun Dey dubbed the agreement with Vedanta as a ?shady deal? arguing that the government had deliberately avoided a global tender to favour the company. 

 The Opposition leaders alleged that the alumina project would affect 580.8 hectares of forest land in Kalahandi. Seeking cancellation of the agreement with Vedanta, Patnaik and others demanded that a CBI probe be initiated to unearth the truth.

 Orissa steel and mines minister Padmanabh Behera refuted the allegations said his government entered into the agreement on the basis of a memorandum of understanding signed between Sterlite and then Congress government in 1997. He added that the earlier deal had objectionable features.

 Defending the agreement with Vedanta during his tenure, Patnaik said there was low demand for alumina and aluminium in the global market when he signed the MoU in 1997. So, the government agreed to some concessions. ?Now that the aluminium market is on a high, industrial houses will automatically come to us. There is no need to give concessions,? he said. 

 After the minister refused to give in to the demands for cancellation of the deal and a CBI probe, the entire Opposition staged a walkout.

 In the other development of the day, the two-member central team said Vedanta had not violated forest norms. ?I can say for sure that they (Vedanta) have not constructed or done anything wrong in the reserve forest area or in places controlled by the forest department,? team member S.C. Sharma said at Bhawanipatna today. 

 Reports from Lanjigarh said a large number of people travelled with the probe team. The project in its current form will adversely affect the tribals and rivers of the area, the local residents alleged.

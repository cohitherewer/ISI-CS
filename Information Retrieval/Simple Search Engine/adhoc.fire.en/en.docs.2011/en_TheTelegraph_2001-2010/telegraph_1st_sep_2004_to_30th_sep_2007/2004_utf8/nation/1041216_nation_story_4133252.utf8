 High court to scribe rescue

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Dec. 15: Patna High Court today cautioned the West Champaran district administration against taking action on the local reporter of Bettiah, who faced murder charges after writing a story on extortion calls being made from the jail there.

 Upholding the freedom of expression and protection of the media from harassment by the state, the division bench of acting Chief Justice Nagendra Rai and Justice S.N. Hussain recorded the statements of parties involved in the case.

 ?Prima facie, the FIR appears to be manipulated. This is interference in the judicial process and violation of the rule of law,? the bench observed. The court also said protection of the media, which is an important component of democracy, is its constitutional duty.

 While directing the administration to stop all action on the reporter, Vikas Kumar Singh, the court asked the government to consider transferring the superintendent of police of West Champaran, Paras Nath.

 The bench further observed that the investigation might be hampered if Nath remained in office.

 Taking cognisance of media reports on alleged extortion calls made by Manoj Mishra, an inmate of Bettiah jail, to Narkatiaganj-based doctor Ranjan Kumar Deonath, the court on November 25 had directed the police to immediately lodge an FIR. But the police did not lodge a case before November 29. 

 In another development, the court remarked that cellphone operators should take extra caution before they issue fresh connections. It asked the operators to consider getting the antecedents of applicants verified by the police in order to prevent mobile phones from falling in wrong hands. 

 The court had on Monday summoned the three mobile service providers in the state ? Reliance Infocomm, Reliance Telecom and BSNL ? to appear before it to explain what steps they took before issuing connections. The case came up after the seizure of mobile phones during raids conducted by Bihar Military Police personnel on jails across the state on December 8, including the one used by Pappu Yadav 

 In another ruling, the court ordered the Patna Municipal Corporation to remove garbage from public places in the city within a week. Over 3,000 municipal employees have been on an indefinite strike to press their demand the regular payment of salary, among others.

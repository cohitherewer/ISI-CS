 Scam son cleared, Amarinder hits out

 GAJINDER SINGH

 Chandigarh, Dec. 22: Amarinder Singh today lashed out at critics, blaming ?vested interests? for a scandal dogging his son for nearly a year. 

 Reports in a national daily since last December have said that Raninder, the chief minister?s son, had tried to barter a deal with a Holland-based family friend on behalf of Punjab Intranet Limited, a state firm tasked to lay fibre-optic cables. The reports also alleged that over $100,000 were illegally sent to Raninder through hawala channels.

 But according to Amarinder, the daily which published the reports and some ?vested interests? are to blame. 

 ?I have asked the public relations department to make public the report of the Justice Nehra Commission which I had appointed to look into the matter after it surfaced on December 28 last year?. The report suggests the registration of a criminal case against the daily and clears us from any wrongdoing,? the chief minister said.

 ?The commission has found that the documents published are not genuine. The allegations are also baseless.? He said legal opinion would be sought to initiate criminal proceedings against the newspaper.

 But the Nehra Commission has also been accused of a partisan probe as Raninder?s friend, Ronald Freeke, was never called to depose before it.

 The chief minister, however, junked the allegation. ?It is not true. He (Freeke) has replied to each and every question that was asked by the commission. He was even offered economic class fare to Chandigarh from Holland to depose. But he did not come.? 

 Amarinder alleged that the allegations against his son were raised when he was facing dissidence in the state with many senior leaders demanding his ouster. ?There is more to the story than meets the eye,? he said, declining to name any Congress leader who may be behind the scandal.

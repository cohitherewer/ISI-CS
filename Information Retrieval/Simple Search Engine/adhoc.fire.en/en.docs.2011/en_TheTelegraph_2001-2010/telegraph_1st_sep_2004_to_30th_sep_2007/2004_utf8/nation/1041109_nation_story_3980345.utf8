 Naga whack at ?wicked? policy

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The Hague, Nov. 8: The leaders of the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isak-Muivah) seem to be having second thoughts about visiting India for an intensive and structured dialogue with the government.

 Thuingaleng Muivah, the general secretary of the NSCN (I-M) currently in the Netherlands, described as ?wicked? the policy of New Delhi to prompt ?discredited? organisations like the Naga National Council (NNC) and the NSCN (Khaplang) to disturb the peace process.

 He claimed that while the NNC was being armed by India, NSCN (K) was being actively ?encouraged and facilitated? to disturb the NSCN (I-M)?s efforts at a time when a qualitative breakthrough in the peace negotiations seemed likely. ?This is not a sign of wisdom,? Muivah said.

 The Naga leader warned: ?Unless these issues are directly and officially clarified to us by the Government of India, we will consider ourselves free of our commitment to ceasefire and the peace negotiations.?

 ?The honour we extended to the Prime Minister?s invitation by accepting to come to India is being undermined. How then can we come to India? The sincerity of the Prime Minister?s invitation and his wisdom itself have come under doubt,? Muivah said.

 The NSCN (I-M) leader claimed the NNC and NSCN (K) were being ?used by the Indian intelligence agencies?. India, Muivah said, ought to ask itself: ?Against whom are these groups being used? Is it really against us or against the peace process and the solution??

 Was India then really letting the big fish get away by chasing the small fry? It would seem so from what Muivah has to say about what he calls the handiwork of Indian intelligence and security agencies.

 ?This time it is clear that those people who accepted the Shillong Accord in 1975 (read the NNC) are procuring brand new self-loading rifles made in Indian ordnance factories. Where are they getting these weapons? Who gave them the money to buy these weapons? And why is India actively encouraging the emergence of another armed group in Nagaland? Can New Delhi remain silent claiming that it does not know what is happening?? Muivah asked.

 ?How is that Khaplang?s men are being escorted to Delhi to hold press conferences threatening both India and the NSCN (I-M)? How can they cross the border from Myanmar to Nagaland and then be flown from Guwahati to New Delhi? Who is behind this? Can the Government of India still pretend to be innocent?? he fumed.

 ?Such double standards do not serve India?s pursuit of peace in the Naga areas in any way,? Muivah claimed. He said this would damage the image of India and put a question mark on the earnestness of the peace process.

 Displaying obvious hurt at what he considers breach of trust, Muivah said: ?Sorry, we cannot accept such policies even as tactics. Talking to us and encouraging others to disrupt the peace process is not right. We gave our commitment to come to India and we meant business. Even the Naga people were happy at this development. Then why is this commitment being undermined? The government of India is expected to be above such mean policies if it really wants a solution to the long-standing issue.?

 Muivah claimed ?using those people who were already on the Indian side? to meddle in the peace process ?has created doubts in the minds of the Naga people?. He said: ?We do not think such a policy is wise. This hurts us. The lack of good intention on the part of India has been revealed to us. How can India be trusted? The Nagas are not toys to be played with.?

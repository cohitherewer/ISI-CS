 Cry to reopen close-shave Indian?s case

 AMIT ROY

 London, Oct. 15: An Indian who was very nearly executed for the double murder of a father and son in Florida is almost certainly innocent, the BBC said last night in London following one of the most thorough investigative programmes it has done.

 It looked into the case of 65-year-old Krishna Maharaj, an Indian who came to Britain from Trinidad in 1960, became a millionaire by importing bananas, developed a Rolls Royce lifestyle, turned into a familiar figure on the racecourse and then started spending the winters in the warm sunshine of Florida with wife Marita.

 Over 300 British politicians, led by a former attorney-general, are now pressing the US government to order a retrial and urging Prime Minister Tony Blair to take up the plight of Maharaj, who is a British national.

 In 1987, Maharaj was sentenced to death by a Florida court for shooting dead Jamaicans Derrick Moo Young and his son, Duane, in a Miami hotel room ?between 11 am and noon on 16 October, 1986?. It was claimed Maharaj had gone armed to the hotel to reclaim money the senior Young had defrauded from his family in Trinidad and that, in the course of an argument, he shot dead the father before turning the gun on the son.

 Two years ago, after spending over 15 years on death row, Maharaj?s sentence was commuted to 50 years in jail because of ?judicial impropriety? in his original trial. This is a polite way of describing how the original judge in the case was led off in handcuffs after being found guilty of taking bribes in another case.

 Florida hit the headlines four years ago after the polling controversy over how George W. Bush was declared the winner against his Democratic rival, Al Gore. The BBC programme revealed such corruption and incompetence in Florida that even Bihar would come out looking rosy against it. 

 The investigation by reporter Tim Samuels revealed that five witnesses, who could testify that Maharaj was 30 miles away in Fort Lauderdale at the time of the murders, as the defendant had claimed, were not asked to give evidence.

 Worse, the main prosecution witness, Jamaican Tino Geddes, who was earlier going to testify in Maharaj?s favour, changed his story after prosecutors helped him to get off unrelated criminal charges he was himself facing.

 ?If the jury had really got the story about how Tino was getting favours from the government it would have made them look very differently at Tino,? said Maharaj?s Louisiana-based British defence lawyer Clive Stafford Smith. ?I?ve never been more certain that someone is innocent,? he said. ?It?s a total scandal and miscarriage of justice.?

 President Bush?s brother, Jeb, who is the Florida governor, had told the BBC some years ago he would re-examine Maharaj?s case but last night?s film on the BBC flagship programme Newsnight said he had done nothing so far.

 Sir Nicholas Lyell, QC, who was the attorney-general from 1992-97, appeared convinced that the Americans have imprisoned the wrong man.

 He said: ?There are real reasons for thinking that he may have been framed, that crucial evidence about the principal prosecution witness may not have been disclosed, indeed was not disclosed, that he was inadequately represented, that the case was handled by a judge who in the middle of the case was arrested and subsequently disbarred. And that there are real reasons for all those reasons to think that this is a grave miscarriage of justice, which one would hope can be put right.?

 Maharaj is now confined to a 6ft x 9ft prison cell at the Union Correctional Institute in Florida. He is allowed out only for showers ? three times a week ? legal and family visits, and to see a doctor. He said on the BBC that he had gone ?from living like a prince to living like an animal?. He pleaded with the British government not to let him die in prison.

 The BBC more or less pointed the finger of suspicion at another Indian of Trinidadian origin, Adam Hosein. He has never been questioned by the police, though one of his former employees told the BBC that he thought Hosein was implicated in the killings.

 The former employee, George Abchal, claimed that on the day of the murders Hosein had said he was going to the hotel where the killings occurred. Abchal claimed that a gun and silencer were missing from Hosein?s drawer and that night he told Abchal that he had acquired $ 200,000 and ?eliminated? a few people.

 The way the BBC puts it to get its allegation past its lawyers, in case Hosein is tempted to sue, is to say that Maharajs defence lawyers think Hosein ?has some serious questions to answer in this case?.

 After much searching, when the BBC tracked down the elusive Hosein in Trinidad, he swore at the reporter Tim Samuels and warned him to leave him alone. This is a warning Samuels should not dismiss lightly.

 The Hosein family occupies a notorious niche in British criminal history, as Samuels disclosed. In order to get to Adam Hosein, Samuels managed to contact his brother, Nizaamodeen, who was also abusive and unhelpful.

 Nizaamodeen and another brother, Arthur, were convicted in Britain in 1970 and served long prison terms for abducting and murdering Muriel McKay, the wife of a wealthy newspaper paper executive, for a large ransom. This was the first kidnap case of its kind in Britain.

 It has long been assumed that Nizaamodeen and Arthur Hosein killed Mrs McKay, chopped up her body and fed her to the pigs on a Hertfordshire farm where they had taken their victim. It is not known where Arthur is but Nizaamodeen has returned to Trinidad.

 Riot amnesia list lengthens 

 CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA

 Mumbai, Nov. 19: Following in the footsteps of his brother Nasibullah, Nafitullah, Zahira Sheikh?s elder brother, turned hostile in the Best Bakery case today.

 Nafitullah disowned his police statement and said he was not in a position to identify any accused in the carnage at the bakery that killed 14 people because there was too much smoke.

 He added he did not know how his sister Sabira, who was burned alive in the bakery, had died. He said he saw her being taken inside a room and the door being shut.

 Nafitullah also said that he did not know the whereabouts of his uncle, Quasar, who was presumed to have been burnt alive during the incident.

 He slammed activist Teesta Setalvad, saying she and her colleague Raees Khan had threatened him and his family. He said she had forcibly brought them to Mumbai. 

 But he admitted Setalvad had paid the bills at Asha Parekh Hospital in Bandra, in Mumbai, when his daughter was born. The child was born of the woman he has been living with since he and his first wife Yasmin were estranged. Yasmin has deposed as witness for the prosecution, charging that Zahira has taken money for her latest turnaround.

 Nafitullah almost echoed everything his younger brother Nasibullah had told the court yesterday.

 Nasibullah, 17, had said he was injured in the head and a leg during the carnage in the Vadodara bakery, but told the special court that he did not remember how he was hurt. 

 Though the four previous witnesses have identified several of the accused by name and appearance, Nasibullah had said he would not be able to recognise any person who was part of the mob behind the carnage that started on March 1, 2002 and went on till the next day.

 He had said the rioters came at 9 pm on March 1 and he, his mother, Nafitullah, sisters Zahira and Saira, and some bakery workers, fled to the terrace of the bakery and tried to protect themselves with the mattresses lying there.

 But he was hit by something from behind and fell unconscious, Nasibullah had said. He regained consciousness two days later at a hospital and came to know of the incident from a newspaper, he had said. 

 He had also said he asked about his leg injury in the hospital and was told that the rioters had set fire to the bakery. ?There was so much smoke and darkness. How could I see anyone?s face?? he had asked.

 The prosecution wanted to declare him ?hostile?, but judge Abhay Thipse had allowed public prosecutor Manjula Rao to ?cross-examine? the witness. Nasibullah could not identify Sanjay Thakkar, one of the accused, whom other witnesses had identified and whom he had mentioned in his statement to the police. 

 The case received another jolt when Nasibullah had told the court that Yasmin was not present during the incident.

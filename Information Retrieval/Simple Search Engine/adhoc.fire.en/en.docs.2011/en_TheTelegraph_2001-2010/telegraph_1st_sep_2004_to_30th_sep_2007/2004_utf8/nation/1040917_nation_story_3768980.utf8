 SC push to rape victim version

 R. VENKATARAMAN

 New Delhi, Sept. 16: The Supreme Court today reiterated that delay in filing a police complaint in rape cases should not lead to acquittal of the accused and that the victim?s evidence carried more weight in such cases.

 A division bench of Justices Arijit Pasayat and C.K. Thakker, in a judgement delivered on September 8 and made available today, said delay in complaining to the police in rape cases was because of ?society?s attitude towards such women?.

 ?The reluctance (of a rape victim) to go to the police is because of society?s attitude towards such women. It casts doubt and shame upon her rather than comfort and sympathy with her,? it said.

 ?Therefore, the delay in lodging complaint in such cases does not necessarily indicate that her version is false,? Justice Pasayat said for the bench while upholding the sentencing of a rape accused to six years? rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs 1,000.

 The judge gave more weight to the victim?s evidence holding her ?in higher pedestal? than any evidence in any other criminal case and said that courts throughout the country ?should ordinarily have no hesitation in accepting her evidence?.

 ?Courts are entitled to base a conviction on her (rape victim?s) evidence unless the same is shown to be infirm and not trustworthy,? Justice Pasayat held in the judgement, squarely putting the onus of disproving the victim?s statement on the accused rather than placing the onus or burden of proof on the victim.

 Today?s judgment comes on a case relating to Tripura, where a 20-year-old married woman was raped in 1989. The trial court found the accused guilty and sentenced him to six years? rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs 1,000. On appeal, the high court confirmed the sentence.

 The Supreme Court held that ?minor discrepancies in the testimony of the victim and other witnesses? were of no consequence and the accused could not escape conviction by ?highlighting? the minor discrepancies.

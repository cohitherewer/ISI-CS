 New Delhi, Sept. 29: Manmohan Singh today said there is a consensus that all public functionaries, including the Prime Minister, should be brought under the Lokpal and promised to introduce the bill soon.

 The Lokpal bill, which envisages a judicial institution to probe allegations of corruption against public servants, is to be tabled in Parliament for the ninth time.

 In Dehra Dun for the All-India Conference of Lokayuktas and Uplokayuktas, Singh said: ?The need for Lokpal is more urgent at present than ever before.? The bill has been in the pipeline for over three decades.

 ?The current consensus is by and large in favour of a multi-member institution with quasi-judicial powers. There is also a broad agreement that public functionaries directly and indirectly elected by and responsible to the public, such as members of Parliament and ministers, including the Prime Minister, should be brought within the purview of the Lokpal legislation,? Singh added.

 Earlier, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam had said the office of the President should also come under the Lokpal.

 The bill provides for setting up the office of Lokpal with a chairperson and two members, appointed for a fixed term of three years by the President. 

 The appointments are to be made on the recommendation of a committee headed by the Vice-President and including the Prime Minister, the Lok Sabha Speaker, leader of the House other than that in which the Prime Minister is a member and the leaders of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha.

 Public servants come under the Lokpal?s purview but constitutional offices, including Supreme Court judges, the Election Commission, UPSC, and CAG, have been kept out.

 According to the bill, the Lokpal will inquire into complaints that a public functionary has committed an offence punishable under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988.

 To ensure that it can act independently, the Lokpal chairperson and members shall not be removed from office except by an order of the President for proved misbehaviour or incapacity after an inquiry by a committee comprising the Chief Justice of India and two Supreme Court judges next to the chief justice in seniority.

 The bill also vests the Lokpal with the powers of the civil court in summoning and enforcing the attendance of any person and examining them on oath. 

 The Lokpal shall consist of a chairperson who is or has been a chief justice or a judge of the Supreme Court and two members who are or have been the judges of the Supreme Court or chief justices of high courts.

 A bill to create the Lokpal was first introduced in the fourth Lok Sabha and passed by it in 1969. However, before the Rajya Sabha could endorse the bill, the Lok Sabha was dissolved. The last time the bill was introduced was in 2001, by the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government.

 ?However, this time, the Prime Minister himself has declared that there is a ?broad political consensus? which means there would not be any problem for the introduction and passage of the bill in Parliament,? a government draftsman said.

 Singh told the conference: ?We shall take effective action in this regard without any further loss of time.?

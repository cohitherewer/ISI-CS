 Power sop for Andhra poor

 Hyderabad: The Andhra Pradesh government 

 has decided to provide from Dussehra a subsidy of Rs 10 

 in the power bill of 13.92 lakh domestic users who consume 

 Rs 25 worth of electricity per month, reports our special 

 correspondent.

 ?Instead of carving out a new category for providing 15 units of free power to the poor, we chose to give a blanket subsidy of Rs 10 for such consumers,? chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy said on Friday, undaunted by the controversy over the announcement of free power to farmers.

 The latest sop by the Congress government to the poorest of the poor domestic users of giving subsidy comes in the wake of the Planning Commission?s diktat that state governments should not give any free lunches. The move is also aimed at curbing electricity theft.

 Power theft had spiralled during the kharif season, reaching an astounding four lakh illegal farm connections. The government?s decision to do away with illegal connections had driven a majority of farmers to cling to live power lines.

 The Congress government had started reconciling to the inability of providing totally free power to farmers and poor domestic users as the party had promised during the election campaign.

 Immigrants in Greek net

 Komotini (AFP): Greek border guards have

 hidden between mattresses in a truck that had crossed the

 They had earlier crossed the Evros river, a traditional crossing point for illegal immigrants trying to reach the European Union.

 The driver of the truck, going from Istanbul to the Greek capital Athens, had charged his illegal passengers $400 each for the journey, police said.

 Hizb cloud on two

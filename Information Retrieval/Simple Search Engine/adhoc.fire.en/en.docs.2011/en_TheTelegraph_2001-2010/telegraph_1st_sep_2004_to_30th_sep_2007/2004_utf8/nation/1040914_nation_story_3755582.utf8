 Prickly pitch for talks

 PRANAY SHARMA 

 New Delhi, Sept. 13: Bangladeshi foreign minister Morshed Khan?s outburst against India notwithstanding, a team left for Dhaka today for talks on water-sharing and security, particularly the presence of Northeast insurgent camps on Bangladeshi soil. 

 The joint committee of experts on rivers will start two-day deliberations tomorrow on how water of the Teesta can be harnessed and shared by the two sides. Next up is a meeting between the two home secretaries, beginning September 16, in which both sides will get an opportunity to share their security concerns. 

 South Block wants to send out the signal that though disappointed, Delhi wants to engage with Dhaka. The decision to go ahead with the scheduled talks is also an attempt to quash speculation that Delhi might try to scuttle the Saarc summit scheduled early next year in Bangladesh. 

 Khan, while addressing a group of young journalists in Dhaka, stung India, suggesting that it should not feel at an advantageous position vis-a-vis Bangladesh and argued that if Delhi blames Dhaka for everything (read camps of northeastern insurgents), it was bound to have a negative impact on bilateral relations. 

 ?If Bangladesh is land-locked, then India should keep in mind that seven of its northeastern states are also Bangladesh-locked,? he is said to have told the reporters. 

 But his strongest words were reserved for India?s decision to call up Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina after attacks on her rally last month left several people dead. Dhaka wanted to make it clear that Delhi should not try to bypass the government and talk about law and order in the country with the Opposition. 

 Taken aback at the outburst in the presence of Indian high commissioner Veena Sikri and other foreign diplomats, the Centre summoned Sikri?s Bangladeshi counterpart, Hemayetuddin, and lodged its protest. Delhi told him that India considered Bangladesh a close friend and valued partner and Khan?s remarks could have an adverse impact on ties. 

 But Khan justified his ?sudden outbursts?, saying young journalists should know the ground reality. Though miffed, India has decided to talk with Bangladesh to express its concern and disappointment rather than breaking off contact. 

 It is not clear what led the Bangladeshi foreign minister to come out with the harsh remarks, but some feel India?s reaction to the attacks on Hasina?s rally was the trigger.

 Debt burns up farmer amp; family

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 Lucknow, Sept. 17: Sriram Bind, 42, would mumble to himself how much land he owned and the money he owed before something in him snapped on Tuesday night.

 ?Two bighas of land and a Rs 40,000 loan? was his refrain as he would sit alone under the trees in Barbata village in eastern Uttar Pradesh?s Mirzapur district.

 Moneylenders knocking at Sriram?s door for repayment of the loans he had taken were driving him to depression. Matters took a turn for the worse on the evening of September 9 when one creditor came up, abused him and took away a pump set he had bought to irrigate his land better.

 Puffing a bidi on Tuesday night, Sriram resolved to put himself and his family members out of their misery. With his wife and three children fast asleep, he tossed his half-smoked bidi on a corner of his thatched house.

 Villagers noticed smoke billowing out of his house, but thought nothing of it mistaking it for smoke from his kitchen. But the fire soon engulfed Sriram?s house, killing wife Nanka, 30, children Shamband, 5, Bannu, 3, a two-month-old son and himself.

 District officers were informed the next morning when villagers spotted four burned bodies in a room. The baby?s body had been reduced to ashes, police officers said.

 Sriram was no beggar, but had more dependents than his four bighas of land allowed him to support. He had five children from his first wife Kabutara who live elsewhere and had sold off two bighas to raise money for their upkeep. He struggled to remain afloat with the remaining two bighas. He borrowed Rs 20,000 from Rashid Ali and another Rs 20,000 from two others. ?Each time he sought to get a good crop, bad luck defeated his effort,? Suman Rai, a youth, said.

 Mirzapur district magistrate Subharao Singh says: ?Sriram got caught up in the loan trap and a painful pecuniary condition which apparently drove him to commit suicide.? 

 The suicide of indebted farmers has been on the rise in the state. Sources said most of these suicides occurred in the east, particularly districts like Banda and Mirzapur.

 Last week, Maikulal hanged himself from his mango orchard in Banda; Jhatku Nishad, another farmer in the same district, jumped into the Ken river. In July, Jhatku?s son, Munna, 30, also committed suicide after failing to repay a Rs 3,000 loan. In Agra district, Ramdeo Mahato swallowed poison after being declared an absconder on failing to repay his Rs 1.75 lakh loan.

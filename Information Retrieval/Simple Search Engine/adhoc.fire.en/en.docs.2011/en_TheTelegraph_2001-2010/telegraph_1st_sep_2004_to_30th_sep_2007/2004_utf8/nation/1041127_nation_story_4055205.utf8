 BJP seeks Kanchi trial outside TN

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Ranchi, Nov. 26: BJP chief L.K. Advani today demanded at a news conference after the conclusion of the party?s national executive that all cases against the Kanchi seer be tried outside Tamil Nadu so that justice is delivered.

 ?I know it is for the judiciary to decide, but the way things have gone and the way the seer was treated, the people and the country are concerned. So it is appropriate to transfer the cases outside Tamil Nadu,? Advani said.

 He said the Supreme Court had set a precedent for transferring cases to courts outside the state where the incident had taken place, pointing to the Best Bakery and Bilkis gangrape cases relating to the post-Godhra carnage in early 2002. 

 The apex court has ordered the bakery case to be heard in a Maharashtra court.

 BJP sources said the party would not move court seeking a transfer of the seer?s cases, adding that it was up to the party concerned to do so.

 Advani?s remarks came days after the VHP made a similar demand. The VHP said Jayendra Saraswati?s case should be heard in Gujarat as it was the only state where Hindus can expect ?justice?.

 The BJP chief cited the party?s support for the Kanchi seer as an example of its ?courage of conviction?.

 He denied the seer?s arrest or the Ayodhya temple tangle would create fissures in the National Democratic Alliance. Citing the example of the Janata Dal (United), Advani said its misgivings about the BJP?s temple stand had been set at rest during a meeting.

 But Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who kept a low profile during the national executive, tried to neutralise the Hindutva effect, saying it will not be an election issue.

 - State leaders play second fiddle to Sonia; rebel candidates decry Thackeray?s ?dictatorial ways?

 Sonia: star campaigner

 Pune, Oct. 10: Pramod Mahajan of the BJP saw to it that the Maharashtra election was his solo show. He ensured which leaders from Delhi and other places would be used and to what extent. 

 While .K. Advani and Sushma Swaraj were deployed for public gatherings, Arun Jaitley was confined to ?meet-the-press? events and lawyers? meetings.

 ?Mahajan is keen to see if we win Maharashtra, he should get full credit, and if we lose, he will willingly take responsibility,? said a confidant. Having learnt a lesson or two from his carpet-bombing blitzkrieg and hi-tech splurges in the Lok Sabha polls, the BJP?s ?ace strategist? kept the campaign as low profile as he could.

 It is a different kettle of fish for the Congress. Its state leaders, including chief minister Sushil Kumar Shinde and his predecessor Vilasrao Deshmukh, chose to play second fiddle to Sonia Gandhi and her team. The only heavyweight state campaigner the Congress alliance had was Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar.

 However, with the Congress? Lok Sabha victory and Sonia?s abdication of prime ministership, even Pawar was relegated to second place in the pantheon of campaigners. If A.B. Vajpayee?s persona dominated the Lok Sabha polls, almost five months later, Sonia occupied the place in Maharashtra.

 ?The foreigner issue is over,? admitted Rajabhau Limaye, an NCP leader from Ratnagiri. ?There is a wave in the Congress-NCP alliance?s favour and Sonia?s contribution to the wave is by no means small,? he claimed.

 Sonia watchers remarked on how women turned up in huge numbers to hear her. ?Somewhere she said political empowerment has no meaning unless women become socially empowered. But she also explained that social empowerment will come only if women participate in the political process. So she urged them to vote. That made a huge impact on women. In Maharashtra, generally we believe women vote in larger numbers than men,? said Uttam Bhumkar, the Pune unit secretary.

 Across the state, Congress offices were replete with Sonia lore. Samples: as her chopper touched Gadchiroli in Vidarbha, some looked up, hands folded in a ?namaste? while others prostrated themselves. 

 While the Congress has allowed her presence and speeches to make political statements on its behalf without allowing its campaign to become ?Sonia-centric?, every speaker harped on her ?sacrifice?. ?We have used her example to persuade some of our rebel candidates to withdraw. It worked in some cases,? claimed the Pune Congress chief.

 For Bajrang Patel, a member of the Kameri village panchayat in western Maharashtra?s Shirala Assembly seat, Sonia and ?sacrifice? are inseparable. ?She is an example to all of us. She pardoned one of those who was accused of killing her husband. Then she had an alliance with the very parties that were alleged to have some role in the assassination. After all, she comes from a family which has made some of the greatest sacrifices for this country,? he said.

 Evidently, the BJP-Sena combine did not give up its penchant to aim barbs at Sonia. While nothing was attributed to the big leaders so far, the constituency-level ones said things containing innuendoes on Sonia and Pawar.

 ?The sort of sick jokes which put off people,? remarked P.A. Kamble, a member of the Peasants and Workers Party in Alibagh.

 If Sonia is the Congress? ?public face?, the general secretaries in charge of Maharashtra, Margaret Alva and Digvijay Singh were the backroom strategists who reportedly worked overtime to bring the factions together and quell rebellion to an extent.

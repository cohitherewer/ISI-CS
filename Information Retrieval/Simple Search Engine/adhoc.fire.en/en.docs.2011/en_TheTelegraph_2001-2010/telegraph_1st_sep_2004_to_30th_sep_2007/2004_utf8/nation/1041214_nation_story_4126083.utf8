 Court turns down godman plea

New Delhi: A court on Monday dismissed Chandraswami?s application 

seeking permission to travel abroad, reports our correspondent.

 The CBI claimed to have ?collected evidence? of the self-styled godman?s role in the assassination of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.

 Chandraswami, who is also facing Fera violation charges, had sought permission from the court to go abroad for two months. However, both the Enforcement Directorate, which has charged him, and the CBI opposed the plea. Additional chief metropolitan magistrate Ravinder Dudeja turned down the application today.

 ?Lots of evidence have been collected against the suspect,? CBI counsel Mohammed Shakeel told Dudeja.

 The counsel, who was present along with chief investigating officer B.N. Mishra of the Multi-Disciplinary Monitoring Agency which is probing the assassination case, said the agency wanted to show the evidence to the court.

 When Mishra requested the court to see the documents in-camera to ensure confidentiality, Dudeja directed him to send them inside the chamber.

 Pathaks in a pickle again

 AMIT ROY

 London, Oct. 5: The dispute that has torn apart the Pathaks, a wealthy Indian business family in Britain, was back in the high court in London today in the most extraordinary circumstances, six months after both sides in the ?Spice War? apparently reached an out-of-court settlement.

 The battle has raged ever since two married sisters accused their brother, Kirit Pathak ? 51-year-old boss of the ?75-million Patak ethnic pickle and food empire ? along with his wife Meena of cheating them out of 1,250 shares each.

 Chitralekha Mehta, 56, and Anila Shastri, 52, say the shares had been left to them by their late father, Laxmishankar, who founded the business. 

 The shares were given to their mother for safekeeping but she passed on them on to her son, the sisters allege.

 The mother, 77-year-old Shantagaury Pathak, who lives with Kirit, at his home in Bolton ? the family has a parrot which squawks in Gujarati ? has sided with her son and accused her daughters of being greedy and gold diggers.

 Hinduism, too, got a bad press when it was suggested by Kirit?s side that in Hindu culture, it was normal only for the sons to inherit their father?s business.

 A further controversial aspect of the case, which has shown Indian families in the worst possible light, is that the sisters have legal aid, which means the state pays for their lawyers. That bill to date has come to an estimated ?1.5 million.

 Six months ago, their brother, worried about the drain on his resources and also the effect the quarrel was having on his mother?s health, decided to settle out of court. But the deal which both sides thought had been reached has now come unstuck, it was revealed when the rival lawyers had an ill-tempered and singularly un-English exchange in court today.

 John McDonnell, QC, counsel for the sisters, accused their brother of reneging on the agreement.

 The judge, Justice Evans-Lombe, after intervening several times during angry exchanges between McDonnell and Kirit Pathak?s counsel, David Oliver, QC, adjourned the case for a decision to be made on whether the trial of the lawsuit should continue as though there had been no settlement.

 The judge was told that a resumed hearing could not take place until next June and would last up to a further five weeks on top of the six weeks it had taken before the April settlement.

 He refused to order a resumed hearing until he had been told whether the sisters would pursue their alternative claim that their brother had reneged on the settlement.

 Outside court, Anila Shastri, said: ?Nobody likes to go back to court for something that should have been concluded. It is just dragging on, which is the usual tactic of my brother. I wish him well and I hope he will see some sense and do what is justifiably right for his sisters.?

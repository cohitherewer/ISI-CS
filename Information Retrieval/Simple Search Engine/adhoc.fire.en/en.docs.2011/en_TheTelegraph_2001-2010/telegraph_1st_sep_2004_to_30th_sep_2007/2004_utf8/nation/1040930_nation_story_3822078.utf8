 Devdas lends BJP a shoulder

 CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA

 Aishwarya in a still from Devdas

 Mumbai, Sept. 29: Devdas 

 and Paro?s love life has been put on hold.

 Paro: ?Issssh!?

 Devdas: ?Paro!?

 Paro: ?Devdas, when are you going to marry me??

 Devdas: ?As soon as I get a job.?

 The job is difficult, because they live under the Congress-NCP dispensation. Perhaps that?s why they have turned middle-class; and the BJP campaign has nose-dived even further ? it has become downmarket.

 The party has put behind the snazzy, high-tech India Shining campaign as a bad dream and is overflowing with love for the masses. It has pinned its hopes not on a catchphrase, but on something more solid for the Maharashtra elections: the common man (and woman). 

 The ad campaign for the October 13 elections, which goes on air on October 1, features India?s best-loved star-crossed lovers as droll representatives of the educated middle-class talking about the problems at the grassroots level.

 Paro is a sharp-tongued, dominating Marathi woman who has Devdas in her thrall and the issues are not IT, nuclear power, urban development and India-Pakistan, but load-shedding, unemployment and drought.

 In one of three 40-second black-and-white audio visuals, Paro informs Devdas that he has not much chance in getting a job, because there are 60 lakh unemployed in the state. The only way out is to elect the BJP-Shiv Sena alliance back into power, Devdas says, and rushes to gather her into his arms. 

 ?No,? says Paro in English. ?First let us elect the alliance, then everything else.? It is the punchline in all the three AVs.

 Not the themes alone. The party seems to have also deliberately chosen to keep the media campaign low-profile after burning its fingers from India?s ?shine?.

 There was no leader of stature ? not even Gopinath Munde, not to mention Pramod Mahajan, whose baby the India Shining campaign was ? present at the launch of the campaign today. And no ad agency was involved in the production ? it was an in-house effort, with some external help. The ad agency behind the India Shining campaign was Grey Worldwide. 

 Shiv Sena will come out with its own campaign shortly.

 The BJP AVs are in keeping with the joint manifesto that the party released yesterday with the Sena. The manifesto showered jawans, kisans and kamgars with sops. The alliance promised free power to farmers, waiver of loans and a Re 1 price increase for milk producers. 

 It pledged that mill owners yet to clear the dues of displaced workers would be made to do so. A special economic package would be provided for displaced workers and priority in employment given to children of mill workers in businesses developed at mill sites. Help has also been promised to families and children of soldiers killed in action.

 The manifesto also says 40 lakh hutment dwellers will be given pucca houses and every rural household will be given a toilet.

 Not a mention of IT!

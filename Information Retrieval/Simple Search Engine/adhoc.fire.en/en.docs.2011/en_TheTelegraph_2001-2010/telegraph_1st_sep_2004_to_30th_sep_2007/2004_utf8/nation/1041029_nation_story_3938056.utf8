 Krishna rues IT highway potholes

 B.R. SRIKANTH

 S.M. Krishna

 Bangalore, Oct. 28: Former chief minister S.M. Krishna today broke a five-month silence to demand better facilities in the Karnataka capital.

 Krishna said the Congress-led coalition ought to be worried at the prospect of leading software companies switching to China because of lack of political support and adequate infrastructure. He said he would discuss pothole-free roads and smooth-flowing traffic when he meets chief minister Dharam Singh next month.

 ?I have heard these complaints for some time. As one who represents Bangalore, I will take up the issue of infrastructure with the chief minister. People in Bangalore and the rest of Karnataka deserve? motorable roads,? he said.

 Krishna said he was pro-information technology during his tenure as chief minister and wanted to ensure that infotech improved the quality of life in remote corners of Karnataka.

 ?I wanted the IT companies to set up units in all parts of Karnataka and the taxes on their operations could support development activities. Our government took infotech to rural areas through Bhoomi (computerisation of land records) and other programmes.?

 He said Rahul Gandhi had spent a few days here last week to learn about the role of IT and space in rural development. ?It was a private visit, so I don?t know if he called on the chief minister or not,? Krishna said in a reference to speculation that the Amethi MP had ignored Singh during his visit.

 The former chief minister said he would not side with any coalition faction but will support its programmes.

 ?It is the prerogative of the chief minister to expand his cabinet. If somebody doubts the credentials of our legislators, they should seek an inquiry by (the) Lok Ayukta or raise the issue?on the floor of the? Assembly,? he said, referring to reports that the Janata Dal (Secular)?s H.D. Deve Gowda opposed the induction of some Congress MLAs saying they were ?tainted?.

 Yechury meet to calm Sonia

 Sonia: Frustrated

 New Delhi, Sept. 13: After a string of attacks on the United Progressive Alliance government, the CPM is trying to clear the air with ally Congress. 

 Politburo member Sitaram Yechury met alliance chairperson and Congress president Sonia Gandhi yesterday and spoke to her for an hour. He is believed to have asked whether she was annoyed with the Left. Signalling her frustration, Sonia apparently threw back a question ? could she afford to be annoyed with the Left? 

 The meeting came amid loud protests from the Left camp against the policies of the government. Last Friday, even CPM veteran Jyoti Basu, who is usually patient with the Congress, said he was unhappy with the government and would meet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to discuss the issues bothering the Left. 

 Yechury also met Singh today, with former Prime Minister V.P. Singh in tow, but discussions were restricted to the problems of workers in Delhi. Later, he confirmed that Basu would meet Singh and Sonia on Friday. 

 ?He is coming to Delhi for his party?s politburo meeting. He will arrive in Delhi on the 16th and will leave on the 18th,? said Yechury. 

 Basu will not only raise the contentious issues but, like Yechury, is expected to reiterate that the Left?s opposition to the government?s decisions does not signal a threat to the Manmohan Singh dispensation. 

 The Congress believes it has been more than patient with the Left and has given its key allies its due. But the Left ? at least for public consumption ? is scowling more than smiling. 

 Since Union finance minister P. Chidambaram announced the budget, the Left has kept up the heat on the government, which it supports from outside. It began with the controversy over the cap on foreign investment in several sectors and was followed by the row on privatisation of airports and the provident fund interest rate. 

 Recently another couple of sticking points have surfaced. The latest on the Left?s crib list is the Electricity Act, 2003, and the inclusion of World Bank officials in the Planning Commission advisory committees. 

 ?We are unhappy about the government?s decision. Never before have foreign officials been included in the Planning Commission,? said Yechury. 

 CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan has met Singh and urged him to review the electricity act, which calls for private participation in the sector. The Left seems to be playing the same role as it did during the United Front?s 1996-98 tenure ? of allies as well as the Opposition. 

 Yechury?s meeting with Sonia makes it clear that the Left will continue its criticism but will not translate it into political action, that is threaten the survival of the government.

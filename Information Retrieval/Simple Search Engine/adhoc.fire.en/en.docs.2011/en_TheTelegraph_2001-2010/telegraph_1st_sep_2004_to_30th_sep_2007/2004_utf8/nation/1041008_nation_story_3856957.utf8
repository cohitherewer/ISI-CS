 Poll punch to minority panel plan

 New Delhi, Oct. 7 (PTI): The Election Commission today rejected the constitution of a panel to look into reservation for minorities on the ground that it seems aimed at ?influencing some sections of the electorate?. 

 The Centre?s intention to set up a national commission for the welfare of socially and economically backward sections among religious and linguistic minorities ?at this juncture when elections are being held in two states? gives the impression of being aimed at influencing some sections of the electorate?, the poll panel wrote to the cabinet secretary. 

 ?The commission is emphatically of the view that the decision on the constitution of the commission should also have been deferred till the date of poll, October 13,? it added. 

 The poll panel said the government had sought its views on changing the policy on subsidy for Haj travel and decided to defer it. Though the new commission had the ?same potential for influencing a section of the voters? the matter was not referred to the Election Commission for its views?. 

 ?The commission hopes that such lapses would be avoided in future,? the panel said. 

 The Opposition BJP, which had approached the poll panel against the government?s move, took the mileage out of the Maharashtra polls, saying it exposed the Centre?s ?communal and divisive face?. 

 The Congress has said it will respect the poll panel?s decision.

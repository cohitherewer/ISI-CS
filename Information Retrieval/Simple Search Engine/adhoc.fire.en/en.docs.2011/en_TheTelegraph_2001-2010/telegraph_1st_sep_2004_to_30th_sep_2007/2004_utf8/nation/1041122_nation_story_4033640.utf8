 Mulayam salvo at Cong

 Jhansi, Nov. 21 (PTI): Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav today charged the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government at the Centre with trying to ?weaken and destabilise? his government by adopting a ?discriminatory attitude?.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is ?an honest man? the Samajwadi Party chief said. However, the Congress leadership, which controls him, is targeting the Samajwadi Party and its government in the state, he said at a convention of party workers. ?Statements made by Congress leaders prove that it wants to weaken and destabilise our government.?

 he said adding it (congress) will not succeed in its efforts.

 He also appealed to the ?socialist? and ?gandhian? forces in the nda to help establish a third progressive political force in the country.

 ?This will not be possible until the socialist and gandhian forces in the nda come together with the help of the left and form an anti-congress and anti-bjp platform,? yadav said.

 He also lashed out at the bjp for trying to ?rake up emotive issues? and said that the ?deviation from the real issues has heralded doom for the saffron party?.

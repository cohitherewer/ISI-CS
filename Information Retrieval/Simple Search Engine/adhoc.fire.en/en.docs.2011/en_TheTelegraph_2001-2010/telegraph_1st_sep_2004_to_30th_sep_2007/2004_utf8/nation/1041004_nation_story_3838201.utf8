 Protest over tribal meet

 New Delhi, Oct. 3: Vanvasis and nagarvasis owing allegiance to the Sangh parivar will meet between October 6 and 10 to discuss, among other things, the problems the country?s eight crore tribals face, reports our special correspondent.

 The gathering in the city has Christian and Muslim leaders crying foul for they see this as an attempt by the Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram that is organising the function to segregate people. One Muslim organisation has accused it of being involved in converting Scheduled Tribes to Hinduism.

 The ashram ? an RSS affiliate and one of the largest voluntary organisations working for the social, economic and cultural development of forest dwellers ? is organising it to celebrate its golden jubilee.

 Secularists, Christian and Muslim leaders have attacked the ashram in the past over its rampant reconversion in tribal hamlets in the guise of ?ghar vapsi (homecoming)?.

 But the ashram?s joint secretary-general, Kripa Prasad Singh, says the ashram has been working through its more than 11,500 projects nationwide to bridge the gap between vanvasis and nagarvasis.

 SC date for cricket battle

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 2: The Supreme Court today fixed December 9 to hear a petition of the Board of Control for Cricket in India against a Madras High Court order restraining its newly-elected members from functioning and appointing an administrator in their place.

 A division bench of Justices N. Santosh Hegde and S.B. Sinha fixed the date after hearing senior counsel Fali Nariman for Maharashtra Cricket Association (MCA). The counsel submitted that the association was filing an application seeking interim orders against the BCCI, which had restrained it from voting during the recently-held elections for the body?s office-bearers.

 Union minister Sharad Pawar had lost the election after the MCA nominee was barred from voting. The casting vote of outgoing BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya had sealed the verdict.

 On October 11, the BCCI?s newly-elected office-bearers were restored to their posts when the Supreme Court stayed the high court order on the cricket body?s elections. However, the apex court had restrained Dalmiya from becoming the board?s patron-in-chief.

 Nariman told the court that, ?taking advantage of the pendency of the case before the court?, Dalmiya has assumed charge of the board and was deciding award of new contracts, including telecast rights, without consulting the newly-elected body headed by Ranbir Singh Mahendra.

 The MCA counsel also contended before the apex court that the association feared that even the telecast rights for the February 2005 series between India and Pakistan would be decided ? before the apex court gives its verdict on the BCCI elections ? without consulting the board members. The bench then observed that the BCCI should not decide on awarding any new contract.

 BCCI counsel A.M. Singhvi, however, contended that ?no new contracts have been awarded by the board and that the allegations were without any basis?.

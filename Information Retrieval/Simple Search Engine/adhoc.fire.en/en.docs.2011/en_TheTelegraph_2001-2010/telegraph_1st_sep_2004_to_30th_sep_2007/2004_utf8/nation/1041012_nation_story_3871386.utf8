 Washington to send monitor 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Kenneth Juster

 New Delhi, Oct. 11: The Indo-US high-technology trade pact signed days before Manmohan Singh visited New York last month might come at a political price.

 The US has decided to post a special attach? at its embassy here to deal with export control. It will carry out ?periodic end-use checks on a spot basis? on Indian companies to ensure technology and hardware goes where it is intended.

 US undersecretary for commerce Kenneth Juster said the attach? will be posted later this month and will also coordinate high-technology bilateral trade. He said on-the-spot and periodic end-use checks are carried out the world over and close US allies Britain and Israel also accept the practice.

 But it is not clear how Indian parties, especially some members of the ruling United Progressive Alliance, will react to this.

 Juster said US assistant secretary of state Christina Rocca will come here on October 20 to discuss the implementation of Phase I and prepare the way for the second phase of the ?Next Steps in Strategic Partnership (NSSP)? the two sides have agreed on.

 ?We will be posting someone from the commerce department later this month in India who will be here on a permanent basis. The official will help US companies understand the opportunities in high technology sector in India and also help Indian companies understand US export control systems and requirements so that US technologies that are transferred are used in the manner they are licensed for,? Juster said.

 Agreement on the first phase of the NSSP was wrapped up days before Prime Minister Singh met US President George W. Bush in New York.

 This led to the removal of the Indian Space Research Organisation from the US restrictive list.

 The easing of restrictions also relate to supply of equipment and technology for India?s civilian space and nuclear programmes.

 Once the first phase is over, around 80 per cent of licences that used to be mandatory for Isro entities will no longer be required.

 Nearly 20 to 25 per cent of licences required for Indian organisations will also not be needed. Juster said this sent out a strong signal in both countries about the two governments? desire to increase trade on high technology.

 VIP security for Naga duo

 OUR BUREAU

 Muivah

 Kohima/Dimapur, Dec. 12: The Central Reserve Police Force replaced the Central Industrial Security Force at Dimapur airport as Nagaland put security arrangements befitting top dignitaries in place for the much-hyped homecoming of militant leaders Isak Chishi Swu and Thuingaleng Muivah. 

 Sources said the Assam Rifles had been asked to arrange for a helicopter should the duo wish to visit some interior areas of the state. The paramilitary force will form the outer security ring.

 Swu and Muivah are scheduled to arrive to a rousing reception in Dimapur on Tuesday. The duo is at present in New Delhi, meeting political leaders and mobilising support for the integration of all contiguous Naga-inhabited areas of the Northeast.

 Amid the security arrangements by the state administration, a team from the NSCN (I-M) separately launched a ?mopping-up operation? in and around Dimapur to ?sanitise the town?. 

 The outfit claimed activists in civilian clothes ?seized several lethal weapons? and ?arrested? at least four persons suspected to be ?detrimental to the security of the city?. 

 NSCN (I-M) leader K. Chawang said a ?sergeant-major? of the rival Khaplang group and another senior leader of the same outfit were being detained along with two Meitei militants who had sneaked into Dimapur recently. The NSCN (K) members were identified as Imoingba and Bayiese.

 Chawang said security agencies and NSCN (I-M) units would work in tandem to form a ?two-tier protection ring? during Swu and Muivah?s stay in Nagaland. ?We will be in complete charge of security once they cross over into the zone in which our general headquarters is located.?

 The ground rules of the ceasefire between the Centre and the NSCN (I-M) prohibit security forces from entering the zones marked as designated camps of the militant group.

 Chawang said the mopping-up operation by activists of the outfit?s ?town command? would continue for some more days. 

 Swu and Muivah are expected to address the public within the airport, where a reception has been jointly organised by various organisations, including the Naga Hoho and the Naga Council.

 Naga Hoho secretary H.K. Zhimomi said representatives from all tribes in Nagaland would be present at the airport in traditional attire.

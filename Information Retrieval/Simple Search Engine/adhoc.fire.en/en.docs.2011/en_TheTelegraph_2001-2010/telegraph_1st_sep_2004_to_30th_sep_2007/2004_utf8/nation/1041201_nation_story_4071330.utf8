 Coast pact with Pak

 SUJAN DUTTA

 New Delhi, Nov. 30: India will this week push for the signing of an agreement with Pakistan to open a regular communication link between the Indian Coast Guard and the Pakistan Maritime Security Agency. 

 The agreement will provide for a ?hotline? telephone connection between the two agencies and will be used primarily to identify fishermen of the two countries and secure their release in the event of their transgressing the maritime boundary. 

 The chief of the navy, Admiral Arun Prakash, said here today that the agreement has his full support and the talks were now at the ?culmination stage?. 

 ?The draft has been prepared and delivered and we hope a memorandum of understanding will be signed in the talks this week,? the deputy chief of the navy, Vice-Admiral Sureesh Mehta, said.

 Indian and Pakistani defence and foreign officials are slated to meet on Thursday and Friday to discuss confidence building measures as part of the eight-point composite dialogue process the two are engaged in. 

 A possible agreement between the Coast Guard and the MSA will be another confidence building measure, the navy top brass said. 

 The boundary between India and Pakistan in the Arabian Sea is ?notional?, meaning it is not mapped and this makes it difficult for maritime traffic of either country to identify territorial waters.

 ?We are really quite concerned about our fishermen being caught and landing up in Pakistani jails,? Admiral Prakash said. 

 ?An institutional arrangement will have the full backing of the navy.?

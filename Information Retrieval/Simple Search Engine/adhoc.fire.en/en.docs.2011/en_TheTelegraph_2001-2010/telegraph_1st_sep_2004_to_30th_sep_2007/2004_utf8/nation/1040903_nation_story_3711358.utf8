 Govt puts lid on ragging probe

 New Delhi: The human resource development 

 ministry has ruled out physical abuse in the ragging case 

 at the School of Planning and Architecture here based on 

 an inquiry it instituted, reports our correspondent.

 There was no physical abuse, only mental trauma. There will now be no more inquiries into the incident, ministry officials concluded after the final inquiry report was handed in on Thursday.

 A first-year student of the institution had alleged that he and his batchmates were forced by seniors to have sex with each other early in August and one of them was even made to copulate with a dog.

 HRD minister Arjun Singh instituted two inquiries despite the schools anti-ragging committee having already taken action against the errant students following a written complaint from the victim. 

 The ministrys first inquiry, conducted by the schools director, Subir Saha, and dean of studies T.M. Vinod Kumar, had failed to record the statement of the victim who had returned home to Patna. The final inquiry, conducted by academicians from outside the school, among others, ascertained the facts after speaking to the victim.

 The school had earlier suspended for three weeks the three accused, who were final-year students of Bachelor of Planning, and fined them Rs 10,000 each. The institute had insisted the harassment was verbal and not physical.

 SC death poser to convict

 New Delhi (PTI): The Supreme Court has 

 asked a murderer appealing against his life sentence to 

 justify why he should not be sent to the gallows.

 Septuagenarian Veerachamy killed his wife on June 18, 1998, after she gave away some of his belongings to his son. He then cut her body into 27 pieces and buried them in a pit dug inside a room.

 The next day, Veerachamy went to police and confessed to the crime. 

 The trial court held him guilty and convicted him of murder and destruction of evidence. He was sentenced for life and asked to pay a fine of Rs 3,000 for the murder while a seven-year jail term and a fine of Rs 2,000 were slapped on him for destroying evidence. Madras High Court upheld the conviction and the sentence.

 An apex court bench of Justices B.. Agrawal and H.K. Sema, while admitting his petition for hearing on Thursday, issued a notice to Veerachamy asking him to show cause as to why the sentence of life imprisonment awarded to him not be enhanced to death sentence.

 The court also refused his plea for bail and called for the records of the trial court and the high court.

 Veil yanked off Punjab women

 GAJINDER SINGH

 Chandigarh, Nov. 17: Women in Punjab are unwanted, malnourished and underprivileged, the state?s latest human development report has revealed.

 Jointly prepared by the Planning Commission of India, the state government, an NGO and the United Nations Development Plan, the 2004 report also highlights the frightening unemployment problem and the poor literacy rate and health care in Punjab.

 Pointing out that over 14 lakh youths in the 15-35 age group are unemployed, the report raises fears of their numbers increasing in future.

 Punjab?s growth rate in agriculture and related sectors has plunged from nearly 10 per cent per annum in the 60s and 70s to 1.84 per cent, far below the national average. The overall growth rate, too, has fallen to 4.08 per cent from 8.4 per cent in the same period. According to the latest quarterly figures, the national growth rate is 7.4 per cent.

 Deprivation of women cuts across regions, classes and castes, the report says. The success of the Green Revolution pushed women, who were important contributors in the fields, back into homes and the work they do is not recognised.

 Although the Sikh religion emphasises an egalitarian society, Punjab?s sex ratio is dismal. At 874 against the national average of 933, it is the second lowest in the country. In 1991, it was 882. Of 10 districts in India with the lowest child sex ratio, seven are in Punjab.

 Maternal health and that of adolescent girls is a cause of concern. ?Raped, killed, mutilated, kidnapped or simply left to die, women became victims not only of the enemy but sometimes their own families. They became symbols as well as targets of family (read male) honour and the easiest targets of violence,? the report observes. 

 It quotes a study that found 24 per cent of women from the privileged class and 74 per cent from the underprivileged sections were undernourished.

 The role of women in decisionmaking is ?invisible?, the report says. No woman was elected to the Lok Sabha in four general elections. Only one had been sent to the Rajya Sabha till 2001. This year, two more were elected. The state has seven Rajya Sabha seats.

 The report contains excerpts of a controversial book written in the early nineties by a Punjab University professor, Manjeet Singh, on the alleged existence of human markets. Migrant men and women, particularly tribals, were sold to the highest bidder, the book alleged. Quoting a price tag of Rs 1,500, the report says this has since risen. The book had created a big row when it was released, with critics saying the claim was untrue.

 The declining growth of agriculture and associated problems, migrant labour, Dalits and women and children figure prominently in the report. But NRIs, who have made a tremendous contribution to the development of the state by way of foreign currency remittances, do not find place.

 The condition of Dalits, though better than in other states, is not rosy. ?Dalits are still deprived of ownership of crucial assets like land, capital, etc. and access to basic social infrastructure,? the report says. Dalits form about 28 per cent of the state?s population.

 Tight watch on human export

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Chandigarh, Dec. 12: In the 1970s, Punjab exported wheat. In the eighties, it was terror. The nineties saw the emergence of foot-tapping Punjabi pop music that caught the ears of the world. Now it is the turn of human trafficking.

 In an incident that has surfaced recently, Amrik Singh, a resident of Nandalo village in Hoshiarpur, was found dead in a container in which he was being transported from Syria to Turkey. Amrik had booked his ticket to a better future through an agent by paying Rs 4 lakh. The agent?s name is being kept secret for investigation purposes.

 Amrik?s father, Darshan Singh, who is the sarpanch of Nandalo, said his son had left for Jordan on August 17. ?We received regular phone calls from him till August 20. On October 18, we were informed by his friend that Amrik was dead. I am told that Amrik died because of unbearable heat and suffocation,? he said.

 According to Darshan, Amrik was shoved into a container with 23 Pakistanis and 10 Indians.

 Police sources said Amrik?s group travelled from Jordan to Iraq on foot. From Iraq, they were taken to Syria and then put in a container marked for Turkey. They had nothing to eat.

 Taking a serious view of dubious travel agents continuing to fleece youths by promising them jobs abroad through wrong means and by forging documents, the Union home ministry has now directed the Punjab government and the Chandigarh administration to keep a strict watch on 14 agents operating in the region.

 The agents, some of whom are women, belong to Chandigarh, Khanna, Hoshiarpur, Sangrur and Nawanshahr.

 ?The abduction of Sukhdev, Antaryami and Tilak Raj has finally forced the government to act. All three were sent abroad by dubious travel agents. While new agents and sub-agents are sprouting every day, the fact that the Centre has realised the gravity of the problem by identifying at least some of them signifies that the problem of human trafficking has to be dealt with sternly,? a senior officer said.

 Enquiries revealed that apart from the abductions in Iraq, the death of two truck drivers also played a major role in identifying agents who are believed to be operating in Punjab, Haryana, Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh.

 Another revelation which has alarmed the Centre concerns a case in which at least 106 people were sent abroad on forged papers by travel agents in alleged connivance with the city?s protector of immigrants. The CBI has thrice raided the office of the protector of immigrants in the recent past. Police sources said six travel agents and two employees of the office have been booked.

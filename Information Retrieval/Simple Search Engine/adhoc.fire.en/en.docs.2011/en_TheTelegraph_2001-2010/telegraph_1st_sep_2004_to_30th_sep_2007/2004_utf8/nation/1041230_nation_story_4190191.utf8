 Tsunami warners to be put in place

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 29: Science and technology minister Kapil Sibal today said the tsunami onslaught, which caught India totally unawares, could not have been prevented ?in the absence of the required instrumentation?.

 The government, however, is now going to put in place a full-fledged system of deep-ocean recording that will equip India with the ability to send out warnings. 

 ?We will instal a system called the Deep-Ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunami (Dart) in the Indian Ocean,? Sibal told a news conference today.

 Approximately, 10-12 Dart systems will be installed in the Indian Ocean between Java-Sumatra and Myanmar. The system will cost Rs 100-125 crore and will take the government two years to put it in place. 

 Such a system already exists in the Pacific Ocean. ?We will coordinate with the Pacific tsunami warning system to learn from their experience,? the minister said.

 The system uses bottom-pressure recorders capable of detecting and measuring tsunamis with an aptitude as small as 1 cm. The data collected will be transmitted by acoustic modem to a surface buoy, which then will relay the information to the ground station through satellite communication.

 The Indian Ocean has a system of coastal buoys to determine the height of the coastline. 

 ?We already have this data. With the Dart system, we will be able to find out the speed at which the tsunami wave is travelling and calculate its probable density when it reaches the coast,? said Sibal. 

 The entire system will be connected to a satellite network. ?We will take the help of the international community and request Indonesia, Thailand and Burma to join the network,? said the minister.

 Countering allegations that the Centre could have alerted people along the coastline, Sibal said: ?There has been a lot of controversy. But an earthquake is not always accompanied by a tsumani. Sometimes, a tsunami after a minor earthquake can even go unnoticed as a wave.?

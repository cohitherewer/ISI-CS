 Naxalite peace talks leapfrog arms hurdle

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Hyderabad, Oct. 16: Peace talks between the Andhra Pradesh government and Naxalite rebels juddered over carrying of arms and a formal ceasefire agreement but picked up pace on the second day as the parties decided to shift focus away from the contentious issues. 

 They agreed to take ahead the landmark talks on ?negotiable? issues like cases against Naxalites and basic problems faced by the people. 

 The government today firmly turned down a request by leaders of the Communist Party of India (Maoist) ? a new entity formed by the merger of the People?s War and the Maoist Communist Centre ? and the Jana Shakti for a signed truce agreement. 

 The cabinet, which met this morning to review the talks, indicated that as the extremist group was banned in several other states, such a pact had to be approved by the Union home ministry. 

 Home minister K. Jana Reddy, who is leading a nine-member government team, also reminded the extremist leaders that consensus has to be achieved over a clause that bars Naxalites from carrying arms during their political campaign. 

 But in the interest of the negotiations, the team said talks could proceed on other issues. ?We can come back to the nitty-gritty of the arms issues and regulations at a later stage,? Jana Reddy said.

 An official source said the arms issue would be made a part of the agenda of talks. The mediators, helping in the talks, will be asked to convince the rebel leaders to soften their stand.

 A three-month truce is in force between the government and the rebels since June 16. It has been extended till November 16. 

 ?You can see how peaceful the villages have been in the last five months. What is needed is a proper political direction to resolve the Naxalite issue,? said Ganesh, a member of the People?s War north Telengana region committee and the talks team. 

 In a signed eight-point charter released late this evening, CPI (Maoist) leader Ramakrishna and Jana Shakti leader Amar urged the government to wind up anti-Naxalite gangs floated by the police and prosecute those involved in fake encounters.

 They demanded that three officials ? inspector-general Ram Tiwari, additional director-general D.T. Naik and inspector-general Gautam Sawang ? be dismissed and prosecuted for allegedly letting loose several surrendered Naxalites on their former colleagues. They also sought release of Naxalite undertrials, removal of cash rewards on the rebels and withdrawal of cases foisted on the Naxalites and their sympathisers. 

 Four prominent rebel leaders ? Ganesh, S. Mallesh, S. Ramesh and K. Veerayya ? should be immediately freed in Rajahmundhry, they added. 

 Reacting to the charter, Jana Reddy said he would discuss it with the chief minister as well as the Centre. 

 Asked about the apparent friction between the two sides, he said: ?Even if there if a fight between a wife and a husband, it will take years to solve it. How do you expect the bitterness between the Naxalites and the government to be resolved in two sittings?? The talks will continue for two more days, he added. 

 The newly formed CPI (Maoist) has decided to hold a massive rally here on November 16 to usher in the new radical platform. ?Technically, the new entity will be born on November 17,? said Naxalite leader Gaganna alias Sudhakar Reddy. On Thursday, an emissary had announced the new outfit in New Delhi.

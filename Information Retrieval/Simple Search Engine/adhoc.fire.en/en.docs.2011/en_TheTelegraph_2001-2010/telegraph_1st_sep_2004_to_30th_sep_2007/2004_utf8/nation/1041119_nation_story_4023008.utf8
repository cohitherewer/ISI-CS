 SC widens fake currency net

 R. VENKATARAMAN

 New Delhi, Nov. 18: The Supreme Court has said the law against counterfeit money allows the government to take action against those printing fake ?currency notes? of any country, not just India.

 It made this observation while punishing K. Hashim and his accomplices for printing US$20 notes in Tamil Nadu back in 1982.

 A division bench of Justices Arijit Passayat and C.K. Thakker said: ?The expression ?currency notes? appearing in IPC is large and wide enough in its amplitude to cover the currency notes of any country.? 

 It added: ?Section 489-C of IPC is not restricted to Indian currency notes alone but it includes dollars also and it applies to American dollar bills.?

 The court said the law against counterfeit notes had been passed to punish those involved in printing and circulating fake currencies.

 Hashim?s accomplices were raided in Chennai and other places in Tamil Nadu and this eventually led to the mastermind?s arrest. The group was convicted by a trial court and the high court. The Supreme Court upheld their conviction.

 The court sounded a warning on the fake currency circulating in India. ?Strange though it may appear, increasingly our country is becoming notorious for (the) spiralling number of cases involving counterfeiting of currency notes, both of our country and foreign countries and stamp papers.?

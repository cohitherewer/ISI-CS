 Seer dilemma dogs BJP

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 Jayendra Saraswati 

New Delhi, Nov. 29: The BJP appears undecided on how to sustain the protest over the arrest of Jayendra Saraswati even as the VHP professed support to a countrywide agitation to be launched by the Hindu Raksha Samiti on December 5.

 In the play of competitive politics between the militant Hindu and political arms of the RSS, the BJP had gained the upper hand when it went on a relay sit-in-cum-fast for three days before the Ranchi national executive. Party chief L.K. Advani talked of a ?mass mobilisation? against the arrest in the Ayodhya mould.

 However, the BJP retraced its steps to some extent following the Kanchi seer?s continuing judicial remand and the Tamil Nadu government counsel?s claim today in Madras High Court that the acharya has ?confessed? to police his involvement in the murder of temple official Shankar Raman.

 Sources said the question of whether the matter should be raised inside Parliament or outside or both will be discussed at a NDA parliamentary party meeting expected tomorrow or the day after. The only decision the BJP has taken so far is to hold a rally against price rise at Ram Leela ground here on December 1 when the winter session begins.

 ?So far, our view is to give precedence to price rise over the acharya?s arrest,? said a senior MP. 

 The deputy leader of the BJP in the Rajya Sabha, Sushma Swaraj, met the seer today in Kancheepuram. ?She told some of us that he denied having made a confession to the police,? said a source.

 The rally against the rise in prices will be addressed by former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Advani.

 All the state units have been directed to galvanise people for this show, which, sources said, was aimed at putting a government run by ?the most distinguished economists? on the mat in Parliament.

 BJP spokesperson Yashwant Sinha told reporters how the NDA was able to sustain the repeated knocks dealt by increases in global crude oil prices ? a reason cited by the UPA government to explain the rise in prices. ?A very major issue of the current situation is that despite the presence of very distinguished economists in government, the government has not been able to get the better of inflation.?

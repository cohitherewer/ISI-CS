 Minority bill divides BJP, allies

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 19: The Janata Dal (United) and the Telugu Desam Party supported the United Progressive Alliance?s move to pass a bill seeking creation of a national commission for minority educational institutions on Thursday, even as the BJP vehemently opposed its passage.

 BJP members staged a walkout when the bill was put to vote, saying the law is ?dangerous? and part of a conspiracy for another partition of the country, but its key allies ? the Dal (U), Desam and the BJD ? did not follow and supported the bill.

 Desam parliamentary party leader Yerran Naidu said: ?We welcome the bill. The Desam is a secular party. The minority institutions should have the freedom to choose which university they want to be affiliated to.?

 BJP parliamentary party spokesperson V.K. Malhotra said the party would oppose the bill when it comes for voting in the Rajya Sabha. He said the measure would give a boost to separatists.

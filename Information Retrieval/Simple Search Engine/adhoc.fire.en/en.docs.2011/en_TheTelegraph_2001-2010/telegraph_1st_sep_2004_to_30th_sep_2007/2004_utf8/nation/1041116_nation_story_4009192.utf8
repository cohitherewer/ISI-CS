 Biotech park debut in Chennai

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, Nov. 15: Biotechnology found a home in Tamil Nadu with the inauguration last week of a research and development facility that was set up with help from the Cornell University of the US.

 The first set of companies and research institutions in this high-prized ?knowledge business? moved into the five-storeyed TICEL Bio-Park at Taramani, the state?s premier institutional area in south Chennai, on Day I.

 The Rs 62.50-crore bio-park ? built on 5 acres provided by the state government ? is the ?first of its kind in India?, state industries secretary and TICEL chairman Rameshram Mishra said last week.

 The ?training centre? at the park, in partnership with leading universities and scientific institutions, would impart training in specialised programmes ?to develop valuable intellectual property rights? in the frontier areas of biotechnology, Mishra said.

 With custom-designed infrastructure for research and development laboratories, the park also has a bio-resources centre on the ground floor, a conference hall and a business centre, Mishra said.

 TICEL has three scientists on its board ? two from the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, and the other from the Central Leather Research Institute, a Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) lab in Chennai.

 Any research proposal would be first scanned by the bio-park?s scientific advisory committee for its ?ethical acceptability? before it was taken up for pilot-scale and commercial-scale development, Mishra said.

 The ?bio-resources centre, said Mishra and park managing director K.R. Vishwanathan, would be a common facility, with the institutions running it also providing assistance and services to all clients who set up shop in the park.

 The CLRI and Hyderabad-based Vimta Labs have already moved into the bio-resources centre, they said.

 SGS India, a subsidiary of a Swiss biotech firm, is among the organisations that have signed up or shown interest in setting up labs from the first floor upwards, Mishra said. 

 Leading US pharmaceutical companies, too, have ?checked us out and are finding TICEL a good place to work in?, Mishra said. He also threw the doors open to Indian-born scientists who want to return with new project ideas.

 Chief minister Jayalalithaa formally inaugurated the bio-park which has been set up with design and technical assistance from the US varsity and promoted by the Tamil Nadu Industrial Development Corporation. There were no formal speeches at the simple function at the park, which is close to information-technology hub TIDEL Park and right behind IIT Madras.

 PM?s Afghan poser on transit facilities

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 9: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today told US secretary of defence Donald Rumsfeld India was keen to help in the ?reconstruction of a secular and democratic Iraq? and ?we can do a lot more to help Afghanistan if we are given transit facilities by Pakistan?.

 Singh also welcomed the elections in Afghanistan and expressed the hope that elections would also be conducted in Iraq. He said India is keen to do more for Afghanistan. ?Transit facilities are a normal right extended by neighbours to each other in all civilised societies,? a statement quoted the Prime Minister as saying.

 The remarks come in the wake of external affairs minister K. Natwar Singh?s comment in Parliament yesterday that India will not send officials to Iraq for its elections slated for January 30.

 Rumsfeld is understood to have told Indian leaders that ?Iraq is a dangerous place but I am an optimist?.

 Singh said he was looking forward to a visit by President George W. Bush in 2005.

 PM hints at migrant act beyond Assam 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Guwahati, Nov. 22: Describing the contentious Illegal Migrants (Determination by Tribunals) Act as a legislation based on ?sound principles?, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today indicated that it would not only remain applicable in Assam but also be extended to other parts of the country.

 ?The act is not designed to encourage illegal migrants. It is there to ensure that while detecting and deporting the foreigners, innocent Indian citizens from the minority communities are not harassed,? he told the media at Guwahati?s Lokapriya Gopinath Bordoloi International Airport. 

 ?Personally, I believe that such an act should be enforced in other parts of the country,? the Prime Minister said.

 Singh, however, admitted the influx of illegal migrants from Bangladesh to Assam and the other northeastern states. ?I share the concern over the influx of foreigners.? 

 He said Delhi had taken up the subject with the Bangladesh government, though the latter continues to deny illegal migration to India from its territory.

 Singh, who visited Manipur before coming to Assam, stressed the need for effective border management to stop illegal migration. ?The fencing along the Indo-Pakistan border in Jammu and Kashmir has checked influx to a large extent,? he said.

 The influential All Assam Students? Union (AASU) had threatened to disrupt the Prime Minister?s visit and the Indo-Asean rally, which he flagged off, in protest against the Union cabinet?s recent decision to retain the IM(DT) Act. 

 It agreed not to resort to agitation only after an assurance from chief minister Tarun Gogoi that tripartite talks would be convened to discuss the implementation of the 1985 Assam Accord.

 After announcing that the IM(DT) Act is here to stay, the Prime Minister turned down the Ulfa?s demand for discussions on ?sovereignty?. 

 ?Assam is an integral part of India and there should not be any doubt in anybody?s mind about it,? he said. 

 Singh said Delhi was ready for ?unconditional talks? with any outfit that shuns the path of violence. ?We cannot be oblivious of the fact that the Indian system of democracy allows redressal of all grievances through peaceful negotiations,? he said.

 On his recent meeting with writer Mamoni Raisom Goswami, Singh said he encouraged her initiative. He acknowledged that informal contact had been established with the Ulfa through her.

 Summing up his visit to the state, Singh hoped his meeting with the people would begin a new chapter of peace and prosperity.

 In an immediate reaction to Singh?s statement, the Ulfa said there was nothing new in the Prime Minister?s announcement.

 ?This means Delhi is not prepared to discuss the issue of Assam?s sovereignty, which further means they will continue to exploit the natural resources of Assam,? a person identifying himself as Ulfa ?commander-in-chief? Paresh Barua told newspaper offices here over telephone. 

 ?Manmohan Singh, despite his humble background and sincere approach, cannot change this reality,? he added.

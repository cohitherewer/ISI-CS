 Agenda push to PWG talks

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, Oct. 5: The Andhra Pradesh government today endorsed in principle the agenda and modalities for the peace negotiations with the extremist groups slated for October 15.

 The agenda approved in today?s meeting includes withdrawal of cases against Naxalite activists, release of political prisoners, removal of cash awards on activists of Naxalite groups, disbanding of anti-Naxalite groups promoted by the police and a separate Telengana.

 Briefing newsmen after a three-hour session with emissaries of the Peoples War Group (PWG) and the Jana Shakti, home minister K. Jana Reddy said the ?semi-finals? were over and all should get ready for the talks. Twenty members, including the mediator, S.R.Sankaran, participated in the meeting.

 The home minister said he would apprise the chief minister and officials of his ministry on the suggestions and modalities put forth by the Naxalite groups. ?If need be, I will have another session with the emissaries and coordinators.?

 He said the government had made arrangements to provide a safe passage to the extremist leaders who surface from October 11. However, the security forces were yet to give a clearance for the Jubilee Hall as the venue of the talks, he added.

 The Peoples War representative, P. Varavara Rao, said the meeting with the government on the peace process had been constructive. ?I am happy that the present government has respected the peoples? wish for peace and talks with the extremist activists,? he added.

 After the meeting at Hyderabad, the venue of the talks will be shifted to towns of all the three regions of the state. ?The talks may be held either at Warangal, Guntur, Vishakhapatnam or Anantpur,? he said.

 Revolutionary balladeer Gaddar hoped that the Congress government would not act like its predecessor, the Telugu Desam Party, and sabotage the talks. ?The Telugu Desam encouraged encounters even as they spoke to us across the table,? he said.

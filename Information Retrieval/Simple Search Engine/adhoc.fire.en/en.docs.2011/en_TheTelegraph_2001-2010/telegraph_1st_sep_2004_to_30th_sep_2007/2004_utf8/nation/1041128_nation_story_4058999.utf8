 Jostle for view of Taj

 Agra, Nov. 27 (PTI): It was an ordeal for tourists, who were made to wait for hours today, to get tickets for the first night viewing of the Taj Mahal after two decades.

 There was disarray at the ticket counter at the Archaeological Survey of India?s (ASI) office with frequent power cuts and computer shutdowns. There was also a last-minute rush for tickets.

 Pooja Desai from Mumbai, who came with her husband to see the monument, said she had to wait the entire day for the tickets for tomorrow?s night viewing.

 The Supreme Court guidelines said the ticketing procedure had to be fully computerised and the deadline for issuing tickets had been set at 24 hours before night viewing.

 Death heat on Laloo 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Nov. 15: Senior BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi today alleged that railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav?s ?theatrics? led to the death of five Bihar-bound women passengers at New Delhi station on Saturday.

 Modi said the Rashtriya Janata Dal president, to present his ?pro-poor face? on the occasion of Chhat, decided to get his special ministerial salon attached to the Jan Sadharan Express, which is an unreserved second-class train.

 ?As a consequence, jawans of the Railway Protection Force cordoned off a large part of the platform to allow Laloo Prasad to board the Patna-bound train. The huge festival rush got concentrated on the other part of the platform, which led to the stampede and the subsequent deaths,? the BJP vice-president said.

 He added that Laloo Prasad, instead of taking the evening plane to Patna, deliberately caused inconvenience to the passengers who were to board the Jan Sadharan Express. 

 ?The minister could have got his coach attached to the other superfast trains. But he thought it wise to bother the passengers and in the process, five lives were lost. That was his Chhat gift to Bihar,? he added.

 The train, despite the stampede, had left on time.

 Chopper boost to Nepal

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 9: India has agreed to give two more advanced light helicopters to Nepal, signalling Delhi?s commitment to help Kathmandu in its fight against Maoist rebels.

 The choppers would help Nepal ferry its troops in the quickest possible time and effectively deal with the armed rebels fighting the Royal Nepal Army across the country.

 India had earlier given Nepal two AL helicopters, the success of which in operations against the Maoists led Kathmandu to seek a few more of the choppers.

 The latest decision was taken when Nepal Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba today met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, foreign minister K. Natwar Singh, defence minister Pranab Mukherjee and home minister Shivraj Patil.

 Two pacts on cultural cooperation, and science and technology were also signed.

 Deuba, who arrived here yesterday, would also meet other leaders, including water resources minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, and industry representatives over the next three days.

 He is scheduled to address the Confederation of Indian Industry tomorrow in an apparent bid to present Nepal as an attractive investment destination.

 But it remains to be seen if the Indian business community would be reassured by what Deuba has to say in the backdrop of the Maoist threat to close down over 47 companies, many of them joint ventures and three or four having an Indian stake.

 His goodwill visit had raised quite a few eyebrows both in Kathmandu and Delhi. But this evening while interacting with the Nepalese media, Deuba clarified he was here on a ?working visit?. He is leading a delegation of five ministers and nearly 25 businessmen, apart from a large contingent from the Nepalese media.

 Questions, however, remained on the Deuba government?s legitimacy since he is the king?s nominee and not the Nepalese people?s, and whether he would be able to deliver on any of the promises he makes in India.

 During his interactions with the Indian leadership, the entire gamut of bilateral relations was discussed. But the focus was on the threat posed by Maoists, particularly their recent economic blockade of Kathmandu and shutdown threat to 47 firms.

 South Block officials said Delhi was committed to supporting Kathmandu ?any which way it wanted? to deal with the Maoists. 

 They also admitted an agreement to supply two AL helicopters but refused details on what military hardware India is willing to give to Nepal.

 Sources said Delhi has been helping Kathmandu with a number of equipment ranging from assault rifles to anti-mine vehicles.

 There has been a growing demand in Nepal that the UN be involved to find an amicable solution to the ongoing stand-off between the government and the Maoists.

 Like most other countries, India is in favour of a political settlement to the problem.

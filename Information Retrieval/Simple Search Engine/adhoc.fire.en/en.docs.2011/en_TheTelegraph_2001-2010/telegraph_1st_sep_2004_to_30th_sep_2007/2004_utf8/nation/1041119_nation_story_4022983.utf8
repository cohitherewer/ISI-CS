 Sorry Uma seeks sorry in return

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, Nov. 18: Uma 

 Bharti has apologised to BJP chief L.K. Advani for daring 

 him to take disciplinary action against her in another sign 

 that her ?homecoming? is in the offing. But the apology 

 comes with a caveat.

 The sadhvi has said the BJP should also say sorry for ?personalising issues of nationalist import like swadeshi and political cleanliness and identifying them with individuals?. She argues that she is more sinned against than sinning and that the real culprits have got away scot-free.

 Two days after she sent a missive to BJP workers from her Himalayan retreat, Uma wrote a letter to Advani dated last Sunday. It was handed to him today. 

 Copies of the letter were released to the media courtesy the Madhya Pradesh Bhavan here, but the envelope to Advani contained another ?confidential? letter, referred to in the other missive.

 Uma made it clear she had not written in to have her suspension rescinded. ?I will also have to think of whether I want to return. This is not a one-sided decision but involves both sides.? She said she has sent a similar letter to Atal Bihari Vajpayee.

 The sadhvi wrote: ?The nation is in the throes of a crisis. The BJP alone can confront the challenges that lie ahead. But for this, the party will have to take certain bold decisions. Ram and roti, social equality of all sections, swadeshi and public conduct ? these are issues on which our policies need to be spelt out clearly. These issues I have addressed in a separate letter which will remain confidential.?

 Sources say in their ?information and understanding? the secret letter contains the ?evidence? against ?four or five? BJP Rajya Sabha MPs that Uma had threatened to reveal to Advani.

 One target was general secretary Pramod Mahajan whom she accused of being a ?power-broker?. The RSS is believed to think likewise.

 As if on cue, Advani clipped Mahajan?s wings today, replacing his brother-in-law Gopinath Munde as Maharashtra BJP chief with Nitin Gadkari, who enjoys RSS backing. The official explanation was that Munde, who is leader of the BJP legislature party, cannot hold a second office in keeping with the ?one person one post? norm.

 But those close to Mahajan questioned the decision, saying Advani is party chief and leader of the Opposition.

 Hurriyat unity not in sight

 New Delhi, Nov. 24: The Pakistan Prime Minister managed to bring warring Kashmiri separatists together to break bread yesterday but there were clear indications that the unity attempt would take more than a dinner meeting.

 It was evident the effort would need to be made not by Islamabad but by the separatists themselves. Shaukat Aziz broached the subject at his four-hour interaction here with separatist leaders that continued well past midnight.

 He separately met the moderate Hurriyat Conference leaders (Maulana Abbas Ansari, Abdul Gani Bhat, Bilal Lone and Mirwaiz Umer Farooq), hardliner Syed Ali Shah Geelani and some of his supporters, and non-Hurriyat separatists Yasin Malik and Shabir Shah before the dinner yesterday.

 It was learnt the Kashmiri separatist leaders made light of the significance of forging unity, arguing that the roads they took did not make much difference as long as these led to the same goal.

 The moderates and the Malik-Shah combine did at one point make some conciliatory noises, sources said.

 But Geelani clearly indicated it would be difficult for him to return to the Hurriyat, which he had quit in protest against the moderates? decision to talk to the Centre. After the dinner, Geelani snubbed a reporter who asked him about unity moves. ?You (media) people should not bother about it. It is our problem.?

 A ?problem? that People?s Conference chief Bilal Lone said ?would be resolved... but it will happen in the natural course of events?.

 He objected to reports that Aziz had pushed the separatists to join hands. ?It came up for discussion but in the normal process.?

 The Hurriyat, Lone said, was willing to talk to the Centre, which he insisted had misinterpreted their request to be allowed to visit Pakistan .

 At today?s lunch hosted for Aziz by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, foreign minister K. Natwar Singh introduced Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed and Mehbooba Mufti as the ?true representatives of J amp;K?.

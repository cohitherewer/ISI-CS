The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 No room for comfort

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Ranchi, Nov. 24: Pramod Mahajan came in for flak when he hosted the BJP?s last national executive in a seven-star resort in suburban Mumbai with multi-course meals.

 The BJP had been humbled at the hustings, its ?India Shining? slogan construed as an insult to the poor. 

 The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh also took exception to the perceived profligacy of some GeNext members. Conspicuous consumption was the last thing it needed.

 Mahajan made or at least hoped to make amends by putting up in the rather run-down ITDC-owned Ashoka Hotel in Ranchi in deference to the Sangh?s desire without ado. So did the other general secretaries, some without fretting, others carping on the side.

 Ranchi does not lack decent hotels, but when the RSS-BJP and L.K. Advani?s image and credentials were at stake, how could dank hotels with malfunctioning air-conditioners and geysers matter?

 One senior functionary, used to a more-than-comfortable lifestyle, was heard grumbling that the National Democratic Alliance government?s biggest mistake was not to tell the poor that they should ?feel good? but not going ahead and divesting ITDC. When a room in the swanky Capitol Hill was offered to him, he turned it down, saying if he did, it would be written about.

 Capitol Hill was reserved for Jaswant Singh, whom the BJP loves to indulge without feeling guilty, and the security-encircled chief ministers.

 Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Advani were put up at Raj Bhavan. Murli Manohar Joshi, whose penchant for ?home-cooked? food is well known, was a guest at the home of a local Rajya Sabha MP, Ajay Maru.

 Yashwant Sinha flitted between the home of a relative, Capitol Hill and Ashoka, ostensibly depending on who ought to be obliged.

 The ?pampered? ones were the BJP?s newest acquisitions who came with their cachets. They included Varun Gandhi, Najma Heptullah and Smriti Irani. They were given rooms in the colonial-style Ranchi Club courtesy Maru. So was Shatrughan Sinha.

 Hema Malini and Maneka Gandhi were booked at the Gymkhana Club but neither showed up.

 Sulk spurs sop shower by party

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 21: The BJP is bending over backwards to keep Uma Bharti in good humour.

 With Maharashtra polls round the corner, the party has not only lined up a veteran ally to speak at her ?tiranga yatra? but also a reception and a hectic schedule for her for next month?s Assembly election.

 Sources, however, believe that the real test of the BJP brass? indulgence of Uma would lie in whether her nominee, Prahlad Patel, gets a ticket from Nahota for the bypoll in Madhya Pradesh.

 So far, party chief M. Venkaiah Naidu has gone along with the state unit?s view that Patel should not be obliged, the sources added.

 But following Uma?s bouts of sulk over the alleged lack of attention her tiranga yatra got from the party brass and the media, the BJP has managed to rope in Akali Dal chief Parkash Singh Badal to address the yatra?s final rally in Jallianwala Bagh on Saturday along with Atal Bihari Vajpayee.

 Badal will, in turn, get the sadhvi to campaign for the Akali candidate in the Kapurthala bypoll, the sources said. BJP general secretary Arun Jaitley, too, may take time off from BCCI elections to be in Amritsar.

 Also lined up is the party?s ?grand? reception for Uma when she arrives in Delhi on September 27. Two days later, she will be flown to Mumbai and asked to stay put in Maharashtra for the poll campaign.

 Election supervisor Pramod Mahajan has been asked to schedule as many meetings for Uma as for Sushma Swaraj although state leaders are reportedly in favour of using Sushma more because of ?popular? demand.

 Upset with some of her party seniors, Uma is suspected to opt for ?agyatvas? after the tiranga yatra. So to retain her in the ?political? mainstream, the BJP will also engage her in the Bihar and Jharkhand poll preparations shortly after Maharashtra is done with.

 Sources working in Bihar billed Uma the ?ideal foil? to Laloo Prasad Yadav because ?like him, she was a hit with the masses because of her earthy style of speaking?.

 There are other reasons why the BJP thinks Uma is its answer to the Rashtriya Janata Dal chief.

 ?She has a backward caste identity, which is not caste or sub-caste specific. She is not a Yadav or Kurmi leader but a leader of the backward castes as a whole,? a source explained.

 ?At a certain level, she also transcends the caste barrier because of her identification with Hindutva. The upper castes have also accepted her as one of them,? the source claimed.

 Soldier fury kills civilian

 Srinagar, Nov. 30: Kashmir?s halting steps towards normality faltered for the second time in two days when security forces opened fire on protesting villagers in Baramulla district, killing a 60-year-old man.

 The soldiers, police said, were angered by massive demonstrations in Hakbara, where continuous cordon-and-search operations for the last three days ignited the fury of residents. Four villagers were also injured in the firing.

 Yesterday, two villagers were killed and four seriously injured when cordoning troops fired on civilians after a tiff broke out between soldiers and residents of Dangerpora in central Budgam district over continuous harassment of the villagers.

 Residents of Hakbara, about 30 km from here, said the troops thrashed several villagers during the search operation. The army, however, says the ?villagers indulged in stone pelting on the troops in the village resulting in injuries to three troopers?.

 The injured civilians have been admitted to a Srinagar hospital. The dead villager has been identified as Abdul Khaliq Sheikh.

 The incident has marred the atmosphere in the Valley where reduction in the number of troops as part of the Centre?s peace offensive had raised hopes of a gradual return to normality. ?Indiscriminate action taken by an individual official on the spur of the moment jeopardises all the good work done by the security forces,? chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed said. 

 ?A single mistake spoils the atmosphere,? he added and assured that the guilty will be ?punished?. Mufti said the security forces have been told in ?categorical terms to uphold human rights and avoid collateral damage during anti-insurgency operations?.

 Minister of state for home Abdul Rehman Veeri, who visited Dangerpora today, told protesters that an inquiry had been ordered into the incident in their village and the ?guilty would be brought to book?.

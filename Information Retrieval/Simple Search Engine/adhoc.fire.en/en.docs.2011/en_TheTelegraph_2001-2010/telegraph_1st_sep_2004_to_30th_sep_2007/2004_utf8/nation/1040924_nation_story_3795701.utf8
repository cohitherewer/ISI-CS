 Mirage wheels fall off 

 OUR BUREAU AND AGENCIES

 Gwalior/ New Delhi, Sept. 23: The pilot of a frontline Mirage 2000 of the Indian Air Force kept his nerve when the wheels fell off his fighter aircraft shortly after take-off this afternoon and ejected safely after burning out the fuel.

 The aircraft crashed near the air force?s ranges in Gwalior on an uninhabited spot.

 Squadron leader H.S. Gill took off from the IAF?s Gwalior station ? the homebase of two squadrons of the multi-role fighter aircraft ? for a sortie to practice mid-air interceptions of enemy aircraft at 12.45 pm.

 He radioed to control, sensing a defect in the undercarriage. A wheel fell off and it was clear that the aircraft would not be able to land.

 An IAF spokesman in Delhi said the pilot was advised to eject after using up the fuel to minimise damage. ?After burning out the fuel, he set the aircraft on a course to crash in an area where there is no settlement,? the spokesman said.

 Gill ejected and parachuted to ground. He was picked up by a helicopter and returned to base where he was put through a medical examination. The squadron leader is said to be unhurt.

 Gwalior is the homebase of two squadrons of the French-made Mirage 2000 that were first inducted into the IAF in 1987. Today?s is the fourth crash of an IAF Mirage. 

 A court of inquiry was ordered. The Mirage 2000 is said to be among the safest of aircraft in the IAF?s inventory.

 Aziz claims terror fight

 BHARAT BHUSHAN

 New Delhi, Nov. 24: Pakistan Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz claimed that his country was committed to fighting terrorism and suggested that Pakistan had addressed India?s concerns on this issue .

 Aziz quoted Indian leaders and media reports to say that ?the situation in the (Kashmir) Valley is different (today) than what it was.?

 ?I have also read reports saying that this has created the right environment for us to talk about Kashmir,? he said.

 Without going into specifics of how Pakistan had met India?s concerns on terrorism from across the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir, Aziz insisted that his country was ?doing a lot to create an atmosphere to get the dialogue (with India) going?.

 However, answering questions at a breakfast meeting with Indian editors, he admitted: ?Life is never perfect. We could always agree that some things ought to be done differently.? He said the future economic prospect and potential of South Asia as a region should be the context which should energise the peace process between India and his country.

 There may be some people, Aziz said, who might have doubts about the process and may have security concerns. However, he said: ?But we should not allow that to discourage us.?

 As if to underline his country?s fight against terrorism, Aziz said: ?Our President and I, both have been subject to acts of terrorism.? He claimed their escaping unhurt was providential. He argued: ?It is in our interest to create an environment within our country that is conducive to growth.?

 Aziz said his country had demonstrated its will in fighting terrorism and that it would continue to do so. Pakistan, he said, was at the forefront of the war against terrorism. 

 Refuting the suggestion that Islamabad?s relationship with Washington was based entirely on its usefulness in the US war against terrorism, Aziz said: ?Fighting this war is not the cornerstone of our relationship with a particular country.? He claimed that Pakistan?s relations with other countries were not ?one-dimensional? and were, in fact, broad-based.

 Aziz projected Pakistan as ?a moderate, enlightened state which will be the anchor of stability in the region?. He claimed that geography had given Pakistan a strategic advantage and ?no one can take that away from us?.

 He talked of ?a stronger Pakistan? but felt: ?To achieve that we need a few things ? a credible defence which would guarantee peace, a strong economy because without economic sovereignty you can do nothing, and good relations and peace with its neighbours. This is the strategic vision we have of ourselves. We want the world to perceive us in this perspective.?

 Defending the nuclear weaponisation of his country, the Pakistan Prime Minister claimed that this capability provided a ?strategic balance?, which was a guarantee for peace and stability in the region.? He denied that Pakistan had any aggressive designs against anyone ?but we will have adequate capabilities to defend ourselves?. 

 The proof of the nuclear pudding, as it were, he claimed could be seen in the fact that ?not long ago, we had one million troops on our border and if we did not have this credible (nuclear) deterrent and credible diplomacy, one wonders what might have happened?.

 In an attempt to brush aside the horrendous episode of Pakistan?s top nuclear scientist running a virtual corner shop selling nuclear technology, Aziz claimed: ?We believe in non-proliferation of nuclear capability and are geared up and organised to ensure that.?

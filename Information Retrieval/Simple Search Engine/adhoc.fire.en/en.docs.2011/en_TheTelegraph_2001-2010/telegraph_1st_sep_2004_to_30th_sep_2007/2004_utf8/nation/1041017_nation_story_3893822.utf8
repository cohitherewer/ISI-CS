 Morale booster poll lost, BJP plans go awry

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

New Delhi, Oct. 16: For the BJP, the Maharashtra 

election was a ?make-or-mar? one for more than one reason. At stake was not just 

Pramod Mahajan?s destiny but in a sense the party?s.

 If Maharashtra was won, the BJP believed it would be the morale booster it needed before it took on the might of Laloo Prasad Yadav, the halo of ?martyrdom? around Shibu Soren and the collective power of the Congress-Bansi Lal combine in the February 2005 elections.

 More important, it was expected to reinforce the BJP theory that the UPA government was an ?aberration? ? that it lacked popular legitimacy and would have to go sooner or later, either through paranormal configuration or political realignment.

 First the BJP played with stars, literally. It peddled the ?prediction? of an in-house astrologer that the Manmohan Singh government would fall on September 26, the Prime Minister?s birthday, and either Atal Bihari Vajpayee would be back or a BJP-backed dispensation would be in place. 

 When nothing happened, the BJP outlined a scenario in which some UPA constituents like the DMK, NCP and the Lok Janshakti Party would quit the coalition after the Maharashtra election, which it was certain to win.

 Sensing the BJP was back in the reckoning, these parties would team up with the Samajwadi Party, Janata Dal (United) and other NDA constituents and have an alternative formation headed either by M. Karunanidhi or Mulayam Singh Yadav, with George Fernandes as the deputy Prime Minister. The BJP would support it from outside.

 The scenario went for a toss today and the BJP?s immediate concern was how it would face the next round of polls.

 The cadre were down and out after the ?shock? defeat in the Lok Sabha polls, the leadership was in disarray as a section of the party believed that Vajpayee and .K. Advani were ?spent? forces and there was no clear alternative emerging from the second rung. 

 Ideologically, the party was at the crossroads, wondering if development and governance made more sense to people than Hindutva.

 A meeting of the RSS in Hardwar in early November was expected to yield direction on these aspects, BJP sources said. 

 After the Lok Sabha rout, the RSS had indicated to Advani that there should be an organisational overhaul if the BJP was to be taken seriously again.

 Sources said the RSS suggested that M. Venkaiah Naidu should be replaced as party president. But it was told everything would be put on hold until the Maharashtra elections.

 Sources said the RSS felt it had an upper hand vis-a-vis the BJP and would demand that Naidu should go. 

 If an appropriate successor was not found immediately, the Sangh could consider having Murli Manohar Joshi as the ?transitional? party chief for a while. Advani and Vajpayee would function as ?honorary? advisers.

 The Sangh?s assessment was that none of the second-rank leaders was suitable for the job. Advani may reportedly urge the Sangh to put its blueprint on hold again till the Bihar polls.

 Even if the RSS was unable to effect a leadership change immediately, sources said it would ask the party to revert to its Jan Sangh line, the ?back-to-basics? ideology that Naidu talked of after the Lok Sabha polls.

 In Maharashtra, Hindutva, which was initially offered in the ?Savarkar-Tricolour? wrapping, was junked after the state leaders felt ?anti-incumbency? against the Congress-NCP government was a catchier slogan.

 ?The verdict is out. What is their answer now?? asked an RSS source. The sources felt that Hindutva was the answer to prevent the BJP?s ?core? vote from straying away in Bihar and Jharkhand. 

 This was the reason why it appointed two upper caste representatives, C.P. Thakur and Taranath Jha, as the vice-chairmen of its Bihar campaign committee.

 Until yesterday, the BJP hoped a Maharashtra win may set the momentum for a new power equation, if not at the Centre then in Bihar. Its calculation was that Lok Janshakti Party leader Ram Vilas Paswan, who was upset with Laloo Prasad Yadav, may relook at the BJP as a potential winner and join its alliance with the blandishment of chiefministership. ?That gambit has failed. Paswan may want to be with a winning alliance,? a source said.

 BJP sources admitted they would have to shed their aggressive ways in Parliament when the winter session starts and begin playing the role of a ?constructive? Opposition. ?May be our disruptive ways have not gone down well with people.?

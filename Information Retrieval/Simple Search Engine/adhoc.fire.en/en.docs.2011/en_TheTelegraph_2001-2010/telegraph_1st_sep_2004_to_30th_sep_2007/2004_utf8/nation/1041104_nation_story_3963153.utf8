 Bobby Jindal

 Washington, Nov. 3 (Agencies): Republican candidate Bobby Jindal, who last year lost the race for governor in Louisiana state, today won the US Congress elections, becoming the first Indian-American to do so in nearly five decades. 

 The 33-year-old poster boy of the Republican Party polled 78 per cent or 213,610 votes against his nearest Democrat rival Roy Armstrong who polled 7 per cent or 18,531 votes. 

 Jindal will represent the first district that covers New Orleans, which was earlier vacated by David Vitter.

 Jindal, a converted Christian, is the second Indian American to be elected to the US Congress after Dilip Singh Saund of California in 1956. 

 The Indian American, who had lost the governor?s race to Democrat Catherine Blanco last year, looks set for a great future in Capitol Hill in view of his record in healthcare administration. 

 In Punjab, while celebrating his win, Jindal?s cousin Harbinder Kumar said: ?We are very happy ... we pray for his well being.?

 One of Jindal?s aunts said the phones at their house had not stopped ringing. His relatives danced in the streets and distributed sweets in the dusty town of Malerkotla.

 Jindal is a second generation American. His parents ? his father was an engineer and his mother worked for the state government ? migrated to the US in the late 1960s. Jindal converted to Christianity in his teens and was appointed assistant secretary of health in the Bush administration.

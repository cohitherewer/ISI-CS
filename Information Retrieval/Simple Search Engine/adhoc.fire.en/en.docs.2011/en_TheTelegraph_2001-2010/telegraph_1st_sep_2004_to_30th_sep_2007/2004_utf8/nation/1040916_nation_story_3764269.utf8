 Fine Rs 20000 a day, watch flyover finish

 AYSWARIA VENUGOPAL

 New Delhi, Sept. 15: On 

 Friday, curtains will go up on the country?s longest monolithic 

 flyover that has taken a little over a year and a Rs 20,000-a-day 

 late fine in the last month to finish.

 The 1.5-km flyover on Outer Ring Road in the capital was started on March 18, 2003. It was to have been ready in a year but construction was delayed by three-four months because water, power and telephone lines had to be shifted. To compensate for this, the deadline was pushed back to August 15, 2004.

 When the project overshot the revised deadline, the Delhi government decided to act tough. Plagued by postponements and cost overruns since early 1996 when it set out to build flyovers and make Ring Road signal-free, the government for the first time invoked the penalty clause in the contract and slapped a Rs 20,000 fine for every day of delay.

 Unitech, the firm building the flyover for the Delhi public works department, snapped into action. Three shifts were pressed in on August 15 and construction picked up breakneck speed. A month later, the project that has cost Rs 20.7 crore is ready to be inaugurated.

 Project managers in charge of the flyover that will cover the Mata Anandmayi Marg section of Outer Ring Road, close to the ancient Kalka Temple and Bahai?i Temple, can?t stop talking about it.

 Jagmohan Swarup, in-charge of the project, said most flyovers in the capital are built by preparing a foundation on which vertical columns are constructed. Ball bearings are placed on the columns and on them rest the deck slabs and T-beams.

 ?It is these bearings and joints which create the maximum problem in maintenance. They have to be replaced and this is very cumbersome. Traffic on Nizamuddin Bridge and even Minto Bridge was closed for months for repairs,? Swarup pointed out.

 But the Anandmayi flyover is jointless and bearing-free and maintenance should be easy. 

 ?In the central portion, which is equal to 150 metres, prepared concrete was brought and in-situ construction of the pier and deck was done using steel shuttering,? Swarup said. The concrete was brought to the site and moulded on a reinforced cement concrete deck.

 For the approaches, the engineers used reinforced earth wall with geo-grid reinforcements and high-density polymer ethylene conforming to international standards, 2.5 times the usual strength for flyovers in the country.

 Designed for ambient temperature changes of about 50 degrees Celsius, Anandmayi flyover is well-equipped to handle Delhi?s extreme climate. It can also withstand earthquakes of up to 6 on the Richter scale.

 Governor in Goa standoff

 FREDERICK NORONHA

 Panaji, Oct. 26: Goa governor S.C. Jamir and chief minister Manohar Parrikar are on collision course over defections.

 In a media interview earlier this week, the Congress member-turned governor spoke out against the ?poaching? of MLAs by the ruling BJP, which has clung on to power for four years in a state not known for stable governments.

 Goa, with a population of 14 lakh, has a 40-seat Assembly. In the mid-2002 elections, the BJP won 17 of the 40 seats but wrested power with the support of Independents and smaller parties.

 In October 1999, the BJP had ousted the Congress from power by weaning away some of the party?s MLAs and had formed a coalition government. A year later, the BJP forced out the allies and established its own regime with the help of some more defectors. In August this year, a Congress MLA resigned from the Assembly, contested his seat on a BJP ticket and won convincingly amid charges of money playing a big role in the poll. 

 The governor condemned this trend in media interviews. He threatened to ?dissolve? the Assembly if the situation persists and he is forced to ?step in?. Jamir also spoke out against the ?poaching? of MLAs by the ruling benches, suggesting that while this was being done within the framework of the newly-amended anti-defection law, it amounted to political immorality.

 ?As long as the state is run normally, there is no need for the governor to step in. But if the situation gets out of hand, I shall be forced to step in,? he was quoted as saying. 

 The recently-appointed governor added: ?I am here to uphold the Constitution of India and the anti-defection law clearly prohibits any kind of defection, whether direct or indirect.?

 Quick on the defensive, Parrikar, who has almost single-handedly kept the BJP in power, denied that he was ?poaching?. Parrikar argued that the Congress MLA had declared his intention to leave the party in the first week of August and had joined the BJP only on August 20, giving ?sufficient time for the Congress leaders to convince him?.

 Steered by Parrikar, the BJP government has survived several crises. The May 2004 election, which changed the ruling party in New Delhi, was expected to unsettle the BJP here. But so far, Parrikar has hung on.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Democracy drill debut with Africa

 SUJAN DUTTA

 New Delhi, Sept. 9: The embattled west African nation of Ivory Coast is the first country to which India will outsource democracy.

 The Election Commission of India will sign a memorandum of understanding with the Ivory Coast authorities tomorrow following which poll managers from India will advise the Ivorian government.

 Late last month, the poll panel signed an agreement with the UN electoral assistance division that is assisting elections in Iraq, Afghanistan and some 80 members of the world body. The deal with Ivory Coast is a first bilateral pact.

 Although commission sources said the MoU with Ivory Coast will be on ?mutual cooperation?, there is little, they privately admitted, that the Indian body is looking for from the African country where there have been six coups or attempted coups since 1999.

 India?s standing in the global polity of democracies is rated highly after successive and successful parliamentary polls. Nations torn by conflict expect to legitimise their own electoral processes by associating with the Indian poll panel.

 The last elections to the 225-member National Assembly in Ivory Coast in 2002 saw Laurent Gbagbo of the Ivorian Popular Front installed as President but it was followed by a coup attempt that was beaten down within hours but escalated into near civil war. The country now has a power-sharing arrangement for governance but participant political parties have withdrawn or are threatening to withdraw.

 The population of Ivory Coast, a former French colony, is about 17 million, a little more than that of Jammu and Kashmir, where polls were successfully concluded in 2002.

 The sources said the Election Commission had asked the government for ?certain clearances? before signing the MoU but the agreement will still be signed tomorrow even though its requests are pending. 

 In some respects, the MoU will reflect the terms of the agreement the Election Commission signed with the UN on August 28. Under that agreement with Carina Perelli, the head of the UN division who is overseeing elections in Iraq, the poll panel will offer logistical support to conduct and administer elections, send its personnel for advice and monitoring.

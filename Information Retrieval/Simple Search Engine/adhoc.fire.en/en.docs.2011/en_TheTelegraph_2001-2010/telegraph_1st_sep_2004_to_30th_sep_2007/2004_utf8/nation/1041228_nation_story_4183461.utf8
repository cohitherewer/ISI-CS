 Port Blair, Dec. 27: The massive waves have gone, but it has left this picturesque capital of the Andamans a shattered town.

 Though Car Nicobar has borne the brunt of the destruction, fear and shock has numbed Port Blair. Almost all markets are shut, there is no electricity and water is scarce. People have emerged on the streets, but all they talk of is how the giant waves lashed the town, taking five lives and razing buildings.

 People narrate how 13-year-old Joshdin was walking by the beach yesterday morning when he suddenly saw a huge wave about to crash on the beach. He turned and ran. Joshdin thought he had made it to safety when a tree uprooted by the wave hit him on the back ending his life instantly.

 In Corbyn?s Cove, 59-year-old Bharat Ram?s wife Sumita sobs and recounts how her husband?s morning walk was cut short by a wave that flung him 10 feet away and squeezed his life out. ?I could not imagine that he would not return home,? she said.

 The authorities said the waters had rushed about 6 km into the island, destroying houses and trees in its path. In Shadipur a building has collapsed, in Janglighat huts have been flattened and in Marina Park people go around collecting bit and pieces of their belongings strewn around the place. ?It took us totally by surprise,? said 24-year-old Lawrence. ?We are still looking for things washed away from our homes.?

 But since this morning, Shakil Ahmed has been making the rounds of the offices of the inspector-general of police and Union territory authorities not to ?look for things washed away?, but in search of his brother Fakir Ahmed who had travelled to Cachal island two days ago but has been missing since yesterday?s devastation.

 ?There is simply no trace of him,? Shakil said. ?I don?t know whether he is dead or alive or even if he is stranded somewhere and no one here can help me.?

 Faced with the enormity of the task and the unexpectedness of the tragedy, the Andamans authorities are struggling to cope with the situation and the unending requests and queries from residents and tourists alike.

 Pronab Das, who was in Havelock?s Dolphin Resort when the waves struck has managed to make his way back to Port Blair and is now doing the rounds to get a passage back to Calcutta. ?I saw the 15 feet high waves in Havelock and I have decided that I cannot stay here any longer.?

 Arnab Choudhury with his wife and two children have also decided to cut short their stay but are finding it difficult to find seats on the packed flights. ?There is no water here, no electricity and nothing left for us to do,? Arnab said. ?I am desperate to get back home.?

 Fishermen face fury

 JOHN MARY

 Thiruvananthapuram, Dec. 26: Nearly 200 people died and 600 were injured as tsunamis battered the 575-km Kerala shores. Several people were reported missing.

 Kayamkulam and Karunakagapally areas, nearly 100 km to the north of Thiruvananthapuram, reported 90 deaths. The toll in Kollam is 86 and in Alappuzha, 21.

 Director-general of police P.K. Hormese Tharakan has confirmed 87 deaths.

 The worst affected by the tremors, which were first felt in Kochi at 6.42 am, and the tsunamis were the fishing hamlets of Cheriyazheekal and Alappad in Karunagapally.

 Witnesses said tsunamis lashed the shores around 10 am, a couple of hours after people returned from church. 

 Hundreds of country craft and motorised vessels berthed on the beaches were caught in the ebb and tide. Bigger mechanised fishing vessels berthed inland broke loose and drifted seaward.

 The tide swelled the lakes and canals, partially submerging fuel stations and other commercial setups on the coast.

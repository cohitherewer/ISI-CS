 Terror cradle to school in a decade

 GAJINDER SINGH

 Bhindranwale

 Chowk Mehta (Punjab), Oct. 24: AK-47s have lost to Windows 2000 at Damdami Taksal, once feared as the headquarters of Khalistan.

 At the height of militancy in Punjab, the Sikh seminary that was the seat of Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale spelt terror. But in the past 10 years, it has reinvented itself.

 A higher secondary school has come up in the complex, so has a hospital. The school even has an astroturf ? the second in the region ? and it won the CBSE hockey championship this year without conceding a single goal, a feat the students proudly point out.

 The seminary continues as before to take in children and train them to be raagis (singers of hyms) and preachers. Bhindranwale, who once headed the seminary, still rules it. A mention of the militant ? killed in Operation Bluestar according to all records but ?alive? for the authorities here ? still sparks anger at the Union government. A picture of Indira Gandhi?s assassin Satwant Singh adorns a wall.

 But Taksal spokesperson and school in-charge Mokham Singh says: ?We believe in keeping pace with the world. While the seminary continues to occupy the prime position in the organisation, turning out raagis and preachers to serve the community worldwide, we have to ensure that quality education is imparted to those who come to study at the Khalsa Academy. It is time for a new focus after having taken on the government.?

 The change started about 10 years ago ? a decade after Operation Bluestar ? when Baba Thakar Singh, Bhindranwale?s successor who now lives mostly abroad, realised the need to expand the Taksal?s activities. The school and the hospital were then built.

 The school, affiliated to CBSE, now has more than 1,200 students and is equipped with a computer lab.

 Earlier, residents of Chowk Mehta had to go to Amritsar, which is less than an hour away, or Jalandhar for treatment. Now they have a 150-bed hospital at their doorstep.

 After the period in early eighties when Bhindranwale turned the Taksal into a breeding ground for militants, t he seminary has gone back to training preachers. Pointing to them, Mokham says: ?They will graduate to preach the word of God and sing hymns in his praise. God?s people do not seek anything in life.?

 Bhindranwale?s terror academy has embraced peace and progress.

 Pak scribes get J amp;K gate pass

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 27: India will allow 18 Pakistani journalists to visit Jammu and Kashmir and meet any leader they wish, even those belonging to various All Party Hurriyat Conference factions.

 The journalists, part of the South Asian Free Media Association which was set up recently to improve relations between the neighbours, arrive in the state on a five-day visit starting Sunday.

 Pakistanis have been allowed to visit Kashmir in the past, but this is the first time Delhi has allowed journalists from that country to visit the state and meet leaders to assess the situation for themselves.

 South Block officials said the decision was part of India?s bid to strengthen people-to-people contact between the two countries and hoped that Indian journalists would soon be allowed to visit Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir.

 An indication that a liberal visa regime for Pakistanis, especially its scribes, may be introduced was provided earlier this month when foreign minister K. Natwar Singh told a free media association meeting he had no problem in allowing journalists from across the border to visit any part of India. Singh?s Pakistani counterpart Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri was present at the meeting. The Indian establishment seems to be formalising Singh?s assurance. 

 With the United Progressive Alliance showing a more flexible and liberal attitude towards the existing visa regime, particularly towards Pakistanis, South Block?s attitude seems to be changing as well.

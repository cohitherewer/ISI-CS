 Pawar meet

 New Delhi, Sept. 18: The main constituents of the ruling Democratic Front government in Maharashtra ? the Congress and Nationalist Congress Party ? are working out a grand secular alliance to take on the Shiv Sena-BJP combine in the October 13 polls.

 Revisiting the front?s strategy, NCP chief Sharad Pawar met Congress president Sonia Gandhi at her 10 Janpath home tonight with a proposal to broaden their alliance by bringing in the CPM, CPI, the Peasants and Workers? Party, in addition to the four Republican Party of India factions.

 Also under consideration is a token representation for the Rashtriya Janata Dal and Lok Janshakti Party to make it a grand alliance. 

 Sources said if Sonia gives her nod, the four RPI factions, CPM, CPI and the Peasants and Workers? Party together might get around 23 seats.

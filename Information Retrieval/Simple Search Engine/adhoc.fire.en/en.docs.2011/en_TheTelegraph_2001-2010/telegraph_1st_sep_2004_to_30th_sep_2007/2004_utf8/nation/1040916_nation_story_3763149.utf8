 Palestine on Ahmed plate

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 E. Ahmed

 New Delhi, Sept. 15: Riding high on his success in resolving the recent hostage crisis, minister of state for external affairs Edappakath Ahmed has opted to become the first in the United Progressive Alliance government to reach out to Palestinians.

 The minister, who left for Qatar yesterday, reaches the Palestinian Authority, India?s traditional ally, on Friday for a three-day official trip.

 But in a departure from past practice, Ahmed will travel to Palestinian territories without visiting Israel. In recent years, especially when the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance government was in power, almost all high-level Indian visits included a trip to both areas.

 The UPA?s common minimum programme says: ?Traditional ties with West Asia will be given a fresh thrust. The UPA government reiterates India?s decades-old commitment to the cause of the Palestinian people for a homeland of their own.?

 Foreign minister K. Natwar Singh emphasised the new regime?s commitment to the Palestinian cause and his desire to rebuild Delhi?s traditional ties with the Arab and Muslim world. But he has not been able to fit in a visit to the region during the last four months.

 His cancellation of a trip three times in a row to Oman and the United Arab Emirates has disappointed those countries and many in the Islamic world.

 While Singh interacts with his European Union counterparts in Brussels, it has been left to his junior minister to visit the Palestinian Authority and initiate Delhi?s first official contact with it.

 During his visit, Ahmed will interact extensively with Yasser Arafat and senior Palestinian leaders. 

 He will also gift some vehicles and medicines, signalling the UPA government?s commitment to the Palestinian cause.

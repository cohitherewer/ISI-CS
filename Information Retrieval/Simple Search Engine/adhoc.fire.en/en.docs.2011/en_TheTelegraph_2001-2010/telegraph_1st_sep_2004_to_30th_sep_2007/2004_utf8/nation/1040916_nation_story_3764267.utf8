 Sonia picks more UP faults

 Sonia: Governance sermon

 Rae Bareli, Sept. 15: Sonia Gandhi today said politics has come in the way of development in Uttar Pradesh, in a veiled attack on the Mulayam Singh Yadav-led government that pushed the mercury up further in the volatile heartland.

 The Congress chief, who yesterday said law and order ?appeared to be bad? in the state, felt involvement of governments in political activities was responsible for stalling progress of states like Uttar Pradesh.

 ?When a political party comes to power and forms a government, it should confine its activities to development works only while the political organisation should carry on the affairs of the party. Unfortunately, governments these days indulge in politicking, wasting their precious time in power,? she said while inaugurating a new computer section at the Feroze Gandhi Polytechnic here. ?The development of Uttar Pradesh has come to a halt in the last few years because of this reason.?

 Sonia, whose party backs the state government from outside, did not name Mulayam Singh?s Samajwadi Party, but the insinuation was obvious. The Congress has been carrying on a campaign against the way the state government has been pampering minorities and releasing funds for projects in the chief minister?s constituency.

 Stung by the criticism, Mulayam Singh said the Congress appears to be desperate. ?It wants to grab power in Uttar Pradesh at any cost,? he said.

 In Delhi, minister of state for home Sriprakash Jaiswal echoed Sonia. Asked what he felt about the law and order situation in his home state, he said: ?It is weak from east to west. Hundreds of cases of kidnapping by small-time operators are going unreported. The state from Kanpur to Bundelkhand is affected.?

 Raja Bhaiyya plea

 In a legal spin-off to the political row between the Congress and the Uttar Pradesh government, the Centre today filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court challenging Mulayam Singh?s withdrawal of cases under the anti-terror act against his cabinet colleague Raja Bhaiyya.

 The home ministry said the state government ?has not sent to the Union ministry of home affairs any specific proposal for seeking prior permission of the central government for withdrawal of the cases?.

 Under Section 321 of the Criminal Procedure Code, a state government has to take the Centre?s permission before withdrawing any such case, it said.

 Soar becomes UK?s Ganges for funerals

 KARYN MILLER

London, Oct. 10: There are no temples or funeral 

pyres on its banks, but the River Soar in Leicestershire has been approved as 

an alternative holy site to India?s Ganges for Hindu funerals.

 After requests from the Asian community of over 250,000, the Environment Agency has approved ceremonies in which the ashes of dead Hindus and Sikhs are scattered across the water.

 A boat hire company has also been authorised to provide a customised service for the funerals, which are increasing in demand.

 This week, Shastriji Prakashbhai Pandya, a Hindu priest who officiates the ceremonies, claimed that the Soar was an acceptable alternative. ?When I close my eyes, this could be the Ganges,? he said. 

 The leap of imagination required to conjure up such a vision is large. 

 Flanked by fields, trees and a caravan park near the village of Barrow upon Soar, the river is a beauty spot where the only noise is the ducks. It is a sharp contrast from the muddy waters of the Ganges and the hubbub of Varanasi, one of the river?s sacred cities, where holy men bathe at dawn and corpses smoulder on the banks.

 Despite such differences, Pandya, who officiated at Ganges ceremonies before coming to Leicestershire, said that ceremonies on the Soar were becoming popular.

 ?Often it is difficult for people to go to India to scatter the ashes,? he said. ?It is expensive, and older family members may not be able to travel. That is one reason why people are coming here.

 ?The second reason is, the Soar is greener than the Ganges, and the scenery is better. Unlike the Ganges, it is quiet here, and the water is clean and clear. Instead of people living along on the riverbanks, there are ducks.?

 Ceremonies take place on a secluded river bend between the villages of Barrow upon Soar and Mountsorrel, where the river Soar meets the river Wreake. 

 Narrow boats are hired for ?55 a time, and boarded by close family members. The ashes are scattered, along with flowers, powder and tulsi leaves.

 Frank Reeves, the owner of Barrow Boating, which provides the boats, said he had taken two bookings a week since May, and that the number was rising.

 He said: ?It can be quite a spectacle. We?ve had bells and chanting. The British weather isn?t a problem. Apparently, if it starts raining immediately after the ceremony, that means good luck.?

 In keeping with tradition, the river Soar has been anointed with water from the Ganges, to make it a credible substitute for the holy river. A spokesman for the Environment Agency said ceremonies on the Soar had been authorised. 

 ?We have designated a secluded place on the river so that ashes are disposed of with due consideration for other river users. We have forbidden offerings such as photographs and metal and plastic items, which could litter the river bank.

 ?Our officers analyse the water from the Soar on a monthly basis, but have never found anything amiss.?

 Last weekend Harish Raithatha, 44, from Leicester, went on the Soar with 12 family members to scatter the ashes of his late father.

 ?Because of the place, and because we were doing something holy, we felt very peaceful and relaxed. It was more like a nice day out, than a sad time. When I scattered the ashes over the side, everyone held onto me and we chanted Krishna?s name.?

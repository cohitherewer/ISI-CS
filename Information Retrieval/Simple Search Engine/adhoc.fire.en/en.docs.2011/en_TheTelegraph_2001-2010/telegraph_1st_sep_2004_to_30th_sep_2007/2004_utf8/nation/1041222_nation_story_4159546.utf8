 Shaken Laloo steps back

 ASHISH SINHA

 Patna, Dec. 21: Rashtriya Janata Dal workers were unable to decide whether it was victory or defeat, but Laloo Prasad Yadav shocked them this morning by announcing that the December 23 rally at Gandhi Maidan was being ?postponed?, though all preparations have been made.

 The RJD chief would not admit that he took the extreme step under ?pressure? from the Election Commission. Instead, he claimed that he put off the mega show because of a ?conspiracy? hatched by his opponents, mainly the BJP.

 The argument was hard to buy because Laloo Prasad is not known to succumb to pressures mounted by his political opponents ? whether these relate to the fodder scam cases or to the recent demand for the resignation of ?tainted? Union ministers.

 The next moment he gave in. ?I did not want to embarrass the Election Commission as I have all respect for constitutional bodies like it. The model code of conduct became effective on December 17. The RJD considers it necessary to obey the directives of constitutional bodies. After consultations with my comrades (in the party), therefore, I have decided to postpone the rally,? the railway minister said.

 RJD sources said a meeting was on at chief minister Rabri Devi?s residence from late in the night to early today. ?Calls were made to the election commissioner but the poll panel refused to grant any concession,? a source added.

 An FIR was lodged against Laloo Prasad yesterday, on the directions of the Election Commission, for ?bribing? people, allegedly to seek their votes at Bihta on the outskirts of Patna. A showcause notice on de-recognising the RJD added to the party?s worries. By late evening, the district administration had started pulling down RJD billboards and welcome gates in the city, which had been put up in violation of the model code of conduct.

 The final cut came when the poll panel issued a stern directive on not disturbing regular train traffic on December 22-23, in the wake of the RJD booking 18 special trains for bringing supporters for the Mazdoor Kisan Maha Raila to Patna from different parts of Bihar and Jharkhand. The ?pressure?, RJD sources conceded, was immense.

 Laloo Prasad explained the word ?postpone? with two references. First, a ?virat vijay utsav? (massive victory festival) would be organised in Patna on February 28 ?after the RJD returns to power with an absolute majority?. Second, the party and he would now go for ?seedha samvad? (direct appeal) from December 23.

 The RJD chief, wrapped up in heavy woollens, looked restrained and glum this morning. He read out a terse statement explaining the ?special circumstances? that compelled him to call off the rally. ?We know that the decision will pain lakhs of our supporters who worked round the clock.... But this will change the nature of the election campaign. The responsibilities of our workers have increased manifold now,? Laloo Prasad said.

 IIT plans to roll out two-in-one course

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Kharagpur, Nov. 26: A dual degree programme combining engineering and management, a tailor-made course for defence services personnel, more seats in the full-time management course and a thrust on executive education ? it is time to roll out new initiatives at the Vinod Gupta School of Management. 

 Riding on a $2-million grant from Vinod Gupta, an illustrious alumnus of the country?s oldest Indian Institute of Technology at Kharagpur, the 11-year-old B-school on the institute?s campus is drawing up ambitious expansion plans. 

 ?At this institute, we want to remain on the cutting edge and be the mavericks. We think the other IITs will also start offering such programmes,? said Gupta, who was in Kharagpur today to inaugurate an extension building. 

 The institute has around 180 students and the authorities want to increase the strength to 300 by 2005, which is also the deadline for launching the five-year dual degree programme combining B.Tech and a masters degree in business management and the two-year course for those in the armed services. 

 ?Such dual degree programmes are available in universities in the US, which really help the students,? said Gupta, who also interacted with students of the institute. 

 For the agricultural engineering student from the class of 1967, the institute played a very important role. Gupta, who started in a modest setting in Rampur, a small village in Uttar Pradesh, today heads the $400-million InfoUSA ? a Nasdaq-listed database company. He is one of the richest Indians in America and a close friend of former US President Bill Clinton. 

 ?Gupta has always been generous to the IIT and he has also helped us in conceiving the programmes. Every year he takes some of our students as interns in his company, which gives them huge international exposure,? said Kalyan Chakravarti, dean of the school. According to him, Gupta, who has donated over $5 million to IIT Kharagpur in the past 10 years, has been a constant source of support to the institute. 

 Not just the alma mater, Gupta extended his generosity to the grassroots as well. To facilitate the upliftment of people in his village, Gupta had set up a polytechnic institute in Rampur and rolled out a number of social development programmes. Now, he is working hard to give shape to his dream project in his village.

 ?These days, only students from urban India can get into the IITs because the rural boys and girls cannot afford the best of education. We are setting up a centre by spending around $1 million in the village to prepare around 600 students for the various entrance tests. I wish NRIs doing well for themselves would adopt at least one village each and am confident that it can change our country,? summed up Gupta.

 Kashmir agenda for Round II

 Islamabad, Nov. 29 (PTI): Foreign secretaries of India and Pakistan are scheduled to hold talks on Kashmir during their second round of the composite dialogue process to be held here on December 23 and 24.

 Pakistan has accepted the dates suggested by India, Pakistan foreign office spokesperson Masood Khan said today.

 The second round will be held in Islamabad as the first round was conducted in Delhi. Talks will be held on other issues, including Siachen, Wullar barrage, Sir Creek, terrorism and drug trafficking, economic and commercial cooperation, and promotion of friendly exchange in various fields.

 Khan said he hoped this round would be fruitful. ?Talks are continuing. We are yet to achieve a breakthrough but we have a productive engagement to understand each other?s perspective as the talks are being held after several years. That is why we are going to hold composite dialogue on all eight agenda items.?

 He said talks of the narcotics control bodies and a meeting of a panel of experts on trade issues have been postponed.

 Talks between the railway authorities on the Munabao-Khokhrapar link will, however, be held in Islamabad on December 2 and 3, followed by a meeting of coast guard officials in Delhi. The Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus service will be discussed on December 7 and 8 in Delhi. Expert-level talks on nuclear and conventional confidence-building measures will be held in Delhi and a joint survey of boundary pillars in Sir Creek will be carried out in Karachi in mid-December.

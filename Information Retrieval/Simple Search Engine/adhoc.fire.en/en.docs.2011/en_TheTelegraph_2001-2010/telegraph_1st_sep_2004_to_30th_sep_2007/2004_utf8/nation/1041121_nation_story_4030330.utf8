 Left mulls top order changes

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 20: The CPM and CPI have lined up leadership changes at their party congresses next March.

 CPM general secretary Harkishen Singh Surjeet is to step down and will probably be succeeded by Prakash Karat. 

 Surjeet?s CPI counterpart A.B. Bardhan will continue as general secretary for another term, but a new deputy general secretary?s post will be created.

 Andhra Pradesh CPI leader Sudhakar Reddy is the most likely candidate for the new post which will provide him a national profile and experience in Delhi politics. He will need both if he succeeds Bardhan sometime later.

 Surjeet?s retirement as general secretary was in the offing at the last party congress three years ago. But the veteran Communist leader ? an old hand at backroom coalition politics ? continued because of the political situation at the time.

 The CPM believed Surjeet could ? as he has done in the past ? help bring together disparate forces and forge a broad alliance with the Congress to help oust the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led National Democratic Alliance government.

 But Surjeet?s health is failing and it is clear he will make way for a younger man at the next congress. 

 Surjeet has moved away from the media glare of late, with Karat and Sitaram Yechury addressing news conferences.

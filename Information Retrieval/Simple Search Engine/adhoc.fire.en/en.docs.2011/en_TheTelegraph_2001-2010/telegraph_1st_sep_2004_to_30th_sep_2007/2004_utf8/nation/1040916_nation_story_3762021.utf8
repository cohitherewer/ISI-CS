 Walk ends in arrest drama

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Vaiko

Chennai, Sept. 15: MDMK chief Vaiko?s 42-day padayatra concluded today with a dramatic arrest and release on the final leg of the march in the city.

 Vaiko and six others who courted arrest around 5 this morning near Anna Square were let off at 12.20 pm after Chintadripet police filed an FIR against them for ?disobeying? a government servant?s order and unlawful assembly.

 Dubbing his arrest ?illegal?, the MDMK chief said: ?Walking in files of three and that, too, in parts on a roadside track will not come under the definition of a procession.?

 His release was welcomed by party workers with a burst of crackers.

 The drama began unfolding late last night when Vaiko was resting at St Thomas Mount on the city?s outskirts after a rally.

 Around 11.45 pm, the Chengalpattu East police superintendent informed him that the marchers could not walk through the city ?in a procession?. The Supreme Court had banned processions on busy roads and highways.

 Vaiko rejected the order that was ?orally served? and an offer to arrange ?buses? from Kathipara junction to ferry the ?padayatris? to the rally venue near Marina Beach.

 The MDMK chief and fellow marchers advanced the last lap of the walkathon from the scheduled 10 am and hit the road at 1.15 am, taking the police by surprise.

 ?I did not want to give room for any sort of disturbance as we could be later blamed for violence triggered by hoodlums,? Vaiko said, explaining the shift.

 ?It was the dead of night, there was hardly any traffic and the city police had been taken into confidence earlier on our city route,? he added.

 The marchers ignored a protesting police official at Kathipara junction.

 Vaiko, his dhoti hitched up, led the way and walked briskly into the city ?just to prove a point to Amma?. Chief minister Jayalalithaa had issued a statement last night saying any violation of prohibitory order would invite legal action.

 Once in the city, the MDMK chief and his party cadre refused to ?cooperate? with the police and squatted on the beach road close to the memorial of Annadurai, the Dravidian leader whose birth anniversary was today.

 ?Is it a Hitler raj out there?? Vaiko shouted during a heated argument with the police, who at one stage threatened to ?use force?. Vaiko finally relented after most of the 3,000 party workers were allowed to walk quietly to the culminating point of the padayatra at Island Grounds, where he addressed a rally tonight.

 After his release, the MDMK chief said jubilantly: ?I said we will complete our padayatra and we have completed it.?

 The 1,025-km Marumalarchi Payanam (renaissance march) had commenced in Tirunelveli on August 5 following Vaiko?s bail from Vellore jail, where he had been detained under the anti-terror law.

 The second march of the leader?s political career was aimed at strengthening the party machinery, highlighting the plight of farmers and youth, and urging people to eschew caste and communal violence.

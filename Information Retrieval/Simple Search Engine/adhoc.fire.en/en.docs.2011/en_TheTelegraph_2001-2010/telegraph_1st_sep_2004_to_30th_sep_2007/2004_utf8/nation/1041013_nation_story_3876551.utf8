The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Peasant party quiet

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Alibagh, Oct. 12: The Peasants and Workers Party is coastal Maharashtra?s version of the BSP: it has a committed base; had ideological moorings, which got fuzzier with every passing election; is capable of tilting the power scales and keeping the major players guessing on its options if there is a hung Assembly.

 But the PWP is confined to the seven Assembly constituencies of Raigad district. 

 Speaking of ?principles? in his office here, PWP chief Jayant Patil said: ?We left the Democratic Front government because it wanted to bring in Enron.... (then chief minister Vilasrao) Deshmukh was ready to make all our MLAs ministers but we refused.? 

 On the course the party would take if there is a hung House, he said: ?The Congress and NCP have no qualms about taking the BJP-Sena?s support to defeat us. Are we alone supposed to be principled??

 Left piles PSU heat

 Bardhan: Guarantee cry

 New Delhi, Oct. 25: The Left wants the Centre to become the long-term guarantor of central public sector undertakings in the red. 

 The government has said the enterprises must learn to be self-sufficient after receiving the initial financial assistance.

 According to the Left parties, a mere revival package is not enough to keep the units going for a long time. The cabinet recently sanctioned a Rs 500-crore revival package for the 24 central units.

 CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan has written to minister of state for heavy industries Santosh Mohan Deb, asking him about the government?s long-term plans for the 24 units that have received financial assistance.

 Deb, however, has made it clear that the government cannot be permanently responsible for the ailing enterprises. It is up to the units? managements to make the best of the assistance and become self-sufficient, the minister stressed.

 The Left parties are slated to meet in the next couple of days to decide the agenda for the next UPA-Left co-ordination committee meeting. ?We are going to discuss PSUs, our response to the government?s note on FDI in telecom and a review of the 2004 electricity act,? said Bardhan. 

 There, however, seems to be a difference in the government?s and the Left?s perceptions on the handling of sick PSUs. Deb had pointed this out in an earlier letter to Bardhan.

 ?It has been impressed upon the managements (of the 24 units) that such assistance from the government cannot become a regular feature and the company will have to embark upon a comprehensive financial, operational, technological and organisational restructuring to put the PSUs on sustainable revival,? Deb had written.

 Of the 48 PSUs under the heavy industries ministry, 24 are unable to pay salaries, wages and statutory dues. The government is expected to soon set up a board for restructuring PSUs ? one of the chief demands of the Left.

 The sanctioning of Rs 500 crore, Deb had written, is ?a prelude to deliberations before the proposed board?.

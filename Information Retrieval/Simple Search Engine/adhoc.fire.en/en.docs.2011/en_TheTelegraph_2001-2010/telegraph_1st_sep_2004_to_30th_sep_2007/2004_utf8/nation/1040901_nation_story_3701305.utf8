 Cop crossfire in riot panel

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Ahmedabad, Aug. 31: A top cop today contradicted a former senior officer when he said the Gujarat intelligence bureau had information about the return journey of kar sevaks from Ayodhya on February 26, 2002.

 On February 27, coaches of the Sabarmati Express carrying kar sevaks were set on fire at Godhra.

 Deposing before the two-member commission probing the Gujarat riots, additional director-general of police R.B. Sreekumar also claimed to have forewarned the authorities about possible attacks on religious and cultural places. The warning, he said, was conveyed about a week after he took over as state intelligence chief on April 9, 2002.

 Former DGP K. Chakravarthy had recently told the panel that Gujarat police did not have information about the kar sevaks return journey.

 Sreekumar revealed that he had verbally warned about the Akshardham temple in Gandhinagar becoming a target but immediately retracted, saying he had not named a specific temple. Akshardham was attacked on September 24, 2002. He said he feared attacks because of inputs from his field officers who told him that victims in riot-relief camps were seething with anger.

 The situation was aggravated because lower-ranked police officers were not properly recording FIRs and those named were not being arrested, the officer now in charge of police reforms and modernisation told the panel. 

 Sreekumar alleged that he found police officers helpless as leaders in power were interfering in their work.

 Though I know their names, I cannot disclose them as it will harm the interests of those officers and intelligence sources who told me, Sreekumar said.

 The officer told the panel that he had sent a report, suggesting measures to restore the minority communitys faith. Sreekumar said he met Narendra Modi, too, but the government took action on the report only after K.P.S. Gill became adviser to the chief minister in May 2002.

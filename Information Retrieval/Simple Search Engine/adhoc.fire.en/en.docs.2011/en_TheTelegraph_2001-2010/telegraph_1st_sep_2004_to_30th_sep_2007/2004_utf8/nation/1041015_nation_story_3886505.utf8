 Couple?s custody plea rejected

 Amritsar (PTI): A court here on Thursday 

 rejected an application of a couple seeking custody of a 

 four-year-old boy who was allegedly swapped. The couple 

 claimed to be his biological parents on the basis of a DNA 

 report.

 Chief judicial magistrate Harpreet Kaur Randhawa rejected the plea by Manju and Harish of Amritsar seeking custody of Amarpartap Singh, being brought up by Sukhwinder Singh and Ranjit Kaur of Rapur village. The court also asked the doctor from Hyderabad who gave the DNA report to appear in the court on October 21.

 The petitioners maintained that the child should be immediately handed over to them as the boy was ?abducted? and subsequently sold to the couple from Rapur. Manju had given birth to a child in a private nursing home on July 1, 2000. She fell unconscious during delivery and was told she had delivered a baby girl. That swapped child, Muskan, is being brought up by the couple.

 The petitioners? lawyer said the detailed order of the court was yet to be made available.

 Earlier, the prosecution counsel had argued that as the DNA report had ?established? Amarpartap was born to Harish and Manju, the child should be handed over to his biological parents. The defence counsel, however, reasoned that Sukhwinder and Ranjit had brought up the child so he could not be separated from him.

 Heat on Indian-origin minister

 Kuala Lumpur (AP): Malaysia?s top Indian-origin 

 politician is facing demands for his resignation as works 

 minister after a string of infrastructure debacles.

 Samy Vellu, Malaysia?s longest-serving cabinet minister, was lambasted in Parliament by politicians who urged him on Wednesday to accept responsibility for breakdowns in road and highway projects that they said could cause deaths and mar the government?s image.

 The works ministry has come under criticism recently over problems such as cracks in a Kuala Lumpur road project and delays in building constructions.

 ?The cause of all these problems we face is the minister,? Suhaili Abdul Rahman, a ruling coalition legislator, was quoted as saying by a newspaper. ?If it is time to go, one must go,? said Lim Kit Siang, the Opposition leader in the country?s Parliament.

 Samy, 68, is president of the Malaysian Indian Congress, the main party representing the country?s ethnic Indian minority in the 13-party ruling coalition. He has served as a cabinet minister since 1979. He did not immediately respond to the calls for his resignation.

 Nisha Sharma case notice

 New Delhi : Delhi High Court on Thursday 

 issued notices to Delhi police and the Delhi government 

 asking them to file their replies in a defamation suit regarding

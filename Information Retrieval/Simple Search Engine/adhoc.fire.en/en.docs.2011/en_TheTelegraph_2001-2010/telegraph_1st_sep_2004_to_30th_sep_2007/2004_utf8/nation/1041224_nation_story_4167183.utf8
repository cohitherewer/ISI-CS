 Rebels in third rail strike

 OUR CORRESPONDENT AND AGENCIES

 Gaya, Dec. 23: In yet another attack on rail property, suspected Naxalites blew up a portion of a track near the eastern cabin of Gurpa station in the Dhanbad division, about 40 km from here, early today. 

 The incident took place around 1.15 am, minutes after the Patna bound Hatia-Patna Express passed, railway sources said. Heavily armed CPI (Maoist) activists targeted the Down line near the station and blew up a 1.5-mt stretch by detonating dynamite and bombs, the sources added.

 Rail traffic on the Gaya-Dhanbad route was disrupted following the attack. Important trains like the New Delhi-Howrah and New Delhi-Sealdah Rajdhani Express and Poorva Express were stranded for several hours. 

 Traffic on the Up track was restored later in the morning and the Down track was opened around noon after repairs. 

 Though the Naxalites did not leave behind any literature this time, it was suspected that today?s attack ? the third this week ? was in retaliation to the Bihar government?s decision to cancel a rally on December 5.

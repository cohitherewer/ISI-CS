 Karachi, Dec. 11: They 

 have the same surname and both are famous. Today, one Khan 

 lauded the other for his ?noble? efforts.

 Bollywood actor Aamir Khan, who is in Pakistan, will reach Karachi tomorrow to participate in the special fundraiser for the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Hospital, a project launched by cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan almost a decade ago to provide free treatment to cancer patients.

 ?He will always find us forthcoming in his noble endeavours,? said Aamir, who arrived in Lahore yesterday to a rapturous welcome.

 Aamir said he was ?very happy? to be in Pakistan. ?My mother belonged to Karachi and half of my mother?s family still lives in this city,? he said, recalling a recent family reunion when his maternal grandfather, who lives in Karachi, visited Mumbai to see his daughter after 20 years.

 The actor, who has a loyal fan following in Pakistan, said the people here are loving and friendly. ?And this is something which has made my stay in this country memorable.?

 Along with Aamir, a few actors of the blockbuster Lagaan, which had been nominated for an Oscar, are also visiting Pakistan to take part in the fundraiser.

 The suave actor, whom many failed to recognise at first sight because of the long hair and big moustache he has grown as part of the make-up for another movie, said: ?Film is a comprehensive and powerful medium which overshadows almost all the other forms of art. Therefore, I request the people in power and authority in both the countries to encourage media entertainment.?

 ?Entertainment,? he added, ?was one forum where borders and boundaries do not matter.?

 Aamir said he ?strongly? believed that that ?co-production? by Pakistani and Indian producers would be ?beneficial for the two countries as well as their people? and added that if offered a good role in a Pakistani movie, he would certainly go for it.

 To questions about anti-Pakistan movies in India, he said personally he would not act in any film which could create hatred against any country.

 Asked who was the superstar of the Hindi film industry, Aamir said he has heard Shah Rukh Khan call himself the ?baadshah? of Bollywood. ?Well, if he is baadshah (king), then I am ikka (ace),? he joked.

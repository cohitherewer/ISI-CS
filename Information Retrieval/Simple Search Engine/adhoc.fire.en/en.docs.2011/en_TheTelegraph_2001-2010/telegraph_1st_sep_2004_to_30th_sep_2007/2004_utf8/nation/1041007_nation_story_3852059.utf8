 Bhopal, Oct. 6: Babulal Gaur is busy juggling different hats ? ranging from the austere to the extravagant.

 The Madhya Pradesh chief minister yesterday announced a series of measures ? a blanket ban on feasts and foreign junkets, restrictions on phone and travel allowances and cancellation of government employees? leave travel allowance till March 2005.

 However, within hours of the declaration, Gaur received a list of 33 names, mostly those of bureaucrats, seeking his approval to visit the Sharjah Ramdhan Festival. He cleared the junket in the name of promoting trade and handicrafts. 

 The chief minister is also giving final touches to an administrative order according the rank of minister of state to poet Bashir Badr, the state Urdu academy chief. 

 Three others ? Khuram Shamiri, Shakil Raza and Sultan Abdul Aziz belonging to minority-related commissions and corporations ? are also tipped to be rewarded for supporting the BJP during the Assembly and Lok Sabha polls. 

 Gaur, however, did not reveal any names, only saying that minority representation was important as it is missing in the state council.

 With these appointments, the number of people holding ministerial rank in Gaur?s government will go up to 42, the highest in the country. According to the law, the state?s ministry size is capped at 35.

 Addressing a news conference in Bhopal today, Gaur justified the proposed appointments, saying that they were not ?illegal.? 

 He also admitted to approving 33 names for the Sharjah festival. ?I am examining the matter and exploring if some of the names can be deleted,? he said, adding that he is also an invitee. ?I will go under one condition ? if my expenses are borne by the hosts.? 

 Left to him, the chief minister added, only eight to 10 officials would be allowed to accompany artisans to Sharjah.

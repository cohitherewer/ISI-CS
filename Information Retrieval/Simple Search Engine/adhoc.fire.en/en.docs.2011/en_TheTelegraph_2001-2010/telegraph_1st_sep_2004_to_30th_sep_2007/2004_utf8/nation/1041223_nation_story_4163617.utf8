 Richard?s Gandhi for Salman?s Congress

 - Attenborough film screening for partymen

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Rohini Hattangadi and Ben Kingsley in Gandhi

 Lucknow, Dec. 22: Mahatma 

 Gandhi had on the eve of one of his visits to Varanasi in 

 1920 instructed Congress workers to eat only vegetarian 

 food for a week, then observe two days? fast before launching 

 on a peaceful protest.

 Gandhi felt this would psychologically prepare the workers for true satyagraha, his new non-violent form of protest against British rule, which, historians say, led to the rise of the Congress in the Uttar Pradesh region between 1920 and 1941.

 Now, 84 years later, the party is banking on the Mahatma for a similar rejuvenation in its former stronghold. Richard Attenborough?s Gandhi will be screened tomorrow at the state Congress headquarters here as a first step.

 ?The show will start at 4 pm and all important party functionaries have been invited,? spokesperson Akhilesh Singh said.

 The screening is the brainwave of new state Congress chief Salman Khursheed, who believes the film would inspire a new generation of leaders regarding satyagraha as a form of protest against an ?anti-people? ruler ? in this instance the Samajwadi Party government.

 The party workers have been asked to keenly follow Ben Kingsley?s Oscar-winning performance as Gandhi in the 1982 biopic despite controversy on the film?s research. State Congress leaders, however, say Gandhi ? which won eight Oscars ? is a near perfect reproduction of the Mahatma?s life.

 A brief introduction by Khursheed and AICC in-charge of state affairs Satyavrat Chaturvedi will precede the screening.

 Khursheed had faced infighting and the problem of reorienting party workers low on morale after recently taking over from Jagdambika Pal.

 ?The morale has been low. I believe if the party workers wanted to take up the challenge of bringing change in the state, they would be able to do so but they lack the will power,? he said.

 So he shuffled the functionaries a bit and launched a campaign against the Mulayam Singh Yadav government. ?Rust had settled on the organisation. I merely tried to remove the rust,? Khursheed said.

 The inspiration for the screening is learnt to have come from Rahul Gandhi, the first-time Congress MP from Amethi.

 Rahul wanted to visit the state headquarters for the first time next month and had asked Khursheed to prepare workers for ?value-added politics? with inspiration from the Mahatma.

 But the screening has not enthused all of them, especially those who were cornered in the Khursheed revamp. ?I don?t know about the show and I have not been invited,? said Siraj Mehendi, a member of the state legislative council.

 Some others felt a theoretical, academic exercise would not take the party anywhere.

 Farewell to a traffic-stopper

 New Delhi, Sept. 19: What 

 began as a ?departure from tradition? two months ago has 

 now been established as a citizen-friendly convention.

 Manmohan Singh today again gave a quiet burial to the ritual of the Prime Minister being seen off at the airport by cabinet colleagues and top officials when he left for New York, sending a wave of relief among commuters who have often been at the receiving end of roads blocked at will for VVIP movement.

 Replaying the new convention that debuted when he went to Bangkok on his first visit abroad as Prime Minister, Singh this afternoon received all who wanted to bid farewell, including Sonia Gandhi and the three service chiefs, at Panchvati Hall inside the 7 Race Course Road complex.

 By 1.30 pm, Sonia, Union ministers Pranab Mukherjee, Shivraj Patil, Arjun Singh, Ghulam Nabi Azad, Ram Vilas Paswan, K. Chandrasekhar Rao and several others had lined up in the hall to see the Prime Minister off.

 Later, Singh took a helicopter ride from Safdarjung airport, located near the Prime Minister?s Race Course Road residence, to the Indira Gandhi International Airport technical area, 15 km away, from where the special Air-India plane took off. 

 There was no prolonged closure of roads for VVIP traffic along the main roads and intersections leading to the international airport and no mid-day harassment of motorists.

 Some VVIPs, too, were relieved. ?Earlier, seeing off the Prime Minister meant spending more than two hours. Today, it was all over in less than 30 minutes,? said a senior minister who could wait till 1.20 pm before leaving for the Prime Minister?s official residence.

 Singh?s preference for low-profile send-offs could permanently end the elaborate convention of seeing off/receiving VVIPs at the IGI airport. Almost two decades ago, the then Rajiv Gandhi government had dispensed with the convention of extending ceremonial welcome and farewell to visiting heads of state/government at the IGI airport.

 Instead, the ceremony was shifted to the Rashtrapati Bhavan forecourt. An exception was made when Rajiv chose to receive the then Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev at the IGI airport. 

 Among those accompanying Singh on the foreign tour that has a day?s stopover at London are foreign minister K. Natwar Singh, deputy chairman of the planning commission Montek Singh Ahluwalia and national security adviser J.. Dixit. 

 The Prime Minister is scheduled to meet President George W. Bush. Before his departure, Singh said his message to Bush during their meeting would be that the UPA government was ?determined to carry forward the process of economic reforms which will increase opportunities for greater economic interaction?.

 ?Both our countries are determined to endow our vital relationship with greater content, particularly in economic and high-technology fields,? he added.

 Apang to be chief minister

 Itanagar, Oct. 13: A veteran of many a political battle, Gegong Apang today emerged unscathed from another with the Arunachal Pradesh Congress Legislature Party unanimously electing him as its leader despite opposition from those loyal to PCC chief and former chief minister Mukut Mithi, reports our correspondent.

 What made the victory sweeter for Apang was Mithi proposing his name for the post of CLP leader. 

 Immediately after the meeting, Apang and Mithi met governor V.C. Pande and staked claim to form the next government. 

 The new government will be sworn in on Saturday.

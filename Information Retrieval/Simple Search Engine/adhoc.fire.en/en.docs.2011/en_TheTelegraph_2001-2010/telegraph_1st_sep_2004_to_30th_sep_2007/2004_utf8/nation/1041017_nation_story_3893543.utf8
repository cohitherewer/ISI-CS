 Breather for couple

 GAJINDER SINGH 

 Chandigarh, Oct. 16: The voice of angry defiance now has a ring of assurance.

 As police began patrolling Asanda and the village council cancelled a meeting to decide whether Sonia and Rampal could remain husband and wife, the pregnant young woman breathed easier after seven days of torment.

 ?Mujhe maksad mil gaya hai khofnaak khyalaton se ladne ka (It has given me the willpower to continue my fight against evil social customs),? she said from her hospital bed in Rohtak after Punjab and Haryana High Court yesterday asked the panchayat to stop interfering in the couple?s marital life.

 Following the order, the panchayat cancelled its October 24 meeting that was to have decided whether the two would have to accept each other as siblings to honour caste restrictions or could remain married.

 ?I welcome the decision. It has lessened my agony. I now just want to get well and leave for the village that has been my home since I got married,? Sonia, who is recovering from pregnancy-related complications, said.

 The panchayat had on October 10 ordered Rampal and Sonia to dissolve their 18-month-old love marriage as their gotra (sub-caste) ? Dahiya and Rathee ? descended from a common forefather and unions between them were socially unacceptable.

 Dharam Singh, who chaired the panchayat meeting in Asanda, Jhajjar, near Delhi, said the high court?s intervention had forced them to cancel next week?s sitting. ?But it will definitely be held. This case has to come to a logical conclusion. We will take the matter up again after the case comes to an end in the court,? he said.

 ?In court, an accused is let off if he can produce proof that he is innocent. We want Sonia to prove that she belongs to the Hooda gotra. If she can, she will become the daughter-in-law of the village. If she can?t, she will still be treated as a daughter. Her marriage will remain the only problem. We are only following customs that have been there for centuries.?

 After last Sunday?s decree, Sonia and her family claimed she was a Hooda and her marriage with Rampal was valid as there was no bar on unions between a Dahiya and a Hooda.

 On the growing tension in the village and surrounding hamlets, Singh said it was the duty of the police, not the panchayat, to maintain law and order. But he appealed for peace.

 The Jhajjar district administration, which had earlier refused to intervene saying it was a social problem, has deputed Bahadurgarh DSP Rajender Singh to oversee security in the village and ensure that Rampal or his family members are not harmed. The police will also keep a watch on the movements of villagers once Sonia is released from hospital. A police vehicle with six members and a motorcycle squad have been deployed for round-the-clock vigil.

 Doctors, meanwhile, remained worried by Sonia?s condition and have advised complete rest. The authorities have also begun regulating visits as her condition deteriorated on Thursday after the media descended on the hospital. She is expected to remain in hospital for another 10 days.

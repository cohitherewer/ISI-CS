 Dumped 15 years ago, justice now

 New Delhi, Nov. 7 (PTI): The Supreme Court has directed a man to pay a woman Rs 50,000 in damages, 15 years after he breached repeated promises to marry her though she was pregnant from the relationship.

 The woman would be immediately paid Rs 10,000, while the rest of the amount would be kept in a fixed deposit in the name of the child born from the relationship, a bench said in a recent judgment.

 Deelip Singh was convicted and sentenced to 10 years? imprisonment by a Bihar trial court on charges of raping the woman, who was then a minor and consent for sexual relations was obtained by means of false promises of marriage. Patna High Court affirmed the trial court?s order.

 The woman, who is now married, delivered a child from her relationship with Singh.

 After examining the trial court records and the statement of the woman, the apex court said though the accused wanted to marry her, elders of the village forced him not to do so as she belonged to a different caste. The bench said the facts and the statement of the woman indicated that Singh might have had a genuine intention to marry, but could not because of the pressure exerted by the elders.

 ?It seems to be a case of breach of promise to marry rather than a case of false promise to marry,? the bench said while acquitting Singh. But it did not lose sight of Singh?s reprehensible conduct of persuading her to have physical relations on the promise of marriage.

 Though the man has extricated himself from the clutches of penal law, his act left behind a trail of misery, ignominy and trauma for the woman, the apex court said, and added ?the only solace is that she married subsequently?. The girl born to the woman from the illicit relationship is now 14.

 ?Though there is no evidence to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant made a fraudulent promise to marry, there can be no denial of the fact that the appellant did commit breach of the promise to marry, for which he is prima facie accountable for damages under civil law,? Justice P.V. Reddi, writing for the bench, said.

 Singh said he was prepared to pay Rs 50,000 by way of compensation irrespective of his acquittal. 

 The court said: ?Though the said amount is not an adequate compensation, we are not inclined to call upon the appellant to pay more for more than one reason: first, the appellant has been in jail for about two years now; second, he belonged to a backward class and his family is not affluent; last, the incident took place about 15 years back and in the meantime, both the prosecutrix and the appellant married. In these circumstances, we accept the offer of the appellant.?

 The bench said the draft for the compensation amount, deposited by Singh in the Supreme Court, be handed over to the magistrate of the area where the woman now lives.

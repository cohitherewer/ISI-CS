 Poll-bound Congress gets Laloo jitters

 K. SUBRAHMANYA

 New Delhi, Nov. 4: The Congress is groping in the dark over an election strategy for Bihar even though it has worked out tactics for Opposition-ruled Jharkhand and Haryana which also head to the polls early next year.

 All that AICC functionaries are clear about is that the party will have to join forces with Laloo Prasad Yadav?s Rashtriya Janata Dal since they are partners in ruling coalitions at Bihar and at the Centre.

 AICC functionaries and Bihar Congress leaders alike are wary of Laloo Prasad again treating the party as a fringe player when tickets are allotted for the Assembly elections.

 ?We definitely have a much stronger presence in the state than what the seat-sharing for the Lok Sabha polls five months ago indicated. The RJD just gave us four of the 40 Lok Sabha seats. This meagre proportion of seats would surely not be acceptable for the Assembly polls,? a party functionary said.

 But the problem is that neither the functionaries nor Bihar Congress leaders have any idea how the high command intends to approach election negotiations with Laloo Prasad. Even so, they feel any delay in discussing an election alliance could harm the Congress as it did during last May?s parliamentary polls.

 The party leadership does not believe Ram Vilas Paswan, who has fallen out with the RJD chief after fighting the May elections in tandem, could offer an alternative secular alliance.

 Congress chief Sonia Gandhi helped effect a rapprochement between Laloo Prasad and Paswan in the run-up to the Lok Sabha polls but AICC functionaries are not enthusiastic about playing mediator between the rival Bihar leaders this time round.

 The reluctance is partly because party leaders reckon Laloo might be more vulnerable in Paswan?s absence and, thus, less dismissive towards the Congress.

 ?After we brought Laloo (Prasad) and Paswan together, we got the worst deal while Paswan?s Lok Janshakti Party, even with its limited and unproved presence, managed to get eight Lok Sabha seats,? one leader said.

 AICC leaders say Bihar Congress functionaries want an assessment of how many Assembly seats the party will fight before finalising the election strategy. But the high command is yet to respond.

 However, the Congress leadership has already launched its pre-poll campaign in Jharkhand and Haryana. Party leaders are confident of repeating their strong Lok Sabha poll showing and wresting power in the two states.

 Frontal Congress organisations like the Youth Congress and the National Students Union of India are being energised and local and district-level party conventions are being held to put the Congress machinery into election mode.

 Like she did for last month?s Maharashtra elections, Sonia will entrust special poll responsibilities for the three states to senior party colleagues and appoint AICC point men.

 The Congress may go in for a change of guard in Jharkhand ? it is mulling replacing state unit chief Thomas Hansda.

 Jharkhand Mukti Morcha leader Sibu Soren is likely to be reinducted into the Manmohan Singh cabinet to ensure that they fight the elections in tandem with the JMM as junior partner.

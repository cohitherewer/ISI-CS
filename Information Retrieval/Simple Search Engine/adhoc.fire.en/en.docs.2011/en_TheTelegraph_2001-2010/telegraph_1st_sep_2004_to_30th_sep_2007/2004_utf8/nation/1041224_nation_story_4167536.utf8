 Patna, Dec. 23: As police have registered more than 30 cases for violating the model code of conduct in the wake of the RJD?s rally, party MP Subhash Yadav today took out a procession as part of Laloo Prasad Yadav?s call for ?direct appeal? to the people.

 The call had come after the RJD president was forced to cancel his party?s rally scheduled for today. ?We have come out on the road on the call of our leader (Laloo Prasad). We will fan out in the villages of Bihar and give a befitting reply to our opponents whose conspiracy led to the rally being called off,? Subhash Yadav said.

 As the last signs of the rally, including posters and billboards, continued to be removed today, the district police registered 26 cases against some small-time RJD workers and unknown persons for the ?defacement of public property?. 

 A couple of cases were also lodged against the Lok Janshakti Party and the Bharatiya Janata Party, some of whose rally hoardings had not been removed. 

 Three cases of defacement of railway property, including one at Hajipur, were also registered. Patna senior superintendent of police N.H. Khan said three additional cases were also lodged for the alleged violation the rules governing the playing of loudspeakers.

 All these cases were lodged on the instructions of Election Commission consultant K.J. Rao who visited Patna and Hajipur yesterday. Rao was here to prepare a report on the alleged violation of the model code and misuse of official machinery in the light of the RJD?s rally. He is expected to submit a report to the poll panel tomorrow, when the RJD would reply to a showcause notice asking why the party should not be derecognised. 

 However, there has been no report of any case being registered in the other districts despite the model code being allegedly violated almost all over Bihar.

 ?Cases have been lodged only in Patna and Hajipur, places which Election Commission consultant K.J. Rao visited yesterday,? sources said.

 A downcast RJD also observed the birth anniversary of former Prime Minister Charan Singh today. 

 ?The day was observed as Kisan Mazdoor Diwas and we pledged to raise the issues relating to farmers and workers during the election campaign,? RJD spokesperson Baban Rawat said.

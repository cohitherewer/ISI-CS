 ?Few steps? towards peace peak

 Leh, Nov. 8: Three days, nearly 40 delegations and hundreds of kilometres later, home minister Shivraj Patil believes he has walked ?a few steps? forward on the long and winding road that could lead to peace in Kashmir.

 Patil wrapped up his Jammu and Kashmir visit, which coincided with an escalation in militant violence, with a meeting with security officials of the region.

 But before he left, he stressed what could be his single-most important political message for the state ? when it comes to holding peace talks, the home ministry is capable of and willing to look through the Hurriyat Conference.

 The idea is to strip the separatist conglomerate of the legitimacy as the representative of the people of Jammu and Kashmir that the National Democratic Alliance regime had bestowed on it.

 Seen as part of this exercise was the release of a home ministry document in Jammu yesterday that linked the Hurriyat?s reluctance to come for talks with pressure from Pakistan.

 Minutes before he left for Delhi, Patil discarded his initial aloofness about the document after a few persistent questions on the Hurriyat?s reluctance. ?I spoke to nearly 40 delegations.... Is it not part of the peace process... or does one only need to talk to a few persons for that? We value other people (Hurriyat) also but not at the expense of the others,? the home minister said.

 At Leh?s Officers Club, surrounded by snow-capped mountains, Patil spoke of his visit taking a few steps forward on the peace road but acknowledged there was a long way yet to go.

 ?One visit cannot resolve all problems... but could help in improving the situation,? he said, flanked by his two junior ministers, Sriprakash Jaiswal and S. Reghupathy, and parliamentary affairs minister Ghulam Nabi Azad.

 ?Even when we have to scale a mountain, we have to take steps. These are steps which will take us to the peak.?

 Patil acknowledged the situation in the Valley was far from normal. Officials said nearly 13 militants and four security personnel were killed in an outburst of violence across the state in the last 48 hours.

 ?We have never said that the situation in the state has become normal. That would be taking undeserved credit,? the home minister said. But the situation, he contended, was ?becoming normal?.

 On his tour?s last leg, Patil met delegations of the Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council, the district Congress committee, and social and Buddhist organisations.

 Patil indicated to some of them that he did not approve of their demand for Union territory status for Ladakh. But he agreed to consider development projects that would improve the region?s connectivity with the rest of the country and boost its trade and tourism.

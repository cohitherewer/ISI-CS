 BJP pats amp; punches govt in one go

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 23: The BJP has welcomed Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf?s address at the UN General Assembly yesterday, in its first positive-sounding word for the Congress-led government after nearly five months of hectoring.

 However, in the same breath, it slammed the Left for making an issue of the inclusion of representatives from multilateral agencies and foreign consultancy firms in the Planning Commission.

 ?Musharraf?s statement was generally positive. There was none of the rancour that marked his earlier statements. We are happy to see this change. It creates a good atmosphere for the talks between the Prime Minister and Musharraf tomorrow,? BJP spokesman Yashwant Sinha said about the speech, which was bereft of the Pakistani leader?s usual harsh rhetoric while speaking on Kashmir.

 ?He said this is the last chance for bilateralism, but bilateralism is the only hope for India and Pakistan to improve their relations and not trilateralism or international law?s intervention. This should be seized as a moment of peace to usher in an era of peace,? Sinha added.

 But what Sinha gave with one hand, he took away with the other when he waxed eloquent on the ?extreme fragility? of the United Progressive Alliance. ?Not a day passes without the Left parties barking at the government over some issue or the other,? he said.

 ?This is soon followed by ministers and think tank members supplicating before the communist bosses to give up their rigid stand. Every once in a while, the PM and the super PM are also seen engaged in fire-fighting efforts. Ultimately, the fire is doused only after the government caves in and rolls back its decision to keep the Left parties in good humour.?

 Sinha, who was finance and then external affairs minister in the previous government, said his party?s view was the Centre, as well as states, should be free to obtain the ?best available advice? from within the country and outside on development and economic growth. ?This has indeed been the case for the past many years both at the Centre and in states,? the BJP leader said.

 But his endorsement of the decision to involve representatives of foreign agencies came with a caveat. ?However, as far as foreign or multilateral agencies are concerned, we believe that their involvement should be limited to specific assignments,? Sinha said.

 ?The BJP believes that it is neither prudent nor necessary to elevate their involvement to a level whereby they become a part of the decision-making process. Also, care should be taken to ensure that only such information which is in the public domain is shared with these agencies.?

 Sinha questioned the plan panel?s decision to allow its advisory bodies to be ?dominated by Leftist economists?, many of whom, he said, ?are activists of the communist parties?. 

 The commission, he explained, was not merely an adjunct of the Centre but also assisted state governments, which were governed by different parties.

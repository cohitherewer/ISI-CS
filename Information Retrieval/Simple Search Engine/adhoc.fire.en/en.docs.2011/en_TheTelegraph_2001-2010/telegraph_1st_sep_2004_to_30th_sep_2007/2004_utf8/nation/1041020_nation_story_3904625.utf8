 Shinde quits, stalemate sticks

 K. SUBRAHMANYA

 New Delhi, Oct. 19: The 

 stalemate over the chief ministership of the next Democratic 

 Front government in Maharashtra continued today even as 

 chief minister Sushil Kumar Shinde submitted his resignation 

 to the governor in Mumbai.

 A scheduled meeting of Congress leaders with Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar here this evening did not take place. It was expected to thrash out an understanding on which of the two allies should lead the next government.

 Sources in both camps said informal parleys were on almost through the day but nothing concrete emerged that necessitated the scheduled meeting.

 Pawar, also the Union agriculture minister, kept out of the informal talks as he was busy with agriculture scientists at the Indian Council for Agricultural Research, part of his ministry.

 Praful Patel of the NCP was in touch with Congress leaders, including AICC general secretary in charge of Maharashtra Margaret Alva and Sonia Gandhi?s political secretary Ahmed Patel.

 Alva formally ruled out any meeting with the ally for the day after party consultations at defence minister Pranab Mukherjee?s home here late in the evening.

 Shinde, who returned to Delhi after submitting his resignation in Mumbai, was part of the consultations.

 Returning to the talks table at Pawar?s 6 Janpath home this evening ? after last night?s ?inconclusive? meeting ? was thrown into uncertainty after the NCP chief insisted the Congress should honour his party?s right to the chief ministership based on the single-largest-party principle.

 Alternatively, he said he would extend outside support if the Congress wanted to retain the chief ministership.

 Late last night, Pawar is understood to have rejected an informal Congress proposal ? apparently made by Ghulam Nabi Azad in his ?individual capacity? ? to opt for the ?rotation system? of Jammu and Kashmir.

 The arrangement allows each ally to hold the chief minister?s post for each half of the Assembly?s tenure. Azad is believed to have sought the top post for his party for the first half.

 With Pawar apparently unenthusiastic, the Congress did not make formal Azad?s proposal.

 This followed Pawar?s rejection of the Congress suggestion last night to continue with Shinde on the grounds that the poll verdict was in favour of the alliance as a single entity.

 NCP sources claimed that Pawar had on Sunday rejected two senior Left leaders? offer to negotiate for him the Union home portfolio in return for his party relinquishing claim to the chief ministership in the Congress? favour.

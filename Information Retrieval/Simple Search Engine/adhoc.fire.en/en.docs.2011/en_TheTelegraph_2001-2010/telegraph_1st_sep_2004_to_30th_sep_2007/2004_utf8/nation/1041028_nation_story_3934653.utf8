 Imphal, Oct. 27: A semblance of normality had returned to Manipur after three-months of agitation, but the state plunged back into chaos today with protesters and police clashing during a 24-hour statewide general strike. 

 The statewide strike from midnight yesterday was called by a tribal student organisation in protest against the death of three youths in an alleged fake encounter. 

 The Kuki Students? Organisation (KSO) said the slain youths were students and not militants, as claimed by the police.

 The police lobbed teargas shells and fired rubber bullets at protesters in Imphal?s New Checkon locality, injuring two of them. More trouble is expected during the indefinite bandh in all five hill districts from tomorrow. Both the national highways passing through the state will be blocked, the KSO said.

 The organisation claimed its call for the general strike evoked ?a good response? in most parts of the state. 

 The two persons injured in the police crackdown were admitted to Jawaharlal Nehru Hospital. The police also rounded up several protesters from Langol Games Village in Imphal West.

 Groups of protesters pelted stones at Dimapur-bound buses passing through the Kuki-dominated Sadar Hills. Some of the vehicles were damaged, but no passenger was injured. Inter-district bus services were suspended, but trucks plied with escorts, official sources said.

 A protest rally in the border town of Moreh demanded punishment for the police personnel who shot dead the three youths. All three hailed from Moreh, which is on the Indo-Myanmar border. Shops and other business establishments in the town remained closed, affecting border trade.

 Official sources said life was paralysed in all Kuki-inhabited areas, but the general strike did not affect several parts of the state. 

 The three youths were killed on Monday night at New Checkon, which is under Porompat police station in Imphal East district. The police continued to insist that all three were members of a Kuki militant group and were killed in retaliation. The official version was that they were killed during operations in the capital town and its surrounding areas to prevent the entry of militants. 

 The police said a team was deployed in the New Checkon locality on receiving information that some militants were planning to visit the area to extort money. 

 The police team spotted some youths moving about in the locality and asked them to stop. The youths then allegedly opened fire, forcing the policemen to retaliate. 

 The KSO disputed the police version and said the slain youths were ?innocent students? who were on their way to a Kuki church.

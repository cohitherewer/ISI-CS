 Mystery of charred ?suitor? 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Nov. 16: A badly burnt restaurant owner died after he was rushed to hospital from the house of a woman he is said to have been harassing for the past few months. 

 Jitender Kumar, who was doused in petrol, died of 98 per cent burns in Ram Manohar Lohia hospital today. Police will try to find out during the post-mortem tomorrow whether Jitender, who was spurned by the woman, committed suicide or was murdered. 

 Police said Jitender, owner of Vintage Restaurant in Paschim Vihar, met the woman, a resident of Rajouri Garden who is married with two kids, when the family visited his eatery a year ago. Jitender pursued the acquaintance and began visiting them regularly. 

 On Monday evening, the woman, her husband and Jitender turned up at Rajouri Garden police station, where she complained that the restaurateur was harassing her for the last few months, said Neeraj Thakur, deputy commissioner, west district. She told the police she did not want Jitender to visit any more. 

 ?At the police station, Jitender gave in writing that he will not bother the lady any more and will not visit her any more. However, the same night, around 1 am, he went to their house and created an uproar, shouting ?If you don?t see me, I will set myself on fire?,? said Thakur. 

 ?The neighbours heard him shouting and yelling through the night even though no one responded. But once he was inside the gate, no one could see what was happening. The next thing they saw was the man was on fire,? he said. 

 Jitender was rushed to the hospital, where he died around 10 am. The doctor attending to Jitender gave a report that apparently says the victim had a history of self-inflicted burns. 

 But as no one saw him set himself on fire, the police do not want to form an opinion before the post-mortem.

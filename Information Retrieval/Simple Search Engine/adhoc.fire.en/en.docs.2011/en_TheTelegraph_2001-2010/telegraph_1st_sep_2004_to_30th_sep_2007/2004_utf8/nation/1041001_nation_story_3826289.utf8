 ?Occult? Paswan joins Laloo

 ASHISH SINHA

 Patna, Sept. 30: The man with bare torso, trinkets tied to his waist and two long sticks in his hand invoked the gods for Laloo Prasad Yadav all right.

 Nearly 20 male drummers, all wearing green turbans, worked up a frenzy around the railway minister, who sat unsmiling, appreciating their effort, anticipating good omen. 

 Sanjay Paswan, a former minister in the NDA government, was at work with his battalion of ojhas and gunins (occult priests), trying to win the heart of the RJD president. 

 Paswan has quit the BJP to walk into the RJD because, he now feels, his earlier party took the people for a ride and Laloo Prasad is much more ?genuine?.

 Minutes later, Paswan himself snatched a drum from an elderly man and started a dance with the troupe in front of his new leader. ?There is a great deal of science in this. There are some frauds but then there are genuine people. We must separate the two and use this knowledge for the good of society,? he said. Laloo Prasad nodded in appreciation.

 Paswan had kicked up a storm when he organised a conference of ojhas in Patna while he was a minister. But the former bank officer is not ready to give up his faith in occult vidya.

 Dozens of women were asked to sit on the dais and sing traditional songs invoking the mother goddess for Laloo Prasad?s good fortune. Some of them even danced as everyone around clapped with vigour. The RJD chief later got sarees distributed among the women.

 The function was held to remember former chief minister Bhola Paswan Shastri but Paswan used it to show his ?strength? on his way to the RJD. Laloo Prasad was impressed and he later asked that the drummers and dancers perform once again.

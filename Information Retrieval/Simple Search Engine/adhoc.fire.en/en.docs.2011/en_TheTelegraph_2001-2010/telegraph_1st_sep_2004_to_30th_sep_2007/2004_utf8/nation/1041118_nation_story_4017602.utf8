 Mutt takeover not on cards

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Chennai, Nov. 17: The Tamil Nadu government today ruled out taking over the administration or assets of the Kanchi Kamakoti Mutt in Kancheepuram.

 ?We do not have even an iota of intention to take over the administration of the Kanchi mutt,? chief minister Jayalalithaa told the Tamil Nadu Assembly.

 In Madras High Court, the hearing on the seer?s bail plea remained inconclusive and would continue tomorrow. 

 However, Justice R. Balasubramanian made it clear that the hearing would not come in the way of the Kancheepuram judicial magistrate in dealing with the petition the prosecution has filed seeking police custody of the seer. 

 Former Union law minister Ram Jethmalani is arguing the acharya?s case.

 Jayalalithaa said her government holds the Kanchi Kamakoti Mutt in high esteem and is keen to ensure that the mutt continues to uphold the ?traditions of Hindu dharma and its principles?.

 ?Our government is of the firm view that the great name and reputation of the Kanchi mutt should not be sullied in any way. There is absolutely no thinking whatsoever to freeze the activities of this sacred mutt or bring its administration under the government?s control,? she said.

 The chief minister pointed out that Tamil Nadu police has shown all respect and courtesy due to the acharya even after his arrest.

 At the Kanchi mutt, special pujas were offered for the early release of the seer. Junior acharya Vijayendra Saraswati appealed to devotees not to get despondent.

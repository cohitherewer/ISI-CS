 Queue cut rankles Gujral

 I.K.Gujral

 Wagah border, Oct. 17 (PTI): Former Prime Minister I.K. Gujral today said he was ?humiliated? by Indian customs officials at the India-Pakistan border here.

 ?I was in Lahore in Pakistan for the past two days. Today, when I crossed over to the Indian territory and went for customs clearance, I was badly humiliated by an officer there who asked me to come in queue,? Gujral told reporters here.

 ?When I reached the customs section, I found none of the passengers standing in the queue. I and my friend, columnist Kuldip Nayar, who also crossed with me to India, requested the customs officials to attend to us but they did not bother.?

 ?After 25 minutes, when a customs official came to his seat, he asked me to come to the window to fill the immigration form once again in his presence. I felt severely humiliated,? the former Prime Minister said. 

 ?I have lodged my strong protest against the behaviour of customs officials.?

 Gujral said he dreaded to think what people went through at the border checkpost. ?If this is the welcome accorded to a former Prime Minister by the customs officials, one can imagine the plight of the common man at their hands.?

 He added: ?I don?t think people coming from Pakistan to India through this land route are getting any better treatment at the hands of customs officials.?

 Making a comparison with the other side of the border, he said: ?In Pakistan this afternoon, the officials there extended all help to me in customs clearance. They did not ask me to come in queue.?

 In chains for 6 months for daring flee home 

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, Dec. 1: Just days after the launch of the second phase of a child liberation programme here, project officials have rescued a 12-year-old boy whose father had clamped him in chains for six months to stop him from running away.

 A weak, gaunt Srinivasulu Reddy was found shackled by his hands and ankles at his father?s dirty and dark bicycle repair shop at Budhwarpet in Kurnool, 230 km south of the Andhra Pradesh capital. In a shocker for civilised society, Mohan Reddy, 38, thought this was the best way to prevent his son from running away as he had done many times before.

 National Child Labour Project officials who chanced on the boy following a tip-off could barely believe that he had been left clamped among the nuts, bolts, handlebars and cycle wheels in the rickety repair shop. Just last week these officials participated in the launch of a Rs 40-crore child liberation programme supported by the Department for International Development and International Labour Organisation. The programme, launched by British minister Hillary Benn, aims to get 5 lakh child labourers back to school.

 ?I cannot believe my eyes. It is shocking and unfortunate,? said Kurnool district child labour project officer Venkatarami Reddy who went to the shop after a tip-off. Srinivasulu?s shackles were not removed even when he needed to relieve himself. ?He had to eat and also sleep with the shackles on,? the officer said.

 The boy said he had been shackled since May. ?The shackle was removed when I had to change my clothes. I had to sleep in it as my father was scared that I would give him the slip at night.?

 Asked why he would run away, Srinivasulu said: ?I could not take the beatings of my father when he was drunk.? Mohan, who has three sons and two daughters, could not afford to send his children to school. ?Only the third boy was sent to school. Srinivasulu was the second son,? Venkatarami Reddy said.

 But the father had a different story to tell. ?My boy did not want to go to school but (wanted) to wander freely along with other urchins and spend time (with them). He had run away from home at least four times in the last two years and joined some anti-social gangs engaged in smuggling liquor and drugs,? he said.

 Mohan has been taken into police custody on charges of cruelty to children, which carries a minimum jail term of six months. His son has been sent to a residential school on the outskirts of Kurnool.

 There are nearly 1.39 million child workers in Andhra eking out a living in cotton fields, food stalls, workshops, stone quarries or as domestic help. Srinivasulu?s case is just the tip of the iceberg as child labour is rife in all Rayalaseema districts. It is also prevalent in Nandyal, which former Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao used to represent in Parliament.

 Officials say they wish to enforce the law, but factional regional politics ties them down. ?There is lack of political will to strictly adhere to this law. There are several children working in the farms and houses of popular ministers and Opposition leaders in the district,? a senior Kurnool district police officer said.

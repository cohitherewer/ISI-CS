 BJP banks on cows to beat Laloo

 New Delhi, Sept. 19: The BJP has turned to cows and courts to best Laloo Prasad Yadav after failing to increase its vote bank in Bihar, with just five months to go for elections in the state.

 Knowing that cows are an emotive symbol for Yadavs and other Hindus alike, the party plans to play on people?s emotions by starting an intensive campaign against what it calls ?cattle smuggling by the Indian Railways? to slaughter houses in Bangladesh. Laloo Prasad is the railway minister.

 Party leaders Arun Jaitley and Maneka Gandhi said the BJP and its state governments would stop trains carrying cattle to Bengal, from where they are smuggled into Bangladesh for slaughter.

 The BJP is also elated over the Supreme Court?s decision to stop legal action against Dipesh Chandak, one of the approvers in the multi-crore fodder scam in which Laloo Yadav is an accused. The court yesterday directed the approver to make a ?full disclosure? about the scam; the threat of action by the income-tax department is alleged to have kept Chandak from making a ?full and frank disclosure?.

 The Laloo Prasad-led RJD is unfazed. Bihar?s minister for law and minority welfare Shakeel Ahmed said the BJP would not be allowed to derive political mileage from cows. ?It is not a communal issue. They are trying to give communal colour to everything. Communalism has to be tackled by aggressive economic policy and aggressive secularism and not by soft secularism.?

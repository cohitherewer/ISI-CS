 Beijing boost to Delhi UN role

 PRANAY SHARMA

 New Delhi, Oct. 20: In a significant shift from its earlier position, China today said it wants to see India play a bigger role in the UN Security Council. But it also kept close friend Pakistan?s sensitivity in mind by pointing out that the global fight against terrorism should take into account the ?root causes? of the menace.

 ?India is a major country in Asia and one of the developing countries with the fastest growth rate. China fully understands India?s position and endorses its aspiration in playing a role in international affairs,? state councillor Tang Jiaxuan said.

 ?We also hope to see that India plays a greater and more constructive role in the UN Security Council to make important contribution to world peace.?

 So far, China ? one of the five permanent members with veto powers ? has been ambiguous on supporting India?s candidature for a Security Council seat. But today Tang, who heads China?s foreign policy establishment, made it clear that Beijing endorses India?s role in the Security Council.

 One reason for the shift in stand could be the growing realisation that with more and more countries openly supporting India ? even permanent members like the UK, France and Russia ? it would be better if Beijing showed some positive movement.

 But on terrorism, China?s willingness to work closely with India came with a rider. Tang, who was in Pakistan before he came to Delhi, said the ?root cause? as well as the ?symptoms? of terrorism needed to be looked into if both sides were serious about eliminating the scourge.

 Tang also made it clear that Beijing was satisfied with the steps taken by the Musharraf regime to safeguard Chinese nationals and assets in Pakistan.

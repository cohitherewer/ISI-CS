 Sonia connects with constituency

 - Law amp; order focus in bypoll campaign

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 Rae Bareli, Sept. 14: Sonia Gandhi today held a chaupal in Rae Bareli, meeting villagers to hear their problems, and resurrected the issue of law and order in Uttar Pradesh.

 Ramlila Maidan, a small ground at Sudhauli in Sonia?s parliamentary seat, was all dressed up ? gates had been erected, a sprawling shamiana was up and, at one corner, a podium had been built. Hours before Sonia arrived on her second visit since the election victory, hundreds of people had begun to gather ? some came with drums and bands. Local leaders waited with flowers, garlands and small gifts for what everyone expected would be a mini rally.

 But the Congress president had other plans. Like husband Rajiv Gandhi often did, Sonia went directly to the people, holding their hands, wrapping elderly women in a hug and hearing out problems. Reinventing the chaupal, a tradition preceding panchayat where village elders would meet the people to dispense justice, Sonia struck a rapport with the crowd.

 Munni Devi, a pale 52-year-old, broke into sobs when the Congress president approached her. Pointing to her daughter, she said: ?I told her I was preparing to get her married but could not do so for money. My husband died three months ago. I asked her for help. She noted down my name and assured help. I am touched by her sincerity.?

 Avinash Kumar, a 15-year-old, had a demand to make. He told his ?favourite leader? about the trouble he was going through to learn computers and asked: ?Why don?t you start a computer centre here, Madam, for students like me?? Sonia touched his head and said: ?Hum koshish karenge tumhare shahar mein computer centre kholne ki (We will try to open a computer centre in your town).?

 Later, she said she was thinking of opening a computer centre each in Rae Bareli?s five Assembly segments.

 Setting the tone for her party?s campaign for bypolls in 12 Assembly segments and two parliamentary seats next month, Sonia said: ?As the people, who I just heard, were telling me, the law and order of Uttar Pradesh is very bad. I read about this in newspapers too. I will talk to both the state and the central government. I will do whatever is possible.?

 Senior Congress leaders suggested that Sonia, who is also the chairperson of the Congress-led alliance at the Centre, will write to chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav.

 Mulayam Singh?s Samajwadi Party shares an uneasy relationship with the Congress. Although it is offering outside support to the Union government, the parties are bitter rivals in the state. The law and order issue had triggered an uproar from the Samajwadis when it was raised by Sonia?s son and Amethi MP Rahul.

 Sonia spent an hour at the Ramlila Maidan on the first day of her three-day tour. Later, she travelled to other parts of the constituency. In the afternoon, a team from Indian Telecom Industries, declared sick by the previous NDA government, called on her to express gratitude for the Centre?s efforts to revive the company. The Centre has sanctioned Rs 150 crore for the revival.

 But in her brief interaction with the media, Sonia refused to be drawn into old controversies. Asked for comments on the BJP?s efforts to rake up her foreign origin once again, she only raised her hand in a salute to their tenacity.

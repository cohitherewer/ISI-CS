 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Sept. 5: Police today arrested the second accused in the Pushkin Chandra murder in the capital.

 On August 14, Pushkin and his gay partner Kuldeep were found murdered at Pushkins Anand Lok residence in south Delhi.

 Thirty-eight-year-old Pushkin was a USAID official. 

 Todays arrest is the fourth in the case. The police tracked down Moti, or Mohit, who had been absconding since the murder to an Uttar Pradesh village close to the Nepal border. Moti was brought back to Delhi for interrogation. 

 The other accused, Rajesh, was arrested last Saturday . 

 Moti and Rajesh were drivers of a school van in central Delhi and were acquainted with Pushkin. 

 Two others, Praveen Kumar and his father Jai Kishore, were also arrested. They had allegedly helped Rajesh and Moti to escape. 

 A number of Pushkins belongings, stolen by Rajesh and Moti were found with Praveen and Jai Kishore.

 On the day of the murder, Pushkin picked up Rajesh and Moti from central Delhi and took them to his residence at Anand Lok where they were later joined by Kuldeep, the police said. Around 11.30 pm, the four went to a farewell party for Uffe Gartner, a Dane employed with the UN, to his home in nearby Sanwal Nagar. 

 Well known for his parties in the capitals gay circuit, Gartner was leaving India to take up a new posting in Paris by a 3 am flight. 

 After the party, the four returned to Pushkins house where they started engaging in homosexual activity. 

 At this point, Pushkin took out his camera and started taking pictures of Rajesh and Moti. When the duo objected, he did not stop. 

 The two grabbed kitchen knives and stabbed Pushkin and later killed Kuldeep as he was witness to Pushkins murder. They, then, robbed the house and left in Pushkins car. 

 The bodies were discovered the following morning. The police also recovered a stash of pornographic CDs and photographs of men in compromising positions with other men which had them suspecting blackmail was a motive.

 The case finally got a breakthrough when Pushkins car was found in a domestic parking lot in central Delhi. A few days later, the police got the first lead to the duos whereabouts after a constable was alerted by a school that the two drivers of the school van were missing. Following this, the arrests were made.

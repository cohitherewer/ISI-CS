 MLA threat heat on Rabri govt 

 - Senior officials to appear in court

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Dec. 7: The Bihar government is in the dock yet again following allegations that an Opposition MLA has received an extortion call. 

 To make matters worse, Patna High Court came down heavily on the government over the law and order situation in Bihar.

 ?The crime situation in the state has gone out of control,? a division bench observed today while hearing a writ petition on behalf of the Indian Medical Association and others.

 State chief secretary, home commissioner, director-general of police and inspector-general prisons will appear in the court tomorrow morning to explain the measures the government has taken so far to contain crime in the state.

 The court also wanted to know why the jail administration has failed to prevent the use of cellphones inside prisons. ?Even now, certain jail inmates are said to have access to mobile phones, which are used to carry out crimes,? the bench observed.

 Inspector-general (prisons) Deepak Kumar Singh has reportedly admitted the lapse before the court and promised to take stringent action to stop the use of cellphones in the jails of Bihar.

 Even as the court was hearing the case, the entire Opposition in the Bihar Assembly boycotted the third day of the winter session, protesting against the alleged threat to BJP legislator Viswanath Baitha for extortion money

 Baitha, MLA from Bhore, a reserved constituency in Gopalganj, today said someone called up on his son?s cellphone two days ago and demanded Rs 2 lakh.

 ?We?ve heard that politicians have plenty of money. So, give us this amount within three days, or else be prepared to see your entire family being wiped out,? Baitha quoted the anonymous caller as saying.

 Baitha?s plea fell on deaf ears. ?Though I?m an MLA, I stay in a humble kuchha house,? he pleaded in vain.

 Today, Speaker Sadanand Singh assured the House that special protection will be provided to all members. The Opposition, led by the BJP, demanded a formal statement by the government. It also demanded a special debate but did not pass a resolution as chief minister Rabri Devi was not present. 

 Minister in charge of home affairs Upendra Varma informed the House that the Gopalganj district magistrate has been asked to look into the case and report to the government immediately.

 Away from the court and the Assembly, CPI-ML workers held up rail and road traffic in different parts of the state while trying to enforce the chakka bandh.

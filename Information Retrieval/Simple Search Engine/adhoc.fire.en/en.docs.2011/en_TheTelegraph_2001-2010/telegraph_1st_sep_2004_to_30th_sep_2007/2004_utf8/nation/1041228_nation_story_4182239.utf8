 New Delhi, Dec. 27: The country?s military, itself battered by the tsunami that raged through the eastern seaboard on Sunday, today put the might of its navy and air force for relief and rescue even as it began assessing the toll on itself.

 More than 30 ships of the navy and the coastguard, more than 20 aircraft from the navy and the air force and several thousand troops of the army have been deployed for the biggest peacetime operation that defence ministry sources described as being on a ?war-footing?.

 More than 100 people were reported to have been killed in the Indian Air Force base in Car Nicobar alone. Among the dead were airmen and members of their families. Defence minister Pranab Mukherjee, the naval chief, Admiral Arun Prakash, and the top brass of the unified tri-service of the Andaman and Nicobar Command carried out recces over the islands today.

 The navy has deployed all its available resources in three commands ? Southern, Eastern and Western ? for search and rescue and to ferry relief. The coast guard vessels and aircraft in the east were sailing to islands, patrolling and rescuing the marooned. 

 Navy spokesman Commander Vinay Garg said in New Delhi that 25 ships of the navy, some with helicopters on board, were involved along the east coast, in the islands and in taking relief to Sri Lanka and the Maldives.

 The air force is flying three huge transporters ? IL 76s ? nine AN32 transporters, two Avros and eight MI 8 helicopters in the affected areas. In all, 13 ships were deployed in the seas off the Andamans and in the east coast. Nine ships have sailed to Sri Lanka and the Maldives.

 In the navy?s Port Blair establishment in the Andamans, the tsunami and an afterwave tore the berthing howsers ? the thick ropes that tie ships to jetties ? of four ships. The ships were put to sea urgently as a precaution. The naval and coast guard jetties have been damaged. Four ships in the dry dock and the civil port of Port Blair were also said to have been damaged.

 Campbell Bay was closest to the epicentre of the afterwave ? just 58 nautical miles from it. Aftershocks ? one measuring 6 on the Richter scale ?were reported from the islands early this morning.

 Navy and air force sources said the damage to Car Nicobar and Campbell Bay was yet to be assessed. In Car Nicobar, where the airfield is located on high ground, the devastation was feared to be near complete. This only indicates what may have happened to people living in the low-lying areas. 

 In Port Blair, raging water ploughed a crack through the airfield. Air Chief Marshal S. Krishnaswamy was personally in the Andamans taking stock of the devastation.

 There was no electricity, fuel or water in Port Blair till last night. Fuel, medicine, rations and clothes make up the bulk of the relief being distributed.

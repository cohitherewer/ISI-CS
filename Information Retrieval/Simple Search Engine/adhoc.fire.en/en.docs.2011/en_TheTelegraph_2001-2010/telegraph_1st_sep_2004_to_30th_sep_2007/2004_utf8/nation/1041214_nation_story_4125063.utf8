 Father rage kills child

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Dec. 13: A 28-day-old girl child died here yesterday morning after her father pushed her inside a bathroom tank in a fit of rage at their home in Cuttack.

 According to police, Lingaraj Moharana, who ran a hardware shop, had a fight with his wife Minati over some domestic issues on Saturday night. Mad with rage, Moharana grabbed his 28-day-old daughter and pushed her inside the bathroom tank.

 The family members tried to stop him and were able to retrieve the child after a scuffle. The girl was rushed to Sishu Bhavan here in critical condition. However, the girl could not be saved.

 Bidanasi police have arrested Moharana and registered a murder case against him. According to police, Moharana was displeased when his wife gave birth to the girl. 

 Though he later distributed sweets among his friends, Moharana often cribbed about the child, sources said.

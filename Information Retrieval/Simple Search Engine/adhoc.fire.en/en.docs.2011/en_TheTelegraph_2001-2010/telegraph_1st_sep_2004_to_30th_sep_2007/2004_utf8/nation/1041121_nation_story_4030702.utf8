 Govt nod to AP Upper House

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 20: The Centre has given its nod for reviving the Andhra Pradesh legislative council that was abolished in 1986 for being an ?unnecessary burden?.

 A rough bill for reviving the House of Elders drafted by the Union home ministry is being examined by legal experts and will be submitted for cabinet approval later. Once this formality is completed, the bill will be introduced in Parliament early next year.

 Only Bihar, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh still have legislative councils. Four other states that initially opted for an Upper House later wound up the council: Bengal in 1969, Punjab a year later and Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh in 1986.

 The Andhra government says it will cost no more than Rs 9 crore to run the legislative council ? money well spent, it argues, considering the quality of debate in the Upper House.

 The Constitution limits the size of a legislative council to a third of the Assembly?s strength ? the Andhra legislative council can have no more than 98 members considering the Assembly strength is 294. But the Upper House?s strength is expected to remain at 90.

 As chief minister in the mid-1980s, N.T. Rama Rao had pushed the Rajiv Gandhi government to abolish the legislative council.

 , saying it imposed an ?unnecessary burden? on Andhra?s finances without serving ?any useful purpose?.

 The Congress has been demanding the House of Elders be revived but could not push the move through. A bill for reviving the council was passed by the Rajya Sabha in 1989 but fell through in the Lok Sabha after Rama Rao?s Telugu Desam Party canvassed against the move, saying the Upper House served only to rehabilitate the politically unemployed.

 The Congress included the revival of the council in its election manifesto during May?s Assembly polls in the state. After the Congress-Telengana Rashtra Samiti alliance came to power, one of the first things the Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy government did was to move to revive the Upper House.

 Following a cabinet decision in June, it was not difficult to get a statutory resolution seeking a legislative council passed by a two-thirds majority in the Assembly.

 The Desam was not the only party to oppose the resolution. The CPM went along with the TDP and the CPI abstained from voting on it.

 It is being said that as in the Andhra Assembly, the bill should be passed in Parliament despite opposition ? this time from the Left parties that support the Congress at the Centre.

 Cadet missing in English Channel

 AMIT ROY

 London, Nov. 25: A major air and sea rescue operation has been launched in the English Channel for a 21-year-old cadet who is missing from the Indian registered tanker, the Jag Pratap.

 The youth was last seen at 10 pm yesterday and was reported missing when he did not report for duty this morning. His identity is being withheld till his relatives are informed.

 At 10.15 this morning, Dover Coastguard was contacted by the Jag Pratap, which reported that there was a missing cadet whom the other crew members presumed to be in the water. He was not found after a full headcount of all crew.

 A Coastguard spokesperson told The Telegraph: ?He is Indian and we have been informed he joined the vessel in July.?

 Dover Coastguard, in close liaison with the French Maritime Authorities, immediately issued an alert to all shipping in the area and launched a search for a person in the water between the Bassurelle Light Bouy and Harwich where the Jag Pratap remained anchored.

 The search was conducted by the Coastguard tug, Anglian Monarch, a French customs vessel, a Coastguard surveillance aircraft, a French navy helicopter and a fixed wing aircraft from Fotoflight.

 Dover Coastguard watch manager Pete Legg said: ?We are very concerned for the missing crew member from this vessel and are working closely with our French counterparts in order to search the route that the vessel took through the Dover Strait. The water temperature at this time of the year is between 8-10 degrees (Centigrade) and survival time in the water is unlikely to extend beyond five hours.?

 The quick and generous response of the British and French authorities, who never rest when a life is in danger, contrasts with the attitude taken by the Indian Air Force. In 2002, when an English youth went missing in the Himalayan foothills during a paragliding accident, the IAF refused to continue the search after an initial foray without more money upfront from his parents in England.

 Since they were people of modest means, the money was forked out by Indian businessman Dr Kartar Lalvani, who condemned the IAF?s ?disgraceful attitude?.

 The missing English youth has not been found.

 Patil heads to Kashmir 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 5: Union home minister Shivraj Patil starts a three-day visit to Jammu and Kashmir tomorrow that will take him closer to the situation on the ground, if not the Hurriyat Conference.

 Government sources have virtually ruled out Patil?s meeting the Hurriyat but say attempts are on to organise an interaction with Manmohan Singh when the Prime Minister visits the state for two days, probably from November 16.

 The Centre intends to make Singh?s visit as path-breaking as the last Prime Ministerial trip to Kashmir, in April 2003, when Atal Bihari Vajpayee used his speech at a Srinagar rally to break the ice with Islamabad and the separatists. To this end, the Centre sent textile secretary Wajahat Habibullah and A.S. Dulat, former RAW chief and officer on special duty at the Prime Minister?s Office during the Vajpayee regime, to the Valley last month.

 The duo is thought to have had meetings with separatists within and outside the Hurriyat to see if they can meet Singh in Srinagar. 

 It is not known if the exploratory meetings were successful, but sources say the security establishment increasingly feels the Hurriyat should not be made to look more important or more representative of Kashmiris than it actually is.

 The home ministry thinks it will take a lot of persuasion to get the Hurriyat back to the talks table in view of reports that Pakistan is pressuring the leaders of the separatist conglomerate. Islamabad does not want the Hurriyat to resume talks with Delhi until it is included in the dialogue.

 Patil today ducked questions over the combine?s demand that they be allowed to visit Pakistan before coming to Delhi to talks.

 Congress warning to Mulayam

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Sept. 6: The Congress may consider withdrawing support to Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav, according to the party general secretary in charge of Uttar Pradesh, Satyabrata Chaturvedi.

 The Congress leader was on a visit to the state today to take part in a bandh called by the party to protest against the rapidly declining law and order situation and Congress leaders used the opportunity to mount an attack on the Samajwadi Party-led government.

 Chaturvedi said the ruling party could not take its support for granted. We had made no commitment that the Congress would continue to support the state government despite its failure to deliver. 

 We are concerned about the bad law and order condition... and we have been reminding the state government about this. The law and order condition needs to be improved. If it does not happen, we will be forced to withdraw support. Our patience is running out, Chaturvedi added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Govt steps in, gives BCCI black eye

 - Twist in telecast tussle as Centre contends that cricket board is a 'state'

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 29: The 

 Centre today told the Supreme Court the cricket board could 

 be defined as a state under Article 12 of the Constitution, 

 in a new twist to the battle over telecast rights between 

 Zee TV and the BCCI.

 ?BCCI is a state?.? additional solicitor-general Mohan Parasaran told the five-judge Constitution bench. ?We (the government) control BCCI and the meaning within Article 12 should be expanded to include all those bodies that the government controls.?

 Under the article, a corporation, a metropolitan body and any such organisation that discharges functions of the state is construed to be a ?state?.

 The BCCI had yesterday asked the court to dismiss Zee?s writ petition against cancellation of the bidding process for the rights as it was not a state as defined by the article and no violation of fundamental rights was involved.

 Normally, for enforcement of a fundamental right, a writ petition has to be filed.

 Parasaran?s intervention came even as senior counsel for Zee Harish Salve continued his daylong arguments that the BCCI was a state and its contract with Zee was ?irrevocable? after it accepted the advance the channel paid to telecast all matches in India over the next four years.

 ?After a contract is signed and advance paid, it is deemed to have been effected and there is no possibility of it getting revoked unilaterally by a single party,? the channel argued.

 The BCCI, on its part, circulated an affidavit that said it has never been granted ?any recognition? by the Union government or any government agency.

 The affidavit is contrary to the stand of its counsel K.K. Venugopal who yesterday had argued that the government had ?recognised? the board as an apex body for controlling cricket in the country. But this would have led to the counter-argument that since there was ?government recognition and control?, such a body should be deemed a ?state? under Article 12.

 The affidavit maintained that the ?government or governmental authorities have no say whatsoever in the affairs, management and conduct of BCCI?.

 But Parasaran said a body controlled by the government came within the ambit of the article. The government ?certainly? controlled the BCCI, he said. ?For example, if we (the government) tell them no to a proposal to go to Pakistan they cannot go.?

 Salve contended that Zee?s writ petition was maintainable as the BCCI ?performed a public duty? in selecting the national team. Such public duty borders on discharge of a sovereign function. So the BCCI should come under the purview of the article, he said.

 As the legal bouncers flew thick and fast, barely a week before the start of the India-Australia series, the Supreme Court fired a yorker. The bench, headed by Justice . Santosh Hegde, wondered if cricket was still a gentleman?s game.

 The judge, a keen follower of cricket, is part of another bench adjudicating the dispute between Ten Sports and Doordarshan over the telecast of the India-Pakistan cricket series earlier this year.

 After Salve recalled how former West Indian fast bowler Charlie Griffith had donated blood after his bouncer felled India?s Nari Contractor, Hegde asked if cricket was played in the same spirit now.

 The hearings will continue tomorrow.

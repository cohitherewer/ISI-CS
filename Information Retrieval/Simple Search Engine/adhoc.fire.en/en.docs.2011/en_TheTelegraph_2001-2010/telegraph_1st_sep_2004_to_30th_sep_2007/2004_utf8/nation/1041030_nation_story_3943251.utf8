 Unity focus for Advani 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 29: Contrary to expectations, BJP chief .K. Advani is not expected to make any ?drastic change? in his team of office-bearers, maintained party sources.

 Pramod Mahajan, whom a section of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and BJP hold responsible for the Maharashtra election loss, could be retained as general secretary as Advani, who is likely to announce his team tomorrow, feels a major shake-up now may not be ?useful?.

 Sources said the BJP chief?s immediate priority is to keep the party together and not create ?disgruntled? elements whose presence could further demoralise the cadre.

 Former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Uma Bharti and former Union minister from Karnataka Ananth Kumar are likely to be made general secretaries.

 The BJP constitution was amended at a recent national council to increase the number of functionaries at the top tiers. Thus, there will be seven general secretaries, up from five, and nine vice-presidents and secretaries instead of seven ? this has been done mainly to accommodate out-of-work leaders.

 Mahajan, Arun Jaitley, Rajnath Singh and Sanjay Joshi are expected to continue as general secretaries but Shivraj Singh Chauhan may be sent to Madhya Pradesh as state unit chief. Uma will replace Chauhan but will be more than just a state representative. Like him, she belongs to a backward caste, but is a well-known face and a woman.

 The seventh general secretary?s post may be left vacant to be filled by a candidate from Bihar or Jharkhand closer to the Assembly elections.

 Another prospective inductee is Madan Lal Khurana who quit as Rajasthan governor earlier this week. 

 Khurana, who said he did not want to get bogged down in local Delhi politics, may be made a vice-president and put in charge of Haryana ? which goes to the polls in February. 

 The former Union minister from Kerala, . Rajagopal, is also a contender for the post.

 Either Ravi Shankar Prasad or Rajiv Pratap Rudy might also be made secretary.

 Advani put off announcing his team today as he and former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee tried unsuccessfully to get former party chief M. Venkaiah Naidu to accept the post of either senior vice-president, chairman of the central election committee or secretary of the parliamentary board.

 Bihar waits for prison big catch

 - 15 jails table seizure list

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Dec. 9: The raids over, the Bihar government waits for the outcome. 

 ?So far we have received reports from 15 of the 55 jails in the state, including six central prisons. Of these, raids in nine jails drew a blank whereas some objects have been recovered from the others,? inspector-general (prisons) Deepak Kumar Singh said this evening.

 Though the ?catch? so far has been limited to a few mobile phones, chargers, a VCD player and condoms, reports from the remaining 40 jails could yield the desired results. 

 Bihar Military Police (BMP) personnel seized two mobile phones and as many chargers from the jail at Bihar Sharif and one each from Gaya and Sitamarhi. In Nawada, the catch was a couple of chargers but no phones, he added. 

 Apart from such tools of ?business?, ?pleasure? items like liquor and condoms were found in the jails at Muzaffarpur and Gaya respectively. A BMP team also found a VCD player in Beur Central Jail, where blue films were allegedly screened.

 Reportedly, no objectionable articles were found in the ?sensitive? jails at Gopalganj and Siwan, where RJD parliamentarian Mohammad Shahabuddin is lodged. 

 Singh said the tough stand taken by Patna High Court and the consequent raids on jails across the state were steps in the right direction.

 ?I am quite satisfied with yesterday?s raids. Now I want to retain the momentum and adopt strict measures to ensure that things do not deteriorate once again,? he told The Telegraph.

 The senior official said the police would shortly introduce systemic measures like joint frisking of inmates at the prison gates. 

 ?Till now, policemen were posted outside the gates for external security. From now on, both BMP personnel and district armed policemen would frisk every prisoner to prevent cellphones and other forbidden items from coming back to the jails,? he said, adding, ?the state police would also conduct occasional raids on the prisons.?

 Metal detectors and closed-circuit televisions are already in place in the ?most sensitive? jails at Beur and Bhagalpur. 

 The state government is also planning to install jammers in some prisons, sources said.

 Giving credence to reports that certain jail employees were hand-in-glove with influential inmates and catered to their needs, the senior police official said he would soon start identifying the errant officers before giving them ?exemplary punishment?.

 ?We are on the verge of shifting certain influential and powerful prisoners to Bhagalpur Central Jail, which will soon become the most secure prison in the state,? the IG (prisons) said.

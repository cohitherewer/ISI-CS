 Karunakaran rap

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Thiruvananthapuram, Sept. 4: K. Karunakaran today ticked off new Kerala chief minister Oommen Chandy and the Congress high command against the reported attempt to decimate his I group.

 The veteran was trying to dispel the popular notion that three of the 10 new Congress faces being inducted into the cabinet tomorrow belong to his camp. 

 Karunakaran drove down to Raj Bhavan this morning soon after the list was announced. Speaking at a news conference after meeting Governor R.. Bhatia, he asked: Who said they (the new faces) are my nominees.

 The veteran added: Chandy can no more be taken at face value... and he would do well to remember the fate of his predecessor (A.K. Antony). This is humiliation. Theres strong revulsion in our camp.

 Just a few days ago the veteran was by Chandys side savouring Antonys exit. His son K. Muraleedharan added: We will go by Karunakarans diktat. Do we need to prove that the I group is no pushover?

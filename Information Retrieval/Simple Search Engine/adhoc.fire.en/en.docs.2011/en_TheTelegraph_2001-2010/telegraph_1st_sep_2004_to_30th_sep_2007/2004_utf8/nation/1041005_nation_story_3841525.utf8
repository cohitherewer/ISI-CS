 Caution against arthritis drug 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Oct. 4: Domestic 

 pharmaceutical major Ranbaxy has asked doctors in India 

 not to prescribe its anti-arthritis drug Rofibax as a long-term 

 palliative after Merck of the US withdrew its original product, 

 Vioxx.

 Rofibax is the generic version of the innovative drug, Vioxx (containing the Rofecoxib molecule), made by the US-based Merck amp; Co Inc.

 Last week, Merck withdrew the drug in the US after a study showed that prolonged use could lead to heart disease and magnify the risks of a stroke.

 Ramesh . Adige, Ranbaxy?s vice-president (corporate affairs), said the company had reacted to what the innovator drug-maker Merck had done.

 The United States Food and Drug Administration had not asked Merck to withdraw the drug. Merck pulled off its blockbuster drug after a recent study pointed out that the arthritis drug doubled the risk of heart attack and stroke if taken for more than 18 months.

 Adige said the company had not received any instructions from the Drug Controller General of India office regarding this drug and it had taken this action on its own.

 The drug controller general, Ashwani Kumar, who had earlier gone on record saying some quick decision needed to be taken on this formulation, was not available for comment today.

 Ranbaxy said in a statement that in view of the new findings by Merck, the company would be urging physicians to prescribe Rofibax (Rofecoxib) only for short-term usage and to monitor the patients as per the label specifications.

 It said that simultaneously the company has also undertaken the commitment to study all available data from all sources and would present these findings to the relevant government body with recommendations.

 Ranbaxy has a little over 15 per cent market share amounting to about Rs 14 crore in the Rs 90-crore Rofecoxib market in India, said Adige. The company has not faced any complaints for its two brands, Rofibax and Rofibax Plus.

 About 100 generic brands of Rofecoxib are currently marketed in India by more than 10 companies. Other leading manufacturers are Mumbai-based Unichem and Sun pharmaceuticals. However, the companies were not available for comment.

 Vioxx is Mercks fourth biggest drug. It had sales of $2.55 billion last year. It is used by about two million people worldwide. In India, the generic version is also made by Torrent Pharmaceuticals, Lupin Laboratories and Microlab?s.

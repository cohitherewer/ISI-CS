 Sonia stick

 New Delhi, Nov. 9: Sonia Gandhi has made it clear she wants members of a recently constituted in-house Congress task force to delve deeper into the Naxalite problem, reports our special correspondent.

 The Congress chief virtually told the members of the task force here this afternoon that she is not interested in a routine report based on their interactions with chief ministers, ministers and bureaucrats in various state capitals.

 ?You should meet with cross sections of people in Naxal(ite) affected areas? to understand the extreme Left phenomena to come up with useful suggestions to remedy the problem,? Sonia reportedly told the members.

 Cotton crack in honeymoon

 K. SUBRAHMANYA

 Digras (Yavatmal), Oct. 8: The tug-of-war for control over cotton co-operatives in Vidarbha has cracked up the honeymoon between the Congress and its poll partner in this constituency.

 Without bothering to offer any facesaver, both parties have separately fielded candidates for Digras, almost 800 km from Mumbai. While the NCP has fielded Khawaja Mastan Baig, the Congress candidate is Baliram Rathod, a prominent leader associated with local cotton co-operative societies.

 This is the only seat in Maharashtra in which the partners are openly contesting each other.

 Ostensibly, the two parties are believed to be having differences over the relative strength of the other in the seat. The NCP ? its 1999 candidate Baig lost narrowly to Independent Sanjay Deshmukh ? is not willing to give the Congress a second chance as it had left the seat to its partner Bharipa Bahujan Mahasangh five years ago, which ended up a poor fourth.

 But the buzz here is that the NCP is aiming to wrest control of the cotton co-operatives by taking a shot at political power. Its stranglehold on sugar co-operatives in west Maharashtra is regarded the source of its strength in the region.

 Top leaders of both parties are believed to be aware of the squabble but have studiously avoided referring to it or going to the constituency for campaigning. 

 Early this week, Sonia Gandhi addressed a meeting in the Yavatmal district headquarters but chose to focus on generally improving the lot of farmers. NCP leader Praful Patel also toured the area yesterday but bypassed Digras.

 The differences have spilt over into two other seats in nearby areas. In Morshi in neighbouring Amrawati district, the official candidate of the combine is Naresh Thakore. But Harshvardhan Deshmukh, the chairman of the statutory Vidarbha development board and a former state agriculture minister, has been fielded as the NCP?s ?unofficial? candidate.

 On paper, the party has ?expelled? Deshmukh for defiantly entering the fray as an Independent. But in fact, he is the right hand of NCP boss Sharad Pawar?s nephew Ajit and is getting all the support required to fight the election.

 The Congress has got its own back in Kamleshwar constituency on the outskirts of Nagpur. Here, sitting NCP legislator Ramesh Bang is the official candidate of the combine but Congress leader and Nagpur zilla parishad president Anita Gawande is contesting as an Independent. As with Harshvardhan, she has been ?expelled? from the party. But the Congress is believed to be leaving no stone unturned to ensure her victory.

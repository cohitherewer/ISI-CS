 Teenager killed in shootout

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Dec. 21: One teenager was killed and three persons injured after they were caught in a crossfire between two rival gangs in the Sultanganj area of the capital this morning.

 Sultanganj police said the firing between the rival gangs of Mintu alias Akbar and Aslam killed a teenaged boy, Raju, and left three others injured around 10 in the morning.

 The incident took place minutes after Laloo Prasad Yadav announced the postponement of the December 23 rally, giving rise to rumours that a group of enraged RJD workers were responsible for the shootout.

 Trader Anjar Ahmad, one of the injured, said he felt something hit his legs while he was standing near a betel shop. All the injured persons are being treated at Patna Medical College and Hospital.

 Soon after the incident, an angry mob surrounded the police station and raised slogans. The situation is normal now, police said. 

 Police have sealed the houses of some of the suspects but are yet to arrest anyone in this connection.

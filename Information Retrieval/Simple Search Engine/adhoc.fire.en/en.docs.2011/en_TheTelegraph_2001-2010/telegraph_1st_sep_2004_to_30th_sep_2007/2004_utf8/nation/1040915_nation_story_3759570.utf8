 Retrial order takes shine off VHP tridents

 BASANT RAWAT

 Ahmedabad, Sept. 14: The tridents rarely glint in the sun nowadays.

 Times have changed for Vishwa Hindu Parishad leaders who not so long ago flaunted their own brand of militant Hinduism. Now all they do is talk? and talk. In furtive murmurs within the fast-eroding safety of their office walls.

 ?They come, they meet and then decide to meet again. That has been the routine of our leaders for the last few weeks,? says a VHP worker.

 The change in the once brazen ranks has come after the Supreme Court?s stern order to the Gujarat government to reopen some 2,000 riot cases. The same people who thought the long arm of the law would never reach them now seem to have sensed the inevitable.

 ?Our arrest is a matter of time,? says Babu Bajrangi, an accused in the Naroda-Patia massacre.

 Bajrangi and Jaydeep Patel, another senior VHP leader, were spotted in the mob that killed 89 people in Naroda-Patia on February 28, 2002. 

 That was the day after the Godhra train massacre in which 59 people were burnt alive. The carnage triggered the riots.

 ?Along with Jaydeep Patel and Naroda MLA Mayaben Kodnani, I could be arrested any moment,? Bajrangi says. ?There is no way we can escape.?

 The 41-year-old, who spent more than six months in jail for alleged involvement in the Naroda-Patia massacre and was released on bail, fears that more than 25,000 VHP and Bajrang Dal workers will be put behind bars once police begin to reopen the cases they had closed. 

 After the riots, over 40,000 VHP and Dal activists were arrested in the state for creating communal disturbance.

 Last Friday, the city police arrested two VHP workers on charges of leading a mob that had attacked a police patrol on March 15, 2002. No arrests were made after the incident as the investigating officer said in his report that there was no evidence against the two.

 But the situation has changed and the VHP and Dal activists can sense it. They also realise nobody can stop the law from taking its course. ?Even the BJP and RSS leaders are not very concerned about us,? Bajrangi says, barely concealing his anger. He has vowed to teach these leaders a lesson.

 Yesterday, another shiver ran down the spine of all those involved in the riots when Gujarat High Court issued notices to the state government, the director-general of police, the collector and superintendent of police of Sabarkantha district. 

 The notices followed a petition that challenged the inaction of authorities in arresting BJP leader Jethabhai Patel, accused of leading a mob that torched Muslim houses in Jamala village.

 VHP state general secretary Dilip Trivedi, however, seems unconcerned about the law catching up. ?We are born fighters. We fight for the cause of Hindutva. Even if some of our members are arrested, that does not prove they are guilty. We are innocent, we will prove it in court, even if the cases are transferred to any part of the world,? he says, referring to some of the cases the apex court has transferred out of the state.

 But Bajrangi, who has floated a new outfit ? the Navchetan Group ? to take up what he calls the Hindutva cause more aggressively, says VHP leaders are perturbed that riot victims have begun to speak out.

 ?What we worry now,? he says, ?is that the victims and witnesses might tell the truth. If they tell the investigating officers they were pressurised not to name certain people, we will be in trouble.?

 This is what the VHP leaders fear the most. And so the huddled murmurs at Vanikarbhavan, the outfit?s state headquarters, before they disperse ?without deciding anything?.

 They have nothing to decide, they can only wait, because the hunter has become the hunted.

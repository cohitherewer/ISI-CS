 Pak plan blow to travel ease

 PRANAY SHARMA

 New Delhi, Oct. 29: Pervez Musharraf?s Kashmir peace proposals seem to have aborted any adjustment India could have made in looking for alternatives to passports for the proposed Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus service.

 In his ?out-of-the-box? thinking to resolve the Kashmir problem, the Pakistan President had suggested changing the status of the state?s different regions, including those under Pakistani occupation, with options ranging from joint control to independence.

 But indications are the Indian position has toughened after Musharraf?s proposals. Delhi has all along been opposed to using travel documents other than passports for the proposed bus service.

 ?Musharraf?s proposal has made it clear that Pakistan?s gameplan is to get the Indian side to accept a proposal that will establish Jammu and Kashmir to be a disputed area and its status being different from other parts of India,? a source said.

 The two sides are scheduled to meet on December 7 and 8 in Delhi to discuss ways to start the bus service between the two Kashmirs.

 The proposal was made last year. But differences on the travel document have stood in the way of implementation.

 India?s opposition to accepting documents other than passport stems from a number of worries, the main being the strong doubt about Pakistan?s seriousness in allowing the service to get off the ground.

 Delhi has reasons enough to believe that Islamabad has been trying to ensure that Kashmiris do not show much enthusiasm for the service.

 India argues in favour of passports because it is part of an ongoing arrangement that the people have been using all these years to travel to each other?s countries.

 In recent weeks, Pakistani journalists, including those from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, pilgrims, and members of their Scouts and Guides used passports to visit Jammu and Kashmir. 

 ?The only aim is to make the journey between the two countries, including by those on the two sides of Kashmir, easier,? a source said.

 Questions are being raised why Pakistan is insisting on documents other than passport because it had not asked for any other travel paper all these years when its nationals visited different Indian states, including Kashmir.

 Proposals ? as made by Pakistan ? that people of Kashmir be allowed to travel on documents and identity cards issued by the local authority are fraught with complications for the future.

 Accepting such documents not only dilutes the authority of the passport-issuing authority but also creates a situation where a person?s nationality may not be clearly verified and established.

 The exercise of issuing a passport takes care of verifying nationality. ?It may have its drawbacks but the existing (system) is the best we have at the moment,? a source said.

 Over the years, Pakistan has made a conscious effort to resettle Punjabis from other parts of the country to regions in PoK to bring about a demographic change. 

 An identity card issued by an authority in PoK may not only allow a person to travel by the bus service but also create a difficult situation if he/she refuses to go back.

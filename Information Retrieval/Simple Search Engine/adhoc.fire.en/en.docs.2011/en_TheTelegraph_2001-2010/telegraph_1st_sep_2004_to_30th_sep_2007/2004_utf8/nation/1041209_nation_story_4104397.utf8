 Army 

call for Bofors upgrade

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 8: The army has made a case to upgrade its Bofors Howitzers and almost its entire artillery. The Bofors 155 mm guns were inducted in the army 18 years ago and served with distinction in the 1999 Kargil war but allegations that the Swedish company paid kickbacks to win the contract in 1986 saw the firm blacklisted.

 The vice-chief of army staff, Lt General Shantanou Choudhry, said here today that ?upgradation of 130 mm guns to 155 mm 45 calibre guns was a prudent decision and needs to be pursued with vigour; in this regard, we need to think about Bofors guns as well, which by now have served the Indian Army for almost 18 years?.

 While it was important to induct new systems, he said, it was also necessary to upgrade existing ones. In this connection, he called for improvements to the Bofors guns which need ?immediate upgradation?.

 The Indian Army has been examining offers from gun manufacturers for a huge order that will result in its artillery being largely overhauled. 

 The defence establishment is in talks with manufacturers, chiefly Denel of South Africa and SWS Defence Systems that now owns Bofors, to induct the 155 mm/45 calibre self-propelled and 155 mm/52 calibre towed guns. Both Denel and Bofors have held field demonstrations of their guns.

 SWS was formed after Bofors AB, stigmatised in India since the allegation of a Rs 64-crore kickback in 1986, transferred first to the Celsius group and subsequently to United Defense, a US conglomerate in 1998. 

 Since the Kargil war, in which the Bofors FH 77b 155 mm towed Howitzer is acknowledged to have fared very well, SWS has been more enthusiastic about reviving business ties with India.

 SWS has offered to upgrade the Howitzers delivered to India under the 1986 agreement. 

 It had received a request for proposal to upgrade the Howitzers with the Indian Army in December 2001 and the company gave field trials in 2002.

 Singh thaw for Hurriyat

 ALOKE TIKKU

 New Delhi, Nov. 10: Manmohan Singh will keep his date with Kashmir.

 The Prime Minister?s two-day visit to the state from next Wednesday is expected to break the ice between the government and the All Parties Hurriyat Conference, which has stayed away from the talks table.

 Union home minister Shivraj Patil met Singh this evening and is learnt to have briefed him on his assessment of the situation in Jammu and Kashmir during his recent three-day trip to the state. Sources said his appraisal included the positive feedback Patil received on the Centre?s stand of keeping its doors open for talks with all separatist groups, including the Hurriyat.

 Patil is also expected to clear the air on the home ministry ?document? circulated at his news conference in Jammu that spoke of the Hurriyat staying away from talks under pressure from Pakistan. The document was originally prepared as a background material for the parliamentary consultative committee that met in Delhi last week and provoked strong reactions from the foreign ministry in Islamabad and the Hurriyat.

 According to one account, when Patil ordered distribution of the background material that largely dealt with statistics of violent incidents declining in the state, he was not aware that it contained references to the Hurriyat?s reluctance to come to the talks table and its links with Pakistan. The document was first released in Delhi last week.

 In Jammu, however, it was highlighted by the media, prompting the home minister to go into a shell on the subject. Patil, it is said, wanted to ensure that he did not say anything that could ruin the efforts being made to bring the Hurriyat to the negotiating table.

 Some officials, however, insisted that the government needed to send this message loud and clear to the separatists. This section within the government contends that the Hurriyat?s links with Pakistan were too well known for anyone in the separatist conglomerate to be offended by the home ministry report.

 This is not the first time that the ministry has made uncharitable remarks against the Hurriyat in writing. Its latest annual report that recounts the first two rounds of meeting with former deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani also indicated that the conglomerate was a paper tiger without any mass following.

 ?None of the factions enjoy mass popular support in Jammu and Kashmir except for support in small pockets where individual Hurriyat leaders have influence,? the report released a few months ago said. It did not provoke any reaction from the Hurriyat.

 However, it is being suggested that the Hurriyat, despite its public pronouncements, would not let the controversy influence it when it decides whether to call on the Prime Minister.

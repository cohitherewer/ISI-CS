 Sena ire

 Mumbai, Dec. 11: The Shiv Sena would like to carry through the Veer Savarkar issue.

 Sainiks went on the rampage today at a meeting that was to be addressed by Union petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar. Police lathi-charged the Sena men twice and brought in the riot police.

 The minister had stopped the installation of Savarkar?s words at Cellular Jail in the Andamans. The Sainiks have been agitating over the issue over the year, especially over the Assembly polls. 

 Aiyar, who was to address a meeting at Wadala, reached the meeting only at 5.30 pm, an hour after the scheduled time.

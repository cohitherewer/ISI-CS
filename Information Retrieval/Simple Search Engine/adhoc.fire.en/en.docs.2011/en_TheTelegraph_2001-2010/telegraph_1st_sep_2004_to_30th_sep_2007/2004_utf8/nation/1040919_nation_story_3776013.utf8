 Delhi defends quiet burial to Bofors case

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bharadwaj

 New Delhi, Sept. 18: Union law minister H.R. Bharadwaj has defended the decision of the CBI?s law department not to file an appeal in the Bofors case.

 On February 4, 2004, a Delhi High Court order exonerated the late Rajiv Gandhi and rejected the ?conspiracy theory? involving him and the Hinduja brothers in obtaining commission from Bofors for the supply of howitzers. 

 ?This particular case has become a phobia with some people. So much money has been wasted on it and so much advantage has been taken by political parties of it,? Bharadwaj said, briefing newsmen about the conference of chief ministers and chief justices held at the high-security Vigyan Bhawan here today after 11 years.

 Explaining why the government had chosen not to appeal against the court order, the minister said: ?The law agencies concerned were responsible for taking such a decision. I am in no way involved in this. You ask CBI why it did not file the appeal.?

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had earlier said at the conference that his government ?will not go in for unnecessary appeals?.

 Bharadwaj blamed the National Democratic Alliance government for not deciding on an appeal within the 90-day limitation period, which ended before the Congress-led regime came to power.

 As if to ?politically neutralise? the issue, the minister was quick to point out: ?The NDA government had taken a decision not to file an appeal in the dropping of charges against then deputy Prime Minister .K. Advani in the case pertaining to the demolition of the disputed structure at Ayodhya.?

 He added that it is always the prerogative of the law agency concerned to decide whether to appeal. ?In every case, the prosecutors go by the merits and demerits of it and being a counsel myself, I can say preferring an appeal depends on the individual merits of the case,? he said.

 Speaking about the resolutions passed at the conference, Bharadwaj said over Rs 1,000 crore would soon be pumped into lower courts across India for modernisation. Most of this would be spent in installing computers and Internet facilities, including video conferencing for recording evidence. ?This is a major step in the modernisation of courts in our country,? he said.

 Bharadwaj said district-level lower judiciary and even mofussil and munsif courts would get computers.

 The resolution passed by consensus said the Centre should take all steps to ensure ?full computerisation of courts up to the district level?.

 It said the central government should ensure ?use of the latest available technologies, including video conferencing and digital signatures, creation of database of pending cases for generating live statistics, a litigant-friendly availability of information through Internet, websites of all high courts and facilitation centres in or around court buildings?.

 The resolution said ?court management, database management and knowledge management must be encouraged? and annual reports published by all courts. 

 It favoured fast track courts for speedy disposal of cases. The resolution also called for developing and encouraging alternate dispute resolution methods so that the backlog of cases is addressed.

 Ticket to credit card fraud

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Sept. 26: The 

 misuse of the railway?s online booking system to make a 

 fast buck has come to light following the arrest of a 22-year-old 

 here.

 Deepak Agarwal, a regular Internet surfer, was helping a friend book a ticket from a cyber cafe using the online system of the Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) when he discovered that he could manipulate the process to make money.

 Deepak booked four tickets on September 13 and three on September 16 (some being of more than one traveller), in the name of one Sameer Malhotra, for Rs 52,000.

 He visited the IRCTC website and used credit card numbers of persons he knew ? Sameer was one ? to pay for the tickets. He logged on to the website of the credit card company and randomly punched three digits to know the card verification number, which is necessary to use a card for such purposes. Once the site responded favourably, he knew he had cracked the code. He then used the card to book the tickets.

 Deepak would either give a friend?s address or furnish a fake address at which the tickets were to be delivered. When the deliveries were made to his friend?s house, he would collect the tickets from there.

 In case of fake addresses, he would wait till the courier returned, unable to locate the address. Deepak would then visit its office and collect the tickets. He would later return them at booking counters and collect the money.

 Out of the seven tickets that Deepak had booked, four were delivered while three were held back by IRCTC following complaints from credit card holders that tickets they had not requisitioned were booked in their name and money deducted from their accounts.

 The joint general manager (operation) railways, J. Vinayanan, said the user name through which the tickets had been booked was identified as Deepak?s and traced through the department?s Internet surveillance system.

 The case was then handed over to the police. The Lucknow senior superintendent of police, Kamal Saxena, said an Internet savvy officer of the Special Operations Group was asked to investigate.

 The officer located the cyber cafe from which the bookings were made in Hazratganj in downtown Lucknow. Saxena said Deepak, who was picked up from the cyber cafe had confessed.

 Vinayanan said such frauds had earlier been detected in cities such as Hyderabad and Delhi but this was the first such case in Lucknow.

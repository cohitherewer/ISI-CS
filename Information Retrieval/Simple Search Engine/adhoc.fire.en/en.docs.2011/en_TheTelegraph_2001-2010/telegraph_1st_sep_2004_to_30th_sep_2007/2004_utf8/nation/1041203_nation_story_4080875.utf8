 Basu : Tape trouble

 New Delhi, Dec. 2: Former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Kalyan Singh today sought a day to file his reply on the audio and video tapes produced by Jyoti Basu before the Liberhan Commission probing the factors leading to the demolition of the Babri Masjid. 

 During his deposition last year, Basu had produced the tapes to argue before the commission that Singh felt ?happy? about the demolition and going by a speech made in Calcutta, it was a planned move. 

 In the speech at a Calcutta rally in 1993, the BJP leader, who was chief minister of Uttar Pradesh when the mosque was pulled down, had purportedly said he had ?no regrets? over the demolition of the disputed structure in Ayodhya. 

 This portion of the tape was played today in the commission?s inquiry room at the high-security Vigyan Bhavan here. 

 Singh listened with rapt attention and at the end of it, sought a day?s time to file his reply. 

 His request was granted by Justice M.S. Liberhan. 

 Singh told the commission that he would not file the affidavit he had come prepared with and it was ?necessary to modify? it to include answers to the points raised by the CPM leader. 

 Outside the inquiry commission hall, Singh admitted that the ?voice in the tape? was his and that he had made the speech on February 2, 1993. 

 He refused further comment, saying that all points would be answered in his affidavit. 

 He had consistently refused to appear before the commission, arguing that his deposition would prejudice his defence in the criminal case relating to the demolition. 

 He believed that his statements before the commission would be taken advantage of in the criminal case against him in the trial court. 

 Singh had petitioned Delhi High Court against summons issued by the commission, but it was dismissed this June, prompting his deposition before the Liberhan Commission.

 Pak warms to Somnath plan

 KAY BENEDICT

 New Delhi, Sept. 1: A delegation from Pakistan has responded positively to a suggestion by Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee to form a joint parliamentary friendship forum that could help speed up the peace process between the neighbours.

 Sources said as peoples representatives, the members of the proposed panel could hold talks in a tension-free environment without the constraints of realpolitik and exert pressure on the Indian and Pakistani governments to end hostilities.

 Chatterjee broached the subject with the delegation that called on him on Monday. The sources said the team, which included the former Speaker of the National Assembly, Gohar Ayub Khan, was receptive to the proposal. Khan, they added, told Chatterjee it was a valuable suggestion and the Indian leader could nominate a team to communicate with the National Assembly Speaker to set up the forum or, alternatively, a request could originate from the Pakistan House.

 Chatterjee, who stressed the need for dialogue, said the forum could facilitate frequent interaction among parliamentarians of both countries and strengthen people-to-people contact. He told the 19-member delegation that the Indian government was vigorously pursuing the peace process to normalise relations but talks at various levels would go a long way in reflecting the mood of the people.

 The Speaker appreciated the keen desire of the visiting team to learn how Parliament functions.

 Khan said there was tremendous potential to be tapped in both countries and, if utilised properly, they could emerge as strong nations in Asia. We, the neighbours, can remain as good friends by developing mutual trust, friendship and exchanges, he said.

 The visitors also requested Chatterjee to publish the rulings from the Chair so that parliamentarians of Pakistan and Bangladesh could use them as reference.

 The delegation, which was here on a study tour, appreciated the collection in the Parliament library and hoped that Pakistani parliamentarians could benefit from the wealth of information it contains.

 Calcutta lifts TN pilgrims

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Palani (Tamil Nadu), Nov. 14: Pilgrims in Palani are ensured a quick elevating experience, thanks to a Calcutta company that has installed an electric cablecar here.

 Inaugurated on November 3 by chief minister Jayalalithaa, the new service ?has already generated a tremendous response? among people who want to skip the 693 stone-steps from the foothills to the ancient Dandayuthapani Swami temple, 1,500 ft above sea level.

 Though pilgrims fulfilling a specific vow will still take the steps, the others can hop on to one of the 24 cabins ?four persons to each ? that glide up 323 metres in less than three minutes amid the scenic Kodaikanal Hills and the Western Ghats.

 It will be a ?great time saver? during peak seasons ? when the daily rush could touch 10 lakh ? as it can carry up to 800 people an hour, said Sundaram, the temple?s joint commissioner.

 Calcutta-based Ropeways Resorts Private Ltd executed the Rs 4-crore project for the ?richest temple? in Tamil Nadu with an annual income of Rs 30 crore.

 After extensive tests, the cablecar was certified ?sound, safe and secure? by a technical appraisal panel set up by the state, Sundaram said. It included experts from BHEL?s structural and welding research institute in Tiruchirappalli.

 The iron rope on which the cablecar runs was specially tested and certified by RITES India, a subsidiary of the Indian Railways, he added.

 Powercuts, if any, have also been taken care of, the temple official said, as a 125-kv generator is on standby for emergencies. The new service will be especially of help to the aged and the ailing as also the physically handicapped who want to have a ?darshan? of Lord Murugan in his third most sacred hill abode of the six in Tamil Nadu.

 The deity?s idol is believed to have medicinal and curative properties, Sundaram said. A lift has been provided at the landing point atop the hill for the indisposed to reach the temple entrance directly, he added.

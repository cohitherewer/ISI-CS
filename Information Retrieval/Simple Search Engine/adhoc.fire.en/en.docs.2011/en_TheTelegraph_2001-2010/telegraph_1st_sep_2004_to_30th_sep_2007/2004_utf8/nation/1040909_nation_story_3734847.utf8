 Thackeray covers up for nephew

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Sept. 8: Bal Thackeray is trying hard to pour oil over waters troubled by nephew Raj?s statement yesterday that he wanted to be chief minister.

 ?It is too early to say who the chief minister will be,? said the Shiv Sena leader in an interview in today?s Saamna, the party mouthpiece, without naming anyone.

 ?But I want to make it very clear that I will give Maharashtra (in case the Sena comes to power) an able and efficient chief minister. His priority will be development and social welfare,? he added.

 Party spokesperson Subhas Desai also tried to stem the row. ?Those were Raj Thackeray?s personal views,? he said.

 The statement clearly shows that the Sena is still divided into two camps that could cost the party dear at the Assembly elections on October 13.

 Raj?s statement came a day after reports that the Sena will put up two chief ministerial candidates: Thackeray?s son, Sena executive president and projected heir-apparent Uddhav and former chief minister Narayan Rane.

 Sena sources said that in case there was a clear victory for the Sena-BJP combine, Uddhav would be made chief minister. 

 If the victory were not emphatic enough, Rane would be the chief minister.

 New Delhi, Nov. 30: From tomorrow they will start fighting. So today, they played.

 On the eve of what promises to be a stormy winter session, MPs cutting across party lines found a unique way to ease tension and get to know each other ? through games.

 They played table tennis and badminton and showed off their skill in rifle shooting. The coming weeks would see sack races to balancing a lemon in a spoon. And, of course, kabaddi ? the real test of lungpower.

 That parliamentary affairs minister Ghulam Nabi Azad?s idea was a hit was clear from the words of Naveen Jindal. ?We could take the sportsman?s spirit inside Parliament,? said the young MP who won the first prize for shooting.

 Sports minister Sunil Dutt congratulated Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee, who kicked off the Parliamentarians Sports Meet at the Siri Fort sports complex here, and Azad for organising the event. 

 Both Dutt and Jindal said such meets could act as a catalyst in lowering temperatures in the House.

 The sports meet will be held whenever the House is in session and the disciplines will change every week. The parliamentary affairs ministry has identified 24, including cricket, swimming, golf and three-legged race. The lemon in spoon race is for ladies only while kabaddi is reserved for the gentlemen.

 Thirty-two MPs turned up for the inauguration while the 20 who participated in the games included both GeNext MPs and veterans. 

 Among those from the Congress were Jindal, Jyotiraditya Scindia, Jitin Prasada, Rajiv Shukla, senior cabinet ministers Shivraj Patil, Azad and P.M. Sayeed, and Rajya Sabha deputy chairperson Rehman Khan. 

 The BJP members included Jual Oram, Lalit Suri, Sharad Anantrao Joshi and Chandra Pratap Singh. 

 Among the others were Union health minister Anbumani Ramadoss (PMK) R. Chandra Sekar Reddy (Telugu Desam Party ) and B.J. Panda (BJD).

 Azad had written to all MPs on October 18 telling them of his plans to hold the sports meet to de-stress tired minds. After the contests today, young Jitin said it was ?fantastic?. ?We got to know senior MPs in an informal way.?

 ?Great idea,? concurred Panda. ?Members could get to know each other well.?

 But what many are really looking forward to is seeing Sonia Gandhi, Sushma Swaraj, Uma Bharti, Mamata Banerjee and Mayavati with spoons in their mouth holding a lemon or trying to run in a sack. There has been no confirmation yet from the parliamentary affairs ministry whether these leaders have expressed their willingness to participate.

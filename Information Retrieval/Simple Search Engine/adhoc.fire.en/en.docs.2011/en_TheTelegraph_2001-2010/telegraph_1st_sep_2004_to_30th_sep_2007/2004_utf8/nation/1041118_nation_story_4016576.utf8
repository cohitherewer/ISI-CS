 BJP to go it alone in Haryana

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 17: The BJP has decided to fight the Haryana elections on its own and will have no truck with former ally, the ruling Indian National Lok Dal.

 Party sources scotched speculation that Sushma Swaraj, who belongs to Ambala, would be projected as the BJP?s chief ministerial candidate.

 It was decided to go it alone at a meeting this morning between BJP chief L.K. Advani, some of his office-bearers and Haryana leaders.

 Spokesman Arun Jaitley said the decision was ?unanimous? and there was no conflict between the high command, which wanted to revive the alliance with the INLD, and the state BJP unit, which was against a tie-up. ?The party is fairly clear and definitive about this,? he said.

 Haryana BJP sources said the Om Prakash Chautala government was ?highly unpopular on every count? and faced a ?strong? anti-incumbency wave. ?It is specially disliked by our voters who live in urban areas and represent the upper castes,? they added. It is feared the chief minister?s unpopularity could trigger a Congress landslide.

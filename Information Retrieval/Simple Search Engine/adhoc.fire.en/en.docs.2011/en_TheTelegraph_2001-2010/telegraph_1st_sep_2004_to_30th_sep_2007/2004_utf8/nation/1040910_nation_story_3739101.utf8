 Excess funds for Andhra 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, Sept. 9: The Union rural development minister today said Andhra Pradesh was paid Rs 300 crore more under the Sampoorna Gramin Rozgar Yojana during M. Venkaiah Naidu?s tenure in the ministry.

 ?Against a sanctioned amount of Rs 90 crore, Rs 190 crore had been released annually, giving the state an advantage of Rs 300-crore worth SGRY budget additionally,? Raghuvansh Prasad Singh said here today. The grant was released for the three fiscal years from 2000-01, he added.

 Asked how it happened, Singh alleged that ?someone in the ministry or in the office of the minister had added ?1? in the document before the figure of Rs 90 crore to make it Rs 190 crore?.

 ?Even if it was a typo, it is astounding that none in the minister?s office or the ministry noticed it for three years. Neither the minister, Naidu, or (then) Andhra chief minister Chandrababu Naidu had chosen to speak about the blunder,? he said.

 ?The blunder,? Singh added, ?was rectified when Naidu was replaced by Shanta Kumar in the ministry.?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Here too, Pakistan factor at play 

 Hostage crisis

 K.P. NAYAR

 Washington, Sept. 14: On 

 July 28, exactly a week after Antaryami, Tilak Raj and Sukhdev 

 Singh were taken hostage in Iraq, South Block was jolted 

 into the realisation that it could no longer continue to 

 act like Nero. 

 It had to stop fiddling. Iraq 

 was burning. So would the three Indian truckers unless more 

 was done ?- and done quickly.

 The government was forced into 

 action when B.B. Tyagi, the Indian ambassador, told the 

 ministry of external affairs (MEA) that on that day kidnappers 

 had executed a Pakistani engineer and his compatriot driver, 

 freeing an Iraqi who was also taken hostage with the two 

 Pakistanis.

 The next day, India issued a 

 travel advisory against its citizens travelling to Iraq. 

 Shyam Saran, who was to take charge as new foreign secretary 

 in four days, has been pressing E. Ahmed, South Block?s 

 junior minister at the centre of the crisis, that India 

 should depute a special envoy to Baghdad to get to grips 

 directly with the problem.

 On July 31, Talmiz Ahmad, India?s 

 ambassador in Muscat was sent to Baghdad to take up that 

 role. It made no sense for India to continue to insist that 

 it would not talk to the captors of the three Indians. 

 When an Indian Airlines plane 

 was hijacked at Christmas time in 1999 and eventually taken 

 to Kandahar, did anyone insist that no talks would be held 

 with the hijackers? 

 Or, for that matter, would fuel 

 have been refused for a hijacked plane running low on fuel 

 on the ground that it was against policy to talk to terrorists?

 These arguments by officials who 

 disagreed with the strategy thus far to free the three Indians 

 carried weight and prodded the government into action.

 The execution of the two Pakistanis 

 had an effect similar to the killing of Rupin Katyal, a 

 passenger on board the Indian Airlines plane hijacked in 

 1999. It suddenly dawned on the crisis management group 

 that history could revisit them after almost five years.

 The episode was a reminder of 

 how much Pakistan is a factor in any aspect of Indian diplomacy 

 that it was the execution of two Pakistanis that finally 

 prompted the government to take another look at its strategy 

 in the hostage crisis.

 As usual, there was no shortage 

 of conspiracy theorists in South Block who insisted that 

 since the two Pakistanis had been killed, Islamabad would 

 play dirty and do what it can to see that the three Indians 

 do not get out of their ordeal alive.

 Once ambassador Ahmad got to Baghdad, 

 secured the services of his trusted translator Zikr-ur-Rahman 

 and Saran assumed charge as foreign secretary, these three 

 men were at the core of the efforts to free the truckers. 

 The crisis Management group continued 

 to be the public face that dealt with the problem, leaving 

 these three men to do what they thought was best with just 

 one aim in mind: take the three Indians back home alive.

 The first thing that Ahmad and 

 Rahman went about doing in Baghdad was to find alternatives 

 to Sheikh Hisham al-Dulami, who had acquired a copyright 

 of sorts in getting hostages freed in Iraq where no one?s 

 writ ran in much of the country. It was good business for 

 the ?good Samaritan? sheikh.

 Ahmad and Rahman realised by the 

 time they entered the picture that the entire negotiations 

 between the sheikh and Kuwait Gulf Link (KGL), employers 

 of the truckers, had been reduced to nothing but money. 

 The sheikh was interested in how 

 much money could be extracted from KGL and the company was 

 merely looking for ways to put this crisis behind them so 

 that they could continue to mint money from transport contracts 

 in Iraq.

 Ahmad dug into his extensive contacts 

 in the region, including some in Iraq dating back more than 

 25 years when he was a second secretary at the Indian embassy 

 in Baghdad and India was a trusted friend of the Iraqis. 

 They found new Iraqi negotiators 

 who were willing to work for the freedom of the three Indians 

 without any motive of profit. Rahman was tasked to follow 

 up and act on these new tracks of negotiations.

 But there was a new problem. KGL 

 was unwilling, at any cost, to give up its contracts in 

 Iraq. 

 Swashpawan Singh, the Indian ambassador 

 in Kuwait, was given the task of securing a commitment from 

 KGL that it would at least issue a statement of intent to 

 stop trucking to Iraq.

 He was also given the brief to 

 negotiate with KGL the amount it would pay as ransom. Neither 

 task was easy. Singh was second secretary in Kabul just 

 before the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and handled that 

 country from New Delhi in the tumultuous days after the 

 invasion.

 He put to use some of the lessons 

 learned from those years. 

 Through a combination of threats, 

 inducements and appeals, Singh got KGL to declare an end 

 to its business in Iraq and ensured that half a million 

 dollars was paid to secure freedom for the three Indians.

 When the three Indian drivers 

 landed in Delhi and were met by the minister of state for 

 external affairs at the airport, the first thing one of 

 the freed Indians said was that they were thankful to Rahman. 

 Most of those in the receiving party did not grasp what 

 he said. Some interpreted it as a variation of thanking 

 God in Arabic. It was a tribute to the MEA translator who 

 actually negotiated their freedom after a 42-day ordeal 

 even though South Block continues to insist that it never 

 talked to the hostage-takers.

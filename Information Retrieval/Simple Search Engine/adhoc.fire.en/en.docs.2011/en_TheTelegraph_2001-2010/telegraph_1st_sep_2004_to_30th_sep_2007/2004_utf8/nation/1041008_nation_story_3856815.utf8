 Flight forsakes, another rescues

 DEBABRATA MOHANTY

 Bhubaneswar, Oct. 7: An 

 Alliance Air plane flew over Bhubaneswar to Chennai today, 

 leaving its passengers behind at the Biju Patnaik Airport.

 The CD-7542 Calcutta-Chennai flight was scheduled to land here at 1.40 pm and pick up 36 passengers.

 The travellers, who had arrived at the airport as early as 11.30 in the morning, were forced to wait for around 10 hours without any information. 

 Their ordeal ended when a Union minister used his influence to divert a direct Calcutta-Chennai flight (IC 765) via Bhubaneswar.

 The authorities had decided to take the Alliance flight to Vizag, citing bad weather and ?lack of night-landing facility? at the airport here, and then bring it to Bhubaneswar. 

 The captain of the flight, however, did not stop at Vizag as the weather there was not any better. It flew straight to Chennai.

 The stranded passengers, among whom were senior executives of the National Aluminium Company, the chief executive of a pharma company, a senior manager of Infosys, an ageing patient and at least two doctors, complained of shabby treatment by the airport authorities.

 In Bhubaneswar, the passengers were told that bad weather had delayed the flight. ?At 3.15 pm, the airport authorities put up a board saying the flight would leave at 5.35 pm. Then suddenly at 5 pm, a senior official at the airport said that there was no flight for Chennai while another contradicted him. It was all so confusing,? complained Nithya Prabhakar, the excellence manager (operations and execution) of Infosys.

 As the hours wore on, passengers began to get panicky. Some called the airport manager in Calcutta asking for help. But their pleas fell on deaf ears. ?When we requested the Calcutta airport manager to put us on the Chennai-bound IC 765 flight, they gave us a thousand excuses. We spoke to the regional director (operations) at 6.30 pm. He told us he was unaware of the whole thing,? said a passenger. 

 In Calcutta, Prabhakar?s friend called up a Union minister from Bengal, who asked the regional director to get all the stranded passengers on board.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Teachers? rulebook ready 

 - Code effective in a month

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, Dec. 20: The code of conduct for teachers of state-aided secondary schools, which includes the ban on private tuition, has been published in the West Bengal government?s gazette and is ready to be effected. 

 School education minister Kanti Biswas told the Assembly today: ?The code will come into effect after a month because according to rules, all new regulations are effective from a month after the notification. 

 Each and every teacher of state-aided schools affiliated to the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education is expected to abide by the new set professional ethics.? Once in effect, the teachers will not be allowed to offer any kind of coaching to students anywhere outside classrooms.

 They will be penalised in different ways depending on the gravity of misconduct. The penalties may vary from suspension, to freeze on increments and dismissal.

 The minister revealed that the code was ready to be put into force while replying to the Congress? Kamal Mukherjee during question hour. 

 Once implemented, the code will empower the board to direct managing committees of affiliated schools to take action against teachers if they violate the rules. The board will also have the right to cancel the affiliation of a school if it disobeys a directive.

 Earlier, it could not take any action against the school managing committees, even 

 if they violated its orders regarding action against errant teachers. 

 Though the government provides the salaries to teachers of state-aided schools, the decision of managing committees was final as far as teachers? punishment was concerned because they were the official employers. The new code also suggests a string of restrictions on teachers. They have been barred from smoking, consuming intoxicating drinks or taking narcotic substances as long as in service. 

 The new rules also prohibit over 1.25 lakh teachers in about 14,000 schools from inflicting corporal punishment on students or causing them mental trauma. The code further suggests that the teachers should refrain from flamboyance in dress or display of extravagance in the institution.

 Besides, it also makes it compulsory for every teacher to perform duties pertaining to examinations conducted by the board and the institution.

 The minister said the board prepared the code after consulting major teachers? bodies in the state. A bill allowing the framing of the code was passed by the Assembly last year. Among the liberties that the teachers have been allowed, is the freedom to contest elections and form associations to protect their professional interests. They have also been granted the right to go on strikes.

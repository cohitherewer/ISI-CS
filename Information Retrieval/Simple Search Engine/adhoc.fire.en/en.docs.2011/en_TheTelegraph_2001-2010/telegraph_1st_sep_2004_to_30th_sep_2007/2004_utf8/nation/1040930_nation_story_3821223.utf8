 Poll panel damper on Haj subsidies 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 29: The Election Commission today directed the Centre to defer a decision on reviving subsidies for all categories of Haj pilgrims.

 The poll panel told the Centre to make such a move only after next month?s Assembly elections in Maharashtra and Arunachal Pradesh are over. 

 ?Any decision on providing subsidy to Haj pilgrims should be deferred till October 13,? commission spokesman A.. Jha said here today.

 He said a separate ruling would be made later.

 The Election Commission last week asked the Centre for clarifications after taking suo motu cognisance of newspaper reports quoting minister of state for home Sriprakash Jaiswal that the United Progressive Alliance government was scrapping changes made by the previous National Democratic Alliance regime on travel rules for Haj pilgrims. 

 The NDA government had in November last year withdrawn the subsidy for income-tax payees.

 The BJP opposed the UPA regime?s move, saying ?pseudo-secular forces? were appeasing minorities.

 Jaiswal announced that the Centre?s decision to restore the subsidy even as the model code of conduct came into force with the announcement of the election schedule.

 The Election Commission had forwarded newspaper reports to the cabinet secretary seeking the government?s response.

 Jaiswal had announced the Centre?s intention to restore the subsidy after meeting Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. But the decision will come into force only after the cabinet endorses it and will require a government notification.

 According to rough estimates, the subsidy could help bring down a Haj pilgrim?s travel costs to Rs 25,000 from Rs 45,000.

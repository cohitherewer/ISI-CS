 Centre fires rebel salvo at Advani

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 25: Union home ministry officials today said there is no one-size-fits-all solution to end the Naxalite menace that affects nine states.

BJP president L.K. Advani had yesterday criticised 

the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government?s handling of the Naxalite 

problem, prompting the Congress to dub his accusations as ?baseless?.

 Ministry officials have said the Centre has left it to state governments to decide if the problem can be resolved by talks or if police should step in, reckoning that they know local conditions best and are better placed to decide on a strategy to end violence. ?We have promised to back them all the way through... irrespective of the decision that they eventually make,? an official said.

 They also pointed out that the Centre cannot impose its views on regional governments. Officials said states like Andhra Pradesh that opt for the dialogue route are being given all help as are regimes that take the police option.

 Questions are also being raised over Advani criticising Andhra for not insisting that Naxalites lay down weapons before starting talks when the National Democratic Alliance government itself had allowed Northeast outfits to attend negotiations armed.

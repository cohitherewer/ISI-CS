 Wanted: Men for VIP shield

 ALOKE TIKKU

 Patil: On the job

 New Delhi, Dec. 25: The Special Protection Group ? the crack commando force that specialises in protecting people such as Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Congress president Sonia Gandhi and former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and their families ? is running short of manpower.

 The SPG wants energetic, efficient and honest police personnel with an unblemished track record but India?s police force ? in excess of 30 lakh ? has not been able to throw up much of a choice. As a result, the SPG is facing a ?substantial shortage? of manpower, according to home ministry officials, and has urged Union home minister Shivraj Patil to wave the magic wand and get it the men it needs.

 The SPG, which was raised in April 1985 with just about 800 men in the wake of Indira Gandhi?s assassination, has grown to a sanctioned strength of 3,000-plus officers on deputation who are trained to provide close security to present and former Prime Ministers and VVIPs.

 Patil is learnt to have convened a meeting of heads of central police forces to assess the requirements of the SPG and encourage the paramilitary forces to spare men for the crack group.

 However, this will not be easy, according to a senior police officer who heads a central police organisation. ?We, too, want to send more of our men on deputation to the SPG but it is difficult for us to do that any more as we are also running short of manpower,? the official said.

 The Border Security Force, the Central Reserve Police Force and the Indo-Tibetan Border Police are already operating at nearly 100 per cent deployment and are seeking permission to recruit more people. The CISF has deployed the 11,000 men that it could spare to protect airports and has retained a few hundred commandos to be deployed on VIP duties.

 A police officer said the SPG should try getting the state police forces to offer police personnel on deputation.

 However, SPG officials said they had given up on state police forces long ago. A veteran security officer, on his second assignment in the force, recalled the snappy reply from a state police officer after being told of the benefits of coming to the SPG ? ranging from a guaranteed government accommodation to a 50 per cent hike in basic salary. ?Big deal, I make that kind of money in a day.?

 Officials said the dislocation involved in coming to Delhi on a deputation of three to five years, depending on the rank, would put off most people, even those who would not earn that much in a day. ?There are just a handful of people from the state police in the SPG today,? the officer said.

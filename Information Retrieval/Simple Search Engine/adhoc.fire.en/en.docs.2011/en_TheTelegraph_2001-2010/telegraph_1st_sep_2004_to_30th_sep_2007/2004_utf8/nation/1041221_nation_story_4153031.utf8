 RJD rule for Bihar roads

 Bhagalpur, Dec. 20: Fakia Devi, wife of Ramsundar Das, a daily-wage labourer of Bounsi block in Banka district, succumbed to her burn injuries this morning after her family members could not take her to a doctor on time due to the dearth of vehicles.

 Thanks to the ?high-handedness? of the Rashtriya Janata Dal, most public transport vehicles have disappeared from the divisions of Bhagalpur, Koshi and Munger, among other places in east Bihar. While RJD workers have ?impounded? a large number of buses to ferry people to Patna for its mega rally, several operators have taken their vehicles off the roads for fear of Laloo Prasad Yadav?s men.

 In the absence of rail service in the rural pockets of the three divisions, commuters are forced to wait for Bihar State Road Transport Corporation buses, which are few in number and cannot be relied upon.

 Today, scores of commuters could be seen waiting for the elusive buses at Bagwari in Bhagalpur town. ?Local goon Pappu Khan, who recently joined the RJD, has forcibly taken away keys from the drivers of all long-distance buses. But when we went to the police, they refused to lodge a complaint,? said some bus conductors here. 

 Bus operators alleged that Manoj Yadav, brother of RJD legislator from Godda (in Jharkhand), Sanjay Yadav, has ?taken over? buses, which ply on the roads connecting Bhagalpur with Jharkhand and West Bengal. ?We dread to proceed beyond Hansdehia as Manoj and his associates forcibly take control of buses at Dhakamore in Banka,? said the conductor of a bus, which plies between Durgapur in West Bengal and Bhagalpur. 

 ?How can Laloo Prasad call his rally Kisan Mazdoor Maha Raila when his party works against the interests of the poor?? asked a resident of Bhagalpur. 

 However, RJD legislator from Kotoriya in Banka, Ramdev Yadav, said there was nothing to complain about. ?Lalooji fights for the poor. So, the people should not be hostile to him,? he added. 

 The rally has also taken its toll on the residents of Santhal Pargana, who have to depend on buses from Bhagalpur in the absence of a railway network.

 On national highway 31, groups of RJD workers could be seen forcibly stopping buses and collecting ?donations? from the drivers. As a result, traffic comes to a halt and chaos prevails.

 ?Local hooligans who have joined the party seem desperate to impress Laloo Prasad Yadav. Each one of them wants to seize the maximum number of vehicles possible for the rally,? said a senior police official on condition of anonymity. But Bhagalpur superintendent of police Ravindran Shankeran seemed to be unaware of the developments. 

 BJP legislator from Bhagalpur Ashwini Chaubey alleged that the RJD has openly used the state machinery to seize vehicles for the rally.

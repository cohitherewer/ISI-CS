 MPs cannot digest dinner with spouses

 K. SUBRAHMANYA

 Sonia: Disappointed

 New Delhi, Dec. 19: Sonia Gandhi?s dinner invite last week to party MPs and their spouses was such a surprise that most of them turned up unaccompanied.

 The Congress chief had invited over 200 Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha members along with their spouses to an informal get-together of the ?extended? Congress family at her 10 Janpath home.

 The MPs were there in almost full strength as the dinner came in the middle of the winter session of Parliament. But only about 10 per cent brought their spouses along, according to a liberal estimate.

 ?We are not used to this kind of informal get-togethers,? said a Rajya Sabha member of the party who was unaccompanied at the dinner.

 Most MPs, he added, do not even bring their spouses to the capital when Parliament is in session as ?almost every weekend of a session, we visit our constituencies?.

 This is despite the government making liberal provisions for accommodation and travel of MPs and their spouses by providing official residence in Delhi and issuing enough air tickets.

 ?It would have been a great opportunity to introduce my wife to the Congress president,? said a more forthcoming B.K. Hariprasad of the Rajya Sabha, who rued the short notice.

 ?There was hardly any time for her to reach here from Bangalore as the invitation reached just three days before the dinner,? added Hariprasad, also AICC secretary.

 A couple of other MPs, too, said they would have brought their spouses along but the invitation was ?unexpected and came out of the blue?.

 They said this was the first time Sonia had asked spouses to join party MPs at a dinner. That she wanted the occasion to be non-political and informal became clear to the parliamentarians because she barely discussed politics through the two-hour dinner meet.

 Old-timers recalled that Rajiv Gandhi had ?pulled up? party MPs for not honouring his invitation to bring their spouses along to one of his informal dinner meetings.

 Some Congress MPs said that the older among them were perhaps too conservative to bring their ?low profile? spouses to high-profile get-togethers. Senior ministers came unaccompanied to Wednesday?s dinner.

 The exception were the dozen-odd young MPs like Jyotiraditya Scindia, Sachin Pilot and Naveen Jindal. ?I arranged for my husband?s arrival here in time for the dinner,? a first-time woman Lok Sabha member said.

 Then there were others like Rahul Gandhi, Milind Deora and Jatin Prasad who came alone for a valid reason ? they are among the few most eligible bachelors of Parliament.

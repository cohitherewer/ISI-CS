 Cleric in remand

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Ahmedabad, Nov. 2: Maulana Naseeruddin, the Hyderabad-based cleric arrested by Gujarat police allegedly in connection with the murder of former home minister Haren Pandya, was produced in the special anti-terror law court which had issued the warrant. 

 Naseeruddin, in his sixties, has been remanded in police custody for seven days. 

 Additional police commissioner (crime) D.G. Vanzara, who had claimed yesterday that Naseeruddin was the main ?conspirator?, today said the cleric was involved in an ISI conspiracy case as main ?motivator?.

 ?The Pandya case is being investigated by the CBI, we do not know much about it. But we do know that the assassination case was an ISI conspiracy,? Vanzara said. 

 The murder, several tiffin box blasts and attacks on VHP functionaries were executed by youth trained in terrorist camps in Pakistan, and Naseeruddin had motivated six of them to go from Hyderabad, accused the police officer. 

 The cleric, he claimed, has a ?criminal history?. He was arrested for fomenting trouble after the demolition of the Babri Masjid in 1992. 

 In 1998, his name came up after Hyderabad police busted a Laskar-e-Toiba module and arrested five Pakistanis, who had entered India through Kutch and settled in Hyderabad. The maulana apparently played the role of a facilitator and provided logistic support.

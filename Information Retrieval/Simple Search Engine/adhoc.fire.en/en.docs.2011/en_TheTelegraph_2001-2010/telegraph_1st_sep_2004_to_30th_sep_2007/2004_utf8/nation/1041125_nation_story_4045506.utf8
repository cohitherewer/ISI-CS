 Train to Myanmar gets nod

 KHELEN THOKCHOM

 Imphal, Nov. 24: Delhi has given its nod to a project to connect Manipur with Mandalay, in neighbouring Myanmar, by rail.

 The project will be undertaken after the extension of the track from Jiribam, which is at present Manipur?s lone railhead, to Imphal via Tupul in Tamenglong district.

 Manipur chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh made the announcement at a reception for participants in the Indo-Asean car rally at the main stadium of Imphal?s Khuman Lampak Sports Complex. He described the proposal as a natural progression of Delhi?s ?look east? policy.

 Ibobi Singh said a feasibility survey for the proposed Imphal-Moreh rail link would get under way next month.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh laid the foundation of the Rs 727-crore Imphal-Tupul rail project during his visit to the state last weekend. 

 Praising the Prime Minister?s initiatives, Ibobi Singh said the proposed New Imphal-Mandalay project would be a part of the trans-Asean railway line. ?In pursuance of its ?look east? policy, the Centre has already decided to focus on improving infrastructure in the region, and a trans-Asean highway will pave the way for much stronger economic and social interaction with our neighbouring countries.? 

 A large crowd turned up at the Khuman Lampak Sports Complex for the reception accorded to those participating in the Indo-Asean rally, which was flagged off by the Prime Minister in Guwahati on Monday. But the vehicles rolled out of the city only yesterday.

 The rallyists, representing nine countries, were treated to a colourful cultural programme and local cuisine. Those who expected Manipur to be grim after reading media reports about the continuing agitation against the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act were pleasantly surprised to see the festive atmosphere.

 ?This is my first visit to India and felt secure the moment I saw the large number of people who had come out to receive us. All of us had a great time. Thank you,? said the youngest participant, 19-year-old Chansala from Cambodia.

 The cavalcade was escorted from Mao to Imphal, and then to Moreh, by a team of securitymen led by Dhanakumar Singh, commandant of the 3rd Indian Reserve Battalion.

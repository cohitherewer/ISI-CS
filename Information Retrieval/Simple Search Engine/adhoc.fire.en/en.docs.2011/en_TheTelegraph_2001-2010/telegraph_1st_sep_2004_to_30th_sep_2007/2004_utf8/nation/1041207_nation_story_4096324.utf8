 New Delhi, Dec. 6: Naga leaders Isak Chisi Swu and Thuingaleng Muivah spent the first day of their trip to New Delhi meeting ?home authorities?, an euphemism for senior NSCN (I-M) functionaries based in Nagaland.

 The duo, who arrived in the capital to a rousing reception from Naga students and members of various organisations, will meet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Union home minister Shivraj Patil tomorrow in a bid to ?narrow down? differences in their perception of various issues.

 V.S. Atem, who is the special emissary of NSCN (I-M)?s top leadership, said no meeting with the political leadership was arranged today because Swu and Muivah arrived only last night.

 The Naga leaders made their second visit to India in as many years on the invitation of the Prime Minister. They are scheduled to meet Singh at 11 am. The meeting with Patil is slated for 12.30 pm. 

 Atem said an appointment with Congress president Sonia Gandhi was eagerly awaited. ?We are ready to meet her anytime,? he said.

 Sources said there was a possibility of Swu and Muivah meeting Sonia at 6 pm tomorrow.

 The NSCN (I-M) leaders are also expected to meet defence minister Pranab Mukherjee and Left leaders A.B. Bardhan and Sitaram Yechury before they leave for Dimapur, Nagaland?s commercial hub.

 The two Naga leaders, who will be in New Delhi for a week, are staying in a house protected by central paramilitary personnel.

 The NSCN (I-M) leadership?s meetings with senior members of the government over the next few days are seen as opportunities to weigh each another. 

 Discussions on what the outfit refers to as ?substantive issues? will be taken up only after Swu and Muivah return to Delhi in the second week of January.

 after gauging the mood of the Naga people.

 The militant leaders have been harping on the need to consult all Nagas, ?irrespective of their past?, before going ahead with intensive negotiations with the government. 

 They seem to be willing to listen to not only the NSCN (I-M) cadre, but also various NGOs, political parties and tribal organisations like the Naga Hoho.

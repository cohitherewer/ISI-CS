 Sonia seat killer in net

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Nov. 21: A 52-year-old farmer has been arrested in Rae Bareli on suspicion of being a serial killer committing murders for the last five years.

 Sadasiv Sahu is a resident of Semsi village in the Fusratganj Assembly area of Rae Bareli, which is Congress president Sonia Gandhi?s parliamentary constituency.

 Police said Sadasiv ? tall and lanky, his eyes sunk in his dark face ? confessed to killing 22 of the 30 elderly men who were murdered in Fusratganj between 1999 and 2004.

 Sadasiv was about to go to sleep last night when a police squad raided his house. He tried to resist by opening fire but was persuaded by family members to give up, Rae Bareli superintendent of police Sanjay Srivastav said.

 Sadasiv will be sent to court tomorrow.

 ?He looks like any of the simple, hardworking farmers; unassuming and soft-spoken?, the officer said. ?But he confessed that at night, he used to have occasional seizures of violent impulse and when that happened, he would leave home to look for prey.?

 Both Sadasiv and his son Chandramohan, suspected to be an accomplice, are being interrogated, the officer added.

 The police found a country rifle, a pair of black shoes, black gloves, black trousers, a piece of black cloth to wrap around the head, a cycle and sets of fake beard ? both in black and white ? during a search of Sadasiv?s room.

 The murders in at least 10 villages of the Fusratganj block had baffled the police and sparked tension in the area. They also drew the attention of chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav, who during a law and order review asked the district police to crack the cases.

 The police set up a probe committee, led by additional superintendent B.P. Srivastava, and intensified night vigil. They were even provided night-vision glasses but the killer remained elusive.

 Police records show the murders took place between 9 pm and 2 am. These also reveal that the killer would set on fire a small haystack or a house to divert attention of villagers before moving in for the kill.

 During summers, when villagers would sleep outdoors, the murderer would kill with one shot at close range and escape, say the police records.

 Among the victims were retired schoolteachers and aged, infirm local government servants who had no clear history of enmity with anyone.

 The first clear lead to the killings came on the night of November 8, when the murderer raided the house of Bishan Sahu, 55, and shot him in his sleep, the additional superintendent said.

 Bishan?s son Binod chased the assailant, in a black outfit and head covered with black cloth, the officer added.

 The suspected killer fell into a ditch and Binod could make out the person?s figure though he could not be overpowered. But Binod could clearly identify Chandramohan, who was on guard for his father at a distance, the officer said.

 ?We raided Sadasiv?s house and seized the mud-stained clothes and the weapon used in the killing,? B.P. Srivastava said.

 The police said that six years ago villagers had beaten Sadasiv black and blue following a dispute. This, Sadasiv is said to have claimed to police, drove him to the killings, during which he forced his son to stand guard.

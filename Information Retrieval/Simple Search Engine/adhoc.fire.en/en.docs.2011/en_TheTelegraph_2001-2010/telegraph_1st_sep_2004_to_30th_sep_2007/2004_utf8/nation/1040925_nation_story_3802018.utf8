 Jaya gift for farmers

 Chennai, Sept. 24: Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayalalithaa has brought down the interest rate on crop loans taken from primary agricultural cooperative banks from 12 per cent to 9 per cent for the 2004-2005 season, reports our special correspondent.

 The ADMK chief today said she has also ordered the ?rescheduling of all short-term crop loans? ? usually repayable in 12 to 18 months ? taken from these banks and outstanding on August 31, 2004, to medium-term loans repayable over five years with a ?moratorium? of two years.

 The slashing of the interest rate and the availability of fresh loans this year, which will help farmers facing severe drought for three years, are demands persistently raised by the Left. 

 Two weeks ago, CPI activists had courted arrest during a statewide picketing programme demanding that norms be eased by cooperative banks to enable farmers to get fresh loans. The banks had been insisting that fresh loans would be given only if the outstanding loans taken since 2000 were repaid.

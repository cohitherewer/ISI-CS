Dimapur, Oct. 2: Exactly at 9.29 am today ? 

while I was busy with my daily chores ? I heard two loud thundering sounds one 

after another within a span of a few seconds.

 Its impact was so huge that the whole Hazi Park locality was shaken. At first, I mistook it to be thunder since it was raining heavily. But soon I heard people screaming.

 I immediately ran to the market, one of the sites of the twin bomb blasts. The blast there had ignited a fire and people were running helter-skelter. Wails of injured children and women could be heard everywhere.

 As I tried to enter the market, I saw some people taking out bodies charred beyond recognition. Injured men and women were also escorted out.

 The blast took place inside the Shoppers? Stop complex, just next to the Kunga complex, in shop number 11. The impact was so devastating that more than 22 shops were completely destroyed and another 30 badly damaged. Property worth Rs 45 to 50 lakh was destroyed.

 I saw five more bodies and pieces of charred limbs, skulls and fingers being carried away to a nearby pick-up van. Policemen were clearing off the debris to search for victims? bodies.

 It was pitch dark inside the market since the power had gone off. The policemen were requesting the shopkeepers to provide a generator to continue the rescue operation.

 Next I went to the railway station, the other blast site. There were pieces of flesh and torn human limbs strewn all around. The stench of burnt human flesh was unbearable. I saw the bodies of a mother and her infant son clinging to each other. Disbelief and shock were discernible in the eyes of the mother long after her death.

 A mutilated female body was found on the track near platform number 2. The body was thrown far away by the impact of the blast.

 I saw an injured child crying at one corner of the station. 

 ?I am looking for my mother. I don?t know where she is,? he sobbed. 

 I requested a policeman to escort him to the civil hospital since all the injured were shifted there.

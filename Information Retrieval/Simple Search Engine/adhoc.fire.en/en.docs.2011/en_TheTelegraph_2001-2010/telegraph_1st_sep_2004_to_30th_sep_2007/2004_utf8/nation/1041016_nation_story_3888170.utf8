 Maulana trio faces heat over US visit

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 Lucknow, Oct. 15: A 20-day visit to the US by three maulanas of Uttar Pradesh has sparked protests from ulemas and other religious leaders of the community across the state.

 They face boycott and punitive action as members of the Babri Masjid Action Committee and the All India Muslim Personal Law Board have separately asked the ?guests of the US? for an explanation.

 Leaflets have been circulated in mosques at Azamgarh and Bahraich districts, to which the trio belongs, and slogans have appeared on walls dubbing them betrayers of the faith. ?These maulanas would be identified and boycotted by the community,? said Kalbe Jawad, the chief of Shia clerics in Uttar Pradesh who spearheaded an anti-US movement in August over the Iraq war.

 Maulana Hiatulla Kazmi, chief of madarsa Jamia Narul Ulam in Bahraich, Maulana Taheer Madni, principal of Jasme Atul Falaq and its teacher Maulana Atiq Ahmed Bastabi, both from Azamgarh, had left for the US in September and returned early this month. They were with at least 25 others from across the country.

 The three have pleaded that their visit was not in defiance of the ulemas, who supervise the work of maulanas, but to promote goodwill among communities. The US, too, has Muslims; so visiting it cannot be a sin, they said.

 The maulanas had apparently accepted the visit-offer made in late August by Robert Blake, the deputy director of the United States Information Service, Delhi. The US mission in Delhi had organised the trip as it was troubled by the growing discontent among Indian Muslims in the wake of alleged US atrocities in Iraq.

 Some Shia and Sunni clerics launched a novel protest in July, using American flags as doormats in front of all Muslim monuments in Lucknow so that US citizens would be forced to choose between stepping on their flags or skipping the visit. The same month, the US mission here warned citizens against visiting Lucknow. 

 In August, top Muslim leaders organised a rally in Delhi and decided to launch an agitation against the US. The ?junket? organisers approached the maulanas for a ?goodwill visit to the US? so that misunderstandings about the US could be dispelled.

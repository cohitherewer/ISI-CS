 Uddhav tipped to do a Sonia

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN 

 Uddhav: Unlikely inspiration

 New Delhi, Sept. 16: Uddhav 

 Thackeray may do a Sonia Gandhi and ?sacrifice? the chief 

 minister?s gaddi if the BJP-Shiv Sena combine wins 

 Maharashtra, said a highly-placed BJP source closely involved 

 in the campaign. 

 Shiv Sena patriarch Bal Thackeray has been mum on who he would like to see as the chief minister ? son Uddhav or nephew Raj, who dropped hints he would not be passed over for the post. 

 To avoid an unseemly family dispute, the BJP source said Uddhav ?Thackeray?s undeclared first choice ? was likely to say he was not interested and ask his cousin to step in. In the projected scenario, Raj would not want to be seen as a carpetbagger and would opt out. 

 Enter a dark horse. The source said it would not be Manohar Joshi, the former Lok Sabha Speaker who was the chief minister when the alliance first rose to power, or Narayan Rane, one of his successors. These are the two names the regional press has been speculating on. It could be another Sena candidate, Subhash Desai, he said.

 As the Thackeray soap foamed, BJP sources mentioned Pramod Mahajan as a ?compromise? candidate. 

 Mahajan is fighting with his back to the wall in what has been billed as a ?do-or-die? election for him. Those pitching for him said he was the most ?acceptable? face in the BJP for Thackeray and that if he was to preside over India?s commercial hub, it would do a ?world of good? to the party?s sagging image in the business fraternity. 

 Sources close to Mahajan, however, discounted the possibility, saying the Sena patriarch, a hard bargainer on seats, would refuse to give the post to a BJP nominee. Moreover, the BJP general secretary has made it clear that after the elections, he wants to return to national politics and not get bogged down regionally. 

 As Mumbai satta bazaar was abuzz on what was in store for the state after October 16, the BJP released its first list of 83 candidates for the 114 seats it will contest.

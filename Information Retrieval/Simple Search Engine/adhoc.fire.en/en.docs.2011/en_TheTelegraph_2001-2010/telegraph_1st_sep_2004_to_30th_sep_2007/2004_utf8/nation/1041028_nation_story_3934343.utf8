 Harass slur on IIM professor 

 Indore, Oct. 27 (PTI): 

 The National Commission for Women (NCW) today recorded the 

 statement of an Indian Institute of Management Indore professor 

 in a sexual harassment case filed by a woman programmer 

 of the institute.

 Commission members Ansuya Uikey and retired high court judge Justice P.D. Muley summoned Prof V.K. Gupta and recorded his statement in the presence of the complainant. ?We are deeply probing the complaint against Gupta and would submit our report to the commission soon,? Uikey said. ?In her initial complaint against Gupta, the complainant had alleged ?misbehaviour? and ?harassment at workplace?, but later, she also filed a complaint of ?sexual harassment?.?

 The programmer, in her complaint last February, had alleged she was sexually and mentally harassed by the professor for the past two years but could not reveal this out of fear.

 Uikey said an institute committee on sexual harassment, headed by former Madhya Pradesh women?s commission chairperson Savita Inamdar, was already probing the matter and the commission panel would submit its report after getting the committee?s report. 

 The panel had yesterday recorded the statement of IIM director S.P. Parashar, the chief administrative officer Subrata K. Mishra and also that of the complainant, Uikey said.

 Parashar said the institute would take further action in the matter after getting the institute committee?s report.

 The complainant said she has also furnished to the commission a document e-mailed to her by a former woman employee of the institute regarding Gupta?s alleged indecent acts.

 Shinde seat salvo at CPM

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Shinde: ?Hurt?

 New Delhi, Oct. 21: Outgoing Maharashtra chief minister Sushil Kumar Shinde has attacked the CPM for saying the Congress had not left it seats to contest.

 The Congress did not put up candidates in the three seats that the CPM won.

 The Congress wants these seats counted as part of its tally so that it and not alliance partner Nationalist Congress Party is seen as the single-largest party in the Maharashtra Assembly. The CPM?s refusal to acknowledge that the party had given up a few seats for it has queered the Congress pitch.

 ?I am hurt and angry that the CPM is now denying a pre-poll arrangement with us. Sitaram Yechury personally asked me not to put up a candidate in North Sholapur, which I was keen on contesting,? Shinde said. The outgoing chief minister eventually contested from South Sholapur.

 ?We also bore some the poll expenses of the CPM. Are we foolish that we did not to put up candidates in three seats?? Shinde said in a television interview.

 No top CPM leader was available for comment. Basudev Acharya, CPM leader in the Lok Sabha, said Shinde?s comments were unjustified since his party did not have any understanding with the Congress.

 But Shinde has only voiced what most Congress leaders are saying privately. ?The issue has to be taken up by the Congress at the highest level. I have been trying to contact Sitaram Yechury but he has not been available the last three days,? the leader said.

 Senior CPI leaders concede that the Congress and CPM must have had an unofficial understanding over the three seats. The CPI, which did not have an ?official? or ?unofficial? understanding, lost all 15 seats it contested.

 The CPM won three of the 16 seats it contested, retaining two from 1999.

 Both Left parties had tried to work out a seat-sharing arrangement with the Congress, which was willing to allot them only four seats. ?This in effect meant two seats ? one each for the CPM and the CPI ? since the CPM already had sitting MLAs in two seats,? senior CPI leader D. Raja said.

 After failing to agree on seat-sharing, the CPM and the CPI said they would fight the elections on their own. But sources feel the Congress and CPM must have had an unstated understanding over three seats the latter won.

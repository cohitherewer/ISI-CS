The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Cheers amp; tears for Naga top guns

 NISHIT DHOLABHAI AND JAHANSHER FIROZE

 Dimapur, Dec. 14: The flight from Calcutta was delayed and the crowd was restive. But when Isak Chishi Swu and Th. Muivah came out, cheers rippled across the airport. 

 As the two top guns of the NSCN (I-M) walked down the red carpet spread out to welcome them home, dozens of cameramen clicked away.

 Naga Council president Horangse Sangtam summed it up ? ?This is a historic occasion? ? just as the leaders took their seats on a podium.

 An overwhelmed and emotional Swu grabbed the microphone to talk in the Nagamese lingua franca to the 2,000-strong crowd at the airport here. ?God is seeing all the Nagas,? he announced. And tears trickled down the cheeks of many.

 Chairman Swu recalled the magnificent reception in New Delhi, and how foreigners at the airport came to know about the Nagas. ?But this one is bigger,? he said.

 The reception was organised by the Naga Council and the Naga Hoho. Several tribal hohos, including the Ao Senden, the Sumi hoho and the Lotha hoho, as well as Naga tribal organisations from Manipur also participated. 

 Swu and general secretary Muivah indicated that a solution was on the horizon but blamed the lack of unity among the Naga people as the main hurdle. In their crisp speeches, the rebel leaders said the entire Indian political leadership was ready for a solution, adding that the ball was in the court of the Nagas.

 They also made it clear that peace was inevitable if a solution is to be found. The Centre and the outfit have apparently agreed that the solution would be ?honourable and respect the historical rights of both sides? and violence was not the means to find a solution, said Muivah. ?We will not let you down under any circumstances.? 

 Informing the gathering about their meetings in Delhi, Swu said: ?They (leaders) are prepared to settle the issue. It is time for the Nagas to consolidate ourselves as one nation.?

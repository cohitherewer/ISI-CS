 New Delhi, Oct. 26: Somnath Chatterjee is taking no chances. Parliament?s winter session is more than a month away but the Speaker has already begun consultations with political parties to ensure disruption-free functioning.

 Chatterjee will discuss strategy for the session beginning on December 1 with the Congress leadership tonight. He has invited Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Congress president Sonia Gandhi and senior leaders Pranab Mukherjee and Ghulam Nabi Azad to dinner at his Akbar Road residence.

 The Speaker will tomorrow meet leaders of the BJP, which has repeatedly stalled Parliament since the new government came to power in May. ?He wants to ensure there is no repeat of the budget session which turned out to be a complete washout,? an official in his office said.

 On November 23, Chatterjee will meet leaders of all parties. ?He wants to talk to leaders of all parties about a broad consensus he hopes to work out with the Congress and the BJP,? the official added.

 Chatterjee had a hard time during the budget session when the BJP relentlessly stalled proceedings on the issue of ?tainted? ministers. The party made the resignation of ministers facing corruption cases a condition for allowing Parliament to function, a demand the government rejected outright. For the first time ever, the budget had to be passed without a discussion.

 The Opposition even put the Speaker in its line of fire, accusing him of arbitrariness and high-handedness.

 But the ruling party is not expecting the BJP to be as aggressive in the winter session, coming as it does after the defeat in the Maharashtra elections.

 Chatterjee?s office says he is keen to minimise confrontation so that business can be transacted ? bills can be passed and debates held.

 Before the budget session, too, the Speaker had met senior BJP leaders Atal Bihari Vajpayee and .K. Advani to seek their cooperation.

 Catch of 81 in crime drive

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Patna, Dec. 29: In a major breakthrough, Muzaffarpur police have busted a notorious gang and arrested 81 criminals from all over the district in the past 48 hours during an anti-crime drive. 

 ?With this, the sensational Priyanka murder case has been resolved and led to the arrest of a seven-member gang headed by a private coaching institute teacher, Shailendra Kumar,? superintendent of police Amit Lodha said. 

 The teenaged girl, Priyanka, who was on her way to a bank to deposit a huge sum in Muzaffarpur town about seven months ago, was intercepted by criminals and killed while she resisted their attempts to take away the money. This was followed by unprecedented public fury and protests in the town. 

 ?We managed to arrest the prime accused, Pappu Singh, and on his confession, several other gangsters were also caught,? the SP said. 

 Kumar is believed to be at the head of a powerful crime syndicate in the town. ?Although not apparently involved in this murder case, he used to coordinate the gang?s operations in the town,? he added. 

 Police also recovered four motorcycles, a Maruti car, two country-made pistols and as many live cartridges from the gang. 

 Lodha said the gang was unique, for ?it was led by a learned and intelligent teacher of Botany?. Kumar is understood to have admitted his involvement in several crimes over the past 10 years, including the recent dacoity at a Titan showroom. 

 The gang is also suspected to be involved in the twin murders of last Saturday. Medicine dealer Moharlal Verma and his son Atul were shot at while driving home. Police, who earlier said personal enmity was behind the killings, now believe the duo was murdered by the same gang, allegedly due to Verma?s failure to give extortion money. 

 Muzaffarpur has witnessed a series of crimes, including extortion threats and murder, in the past year. 

 All seven members of the gang are in police custody and are being interrogated. Police today claimed that the law and order situation would improve drastically in Muzaffarpur after the arrests.

 However, not everyone in the town is willing to give the police a pat on their back. ?The fact that a teacher has been conducting crimes in a very systematic way for over a decade shows that there is something amiss with the police administration,? a businessman of Muzaffarpur said over phone. 

 Lodha, who took over as the new SP only 10 days ago, is known for his no-nonsence attitude and successful operations in Nalanda district, where he was posted earlier.

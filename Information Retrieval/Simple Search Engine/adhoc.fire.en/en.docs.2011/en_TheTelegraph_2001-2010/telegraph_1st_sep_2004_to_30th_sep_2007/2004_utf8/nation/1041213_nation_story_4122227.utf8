 Reformer faces worse than ?men of straw?

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, Dec. 12: Winston Churchill?s scathing comment on future Indian leaders has been described as an ?understatement? in a former bureaucrat?s critical theme paper on administrative reforms.

 The paper on Improving Delivery of Programmes through Administrative Reforms has been prepared by Naresh C. Saxena, a member of the National Advisory Council (NAC) led by Sonia Gandhi. The council was set up by the ruling United Progressive Alliance to oversee the implementation of the common minimum programme.

 The paper is equally harsh on the political class and the civil servant and recalls Winston Churchill?s statement on the eve of India?s Independence: ?Power will go to the hands of rascals, rogues and freebooters. All Indian leaders will be of low calibre and men of straw.

 ?They will have sweet tongues and silly hearts. They will fight among themselves for power and India will be lost in political squabbles.?

 Saxena says the delivery mechanism went bust because politicians were accountable only to themselves or their clients like contractors and mafia.

 As for civil servants, now as in the past, they had ?little to commend for themselves?. But things have deteriorated, according to Saxena, who was secretary, Planning Commission and rural development.

 The NAC is expected to focus on improving the delivery mechanism by effecting administrative reforms, an area close to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh?s heart. The government is likely to set up an Administrative Reforms Commission shortly.

 ?In the present-day administrative climate, there is no incentive for a young civil servant to acquire knowledge or improve skills. There is thus an exponential growth in both his ignorance and arrogance,? Saxena?s paper says.

 ?It is said that in the house of an IAS officer, one would find only three books ? the railway timetable because he is always on the move, a film magazine because that is the only book he reads, and of course the civil list that describes how many in the system are above him,? he adds.

 Saxena goes on to say that whatever little integrity, political neutrality, courage and high morale that civil servants possessed were showing signs of ?decay? because many were ?individually or collectively? involved in partisan politics.

 The culture of ?lick up and kick below? and ?rules are for fools? delinked authority from accountability, the paper says.

 Saxena has made proposals for increasing internal and external accountability.

 By allowing people-oriented 

 departments like police and revenue to be assessed once 

 in three years by an independent commission of professionals 

 and retired government servants.

 ?The system,? he says, ?should be made more open so that the civil service can gain from the expertise of outsiders in the mode of donor-agency evaluations of projects.?

 By shifting from input 

 controls to monitoring of outcomes.

 According to Saxena, most secretaries at the central and state levels are not prepared to acknowledge poor service-delivery in their files, lest they and their ministers are taken to task. ?Thus vested interest develops from top to bottom in hiding the reality and resorting to bogus reporting.?

 Saxena suggests that the Comptroller and Auditor-General, whose audit focuses on financial irregularities, should involve social scientists and professional experts in auditing. All departments and ministries, he adds, should publish in their annual reports the action taken on the CAG?s findings over a span of, say, two years.

 By ensuring transparency.

 ?As an experiment, all muster rolls in employment schemes should be put on the Internet in at least one block of a district where Net facilities exist,? Saxena advises.

 His other ideas in this regard include the repeal of the Official Secrets Act and its replacement with a less restrictive law, and allowing people to scrutinise the property and tax returns of senior officers and politicians.

 Saxena?s other proposals are to curb the transfer ?industry?, respect civil society?s autonomy and ensure accountability through panchayats.

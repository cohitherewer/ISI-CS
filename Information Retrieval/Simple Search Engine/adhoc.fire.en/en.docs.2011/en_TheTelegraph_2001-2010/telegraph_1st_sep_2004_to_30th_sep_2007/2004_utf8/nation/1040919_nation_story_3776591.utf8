 IIMA sets up short Cairo date from next year

 BASANT RAWAT

 Bakul Dholakia

 Ahmedabad, Sept. 18: Imagine taking management lessons in the shadow of the pyramids, Sphinx watching over and the endlessly blue Nile meandering not too far away.

 For top and middle-level managers in Egyptian capital Cairo, that day won?t be too long dawning. The Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, is going to the land of the pharoahs to hold executive development programmes for them.

 An ?operating arrangement? has already been worked out with the Egyptian government, director Bakul Dholakia said, which is likely to be formalised by month-end. The idea is to go overseas ?to test its brand name in the international market?.

 This is not to suggest that the institute is planning to set up a business school in Cairo, Dholakia said. As of now, it only planned to conduct short-term programmes, as it has been doing in Colombo and Nairobi since 1998 and for which Dubai, Singapore and Mauritius have of late lined up.

 ?It?s a huge market we would like to explore,? the director said.

 The Cairo programmes ?only two so far ? have been fixed for next year and will tentatively be of three-four weeks duration. About eight to 10 faculty members will have to travel there to conduct the programmes, but none will be asked to stay for more than a week.

 In July 2003, the Egyptian government had invited Dholakia to Cairo for talks, but the director was not able to go. This June, dean Indira Parekh met Egyptian Prime Minister Hosni Mubarak, after which a high-level delegation landed in Ahmedabad for talks.

 Although the Egypt encounter is been seen as a ?very positive development? for the B-school?s image, Dholakia is a little apprehensive that there could be a resource crunch.

 ?Unless we expand in terms of faculty size, to sustain these activities would pose problems,? he said. Dholakia is already on a ?recruitment drive?.

 At present, there are 75 full-time faculty members in the institute, 10 per cent of who would be retiring in the next two years. Dholakia said he planned to take faculty strength up to 110 so that there would be no problem handling overseas training programmes.

 Apart from this, the institute intended helping set up management schools, including designing their curriculum and selecting faculty, if any organisation approached it with such a request. ?This is a usual practice to help create more institutes,? Dholakia said.

 The Ahmedabad institute itself was set up in 1962 with help from Harvard, and 20 years later it helped set up India?s first Institute of Forest Management in Madhya Pradesh.

 Every year, the B-school conducts 45 development programmes on its campus and 30 sponsored ones exclusively for company executives. It trains nearly 2,000 executives through short-duration programmes, of which 10 per cent are foreigners.

 ?If we go overseas to offer training, the number of participants would be much larger,? Dholakia said.

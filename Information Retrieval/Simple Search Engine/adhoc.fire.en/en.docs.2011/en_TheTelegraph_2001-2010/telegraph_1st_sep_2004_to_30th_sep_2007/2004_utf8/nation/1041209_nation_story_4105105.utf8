 Court acquits Modi MLA

 New Delhi, Dec. 8: Over 16 years after national badminton champion Syed Modi?s assassination, the Supreme Court today upheld an Allahabad High Court order discharging Rae Bareli MLA Akhilesh Singh in the murder. 

 A division bench of Justice K.G. Balakrishnan and Justice A.R. Lakshmanan dismissed an appeal by the CBI challenging the order of the high court discharging the accused.

 Earlier, on September 17, 1990, a trial court had discharged the badminton player?s widow Amita Modi and her present husband Sanjay Singh, the prime accused in the case. 

 The court, however, framed murder and criminal conspiracy charges against Samajwadi Party leader Akhilesh and suspected hired assassins Amar Bahadur, Bhagwati Singh, Jitendra Singh and Balai Singh. 

 Modi was shot dead on July 27, 1988, outside Lucknow?s K.D. Singh Babu stadium. The CBI cited the alleged ?illegal relationship? between Sanjay and Amita as the motive behind the murder. But the trial court had said there was no evidence to link the two to the crime.

 Akhilesh had moved the high court against the trial court order and the high court had discharged him.

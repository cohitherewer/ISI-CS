 President clears terror law repeal 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Sept. 21: President 

 A.P.J. Abdul Kalam tonight gave his assent to two ordinances 

 to repeal the Prevention of Terrorism Act and amend the 

 Unlawful Activities Prevention Act to sharpen the 1967 law?s 

 teeth to fight terror. 

 Gazette notifications bringing the ordinances into force are expected tomorrow. The cabinet had cleared the draft ordinances last week, incorporating in the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act provisions required to deal with terrorism. 

 The government, however, decided against incorporating provisions of the controversial law that made it very difficult for the accused to be released on bail, treated confessions before a police officer as evidence and allowed police to level terror charges on people carrying arms or speaking for a banned outfit. 

 Amendments to the unlawful activities act also require a designated authority to be notified by the government to pass an order to confirm or revoke forfeiture of property linked to terrorism within 60 days. But the ban on all 32 organisations currently outlawed will continue. 

 The amended unlawful activities act will restore criminal jurisprudence, whereby the onus would be shifted back on the prosecution to prove the guilt of the accused. Under the anti-terror law, the accused had to prove his innocence.

 A sunset clause has been incorporated in the Pota Repeal Ordinance that makes it mandatory for law enforcement agencies to file chargesheets in the over 200 cases pending investigation within a year from tomorrow. 

 A parallel exercise will be undertaken by review committees to put all the 300-plus cases at the investigation or trial stage under a scanner to examine if the law had been misused by the police. If misuse is established, those cases would be withdrawn from the courts, an official said.

 The cabinet decision to repeal the anti-terror law came under criticism from the BJP, which had to convene a joint session of Parliament to push through the law. But home minister Shivraj Patil had brushed aside their remarks, saying the Centre had maintained a balance between the need to enact a law to fight terror and protect innocents from harassment by making amendments to the UAPA. 

 The anti-terror act, in force for three years, was due for a parliamentary review on October 23. But it was repealed a month before to enable the UPA to keep its pre-poll promise to do so.

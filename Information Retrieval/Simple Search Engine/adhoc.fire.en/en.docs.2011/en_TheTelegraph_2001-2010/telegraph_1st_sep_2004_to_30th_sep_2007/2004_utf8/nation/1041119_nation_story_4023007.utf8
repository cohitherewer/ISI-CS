 Chennai, Nov. 18 (PTI): The Society for Electronics Transaction Security will soon come out with a new technology to prevent transmission of obscene material through cellphones and the Internet.

 The all-India organisation, which was started here three months ago, has started functioning from a rented building, Tamil Nadu information technology minister D. Jayakumar today told the Assembly during a debate on a bill to bring video pirates under the goondas act. Once the society develops the security code, such transmissions can be prevented, he said.

 The state had allotted land to the society, besides a grant of Rs 60 lakh, Jayakumar said.

 Tamil Nadu police have created a wing to control cyber crimes. For the first time in India, the minister said, a court in the state had convicted a man for harassing a woman by sending short messages through cellphones.

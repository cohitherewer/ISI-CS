The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Naxalites talk, wielding guns

 OUR BUREAU

 Hyderabad/Calcutta, Sept. 20: The People?s War Group today reiterated that the ongoing process of negotiations with the government does not indicate that the organisation is deviating from the path of armed struggle to achieve justice for the deprived sections of society.

 The assertion comes in the backdrop of a meeting of Naxalite-affected states called by Union home minister Shivraj Patil in Hyderabad tomorrow to work out the modalities of holding talks with the rebels.

 Prominent rebel leaders indicated here that there were no plans to give up arms, either during the peace process or later. ?Weapons form the basic instrument of our philosophy to liberate the poor and oppressed,? said a senior leader.

 ?We are only exploiting the platform of negotiations to expose the fallacies in the present system,? said . Narasimha Reddy alias Ganganna at a press conference in Hyderabad, the first in a city in the history of the movement where three frontline PWG leaders ? Ganganna, D. Ramesh and Bandi Prakash ? were present.

 The Naxalites got a shot in the arm with Andhra Pradesh chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy today saying that the clause in the ceasefire agreement that deals with rebels giving up arms will be discussed with the PWG leaders.

 However, the conference called by the Centre tomorrow over holding talks with the rebels drew lukewarm response.

 Only Orissa and Jharkhand will be represented by their chief ministers. Bengal will be represented by chief secretary Asok Gupta, home secretary Amit Kiran Deb and director-general of police Shyamal Dutta. Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Chhattisgarh are sending their home ministers and other officials.

 Tamil Nadu, which recently banned the PWG, has not even sent officials to the conference, which will also be attended by officials of the Intelligence Bureau, the Central Reserve Police Force, the home secretary and the director-general of forests.

 A five-star hotel has been sanitised for tomorrow?s meeting, which Patil dubbed an exercise to understand the ?security problems in such environments?. Patil will leave for Delhi tomorrow evening after visiting the campus of the anti-Naxalite force ? Greyhounds ? on the city?s outskirts.

 Bengal has made its stand clear on rebels. Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee recently said the state would agree to talks only if they laid down arms. ?We will decide on holding talks only after observing the outcome of the Andhra talks,? he had said.

 The state, officials said, is opposed to the demand that all criminal charges against the rebels be dropped, especially as many police personnel have been killed by Naxalites.

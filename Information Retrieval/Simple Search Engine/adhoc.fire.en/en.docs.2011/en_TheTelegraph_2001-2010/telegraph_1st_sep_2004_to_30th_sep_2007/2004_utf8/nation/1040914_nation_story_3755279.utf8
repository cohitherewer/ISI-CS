 Price rise heat on Congress

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 13: The BJP today seized on rising prices and the plight of the common man as it stepped up the offensive against the government and the ?hypocritical? Left in the run-up to the Maharashtra elections, just 30 days away.

 The party dubbed the ruling United Progressive Alliance?s common minimum programme a ?Congress mehngayi programme? and announced a countrywide ?andolan? (agitation) against rising prices between September 21 and 25.

 Besides inflation, the campaign would also focus on issues like ?slack? national security, ?tainted? ministers in the Union cabinet and unbridled population growth.

 Sources said the plan to focus on these issues was prompted by fears that Uma Bharti?s tiranga yatra might peter out along with the controversy over removing a plaque with Veer Savarkar?s words from the Andaman jail where the Hindu Mahasabha founder was imprisoned during the freedom movement.

 Uma, recently jailed in Congress-ruled Karnataka for a controversial flag hoisting 10 years ago that led to several deaths, set out on her 3,000-km Hubli-Jallianwala Bagh flag march on Friday to protest her arrest. The Congress has called it a ?danga yatra? aimed at spreading communal frenzy.

 The BJP chief ministers? conclave, which concluded here yesterday, had a serious discussion on inflation and issues concerning the ?common man?. The party plans to galvanise the cadre in every district in the country. All party MLAs, MPs and office-bearers will be involved in the movement. The BJP spokesman said the Congress-led alliance came to power shedding ?crocodile tears? for the common man.

 If the Congress came under attack, so did the Left, which, the BJP said, was a ?paper tiger?. It taunted the communists for their ?hypocritical? stand on the common programme and said the Left parties should reconsider their support to the UPA.

 BJP vice-president Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said as the Left parties are ?power hungry?, they are just a ?paper tiger opposition in their attitude towards the common man?s burden?.

 He said if Left leaders are insensitive to price rise, ?one has to? question the Left Front?s understanding of the common man?.

 Naqvi also took a dig at railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav. ?After being a flop entertainer, he is indulging in flop investigations. He is a joker of the Congress circus,? he said, referring to the parallel probe into the Godhra train fire the minister has ordered.

 Forensic match in Bilkis case

 New Delhi (PTI): Forensic examination 

 of bones recovered near a rivulet in the Bilkis Bano gangrape 

 and massacre case has indicated that they belonged to five 

 females and two males and their age was almost matching 

 with those missing.

 The CBI and forensic experts had recovered some bones without any skull in Panivela village in Gujarat in March 2004, where the massacre had taken place on March 3, 2002.

 The forensic examination was carried out at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences. However, a DNA test could not be done as the bones had decomposed badly.

 Highly-placed CBI sources said it had received the report from AIIMS and would submit it before the special court trying the case in Mumbai.

 Asked whether non-establishment of the DNA could deal a blow to the prosecution, the sources said the gender and age tests of the bones had matched with the seven persons who went missing. ?The agency can use this as an effective corroborative evidence,? a source said.

 The doctors carried out tests based on measurement of the bones and later compared them with photographs of the deceased, who were accompanying Bilkis while fleeing rioters on the ill-fated day.

 Bilkis was among three persons who survived. The other two were Saddam, 7, and Hussain, 5.

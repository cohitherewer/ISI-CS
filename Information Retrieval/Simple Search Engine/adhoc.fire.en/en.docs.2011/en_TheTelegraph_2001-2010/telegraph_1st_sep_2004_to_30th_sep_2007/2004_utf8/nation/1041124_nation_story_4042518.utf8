 Court shield for Teesta

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Nov. 23: Hearing a petition from activist Teesta Setalvad and her colleague Raees Khan, Bombay High Court today directed Gujarat and Maharashtra governments to give them a 72-hour notice if the states wanted to arrest her in case Zahira Sheikh, the Best Bakery prime witness who has turned hostile, filed an FIR against them.

 Zahira has said Setalvad and Khan forced her and her family to make false statements and has charged them with kidnapping and wrongful detention of her and her family.

 Since these were non-bailable offences, Setalvad and Khan had moved court, asking for anticipatory bail. But the court disposed of the petition, saying the question of bail arose if only an FIR was filed.

 The Gujarat government, the prosecution in the Best Bakery trial, filed an affidavit in the court of Justice Ajay Khanvilkar that they have not filed an FIR so far. The court had asked the state government to make its stance clear by today.

 The special court of Abhay Thipse holding the Best Bakery retrial today rejected the defence petition seeking permission to play the VCD containing a television interview of one of the main witnesses for the prosecution, Zahira?s sister-in-law, Yasmin. 

 In the interview, Yasmin reportedly said the accused were ?innocent? and she had been initially pressured to name them by Zahira and her mother for money.

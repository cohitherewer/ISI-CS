 ?Race? on for MLA ticket

 Patna, Dec. 29: All economy hotels in the city are full and their managers are happy because the situation will remain the same for many more days.

 The occasion is the arrival of hundreds of ?ticket-seekers? from different parts of Bihar for the coming Assembly election. As the day begins these MLA-hopefuls line up at the offices of the different political parties completing the ?formalities? of applying for a candidature.

 At present, the offices of Rashtriya Janata Dal, Lok Janshakti Party and the Congress are attracting the maximum rush while those of the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Janata Dal (United) are nearly deserted.

 The fact that the RJD is the ruling party with a record of controlling Bihar for one-and-a-half decades is going in its favour. The Congress? contention that it will get an ?impressive? number of seats if it aligns with the RJD or else it will go it alone or look for fresh alliances has enthused the party?s ticket-hopefuls. 

 A similar stand taken by the LJP ? besides the good spadework done by the party in the ?field? ? has drawn people to its office on the city?s outskirts.

 The stringent ?entry condition? of the RJD ? Rs 10 for a form and a fee of Rs 2,500 to Rs 5,000 for applying ? has failed to dissuade the ticket-seekers. A similar fee has been imposed by the LJP also. ?The money we collect in the process goes to the party fund and it will be immediately used for the election,? an RJD functionary said.

 A good number of women are also applying for tickets. One of them, who is hoping to get an RJD ticket, said, ?Today is my third day in Patna. I have submitted the application and hope to get a ticket in my home district of Samastipur. I believe that this time a large number of women will get tickets. After all, our chief minister is a woman herself.?

 But RJD sources said ?winnability would be the most important factor in deciding our candidates?. ?First the alliance scene has to become clear. Then we have to check the claims of the sitting MLAs and those who finished second in the last election. Only then the first-timers will be considered. But we are not stopping anyone from applying because ours is a democratic party,? they added.

 An LJP functionary said for them the recommendation of the district units would be the most important factor. ?We will also check the social background (read, caste) of the candidate concerned and cross-check it with respect to the demographic composition of the constituency,? he added. 

 A BJP leader said their process of selection was slightly different. ?We are a cadre-based organisation. Our candidates are selected on the basis of their work in the field. The recommendation of the lower party units is also very important,? he added.

 The JD (U)?s not coming clear on its position vis-?-vis the alliance, party sources said, was the main reason for the thin crowd at its office. 

 ?A lot of time is still left before we finalise the list. Our alliance position will become clear by early next month. The real rush will begin after that,? they added.

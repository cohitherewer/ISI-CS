 SA wines for India, thank rand amp; scam

 Johannesburg, Dec. 13 (Reuters): South Africa?s wine industry, rocked by an adulteration scandal and the strong rand, hopes to bounce back and win new Indian and African markets.

 The industry hit the headlines after major producer KWV sacked two employees who, it said, had put flavouring in three batches of Sauvignon Blanc wine to change the taste. Thousands of bottles had to be poured away.

 ?It is a serious offence but you have to put the whole thing into perspective,? said Su Birch, chief executive of Wines of South Africa, which represents exporters. ?The fact that we have such a rigorous testing process, that they were caught is a good thing. It may affect the company but it shouldn?t affect the industry.?

 South Africa?s wine exports ? almost all from around the Cape of Good Hope ? have soared since sanctions and international condemnation ended with apartheid in 1994, with producers switching from producing mostly cheap white wine to a mixture of red and white for export.

 Over 50 per cent of South Africa?s wine exports go to the UK. But Birch said that in the short term, the industry was targeting German and American markets, and in the longer term, Africa and India. ?In India, you have an emerging middle class that has money to spend, is very well-travelled, and where wine is seen as very aspirational,? Birch said.

 With a large Indian community already drinking wine in South Africa and better transport links than much of the rest of the world, South African producers had an advantage, she said. But high import tariffs were slowing growth, she added.

 South Africa?s black majority also represented a largely untapped market and firms were beginning to look at targeting middle-class drinkers in the rest of the continent, she said.

 ?It?s a big potential market,? said Uitkyk?s Bapenfus. ?We are all looking in that direction.?

 KWV chief executive Willem Barnard said there was considerable rivalry between winemakers in the industry and this seemed to have driven two of his employees to cheat to try and win medals and awards. Adding flavourings to what is sold as unflavoured wine is illegal in South Africa.

 ?For the two individuals, the prospect is now very bleak. They are known as people who cheat at wine-making,? he said.

 Producers say flavouring scams are almost unknown in South Africa, though they had happened overseas. The strengthening rand ? which has reached levels not seen since early 1999 ? is far more of a worry.

 ?The better the rand does, the more our sales go down,? said sales supervisor Heinrich Bapenfus at Uitkyk Wine Estate.

 Birch said some farmers were looking at cutting costs or boosting prices to offset the rand.

 Bihar MPs caught in ticket net

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Sept. 4: A number of politicians allow their aides and acolytes to use their railway passes, but two BJP MPs have been nailed in the act.

 Four small-time BJP workers were caught travelling by the Sanghamitra Express on Thursday in the names of Sushil Kumar Modi and Lalmuni Chaubey and their attendants.

 Bhagalpur MP and Laloo Prasad Yadav-baiter Modi is in China while Chaubey, who represents Buxar and is close to Atal Bihari Vajpayee, is in Russia. Neither could be reached for their comments.

 The impersonators were heading to Bangalore to attend the satyagraha against Uma Bhartis arrest.

 Railway authorities here received AC two-tier reservation requests from local BJP functionary Yugal Kishore Pandey on August 20 for booking four berths on the train for a September 2 onward journey and a return trip five days later. The bookings were confirmed but the information passed on to railway minister Laloo Prasad.

 The functionaries were allowed to board the train but were nabbed by a ticket inspector near Allahabad.

 They were asked to get off the train and fined more than Rs 14,000. Laloo Prasad is reportedly keen to report the matter to the Lok Sabha Speaker and seek action against the MPs. Railway sources said Bihar MPs often misuse passes issued to them for their exclusive use by letting others travel in their names.

 Three targets in closer ties

 PRANAY SHARMA

 New Delhi, Oct. 25: In its attempt to strengthen ties with Myanmar, India is eyeing three targets ? counter Beijing?s growing influence on Yangon, gain access to the strong economies of Southeast Asian nations and bring the Northeast under Delhi?s control.

 Indian officials claim they are not engaged in a ?zero-sum with China? in Myanmar. Instead, they argue, Delhi intends to provide Myanmar room for manoeuvre. This in effect means trying to wean it away from its current ?over dependency? on Beijing.

 However, South Block insists Myanmar?s strategic importance cannot be seen only through the China prism. A close relationship between Delhi and Yangon provides both sides the opportunity to better ties in trade, energy, security, infrastructure development and tourism.

 The Northeast insurgent groups have been taking advantage of the 1,400 km porous border to take shelter in Myanmar whenever Indian security forces turn on the heat. But for Myanmar, its borders with Thailand and China get priority, not the Northeast.

 India has launched several development projects in the past five years to draw Yangon?s attention. The Moreh-Kalemao road, the trilateral highway project from Moreh to Maesot in Thailand passing through Myawaddy in Myanmar and an optical fibre telecommunication network along the highway at a cost of $800 million are some of them.

 India is Myanmar?s fourth largest trading partner and the two-way trade has reached over $400 million. It is also the second largest export market for Myanmar after Thailand and absorbs 25 per cent of the neighbour?s total exports. The two sides aim to increase their trade volume to over $1 billion by 2006.

 India is also helping its neighbour build a $30 million crude oil refinery in Thanlyin ? it has invested $4.5 million in the project ? and is involved with South Korea?s Daewoo in exploration and production in a gas field on the western Rakhine coast.

 India sees Myanmar not only as a bridge to Southeast Asia, but also as an alternative route for transit of goods.

 However, the Chinese presence in Myanmar has been worrying India?s leadership. The countries have been close since 1988 when the junta crushed a pro-democracy uprising and barred Aung Sang from power despite her election victory two years later. 

 In the past one-and-a-half decades, Beijing?s influence has grown significantly on Myanmar?s defence, economy and politics.

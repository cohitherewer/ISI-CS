 School meal deadline

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 24: The 

 Supreme Court today ordered that midday meals for eligible 

 schoolchildren up to Class V be made mandatory latest by 

 January 2005.

 The Centre, the court directed, should provide an additional Re 1 a child to meet the cooking cost. ?It would not be open to state governments or Union territories to delay the implementation of the scheme beyond January 2005 on the grounds that necessary assistance has not been released by the central government,? it clarified.

 The order was passed on a public interest litigation filed by the People?s Union for Civil Liberties. The court directed the chief secretaries of all states and Union territories to file affidavits by December 16 detailing the steps taken to implement the scheme.

 Another affidavit, the court ordered, should be filed by January second week detailing the full implementation.

 The court made the Centre the ?monitoring authority? with ?responsibility? for overseeing the scheme?s implementation.

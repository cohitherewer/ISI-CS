 Bullock-cart band beaten back

 Patna, Dec. 8: The ploy to don the mantle of farmers and storm the Assembly premises riding bullock carts backfired today as many BJP legislators received injuries after police intervened to prevent their march.

 With this, the Assembly?s last session before next year?s election came to an abrupt end. The session, during which no meaningful business was conducted, was also marked by the absence of a debate over the issues raised by the Opposition. 

 About a dozen bullock carts had been readied for the protest and BJP members started their journey around 10 am. Legislature party leader Ashwini Chaubey had even dressed like a farmer. 

 The MLAs were first prevented from taking a route which crossed Raj Bhavan. The procession moved on an alternative route but the police asked the BJP members to stop a few hundred metres before the Assembly. ?I told the duty magistrate that we were MLAs who were on our way to the House. But before he could act, Rapid Action Force personnel started beating the legislators,? Chaubey said.

 Abandoning the bullock carts, the MLAs decided to march on foot but all but one gate had been closed by then. At one of these gates, the BJP leaders again entered into an argument with the policemen on duty. 

 ?Lathis were again rained on us and some of the members, including myself, received a second round of injuries,? the Bhagalpur legislator alleged.

 The MLAs finally managed to enter the House through the only gate that was open. As they were marching towards the House, the members were stopped for the third time. Chaubey alleged that the police lathicharged them even on the campus of the legislature.

 ?This is unheard of in a parliamentary democracy. The Speaker is the sole custodian of all activities, which take place on the Assembly campus. Though the police cannot touch the members on the Assembly premises, we were beaten up,? Chaubey said.

 Proceedings of the first half having already been adjourned, the BJP members tried to raise the matter after the House reconvened at 2 pm. The Speaker sought an answer from the government, which said the police were forced to act as ?outsiders? had also entered the campus.

 Not satisfied with the reply, angry BJP leaders started a ?satyagraha? inside the House. Chaubey later said the Speaker should have intervened in a more effective manner and accepted their demand for the immediately suspension of the ?guilty? police and administrative officials.

 The BJP legislators claimed that no ?outsider? had entered the Assembly campus and said the government?s contention was false. It was chaos once again in the House and Speaker Sadanand Singh was forced to adjourn the proceedings sine die.

 In protest, the BJP members said they would not accept the Speaker?s ?parting gift? and nor would they attend the party organised on the occasion. They also decided to boycott the photo-session but the confusion was such that some of them got themselves photographed in the group.

 The procession, BJP leaders said, was taken out to raise ?farmers? issues?. ?Sugarcane farmers have not been paid their dues. An acute scarcity of fertilisers has gripped the state. Despite Bihar being declared scarcity-hit, little relief has been provided to the farmers. These are pressing issues and when we try to raise them, we get a beating,? Chaubey said.

 Rights group rap on Bengal

 New Delhi: The Bengal government has come under the scanner of the Asian Human Rights Commission, which has in the last two months expressed anguish over several alleged incidents of rights violation in the state.

 On Friday, the executive director of the Hong Kong-based organisation, Basil Fernando, warned the state government of ?international condemnation? if it did not act on the plight of 7,000 evicted persons.

 Fernando, in a letter to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, described the living conditions of the thousands evicted from Bellilious Park in Howrah on February 2003 as ?appalling?. The authorities ransacked and destroyed the houses of those evicted ? Dalits, street and sewer cleaners. They were also denied a court hearing before the eviction, he alleged.

 The Bellilious Park case needs to be canvassed throughout India and globally as an example of the failure of the law to act with any semblance of fairness towards the dispossessed, said the rights group.

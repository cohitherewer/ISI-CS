 BJP divided on seer drive 

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN 

 New Delhi, Nov. 21: The BJP is evenly split on whether it should intensify protests against the Kanchi seer?s arrest or call it a day after tomorrow when his remand in police custody is expected to end. 

 A section, including some general secretaries, feels the issue is not ?captivating? popular imagination or evoking emotions like the Ayodhya dispute had. So having registered its quota of protest, the BJP should allow the agitation to peter out and shift focus to ?people-oriented? issues like price rise and farmers? problems. 

 They also believe it is important to conserve the cadre?s energy for a big rally the BJP has planned against inflation outside Parliament on December 1 when the winter session begins. 

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh?s statement in Imphal that the acharya will be ?treated well and extended all courtesies due to his religious status and also his age and position in society? countered the BJP?s allegation that the Centre was in cahoots with the Tamil Nadu government on the arrest. The party had earlier hoped to corner the government in Parliament if it had not spelt out its stand. 

 A discussion on the seer versus economics issue is expected in the three-day national executive beginning in Ranchi from November 24. 

 Earlier, the BJP had mulled moving a resolution on the Kanchi episode. The party had a rethink for two reasons: the RSS-VHP could use it as a handle to demand more such Hindutva-centric resolutions in future and two, if incriminating evidence was presented against the seer, the BJP could cut a sorry figure by spelling out its position in black and white. 

 Those in favour of a prolonged agitation argued that the controversy had the potential of building up slowly and acquiring the proportions of an Ayodhya-like ?movement?. ?After all, the heavens did not fall when the BJP first passed a resolution (in the Palampur executive in 1989) committing itself to the construction of a Ram temple. A momentum was gradually built up,? said a source. 

 Murli Manohar Joshi, who led the relay fast today at Patel Chowk, said: ?We are protesting on the question of the treatment given to him. I was also arrested (after the Babri Masjid demolition in 1992) under the same charge of 120(B) but I was housed in a proper guesthouse. When Sheikh Abdullah was arrested for treason, he was also kept in a big bungalow along with his family. The seer is not guilty of treason. So is everyone equal before law? No.? 

 So far the BJP has refrained from communalising the matter, but privately many are wondering whether the government would have dared arrest the Shahi Imam (of Delhi?s Jama Masjid) on the eve of Id and risked communal violence. The seer was arrested on the eve of Diwali. 

 The pro-agitation section lastly raised the point that the BJP is out of depth when it takes up ?dal-roti? issues; it is in its element when religion is at the core. The acharya?s arrest is a ?godsend? to regroup its support base, a source said.

 Chandrika rival drops by

 New Delhi, Oct. 10: Less than three weeks before Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga is scheduled to pay a state visit, her political rival Ranil Wickremesinghe, the leader of the Opposition in the island nation, has arrived in Delhi for consultations with the Indian leadership. 

 Former Prime Minister Wickremesinghe, leader of the United National Party (UNP), will meet several Indian leaders during his four-day stay. He is scheduled to visit Chennai before returning to Colombo on October 13. 

 Foreign minister K. Natwar Singh is hosting a lunch for him tomorrow. Wickremesinghe is also likely to meet President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, Prime Minister Manomohan Singh and other senior officials in South Block. He may also hold a meeting with Congress president Sonia Gandhi, who is also the head of the ruling alliance. 

 Neither Wickremesinghe nor Kumaratunga has come to Delhi since the April elections in Sri Lanka brought the latter?s Freedom Alliance to power. Kumaratunga?s state visit, slated for early next month, and Wickremesinghe?s current trip clearly shows the importance both leaders attach to India. 

 Though Wickremesinghe?s visit has not been publicised by the foreign ministry, South Block officials said it clearly shows that India has managed to establish a ?bipartisan? relationship in Sri Lanka. 

 ?We have made it clear in the recent past that we are interested in dealing with Sri Lanka as a country and not individuals,? a foreign ministry official explained. 

 Wickremesinghe and the Indian leaders are expected to spend a lot of time on the Lankan peace process. The negotiations between Colombo and the Tamil Tigers have been stalled for some months and fresh dates for the talks have not been agreed upon yet. 

 The former Prime Minister will give the Indian leaders his side of the story and brief them on how he sees the talks, once negotiations restart, progressing.

 Presidential elections in Sri Lanka are due at the end of next year and Wickremesinghe will use the time to rebuild his party and alliance. On this trip, he seems to be making sure his relations with Delhi remain strong and India should not start judging him and his party by the setback they suffered in the last elections.

 Salary row ends in suicide

 Dubai, Dec. 12 (PTI): A 25-year-old Indian worker allegedly committed suicide after his company refused to pay him money to get medical treatment.

 Arumugam Venkatesan from Tamil Nadu hanged himself from a ceiling fan in his room on Thursday, police said.

 He had been in the United Arab Emirates for nearly a year, the Gulf News today quoted police officials as saying.

 Venkatesan did not have money to see a doctor and asked the foreman for a salary advance, which he was refused. ?Instead, the foreman shouted at him,? one of his co-workers said.

 ?Venkatesan committed suicide around 2 pm, when no one else was in his room. We came back around 4.30 pm and found him hanging. He was in debt and had borrowed more than Rs 90,000 to pay an agency to come here to work,? a co-worker said.

 Yesterday, 350 of the company?s workers staged a protest over unpaid wages and refused to work. They said they had come to the UAE about three years ago and had not been paid in the last five months, the report said.

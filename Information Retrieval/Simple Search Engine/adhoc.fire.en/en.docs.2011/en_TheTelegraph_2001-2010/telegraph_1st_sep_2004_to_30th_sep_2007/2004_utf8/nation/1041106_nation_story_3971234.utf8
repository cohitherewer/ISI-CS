 Kalam?s water woes

 AYSWARIA VENUGOPAL

 New Delhi, Nov. 5: Sending rockets into space may be easier for A.P.J. Abdul Kalam than getting the defunct water meters changed at Rashtrapati Bhavan.

 The President is on a long list of Delhi Jal Board consumers who are receiving inflated bills because the provisional bills are higher than the actuals would have been. 

 The press secretary to the President, S.M. Khan, said Rashtrapati Bhavan has been in touch with the New Delhi Municipal Corporation since June over the faulty meters. The President?s office had, through a letter to the NDMC on June 30, requested that the defunct water meters be replaced and billing be done on actual readings.

 ?We had sent a detailed letter to the NDMC on June 30, 2004, informing them that none of the water meters were working and they should be changed. After that, we have sent them reminders ? one on July 30 and the latest on September 2,? said Khan.

 The Telegraph had earlier reported that Rashtrapati Bhavan?s water meters were defunct and the provisional consumption of water according to the NDMC came to about 2,000 kiloliters per month.

 The provisional consumption in the 300-acre President?s Estate, which surrounds Rashtrapati Bhavan and includes the residences of the President?s security personnel and others working within its premises and the beautiful Mughal Gardens, comes to a whopping 29,630 kiloliters per month.

 Draft for India Sharing

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 15: The Manmohan Singh cabinet today moved forward on an agenda that seeks to replace India Shining with India Sharing, clearing drafts of bills to ensure gender parity in Hindu succession rights, provide jobs in rural areas and make access to information a right.

 The bill to amend the Hindu Succession Act of 1956, which will be brought in Parliament during the ongoing session, promises to give daughters the same rights as sons to ancestral property.

 Based on the recommendations of the Law Commission, the amendment aims to remove the inequalities in the distribution of property in a joint family. The law in its current form does not accord full property rights to daughters. In many Hindu families, especially in some parts of northern India, women are not allowed to inherit property.

 But southern states have amended the law to give equal rights to daughters, while in places like Bengal, they are usually given an equal share if the father dies without a will.

 ?The central act is being amended to remove the blatant discrimination,? information and broadcasting minister S. Jaipal Reddy said after the cabinet meeting.

 The cabinet also approved bills to implement two important commitments made in the common minimum programme (CMP) ? one to guarantee rural employment and the other to provide right to information. Both will be introduced in the ongoing session.

 The employment bill will cover 150 districts and guarantee 100 days of employment a year to an adult member of every household volunteering for unskilled manual work.

 Government sources said that with the Left and members of the National Advisory Council (NAC) ? the body constituted by the government to oversee the CMP?s implementation ? having reservations about the bill in its present form, it will be sent to a standing committee of Parliament after it is tabled. 

 Some members of the NAC were reportedly upset at what they termed as a ?dilution? of the legislation and met the council chairperson, Sonia Gandhi, yesterday to register their protest. They were advised that rather than let the bill lie in a limbo, it is better to send it to the parliamentary committee which could discuss it.

 The objections of some NAC members were that the bill did not commit itself to a specific timeframe for covering the entire country and that the proposed wage was not on a par with the statutory minimum rate paid to agricultural workers.

 The cabinet meeting, presided by the Prime Minister, decided to repeal the Freedom of Information Act of 2002 and introduce the more focused Right to Information Bill in the ongoing session of Parliament.

 Most of the 36 amendments proposed by the NAC in the draft bill were incorporated by the government. But one clause, making it incumbent on security and intelligence agencies to reveal details of human rights violations and corruption, has reportedly been dropped.

 NAC sources attributed the exclusion to the developments in Manipur and the embarrassment the government was subject to after reports of atrocities allegedly committed by the army came to light.

 The cabinet referred the Lokpal bill to a group of ministers. Singh had expressed a desire to bring the Prime Minister under the ambit of the act but his proposal, said sources, was bound to be opposed by the political establishment.

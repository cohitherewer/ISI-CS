 Mutt charge 

 OUR BUREAU AND PTI

 Nov. 29: Anuradha Ramanan, the writer who accused the Kanchi seer of trying to outrage her modesty, has alleged that those close to the Sankara Mutt had made attempts on her.

 The writer said she was invited by a woman to the mutt, saying it had plans to start a religious magazine, Amma, in 1992.

 She had visited the mutt and met Jayendra Saraswati five times then. 

 During one of the meetings, she said, the seer had threatened her life. She also accused the seer of misconduct.

 Ramanan said she had consulted a woman police officer on lodging a complaint but did not do so as she feared that the future of her daughters would be ruined.

 She said some persons had attempted to kill her by having a lorry dash against a car in which she was travelling.

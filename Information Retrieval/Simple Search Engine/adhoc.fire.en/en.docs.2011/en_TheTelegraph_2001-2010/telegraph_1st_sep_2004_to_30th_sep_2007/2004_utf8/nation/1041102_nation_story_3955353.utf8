 Party rises, cases drop off

 New Delhi, Nov. 1: Nothing like it if your party is in power. More so if you are embroiled in criminal cases.

 Take the case of Congress leader and former petroleum minister Satish Sharma. The CBI has petitioned a Delhi court to withdraw 15 cases against him related to alleged irregular allotment of petrol pumps and gas agencies.

 Earlier, the Delhi government, also headed by the Congress, recommended withdrawal of 35 cases of rioting registered against Union human resource development minister Arjun Singh and Uttaranchal chief minister .D. Tiwari when P.V. Narasimha Rao was in power.

 The home ministry has also recommended closure of an 11-year-old case against Union tourism minister Renuka Chowdhry, accused of assaulting a policeman when she was an MP of the Telugu Desam Party.

 In Sharma?s case, the CBI?s ?closure report?, which was moved before special judge Pratibha Rani, cited a September 27 letter from the Union home ministry refusing to sanction his prosecution.

 The letter said: ?The matter has been considered carefully in this ministry in all aspects in consultation with the law ministry. After considering all the factors in totality, including (the) Supreme Court?s review judgment dated 3.8.1999, it has been decided with the approval of the home minister not to grant sanction for prosecution of Satish Sharma.?

 Perusing the closure report, the special judge said: ?I cannot go through all cases at one go. I will have to look into each and every case.?

 The court asked the investigating officer to produce ?complete records? pertaining to the cases before it on December 18, the next date of hearing.

 The CBI had filed cases against Sharma, now a Rajya Sabha MP from Uttaranchal, following a complaint on January 31, 1996, by Common Cause director H.D. Shourie. Sharma was then Union minister of state for petroleum and natural gas.

 Shourie alleged in his petition that ministry officials showed favour to different allottees and abused their position as public servants.

 Based on the complaint, the CBI had on September 1997 registered 15 cases under Section 120 b (criminal conspiracy) and Section 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant) of the IPC and relevant sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act.

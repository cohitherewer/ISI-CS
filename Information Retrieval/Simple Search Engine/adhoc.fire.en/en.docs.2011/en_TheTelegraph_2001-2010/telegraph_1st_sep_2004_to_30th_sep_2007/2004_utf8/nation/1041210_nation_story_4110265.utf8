 Trai call to lift radio curbs

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 9: The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India today submitted its recommendations on licensing of community radio stations to the government and suggested that the current restriction on coverage of news and current affairs be lifted.

 But radio stations will not be allowed to give religious instruction or attempt to convert listeners to another religion.

 Information and broadcasting minister Jaipal Reddy is keen that community radio expands. He thinks it can educate the rural poor on healthcare, hygiene and agriculture and be an instrument of social change.

 The home ministry has in the past objected to news on community radio saying it could be used for anti-national activities if fundamentalists or those close to insurgents take control of the station. The paranoia of security agencies stalled news on FM radio for years.

 The National Democratic Alliance government was inclined to go along with this view. But the United Progressive Alliance could be a little less influenced by the terror doctrine of the security agencies even though the regulatory authority has said banned organisations cannot be given community radio licences.

 The regulatory body also thinks licence fee for community radio should be scrapped. Any organisation or individual following government rules should be eligible for a licence, it feels. But the radio stations should be under Indian ownership and control.

 Religious bodies engaged in socio-economic development may be given a licence if the station is to be used for that purpose. An organisation should not be disqualified if it receives public funds as long as its management is not in government hands.

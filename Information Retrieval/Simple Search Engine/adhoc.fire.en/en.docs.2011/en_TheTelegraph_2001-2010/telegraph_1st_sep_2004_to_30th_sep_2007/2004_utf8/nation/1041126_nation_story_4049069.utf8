 BJP keeps up MP show

 Bhopal, Nov. 25 (PTI): The ruling BJP continued its winning streak in Madhya Pradesh, capturing eight of the 10 mayoral posts in municipal corporations, the results of which were declared today.

 The Congress candidate for mayor was leading in Bhopal but the party is yet to register a win in the corporations, state election office sources said here. Independent candidates walked away with the mayorship in the Dewas and Katni municipal corporations.

 Counting of votes was still on for three corporations ? Bhopal, Ratlam and Singrauli.

 In the battle for presidentship of nagar panchayats ? results of 75 have been declared so far ? the BJP won in 33 places, the Congress in 29, the Bahujan Samaj Party in two, the Samajwadi Party in one and Independents in 10, commission secretary Arun Tiwari said.

 The ruling party made a steady progress by winning 22 posts of presidents in municipalities while the Congress grabbed 11 posts, he said. In the 39 others, whose results have been declared so far, three Independents, two Samajwadi Party candidates and one BSP candidate have emerged winners, he added.

 The BJP appeared to have lost ground in Indore though its mayoral candidate Uma Shashi Sharma defeated her Congress rival Shobha Ojha. Her victory margin was reduced substantially to 21,520 votes compared to the over 1.6 lakh registered by Kailash Vijayvergiya in the last elections. The BJP?s tally of corporators in Indore has declined from 47 to 39.

 In Jabalpur, chief minister Babulal Gaur thanked the people of the state for enabling the BJP to achieve success in the civic body polls.

 ?This indicates that the BJP has done yeoman?s work in the state and thus masses have repaid it by making it victorious in the recent local bodies elections,? Gaur told reporters at Dumna airfield.

 On allegations of bogus voting and several cases of violence that marred the civic polls, Gaur said the state Election Commission would probe the complaints.

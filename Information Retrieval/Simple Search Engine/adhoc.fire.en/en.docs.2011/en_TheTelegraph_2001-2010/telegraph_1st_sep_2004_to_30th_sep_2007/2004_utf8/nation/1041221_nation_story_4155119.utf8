 Pawar twist to pesticide tale

 New Delhi, Dec. 20: It is not just the case with soft drinks. Even coconut water contains pesticides, claimed agriculture, food and consumer affairs minister Sharad Pawar today.

 The minister was responding in the Lok Sabha to a suggestion from a Congress member that the government should consider promoting green coconut water, mango and grape juice as alternatives to soft drinks that were found to be containing pesticide. This would also protect farmers from a fall in the prices for their produce.

 ?It is not that simple,? Pawar said replying to the suggestion from Tejaswini Ramesh of the Congress during question hour. 

 The minister said samples of coconut water were subjected to laboratory tests and ?in some cases pesticide contents were found? in them. Chemical pesticides used in coconut farming find their way into the coconut water, he added.

 Several members, it seemed, were taken aback by Pawar?s contention, though they did not immediately have any basis to challenge its veracity. 

 Pawar was replying to a primary question from CPI member Sudhakar Reddy on the steps the government had taken to implement the draft recommendations of the Bureau of Indian Standards regarding safety norms for soft drinks.

 The group of ministers was deliberating on an integrated common law to control adulteration in food and beverages.

 The minister informed the House that the recommendations were being considered by the group headed by him. While Reddy expressed disappointment with the reply, Pawar was confronted by an array of supplementary questions from members on the issue of pesticide content in bottled soft drinks.

 Members also wanted to know about the steps taken in pursuance of a joint parliamentary committee report under his chairmanship that went into details of scientific findings that samples of some bottled soft drinks were found to be having pesticide in them.

 Ramjilal Suman of the Samajwadi Party asked whether the government was considering any step to protect consumers in view of media reports that farmers in Andhra Pradesh were using bottled soft drinks as pesticides in place of traditional pesticides. Pawar said he was not aware of that. 

 He also avoided a reply to Maneka Gandhi?s query on whether the government was implementing a recent court order that requires soft drink companies to notify on the container about the existence or otherwise of pesticides in the content.

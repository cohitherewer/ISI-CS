 SC sends water law notices 

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 20: The Supreme Court today directed the Centre and the governments of Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, Jammu Kashmir and Delhi to file all relevant documents within four weeks regarding the presidential reference on the validity of the Punjab law terminating its water agreements.

 A constitutional crisis looms on inter-state relationships on one hand and Centre-state ties on the other following Punjab?s unilateral termination of all water agreements. The other states fear they will not get their share of Yamuna water.

 The question is whether a state government can make a law affecting other states as well as the Centre and if it is constitutionally correct. The Union government through the President has made this reference to the Supreme Court.

A five-judge Constitution bench, presided by Chief 

Justice of India R.C. Lahoti and comprising Justices . Santosh Hegde, Y.K. Sabharwal, 

Ruma Pal and S.N. Variava, heard the reference briefly today and directed all 

the parties to complete their written pleadings by six weeks and posted the matter 

for hearing after that.

 The court also asked attorney-general Milon K. Banerjee to study the affidavits and documents filed by the states and, ?if required?, advise the Centre to file an affidavit giving its response.

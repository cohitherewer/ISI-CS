 Mumbai, Sept. 7: Dahi was never so dear. 

 As handi-breaking was carried out boisterously on the occasion of Janmashtami, it was clear the humble pot of curd was bubbling over with politics. The handi of dahi that is suspended at a height of several tens of feet from the ground and is broken by teams of local youth in a ritual simulating baby Krishnas makhan chori fetched unimaginable prices, thanks to the parties in poll mode. 

 Handi-breaking, a festival observed across the city, had always fetched good prize money. But this time, patrons from different parties, to capture the imagination of their vote banks in the state going to polls on October 13, offered the biggest prizes ever seen. 

 The handsomest offer was from Legislative Council member Jitendra Avhad of the Narveer Tanaji Mitra Mandal of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP). He announced Rs 11 lakh for an eight-tier pyramid handi, leaving the Shiv Sena, the party that thrives on Hindu festivals and sponsors them locally, far behind. 

 Govinda tolis groups of contestants form human pyramids to reach the suspended handi, which is broken by the final and youngest participant who climbs to the top. The pyramids go up to 10-tiers; if the pot is broken by a pyramid of fewer tiers, the prize money is reduced. Each team gets three chances. 

 Avhad has raised the prize money from Rs 1 lakh last year. The Sena came a distant second, with Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Nirupam offering Rs 5 lakh at his Andheri event. Last year, he, too, gave Rs 1 lakh. 

 NCP leader Sachin Ahir has also joined the fray. Ahir, who hired a public relations agency to promote the event, has raised the prize from Rs 55,000 last year to Rs 155,555. 

 Samajwadi Party leader Paras Porwar from Mazgaon has done the same raised his prize to Rs 1.51 lakh from Rs 50,000. 

 The leaders denied that their largesse had anything to do with the elections. Nirupam said it was a coincidence that the festival was being celebrated on the eve of the polls. Avhad added that he has been celebrating it for the past 25 years and it was no different this time. 

 But that the elections were an integral part of the celebrations was clear from the other signs. At Avhads event in Thane, there were election placards strewn all over. The contesting youths wore T-shirts that showed their allegiance to the NCP. 

 Avhad, however, said the T-shirts were five-year-old and he had nothing to do with the contestants choice of dress. He brushed aside the poll placards. 

 Nirupam blamed the date of the elections. He said it was unfair that the polls were so close to the local festivals Ganesh Chaturthi, the biggest, starts on September 18 and it was the proximity to these dates that had led to such charges. 

 The youth took full advantage of the prizes. To the accompaniment of bands and shouts of Govinda a la re, the tolis toured various contests. 

 There was a burst of woman power. There were special prizes from mahila tolis, teams of women, at some contests. A mahila toli took the prize of Rs 50,000 at a Dadar contest in the first attempt before moving to the next. 

 Shweta Thabre, a teen veteran of handi-breaking, accomplished her job with panache, though on a pyramid built on the other gender. Localities reverberated with trucks full of youth usually in yellow T-shirts and orange bandannas, more often than not embossed with party symbols on their way to pot luck.

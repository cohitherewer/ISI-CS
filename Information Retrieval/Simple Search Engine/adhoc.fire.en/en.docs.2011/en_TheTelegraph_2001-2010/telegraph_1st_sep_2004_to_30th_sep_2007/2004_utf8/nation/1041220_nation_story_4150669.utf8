 PIL penalty on lawyer

 R. VENKATARAMAN

 New Delhi, Dec. 19: The Supreme Court has punished a lawyer for filing a ?private interest litigation? in the form of a ?public? plea, upholding Bombay High Court?s imposition of Rs 25,000 as fine.

 A division bench of Justices Arijit Passayat and S.H. Kapadia, in a judgment delivered on Tuesday, said: ?We would have imposed exemplary cost, but taking note of the fact that the high court had already imposed costs of Rs 25,000, we do not propose to impose any further cost.?

 In his petition, the lawyer had accused the respondents of resorting to unauthorised constructions and the high court had found that the allegations were untrue, the bench said.

 When the fine was imposed, he filed a special leave petition in the Supreme Court.

 ?This case is a sad reflection on members of the legal profession and is almost a black spot on the noble profession,? Justice Passayat said. 

 ?The petitioner filed a petition styled as public interest litigation before the Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court, which dismissed it, holding that there was no public interest involved, and in fact, the petitioner had resorted to blackmailing the respondents and was caught red-handed accepting the blackmailing money.?

 The judges ordered that a copy of the verdict be sent to the Bar Council of India (BCI) as well as the Supreme Court Bar Association for ?necessary action?. The BCI might even cancel the lawyer?s licence to practise, but action will be taken after its executive committee meets, sources said.

 ?It is a black day for the black robe professionals,? the bench said. 

 The PIL, ?which has now come to occupy an important field in the administration of law should not be publicity interest litigation or private interest litigation or politics interest litigation or, the latest trend, paise income litigation. The high court has found that the case at hand belongs to the last category. If not properly regulated and (its) abuse averted, it becomes also a tool in unscrupulous hands to release vendetta and wreck vengeance?, the judges added.

 The courts? jurisdiction cannot be invoked to satisfy ?personal grudge and enmity?, the bench pointed out. 

 ?PIL is a weapon which has to be used with great care and circumspection?. It is to be used as an effective weapon in the armoury of law for delivering social justice to the citizens,? the judges observed.

 The bench urged judges to be cautious before taking up a PIL. ?The court has to be satisfied about the credentials of the applicant, the prima facie correctness of the nature of information given by the PIL petitioner and the information being not vague and indefinite.?

 Jawans killed in camp hit

 MUKHTAR AHMAD

 Srinagar, Dec. 3: Five paramilitary troopers were killed today in an early morning battle in Sopore township, 56 km from here, in north Kashmir?s Baramulla district.

 The army, paramilitary and police are searching in and around state police?s special operations group camp near the Town Hall building in Sopore for the militants involved in the attack.

 ?Intermittent firing exchanges are still continuing. So far five CRPF troopers have been killed. Two injured troopers are undergoing treatment in hospital,? Ranjeet Sinha, inspector-general, CRPF, said here this evening.

 He said an unspecified number of militants hurled grenades and fired heavily at the camp. ?Central Reserve Police Force guards at the camp returned the fire and a fierce gunbattle ensued in which four jawans of the CRPF were killed initially. Reinforcements from the army and the paramilitary reached the spot and surrounded the camp,? Sinha added. ?(The) body of another CRPF jawan was recovered from inside the camp this afternoon.?

 The CRPF and special operations group jointly carry out anti-militancy operations across the Valley and in Jammu. ?Army and paramilitary engaged the hiding militants in a sustained gunbattle. The firing exchanges are still continuing,? Sinha said.

 ?We have reports that maybe two fidayeens are holed up inside the camp. Firing exchanges are continuing and the area around has been sealed.?

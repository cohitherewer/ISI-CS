 School safety gathers steam

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Dec. 20: Continuing with its efforts to make school buildings secure, the Orissa government has introduced a host of safety measures, including the provision of fire extinguishers and repair of dilapidated structures.

 State school and mass education minister Nagendra Pradhan recently said in the Assembly that the directors of secondary and elementary education have been asked to direct district officers to inspect schools and submit reports on the fire safety system there. Besides, the two directors have also been requested to submit proposals for the supply of fire extinguishers to every school.

 All district magistrates, circle inspectors and district school inspectors have been instructed to take steps for the reconstruction of thatched primary and upper primary school buildings with funds from the Sarva Siksha Abhiyan and the primary education programme. 

 Similarly, reconstruction of thatched high school buildings would be taken up with money from the Local Area Development funds of MPs and MLAs, Pradhan said.

 The government has instructed chief engineers of the works and rural development departments to identify the unsafe and thatched school buildings and construct fire-proof roofs, the minister added. A secretary-level meeting also decided to take steps for the reconstruction of old buildings.

 Pradhan?s department would also set up committees at the block level. Headed by the respective block development officers, the committees would comprise local sarpanchs, gram panchayat extension officers, welfare extension officers, junior engineers and sub-inspectors of schools. Each committee would prepare a report on the unsafe school buildings and submit the same to the school and mass education department, the minister said.

 Besides, every school would have a notice put up near its entrance to inform students and staff members of the nearest source of water. Kitchens, essential for the preparation of mid-day meals, would be constructed away from the school buildings so that students were not affected in the event of a fire, Pradhan said.

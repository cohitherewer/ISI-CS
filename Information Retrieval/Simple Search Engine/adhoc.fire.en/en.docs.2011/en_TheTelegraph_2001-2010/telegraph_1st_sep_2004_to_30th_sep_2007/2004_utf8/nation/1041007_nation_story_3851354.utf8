 Yukta gets breather as landlord amp; bank spar

 Yukta Mookhey: Reprieve

 Mumbai, Oct. 6 (PTI): In a reprieve to actor Yukta Mookhey, Bombay High Court has asked the Bank of India not to evict the former Miss World from her suburban Andheri flat over a dispute the bank has with her landlord.

 The bank had granted a loan to Harmonics Fabrics Fashions Ltd, to which Yukta?s landlord Sanjivani had stood guarantor. When the company defaulted in repayment, the bank approached the debt recovery tribunal for attaching his property.

 Yukta approached the tribunal with a plea that being a tenant she could not be evicted from the flat. Following the tribunal?s refusal to consider her plea, she moved the high court. 

 The actor had informed the court in an affidavit that she had received anonymous threat calls, allegedly on behalf of the bank, asking her to vacate the flat. 

 The court yesterday asked the bank not to remove Yukta from her flat and maintain status quo till October 28 as the matter was pending before the tribunal. The court also gave Yukta the liberty of moving the tribunal again before that date. 

 Yukta had paid Rs 7.5 lakh to her landlord as security deposit for a flat in the Excellency Co-operative Housing Society in Lokhandwala, suburban Andheri, on a leave and licence basis. 

 Last year, the Bank of India informed the former beauty queen that it had initiated proceedings in the tribunal against the company and its guarantor Sanjivani to recover its loan under Section 13 (2) of the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act.

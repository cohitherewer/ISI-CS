 After ban, call for RJD rally boycott 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Dec. 19: The ?tit-for-tat? is official.

 The call to the poor of Bihar to boycott the Rashtriya Janata Dal?s December 23 rally in Patna, a quid pro quo for the government playing spoilsport to a rally organised earlier this month to hail the unification of the banned Maoist Communist Centre and the People?s War, came today.

 The government had banned the rally ? organised by the Krantikari Jan Sangharsh Ekjutta Samiti, a group sympathetic to the Naxalites? cause ? a day before it was to be held on December 5.

 Since then, Rashtriya Janata Dal president and railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav has stated on record that the Bihar government had no role in banning the rally and that it was done on the instructions of the Centre.

 But the rally organisers today refused to buy his point and held the government responsible for ?banning the rally and arresting workers, cultural activists and children? who were headed for Gandhi Maidan. They had organised the rally to celebrate the formation of the CPI (Maoist), contending that the new outfit had not been banned. 

 ?The act was a clear indicator of the dictatorial ways of RJD chief Laloo Prasad. The wish to seek the unification of people?s movements and hailing an organisation, which is not banned, was not illegal. Yet, false charges were framed against members of the organising committee. This was like stifling democracy,? committee member Triveni Singh said in a communiqu? today.

 ?In contrast, the RJD is using illegally earned money to make its December 23 rally a success. The party is also misusing state power for the same purpose. We, therefore, appeal to the people of Bihar to democratically oppose the RJD?s rally,? he added.

 If the CPI(Maoist) endorses the boycott call, it can convince a large number of people not to attend the RJD?s rally because it has historically worked among a support base similar to that of the ruling party. 

 In the past too, Naxalites have given calls to boycott elections. The December 5 rally was the first instance when a rally was to be held in support of the Naxalite groups.

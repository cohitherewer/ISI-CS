 Plane returns to save child

 New Delhi, Sept. 12 (PTI): A Bangalore-bound Indian Airlines flight returned to Delhi this morning to save two-and-a-half-month-old Mohammed Hassan having serious breathing trouble.

 On being informed about the trouble, captain M.P.S. Gill commanding the IC 803, which took off at 6.15 am, turned back and landed at Indira Gandhi International Airport at 8.06 am, sources said. 

 No passenger objected to Gill?s decision. 

 An ambulance of the Airports Authority of India took the baby to AIIMS, where he was admitted. The baby was accompanied by father Abdul Jabbar and mother Firoza. 

 A similar incident had occurred on July 29 when another Indian Airlines Delhi-Bangalore flight was diverted to Hyderabad to save an infant.

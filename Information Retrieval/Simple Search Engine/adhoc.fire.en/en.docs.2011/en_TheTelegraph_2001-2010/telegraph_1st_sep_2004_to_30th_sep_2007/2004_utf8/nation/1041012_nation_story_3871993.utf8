The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 US set for date with Left

 PRANAY SHARMA

 New Delhi, Oct. 11: US undersecretary of commerce Kenneth Juster heads to Calcutta on Wednesday and could meet Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee in what might be the first major interaction between Washington and the Left.

 US ambassador to India David Mulford was in Calcutta earlier this year, but he did not meet Left leaders, interacting instead with US officials at the consulate as part of his familiarisation programme. The ambassador has not met CPM or CPI leaders in the capital either.

 Juster flies into Calcutta from Delhi on Wednesday morning and leaves for the US on Friday morning. 

 He will visit software firms in Salt Lake, attend a lunch hosted by the Confederation of Indian Industry, meet the chairman of the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation and interact with leading businessmen and industrialists.

 ?The main thrust of his (Juster?s) visit to Calcutta would be on business-related issues,? a US embassy official said. He added that the envoy?s interaction with Bhattacharjee has not yet been finalised. But sources in Calcutta later said a meeting has been scheduled.

 Asked if he had any message for Bhattacharjee, the undersecretary said here: ?I am not carrying any message. I am looking forward to meet him to find out his views on high-technology trade with the US.?

 Both sides are trying not to overstate the proposed meeting, but by all indications it will be a significant ?first step?. US embassy officials, who are traditionally in touch with leaders of various parties, have until now overlooked the Left?s importance in the current scheme of things. 

 The communists? pronounced ?anti-American? stand might have also contributed to the mutual distance the two sides have kept.

 The political stock of the Left has shot up after the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance came to power last May. The bloc accounts for 63 MPs and its support is crucial for the government?s survival.

 Even though they have not made any statements about it, the Americans have always been uneasy about the Left presence and its importance in the ruling coalition.

 Most political observers think the Left might bury its differences on military-to-military cooperation and political ties between India and the US but a nod for closer economic and trade ties will be difficult to come by. 

 The communists have serious reservations about the UPA government?s economic liberalisation policy which they believe has been drafted under American advice.

 During his recent US visit, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh tried to assure foreign investors in the region and in the West, particularly America, that economic reforms will remain on track despite the Left?s looming presence. Finance minister P. Chidambaram also told investors in the US recently that Left parties will not create hurdles for foreign investors.

 Juster will be able to see for himself what the Left wants and understand their concerns about growing Indo-US ties when he heads to Calcutta on Wednesday.

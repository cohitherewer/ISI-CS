 Left spits out BJP price bait

 MONOBINA GUPTA

 New Delhi, Dec. 3: The CPM will bark but not bite. Party MPs will continue to rail against the United Progressive Alliance government on the increase in petroleum prices but not vote against it in the Lok Sabha.

 However, this policy might be put to test by the BJP. The main Opposition party is demanding a discussion on the rise in petroleum prices in the Lok Sabha under rule 184, which requires voting to take place. It is hoping to put the Left in a bind on an issue over which the communists do not want to be seen ? at least in public ? as backtracking.

 The Left is not playing ball. ?We will not vote against the government if a discussion under 184 takes place,? said Basudev Acharya, the CPM leader in the Lok Sabha. ?We will not create a situation where a fascist party can make a comeback to power.?

 This line is contrary to CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury?s statement on BBC over foreign direct investment. ?The CPM knows not only how to bark, but also how to bite. And when we bite, we bite really hard,? he had said in an interview when asked what his party will do if the Congress-led government does not heed its demand for not increasing FDI in telecommunication and insurance.

 The party?s central committee had subsequently pulled up Yechury for making such a hard-hitting statement. The CPM leadership said it will not destabilise the present dispensation regardless of the provocation.

 However, the petroleum price hike continues to top the CPM?s agenda of business in Parliament even on the third day of the winter session. ?We will continue to put pressure on the government till it agrees to a rollback,? said Acharya.

 Union petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar had clearly signalled during yesterday?s question hour that the government will not be able to roll back prices.

 Aiyar said the Centre has done what it can to protect consumers and put part of the onus of reducing prices on state governments. ?I regret to say the states are not cooperating,? said the minister. He said petroleum prices would come down substantially if state governments reduced sales tax.

 The petroleum minister has written to the chief ministers, but no state other than Orissa has responded.

 Acharya defended the state governments? lack of response. ?This is not a state matter. One government cannot help matters by reducing sales tax,? he said when asked why the Bengal government has not responded to Aiyar?s suggestion. Petrol prices are much higher in Bengal than in Delhi.

 The CPM today also put out a long list of must-dos for the Centre. It said the Centre must introduce the national employment guarantee bill in the winter session. ?The bill can be sent to the parliamentary standing committee after its introduction in this session,? said Acharya.

 Child-seller mother missing

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Sept. 13: Dheeran Devi, wife of a 35-year-old rickshaw-puller bedridden with tuberculosis, has gone missing after her family members and neighbours allegedly beat her up for selling her toddler to pay for her husband?s treatment and clear her mounting debts.

 The woman, who lived at Ambedkar Colony in Hajipur on the outskirts of the capital, had lost her two-year-old son around the time the third child, also a boy, was born two months ago. The child, neighbours said, died of starvation.

 The missing woman?s husband, Lalbabu Paswan, used to work with the local municipality but he lost his job since his employment was temporary. 

 ?I started pulling a rickshaw after that but it was extremely difficult to meet the family?s expenses. My health too was not good and doctors told me that I was suffering from TB. The income dried up and I had to borrow a lot of money,? Paswan said.

 ?Four days ago she disappeared with the child, who was just two months old. She returned two days ago but without the child. She came back with Rs 6,000 and when we prodded her, she said she had sold off the baby,? one of the neighbours said.

 The woman, however, immediately cleared the dues and also paid some money for her husband?s treatment. ?But no one liked the fact that she had sold off her own child. She was taken to task for this and since then Dheeran has been missing. We believe she will return in a few days,? another neighbour said.

 Paswan admitted that he beat up her wife since he was angry with her. The couple?s eldest child, a seven-year-old girl, stays in the shanty provided under the Indira Awaas Yojana.

 District magistrate H.R. Sriniwas said the incident was ?extremely disturbing?, especially because all TB patients have to be provided free treatment at government hospitals.

 ?The family should have been covered under the welfare schemes of the government. But the choice of beneficiaries is made at the local level. I will try to provide all the help I can to the family,? Sriniwas said.

 The living condition at Ambedkar Colony is pathetic. Residents said at least five more persons of the locality are suspected to be suffering from tuberculosis with no relief reaching them. Unconfirmed reports say at least four persons have died of starvation in the flood-hit districts of the state.

 A local doctor, Om Prakash Chaurasia, has offered to adopt Paswan?s family and provide food to its members for a year. Paswan?s neighbours, while appreciating the gesture, said the scale of the problem was much higher than just one family.

 Paswan?s family was not covered by any of the welfare schemes announced by the government for people living below poverty line.

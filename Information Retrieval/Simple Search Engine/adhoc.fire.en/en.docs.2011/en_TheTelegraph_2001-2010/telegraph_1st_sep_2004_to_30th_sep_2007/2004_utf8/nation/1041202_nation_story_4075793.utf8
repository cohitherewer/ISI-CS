 Reality check on AIDS Day

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Dec. 1: The Orissa government observed World AIDS Day today with the usual enthusiasm ? organising rallies and meetings ? but seems to have made little progress to contain the disease.

 The prevalence and spread of AIDS have assumed alarming proportions in Orissa. In the past four years, an increasing number of patients with STD (sexually-transmitted disease) patients have tested HIV positive.

 According to health department officials, there were 127 full-blown AIDS cases till March 2002. In a span of two-and-a-half years, the state recorded a significant jump in the number of AIDS cases. While 288 cases were recorded till September 2004, 125 people have died so far. 

 There are 34 centres for AIDS surveillance in 15 districts and negotiations are on with the National Aids Control Organisation to set up more units across the state.

 Of the 34 centres, 14 are AIDS surveillance centres and 20 voluntary confidential testing and counselling units. 

 A recent survey conducted by the health department showed that the AIDS prevalence rate stood at 2.5 per cent. 

 While the disease has been able to spread in most parts of the state, its prevalence is most alarming in Ganjamdistrict. 

 The prevalence rate there is 6.8 per cent among the high-risk groups. Ganjam accounts for 45 per cent of the total number of AIDS cases in Orissa.

 The recent instances of social boycott of the families of AIDS victims prompted the Naveen Patnaik government to conduct a survey. The study revealed that improper sexual practice, mostly for lack of awareness, was primarily responsible for the spread of the disease.

 The high-risk groups comprised migrant labourers, truckers and commercial sex workers. 

 Though the government, in association with several NGOs, carried out several awareness campaigns, the need of the hour is to ensure proper implementation of the preventive measures. Most NGOs are allegedly not pursuing the government-sponsored schemes sincerely. 

 Health minister Bijoyshree Routray said the government had received Rs 13.71 crore from the World Bank and Rs 10.9 crore from DFID under Phase II of the National Aids Control Programme. 

 The government has spent about 79 per cent of the amount so far.

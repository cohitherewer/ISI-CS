The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 All?s well parade by law board

 - Muslim body to paper 

over cracks at meet

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Dec. 24: Faced with a ?parallel? panel, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board has decided to accelerate social reform, focus on political issues and present a united face of the community at a meeting here tomorrow.

 Publicly, the Muslim law board has ignored the very existence of a ?parallel? body but privately all members are alarmed at the development. The Lucknow meet is, therefore, expected to come up with concrete measures to reinforce the impression that the law board is meant to protect the community in all spheres.

 A model nikaahnama (marriage contract), which aims to bring about gender equality, is ready, according to informed sources. The nikaahnama has been hanging fire for four years. If it is clinched tomorrow, it will be a major victory for the pro-reforms lobby in the law board that is presently in a minority.

 On the political front, the law board is likely to sharpen claws against the Mulayam Singh Yadav-led Uttar Pradesh government over the chief minister?s failure to issue a fresh notification for opening a special court for trial of Ayodhya cases against BJP leaders L.K. Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi and others.

 The board is also upset with Mulayam Singh over his failure to push through an amendment in revenue laws granting Muslim women the right to income from agriculture.

 A law board general body meeting scheduled to be held at Kozhikode in Kerala this month was called off following dissension in its Kerala unit. 

 A state minister who was supposedly playing a major role in organising the Kerala meet is facing allegations of sexual abuse. The law board chief, Maulana Rabey Nadvi, then postponed the general body meeting to avoid a controversy.

 At tomorrow?s executive meet, the focus will be on sectarian representation on the board. The ?parallel? body headed by Maulana Taqeer Raza Khan of the Bareilvi sect has claimed that the present law board is dominated by the Deobandi sect. 

 Traditionally, the Bareilvi sect ? representing ?popular Islam? ? has been at loggerheads with the Deobandis who claim to practise ?puritan Islam?.

 Law board office-bearers claim that Raza is ?politically motivated? and his charge that Bareilvis have not been adequately represented on the board lacks substance.

 The law board has also been witnessing fissures on other counts. Earlier this year, there was a note of discord with Maulana Kalbe Sadiq, its vice-president and an influential Shia leader, opposing triple talaq. Sadiq went on to favour family planning, prompting a rare repudiation from board chief Maulana Nadvi that Islam did specify a model family size.

 The executive body meeting at Nadua College is, thus, expected to be stormy. But Abdul Rahim Koereshi, a law board spokesman, said the executive?s main agenda is to decide the venue for the next general body meet.

 Back from ?dead? in Lahore

Raiganj, Sept. 8: After 

 more than seven years in Pakistan?s Lahore Central Jail, 

 Ghulam Rabbani Sarkar, whose family had almost given him 

 up for dead, returned home this Monday.

 In March this year, the 33-year-old was first allowed by the jailers to write home. It was this letter that his father took to Union water resources minister and local MP Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, who managed to persuade the Indian foreign ministry to take up the matter with its Pakistani counterpart.

 As a result of the talks, Rabbani walked across the international border at Wagah and into the arms of his elder brother Ayub Ali Rabbani, who waited on the Indian side, on August 31.

 Back at his village in North Dinajpur district, a relaxed Rabbani could not believe his luck. He recalled the summer of 1997 when he was on the streets of Delhi, selling odds and ends. ?It was in April 1997 that I met a Bangladeshi youth called Habib in Delhi,? he said.

 Habib told him about a group in Pakistan which smuggled people looking for jobs to Greece. Three months later, the duo managed to sneak into Pakistan across the Wagah border under the cover of darkness. ?A day after we entered Pakistan, both of us were arrested. We were produced before a court and sentenced to eight months in prison. It was like living in hell,? Rabbani said.

 ?We were beaten and tortured, and not allowed to write back home. When my term ended, the jail authorities formally declared that I would be released,? he said.

 The declaration was, however, only on paper, as Rabbani realised soon. According to him, the jailers never answered their queries. As eight months rolled into seven years, Rabbani was finally allowed to pen a few lines to his family.

 Rabbani added that at the time of his release, there were 84 Indians, including four women, who were still incarcerated at Lahore Central Jail. All of them, like him, had served their term.

 Rafisuddin Mohammed, Rabbani?s father, described his son?s return as a ?miracle?. ?Seven years after my younger son went missing, we got to know he was alive. We contacted the local administration and took up the matter with Priya babu. The Lord has brought him back,? a misty-eyed Rafisuddin said.

 Rafisuddin later got a letter from the external affairs ministry saying Rabbani would be released at the Wagah check post on August 31.

 On the day itself, Ayub spent an anxious two hours scanning each vehicle that stopped on either side of the frontier. ?It was just before noon that the BSF told me that my brother was waiting for me at the check post. He looked thin and pale. His eyes had lost their shine,? Ayub recalled. ?But whatever it is, he is back with us.?

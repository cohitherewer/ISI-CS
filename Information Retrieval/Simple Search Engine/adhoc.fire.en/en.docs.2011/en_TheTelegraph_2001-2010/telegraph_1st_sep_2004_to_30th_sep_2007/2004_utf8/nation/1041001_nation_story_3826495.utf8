The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 New cricket boss springs TV plan 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 30: The Board of Control for Cricket in India today made public its back-up plan for beaming the home series against Australia and South Africa and the November 13 jubilee match against Pakistan.

 Newly-appointed board president Ranbir Singh Mahendra announced at his first news conference that Ten Sports would be given the production rights while Sony would be responsible for the ?telecast, distribution and marketing?. Sony will also have to ensure that Doordarshan is provided ?live and delayed telecast? of the matches on its terrestrial network.

 But Mahendra clarified that ?the grant of the right is subject to any order passed by the Supreme Court?.

 The Prasar Bharati chief, though, was not clear about what happens next. ?I can neither get through to the Sony chief nor to anyone from BCCI, so I do not know what exactly has happened,? CEO K.S. Sarma said late in the evening.

 But he clarified that Doordarshan was keen on showing the Test matches. ?We have a model in place and we will try to make the arrangements according to it,? Sarma said.

 According to the model, Sony will pay Doordarshan a minimum guaranteed amount for beaming the matches terrestrially. 

 Sony would then sell the ad spots for its own channel and Doordarshan and split the latter?s revenues with the national broadcaster on an 80:20 basis. Though the standard amount is Rs 1 crore per ODI, the rate for Test matches would have to be worked out, Sarma added.

 A ?masterstroke from Dalmiya? is how a channel source termed the development. As far as the BCCI is concerned, the tender process remains cancelled. This was made clear by the board before Bombay High Court on September 21. 

 ?But that was only theoretically till now. As soon as the first ball is bowled on October 6 and the match is telecast, the contract will actually be null and void and process will have to start afresh,? the source added.

 Further, offering the production rights to one company and telecast to another while ensuring a feed to the national broadcaster could be cited as evidence of BCCI?s ?neutral? position and ?concern for cricket lovers?.

 Zee Telefilms and ESPN-STAR Sports responded to the day?s dramatic developments with a strict ?no comments?. The industry had not bargained for Mahendra?s announcement, right after the matter was heard in the Supreme Court

 But Zee Telefilms sources said they are confident that the court will intervene and put a stop to the proceedings. ?Anybody can say anything they like,? a Zee official said, ?but it is the Supreme Court that will actually decide.? Sources also indicated Zee would bring the matter to the court?s notice at the next hearing, asking how the BCCI could make a public announcement when the case was ?sub judice?.

 Ten Sports did not comment. But sources said Ten had been chosen as it is the only company to fulfil the eligibility criteria of the original contract by producing its own cricket content.

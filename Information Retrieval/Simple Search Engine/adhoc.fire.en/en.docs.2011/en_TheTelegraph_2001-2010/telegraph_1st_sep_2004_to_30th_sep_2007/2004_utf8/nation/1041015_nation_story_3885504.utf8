 Bollywood?s model mother no more

 Nirupa Roy

 Nirupa Roy, the icon of motherhood of Hindi cinema, died on Wednesday night in Mumbai at her residence. She was 73. She is survived by her husband and two sons.

 Roy, who typified the benign mother, acted in nearly 300 films and her on-screen sons ranged from Dev Anand (81) to Akshaye Khanna. 

 But, draped in cotton sarees and having dark circles as the sole make-up, Roy is best remembered as Amitabh Bachchan?s mother ? a soothing, nurturing, submissive, teary and often-wronged feminine presence that was the perfect foil to the angry young man. 

 But the mother would also transform herself on the right occasion ? her eyes, ordinarily dripping with affection, would flash with anger at social injustice, especially when inflicted on her children.

 In Deewar (1975), the battle between brothers ? the errant underdog, Bachchan, and the emblem of the establishment, Shashi Kapoor ? is fought over mother Nirupa Roy. The climactic encounter between the brothers has Kapoor proclaiming in a famous rejoinder: ?Mere paas maa hai.? 

 Roy, in role after role, convinced her audience that she was the perfect actor to live up to that immense responsibility implied in the statement: an amalgam of spiritual values against a crass materialistic world, a figure of sacrifice against a world of violence and greed.

 She looked out for her sons as the blind mother in Amar Akbar Anthony. She suffered for being the wife of a man framed in a false case ? roles she essayed in several other films. Roy acted in so many films that she would often find it hard to remember her roles. But it was Deewar that brought her the final recognition.

 Since then, she appeared as Bachchan?s mother in several films, including Muqaddar ka Sikandar, Suhaag, Ganga Jamuna Saraswati and Mard.

 In one of her last films, Lal Badsha (1999), she played Bachchan?s foster-mother.

 Her career began in 1946, with V.M. Vyas? Gujarati film Ranakdevi. In her previous films, when she was yet to evolve into a matron, her characters were touched with the divine. She played a goddess in many films ? she was Sita, Parvati and Lakshmi ? and was called Parvati by many of her colleagues. In Satyavan Savitri, she famously played Savitri.

 Roy played Dev Anand?s mother in Munimji (1955). Anand was about a decade older, but that did not stop her from becoming the perfect Indian mother.

 She died of a cardiac arrest at her residence on Napean Sea Road. Her body was cremated on Thursday afternoon. 

 None of the famous heroes to whom she played mother for years, was in attendance.

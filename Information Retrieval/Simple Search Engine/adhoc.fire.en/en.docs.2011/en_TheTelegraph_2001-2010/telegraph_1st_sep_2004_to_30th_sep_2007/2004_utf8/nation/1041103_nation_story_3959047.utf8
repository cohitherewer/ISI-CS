 Bakery row

 Mumbai, Nov. 2: The second eyewitness in the Best Bakery carnage retrial today admitted during cross-examination that he had held back information while deposing yesterday, reports our special correspondent. 

 Raees Khan, a bakery worker who was seriously injured in the attack that left 14 dead, told the court yesterday that he left for his village in Uttar Pradesh after the carnage and did not move out. 

 Today, faced with a barrage of questions from the defence, the 19-year-old admitted that he had worked in a bar in Ulhasnagar town of Thane district, but pleaded he had forgotten about it.

 Activist Teesta Setalvad, who helped get the case reopened, denied Raees had lied under oath. ?It had slipped his mind?? she said. 

 But a defence counsel alleged on a television channel that Setalvad is tampering with evidence.

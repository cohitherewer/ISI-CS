 Canal case

 New Delhi, Sept. 14 (PTI): The Punjab government has informed the Supreme Court that it did not commit any illegality by terminating water-sharing agreements with neighbouring states and that it was under no obligation to build the Sutlej-Yamuna Link Canal despite earlier court orders.

 The state government said this in reply to a notice from the apex court following the presidential reference of the debate to it. The Centre had sought the court?s opinion on the constitutional validity of the Punjab Termination of Agreements Act, 2004.

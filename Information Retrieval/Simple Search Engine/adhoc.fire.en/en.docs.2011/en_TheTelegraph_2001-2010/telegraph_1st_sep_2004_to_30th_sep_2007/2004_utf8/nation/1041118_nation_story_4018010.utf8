 Patna, Nov. 17: The Indian Medical Association (IMA) today decided to resume emergency services in all government hospitals after Dr Nagendra Prasad, abducted from Vaishali on October 28, was released.

 However, the doctors refused to call off the strike as the police are yet to meet all their demands. 

 The relatives of Prasad thanked the IMA after the doctor returned home. ?My brother was kept in a dilapidated room at a village under Maheshpur police station. He managed to break the wall and escape at night,? the doctor?s brother, Samarendra Prasad, said. 

 He added that the abductors initially demanded Rs 50 lakh as ransom but were later willing to accept any amount. Prasad walked into a makeshift police station at Khagaria district this afternoon unharmed, chief secretary K.A.H. Subramanyam said.

 Confusion prevailed at the IMA meeting today as most doctors shouted down association president Vijay Shankar Singh as he sent out conciliatory gestures to the government and suggested calling off the strike. For a moment, it seemed that a compromise was being worked out at the behest of the government. 

 ?The government is now sensitive to our problems and wants us to end the strike so that the people do not suffer,? Singh said before being shouted down at the meeting. 

 Then, a doctor, A.K. Singh, snatched a revolver from his security guard and walked out of the meeting. He later held a news conference with about 24 other doctors and announced they were ending the strike at once. 

 ?We don?t want the public to suffer just because one of us was killed,? he reasoned. 

 ?Let the state administration too be handed over to the army. This corrupt government cannot protect us,? said another doctor at the IMA meeting.

 With the army and railways allowing the general public to use their hospitals, patients have heaved a sigh of relief, at least for the time being. ?More patients have arrived here since last night. All the doctors are present in the hospital,? said a guard at the Danapur army hospital. 

 In a twist to the Agrawal murder, Kotwali police in Patna today arrested Ram Parvesh Sharma, a security guard of Bihar director-general of police, Narayan Mishra. Sharma?s son Anjay alleged asked for extortion money from Agrawal?s family on behalf of jailed criminal Bindu Singh. 

 An IMA delegation today met health minister Shakil Choudhary. The government is understood to have assured the doctors that they need not worry about security. ?We have the verbal assurance (of the government). We want it to be given in writing and then we shall consider ending the strike,?the IMA chief said.

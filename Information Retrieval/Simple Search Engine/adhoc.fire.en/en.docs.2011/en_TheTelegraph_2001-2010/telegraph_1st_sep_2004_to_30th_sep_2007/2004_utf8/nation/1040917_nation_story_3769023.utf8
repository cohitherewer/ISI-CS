 Love wins over communal passions

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 Meerut, Sept. 16: Ruby Chaudhary and Waseem Saifi?s inter-religious romance has survived communal passions in their western Uttar Pradesh hometown.

 ?It is a triumph of love and human values over religious enmity,? 26-year-old Ruby said on Sunday after a court here acknowledged their marriage and decreed they live as husband and wife.

 Their parents and community leaders, too, have grudgingly fallen in line.

 The romance blossomed over a couple of years ago in the communally sensitive Hashimpura block town of Ghaziabad district, where love between couples from the two communities is not tolerated. 

 ?We fell in love when she was doing her graduation and I was in high school,? said Waseem, 22, now a commerce graduate. ?It was unusual because I was younger than her but that is how it happened.?

 Scared of their families, which were on friendly terms, the couple masked their fondness for each other as sibling affection. But rumours put the families on alert and they cracked down on their wards. Community leaders urged both families to ignore the buzz over the relationship.

 Things, however, came to a head five months ago when Ruby, under pressure from her family to get married, eloped with Waseem on April 1 and underwent a registry marriage at Nizamuddin in Delhi.

 The news travelled fast and community leaders from both sides in Hashimpura threatened to take the issue to the streets. Under pressure, both families lodged separate complaints at Kasana police station in Ghaziabad.

 Fearing for themselves and their families, the couple filed a writ petition at Allahabad High Court in June seeking protection. During this time, The Telegraph had spoken to the couple at their hideouts in Delhi and reported their predicament.

 Some of their friends in Delhi and an advocate sought a family reconciliation at the latter?s chamber at Tis Hazari courts. The couple?s parents met but reverted to their intransigent positions on returning home. Waseem?s father Ayub Saifi, a timber trader, stuck to his FIR, claiming Ruby was not acceptable as his daughter-in-law though she had converted to Islam. Her father, Brijpal Singh, stood by his complaint that Ruby was abducted by Waseem.

 ?Jalne wale bahut hoten hain (There are many people who are jealous),? says Ruby, recalling their return home on September 10 after five months on the run, braving the wrath of the communities.

 But there was no respite. Ghaziabad police arrested Waseem on September 11 and then swooped down on his family home at night. The police also tried to take Ruby into custody. ?They dragged me inside a car and when I tried to stop them, a cop held my legs so tight and sat on them that in the pushing and jostling, one got fractured,? she says.

 Local sympathisers went berserk and attacked the police and set a vehicle on fire. Meerut police, cooperating in the case, stepped in and urged the couple to surrender in court.

 The next day was Sunday but a special court was convened as communal passions were riding high. They appeared before additional district magistrate Shreesh Dubey.

 Ruby argued: ?We knew what we were doing. In a democratic country, we have been legally authorised to live as husband and wife.?

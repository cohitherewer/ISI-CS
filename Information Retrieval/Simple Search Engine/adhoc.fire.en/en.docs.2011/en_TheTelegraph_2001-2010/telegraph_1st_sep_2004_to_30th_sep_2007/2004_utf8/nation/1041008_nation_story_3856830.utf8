 Advani accuses, Cong counters

 Mumbai, Oct. 7: BJP leader .K. Advani today slammed the Congress-led government for its ?short-sighted? agenda of targeting political opponents and claimed the United Progressive Alliance is ?weak and vulnerable?.

 A day after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh?s assertion that there were no two centres of power, the leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha accused Congress chief Sonia Gandhi of assuming extra-constitutional authority in the ?guise? of heading the national advisory council.

 ?This government is weak and vulnerable due to three main reasons ? devaluation of the office of the Prime Minister, dilution of the nationalist ethos of the government and total discord in the decision-making process,? Advani said here.

 Advani said the Centre was ?pushing its short-sighted agenda of confrontation and vindictiveness towards political opponents? and cited as example the decision to wind up the Justice Phukan Commission probing the Tehelka scandal and hand over the inquiry to the CBI.

 The leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha said never before has an executive body like the CBI taken over a probe from a judicial commission to target political opponents. The accusation came a day after the Prime Minister had said in Mumbai that the panel was not able to produce a report in three years and had no justification to exist in a poor country like India.

 Advani said other examples of the government?s attitude of confrontation were its decision to sack governors appointed by the NDA regime, ?detoxification? of history textbooks and the railway minister?s decision to order a fresh probe into the Godhra carnage.

 A commission to recommend ?communal? reservation for religious and linguistic minorities, imprisonment of former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Uma Bharti for hoisting the Tricolour and ?humiliating? freedom fighter Veer Savarkar were also methods the government adopted to further its politics of negativism and minoritism, Advani said.

 The war of words heated up with the Congress countering his charges. ?We deny Advani?s statement that the UPA government is weak and vulnerable. (The) BJP is pursuing an agenda to divide the country and society on the line of hatred for its narrow political gains,? spokesperson Jayanti Natrajan said in Delhi. 

 ?They (BJP) have not reconciled to the fact that they lost the Lok Sabha elections and are sitting in the Opposition. They are not ready to play the role of constructive Opposition,? she said.

 On Advani?s charge that Sonia was functioning as a super Prime Minister, she said it ?does not behove of Advani to criticise the functioning of the UPA government as he himself had functioned as a ?super Prime Minister? during NDA rule.

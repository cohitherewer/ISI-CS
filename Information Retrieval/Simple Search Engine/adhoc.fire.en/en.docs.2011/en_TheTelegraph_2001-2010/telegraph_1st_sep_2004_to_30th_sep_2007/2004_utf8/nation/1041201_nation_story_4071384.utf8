 Congress workers veto RJD tie-up

 K.C. PHILIP 

 Patna, Nov. 30: Strong protests by workers against an alliance with the RJD for the Assembly elections ? at the daylong meeting of the Congress here today ? set the tone for another round of political uncertainty in the party. 

 Sri Krishna Memorial Hall echoed with loud protests every time party leaders spoke about an ?understanding? with Laloo Prasad Yadav?s RJD, suggesting that the state Congress workers have not forgotten the ?humiliation? the party faced during the last Lok Sabha elections, when it could contest only a handful of seats. 

 Senior leaders from Delhi reminded the state workers of the party?s age-old tradition of ?patriotism and selfless sacrifice? but they also maintained that the party will never sacrifice its ?dignity and respect? in the state if it has to enter into an alliance with the RJD. 

 ?We will apprise the high command of your feelings. The party leadership in Delhi will take the final decision in keeping with the party?s tradition. I can assure you that Sonia Gandhiji will never disregard your feelings,? said Harikesh Bahadur, in-charge of Bihar affairs and AICC general secretary Satyavrat Chaturvedi. 

 Congress legislature party leader Vijay Shankar Dubey was shouted down by the audience on several occasions for his suggestion to be realistic and open to an alliance with the RJD. ?To hell with your government and alliance. We can stand on our own feet. We may lose power but not our dignity,? the workers shouted. 

 Members of the audience also called some leaders ?agents? of Laloo Prasad. 

 While showering praises on state party chief Ramjathan Sinha and president Sonia Gandhi, every speaker stressed that the Congress has only grown in stature in the past two years. 

 ?We are not handicapped any longer nor do we need a stretcher to keep going. We can give a decent fight on our own under the leadership of Soniaji,? said Nikhil Kumar, MP from Aurangabad. 

 ?Trust us, allow us to contest all the 242 seats on our own. We assure you that we will win more seats than what we will under the shadow of Laloo Prasad,? said a district party president, Mritunjay Kumar. 

 General secretary Chaturvedi assured that Sonia Gandhi will visit the state in the near future. ?You have to turn up in large numbers and show your strength and support when she arrives,? he said. 

 State Congress chief Sinha said some workers do not hesitate to ?harm the party?s image by working against its interests in the state, which will not be tolerated?.

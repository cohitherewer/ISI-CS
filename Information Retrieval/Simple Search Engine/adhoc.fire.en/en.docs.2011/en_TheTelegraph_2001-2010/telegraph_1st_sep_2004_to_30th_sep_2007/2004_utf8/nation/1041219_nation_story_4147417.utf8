 Don finger on godman

 Srivastava: Rajiv link

 Lucknow, Dec. 18: Recently acquitted in the St Kitts forgery case, self-styled godman Chandraswami today found himself under fire once again after a former associate said he had evidence of his involvement in Rajiv Gandhi?s assassination.

 Gangster Babloo Srivastava today stunned the media here by saying: ?I have evidence to establish Chandraswami?s links to the (Rajiv) assassination. I want the CBI to issue me summons.? It is not clear why he is accusing Chandraswami so many years after the killing. 

 The gangster said he was ?with the tantrik (Chandraswami)? at the Safdarjang house of a wrestler Dara Singh ?the day Rajiv Gandhi was killed in Sriperumbudur (on May 21, 1991)?. The godman would stay in this house whenever he was in Delhi.

 ?He got the message in 10 minutes after the assassination. Chandraswami looked joyous over the news. He immediately picked up the phone to talk to a very senior Congress leader for two hours,? said Srivastava when he was brought to King George Medical College Hospital here for treatment from Bareilly jail. The gangster, who is linked with Dubai-based don Chhota Rajan, has 42 cases pending against him.

 Chandraswami?s alleged involvement in the assassination has never been proved in court, though the CBI recently opposed his plea to go abroad saying it was investigating an allegation that he had financed the murder. The bureau said it had ?collected evidence? of his involvement. A Delhi court denied him permission to travel abroad on Monday.

 These developments may have prompted Srivastava to come out against the godman, with whom he fell out some years ago. The rift dates back to the August 1998 murder of journalist Rajendra Jain. The Mumbai crime branch suspected the involvement of Chandraswami, whom the journalist had implicated before the Jain Commission.

 Gang rivalry between dons Dawood Ibrahim and Rajan is also said to have contributed to the Srivastava-Chandraswami estrangement.

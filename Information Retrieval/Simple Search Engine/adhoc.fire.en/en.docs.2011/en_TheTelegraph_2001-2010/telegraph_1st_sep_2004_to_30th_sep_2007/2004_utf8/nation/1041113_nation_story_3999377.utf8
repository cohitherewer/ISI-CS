 Sangh snarls, BJP muted

 New Delhi, Nov. 12: The Sangh parivar is again in two minds, this time not on Ayodhya or Uma Bharti but the arrest of the Kanchi Sankaracharya, Jayendra Saraswati. The RSS and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) denounced the arrest but the BJP was muted in its criticism. 

 BJP sources said they were still assessing the dramatic developments culminating in his arrest before issuing a ?considered? response because the episode had ?several dimensions?. 

 One, the decision was taken by Jayalalithaa, the leader of a National Democratic Alliance constituent, who, a source admitted, could not be accused of being ?anti-Hindu?. If anything, Jayalalithaa, the source added, had endeared herself to the Sangh parivar because she often sounded more Hindu than any of them, had banned religious conversions, was generous in funding temple trusts and supported Narendra Modi during the Gujarat riots. 

 If the arrest had a ?personal? angle, involving just the sankaracharya and the ADMK chief ? after reports suggested their relations had soured ? then the source said the party should keep its counsel to itself. 

 BJP general secretary Arun Jaitley issued a lukewarm response in the evening, questioning the ?haste? with which the seer was arrested.

 The other aspect was the BJP?s own long equation with the seer. From Atal Bihari Vajpayee, George Fernandes and Murli Manohar Joshi to Yashwant Sinha, Jaswant Singh and Jagmohan, the sankaracharya had no dearth of followers in the BJP and NDA. 

 Sources believed he was among those instrumental in persuading business not to get put off by the BJP?s swadeshi shibboleths. 

 When Vajpayee was the Prime Minister, the seer came close to resolving the temple-mosque issue despite the VHP?s reservations. 

 He cajoled members of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board to accept a formula which laid out that if they relinquished claim over the disputed site, the opposing side would never raise the other ?disputes? in Mathura and Kashi. But the VHP and BJP hardliners put a spanner in the wheel and resurrected Mathura and Kashi. 

 The formula came unstuck and the seer lost the halo around him as a neutral arbiter who commanded the respect of Hindus and Muslims alike. 

 Today, the VHP rallied behind him and called his arrest an ?onslaught on Hindus?. ?This is for the first time in the history of the Hindus that a sankaracharya has been arrested. Why was the seer arrested all of a sudden while performing trikal puja?? asked general secretary Praveen Togadia.

 Backed by the RSS, the VHP will hold rallies from tomorrow to demand his release.

 VHP president Ashok Singhal put it down to Sonia Gandhi. ?There is a conspiracy by the Islamic and Christian forces to marginalise the cultural heritage and tradition of 80 crore Hindus in this country.?

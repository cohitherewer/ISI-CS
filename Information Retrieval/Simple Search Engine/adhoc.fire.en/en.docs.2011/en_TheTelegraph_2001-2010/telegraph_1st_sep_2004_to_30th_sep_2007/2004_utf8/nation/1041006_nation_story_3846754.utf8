 Cong cautious on Vidarbha

 K. SUBRAHMANYA

 Nagpur, Oct. 5: With less than two weeks to go for the Assembly polls, Congress leaders clamouring for a separate Vidarbha state have been silenced.

 The Congress-NCP manifesto released on Friday ? almost a week after the process of filing nominations for the October 13 polls got over ? makes no mention of the statehood issue.

 Former state Congress chief Ranjit Deshmukh had tried to use the Vidarbha card to remain the centre of power in Maharashtra in the run-up to the Assembly polls, although he was removed from the top post in July.

 His Vidarbha region colleagues Vasant Sathe and .K.P. Salve had done the same before the Lok Sabha polls.

 Deshmukh had reckoned that the high command would give in to his demands if he played on the ?emotive? statehood issue. He did extract odd concessions with half-a-dozen loyalists making it to the list of nominees for the polls.

 However, Deshmukh had erred in taking for granted that Vidarbha would figure in the manifesto when he made a public assertion here recently that he would retire from the contest if the party failed to make a commitment on carving out a separate state. 

 On Friday evening, he had no face to show.

 As he went underground soon after the manifesto was released, Deshmukh?s supporters shut down his central campaign office in the city. But by Saturday evening, the leader was back in action.

 Later, Deshmukh called a news conference where he took out from his pocket a letter he supposedly got from Singh assuring him that the party had not given up the matter. ?I am fully satisfied and continuing in the poll fray,? he declared.

 The move has helped Deshmukh avert the fate that befell on Sathe and Salve ? both have lost political clout after playing the Vidarbha card.

 The Congress leadership is convinced that Vidarbha is not a live political issue for the people. The manifesto chose to talk about backwardness rather than statehood.

 Campaign strategists are looking at strengthening the Congress-NCP base across the state without harming its chances in the Vidarbha region, where it lost 10 of the 11 Lok Sabha seats in May to the Sena-BJP combine.

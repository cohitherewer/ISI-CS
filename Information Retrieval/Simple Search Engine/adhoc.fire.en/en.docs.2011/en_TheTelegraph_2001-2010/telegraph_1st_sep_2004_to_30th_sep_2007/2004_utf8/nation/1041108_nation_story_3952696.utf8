 Student returns, as investor

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, Nov. 7: An alumnus of Anna University?s Madras Institute of Technology will invest Rs 8 crore in a research and development centre for his alma mater.

 K.B. Chandrasekhar, chairman of three software companies, returned to India from the US in 1998 to begin an experiment in private sector-university partnership for the ?creation of new technologies and products?. His desire to ?come back home and contribute to India?s development? has resulted in the AU-KBC Research Centre.

 Nearly four years after it was conceptualised by a dedicated team of distinguished researchers, engineers and technocrats led by Chandrasekhar, the AU-KBC Research Centre has unveiled its first set of 12 products, technologies and knowhow that it has developed and tested and is ?ready for commercialisation?.

 Chandrasekhar, who is chairman of JamCracker Inc. (the US), e4E Inc. (the US and Bangalore) and Aztec Software (Bangalore), announced the products here along with Anna University vice-chancellor E. Balagurusamy and C.N. Krishnan, director of the AU-KBC Research Centre and professor of electronics, Madras Institute of Technology.

 After completing his engineering at the institute, Chandrasekhar went to the US and started a software company there which he said was ?one of the early Indian entrepreneur-led US company that went public in the US?.

 ?Our goal is to build a world-class research centre in India,? he said. The research centre, headed by Chandrasekhar?s former university teacher, has offered up to 70 of its personnel, including top professors, research scholars and students, to create a ?unique inter-disciplinary research team?.

 At present, the centre is focusing on research in life sciences and information sciences, which Chandrasekhar believes is possible over the next 15 years, especially in frontier areas such as nano-biology.

 Krishnan said the new products and technologies developed at the centre dealt broadly with security for computer networks, language technologies and wireless technology. Of these, four are ready-to-use products.

 The first is a ?web guard? ? a hardware solution ?designed to keep fraudulent information and defaced pages from being published on a website?. Krishnan said the web guard, which the Union information technology ministry is in the process of certifying, is crucial for the integrity of all e-governance systems that the central and state governments are planning.

 The AU-KBC centre has also developed a ?public key infrastructure? that will ensure e-mails, chats and file transfers through computer networks are ?safe and secure?. 

 The centre has developed ?machine translation systems? involving Tamil to Hindi and English to Tamil and a ?multi-lingual search engine for Indian languages? on the lines of Google, Krishnan said.

 At the national level, Anna University is coordinating an effort by 13 groups to develop a programme of ?voice-based multi-lingual access system?. The development of ?machine translation systems? is part of this project.

 An ?industrial pattern recognition system? for recognising human faces to mark attendance at workplaces is another technology the centre is developing.

 Chandrasekhar has also funded AU-KBC Research Foundation Pvt. Ltd., which was formed four years ago to support the activities of the research centre. Since the university cannot directly commercialise these products and technologies, it inked an agreement recently with the research company assigning it the ?commercialisation rights? for a three-year period. The university is providing the infrastructure and other facilities at its campus.

 ?Under the agreement, the research company is willing to pay a royalty of 10 per cent to Anna University on their sales and that money will again be ploughed back into research activities,? vice-chancellor Balagurusamy said. 

 Chandrasekhar said the mass production of the centre?s products, which have entered the commercial phase, will be licensed to companies that possess a sound and wide distribution network.

 SC admits Vaiko anti-terror plea 

 New Delhi (PTI): The Supreme Court on 

 Friday admitted petitions of Vaiko and eight other MDMK 

 members against a Chennai court rejecting an application 

 seeking withdrawal of anti-terror law cases against them.

 A bench of Justices S.. Variava and H.K. Sema, while admitting the petitions, stayed further proceedings before the designated anti-terror law court and also issued a notice to the Tamil Nadu government.

 A public prosecutor had filed the application after the central terror law review committee had ruled that prima facie there was no evidence to invoke the anti-terror law against Vaiko and others for their speech in Madurai on June 29, 2002, allegedly in support of the banned organisation, LTTE.

 On September 3, a designated Chennai court had denied permission to the Tamil Nadu government to withdraw the case against him and said the trial would go on.

 Designated judge . Rajendran had held that the state had concluded the issue without having any opportunity to analyse the material relied upon by the prosecution.

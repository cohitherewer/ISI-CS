 Jammu rolls out red carpet for Pak pilgrims

 Jammu, Oct. 26: The drumbeats said it all.

 Fear gave way to instant relief as the Pakistani pilgrims walked into a rousing welcome from several hundred people jostling with each other to garland them.

 ?It is unbelievable,? said Syed Bashir Andrabi, one of the pilgrims, as he was swept away in the crush of the welcoming throng.

 The pilgrims, allowed into the state for the first time since 1947 so that they could visit various shrines, could not have hoped for a warmer reception. ?You are welcome to this city of temples,? read the banners as residents of all faiths beat drums and lined up at the railway station.

 At Raghunath temple, the site of two militant strikes in 2002, the pilgrims were told that the Hindus had stayed calm and did not retaliate though one of their most revered shrines had been attacked, an act believed to have Pakistan?s backing.

 ?It was a Muslim police officer who fought the terrorists and rescued Hindu pilgrims,? Mahant Shiv Dass, a priest of the 150-year-old temple, told the visitors.

 The pilgrims, awed by the architectural beauty of the temple they had heard a lot about, offered prayers for peace. They were also taken to St Mary?s Church, the Sikh temple at Nanak Nagar and the Baba Buddan Shah shrine before they took a flight to Srinagar.

 The pilgrimage, which followed the ?successful? visit of 14 Pakistani journalists to the state earlier this month, raised hopes of an early end to hostilities. An overwhelmed Mohammed Iqbal, one of the visitors, said what he had experienced in a few hours here had confirmed his belief that ?peace is on the anvil?.

 ?I know it is going to be permanent. Our prayers would be answered,? he added as others in the 12-member group echoed him.

 ?Good days are about to return and Indo-Pakistan relations would offer a role model to the world in not too distant a future,? said another visitor from across the border. ?We are sure that we will live to see that day.?

 The pilgrimage exchange programme has been organised by the Association of Peoples of Asia (APA), a non-profit group working for peace in militancy-racked Jammu and Kashmir and better ties between India and Pakistan.

 Farooq Mughal, the organising secretary of the association, said the arrival of the pilgrims and the welcome they were given had proved that religion and pilgrimages could show the way to permanent peace.

 ?It is a good omen for our state,? he said.

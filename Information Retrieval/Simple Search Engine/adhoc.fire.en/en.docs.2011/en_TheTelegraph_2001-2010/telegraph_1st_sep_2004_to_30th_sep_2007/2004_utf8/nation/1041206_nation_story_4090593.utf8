 Opp. in rally protest

 DEBABRATA MOHANTY

 Bhubaneswar, Dec. 5: Opposition leaders in Orissa would march to Raj Bhavan here tomorrow to press their demand for the resignation of chief minister Naveen Patnaik following the high court?s verdict in the Tangarpada mining issue.

 Last month, Orissa High Court quashed a joint venture between Jindal Strips Ltd and the state-owned Industrial Corporation Limited (Idcol) for the exploration of chromite mines at Tangarpada in Dhenkanal district. 

 The winter session of the Orissa Assembly began on a stormy note on Friday when members of the Congress-led Opposition, armed with cymbals, took to the well of the House. 

 Although Speaker Maheswar Mohanty tried to intervene, the sound of the cymbals made it impossible for those present to hear his instructions.

 Leader of Opposition and veteran Congressman J.B. Patnaik has declared that there would be no let-up in protests over the mining deals. He demanded that the chief minister should resign and face the consequence of criminal prosecution. 

 There are instances of chief ministers, among others, resigning following adverse verdicts by courts or judicial commissions, the Congress leader remarked. 

 Stating that the high court has clearly ?indicted? the government in the Tangarpada mines case, Patnaik said the state exchequer would have been poorer Rs 20,000 crore had it not intervened on time.

 In another development, the government on Friday filed a special leave petition in the Supreme Court to challenge the high court?s order, which quashed the joint venture between Idcol and Jindal Strips Ltd.

 Earlier, the chief minister had said the government would move the apex court after discussing the matter with the advocate-general and the industries department. 

 The petition could give the government a much-needed breather in the wake of protests by the Opposition.

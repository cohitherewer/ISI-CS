 Admission scam

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 9: A person has been arrested for duping about 10 couples of Rs 29 lakh after promising their wards admission to reputed schools. 

 Praveen Khanna, a resident of Lajpat Nagar, liberally used letterheads of Union ministers, their secretaries and various school authorities to impress parents and write letters of recommendation.

 Police seized letterheads attributed to former HRD minister Murli Manohar Joshi and MP Jagdambi Prasad Yadav, among others, and letters of recommendation typed on them from Khanna?s car. They also found cheques made out by the parents, some in the name of schools and some addressed ?self?. Khanna was arrested today on a complaint from Amit Gupta and parents of 10 other children. Gupta, who has a five-year-old son, had paid Khanna Rs 3 lakh. 

 Khanna is an engineer and his father and brother are doctors. Police said he visited reputed schools to target desperate parents. He would ask for Rs 3 to 5 lakh, depending on the capacity of the couple, to get their children admitted to schools of their choice. 

 If a child got admission on his own, he kept the money, charging a portion as commission and claiming to have paid the rest as donation to the school. If one failed, he returned a part of the money with the promise to pay up the rest later. But he never did.

 BJP passes House buck to govt

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 23: The BJP has put the onus of running Parliament smoothly on the ruling United Progressive Alliance government, a week before the winter session of Parliament begins.

 At an all-party meeting presided over by Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee, former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee said there have been disturbances in the past and it had always been the government?s responsibility to run Parliament.

 Former deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani blamed the government for not ?listening? to Opposition members. BJP members, he alleged, are not allowed to ask questions.

 The BJP assured the Speaker it would not disrupt Lok Sabha proceedings but made it clear it alone was not responsible for keeping the House on rails. During the raucous budget session, the Opposition MPs had targeted the Speaker and accused him of playing a partisan.

 Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Nirupam said they should be allowed to raise the issue of Kanchi seer Jayendra Saraswati?s arrest or else there could be trouble in the House. 

 The BJP has spelled out the issues it will raise in the House ? inflation, internal security and the seer?s arrest. 

 Defence minister Pranab Mukherjee said India would begin to look like Pakistan if Parliament is not allowed to function.

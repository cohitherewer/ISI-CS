 Warring allies set Dussehra target

 New Delhi, Oct. 20: After three days of bickering over government formation in Maharashtra that threatened to take the shine off their poll victory, the Congress and the NCP today gave themselves another three days to work out a power-sharing arrangement.

 ?Hopefully, we should be announcing some decision on Dussehra,? said Margaret Alva, the Congress general secretary in charge of Maharashtra. Her NCP counterpart, Devi Prasad Tripathi, also expects a breakthrough by Saturday.

 The rotation system, with the two parties taking turns to hold the chief minister?s post, could be a way out. This was informally suggested to NCP chief Sharad Pawar by senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad on Monday night. 

 ?The NCP could consider the rotation system if the Congress makes a formal proposal,? a party source said. 

 While the NCP would like to have the first shot at the chief minister?s post, indications are that ?as a last option?, it could be prepared to take over in the second half of the term if the deal is attractively packaged.

 Offers that could make this option attractive for the NCP include renaming the alliance NCP-Congress-RPI, allotting 55 per cent of the 43 maximum available ministry slots to its nominees, plum portfolios for its members, formation of a steering committee for the Democratic Front coalition with a party candidate at its head and a better deal in the Manmohan Singh government.

 The NCP?s ?last option? solution to the stalemate could turn out to be the best bet for Sushil Kumar Shinde, who stepped down as chief minister yesterday, because the party would prefer him to continue for another two-and-a-half years because of his known proximity to Pawar.

 But as its first preference, the NCP would press for the chief minister?s post for the full term. Its second choice would be to get the post for the first half of the term in a rotation system.

 Alva described the next three days as a ?cool off? period. For the record, she said that since most leaders negotiating the government formation, including Pranab Mukherjee, would be away in their own states for Dussehra, the talks would resume only after the festivities.

 Congress sources said party leaders were divided on chief ministership. While publicly the party has claimed the post for its nominee, a section believes the ?confusion? could have been avoided by conceding the NCP?s right to provide the next chief minister because it has won more seats.

 ?Probably, in view of the conflicting views in the party, we may all leave it to Congress president Sonia Gandhi to take a decision,? said a senior party leader.

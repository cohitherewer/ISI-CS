 Uma buzz gives Gaur headache

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Uma

 Bhopal, Dec. 25: Uma Bharti?s return to the BJP fold has demoralised Madhya Pradesh chief minister Babulal Gaur and a section of the local party unit.

 The buzz in Bhopal is that the firebrand sadhvi, whose suspension from the party was lifted yesterday, will be back as chief minister after February?s Assembly elections in Bihar and Jharkhand. But this was denied by Madhya Pradesh BJP chief Kailash Joshi who said local MLAs as well as the central BJP leadership are firmly behind Gaur.

 However, Uma?s supporters argue otherwise. They say Uma?s comeback without being made to mince her words indicates that the BJP needs her more than she needs the party. The sadhvi?s aides add that her hostility towards BJP central office bearers like Pramod Mahajan, Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley suggests that BJP chief L.K. Advani is unlikely to make her a party functionary.

 Thus, a return to state politics as chief minister would be no surprise.

 However, given the situation in Madhya Pradesh, dislodging Gaur will not be easy. The septuagenarian chief minister has few enemies in the cabinet or the state BJP unit who might want to support an ?oust Gaur? campaign.

 The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and its allied organisations have also given their tacit support to Gaur. The BJP?s regional satraps ? former Union ministers Vikram Verma, Sumitra Mahajan and Shivraj Singh Chauhan ? prefer having Gaur in the saddle to keep Uma at bay.

 The chief minister himself had been careful not to burn his bridges with Uma but her recent remark that Gaur did not have the support of ?even a single BJP MLA? has incensed him. Gaur responded by threatening ministers loyal to the sadhvi that he would ?review? their performance and might drop them from the ministerial council.

 Another sticking point cropped up when Uma visited Bhopal recently as a ?private citizen?. Madhya Pradesh ministers and party MLAs were informally discouraged from calling on a ?suspended (BJP) member?. The former chief minister did not take kindly to this and told her confidants she would ?settle scores? another time.

 All eyes are now on the Bihar polls where Uma is expected to take on Laloo Prasad Yadav. Going by the mood here, it would appear that many of her party colleagues would like her to fail. Bihar might hold the key to Madhya Pradesh politics.

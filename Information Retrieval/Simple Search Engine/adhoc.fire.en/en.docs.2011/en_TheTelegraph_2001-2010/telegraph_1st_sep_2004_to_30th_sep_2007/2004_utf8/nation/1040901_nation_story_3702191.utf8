 Delhi hardens stance on peace

 PRANAY SHARMA

 New Delhi, Aug. 31: India seems to have hardened its stand on Pakistan days before foreign ministers of the two countries meet here to take the peace process forward.

 Highlighting a sharp increase in infiltration across the Line of Control, Delhi has said Islamabad is responsible for not stopping cross-border violence and for rejecting a proposed extradition treaty.

 Foreign minister Natwar Singh has promised to discuss infiltration and cross-border terrorism when he meets his Pakistani counterpart Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri here on Sunday and Monday to review the peace process.

 Until now, Pakistan has reacted in a mature and restrained manner, asking India to lower the rhetoric and ensure that progress is made at the talks and in the peace process. But Delhi has decided to do some plainspeaking.

 The tough stand stems from Pakistan putting the onus of peace talks on Delhi. Islamabad has also said unless there is movement on Kashmir, the ongoing dialogue may not be very successful.

 Keeping up the pressure on Pakistan, national security adviser J.. Dixit today said Kashmir should not hold people in the subcontinent hostage. Instead, he said the neighbours should try to further economic and trade ties.

 But the United Progressive Alliance government appears to have dug itself into a spot. Having categorically said it will not withdraw from talks irrespective of whether cross-border terrorism continues, Delhi now finds itself without a bargaining chip against Islamabad.

 The change in stand was noticed by a group of Pakistani parliamentarians and intellectuals currently visiting the country. 

 At a morning interaction with the media today, they said hiccups seem to have appeared in bilateral ties and it is being asked if the honeymoon is over.

 Former foreign minister Gohar Ayub Khan, who is part of the Pakistani team, said the dialogue ought to be sustained, even though there would be many provocations along the way.

 Prisoner swap

 The neighbours exchanged 55 prisoners at the Wagah border today as part of the confidence-building measures.

 Indian officials delivered 19 prisoners, including six children and three women, to Pakistani authorities, who in turn handed over 36 men to the Border Security Force.

 Officials said most of those released were arrested for crossing the border or illegal stay. The ceremony was delayed by at least six hours as Indian officials failed to reach the venue, 20 km east of Lahore, on time because of Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs visit to Amritsar.

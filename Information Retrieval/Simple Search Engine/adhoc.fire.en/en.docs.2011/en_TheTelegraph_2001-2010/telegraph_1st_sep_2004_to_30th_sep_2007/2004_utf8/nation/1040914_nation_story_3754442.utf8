 Alert on ?silent killer? salt 

 AMIT ROY

 London, Sept. 13: People should drastically reduce their salt consumption because it leads to high blood pressure, heart disease and strokes, the UK?s Food Standards Agency (FSA) warned today.

 The warning will have particular significance for Indians who are known to be above-average consumers of salt in spicy food.

 John Krebs, chairman of the FSA, said: ?High blood pressure really is the ?silent killer? as those living with it are three times more likely to develop heart disease and stroke, and twice as likely to die from these diseases as those with normal levels. The human cost in terms of illness and death and the costs to the National Health Service are very high.?

 He added: ?Cutting down on salt can significantly reduce your risk of developing high blood pressure.?

 Krebs emphasised: ?We have a very simple health message: too much salt is bad for your health. By reducing your salt intake you can rapidly decrease your risk. So there are rapid health benefits of a change.?

 Professor Carol Black, president of the Royal College of Physicians, backed the FSA by saying: ?People need to receive clear advice about salt and associated health risks to enable them to make appropriate changes to their own salt intake for their future health.?

 A well-known Indian chef, Udit Sarkhel, who studied medicine in Calcutta before taking up food as a career, agreed: ?This warning should be taken seriously, nowhere more so than by the people of Calcutta.?

 He said: ?I accept Indians have more salt than other people. My interpretation is that salt enhances the taste of the various flavours present in Indian food. But you can achieve the same effect by using tamarind or a pinch of sugar. Salt does nothing for the body. You do need a little salt for daal or vegetables because they do not contain natural salt but meat, fish, chicken contain enough salt as it is.?

 Health experts are becoming increasingly aware that Indians in the UK are more prone to diseases of the heart if they stick to their traditional lifestyles ? little exercise and spicy diet rich in fat.

 Today?s advice from the FSA was aimed at the whole of the population, though. At least 26 million people a day in the UK consume more than the recommended 6gms daily limit of salt, according to the FSA. Men eat an average 11gms of salt a day ? equivalent to almost two level teaspoons ? while women consume around 8.1gms.

 It is estimated that blood pressure is responsible for 170,000 deaths a year in England. Experts say reducing salt intake would have ?significant public health benefits?.

 This is why the government is launching a ? 4 million TV, press and poster advertising campaign featuring a character called Sid the slug to encourage reduced use of salt.

 The problem for the government is that about 75 per cent of salt in diets comes from processed food. Among the biggest contributors are bread, breakfast cereals, biscuits, cakes, rice, flour and pasta. Only 10-15 per cent of the remaining salt is added during cooking or at the table, with a similar amount found naturally in certain foods.

 The government?s action is being supported by Professor Graham MacGregor, chairman of lobby group Consensus Action on Salt and Health, who said: ?Reducing salt intake will lower blood pressure and will save thousands of people dying or suffering from strokes, heart attacks and heart failure. Indeed, if successful, it will result in the biggest improvement in public health since the introduction of clean water and drains in the UK in the late 19th century.?

 Paul Lincoln, chief executive of the National Heart Forum, added: ?Reducing salt in the diet is one of those rare phenomena in public health ? a magic bullet that will benefit the whole population very quickly.?

 The government action is being opposed by the Salt Manufacturers? Association, which claimed the FSA had used ?disputed and questionable evidence?. 

 The trade body said the FSA had focused on salt when alcohol consumption and being overweight were major contributors to high blood pressure.Peter Sherratt, general secretary of the SMA, said: ?We need to get away from this suggestion that salt is public enemy number one.?

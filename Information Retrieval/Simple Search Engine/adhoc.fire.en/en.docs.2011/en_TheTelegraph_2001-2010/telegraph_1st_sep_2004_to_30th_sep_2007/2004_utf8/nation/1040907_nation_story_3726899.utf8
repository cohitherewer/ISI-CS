 SC blow to minister, poser to Bihar

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 6: The Supreme Court today stayed the Bihar governments withdrawal of criminal cases against Union minister Mohammad Taslimuddin and raised questions over the hurried manner in which the step was taken. 

 A division bench of Justices . Santosh Hegde and S.B. Sinha also stayed all the trial proceedings and issued notices to the Bihar government. It also issued a notice to Taslimuddin to reply why the withdrawal of cases against him should not be quashed.

 The stay and notices came on a petition by the Delhi Study Group (DSG) challenging the withdrawal of cases against the Union food and civil supplies minister. The DSG said the prosecution had moved to withdraw a case of attempt to murder immediately after Taslimuddin was made a minister though the case was pending since 1996.

 This case (which has been) kept pending since 1996... why did the government choose to move so fast now.... does this happen to every accused in the country? the judges asked, observing that the state government had shown mortal hurryin withdrawing the case.

 The court also took exception to the public prosecutor seeking a stay on the arrest warrant issued against the minister. Does it not show extraordinary interest on the part of the government? Justice Hegde asked. 

 Mukul Rohtagi, the senior counsel for DSG, mentioned that the application for withdrawal of the case was moved late in the day on August 14 by the Bihar government. The file was transferred to a magistrate at once and the arrest warrant was stayed all on the same day, he observed. 

 What is the mortal hurry in hearing the application seeking withdrawal of the case? What is the mortal urgency to withdraw the case? the judges asked.

 The arrest warrants against Taslimuddin were issued last month while Parliament was in session.

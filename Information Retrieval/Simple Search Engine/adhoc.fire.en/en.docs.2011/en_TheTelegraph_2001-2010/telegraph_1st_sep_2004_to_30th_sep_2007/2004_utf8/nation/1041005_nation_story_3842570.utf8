 Crores go down the drain

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 Phukan: Staying mum

 New Delhi, Oct. 4: After spending three-and-a-half years and crores to ascertain the veracity of the Tehelka tapes, the Justice Phukan commission of inquiry has been rendered redundant.

 Justice S.. Phukan, the retired Supreme Court judge who headed the panel, said ?it is the prerogative of the government? to make or break a commission under the Commission of Inquiry Act. 

 ?I have nothing to say at this moment as I have not received any communication... not even a telephone call from the government about this (dismantling the commission),? he said. ?It is the prerogative of the government to scrap the commission. They have done it.? 

 The commission was set up in March 2001 to investigate Tehelka?s ?Operation West-End? expose. It was led by Justice (retd) K. Venkataswami then.

 Justice Phukan took over a year later when Justice Venkataswami put in his papers after a controversy over his appointment to the Gold Control Board. The move was seen as an attempt by the then BJP-led government, whose ministers were the target of the expose, to get a clean chit from the judge. 

 ?It was the government which appointed me and now it is the government which is dismantling the commission,? Justice Phukan said.

 On the government?s decision to hand over the probe to the CBI, he said: ?The CBI can register a case provided a cognisable offence is made out.? 

 Justice Phukan added that he is yet to see the notification scrapping the commission and entrusting the matter to the country?s premier investigating agency.

 The commission must have ?eaten up? crores of rupees, an officer said, pointing to the ?mind-boggling? expenditure on foreign trips and services of the London forensic science department. 

 Besides, there were ?salaries and perks of the judges, staff and officers, investigating expenses, office and establishment costs, the hundreds of thousands of photocopies and transcripts and expenditure on telephones, electricity, water and the series of sittings? he added.

 Tarun Tejpal: Bitter

 Tejpal unmoved

 Tehelka CEO Tarun Tejpal did not welcome the government?s move to scrap the commission, but did not spare the panel of inquiry either. He said the commission was ?not interested in finding the truth?. 

 ?We have been all along asking for a fair and just inquiry. However, all that has happened over the last three-and-a-half years is that we have been targeted,? Tejpal told The Telegraph.

 Asked if the CBI would be any better, he said: ?The past track record of all government inquiries has not been encouraging, so what happens to this inquiry only time will tell.?

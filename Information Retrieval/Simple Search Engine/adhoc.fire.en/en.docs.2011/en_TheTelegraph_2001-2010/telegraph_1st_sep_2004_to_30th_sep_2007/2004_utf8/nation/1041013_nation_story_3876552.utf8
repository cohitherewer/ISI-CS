 Congress counts on sugar

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 Satara, Oct. 12: From sponsoring wrestling bouts in Kolhapur to disbursing loans for tractors, supplying milk, subsidising education and healthcare where necessary or offering these services at a premium to the affluent ? the sugar lobby of western Maharashtra is the key to its development and politics.

 Despite the presence of 40 bhandkors (rebels), the Congress-NCP retains the edge it has had for years, thanks to the blessings of the sugar barons. Of the 56 seats in Satara, Sangli, Pune, Kolhapur and Sholapur, the Congress and the NCP had bagged 49 in the last elections.

 Their leaders admitted they could lose ?two or three?, thanks to the rebels. If that happens, it could upset the alliance?s hopes to retain power, given the assessment that neighbouring Konkan is still a Shiv Sena-BJP stronghold, the BSP is eating into the Congress-NCP base in Vidarbha and Marathwada, north Maharashtra and Mumbai could throw up surprises.

 Sharad Pawar?s future would rest on the results in western Maharashtra. 

 The NCP?s campaign revolved on how a friendly dispensation at the Centre would help the region?s economy recover from the losses it suffered when the NDA was in power and, therefore, how important it was to defeat the bhandkors who would cohabit with the BJP-Sena if they were to wrest power, only to ruin western Maharashtra.

 Satish Kulkarni, a former NCP president of Satara, said the sugar movement had collapsed during the NDA?s regime. 

 ?We had one bumper crop after another. Yet the Vajpayee government preferred to import sugar from Pakistan than pick up our produce. In the case of our Satara candidate (Shivendra Bhosle), sugar worth Rs 20 crore is rotting in the godown of his mill. Sugar can be sold in the open market only with the Centre?s permission and this we did not get during the previous regime,? he said.

 Kulkarni charged the ?powerful? Maharashtra leaders of the BJP at the national level with manipulating sugar politics to ?break the back? of Pawar.

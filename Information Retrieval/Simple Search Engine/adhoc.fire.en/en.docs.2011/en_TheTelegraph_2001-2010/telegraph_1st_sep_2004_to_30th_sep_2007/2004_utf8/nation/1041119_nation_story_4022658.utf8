 Jammu, Nov. 18: Srinagar to Jammu, the thrust of Manmohan Singh?s appeal to people remained the same: Shun violence and let us build a prosperous Kashmir together.

 The Prime Minister today urged ?misguided? youths to give up violence and join the mainstream, promising them jobs in return.

 The freeze on recruitment in central government service would be lifted for the state, he told a rally here. 

 ?The ban imposed by the Centre will not apply to Jammu and Kashmir since youth in the state are facing hardships in getting jobs.?

 Singh said his government would work ?shoulder to shoulder? with the Mufti Mohammad Sayeed regime in the state to promote a reconstruction plan that would create more jobs in the next four to five years. 

 Efforts would be made to ensure that jobless youth get employment opportunities in the police and security forces.

 Repeating what he said in Srinagar yesterday, the Prime Minister said: ?My doors are open to all for talks without any condition.? Political parties, intellectuals and the civil society could play a major role in bringing peace, he added.

 But there would be no compromise with terrorism, Singh asserted.

 The Prime Minister said the Nehru-Gandhi family had always stood for all-round development of Jammu and Kashmir and that Congress president Sonia Gandhi has been mindful of the welfare of the state?s people.

 Sonia?s message to the people is to begin a ?new chapter? for the state and create an atmosphere of peace and security so that development projects envisaged in the Centre?s common minimum programme are fully implemented, he said.

 ?I can assure you that the Centre will work shoulder to shoulder with the state government to bring about an atmosphere of peace and to rid Jammu and Kashmir of poverty and unemployment.?

 As part of the reconstruction plan, efforts would be made to turn Jammu and Kashmir into a ?power-surplus? state in the next four to five years.

 ?With these development plans, we want to change the face of Jammu and Kashmir,? he said, adding that water supply, road and other infrastructure projects would also get attention.

 The Prime Minister announced opening of four new degree colleges in the border areas of Akhnoor, R.S. Pura and Samba besides four training institutes for women in Doda, Poonch, Rajouri and Udhampur by next year.

 Emphasising the need for enhancing job opportunities for women, he said the state government would try to set up one anganwadi centre in every village. ?This is expected to provide employment to 14,000 women.?

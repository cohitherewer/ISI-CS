 Push to ?rape? probe 

 KHELEN THOKCHOM

 Imphal, Nov. 11: The findings of the army?s inquiry into the custody death that triggered the agitation in Manipur will probably be announced before Prime Minister Manmohan Singh?s proposed visit to the state later this month.

 ?The army is under pressure from the Prime Minister?s Office to come clean in the Manorama case. We are expecting something from the army court before the Prime Minister?s arrival,? said a source in the Okram Ibobi Singh government. 

 Within seven days of its institution, the court of inquiry said in a preliminary report that there were ?some lapses? on the part of the Assam Rifles troops who arrested and shot dead Manorama Thangjam, but ruled out rape. 

 The Prime Minister had promised the Apunba Lup, the group leading the agitation against the armed forces special powers act, anybody found guilty in the case would not be spared.

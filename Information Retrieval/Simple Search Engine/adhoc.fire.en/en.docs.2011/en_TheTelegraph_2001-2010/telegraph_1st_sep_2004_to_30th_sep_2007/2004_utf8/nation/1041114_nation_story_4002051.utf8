 Arrest timing ruffles Centre

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 13: The Centre is awaiting a detailed report from Tamil Nadu governor S.S. Barnala on the arrest of the Kanchi sankaracharya on murder charges but there are indications that Delhi has not taken kindly to the timing and manner of the arrest.

 There is a view at the Centre that the Tamil Nadu government could have handled the case in a more sensitive manner and, perhaps, waited till after Diwali to make the arrest.

 The top brass of the Union home ministry has been in touch with the state government since late on Thursday when a Tamil Nadu police team arrested the seer, sources said.

 Senior officials at the Centre also spoke to Tamil Nadu counterparts to ascertain if the arrest could have been put off for a few days, said a source. However, they were told that the state police had conducted a thorough investigation and had gone ahead only after collecting irrefutable evidence, including phone transcripts, linking the seer with the murder.

 Publicly, the Centre pointed out that the state government was within its jurisdiction to make the arrest.

 However, this has not deterred the Vishwa Hindu Parishad from blaming the Left-backed United Progressive Alliance government for the arrest and sparing Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayalalithaa. VHP activists staged a demonstration and vowed to ?avenge? the arrest. They also sought a law giving some legal immunity to pontiffs.

 VHP working president Ashok Singhal said the sankaracharya?s arrest was an attack on the entire community ?as grave as the destruction of the Somnath temple centuries ago?. The VHP leader linked the arrest to the ?government of non-believers in this country?, in an obvious reference to the communists.

 Former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee said the sankaracharya?s arrest had shocked the nation and it was the government?s responsibility to ensure that he remained in good health and is able to perform his daily rituals. ?The manner in which he (the sankaracharya) was arrested has hurt the people more,? said Vajpayee, who hosted an iftar this evening.

 ?The court will do its work, but everyone should keep in mind that he is respected by crores of people. It is the government?s responsibility to take care of his health and it should be also kept in mind that he spends maximum time in performing religious rites,? he said.

 The chairman of the National Democratic Alliance had earlier spoken to Union home minister Shivraj Patil, who is learnt to have elaborated on the case.

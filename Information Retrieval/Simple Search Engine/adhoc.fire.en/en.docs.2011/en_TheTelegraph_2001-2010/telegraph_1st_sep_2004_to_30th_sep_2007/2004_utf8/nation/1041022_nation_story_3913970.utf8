 Bypoll push for expansion

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 21: The Congress is set to use its byelection success in Karnataka to stabilise its coalition ministry in the state even as it continues to battle another ally for the chief minister?s post in Maharashtra.

 Fresh from the Congress? success in the October 13 Bidar Lok Sabha bypoll, Karnataka chief minister Dha-ram Singh, who heads a coalition government that includes the Janata Dal (Secular), met Sonia Gandhi on Tuesday see-king approval for expanding his four-month-old ministry.

 The expansion of the 12-member ministry has been stalled for over two months because of factional rivalry wit-hin the Congress and differences with the Dal (Secular) which often gives the impression of being a reluctant ally.

 But Singh has seized the initiative within the Congress and gained the upper hand against the Dal (S) by wresting Bidar from the BJP, which had won the seat five times in a row. That the H.D. Deve Gowda-headed Janata Dal (S) finished third in the bypoll has improved the chief minister?s standing and helped him assert his authority.

 Singh now has the confidence to consider forming a full-fledged ministry. The Dal (S), which has been assertive all this while, has mellowed since the Bidar result and may settle for longer co-habitation with the Congress.

 Sources said Sonia has given Singh the nod for expanding the ministry and asked him to submit a clear proposal. The chief minister is expected here on Sunday for a detailed discussion with Sonia on the issue.

 But the party chief is unlikely to take up the expansion before sorting out the Maharashtra imbroglio with the Nationalist Congress Party. Sonia?s political secretary Ahmed Patel, who has been negotiating with Deve Gowda on expanding the Karnataka ministry, is one of Congress? negotiators with the NCP.

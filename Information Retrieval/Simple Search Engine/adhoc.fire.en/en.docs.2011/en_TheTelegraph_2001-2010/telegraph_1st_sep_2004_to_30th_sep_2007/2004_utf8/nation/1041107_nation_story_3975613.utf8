The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Wary allies plot strategy

 KAY BENEDICT

 New Delhi, Nov. 6: Alarmed at the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh?s attempts to get the BJP to ?return to Hindutva?, National Democratic Alliance partners have begun discussing a joint strategy to counter the move.

 Telugu Desam Party chief N. Chandrababu Naidu separately met NDA convener and Janata Dal (United) president George Fernandes and Dal (U) parliamentary party leader Sharad Yadav last night.

 They discussed ?parivar politics? and the political situation vis-?-vis the United Progressive Alliance government.

 The Desam chief spoke with Asom Gana Parishad leaders today.

 Sources close to Naidu would not say what was discussed, but said the NDA allies are worried by the ?BJP?s bid to return to the basics? and the faction squabbles that have engulfed it.

 Naidu is reportedly more worried than Fernandes by the developments in the BJP and the Sangh parivar and is trying to regroup regional parties to form an anti-BJP, anti-Congress platform.

 The former Andhra Pradesh chief minister is likely to talk to Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh and Trinamul Congress leaders Mamata Banerjee and P.A. Sangma.

 The BJP has agreed to convene an NDA meeting on November 15 to allay the allies? fears over a possible return to ?temple politics? after L.K. Advani?s appointment as party chief. But its partners are worried in the light of the spat between the VHP and BJP over Hindutva and RSS general secretary Mohan Bhagwat?s assurance today that the BJP will return to Hindutva.

 Bhagwat said the RSS would ?wait and watch? to see how the BJP returns to its roots. 

 The BJP?s allies have said they joined the NDA only after three contentious issues ? Article 370, uniform civil code and Ayodhya ? had been dropped from the alliance agenda. ?If any effort is now made to revive them, we shall have to take another road. We shall never compromise with religious bigotry,? Dal (U) spokesperson Shiv Kumar said.

 Sources said Naidu is particularly worried over the BJP factional feud which is out in the open. The Desam chief feels the power struggle among the BJP?s second-rung leaders is ?finishing? the party, and by association, its allies will also be weakened.

 Referring to the BJP?s squabbles, Naidu is learnt to have said: ?When you are not in power you should be very very careful. I am surprised at what is happening in the BJP when they are out of power. They are sending a wrong signal.?

 Job scheme hits hurdles

 MONOBINA GUPTA 

 New Delhi, Oct. 9: The government?s plan to run the re-invented food for work programme in 150 districts as part of a pilot project has hit several hurdles. Political pressure and implementation hassles threaten to derail the project. 

 On the one hand, political parties want to make electoral capital from the programme. They want the Union rural development ministry to run the pilot project in districts under their influence. 

 But the Planning Commission has already drawn up its own list of districts that have been identified on the basis of several economic and social criteria. The rural development ministry, however, does not want to go by this list. It has its own criteria for identifying the districts. 

 The new food for work programme is an integral part of the National Employment Guarantee Scheme that will come into effect after Parliament passes a bill.

 Officials in the rural development ministry said ?a lot of thinking is going on? and the ?scene is changing every day?. The ministry is consulting experts to work out the best way to implement the programme, which if successful, could raise the Congress-led government?s profile several notches. 

 But after drawing up the districts? list, the plan panel now seems to be having second thoughts on the project. 

 One opinion is that running the pilot project may become difficult as people from neighbouring districts would flock to places where the projects have started. 

 Officials in the plan panel as well as in the ministry feel it would be better to launch the programme after the Parliament passes the bill in the winter session beginning next month.

 State governments are also apprehensive that denial of 100 days? work under the employment scheme could lead to litigation trouble once employment becomes a legal right.

 Those denied work could approach courts as the bill will make it obligatory for the state governments to provide work for a minimum of 100 days to one able-bodied person in every poor and lower-middle income household.

 Experts say the project, like many other schemes, will remain on paper unless central and state governments show enough political will to ensure its benefits reached the right people.

 Tehelka probe chief contests PM claim

 Phukan

 New Delhi, Oct. 7 (PTI): Justice S.. Phukan, who headed the now disbanded commission on the Tehelka sting operation, today joined issue with Manmohan Singh over the Prime Minister?s statement that the panel ?has not been able to produce a report in three years?.

 He said the probe was at a ?very advanced? stage and would have completed its job within six months had the new government?s counsel ?cooperated?.

 ?We were at a very advanced stage in the inquiry proceedings. Unfortunately, the counsel appointed by the new government sought adjournments one after another for three months,? the retired Supreme Court judge said.

 ?If the government lawyers had fully cooperated, the report regarding allegations on the Tehelka tapes would have been complete within six months,? he added.

 ?I have been heading the commission for the last one-and-half years and not three years. In February this year, I had submitted to the Prime Minister the commission?s report on the probe into 15 defence deals that were referred to it. How can anyone say that the commission has not given any report?? he asked.

 The Prime Minister, who had made the statement at a news conference in Mumbai yesterday, appeared not to have been briefed properly by officials, he said.

 On law minister H.R. Bharadwaj?s statement that the commission did nothing but to refer the tapes to foreign forensic experts, he said: ?His statement is wrong. He may not have been taken into confidence by the government in this regard.?

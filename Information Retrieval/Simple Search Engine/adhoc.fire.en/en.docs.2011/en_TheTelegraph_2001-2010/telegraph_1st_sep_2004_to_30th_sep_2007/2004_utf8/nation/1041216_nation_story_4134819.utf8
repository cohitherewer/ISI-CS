 Seer springs torture charge

 Chennai, Dec. 15: Jayendra Saraswati told a team of MPs today that he was recently ?tortured? for three days at an all-woman police station in Kancheepuram.

 The charge was levelled when a five-member team from the National Democratic Alliance met the Kanchi seer at Vellore central prison, where he has been lodged in the Shankar Raman murder case.

 ?The swamiji has totally denied that he made any confession to the police and added that it (the police claim that he owned up in the Raman murder case) is all a lie,? said BJP?s Balbir Singh Punj, who led the team. He was accompanied by Raza Singh Rawat and Jayaben Thakkar of the BJP, Prasanna Patsani of the Biju Janata Dal and Krishnachand Khare of the Shiv Sena.

 At a news conference here on their return, Punj said the acharya also told them that the police had ?forced? him to speak to several people over the cellphone but he resisted. ??There is no question of confession, I did not do anything,? the swamiji told us,? Punj added.

 The acharya?s bail petition in the Supreme Court also said there was no ?confession? and added that even if it was so, it would not be admissible under the Indian Evidence Act. The act prohibits use of ?confessions? made before the police as they could be obtained ?under duress?.

 The apex court fixed December 17 for hearing the bail plea in the murder case after it was ?mentioned? urgently by senior counsel Fali Nariman and M.N. Krishnamani, former president of the Supreme Court Bar Association.

 As the petition seeks both an ?interim bail? and a regular bail, the former, if granted, might begin on Friday itself. Punj said the acharya told them that ?physically, I am alright, but mentally, psychologically, I feel tortured? because he was away from the Kanchi mutt and his devotees. ?Bhagwan sabko sat buddhi de (I pray that God gives wisdom to everybody),? the acharya said towards the end of the interaction in the jail, the BJP MP said.

 The NDA team also met junior pontiff Vijayendra Saraswati, students and employees in Kanchi mutt and alleged that the police had ?let loose a reign of terror?. 

 ?This is something like what happened during Emergency,? Punj said. ?We could see the people there are all terrified as the police pick up any person at any time without any record, beat them up and ask them to make statements implicating the sankaracharya.?

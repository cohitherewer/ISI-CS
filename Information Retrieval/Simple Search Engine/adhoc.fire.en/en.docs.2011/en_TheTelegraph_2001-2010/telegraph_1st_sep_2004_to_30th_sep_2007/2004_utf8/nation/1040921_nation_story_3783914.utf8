 Ibobi salvo at army chief

 Imphal, Sept. 20: Caught in the swirl of emotions building up again in Manipur, chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh today said army chief General .C. Vij?s statements on Thangjam Manorama last week smacked of ?immaturity?.

 Gen Vij had said during a visit to Srinagar that Manorama, whose death in Assam Rifles? custody triggered the crisis in Manipur, was a woman whose credentials were ?questionable?.

 He said reports about her ?underground? connections were not unfounded. ?Everyone knows that she was mixed up with the underground. There are reports available on that. Even the state chief minister is on record as having said this.?

 The army chief also said the allegation about Manorama being raped before being shot had already been proved wrong. ?It has come out clearly that there was no rape and I think this is one fact which must reach everyone.?

 Ibobi Singh accused Gen. Vij of acting irresponsibly. He said it was for the judicial commission and the army court of inquiry to find the truth. ?The army chief?s statement was quite immature. All, including the army chief, should refrain from jumping to conclusions before the findings of the army court and the C. Upendra Commission are known,? the chief minister said while speaking at a function organised to mark the first foundation day of the Editors? Forum, Manipur.

 Describing the Manorama killing as ?shocking?, the chief minister said anyone found guilty of wrongdoing would not escape punishment. 

 Ibobi Singh said Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was eager to hold talks with leaders of the Apunba Lup, which is the working committee of the 32 organisations spearheading the agitation against the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act. 

 Two student groups yesterday declared an indefinite ban on teaching Hindi and NCC training from tomorrow. A 16-day highway blockade announced by the Apunba Lup took effect at midnight.

 Ibobi Singh appealed to the All Manipur Students? Union and the Democratic Students? Alliance of Manipur, part of the group of 32, not to disrupt classes in educational institutions. ?Education should not be disturbed even during a war,? he said.

 On the highway blockade, the chief minister said supply of essential commodities and life-saving medicines and equipment, including oxygen cylinders, would stop if the strike continued. 

 All inter-state transport services came to a halt in the wee hours despite the government assuring operators of adequate security arrangements.

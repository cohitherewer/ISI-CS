 Booze brigadier raises stink

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 24: A senior army officer who was cashiered from service last fortnight for selling liquor alleged today that the former head of military intelligence and a clutch of officers were victimising him after he exposed corrupt practices.

 On December 14, the army headquarters announced that court martial proceedings against Brigadier R.P. Singh, who commanded the Delhi Brigade two years ago, had found him guilty of selling in the open market liquor procured from the service canteen.

 But the brigadier, who spoke to the press today along with his lawyer, Lt Col (retired) S.M. Dalal, showed documents he claimed were sent to the army chief, General N.C. Vij, and the then defence minister, George Fernandes, in November 2002.

 Brigadier Singh said the documents, along with visuals and audio recordings, were presented to the defence headquarters as evidence that a lieutenant general who retired as the director-general of military intelligence had abused his position to allot shops in a market complex in Delhi cantonment.

 Brigadier Singh, who has since retired, claimed that he was still drawing his army pension and displayed his identity card. 

 He alleged that the lieutenant general had made ?illegal allotments? when he was additional director-general (administration and coordination) in Delhi. 

 In his petitions to the army chief and the defence minister, the brigadier also brought charges against two senior officers who are alleged to have looked the other way. One of them is still serving as head of an army thinktank and another retired as the chief of the Western Command.

 The army spokesman declined to give an official response to the allegations. But sources in the army said the court martial had concluded that the officer, who is described as ?booze brigadier?, was guilty on seven counts, including two charges of procuring and selling liquor for ?pecuniary gain?. The sources said documents showed that the liquor quota was overdrawn to the tune of ?about Rs 4 lakh?.

 Provisions from the canteen stores department for service personnel are exempt from sales tax and are available to them at prices considerably cheaper than market rates.

 Court martial proceedings against Brigadier Singh, who was commanding an infantry brigade in New Delhi two years ago, were completed last month. On December 14, the army headquarters announced that the officer was ?cashiered? ? meaning he would not be entitled to his rank or retirement benefits ? and sentenced to nine months? rigorous imprisonment.

 Proceedings against two other officers, a major and a colonel, on similar charges are pending. Last month, the army cashiered a colonel on charges of faking encounters while on duty in Assam to claim gallantry awards.

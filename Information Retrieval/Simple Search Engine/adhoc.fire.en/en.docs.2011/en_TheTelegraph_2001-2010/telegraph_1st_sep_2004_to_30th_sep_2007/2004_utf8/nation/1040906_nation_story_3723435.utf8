 Naipaul targets terror subsidy

 London, Sept. 5 (PTI): Nobel-Prize winner V.S. Naipaul has opened a new front by accusing Saudi Arabia of financing terrorism and filling gambling dens and brothels.

 The 72-year-old author of A House for Mr Biswas and A Bend in the River condemned terrorism before squarely blaming Saudi Arabia for funding it.

 All this comes from Saudi Arabian money, he said in an interview to Tatler magazine. I dont know who we are kidding. Here is this war on terror and it is being subsidised by an ally, Naipaul added.

 It (Saudi Arabia) has contributed nothing to the world. It has just filled the gambling dens and brothels. They are not fine people, actually, the author alleged. 

 Naipaul, who was born in Trinidad to Indian parents but who now lives as a semi-recluse in Wiltshire in the UK, described multiculturalism in British society as absurd and a racket, arguing that immigrants must seek to assimilate into their host country. What do they call it? Multi-culti... its all absurd, you know. I think if a man picks himself up and comes to another country he must meet it halfway.

 He cant say, I want the country, I want the laws and the protection, but I want to live in my own way. Its wrong. Its become a kind of racket, this multiculturalism. Jobs for the boys, Naipaul said. 

 Accusing the welfare state of creating a monster, Naipaul said: Todays benefits of society, with all the handouts for children, is creating a new kind of monster. You see these children that have been littered only for the money that the benefits bring.

 The author, who went to Oxford University on a scholarship when he was 18, is of the view that a small charge for education would make pupils appreciate it more. Its time to see whether education should be free, even whether it should be compulsory. If some modest fee is charged, the price of a pint of beer per month, that might introduce the idea of education as something of virtue, instead of ramming it down the throats of people who dont want it.

 Known for his controversial statements, Naipaul called the Taliban vermin when he backed the war in Afghanistan to oust the fundamentalist regime three years ago.

 In the wake of the September 11 attacks, he argued that Islam destroyed the cultures of peoples who converted to it, comparing its calamitous effect on the world with colonialism.

 At about the same time he castigated E.M. Forster, the author of A Passage to India, and John Maynard Keynes, the economist, for their homosexual activities. 

 He has also said that he does not have time to read the works of Salman Rushdie and Arundhati Roy.

 Veerappan diary found: STF 

 Bangalore, Oct. 29 (PTI): Veerappan?s diary was seized at the scene of last week?s encounter in Dharmapuri district of Tamil Nadu, the Karnataka Special Task Force chief, Jyothi Prakash Mirji, said today.

 The diary is in the possession of Dharmapuri police who have taken over the investigation, Mirji said, adding that he has not seen the contents of the diary. 

 The task force does not have locus standi and jurisdiction and it is for Dharmapuri police to pursue the case, the STF official said.

 The diary has generated a lot of interest as many believe Veerappan?s death has left several questions unanswered, particularly those related to allegations of political patronage to the bandit and his kidnap dramas. 

 It could also throw some light on the abductions, murders and poaching the 52-year-old sandalwood smuggler had carried out in more than three decades.

 Amte lobs fast threat

 Nagpur, Dec. 12 (PTI): Baba Amte has threatened to go on a fast-unto-death, alleging ?step-motherly? treatment to his Anandvan Ashram, a shelter for leprosy patients in Chandrapur district.

 Complaining that a Rs 84.42-lakh grant for two years has not been released by the Maharashtra government, the social worker said: ?If this continues, I will resort to fast-unto-death and exercise my right to kill myself after December 26 when I turn 90.?

 ?As the grant has not been released, thousands of inmates are in distress,? he told state deputy chief minister R.R. Patil and public health minister Vimal Mundada yesterday during their visit to the ashram to attend a function.

 The Magsaysay award winner asked Patil: ?I have taken the responsibility of feeding over 4,500 inmates here and how do I shoulder it unless the required amount is there??

 Court shield for harassed couple 

 New Delhi, Dec. 7 (PTI): The Supreme Court today ordered police protection for a couple who defied a panchayat diktat and community barriers to tie the knot.

 The story of the couple, from Badshahpur village in Gurgaon, could well be the script for a Bollywood blockbuster.

 The couple, belonging to different communities, fled to Muzaffarnagar and married in a temple on July 21. They also applied for registration of their marriage. 

 The girl?s parents learnt that she was staying in Muzaffarnagar. They took her away and got her married to another man. 

 But she escaped from her second husband?s house and went back to her first husband.

 When both of them were going to register their marriage in Muzaffarnagar, the police detained them and handed the girl over to her family, warning the couple not to go against the wishes of the panchayat and the parents.

 She escaped yet again, but this time without going to Muzaffarnagar, headed straight for the Supreme Court with her first husband seeking protection to lead a peaceful married life. 

 A bench of Justices N. Santosh Hegde, B.P. Singh and S.B. Sinha today directed Haryana police to provide adequate protection to the couple whenever they feel that there is danger to their lives.

 Seer?s bail knock in SC

 R. VENKATARAMAN 

 New Delhi, Dec. 14: A lawyer asserting authorisation by the Kanchi seer moved the Supreme Court for bail for Jayendra Saraswati on a day it threw out two public interest petitions seeking relief for the acharya. 

 Advocate R. Krishna Kumar filed for bail along with a vakalatnama (authorisation) bearing the seer?s thumb impression, saying it was the ?one and only? petition ?authorised? by the ?swamiji?. 

 A couple of hours ago, the court rejected the two petitions moved by lawyers D.B. Vohra and Sampat Kumar on the ground that the ?aggrieved party? ? the seer ? did not approach the court and others had no locus standi in the matter. 

 While one petition sought the seer?s release on bail, the other wanted the probe into the Sankar Raman murder case, in which the seer was arrested over a month ago, to be transferred to an independent agency like the CBI. 

 About three to four such petitions have been filed in the court. The first, moved by BJP parliamentarian B.P. Singhal, was dismissed last month. 

 Krishna Kumar filed for regular bail against the Madras High Court order denying the acharya bail on the ground that there was ?prima facie? a case against him. 

 In the petition, the seer said the high court did not go into the basis of the allegations made by Tamil Nadu police and erroneously refused him bail.

 Dharam woos IT firms

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bangalore, Oct. 14: Karnataka chief minister Dharam Singh today pacified CEOs of information technology companies by promising a thorough discussion on October 18 on infrastructure.

 The Electronics City Industries? Association responded by calling off a protest planned for tomorrow. A clutch of companies that had planned to boycott IT.COM from November 1-5, too, changed its stand and agreed to participate in the flagship event after Singh promised to hold the meeting ? the second in four months on problems faced by IT companies.

 The state IT secretary, Shankaralinge Gowda, spoke at a breakfast meeting of the chief minister?s assurance to the CEOs of 50 IT firms.

 The chief minister?s principal secretary, S.V. Ranganath, also convened a meeting with the Electronics City body to convey Singh?s promise. The body also received a letter from the chief minister?s secretariat that Singh would address a meeting on October 18 on decongesting traffic on Hosur Road, said its president, H. Prakash Rao.

 ?We are sensitive to the issues raised by the IT industry and share its concerns about retaining the global brand equity of Bangalore as the premier destination for offshoring and outsourcing. Chief minister Dharam Singh has called another meeting with the IT industry on October 18 for spelling out measures being taken by the government to decongest Bangalore, regulate its chaotic traffic and facilitate the growth of the IT industry,? Gowda said.

 ?We hope the chief minister takes immediate measures to improve the traffic conditions on Hosur Road,? said Rao.

 About 250 firms have confirmed their participation in the seventh edition of IT.COM, said the director of Software Technology Parks of India, B.V. Naidu.

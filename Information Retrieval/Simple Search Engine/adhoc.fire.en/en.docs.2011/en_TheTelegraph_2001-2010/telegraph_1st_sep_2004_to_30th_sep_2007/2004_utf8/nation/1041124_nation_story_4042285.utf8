 SC sets Thursday date for PIL

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 23: The Supreme Court today fixed Thursday for hearing a public interest litigation seeking the release of Kanchi seer Jayendra Saraswati and a directive for a CBI inquiry into the Shankar Raman murder case.

 A bench presided by the Chief Justice of India, R.C. Lahoti, fixed November 25 for the hearing after the counsel for petitioner B.P. Singhal, a former BJP Rajya Sabha member and brother of VHP leader Ashok Singhal, made an urgent mention for the hearing of the petition. The counsel said the petition contained ?important questions? relating to the arrest and proof of ?bias? of the Tamil Nadu police.

 The petition accused the state police of implicating the seer in the murder case and sought transfer of the case to another state, while seeking a thorough probe by the CBI. The petition was ?mentioned? before the bench in the morning and was decided to be taken up during the post-lunch session of the court.

 The petitioner?s counsel argued that the arrest violated the guidelines laid down by the Supreme Court and contended that the Tamil Nadu government had thrown to the winds all such norms. The petitioner was not arguing the case for the acharya but only bringing to the court?s notice the violation of guidelines regarding arrest and human rights, the counsel said.

 At this, the chief justice said the PIL would be heard ?straight away? on Thursday.

 Arjun buries Rao hatchet

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 13: Human resources development minister Arjun Singh, veteran of many a political battle within the Congress, today sought to bring down the curtains on one of his most bitter intra-party feuds by visiting P.V. Narasimha Rao.

 The former Prime Minister, who has made steady progress since he was admitted to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences here on Thursday, is bound to remember his VIP caller. This is the first face-to-face interaction between the former cabinet colleagues since Singh quit the Rao government, marking a revolt against the latter?s leadership, on Christmas eve in 1994.

 Many Congress leaders, including Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and party chief Sonia Gandhi, have enquired about Rao?s health from time to time and even visited him occasionally at his Motilal Nehru residence. He has been ailing for some time.

 Manmohan Singh and Sonia dropped in to meet Rao, 83, after he was admitted to the hospital complaining of breathlessness. He suffered a heart attack soon afterwards but his condition has improved substantially. The former Prime Minister even opened his eyes today.

 Rao is unlikely to remember who visited him when he was in a critical condition last week, but today he even spoke to Arjun Singh. 

 The HRD minister said that he wished Rao a speedy recovery. The former Prime Minister told him they would meet when he recovers fully.

 Arjun Singh said Rao told him he was feeling much better. ?I am alright. I have been feeling much better than before,? he quoted Rao as saying.

 Former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda, who called on Rao today, confirmed that the veteran had spoken to his visitors. 

 Deve Gowda said Rao spoke to him for nearly 10 minutes. ?He remembers everything. He asked me to continue my fighting style of politics,? Deve Gowda said.

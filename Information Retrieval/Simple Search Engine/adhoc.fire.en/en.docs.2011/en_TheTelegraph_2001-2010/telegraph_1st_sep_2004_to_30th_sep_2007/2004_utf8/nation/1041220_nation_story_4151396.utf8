 Babri cases back under spotlight

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Dec. 19: CBI counsel P.K. Chaubey last week told the Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court that L.K. Advani had prior knowledge that the Babri Masjid was going to be demolished.

 The counsel, who had said the BJP chief?s ?complicity? in the demolition was on a par with the other accused, felt that lawyers representing Advani were trying to delay the hearing further.

 The court is hearing a CBI petition challenging the special Rae Bareli court order discharging Advani and issuing summons against other accused. The accused include Murli Manohar Joshi, Uma Bharti, Vinay Katiyar, Ashok Singhal, Giriraj Kishore, Vishnu Hari Dalmiya and Sadhvi Ritambhara.

 The Vajpayee government had placed criminal and civil cases relating to the demolition on the backburner, but the change of guard at the Centre has shifted them back into the spotlight.

 Union law minister H.R. Bhardwaj recently said: ?Slowest motion of justice had relegated the course of justice to the background. After the UPA (United Progressive Alliance) government took over (last May), our effort on Ayodhya cases was to ensure the free and fair trial of the cases.?

 Legal conundrums, revision pleas, applications for quashing charges and writ petitions have ensured that the cases have barely moved in the 12 years since the December 6, 1992, demolition.

 That may be about to change with CBI counsel Chaubey substantiating his charge of complicity against Advani by reading out in court the statement of Anju Gupta, the then additional superintendent of police (Faizabad), who was escorting the BJP chief on the day of the demolition.

 Gupta said in a recorded statement that Advani asked her what was happening inside the disputed structure at 10.45 am that day as the crowd went berserk and stormed the mosque. 

 Chaubey sought to show that the BJP chief did not attempt to restrain the crowd; instead he had a closed-door meeting with the district magistrate and the superintendent of police as jubilant kar sevaks distributed sweets.

 ?The very fact that the three pillars of the mosque collapsed at three different point of time shows it was a calculated insider?s job and L.K. Advani was as much a part of provocation as Uma Bharti and Ritambhara,? he said.

 Justice Y.R. Tripathi has posted the matter for further hearing on Tuesday.

 Earlier, opposing the CBI petition, Advani?s lawyers had argued that there was no substance in the evidence the bureau had produced to show the BJP leader?s complicity.

 As the court No. 22 was abuzz with arguments and counter-arguments, Court No. 17 is set to be in session soon for hearing on the Archaeological Survey of India excavation of the disputed site while the Rae Bareli trial court will have more mosque case-related hearings than before.

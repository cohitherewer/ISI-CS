 Goa fuel leak fear recedes

Panaji: Goa?s fire-fighting force on Saturday said danger 

has receded from a kerosene leak in the port town of Vasco da Gama a day after 

the seepage into the sea alarmed fishermen, reports our correspondent.

 ?We do not know the exact amount of the leakage, but the threat has discharged,? fire force director P.K. John said here about the site of the leak about 30 km away. Vasco and Mormugao Port Trust fire officials took part in the operation.

 Late on Friday night, reports had said a large amount of petroleum had spilled into the sea at Kharewaddo jetty.

 John said the fuel had probably come from a ship discharging kerosene, but it could have also come from a drain or a local petrol pump pipe.

 ?The film of oil on the water has completely gone. Earlier, there was some accumulation (on the surface),? John said. He added that there were no reports of fish dying.

 Oil majors such as Indian Oil Corporation, Hindustan Petroleum and Bharat Petroleum have tank farms in the locality. Vasco, Goa?s largest urban conglomeration with a population of around 100,000, is also home to the harbour, airport, and has a chemical facility nearby.

 There was widespread panic in the area two years ago after petroleum pilferage led to a major leak. Local operations at the multi-cargo port have also led to chronic dust pollution.

 Polls delay meal mantra

Jaipur (PTI): The Rajasthan government postponed the implementation 

of the bhojan mantra ? a vedic hymn recited before meals ? in state-run 

hostels for Schedule Caste and Schedule Tribe students within a few hours of having 

decided to enforce it on Saturday.

 enying that the decision was taken under ?pressure? as objections had been pouring in from several quarters, social welfare minister Madan Dilawar said: ?We have postponed the implementation of the directive on the bhojan mantra in view of the election code of conduct as Assembly byelections are under way in Merta and Behrod constituencies.? 

 Earlier, at least 21,800 students in 527 hostels across the state began chanting the mantra from Saturday as directed by the ministry. Several hostel administrators, however, reported that they were yet to receive orders about the postponement of the earlier decision.

 Friends kill boy over affair

Muzaffarnagar (PTI): A 15-year-old schoolboy, Sunil Kumar, 

was strangled to death by three friends, allegedly over a love affair, police 

said on Saturday.

 Vipin (10), Dharambir (15) and Om (16) reportedly killed Sunil because they were jealous of his affair with a girl from his class.

 Gandhi ashram

 Wardha (Maharashtra) (PTI): The Sewagram Ashram, once an 

abode of Mahatma Gandhi, is now in a shambles because of lack of resources. According 

to the director of the ashram, Kanaklal Gandhi, no admission fees are collected 

nor do people donate much, leading to the resource crunch.

 Pillar saves man

Ahmedabad (PTI): A youth, who slipped from the railing of 

a bridge on the Sabarmati river, had a miraculous escape after he clung to one 

of its pillars all night, fire brigade sources said on Saturday. Israj Parmar 

said he was sitting on the railing of the Subhash Bridge on Friday night when 

he suddenly felt giddy and fell into the river. He fell close to a pillar and 

clung on to it all night till some people working nearby heard his cries and called 

the fire brigade.

 Valley killing

board, was gunned down in the Hard-e-Kichloo forest region in Ashmuqam, 70 km 

from here.

 Minor bar girls

Mumbai (PTI): Four minor girls working in a dance bar in 

south Mumbai and nine employees were detained after a raid conducted on the bar 

premises by Mumbai police. The raid was conducted following a tip-off that the

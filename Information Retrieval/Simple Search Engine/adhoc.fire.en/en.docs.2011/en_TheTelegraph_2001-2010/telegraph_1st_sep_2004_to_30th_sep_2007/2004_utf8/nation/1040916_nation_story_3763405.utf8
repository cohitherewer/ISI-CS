 Reddy, Aziz Ahmad Khan: Trade ties 

 New Delhi, Sept. 15: The Andhra Pradesh chief minister wants to go where no Indian foreign minister has gone before: on mission Islamabad investment.

 Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy wants Pakistan to keep aside Kashmir and make Andhra the destination of its first foreign direct investment in India.

 Mission impossible? Reddy has no reason to be pessimistic at the outset. Pakistan high commissioner Aziz Ahmad Khan was among 30-odd top diplomats who attended a presentation by the chief minister at a five-star hotel here today.

 Reddy?s objective: ?We will showcase Andhra as the ideal investment destination to the ambassadors and top diplomats. We are a progressive, reform-oriented state.?

 Out on the ambitious mission to bring investment from a country that has put Kashmir ahead of normal trade ties with India, Reddy appeared to have sought the blessings of the Holy See. The Vatican?s diplomatic representative, Archbishop Pedro Lopez Quintana, was among the invitees.

 Khan could not have been worried about his participation?s fallout back home because there was nothing official about the event. ?It is a personal initiative by the adviser to the Andhra Pradesh government, Peter Hassan,? Reddy explained.

 The chief minister had a more pressing message to convey on his government?s oft-stated agrarian focus, which was one of the main reasons for his date with diplomats.

 ?We want to make it absolutely clear through this meeting that we are only correcting anomalies by giving the correct focus on agriculture. Our focus on industry and high-tech areas remains undiminished,? Reddy said, trying to reassure western countries that had promised investment during predecessor . Chandrababu Naidu?s regime.

 The US envoys, a regular presence at similar meets organised in the past by Naidu, were conspicuous by their absence. But the UK, Australia, Canada, Italy, Singapore and Saudi Arabia were represented.

 Reddy took the opportunity to clarify his four-month-old government?s decision to give free power to farmers. The state, he said, supplies power to agro and food processing establishments at the rate of Rs 1.70, the cheapest in the country.

 More is in the pipeline. The chief minister told potential foreign investors that Andhra would soon have the distinction of providing industrial establishments with the cheapest power in the country ? without ruining the power sector. The state would have surplus power by 2008, Reddy said.

 But the informal investment meet had a veiled warning for farmers. ?I have a mandate to provide free power during my five-year term. If the situation improves, we will reconsider the decision.?

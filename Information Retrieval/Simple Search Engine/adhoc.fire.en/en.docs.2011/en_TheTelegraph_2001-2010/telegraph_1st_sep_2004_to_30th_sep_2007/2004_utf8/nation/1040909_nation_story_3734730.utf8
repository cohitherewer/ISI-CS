 Rebel shadow on seat share

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 8: With the fear of a rebel backlash hanging over the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party, senior leaders of both sides are moving ahead with caution on clinching a seat-sharing agreement for the Maharashtra elections.

 Congress leaders involved in talks with the NCP in Mumbai dropped enough hints today that the reported delay in arriving at an understanding was more due to a shared concern in both camps about the threat of ticket aspirants turning rebel candidates than any serious difficulty on the negotiating table.

 ?It is better to exercise caution about seat sharing than rush with an announcement about it and invite the rebel problem,? they said. While both parties are concerned about the threat of rebels, the problem is said to be much more serious for the Congress.

 For the first time, the party, which has a strong presence in almost all the state?s 288 Assembly seats, is confronting a situation in which it is unlikely to be able to field nominees in more than 150-160 seats. The remaining seats would have to be left for the allies, mainly the NCP.

 ?Before we finalise the seat-sharing deal, as far as possible, we are also trying avoid the rebel threats in the seats we are likely to leave to our allies,? a source said.

 Party leaders said the NCP leadership was fully aware of the Congress? concerns as it was also confronted with a similar problem.

 To pacify its restive rank and file, the Congress is understood to be asking its ally to concede more seats in the NCP?s western Maharashtra stronghold that accounts for 62 constituencies. On the other hand, NCP leaders are said to be asking the Congress for a better share of the 34 seats in Mumbai, a Congress stronghold.

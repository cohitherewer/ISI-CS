 Land scam jolt to TN

 M.R. VENKATESH

 Chennai, Dec. 17: The Tamil Nadu government, which had hit the headlines recently over the killing of forest brigand Veerappan and the arrest of Kanchi seer Jayendra Saraswati, has now stumbled on to a land compensation scam that could run into crores.

 An operation carried out in recent weeks has pointed at the collusion of officials of a Dharmapuri court with landowners in recommending to the government highly inflated amounts as ?additional compensation? for land acquired for welfare schemes.

 The loss to the exchequer in Dharmapuri could be as much as Rs 50 crore, with more such cases being investigated in the district, sources said.

 ?If such is the extent of the scam in one backward district, one shudders to think of the crores that could possibly be involved in similar scandals in developed districts,? a source said.

 The Dharmapuri case dates back to 1997, when 0.8 hectare in Pennagaram village was acquired for implementation of welfare schemes for Adi Davidars.

 The compensation to be paid to the landowners was fixed at a total of Rs 45,000, the sources said. This worked out to about 55 paise for every square foot as 0.8 hectare is roughly equivalent to 87,000 square feet.

 The landowners had subsequently moved the sub-court in Dharmapuri seeking an additional compensation of Rs 60 per square foot, sources said. This would have led to the Tamil Nadu government paying as compensation, besides the Rs 45,000, about Rs 52 lakh ? taking the total compensation to about Rs 53 lakh.

 The affidavit by the landowners was then sent to the land acquisition tehsildar in Dharmapuri.

 Then came the windfall. On November 3 this year, the sub-court ordered the government to pay an enhanced compensation of Rs 108 per square foot ? Rs 48 more per square foot than what the landowners themselves had demanded. At this rate, the additional compensation alone would be nearly Rs 1 crore.

 It was then discovered by senior officials of the district administration that ?some manipulation has taken place in the records in the court?, a source in Chennai said on condition of anonymity.

 The Rs 60 per square foot sought as additional compensation by the landowners had been changed to Rs 160 per square foot in court records, sources said. 

 When the final order was passed by the sub-court, the recommended additional compensation was placed relatively lower at Rs 108 per square foot, they said.

 The Dharmapuri district collector is learnt to have sent a detailed report to the state government last week. Home secretary Sheela Rani Chunkath is also understood to have briefed chief minister Jayalalithaa.

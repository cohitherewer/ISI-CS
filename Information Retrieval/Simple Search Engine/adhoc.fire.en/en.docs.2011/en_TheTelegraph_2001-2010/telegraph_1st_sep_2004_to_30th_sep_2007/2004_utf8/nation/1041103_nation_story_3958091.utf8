 PM pep talk for babus

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 2: Think big and think innovatively ? that was the thrust of Manmohan Singh?s address to chief secretaries of states and Union territories today. 

 Last month, in a similar meeting, the Prime Minister had thrown open his doors for a pep talk with Union government secretaries. 

 At today?s meeting, Singh said he intended to seek ?basic structural improvements? in the way his government worked and set a two-year timeframe to accomplish it. 

 The underpinning of the structure, he said, was evolving a ?national perspective? while dealing with local problems. Singh asked the officials to travel to villages for a better understanding of ground realities and to ?learn from facts?.

 The meeting follows Singh?s first interactive session with his council of ministers yesterday, in which he underlined the importance of involving the ?best and the brightest? from within and outside the government in administration.

 Today, he urged the chief secretaries to provide the kind of leadership that would restore the ?elan? of the civil services and strengthen and modernise the country?s administrative ?steel frame?. 

 In a press release issued by the Prime Minister?s media adviser, the chief secretaries were advised to improve the quality of ?development administration? at the state and district levels. 

 Singh stressed that the thrust areas were agriculture, irrigation and drinking water, infrastructure, education, health and urban renewal. He asked the bureaucrats to come up with innovative ways to deliver ?better quality services? which would be ?transparent, honest and caring?.

 The second theme that Singh touched upon was the importance of the civil services in ensuring the unity and integrity of the country and the supremacy of the rule of law. The release said Singh referred to internal security threats being faced by the country and urged the chief secretaries to ?uphold the best principles of a professional civil service, working without fear or favour?.

 The Prime Minister also spoke of the need for ?increased professional disaster management?, whether in natural calamities or civil conflicts, and improvement of fiscal management in states.

 ?Messiah? Laloo in big show

 Patna, Dec. 10: The double advantage of having a government in the state and the railway ministry in Delhi has helped the Rashtriya Janata Dal launch a blitzkrieg of sops in poll-bound Bihar.

 The state?s most famous couple today laid the foundation of three rail-related factories, a broad-gauge line, double-laning of the track between Chhapra and Ekma, besides inaugurating the survey of a new track and two computerised reservation counters.

 But that is only part of the story. For, Laloo Prasad Yadav?s party is leaving nothing to chance also when it comes to organising its biggest pre-election show at Gandhi Maidan here on December 23.

 That the Ram Vilas Paswan-Laloo Prasad spat that rocked Parliament began from the same venue last month has not deterred the RJD leaders from going all out to make the Kisan Mazdoor Maha Raila the ?largest human congregation at the historic venue this year?.

 ?All major parties, including the BJP and the Lok Janshakti Party, have already held their Gandhi Maidan rallies. We are fortunate that they have set a standard of attendance that is easy for us to beat. We are also lucky to have got the longest gap before any other mega political show is scheduled in the state,? an RJD leader close to Gopalganj MP Sadhu Yadav said. The last show at the venue was the BJP?s rally on December 2.

 Sadhu Yadav is directly in charge of chalking out the details of the rally while Laloo Prasad is the overall supervisor. The show has been called a raila ? a word contributed to the Hindi lexicon by the RJD chief himself ? just to stress that every other meeting is insignificant.

 Although the rally is still 12 days away, the roads of the capital already wear the RJD?s deep green hue. The city?s skyline is no different with scores of tall hoardings informing the people of the mega event. These billboards, till the other day, used to advertise big brands, including the sole international bank the city has.

 ?Almost all the hoardings are in place. Now, the focus is on painting walls along all major roads with the RJD?s message. We have to finish everything a week before the rally,? said a painter, who was busy writing ?Garibon ke devta Laloo-Rabri zindabad? on a wall along a busy street today. ?I don?t have any preferences. Since I have to make a living, I just do the writing for any party that asks me to,? he added.

 ?One rally by the CPI-ML was perhaps bigger. But their workers do not arrive in the same numbers any longer as was clear from their rally last month. Paswan?s last rally was impressive but I am sure the attendance at the RJD raila will be the highest,? said a trader who has his shop near Gandhi Maidan.

 Congress eyes election boost

 KAY BENEDICT

 New Delhi, Oct. 10: Congress workers are calling it ?the biggest democratic process in the world?.

 The mother of all elections is what the party is gearing up for ? its own organisational polls.

 The elections involve about 12,000 blocks, 500 districts and 200,000 panchayats. They will encompass party committees from the booth, ward, panchayat, block, district and state levels to the AICC and finally the president?s post.

 The poll calendar starts from November 15 and runs on till April 30, 2005. Subsequently, a new party president will be elected.

 However, first comes the enrolment drive that will throw up new members who will then participate in the electoral process. Congress chief Sonia Gandhi has called all state presidents and senior Congress leaders here on October 19 to discuss ways to boost membership.

 Party spokesperson Jayanti Natarajan said there has been a huge demand for membership, which she hopes will boost the Congress mass base in the next four months.

 Congress sources said the enrolment drive was receiving ?tremendous response? even in heartland states such as Uttar Pradesh and Bihar where the party is weak.

 A further boost will be the subsequent organisational polls, which insiders said will revamp the rusted party apparatus from the grassroots on, weeding out outdated veterans and packing in babalog ? roughly 35 crore of the country?s population is between 18 and 40 years old.

 Women and weaker sections, too, would find representation, they said. Natarajan said Sonia has already expressed her desire to give special attention to women, youth and weaker sections.

 With more youths entering Parliament, the Congress motto is ?catch them young? and from the village level.

 The party will undergo a drastic image makeover after the organisational polls, Congress secretary Ranji Thomas said.

 District presidents who have been clinging to their posts for 20 to 25 years have to be shown the door to inject new blood, he added. Today, Sonia represents not only youth and the women, but she also has empathy for the weaker sections, Thomas said.

 The party has become moribund in many states because of neglect of the organisation at the grassroots.

 The rot set in after the death of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. His successor as Congress chief, P.V. Narasimha Rao, could give little attention to the party as he was more involved in his duties as Prime Minister.

 The organisation thus became non-functional below the district level. Sitaram Kesri, who succeeded Rao, tried to revive it but was plagued by intra-party power struggles.

 After taking over, Sonia has started the process of grassroots empowerment and decentralisation.

 She set up an independent authority called the Congress Central Election Authority (CCEA), on the lines of the country?s Election Commission, in 2000 under the chairmanship of Ram Niwas Mirdha.

 In keeping with the times, octogenarian Mirdha was replaced by a younger Oscar Fernandes about a couple of months ago. He will be assisted by three party veterans.

 The CCEA has evolved a mechanism to solve disputes and problems at the local level through setting up its branches at district and state levels. The central leadership will intervene only when necessary.

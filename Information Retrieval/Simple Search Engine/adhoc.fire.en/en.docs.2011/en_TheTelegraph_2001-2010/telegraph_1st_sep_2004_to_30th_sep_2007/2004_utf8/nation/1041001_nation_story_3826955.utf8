 Indians to join China bash

 UMANAND JAISWAL

 Tawang, Sept. 30: Chilly winds are blowing over the arid Himalayan wastes on the Sino-Indian border ? but this time they bear a message of warmth and bonhomie from the People?s Liberation Army.

 The enthusiasm is clear and visible among Indian Army jawans posted at Bumla Hut on the eve of the Chinese National Day celebrations tomorrow. It is a two-hour uphill drive over rugged terrain from this Arunachal Pradesh town, in which Asia?s largest monastery nestles like a bright jewel. 

 Led by Brig. Vikram Raghavan of the 5 Mountain Division, a team of soldiers, mediapersons and officials and their relatives would cross over to the Chinese side to participate in the celebrations. Weather permitting, of course. 

 The visit is a reciprocal one. A 60-strong Chinese army contingent, including soldiers and their families, had similarly crossed over to the Indian side to participate in the 58th Independence Day celebrations, 100 metres inside the Line of Control. 

 A five-member media team will participate in the celebrations for the first time.

 The Chinese army?s invitation to the media is seen here by most as ?significant?, given the neighbouring country?s ties with the media, which at most times remain tenuous. 

 The invitation also shows how much water has flown down the Brahmaputra since China?s soldiers bulldozed their way through this sector during the 1962 invasion and subsequent border skirmishes. 

 Maj. Gen. M.K.V. Panicker, general officer commanding of the division, summed up everyone?s eagerness during an introductory briefing at Tenga. 

 ?Tomorrow?s visit is nothing short of historic. It is part of ongoing special border personnel meetings between the two sides, which I?m sure would play a significant role towards further improving bilateral ties. Elaborate arrangements have been made on both sides,? he said. He was quick to point out that this is the first time that the Indian media has been invited to the Chinese side to participate in the celebrations. 

 Reflecting the upbeat mood, Gen. Panicker diplomatically skirted all contentious issues. These include the knotty question of territorial control and the controversy over railway tracks, which have been laid too close to the Indian border by China through Tibet. 

 ?As far as things stand today, everything is quiet on my front,? he said.

 Focus on IT for Putin meet

 New Delhi, Nov. 18: Cooperation in the field of energy, space and information technology is likely to be the highlight of Russian President Vladimir Putin?s visit to India early next month for the summit with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.

 Putin is scheduled to be in India on December 3 and 4. While he will spend the first day in Delhi discussing with Indian leaders issues of bilateral, regional and international importance, he plans to visit Bangalore the next day.

 A joint declaration at the end of the summit is likely to be issued, highlighting the new areas of cooperation and challenges before the strategic partnership. Russian deputy Prime Minister Alexander Zhukov held discussions with foreign minister K. Natwar Singh today to prepare the ground for Putin?s visit.

 Although the ostensible reason for Zhukov?s presence here was to participate in the Indo-Russian joint commission meeting, he also took the opportunity to tighten some of the loose ends for the visit.

 Sources said there may be an agreement on the Sakhalin III oilfield in Russia where India has shown keenness to explore. The two might also discuss steps to cooperate in the field of civilian nuclear energy and civilian space technology.

 But it is in information technology that Russia has shown an interest to work closely with India. CEOs of leading Russian IT companies will reach Bangalore before Putin?s visit to hold discussions with Indian IT giants.

 Touch the sky on a Christmas cable car

 - J amp;K plans highest ride

 A cable car in Gulmarg

 Gulmarg Dec. 11: This Christmas, the snowy slopes of Gulmarg will have a gift for its tourists ? a sky-car ride across 5 km and reaching an altitude of 13,500 ft, the highest in the world.

 A French firm named PomaGlaski had begun the ambitious sky-car project in the meadowy resort but abandoned it midway after violence escalated in Kashmir with heavy cross-border shelling. 

 ?The sky-car project is in the direct shelling range of Pakistan artillery positions across the Line of Control beyond the Afarwat hills, the final destination of the car ride,? said an official of the project.

 But a year?s ceasefire between India and Pakistan has borne fruit. The French engineers are back and the project is now nearing completion. 

 ?We shall be completing the cable work up to Afarwat by December 24. The chief minister will formally inaugurate the project on December 25, coinciding with Christmas,? said Farooq Ahmad Shah, the director of the project. 

 The cable car ride in Gulmarg now ends at the Kongdoori plateau, but the project aims to stretch it to the Afarwat hills. 

 The sky-car will wind its way through the dense pine forests, which are covered in deep snow in winter and are carpets of scented medicinal flowers during summer.

 The snowy Gulmarg slopes are a skier?s paradise. Some of the world?s best ski slopes are located here and the facilities available to professional and amateur skiers are comparable to some of the best known ski resorts in the world, like the French Alps. 

 Shah has been personally supervising the completion of the project, spending days at the site in sub-zero temperatures.

 The project seems to have already been blessed by nature. Gulmarg has had heavy snowfall recently and once the sky-car project reaches Afarwat, the slopes from there would be the world?s highest and longest ski slopes.

 ?If peace persists along the LoC, the sky-car could be a major attraction for thousands of tourists and adventure-loving, hardy souls who throng Gulmarg from both domestic and international sectors for skiing, holidaying, golf or simply a sojourn in the alpine woods,? said Shah.

 Strike pangs for poll panel

 K.C. PHILIP

 Patna, Dec. 27: Laloo Prasad Yadav?s Rashtriya Janata Dal gave in to pressure exerted by the Election Commission but employees of the Rabri Devi government are in no mood to relent and end their indefinite strike to help the poll panel conduct the Assembly election smoothly.

 Over 3 lakh non-gazetted employees of the state decided to intensify the strike on its 18th day today if the government failed to make a ?respectable? settlement with them.

 Three days ago, state chief electoral officer K.C. Saha appealed to the striking organisations to call off the agitation in the light of the Assembly election. Later, some groups met the officer but refused to end the strike due to the government?s alleged ?arrogant and indifferent? stand.

 The joint struggle committee of the associations met yesterday and decided to intensify the agitation. Accordingly, the employees would take out torchlight processions and bicycle rallies and hold street plays across the state in the coming days.

 ?Going by the last Lok Sabha election, Bihar will require about 2 lakh employees to man its 49,633 booths. Of this, nearly 1.5 lakh employees belong to the non-gazetted category and are on strike,? a state electoral officer said.

 Every booth would require an officer and three assistants, who are generally Grade-3 employees or teachers. The Bihar State Primary Teachers? Association too has supported the strike.

 The agitation is unlikely to end in the near future considering the history of earlier strikes. ?In the past 14 years of RJD rule, the government never took any initiative for an amicable and just settlement of the issues,? said Manjul Kumar Das, general secretary of the Bihar Rajya Arajpatrit Karmachari Mahasangh. 

 Most employees apprehend that the government would try to outmanoeuvre them on the pretext of the model code of conduct.

 ?The government had agreed as back as 1999 to implement our demands. We are asking for nothing new,? said Suresh Prasad Singh, vice-president of the Mahasangh.

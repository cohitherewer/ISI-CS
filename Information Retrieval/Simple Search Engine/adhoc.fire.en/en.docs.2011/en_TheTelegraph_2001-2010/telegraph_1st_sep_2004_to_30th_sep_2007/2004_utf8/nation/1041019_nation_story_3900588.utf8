 Meera does an Amisha

 JOHN MARY

 Meera Jasmine

 Thriuvananthapuram, Oct. 18: 

 After Amisha Patel, it was National Award-winning actor 

 Meera Jasmine?s turn to walk out on her family, accusing 

 them of robbing her of all her earnings.

 Meera?s father Joseph Philip today countered the allegation, saying his ?dumb? daughter is being exploited by her 58-year-old ?mentor and director? Lohitadas, an acclaimed filmmaker in Kerala.

 Philip flaunted copies of assets in Meera?s name to disprove the charge. ?This so-called guru was fleecing her for long. He owes her Rs 12 lakh but collects money from her every month. I?m keeping the documents of her properties to prevent him from cheating her.?

 Reports said Meera left home a few weeks ago. Lohitadas, who had introduced her to films, reportedly offered her shelter. However, Meera denied it, saying her sisters were spreading rumours to tarnish her image.

 Deputy inspector-general of police R. Srilekha said the actor was distraught when she came on Saturday to lodge a complaint. ?The girl who has lived under arc lights shuddered at the sight of photographers outside my office,? Srilekha said. ?She was distressed... a pale shadow of herself.? 

 The next day, Meera broke down while addressing a film festival and begged the audience to support and pray for her. Chief minister Oommen Chandy, who was on the dais, consoled her and promised to do his bit.

 Meera debuted in Soothradharan in 2001. She soon had several hits in Malayalam, Tamil, Telugu and Kannada films and went on to bag many awards.

 Meera said her family had bought a 50-bed hospital in Kozhikode and a luxury flat in Kochi with her money. ?They have left me. I don?t have my papa, mom and my sisters now. I?m all alone.?

 Rubbishing reports that Meera has been staying with him, Lohitadas said she is like a daughter to him. He added that he had nothing to do with Meera?s complaint against her family.

 The actor?s parents said they wanted their daughter not to be misguided by her ?guru?. They also want her to stop working and get married. Meera got the National Award for best actress for Paadham Onnu-Oru Vilapam, a Malayalam film directed by T.V. Chandran.

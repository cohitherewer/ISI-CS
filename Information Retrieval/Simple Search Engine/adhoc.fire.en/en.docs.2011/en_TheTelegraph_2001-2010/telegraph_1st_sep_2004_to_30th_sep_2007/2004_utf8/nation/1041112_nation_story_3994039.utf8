 Delhi calms restive NSCN

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Nov. 11: The government is ?sincere and serious? about negotiating a peaceful settlement with the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isak-Muivah), highly-placed sources said here today.

 ?We want to settle the Naga issue and not prolong it. This is what prompted the invitation to the NSCN (I-M) leaders to visit India and engage in sustained negotiations for peace. We hope that they will stop having any second thoughts about their visit to India expected at the end of this month,? the sources said.

 The government would not like the NSCN (I-M) leaders to have any doubt at all in their mind about the Centre?s intention to resolve the Naga issue permanently, they said. 

 They were reacting to the claims of Thuingaleng Muivah, general secretary of the NSCN (I-M), that Delhi was following a ?wicked? policy of promoting ?discredited? organisations like the Naga National Council (NNC) and the NSCN (Khaplang) to disrupt the impending negotiations. Muivah had claimed that the peace efforts were being disturbed by India by arming the NNC and ?facilitating? the NSCN (K) to undermine the efforts of the NSCN (I-M) to reach a mutually satisfactory peace settlement with India.

 ?We recognise that if the Naga issue is settled, then it would become easier for us to deal with the other insurgencies in the Northeast. Once we come to an agreement with the Nagas, others can also be encouraged to come to the path of peaceful negotiations,? the sources said.

 They also claimed that the central government was in no way involved in creating any armed group in Nagaland ? it did not make any sense for it to do so. 

 The sources clarified that there was also no question of the government encouraging any activity by the NSCN (K) to disturb the impending peace negotiations or ?sponsoring? any of its leaders to hold press briefings in Delhi to malign the government and the NSCN (I-M). 

 Undue importance should not be given to stray individuals holding press conferences and saying this or that, the sources advised the Naga leaders. ?This is a part of politics. But the Indian government is certainly not behind any such activity. It is sincere and serious about negotiating a peaceful settlement with the Nagas. Let there be no doubt about the intention of the government,? they said.

 Raman to finish Akbar land task

 R. KRISHNA DAS

 Raipur, Dec. 1: A task left incomplete by emperor Akbar is likely to be finished centuries later in modern-day Chhattisgarh. 

 The Raman Singh government has decided to conduct a land revenue survey in the Abujmad region of the state. The process, believe it or not, began during the reign of emperor Akbar but could not be completed. 

 Since then, repeated attempts to conduct a survey have failed to yield any result. Now, the BJP government has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the National Remote Sensing Agency (NRSA), Hyderabad, to conduct a survey in the remote area. 

 For the people of Abujmad ? most of whom are tribals ?progress and development are alien concepts. Land record is a distant dream and the poor tribals have no official records of the history of their families and relatives either. 

 ?The absence of any survey is the main stumbling block in the development of the region. There is no information on the classes of trees, herbal medicines, water sources and minerals available in the Abujmad region,? chief minister Singh said. 

 As the tribals have no land records, they cannot take bank loans or benefit from the development schemes of the government. 

 According to the MoU, the survey will be completed in three years at an estimated cost of Rs 5.50 crore. In the first year, aerial surveys will be conducted, followed by ground surveys in the nexttwo years. 

 ?Conducting a survey of Mt Everest will be easier than this. Mapping the topography and conducting a revenue survey in Abujmad is a tough task especially because the terrain is inhospitable and the region inaccessible,? said K. Kameshwar Rao, project manager of NRSA.

 According to land records commissioner and revenue secretary R.C. Sinha, there is evidence that the Mughal emperor was not able to conduct a revenue survey of Abujmad as his officials were not able to reach the place. 

 Later, between 1872 and 1880, the first surveyor-general of India, Edward Everest, conducted a survey in the country. However, his attempts to map the topography of Abujmad failed. Another attempt in 1929 by the British government went in vain as well. In more recent times, the government of undivided Madhya Pradesh excluded Abujmad from its survey.

 According to rough estimates, Sinha said, there are 207 villages in Abujmad, which straddles Dantewada and Bastar districts. 

 Besides problems of terrain and access, the surveyors would also have to deal with activists of the Communist Party of India (Maoist). The Naxalites have a strong presence in the region and use the terrain to their advantage. 

 ?Senior police officials assured us that the Maoists will not be able to hamper the survey. An action plan has been designed but it cannot be disclosed,? Sinha added.

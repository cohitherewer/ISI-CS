 Auto poison antidote

 AYSWARIA VENUGOPAL

 New Delhi, Nov. 14: Five years after becoming the first CNG-driven public transport in India, Delhi?s autorickshaws are set to switch to the next stage that seeks to phase out the use of petrol completely. 

 The autorickshaws will be encouraged to opt for original equipment-manufacturer (OEM) vehicles, which run solely on compressed natural gas. If the campaign proves successful, it will help reduce pollution further as most vehicles continue to use CNG conversion kits which have the option to use petrol.

 Following talks with transport authorities in the capital, Bajaj Auto has announced a ?loyalty programme? under which CNG autorickshaws registered in Delhi can be exchanged for the new machines.

 The proposed switch comes at a time when vehicular emissions account for 70 per cent of environmental pollution in the capital.

 The switch to CNG in 1999 has not stopped some autorickshaws from occasionally using petrol; hence they continue to pollute Delhi?s air despite the change in fuel. Ninety per cent of the 40,000 rickshaws plying on Delhi roads are converted vehicles that operate on a dual fuel mode using CNG conversion kits.

 A throwback to the time when CNG supply was limited, these converted rickshaws were equipped with a half-litre petrol backup, to be used in emergencies. But many a rickshaw driver admits to using petrol at other times. The kits were made available to help owners and the government to meet a court deadline.

 Saying that ?even sustained enforcement action involving imposition of hefty fines has not been sufficient to improve the performance of these autorickshaws?, the Delhi transport department has come up with a plan to ?encourage autorickshaw owners to voluntarily dispose of their polluting machines in favour of new OEM four-stroke CNG three-wheelers?.

 The new rickshaws cost Rs 103,400 including Rs 11,400 sales tax. But Bajaj has offered a Rs 12,000 buy-back concession on an autorickshaw. The old rickshaw?s electronic fare meter can be used on the new machine, helping save another Rs 3,000.

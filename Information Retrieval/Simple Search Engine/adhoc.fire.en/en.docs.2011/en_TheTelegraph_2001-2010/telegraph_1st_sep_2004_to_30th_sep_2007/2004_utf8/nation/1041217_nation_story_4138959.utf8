 Patil plans police revamp

 New Delhi, Dec. 16: Shivraj Patil is the latest comer to knock on finance minister P. Chidambaram?s door for funds ? Rs 1,640 crore no less ? to give the police more teeth.

 The Union home minister wants the police to be prepared to take on terrorists. This will cost more money than finance ministers have been prepared to spend on them until now.

 At a parliamentary consultative committee meeting this morning, Patil said new thinking, more money and attention was required and made out a case for increasing the expenditure on improving the internal security machinery. This would help the police to handle the low-intensity war waged by terrorists and extremists.

 A scheme to partly fund modernisation of central and police forces re-launched nearly four years ago by the National Democratic Alliance government had shown what infusion of additional resources could do but was not very successful because it required state governments to make a matching contribution.

 The scheme was reworked a year ago to classify states in three categories depending on their location and extent of terrorism or extremism. The first category comprising Jammu and Kashmir, Assam, Tripura and Manipur would get 100 per cent central funding; the second, made up of north-eastern states and those affected by Naxal violence, would get 75 per cent funding from the Centre. The remaining states will have to contribute 40 per cent of the funds with the Centre making up the rest.

 Home ministry officials said some states, mostly in the last category, want the Centre to contribute more funds while the ministry has submitted a proposal to have only two categories. The Rs 1,640 crore proposal has been sent to the finance ministry for approval.

 Patil has admitted that money is only part of the problem; the image and attitude of the police is also a worry. An MP said the police needs to upgrade more than its weaponry ? its outlook needs to be modernised and the force needs to shed its colonial hangover.

 A crash amp; close shave on tarmac

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 22: A scooter-borne sub-inspector posted at 10 Janpath, who was giving driving lessons to a woman constable on the tarmac of Indira Gandhi International Airport, almost collided with an international flight about to take off yesterday morning.

 This was the second security breach at the airport yesterday after an Air Sahara security guard keeping vigil near a plane was crushed to death by a Jet Airways bus.

 The lives of 200 passengers on board the Royal Jordanian Airlines plane were endangered when Ashok Bhat, a sub-inspector with the Special Protection Group, and Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) constable Kusum Lata drove into the path of the flight.

 Delhi police have registered a criminal case against the duo on a complaint from airport manager Govind Mis-hra, but are puzzled the constables chose to take driving lessons on the tarmac at 7 am.

 On being quizzed, Ashok and Kusum said they were visiting a pir?s mazaar located on the airport premises. But police officials say the visiting hours at the mazaar, which opens only on Thursdays, are 3-5 pm.

 Senior police officials say the incident has brought to light a number of lapses on the part of the CISF which has recently taken over airport security from Delhi police.

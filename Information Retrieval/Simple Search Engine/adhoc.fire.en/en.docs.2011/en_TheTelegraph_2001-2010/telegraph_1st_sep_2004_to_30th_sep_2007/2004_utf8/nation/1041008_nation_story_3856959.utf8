 Munda rider for IISCO

 RANJAN DASGUPTA 

 Jamshedpur, Oct 7: Chief minister Arjun Munda today said the Indian Iron and Steel Company must add value to the iron ore it mines in Jharkhand if it wants its mining lease in mineral-rich West Singhbhum district renewed.

 ?IISCO has to add value to the iron ore that they mine in Chiriya in West Singhbhum,? Munda told The Telegraph today, making it clear it would be difficult to renew the mining lease if this is not done.

 He said IISCO should set up a steel plant in Jharkhand to add value to the mineral it is exploring. ?How do our state and people benefit if they do not add value to the mineral that they are mining? Our focus is to industrialise the state to generate employment for our people. Or else we would not be in a position to renew the mining lease of IISCO in West Singhbhum,? he said.

 Munda also dropped enough hints that there are many private players who are ready to meet the government?s condition. ?I would not spell out the names of these players. But even if IISCO washes its hands of Chiriya, the state would not stand to lose,? he said.

 IISCO, whom the Steel Authority of India Limited has been assigned to bail out through a merger, has planned to invest over Rs 2,000 crore to expand its Chiriya mines, which has one of the richest deposits in Asia. IISCO has started the groundwork for this. 

 There are six zones where mining activities take place in the more than 90-years-old Chiriya. The mining lease for all but the Macmelean zone expired 25 years ago. IISCO officials say they had applied to the Bihar government in 1978 for the renewal of the other five zones but met with no response.

 But Munda counters: ?It was the responsibility of IISCO to pursue the matter. But IISCO officials apparently did not take the matter seriously. I feel that the company is now eager to get the mining lease renewed since there is a boom in the iron ore market ? domestically and internationally.

 ?I have suggested that if they are unable to add value, we shall allow the company to extract the mineral, which they require for the next 50 years over a certain period of time. And once they do that we shall take possession of that mine and lease it to other players.? 

 Munda expressed annoyance that IISCO has done little to develop the region around Chiriya. ?I had asked them to provide us with a blueprint of the development package that it would initiate if we permit them to undertake the expansion programme. Although they have submitted a report, there is not much of what they intend to do to develop that area,? he said.

 IISCO officials say they have not received any notice from the government directing them to add value to the iron ore mined in the state. ?It is not possible for IISCO to decide whether any steel plant would be set up in Jharkhand. It is for the Union government to take a decision on this matter,? an official said.

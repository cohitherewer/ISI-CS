 Ex-militant stipend row

 New Delhi, Sept. 24: The Supreme Court today issued notices to the Centre and the Jammu and Kashmir chief minister, directing them to explain why compensation to militants should not be struck down as ?illegal? and ?unconstitutional?, reports our legal correspondent.

 A three-judge bench of Chief Justice of India R.C. Lahoti and Justices G.P. Mathur and P.P. Naolekar issued the notices on a public interest litigation by the Society for Human Rights and Civil Liberties that sought a directive from the court striking down the order. 

 The PIL said the state government?s policy of paying each militant who surrenders Rs 1.5 lakh cash and Rs 2,000 monthly ?amounts to glorifying terrorism? and would encourage youngsters to take to arms.

 HC sounds Andhra govt on death-wish patient prod 

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA 

Hyderabad, Dec. 14: Andhra Pradesh High Court 

today sought a reply from the government on 25-year-old muscular dystrophy patient 

K. Venkatesh?s latest request for an amendment to the human organ transplantation 

act to include ?non-heartbeat deaths? also as fit cases for donation. 

 According to the 1995 state law, organs are harvested only from brain dead or clinically dead persons. 

 The terminally ill Venkatesh is keen that his organs are donated and has moved a mercy killing petition. Even as that plea is pending, his counsel, T. Rajendra Prasad, made a fresh petition for inclusion of the ?non-heartbeat death? clause to allow his client to donate his organs as soon as possible in view of his worsening condition. 

 Venkatesh, who has been on a ventilator for the last two weeks, has sought the court?s permission to donate his heart, liver, kidneys and eyes. But doctors attending to him in a private hospital said as he has a bout of pneumonia, chances of a brain death in his case are ?remote?. 

 A division bench of Justice B. Sudarshan Reddy and C.V. Ramulu, which admitted the petition, posted the case for orders tomorrow after a prolonged hearing. 

 Acting on the first petition filed by Venkatesh?s mother before the bench of Chief Justice Devender Gupta and Justice M. Narayan Reddy last week, the court had directed the government to set up a special committee to decide whether Venkatesh?s organs are fit for transplant. 

 The committee, headed by director of medical education Dr Sai Gopal, has submitted its report that his organs can be donated. 

 During arguments today, Justice B. Sudarshan Reddy observed that an interim or ex parte order in the case would tantamount to permitting euthanasia (mercy killing), which was not permitted by the law of the land. 

 The bench reminded that acceptance of the plea for ?non-heartbeat death? cases would go against the 1995 law and sought the government?s opinion. ?Already there is so much abuse of the law and such an amendment will open a Pandora?s box,? Justice Sudarshan Reddy warned.

 At the same time, the court said it was awake to the problems and sufferings of both Venkatesh and his mother, Sujata. 

 As the clock ticks away, Sujata is upset. ?I don?t know what to say. I just pray that everything works out well for Venkatesh to fulfil his last wish. For the first time in my life, I am not sure whether I can do it for him,? she said.

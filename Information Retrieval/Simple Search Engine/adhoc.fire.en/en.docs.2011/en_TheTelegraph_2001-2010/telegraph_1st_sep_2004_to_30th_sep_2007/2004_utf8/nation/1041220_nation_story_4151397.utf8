 Irish group eyes stake in Jagran 

 London, Dec. 19 (PTI): An Irish media baron has evinced interest in acquiring an estimated 30 per cent stake in one of the largest circulated Hindi dailies, Dainik Jagran.

 ?Tony ?reilly, chief executive of Independent News and Media group, is in advanced talks and if successful, the deal will give the Irish entrepreneur?s company a substantial foothold in one of the world?s fastest-growing media markets,? The Sunday Times reported today.

 In the UK, the group owns The Independent, The Independent on Sunday and the Belfast Telegraph group. 

 ?reilly is expected to make an official announcement in the next few days, the report said. ?The deal is likely to cost several tens of millions of euros,? the newspaper quoted a person involved in the talks.

 Based in Kanpur, Jagran is owned by the Gupta family. ?They have been in talks with ?reilly about the sale of a stake since 2000 but, in recent weeks the talks have hotted up,? the report said. ?reilly is said to have negotiated a deal that will allow him to quit the Indian pact if it proves unsuccessful. He will also have the option of increasing the company?s stake if things go well, it said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Out of jail with Sonia war cry

 B.R. SRIKANTH

 Hubli, Sept. 6: Uma Bharti stepped out of jail today with a new weapon in her fiery repertory of words.

 The former Madhya Pradesh chief minister hailed the release order as a victory of nationalism.

 A new thinking on nationalism has arrived on Janmashtami, she said, stressing on the day of her release. I am very happy that the court has given its order on this day. I will go to Udupi tonight for a darshan of Lord Krishna.

 But if Krishna was in her heart, Sonia Gandhi was on her lips.

 Italys mafia war cannot happen here. The court order has taught Sonia Gandhi that bloody revenge will not work here, she said as she launched a blistering attack on the Congress chief and her party for trying to whip up Tricolour politics.

 The firebrand sadhvi, who had been detained on charges of inciting riots after a 1994 flag-raising ceremony on a disputed site resulted in several deaths, said the Congress was trying to drive a wedge between Hindus and Muslims. We will give them a fitting reply in (the) Maharashtra (elections).

 The courts judgment has established that all charges against me were false and that it is not a crime to hoist the national flag, Uma said. Sonia Gandhi can unfurl the flag on our party headquarters in Delhi. We will give her sweets and not file cases against her for unfurling the flag even at the BJP office, she said.

 The release order came amid celebrations on Janmashtami. Uma, an ardent devotee of Krishna, was in prayer while her personal staff were singing bhajans outside the guesthouse, 35 km from here, which had been turned into a makeshift jail.

 Outside the guesthouse campus and in Hubli, the incessant downpour could not dampen the spirits of BJP workers. Their celebrations lasted through the day with 3,000-odd party activists waiting to applaud her at the Vijayothsav late in the evening.

 Umas release came in the wake of the dismissal of the riot charges against her. Judicial magistrate Mohammed Ismail said the Karnataka governments move to withdraw cases against the accused appeared to be bonafide and furthers the cause of justice.

 The magistrate rejected five applications objecting to the governments plea to withdraw the cases against the former chief minister and others.

 After her release, Uma said the date for her tiranga (Tricolour) yatra would be finalised at a meeting of the partys central office-bearers in Bangalore on Wednesday. The aim of the yatra, she added, was to rekindle the spirit of nationalism.

 She also ruled out returning as Madhya Pradesh chief minister.

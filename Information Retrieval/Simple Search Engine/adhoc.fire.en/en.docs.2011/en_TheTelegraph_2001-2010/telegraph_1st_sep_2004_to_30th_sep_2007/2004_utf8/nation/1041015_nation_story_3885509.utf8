 Khadi revamp

 New Delhi, Oct. 14 (PTI): 

 Continuing its detoxification drive, the United Progressive 

 Alliance government today dissolved the Khadi and Village 

 Industries Commission headed by BJP leader Mahesh Sharma 

 ahead of a revamp.

 The removal of Sharma, who was appointed by the previous National Democratic Alliance government, comes a day after the sacking of Censor Board chief Anupam Kher, who was also chosen by the previous regime. Sharma could not be reached for comments.

 Maya Sinha, the commission?s financial adviser and chief executive officer, has been appointed the new commissioner ?till further orders?, an official statement said here.

 The dissolution and revamp is in keeping with the UPA?s pledge in its common minimum programme to make the commission more professional, effective and efficient so that it leads to the development and promotion of khadi and village industries, the statement said.

 The chairman and all other members will have to vacate their office with immediate effect.

 The Centre is setting up a panel to examine the previous khadi commission?s performance and provide suggestions on a revamp. It will also suggest changes in the Khadi and Village Industries Commission Act.

 The panel will have to submit a report within six months of being constituted.

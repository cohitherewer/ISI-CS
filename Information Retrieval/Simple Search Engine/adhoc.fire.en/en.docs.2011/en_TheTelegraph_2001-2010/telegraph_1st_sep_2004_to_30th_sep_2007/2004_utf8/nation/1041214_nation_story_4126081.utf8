 Allies patch up on tech threat

 K. SUBRAHMANYA

 New Delhi, Dec. 13: Tough talking by many Bangalore-based corporate leaders has prompted coalition partners Congress and Janata Dal (Secular) to bury their six-month wrangle over portfolios and send out a signal of political stability in Karnataka.

 Two weeks after some Bangalore-based infotech companies threatened to move out because of the political uncertainty in the state and the uncooperative attitude of the Dharam Singh-led coalition, the alliance partners have decided to constitute a full-fledged ministry on Wednesday.

 Former Prime Minister and Dal (Secular) chief H.D. Deve Gowda, who has been under fire for prolonging the political uncertainty and breaking the trust between the state government and industry, today said his party was ready for the cabinet expansion.

 Industry captains have criticised the Singh government for ignoring infrastructure development in Bangalore and elsewhere in Karnataka.

 For the last six months, the chief minister has been functioning with a ?skeleton ministry? of 12 members ? he can induct another 22 ministers.

 Deve Gowda has said he is ready to name nominees for the 11 slots available to the Dal (Secular). He said his party did not intend to wreck the coalition though it has some differences with the Congress.

 But Deve Gowda, who is accused by detractors in the Congress of being the real power behind the government, disapproved of Singh?s defensive response to industry criticism. The chief minister had rushed to Delhi last week to address the media and reassure the corporate world.

 ?What was the need for the chief minister to come all the way here to address the media?? Deve Gowda asked. Singh acted only after a worried Congress high command asked him to set his house in order.

 Besides asking Singh to ?fully constitute his ministry?, the party high command is also understood to be considering putting the state unit in order. The move to send S.M. Krishna, his predecessor, to Maharashtra as governor is said to be the first step in this direction. The Krishna faction of the state Congress has been vocal in its criticism of Singh.

 Wednesday?s expansion will, for the time being, end speculation within the state unit that Singh might be replaced because of the industry?s growing unhappiness with his government.

 The high command is also considering a new leader for the state unit. Incumbent chief B. Janardhana Poojary has allegedly made things difficult for Singh by constantly criticising the Dal (Secular) and its president.

 Singh sticks to his guns on UN veto

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Manmohan Singh

 New Delhi, Dec. 21: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today made it clear that India wants a permanent seat in the Security Council with full veto powers but said it was too early to ?pre-judge? the outcome of the complex reform process in the UN body.

 ?Let me make it quite clear, there is no ambiguity in our stand. There is no confusion regarding our position on our candidature for a permanent seat on the Security Council,? he said in Parliament after the BJP?s Yashwant Sinha, a former foreign minister, wanted Singh to clarify India?s stand.

 ?At this point,? he added, ?all members have veto power. We are a candidate. This issue may arise in respect of any new permanent member who may be admitted. Our fundamental position remains clear.?

 Sinha had said that reports that India was willing to graduate to a permanent member without veto rights has confused the nation, especially after foreign minister K. Natwar Singh had said in Parliament that Delhi will not be satisfied with second-rung membership.

 As of now, the permanent members ? the US, UK, China, Russia and France ? have veto powers. 

 ?We do not believe that there should be any discrimination in the Security Council and there should be no distinction between permanent members who have the veto and those who do not have veto because this position is based on the broadest possible political consensus,? Singh said.

 But he said the process would take time. ?At this point, there is no clarity on what recommendations will be proposed to the member states by the UN secretary-general and what will be the eventual package adopted by the General Assembly,? the Prime Minister explained. ?The UN is a complex organisation that reflects interplay of a variety of interests. Let us not pre-judge the outcome.? He assured Sinha that India was in touch with all ?countries which matter?.

 Singh also cleared the air on India?s nuclear policy as the former foreign minister had claimed that the Congress-led government appeared divided on what stand to take. ?There is no ambiguity about our nuclear policy. India is a nuclear weapon state and we are a responsible nuclear power,? he said to thumping of desks by both ruling coalition and Opposition members. But he added that India was committed to promoting non-discriminatory nuclear disarmament.

 On India-Pakistan ties, Singh said he had ?emphasised? to President Pervez Musharraf the ?criticality? of his fulfilling the January 6 ?reassurance? to then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee that ?any territory under Pakistan?s control would not be used to support terrorism in any manner?.

 On Kashmir, he said that while Pakistan has been told Delhi is ready to look at ?various options?, he has made it clear to Musharraf that ?we would not agree to any redrawing of boundaries, or another partition of the country?.

 Musharraf had suggested that Jammu and Kashmir (including the part in Pakistan?s possession) be carved into seven regions and demilitarised as a prelude to letting them choose their rulers.

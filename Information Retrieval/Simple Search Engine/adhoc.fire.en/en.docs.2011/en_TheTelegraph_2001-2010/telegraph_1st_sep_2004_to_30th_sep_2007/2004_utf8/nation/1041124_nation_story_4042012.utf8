 Blast accused free after 4 years

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, Nov. 23: Over 

 40 members of a cross-country religious organisation were 

 released this morning, more than four years after they were 

 held in connection with serial blasts in southern India 

 in 2000.

 Judge P. Sri Sudha of the special court set up at the Cherlapally prison complex to try sensitive cases found five activists of the Deendar Anjuman guilty of ?possessing explosive substances? and 38 others of ?criminal conspiracy? based on circumstantial evidence alone.

 The conviction came in 14 cases for possession of explosives but the court found no evidence of their involvement in the five blasts of improvised explosive devices in Andhra Pradesh.

 The small-intensity blasts had occurred in a church in Medak, a temple each in Vijayawada and Guntur, a Jewish memorial at Ongole in Prakasam district and at a Christian congregation in Machilipatnam in Krishna district. There were no casualties.

 All 43, taken into custody on the charge of planting explosives in religious places in various towns of Andhra, Karnataka and Goa, were ordered released as they had already served around four-and-a-half years ? the term of the sentence ? in jail since their arrest in July 2000.

 They were set free this morning to celebrations by over 100 families of the Deendar Anjuman that live together in a separate colony at Asifnagar here.

 Faiz Zabiullah, son of the Deendar secretary, said the organisation?s innocence had been proved. ?Just for the activities of some of its members, the entire community came to be blamed,? he said at the prison complex, about 20 km from Hyderabad.

 Begum Sukhia, the 32-year-old wife of Mohammed Humayun Khan, who was acquitted of the charge of planting a bomb at a Jewish memorial at Ongole, said the judgment vindicated all of them. ?We are preachers of peace and tranquility. We do not support violence,? she said.

 Zilani Maqbool, acquitted of the charge of planting a bomb at a Christian congregation in Machilipatnam in June 2000, said false cases were foisted on them.

 The feasting to mark the members? release notwithstanding, Deendar secretary Khari Siddiqui expressed fears. ?Religious or non-religious, it is not safe to live as a Muslim in this country. Our houses were demolished and properties taken away. Women, children and the aged lived in penury for years. We have tasted one of the bitter regimes of persecution since Independence,? he said.

 The Deendar Anjuman is an organisation of Muslims founded in 1924 by Hazrath Moulana Siddiqui, who was from northern Karnataka of the Nizam?s domain.

 After Partition, his son Ziaul Hasan migrated to Pakistan and founded a branch in Mardan province. He went on to become the spiritual leader of the organisation in both countries. 

 Police alleged that he was exporting mercenaries and arms to India through his outfit.

 Paswan frowns, Laloo smiles

 Paswan: Left alone

 New Delhi, Nov. 15: The BJP allies? decision to strengthen the NDA has dashed the hopes of Lok Janashakti Party chief Ram Vilas Paswan. But it has come as a relief to both the Rashtriya Janata Dal and the BJP.

 Paswan has been striving hard to forge an alliance with the Janata Dal (United) in Bihar. With Nitish Kumar attending his iftar in Patna last week, speculation was rife about the Dal (U) quitting the saffron camp. 

 However, today?s NDA meeting sent out signals not quite matching Paswan?s plans. His condition for a tie-up with the Dal (U) is that it should quit the BJP-led alliance.

 The BJP in Bihar, however, has reasons to cheer. The state?s elections are just three months away and the party is sorely missing a leader of the stature of Laloo Prasad Yadav or Paswan. Thus, it cannot hope to better its electoral prospects without the Dal (U).

 The RJD, on the other hand, hopes to win over Dal (U) leaders not too comfortable with the BJP, sources said. 

 Former Bihar chief minister and state Dal (U) leader Jagnnath Mishra had said it would be ?suicidal? for his party to continue its alliance with the BJP after L.K. Advani took over as president.

 ?The NDA was formed to run the government at the Centre and after being voted out, the alliance should be disbanded,? he had said.

 With the Dal (U) deciding to stick by the NDA, Laloo Prasad can breathe easy as Paswan?s plans of forging a ?formidable? anti-RJD front seem to be grounded.

 Paswan had recently gone out of his way to craft a Dalit-Muslim vote bank on the lines of Laloo Prasad?s time-tested Muslim-Yadav combination. The LJP leader was also planning to field a large number of Muslim candidates in the elections.

 However, the fear of the BJP is expected to drive the minority voters towards the RJD. 

 At the Dal (U) national executive in Ranchi last month, Nitish Kumar and Sharad Yadav had slammed the BJP?s return to Hindutva, raising hopes in the Paswan camp. The party had even passed a resolution warning the BJP. 

 However, RJD sources claimed that they knew the Dal (U) would never quit the BJP as long as George Fernandes was at the helm.

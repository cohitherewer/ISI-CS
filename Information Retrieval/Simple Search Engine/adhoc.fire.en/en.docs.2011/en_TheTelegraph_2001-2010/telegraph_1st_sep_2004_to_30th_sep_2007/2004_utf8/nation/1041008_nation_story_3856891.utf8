 Stolen goat sparks clash

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Burhanpur (Madhya Pradesh), Oct. 7: Barely 25 km from election-bound Maharashtra, members of two communities here lost patience over a stolen goat, resulting in pitched battles, stone-pelting and curfew. Fifty-three people were injured.

 The town of Burhanpur dates back to the era of Mughal emperors Akbar and Shahjahan. Empress Mumtaz Mahal had lived and died here before her mortal remains were shifted to the Taj Mahal in Agra. But Wednesday?s events were a blot on the city?s history and heritage as two communities fought with swords, knives and wooden batons.

 Kanshinath, a resident of the Lalbagh area, had lodged a complaint with police claiming that a boy, Anwar, had forcibly taken away his goat. 

 Anwar, however, claimed that he had purchased it. Kanshinath later told the police that he had also filed an FIR three months ago when some people had stoned his goat. He alleged that during his absence, Anwar had also manhandled his wife and daughter.

 As police were trying to settle the dispute, rumours spread in the town that members of a minority community were misbehaving with women from another community. Sensing trouble, district collector Veena Ghanekar summoned a meeting of the local peace committee. As members of the peace committee headed towards the houses of Kanshinath and Anwar, some people began pelting stones. Within hours, dozens of shops were looted, prompting the police to clamp curfew.

 Superintendent of police D. Srinivas Rao told The Telegraph: ?The situation is under control but what happened yesterday was shocking. How and why should a simple dispute over a stolen goat take a communal colour??

 Burhanpur is about 90 km from Jalgaon and 300 km northeast of Mumbai. 

 The police have ruled out any link with the Assembly polls in neighbouring Maharashtra but district authorities did not rule out the possibility. A number of people from both the communities have political affiliation to the Congress or the BJP.

 In recent times, there have been a series of incidents where two communities have clashed. In Indore, they attacked each other after a girl eloped with a boy. Similar incidents have taken place in Ujjain, Gwalior and Sehore.

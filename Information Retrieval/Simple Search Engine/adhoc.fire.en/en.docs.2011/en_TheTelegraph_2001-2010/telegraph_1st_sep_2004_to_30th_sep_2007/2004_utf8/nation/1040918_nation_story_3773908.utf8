 Bangla link in surgery debut

 Chennai: Nazma Begum can finally sit 

 down to pray after five years, thanks to a ?revolutionary? 

 surgery in Chennai, reports our special correspondent.

 The 42-year-old Bangladeshi woman was suffering from severe backpain and could not even bend to offer namaaz when she arrived from Dhaka in the first week of September. Today, dressed in a light green salwaar kameez, Nazma walked before a small audience as the first beneficiary of a ?revolution in spinal surgery ? the lumbar disc replacement surgery?.

 ?For the first time in India, a team of orthopaedic doctors from Apollo (Hospitals) have performed the spinal arthroplasty,? said the hospital?s chairman, Dr. P.C. Reddy, minutes before Nazma?s husband Mohammed Ali introduced her to the gathering.

 Dr Sajan K. Hegde showed the ?series of delicate steps? that were taken to remove the defective disc and insert a bio-compatible artificial disc in its place. Doctors later checked with an image intensifier whether the implant had been placed in the correct spot. 

 Nazma was able to walk ?24 hours after the surgery though we have advised her to be cautious for another few weeks?, said Sajan.

 The surgery took roughly two hours.

 SC blow to Pandya accused

 New Delhi (PTI): The Supreme Court today 

 dismissed a plea of Mohammad Asgar Ali, accused of murdering 

 former Gujarat home minister Haren Pandya, seeking transfer 

 of the case outside the state.

 A bench of Justices . Santosh Hegde and S.B. Sinha said ?we find no merit? in the plea.

 hen the counsel suggested that the accused would not get a fair trial in Gujarat, the court asked: ?Do you mean to say that no case involving a particular community should be tried in Gujarat? Should all the courts in Gujarat be closed??

 However, when Asgar?s counsel contended that defence witnesses were apprehensive of going to Gujarat to give evidence, the bench directed the CBI to provide security to them as and when the accused made such a request.

 Asgar and others were arrested from Hyderabad by the CBI on charges of killing Pandya in May 2003. A month later, the state government had invoked the anti-terror act against them. 

 The apex court said the grounds shown by the accused for transferring the case was too general.

 Magic getaways from monster

 Miracle tales from the disaster zone:

 Colachal (Tamil Nadu): A two-year-old was found alive beside her mother?s body in a graveyard, three days after being given up for dead. The child, weak from hunger and exposure, was found by people who had gone to the graveyard, near a village here, to bury tsunami victims. She was taken to the government hospital in Nagercoil, where she is being nursed back to health, official sources said. The child?s mother has been identified as one Vasanthi. (PTI)

 Penang (Malaysia): The parents of a 20-day-old baby, who survived the tsunami by floating on a mattress, said her escape was ?a real miracle?. S. Tulasi was sleeping in a room in the family restaurant in this northern resort island when massive waves hit the area, sweeping her parents out of the building. When her parents struggled back into the restaurant, they discovered her floating on a mattress in 1.5-metre-deep water.

 ?We know this was a real miracle, thanks to god,? her mother Ann Malay, 44, said.

 Malay said she has lived by the sea her entire life and Sunday?s waves would not frighten her family into moving elsewhere. ?We will stay here,? she said. ?We will repair our place and continue our lives.? (AP)

 Taipei: A six-year-old girl from Taiwan, Yeh Chia-ni, vacationing with her parents in Phi Phi island, clung to a coconut tree for more than 20 hours to escape the deadly waves. ?I didn?t know how long I waited there but it was a long time. I waited until morning. I was thinking my daddy and mommy would come and rescue me,? the girl said.

 Her mother is one of two people from Taiwan missing in Thailand. ?I am not very strong. Without water to drink, I had even less strength,? said Yeh, whose arms and legs were injured. She also had six stitches in her forehead.

 ?I was hung there.... A foreigner climbed up (the tree) and saved me,? she said. ?I thought my parents didn?t want me anymore. I hadn?t had breakfast, lunch and dinner for a long time.? (Reuters)

 Bangkok: Four-year-old Vathanyu Pha-opas has been reunited with his parents after being stranded on a tree in southern Thailand without food and water for more than two days. ?It is a miracle that he is alive and still asks for sweets and biscuits. I don?t know how he managed to survive with only minor bruises and some mosquito bites,? Vathanyu?s father Suthipong Pha-opas said. ?I had given up hope of seeing him again.?

 Suthipong, 26, said his son was playing near their flimsy wooden house when the tsunami smashed into Khao Lak resort. 

 ?I was convinced I?d lost him because he cannot swim,? the fisherman said. ?I was out five miles offshore in a boat with a friend when the big waves hit. We floated in the sea for four or five hours before being rescued.? (Reuters)

 Hong Kong: The tsunami sucked a Hong Kong couple out of their hotel room in Phuket, Thailand, and they floated on a mattress and a piece of wood until rescuers came for them seven hours later. ?Before I spotted that mattress, I thought I was going to die because I could not go on any more with my injuries and tiredness,? said the wife, Leung Wai-kei, who escaped with torn ligaments in her foot and cuts and bruises.

 Her husband, who clung to a piece of wood, said the currents dragged them down and spat them to the surface repeatedly but they kept one another in sight most of the time.

 ?I was constantly calling out his full name because I thought other men would think I was calling them and answer if I just yelled ?hubby?,? Leung told Hong Kong newspapers. (Reuters)

 Colombo: Jordanian tourist Ahmed Hmoud was relaxing by the pool of a palm-fringed resort on Sri Lanka?s southern coast when a monster wave roared up from the beach and swept him and his wife through the hotel?s garden before they clambered onto an upper floor of the building.

 From their perch, they looked in horror as bodies, luggage, furniture and even a tractor floated past. His son and future daughter-in-law were rescued from their room.

 ?When we saw the news, we were shocked because we had no idea how big this thing was,? said Hmoud, who came to Sri Lanka to watch his son get married on an idyllic white sand beach. (Reuters)

 Jerusalem: A pair of Israeli newlyweds described how a Palestinian couple came to their rescue during Thailand?s tsunami disaster, paying for them to fly back home after they had lost their cash.

 Yossi and Inbar Gross from Kiryat Gat, an Israeli town close to Tel Aviv, and Samy and Sally Khuri, from east Jerusalem, were staying in the same hotel in Phuket. After a romantic stroll on the beach, the Israeli couple went up to their room only to find ?a huge wave arriving?, Yossi told the Maariv newspaper after arriving in Israel.

 He and his wife managed to flee but their belongings, including money and passports, were washed away by the killer wave. The Khuris lent them the necessary cash to fly back to Israel. 

 ?They are simply an amazing couple. They paid for one hotel night and our plane tickets. It?s wonderful,? Yossi said. (AFP)

 Salman takes up UP reins

 K. SUBRAHMANYA

 New Delhi, Nov. 6: The Congress central leadership today appointed Salman Khursheed the Pradesh Congress Committee president in Uttar Pradesh, reviving its Brahmin-Muslim-weaker sections, or BMW, approach to strengthen the party in the state.

 Salman?s return to Lucknow may intensify the running spat between the Congress and the ruling Samajwadi Party. Not so long ago, Salman, a known Mulayam Singh-baiter, had said: ?If I leave politics I will write; if Mulayam leaves politics he will be in prison.?

 The announcement of Salman?s appointment made by Satyavrat Chaturvedi, the AICC general secretary in charge of Uttar Pradesh, here this evening came a day after party chief Sonia Gandhi made public her move to replace state Congress chief Jagadambika Pal.

 For Salman, appointed an AICC general secretary just over three months ago, it will be his second stint as state Congress chief in the heartland under Sonia?s leadership. Soon after she took over as Congress president in 1998, Sonia had sent Salman to Lucknow to revive the party, but he was replaced after the Congress? dismal showing in the 1999 Lok Sabha polls.

 His appointment now is being seen as a clear indication of the party leadership?s intention to confront the Samajwadi Party. 

 Salman believes that without taking the Samajwadis head-on, the Congress cannot hope to regain its support base among Muslims or successfully woo back the upper caste Brahmins and Thakurs.

 To revive the party in the heartland, Sonia had appointed Chaturvedi, a youthful Brahmin leader from Madhya Pradesh, as party general secretary whose job would be to bring back Brahmins into the party fold. 

 Earlier, veteran Brahmin leaders Motilal Vora and Nawal Kishore Sharma, who were also on the same job, had failed. Between them, party treasurer Vora and now Gujarat governor Sharma were in charge of the state?s affairs for over four years.

 Salman?s appointment to Uttar Pradesh and Chaturvedi?s presence completes the new BM (Brahmin-Muslim) combination in the state. 

 Indications are that the leadership may induct prominent leaders from weaker sections ? particularly Dalits ? to higher party posts when the new state unit chief reconstitutes the PCC. 

 Salman is also a votary of forging an alliance with Mayavati?s Bahujan Samaj Party to fight the Samajwadi Party.

 In his first stint as PCC chief, Salman could hardly weaken Mulayam Singh?s stranglehold over the state?s Muslims. But party leaders believe that ?there is a qualitative change? between the circumstances four years ago and now. 

 ?It is true that Salman was president earlier also. But we feel there is a qualitative change in the circumstances and this time he can be very effective,? Chaturvedi said.

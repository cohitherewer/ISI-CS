 Valley erupts in rape rage 

 MUKHTAR AHMAD

 Srinagar, Nov. 10: Srinagar erupted in widespread public anger on the fourth day of protests against an alleged double rape by an army major even as a separatist leader was detained.

 Parts of the Valley have been tense since November 6 after news spread about the alleged rape of a mother and her 10-year-old daughter at Badran village near Handwara, 80 km north of Srinagar, during a search operation.

 This morning, youths took to the streets in the heart of the summer capital, shouting pro-freedom and anti-government slogans. 

 They pelted police with stones, burnt tyres, tried to force markets shut and repeatedly tried to block the main road in Lal Chowk, the city centre. Police retaliated with teargas shells and repeated baton charges. In the afternoon, there was a repeat in Maisuma locality. 

 Shops in most parts of the city were closed following a call given by the Kashmir Bar Association and the Dukhtaran-e-Milat, a women?s separatist group. Traffic, however, was plying.

 Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front chief Mohammad Yasin Malik was detained moments after he handed a letter protesting against the rape to the UN military observer group based here. Malik said he was beaten by police at the UN office, but a police officer denied the charge. He said Malik was taken into custody for disturbing public order.

 The National Conference demanded a judicial probe, and its leaders and workers took out a procession here seeking action against the army officer. 

 The army has denied the rape allegation but ordered a high-level probe by a senior army officer following the public protests.

 A defence spokesman here said that ?consequent to the allegation of molesting a mother-daughter duo, the army authorities have shifted the accused officer from the area of operation in Handwara?.

 State government sources, however, said the major has been shifted out of the command for the conduct of the inquiry.

 Yesterday, ruling People?s Democratic Party president Mehbooba Mufti came face to face with public anger when she visited the alleged victims in Handwara.

 As Mehbooba was assuring the mother and daughter of stern action against the guilty, angry villagers surrounded the house and tried to manhandle the MP.

 Commandos of the Special Services Group fired several rounds in the air to escort Mehbooba, the chief minister?s daughter, to safety. The crowd, however, pelted her motorcade with stones.

 They were angry that chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed had said that the daughter was not raped even while he said that the alleged molestation of the mother was being probed.

 Kashmir University was closed today following three days of violent demonstrations, with a police vehicle in the premises being torched yesterday.

 Clashes between the students, including those from the adjacent National Institute of Technology, and police continued till late yesterday, with batons and teargas being used.

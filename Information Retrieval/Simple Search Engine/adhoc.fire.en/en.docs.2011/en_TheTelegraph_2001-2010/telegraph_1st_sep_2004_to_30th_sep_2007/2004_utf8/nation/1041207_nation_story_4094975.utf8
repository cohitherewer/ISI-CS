 Buzz on PM Pakistan tour

 OUR BUREAU

 Islamabad/New Delhi, Dec. 6: The Indian high commissioner to Pakistan has said Prime Minister Manmohan Singh could travel to Islamabad early next year.

 ?Prime Minister Manmohan Singh wishes to come to Pakistan early next year,? Shiv Shankar Menon told reporters today. 

 (However, a senior Indian official refused to confirm the statement, saying he was aware only of a plan by foreign minister Natwar Singh to go to Pakistan, adds our special correspondent in Delhi.)

 President Pervez Musharraf had invited Singh to Pakistan during their September 24 meeting in New York. 

 The schedule is likely to be firmed up after talks between Indian and Pakistani foreign secretaries, scheduled for December 27 and 28 in Islamabad.

 Indian national security adviser J.N. Dixit and Musharraf?s trusted aide Tariq Aziz are also expected to hold talks on December 22 and 23.

 Menon also announced plans to offer 100 scholarships to Pakistani students for studies in India.

 Menon, currently touring the Southern Sindh province, met officials in Karachi yesterday to discuss plans to reopen the Indian consulate.

 Renovation of the Indian consulate, which was closed after the demolition of the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya, has begun. But it will be reopened when a Pakistani mission can start functioning in Mumbai. A search is on in the Indian financial capital for a building to house the mission.

 Bus talks

 Negotiations for the bus service between the two Kashmirs will begin in Delhi tomorrow.

 Aware of the goodwill that easier travel will generate among Kashmiris on both sides of the divide, Delhi is prepared to show a great degree of flexibility to ensure that the confidence-building measure does not fall through, officials said.

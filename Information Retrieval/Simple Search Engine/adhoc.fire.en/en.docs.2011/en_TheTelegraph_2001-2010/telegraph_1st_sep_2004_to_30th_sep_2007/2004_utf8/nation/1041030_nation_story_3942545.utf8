 Scandal minister gets CM backing

 JOHN MARY

 Thiruvananthapuram, Oct. 29: Pro-Opposition youth and women organisations have taken to the streets, seeking the ouster of a high-profile minister in the Oommen Chandy cabinet who has been accused of sexually exploiting a minor in 1996.

 Rejina, 23, said in the northern Kerala town of Kozhikode yesterday that industry minister P.K. Kunhalikutty had ?used? her three times at different locations when he served in the 1991-96 A.K. Antony cabinet and later bribed her into retracting her charges before a magistrate.

 But Chandy has rejected the demand for Kunhalikutty?s ouster and a re-investigation into what has come to be known as the ?Kozhikode ice-cream parlour sex case?. ?The case has been properly investigated and is in court. The law will take its own course,? the chief minister said at the hill shrine of Sabarimala near Kottayam.

 Chandy said the guilty would be punished irrespective of their stature but his government would not allow anyone to be blackmailed. ?The very fact that the girl had changed her statement several times in the past has proven that she could be easily influenced,? he said.

 Amid the furore, it was reported that Rejina has been missing since this morning. But police said they had not received any complaint and no case had been registered.

 K. Ajita of the Anweshi Women?s Counselling Centre which blew the whistle more than seven years ago said Rejina had telephoned her this morning to say her life was in danger. Ajita said she had offered to let Rejina stay at the Anweshi Short Stay Home at Kozhikode but she had not turned up till late evening.

 Indian Union Muslim League leader Kunhalikutty, on his way to perform Umrah, said in Jeddah that the case was ?politically motivated?. For the second day in a row, he said he had never seen the alleged victim. He added that the case was protracted and Supreme Court had rejected a demand that charges be framed against him. ?Therefore, the court has exonerated me,? the minister said.

 Even so, there were a number of protest rallies against Kunhalikutty in front of the secretariat here today. Yuva Morcha activists burnt his effigy while pro-Marxist Democratic Youth Federation of India cadre marched to the minister?s official residence.

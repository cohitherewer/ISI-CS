 Tired of politics, back to films

 M.R. VENKATESH

 M. Karunanidhi

 Chennai, Sept. 9: One of 

 the oldest authors of many a twist and turn in Indian politics 

 today made a quiet comeback to his original vocation ? writing 

 scripts for Tamil cinema. 

 Nearly 52 years after he created a sensation with his powerful dialogues and reformatory zeal in Parasakthi, 81-year-old DMK leader Muthuvel Karunanidhi stepped into AVM Studios here this morning to pen a script for the Tamil film Kannamma. 

 Parasakthi (1952) under the joint banner of AVM ? one of the oldest film companies in the south ? and National Pictures, also catapulted the late Shivaji Ganesan into stardom as the one who delivered Karunanidhi?s lines attacking religious charlatanism and exploitation. 

 Now, it is the shadow of the Kargil war of 1999 that has come to haunt the once hotshot screenwriter. Kannamma is the new expression of his artistic urge, a Baba Films production that documents the travails of a war widow in Tamil Nadu. 

 For Karunanidhi, what began with Ganesan in the lead, 52 years ago, blossomed into a hit partnership with Marudhur Gopala Ramachandra Menon, MGR to the masses. Marudha Naatu Ilavarasi, 1950, and Malaikallan, 1954 followed. 

 MGR hogged the halo of the Tamil film industry as Karunanidhi wrote stirring scripts. However, like all films, the partnership had The End. Karunanidhi and MGR split to lead two parties, the DMK and the ADMK, which still dominate Tamil politics. MGR played political mentor to his celluloid heroine, Jayalalithaa, the arch-rival of Karunanidhi now.

 Today, on the lawns of the sprawling AVM Studios, Karunanidhi was nostalgic. The array of trees that stood in stark contrast to the concrete jungle of Chennai whispered to him memories of October 1952, when Parasakthi was made at the same venue. 

 ?My comeback to the studios should be mutually consoling, you (filmdom) are going through a bad patch and I am too fatigued and distraught with politics,? Karunanidhi said. 

 The last time he scripted a film was in 1996 ? Puthiya Paraskathi.

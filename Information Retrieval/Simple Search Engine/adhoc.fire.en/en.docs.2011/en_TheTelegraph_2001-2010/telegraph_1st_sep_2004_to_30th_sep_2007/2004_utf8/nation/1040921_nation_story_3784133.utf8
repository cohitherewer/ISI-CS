 Shield for informers

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Ranchi, Sept. 20: The Central Vigilance Commission has come up with a ?fool-proof? method to guard the identities of whistleblowers, Sujit Banerjee, the CVC secretary, said.

 The arrangement has been made under the Public Interest Disclosure Resolution, which can also be called the Whistleblower?s Resolution.

 ?What we have arranged for is that the complainant?s identity would be removed from the complaint letter. Though the commission would send the information or copies of the complaint to the relevant department or ministry for a follow-up or reply, that document would have nothing on it to reveal the source or lead to the source,? the official said.

 A complainant?s identity would be kept in a locker, to which only a select few top officials would have access. Even the commission staff engaged in the probe and follow-ups would not have any information about the complainant. This step was necessary in the wake of the Satyendra Dubey incident, Banerjee said.

 Shell distress dumping

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Oct. 6: Panic-stricken steel factories in Uttar Pradesh are dumping loads of shells by the roadside to avoid getting caught, police officers investigating killer explosions at a Ghaziabad steel factory said today.

 Last week, 10 people had died and several were injured in explosions at the Bhushan Steel and Strips in Ghaziabad while labourers were sifting through imported scrap that later yielded live shells.

 This morning, 18 shells that looked like rockets were found in the Azadnagar area of Aligarh district. Police suspect these were already present in factory godowns among mountains of scrap.

 Some villagers going to their field for work spotted them and informed the police, said inspector Binod Yadav of Harduaganj police station. ?Some shells were 1.5 ft long and others 2.5 ft.?

 District superintendent of police Udayshankar Jaiswal said: ?Most of these shells are rusty and old. But these appear to have been dumped recently.?

 He added that the army has been asked to examine the origin of the ?war material? and ascertain its status. The police, too, have begun an inquiry.

 Yesterday, the police had seized 12 rockets of 2.5 ft each found dumped in the Aruna locality near the Aligarh-Bulandshahr road in Bulandshahr district.

 The find, said police sources in the district, had triggered panic in the area. ?So we had to bury the shells so these could not go off,? an officer said.

 A preliminary inquiry into the recovery of shells has linked these to the abundance of war material in Iran and Iraq and a lax checking system at the country?s docks.

 ?There is so much war material scattered all around in Iran and Iraq that these are finding their way into India through the heaps of scraps,? said Alok Sinha, principal secretary, home, Uttar Pradesh.

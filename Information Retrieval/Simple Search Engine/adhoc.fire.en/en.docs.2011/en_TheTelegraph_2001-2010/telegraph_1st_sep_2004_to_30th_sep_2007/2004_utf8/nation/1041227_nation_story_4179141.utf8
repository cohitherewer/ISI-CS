 Wake-up call with three whiplashes

 Chennai, Dec. 26: Giant waves churned up by a massive earthquake across the ocean came crashing on the Tamil Nadu coast as most people were waking to a lazy winter Sunday, killing 1,567 people. 

 The tremors, measuring 8.9 on the Richter scale, originated under the sea off Indonesia?s Sumatra island, triggering a train of tsunamis that lashed the Tamil Nadu shore at least thrice. 

 They wreaked havoc across Chennai, Pondicherry, Cuddalore and Nagapattinam down to Kanyakumari on the southern tip of peninsular India. 

 The first ? and most ferocious ? tsunami to hit India in living memory touched land around 7.30 am, 45 minutes after mild tremors were felt in Chennai. The wave, said to be about 10 metres high, swamped large swathes of Chennai and washed away fishing villages in minutes. 

 ?I saw five bodies floating suddenly,? said a witness at Tiruvottiyur in north Chennai. Altogether, 128 persons were drowned in Chennai. 

 Half-submerged cars and wrecked boats lay on the famed 12-km Marina Beach. ?My mother had gone to the seaside to buy fish when the wave came and lifted her,? said a dazed Muthulakshmi, a fisherman?s wife, standing on a pavement with hundreds of refugees. 

 ?It took an hour for us to go and recover her body. Thank God my husband had not gone to sea as he was unwell.?

 The second tsunami hit around 9 am and a more modest one after noon, a fisherman on the Marina beach here said. Nagapattinam was the worst-hit district, accounting for nearly 800 deaths. Cuddalore and Kanyakumari recorded 290 and 261 deaths, respectively. 

 Chief minister Jayalalithaa surveyed the affected areas by air in the afternoon. Touching down, she regretted ?everything seems to have happened in 20 minutes?. She spoke to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on telephone. 

 ?Never in my life I have had such an experience. The whole area has been turned into a cemetery,? said Chellappa, a 55-year-old fisherman. 

 ?I was standing by the seashore when I noticed the sea level rising but I was not concerned then because I only thought it was an unusually high tide,? said Chellappa. ?Then I heard an eerie sound that I have never heard before. It was a high-pitched sound followed by a deafening roar. I told everyone to run for their life and I started sprinting inland.? 

 The mild tremors here at 6.33 am, four minutes after the sea-floor convulsion off Sumatra, jolted the people here, but could never have prepared them for the death and destruction that the tsunamis were bearing towards the shore. 

 The army, navy and the coast guard have been pressed into relief and rescue operations. The Southern Air Command is making sorties to rescue over 500 people feared stranded on the Vivekananda Rock off Kanyakumari.

 Chennai was last rocked by a 5.6 quake on September 25, 2001. Some 60 years ago, meteorologist P.C.S. Rao said a tsunami was reported to have struck Chennai.

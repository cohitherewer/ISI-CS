 Poll byword vikas, not Sonia sacrifice

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 Sonia, Pawar

 New Delhi, Sept. 28: If the BJP has decided to forsake Savarkar and the Tricolour, the Congress may downplay Sonia Gandhi?s ?sacrifice? and Manmohan Singh?s ?commitment? because the byword for the parties in the Maharashtra elections is ?vikas?. 

 The Congress-Nationalist Congress Party will purvey their Democratic Front government?s ?achievements? on the development front while the BJP-Shiv Sena will outline the largesse they will shower if elected to power. 

 AICC media cell chief Girija Vyas told the media today that ?provoking the emotions of people? was not the Congress? strategy. ?Sometimes in the past, it worked. But when people compared their (BJP-Sena) record of governance and development, they realised how flawed it was.? 

 The ruling partners? thrust areas, she said, would be ?farmers, industrialists and migrants?. They will play up the following among the government?s ?achievements?: 

 Waiving loans taken by 

 farmers to buy agricultural pumps from July 2000

 Loan waiver of Rs 375 crore 

 for rabi 2003 and kharif 2004

 Completion of half the 

 targeted irrigation schemes

 Tightening the law against 

 moneylenders because of the increase in farmer suicides

 Distribution of Rs 50 crore 

 under cooperative insurance scheme to cotton and orange 

 growers

 Creating a ?Golden Triangle? 

 of Mumbai, Pune and Nashik to accelerate industrial growth. 

 But some of the schemes exist 

 on paper as they were announced just before the Election 

 Commission?s model code of conduct came into force. 

 The Congress was at first reluctant to focus its campaign on the state government, fearing the perceived ?anti-incumbency? sentiment would go against it. 

 The strategy was revisited after the party?s central leadership got the feedback that the good rains this year had mitigated the impact of earlier drought years, and that the Sushil Shinde government had regained some ?goodwill?.

 Added to that was the BJP shifting gear from regional issues to the Savarkar and Tricolour controversies and back.

 By the BJP?s admission, both campaigns failed. The first involved protests against removal of a plaque of Savarkar?s words from a memorial at Cellular Jail in Port Blair.

 The second was the tiranga yatra led by Uma Bharti. 

 Congress sources said the headstart the BJP-Sena gained after Pramod Mahajan and Bal Thackeray went to town on malnutrition deaths, farmer suicides and power shortage had rattled the party but it was ?more comfortable now?.

 One Raj slips, another scores 

 K. SUBRAHMANYA

 New Delhi, Sept. 21: The clout of Raj the nephew may have waned in Maharashtra?s political circles, but Raj the son-in-law has arrived.

 Raj Shroff, chief minister Sushil Shinde?s son-in-law, has virtually gatecrashed into political limelight even as his namesake in the Shiv Sena, Raj Thackeray, lost out in the intra-family battle for control of the party to his cousin Uddhav, Bal Thackeray?s son.

 Widely considered in state Congress circles as a fast emerging power centre at Shinde?s Malabar Hill residence in Mumbai, the young son-in-law has come to the forefront with a bang. If fortune favours him, the unofficial representative of the chief minister?s official residence would from next month also represent the people of the Malabar Hill area.

 Brushing aside resentment among sections of the state unit, the leadership today named Shroff the party candidate from the Malabar Hill Assembly segment.

 The young man gained, but a veteran lost out. B.A. Desai, a former additional solicitor-general, joined the list of about half a dozen of the 74 Congress legislators who failed to get a party ticket. Desai, sources said, had been lobbying for a ticket for his daughter in case the leadership preferred youth to experience.

 In his early thirties, Shroff, a budding industrialist, was not the obvious choice of the central leadership. Because of the widespread resentment over his alleged clout with the chief minister, the leadership had deferred a decision on the Malabar Hill ticket while announcing candidates yesterday for the October 13 polls.

 But with just 24 hours left for filing nominations, the high command obliged the chief minister with the ticket. According to the sources, Shroff had camped in the capital the last few days while Shinde and other senior state Congress leaders finalised nominations with party chief Sonia Gandhi and other central leaders.

 Shinde and Shroff must consider themselves lucky. Only a few days ago, Sonia had shot down a proposal that envisaged forcing a byelection in Andhra Pradesh?s Cuddapah parliamentary seat to pave the way for chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy?s industrialist son Jaganmohan?s entry into the Lok Sabha.

 Uncle and sitting MP Vivekananda Reddy had gone to the extent of submitting his resignation letter to Speaker Somnath Chatterjee for his nephew?s sake.

 If only fortune had smiled on the other nephew. After all, Raj was till recently considered his uncle?s chosen successor.

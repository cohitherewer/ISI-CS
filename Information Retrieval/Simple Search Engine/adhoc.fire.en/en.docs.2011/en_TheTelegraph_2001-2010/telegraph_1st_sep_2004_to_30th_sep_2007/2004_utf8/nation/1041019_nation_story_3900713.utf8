The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Roar after wound

 CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA

 Thackeray

Mumbai, Oct. 18: Zakhmi sher ki khaufnaak dahaad ? a wounded tiger?s roar is more menacing.

 Bal Thackeray ? still nursing a cut on his chin and his beard because he promised he would keep the hair till he wins ? finally let out a roar. In his first statement since the defeat in the Assembly elections, the Shiv Sena chief today lashed out at the minorities and blamed the Congress for nursing the community as a vote bank, which might pose a grave danger for the country.

 In the leading article of Saamna, the Sena mouthpiece, Thackeray lambasted the minorities, signalling that the Sena thinks returning to its earlier hardline will restore it to its voters.

 ?The consolidated votes of the Muslims and the outsiders have gone against the Sena-BJP alliance,? he said.

 Using a crude colloquial expression, the Sena chief thundered that he was warning the Congress that encouraging the minorities would backfire on the country.

 Thackeray also launched an attack on his other favourite flogging horse, Congress president Sonia Gandhi. ?What is Sonia Gandhi? Tomorrow if there is a calamity caused by the Muslims, she will go back to Italy with her two children. We don?t want to be part of this regime.?

 While targeting the minority community in general, Thackeray chose to hit ?Bangladeshi intruders? in particular. ?The Congress may be focusing on the Muslim vote bank, but the party should know that the community includes Bangladeshi Muslims as well.? 

 He said the situation is becoming more critical with greater influx of ?outsiders? every day and this could spread Islamic fundamentalism in the country with a ?weak? government at the Centre.

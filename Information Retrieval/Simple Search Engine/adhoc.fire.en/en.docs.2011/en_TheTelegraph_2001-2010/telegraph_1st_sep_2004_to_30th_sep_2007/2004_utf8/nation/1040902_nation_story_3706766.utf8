 Eight child deaths a day, hospital cool

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, Sept. 1: Little bodies lay covered in white and the death count rose as the days passed, till it touched 274 at the end of the month.

 That was in July.

 The toll kept climbing over the next three weeks: 175 deaths, an average of eight a day.

 As the wail of anguished parents rose from the wards of Nilofuer hospital, the specialised institution for childcare in the Andhra Pradesh capital tried to shrug off the casualty rate as nothing unusual.

 The months in question are particularly high on a year-by-year basis in view of the seasonal changes and also flow of fresh water in the monsoons. These are months for proliferation of JE (Japanese encephalitis) and viral fevers that affect infants, said Dr M. Indrasekhar Rao, the medical superintendent of the referral government hospital.

 But Rao conceded that the hospitals 33.5 per cent casualty rate for neonatal and infant mortality was high compared to the national average of 27.

 On August 2, the hospital recorded the highest number of deaths in a day, with 13 infants succumbing to sepsis or asphyxiation.

 If Rao blames the season, parents of the children see the new Congress regime as the culprit. Ever since the Congress government took over, total neglect and indifference have taken root in the hospital, said Sailaja Mudiongda, from Guntur, who brought her eight-year-old child who was suffering from bronchitic pneumonia.

 Neither the doctors nor the nurses arrive on time and we, the parents of the sick ones, have to undertake cleaning of beds, wards and even the toilets often, she added.

 Moreover, the hospital, which also has an oncology department, did not have a medical superintendent for two months. Rao was appointed only recently.

 Another parent, Ramakrishna Reddy, whose child is being treated for cancer, said services in the hospital have been deteriorating ever since the Congress government cancelled the user charges. The hospital provides only bed and expert consultation. All the rest and medicines, except for basic ones, have to be bought by the patients relatives, he added.

 The previous Telugu Desam Party government had started the system of user charges in government hospitals. While the economically weak (holding white ration cards) paid Rs 10-20 for all consultations and medicines, those better off were asked to pay between Rs 25 and Rs 50 for every consultation, check-up or report.

 The deaths have prompted the National Human Rights Commission to order an inquiry. The panel cited reports in local dailies, which said 163 infants and newborns were among the dead. In a letter to the chief secretary, the NHRC has asked the Andhra government to file an affidavit before the high court within two weeks.

 Although Rao sees nothing abnormal in the death rate this July, the toll is much higher than what it was last July. In July 2003, the toll was 198 out of 786 admissions, the superintendent said, referring to a set of documents. In all, 2,954 children have died in the last 19 months, an average of 155 deaths a month.

 The superintendent said in a year, the hospital on an average takes in 160 patients daily. We handle nearly 20 deliveries, including six or seven serious ones. We are also treating five infant cancer patients.

 Despite his attempts to defend Nilofuer, there is no denying that the government was slow to react to reports on the deaths. Chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy, who holds the health portfolio, is yet to review all the hospitals and institutions under his care even three months after taking charge.

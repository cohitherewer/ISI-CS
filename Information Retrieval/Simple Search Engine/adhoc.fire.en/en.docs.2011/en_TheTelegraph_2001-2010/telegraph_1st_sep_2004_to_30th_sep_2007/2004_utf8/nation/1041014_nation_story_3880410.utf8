 Behind bonhomie, Pak puts visit speedbreakers

 PRANAY SHARMA

 New Delhi, Oct. 13: Pakistani authorities today prevented pilgrims heading to Jammu and Kashmir?s Chrar-e-Sharif shrine from crossing the international border at Wagah.

 India had granted permission to the group of 20 pilgrims, from Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, to cross over by road to visit the shrine. But sources said Pakistani Rangers prevented the pilgrims from crossing over at Wagah saying higher authorities had not cleared the trip.

 The incident comes barely a week after the ?successful? visit of 14 Pakistani journalists to Jammu and Kashmir. Observers think Islamabad is worried that regular cross-border visits will shatter the myth it has built up about the region over the years. Realising that the visit would go the way India would have wanted it to, policy makers in Pakistan are now hitting the brakes to slow down the normalisation process between the two sides.

 The pilgrims are not the first to be prevented from crossing the border. A Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry-organised ?Made in India? exhibition slated for October 1-10 in Lahore had to be called off because Pakistan did not grant visas. 

 Although a Ficci official sought to downplay the incident, saying the exhibition has been rescheduled for February-March, the refusal to allow people-to-people contact points to a growing Pakistani trend of slowing down the pace of interaction.

 A corresponding ?Made in Pakistan? exhibition was held here in March.

 Sources said the signals from Islamabad are very different from the spirit and cordiality it projects publicly. Even the number of visas it issues to Indians has dipped: the Indian high commission in Islamabad issues nearly 350 visas every day, but the Pakistani high commission here issues barely 25 to 30. Earlier, it was issuing at least 100-150 visas daily.

 A delegation from a fishermen?s federation wanting to visit Pakistan to free Indian fishermen from Pakistani prisons was also denied visas. Neither has Islamabad taken any steps to allow consular access to Indian officials to visit civilian prisoners in Pakistani jails even though Delhi has granted Pakistani officials such access.

 After the two sides completed their composite dialogue in August, India placed more than 72 proposals on confidence-building measures on the negotiating table. 

 Islamabad has until now agreed to talks on just a handful while keeping mum on more important issues like border trade, access to the Pakistan market for Indian goods and increasing flights between the two countries.

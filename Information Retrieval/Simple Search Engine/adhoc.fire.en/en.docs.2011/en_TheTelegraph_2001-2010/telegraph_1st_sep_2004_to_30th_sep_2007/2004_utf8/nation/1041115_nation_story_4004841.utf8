 Rabri mum as health suffers

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Nov. 14: As doctors refrained from performing their duties today, Bihar chief minister Rabri Devi sent out a series of greetings to the people but had nothing to say on the Diwali murder of a senior surgeon. 

 The doctors struck work in protest against the killing of N.K. Agrawal, who was murdered on Friday by suspected extortionists.

 The surgeon had sought police protection 72 hours before he was shot and had intimated the Kadamkuan police in the capital about the threat. He had even named jailed criminal Bindu Singh. 

 The police have since rounded up the wife, sister-in-law and two daughters of Singh while the in-charge of the police station has been transferred.

 There has been no word from the government on the worsening law and order situation in the city while the police have reacted on a case-to-case basis, hardly taking any step to improve the overall situation. 

 Estimates suggest that nearly 35 doctors have been kidnapped in Bihar over the past 15 years, of whom four have been murdered. Lawyers, businessmen and teachers who run coaching classes have also been a soft target for the criminals. 

 With health services of the state in a mess, a large number of doctors in Patna are known to have a roaring practice. Many of these doctors are on the government rolls but they prefer to concentrate on their private practice because it is more lucrative.

 ?Patna has always been known to be a fertile ground for doctors. Most of their patients come from the interiors of the state. We know it for sure that the biggest names in the city regularly pay rangdari to criminals to avoid any trouble,? said a senior doctor, who was a friend of Agrawal.

 ?We believe that Agrawal had refused to immediately pay up the money demanded from him and that is why he was murdered. Rarely does a doctor lodge a complaint with the police. Perhaps this information leaked out in his case. The threats have forced some senior doctors to migrate out of Bihar,? the doctor added.

 The local chapter of the Indian Medical Association claimed that the ?indefinite? strike was ?total? with more than 20,000 doctors not attending work. 

 ?We will not relent till the government books the culprits,? IMA general secretary Sahjanand Singh said.

 The situation at Patna Medical College and Hospital was critical with doctors keeping off work. The ongoing strike by the Patna Municipal Corporation has led to garbage piling up in the hospital area. A large number of clinics are also located in the same area where the situation was no better.

 A senior doctor said Agrawal?s killing was a clear case of lapse on the part of the police. ?It is good that the officer-in-charge has been transferred. But that is just like focusing on the symptom, rather than aiming at the disease. A crackdown is needed irrespective of the political patronage these criminals enjoy,? he added.

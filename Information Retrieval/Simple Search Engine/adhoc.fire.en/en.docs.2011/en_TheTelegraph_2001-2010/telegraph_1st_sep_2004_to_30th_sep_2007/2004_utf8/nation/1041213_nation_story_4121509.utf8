 Death-wish patient?s time running out

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, Dec. 12: In the sanitised silence of the special ward, the solitary clock ticked away. But the end the 25-year-old has been so desperately hoping for seems far away.

 In fact, every second is taking K. Venkatesh away from his last wish.

 Legal hurdles stand in the way of the terminally ill young man?s petition to Andhra Pradesh High Court for mercy killing and his wish to donate his organs even after a panel of state doctors recommended that they are fit for transplant. The high court had admitted the petition but tagged the request to a clearance from the panel.

 The committee, headed by Andhra Pradesh director of medical education Sai Gopal, has submitted its three-page report to the government. The government, in turn, passed on the report to the high court, state health secretary I.V. Subba Rao said.

 The high court has not yet given his verdict, but according to the law of the land, Venkatesh?s organs can be removed only after he is declared brain dead or dies naturally. However, doctors treating him at the city?s Global Hospital said Venkatesh ? who is afflicted with muscular dystrophy, a hereditary condition marked by progressive weakening and wasting of the muscles ? is also suffering from pneumonia and chances of brain death are remote.

 Even if Venkatesh dies a natural death, the doctors said clinically, there is no possibility of ?non-heart-beating? donations. 

 ?If one has to take away the organs after he is declared dead, all the time in the world we would have is just three to five minutes. Unless we can remove the organs within this period, there is no guarantee they will be useful and be infection free,? said Krishna Prasad, chief anaesthetist at the hospital.

 ?Venkatesh has an attack of pneumonia. If delayed, the infection will spread into the bloodstream,? said neuro-physician V. Sreekanth. ?His respiratory muscles are weak and he will require a ventilator for a longer time. And the longer the use of ventilator, the more are the chances of infection.?

 Venkatesh?s mother, who had filed her son?s mercy killing petition in Andhra Pradesh High Court, also realises that his wish may not be fulfilled. 

 ?In my son?s case, infection could start before death and his organs will not be useful if sepsis sets in. His organs are in good working condition now and my plea is that opportunity be made use of right now,? she said. 

 ?I have fulfilled all his wishes. This is one thing I am unable to attend to. I am helpless.?

 Venkatesh is aware of the controversy surrounding his request. When he is awake, his mind, oblivious to the din and bustle outside, tries to find ways to end the misery. Yesterday, he even gave a discreet message to his mother on a piece of paper, asking her to ?unplug me when none is around?. 

 The doctors, of course, do not want that to happen. A nurse now keeps watch over him round the clock.

 But Venkatesh is desperate. He has asked his mother to take him to the court. ?I will try to convince the judges,? he wrote to her.

 Dhaka fest scraps Ash film

 Aishwarya Rai in Chokher 

 Bali 

Calcutta, Dec. 1: Rituparno 

 Ghosh?s Chokher Bali was pulled off the opening day 

 menu for the 2nd International Film Festival, Bangladesh, 

 today. 

 The Bangladesh Federation of Film Societies cited a last-minute technical hitch for scrapping the period piece starring Aishwarya Rai, scheduled to kick off the fortnight-long festival at Osmany Smriti auditorium in Dhaka. But filmmaker Rituparno Ghosh and producer Mahendra Soni refused to buy the argument of the hosts.

 The Chokher Bali producers had sent the unabridged version of the film, which both Ghosh and Soni feel was the cause behind the withdrawal. ?Since the partition of Bengal forms the core of the film, there were a lot of elements on the two Bengals in the longer version. So I insisted that we take the director?s cut, which was screened at Globe cinema in Calcutta, as it would be of interest to the Bangladeshi audience,? explained Ghosh, who took a scheduled flight back home this evening.

 ?When we went into the auditorium, just before the inauguration around 12 noon, the organisers informed us that they had a 35-mm projector, and not cinemascope which was required to screen the film. They then offered to show a pirated DVD print. But I and my producer refused to go ahead,? added Ghosh. 

 When the Tollywood camp put its foot down, the organisers replaced it with Moloy Bhattacharya?s Teen Ekke Teen. 

 Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, who inaugurated the festival, was also keen to see Chokher Bali, said Soni, of Shri Venkatesh Films which has financed the movie.

 The Bangladesh High Commission could not be contacted.

 Both Ghosh and Soni feel there was more to the pull-out than the official technical-snag line. ?The Dhaka press today asked us if we had brought an uncensored version of the film. The media had reportedly been told by the festival authorities that they were not sure of the contents of the unabridged version,? said Soni. And this despite the Chokher Bali brochure mentioning that the film was in cinemascope and Dolby digital, he added.

 ?The organisers may have thought the unabridged version contains some objectionable matter,? added Ghosh, who felt ?the harassment could have been avoided had the Indian High Commission been a little more alert?. 

 India accounts for a high number of feature films at the Bangladesh festival, apart from a Tollywood package comprising Iti Srikanta, Alo, Swapner Din, Aabar Ashbo Phire, Bombaiyer Bombete and Waris. The Bollywood entries include Maqbool, Julie and Chameli.

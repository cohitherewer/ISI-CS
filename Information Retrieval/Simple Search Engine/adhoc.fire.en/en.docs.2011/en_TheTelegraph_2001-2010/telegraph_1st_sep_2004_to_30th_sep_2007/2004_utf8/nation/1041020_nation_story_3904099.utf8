 New Delhi, Oct. 19: Senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh sprang a surprise on the Left today when he asked it to choose between the Sixth Pay Commission and the National Employment Guarantee Scheme.

 ?It will be difficult to get the money for the employment guarantee scheme if the government goes on spending so much on its employees,? he said at a seminar on the scheme organised here by the Left-leaning cultural organisation, Sahmat.

 The finance ministry and the Planning Commission have expressed apprehensions about mobilising finances for the scheme that would cost anything between Rs 32,000 crore and Rs 40,000 crore a year. The Centre is to bear the cost.

 But state governments have to pay unemployment dole wherever they cannot provide jobs. Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has said it would be difficult for his government to meet the additional financial burden.

 Pointing out that the Fifth Pay Commission is already costing the governments Rs 30,000 crore a year, Jairam said: ?The finance ministry?s apprehensions will prove correct if the government is not able to sort out its priorities.?

 ?The parties supporting the employment guarantee scheme are also parties supporting the Sixth Pay Commission,? added the Rajya Sabha MP and former secretary of the Congress economic affairs department, now disbanded.

 Speaking after Jairam, CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury and senior CPI leader D. Raja said the employment scheme was not negotiable.

 ?It is wrong to link the Sixth Pay Commission to the employment guarantee scheme or to pit the organised worker against the unorganised worker. The government employees also have to work,? Yechury said.

 One of the criticisms against the Left parties and their trade unions is that they take up issues of white-collar employees and neglect the marginalised workers of the unorganised sector.

 Jairam went out of his way to rile the Left. He said he was ?surprised? to receive an invitation from Sahmat and that he favoured both liberalisation and the employment guarantee scheme. ?It would be wrong on the part of any party to claim monopoly over the scheme.?

 Raja took a dig at Jairam. ?He said he is an advocate of liberalisation. But Jairam should also go to the tribal areas to see what kind of misery the tribals are living in,? the CPI leader said.

 Later, in private, the Left leaders said Jairam?s remarks on the Sixth Pay Commission took them by surprise and they had no option other than to take him on.

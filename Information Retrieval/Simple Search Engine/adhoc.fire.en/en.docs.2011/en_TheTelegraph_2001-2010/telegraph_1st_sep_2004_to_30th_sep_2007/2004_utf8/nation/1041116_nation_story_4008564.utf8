 DNA pool push to hunt for criminals

 ALOKE TIKKU

 New Delhi, Nov. 15: The CBI is working towards an online database of criminals? DNA profiles that could be used to track them down in India or abroad.

 The initiative is part of a global move coordinated by the Lyon-based Interpol aimed at creating a DNA database to help investigators track down criminals. Launched by the Interpol secretariat in July 2003, the pilot project has already helped identify a suspect in Slovenia wanted for a series of thefts in Croatia.

 Security experts say the case is but a pointer to the potential that DNA profiling holds for investigators. But they add that India has a long way yet to reach that stage.

 A high-level team of officials, including CBI director U.S. Misra, is currently at the Interpol headquarters to find out about the training that Indian forensic experts will need in DNA profiling, cyber forensics, image analysis and detection of fake currency.

 India has seven forensic science laboratories with DNA profiling facility; an eighth unit is to be set up at the Central Forensic Science Laboratory here. Even so, it is recognised that India needs to keep pace with international developments for its data to be accepted internationally in police investigations and trials.

 During his stay in Lyon, Misra will push for creating a common protocol and database for efficient monitoring and formulating a strategy to use DNA profiling in crime investigation. He had pressed for this at an Interpol DNA Monitoring Expert Group meeting here earlier this year.

 DNA profiling has been used in court trials since 1989, mainly to shortlist suspects according to the evidence unearthed against them. It is also used to identify victims whose bodies have been mutilated.

 Officials said once the database is operational, DNA profile matches could be used to help investigators zero in on suspects just like police use fingerprint samples from crime spots to match them against fingerprints on their database.

 Officials said the CBI has asked the Centre to amend the Identification of Prisoners Act, 1920, that bars investigators from obtaining body fluids from suspects for DNA profiling without their consent. But it has been suggested that during the interim, forensic experts could build a DNA profile database of those convicted of serious crimes.

 An extensive database could make it difficult for criminals to change their identity to evade detection; it would also help the innocent avoid investigation.

 Interpol is focusing on DNA profiling and on linking the databases of more than 40 countries containing samples of over four million people.

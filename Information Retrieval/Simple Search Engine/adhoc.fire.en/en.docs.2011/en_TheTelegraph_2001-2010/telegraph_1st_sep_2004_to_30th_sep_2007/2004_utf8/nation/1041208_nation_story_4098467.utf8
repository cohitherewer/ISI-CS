 Jumbo terror in villages

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Dec. 7: A 

 herd of 25 wild elephants yesterday spread terror in villages 

 near Khurda town after straying from the Chandka sanctuary. 

 Khurda is barely 25 km away from here.

 The marauding elephants caused extensive damage to the standing paddy even as a crowd assembled nearby. As the people left no room for the animals to leave the place, it seemed for a few moments that the elephants would move right through the human ?barrier?.

 Forest officials had a tough time as they had to deal with the elephants as well as the agitated villagers.

 Residents of several villages, including Nuagan, Kumarbast, Mahulmajna and Haldia, said the animals spread terror in the region and caused damage to their kharif crop.

 A team of forest officials has been commissioned to keep an eye on the movements of the herd and take necessary steps to prevent any untoward incident, Khurda forest ranger Jitendra Kumar Mohanty said. The villagers have been advised not to do anything that might annoy the animals, he added.

 There are around 100 elephants in the Chandka sanctuary. Rapid agricultural expansion forces the elephants to leave the park area. Problems arise when they stray into human localities in search of food. 

 Elephant habitats and corridors are under tremendous pressure in Orissa on account of human encroachment. Human-elephant conflict has become a serious issue as people turn hostile in many places. 

 Elephants, more than human beings, have suffered. In the past five years, more than 100 elephants have been killed in the state due to poaching or electrocution.

 Since April 2004, 15 elephants have been killed in Orissa and most of the deaths were due to poaching.

 Wildlife activists allege that the government has done little to restore elephant corridors. ?The need of the hour is to contain the elephants in their habitats,? said Biswajit Mohanty, wildlife activist.

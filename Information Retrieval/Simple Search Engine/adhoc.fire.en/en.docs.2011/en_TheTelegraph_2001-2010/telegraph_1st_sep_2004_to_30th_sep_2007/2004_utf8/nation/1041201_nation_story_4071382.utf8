 Protest pangs for Naveen

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Nov. 30: The Orissa Congress will gherao the state secretariat here on December 17 in support of their demand for the resignation of chief minister Naveen Patnaik over alleged irregularities in the Tangarpada mining deal.

 ?Congressmen will gherao the secretariat as they feel the chief minister should take the responsibility for the ?indictment? of the government by the court,? said OPCC president Jaydev Jena. 

 A delegation led by Jena and Congress Legislature Party leader J.B. Patnaik submitted a memorandum to Governor Rameshwar Thakur in this connection. Criminal proceedings should be initiated against the chief minister, it said.

 Orissa High Court recently rejected the lease granted to Jindal Strips Ltd over 505 acres of land at Tangarpada in Dhenkanal district. 

 The high court set aside the decision of the state-owned Industrial Development Corporation of Orissa Ltd to select Jindal Strips as the partner for the exploration and development of the chromite mines at Tangarpada.

 The state Congress chief pointed out that after the December 17 demonstration in Bhubaneswar, party workers will gherao block offices across the state.

 The Congress, in consultation with other Opposition parties, will also chalk out a strategy to confront the ruling BJD-BJP combine in the winter session of the Assembly, which starts on December 3, he said.

 The party adopted a resolution at its state executive meeting on Sunday to expose the government over the controversial mining deals. It will also take out rallies in all blocks of the state.

 According to Jena, Patnaik has no right to continue as the chief minister following the high court?s judgment. Orissa Gana Parishad, CPI, CPM and Janata Dal (S) announced that they would stage a dharna in front of the Assembly on December 3. 

 ?If the chief minister does not quit, we will seek the sanction of the Governor to initiate legal action against him,? said former Union minister Srikanta Jena.

 The state executive of the Congress has also demanded the cancellation of the agreement signed between Vedanta Alumina and Orissa Mining Corporation to set up a 1 million-tonne plant in Kalahandi district. They have also demanded a CBI inquiry into the matter.

 Criticising the government for its failure to stop the distress sale of paddy, the state executive demanded the introduction of a system, whereby paddy would be purchased directly from farmers.

 Though reports of starvation deaths and sale of children have become regular, the government has failed to take any step to improve the situation, Jena alleged.

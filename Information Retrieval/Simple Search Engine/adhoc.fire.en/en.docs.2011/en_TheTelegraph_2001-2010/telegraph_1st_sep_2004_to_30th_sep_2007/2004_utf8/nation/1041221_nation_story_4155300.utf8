 EC frown cuts Laloo rally to size 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Dec. 20: Huge billboards and welcome arches began to be pulled down late this evening as Rabri Devi?s administration responded to an Election Commission order and Laloo Prasad Yadav built his defence.

 Earlier in the day, an FIR was filed against Laloo Prasad, accusing him of bribing voters for the February Assembly polls. The Election Commission moved against the Rashtriya Janata Dal leader after STAR News showed him distributing Rs 100 notes among women at Bihta on the outskirts of Patna.

 Although Laloo Prasad was far from apologetic for the act ? saying he was giving money ?merely for buying sweets? ? he chose not to provoke the commission. ?I respect the Election Commission. I welcome the EC?s directions to the chief electoral officer (of Bihar) to lodge a case.? 

 The commission has threatened to derecognise Laloo Prasad?s RJD for the offence. It is a threat the RJD is taking seriously. Sources said Laloo Prasad was closeted with senior leaders and legal experts through the day in wife and chief minister Rabri Devi?s residence. 

 Simultaneously, a reluctant administration started to remove the wave of signs that has flooded Patna for Laloo Prasad?s rally coming up on Thursday. Hundreds of billboards, welcome arches, posters, banners and festoons ? not to talk of graffiti ? have swamped the city.

 Existing ads ? for various corporate brands ? were peeled off to make way for Laloo Prasad with almost no protest. The only suggestion of protest came from the Bihar State Cooperative Bank, which filed a case against two RJD leaders for taking over its billboards. 

 An additional district magistrate supervising the dismantling on Election Commission orders said: ?It is an impossible task. In the past 15 days, more than 15,000 labourers continuously worked to put up the billboards and the gates. We are supposed to remove all these in a matter of few hours. That is just not possible, though we are doing our best.?

 The RJD has bragged that it would assemble one crore people at the rally.

 While choosing to stay clear of offending the commission in any way, Laloo Prasad said: ?The charge that I was bribing the women for votes or for coming to the rally is baseless. These women merely congratulated me on becoming railway minister and asked for money to eat sweets, as is the custom in Bihar. It is better that you ask them. Votes cannot be bought. But the NDA, which is on the verge of being wiped out, made a big issue of it.?

 It would be sweet music to the RJD leader that one of the women who was seen taking a Rs 100 note backed him up. ?Yes, he gave us money for buying sweets. Do you think our votes can be bought so easily? No, we want development and whoever is in a position to ensure that will get our votes,? she said.

 Some believe the charge of bribery will be hard to prove. A senior lawyer said: ?It has to be established that Laloo Prasad was actually bribing the people for voting for his party. The fact that he was not doing it as a candidate is also crucial. It would be difficult to establish that he was indulging in a corrupt practice.?

 Bus woes for Valley

 Srinagar, Dec. 9 (Reuters): Disappointment swept across Kashmir today after India and Pakistan failed to agree on starting a bus service between Srinagar and Muzaffarabad, residents said.

 ?These two countries are playing with our emotions, they are both stubborn. We are really disappointed because expectations are very high,? Mushtaq Ahmad, a shopkeeper, said.

 Kashmiris had pinned their hopes on talks between the rivals to try and resume bus services between Srinagar and Muzaffarabad. But Delhi and Islamabad differed on the nature of travel documents passengers would need after two days of talks that ended yesterday. More talks were needed, both sides said.

 PM push to Manipur probe

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 7: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is understood to have asked the army to do all it can to assist in the investigation into the killing of Thangjam Manorama, whose death in the custody of the Assam Rifles has sparked waves of protest in Manipur.

 Singh is likely to visit Manipur by the end of the month. Ahead of his visit, a senior official of the Prime Minister?s Office will visit the state possibly on November 9. 

 The Prime Minister?s word to the army comes despite the defence ministry maintaining that the army has cooperated in the investigation and that it had also volunteered to get the DNA samples of the Assam Rifles personnel tested to disprove the allegation that Manorama was raped.

 Army sources maintain that she was a covert operative of an underground militant outfit. The agitation in Manipur has since snowballed into a movement demanding the scrapping of the Armed Forces Special Powers Act.

 Last week, representatives of the 32-outfit front spearheading the agitation, Apunba Lup, met the Prime Minister and the home minister in Delhi. The Prime Minister was understood to have assured the Apunba Lup that he would ensure that justice was fair and fast. He is understood to have told the delegation that he himself is a father of two daughters.

 Sources also confirmed that the home and defence ministries had been asked to explore alternatives to the Armed Forces Special Powers Act. But the army and the defence ministry are staunchly against its withdrawal. Security forces argue that without the cover of the act, it will be difficult for the Assam Rifles to continue with its counter-insurgency operations in the state where about 30 militant outfits are active. 

 The Centre?s policy on Manipur can at best be said to be evolving with no clear-cut statement on where the talks with the Apunba Lup are headed. Part of the strategy is to play for time and expect that the agitation will run out of steam.

 On September 20, army sources said a unified command headquarters for Manipur on the lines of the one in Jammu and Kashmir was set up with chief minister . Ibobi Singh at its head. But since then, the authority has led a tenuous existence. All security agencies in the state had been asked to report to the unified headquarters but on the issue of the investigation, police and the army are apparently at odds.

 The word that the Centre will demonstrate flexibility on the Armed Forces Special Powers Act was put out after the creation of the unified headquarters even though army chief General N.C. Vij had given a presentation outlining, among other things, the difficulties of carrying out counter-insurgency operations without the backing of the act.

 Sources said the Prime Minister is likely to meet leaders of the Apunba Lup in Imphal during his visit that could be scheduled for November 21. 

 Despite the PMO?s interest over the situation in Manipur, it has been reported to the Centre that the army authorities had not yet handed over all details on the Manorama case to the state police. The continuing differences between the police and the Assam Rifles, which is officered by the army, puts a question mark on the functioning of the unified headquarters.

 Manipur chief minister Ibobi Singh and governor S.S. Sidhu are also understood to have discussed the army?s role in meetings with Union home minister Shivraj Patil.

 Army sources claim that they are confident that the 33 Assam Rifles personnel from its 17th battalion at the centre of the row cannot be directly implicated with the rape and murder of Manorama.

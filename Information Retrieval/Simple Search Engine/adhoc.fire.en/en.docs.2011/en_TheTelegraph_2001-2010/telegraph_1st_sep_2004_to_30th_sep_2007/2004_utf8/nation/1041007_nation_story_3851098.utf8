 Patna, Oct. 6: After lying low for a month, train robbers struck railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav?s home state yet again and looted a sleeper coach of the Jammu-bound Himgiri Express this morning. 

 Two members of the gang were caught by the passengers and residents thrashed them before they were handed over to the police. 

 The criminals, numbering around six, boarded the S-8 coach of the train at Luckisarai, near Mokama, on the Patna-Kiul section of Danapur division around 7.30 am. They attacked the passengers, most of them from Bengal as the train had originated from Howrah, with knives and brandished pistols when they resisted them. 

 Bihar?s superintendent of police (railway) Vinay Kumar said cash and valuables worth around Rs 2 lakh were looted from the passengers. 

 Three passengers suffered stab wounds when the robbers attacked them with knives while being chased after they attempted to escape near Hathidah railway station, he said.

 The two nabbed criminals, Sudhir Kumar and Luki Yadav, underwent treatment at Danapur railway hospital and are said to be in a position to give a statement. ?We have started questioning them,? Kumar said.

 The gang first boarded a local DMU train from Jamui. At Luckisarai, they got on to the Himgiri Express.

 ?The six gangsters initially boarded different coaches and inspected them. They zeroed in on S-8,? Kumar said. The loot began at Ashok Dham, near Luckisarai, and continued till Hathida. 

 ?At first, the passengers gave in. But as the minutes ticked by, some of them gathered courage and decided to resist the criminals. Sensing trouble, the gang pulled the chain and got down at Hathida. But the cries of the passengers alerted the local people who gave chase and caught two of the dacoits,? the officer said.

 Kumar said the police have started an operation to nab the other dacoits. 

 ?We have constituted a special task force consisting of rail police officials of different districts and launched raids in suspected areas. We will come out with positive results soon,? he said.

 The strike on the Himgiri is the third in the Jamalpur rail district in the last one month. The Patna rail district has witnessed a lull in similar incidents over the past three months. 

 However, railway authorities here feel there could be a spurt in track crime in the coming days due to the Dussehra festival.

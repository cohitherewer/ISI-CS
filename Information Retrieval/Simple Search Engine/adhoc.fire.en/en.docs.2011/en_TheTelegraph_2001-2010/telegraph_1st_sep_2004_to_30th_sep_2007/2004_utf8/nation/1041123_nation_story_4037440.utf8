 CISF seeks passenger pat

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 22: Five years into the assignment, the Central Industrial Security Force believes it has done a great job protecting Indian airports. Now it wants you to tell them that.

 For a fortnight beginning this week, passengers flying from 47 major airports will be asked to fill up forms in which they will have to rate CISF personnel on six parameters ? from the frisking before boarding to behaviour.

 The idea, said CISF director-general K.M. Singh, was to ascertain if the force ? which completes five years of airport security duties in February ? had come up to the expectations of passengers. The feedback would also help focus on areas that need improvement. ?We want to know where we stand,? Singh said.

 The one-lakh strong force was primarily raised to protect important installations and public sector undertakings. It was roped in for airport security after the 1999 hijacking of the Indian Airlines flight IC-814 to Kandahar. 

 Singh said the ?feedback? ? he expects more than one lakh passengers to fill the forms ? would give an ?objective picture?.

 Singh accepts that some black sheep may have escaped notice during the intense screening and training sessions that precede deployment. But he believes that what puts the CISF way ahead of others is that the force, trained to be courteous to passengers, is equally prompt in acting against deviant behaviour.

 An example of prompt action was the steps the force took against an inspector at Mumbai airport who was accused of stealing money from a businessman?s wallet during frisking. When a quick inquiry indicated that the businessman?s complaint might be justified, the officer was immediately suspended. A case was lodged against him and he was handed over to local police.

 Beginning February, Singh said CISF personnel at Delhi and Mumbai airports for frisking would stop wearing the traditional khaki and opt for the ?passenger-friendly? off-white shirts and brown trousers.

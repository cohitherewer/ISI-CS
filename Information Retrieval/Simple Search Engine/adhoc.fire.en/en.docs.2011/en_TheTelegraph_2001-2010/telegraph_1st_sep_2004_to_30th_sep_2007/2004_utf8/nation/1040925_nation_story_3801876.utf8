 Naidu eyes non-BJP friends

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, Sept. 24: Famed 

 for his long wish list when in power, . Chandrababu Naidu 

 today came calling on the capital seeking nothing more than 

 ?political protection? from the rights panel and some help 

 from ?secular? friends.

 Out of power in Andhra Pradesh and with five MPs in the present Lok Sabha against 29 in the previous, the former chief minister sought protection for his Telugu Desam Party workers, many of whom have died in alleged political murders.

 Once the spine of Atal Bihari Vajpayee?s BJP-led Centre, Naidu quietly began distancing himself from the ally after realising the partnership had cost him minority support in the Andhra polls, Desam sources said.

 A direct fallout is Naidu?s and Janata Dal (United) leader Nitish Kumar?s scheduled attendance at Devi Lal?s birth anniversary celebrations in Rohtak tomorrow. The only BJP leader Naidu visited is ?secular? Vajpayee.

 Political observers see this as another manifestation of the collapse of the National Democratic Alliance because the BJP has already snapped ties with the party of Devi Lal?s son, Om Prakash Chautala.

 Biju Janata Dal chief Naveen Patnaik and National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah, too, were supposed to attend the celebrations but called off their visit due to other engagements.

 Another BJP ally, ADMK chief Jayalalithaa, last week gave enough indication that she had distanced herself from the party and was going soft on Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and even her bete noire, Congress chief Sonia Gandhi.

 Naidu continued to be critical of the Congress because sources close to him said he had ?no choice? as the party was his main opponent back home. But he reached out to another potential ?secular? ally, the Samajwadi Party.

 ?Sonia Gandhi said the law and order situation in Uttar Pradesh has deteriorated. If she goes to Andhra, she will know what law and order is,? Naidu said, holding Andhra chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy and his Congress responsible for the alleged political murder of 35 Desam workers in the last four months.

 ?She does not know what is happening in Congress-ruled states and then to blame a non-Congress ruled state is bad,? Naidu added.

 He, however, did not foresee a realignment of forces in the immediate future.

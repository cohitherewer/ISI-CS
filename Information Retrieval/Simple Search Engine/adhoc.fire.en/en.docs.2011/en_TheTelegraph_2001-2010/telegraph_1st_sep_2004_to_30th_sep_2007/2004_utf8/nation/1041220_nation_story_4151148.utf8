 Sikh protest shuts play in Britain

 AMIT ROY

 London, Dec. 19: A play called Behzti (Dishonour), which is set in a gurdwara and ?depicts acts of sexual abuse, manipulation and murder?, was called off on Wednesday at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre when a large police presence was needed to prevent up to 400 protesters from storming the building.

 There have been angry rumblings for some time about the play, written by Gurpreet Kaur Bhatti, herself a Sikh, but on Wednesday matters came to a head when demonstrators tried to break into the theatre which is known as the Birmingham Rep.

 ?There were up to 400 people outside the theatre,? said a West Midlands police spokesperson. ?A large number of these made a concerted effort to get into the theatre and this caused damage and disorder.?

 None of the audience was hurt but a glass door was smashed. Five police officers were injured in the struggle and three persons were arrested for public order offences. Two were later released on bail pending inquiries and one cautioned as police tried to calm the tense atmosphere.

 Bhatti said threats had been made against her and she had been advised by the police not to say anything in public. 

 Wednesday?s trouble comes as the government seeks to introduce legislation to ban incitement to religious hatred, but this is being opposed as a bar on free speech.

 The row has certainly helped ticket sales. The Rep has announced: ?There are currently no tickets available for Behzti. However, we are operating a ?waiting list? system in case of any returns.? A police officer said: ?It is a sensitive issue. We have had discussions with the Rep theatre and members of the Sikh community.?

 He was unable to predict whether the play, which began on December 9, would be able to continue, as planned, until December 30. His tone seemed to suggest the police would be relieved if it was called off.

 The Birmingham Rep has certainly gone out of its way over the last decade to encourage new writing by Asians in an effort to attract more of the Indian and Pakistani community settled in the West Midlands. The latter are not traditional theatregoers, which explains why the Rep likes to have plays with Asian themes.

 The Rep?s biggest hit to date has been Ayub Khan-Din?s East is East, which was later turned into a successful film starring Om Puri.

 On this occasion, the writer, Bhatti, succeeded only too well in her attempt to raise awkward issues and be as provocative as possible. While the Sikh protesters will argue that her play, deliberately set in a gurdwara, mocks their religion ? and there appears to be considerable support for this view from Birmingham Council which partly funds the Rep ? others will insist the issue is one of artistic freedom.

 The managers of the Rep say they will continue to negotiate with the protest groups. It is understood that Sikh community leaders have been asked to meet the police.

 Earlier, Birmingham Council?s three main political parties said they were worried about the effects of the play after being contacted by Sikh leaders who wanted the setting changed from a gurdwara to a community centre. 

 Mike Whitby, a Liberal Democrat council leader, said: ?As a practising Christian, I understand how the portrayal of religious issues or a reference to faith in art or drama can cause offence. I would hope that arts organisations in this city would take into account the sensitivities of all our citizens when they plan their productions.? 

 Labour leader Albert Bore said the Rep should have known that by using a place of worship as the backdrop, the play would cause offence to the Sikh community and others who respect religious beliefs.

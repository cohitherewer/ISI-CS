 Tables turned on Naidu

 KAY BENEDICT

 New Delhi, Sept. 25: Andhra Pradesh agriculture minister Raghuveera Reddy today hit back at . Chandrababu Naidu who had yesterday petitioned the President and the human rights commission protesting ?faction killings? in the state. 

 Reddy said the present Congress government has set up a judicial committee to probe all political killings since 1989. 

 The move may put Naidu, the former chief minister, in the dock as the Telugu Desam Party was ruling between 1994-99 and 1999-2004 (April) when a large number of killings occurred.

 Nine hundred and seventy- one people were killed in political violence in the state between 1995 and 2004. Of these, 447 were Congressmen and 423 Desam workers.

 Between 1989 and 1994, when the Congress was in power, 390 people were killed in political violence, of which 190 were Congress workers and 132 were from the Desam.

 Fifty-two people were killed in just eight months this year, of which 33 belonged to the Desam and 19 were Congress activists. Anantpur in the Rayalaseema region is the worst hit, accounting for as many as 14 murders. The Desam bore the brunt with 12 of its men killed. The remaining two were Congress workers.

 Today, lambasting Naidu for taking up the matter with the National Human Rights Commission, Reddy said the Desam chief was indulging in double talk as he had shown no respect for the rights panel when he was chief minister. 

 Over 3,000 farmers had committed suicide in Andhra in the last four years and then leader of Opposition and now chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy had taken up the matter with the rights panel.

 The commission had appointed eminent lawyer K.K. Venugopal to look into the killings. In his report, Venugopal had held the Desam government responsible for the farmers? suicide.

 The rights body then prepared an action plan to pre-empt the suicides and offer relief to the victims? families. It directed Naidu to act on the plan, but he did not take cognisance of the directive, Reddy alleged. 

 He said the present Congress government is just four months old and needs time to take substantive action on such grave issues.

 Congress sources said the murders have nothing to do with politics. They are purely incidental and a chain reaction to killings sparked by local enmity. Cudappa and Kurnool districts have a 100-year-old history of revenge killings, they said.

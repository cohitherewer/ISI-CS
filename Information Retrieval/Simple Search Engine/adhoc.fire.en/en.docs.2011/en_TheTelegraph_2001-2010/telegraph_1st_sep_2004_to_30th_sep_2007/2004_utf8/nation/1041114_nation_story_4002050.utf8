The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Fewer troops too little for Pak

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Ahmed

 Calcutta, Nov. 13: While it has welcomed India?s decision to reduce the strength of troops now deployed in Jammu and Kashmir, Pakistan thinks it is not enough to take the peace process further. 

 Pakistan would like India to take some more steps ? such as allowing all Hurriyat leaders to visit Pakistan, releasing ?human rights prisoners? in Kashmir and coming clean on 1,000-odd ?missing? people in the state ? to win the confidence of the Kashmiris, Pakistan?s information minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed said here today. 

 Winning the confidence of the Kashmiris is the important thing, he said while talking to The Telegraph. Ahmed, who was here as the chief guest at the Indo-Pak cricket match, was of the view that no agreements between the two countries would resolve the Kashmir dispute unless it satisfied the Kashmiris. 

 He, however, denied that Pakistan was interfering with the deliberations of the All Parties Hurriyat Conference over talks with New Delhi.

 If Syed Ali Shah Geelani?s faction in the Hurriyat has dismissed the decision on troops reduction as a ?fraud?, the minister thought it reflected ?some feelings on the ground?. But Pakistan had ?no hand? in prompting Geelani to take such a hardline position, he added.

 Ahmed also repudiated the Indian charge on the terrorist infrastructure across the border. ?There are no camps for terrorists there (in Pakistan).?

 Asked what Pakistan could do by way of responding to the Indian decision on the reduction of troops, Ahmed said: ?What can we do? We?re already five or six steps ahead of India in creating confidence-building measures. We have done a lot on people-to-people contacts and in other areas. We now want the Kashmir issue to be discussed seriously.? 

 Pakistan, according to him, does not think that granting India the most favoured nation status could be part of the CBM between the two countries. ?Economy isn?t the issue. All issues, on the other hand, should be part of the composite dialogue with Kashmir at the core.? 

 Can Pakistan Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz announce some response to the troops reduction when he visits New Delhi on November 23 to formally invite his Indian counterpart to the Saarc summit in Dhaka in January? Ahmed indicated this was unlikely. Pakistan holds the outgoing Saarc chairperson?s post.

 On the contrary, Ahmed wanted India to seriously consider the recent proposal by Pervez Musharraf on dividing Kashmir into seven regions ? two in Pakistan and five in India, demilitarise them and allow them mandates to choose independence, joint governance by India and Pakistan or some form of UN rule. 

 Musharraf is ?serious? about the proposal. But the minister would not say if Pakistan planned to send the proposal to New Delhi officially. The President wanted a ?serious discussion? on it, he added. 

 India has said it would respond only if a formal proposal is made by Pakistan.

 India recognised three separate regions in Jammu and Kashmir ? Jammu, the Valley, and Leh and Ladakh.

 So which are the other two regions? According to Ahmed, Kupwara, Gilgit, Kargil and Ladakh could form the regions other than the three in the present Jammu and Kashmir. Musharraf?s division was based on ?ethnic and cultural factors?.

 Deuba faces security seal poser

Deuba: Tough task

 New Delhi, Sept. 5: New Delhi will seek a security guarantee from Kathmandu when Nepals Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba comes calling to India this week and asks for Indian commitment for a hydel power project in the Upper Karnali river.

 Nepal has been wanting to partner the Indian National Hydroelectric Power Corporation (NHPC) in the 300 mw project that will export power to India.

 But Indian authorities have been sceptical of the Nepalese joint venture partner, the Nepal Electricity Authoritys ability to raise funds for the project.

 The NHPC chairman and managing director, Yogendra Prasad, was scheduled to visit the site of the project, located some 670 km west of Kathmandu, on Friday. However, the chairman deferred the visit because of law and order problems.

 We have sought an assurance of security and transfer of land free of cost. Under those circumstances we may pick up 51 per cent equity in the project. The external affairs ministry will take up the matter, Prasad said here on Saturday. 

 The security guarantee can become a touchy issue for Nepal. In the past, Indian authorities have pointed out that they have taken up projects in Bhutan, for example, and ensured their own security for the Chukha station. But Kathmandu is sensitive because of domestic political criticism that it is surrendering to Indian interests. 

 The project is estimated to cost Rs 2,200 crore. The NHPC wants confirmation that the NEA will be able to pick up 49 per cent of the equity in a joint venture.

 The NHPC has also offered to take up the project on a build-operate-transfer scheme with the investment recoverable in 35 years. It has been assessed that power generated from the project can be used for distribution in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.

 The Powergrid Corporation of India Ltd, the public sector power transmission company, is also likely to become partner in the project. The corporation is expected to wheel the power from Nepal to the two states in India.

 The lack of movement on the Upper Karnali project mirrors the fate of several other India-Nepal projects that have been stuck because of mutual suspicion. 

 The Mahakali treaty was signed but never implemented. The Kosi High Dam project was proposed when Jawaharlal Nehru was the Prime Minister but has not yet been built.

 However, this time, the Nepal Prime Minister, eager to win support and influence in confronting domestic political crises, is anxious for Indian commitment to the project.

 For India, a commitment will be a financial gamble because the Nepalese Electricity Authoritys finances are in poor shape. 

 Nepal has now sent a draft memorandum of understanding that its Prime Minister will hope to sign but a compromise by the Indian authorities is necessary.

 Uma return sends Gaur to ashram

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Uma: Turn of tide?

 Bhopal, Oct. 25: Until yesterday, Madhya Pradesh chief minister Babulal Gaur was busy inaugurating bus terminals, promising Dubai-style gold souks in the state capital and attending cultural shows.

 However, within minutes of news of his predecessor Uma Bharti cutting short her 45-day Himalayan sabbatical became public, Gaur sought divine refuge in the Maa Anandmai ashram, praying, meditating and making offerings.

 Gaur made an unscheduled visit to the ashram at Bairagarh on the outskirts of Bhopal and spent an hour there. Devotees believe that Maa (1896-1982) or Blissful Mother had reportedly attained full self-realisation without the help of any guru.

 Gaur has reasons to be worried. Uma?s return to ?active politics? will have ramifications in her home state. The former chief minister is reportedly keen to take up the post of the BJP national general secretary in charge of Madhya Pradesh.

If L.K. Advani, the new BJP president, gives Uma what 

she wants, another claimant to the chief minister?s post, Shivraj Singh Chauhan, 

will return to Bhopal as state party chief.

 The emergence of the Uma-Shivraj combination is a possibility Gaur had been dreading since he took over as chief minister in August. At 74, Gaur fears that he may not be able to match the duo?s aggressive political postures.

 In the last 24 hours, Gaur has been sending feelers to the party leadership in Delhi, gently drawing attention to the BJP?s ?time-tested? practice of not assigning home state charge to party general secretaries.

 But the Uma camp countered the argument, citing the example of Rajnath Singh, who was given charge of Uttar Pradesh. Gaur?s supporters are not convinced, pointing out that Rajnath was assigned the state when the BJP was not in power.

 Until yesterday, Gaur was sitting pretty. Uma?s dramatic exit from state politics had helped Gaur rally around him many powerful former Union ministers like Kailash Joshi, Vikram Verma and Sumitra Mahajan.

 However, the BJP-Sena?s defeat in Maharashtra and Advani?s return as BJP national chief has altered power equations in the state BJP. 

 As if enjoying Gaur?s discomfort, the Uma camp is busy circulating reports on how Advani used satellite telephone to ?request? the sadhvi to end her ?yogic sadhna?. It is also being said that Uma was reluctant till her spiritual guru camping in Udupi in Karnataka persuaded her to heed Advani?s call.

 Uma supporters claimed she would join Advani?s new team, provided she is offered some role in Madhya Pradesh. ?The mandate was for her and she feels obliged to fulfil poll promises,? said a minister in the Gaur cabinet, still loyal to Uma.

 Cataract, asthma drove in last nail

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bangalore, Oct. 19: Veerappan dropped guard on Monday because he was suffering from a number of ailments, including failing vision, bouts of asthma and diabetes, according to top police sources here.

 The sources said the bandit had been desperate for medical attention for almost a year.

 Following a tip-off that he was suffering from cataract, the joint special task force had kept a watch on medical centres in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. 

 That he was suffering from asthma was evident from tablets found in the forests during joint combing operations. Veerappan, however, tried herbal medicines to treat the cataract as well as cure asthma.

 In November 2000, the governments of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka allowed Dr Bhanu to accompany Tamil activist P. Nedumaran during negotiations for the release of thespian Rajkumar. She treated Veerappan?s wounds and asthma as well as Rajkumar?s illness for a couple of days, and returned to the city along with the actor when Nedumaran succeeded in his mission.

 The sources said the brigand had trimmed his handlebar moustache in order to sneak out of the border region for treatment.

 ?In the past, he used to summon a doctor (from the border areas) or visit one without being noticed. This time, he accepted help from one of our informants for treatment in a hospital and boarded the ambulance. If he was on his feet, he would have given us the slip during the encounter,? the sources said.

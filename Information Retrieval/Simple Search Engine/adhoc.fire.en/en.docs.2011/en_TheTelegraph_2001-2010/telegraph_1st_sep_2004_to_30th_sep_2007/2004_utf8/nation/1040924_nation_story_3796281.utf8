The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Bengal on IT overdrive

 M.R. VENKATESH

 Chennai, Sept. 23: The Bengal minister for information technology, Manabendra Mukherjee, was on a hardsell campaign here to attract more IT investments into Bengal.

 Mukherjee?s personal interaction with IT industry leaders climaxed in a 20-minute t?te-?-t?te today with Wipro Corporation chairman Azim Premji, on the sidelines of Connect-2004, an Enterprise ICT (Information, Communication and Technology) event jointly organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry and the Tamil Nadu government.

 ?I won?t be able to mention the names of all the CEOs I met,? Mukherjee told The Telegraph here this evening. But the minister confirmed that he had met ? other than Premji ? Arun Jain, the chief of Chennai-based Polaris, a key player in the IT sector.

 Once Mukherjee?s formal programme ? to deliver the valedictory address for the session on e-governance ? was over, he continued his one-to-one meetings with IT industry leaders that he had begun yesterday, said a source close to the minister. Mukherjee would have met at least a dozen CEOs, but the official was reluctant to put a number to that exercise.

 ?When I met with the CEOs, the thrust of my discussions was how they can put Calcutta and Bengal on their future expansion maps vis-?-vis IT,? Mukherjee said. Bengal, the minister said, has ?human resources, infrastructure and a pro-active government?.

 Seven international delegations also participated in the event where over 100 exhibitors displayed their products. This included a contingent from Nepal led by its minister of state for science and technology, Prathiba Rana, and a team from Thailand.

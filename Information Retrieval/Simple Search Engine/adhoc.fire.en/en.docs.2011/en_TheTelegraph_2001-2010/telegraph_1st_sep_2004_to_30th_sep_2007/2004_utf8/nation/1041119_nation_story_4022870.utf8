 Ulfa seeks signed invitation

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Guwahati, Nov. 18: Barely 48 hours after writer Mamoni Raisom Goswami conveyed the Ulfa?s peace message to the Prime Minister, its chairman Arabinda Rajkhowa confirmed that the banned organisation was willing to begin a dialogue with Delhi if it was formally invited to do so.

 In an e-mail to the media, Rajkhowa made a case for a plebiscite on the contentious subject of ?sovereignty?. He said plebiscite was a democratic process and Delhi should accept the proposal.

 ?It is unfortunate that the state government has not paid heed to the Manab Adhikar Sangram Samiti?s demand for a plebiscite on the issue,? the militant leader said.

 Rajkhowa said the Ulfa was agreeable to peace talks in the greater interest of the people of Assam, but would come to the negotiation table only if Delhi sent a written invitation on ?the Government of India?s letterhead with a signature and the official seal?. He did not specify whose signature should be on the letter.

 Appreciating the efforts by Goswami to bridge the distance between the Ulfa and the political leadership, Rajkhowa said some people with vested interests were trying to sabotage her peace initiative by claiming that the outfit had agreed to ?unconditional? talks.

 He reiterated that no discussion would be possible without the outfit?s demand for sovereignty on the agenda. He described sovereignty as ?a right of the people of Assam? instead of mere demand by his organisation.

 Apart from Goswami, the militant leader was all praise for balladeer Bhupen Hazarika and actor Pranjal Saikia, who have said that the demand for sovereignty should find a place in the proposed discussions between the Ulfa and Delhi.

 Though the Prime Minister did not make any commitment to Goswami when they met on Tuesday, the writer said she was optimistic. ?I understand that he will have to find out a middle path after discussing (the issue) with experts. Without the sovereignty issue, Ulfa leaders will not come (for discussions).? 

 On whether the Ulfa?s demand for discussions on sovereignty might be a barrier, she said: ?The Prime Minister is very, very keen to find a solution as Assam is his own constituency.? 

 Goswami had met M.K. Narayanan, the special adviser to the Prime Minister, the previous day with an advance copy of the memorandum she submitted to Singh.

 The Ulfa initially placed three conditions for a dialogue: that it should be held in another country, under United Nations supervision and cover the subject of sovereignty. It later withdrew its first two demands.

 However, not all are convinced that the Ulfa is sincere about talks. An intelligence official said the outfit was ?buying time? by talking about negotiations.

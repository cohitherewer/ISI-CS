The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Blazing sun keeps tourists at bay

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 Agra, Sept. 27: ?Oh gosh, it is gorgeous, too gorgeous. You said it is 350 years old? I thought you have inaugurated this today,? says Joe Spencer, a 25-year-old computer specialist from Silicon Valley.

 Joe had gone to Bangalore for an assignment and was joined by girlfriend Maria in Delhi on his way back.

 ?We heard a lot about India?s Khajuraho temples and Jaipur?s places of interest but were told that those destinations would be hotter. So we opted for the Taj. We knew it is a symbol of love and mysticism. Seeing the Taj now, I can tell you we made no mistake by coming here,? Joe rattles off as Maria watches in a trance.

 Not many foreign tourists flowed in to see the monument to love on its 350th anniversary, despite a month-long campaign and goodwill visits to foreign countries by bureaucrats and ministers.

 It is almost as hot in Agra as in Jaipur and the blistering afternoon sun drove the few tourists into their hotel rooms. Only some like Joe decided to brave the heat to watch the monument in all its splendour.

 ?The tourist turnout may be low because of the heat and other factors, but we are hoping this situation will improve. The few foreign tourists who are here will carry back the message of the Taj to their country,? says Asit Goel, a tourism officer.

 ?When I came here this morning, I stood still for some time to take in the breathtaking view. Reality seems to have surpassed imagination,? says Ofer Erez, a 30-year-old engineer from Israel who was accompanied by his girlfriend.

 Both marvel at the effort put in by the 20,000 labourers to turn a dream into reality. ?This is an ode to the immortality of love,? says Erez.

 In the Taj complex, more than 200 professional photographers are busy using the celebrations to make a fast buck.

 ?Want to hold the Taj in your hand?? a 45-year-old photographer asks a tourist. ?Hold the Taj in my hand? How?? queries the bewildered German. The photographer then asks the tourist to stand on a chair and raise his hands and bend his wrist in a manner that makes it look as it the tallest tomb of the monument is hanging from his hand.

 The cameraman clicks and 30 minutes later shows the photograph to the German who smiles on having captured the monument for posterity.

 SC raps police on document leak

 New Delhi (PTI): The Supreme Court has 

 directed chief secretaries and directors-general of police 

 of all states and Union territories not to supply supervision 

 notes made by superior officers about those under investigation, 

 to prevent dilution of confidentiality.

 bench of Justices Arijit Pasayat and S.H. Kapadia in a recent judgment said: ?Supervision notes are not part of the papers supplied to the accused. Moreover, the informant is not entitled to a copy of the supervision notes.?

 The judgment came in a case where complainant Sunita Devi had challenged the anticipatory bail granted by a Bihar court to a person who had attempted to rape her. Both the complainant and the accused had cited the contents of the supervision note in their support.

 Justice Pasayat said the object behind supply of documents to the accused by the police was to enable the accused to defend himself properly. ?Supervision notes cannot be utilised by the prosecution as a piece of material or evidence against the accused. At the same time, the accused cannot make any reference to them for any purpose,? he said.

 The bench referred to many instances of unauthorised access to the police records by the accused who later cited the contents of the supervision note.

 Tips on fast-track justice

 Mangalore (PTI): Supreme Court judge 

 and chairman of the National Legal Services Authority, Justice 

 Santhosh Hegde, on Sunday said minor litigations could be 

 settled outside court by third-party intervention with the 

 help of elected representatives of local bodies.

 Dispensation of justice in the case of minor litigations to the common people is delayed because of the heavy pressure on the courts, he said.

 Justice Hegde called upon the elected representatives of panchayats, city corporations and municipalities to invoke legal awareness among the public. The authority was arranging free legal services to the poor and needy through state, district and taluk authorities, he said.

 Justice Navdeep Kumar Sodhi, chief justice of Karnataka High Court, said several statutes had become obsolete and needed to be struck down. With computerisation of courts, the day was not far when e-filing of cases would become a reality, he said.

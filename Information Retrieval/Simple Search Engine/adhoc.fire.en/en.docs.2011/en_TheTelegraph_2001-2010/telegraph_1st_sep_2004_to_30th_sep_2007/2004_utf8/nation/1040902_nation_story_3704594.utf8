 Mulayam spoils for varsity fight

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Sept. 1: Chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav is on a collision course with Raj Bhavan over the Urdu University Bill and introduction of English in schools in Uttar Pradesh.

 If the governor does not approve the bill, we will call a special session of the House to get it passed. There is no question of withdrawing the bill, Mulayam Singh said.

 The chief minister said a section of Congress leaders has been visiting governor T.V. Rajeswar Rao at regular intervals to stall the bill. We will advise the governor not to play into their hands, he said.

 Mulayam Singh alleged that the governor was consulting Delhi. This is not proper. We dont want any controversy to plague the bill. But if it is thrust on it (the bill), we know how to cope with it.

 The state government last month decided to table the bill to set up the Mohammad Ali Johar University in Rampur. A minister, Mohammad Azam Khan, was to be its lifetime pro-chancellor a new post of acting chancellor who would officiate in the absence of the chancellor. 

 Rao objected to the clause and wrote to the government. The Congress prevented the bill from being tabled. The government then drafted an ordinance and sent it to Rao.

 The governors call for reintroduction of English in school curriculum also came in for criticism. Mulayam Singh said: His statement on English on August 15 is also a slur on the nation. We can never dream of bringing English back. Enough of injustice has already been done to Hindi.

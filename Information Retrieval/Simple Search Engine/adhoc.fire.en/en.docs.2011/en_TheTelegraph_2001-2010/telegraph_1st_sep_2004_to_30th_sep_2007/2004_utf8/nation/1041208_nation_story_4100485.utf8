 Hurriyat strike on ?rights abuse?

 MUKHTAR AHMAD

 Srinagar Dec. 7: The moderate faction of the All Parties Hurriyat Conference staged a day-long hunger strike here to protest the ?worsening human rights situation? in the state.

 Around 400 activists of the moderate Hurriyat group, headed by Mirwaiz Moulvi Umer Farooq assembled at the Polo Ground this morning to launch the hunger strike.

 All members of the executive, general council and working committees of the Hurriyat, including chairman Umer Farooq, former chairman Moulvi Abbas Ansari, spokesperson Abdul Gani Bhat, Bilal Gani Lone, participated in the hunger strike. 

 ?Stop abuse to women and innocent killings,? one placard read.

 ?The human rights situation in Kashmir has deteriorated after the visit of the Indian Prime Minister and the home minister. Some elements are hell-bent on sabotaging the ongoing peace process aimed at finding a peaceful and permanent solution to the Kashmir problem,? Bhat said.

 ?We won?t tolerate the killing and molestation of our women. We want an immediate halt to human rights abuse,? he said.

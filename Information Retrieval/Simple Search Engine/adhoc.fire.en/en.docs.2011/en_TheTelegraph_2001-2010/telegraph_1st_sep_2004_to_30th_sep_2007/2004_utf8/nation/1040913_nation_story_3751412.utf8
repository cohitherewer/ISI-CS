 No work, no pay bill

 New Delhi, Sept. 12 (PTI): Peeved over the unprecedented level of disruption in Parliament, Rajya Sabha MP Fali Nariman has tabled a non-official bill to cut allowances of MPs for the period during which the House is adjourned and proceedings stalled.

 Ironically, the bill could not be taken up as Parliament was adjourned on August 22, a week ahead of schedule following the stand-off between the Congress-led alliance and the Opposition over ?tainted? ministers and other issues. 

 ?Many members were keen that I do it and I have done it... It?s the only way to stop this (frequent disruption),? the lawyer-MP said here today.

 Asked what effect the Disruption of Proceedings of Parliament (Disentitlement of Allowances) Bill, 2004, would have, given that it was a private member?s bill and has little chance of being passed, Nariman said: ?I don?t know the effect, but it (this trend) should be stopped.?

 Holding that MPs are representatives of the people and ?responsible? to them, the lawyer pointed out that ?their attendance and participation in the proceedings of the House is a public duty.?

 ?Accordingly, they must at all times be conscious of their responsibilities and endeavour to maintain the public trust reposed in them by performing their duties not only with honesty and integrity, but also with regularity,? Nariman noted in the bill.

 ?If proceedings of either House is disrupted and the House is not permitted to function and transact the notified business of the day, adjournments become inevitable and vast amounts of public money are needlessly thrown away.? 

 ?Actions of all branches of the executive also escapes vigilant legislative scrutiny due to valuable parliamentary time being lost and wasted in adjournments,? the bill said.

 Nariman has proposed that on the days that proceedings of either House is disrupted, individually or collectively by MPs, leading to adjournments ?with or without transacting business for the substantial part of the day... No member shall be entitled to any allowance for the day.?

 The presiding officers of the Houses ? the Lok Sabha Speaker and the Rajya Sabha chairman ? would be the deciding authorities and certify the dates on which the Houses had to be adjourned due to disruption, he said in his bill.

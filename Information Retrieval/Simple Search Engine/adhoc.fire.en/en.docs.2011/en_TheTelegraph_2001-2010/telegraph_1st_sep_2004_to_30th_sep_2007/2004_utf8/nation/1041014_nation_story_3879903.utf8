 Job scheme takes off 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 13: The Union cabinet today cleared a food-for-work scheme that will provide one able-bodied person in every family in the country?s 150 economically backward districts work for at least 100 days a year.

 The tribal belts of Orissa, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh will benefit the most from the programme which will cost around Rs 4,000 crore over the next six months.

 The employment scheme was cleared this morning at a cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. Union ministers were directed not to go public with any of the decisions taken at the meeting until polling in Maharashtra ended.

 Earlier, Singh said: ?The goal of this programme is to provide 100 days? employment to all able-bodied rural persons. The preparatory work has been completed and once the approval process is completed, we intend to launch it within the next few weeks.?

 The United Progressive Alliance government says the scheme will be converted into a nationwide rural employment guarantee programme. ?A draft bill on this subject has already been prepared by the National Advisory Council and is currently under examination,? the Prime Minister said.

 The government has allotted an additional Rs 2,020 crore for the scheme in the current financial year. It will focus on agro-processing, rural industries and informal sectors.

 Singh also spoke of generating employment for unskilled and semi-skilled labourers through huge investment in infrastructure. ?As creation of modern infrastructure is a top priority for our government, we expect this to translate into substantial job opportunities,? he said.

 The next part of the strategy will be to improve the skill level of the country?s 400-million workforce. The skill level is a concern, with the quality of manufacturing output and wages critically dependent on the quality of labour. Investment, particularly foreign direct investment, is based on the availability of quality labour. 

 The skill set will have to be upgraded substantially across all sectors to improve incomes, productivity and quality.

 The government is planning to increase investment in skills upgradation and vocational training.

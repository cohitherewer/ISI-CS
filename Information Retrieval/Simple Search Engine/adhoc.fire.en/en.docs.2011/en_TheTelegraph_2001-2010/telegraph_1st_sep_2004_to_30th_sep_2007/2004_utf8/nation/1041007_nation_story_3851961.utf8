 President prod for river link 

 SUJAN DUTTA

 Kalam

 New Delhi, Oct. 6: President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam today asked the Centre to send him updates on the previous NDA regime?s ambitious river-linking project and has prodded the UPA government into reviving the grandiose scheme to transfer water from surplus regions to deficit areas.

 The NDA?s constitution of a task force on the river-linking project at former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee?s behest had threatened to widen inter-state political chasms and provoked a public debate involving hydrologists, politicians and environmentalists. 

 Union water resources minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi today briefed Kalam. His briefing followed the President?s query to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on the progress of the project. Das Munshi is understood to have presented the steps being taken by his ministry to link the perennial snow-fed rivers of the north with seasonal rivers in the Deccan plateau.

 Water resources ministry sources, summarising the briefing, said:

 The National Water Development 

 Agency will complete feasibility studies of 30 links by 

 December next year

 A group has been set up 

 to evolve a consensus on the technicalities and a report 

 is expected by October 31 this year

 A presentation will be 

 made to the Prime Minister next week on the recommendations 

 of the task force, its advice and assessment

 Talks were being initiated 

 with experts for two priority links, one between the Ken 

 and the Betwa and another between the Kalising and the Chambal. 

 The governments of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh 

 were being consulted. Talks involving the governments will 

 follow secretary-level discussions

 An overall assessment of 

 states? views will be carried out from January next year

 The plan to link rivers is more than 30 years old. When the NDA regime revived it and appointed the task force headed by Suresh Prabhu to oversee it, concerns were expressed by states and environmentalists. Some called it ?quixotic?, others said it would be environmentally disastrous, but administrations in deficit river basin areas demanded it. 

 Internationally, it was questioned with Bangladesh raising queries on what the impact of transferring water through canals from northern India to southern rivers would be.

 The President was apparently asked about the programme during his recent tour to South Africa and he decided to find out about its progress. Kalam is understood to have pointed out that he has described the plan in his speeches as a ?dream? that would bring succour to water-scarce regions.

 In July, Das Munshi told Parliament: ?The central government envisages a comprehensive review of the feasibility of linking all the rivers of the country starting with the southern rivers in a fully consultative manner.?

 Within the ministry, there were murmurs that the project would be shelved. The common minimum programme of the UPA does not commit the government to the project. It was drawn up as an ambitious 35-year plan.

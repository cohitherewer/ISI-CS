The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Police posts shuffled

 Morena, Sept. 8 (PTI): The entire force in Ambah and Porsa police stations in the district have been replaced in the wake of a public outcry over police excesses that left three persons, including a BSF jawan, dead last week.

 ?The police headquarters has also been requested to conduct a CID probe into the entire incident,? inspector-general M.R. Krushna said today.

 The situation is returning to normality in the violence-hit Ambah-Porsa in Madhya Pradesh, where curfew was relaxed for 10 hours last night, Krushna said.

 Tension had gripped the area following the killing of the BSF jawan in an alleged encounter on September 3. Two persons were killed and five injured in police firing next day.

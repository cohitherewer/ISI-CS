 HC cracks cell call whip

 Patna, Dec. 13: Days after the unprecedented raids on jails in Bihar, Patna High Court today directed the Bihar inspector-general (prisons) to submit on Wednesday details of all calls made from mobile phones seized by the police and a plan to put a brake on crimes conducted from behind bars. 

 The court also asked all three mobile service providers in the state ? Reliance Telecom, Reliance Infocomm and BSNL ? to report before it on the same day the steps they take before issuing fresh connections.

 On December 8, the high court had instructed the Bihar government to raid the 55 prisons in the state and seize all articles ? especially mobile phones ? the inmates kept in violation of rules. The raids were conducted by Bihar Military Police personnel. 

 While the catch was limited to a few mobile phones and chargers, besides some ?pleasure? items like condoms and a VCD player, the seizure of a phone used by Madhepura MP Pappu Yadav from Beur Central Jail made stunning revelations. 

 The call list showed that Yadav had been making frequent calls to ministers and senior officers in the state.

 While hearing the Indian Medical Association (IMA)?s public interest litigation today, the court directed IG (prisons) Deepak Kumar Singh to submit detailed reports of calls made from the seized cellphones. 

 ?The court wanted to know what action has been taken after the seizure of cellphones. It also asked all mobile service providers in Bihar to explain the mechanism they use to verify the identity of subscribers,? Singh said.

 A division bench headed by Chief Justice Nagendra Rai observed that politicians with criminal antecedents are found in all parties of the state. It asked Singh to prepare a detailed plan to check crimes conducted by inmates of jails in Bihar.

 Singh admitted that some jail officers of lower rank are hand-in-glove with inmates and help them acquire banned articles like phones and drugs. ?We are in the process of identifying those jail officials who pander to the inmates for some reason or the other. We will give them exemplary punishment,? he said. 

 Advocate M.P. Gupta, who has taken up the case on the IMA?s behalf, said after last week?s prison raids, the government could act tough if it wanted to. 

 The court also directed the deputy inspector-general of West Champaran range to inquire into the allegation that a local superintendent of police had lodged a fake murder case against a reporter. 

 Earlier, a newspaper had carried a report on the failure of the police to take action after Manoj Mishra, a criminal lodged in Bettiah jail, allegedly made an extortion call to Narkatiaganj-based doctor Ranjan Kumar Deonath. 

 On November 25, the court had directed superintendent of police Paras Nath to immediately file an FIR in the case. But the police did not lodge a case before November 29. The DIG will now have to submit a report on Wednesday.

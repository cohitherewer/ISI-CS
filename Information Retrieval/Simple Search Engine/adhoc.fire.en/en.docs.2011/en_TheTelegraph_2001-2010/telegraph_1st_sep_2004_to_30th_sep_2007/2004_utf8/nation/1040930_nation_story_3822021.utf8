 Scam tussle in winter

 KAY BENEDICT

 New Delhi, Sept. 29: The Congress-led regime and the Opposition appear headed for a stormy winter session in the wake of the government?s decision to set up a group of ministers to probe ?cases of corruption? when the BJP-led coalition ruled.

 BJP strategists are now trying to dig out some land scam cases during Congress regimes since the sixties and have warned of a tit-for-tat reply. The United Progressive Alliance, they said, should focus on governance and ?aam aadmi? instead of being blinded by its ?RSS-BJP phobia?.

 To drive a wedge between Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi, the BJP has accused the Congress chief of masterminding the move against ministers in the earlier government.

 ?Manmohan Singh is a good man, there are some good people in the government. Some ministers want to do something, but super Prime Minister Sonia, the Leftists and the RJD coterie have tied their hands and they are feeling helpless,? BJP vice-president Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said.

 ?If a destructive government is expecting a constructive Opposition, it is wrong. If they start confrontation, we will not sit idle,? he added.

 Naqvi said his party would demand a probe into land allotments since 1960 and alleged that the Congress and the Nehru-Gandhi family have been major beneficiaries.

 If the BJP warned of retaliation, Congress spokesperson Jayanti Natarajan hit back, asking why the BJP was afraid of an inquiry. Welcoming the decision to set up the GoM, she said it was part of the party?s poll plank that it would unearth scams during the rule of the National Democratic Alliance and bring the guilty to book. ?Now they are in the Opposition and if they continue to stall the House, they will not even be in the Opposition after the next polls,? Natarajan said.

 As the rivals braced for another confrontation, a senior BJP leader said he has information that Sonia called defence minister Pranab Mukherjee and other ministers and asked them why they were sitting tight. She even scolded them, he claimed. ?It will boomerang on the Congress. They should remember 1977 when the Morarji (Desai) government harassed Indira Gandhi by setting up the Shah Commission and Indira Gandhi returned with aplomb.?

 The BJP wondered why a GoM would probe the ?so-called scams? instead of an investigative agency. Party sources said the Congress plan is not to book anybody but to use the propaganda for political mileage at a time when polls are due in some states.

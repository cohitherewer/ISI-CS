 Mishap spark to firing death

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Bhopal, Oct. 26: Communally sensitive Bhopal was tense after at least one person died in police firing following a clash between youths from different communities.

 Trouble erupted early in the afternoon in congested Shajahanabad, named after a begum who ruled the state in the early 19th century. 

 Eyewitnesses say a girl driving a car had a minor accident, prompting heated arguments among people belonging to different communities who had gathered at the site.

 Within minutes, the dispute turned physical. Some residents said today?s violence was the culmination of a simmering dispute over a cricket game that had been given a communal twist.

 When police reached the spot they were pelted with stones. Failing to quell the angry crowd, police began to fire. One person died on the spot while three others were seriously injured. Unconfirmed reports said two others died at a local government hospital. The dead man has been identified as Jai Prakash.

 Rumour mills worked overtime leading to panic in the city. Shopkeepers downed shutters and people fled offices in droves as tension mounted. Police cordoned off some areas and hunted mischief-mongers belonging to both communities.

 Municipal polls are to be held in Bhopal on November 20 ? the BJP hopes to dethrone the Congress after winning the December 2003 Assembly election in a landslide.

 Bhopal has a history of communal violence ? 142 people died after the Babri Masjid was demolished in December 1992, although unofficial figures place the toll much higher. According to the K.K. Dube commission of inquiry report, property worth Rs 9 crore was damaged in the carnage.

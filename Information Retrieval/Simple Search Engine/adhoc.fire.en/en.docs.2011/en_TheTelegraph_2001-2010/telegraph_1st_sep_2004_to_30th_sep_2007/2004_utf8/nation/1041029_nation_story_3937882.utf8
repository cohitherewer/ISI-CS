 Delhi ducks debate on Pervez dress 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 28: For the sake of the peace process, India has decided to sidestep the controversial stand taken by Pervez Musharraf to retain his dual posts and left a final decision to the Commonwealth.

 Pakistan was suspended from the Commonwealth councils in the wake of the 1999 military coup that brought Musharraf to power. 

 But this May, the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG) lifted the suspension on the understanding that Musharraf would give up his uniform by the year-end.

 ?The external affairs minister conveyed (today to visiting Commonwealth secretary-general Don McKinnon) that it was for the CMAG to take a decision concerning the uniform issue,? the foreign ministry spokesperson said.

 Pakistan foreign minister Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri took a potshot at the cool Indian response to Musharraf?s Kashmir peace proposals and said ?there will be no unilateral flexibility by Pakistan?.

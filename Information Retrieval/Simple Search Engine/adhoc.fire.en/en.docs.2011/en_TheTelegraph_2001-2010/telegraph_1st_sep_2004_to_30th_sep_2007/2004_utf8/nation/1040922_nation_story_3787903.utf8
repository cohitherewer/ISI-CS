 Evict order to NDA 7 

 New Delhi, Sept. 21 (PTI): Seven former Union ministers, including Ananth Kumar, Kanshiram Rana, Vinod Khanna and Jual Oram, have been issued eviction notices by the urban development ministry. 

 The notices were served as 14 ministers in the Congress-led UPA government are awaiting allotment of official residence, sources said. 

 The urban development ministry has made alternative arrangements for the former ministers as they are MPs. 

 The others who have been served eviction notices are Ramesh Bais, Ved Prakash Goel and M. Rajashekhran.

 Naxalites target talks sceptic

 KAY BENEDICT

 New Delhi, Oct. 26: Naxalites are upset with .K. Advani for opposing the Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy government?s talks with them in Hyderabad last week.

 They pointed out that as home minister in the NDA regime, Advani had sent interlocutor K. Padmanabhaiah all the way to Bangkok for talks with the outlawed National Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isak-Muivah group).

 ?If you can talk to NSCN extremists without any conditions, what?s the problem if the Andhra Pradesh government chose to have a dialogue with the PW (which merged with MCC on September 21 to form the CPI-Maoists)?? asked a Naxalite source.

 Advani, who takes over as BJP president tomorrow, had condemned during his visit to Hyderabad on Sunday the ?soft policy? of the state and the Centre towards Left extremism. After meeting former chief minister Chandrababu Naidu, the BJP leader said he would ask Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to stop the Andhra government from continuing the talks. The Naxalite problem cannot be solved by any one state alone, he said, adding that it needs coordinated handling at the national level.

 Naidu shared Advani?s concern over the Congress-led government ?undermining internal security? by talking to the Maoists.

 Advani also alleged that the Naxalites had helped the Congress win elections. The Naxalite source said they were at a loss to understand the change in the BJP?s attitude because the party?s state leaders had welcomed the talks.

 Countering Advani?s allegation that Naxalites supported the Congress in the elections, a source alleged that it was the BJP that took NSCN (I-M) support in Nagaland in the 2003 elections.

 Apart from condemning Left extremism, the source said Advani and Naidu discussed the successive Left victories in Bengal and wondered how the Marxists have retained power for 27 years, beating anti-incumbency.

 Advani pointed out land reforms as a positive feature of the Left Front government but added that the Marxists were adept at rigging, a Telugu Desam source claimed. ?Their cadre is skilled in election management,? he quoted him as saying.

 Although the Bengal government distributes land, allottees are not given possession documents, Desam sources said. The land records are kept in the local CPM office to keep the villagers in a tight grip and ensure they do not stray.

 The former deputy Prime Minister told Naidu about the Left parties? skills in ?manipulating voters? lists and deleting names of those who they suspect might vote against the CPM?, the source added.

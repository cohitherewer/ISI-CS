 Patna, Dec. 16: It?s not a billboard war, It?s a sheer ?grab? ? Rashtryia Janata Dal style.

 Someone, at last, has dared to raise a voice against RJD leaders, who have painted all prime billboards in the capital green to announce that the Kisan Mazdoor Maha Raila is scheduled for December 23.

 By now, larger-than-life images of party president Laloo Prasad Yadav and chief minister Rabri Devi are staring down from almost every nook and corner of the city.

 The protest, expectedly, has not come from any of the corporate houses, whose billboards were transformed overnight into messages for the rally. But, unexpectedly, from an organisation, whose ultimate control lies in the hands of the state government itself.

 The Bihar State Cooperative Bank ? a rare success story in languishing Bihar ? has lodged a case with the chief judicial magistrate against two RJD leaders for ?grabbing? at least two of its billboards in the capital.

 The bank has also dragged the advertising agency concerned for not preventing Patna Water Board chairman Ashok Yadav and councillor Abha Lata from using its hoardings to announce the rally.

 All billboards carry the names of the ?nivedak? (RSVP of sorts) in bold and these are the people who are supposed to have borne the expenses of the hoardings in question. 

 The names of Yadav and Abha Lata are displayed on the billboards near Gandhi Maidan and Rajvanshi Nagar, which had been booked for the cooperative bank.

 The companies whose billboards have been taken over are too reluctant to protest. ?We have to do business in the state. We are not interested in inviting trouble for such small reasons,? an official with a mobile phone service provider said.

 Sources in the bank said they approached the court for filing the case because ?police stations are hesitant to lodge such reports?. 

 While most hoardings with public health messages have been taken over by the RJD leaders, a couple ? which call for polio vaccination ? have been spared the paint job. However, RJD banners could be seen in front of a couple of such hoardings near the railway station.

 The advertisement agencies are also tightlipped. ?We know it is wrong. But we will get the hoardings back after the rally. So, we do not want to land in trouble,? a representative of one such agency said.

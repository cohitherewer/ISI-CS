 Cong rises to Patil defence, finally

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Oct. 14: At best, the Congress? media establishment maintained an indifferent silence as Union home minister Shivraj Patil came under attack over his handling of the sensitive Manipur issue. 

 But within two days of the Left parties expressing satisfaction with Patil?s work, the Congress high command is believed to have asked the party?s media wing to pull up its socks. Earlier, the Left had criticised the Manmohan Singh government?s handling of the situation in the Northeast. 

 If the party?s publicity arm needed to familiarise itself with the initiatives taken to promote peace in sensitive regions, be it Manipur, the rest of the Northeast or Jammu and Kashmir, Patil was there at the 24 Akbar Road Congress headquarters this morning. 

 Patil, a former chairperson of the media department, spent almost two hours with functionaries of the publicity wing, their predecessors and party spokespersons, ?briefing? them on the situation in Manipur, Assam, Nagaland and Jammu and Kashmir. 

 Media department chairperson Girija Vyas later told reporters Manipur was fast returning to normal. 

 Quoting Patil, she said except total lifting of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, the government had met all other demands of the agitators in Manipur. 

 Barring Manipur and to some extent Assam, the entire Northeast was peaceful at present, she said. 

 After the ?briefing? by Patil, Vyas said the government was taking forward the dialogue in Kashmir to restore peace and normality. 

 The dialogue was also on with Islamabad. ?Pakistan too has realised the futility of perpetrating violence,? she said. 

 Besides Vyas, those present were former chairperson of the department Ambika Soni, now an AICC general secretary, spokespersons Abhishek Singhvi, Jayanti Natarajan, former spokespersons Salman Khursheed, Kapil Sibal and Satyavrat Chaturvedi and general secretary Janardhan Dwivedi.

 Death wish stalks cyclone-scarred

 Erasama (Orissa), Oct. 21: Don?t get taken in by the calm facade of Renubala Patro?s house. Or by the still waters of the pond in her courtyard or the picture-perfect paddy crop swishing gently in the breeze.

 A storm has been brewing in the supercyclone widow?s mind for five years now. Finally, in January, she gulped a full bottle of crop pesticide but survived because a neighbour in her Hanagotha village and some NGO workers ferried her to a local hospital in double-quick time. Then in June, she again attempted suicide but a well-wisher rescued her.

 Five years after the October 1999 super-cyclone, the death winds are still raging inside the minds of hundreds of survivors in Erasama. Many are victims of post-traumatic stress disorders like restlessness, flashbacks, sleep disturbances and reduced activity. Others are plagued by guilt that they survived and their loved ones didn?t and are not interested in living any more.

 So far, about 59 survivors have committed suicide and many more, like Renubala, have tried and failed.

 Renubala was uprooted from her happily wedded life in Kunjakothi village after the cyclone claimed her husband. For the sake of her two young daughters, she shifted to Hanagotha, built a house and deposited the Rs 75,000 she got as compensation in a bank.

 After a while, she sent her daughters to her mother?s house so that they could go to a better school. Then, out of loneliness, she befriended a neighbour who used to visit her off and on. Some time ago, the neighbour?s wife got suspicious and picked a quarrel with her. In desperation, Renubala tried to end her life.

 On sedatives now, and sleepy most of the time because of them, her only question is: ?What is there in life??

 Renubala?s story has unfolded in adjacent villages also, though with variations. In Sarabapatho, 42-year-old Sandhya ? who lost her husband and two daughters ?used to live with her surviving 16-year-old daughter Kuni, but could not come to grips with the tragedy. She was depressed most of the time.

 A year ago, Kuni hanged herself after a quarrel with her mother. This year, Sandhya doused herself in 5 litres of kerosene and set herself ablaze.

 ?She used to feel that there was no point in living as there was no one to protect her,? said Shital Kumar Palbaboo of Sneha Abhiyan, an NGO initiative of Action Aid India.

 The horror of supercyclone suicides came to light two months ago when the Bangalore-based National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences (Nimhans) and Sneha Abhiyan conducted a survey of mental health problems in Erasama. Over 80 per cent of the 10,000 cyclone deaths in Orissa were in Erasama.

 ?The morbidity level is too high. It seems as if a part of their life has died,? said S.P. Swain, consultant psychiatrist of the Cuttack-based SCB Medical College. 

 Swain and K. Sekhar of Nimhans studied the mental condition of over 15,000 survivors in 11 gram panchayats of Erasama. They were astounded that 11 per cent of the people expressed the death wish.

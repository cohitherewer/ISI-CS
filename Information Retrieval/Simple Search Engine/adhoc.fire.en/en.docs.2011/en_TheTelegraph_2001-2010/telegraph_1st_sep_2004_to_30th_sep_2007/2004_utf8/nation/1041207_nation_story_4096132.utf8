 Opp. takes Naveen case to governor

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Dec. 6: In a bid to mount further pressure on Orissa chief minister Naveen Patnaik, non-Congress Opposition parties today met Governor Rameshwar Thakur and submitted a memorandum demanding his nod for the BJD chief?s prosecution in view of the high court?s judgment in the Tangarpada mines case.

 The Opposition leaders, led by Orissa Gana Parishad president Bijoy Mohapatra, alleged that a crisis has engulfed the state, whose chief minister continued to ?bluff? everyone, including the governor and the judiciary. The Opposition camp comprising the OGP, CPI, CPM and Janata Dal (Secular) alleged that Patnaik has termed the verdict ?baseless?.

 ?We implore you to act expeditiously in restoring the rule of law in the state,? they urged the governor.

 ?If Vedanta is a scandal, then the Tangarpada mines deal is an outrage. The court has severely castigated the government and made several telling comments such as ?adopting double standards?, ?showing undue favour? and ?non-application of the mind?. It has also accused the government of sacrificing the interests of the state. The nexus was exposed after the government failed to produce even the Industrial Policy Resolution in the court,? the joint memorandum said.

 Referring to Patnaik, the OGP chief said a person who tries to take the governor for a ride and challenges the judiciary is a threat to the well-founded principles of parliamentary democracy and the rule of law.

 While the Congress continued with its protests inside the state Assembly, Speaker Maheswar Mohanty warned that if matters did not improve, he would be forced to run the show without the presence of the Opposition.

 Crusader lawyer shot

 VISHVENDU JAIPURIAR 

 Hazaribagh, Sept. 5: Criminal lawyer Prashant Sahay, who specialised in fighting cases against the high and mighty, was gunned down at a nursing home here this afternoon.

 The 41-year-old lawyer was about to start his Fiat around 12 noon, when two youths walked up and shot him from point-blank range. Seven bullets were pumped into his head, face and the chest. 

 Sahay, the grandson of former Bihar chief minister K.B. Sahay, had contested this years Lok Sabha election as an Independent from Hazaribagh against then external affairs minister Yashwant Sinha. He did not win but ensured Sinha did not either by eating into his votes.

 The lawyer was fighting several high-profile cases, including one related to an alleged fake police encounter by a senior IPS officer. He had recently filed a habeas corpus case against the IPS officer, accusing him of kidnapping the widow of Naxalite Umesh Ojha, whom he had shot allegedly in a fake encounter. 

 The officer is facing an inquiry into the mysterious disappearance of Rs 80 lakh seized from extremists during operations in April 2000. 

 There were allegations that the police had seized Rs 85 lakh from some rebels. But the policemen reportedly deposited only Rs 5 lakh with the government.

 Hours before his death, Sahay told this correspondent that he would continue fighting cases against big people till he breathed his last.

 He said he knew many people were plotting to kill him, but he would fight on. 

 A lady gynaecologist, who was with Sahay, said two men in their twenties came up to the lawyers white car, whipped out pistols and shot him.

 Film licence leash on cable

 New Delhi (PTI): Delhi High Court has restrained major cable operators and distributors from broadcasting the film King of Bollywood which has Om Puri in the lead role.

 ?The MSOs (multi-service operators) are restrained from telecasting or exhibiting the film ? King of Bollywood ? on their cable television network without obtaining licence or written authorisation from the producers,? the court said.

 The cable operators who were stopped from showing the film are Siticable, Hathway Cable, In Cable and Win Cable, including their distributors. 

 A law suit filed by Idreams Productions and Bollywood Limited, the producers of the film, said they were apprehending unauthorised telecast through pirated copies as has been witnessed in the past.

 Advocate Chander M. Lall, appearing for the producers, sought copyright protection contending that the cable operators in the past have shown pirated copies of films, disregarding the Cable Television Networks Regulation Act as well as the Telegraph Act and Wireless Act.

 Edusat placed in orbit

 Bangalore (PTI): India?s educational 

 satellite Edusat has been placed in a near geosynchronous 

 orbit.

 This was achieved after the third and final orbit-raising operation conducted from the Indian Space Research Organisation?s master control facility at Hassan in Karnataka, Isro said on Sunday.

 The manoeuvre was completed by firing the liquid apogee motor on board the satellite for a duration of two minutes and 15 seconds on September 24, Isro?s statement said.

 With this operation, Edusat, launched on September 20, has achieved an orbital period of 23 hours and 46 minutes and is continuously within the radio visibility of the master control facility, Isro said.

 20 hurt in train mishap

 Alibaug (PTI): At least 20 people were injured after 10 coaches of the Ernakulam-Okha Express derailed following soil slippage due to heavy rains. 

 The derailment occurred between the Karanjwadi and Diwankhavti stations, under Konkan railway, at 7.26 pm on Saturday. 

 Several trains on the Konkan route have either been diverted or cancelled following the derailment.

 NRI arrested

 Moga (PTI): A 60-year-old NRI has been arrested on the charge of murdering his neighbour. Police in this Punjab town have also seized a double-barrel gun which they believe was used by Jagir Singh to kill Ajit Pal Singh. Ajit was allegedly shot by the NRI on Sunday morning when he went to Jagir?s house to complain about the din he was making in the neighbourhood.

 Flight grounded

 Chennai (PTI): An Indian Airlines flight bound for Kuala Lumpur was grounded at the international terminal here shortly before take-off past Saturday midnight due to a technical snag. The 215 passengers were asked to alight, the airport sources said.

 Kalam visit 

 Dehra Dun (PTI): A day before President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam visits here, a strike by sanitary workers all over Uttaranchal has made life miserable with heaps of rubbish littering the capital?s roads. Over 6,000 workers went on strike from September 23 demanding a wage hike, among other things. Kalam arrives on Monday and would take part in a number of functions in the city. An embarrassed government is trying to clean up at least those routes through which his entourage will pass.

 Witnesses silent 

 Morena (PTI): No a single witness turned up before the subdivisional magistrate probing the death of three persons, including a BSF jawan, in police firing earlier this month. SDM D.K. Kumhan was in the town of Porsa on Friday and at Ambwah on Saturday to probe the matter. But no witness turned up.

 Singers Pankaj Udhas and Anup Jalota are on a fund-raising mission in Chennai for cancer cure, foetal care and education. They will perform at a concert to raise funds for this purpose.

 Women?s bill pushed back at UPA meet

 MONOBINA GUPTA

 New Delhi, Nov. 27: The women?s reservation bill received short shrift at the United Progressive Alliance?s coordination meeting last night despite being listed at the top of the agenda.

 Most leaders were reluctant to discuss the subject and it was only after more than two hours had elapsed since the 6-pm start that the first item on the list was discussed.

 ?Clearly not too many present at the meeting were interested in discussing the bill. It was 8.30 when the discussions actually began on the official agenda,? a Left leader said.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh spoke for four minutes, not on the bill but more generally. UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi spoke for a minute next before alliance members hijacked the meeting and spoke about everything but the reservation bill.

 Jharkhand Mukti Morcha chief Shibu Soren spoke at length about the condition of tribals in his state, with Singh listing out the measures his government has planned to help them.

 Union railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav made a late entry and demanded to be made part of the UPA-Left coordination committee. Light banter followed.

 Nobody seemed to be in a hurry to get down to the listed business. CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan drew Sonia?s attention to the first item on the agenda but alliance members had their own ideas.

 People?s Democratic Party MP Mehbooba Mufti spoke about Kashmir and the positive impact Singh?s recent visit there has had on the people.

 Laloo Prasad then held forth on the coming Jharkhand elections and the need to defeat the BJP.

 Telengana Rashtra Samiti chief K. Chandrasekhar Rao spoke about statehood for Telengana once again. He had already met the Prime Minister earlier and been promised a formula. Singh announced that a committee was being set up to examine all aspects of the demand.

 With the clock having ticked well past eight, Bardhan had to again draw Sonia?s attention to the listed business. The CPI general secretary asked her to initiate a discussion, but was told there was nothing new to add. The Congress? position on the bill was well known, the UPA chairperson added.

 Laloo Prasad then spoke once more, this time to oppose the reservation bill. He said the Singh government must try and reach a consensus before passing the bill.

 CPM general secretary Harkishen Singh Surjeet and Bardhan said the Centre should pass the bill during the winter session of Parliament but the others seemed to be in no hurry.

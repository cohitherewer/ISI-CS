 Youths on rampage on Patna greens 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Nov. 28: A group of youths went on the rampage at Patna Golf Club this morning after it was denied entry.

 According to sources, the club is scheduled to host a national golf tournament from December 1 to 5. 

 ?We closed the premises to the public from today till December 6 so that we can make the preparations to conduct the tournament smoothly,? a club spokesperson said.

 Hundreds of people visit the sprawling club premises in the Patna zoo area on Bailey Road every day to exercise. Of late, candidates for the post of police sub-inspectors have also been practising there.

 This morning, a group of youths saw that the main gate of the club was closed. The enraged youths, along with the sub-inspector aspirants, forced their way in and an altercation with the club staff followed. 

 The youths refused to see reason and turned violent, damaging windows, doors, flowerpots and other items. Witnesses reported that most of the club employees fled and the mob set fire to the main gate and the guard?s cabin. Some of them even blocked the road and damaged vehicles.

 Police intervened and fought a pitched battle to disperse the crowd. ?It took the police more than an hour to control the situation and disperse the stone-pelting crowd. They had to lob teargas shells as well,? a witness said.

 Later, some employees of the club filed an FIR at Sachivalaya police station. ?We have registered a case and are looking into the matter,? a police official said.

 The club?s course captain, Roshan Sharad, said the management did not do anything illegal by announcing the closure of the premises. ?We will not be able to conduct the tournament if we keep the club open to the public. The announcement was made on time as well,? the captain added.

 But the youths said they have nowhere else to go to practise for the police test. 

 ?We have been practising here for almost two months. But today we saw that the place was out of bounds. Where will we go now? We are not allowed to use the Bihar Military Police grounds also,? said Ramashish, a candidate.

 The staff members said managing the daily crowd is a big problem. ?We find it hard to get the youths out on time,? a guard said. 

 Only four days ago, another group of candidates went on the rampage at the police control room (headquarters) here when the department suddenly stopped receiving application forms. 

 The enraged youths, who had been standing in the queue for a long time, turned violent and damaged several vehicles.

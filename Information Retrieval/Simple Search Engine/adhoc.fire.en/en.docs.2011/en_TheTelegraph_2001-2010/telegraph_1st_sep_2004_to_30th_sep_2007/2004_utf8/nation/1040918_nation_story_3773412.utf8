 New Delhi, Sept. 17: The CPM politburo today began the exercise of putting together a political resolution that will decide its strategy for the next three years.

 The new resolution, which will guide the CPM on how to deal with the Congress and the United Progressive Alliance government, will be adopted at the party congress scheduled for the first week of April.

 Some believe the CPM is walking a tightrope on its relations with the Congress, especially with Bengal and Kerala ? both CPM strongholds ? going to Assembly polls in 2006. 

 At the last party congress in Hyderabad in 2002, the CPM?s political resolution had categorically given a call to defeat the BJP and the ruling NDA. But it had also warned about the Congress? economic policies. 

 ?The Congress stands for the same economic policies that it initiated in 1991,? the Hyderabad resolution had said. However, it added, that the CPM should adopt tactics that will help all ?secular and democratic? forces defeat the BJP-RSS combine. 

 The party is expected to stick to the same formulation in its new resolution. On one hand, it will explain why the CPM should continue supporting the UPA government. On the other, the party will keep up its criticism of the Congress? economic policies. 

 The resolution will also caution the Congress against continuing the NDA?s liberalisation policies. 

 CPM leaders say the tenor of the party?s criticism of the Congress will depend on how much it is able to influence the UPA?s economic policies. The test lies in the stand the coalition will take on its row with the Left over FDI cap, provident fund interest rate, World Bank appointments and exim policy.

 There is already an opinion growing among the CPM cadre that the party is not getting its due. ?There is a feeling this government is not heeding the Left?s concerns? even when we are keeping the Manmohan Singh government in power,? a Left leader said.

 The CPM in Bengal and Kerala will be in a spot trying to explain its support to the Centre if the UPA does not give in to at least some of its demands, party leaders say.

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 Mulayam: Minority card

 Lucknow, Nov. 30: Continuing his sops for Muslims, chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav today got the controversial Maulana Jauhar Urdu University Bill passed in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly.

 The bill was passed despite governor T.V. Rajeswar Rao objecting to some of its provisions.

 The tabling of the bill kicked up a storm in the House, with the BJP opposing the legislation and the Congress saying it was opposed only to the provision that made parliamentary affairs minister Mohammad Azam Khan the university?s lifetime pro-chancellor.

 Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh retorted that the Congress was colluding with the BJP on the issue.

 Rhetoric on appeasement of Muslims followed as well as a spell of language politics pitting the validity of learning Arabic and Farsi against the culture of ?English speaking brats ignoring ground realities?.

 The Bahujan Samaj Party, which had earlier walked out over a different issue, remained absent. 

 The CPI, which has hitched its secular wagon with the Samajwadi Party, also opposed the creation of a lifetime post for Khan.

 There are 14 universities in India where Urdu, Arabic and Farsi are taught but these have more teachers than students. Even so, the Uttar Pradesh ruling party launched the battle for the Urdu university bill last August by drafting an ordinance which Rao ? who objected to the provision making Khan pro-chancellor for life ? refused to sign.

 After some dithering, the Samajwadi Party decided to table the bill in the Assembly. Its message to Muslim voters is clear: the Mulayam Singh government has done its bit and it is up to the governor now to sign the bill.

 After coming to power last year, the ruling party decided to shut government schools on Fridays only to backtrack following protests. 

 Last August, it formed a Madarsa Board to put madarsa education on a par with mainstream education and then moved the university bill as part of its sops for Muslims.

 Today, the Samajwadis called the tabling of the bill proof of their ?hard secularist stand?. 

 The Congress, also looking to woo Muslims who account for 19 per cent of the state?s population and can tilt the balance in 130 Assembly seats and 34 Lok Sabha constituencies, termed the move ?a desperate but fraudulent bid of the SP (Samajwadi Party) to hold on to its Muslim votes?. The BJP described the tabling as ?a divisive gesture?.

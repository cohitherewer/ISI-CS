 Kashmir guest control in place

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Srinagar, Nov. 4: The controversial guest control order will take effect from tomorrow with consumer affairs minister Taj Mohi-ud-Din refusing to buckle under pressure from locals chefs, the Wazas, who are spearheading an agitation for rescinding the law. 

 The government issued the order on October 26, restricting the number of guests at marriage functions and the quantity of mutton to be served at such functions. 

 It stipulates that not more than 200 people, including 50 from the groom?s party, can attend a marriage. The quantity of mutton to be served at the marriage must not exceed 100 kg. During the engagement ceremony, the limit is 25 kg. 

 Weddings in recent times have been ostentatious and lavish affairs, where even middle class families would serve between five and seven quintals of mutton to guests numbering several hundred. 

 The Ashpazan Union, an association of Kashmiri chefs, recently protested by burning shawls awarded to them for excellence in cooking the tasty Kashmiri feast, Wazwan, and began an indefinite boycott of marriage functions. 

 ?We are on an indefinite strike to protest against the order,? said Naseer Ahmad Mir, the chief organiser of the union. 

 ?This (the order) is not acceptable to us,? Mir said. 

 ?I don?t know why the government is not taking steps to stop the scourge of dowry which has been a great concern for parents of girls in Kashmir. 

 ?I don?t know why the minister is harassing us by enforcing the new guest control order. Everything was going smoothly and suddenly they have imposed these restrictions,? he added.

 Beauty queen held

 A beauty queen was today arrested and five others booked for being allegedly involved in flesh trade and the production of pornographic CDs in Jammu.

 The city police registered an FIR against Miss Jammu Anara Gupta and the others for offences under the Cinematography, Immoral Trafficking and Information Technology Acts. 

 Cable operators Narinder Kohli and Jagdeep Kaur and three other girls have been booked.

 Gupta?s arrest follows a week-long investigation by the crime branch in Jammu.

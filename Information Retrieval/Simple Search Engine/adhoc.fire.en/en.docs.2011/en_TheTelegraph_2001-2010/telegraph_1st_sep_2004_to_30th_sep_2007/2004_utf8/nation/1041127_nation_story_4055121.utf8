 J amp;K security net to stay

 ALOKE TIKKU

 New Delhi, Nov. 26: The reduction of troops in Jammu and Kashmir at Prime Minister Manmohan Singh?s initiative will not disturb the counter-insurgency grid.

 Government sources said a decision had been taken within the security establishment before the withdrawal started not to touch the crucial component of the security set-up in the state that conducts pro-active operations against militants.

 ?The deinduction exercise will not impact counter-insurgency operations which will continue as before.... There will be no reduction of troops in this area,? a senior government official said.

 The hint was that the security forces were wiser after the operation to flush out Pakistani forces during the Kargil conflict.

 Back then, operational requirements to ?dilute? the counter-insurgency grid by way of moving forces to the Kargil sector had led to a temporary void in the security set-up.

 As a result, emboldened militants attacked isolated posts. Also observed was an increase in infiltration attempts, which the army had linked to the redeployment.

 A comprehensive review of the counter-insurgency grid will be conducted in the middle of next year in the context of the emerging situation. If the situation improves further with the onset of summer, the security establishment could reconsider its decision not to disturb the grid.

 At this stage, however, it is being pointed out that the government could not afford to leave holes in the security set-up despite lower infiltration from Pakistan as training infrastructure there had not been dismantled, old camps were being revived and new camps opened.

 A home ministry document released recently had put the number of training and transit camps in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir at 47, besides another 10 camps in the northern areas ? a fact that signals Pakistan could decide to turn on the tap at a later stage.

 Sources said the current withdrawal would largely involve additional troops ? ?some under the category of reserve forces, others had not been moved out after Operation Parakram? ? that were not required in the state.

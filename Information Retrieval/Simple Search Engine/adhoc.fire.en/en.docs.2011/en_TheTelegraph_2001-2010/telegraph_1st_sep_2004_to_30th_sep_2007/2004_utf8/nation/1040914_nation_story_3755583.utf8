 Delhi fires rebel salvo at Dhaka

 - Home ministry directly links Bangladesh authorities to militants

 New Delhi, Sept. 13: Days before the Indian and Bangladeshi home secretaries meet in Dhaka, Delhi issued a strong statement, accusing its neighbour of providing ?logistic support? to militants and expressing concern at the country emerging as a transit point for arms routed to insurgents. 

 Delhi has been articulating its disappointment with Dhaka for not acknowledging insurgent camps on its soil and taking action against them, but this time it has directly linked ?Bangladesh authorities? to the militants. 

 The home ministry statement said these two would be the ?priority issues? in the talks between the home secretaries beginning Thursday. Bengal home secretary Amit Kiran Deb would be part of the team, which will also include representatives from the Border Security Force and the foreign ministry.

 Rajiv Aggarwal, the joint secretary in the home ministry, said home secretary Dhirendra Singh will also ask his Bangladeshi counterpart about investigations into a huge cache of arms seized at Chittagong this April.

 India suspects the consignment was meant for insurgent groups operating in India, including Ulfa. 

 ?They had assured us that they would apprise us of the investigations but have not shared any information so far,? Aggarwal said. The official added that Dhaka would be asked to detail the steps taken to ensure that it does not become a transit point for arms smugglers. 

 The Indian delegation will also enquire about action taken on the list of 195 insurgent camps and leaders that had been submitted by the BSF earlier this year, insisting that the evidence and details given were sufficient for the authorities to proceed against the groups. 

 The Centre would also seek consular access to about 500 Indians jailed in Bangladesh on various charges.

 Home minister Shivraj Patil admitted the government does not expect a forward movement on all issues, especially the Northeast insurgent groups. But he is hopeful the talks would end with some positive results for both sides. 

 Some of the areas where Delhi expects progress relates to erection of a fence within 150 yards of the zero line. At many places along the Indo-Bangla border, it was not possible to erect the fence beyond 150 yards due to human habitation very close to the zero line. 

 Aggarwal said this was discussed at the meeting between the BSF and the Bangladesh Rifles and a decision was left to the home ministries. 

 Delhi is also seeking relaxation of a clause mutually agreed upon that bars any defensive building within this 150-yard area. ?This has held up work on some development work in some places,? he said.

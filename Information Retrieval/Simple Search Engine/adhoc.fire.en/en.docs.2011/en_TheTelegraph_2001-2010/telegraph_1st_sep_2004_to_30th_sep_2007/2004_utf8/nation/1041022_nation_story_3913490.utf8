 Hyderabad, Oct. 21: Senior leaders of the Communist Party of India (Maoist) and the Jana Shakti left for their hideouts yesterday after the first-ever direct peace talks with the state government.

 The Naxalite leaders, who were in the Andhra Pradesh capital for a week, were escorted by state police for 210 km from the capital. The rebel leaders had been given ?safe passage?, police sources confirmed last evening.

 Maoist supporters who thronged the state guesthouse raised radical slogans as the convoy of 15 vehicles ? including the maroon Tata Qualis carrying the leaders ? left. Before leaving, Naxalite leader Ramakrishna invited journalists to visit them in the forests. ?We will give you good food and also a good copy, though there may not be a Nescafe or filter coffee,? said his rebel escort Padma.

 As the rebels were leaving for the jungles, chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy urged them to give up armed struggle. ?The government cannot support their anarchy. Institutions and systems have to be respected,? Reddy said.

 The chief minister said the Naxalites have seen that problems can be resolved through talks. ?Everything may not be to their satisfaction. But the government will not lag behind in attending to the real problems of the people,? he said.

 However, the relatives of some police personnel killed in Naxalite ambushes were unhappy over the grand treatment given to the rebel leaders. ?When my husband was kidnapped in the Adilabad forests and detained for 12 days, they did not even give him proper food. But they were enjoying ice cream and sweet dishes almost every night,? said 37-year-old Pushpa, whose husband, Gopalaswamy, was kidnapped in Visakhapatnam eight years ago.

 The Manjeera Guest House on Begumpet road had dwarfed the neighbouring Grand Kakatiya Sheraton, since the Naxalite leaders arrived here. The state government had set aside an entire floor and created a separate access as well as a kitchen for the rebels. ?Almost 300 men, many of them armed, were deployed for the security? of the Naxalite leaders, according to director-general of police S.R. Sukumara.

 The rebel leaders received almost 1,200 visitors during their stay. ?They addressed around 20 meetings since they left the forests,? said Maoist emissary P. Varavara Rao.

 The relatives of the leaders also called on them. Ramakrishna?s mother, cousins and nieces called on him twice and Jana Shakti leader Amar met his wife Vimala on Tuesday after four years.

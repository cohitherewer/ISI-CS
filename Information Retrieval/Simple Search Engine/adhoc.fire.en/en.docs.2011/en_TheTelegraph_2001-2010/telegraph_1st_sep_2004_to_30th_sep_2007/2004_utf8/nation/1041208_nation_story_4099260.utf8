 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 7: Union minister for water resources Priya Ranjan Das Munshi has asked a task force to submit a report on the flood and drought situation in the country by the end of the month and said the government was moving towards promoting ?private-public partnership? in water conservation.

 Speaking at a session on infrastructure at the India Economic Summit jointly organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry and the World Economic Forum here, Das Munshi said his ministry had also set up a committee to work on increasing groundwater availability. He said the committee would seek to promote rainwater harvesting. An allocation had been made from the budget for the purpose.

 Das Munshi said the ministry had taken up 105 pending projects under an accelerated water supply scheme.

 CPM talks tough on policies

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 1: The CPM today talked tough to the government even though it made it clear that withdrawing support to the United Progressive Alliance government was not on its cards.

 ?We do not accept the idea that the UPA government should carry on with its core liberalisation policies while the Left will only raise issues on employment and education,? said CPM politburo member Prakash Karat.

 He was addressing a news conference on the decisions of the central committee meeting, which ended yesterday.

 The UPA government, notwithstanding the Left?s opposition, seems to be proceeding steadily ? though a bit haltingly ? with its economic agenda. 

 The CPM is virtually opposed to each of these policies whether it is with regard to FDI in telecommunication and insurance, divestment of public sector shares, reduction of the interest rate of provident fund or giving concessions to foreign banks.

 Finance minister P. Chidambaram is fast becoming the Left?s bete noire. He has adopted a conciliatory approach towards the Left but at the same time signalled that he will not back off easily.

 ?The central committee expressed surprise at the eagerness with which the finance minister facilitated the takeover of Indian private banks by foreign banks,? said Karat.

 ?We do not agree with the government?s understanding that FDI can only come into the country through concessions to foreign capital.?

 ?We are not in the business of running the government on a day-to-day basis. But the UPA government must work within the framework of the common minimum programme,? said Karat. The CMP is a document that materialised after elaborate discussions between the Left and the Congress on many policies on which they do not see eye to eye, he added.

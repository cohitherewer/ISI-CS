 IIM suicide, on camera

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY 

 Lucknow, Sept. 23: Bir Kariya Sikri Hansda watched a film in a friend?s room till 2 am. Then the 22-year-old IIM Lucknow student returned to his room ? no. 506 ? of hostel no. 5 and switched on his laptop. 

 He surfed websites on suicide methods till around 2.20 am. At 2.30, he set up a webcam, stripped and hanged himself. His naked body was found hanging from a nylon cord thrown over a ventilator shaft in his room around 7 last evening. On the screen flashed a hazy picture of Hansda, standing without anything on. 

 The meticulous planning, reconstructed after collating data from preliminary investigation and the post-mortem report, has stumped police, authorities and his friends. 

 ?We have seized his laptop, the webcam and a lot of other documents which could help us understand what prompted him to take this extreme step,? said a police official. 

 Students said Hansda was last seen at 2 am. There was no response to a knock on his door at 10.30 am and a couple of calls. When he did not open the door till 4.30 pm, they alerted the authorities. 

 Since the news broke on the Sitapur Road campus, about 30 km from here, last evening, everybody is in shock. ?We never had this kind of an unfortunate incident before in Lucknow. We are shocked,? said dean Bharat Bhaskar. 

 Knots of students were seen discussing the incident in hushed tones. This morning, the students held a condolence meet. Classes were cancelled. 

 ?He was a bright student. We were hoping he would do well. His suicide has come as a major shock,? said Devi Singh, director of IIM Lucknow. 

 Hansda, an engineering graduate from the National Institute of Technology in Rourkela, his home, was among the top 25 students of his batch. His teachers recalled the cumulative grade point average of the second year student is above 6.5, which put him in the bracket of brilliant students. 

 Hansda, his friends said, was reserved. ?He was good though a little introvert. He was sensitive, innovative in his thinking,? said a classmate. 

 His parents are at a loss. ?He was normal when he visited home at Rourkela last week,? police quoted Rupai Hansda, Kariya?s father and senior operator in the Rourkela Steel Plant, as saying. Rupai has left for Lucknow. 

 Ajha, Kariya?s sister, said in between sobs over phone from Rourkela that the suicide was difficult to believe. 

 Hansda?s NIT teachers said he never came across as mentally weak. ?A mentally weak boy surely can?t crack the IIM entrance in the first attempt,? said Dr J.K. Satpathy, head of the electrical department.

 Computer deal ?fraud?

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Dec. 10: Police are on the lookout for a duo who have allegedly cheated several youths of around Rs 7 crore.

 Sambit Kumar Jena and his assistant Kaustav Singh, owners of Elix Computers in the posh Sahid Nagar area of the city, allegedly collected security deposits from a number of people and struck business deals with them for data entry jobs. 

 But neither did the two men provide the jobs nor did they make the payments promised. 

 Both the accused come from respectable families. While Jena?s father is a retired OAS officer, Singh?s father is a former chief district medical officer.

 Maintenance

 New Delhi, Oct. 5 (PTI): The Supreme Court has upheld a Gujarat trial court order, increasing the monthly maintenance to a Muslim woman from her estranged husband.

 The order ? that could well become a trendsetter ? was given last week while dismissing a petition filed by the husband challenging a Gujarat High Court ruling that had also upheld the rise in the maintenance amount from Rs 500 to Rs 2,244.

 However, the apex court modified the trial court order and ruled that the enhanced amount should be paid from March 1, 2003, instead of May 9, 2002 as directed by the trial court.

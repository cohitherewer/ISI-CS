 BJP pulls off price traffic stopper

 New Delhi, Dec. 1: Thousands of BJP activists and workers led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee and L.K. Advani held a massive rally here today and courted arrest to protest the increase in prices since the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance came to power last May.

 The rally ? the BJP?s first show of strength since the Lok Sabha polls ? was a traffic stopper as around 35,000 workers poured into the Ram Lila grounds from various states and spilled into adjoining areas. Be it Narendra Modi or Babulal Gaur, all BJP chief ministers had a point to prove. The capital had not witnessed a BJP rally of such magnitude even during the elections. 

 Senior party leaders Murli Manohar Joshi, Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, Shivraj Singh Chauhan and M. Venkaiah Naidu addressed the rally. They were joined in courting arrest by Arun Jaitley, Vijay Goel, Shahnawaz Hussain, Pramod Mahajan, Arun Shourie, Jaswant Singh and Yashwant Sinha.

 As Vajpayee and Advani along with hundreds of workers shouted ?Congress jab jab aayee hai, kamar tod mehengai layee hai (Congress rule means crippling price hikes)?, they were detained by police at the Ambedkar stadium that was converted into a temporary jail.

 Vajpayee, who needed a hydraulic lift to reach the 20-metre-high dais, took the Congress-led government to task. Addressing the crowd from his chair, he dripped sarcasm. ?The government which has made water such a big issue is not able to find solutions to other problems.? 

 On the day that the Sheila Dikshit government?s four-fold hike in water tariff took hold, Vajpayee recited poet Rahim?s couplets on the significance of water.

 The former Prime Minister made a dig at Congress chief Sonia Gandhi for having dismissed his government?s plans to achieve a growth rate of 8 per cent as ?Mungeri Lal ke haseen sapne?. 

 ?I am surprised that Soniaji knows about Mungeri Lal. We do dream but we also know how to turn it into reality. While the NDA government had started with a growth rate of 4 per cent, we had decided to make it 8 per cent. We achieved it,? he said.

 Advani told the crowd: ?Inflation was a problem that even (then finance minister) Yashwant Sinha faced. But we did not let it affect the country.? He referred to the economic sanctions imposed on India after the Pokhran nuclear tests and the economic difficulties in the wake of the Kargil war, two cyclones and the Gujarat quake, adding that the NDA had managed to rein in prices.

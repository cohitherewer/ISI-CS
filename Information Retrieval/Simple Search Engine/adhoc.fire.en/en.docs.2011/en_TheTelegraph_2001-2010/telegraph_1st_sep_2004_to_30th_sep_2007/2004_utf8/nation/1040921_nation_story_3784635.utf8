 Blow to Shah punishment plea

 Mumbai (PTI): Bombay High Court on Monday 

 dismissed the plea of the Maharashtra government seeking 

 enhanced punishment for film financier Bharat Shah, who 

 was convicted last year by a special court for failure to 

 disclose information to police about the underworld.

 Shah was sentenced to one year?s rigorous imprisonment but was released as he had already spent 15 months in prison during the trial. 

 He was charged under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) for allegedly forging links with the underworld.

 The police had relied on audio tapes of alleged conversation between Shah, producer Nasim Rizvi and underworld don Chhota Shakeel. But in the trial it failed to establish Shah?s voice in the alleged talk.

 The court decided to hear Shah?s appeal against his conviction later. Shah has challenged his conviction on the ground that it had left a stigma on his career.

 Other appeals filed by the state, challenging Shah?s acquittal and seeking enhanced punishment for Rizvi and his assistant Allah Baksh, would also be heard together by the high court.

 The Shah case had attracted countrywide attention as film personalities, including Shah Rukh Khan, Salman Khan, Preity Zinta and producer-director Rakesh Roshan, had appeared as witnesses.

 Fake-killing court martial

 Jodhpur (PTI): General court martial 

 proceedings against Major Surinder Singh, whose ?prima facie 

 culpability? has been established on ?some of the charges? 

 in the Siachen ?fake killings? case, will begin here on 

 Tuesday.

 Singh, against whom a court of inquiry has recommended disciplinary action, will be facing court martial trial at the headquarters of the signal unit of Jodhpur cantonment near here, defence sources said on Monday.

 The army, on September 17, had ordered a general court martial against Singh for alleged ?faking of encounters? in Siachen. A seven-member jury has been constituted for conducting the court martial proceedings, sources said. As a prelude, a summary of evidence was recorded between May and August this year in a military court here.

 Singh, serving as company commander of 5/5 Gorkha Rifles deployed in Siachen, is alleged to have ?enacted fake killings? of enemy troops and ?cooked up? video shots in support of his claim to get a gallantry award.

 Delhi govt restrained

 New Delhi (PTI): The Supreme Court has 

 upheld a high court ruling quashing a Delhi government notification 

 to acquire land for an annual festival, ?phool walon

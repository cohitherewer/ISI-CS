 Pak women for Punjab games

 GAJINDER SINGH 

 Chandigarh, Nov. 30: Brushing off objections from fundamentalist forces, the Pakistani government has given the green signal to its women athletes to take part in the East-West Punjab Games in Patiala beginning Sunday.

 Chief minister of Pakistan?s Punjab province Pervez Elahi, the prime mover behind the unique sporting encounter between the two Punjabs, had requested the government for permission. The idea was mooted at a meeting here between Elahi and his Indian counterpart Amarinder Singh in September.

 ?The information that we have at the moment is that over two dozen women would be coming to participate in the games. This would, perhaps, be the first time that (Pakistani) women athletes would be participating in such large numbers,? a senior officer in Elahi?s secretariat said.

 Even the Indian Army ? till recently busy trading bullets with its Pakistani counterpart on the border ? has been asked to send a polo team to settle scores on a different turf. The Western Command, however, is yet to take a decision. ?The peace talks are at a very sensitive stage and it is too early to start playing games with the enemy when Kashmir is still burning,? an officer said.

 Efforts are on to ensure the games are carried out professionally. With over 500 athletes from both sides taking part in 12 disciplines ? athletics, badminton, cycling, gymnastics, hockey, handball, wrestling, kabaddi, volleyball, shooting, tug-of-war and polo ? the Punjab government has been finding it difficult to arrange suitable accommodation for the Pakistani contingent. The chief minister has even asked residents of Patiala for help.

 Weightlifting was struck off the event after a ban on India?s national weightlifting association, whose lifters were disqualified for using drugs. Basketball had earlier been cancelled following a request from Pakistan.

 Athletes will compete for the first and second prize and entry to the games will be free. Apart from central security agencies, over 5,000 policemen will be deployed in Patiala.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Cheated of $39000 in marriage net

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 15: US-based 

 systems engineer Anasuya Mohan was looking for a husband 

 when she put up her profile on a matrimonial website last 

 year.

 But in Akhil Mukherjee, 30, she found instead a Delhi-based school dropout pretending to be a Chicago business consultant who managed to dupe her of $39,000.

 Akhil, a resident of Deshbandhu Apartments in Kalkaji, was arrested by Delhi police?s economic offences wing today for cheating and fraud. 

 The anti-forgery section which is conducting investigations has collected e-mails and cross-checked bank records relating to the $39,000 transferred into Akhil?s bank account through the Western Union money transfer.

 The fraud, which shows how some people choose to abuse matrimonial sites, came to light last May when Anasuya met Akhil?s maternal uncle, Bal Kishan Sansi, who lives near Chicago.

 All Akhil had to say was that he had put up his profile on the website to have fun and make some easy money.

 Anasuya, who works with Motorola in Schaumburg, had been in the US since 1998. Soon after putting up her profile, she began to correspond with Akhil, who claimed he was earning $150,000-200,000 a year running a business called Real World Services.

 Akhil, who said he held a green card, claimed to have studied at a Shimla boarding school before moving on to the London School of Economics and enrolling for a masters course at Stern School of Business, New York. He said he had worked with Goldman Sachs in New York for a few years before moving on to Chicago.

 Akhil sent Anasuya photos of his Chicago ?office? and said he was applying for US citizenship. During their year-long internet correspondence, he managed to conceal that he was actually a part-time computer salesman.

 In June 2003, Akhil claimed his sister had had an accident and that he was having financial difficulties. Three months later, Anasuya sent him money via Western Union transfers as well as directly to his ICICI bank account. But Akhil avoided meeting Anasuya or her parents in US and India.

 Delhi eases Pak visa rules

 PRANAY SHARMA

 New Delhi, Sept. 18: India today announced steps to further relax visa rules for Pakistanis and make it easier for mediapersons, academics, doctors, professionals and senior citizens to travel to the country.

 Any visitor from Pakistan can now travel to 12 cities in India, instead of limiting their visit to only three. The decision to ease visa rules was unilateral.

 The announcement, made on the eve of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh?s visit to New York, where he is scheduled to meet George W. Bush and Pervez Musharraf, shows that building people-to-people contact with Pakistan is India?s main plank to ease tension and normalise relations.

 Delhi has been stressing on people-to-people contact but Islamabad has argued that unless the Kashmir dispute is resolved, there can be no meaningful improvement in ties.

 Singh leaves tomorrow for the United Nations General Assembly in New York. On the way, he will stop in London for a day to meet British counterpart Tony Blair. He is scheduled to meet President Bush on September 21. A meeting with Musharraf, probably on September 24, is also planned. The ongoing peace process is likely to be discussed at the meetings on the sidelines of the general assembly.

 A few days ago, foreign minister K. Natwar Singh had announced that he would take steps to ease visa restrictions for visiting journalists from Pakistan. Today foreign ministry spokesperson Navtej Sarna gave details of the changes, which will come into immediate effect.

 According to the new rules, accredited journalists with minimum three years? experience with an international or national media organisation of repute can be issued ?multiple entry? visas without a prior reference to headquarters. They will also be exempt from reporting to police on arrival.

 Academics and those invited by a reputed university or any other institution in India, doctors accompanying patients for treatment in a reputed Indian hospital and senior citizens above the age of 65 will get the same facilities. Sarna said India will also ease restrictions for those Pakistanis who want to attend a conference or participate in a seminar here.

 ?These are unilateral measures taken by the government of India to promote people-to-people contacts with Pakistan,? the foreign ministry spokesperson said, pointing out that some steps to make travel easier between the neighbours had been taken earlier. ?Naturally, we hope that the government of Pakistan would also be able to take similar measures.?

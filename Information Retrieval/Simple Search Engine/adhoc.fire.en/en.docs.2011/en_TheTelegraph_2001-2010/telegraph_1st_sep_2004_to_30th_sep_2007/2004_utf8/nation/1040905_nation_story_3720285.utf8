 YSR snubs Gujarat police team 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Hyderabad, Sept. 4: The minority-savvy Andhra Pradesh government has shut the door on a Gujarat police team that was here to take into custody a Muslim religious leader.

 Keen to let the dust settle after the controversy generated by the preventive arrest of Maulana Naseeruddin, the president of Tehreek Tahafuz Shair-e-Islam, on the eve of the Ganesh festival, the Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy government turned away the Gujarat police team that came here two days ago looking for him.

 Gujarat police said Naseeruddin, who was arrested here on Sunday along with seven youths, was wanted in a case under the Prevention of Terrorism Act for involvement in a conspiracy to incite Muslim youths during the 2002 post-Godhra riots.

 The chief ministers office, however, refused to hand him over. A CBI-CID inquiry is pending over Naseeruddins arrest.

 Now that he is already in custody, I appeal to the Gujarat government to wait till the inquiry and the Ganesh festival is over, the chief minister told reporters yesterday.

 Additional police commissioner A.K. Khan said Gujarat police have no locus standi to arrest Naseeruddin without a court order. Let them come with a court order and we will hand over Naseeruddin, the police official said.

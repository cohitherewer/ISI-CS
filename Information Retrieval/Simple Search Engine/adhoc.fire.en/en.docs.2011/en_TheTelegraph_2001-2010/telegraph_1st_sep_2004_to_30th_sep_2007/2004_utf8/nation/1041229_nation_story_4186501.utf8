 Scurry for crisis plan 

 JOHN MARY

 Thiruvananthapuram, Dec. 28: The Kerala government has called a meeting of top earth scientists tomorrow to plan a detailed calamity advisory and crisis management system after a tsunami alert yesterday triggered a panic exodus of fishermen from the coasts to the interiors.

 Around 11 pm yesterday, some local TV channels warned that the state?s coast may be hit by more tsunamis in an hour. The channels quoted Met officials saying ?another tsunami attack was likely in one hour on the Kerala coast?.

 But this morning, newspapers carried a virtual disclaimer from the Indian meteorological department. 

 The Met department, however, said the best option would be to evacuate people staying within 2 km of the coast as there was a probability of aftershocks. But the government may find evacuating the coast tough as the state has a high coastal population density.

 The death toll in the state rose to 173 today, amid unrest at the scene of a mass burial at Azheekkal in Kollam district. Survivors blocked ministers at the scene of burial, alleging government indifference to the calamity.

 BJP president L.K. Advani also had to skip his visit to Colachel, a devastated area on the Kerala-Tamil Nadu border following protests by residents against a police directive to suspend the search for bodies. 

 Speaking on tomorrow?s scientists? meet, chief minister Oommen Chandy said it was meant to evolve a more credible information dissemination mechanism to avoid the kind of chaos witnessed yesterday. 

 But he admitted that the warning was issued after an official-level discussion.

 Revenue principal secretary S. Sundaresan said the meeting would help the government evolve a contingency plan, which would be ready in a week?s time.

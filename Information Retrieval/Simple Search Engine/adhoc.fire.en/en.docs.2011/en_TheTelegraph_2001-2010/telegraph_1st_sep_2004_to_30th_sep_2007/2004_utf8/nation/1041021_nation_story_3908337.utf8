 India high on graft index 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 20: A rating of 146 countries has put India among the 55 most corrupt nations of the world, with no attempts being made to improve over the last year.

 The Corruption Perception Index for 2004 released today by Transparency International India reflects the views of the business community, corporates and analysts around the world. These were gathered through surveys by various international organisations.

 Finland was the cleanest at 9.7 and Haiti the most corrupt at 1.5 on a scale of 1 (highly corrupt) to 10 (highly clean) for the perception of corruption at the highest levels of business in the surveyed countries.

 The indices for developing countries like India, China, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal showed corruption affected them in a big way, said Admiral (Retd) R.H. Tahiliani, the chairman of Transparency International India, a non-profit NGO that studies and makes recommendations on corruption.

 Clearly, it was the developed countries that showed reduced levels of corruption, he said after releasing the report at the India International Centre here.

 India was placed 91st at 2.8 and China 71st with a slightly better perception index of 3.5.

 Pakistan registered higher levels of corruption at 2.1 and ranked 132, but was outdone by Bangladesh, which hit near bottom at 1.8 and a rank of 145.

 The scores showed that when it came to cleaning up the system, China took the initiative by improving from 3.4 in 2002 to 3.5 this year.

 India stayed at 2.8, the same as last year, but improving a little over its 2002 score of 2.7.

 Pakistan, however, progressively slipped in reigning in corruption, scoring 2.1 compared with 2.5 in 2003 and 2.6 in 2002.

 According to Transparency International India, each point amounts to millions of dollars lost in bribery.

 For instance, it has estimated that bribery in government procurement and related activities in India costs the country?s taxpayers $7,000 million. The worldwide figure for money lost in corruption is $400 billion.

 Khurana quits with eye on Delhi

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 25: Madan Lal Khurana today resigned as Rajasthan governor to plunge into politics in the capital. 

 The former chief minister of Delhi admitted that accepting the governor?s post was ?my biggest mistake? and described residents of the capital as ?my gods and goddesses?.

 He had been advised by the BJP leadership to stay put in Jaipur. But Khurana insisted he would not accept a transfer and if had to be shifted, he would rather return to Delhi.

BJP sources said Khurana might be made a vice-president 

in L.K. Advani?s new team, which will be announced shortly after the national 

council on October 27.

 Addressing reporters before meeting President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, Khurana said he decided to quit because of the ?problems? small industries in Delhi are facing after being relocated in far-flung areas. He said he had spent ?sleepless nights? during his Jaipur tenure. ?I cannot enjoy the comforts of Raj Bhavan while people in Delhi are facing problems. It is not in my blood.?

 Khurana said he was particularly hurt by the Delhi government?s move to relocate industries, which threatened the closure of 1.25 lakh units and would leave about 15 lakh workers jobless. ?I could not raise my voice for them while holding the post of governor,? said Khurana.

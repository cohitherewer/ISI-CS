 Vedanta probe flip-flop

 DEBABRATA MOHANTY

 Bhubaneswar, Dec. 23: Zahira Sheikh is not the only to do a flip-flop.

 The contradictory statements of the members of the central probe team, which visited the proposed Vedanta alumina project site at Lanjigarh, have led to a lot of confusion in the past two days.

 On Tuesday, team member and former additional director-general (wildlife) S.C. Sharma seemed to give a clean chit to Vedanta Alumina. The other member of the team was Sanjiv Chaddha, assistant inspector-general (wildlife) in the ministry of environment and forests.

 However, while facing a group of Congress MLAs at the state guest house yesterday, the team members said they were yet to give a clean chit to Vedanta. A number of trees have been felled at the site of the project, they added.

 The team members said the divisional forest officer concerned had written a letter to Vedanta over the issue of clearance but the latter allegedly ignored it. Most of the violations were found in Kothadwar. 

 ?The company misrepresented facts to the Centre by suppressing information on the existence of village forests at the project site,? Chaddha said. 

 In the Assembly, the BJD-BJP combine yesterday tried to turn the tables on the Congress citing the ?clean chit?. Today, it was the Opposition?s turn to do the talking. 

 Orissa Gana Parishad MLA Arun Dey asked, ?Why did the fact-finding team accept the state hospitality and use the government plane to fly to Lanjigarh when the government is involved in the case??

 Durbar heat on Siwan sultan 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Dec. 5: The CPI(ML) today demanded that jailed Siwan MP Mohammad Shahabuddin should be shifted out of Bihar because he, too, was holding prison ?durbars? like Pappu Yadav. 

 ?We welcome the Supreme Court?s intervention in Pappu Yadav?s case, who used to hold durbars inside Beur Central Jail in Patna. It is good that a CBI inquiry has been ordered. The apex court took suo motu cognisance on the basis of newspaper reports. Such terror prevails in Siwan that the wrongdoings in that jail are not being reported,? CPI(ML) general secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya said.

 He added that a PIL would soon be filed in the Supreme Court seeking its intervention. 

 ?Pappu Yadav, Shahabuddin and others like them should be shifted to jails outside Bihar. The state government and prison officials are only too pleased to obey their command inside the jails. This misuse of power should be stopped,? he added.

 Bhattacharya said that Pappu Yadav?s case was only a symptom and the politician-criminal nexus was being guided from inside the jails of Bihar. ?Jails have become centres for fostering this unholy alliance,? he added. 

 Pappu Yadav has begun a protest inside Beur jail alleging that the authorities were hatching a conspiracy to ?eliminate? him.

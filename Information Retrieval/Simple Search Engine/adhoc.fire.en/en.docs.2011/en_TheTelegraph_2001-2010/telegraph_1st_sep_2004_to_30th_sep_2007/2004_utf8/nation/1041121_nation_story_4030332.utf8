 Chirac push to Security Council seat

 AMIT ROY

 London, Nov. 20: President Chirac of France, who has ended an official visit to Britain to celebrate 100 years of the uneasy Anglo-French Entente Cordiale, has urged reform of the United Nations, with India, along with Germany and Japan, given a permanent seat on the Security Council.

 Chirac stands in danger of becoming India?s new best friend providing he can resolve one outstanding issue ? remove the ban on a handful of Sikh boys wearing their turbans to school. The French did not think of this unintended consequence when making it illegal for Muslim girls to wear a hejab in state schools.

 But Chirac is making an attempt to get into India?s good books by backing the Indian campaign to get into the big boys? club ? a campaign which is, to no one?s surprise, vehemently opposed by Pakistan.

 Tony Blair, the British Prime Minister, said he, too, supported Indian entry when he addressed a news conference with Manmohan Singh in London.

 Chirac twice backed India?s case, once, before an invited audience of 200 students and academics at Rhodes House in Oxford, with the university?s Chancellor?s Chris Patten presiding, and then also in a speech to the International Institute of Strategic Studies in London.

 Chirac played down his differences with Blair and President Bush but it is clear he has a very different philosophy of the international order. He said that instead of trying to spread ?western democracy?, he was more anxious to follow a multilateralist approach in solving the world?s problems.

 Chirac pointedly stressed the importance of dialogue between Europe and ?the world?s major poles? ? China, India, Brazil, Russia and various trading blocs.

 After Blair and Bush espoused the spread of western democratic values ? some would say Christian values ? as the best safeguard against terrorism, Chirac warned in his speech in London: ?We must avoid any confusion between democratisation and westernisation. For although our memory is sometimes short, the peoples submitted to the west?s domination in the past have not forgotten and are quick to see a resurgence of imperialism and colonialism in our actions.?

 Chirac also said at his joint press conference with Blair that Iraq was the ?one and only issue? over which France and Britain disagreed. ?Who is right or wrong, history will tell,? he said.

 In Oxford, he gave a more controversial answer when asked when it was acceptable to intervene militarily in a country. 

 ?It?s not for any given country to consider that a situation is open to stepping in and interfering,? he responded. ?It?s up to the international community to do so, in particular the UN, which alone has the authority to interfere.?

 Chirac added that if countries intervened independently, it would ?throw the door wide open to hosts of reasons to wage wars under the guise of legitimate interference?.

 He spoke of the importance of a ?dialogue of cultures?. ?Any culture, big or small, has something to teach us, something unique, something which any balanced, fair world needs,? he told his audience.

 The Entente Cordiale hits trouble from time to time, as for example, when France tested nuclear weapons in the Pacific. At that time, a number of prominent British Asians attacked the French stand.

 The writer Hanif Kureishi said he would make the supreme sacrifice by ?giving up French women?. This time, though, on the question of Iraq, the vast majority of British Asians ? and probably the people of Britain ? are more with Chirac than with Blair.

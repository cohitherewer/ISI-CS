 India playground for war waste bombs

 New Delhi, Oct. 2: Two days on, Ranju Devi is looking for her husband among the debris left by a blast that ripped through a Ghaziabad scrap factory. Supervisor Vinod Sharma is in a hospital bed, shrapnel has pierced his body but he is better off, lucky to survive unlike his 10 colleagues in Bhushan Steel Factory where an explosion killed them on Thursday.

 Ranju Devi and Vinod Sharma do not know it but they are among the victims of a phenomenon that is hitting India ? UXO blasts, an inevitable feature of the globalisation of war waste. In the terminology of the International Committee of the Red Cross and the International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL), UXO stands for ?unexploded ordnance?.

 UXOs are ?duds?, explosives that did not detonate when they were intended to.

 From India?s western border, through Pakistan, Afghanistan and West Asia, the wastage of past wars is claiming the lives of innocents who had little to do with other people?s battles. A proliferation of little wars and trade in the detritus of wars is killing people in countries thousands of kilometres from the theatres of action. 

 This has combined with easier trade norms in liberalised economic regimes to make it possible for war-ravaged countries to export war waste as cheap scrap. In the region around the Arabian Sea, India?s developed industrial base ? with its steel companies ? are a lucrative destination for the UXOs and the military scrap that is used as an input in the production process.

 Bomb disposal squads from the army and the National Security Guard today found 18 more rockets in the scrap imported by Bhushan Steel.

 A total of 43 UXOs were found in the $25,000 consignment of scrap that was exported from the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas by ship, which was trucked through India from the west coast, through the Inland Container Depot in Tughlaqabad just south of Delhi and to Ghaziabad to explode in the factory and shatter the lives of several families.

 Army sources said most of the UXOs were 81 mm mortars. UXO explosions in war scrap are not unheard of. Indeed they have claimed lives in many countries, particularly during handling. 

 In Ghaziabad, too, the UXOs exploded as they were being lifted by a crane that created an electromagnetic field. Army and forensic experts who were searching eight scrap-loaded trucks moved them close to the Hindon river to minimise damage from more explosions. 

 Last evening, mortars and shells were exploded in controlled detonations away from settlements.

 Import of war scrap is banned by the Directorate General of Foreign Trade but controls are lax, allowing for live rockets with detonators to find their way into Indian cities from as far away as Iran. Army sources said many of the UXOs were so old that the markings on them were not legible.

 It is known, however, that Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan have some of the largest stocks of UXOs. In its reports, called Landmine Monitor, the ICBL has often listed instances of UXOs from World War II also claiming lives years later. 

 The ICBL says that in Iran, the number of mine/UXO casualties in some five provinces that bore the brunt of the 1980-1988 war with Iraq are between 15,000-20,000 per year. In Afghanistan, some 555,000 UXO articles were cleared by the United Nations in 2002.

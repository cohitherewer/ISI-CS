 Rebel show of strength in Andhra village

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA 

 Hyderabad, Oct. 10: Prominent People?s War Group leaders will appear before the public tomorrow evening signalling a major deviation in their guerrilla strategy at Guttikonda village on the northern edge of Guntur district.

 PWG secretary Ramakrishna alias Akkiraju Hargopal, Ganesh alias Ravi and Sudhakar alias G. Balakrishna will appear for the public meeting, probably along with another top gun Ganapati alias M. Lakshman Rao.

 The government has set up a coordination committee of senior police officials to supervise the PWG show and to provide them safe passage and protection.

 Members of the Naxalite outfit?s North Telengana region committee and Andhra-Orissa border committee are also expected to arrive.

 A high-level committee meeting of the PWG held in Warangal two days ago reviewed the situation and alerted its cadres not to be complacent. An invisible army of nearly 200 armed activists will be around Guttikonda.

 PWG emissaries have already informed the government about the outfit?s own security preparedness. ?Each leader will have a nine-member escort that will live and die with them,? a senior PWG spokesman said here yesterday.

 Director-general of police Sukumara has set up a team of DSPs and a second rung of junior police officials to ensure there are no upsets at the meeting in the village of 3,000 people.

 The official security ring will comprise a six-member escort for each PWG leader besides a specialised bulletproof vehicle.

 Andhra Pradesh home minister K. Jana Reddy has urged the DGP to take special care so that no harm befalls the ultra leaders. ?The scope and success of the talks will depend on the security of the ultras and their confidence in the police force,? he reportedly told the officer yesterday.

 The outfit?s supporters from across the state are reportedly descending on Guttikonda to welcome the PWG leaders. 

 ?It gives me great pleasure that 

 my son is coming home after 20 years,? said Rajamma, the 

 52-year-old mother of Ramakrishna.

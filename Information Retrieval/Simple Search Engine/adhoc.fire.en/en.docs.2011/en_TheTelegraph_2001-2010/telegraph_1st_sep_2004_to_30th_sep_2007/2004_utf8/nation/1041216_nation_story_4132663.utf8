 Patna, Dec. 15: The cradle that catapulted Laloo Prasad Yadav to political prominence over three decades ago vigorously rocked again as dozens of students were injured in a police lathicharge today when they attempted to storm Wheeler Senate House of Patna University.

 The students ? from all organisations except the Rashtriya Janata Dal?s students? wing ? were demanding that union elections, not held in more than two decades, be conducted at the earliest.

 As president of the Patna University Students? Union, Laloo Prasad had made a name for himself as he joined the movement led by Jai Prakash Narayan, with senior BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi as the union?s then general secretary. 

 Nitish Kumar, a former student of the university?s engineering college, had also been a member of the union.

 The Senate was to assemble today for its annual meeting with a ?general? agenda and the matter of students? union elections was not expected to be on the agenda. The meeting was held as scheduled after the disturbance subsided. ?As the meeting began at 11 am, scores of students assembled at the gate, demanding that the Senate take up the issue of union elections. They managed to enter the compound but the police managed to push them back. The gate was immediately locked with chains,? a police inspector said.

 The information was flashed to Pirbahore police station, which sent in reinforcements as the situation threatened to spin out of control. The agitated students scaled the high gates of Senate House and some of them managed to enter the building. A few vehicles parked outside, including that of MLC Ram Nandan Singh, were damaged by the students.

 By then, a large number of policemen had arrived with a riot-control vehicle. Lathis were rained on the students and a few teargas shells were also lobbed. Witnesses said some ?outside elements who were supporting the police? hurled at least two crude bombs. About seven students were arrested from the spot while the injured were rushed to the emergency ward of Patna Medical College and Hospital. Neha Singh, a member of the CPI-ML affiliated All-India Students? Association (Aisa), sustained severe injuries in both her knees. 

 ?There was no woman police official and yet girls were beaten up. We are fed up with the dictatorial attitude of the vice-chancellor,? she said. 

 AISA leader Abhyuday, who was arrested, said the university Senate has become a ?talking shop? where nothing more than ?eating, drinking and merry-making happens?. ?We have been demanding the union elections for a long time but all that we get in return is police high-handedness. The RJD is responsible for not holding the elections because its students? leaders enjoy favours by virtue of their affiliation,? Abhyuday said.

 A university official admitted that the authorities were not in favour of holding the union elections. ?We fear it will further polarise the students and create fresh law and order problems on the campus. Besides, there is pressure from the highest quarters not to entertain any demands in this regard,? he said.

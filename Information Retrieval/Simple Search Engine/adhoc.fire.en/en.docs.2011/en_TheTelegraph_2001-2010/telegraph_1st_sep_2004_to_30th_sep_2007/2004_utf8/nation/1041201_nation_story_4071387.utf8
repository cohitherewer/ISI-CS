 Singh, who is the son-in-law of the once powerful Bihar minister and Union chemicals minister in the P.V. Narasimha Rao Cabinet, Ram Lakhan Singh Yadav, is the second animal husbandry official to be found guilty of acquiring assets disproportionate to known sources of income.

 On September 29, the CBI court of Satish Chandra Singh had found the former assistant manager of the Ranchi dairy farm of the animal husbandry department, Birsa Oraon, guilty of acquiring disproportionate assets. 

 Oraon was also slapped with a five years? rigorous imprisonment, a fine of Rs 2 lakh and an additional six months? imprisonment if he failed to pay up.

 Apart from the disproportionate assets case, five other cases are also being heard in various courts in connection with Singh?s involvement in the scam.

 Fifty-three cases related to the now infamous Bihar animal husbandry scam, estimated at over Rs 762 crore, are being heard in Jharkhand and Bihar.

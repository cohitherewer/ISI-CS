 Atal turns Uma last resort

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Bhopal, Dec. 12: The Uma Bharti camp in Madhya Pradesh is counting on Atal Bihari Vajpayee?s support in revoking her suspension from the BJP.

 Uma supporters have reasons to look to the former Prime Minister. His nephew Anoop Mishra is a Madhya Pradesh minister and considered a close Uma associate.

 Mishra is so vocal in backing the sadhvi that recently he was summoned to the state BJP office for a ?little talk?. Organisational secretary Kaptan Singh Solanki reportedly urged Mishra to observe restraint in demanding Uma?s return as chief minister.

 Sources said Mishra has been lobbying hard for Uma?s rehabilitation since she stormed out of a party executive meeting in New Delhi on November 10.

 He was said to be instrumental in arranging her dinner meeting with Vajpayee following her suspension.

 According to Uma loyalists in the state, her suspension will be revoked soon in spite of the ?letter bomb?, a reference to an unsigned letter critical of the BJP?s second-rung leadership that came out in the media.

 There is a great deal of controversy regarding the number of letters Uma wrote to party chief L.K. Advani and their contents. 

 One account claimed that Uma wrote three letters while sulking in Kedarnath. In the first, she offered to apologise for her behaviour at the BJP meeting while seeking a similar regret from the party.

 In the second letter that generated major controversy, Uma reportedly toned down the criticism in the signed copy that reached Advani. The third, not made public so far, had Uma reportedly sounding so emotional that it softened the ?Big Two? ? Vajpayee and Advani.

 Another account said her outburst had more to do with the VHP?s ?blow hot, blow cold? attitude towards the BJP. 

 Some top VHP leaders had at one stage toyed with the idea of floating a new political outfit with Uma?s help. But as the RSS mediated and the VHP developed cold feet, Uma was forced to change her stand.

 A source close to Uma, however, ruled out the possibility of her being made BJP national office-bearer. The best case scenario is restricted to her being made a campaigner in the Bihar Assembly polls, scheduled for February. Depending on the performance in Bihar, her supporters are counting on her return to Madhya Pradesh as chief minister.

 But the return does not appear easy. Uma?s successor Babulal Gaur is sitting pretty after the party performed well in the recent civic polls. He has also been able to take the party along with him.

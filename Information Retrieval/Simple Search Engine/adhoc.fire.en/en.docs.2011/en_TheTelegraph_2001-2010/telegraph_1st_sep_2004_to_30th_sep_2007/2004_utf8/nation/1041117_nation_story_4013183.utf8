 Dikshit ire over dark Diwali-eve

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 16: A dark lead-up to the Festival of Lights has spurred the Delhi government to crack the whip on the two private power distribution companies and ask them to take strict action against employees in case of any attempt to disrupt supply. 

 The Sheila Dikshit regime suspected sabotage by employee trade unions and invoked the Essential Services Maintenance Act when more than 50 areas in and around East Delhi suffered a series of power cuts on Diwali-eve after 28 feeders were shut down. 

 This is the first time such a step has been taken to maintain regular power supply since the Delhi Vidyut Board (DVB) was privatised in 2002 and distribution was delegated to the Reliance-owned BSES and Tata Power. 

 An FIR was registered on Diwali, which fell on Friday, at the Vivek Vihar police station on directions from the home department. Following an internal inquiry by the BSES, one Kuldeep Sharma and his associates have been accused in the complaint of tampering with equipment and disrupting supply by tripping 11-KV lines of the distribution network. 

 The controversy is taking on political overtones, particularly since Delhi Congress chief Ram Babu Sharma has become the patron of the new Delhi Power Employees? and Engineers? Association.

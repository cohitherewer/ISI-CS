 Berth slap for college crisis MLAs

 B.R. SRIKANTH

 Bangalore, Dec. 15: The Congress leadership cracked its whip on legislators who had triggered an admission crisis in professional colleges this academic year, denying them a place in chief minister Dharam Singh?s ministry.

 None of the party MLAs who manage professional colleges in Karnataka was accommodated in the expanded ministry today.

 According to senior Congress ministers, the party leadership decided to reprimand half-a-dozen legislators who formed a coterie of private professional colleges, embarrassing the government during admissions.

 The management of 50-odd colleges first adopted a parallel selection process under the banner, Consortium of Medical, Engineering and Dental Colleges of Karnataka. They rejected the 75:25 formula in allotment of seats ? three-fourth of seats under the government quota and one-fourth payment seats ? and turned away students selected by the state government through the Common Entrance Test. Later, the consortium accepted a 65:35 quota but raised the admission fees.

 The delay in admissions threw the fate of more than a lakh students into uncertainty, damaging the chief minister?s image. ?Half-a-dozen of such legislators have been punished because they chose to contest a decision of the government on admissions and the fee structure. That?s why even a powerful leader like Shamanur Shivashankarappa did not make it,? a senior Congress leader said. Party treasurer Shivashankarappa is related to Union home minister Shivraj Patil.

 As many as 20 leaders ? nine from the Congress and 11 from the Janata Dal (S) ? were inducted today to take the strength of the coalition government to 32. Eighteen of them were sworn in with cabinet rank, with two from the JD (S) assuming office as ministers of state.

 Governors 

 New Delhi, Nov. 2: Former Union minister Buta Singh and former Rajya Sabha deputy chairperson Pratibha Patil have been appointed governors of Bihar and Rajasthan, reports our special correspondent.

 Singh, 70, replaces M. Rama Jois in Bihar and Patil, also 70, succeeds Madan Lal Khurana, who resigned to return to active politics. 

 Both Jois and Khurana, who quit last week, were appointed governors by the previous National Democratic Alliance government.

 A Rashtrapati Bhavan announcement today said the fresh appointments will take effect from the date the two assume charge.

 Singh was the home minister in the Rajiv Gandhi government in the 1980s and also a minister in the Narasimha Rao cabinet. His predecessor Jois resigned after a 16-month term often marked by frequent tiffs with the Rabri Devi government. 

 Patil, a former Maharashtra PCC president, was elected to the Rajya Sabha in June 1985. She was elected deputy chairperson of the Upper House in November 1986, a position she retained for two years.

 Reddy rap on TV skin show

 New Delhi, Sept. 16: Content cops in the government today cracked the censor whip on television broadcasters despite Union information and broadcasting minister Jaipal Reddy having proclaimed that he was a ?libertine? who believed that ?moral policing is the job of society and not the government?.

 Reddy?s ministry today summoned broadcasters and threatened to invoke content policing provisions in the law to stop skin shows from being telecast on entertainment channels.

 Representatives of television channels Etc, ETV, STAR, Zee and MTV and members of the Indian Broadcasting Foundation (IBF) were given an earful by an I amp;B ministry official and censor chief Anupam Kher after a recent Bombay High Court observation expressing concern over smut on the idiot box.

 Joint secretary (broadcasting) Ujjwal Singh Bhatia told broadcasters that the government can punish them on three counts: 

 It can invoke Section 20 

 of the Cable Television Act and ask operators to stop beaming 

 the ?offending? channels

 It can make use of a clause 

 in the licensing agreements that the broadcasters have with 

 the government and revoke the licence

 Under a new downlinking 

 policy that is being formulated, the government can refuse 

 permission to ?habitual offenders? to downlink and distribute 

 television signals.

 Bhatia, who chaired the meeting, was incensed after Kher, the chairman of the Central Board of Film Certification, said he had written ?between 200 and 250 letters? to different broadcasters, warning them of offensive content being telecast particularly during family viewing hours. But the repeated missives had evoked little response.

 The I amp;B ministry?s tongue lashing today reminded broadcasters of the time the previous BJP-led administration with first Sushma Swaraj and later Ravi Shankar Prasad at the ministry helm consistently warned against ?offensive content?. Reddy?s taking over of the ministry was seen as a signal of glasnost, especially after he said on his first day in office that he was not in favour of censorship.

 But today, the censor board chief ? who was appointed by the previous administration ? said ?offensive content? was being telecast habitually. Most of the smut, the censor board believes, is in music videos, on dedicated movie channels and in promos. 

 Kher said it is difficult to monitor content in all channels ? there are about 130 available across the country. He said there are instances of films marked for ?adult? viewing being telecast.

 Broadcasters mostly took the plea that it is not possible to get all content approved by the government because of technical problems. One broadcaster pointed out, for instance, that there is no regional censor board in Chandigarh for local film content to be screened.

 The secretary-general of the IBF, Nawani, said the body has convened a meeting of all broadcasters to evolve a self-regulation regime.

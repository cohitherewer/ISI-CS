 Births timed to tune fate

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Bhopal, Dec. 20: If the stars are willing, so are the doctors.

 More and more couples in Madhya Pradesh are opting to have their child delivered as ?timed by the astrologer? and doctors are apparently ready to co-operate to the extent medically possible.

 For the astrologically inclined, an ?astro-child? is a surefire way to ensure its health, happiness and success. A ?timed delivery? is all right with doctors at private nursing homes in Bhopal, Ujjain, Indore, Jabalpur and other smaller towns in the state.

 ?If parents insist on some auspicious time, we oblige them depending on the health of the baby and the would-be mother. There is nothing unprofessional or unethical about it,? said Dr Kiran Julkar, who runs a nursing home in Bhopal.

 Doctors at the state-run Sultania Hospital said they, too, had been asked to deliver babies in accordance with astrological forecasts. ?But we seldom entertain them officially. Most of it is being done on an informal basis,? Dr V. Tirku said.

 Dr Ghanshyam Thakur of Indore, who said he was also an ?astro-palmist?, claimed to have helped deliver over 70 babies at an ?auspicious? time.

 People from almost all strata of life, he said, were coming to him to have an ?astro-child?. A couple recently wanted him to extend the delivery date by a day to have ?raj yoga? in their child?s destiny, Thakur said.

 Bhopal-based astrologer Swami Trilokinathji Maharaj put it all down to the role of birth time in determining a child?s future.

 Depending on when a child is born, he can be a self-made man or be loved and helped by people coming into his life, the astrologer said.

 The child could have a sunny disposition and take life as it comes or may be favoured and protected by hidden forces, all depending on the time of birth, he added.

 Birth within a particular time-span could also ensure a brilliant academic record or an inclination towards philosophy, religion and the fine arts.

 Financial aptitude, talent to promote oneself with humility, confidence, fame and fortune and members of the opposite sex playing a decisive role in promoting career ? everything could be ensured by timing the birth, the astrologer said.

 Asked about the need for an ?astro-child? if every hour of the day had a positive role to play in deciding the future, Trilokinathji Maharaj said time of birth was only one of the factors in shaping destiny. So it could not be blamed entirely if something went wrong.

 According to Pandit N.P. Vyas of Ujjain, correct prediction depends upon the accuracy of the horoscope provided to an astrologer. There are three requirements for a perfect horoscope ? date, time and place of birth. Date and place of birth in most cases were correct, but the same could not be said about the time of birth, he said.

 The inaccuracy in time was due to various factors. One, in olden days there were no quartz watches. Mechanical watches were available but they used to lose or gain time in minutes. In rural areas, the use of watches was rare. More important, the main concern of the doctors and nurses was the safe delivery of the child, not noting the correct time of birth.

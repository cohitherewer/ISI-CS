 Amar knocks on PM door over varsity

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 12: Tension between Uttar Pradesh?s chief minister and governor over promulgation of an ordinance to set up an Urdu university has intensified with the Samajwadi Party appealing to the President and Prime Minister for ?justice and fairplay?.

 With chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav on a collision course with governor T.V. Rajeshwar over the ordinance, his party general secretaries Amar Singh and Ram Gopal Yadav have chosen to play on the ?secular? sentiment. 

 The secretaries said they had told Manmohan Singh that the Congress and the Samajwadis supported each other?s governments in the ?cause of secularism?. How could the Prime Minister then oppose the establishment of a university for the minorities, they asked.

 Amar Singh said: ?We told the PM that the BJP?s opposition to such a decision was understandable but we cannot understand why the Congress is doing it.? He said the Prime Minister assured them he would look into the matter. ?We hope for justice and fairplay from the PM and the President,? the general secretary said.

 He added that he would not meet Congress chief Sonia Gandhi over the ordinance. Asked who was creating obstacles, Amar Singh said: ?I don?t want to go into it. I have full faith in the PM?s sense of fairness and justice.?

 Asked why the government was insisting on appointing controversial senior minister Mohammad Azam Khan as pro-chancellor of the Maulana Mohammad Ali Jauhar University, the general secretary shot back: ?But why not? Let it be the prerogative of the party leadership. If politicians can head and aspire to head cricket control boards without ever playing the game, why can?t politicians become pro-chancellors of universities??

 Amar Singh cited a 1973 precedent to justify the Urdu University Ordinance. With Uttar Pradesh then under President?s rule, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi approved a legislative proposal to enact a law for setting up the Sampuranand Sanskrit Vishwa Vidalaya with former Varanasi Maharaja Vibhuti Naraian Singh as pro-chancellor.

 He said the governor was Indira?s ?hand-picked? nominee to head the Intelligence Bureau and wondered why he had chosen to refer the ordinance to A.P.J. Abdul Kalam ?without any justification? instead of promulgating it.

 However, Amar Singh was careful not to attack Rajeshwar or the Congress. He condemned BJP leader Yashwant Sinha for making a ?shameful? reference to the Prime Minister. Even on the ?tainted? ministers, the general secretary?s response was: ?It is the prerogative of the PM to keep them or drop them?

 But he regretted that the Samajwadi Party was not part of wider ?strategy? consultations with the United Progressive Alliance government and the Left despite supporting the regime from outside.

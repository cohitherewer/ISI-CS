 Army salve on Manipur

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 3: The Centre is keeping options open on the next step in Manipur where the movement demanding withdrawal of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act has forced a rethink in the security establishment.

 Senior leaders will meet over the next week to assess the situation after the visits of the army chief, General .C. Vij, who was in Manipur today, and Union home minister Shivraj Patil, who is due in Imphal on Sunday.

 The defence ministry and the army have staunchly argued against the act being withdrawn or diluted. The army has told the leadership that it would be severely handicapped in its counter-insurgency operations without the cover provided by the act.

 But the Centre is still debating options, sources said. The security establishment has assessed that withdrawing the Assam Rifles would not be possible. The Assam Rifles is such a large force that its withdrawal will leave too large a gap in the security grid. No other paramilitary force can spare enough personnel to fill a void left by the Assam Rifles. Its role also defines it as the penultimate force before the army directly gets involved in an internal security situation.

 General Vij today met chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh, according to a defence ministry release in Delhi. The army chief has reiterated that the army was very keen to establish the truth and facts relating to the death of Thangjam Manorama.

 The sources said that in large measure, the situation in Manipur would depend on the progress of the investigations into the killing of Manorama.

 The army, on its part, says it is confident that its personnel will not be found guilty. On the army chiefs orders, the service has voluntarily sent for DNA testing the blood samples of all the soldiers in the patrolling party that had taken Manorama into custody. In his interactions in Manipur, Vij repeatedly stressed this point.

 We are very keen to establish the truth and facts relating to the death of Thangjam Manorama. It is for this reason that the army had on its initiative expeditiously organised blood samples of 33 personnel for the DNA test, the defence ministry statement said. 

 The general has assured that should any culpability be established, the guilty will be most severely dealt with in keeping with the ethos and discipline of the army. Vij, the statement said, had made a goodwill gesture to the people of Manipur and had said that he has no objection to the Kangla Fort being handed over to the Manipur government at the earliest.

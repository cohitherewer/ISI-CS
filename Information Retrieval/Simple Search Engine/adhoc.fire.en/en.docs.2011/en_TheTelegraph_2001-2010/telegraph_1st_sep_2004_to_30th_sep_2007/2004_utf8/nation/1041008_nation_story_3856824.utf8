 Left ignores PC pledge

 New Delhi, Oct. 7: The CPM is not allowing itself to be rattled by finance minister P. Chidambaram?s statement in New York promising investors higher foreign direct investment inflow in telecom, insurance and civil aviation, reports our special correspondent.

 ?It is the finance minister?s job to woo investors,? said CPM leader Prakash Karat.

 Chidambaram has told investors in the US that the FDI cap in domestic airlines will be raised from 40 to 49 per cent within a month while the Centre?s intention is to raise the ceiling from 49 to 74 per cent in telecom soon. He has not given any assurance on the insurance sector where the government needs Parliament?s approval to increase the cap.

 Karat said the Left has agreed to the government?s proposal to raise the FDI cap to 49 per cent in domestic airlines though it is not a policy of the Left. In telecom and insurance, the CPM, he said, stands by its opposition of any hike in the FDI cap. Karat said a United Progressive Alliance-Left co-ordination committee meeting is likely on Tuesday.

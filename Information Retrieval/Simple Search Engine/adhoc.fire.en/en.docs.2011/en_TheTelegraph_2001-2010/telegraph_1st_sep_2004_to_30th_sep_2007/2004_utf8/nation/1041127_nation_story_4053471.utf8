 Sen lessons on Labour lips

 AMIT ROY

 Brown

 London, Nov. 26: Gordon Brown, the chancellor of the exchequer, has quoted Amartya Sen?s groundbreaking work on famine relief in explaining how the media could help fight the war against world poverty, hunger, disease and illiteracy.

 In a passionate speech to the BBC World Service Trust in London on Wednesday, Brown effectively laid claim to the moral leadership of the Labour Party and, in many ways, the political leadership of Europe as well.

 The trust was set up in 1999 to promote development through better communications, and Brown?s keynote address set up the priorities facing next year?s United Nations Millennium Summit.

 World leaders will meet at this summit to examine progress in eradicating poverty.

 World poverty is the most important issue of our generation?, said Brown, who is seen by many in his party as embodying more old fashioned Labour Party virtues than Tony Blair.

 Since Britain assumes presidency of the G8 richest nations of the world next year as well as that of the European Union, Brown?s references to Sen and his plan on how to reduce global poverty assumes much greater significance.

 Brown will continue to be the key man in the British government after Blair, assuming Labour wins the next general election, widely expected to be held on May 5 next year.

 Brown urged the media to cover world poverty ? he knows most British newspapers do not consider the subject to be ?sexy?. The chancellor revealed that in a survey, ?86 per cent said there was not enough or too little media coverage of poverty in developing countries?.

 Turning to the lessons to be learnt from the Nobel Prize winning economist, Brown said: ?When Amartya Sen wrote some years ago of the difference between the history of famines in China and India and exposed the difference between the old China ? where, because there was no free press and no multi-party democracy, no one reported the deaths, no one ever knew the nameless, forgotten, unmentioned people who died ? and the old India ? where, because there was openness, the authorities were forced to react ? he was describing in the case of India where the role and responsibility of the media in development starts ? through better communications ? to promote better development.?

 He spoke of the power of exposure: ?Sunlight is the best disinfectant.? Speaking of the urgent need ?to fashion a new relationship between rich and poor countries and people?, Brown demanded the setting up of a ?modern equivalent of the Marshall Plan?, which rescued Europe after the Second World War.

 He wanted 100 per cent of the historic debts of the poorest nations written off, the establishment of an ?International Finance Facility? and an effective doubling of aid from the richest countries to $100 billion per year.

 Although these days the chancellor always spoke of the ?challenge of India?, he now argued that the rich should support the poor ?to invest in infrastructure, education, health and economic development so they can benefit from access to our markets?.

 His goals were such that they could easily be adopted by any Leftist Indian government --- by 2015, primary education for all; halving of poverty; and elimination of avoidable infant deaths (the chancellor and his wife Sarah lost their first baby a few weeks after birth).

 For many young people, Live Aid, organised 20 years ago after pop singer Bob Geldof had visited Ethiopia after a BBC report by journalist Michael Buerk on the famine there, ?was the single most memorable moment of their lives?, Brown said.

 The chancellor spoke with raw emotion: ?Live Aid was that extraordinary moment when, through the power of television, everyone in the world realised here was an issue that wasn?t just a matter of opinion. Live Aid was about communicating the self-evident truth that we cannot be this rich and see people that poor, that when we see people starving to death on TV right in front of our eyes we cannot sit there and do nothing.?

 This is the kind of talk which makes many in the Labour Party want to replace Blair, tarnished by the Iraq war, with Brown. However, Blair has so far been the election winner --- and he is likely to get a third term and will remain in the job, critics say, long enough to ensure Brown does not succeed him.

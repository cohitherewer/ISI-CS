The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Born in Australia, but still Indian 

 Sydney, Sept. 9 (PTI): 

 In a ruling that could have far-reaching impact on migrants 

 born Down Under, the Australian high court today ruled that 

 a child born in the country to two Indian asylum seekers 

 was not a citizen. 

 In a 5-2 verdict, the court dismissed the family?s challenge to a federal law, sealing the fate of six-year-old Tania Singh. It clearly signals to those seeking to migrate to Australia that one should enter only on a valid visa. 

 Australia is one of the few countries where citizenship is not granted by birth. 

 Tania and her family have 28 days, unless the minister for immigration intervenes, to leave the country. 

 Under the law that Tania?s father challenged, a baby born in Australia must have at least one parent who is Australian or a long-term resident of the country to automatically qualify for citizenship. 

 The girl?s parents, Malkiat and Sarabjeet Singh, arrived in Australia on a business tourist visa with their two-year-old son from Punjab in 1997. Once in the country, they applied for protection visas as refugees. Tania was born in Mildura, Victoria, in February 1998. 

 The Singhs? visa applications were rejected by the immigration department and refugee review tribunal. The tribunal?s decision is pending review in the federal court. 

 Last year, Malkiat sought a high court declaration that because Tania was born in Australia, Section 198 of the Migration Act, 1958, which provides for removal of unlawful non-citizens, did not apply to her. 

 The primary issue is whether the plaintiff is an alien under Section 51 of the Australian constitution, which gives parliament the power to make laws with respect to their naturalisation and thus empowers it to legislate for the removal of unlawful non-citizens. 

 The majority high court decision today found that parliament does have the power to treat someone like Tania, born in Australia, as a non-citizen. 

 Reacting to the ruling, Gurbax Singh Malhi, an MP from Canada ? another favoured destination for Indians looking to migrate ? expressed surprise. 

 ?I am not aware of the ruling but I feel it will not be adopted by other countries. Moreover, Australia has its own rules and regulations and the ruling could well have stuck to the laws prevalent in the country. I cannot say much on the ruling without going through it in detail. But anyone born in any country does become a citizen of that country,? Malhi, on a visit to India, told our correspondent in Chandigarh.

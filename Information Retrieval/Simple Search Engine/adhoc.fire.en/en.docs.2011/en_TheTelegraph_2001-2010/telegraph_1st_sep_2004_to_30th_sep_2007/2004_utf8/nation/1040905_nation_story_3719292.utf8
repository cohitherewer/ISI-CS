 Women cry murder over Varma film

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Varma: Under fire

 Hyderabad, Sept. 4: Andhra Pradesh High Court has directed the Central Board of Film Certification and the producers of a Telugu film, Madhyanam Hatya (Midday Murder), to remove a controversial subtitle that has raised the hackles of womens organisations in the state.

 A division bench comprising Justices Sudarshan Reddy and K.C. Bhanu gave the directive on a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by the Progressive Organisation of Women.

 Produced and directed by Ram Gopal Varma of Rangeela fame, the film with the subtitle Would you feel good if your wife was dead? was released in theatres yesterday amid protests and demonstrations by womens groups.

 The PIL contended that the films hoardings and the subtitle would send wrong signals and could incite crime against women.

 The court was informed that the Censor Board had not cleared the designs and objectionable captions of the movie, which focuses on the insecurity housewives when their husbands are away at work.

 Varmas protege, J.D. Chakravarty of Satya fame, and heroine Amani star in the psychological thriller based on the lifestyles of middle-class families living in sprawling residential complexes.

 Yesterday, activists of the Andhra Mahila Samakhya tore down posters of the film at different locations in the city. One of the posters showed the curled-up body of a murdered housewife in a box. 

 Such portrayal of violence against women is irresponsible and insensitive and has frightened housewives, Pasya Padma, who led the activists, said.

 The activists and members of the youth and womens wings of the Left parties burnt an effigy of Varma.

 The protesters have also threatened to disrupt screenings at a dozen theatres in the twin cities of Hyderabad and Secunderabad.

 They claimed that the film showed different ways of killing ones wife.

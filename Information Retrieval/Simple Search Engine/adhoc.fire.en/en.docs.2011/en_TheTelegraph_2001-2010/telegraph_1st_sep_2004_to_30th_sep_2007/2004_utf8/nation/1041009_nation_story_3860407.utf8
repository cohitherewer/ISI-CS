 Palace takeover bid puts off royal scion

 B.R. SRIKANTH

 Bangalore, Oct. 8: The famed Dasara celebrations commencing next week is in danger of being overshadowed by a spat between the Karnataka deputy chief minister and the scion of the Mysore royal family.

 Srikanta Datta Narasimharaja Wadiyar, also a former Congress MP, today blamed Siddaramaiah for reviving the acquisition process on the eve of the yearly festivities.

 A couple of days ago, the state had appointed infrastructure development department?s principal secretary Vinay Kumar the commissioner of the Mysore Palace Board to go ahead with the acquisition process.

 ?This move,? Wadiyar claimed at a news conference here, ?is the result of local politics in Mysore, where I am not on good terms with Siddaramaiah (of the Janata Dal-Secular). He is behind this plot.?

 Wadiyar added he would meet chief minister Dharam Singh and provide details of the case on the palace being heard by the Supreme Court. ?I have just returned from abroad and the chief minister has gone to Bidar. I will speak to him after he returns,? he said.

 The government, Wadiyar said, ought to await a verdict on his petition challenging the Palace (Acquisition and Transfer) Act, 1998, enacted by the government of late J.H. Patel.

 The apex court had in 1998 ordered status quo and allowed the royal family to occupy a part of the palace and participate in the rituals. ?The final verdict of the court is yet to come. There was no hurry for the government to make the sudden move,? Wadiyar said.

 The timing of the move has embarrassed the chief minister. ?The matter is before the Supreme Court. It is an emotional and sensitive issue. More so because the Dasara festivities are round the corner,? Dharam Singh told reporters here today.

 Official sources said a senior minister in the Dharam Singh cabinet had directed officials to hasten the acquisition process.

 Court notice on school interviews

 New Delhi (PTI): Delhi High Court has issued notice to attorney-general Milon Banerjee, seeking his help to decide if interviewing children and their parents for admission to nursery and pre-primary classes is necessary.

 Keeping in view the importance of the issue we have to decide, we think it appropriate to request the attorney-general to assist this court in the matter, a division bench of Justices D.K. Jain and S.R. Bhat said.

 All bodies, individuals and schools interested in assisting the court in the matter may file their submissions in the form of affidavits within two weeks, the judges said.

 The bench, which had earlier issued notice to the human resource development ministry, will take up the case again on September 22.

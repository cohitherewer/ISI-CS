 Safety stain on Games pride

 AYSWARIA VENUGOPAL

 New Delhi, Nov. 14: The Indira Gandhi Indoor Stadium, a venue for the Commonwealth Games 2010, may not be able to host any of the events.

 The stadium, the pride of the 1982 Asian Games, has been sealed by Delhi High Court as it does not fulfil fire safety norms. The stadium, built conforming to Olympic standards, also leaks when it rains.

 ?This has been sealed for months and is going to stay closed till the fire-fighting equipment is installed. The central public works department had given us till November end to complete the work,? said an official at the stadium.

 ?However, even if the work is completed, the stadium will not reopen until the fire department officials inspect it and give their clearance. After that, we will have to approach the court to de-seal it,? he said.

 The rain that trickled in during international events and caused considerable embarrassment to Indian authorities was testimony to the poor upkeep. This lack of maintenance had also jeopardised the Afro-Asian Games of 2001, which was to be held in Delhi.

 The stadium, which is ideal for badminton, volleyball, table tennis, gymnastics, judo and wrestling, can be divided into equal halves by a retractable soundproof and fireproof synthetic wall ? making it possible to conduct two competitions simultaneously. Each half of the centrally air-conditioned facility has six change rooms, four VIP areas, a media room and a medical room.

 However, players who frequent the stadium complain of the state of disrepair this once-beautiful facility is in. They highlight the dirty bathrooms, broken seats and dirty floors and allege that nothing has been done to improve the conditions there despite protests from national teams in transit who stay and train there from time to time.

 A defunct fire-fighting system has added to the problems. ?We did not give the IGI Stadium a clearance because its fire-fighting system was old and defunct. The stadium was built in the 1980s and since then technology has changed so much. Its exit points are just not designed to deal with an emergency,? said a Delhi Fire Service official.

 A defunct sprinkler system, the absence of glow signboards, an ill-equipped evacuation system and congested staircases have all the makings of a potential fire hazard, said the official.

 Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit yesterday began a two-day seminar for widespread consultations with leading sports personalities to chalk out a policy for avoiding embarrassment. She emphasised on the augmentation of sports infrastructure and announced that a sports school with modern facilities will be established in the capital.

 Hockey players-turned-coaches Ajit Pal Singh and Zafar Iqbal, as well as former cricketers Maninder Singh and Gurcharan Singh, are among those participating in the pre-Commonwealth Games brainstorming session at the Delhi government headquarters near the stadium.

 Bakery trial

 Mumbai, Oct. 26: A former worker of Best Bakery today deposed in the retrial of the Gujarat riot case as the first witness to the killings, reports our special correspondent. 

 Taufeeq Ahmad, 32, told designated judge Abhay Thipsay in the special court here that he saw rioters storm into the ground floor of the bakery building around 9.30 pm on March 1, 2002, and set it on fire.

 Ahmad, who was not examined in the earlier trial in Gujarat, said he was witness to two persons being stabbed and was put into a room that was set on fire. 

 Recalling the incident, he said he was sitting in the bakery with the other workers when rioters attacked, setting the bakery, an adjacent house and two autorickshaws on fire. Ahmad was injured seriously. He will also depose tomorrow.

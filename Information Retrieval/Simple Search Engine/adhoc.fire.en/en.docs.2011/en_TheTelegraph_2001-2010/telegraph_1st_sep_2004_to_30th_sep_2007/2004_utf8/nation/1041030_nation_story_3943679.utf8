 Candid Buddha scores at CII meet

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Buddhadeb

 New Delhi, Oct. 29: It was advantage Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on the concluding day of the Confederation of Indian Industry?s national meet.

 The dhoti-clad Bengal chief minister may have looked the archetypal bhadralok Marxist but impressed the Who?s Who of India Inc with his capitalist logic. His assured performance could help his state net significant investment.

 Helping him along was a tired presentation by Delhi chief minister Sheila Dixit who, fighting off a Supreme Court order to relocate industry out of the capital, said her government did not need any more industry. There was also a sob story from her Assam counterpart Tarun Gogoi who compared his state to a handicapped boy who needed special attention to develop.

 Bhattacharjee did not say anything new, but his candid exposition of successive Left Front government failures turned out to be his unique selling proposition. The chief minister said the Marxists had got it wrong earlier with their pro-labour stance. 

 ?We have made some mistakes in the past with regard to private capital and trade unions. But we are trying to correct them now,? he said.

 Bhattacharjee?s firm, positive tone seemed to impress the country?s industrial elite. He had to cut across a wider swathe with his arguments for he was addressing the task of bringing industry back to a state that has witnessed a flight of capital since the 1960s.

 But by dwelling more on the present and recounting success stories with big names like Microsoft, IBM, Infosys, Tatas and Reliance, the chief minister managed to grab the attention of captains of industry.

 ?I received a letter from Microsoft last week saying that they wanted to come to Calcutta. While Hyderabad and Bangalore were the IT destinations during the 90s, it now appears to be the turn of Calcutta,? he said.

 Industry leaders nodded in approval as Bhattacharjee said Bengal is a stable state. But he admitted it had failed to attract enough investment in automobiles, textiles and leather despite having the best goatskins in the country.

 Dixit and Bhattacharjee alike were clear about their wish lists and had clearly demarcated areas in which they were seeking investment. The Bengal chief minister had a long list of industries in which he is willing to unroll the red carpet: jute, steel, automobiles, textiles and leather, among others.

 But what tilted the scales in his favour was Dixit?s message which had one industrialist muttering: ?Why did she turn up if she does not want to do business with us??

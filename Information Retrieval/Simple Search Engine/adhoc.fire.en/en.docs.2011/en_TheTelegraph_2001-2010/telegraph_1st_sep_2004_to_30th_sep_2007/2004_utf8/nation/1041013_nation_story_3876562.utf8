 R-Day thank you to king

 PRANAY SHARMA

 Wangchuk

New Delhi, Oct. 12: Bhutan King Jigme Singye Wangchuk has been invited to be chief guest for next year?s Republic Day celebrations.

 Although Bhutan has traditionally been one of India?s closest allies, the decision to pick him as chief guest indicates Delhi?s appreciation for his decision to evict Northeast insurgents from his country last year.

 It is also a signal to other neighbours, particularly Bangladesh, which have so far been indifferent to India?s security concerns.

 The decision was taken after a meeting today between foreign minister Natwar Singh and the king in Paro. This is Singh?s first official visit to Bhutan since assuming charge.

 The decision comes at a time when South Block is yet to make up its mind whether to permit Bangladesh foreign minister Morshed Khan to come to Delhi to invite Prime Minister Manmohan Singh for the Dhaka Saarc summit in early January.

 Natwar Singh thanked the king for the ?successful military operation? and reassured him over ?whatever security assistance? was required. In their two-hour meeting, both sides expressed satisfaction with the bilateral group recently set up to deal with border management and security issues.

 The military operation by Bhutan against the Northeast insurgents ? though it came after years of negotiation between the king and the armed rebels failed ? has become a perfect example of what South Block considers ?good neighbourly? relations.

 When the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance was in power, it had urged neighbouring countries, mainly Bangladesh, to take a leaf out of Bhutan?s book. The Congress-led United Progressive Alliance has also been citing the example to encourage Dhaka to take action against Northeast insurgents camping on its soil.

 Earlier, Nepal had not been in favour of combating elements working against Indian interests from its territory. But in the past few years ? after the 1999 hijacking of the Indian Airlines airbus from Kathmandu to Kandahar ? it has started cooperating with Delhi. The stepped up Maoist violence in Nepal over the last three years has also brought Kathmandu closer to Delhi.

 Myanmar, which has a porous land border with the Northeast, has assured Delhi cooperation in tackling insurgents working against Indian interests from its soil.

 At the moment, Bangladesh is the major sticking point. So far, it has not shown keenness to address India?s security concerns though the Northeast insurgents? presence has been raised time and again during talks. This has turned into a sore point in bilateral relations.

 Indications are that a large number of insurgents who were driven away from Bhutan are now camping on Bangladeshi soil. The recent series of explosions in Nagaland and Assam is seen as a handiwork of insurgent groups operating from Bangladesh.

 With nothing from Dhaka to suggest it is willing to work closely with India to tackle the insurgency problem, the rebels are taking advantage of the 4,000-km porous border to move freely between the two countries.

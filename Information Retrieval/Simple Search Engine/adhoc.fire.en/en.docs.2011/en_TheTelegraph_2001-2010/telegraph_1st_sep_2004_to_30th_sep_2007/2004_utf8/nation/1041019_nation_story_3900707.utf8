The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Worry lines friends? faces

 KAY BENEDICT

New Delhi, Oct. 18: Most National Democratic 

Alliance partners have been caught unawares by L.K. Advani?s sudden return as 

BJP chief.

 Other than the Shiv Sena and the Akali Dal most are not too happy, but officially they ?welcome? the decision to hand over the reins of the BJP to Advani after a six-year gap. Most do not have a problem with the veteran per se. ?Our only worry is if he should resort to the hardline plank,? they say.

 With NDA convener and Janata Dal (United) chief George Fernandes away in Haryana, party colleague and former Union minister Sharad Yadav ?welcomed? Advani?s appointment. ?It is a good thing. I welcome it,? he said.

 A Telugu Desam Party leader declined to react, saying: ?We are not part of the NDA. We only extend issue-based support from outside.? He said the leadership change was the BJP?s internal matter.

 The Desam politburo has been urging party chief . Chandrababu Naidu to dump the BJP after the Desam fared badly in May?s Assembly and Lok Sabha elections. The former Andhra Pradesh chief minister managed to establish a rapport with Advani towards the end of the NDA rule, especially after the BJP veteran became deputy Prime Minister. But many senior Desam leaders feel the party will not be able to recapture minority votes unless the BJP sheds it hardline posture.

 Most allies are worried that Advani?s ?hardline? face might resurface. A senior alliance leader said the string of electoral reverses since May showed that voters had rejected the BJP?s Hindutva plank. ?Even in Maharashtra, they could not sell Veer Savarkar and (the) tiranga yatra,? he said.

 ?Hardline nahi chalega,? said a leader who did not want to be identified. The Desam, Dal (U), Trinamul Congress, Indian National Lok Dal and the ADMK are sure to object to a return to Hindutva politics. 

 INLD chief Om Prakash Chautala quit the NDA some months ago because of ?Advani politics?. It will be difficult to win back Chautala now that Advani is party chief.

 Sources said the Dal (U) is divided over Advani. Nitish Kumar, whom the BJP leader backed when Trinamul chief Mamata Banerjee wanted to get back the railway portfolio, is personally beholden to Advani. But Yadav and Fernandes are not.

 Sources said Fernandes may not have any problem adjusting to Advani. But Yadav is not comfortable with his Hindutva politics.

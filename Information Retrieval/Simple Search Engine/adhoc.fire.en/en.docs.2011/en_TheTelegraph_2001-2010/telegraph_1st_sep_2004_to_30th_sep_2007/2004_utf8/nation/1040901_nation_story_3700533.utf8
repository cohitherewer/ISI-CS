 SC seeks quota report

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 31: The Supreme Court has directed six states, including Bengal, to furnish by tomorrow morning a report on vacant all-India quota seats in their government medical colleges. 

 A division bench of Justices Y.K. Sabharwal and D.M. Dharmadhikari said it would resume hearings tomorrow after the status of admissions and vacancies are submitted by the state chief secretaries.

 Bengal, Bihar, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu received the directive on a submission by the director-general of health services that the department has not received proper information from them on vacant seats.

 The director-general said that of the 93 government medical colleges that contribute to the 15 per cent all-India quota, only 78 have informed the department about the vacancies, as have 20 of the 25 dental colleges. As a result, the department has been unable to conduct fresh counselling for these seats.

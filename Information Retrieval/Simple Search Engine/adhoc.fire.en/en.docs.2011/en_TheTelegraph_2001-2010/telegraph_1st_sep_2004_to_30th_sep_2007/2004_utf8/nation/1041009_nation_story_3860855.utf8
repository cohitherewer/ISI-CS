 Delhi sees Hurriyat hope

 ALOKE TIKKU

 New Delhi, Oct. 8: The moderate Hurriyat Conference?s outburst against Islamabad yesterday has cheered Kashmir watchers in Delhi but they say it may be too early to expect the separatist conglomerate back at the talks table.

 At an interaction with visiting journalists from Pakistan, the moderate separatists held Pakistan responsible for engineering the split in the All Parties Hurriyat Conference and the killings of moderate leaders by ?unidentified gunmen?.

 This was the first time in the recent past that the moderates had directly spoken out against Islamabad?s strong-arm tactics to force them to toe its line.

 Delhi sees the outburst as the first indication that the intense pressure brought on the moderate Hurriyat by Pakistan ? that reached a peak during foreign minister Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri?s visit ? has begun to wear off.

 In the capital last month for foreign minister-level talks, Kasuri had asked the Hurriyat leaders to unite the separatist movement under the leadership of the hawkish Syed Ali Shah Geelani.

 Senior Hurriyat leader Abdul Ghani Bhat, who represented the moderates at yesterday?s interaction, made it clear they were not going to join hands with the separatists led by Geelani. ?There is absolutely no scope for unity with Geelani,? he told The Telegraph.

 Bhat said the Hurriyat should ideally have never split, which he added was not engineered in Kashmir but elsewhere, thus pointing a finger at Islamabad.

 He went on to assert that as much as Delhi wanted the Hurriyat to split, it was Islamabad that executed the move. ?If he (Geelani) had not behaved like a (Pakistan) crony, the Hurriyat would have never split,? Bhat said.

 However, it is being suggested that the Hurriyat?s decision to articulate its views against Pakistan may not imply that the moderates are all set to talk peace with the Centre. That decision, Bhat said, would be taken by the Hurriyat leadership after acting chairman Mirwaiz Omar Farooq is back in the Valley.

 The Hurriyat ? like the Centre that has stressed the need to prepare the ground for negotiations ? is not desperate to hold the next round of talks started by former deputy Prime Minister .K. Advani in January.

 The moderate Hurriyat leaders feel that they probably tried to move too fast on the peace track, exposing themselves to Geelani?s ?vilification campaign? that they had sold out to the Centre.

 Smoke cordon comes up around schools

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 1: Educational institutions across the country will be out of bounds from today for cigarettes, beedis, and other tobacco products.

 A notification to this effect issued earlier has thus become operational, which means those flouting the order can be arrested and punished for breaking the law.

 ?No person shall sell, offer for sale or permit sale of cigarette or any other tobacco product in an area within the radius of 100 metres of any educational institute,? the notification says.

 On World Anti-tobacco Day last week, health minister Anbumani Ramadoss had promised ?stricter? enforcement of anti-tobacco laws from next year. He had said the government would make it impossible for tobacco kiosks to sprout around educational institutions.

 The implementation of the anti-tobacco regulations, however, will depend entirely on the states. ?We have written to all the state governments regarding the ban on sale of tobacco products near educational institutions,? an official in the ministry said.

 The ban is being implemented as part of the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products (Prohibition of Advertisements and Regulation of Trade and Commerce, Production, Supply and Distribution) Act, 2003, which Parliament passed last April.

 There is precious little the Centre can do if states are not keen to implement the law but they cannot afford to ignore it because of the growing public awareness of the ill effects of cigarettes, beedis and tobacco-leaf chewing, officials in Delhi believe.

 A report on tobacco control in India, assigned by the health ministry, details the ill effects of tobacco as highlighted by the expert panel.

 It is well documented that cigarette smoking is a major cause of cancer, heart attack, lung disease and pulmonary tuberculosis. Studies quoted by the report show smoking causes about 700,000 deaths every year in India.

 The report also reveals that the relative risk of death from tobacco use in rural India is 40 to 80 per cent in all types of tobacco users.

 Studies also show the risk of death is 50 to 60 per cent higher for smokers. An urban study conducted in Mumbai found that the relative risk of death was more than 50 per cent higher for smokers and about 15 per cent higher for smokeless users (like those chewing tobacco leaf).

 The health ministry has instructed state governments to ensure that a board is put up on the boundary walls of educational institutions indicating prohibition of sale of tobacco products.

 Since May, the Centre has banned smoking in ?public places?, direct and indirect advertising of all tobacco products, and their sale to minors. But much of this is only on paper as the laws are not being implemented, even in the capital.

 Cigarette vendors and small-shop owners are unhappy with the new rules. A cigarette shop owner said: ?This is just another way for police to make money. Mark my words, cigarettes will be sold anyway under the table.?

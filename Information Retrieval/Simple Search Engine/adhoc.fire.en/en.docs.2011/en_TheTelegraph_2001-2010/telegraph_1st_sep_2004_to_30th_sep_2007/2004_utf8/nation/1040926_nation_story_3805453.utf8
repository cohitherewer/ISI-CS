 PC pledge to consult unions

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi, Sept. 25: P. Chidambaram has assured 

the Left he will discuss with labour leaders the issue of restructuring public 

sector undertakings.

 At a dinner meeting last Wednesday, the finance minister had unveiled before CPI leaders the government?s proposed measures to fulfil commitments in the common minimum programme, including those on PSUs.

 The Left parties, sources said, have told Chidambaram that they may understand the need for closing down PSUs that cannot at all be turned around but their trade unions may find it difficult to accept.

 ?The trade unions, which have their following among PSU employees, will find it more difficult to explain closures to the rank and file,? a Left leader said.

 A cabinet meeting on September 29 is scheduled to clear a new board that would look into the restructuring of all four categories of PSUs ? the navratnas, those making profit, those that can be turned around, and those that are bankrupt.

 For now, the Left parties are satisfied with the minister?s assurance that the board will not have representatives of ?big business? but retired heads of PSUs and nationalised banks, and economists.

 But the unions, particularly the CPM-backed Centre of Indian Trade Unions, are opposed to closure of even unviable PSUs.

 Citu general secretary and CPM politburo member M.K. Pandhe is continuing to talk in the strongest possible language even after his party pulled him up earlier for saying the Left would topple the government if it pursued policies unacceptable to it.

 The unions are also opposed to any move that may curtail the monopoly of the Airports Authority of India though CPM and CPI leaders do not mind a rise in FDI from 40 to 49 per cent in civil aviation.

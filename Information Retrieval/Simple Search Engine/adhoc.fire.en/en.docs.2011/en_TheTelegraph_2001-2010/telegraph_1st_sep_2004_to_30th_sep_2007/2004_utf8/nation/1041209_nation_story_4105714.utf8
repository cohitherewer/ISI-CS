 Judge nails top cop lie

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Dec. 8: A special court today pulled up a senior Gujarat police officer for lapses in procedure while witnesses in the Best Bakery case, Zahira Sheikh and her family, were being brought to Mumbai.

 The court hearing the re-trial recorded the statement of superintendent of police, Gandhinagar, R.B. Brahmabhatt, who was summoned in connection with the security provided to Zahira?s family when they arrived from Gujarat.

 Judge Abhay Thipse had said that there were several lapses in the manner in which Gujarat police provided security. 

 He said that according to the order issued to Brahmabhatt by the director-general of police, Gujarat police should have escorted the family only till the state?s border.

 Brahmabhatt replied that he was given to understand that the protection was to be given to Zahira and her family for their movement anywhere in the country. 

 The court asked the officer whether the order allowed the police to move from ?Kashmir to Kanyakumari?? 

 The officer was told to translate the order from Gujarati to English. The translation showed that the constables were to accompany the family only till the Gujarat border.

 The judge expressed severe dissatisfaction with Brahmabhatt?s replies and asked him if he was lying. 

 Seeking pardon, the police officer said he was carrying out instructions delivered to him because the order to extend security to Zahira?s family outside Gujarat was given orally.

 He said that it was a regular procedure to give orders orally as the method of giving written instructions was often not followed. 

 The court told the officer that it was not blaming him but was trying to find the truth. The court, however, added that it ?doubted the veracity of his statements.?

 The judge also pointed out that the three Gujarat police constables, who were accompanying the family, did not have an official letter of duty.

 When the judge said Sahira, Zahira?s sister who turned hostile in the witness box and is being questioned by the prosecution over a week, should have had a woman constable for protection, Brahmabhatt replied that there was no woman constable in his department. 

 He said he was told that Sahira?s husband would accompany her.

 When the court pointed out that Gujarat police were to provide security cover to six witnesses other than Zahira?s family, Brahmabhatt said he was given to understand that the security cover was only for Zahira and her family.

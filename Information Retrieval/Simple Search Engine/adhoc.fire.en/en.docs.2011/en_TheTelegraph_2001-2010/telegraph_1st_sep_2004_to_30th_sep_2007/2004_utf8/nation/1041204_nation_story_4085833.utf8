 War veterans

 New Delhi, Dec. 3: A group of war veterans from Pakistan today made an impassioned plea to New Delhi and Islamabad to give peace a hard push.

 The group is on a goodwill visit to India under the aegis of the India Pakistan Soldiers? Initiative for Peace, an association of retired defence officials from the two countries.

 The war veterans met Union home minister Shivraj Patil and asked him to take the initiative to liberalise the visa regime for retired defence personnel. 

 Patil said they should not expect too much as it took two to clap.

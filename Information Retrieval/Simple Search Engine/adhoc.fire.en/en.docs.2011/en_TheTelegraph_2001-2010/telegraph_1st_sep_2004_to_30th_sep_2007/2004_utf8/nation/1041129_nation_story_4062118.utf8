 Another aide, another will war

 - Himachal princess bequeaths crores to domestic help, kin cry foul

 MANJEET SEHGAL WARRIOR

 Bilaspur/Shimla, Nov. 28: About 82 km from Shimla, in the former princely state of Kot Kehloor, a controversy is unfolding over a dead princess? will amid allegations of her poisoning.

 It has come at a time when corporate India is witnessing inheritance battles involving the Birla family ? also over a will ? and the Ambanis.

 Rajkumari Rajeshwari, 67, died on November 11, bequeathing her moveable assets, said to be worth crores, to her domestic help and confidant Ram Vilas. The immovable assets were to be assigned to a trust.

 Ignored in the will made only two days before the spinster princess? death, her legal heirs, including younger brother Kanwar Kirti Chand and family, have cried foul.

 ?We fear our sister died under mysterious circumstances and was poisoned to pocket her wealth,? alleged Kirti Chand, who is married to the sister of Maheshwar Singh, a former BJP MP and erstwhile ruler of Kullu princely state.

 ?She was knowingly taken to a small nursing home and hospitals like IGMC Shimla and PGI Chandigarh were ignored. Ram Vilas and his family have stolen valuables worth lakhs from the palace,? further alleged the brother who is based in Panchkula, Haryana.

 Rajeshwari died, says the post-mortem report, of a cardiac arrest. ?We conducted a post-mortem following a complaint by the legal heirs of late Rajkumari Rajeshwari. The preliminary investigation says she died of cardiac arrest,? said Chander Shekhar, superintendent of police of Bilaspur, formerly Kot Kehloor.

 But the exact cause will be known when ?a forensic expert?s opinion and viscera report come in a day or so?, the officer added.

 Agencies had reported Rajeshwari celebrated her birthday on November 9 with a friend in Kullu and on her return, she signed the will ? the second after the cancellation of a will made in 1999 that donated the property to a trust. 

 That night, she complained of chest pain and was rushed to a nursing home in Sundernagar, 42 km from Bilaspur, where she died two days later. Rajeshwari rarely stepped out of her palace, content to live in the care of her nine servants.

 ?She regularly visited us,? said Karuna Kumari, wife of Kirti Chand. 

 ?Four years ago, when she was ill and we took her to PGI, Chandigarh, she said servants were mixing sleeping pills in her juice and she has become mentally-ill,? she alleged.

 Kirti Chand and family have been unhappy with Ram Vilas and his relatives over their ?involvement? in family affairs. ?He is merely a groundnut-seller,? Kirti Chand said.

 Ram Vilas, 50, from Baipur village in Uttar Pradesh, had been tending to the late princess for the last 14 years. His son Madho was her driver. Six more of his relatives, too, lived in the servants? quarters.

 ?Ram Vilas is currently living in Kunala area, 3 km from Bilaspur town,? the SP said. He was asked to vacate the palace premises by the district administration following complaints by the legal heirs. 

 The administration also seized a part of the palace ?as a precautionary measure because some relatives tried to demolish the servants? quarters?, Bilaspur deputy commissioner Subhasish Panda said.

 ?According to her new will, which she made in the presence of Dhanvir Thakur, tehsildar and land registrar of Bilaspur, on November 9, all immovable assets will go to a trust that will work for the poor people. She has gifted her movable assets to Ram Vilas,? he said. 

 The value of the assets is not known. ?We estimate the cost of movable assets around Rs 6 crore. The cost of the land and palace is around Rs 2 crore,? Karuna Kumari said. ?We have just finished the death rites and will move an application in court to challenge the will,? she said.

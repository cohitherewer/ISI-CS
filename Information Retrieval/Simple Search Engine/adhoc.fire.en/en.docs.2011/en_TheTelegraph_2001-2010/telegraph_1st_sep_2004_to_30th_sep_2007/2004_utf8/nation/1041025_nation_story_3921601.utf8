 Judges norm 

 New Delhi, Oct. 24 (PTI): Delhi High Court has banned all retired judges practising as advocates from taking up cases that were dealt with by them as judicial officers. 

 ?An advocate who has dealt with a matter in judicial capacity earlier should refrain from appearing in such matters,? a bench said.

 The ruling came on an application objecting to the appearance of a retired high court judge as an advocate in a case that he had earlier dealt with in the capacity of an additional district judge.

 ?It is very clear that the rule-maker indicated that the person who has acted as a judicial officer in a proceeding, subsequently in the same proceeding, shall not appear as an advocate,? said the chief justice, writing the judgement for the bench. 

 The bench observed that a lawyer has a duty to his client, to his opponent, to the court, to the society and to himself. The court pointed out that it needs a high degree of probity to ?strike a balance?. 

 Advocates . R. Gupta and Madan Bhatia had contended that the counsel who dealt the matter in judicial capacity was liable to be debarred from appearing in that case.

 The advocates contended that the high court has supervisory and controlling power over the right of audience of an advocate appearing in a case before it.

 Delhi beats Israel in arms race 

 Washington, Sept. 1 (PTI): Global arms sales fell for the third consecutive year by approximately 12 per cent in 2003, to $25.6 billion, compared with $29.14 billion in 2002, as south Asian countries, including China, India and Pakistan, overtook West Asia in the buyers race, according to a US government report. 

 It said arms sales had declined worldwide due to several factors such as an economic slowdown and consequent austerity measures adopted by leading arms buyers around the world and as wealthy nations focused more on upgrades and modernisation rather than replacement of arms.

 Nonetheless, the developing world continues to be the primary focus of foreign arms sales activity by conventional weapons suppliers, the Congressional Research Service found. 

 The US and Russia continued to dominate the global arms market Washington maintaining its lead in weapons sales with deals of more than $14.5 billion, up from $13.6 billion in 2002 the report said. Russia ranked second with deals worth $4.3 billion and Germany third, signing deals worth $1.4 billion. 

 The Conventional Arms Transfers to Developing Nations 1996-2003 said India was the fourth largest buyer in the developing world, with purchases worth $12.6 billion, while Pakistan came tenth with $3.8 billion. 

 Leading the pack between 1996 and 2003 was the United Arab Emirates with purchases totalling $15.7 billion, followed by China with $13.7 billion and Egypt with $13.6 billion.

 Israel came fifth with purchases worth $9.9 billion, followed by Saudi Arabia ($9.4 billion), South Korea ($8.8 billion), South Africa ($5.3 billion) and Malaysia ($5 billion) in the developing markets category. 

 Relationships between arms suppliers and recipients continue to evolve in response to changing political, military and economic circumstances, the report said. 

 The US and Russia collectively made (arms sales) agreements in 2003 valued at over $18.8 billion, 73.5 per cent of all international arms transfer agreements made by all suppliers, it said. 

 The report found that developing nations in West Asia were making fewer weapons purchases while developing nations in Asia were relatively increasing their purchases. 

 During the three-year period from 2000-03, China led Asia into the top position with the region signing deals worth $33.8 billion. During the period, Beijing concluded arms agreements worth $9.3 billion. 

 Nonetheless, these apparent trends are subject to abrupt change based on the strength of either the international or regional economies, the report said. 

 The health of the domestic economies in various nations in the developing world continues to be a very significant factor in their arms purchasing decisions. 

 Conventional arms categories in the report include tanks, artillery, armoured personnel carriers and armoured cars, major and minor naval surface ships, submarines, guided missile patrol boats, supersonic combat aircraft, subsonic combat aircraft and other types of conventional aircraft, the report added.

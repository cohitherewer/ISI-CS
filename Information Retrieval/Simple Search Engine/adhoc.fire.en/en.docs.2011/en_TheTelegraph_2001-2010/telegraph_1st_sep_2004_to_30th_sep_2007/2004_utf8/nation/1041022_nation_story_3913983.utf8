 Dharam ahead in reward race

 OUR BUREAU AND AGENCIES

 Oct. 21: The Karnataka government today announced a reward package of Rs 50 crore for the state?s special task force personnel involved in operations to catch forest brigand Veerappan, who was killed in a Monday night encounter.

 Each of them will get a cash reward of up to Rs 5 lakh, a plot, special medical allowance and salary increment, chief minister Dharam Singh said at the police commemoration day function here.

 The cash award is Rs 2 lakh more than what the Tamil Nadu government has announced for each STF member from the state.

 The cost to the Karnataka exchequer would be around Rs 50 crore, Singh said as he commended the Karnataka and Tamil Nadu STF for bringing an end to the terror unleashed by the sandalwood and ivory smuggler. Veerappan, shot dead in Tamil Nadu?s Dharmapuri district, had murdered over 100 people and slaughtered more than 2,000 elephants for their tusks.

 Singh also recalled it was during his tenure as Karnataka home minister that the STF was formed and said the end of the Veerappan chapter was the culmination of many years? efforts.

 As justice caught up with the bandit, luck smiled on R. Sasikumar, a Tamil Nadu armed reserve policeman. Transferred to the STF just two days before the encounter, Sasikumar will get the bonanza ? a plot and promotion besides the cash ? that chief minister Jayalalithaa has announced for the force.

 Sasikumar, who was attached to the armed reserve wing at Ramanathapuram, joined the STF on October 16, swapping places with a colleague who had sought a request transfer to his native town, officials said today.

 It was sheer bad luck for Potri Kannu, who was relieved after a nine-month stint with the STF. Kannu, deployed in the dense forests, had been requesting a transfer for quite some time, the officials said.

 A day after the bandit was buried amid doubts about his identity fuelled by his missing trademark handlebar moustache, a noted forensic scientist said a study of his external ear confirmed the body was Veerappan?s.

 Prof. P. Chandra Sekharan, who was the principal scientific investigator in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case, said he studied the anatomical structures of the external ear from ante mortem and post-mortem photographs and compared them to get the confirmation.

 The external ear?s anatomical structure differs from individual to individual and constitutes a characteristic feature of personal identification, the former director of the Tamil Nadu government?s forensic science department explained in a statement in Bangalore.

 Chandra Sekharan said the combination of various parts of the external ear such as helix, antihelix, triangular fossa, tragus and lobule was unique to an individual. ?Veerappan?s ear is unique with a flat tragus formation and the tragus being contiguous with the curved portion of the helix,? he said.

 ?The lobule is enlarged and squarish in shape. These peculiar features, in my opinion, are more than enough to confirm the identity of Veerappan,? he added.

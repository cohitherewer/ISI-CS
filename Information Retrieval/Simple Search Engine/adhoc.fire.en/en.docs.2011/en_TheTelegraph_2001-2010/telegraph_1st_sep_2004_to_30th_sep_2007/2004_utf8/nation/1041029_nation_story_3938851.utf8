 Delhi jitters for Tiwari

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 28: After Kerala, Sonia Gandhi has picked Uttaranchal, another Congress-ruled state where the party fared badly in the Lok Sabha elections, for a possible shake-up at the top.

 Chief minister .D. Tiwari could go the A.K. Antony way, provided the high command can find a replacement. Indications are that Sonia sounded him today on appointing a new chief minister.

 Tiwari was not his usual self as he left 10 Janpath after a long meeting. Like Vilasrao Deshmukh had quietly slipped out just before he was replaced as Maharashtra chief minister in January 2003, the Uttaranchal leader left by the back gate. He had been waiting for three days to meet Sonia.

 In the evening, Tiwari said he was ready to quit if the high command wanted him to.

 ?I met Congress president Sonia Gandhi today and told her that if she and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh think that there is a need for change of leadership in the state, I will have no objection to it,? the chief minister said. He had met Singh on Tuesday.

 But party treasurer Motilal Vora, who is in charge of the state, did not make any commitment on leadership change.

 Unlike Kerala where the chief minister was changed two months ago, a change of guard in Uttaranchal is complicated because of the difficulty in choosing a successor.

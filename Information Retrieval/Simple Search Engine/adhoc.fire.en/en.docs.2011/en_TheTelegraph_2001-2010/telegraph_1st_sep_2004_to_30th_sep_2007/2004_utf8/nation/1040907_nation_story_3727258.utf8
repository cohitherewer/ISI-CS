 Lukewarm applause in Bhopal 

 RASHEED KIDWAI

Bhopal, Sept. 6: Former Madhya Pradesh chief 

minister Uma Bhartis release from judicial custody today failed to create a stir.

 The ruling BJP illuminated the state party office, distributed sweets and burst firecrackers, but the spark was missing in these celebrations.

 Five of the six Madhya Pradesh ministers who had publicly sought Umas return as chief minister kept mum today. Only minister of state Sunil Nayak reiterated the demand to draft Uma. Nayak was said to be sulking on being given charge of animal husbandry, to which Uma had accorded great importance as it included the department of cow welfare.

 A state cabinet meeting was in progress at 11 am when news came in of the Karnataka government withdrawing the charges against Uma. Chief minister Babulal Gaur read aloud public relations commissioner Aruna Sharmas,message, prompting ministers to stand up and applaud. 

 However, there was no proposal to hand over the ministry to Uma. There was not even a resolution recording Umas sense of sacrifice. Parliamentary affairs minister Kailash Vijayvargiya left it to people to draw your conclusions about the cabinet falling short of passing a resolution in praise of Uma.

 Enthusiastic Uma supporters claimed that party workers in major cities of Madhya Pradesh took out celebratory rallies, but it seemed difficult to correlate with the lukewarm response in Bhopal. 

 At Jawahar Chowk in the heart of Bhopal, barely 50 BJP workers were seen at 1 pm raising slogans in praise of Uma and bursting crackers.

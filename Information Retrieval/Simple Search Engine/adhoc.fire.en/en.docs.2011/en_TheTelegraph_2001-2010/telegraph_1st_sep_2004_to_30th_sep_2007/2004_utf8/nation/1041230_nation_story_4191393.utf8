 Xmas hooch probe with CID

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Dec. 29: The Maharashtra government has decided to hand over the probe into the death of 89 people in a Mumbai suburb after consuming illicit liquor to the CID.

 Today, 13 persons who had consumed the liquor died while 15 more were admitted to Rajawadi Hospital at Ghatkopar. Some are still fighting for their lives, though hospitals said the condition of most patients have stabilised.

 The tragedy occurred on Saturday and Sunday following the consumption of hathbatthi, a country liquor, which was diluted with a very high degree of methanol, at several country liquor outlets near Vikhroli railway station. Three persons have been arrested, Vikhroli police station said. 

 This is the second instance of liquor deaths within the span of one week. In the first incident, 19 people were killed in N.M. Joshi Marg in central Mumbai on December 21.

 Deputy chief minister R.R. Patil today announced that initial investigations will be carried out by an officer of the rank of additional commissioner of police, after which the CID will take over. 

 Twenty-seven government officials, including police and excise personnel, have been suspended following the two incidents.

 At Rajawadi Hospital, where 185 patients have been admitted since Saturday, ward No. 12 is crowded with 69 patients who are still dazed, if relieved, at having escaped the clutches of death.

 Outside the ward is a throng of relatives who are trying to push past the policemen to talk to the patients.

 A doctor said there are several patients in the ICU, but could not mention the exact number as many of them were being shifted to ward 12. Some patients are also admitted at Sion Hospital.

 Anil Gawlekar, who sells books in local trains, said: ?I had just one glass of the liquor. That?s why I escaped. But two of my friends, with whom I was visiting the place, died. They both had two or three glasses. One died instantly and the other died the next day at this hospital.?

 Gajanan Kaulekar, who paints signboards, had the same story to tell. Kaulekar said though he survived, he felt he was about to lose his vision and had lost control over his limbs. He said he lost three of his friends. ?Hum to bach gaye. Lekin jo mar gaya, abhi uska family ka na jaane kya hoga,? he said.

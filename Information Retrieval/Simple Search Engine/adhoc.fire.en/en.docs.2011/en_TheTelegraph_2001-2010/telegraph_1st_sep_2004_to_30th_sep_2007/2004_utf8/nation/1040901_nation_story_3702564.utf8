 33 jawans blood for rape test

 OUR BUREAU

 Imphal/New Delhi, Aug. 31: Blood samples were today collected from 33 Assam Rifles personnel for DNA tests to ascertain if any of them had raped Thangjam Manorama after her arrest on July 11.

 The head of the forensic department of the Regional Institute of Medical Sciences supervised the collection of samples. The commandant of the Assam Rifles 17th battalion, Col. Jagmohan Singh, was present during the process. 

 The DNA tests will be conducted in Calcutta. Tests conducted at Calcuttas Central Forensic Science Laboratory revealed semen stains on a garment that Manorama was wearing when she died in Assam Rifles custody, lending credence to the allegation that she was sexually assaulted before being shot.

 As the blood samples were being collected, officer-in-charge of Irilbung police station Gunindro Singh moved the Imphal chief judicial magistrates court for DNA tests on any Assam Rifles jawan that the police investigation team might consider a suspect.

 We have moved court because the Assam Rifles authorities have not identified the suspects/accused personnel in the alleged rape. The question is, whose DNA is to be tested? Even if the Assam Rifles authorities produce the accused, how can we verify whether they are the real accused? a senior police official asked.

 The official said DNA tests on the 33 personnel from whom blood samples were collected might not reveal the truth. 

 None of the 33 personnel who participated in the operation (to arrest Manorama) could be the culprit. The woman may have been taken to one of their posts for interrogation and someone else may have committed the crime. 

 The army, under which the paramilitary force operates, has been insisting on DNA tests from the day the forensic report was made public. Col. Singh yesterday deposed before the C. Upendra Commission, which is investigating the circumstances leading to Manoramas death.

 In Delhi, leaders of the Manipur Opposition urged the Centre to declare a unilateral ceasefire with militant groups active in the state as the first step towards defusing the crisis. 

 A delegation led by I. Hemochandra Singh submitted identical memoranda to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and home minister Shivraj Patil.

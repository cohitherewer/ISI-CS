 HC hearing on bail for Baazee boss

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 20: Delhi High Court will tomorrow hear Delhi police on the bail application of Avnish Bajaj, CEO of online auction site baazee.com, who has been arrested despite pleading innocence in the sex-clip scandal.

 Former Union law minister and senior BJP leader Arun Jaitley and senior advocate A.S. Chandok moved a bail application on Bajaj?s behalf in the high court today.

 Issuing a notice to police, vacation bench judge Justice Vikramajit Sen asked the prosecution to respond to Bajaj?s contention that no case was made out against him under the Information Technology Act and the Indian Penal Code.

 Jaitley and Chandhok said no case could be made out against Bajaj, an Indian-born US citizen, as bazee.com did not post the obscene material on the website itself. It removed the objectionable material from the site as soon as it was alerted.

 Jaitley said Bajaj had been cooperating with the police in the investigation and had even come here from Mumbai to assist them.

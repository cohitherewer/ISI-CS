The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Digital bridge with Lanka

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Chennai, Oct. 16: The Gulf of Mannar, separating India from Sri Lanka, was bridged today as the two nations revived a microwave link to facilitate direct International Long Distance Services (ILDS).

 During the launch of the ?direct link? here, Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited also announced a slash on Internet and broadband access charges by a whopping 60 per cent, among other sops.

 Its chief A.K. Sinha also said BSNL will cut the call charges between India and Sri Lanka from Rs 18 per minute to Rs 12 per minute from October 21. The rental for ISDN lines will also be reduced from Rs 5,000 per month to Rs 1,750 from November 1.

 The digital microwave link has been established between Rameshwaram in south Tamil Nadu and Talaimannar, the northern tip of Sri Lanka. An agreement on this had been reached between BSNL and Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT) in October 2003. 

 The link will not only improve telephone services between the countries but make possible a range of value-added services like teleconferencing ? one such teleconference connecting Colombo and Chennai brought the function live to audiences in both the cities today.

 Dayanidhi Maran, Union minister for communications and information technology, who was present at the inauguration of the microwave link, made the first telephone call to Sri Lankan minister for posts and telecommunications D.M. Jayarathne. Maran hailed the project as ?yet another step in further strengthening of Indo-Sri Lankan ties, which are already very strong?.

 At the Colombo end, besides Jayarathne, Anil Obeysekere, the chairman of Sri Lanka Telecom, and Nirupama Rao, the Indian high commissioner in Colombo, were present. 

 ?Though India and Sri Lanka are geographically only a few miles apart, this direct communication link makes it only few milliseconds away,? Maran said after the telephonic chat with Jayarathne. 

 A microwave link between Madurai and Colombo had been established in 1980. But it was cut off in the mid-1990s when relations between the two countries soured.

 Maran, in his inaugural speech, also emphasised that the revival of the microwave link was a ?significant landmark? in improving cooperation among the South Asian neighbours as part of the Saarc framework. 

 ?I have already held discussions with my counterparts in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka in this regard. I am happy that our efforts have fructified soon as far as India-Sri Lanka links are concerned,? he said. 

 Both Maran and Jayarathne also announced that BSNL and SLT have planned to lay a high-capacity submarine cable connecting the temple town of Tiruchendur in south Tamil Nadu with Colombo for providing all types of telecom services. They hope to complete this project by September 2005. 

 The telecom service provider, on its part, also announced reductions in tariffs in certain categories. Sinha, its chairman and managing director, said to popularise the use of the Internet and broad-band services, BSNL would slash dial-up or access charges from Rs 24 per hour to Rs.9.60, a 60 per cent reduction. It would be further reduced to Rs.4.80 per hour on Sundays and national holidays. These new rates will also come into effect from October 21.

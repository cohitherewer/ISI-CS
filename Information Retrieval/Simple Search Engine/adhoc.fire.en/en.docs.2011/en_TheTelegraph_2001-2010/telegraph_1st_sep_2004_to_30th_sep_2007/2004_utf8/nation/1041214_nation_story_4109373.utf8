 Flurry of cases for temple trust land

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Dec. 13: Encroachment is a problem not only for mortals but also for the gods.

 Orissa law minister Biswa Bhusan Harichandan recently revealed in the Assembly that as many as 78 cases are pending in Orissa High Court and 246 in several civil courts for retrieval of land registered in the name of Lord Jagannath. Besides, four cases of encroachment have been filed in Puri town.

 Replying to a query by Congress member Netrananda Mallick, the minister said there are 53,699 acres of land recorded in the name of Lord Jagannath in Orissa while 409 acres of land are outside the state. 

 Of the 53,699 acres in Orissa, 39,376 acres are in the possession of the Sri Jagannath Temple administration while the remaining 14,322 acres are occupied by former caretakers and their heirs, Harichandan said. The issue of encroachment has long been a concern for both the Orissa government and the temple administration.

 The government has decided to take legal steps to free the land from encroachments and sell off unproductive plots and put the sales proceeds in fixed deposits. It has also set up district committees, to be headed by district magistrates, to identify such land and take steps to retrieve the same. 

 The government will appoint a senior OAS officer as deputy administrator to look after the revenue matters of Jagannath Temple in Puri.

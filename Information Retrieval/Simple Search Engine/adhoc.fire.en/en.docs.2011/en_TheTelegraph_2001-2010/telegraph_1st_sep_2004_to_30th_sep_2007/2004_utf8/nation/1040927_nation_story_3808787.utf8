 Siachen on PM talks table

 REUTERS AND OUR BUREAU

 Sept. 26: President Pervez Musharraf has assured Prime Minister Manmohan Singh that Pakistani forces will not seize the Siachen glacier, if Indian troops were to withdraw from it, according to a newspaper.

 The assurance was given by Musharraf in his first face-to-face meeting with Singh in New York on Friday, the News said, quoting unidentified sources. Singh had ?positively responded? to the offer and modalities would be worked out later, the newspaper said.

 Pakistan foreign ministry officials in Islamabad said they could not confirm it.

 More soldiers die in Siachen of altitude sickness and frostbite than in fighting. But the Indian military has been reluctant to pull back forces as it will take years and backbreaking toil to restore a base once it is shifted. Virtually every equipment and weapon system had to be dismantled, airlifted and reassembled on the glacier. Pakistani and Indian forces have been facing off in the icy wastes of the Siachen, 5,500 metres above sea level in north Kashmir for 20 years.

 The two countries have discussed the Siachen dispute many times but India has been reluctant to vacate the peaks fearing that Pakistani troops at lower ground would move up and occupy the glacier.

 The News also said the two leaders had agreed to restore a hotline set up between the Pakistan president and Indian Prime Minister 11 years ago but was never used. The only regularly used hotline between the nuclear-armed rivals is between senior military officials.

 Singh, who took off from New York today, turned 73 and celebrated the occasion in mid-air on way to Geneva. Singh, who is on record as having forgotten his birthday and does not celebrate it, cut a cake in the Air-India flight, Tanjore, with his wife Gursharan Kaur by his side and was greeted by officials and journalists accompanying him on his nine-day tour of Britain and the US.

 President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam sent a bouquet and a message of greetings.

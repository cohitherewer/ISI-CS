The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Bengal goes for big byte

 B.R. SRIKANTH

 Bangalore, Nov. 3: The target is to be among the top three. The time ? a shade over five years.

 Byte-hungry Bengal has gone into overdrive to attract global and Indian IT majors to Calcutta to seal a place among the top three infotech destinations in the country by 2010.

 Tomorrow, IT and environment minister Manab Mukherjee will meet a team of Oracle officials as well as Reliance Group chairman Mukesh Ambani in Mumbai as part of the government?s initiative to invite IT companies to set up shop in the state capital.

 The last three days saw a series of discussions with big guns of a slew of IT companies in Bangalore. Among the companies were Wipro, Sun Microsystems, Texas Instruments (India), Sasken Communications, Igate Global Solutions and NESS Technology.

 ?Wipro will open its new development centre in the Salt Lake Electronics Complex on November 19. We have given them 7.5 acres, but the company has asked us for 50 acres at the New Town (Rajarhat). In two years, Wipro and Wipro Spectramind, its BPO (business process outsourcing) arm, will together employ 6,000 people,? Mukherjee said.

 The minister said Infosys Technologies had told him it intends to send a team to report on infrastructure at the Rajarhat campus, where 600 acres with three million sq. feet of buildings will be developed over the next two years. In addition, 1.3 million sq. feet will soon be available for IT companies at DLF IT Park being constructed there at a cost of Rs 280 crore.

 ?No one can ignore Calcutta now because we offer USP such as best and inexpensive talent, good infrastructure and support from a proactive government,? the minister said.

 Mukherjee said he will discuss with Ambani three key projects: a centre named Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology, a 500-seat call centre and a telecommunication engineering centre with R amp;D facilities.

 According to Mukherjee, the Bengal government has set in motion plans to develop Durgapur, Kharagpur, Haldia and Siliguri as IT destinations. In Durgapur, Haldia and Siliguri, the Software Technology Park of India will soon set up state-of-the-art facilities in addition to the ones in Calcutta and Kharagpur. ?West Bengal will be the third state after Karnataka and Maharashtra to have five STPI facilities,? he said.

 The state?s proactive policies, Mukherjee added, had spurred the growth of the IT industry in recent years. In the last fiscal, the sector accounted for 3.4 per cent of the country?s IT revenues with Rs 1,760 crore compared to revenues of Rs 1,200 crore or less than 1 per cent in 2000-01, he said.

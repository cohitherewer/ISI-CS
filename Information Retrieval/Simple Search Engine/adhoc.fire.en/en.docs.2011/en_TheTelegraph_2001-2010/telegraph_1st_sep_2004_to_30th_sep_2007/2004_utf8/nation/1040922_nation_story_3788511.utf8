 Laloo plays good papa and Santa

 Thiruvananthapuram, Sept. 21: 

 Laloo Prasad Yadav?s dakshin darshan is over 

 but the south will not forget in a hurry the virtual roller 

 coaster ride with the railway minister.

 Railway officials, for one, were on their toes ever since Laloo Prasad kicked off his six-day sojourn by a special train from Tirupati on September 16.

 From Tirupati and Madurai to Chennai, Rameswaram and Kanyakumari, they were answering queries and implementing orders issued from the minister?s salon turned office-on-wheels.

 Today, when Laloo Prasad made his last southern stopover at Thiruvananthapuram Central around 10.30 am, the officials yet again got a taste of their boss? authority.

 The minister and his wife, Bihar chief minister Rabri Devi, jostled their way through a sea of humanity ? curious onlookers and petitioners ? to reach the car only to find their brood of 10, including a grandchild, missing.

 Laloo Prasad immediately jumped out and rushed to the platform, calling out names from eldest daughter Misa?s downwards. In no time, he found them and tugged them along to the car.

 The security personnel, who had never seen a VVIP melt into the crowd and were unsure of the consequences, tried to intervene, only to get an earful from the minister.

 ?I have seen several railway ministers but none as dynamic as him,? said P. Narayanan, public relations officer of the Thiruvananthapuram division of Southern Railway.

 But if the officials got a snub, the people were rewarded with railway double lines, electrification and gauge conversions, and Rs 100 notes for those in rags.

 Reports from Tamil Nadu about his largesse were no exaggeration. Here, too, Laloo Prasad would say ?Madam? and out would flow crisp currencies from Rabri Devi?s purse.

 Priests at the popular Padmanabha Swamy temple in the city were left with pleasant memories of the Laloo Prasad darshan. ?Laloo Prasad never counted the number of currencies neither did the priests bother to,? a witness said.

 The railway minister, however, was businesslike when chief minister Oommen Chandy and forest minister K.P. Viswanathan accorded him a warm welcome at Parassala station, on the state?s southern boundary with Tamil Nadu.

 Chandy presented a 12-point memorandum. A non-committal Laloo Prasad advised the chief minister to make available sufficient land for railway development and then get back to him.

 Chandy later said a detailed meeting would be held at Rail Bhavan in Delhi. The rest of his demands met with the minister?s stock answer: ?We will consider.?

 At a news conference at the state guesthouse here, Laloo Prasad did not lose the opportunity to play to the gallery. Seeing nearly half-a-dozen Left MPs, the minister said: ?The CPM, CPI and the RJD are natural allies.?

 His parting shot was on the bypolls in his home state. ?Pappu Yadav will be the RJD candidate from Madhepura,? he said. Laloo Prasad had quit the seat, one of the two seats he won in the general elections.

 After a visit to Kovalam beach, Laloo Prasad and family took a flight to Delhi at 2.55 pm.

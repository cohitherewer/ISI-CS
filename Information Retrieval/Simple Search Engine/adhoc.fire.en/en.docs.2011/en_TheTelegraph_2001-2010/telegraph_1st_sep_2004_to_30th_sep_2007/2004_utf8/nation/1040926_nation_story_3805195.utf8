 Sadhvi discovers Gandhi?s charkha 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Amritsar, Sept. 25: Uma Bharti invoked Mahatma Gandhi at the conclusion of her 16-day tiranga yatra at the Jallianwala Bagh here today.

 Gandhi?s charkha, she said, encompassed the desire to be self-reliant and offered lessons on swadeshi and self-respect.

 ?I understood the charkha as I have never before, during my yatra. Gandhiji?s concept should be taken as a role model for the development of the country,? Uma told the rally at the final stop of her 3,481-km, seven-state yatra that began from Hubli in Karnataka.

 Former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who was handed a Tricolour by Uma, praised the former Madhya Pradesh chief minister for giving up the post. She had done so following an arrest warrant in a 10-year-old case of national-flag hoisting at Hubli that ended in violence.

 ?People have fought with each other to become mere ministers. But she sacrificed her chair for a noble mission. Her decision can only be termed remarkable,? he said in what appeared to be balm for Uma who had accused the party of belittling her yatra.

 ?Uma?s yatra may have ended today, but the BJP?s yatra for the tiranga?s self-respect will continue forever,? he added.

 Vajpayee said that Congress-ruled Punjab considered hoisting the Tricolour a crime, in a reference to the protests the yatra faced here today, including black-flag demonstrations by two women of Simranjit Singh Mann?s party.

 Blaming the protests on chief minister Amarinder Singh and Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, Uma said: ?Showing black flags to the Tricolour is an insult to the national flag.?

 She denied the yatra was aimed at garnering votes for her party. ?I quit because of principles and would now like to quit politics for two years and travel all across the country spreading the message of the Tricolour and the need for development.?

 Commenting on the ongoing controversy over foreign advisers in the Planning Commission, Uma resurrected Sonia?s foreign origin issue.

 ?If foreigners are not wanted in the Planning Commission, the United Progressive Alliance, too, should not be headed by a foreigner,? she said.

 CBI points Rajiv finger at ?godman?

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 10: The CBI today waved the Jain Commission report at self-styled godman Chandraswami and told a Delhi court that he was under investigation for a suspected role in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination.

 The bureau asked the court to reject Chandraswami?s application that sought the court?s permission to go abroad for two months to deliver a ?spiritual discourse?.

 ?Evidence and material does point an accusing finger towards Chandraswami... and raises a serious doubt regarding his involvement in the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi,? the CBI told metropolitan magistrate V.K. Khanna, quoting from the Jain Commission inquiry report.

 ?One of the allegations under investigation is that Chandraswami had financed the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi,? said the Multi-Disciplinary Monitoring Agency, a unit set up under the CBI in 1998 to follow up leads in the commission report.

 The application, which will now come up for hearing on December 13, was also opposed by the Enforcement Directorate on the grounds that Chandraswami was involved in ?serious economic offences?.

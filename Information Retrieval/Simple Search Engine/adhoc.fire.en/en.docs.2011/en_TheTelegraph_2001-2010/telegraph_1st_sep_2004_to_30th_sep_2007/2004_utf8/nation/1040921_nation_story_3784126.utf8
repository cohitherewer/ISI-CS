 Parthiv ?marriage?

 Ahmedabad, Sept. 20 (PTI): The family of Indian wicket-keeper Parthiv Patel was in for a shock following a media report which said he had got married in a Rajkot court some days ago.

 ?We, including Parthiv, were shocked when we read a report about his marriage to a girl in Rajkot city. However, after going through the court documents, (and checking with) the marriage registrar?s office and the temple (where the wedding was reported to have taken place) we found that there was no truth in the matter,? the cricketer?s uncle, Jagat Patel, said after returning from Rajkot. In Vadodara, Parthiv said: ?I am hardly 20 and have not thought of marriage.?

 New Delhi, Dec. 1: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh stepped in today to halt the war of words between cabinet colleagues Laloo Prasad Yadav and Ram Vilas Paswan.

 10 Janpath, too, joined efforts to repair the rift that the BJP is threatening to make an issue of.

 Singh, who returned from Laos last night, summoned Paswan and told him to restrain from making personal comments on the railway minister as that would give the Opposition a stick to beat the ruling alliance with. The Prime Minister also spoke to Laloo Prasad who assured him he would not precipitate matters.

 Singh told the duo not to drag the Union government into their battle for turf in Bihar and to stick to local issues.

 Rashtriya Janata Dal sources said Laloo Prasad would not press his demand for a probe against Paswan for the ?dubious? Rs 800-crore crane deal the railways signed during 1996-97, provided the Lok Janshakti Party chief stopped making personal attacks on him. Paswan, who holds the chemicals and fertilisers portfolio, was railway minister when the deal was sealed.

 Congress president Sonia Gandhi is away in Mauritius but her political secretary Ahmed Patel spoke to both Paswan and Laloo Prasad, counselling restraint.

 Even as the Prime Minister?s Office and 10 Janpath appear to have succeeded in effecting a temporary truce between the warring Bihar strongmen, BJP parliamentary party spokesperson V.K. Malhotra accused Singh of remaining a mute spectator in the Paswan-Laloo row. 

 He demanded that both ministers be dropped from the cabinet and an investigation ordered into the charges they had made against one another. Malhotra charged Laloo and Paswan with eroding the dignity of Parliament and the cabinet.

 Asked about the BJP?s bid to have a discussion in Parliament on the Paswan-Laloo spat under an adjournment motion on the ground that it ?violated collective cabinet responsibility?, Congress spokesperson Anand Sharma said: ?In our view, it does not fall under collective cabinet responsibility.?

 Paswan confirmed he had met the Prime Minister but Laloo Prasad refused to either confirm or deny the discussion. Instead, he continued to blame Paswan, saying he had started the row, ?calling me chara chor. He called me Ravan and Rabri Mandodari at his Patna rally while his supporters compared him to Ram and his wife to Sita?.

 The LJP leader was angry about Laloo Prasad?s attempt to implicate him in corruption cases. He said he was not worried about the allegation and it was up to the people to believe or not believe it. As a cabinet colleague, the proper thing for him would have been to bring the matter to the notice of Prime Minister before going public, Paswan said.

 Laloo Prasad attacked the media for not ?highlighting the allegations made against L.K. Advani by his former daughter-in-law?. Congress sources believe the BJP and Paswan may not make the ?tainted RJD ministers? an issue as Laloo Prasad has ammunition to silence both.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Pain-killer medicine jumps gun

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi. Sept. 25: Two Indian companies sold a pain-relieving medicine earlier this year without marketing approval from drug licensing authorities, violating national drug laws with the help of officials in two states.

 The cocktail of a new anti-inflammatory drug, aceclofenac, and the anti-fever drug, paracetamol, which some doctors have termed ?irrational?, was in the market several months before it was approved by the drugs controller general of India (DCGI).

 ?State officials and drug companies colluded to violate national drug laws, yet the DCGI is reluctant to act against them,? said Dr Chandra Gulhati, editor of the Monthly Index of Medical Specialities, India, an independent journal that will publish an editorial on the ?unlawful cocktail? later this month.

 Both companies, Aristo Pharmaceuticals and Ipca Laboratories, had started marketing the aceclofenac-paracetamol cocktail by March this year ? Aristo?s Aceclo Plus (batch ML426C) and Ipca?s Zerodol P (batch CCT 22).

 However, the DCGI approved the combination only on June 29, 2004. The DCGI, Ashwini Kumar, told The Telegraph sales before marketing approval would have been ?inappropriate?. Under the law, the DCGI can ban any drug that has not been granted marketing approval.

 An Ipca spokesperson said the company had all required approvals, but refused to explain how the drug was sold before obtaining marketing approvals from DCGI. ?It?s our policy not to comment on such issues,? Harish Kamat said.

 Aristo Pharmaceuticals officials in Mumbai did not return calls. Its branch manager in New Delhi said he could not answer queries on regulatory affairs.

 State drug controllers in Pondicherry and Tamil Nadu had granted permission for the manufacture of the aceclofenac-paracetamol cocktail, ignoring laws that make it mandatory for companies to get marketing approval from the DCGI before see- king permission to manufacture.

 Central government officials say state officials have repeatedly ignored orders from the DCGI. ?We?re trying to correct this situation,? Kumar said.

 It is over four years since the Union government first ordered states not to issue manufacturing licences for drugs that did not have DCGI?s marketing approval. A gazette notification reiterating the order was issued in May 2002.

 However, some states have paid no heed to the orders.

 The Pondicherry state drugs controller said he issued the manufacturing licence for the cocktail ?to encourage industry in Pondicherry, but only after Tamil Nadu had already approved it?.

 A. Sarangapani, the drugs control director in Tamil Nadu, said he had just taken over, but the cocktail may have been approved because aceclofenac finds mention in the British Pharmacopoeia. 

 ?We are now following all rules,? he said. But experts point out that the British Pharmacopoeia has nothing to do with Indian law.

 Some doctors are also questioning the approval of the aceclofenac-paracetamol cocktail by the DCGI.

 ?This combination is not produced anywhere in the world except India,? said Dr Gulhati. 

 ?There is no unbiased, independent data on the safety and efficacy of this combination.?

 Combinations of drugs have to be treated as new drugs and need to go through scientific studies to establish their safety and efficacy.

 ?This is an irrational combination with no obvious advantage of combining the two drugs,? said Dr Ranjit Roy Chaudhury, president of the Society for Promotion of Rational Drugs. 

 ?It would have been wise to have done clinical studies,? he said.

 Asked about the absence of clinical studies, drugs controller Kumar said clinical trials are not required for all combinations. Drug laws do allow a waiver of clinical trials if the individual drugs used to make the cocktail ?have been in wide use for years?. 

 However, aceclofenac is a new drug, approved in September 2003, barely six months before companies began to market its combination with paracetamol.

 Doctors say there are many other irrational combinations in the market that should be banned. 

 ?Irrational combinations can give rise to drug resistant bugs,? said Dr Anupam Sibal, a senior paediatrician and medical director at Apollo Hospital, New Delhi.

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 12: Upholding 

 the legal validity of the two-child norm in a Haryana municipality 

 case, the Supreme Court has said contesting elections was 

 not a fundamental right.

 ?In our view, disqualification on the right to contest an election by having more than two living children does not contravene any fundamental right nor does it cross the limits of reasonability. Rather, it is a disqualification conceptually devised in national interest,? a bench of Chief Justice R.C. Lahoti and Justices G.P. Mathur and P.K. Balasubramanyan said.

 They pointed out that Article 25 (freedom of conscience and free profession, practice and propagation of religion) ?is subject to public order, morality and health?.

 The article ?permits a legislation in the interest of social welfare and reforms, which are part of public order, national morality and collective health of the nation?s people.?

 The court frowned on objections from Muslim members that the law would violate their right to religion. ?No religious scripture or authority has been brought to our notice which provides that marrying less than four women or abstaining from procreating a child from each and every wife in case of permitted bigamy or polygamy would be irreligious or offensive to the dictates of the religion. The Muslim law permits marrying four women. The personal law nowhere mandates or dictates it as a duty to perform four marriages.?

 The judges allowed an exception only in case of twins born after a municipality member already had a child. ?Exceptions do not make rule nor render the rule irrelevant. Validity of the law cannot be tested by abnormal situations.?

 The apex court said population explosion was a ?national and global issue? and justified the priority for policy-oriented legislation.

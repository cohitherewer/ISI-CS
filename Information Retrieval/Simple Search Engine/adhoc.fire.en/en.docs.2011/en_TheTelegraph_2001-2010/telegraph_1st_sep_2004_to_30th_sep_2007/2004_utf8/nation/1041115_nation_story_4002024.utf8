 Atal, Sonia set for date with Speaker

 New Delhi, Nov. 14: With the winter session of Parliament less than a month away, Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee has convened a joint meeting of leaders of the United Progressive Alliance and the Opposition on November 23.

 The meeting will see Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Congress president Sonia Gandhi, chairpersons of the National Democratic Alliance and the UPA, sitting together for the first time to discuss ways of ensuring order and decorum in the House.

 The budget and monsoon sessions were a washout following a spat between Opposition and treasury benches on several issues. Chatterjee has expressed concern over precious time and money being wasted due to the callous attitude of parties. Besides, bills are passed without serious discussion and the quality of debate has also suffered.

 After the prolonged stalemate in Parliament during the two sessions, the Speaker held a series of meetings with leaders across the political spectrum in the last two months.

 On October 26, he held a meeting with Sonia, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, deputy leader in the Lok Sabha Pranab Mukherjee, parliamentary affairs minister Ghulam Nabi Azad, minister of state for parliamentary affairs Suresh Pachouri and Rajya Sabha member Karan Singh. Two days later, Chatterjee met the BJP brass, including Vajpayee and party chief L.K. Advani.

 The non-Congress and non-BJP parties like the CPM, CPI, Samajwadi Party, Janata Dal (United), Rashtriya Janata Dal, DMK, Shiv Sena, ADMK, Telugu Desam Party, MDMK, PMK, RSP, Akali Dal and the Asom Gana Parishad met the Speaker on October 8.

 Almost all parties, including the Congress and the BJP, have assured Chatterjee full cooperation in running the House smoothly.

 Sources said the moment the budget session was washed out, the Speaker consulted Vice-President and Rajya Sabha chairman Bhairon Singh Shekawat and decided to make all efforts to bring the House back into relevance in the eyes of the people.

 Chatterjee is worried about the degeneration of Parliament as an institution that focused on people?s issues and transformed their lives for the better, the sources said.

 He is also disappointed with some members playing to the gallery and the media paying undue attention to unruly scenes in the House, they said.

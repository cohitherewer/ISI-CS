 Gaur banks on ex-CMs for survival

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bhopal/Raipur, Oct. 28: Babulal Gaur will felicitate all former chief ministers of Madhya Pradesh on November 1 in what is regarded as another attempt at survival by the current chief minister.

 Gaur is feeling the heat now that Uma Bharti has returned from her Himalayan sabbatical. There are indications that Uma, who is set to become a BJP national general secretary under .K. Advani?s stewardship, is keen to ?take charge? of Madhya Pradesh.

 If this happens, it could mean the end of Gaur?s free run in the state. A powerful group of BJP MLAs is loyal to Uma and plans to curb the chief minister?s ?freedom?.

 Gaur has chosen Monday?s Madhya Pradesh foundation day to honour Uma Bharti, Digvijay Singh, Sunderlal Patwa, Motilal Vora, Arjun Singh, Shyama Charan Shukla, Kailash Joshi and Govindnarayan Singh. The move is viewed as a ploy to keep friends and foes alike in good humour.

 Sources said Gaur is likely to announce some ?perks? for the elite club. The state is already playing host to former chief ministers who are now part of Chhattisgarh after it was hived off from Madhya Pradesh in November 2000. Shukla and Vora, who now belong to Chhattisgarh, have been permitted to retain palatial bungalows in Bhopal.

 In addition, all former chief ministers have been ?loaned? personal staff at the state?s expense and are treated as state guests during their visit.

 Gaur has said the function has no political overtones. He said he was bound to acknowledge his predecessors? contribution in developing the state. ?What I am doing is just a humble attempt to acknowledge their services,? he said.

 The chief minister?s Chhattisgarh counterpart Dr Raman Singh plans a similar gathering on November 9. Like Gaur, Raman too is on a sticky wicket as many of his BJP colleagues are becoming restless over his ?laidback? style of functioning. Advani?s return as BJP chief has changed the political equations in Raipur as well, prompting former Union minister Ramesh Bais to head for Delhi.

 Raman?s guest list will have one more name than Gaur?s ? that of Ajit Jogi, Chhattisgarh?s first chief minister from 2000-2003. Jogi does not feature in Gaur?s party since he became chief minister only after bifurcation.

 Jogi is currently waging a turf war in the Chhattisgarh Congress. His remark that the Congress was not doing enough as an Opposition party in the state prompted an angry response from septuagenarian Shukla.

 ?Shyama bhaiya? as he is popularly called today mocked Jogi?s credentials as a Congress functionary, saying ?persons who jump from service to higher offices are alien to Congress ethos and culture?. He was referring to Jogi quitting the Indian Administrative Service to become a Rajya Sabha MP in 1988 ? the former bureaucrat has not looked back since. Shukla, the working president of the Chhattisgarh Congress, said he did not need a discourse from Jogi.

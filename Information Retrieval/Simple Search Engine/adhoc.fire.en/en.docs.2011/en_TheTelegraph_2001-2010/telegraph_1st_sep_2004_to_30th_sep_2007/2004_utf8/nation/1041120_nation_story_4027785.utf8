 Arjun throws out Joshi principals

 New Delhi: Human resource development 

 minister Arjun Singh has cancelled appointments of over 

 100 principals in Kendriya Vidyalayas, reports our special 

 correspondent.

 As many as 140 principals were appointed on deputation during Murli Manohar Joshi?s tenure. ?The HRD ministry has cancelled the appointment orders of the principals who were initially taken on deputation and then regularised in violation of KVS rules,? said a ministry note.

 ?A special drive will be launched to fill up the vacancies for the general as well as reserved categories,? the note added. At present, the principals appointed during Joshi?s regime are occupying general posts as well as those reserved for SC/ST candidates.

 According to ministry officials, the policy of regularising those on deputation has created bad blood among vice-principals who often used to be promoted to the top slot. The decision to take people on deputation was made in 1999 when the Kendriya Vidyalayas found that several vice-principals were not suited for the top job.

 The ministry says it will also amend the promotion rules for vice-principals. At present, a person has to have a minimum of three years? service as a vice-principal to qualify for the principal?s post. This is likely to be reduced to one year.

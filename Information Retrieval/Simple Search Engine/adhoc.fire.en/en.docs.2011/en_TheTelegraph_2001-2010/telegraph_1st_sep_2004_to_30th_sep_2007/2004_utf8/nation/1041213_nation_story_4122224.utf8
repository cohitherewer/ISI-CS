 Police all-clear to Mallika

 Ahmedabad, Dec. 12 (PTI): Police have found no evidence against Mallika Sarabhai in the immigration racket case registered against the dancer by a former student, a senior officer said today.

 ?The case registered against her has been converted to a ?C summary? case and this means that the allegations are neither true nor false. Investigation could not yield any evidence against her,? he said.

 The question of withdrawing the case would be considered later, the officer added.

 The police had registered the case of cheating and fraud against Sarabhai and her staff on October 19, 2003, after Manushi Shah lodged a complaint alleging that Sarabhai had promised to take her abroad for cultural shows and taken money from her.

 But, the complainant had said, Sarabhai failed to return the full amount after the show was cancelled.

 The case was initially probed by Naranpura police and handed over to the CID three months ago.

 Dip in numbers alarms Sikhs

 GAJINDER SINGH

 Chandigarh, Sept. 19: Sikhs may soon be asked to shed birth-control methods.

 The Akal Takht, the highest temporal body of the Sikhs, is contemplating issuing a fresh edict for the community following the sharp drop in population revealed in the census report for 1991-2001 released recently. The edict, sources said, could even order Sikhs to shed birth-control methods.

 ?We have been deliberating over the fall in the Sikh population since the report was released. We have also noted with concern that our earlier edict on female foeticide has not produced the desired results, with the male-female ratio continuing to shame us,? said a senior Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee (SGPC) member who did not wish to be named.

 The SGPC, an independent body, besides running gurdwaras, is also entrusted with the task of managing Sikh religious interests. The edict is expected to be issued either before the presidential polls to the committee on September 23 or a few days later.

 Akal Takht jathedar Joginder Singh Vedanti is believed to have held a series of meetings with senior SGPC members over the census report. ?We have remained in constant dilemma since the community?s dismal sex ratio was made public in 2001. The Akal Takht?s edicts are more or less followed religiously by Sikhs but somehow the one banning female foeticide seems to have failed in generating awareness and creating the right atmosphere for the community to grow,? Vedanti said.

 While the decline in population can be attributed to the rising trend of migration into and out of Punjab, there is also the social problem of the Sikh community having one of the lowest sex ratios among the religious communities of the country. Sikhs have a sex ratio figure of only 780 in the 0-6 age group as compared to the community?s national average of 786. Punjab, incidentally, has one of the lowest sex ratios in the country ? 897 females to 1,000 males. While Sikhs contribute largely to the dwindling ratio, Hindus in Punjab are not far behind, as far as a bias towards males is concerned.

 At the same time, there is a parallel trend of Sikh migration to countries like Canada, the US and the UK. An estimated 10 lakh Sikhs live abroad while the population of Sikhs in India is 1.9 crore.

 Sikh sociologists and intellectuals have begun pondering over the decline in the Sikh population. The rising trend of large-scale migration of non-Sikh labourers into the state is being cited as one of the reasons for the fall in the percentage of the Sikh population in Punjab from 62.9 per cent a decade ago to 59.9 per cent now.

 ?We are worried over the migration of labour from other states into Punjab. It is not only lessening job opportunities for local youths but also bringing in cultural and social changes that could harm the community in the long run. We are also ashamed of the falling sex ratio,? said Sikh historian G.S. Dhillon.

 ?The Akal Takht, while issuing an edict, must ensure stringent punishment to those practising female foeticide. While in rural areas the issue has generated awareness, people living in urban areas with access to unscrupulous doctors, must be told that they would face stringent social ostracisation if they continued to indulge in the practice,? he said.

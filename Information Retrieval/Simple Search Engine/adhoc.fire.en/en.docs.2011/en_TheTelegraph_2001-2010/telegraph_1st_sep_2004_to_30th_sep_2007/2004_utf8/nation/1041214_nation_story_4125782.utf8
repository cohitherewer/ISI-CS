 Bakery jailor in court 

 Mumbai, Dec. 13: The superintendent of Arthur Road Jail appeared in court today after the judge wanted to question her in connection with the security of 17 accused in the Best Bakery case imprisoned there.

 Judge Abhay Thipse summoned Swati Sathe after the defence today apprised the court of an alleged threat to the life of the accused.

 According to a report in a daily here, gangster Dawood Ibrahim has hatched a conspiracy to kill them. The report said that to avenge the carnage in the Vadodara bakery, in which 14 people ? including 11 Muslims ? were killed on March 1 and 2, 2002, a member of the Dawood gang had planned to poison the food of the accused after befriending them. But the plan came to light and the accused were moved to a high-security zone, the report added.

 The superintendent said every arrangement had been made to ensure their security.

 Stepping out of the court, she denied that there was any such threat and refused further comment.

 Hepatitis shot for children

 New Delhi, Dec. 12 (PTI): The central government is considering introduction of universal vaccination for children against Hepatitis B, health minister Anbumani Ramadoss has said.

 ?The government has introduced Hepatitis B vaccination in 15 cities and 32 districts. The report of the project is likely to be available early next year,? Ramadoss said here at the inauguration of a five-day conference organised by the Asian Pacific Association for the study of the liver. 

 After the results are available, the government may introduce universal immunisation against the disease, the minister added.

 The government is also planning to make a law on organ transplantation more donor- and recipient-friendly as thousands of people are waiting for liver transplants, he said.

 It is also considering setting up organ banks all over the country on the lines of the one at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences to facilitate and simplify organ transplantation surgeries.

 Regarding stem cell research, the minister said the government was following a policy of promoting it in view of its importance in organ repair.

 Stating that so far the focus had been on curative health, he said the government was now encouraging preventive health care, for which awareness programmes would be launched in a big way. This is also important as there is no vaccine against Hepatitis C, cases of which are rising, particularly in the Northeast and Bengal.

 Clinical trials of an HIV vaccine would begin by January-end in Pune, Ramadoss said.

 The president of the association, S.K. Sarin, said while awareness on diseases like AIDS and tuberculosis was high, few realised the enormity of liver ailments. India has the dubious distinction of being next only to China in the number of Hepatitis B cases.

 ?The burden of treatment of Hepatitis B in China is $11 billion a year, which implies that we need to be extremely attuned to the challenge and the appropriate cost both in financial and human terms,? he said.

 The association is also framing guidelines on hypertension associated with liver, liver cancer and acute liver diseases, Sarin added.

 Cong poll ?mischief? blame 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Oct. 17: Mulayam Singh Yadav, whose Samajwadi Party won seven of the 12 Assembly bypolls in Uttar Pradesh, today fired a salvo at the Congress over the Election Commission?s decision to withhold counting in Karchana and the Mainpuri Lok Sabha seat. 

 The chief minister alleged that some Congress ministers at the Centre had influenced the commission. His nephew Dharmendra Yadav is a candidate at Mainpuri. 

 He said he was keeping Left leaders informed of the developments. ?I have all along been on cordial terms with the Left parties. The same Congress I am supporting at the Centre is playing mischief in Mainpuri. The Left parties should not keep quiet,? he said. 

 Mulayam Singh was confident that his party would win Mainpuri. ?Count the votes a thousand times and we only will win. This is because we have done a lot of development work in the constituency in the last one year,? he said.

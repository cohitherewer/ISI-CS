 Eye on television content

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Chennai, Sept. 11: The Centre plans to set up a quasi-judicial body to ?look into complaints? about the programme content of private television channels, Union information and broadcasting minister S. Jaipal Reddy said here this evening.

 Reddy clarified that the government should have no power to ?censor? the content and said: ?I do not want a minister to have such power? as that would make ?monsters? of them. But, ?we are envisaging establishment of a statutory authority to receive and dispose of complaints against content put out by the satellite channels?, he said.

 The minister said he shared the concerns of some that channels were airing soft porn, especially in their weekend late night broadcasts, but added that the Centre was not mulling censorship of content. Reddy was asked about reports that the Centre had sent showcause notices to 23 private television channels, including some southern channels like Jaya TV, asking why their uplink licences should not be cancelled for failing to submit returns of their ?24-hour broadcasts over the past 90 days?. ?? I am not aware of this, I will check up,? he replied.

 The minister fielded a number of questions after making an initial statement during the course of which he criticised .K. Advani for talking about ?high principles now? on the inclusion of tainted ministers in the Union cabinet. Reddy said Advani?s ?only achievement? in six years as Union home minister was to get charges against him in the Babri Masjid demolition case dropped.

 The minister did not comment when asked if Doordarshan would insist on getting a telecast ?feed? of international cricket matches played in India over the next four years in the wake of the row over allotment of telecast rights. The Zee Network row with ESPN-Star Sports is being heard by Bombay High Court.

 Reddy said as a public broadcaster Doordarshan had a ?responsibility?. ?We would like to ensure that the cricket matches are shown on the terrestrial network. We will take steps to capture the terrestrial rights so that ordinary viewers can view the cricket telecasts,? he added.

 Speaking about CAS, Reddy said the Union government was awaiting the regulatory authority?s report, expected ?in the next few weeks?. He said Doordarshan?s own DTH (direct-to-household) platform, to be launched this month, will not levy a monthly fee like its private channel counterparts.

 The Doordarshan platform will make available 40 channels, including ?Zee, Aaj Tak, Headlines Today, Sun TV and BBC?, which are presently ?free-to-air channels?. Reddy added that some ?pay channels? might also choose to come under its. Doordarshan?s DTH will also be able to provide a platform for 20 radio channels, he said.

 The minister said FM radio would be expanded, adding that the government proposed to cover the entire country by helping setting up 400 FM radio stations in the private sector. But this would not dilute the role of All India Radio.

 Siachen troops to stay put 

 SUJAN DUTTA

 Pranab

 On board Indian Naval Ship Mysore, West Coast, Nov. 17: The cutback in troops in Jammu and Kashmir will be carried out mostly from the counter-insurgency grid and not from the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir, highly placed defence sources have said even as a first column of olive-greens moved out of the Valley just before the Prime Minister landed in Srinagar this morning.

 Pranab Mukherjee has confirmed that the position and level of troops on the Siachen Glacier will not be reviewed following the Prime Minister?s announcement that troop levels in Kashmir will be reduced.

 The defence minister, who was here yesterday for the first day of a four-day western fleet deployment exercise of the Indian Navy, made it clear that despite the Prime Minister?s announcement, the Indian position on Siachen remain unchanged since the defence secretary talks between New Delhi and Islamabad in June this year.

 ?If we vacate and they take over those positions, then what is the proof that we were present there earlier?? Mukherjee said on board the INS Mysore, the second largest warship of the navy.

 Mukherjee made it clear that India and Pakistan were still some distance away from freezing the war on the snowy wastes of Siachen despite the ceasefire along the Line of Control that has lasted a year now, having been extended to the Actual Ground Position Line in the glacier.

 Delhi views any suggestion to de-escalate in Siachen with suspicion and has deftly kept that ?war on the roof of the world? distinct from its peace initiative in Kashmir. Sources in the security establishment say India is wiser after the 1999 Kargil war that sought to ?Siachenise? glacial heights on the Line of Control and was an attempt by Pakistan to interdict the supply lines to Indian troop positions in Siachen.

 Mukherjee said it was important for Pakistan to authenticate its military positions on a map before any pullback in Siachen could be considered. This is an unchanged position since the defence secretary-level talks.

 But, he said, the impasse in Siachen would not cast a shadow on the confidence sought to be built by reducing troops in the strife-torn state, Mukherjee said. He said that military commanders would decide on the numbers of troops required and ?decide as per operational requirements?.

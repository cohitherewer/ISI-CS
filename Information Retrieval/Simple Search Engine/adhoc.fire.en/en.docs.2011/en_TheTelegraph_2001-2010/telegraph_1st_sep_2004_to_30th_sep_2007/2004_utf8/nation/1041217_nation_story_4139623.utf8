 Scanner on Dalmiya votes

 R. VENKATARAMAN

 New Delhi, Dec. 16: The Supreme Court today reserved orders on the election of the Board of Control for Cricket in India held at its general body meeting in Calcutta in September.

 Jagmohan Dalmiya had cast his individual vote and the casting vote as the board chairman resulting in the defeat of Union minister Sharad Pawar and the victory of Ranbir Singh Mahendra.

 ?Dalmiya actually cast three votes,? senior counsel for Netaji Cricket Club, Chennai, Harish Salve told a division bench of Justices N. Santosh Hegde and S.B. Sinha. 

 ?He voted as an individual member, as a representative of the Cricket Association of Bengal and finally, when the votes were tied even after this, he cast his casting vote as chairman to declare Ranbir Singh elected,? Salve said on the concluding day of arguments.

 The court will reopen on January 3 after the winter vacation and a judgment can be expected any time in the first week of the month. The judges said they would ?look into the rules? of the BCCI before deciding whether the chairman can have two votes or even three and also use his casting vote if there is a tie. 

 The judgment would settle this issue for the future and also determine the outcome of the recent elections. The court made it clear at the beginning of the arguments that it will ?order re-election? if ?need be? and will decide on the legality of the polls.

 After senior counsel Siddhartha Shankar Ray for Dalmiya and Abhishek Manu Singhvi for the BCCI concluded their arguments yesterday, senior counsel Fali Nariman commenced arguments today for the Maharashtra Cricket Association (Dhyaneshwar Agashe group) and sought ?fresh elections? as the September polls were a ?farce?. 

 Nariman also suggested to the court to appoint a supervisor so that the ?unsavoury scenes? during the September elections are not repeated.

 Singhvi opposed the suggestion and contended that BCCI rules specifically permitted the chairman to vote in the general body meeting like any other member and in addition have a casting vote in the rare instance of a tie. ?Dalmiya has done nothing wrong. On the other hand, he has gone by the rule book,? Singhvi told the court.

 Salve argued that ?the entire election process and the way Dalmiya acted by first casting his vote like a member and then as a chairman has given an unsavoury taste to the entire event?. At this, Ray said Salve?s father (N.K.P. Salve) was the BCCI president who chose Dalmiya to succeed him. ?I condone my father?s fault,? Salve replied tongue-in-cheek. 

 He asked the court to appoint ?somebody conversant with law? and urged for a direction for fresh elections while restraining the present board from finalising any commercial contract.

 Nariman said the only reason why Dalmiya adjourned the annual general meeting was to perpetuate himself as the president because a Chennai court had restrained the meeting from taking up two issues. The first pertained to Dalmiya?s appointment as the patron-in-chief of the board and the second related to his nomination as the board?s representative to the International Cricket Council, he added.

 Singhvi said the argument had no basis as under the BCCI rules, Dalmiya could have simply adjourned the meeting on the basis of the court orders and still have continued as the president without having to go through the election process. ?He wants to step down immediately if the Supreme Court passes an order allowing conclusion of the AGM,? Singhvi said.

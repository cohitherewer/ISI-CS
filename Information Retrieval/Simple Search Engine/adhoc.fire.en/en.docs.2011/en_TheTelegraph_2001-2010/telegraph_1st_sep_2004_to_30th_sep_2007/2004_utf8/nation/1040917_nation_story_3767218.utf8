 Bengal plans PC park 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Sept. 16: Bengal was late in catching the software bus, but the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government is determined not to commit the same mistake in the hardware industry. 

 Information technology minister Manabendra Mukherjee today announced the government was toying with the idea of setting up a hardware park with the objective of reaping first-mover advantage. 

 ?Creating a manufacturing hub for the eastern region will help develop indigenous brands, besides increasing penetration of personal computers in the region,? said Mukherjee during the inauguration of Xenitis Infotech?s office in central Calcutta. 

 He added that the government has got in touch with some major players in the hardware industry and has invited suggestions to draw up the broad contours of the project. 

 ?We are also expecting a breakthrough in the manufacture of cellular components soon,? said the minister, who was in Delhi earlier this week to explore such possibilities. 

 According to him, the hardware technology park will act as a platform to encourage local entrepreneurs and he complemented Xenitis for taking the lead in hardware manufacturing. 

 Recognising the abundance of technical talent in the state and cost advantage, experts have hinted that Bengal can emerge as a major player in the hardware industry. 

 The city-based hardware manufacturing company has already taken a giant leap after tying up with Chinese major Unitech. 

 During the function, Xenitis director Santanu Ghosh said: ?We have invested Rs 250 crore in the unit and we expect it to be operational by January 2005. According to our agreement, Unitech will bring in the investments in the subsequent phases.? 

 Ghosh said the present demand of 2,500 personal computers per month would go up to 10,000 per month once the company was ready to do business beyond the eastern region. 

 Looking at the future, the company has set a target of producing around 100,000 computers every month and is expecting a revenue of around Rs 500 crore in the first year. By 2007, it is looking at a figure of Rs 1,000 crore. 

 Rolling out the company?s plans for the future, Ghosh said the plant will generate employment for 1,000 people and the headcount would touch 3,000 over the next two years. 

 The company has plans to tap the premium segment of the market as well and manufacture laptops. ?But the target will be the home segment and we will be selling laptops under Rs 40,000,? said Ghosh.

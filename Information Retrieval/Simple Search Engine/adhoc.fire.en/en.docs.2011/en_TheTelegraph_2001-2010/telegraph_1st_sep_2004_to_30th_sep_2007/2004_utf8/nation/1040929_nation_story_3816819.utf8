The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Call for Pak shrine safety

 Chandigarh, Sept. 28: India today hoped Pakistan would take ?necessary measures? for the protection of the Nankana Sahib gurdwara in Lahore, reports our correspondent.

 On Saturday, students of the state-run Guru Nanak Dev Degree College located on the gurdwara?s premises had stormed it in retaliation to a government panel?s recommendation to hand the college to the Nankana Sahib managing committee for use as a guesthouse for pilgrims.

 ?We have seen reports of the incident at gurdwara Nankana Sahib. We hope that the government of Pakistan will take the necessary measures for the protection of this holy shrine,? foreign ministry spokesman Navtej Sarna said in Delhi today.

 The Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee decided to send a team to inquire into the attack. ?The attack has not only hurt Sikh sentiments but could also have an adverse impact on the peace talks between the two nations,? its chief Jagir Kaur said in Amritsar. Akali Dal chief Parkash Singh Badal wrote to the President and the Prime Minister and demanded that Sikhs? rights and their shrines? safety be part of bilateral discussions.

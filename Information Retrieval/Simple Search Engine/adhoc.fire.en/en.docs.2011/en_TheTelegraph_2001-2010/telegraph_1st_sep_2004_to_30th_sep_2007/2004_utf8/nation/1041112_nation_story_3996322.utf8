 Pope in Diwali plea for children

 New Delhi: Pope John Paul II on Thursday 

 urged Hindus and Catholics worldwide to work together and 

 help the underprivileged and innocent victims of war and 

 violence, reports our special correspondent.

 ?During this season of Diwali, as you strive to overcome darkness through light, evil through goodness and hatred through love, I would like to propose to you, as one of your Christian friends, that we focus our attention on the evils in our society that afflict children,? the Pope said in a Diwali message released by the Vatican. 

 Greeting Hindus worldwide, the Vatican asked them to suggest ?what could be done to give children their rightful place in society. ?Our children are our future; they are the future of humanity,? the message said.

 ?Collaboration between Hindus and Christians with special regard to children? is one of the themes the Vatican has adopted this year.

 The Diwali message recalled Jesus Christ?s words that we must be ?like children? to enter ?the kingdom of heaven?.

 Nafisa fiance gets breather

 Mumbai (PTI): Bombay High Court on Thursday 

 granted anticipatory bail to businessman Gautam Khanduja, 

 who fears arrest in a case registered against him for allegedly 

 abetting the suicide of his fiancee and former beauty queen 

 Nafisa Joseph.

 The judge hearing Khanduja?s plea ordered that in the event of his arrest, he may be released on providing a surety of Rs 25,000. The court also restrained him from leaving the city without permission. Khanduja had moved the high court after the sessions court rejected his bail plea.

 Nafisa?s father lodged a police complaint against Khanduja on September 30 after his daughter committed suicide on July 29. Apprehending arrest, Khanduja had moved court for anticipatory bail.

 Denying charges of abetting the suicide, Khanduja had pleaded that at the time of the incident, he was not with the deceased in her flat. 

 Nafisa was with her close friend Poonam Malhotra and her trusted maid Durga, he added. Khanduja relied on media reports to suggest that Durga had witnessed heated arguments between Nafisa and her mother before she committed suicide.

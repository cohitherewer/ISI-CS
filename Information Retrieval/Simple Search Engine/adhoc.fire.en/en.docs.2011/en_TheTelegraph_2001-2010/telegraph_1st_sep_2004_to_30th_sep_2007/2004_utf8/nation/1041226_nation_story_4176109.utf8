 Body not fully burnt

Hyderabad, Dec. 25: The body of P.V. Narasimha 

Rao appeared not fully burnt in a coverage by local television channels tonight. 

They showed rib bones and parts of the skull.

 One of the late evening visitors to the cremation ground told the channels that it was a shame neither officials nor family members waited till the body was fully burnt. 

 Family members and state government officials later rushed to the spot. The pyre was lit again and some rituals were performed. Police have set up pickets at the site, which is drawing people in hordes.

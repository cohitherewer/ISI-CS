 Fish lifeline for Dal 

 MUKHTAR AHMAD

 Srinagar, Oct. 2: The Jammu and Kashmir government is relying on fish to breathe some life back into the polluted Dal Lake.

 Frustrated with the failure of human efforts to check the popular tourist spot?s alarming ecological degradation, the state fisheries department has turned to grass carp, a fish species of Chinese origin.

 The 6 kg-plus heavy fish is known to eat weeds equal to 2-3 per cent of its body weight daily. This, the department believes, could be the answer to regenerating the weed-choked lake that also suffers from silting and biotic interference (contaminants from hotels on the bank and houseboats).

 Dal Lake, situated in the heart of summer capital Srinagar and a favourite with newly-weds and well-heeled foreign and domestic tourists, is a major contributor to the state?s tourism income. Its main attraction is the scores of houseboats.

 The lake is also believed to serve as the ?lungs? for the city of 12.5 million people.

 The ?magic fish? was introduced on an experimental basis two years ago after a specially-constituted lakes and waterways authority failed to make a difference despite adequate funds and legal teeth, by virtue of being a statutory organisation.

 But there is a catch. Grass carps release a sizeable amount of phosphates as part of their metabolic activity.

 ?Phosphates are poisonous for other life forms (in the lake and affects water quality) and their concentration must not exceed a certain level in the water body,? said state fisheries director Nissar Ahmad Qureshi.

 ?We have introduced the fish species on an experimental basis in cages so that we are doubly sure about the overall impact of an exotic species in the lake. The lake?s normal bio-sensitivity will have to be appreciated before the fish is firmly homed there,? he added.

 Excess de-weeding, too, could hurt another fish species ? common carp, Qureshi said. ?The common carp (introduced here from China in the early 1950s) lays eggs that stick to the weeds before hatching. Without weeds, the common carp might be threatened,? he added.

 There is more bad news even though the grass carp, once established in the lake, is expected to serve as both ecological regenerator and food for humans.

 The fish eats the tender iodine-rich roots of the lotus, symbolic of Kashmir?s history and economy and part of the state?s official emblem of lotus afloat in water.

 The plant?s tender fibre-rich stems, locally called nadru, is a cherished vegetable for the residents, who both sell it for a living and eat it cooked with almost anything, including mutton, fish, radish and pulses.

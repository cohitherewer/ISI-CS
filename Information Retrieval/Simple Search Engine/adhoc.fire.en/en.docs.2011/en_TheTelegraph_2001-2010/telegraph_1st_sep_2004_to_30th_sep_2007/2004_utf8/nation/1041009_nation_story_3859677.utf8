 Bengal opts for school grades

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 8: Taking a leaf out of British books, the Bengal government has decided to introduce grades in secondary schools in the state beginning next year, which it hopes will minimise the mad race for marks.

 ?We want to follow the British example and make school education less exam-centric,? state school education minister Kanti Biswas said today.

 Biswas was speaking at an interactive session on ?Calcutta and UK: Sharing experiences in education? with teachers and educationists organised by the British Council. British minister for schools David Miliband was present. The grading system is applied in most Western nations. 

 Grades will initially be introduced in Classes VI-VIII in all schools affiliated to the state-controlled West Bengal Board of Secondary Education. The government will consider extending it to the Madhyamik and Higher Secondary levels depending on the feedback it receives from teachers and students, the minister said. 

 The practice, already introduced at the primary level, will be gradually extended to all classes. Till then, grades will coexist with the existing system of awarding marks.

 While the Higher Secondary councils of states like Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra already have grades in place, in Bengal, only schools under the Central Board of Secondary Education and the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations offer the system.

 The National Council for Educational Research and Training recommends that students should not be awarded marks as it increases exam-related tension and introduces cut-throat competition.

 Miliband said primary schools in Britain had a very good student-teacher ratio. ?We have one teacher for every 18 students. However, what we lack is that parents of schoolchildren there have very little aspirations. They don?t expect their child to go very far, which is why most children don?t take up higher education,? he said.

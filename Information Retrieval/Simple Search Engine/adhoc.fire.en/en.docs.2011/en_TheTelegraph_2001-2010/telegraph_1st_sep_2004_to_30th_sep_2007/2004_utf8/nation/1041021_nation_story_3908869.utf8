 Acolytes growl at Ambedkaroffice shift

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Oct. 20: At a time when the Congress is wooing the Dalits back into its fold, admirers of B.R. Ambedkar are up in arms against the United Progressive Alliance government for asking the Ambedkar Foundation office to move from Lutyen?s Delhi to Alipur Road in the old city. 

 The foundation used to function from 24, Ashoka Road, but moved to 15, Janpath, recently due to construction of the metro railway. 

 P.S. Krishnan, the seniormost IAS officer and former secretary of the ministry of welfare, has written to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi, pleading that the foundation be allowed to function from its present office. 

 CPI leader D. Raja, too, has requested Singh to intervene. Krishnan said he plans to take up the matter with Dalit leaders Buta Singh, Venkataswamy, Hanumanthappa, Lok Janshakti Party leader Ram Vilas Paswan and former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Digvijay Singh, a ?Dalit sympathiser?. 

 Shifting to far-flung Alipur Road will hinder the foundation?s work as it has to co-ordinate between various government and non-government agencies. 

 Dalit activists and Ambedkar?s followers see the move as ?an insult? to the Dalit icon. They said even the BJP did not think of shunting it out to the old city. 

 ?There are quite a few memorials of Nehru and Mahatma Gandhi in Delhi, will they (Congress leaders) shift any of these offices to Old Delhi? When it comes to Ambedkar, why this attitude?? asked a Dalit activist. 

 They said the urban development ministry told them that since Ambedkar spent his last few days at 56, Alipur Road, the government has taken over the property and converted it into a memorial and believes the foundation should function from there. 

 A source said the government wants 15, Janpath, to house the proposed commission on socially and economically backward sections of religious and linguistic minorities. The commission has not yet started functioning; even its members have not been decided.

 Left wants UPA to deliver

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 9: The Left will urge the United Progressive Alliance government to get down to ?serious work? on assurances made in its common minimum programme.

 ?The government has now been in office for 100 days. It is now time for them to act,? CPI leader D. Raja said.

 Leaders of four Left parties met today and identified several issues they want to raise at the UPA-Left co-ordination committee meeting later this month.

 The Left parties are pressuring the government to introduce the National Employment Guarantee Act, a comprehensive legislation for agricultural workers and a national project to ensure safe drinking water for all.

 ?These are issues that concern 90 per cent of the population. We would like to know when the government is planning to bring (in) the Employment Guarantee Act, what shape it is planning to give it and the districts it is going to cover,? Raja said.

 Also on the Left agenda will be the recent exim policy announced by commerce and industry minister Kamal Nath. ?We believe some of its aspects will harm our industry,? a Left leader said.

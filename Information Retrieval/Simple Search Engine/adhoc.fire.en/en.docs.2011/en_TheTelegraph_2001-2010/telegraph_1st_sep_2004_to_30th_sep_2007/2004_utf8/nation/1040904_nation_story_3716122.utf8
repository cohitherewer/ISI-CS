 CBI buries Dubey probe

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Sept. 3: The CBI today formally consigned the Satyendra Dubey murder case, which had raised a nationwide outcry, to the flames.

 The investigating bureau has concluded that the IIT-trained engineer was killed for robbery and not by vested interests for writing to the PMO on rampant corruption in the Golden Quadrilateral highway project. 

 The CBI today filed its chargesheet against the three accused all small-time criminals in Gaya before special judicial magistrate Sanjay Singh here. The magistrate ordered that the trio be produced before court next week.

 The bureau had arrested Udai Kumar, Mantu Kumar and Pinku Ravidas in June. Since then, they have been in judicial custody. 

 Charges under Sections 302 (murder), 394 (robbery) and 34 of the Indian Penal Code, besides Section 27 of the Arms Act, have been pressed against the three.

 Dubey, who was a manager in the Golden Quadrilateral Highway Project of the National Highway Authority of India, was murdered on the night of November 27 last year. He was returning to his Gaya home from the railway station in a rickshaw.

 According to the CBI, some youths stopped Dubey and asked him to part with the cash he was carrying. When he refused to comply, he was shot from close range. The killers escaped with Dubeys belongings, which the sleuths later recovered.

 A few months before his murder, Dubey had written to then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayees office with details of corruption in the highway project. The engineer had, in his letter, specifically requested that his identity be kept secret.

 Charges against the Prime Ministers Office of leaking the details of the letter and Dubeys identity had led to an uproar. 

 The PMO denied the charges. A debate also raged over the need for a whistle blowers law, whereby the identity of those who rip the lid off corruption could be protected.

 The heat generated was such that the CBI director was compelled to make a trip to Gaya and Patna, where he promised that he had assigned the probe to the agencys best sleuths. 

 Additional police superintendent Vijay Kumar was probing the case with other handpicked CBI sleuths.

 Dubey, an IIT-Kanpur graduate, had opted for government service when most youths go for better paying private sector jobs. His associates said he was a dedicated officer who wanted to serve society.

 Antaryamis, not as fortunate

 GAJINDER SINGH

 Oct. 20: The tale of the three lucky Indian truck drivers has put in the shade the story of two others who never had a brush with luck.

 Kulwant Singh, 52, of Madara village in Jalandhar and Mandeep Singh, 27, of Pandori Kad village in Hoshiarpur, Punjab, died two months apart early this year while transporting supplies for the US army in Iraq.

 Unlike Sukhdev Singh, Antaryami and Tilak Raj, who were set free by their Iraqi captors after 42 tense days, Kulwant and Mandeep did not get a chance.

 Kulwant was killed in an ambush by Iraqi militants on April 23, two months after he had first left for Kuwait. Mandeep was shot dead along with two US soldiers in the truck cabin on June 20, about a year after he left for Kuwait, in Mehmoodia while returning from Baghdad. Both were earning over Rs 30,000 a month.

 Back home in Punjab, tears refuse to dry in the two homes about 50 km apart.

 The ordeal started with the delay in getting back the bodies. ?We got his body 23 days after he died,? said Kulwant?s wife Daljeet Kaur.

 Mandeep?s body, too, was received after 23 days following the intervention of the office of Lok Sabha deputy Speaker Charanjit Singh Atwal with the Kuwaiti authorities.

 ?Where shall I go now with my two daughters and son?? Kulwant?s wife asks.

 More than five months after he died, Daljeet is still trying to secure papers to prove her relationship with her husband and a power of attorney in favour of the Indian embassy in Kuwait ?to explore possibilities of compensation? from Kulwant?s employer, Altunia Transport Company.

 ?The Indian embassy had sent us a letter No. 436/54/2004 dated July 13, 2004, asking us to send them the papers,? said Kulwant?s undergraduate daughter Amninder.

 ?We go to the court, the DC?s (district commissioner?s) office and the patwari in the morning and come back empty handed in the evening. This is our routine after papaji died,? she added.

 The eldest of three children, Amninder now has to shoulder the responsibility of the family, including sister Navjot and brother Harjinder. ?If they quit (studies), that will be the end of their careers. Papaji used to dream of a good future for all of us,? she said.

 With the only income coming from the family?s 4 acres leased out to others, Daljeet and her children were looking to the compensation from the employer.

 At Mandeep?s place, his father rued the fate of his son. ?I had to arrange Rs 70,000 to send Mandeep. He would not have died had another driver not fallen ill,? Joginder Singh said, clutching Mandeep?s framed picture to his chest.

 ?Surinder (Kaur, the mother) is still too shocked to even mention his name,? he added.

 The body was accompanied from Iraq by KGL employee Pritpal Singh as Mandeep?s employer, Jasmin Transport Company, was part of KGL before they split. The trucker trio was working for KGL.

 For compensation, Mandeep?s family has got ready a fresh set of papers to send to the company after it rejected the first set. His father had to go to the secretariat in Chandigarh to get the papers made when the job could have been done at a much lower level.

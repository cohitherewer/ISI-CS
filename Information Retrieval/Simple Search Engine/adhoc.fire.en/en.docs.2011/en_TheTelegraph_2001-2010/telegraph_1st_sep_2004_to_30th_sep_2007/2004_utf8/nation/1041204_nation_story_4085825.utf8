 ?Letter? bump on Uma road

 KAY BENEDICT

 New Delhi, Dec. 3: A section of second-rung leaders in the BJP has objected to a move to reinstate Uma Bharti who was suspended from the party on November 10 for defying the leadership in front of the media.

 BJP president L.K. Advani was to announce the revocation of Uma?s suspension today. 

 But a decision on Uma has been deferred following the publication of ? in some sections of the press ? a confidential letter she is purported to have written to Advani.

 Uma claimed that the letter, which reportedly castigates the second-line leaders, is fake.

 Uma, who threatened to take legal action against media organisations circulating ?the fake? letter, was incommunicado today, but had a meeting with Ashok Singhal, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad?s international working president. 

 Advani has not commented whether the letter is genuine or not.

 Uma, who had returned to the capital after her brief sanyas at Kedarnath, had called on Advani last evening and expressed regret for her conduct. However, the controversy over the letter had already erupted. 

 Advani did not make any announcement on her rehabilitation. Uma also cancelled a trip she was to make to Chennai to empathise with arrested Kanchi seer Jayendra Saraswati. She met Advani today, too.

 Some second-rung leaders, including M. Venkaiah Naidu and Pramod Mahajan, spoke to Advani over phone and conveyed their displeasure at what they felt was Uma?s latest bid to sully their image, according to sources. Unconfirmed reports said Naidu, who is in Kerala, had threatened to quit if the suspension is revoked. His feelings, sources said, have also been conveyed to the RSS leadership.

 Arun Jaitley downplayed the controversy, saying Advani has not got any ?confidential letter? from Uma. He also dismissed as baseless reports that the second-line leaders have threatened to resign. ?I have not resigned, neither am I going to resign,? he said. 

 The young leaders are of the view that the purported letter is an act of indiscipline. ?How can we work with a person in our team who has targeted almost the entire second line of leadership?? asked one.

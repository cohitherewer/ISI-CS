 Sheila settles in Sonia?s circle

 AYSWARIA VENUGOPAL 

 Sheila: In the loop

 New Delhi, Sept. 13: The 

 latest power address in Delhi: Congress Crescent. 

 It is not on any map, but a roundabout in the heart of Lutyen?s Delhi, over which 10 Janpath presides, could easily be renamed ?Congress Crescent?. 

 Joining Congress president Sonia Gandhi at the circle is senior Congress leader Sheila Dikshit. 

 The longest-serving chief minister of Delhi will move into 3, Motilal Nehru Place ? diagonally across from 10 Janpath ? vacated recently by Vijai Kapoor, the longest-serving Lieutenant Governor of Delhi. 

 Adjacent to Sonia?s residence is 24 Akbar Road, the Congress headquarters; flanked by 10 Janpath on the right and Dikshit?s new home on the left. Looking out on the roundabout is the new office of the National Advisory Council at 2, Motilal Nehru Place.

 Sonia is the chairperson of the council, set up to advise the government on the implementation of the common minimum programme of the United Progressive Alliance. 

 The sprawling Type VIII bungalow ? one of the best on offer ? that Dikshit will occupy next month would be more fitting for the second-term chief minister than her present modest accommodation at AB 17, Mathura Road. 

 The fact that she is getting a Type VIII bungalow after nearly six years in office is a huge victory as the capital?s ministers have limited accommodation options. 

 Now, Delhi?s superstitious power circle is waiting and watching what Dikshit will do with the address of her new residence. 

 The chief minister?s lucky number is 8. Her present house number is 17 ? 1+7=8 ? and her car number is 8. Aides close to Dikshit say the number of her house was changed to meet her preference and the same might be done again. Maybe 8, Congress Crescent? 

 Former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee recently changed the address of his new bungalow to 6-A from 8 Krishna Menon Marg after a special request to the central public works department. 

 Though Dikshit is not known to succumb often to superstition, it will weigh on her mind that Kapoor, now a part of the BJP think tank, had to contend with the BJP?s loss in the general elections and CBI raids on top Delhi Development Authority officials. 

 Whether the number will change only the future will tell, but not much else seems to be changing in the bungalow. Except touching up the parquet flooring, Dikshit does not have any grand renovation plans and wants to preserve its simple elegance. 

 The CPWD has a deadline of September 30 to finish the work after which the chief minister will move in. 

 Unlike her earlier cramped house, this bungalow has five bedrooms, huge gardens, servants? quarters and floodlit premises. Better still, it is just paces off the party shrine ? the house of Sonia Gandhi.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Top rung for city judges

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 18: The Supreme Court collegium of judges headed by Chief Justice R.C. Lahoti has recommended to the Centre appointments and transfer of eight judges, including two of Calcutta High Court, to different high courts in the country.

The Calcutta High Court judges recommended for elevation 

are A.N. Ray and Altamas Kabir.

 Ray, who forced the Bengal government to take cognisance that the trial court that sentenced Dhananjoy Chatterjee to death for rape and murder had granted bail in a similar case, has been recommended for elevation as Allahabad High Court chief justice.

 Kabir, recommended for the post of chief justice of Punjab and Haryana High Court in Justice B.K. Roy?s place, ensured that the state government and civic authorities committed themselves to address the problem of ill-maintained roads in Calcutta. 

 In all, four promotions and four transfers have been recommended by the collegium, which met last weekend to finalise the shuffle and sent its proposals today to the Union law ministry. 

 Among the others are chief justice of Uttaranchal High Court V.S. Sirpurkar, whose name has been suggested for chief justice of Calcutta High Court, and Madras High Court chief justice B. Subhashan Reddy.

 Justice Reddy, recommended for transfer to Kerala High Court as chief justice, recently faced a hostile bar after he enforced a ?code of conduct? for lawyers on strike and also gave a memorandum to the Chief Justice of India. Allahabad High Court judge Markandey Katju will replace Reddy.

 Roy, the chief justice of Punjab and Haryana High Court, has been recommended for transfer to Patna High Court. He had recently faced the ire of a majority of the high court?s judges who went on unprecedented mass leave after he wanted disciplinary action against them for taking membership of clubs involved in land cases in the same court. 

Kerala High Court Chief Justice N.K. Sodhi has been 

recommended for transfer to Karnataka High Court. Kerala High Court judge Cyriac 

Joseph?s name has been suggested for elevation as chief justice of Uttaranchal 

High Court.

 ?These recommendations have been sent to the Union law ministry, which will in turn send the file to the President... after getting the nod from the Prime Minister?s Office,? an official source said. 

 Bar association post

 Eminent jurist and Rajya Sabha MP Fali S. Nariman has been elected president of the Bar Association of India.

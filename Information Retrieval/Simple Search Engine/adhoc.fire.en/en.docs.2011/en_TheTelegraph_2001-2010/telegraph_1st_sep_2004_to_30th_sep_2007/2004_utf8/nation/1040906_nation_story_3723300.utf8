 Patil Manipur mission flops

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Imphal, Sept. 5: Union home minister Shivraj Patil today promised to very carefully consider the demand for withdrawal of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act from Manipur, but the organisations leading the agitation were anything but mollified.

 Patil, who met a seven-member team from the working committee of the organisations, told the media after the nearly hour-long meeting that the onus was on Parliament to take a decision on the armed forces act, based on Delhis suggestions. I am only one member of the cabinet. It needs to be discussed with my colleagues in the cabinet, and also by Parliament.

 The Apunba Lup, which is co-ordinating the statewide agitation, refused to settle for anything less than the immediate withdrawal of the legislation. Emerging from the meeting with Patil, a member of the delegation, . Umakanta, said the home ministers assurance was not enough to call off the campaign.

 We are not happy with the response of the home minister, and we will continue our agitation. The home ministers response to our one-line demand withdrawal of the act was not positive. The Centre is employing delaying tactics, he said.

 Patil separately met army officials and leaders of political parties . He said there were three views on the act. One opinion is that it should go, the second is it should stay and the third is it should be reviewed. We will carefully consider these opinions before taking the final decision. 

 The home minister urged the Apunba Lup to continue negotiating with either the state government or the Centre. I came here to invite them to hold talks with the government, he said. 

 The streets of Imphal were desolate when Patil arrived because of the dawn-to-dusk general strike separately announced by the 32 organisations and the outlawed Revolutionary Peoples Front. 

 After reaching Imphal airport about two-and-a-half hours later than scheduled, Patil and chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh drove straight to Raj Bhavan. 

 As the home minister took stock of the situation, another drama unfolded behind the scenes. Dissenters in the ruling Secular Progressive Front coalition stepped up the oust-Ibobi campaign, projecting Thoudam Devendra Singh as an alternative. At least 20 of them are Congress legislators.

 A delegation will leave for New Delhi on Wednesday to convince the party high command about the need for a leadership change, a member of the anti-Ibobi camp said.

 The group is unhappy over the manner in which the chief minister has handled the situation. That Ibobi Singh has yet to meet Manoramas family is being held against him. Political leaders from Delhi have visited her house, but our chief minister hasnt, the Ibobi baiter said.

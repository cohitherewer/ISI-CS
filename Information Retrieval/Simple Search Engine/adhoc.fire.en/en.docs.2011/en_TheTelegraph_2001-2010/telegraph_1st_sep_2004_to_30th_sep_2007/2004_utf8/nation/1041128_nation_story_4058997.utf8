 Deputy denies Kanchi tussle

 M.R. VENKATESH

 Kancheepuram, Nov. 27: 

 Junior acharya Vijayendra Saraswati today silenced all whispers 

 of a power struggle in the Kanchi mutt, declaring 

 the jailed seer was still the institution head and would 

 return to lead it once again.

 In a message to mutt devotees, he came out strongly in support of his guru and said the case against Jayendra Saraswati ? in Vellore jail in connection with a temple manager?s murder ? had been trumped up with malicious intent.

 ?I do not have any doubt that a case with a malicious intention has been foisted on my Guru, who has been installed (in the Kanchi Peeta) by my Parama Guru, Sri Maha Periyava?? the message said.

 This is the first time the junior pontiff has come out in support of the seer since his return from Mehboobnagar after the November 11 arrest.

 Sources said the message he was sending out was clear ? that he did not wish to get locked in a power struggle with his guru. Although he was picked as the seer?s successor in the mid eighties, mutt sources are undivided that Jayendra Saraswati ?continues to be the peetathipathi (mutt head)?.

 The junior acharya acknowledged the mutt was going through a ?testing phase?. But he added: ?I am confident that my Guru (Sri Jayendra Saraswati) will continue to strive for the larger cause of humanity and lead us in the path well laid by Sri Adi Shankara?.?

 Sources said the junior acharya had wished to call on the seer in jail for a ?frank talk? but had been blocked by mutt manager Sundaresa Iyer on grounds that it would defy ?rules and practices?.

 As of now, the aim of the mutt?s crisis managers appears to be to ensure no cracks show up in the venerated spiritual seat, which ?external forces? could exploit to ?destroy? it and take over its huge properties.

 Sources said this was why support was being voiced for the seer even after some Tamil magazines and a private TV channel splashed his ?shocking confessions? in custody.

 ?In 10 minutes, my whole life was ruined,? the seer reportedly cried before the officer probing the murder.

 Police refused to confirm the contents of the seer?s purported statement. Discounting the report as ?somewhat imaginative?, an officer said: ?Only the chief investigating officer quizzing the acharya knows what he had confessed.?

 The Kanchi mutt, too, issued a strong disclaimer tonight. ?Such irresponsible news items not only cause irreparable damage to the reputation of His Holiness and the Kanchi Mutt, but also hurt the sentiments of the devotees,? Iyer said.

 Appealing to the media to refrain from ?malicious reporting?, he asked: ?It is supposed to be a secret police custody interrogation, how can it come out??

 Kargil details to be made public

 New Delhi (PTI): The government is likely 

 to make public some of the thus-far secret 18 appendices 

 to the Kargil review committee report, which has, however, 

 been published.

 ?Whatever can be released to the public shall be released,? national security adviser J.. Dixit said on Saturday at the launch of a book dedicated to security expert K. Subrahmanyam, who headed the committee set up to review the Kargil conflict in 1999.

 Some of the appendices give ?graphic details? about Indian security issues, including its nuclear programme, said journalist B.G. Verghese, who was a member of the committee.

 However, Dixit did not give any time frame for the publication of the appendices.

 The main report, which analyses events leading up to the Kargil conflict, has already been released in the form of a book.

 Dixit said the national security council (NSC) had been meeting regularly for the last four months to take stock of India?s security concerns.

 ?The NSC has taken a deliberative role and is not limited only to being a briefing body anymore,? he said.

 Study on red tide mooted

 Thiruvananthapuram (PTI): The Kerala 

 government has decided to conduct a detailed study of the 

 ?red tide? phenomenon found in the sea off the coast here 

 resulting in a stench and making people who breathed the 

 foul air sick.

 Health minister K.K. Ramachandran said after a high-level meeting of officials on Sunday that the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute and the Mysore-based Centre for Food Technology and Research Institute will be asked to study the phenomenon in detail. 

 Ramachandran said it could be officially confirmed whether consumption of seafood was safe only after the government received results of studies conducted by local experts on Monday.

 A total of 222 people have so far been hospitalised in and around the city in the last two days, of which 113 have been discharged. Eighty-nine people are being kept under observation in hospitals. The minister said the situation was under control and preliminary reports from experts suggested that the red tide was a common phenomenon.

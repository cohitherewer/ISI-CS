The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Flight from fear island

 OUR BUREAU 

Calcutta, Dec. 26: On the 10th day of their 

dream vacation, the Duttas were woken up early this morning by a rat-a-tat on 

the door of their fourth-floor room in a Port Blair hotel. Sadananda, a bank employee, 

went to answer the door, only to realise that door was rattling on its own. 

 He felt the entire building was shaking and woke up wife Uma and son Subhajit. The family, who arrived on a relief plane this evening, immediately ran out to the corridor. 

 ?There were many people rushing towards the staircase. Some were still groggy, while others had a toothbrush stuck in the mouth. Everyone just stopped doing whatever they were doing and tried to get out in the open,? said Dutta, a south Calcutta resident. 

 ?Even as we were descending, the staircase was falling apart and we felt we might not make it to safety. The entire structure was dangerously swaying from side to side. When we finally reached the road, we saw people swarming out of buildings to join the crowd that had already assembled,? he added.

 The Duttas escaped without a scratch. Niloy Moitra, another tourist from Calcutta, was almost as lucky. He fell as he was rushing to the ground floor of his hotel, but managed to make it to safety limping as his wife clutched their son and ran out. 

 ?It was complete chaos. We saw the sea swell suddenly and a giant tsunami crashed down on Marine Park. There were about 40 cars which were washed out to sea,? Moitra said. 

 ?The situation is very grim on some Andaman islands, like Havlock. Three hundred people have been killed and 700 are missing,? said S.B. Deol, inspector-general of police, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. 

 ?Car Nicobar Island and the islands to the south are the worst affected. However, preliminary reports suggest that tourists are safe though many of them are stranded. Wireless sets are not working on many islands, so the communication system has been affected,? he added. 

 BSNL officials on the islands said telecommunication was affected in almost all islands, except Port Blair, which was connected to the mainland. ?However, there is excessive congestion as people are making constant queries from the mainland,? an official said. 

 Describing the devastation at Port Blair, Dutta said: ?The jetty was submerged and some of the smaller vessels that are used for inter-island transportation had got stuck on top of it. At the airport, large slabs had fallen from the control tower.?

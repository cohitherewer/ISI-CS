 Lottery call for nursery entry

 New Delhi, Oct. 24 (PTI): A public study group on the Central Advisory Board of Education committees has suggested that schools could follow the neighbourhood policy regarding admission to nursery and pre-primary classes and decide admissions through a transparent draw of lots.

 In an affidavit filed in Delhi High Court through counsel Ashok Agrawal, group secretary Radhika Menon said the schools should not ask ?non-essential? questions about parents? jobs, salaries, car brands and ?what can you do for schools?? in the registration forms. Such a step would reduce the bias in the principal?s or the selector?s mind.

 The group of educationists and activists also suggested that the schools should reduce their area of admission to one kilometre or even less as this would automatically reduce the number of applicants.

 The affidavit was filed in response to the court?s request for assistance from all bodies, individuals and schools.

 Earlier, three parents had filed a petition challenging a single-bench judgment of the high court, which on January 12 last year had rejected the plea for banning interviewing of children and parents for admissions.

 The group, which felt that children should not be brought to schools for interactions, also recommended some role for resident welfare associations in the selection process.

 Last year, the Centre had told the court that it was consulting experts, including psychologists and sociologists regarding interviewing children for admission to nursery and pre-primary classes. 

 The government would come out with the suggestions after getting views of experts, including those from the National Institute of Educational Planning and Administration, additional solicitor-general Amrender Sharan had told a bench of Justices D.K. Jain and R.S. Bhat. The court was also told that data, including those from foreign countries, was being collected and studied to assist the Centre on this.

 Agrawal, the study group?s counsel, has sought a ban on interviewing children on the ground that it was ?arbitrary and violative? of their human rights.

 The practice was violative of their fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 14 (right to equality), Article 21 (right to life amp; liberty) and Article 21-A (right to education for children below 14) of the Constitution and provisions of Delhi School Education Act, 1973, he contended.

 Agrawal said by subjecting the children to interviews public schools were also violating recommendations of the Kothari Commission (1964-66) and the Yashpal Committee (1993) and urged the court to direct the schools to give admission in pre-primary classes by draw of lots only.

 On May 6, the court had issued a public notice to the schools seeking assistance on this ?question of larger public importance?. It has also issued notices to the human resource development ministry, the Montfort School and its principal, Delhi Lt governor and director of education.

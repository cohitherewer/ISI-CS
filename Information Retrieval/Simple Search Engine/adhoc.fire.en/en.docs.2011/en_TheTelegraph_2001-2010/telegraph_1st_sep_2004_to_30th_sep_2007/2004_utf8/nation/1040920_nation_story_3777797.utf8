 Rape in name of marriage

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA 

 Hyderabad, Sept. 19: Fifteen-year-old Anees Begum was rescued from a Mumbai hotel yesterday hours before she was to board a Muscat-bound flight to join her septuagenarian husband ? an Arab sheikh.

 By the time the police managed to track her down, the teenager had been raped and abused by the sheikh?s aides for nearly three days.

 Local kazis said the Anees was married to Mattar Hameed Abdullah Al Gheilani on August 3 here. The sheikh stayed in the city till the first week of this month, entertaining his poor in-laws ? Syed Bahsser, a banana vendor near Charminar, and wife Khurya Bee, a domestic help. Anees is the third of six daughters and one son.

 The sheikh left for Muscat but later sent his aides to bring Anees to him. 

 On Thursday, Anees was taken to Mumbai by the two men ? S.A.S. Al Hasmhi and Hameed Mohammed. Little did the teenager know that her escorts had been given the freedom to satiate their lust before taking her to the sheikh.

 In her statement after her return here, the girl said she was raped by the two in a Mumbai hotel. ?They kept saying wait, wait, what is the hurry. Your sheikh has sent us to entertain ourselves,? she was told when she asked when they would take her to her husband.

 After three days of torture and abuse, Anees rang up a number in Bhavaninagar here and pleaded that someone should inform the police. Her alleged rapists were asleep then.

 On coming to know of her plight, R.P. Singh, the city police commissioner, rushed a team by flight to Mumbai. After co-ordinating with the local police there, Anees and the the two men were brought back here late last evening.

 ?My parents got a meher of Rs 5,000 and several days of entertainment with daru and chicken biryani as an exchange? the girl said. 

 Initially, Anees did not want to go back and live with her parents. ?I know their pitiable condition but I do not want to live with them.? 

 The police have identified the kazi who conducted the nikah as Sheikh Khaled Ali of Himayat Nagar. He had accepted a CD recorder as a gift from the groom. ?We are yet to arrest the kazi,? said Mohammed Khan, the police inspector of Bhavaninagar.

 Anees? case is not the first of its kind in the city. On May 4 this year, 19-year-old Hasina Begum was married off to a sheikh who dumped her a few days later.

 It was also found that 73-year-old Jafar Yakub Hasan Al Joorani, a native of Sharjah, had offered Rs 10,000 to Hasina?s parents and was set to marry again. Investigations showed Joorani had married thrice since landing in Hyderabad on May 3.

 The once Arab refugee settlement, Bar Khas, has become a den for petro rich Arabs in search of teenage girls, who are lured with the hope of marriage to rich sheikhs.

 Passport renewal norms eased

 New Delhi, Oct. 3 (PTI): The government has exempted from police verification persons who need to renew their passports but have no change in their residential addresses.

 ?For renewal of passports wherein there is no change of address of individuals, police verification has been done away with,? minister of state for external affairs E. Ahmed said here.

 Directions are already there for issue of ?tatkal? (instant) passports, without waiting for a police verification report, which can be obtained later, he added.

 The minister said modernisation plans were afoot to reduce the number of pending passport cases. As of August 2004, more than 1,90,000 applications were pending. ?Our aim is to reduce the pending cases to zero within three months, depending on furnishing of police verification reports,? Ahamed said. Accepting that obtaining police verification reports was a difficult task, he added that passport officers had been directed to interact with police chiefs of the states.

 The minister said the government had taken a series view of corruption involving passport office employees. ?We have issued strict instructions to passport offices to ensure that touts are removed from the premises,? he said.

 The Delhi police recently arrested a passport office employee when it busted a gang arranging passports on the basis of fake documents. Several passports were got issued in the name of one person having the same address.

 The Central Bureau of Investigation also carried out searches at various regional passport offices, especially in the southern region, following information that travel documents were being issued on the basis of forged documents in connivance with passport officials. The CBI registered a case against five persons and conducted searches at 11 places, including the residences of the accused officials.

 At least 146 cases in which passports were issued on the basis of false and forged documents were mentioned in the complaint. On verification, it was found that in 54 cases, the allegations were true.

 The government, in an effort to simplify issuing of passports, had set up a committee in March 2001 to review the process. The panel, in its report submitted in September 2001, made several recommendations including submission of passport applications at the district level and modernisation of passport offices.

 Left raises protest banner again 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 20: The CPM today renewed pressure on the government on the inclusion of foreign representatives in the Planning Commission?s advisory committees, just two days after the party?s top leadership said they were ?satisfied? after their luncheon meeting with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.

 But Montek Singh Ahluwalia, the Planning Commission deputy chairperson, seemed firm not to give in to the Left?s pressure. ?We will continue to have representatives from the World Bank and other multilateral agencies on the consultative committees till instructed otherwise,? he said. He is part of the high-level delegation accompanying the Prime Minister on his foreign trip. 

 Ahluwalia believes there is nothing wrong in having open consultations with World Bank representatives on issues critical to the economy. But senior politburo member Prakash Karat maintains that the government should remove the impression that it will accommodate representatives of foreign agencies in decision-making bodies. 

 When asked about Ahluwalia?s comments, CPM general secretary Harkishen Singh Surjeet said his party would talk to the Prime Minister after he returns from abroad. 

 Manmohan Singh had assured the CPM top brass ? Surjeet, Jyoti Basu and Sitaram Yechury ? on Saturday of a discussion on all the prickly issues at the next meeting of the UPA-Left co-ordination committee.

 The plan panel row seems to have taken precedence over all other issues on the Left?s list. Karat has also written to Ahluwalia explaining his party?s objections to the foreign agency appointments. 

 He has said that there is a ?widespread? feeling that agencies like the IMF and the World Bank have had an ?undue? influence on the policies in this country since the beginning of liberalisation in 1991. 

 ?The impact of the IMF-World Bank policies have had harmful effects on our economy and society,? he said. 

 Ahluwalia, however, believes that the Planning Commission will gain from learning about the experiences of the foreign representatives with regard to agriculture, water resources and transport. 

 Till now, there has been no breakthrough. The forthcoming meeting of the UPA-Left co-ordination committee is likely to be held at the end of this month.

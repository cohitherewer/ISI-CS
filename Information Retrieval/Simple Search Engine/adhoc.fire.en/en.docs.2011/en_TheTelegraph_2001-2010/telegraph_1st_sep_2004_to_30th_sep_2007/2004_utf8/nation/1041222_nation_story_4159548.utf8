 Court cautions Zahira on reply ?design?

 Mumbai, Dec. 21: In a day full of events at the special court in Mazgaon, Zahira Sheikh, the key witness in the Best Bakery case, was declared hostile by the prosecution.

 The judge also asked the defence to be cautious in its choice of words as the witness was prone to changing her account according to what was being said by the defence, if unconsciously.

 The prosecution charged that the defence, by raising meaningless objections, was emitting signals to the witness.

 Zahira, draped in a black burqa, was produced in court in the morning. She was calm, soft-spoken and often very fluent. She did not hesitate to answer questions but retracted a number of statements recorded in her name by the police, after which the prosecution declared her hostile.

 The bakery witness said she, with her mother Shehrunnisa, brothers Nafitullah and Nasibullah and sisters Sahira and Sabera, were on the terrace when their Vadodara bakery was set ablaze by a mob on March 1, 2002. But she claimed she could not see anyone because of the smoke and the fire.

 Zahira also denied that Qausar Ali, her maternal uncle who was looking after the bakery since her father?s death, was present in the bakery during the incident. 

 In her police statement earlier, she had said Qausar was present in the bakery. 

 Zahira added that she did not know how her sister, Sabera, who was supposedly killed during the incident, died. She said stones and bottles were being thrown into the terrace. Frightened, Sabera walked away from the terrace into one of the rooms on the first floor, which was on fire. Zahira said she did not know what happened after that. 

 Zahira said she saw Sabera?s body in the hospital, where her family was taken.

 When the prosecution asked if she had seen other bodies also, the defence interposed and said the appropriate words should have been if she was ?shown? other bodies, and not ?seen?. 

 In her next statement, Zahira, who said she had ?seen? Sabera?s body, also used the word ?shown?. At this, the judge asked the defence to be careful, because their interjections were obviously influencing the witness? account.

 The prosecution charged that these interjections were ?clues? sent by the defence, hinting to Zahira how she should answer a particular question or not answer at all.

 Zahira herself was reprimanded. In answer to a question relating to Raees Khan, a colleague of activist Teesta Setalvad who highlighted the bakery case, she volunteered a statement on how Khan had forced her into behaving in a certain way. The judge then warned her to strictly answer the question being asked and not to furnish irrelevant information. 

 He added that from the roundabout way in she was answering and saying more than what was required, it could seem that there was a design behind this and she had already thought of something to say and project before appearing in court.

 Towards the end of the proceedings, an accused in the case, Kamlesh, disrupted proceedings on three occasions by suddenly shouting out from the back of the courtroom where the accused are seated. 

 He appeared to be complaining about the seating arrangement in the court, pointing to a chair which a reporter was occupying. When the judge asked Kamlesh to be taken out, he calmed down but refused to sit down and remained standing.

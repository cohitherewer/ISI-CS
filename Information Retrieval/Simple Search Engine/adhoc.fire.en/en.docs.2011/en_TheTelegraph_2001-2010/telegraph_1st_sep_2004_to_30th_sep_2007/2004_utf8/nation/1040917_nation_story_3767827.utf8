 Delhi sniffs Valley chance

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi/Srinagar, Sept. 16: Delhi believes recent developments in Jammu and Kashmir indicate that those opposed to Pakistan imposing its decisions on Kashmiris have managed to consolidate.

 It feels that if the trend continues it will take only some weeks for the Hurriyat moderates to regain the confidence to act independently of Islamabad and decide on another round of talks with the Centre.

 Even so, hardline separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani today blamed the government for yesterday?s murder in Srinagar of his close associate Peer Hissam-ud-Din. Geelani?s Hurriyat faction supports merging Kashmir with Pakistan and broke away from the conglomerate last year after the moderates agree to hold talks with the Centre.

 Shocked and angered by the murder of his closest associate, Geelani, who returned to Srinagar from Delhi this afternoon, thundered: ?If they think assassinations like this can resolve the dispute and restore peace in Kashmir then I offer myself for such a sacrifice.?

 Hissam-ud-Din was interred in the martyrs? graveyard at Eidgah in downtown Srinagar this afternoon. Several hundred mourners joined the funeral of the secretary of the newly-floated Tehreek Hurriyat Jammu and Kashmir and shouted pro-freedom and pro-Islam slogans.

 Union home minister Shivraj Patil will now travel to the state on October 23. Patil?s visit is aimed at giving him the chance to see the ground situation for himself rather than kickstarting the Centre?s dialogue with the Hurriyat.

 Hurriyat moderates have dilly-dallied over talks with the home minister since the United Progressive Alliance government came to power last May. Just when the moderates appeared to be willing to respond to Delhi?s offer, militants killed Hurriyat founder-chairman Mirwaiz Umer Farooq?s uncle Maulvi Mushtaq and burned down a school run by the Mirwaiz?s Awami Action Committee.

 Student shot in campus clash

 Lucknow: Even before the political storm 

 over the murder of a Samajwadi Party leader could blow over, 

 a student leader was killed on Thursday in Azamgarh, about 

 170 km from here, reports our special correspondent.

 Ajit Rai, a student of B.Sc third year at Shivli National Post Graduate College, was shot on the campus after a clash broke out between two groups of students at 11 in the morning, said Deepika Duggal, special secretary in the home ministry. 

 Police took a bleeding Ajit to hospital where he died.

 The murder sparked a riot in the campus with students ransacking the college office and pelting stones at the hospital, Duggal said.

 The atmosphere in the college had been tense throughout the morning with elections to the students? union slated later in the day.

 An additional police force was rushed to the campus and the situation was brought under control, Duggal added. The police are also raiding various places in the city to pick up those involved in the firing and arson.

 The state government has announced a compensation of Rs 10 lakh to the slain student?s family. It has also promised to instal a statue of Ajit on the campus. 

 The Uttar Pradesh government has set up a special task force, under the leadership of the Lucknow inspector-general, to stem the spiralling crime rate in the state. Opposition parties, including the Congress, have been demanding the resignation of chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav.

 States slam green steps

 New Delhi: State environment ministers 

 have criticised the Centre?s planned reform of the way projects

Among those most vocal in their criticism were Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh.

 As soon as Union environment minister A. Raja completed his speech announcing a strategy to reform the grant of clearances, most state ministers criticised the proposed reforms. They demanded that the Centre demarcate its power clearly and give states? more autonomy in approving projects.

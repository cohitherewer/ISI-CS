 Sangh suit against Arjun

 New Delhi, Sept. 2 (PTI): The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh today filed a defamation suit against Arjun Singh for suggesting that the organisation was involved in the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi.

 Hours after the suit was filed, the Union human resource development minister said: There is no question of any apology from my side or going back. What is there in my written statement, I stand by it. 

 The minister said his legal advisers would take care of the defamation suit filed in Haryana by the state RSS president, Darshan Lal Jain.

 Singh had said on August 10: Since the tragic and fateful evening of January 30, 1948, when the shots fired by Nathuram Godse killed the father of the nation at a prayer meeting, I am convinced that philosophy of hate and violence, which the RSS swears by, killed Mahatmaji.

 The RSS had then served a legal notice on him, demanding an unconditional written apology and threatened to file a criminal defamation case if he did not comply.

 The case also lists as respondents . Ram, the editor-in-chief of The Hindu, and Kasturi and Sons, the publishers.

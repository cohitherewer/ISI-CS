 Paedophile in custody

 Water being taken to court on Tuesday. (PTI)

 Mumbai, Sept. 7 (PTI): British citizen John Allan Water, who was extradited here from the US yesterday on charges of child sexual abuse, was remanded in police custody till September 14. 

 Additional chief metropolitan magistrate V.P. Taware, who sent him into custody, asked the police to follow international extradition guidelines. The court has allowed Water home food, medical and legal assistance. 

 The Briton has been charged under sections 373 (using children for prostitution), 377 (unnatural offences) and 34 (common intention) read with 23 (wrongful gain) of the IPC.

 Waters counsel Majid Memom, however, told the court that the prosecution had made factual errors in registering the case against him. Please check his passport, and the charge that he fled the country after registration of a case will turn out to be untrue, he said. On his argument that an arrest memo has to be prepared in case of an extradited accused, the court pulled up the police for failing to do so. It also expressed displeasure over polices failure in preparing an arrest panchnama (an on-the-spot report). 

 Water, along with Duncan Grant and William DSouza, ran a childrens shelter in Colaba. Grant, also British and a co-accused, has been detained in Tanzania on similar sexual abuse charges there. He had started a shelter in that country too.

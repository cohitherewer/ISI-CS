 Parents strangle thieving son

 Hyderabad: A couple from Vijayawada have surrendered to the police, confessing that they strangled their teenaged son for his compulsive stealing habit, reports our special correspondent.

 The Vijayawada police arrested 42-year-old P. Subba Reddy and his 36-year-old wife Subbulu on Friday on charges of murder.

 In their confession, the couple said they took their 13-year-old son, Ravinder, to a field 5 km from Vijayawada on December 5 and pressured him to consume pesticide. When the scared child refused, the couple strangled him. Abandoning the body in the field, they returned home.

 A factory worker and father of three sons, Reddy, found his second son Ravinder, a Class VI dropout, to be wayward and a compulsive thief from childhood. Attempts to discipline the boy by putting him in a boarding school and handing him over to the police did not help. ?The police only beat him and sent him off,? said Reddy.

 The couple found their son a social embarrassment. Unable to bear the insults and humiliations of their neighbours, they changed houses six times in the coastal town. The last incident was too much for the couple to tolerate.

 Official killed by sand mafia

 Chennai: A revenue department official 

 in Kancheepuram was run over by a lorry on Saturday for 

 attempting to stop members of the sand mafia from allegedly 

 escaping with the vehicle loaded with illegally quarried 

 sand, reports our special correspondent.

 Forty-eight-year-old Venkatesan, a deputy tehsildar of the Thirukazhukundram zone, was part of a five-member patrol team headed by Manoharan.

 The team, which had decided to crack down on illegal mining and transportation of sand from the area, had been patrolling in a jeep past midnight when they intercepted the lorry. They surrounded the vehicle and tried to impound it. 

 But soon three persons, including a local ADMK functionary, arrived on the spot. Flaunting their political connections, they ordered the tehsildar to release the lorry. The officials refused to budge and Venkatesan positioned himself right in front of the vehicle, refusing to let it go past him. He was crushed under the wheels as the defiant lorry driver tried to flee.

 Water surges into nuke complex

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 26: India?s nuclear weaponisation facility at Kalpakkam was threatened by the tsunamis from the Bay of Bengal. Water from the sea entered the complex and a wall in the Kalpakkam Atomic Reprocessing Plant and the Madras Atomic Power Station caved in.

 An army battalion stationed in Chennai was deployed to drain out the water and act on an emergency. Following a scare about the extent of the damage, a spokesperson for the Crisis Management Group in New Delhi said: ?All precautions have been taken and the Kalpakkam atomic plant is fully safe.?

 Army sources said troops from a battalion in Chennai were rushed to the complex after initial information that the waves had lashed it. Kalpakkam is some 80 km south of Chennai and KARP and MAPS together are a nuclear power production, fuel reprocessing facility where a 500 MW fast-breeder reactor is now being built. 

 The Kalpakkam facility is one of the most strategic sites of the department of atomic energy.

 In Mumbai, sources with the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Ltd told PTI: ?The unit II, which was operating at 210 MW, was brought to safe shut down.? 

 Official sources in New Delhi would only say that the plant facility is fully capable but would not confirm that a part of it was shut down. Sea water flooded the pump house of MAPS around 9.15 am. This affected the operation of condensed cooling pumps of unit II. The turbine immediately tripped and consequently the reactor got shut down. 

 ?The unit was brought to cold shut down state,? sources added.

 Pak rebel leader to visit India

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 30: After years of reluctance, Muttahida Quami Movement leader Altaf Hussain has been allowed to visit Delhi for the first time.

 The ostensible reason for Hussain?s visit, starting November 4, is to attend an annual conference being organised by a Delhi-based English daily. But the self-exiled leader who stays in London is also slated to interact with key Indian officials and political leaders as well as visit Ajmer.

 The MQM has played havoc with successive political regimes in Pakistan ? including that of Pervez Musharraf ? by its militant agitation for better rights for mohajirs (Urdu-speaking people who crossed over from India during the Partition). But its leaders are now a mellowed lot and the party is part of the coalition government in Sindh.

 Indian policy makers have of late toyed with inviting Hussain to embarrass Pakistan, but had desisted from making such a move.

 Sources said Hussain would be visiting India on an invitation from a private organisation. However, South Block has found nothing objectionable about granting him a visa.

 The sources said several Pakistani political leaders had visited India in the past year and Hussain?s visit should be seen in the same context. Efforts were being made by both countries to engage with the wider political spectrum.

 MQM leaders in Pakistan, who met Musharraf recently, said they had not discussed Hussain?s visit with him. But Hussain would speak to Musharraf over phone after returning to London, they said.

 Hussain had recently claimed that the Pakistan government was not renewing his passport. However, officials in India said he would be travelling on a Pakistani passport.

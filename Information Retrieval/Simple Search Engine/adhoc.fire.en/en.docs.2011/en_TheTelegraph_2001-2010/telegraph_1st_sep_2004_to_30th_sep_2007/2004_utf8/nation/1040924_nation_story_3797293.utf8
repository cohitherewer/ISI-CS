 Naidu wins Uma battle 

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 New Delhi, Sept. 23: Round two of the power struggle in the BJP, which began shortly after it lost power, has also gone to M. Venkaiah Naidu. 

 The party chief had in the first round ensured that former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee?s voice of moderation was muzzled in the Mumbai national executive and the Goa chintan baithak. 

 In the second, he saw to it that former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Uma Bharti was told off ? perhaps for the first time in the BJP.

 The only concession Naidu made to the sadhvi, who felt the BJP had not thrown its weight behind her tiranga yatra, was to let Vajpayee attend the concluding ceremony in Amritsar ? something he initially saw as pointless. The rest of the yatra was bereft of the line-up of leaders a BJP yatra draws.

 Naidu, by winning the two rounds of the power struggle, has proved that he is still the first among equals ? excluding Vajpayee and .K. Advani but including Uma, Pramod Mahajan, Arun Jaitley, Sushma Swaraj, Narendra Modi and Rajnath Singh.

 Naidu went all out to scuttle any move that Uma might make towards staking claim to the party president?s post from the moment that such signals emanated from her camp ? including the impression that was sought to be created of her having ?sacrificed? the post of Madhya Pradesh chief minister.

 The party deemed a yatra unnecessary after a Karnataka court cleared Uma of the charges against her. However, Uma?s supporters had by then built up a momentum on the Tricolour and raised the pitch among the cadre. Naidu thus decided to play along and deputed his confidant Ananth Kumar as her fellow charioteer.

 Then, Mahajan ? who is engaged in a decisive battle in Maharashtra but also has an eye on Delhi ? indicated a yatra was the last thing he wanted, following Uma?s grouse that he did not receive her when the chariot rolled into the state.

 Uma?s problems did not end in Maharashtra. Her loyalists complained that leaders ignored the yatra in other places, too. These included Vasundhara Raje in Rajasthan, Rajnath in Uttar Pradesh and Babulal Gaur, her successor in Madhya Pradesh.

 BJP leaders made it clear to Uma, when they half-heartedly rustled up press coverage for the last phase of the yatra, that they would go this far and no further, said sources.

 Uma was one of the BJP?s best bets for mobilising its Hindutva votes in the Ayodhya phase but was a liability when it floundered for political clarity, the sources conceded. 

 An influential section recognised that the post-poll shenanigans, including Sushma?s threat to do the widow act if Sonia Gandhi became Prime Minister, the disruption of Parliament and the personal attacks on Manmohan Singh, were counter-productive because the BJP?s newly-acquired constituencies in industry and market sought political stability.

 Protests derail House 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Dec. 6: Opposition members disrupted proceedings in the Bihar Assembly today to protest against lack of government action to improve the law and order situation, prevent hunger deaths and provide adequate relief to flood and drought victims.

 They had earlier presented a series of adjournment motions on these issues with specific reference to the murder of a Patna doctor, the abduction of NHPC officials and incidents in Begusarai.

 As soon as the House assembled today, the Opposition members rose to their feet demanding a discussion on the adjournment motions. Speaker Sadanand Singh?s pleas to maintain order did not cut ice with the angry members who trooped into the well of the House. 

 Singh adjourned the House till 12 noon, 10 minutes after proceedings began. When the House re-assembled, the Opposition members continued with their protests and the Speaker was forced to adjourn it till tomorrow. 

 A similar situation prevailed in the Legislative Council with the Opposition demanding a discussion on the law and order situation.

 Credit cards hot in restaurants, not hotels

 A STAFF REPORTER

 High Plastic Zone: Restaurants, departmental stores and supermarkets 

 Low Plastic Zone: Bookings for cinema and concerts, travel-related expenses and various recurring payments 

 A recent study by American Express on credit card trends has brought out the plastic spending habits of Indians.

 The Share of Wallet study conducted simultaneously in India, Australia, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand also throws up a few forecasts on the use of plastic money over the next six months. 

 Across various categories, the credit card is the most popular in restaurants with 44 per cent of the respondents saying they use it frequently while eating out. New Zealanders are the most frequent users (79 per cent), followed by Singaporeans. 

 Other areas where card use is frequent are paying for bills in departmental stores (39 per cent) and everyday expenses in supermarkets (33 per cent). In these categories, the percentage of frequent users in countries like Singapore, Taiwan and Indonesia is around 60 per cent. 

 Indians are catching up fast with their counterparts in the Asia-Pacific region in spending plastic money at eateries and shopping malls, but the propensity to pay through credit cards is much less for services.

 The study reveals that Indians are still averse to the idea of going plastic when it comes to booking tickets to movies or concerts (only 12 per cent being frequent users), travel expenses such as air ticket and hotel (18 per cent) and recurring bills such as utilities, subscription and insurance (11 per cent). 

 But the survey points out that things are changing and plastic will rule in the days to come. 

 According to it, 32 per cent of Indian credit card users feel plastic money spending will increase over the next six months, which puts Indian consumers second on the list, after Thailand. 

 Not just that, 18 per cent of the Indian respondents again, just behind Thailands 19 per cent think that the number of plastic cards in their wallet will go up over the next six months. 

 The study confirms that a significant number of people are seeking the convenience of not having to carry cash, and the use of cards is widening, said K.. Muralidhara, the vice-president and country manager of American Express travel-related service. 

 The numbers support this claim with the credit card market seeing rapid growth. From half-a-million in 1992, the card population has swollen to around 9 million, and is growing at 20-25 per cent a year. 

 While its true that the Indian market is still young, that very fact endows it with high growth prospects. For instance, around 1 per cent of total consumer spending in India is charged on cards and total plastic billings are estimated at over Rs 10,000 crore, but the growth rate is around 20 per cent a year. 

 Its not all over for the currency department of the Reserve Bank of India, though, as cash is still hot. The survey reveals that over 17 per cent of the respondents use credit cards for cash advance frequently, second on the list after New Zealand (22 per cent).

 Police sniff promoter protection link

 KINSUK BASU

 Calcutta, Nov. 4: More 

 worms are crawling out of the Dilip can.

 Nearly a week into Dilip Banerjee?s arrest, it appears that the criminal ? wanted in connection with several cases of murder and extortion ? also had a hand in offering protection to a section of promoters in Garia, Sonarpur, Dum Dum and Barasat.

 Police sources today claimed that both Sasthi Duley and Dipankar Roy, the footballers arrested for harbouring hatkata Dilip, were close to these promoters and came to know the criminal in the process and often sought protection from him for business ventures.

 The sources said a former footballer helped Sasthi and Dipankar connect with Dilip. Till late tonight, the police were grilling him to unravel the maze of connections.

 Sources in North 24-Parganas police said Dilip, who evaded arrest since he went on a shooting spree at a soiree in June that killed two persons, had put up at Dipankar?s place in Tollygunge for a few days before moving to Hooghly.

 When Dipankar sniffed a police raid, the best alternative seemed to be his East Bengal teammate Sasthi?s house in Hooghly?s Haripal, from where Dilip was arrested last Friday.

 A deal was fixed with Sasthi?s brother Uday. In all this, Dipankar was aided by one of his promoter friends from South 24-Parganas, Sanjib Sarkar.

 The revelations, late on Wednesday night, came after North 24-Parganas police grilled the two footballers, Sanjib and Rajiv Sinha. While Sanjib helped Dipankar provide a shelter to Dilip and later to shift him to Hooghly, Rajiv played a key role in offering Dilip a hiding place in Garia soon after the soiree shootout in Nayapatti, Salt Lake.

 The police have arrested both Sanjib and Rajiv for harbouring a criminal. 

 As the two had offered shelter to a murderer, their charges were tagged to the main case of the Nayapatti twin murders, thus denying them bail for an otherwise bailable offence.

 Rajiv was held along with three others yesterday after he tried to slip in a note ? probably with a message ? with food to Dipankar. Today, Sanjib and Rajiv were produced in the sub-divisional judicial magistrate?s court in Barrackpore and remanded in police custody for five days.

 ?There are reasons to believe that Dipankar was known to hatkata Dilip even before the Nayapatti incident happened. Besides, even Duley knew Dilip by virtue of his brother?s attempts to cut into the promoting business across parts of Garia and Sonarpur,? a senior officer said.

 Last night, the sleuths had stumbled upon Sanjib?s name after interrogating Sasthi and Dipankar. He was picked up from Sonarpur for questioning and arrested on the basis of Dipankar and Sasthi?s statements.

 Lake Town police tonight questioned Dilip?s wife for nearly three hours.

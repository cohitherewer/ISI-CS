 Sangh, BJP see poll hope

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 Joshi: On a hunt

 New Delhi, Nov. 16: Have the Sangh parivar and the BJP found a new mascot in Jayendra Saraswati? Murli Manohar Joshi, K.N. Govindacharya, George Fernandes and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad ? often sparring allies ? have closed ranks to denounce the Kanchi acharya?s arrest. 

 The Sangh scored a minor victory when it got Janata Dal (United) leader Fernandes to persuade the NDA to toe its line on the arrest.

 Far from a conflagration, Jayendra Saraswati?s arrest did not even cause a minor fire in Tamil Nadu, the seat of the Kanchi mutt. Why then are the Sangh parivar and Fernandes bristling in anger?

 Observers believe that with the ?Ayodhya card? subject to the law of diminishing returns and other Hindutva issues ? a common civil code, conversions, illegal immigration from Bangladesh ? not taking off, the arrest is a convenient plank to whip up the bogey of ?Hinduism being under threat?. 

 The VHP linked the arrest by Tamil Nadu police to Sonia Gandhi?s rise in politics and suggested that nothing better could be expected of a ?foreign? ruler.

 But the Sangh parivar chose not to attack Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayalalithaa. Sources explained that she had been a ?useful? ally of Hindutva, bucking the trend to support Narendra Modi, and could come handy in the future. ?Moreover, if we start branding her as anti-Hindu, it won?t cut ice because she dared to bring a law against religious conversions,? said a BJP source.

 BJP sources said while their protests against the arrest may not bear fruit in Tamil Nadu ? where the acharya is worshipped by a tiny fraction of the minuscule Iyer community ? the idea is to revive a pro-Hindu ambience in the heartland. ?The seer has followers in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh among Shaivites. We have been losing upper caste votes to the Congress. We have to check the defection,? said a source. Brahmins like Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Joshi taking up cudgels for the seer, sources said, would go down well with the upper castes. 

 The only problem is that unlike Ram, a pan-Hindu figure, the Kanchi seer?s ?appeal? is limited to a sect. The best the BJP can hope to achieve is to remind people of the ?role? he played in the Ayodhya ?movement?.

 The Congress, always in a quandary on religious matters, was over-cautious. Sonia, asked to comment, said the matter was sub judice and she would not speak on it.

 South support

 Several south Indian organisations today protested in Delhi against the arrest of the acharya and demanded his immediate release. 

 They took out a march ? shouting slogans against Jayalalithaa and her government ? to Jantar Mantar and held a day?s token hunger strike. The protest was led by the Bharatiyar Cultural Society, Dakshina Bharata Samaj and the Delhi Tamil Conference.

 Court comes to ?sibling? couple?s rescue

 GAJINDER SINGH

 Chandigarh, Oct. 15: Rampal and Sonia can stay husband and wife for now, thank court for that.

 Punjab and Haryana High Court today asked a khap panchayat to stop meddling in the couple?s marital lives ? it had ordered them to morph into brother and sister to honour some caste restrictions ? and directed that they should not be coerced to change their status.

 The bench of Chief Justice B.K. Roy and Justice Surya Kant noted that nobody could be allowed to change the lives of people in such a manner. 

 On a PIL filed by People?s Union of Civil Liberties general secretary Ashish Goel, it ordered police to provide them security.

 Rampal and Sonia ? of Jhajjar village in Haryana ? had been ordered to dissolve their marriage and relate as siblings by the Asanda khap panchayat as the castes they belong to share a common forefather. Sonia belongs to the Rathee gotra and Rampal is a Dahiya.

 Among the Jats, every village is assumed to have as its founder a common forefather. Village panchayats argue that this makes all descendants ? down the generations ? brother and sister sharing the same gotra. So, they cannot marry one another.

 Although khap panchayats lost their social recognition after the 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments empowered the village panchayat at the village, block and district levels, their voices continue to be heard. MLAs and MPs toe their line as it is impossible to win elections without their support.

 The khaps are so powerful they can even flout court orders and influence the police. They consider it their right to enforce tradition and check deviations.

 With more and more youngsters defying the family?s control over the institution of marriage, the khaps have been hitting back, often mercilessly.

 In October 1999, the bodies of a Jat teen and a backward class Lohar (blacksmith) boy she had fallen in love with were found in Ismaila village, a little beyond Rohtak. The girl?s uncle and cousins killed the young lovers so that it could be an object lesson to all errant youngsters.

 The same year, a couple of Kaithal village in Shimla was stoned to death for having dared to get into an endogamous marriage. They had been exiled by the khap but defied the ruling and returned to their village.

 The khaps often sanction murder and ostracism of couples as well as various forms of torture, including tonsure, blackening of faces and parading people naked or on donkeys.

 ?Most of the corpses found in the villages in Jat areas of Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Rajasthan are those ordered by these panchayats, openly sometimes, quietly at other times,? a CPI leader said.

 The National Commission for Women is believed to have taken cognisance of the Asanda khap panchayat?s decision and will soon send a delegation to Jhajjar. 

 There are reports that Rampal?s Dahiya gotra has decided to hold a similar panchayat to decry the Asanda panchayat?s decree.

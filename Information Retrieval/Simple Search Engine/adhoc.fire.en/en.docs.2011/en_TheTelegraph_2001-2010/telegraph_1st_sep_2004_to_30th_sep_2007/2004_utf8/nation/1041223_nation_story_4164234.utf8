 Court sees misadventure, gives smut boy bail

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 22: A juvenile court today granted bail to the Delhi schoolboy in the middle of the sex video scandal after rejecting the police description that the 17-year-old?s actions spoke of a ?morally depraved mind? and he might tamper with evidence.

 The court said the act was a ?misadventure? and ordered the boy and his parents to undergo psychiatric counselling for a month. The parents have been told to submit weekly progress reports before the principal magistrate of the Juvenile Justice Board, Santosh Snehi Mann.

 The court said there was no likelihood of the boy being exposed to moral, physical or psychological danger if released on bail as ?it appears that his family is in a position to exercise necessary supervision and control over him?.

 There was also no material on record to suggest that if released on bail, the juvenile would come into contact with any known criminal, the court said, agreeing with an observation of the school?s principal that the incident took place ?due to excitement and tendency to do inhibited things?.

 A social investigation report conducted on the court?s directive had said the student did not have a criminal history. It described the student as an extrovert with a passion for cricket but emphasised that he ?did not have a night life?. The probation officer, who prepared the report, also said the boy?s family adhered to social values and had a good reputation.

 The boy will have to deposit his passport with the court and has been barred from leaving Delhi.

 The court said the prosecution?s apprehension that he could tamper with evidence had not been substantiated. Delhi police had claimed that the boy had admitted to destroying the camera phone which he used to film the sex act with a girl of his school and changed the decor of the room where the video was shot. But the court ruled that this ?confession? before the police was not admissible. The police had also contended that there was a possibility the boy might blackmail the girl ? efforts are on to record her statement.

 In another ?adventurous? incident, a group of students in a leading public school in the capital were caught experimenting with alcohol on the school premises. The authorities barred the seven from attending a farewell party today.

 On Friday, the seven students were caught with alcohol by a teacher, who reported the matter to the principal. A teacher said the Class XII students were made to apologise at the school assembly on Monday. The teacher, however, said it was not rare for senior students to experiment with alcohol. But such cases are kept under wraps for fear that the students? careers might be affected by severe punitive action.

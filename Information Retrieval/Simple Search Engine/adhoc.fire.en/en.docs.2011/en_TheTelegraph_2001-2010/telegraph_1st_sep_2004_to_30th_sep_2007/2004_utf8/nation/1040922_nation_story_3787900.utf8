 Auroville purge

 New Delhi, Sept. 21: Arjun Singh today shunted an entire group appointed by his predecessor Murli Manohar Joshi in the Auroville Foundation, an autonomous educational organisation in Pondicherry, reports our special correspondent. 

 The human resource development minister has replaced Kirit Joshi, chairperson of the Auroville board, with Karan Singh, a Congress member of the Rajya Sabha. Karan Singh will hold the post for four years.

 In 1998, the ministry passed an act giving the foundation a new constitution. Within a year, Joshi brought a new set of people on the board. They included D.P. Chattopadhyay, .M. Singhvi, Subhash Kashyap, Roger Anger, Jyothi Madhok and Meera Srivastava. 

 Singh has retained only Chattopadhyay and Anger and brought in Manini Parthasarathy, Mallika Sarabhai and Ajoy Bagchi. S.K. Ray, a joint secretary in higher education, has taken the place of V.K. Pipresenia, a joint secretary and ex-officio board member. 

 The latest purge is part of Arjun Singh?s agenda to ?clean up? the ministry of Joshi appointees. However, in institutions like the Indian Council of Philosophical Research, the old guard is continuing.

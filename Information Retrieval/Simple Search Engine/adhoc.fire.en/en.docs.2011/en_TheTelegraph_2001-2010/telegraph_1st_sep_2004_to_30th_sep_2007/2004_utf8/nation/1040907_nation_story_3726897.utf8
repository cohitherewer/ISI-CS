 Singh, Kalam in TN spot

 KAY BENEDICT

 New Delhi, Sept. 6: President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh have been unwittingly caught in Tamil Nadus political storm.

 Jayalalithaa is the only chief minister who has not bothered to call on the Prime Minister in the 100 days he has been in office, urging him to take an interest in her state. DMK sources claim that Jayalalithaa is avoiding meeting Singh because he has the support of the party.

 DMK chief and Jayalalithaas rival M. Karunanidhi has called a meeting of all 12 Union ministers from Tamil Nadu belonging to the DMK and its allies tomorrow to discuss pending state projects, thus sending a message that he is taking serious interest in the development of the state.

 The Union ministers from the state have opted not to write any letters to Jayalalithaa so far. Instead, secretaries of the ministries have been writing to the chief secretary whenever necessary.

 Recently, petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar had written to all chief ministers about the need to levy VAT on petrol. Only Tamil Nadus letter went to chief secretary Lakshmi Pranesh.

 An ADMK delegation, which called on the President last week to invite him to address the Tamil Nadu Assembly, complained to him about the impropriety of the ministers behaviour. 

 The Karunanidhi-Jayalalithaa spat has also put the Prime Minister in a spot. Singh was slated to visit Kalpakkam last week to inaugurate an atomic energy reactor. Jayalalithaa had sought an appointment with him to discuss some pending projects but, ADMK sources said, she was given time at Raj Bhavan at an unsuitable hour.

 Predictably, she did not go. Jayalalithaa also had reservations about Singhs scheduled breakfast meeting with the DMK president. 

 The Prime Minister finally cancelled his trip to Kalpakkam, saying he was indisposed.

 ADMK sources said the invitation letters to the Kalpakkam programme did not bear the name of the chief minister and the Prime Minister did not take kindly to the omission. 

 He is learnt to have chided the ministers concerned, saying politics should be kept away from governance.

 Last Wednesday, Jayalalithaa accused Karunanidhi of trying to destabilise the state. A day after, the squabbling duo put the President in an embarrassing situation. Jayalalithaas team had invited him to address the Assembly, but Karunanidhi issued a statement urging Kalam to think twice.

 The President should also be aware of the fact that the state Assembly had met for only 15 days in the current year and the state government had rejected the Oppositions request for a longer session to discuss the state budget and demands of grants, the DMK leader said.

 100-plus convict gets bail breather

 Lucknow, Nov. 17: ?Order mil gaya kya?? asks Nankuram Mishra, 107, as he lies in his bed at the Mahatma Gandhi ward of the King George Hospital here.

 Mishra cannot properly recognise his relatives, suffers periodically from hypertension, anaemia, breathlessness and other old-age ailments, but is in jail custody as he recuperates at hospital. The centenarian was granted bail eight days ago in a murder case dating back 17 years but will only be released tomorrow now that all formalities have been completed and his health has improved somewhat.

 But such has been the roller-coaster legal battle Mishra has waged that his woes may not be over yet. Mishra has told his advocate I.B. Singh that he wanted to die among his relatives and not in jail.

 Mishra, who belongs to a respectable farmers? family in Uttar Pradesh?s Barabanki district, has been doing the rounds of courts and jails since he and two of his grandsons were accused of attacking Jagdamba Yadav on October 18, 1987, in Rudauli village following a land dispute. Yadav died a week after the alleged attack.

 Mishra and his grandsons were arrested, but the old man got bail after about three months.

 In 1995, the Barabanki sessions court found Mishra and his grandsons guilty of murder and handed out jail terms of five and 12 years, respectively. When the trio appealed against the order, Lucknow High Court granted Mishra bail on August 29 the same year. His grandsons are still in jail.

 The centenarian?s sentence of five years ended in 2000. As his appeal petition was still pending in the high court, he was not officially released, though he has spent only about four months in jail.

 Mishra?s case next came up before Justice M.A Khan of Lucknow High Court on March 31 this year. His jail term was commuted to the period he had already served in prison and he was fined Rs 10,000.

 But the Uttar Pradesh government appealed against the order and, early last month, the Supreme Court asked him to surrender immediately. The apex court reversed Justice Khan?s order and ordered that another bench hear Mishra?s case afresh.

 Advocate Singh presented Mishra?s passport ? the veteran used to occasionally visit Liverpool where his son recently retired as a doctor ? in court on October 23 this year to prove his date of birth is July 1897. The document helped him get a sympathetic hearing.

 On November 9, Mishra was granted bail. He was wheeled into the hospital, where he remains.

 With time slipping by, an anxious Sudhir Mishra, another grandson of Nankuram, said recently: ?He is caught up with serious old age related diseases. Will he be released before his death??

 Two of Mishra?s sons are dead. Both his daughters are alive but it was grandson Sudhir who used to look after him until he was taken into jail custody last month.

 Last week, one of his relatives said: ?If he dies in custody, this would amount to inflicting a capital punishment on an old man for an offence for which he was awarded a jail term for five years.?

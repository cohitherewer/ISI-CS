 BJP on anthem warpath

 New Delhi, Sept. 16 (PTI): The BJP has alleged that ?Gujarat? was dropped from the national anthem in textbooks in Kerala and is threatening to make this an issue.

 The party demanded an explanation from the Congress, which heads the state?s ruling coalition, an apology from the state government and action against those responsible.

 ?For two consecutive years, the Kerala government has omitted mention of ?Gujarat? from the national anthem printed in school textbooks,? BJP chief M. Venkaiah Naidu said at a news conference.

 He circulated copies of a page of Kerala Reader Mathematics ? Standard IX, commissioned by the State Council of Educational Research and Training. 

 ?It is not an isolated case but is a part of a definite vilification campaign,? Naidu said.

 Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi accused Sonia Gandhi and the Centre of hatching a conspiracy to defame Gujarat and threatened an agitation from October 2 ? Gandhi Jayanti ? if they did not apologise.

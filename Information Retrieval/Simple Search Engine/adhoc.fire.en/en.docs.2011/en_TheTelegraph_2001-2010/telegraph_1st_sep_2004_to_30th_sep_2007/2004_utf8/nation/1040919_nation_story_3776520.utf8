 Haj subsidy

 New Delhi, Sept. 18: The Election Commission today asked the Centre for clarifications after an announcement earlier this week that it was restoring the travel subsidy for Haj pilgrims.

 The commission took suo motu cognisance of newspaper reports quoting the minister of state for home, Sriprakash Jaiswal, that the UPA government was scrapping the changes made by the previous NDA regime in November on travel rules for Haj pilgrims.

 The NDA government had withdrawn the subsidy for income-tax payees. The decision has been opposed by the BJP which alleges that ?pseudo secular forces? were appeasing minorities.

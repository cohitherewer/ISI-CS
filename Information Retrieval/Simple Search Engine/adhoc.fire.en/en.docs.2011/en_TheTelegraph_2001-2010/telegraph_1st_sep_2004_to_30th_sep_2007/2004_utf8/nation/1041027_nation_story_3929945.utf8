 Political clash turns war

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Oct. 26: The caste-based war of attrition between two politicians of Dumraon in Buxar took a serious turn today as one person was killed and four seriously injured in police firing in Koran Sarai village.

 Supporters of arrested Congress leader Sanjay Tiwari turned violent, attacking a police team and setting their van on fire in an attempt to free their leader. In the police firing that ensued, one of Tiwari?s supporters was killed and over 12 policemen were hurt. 

 The angry supporters also brickbatted the vehicles of district magistrate Bipin Kumar and police superintendent .. Bhaskar, forcing the duo to take shelter in a phone booth.

 ?The brickbatting continued till late evening. Hundreds of villagers came out on the road and felled trees to block all movement on the Dumraon-Bikramganj highway. They are determined not to let the DM and the SP leave the place,? a witness said, terming the situation ?explosive?.

 The officials could not be contacted.

 Tiwari, who has unsuccessfully contested three Assembly elections from Dumraon, has a standing feud with sitting MLA Dadan Yadav Pehalwan. Sources said a small argument flared between their supporters yesterday, leading to an exchange of fire.

 Tiwari is a leader of the Brahmins who have a dominant presence in the Koran Sarai region. Pehalwan is a Yadav leader whose success in the last election is resented by the Tiwari group. Pehalwan has recently been appointed state Samajwadi Party chief.

 A police team led by Bhaskar went to arrest Tiwari today. The attempt was strongly opposed by his supporters, who demanded that similar action should be taken against Pehalwan and his supporters as well.

 As the police proceeded to round up Tiwari, his supporters began attacking them. The supporter killed has been identified as Harendra Kumar.

 ?Police came to Koran Sarai on the pretext of searching the premises of Tiwari. They engaged Tiwari in conversation and suddenly said they would arrest him. Soon the police were at the receiving end as they lost control of the situation. The area rarely has electricity and anything can happen at night,? a source in Buxar said.

 Tiwari has gone ?underground? after his supporters managed to free him.

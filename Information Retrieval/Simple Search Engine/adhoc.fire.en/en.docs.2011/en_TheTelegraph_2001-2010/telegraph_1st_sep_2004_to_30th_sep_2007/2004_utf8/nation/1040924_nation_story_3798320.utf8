 Kin kidnap scare revisits Mufti

 Srinagar: The ghost of Rubaiya Sayeed?s 

 abduction in 1989 came back to haunt chief minister Mufti 

 Mohammad Sayeed on Thursday when news spread that his nephew 

 had been taken away by gunmen from Anantnag district along 

 with another resident of the area, reports our correspondent.

 The wave of panic that swept the administration ebbed when the BSF admitted having taken Mufti Sarwar ? the eldest son of a cousin of the chief minister ? and Muzamil Ahmed into custody.

 Mufti Sayeed?s relatives told police that gunmen took Sarwar and Ahmed from their homes in Bejibehara town in south Kashmir ? the hometown of the chief minister. Police rushed to the spot and launched a search.

 The news brought back memories of the abduction of Mufti?s daughter when he was Union home minister. Rubaiya was released by the Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front in exchange for several jailed militants.

 Five hours after Mufti?s nephew and neighbour had been ?taken away?, the BSF admitted having taken them into custody. 

 BSF officer, however, said: ?They were picked up during a routine check near Awantipore. They were handed over to the local police once their identities were established.? 

 Gamblers held after 51 years

 Thiruvananthapuram: Two men who had escaped 

 a police raid on wayside gamblers have found that nemesis 

 can catch up even half a century later, reports our correspondent. 

 Kumaran, 80, and his neighbour K. Ramakrishnan, 83, had been booked in a case of gambling, registered by Chalakkudy police station in Thrissur district 51 years ago.

 On March 15, 1953, a police team cracked down on roadside gamblers and arrested Paily Kutty. The rest of the gang, including Kumaran and Ramakrishnan, fled. Kutty paid a fine of Re 1 at the magistrate?s court in Thrissur but Kumaran and Ramakrishnan escaped the penalty.

 The case sprang to life when Chalakkudy police learnt that senior police officers would focus on long-pending cases during an inspection.

 Ramakrishnan and Kumaran got the shock of their lives when the police came looking for them. Both had no option but to surrender before the court.

 On Monday, when the case was called for hearing, the judge chided the police for sleeping over it all these years. Finally, he acquitted the duo.

 CPI warns Centre

 New Delhi, Sept. 5 (PTI): The CPI today said the performance of the United Progressive Alliance was not that encouraging in an assessment of the Congress-led coalitions 100 days in office. 

 The CPI also attacked the alliance for taking Left parties too much for granted.

 We are not that encouraged by the 100 days. People have great expectations from the UPA government. However, many of these expectations remain to be fulfilled. We are a bit disappointed, party general secretary A.B. Bardhan told reporters.

 Bardhan said the Centre had formulated major policies without consulting the Left and asked for a thorough review of the new foreign trade policy. But he added that the government had to face many obstacles because of the obstructive tactics of the BJP.

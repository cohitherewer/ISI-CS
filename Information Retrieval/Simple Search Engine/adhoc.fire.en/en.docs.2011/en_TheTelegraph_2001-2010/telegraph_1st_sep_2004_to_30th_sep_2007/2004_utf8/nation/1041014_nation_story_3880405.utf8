 Snowfall in Himachal

 Shimla, Oct. 13 (PTI): Himachal Pradesh?s tribal valleys of Kaza, Lahaul and Pangi remained cut off for the third day today and hundreds of vehicles remained stranded as the area saw a spell of snowfall.

 Efforts to open Rohtang Pass, the gateway to Lahaul and Pangi valleys, were futile. Minimum temperature ranged between -10 and -15 degrees in the higher altitude areas.

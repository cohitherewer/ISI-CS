The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 House goes live on DD

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 13: Parliament proceedings will be shown live on two exclusive Doordarshan channels from tomorrow. 

 The new channels, DD-LS and DD-RS, will air the proceedings of the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha from 11 am till the time the House transacts business.

 While the Lok Sabha channel will be launched by Speaker Somnath Chatterjee, Rajya Sabha chairman Bhairon Singh Shekhawat will open the other at a function in Central Hall tomorrow at 10.30 am.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and information and broadcasting minister Jaipal Reddy will address the function.

 Initially, only question hour between 11 am and noon was telecast live throughout the country. After the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government assumed office, Chatterjee took the initiative to cover zero hour as well.

 But since Doordarshan provided only a low power transmitter, the telecast of zero hour could be seen only by people residing within a radius of 12 km from Parliament.

 The live telecast of proceedings is expected to improve the quality of debate and attendance, especially during the post-lunch session.

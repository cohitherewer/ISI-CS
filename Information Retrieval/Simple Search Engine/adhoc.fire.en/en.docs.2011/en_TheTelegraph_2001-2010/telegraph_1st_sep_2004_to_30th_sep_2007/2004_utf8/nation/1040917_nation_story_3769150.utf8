 EC notice on tiranga yatra

 New Delhi, Sept 16: The Election Commission today questioned the BJP?s use of the national flag in Uma Bharti?s tiranga yatra and gave it a week to respond to a petition demanding the procession be stopped in poll-bound Maharashtra.

 Supreme Court lawyer Brijesh Kalappa said in a petition to the poll panel that the model code of conduct had been in force in Maharashtra since August 24. Citing section 123 (3) of the Representation of People Act 1951, Kalappa said soliciting votes by using national symbols was deemed a ?corrupt practice? under the model code. He said the action taken against the BJP was too mild and the yatra should have been stopped in Maharashtra under the Election Symbols Order.

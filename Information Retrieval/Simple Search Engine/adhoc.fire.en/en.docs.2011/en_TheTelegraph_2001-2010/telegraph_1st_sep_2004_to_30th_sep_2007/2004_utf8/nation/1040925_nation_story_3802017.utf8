 Rape term for husband

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 Lucknow, Sept. 24: A little over two years and the wheel has come full circle.

 Two years ago, Madhumita Agarwal had gone running to police crying that a youth had raped her. Yesterday, a Baghpat court ruled that Narendra Agarwal ? now her legally wedded husband ? was guilty of raping her.

 Narendra, 26, has been awarded seven years rigorous imprisonment and fined Rs 10,000 by the fast-track court of B.. Kesharwani in Bagpat, about 520 km from here.

 Although the duo had eloped on July 4, 2002, from the Mandi Tatiri area of Baghpat and gone into hiding for 20 days, Madhumita had filed an FIR around the same time, saying she had been raped by Narendra many times. The two married at the Baghpat Arya Samaj centre in November that year.

 According to the complaint lodged at Aminanagar police station, Narendra took Madhumita to a friend?s place and got physically intimate with her without her consent. By the time the police filed charges against him, the two were married.

 When the matter came up for hearing before the court, Madhumita stuck to her complaint. ?I may be his wife now but he had committed rape on me. The physical relations I had with him were without my consent,? she alleged.

 Narendra pleaded his act could not be called rape because Madhumita had reciprocated. ?Although my client was not married at the time of the incident, the alleged forced sex could not be termed as rape because it was based on mutual consent,? his advocate said.

 As the trial proceeded, Madhumita got torn between her complaint and her husband. Although she stuck to her guns for the larger part, she is believed to have changed her mind of late and wanted to retract her case.

 Since the verdict, Madhumita has shut out the media. She has refused to make any comment though women activists hailed her as a ?gritty lady? and termed the judgment ?revolutionary?. She was scared her marriage would break up, a relative said.

 Narendra, in custody now, looked composed. Claiming the order was open to challenge, he said: ?I will appeal against this order.? 

 He said the verdict would have no impact on his marriage. ?I know I am not guilty and I will come out clean,? he said.

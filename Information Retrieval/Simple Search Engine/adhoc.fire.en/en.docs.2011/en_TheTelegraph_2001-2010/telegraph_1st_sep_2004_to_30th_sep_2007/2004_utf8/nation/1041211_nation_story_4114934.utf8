 Eviction protester dies of burns

 CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA

 Mumbai, Dec. 10: A man who set himself ablaze in protest against the demolition of slums here yesterday died this morning even as the city carried on with its drive to demolish the hutments in its bid to become better than Shanghai.

 Rajendra Srivastava, a resident of the Pereirawadi slum on Juhu Tara Road, in the western suburb of Juhu, had doused himself with kerosene and set himself on fire yesterday as bulldozers belonging to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) flying squad razed his slum. He was admitted to Cooper Hospital with severe burns. This morning he died.

 Police said Srivastava had tried to commit suicide by injuring himself on the head with a large stone on another occasion, too, when the municipality workers arrived to bring down the slum structures. The police added that he had a criminal record and used to make money illegally out of renting out hutments in the slum area.

 The BMC spokesperson said the current drive to demolish ?all unauthorised structures? would carry on unabated.

 The drive started on Wednesday, with the BMC giving the green light to bring down 45,000-odd hutments that came up after 1995. It says the hutments have cropped up in the slums in 24 wards all over Mumbai. If the drive is carried out, it would render homeless a substantial section of Mumbai?s residents. As much as 55 per cent of the city?s population lives in the slums that have cropped up all over the city.

 The drive comes a month after the new state government was formed, with municipal commissioner Johny Joseph issuing a message to carry out the demolition and take strict action in case of opposition from residents. ?The municipal commissioner gave the order following deputy chief minister and home minister R.R. Patil?s decision to go ahead with the drive,? said the BMC spokesperson.

 He added that 44,172 unauthorised structures at 317 locations, from Colaba in south Mumbai to Dahisar in north Mumbai and Mulund on the central line, were to be demolished in a month. ?About 5,000 structures have been demolished in two days,? he added.

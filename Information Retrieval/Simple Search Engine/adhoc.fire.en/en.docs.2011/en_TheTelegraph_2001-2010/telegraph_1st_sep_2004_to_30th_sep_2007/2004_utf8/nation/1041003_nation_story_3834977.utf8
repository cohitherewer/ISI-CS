 Migrants give Cong migraine

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 2: The presence of the Samajwadi Party in 80 of Maharashtra?s 288 Assembly constituencies has the Congress worried and the BJP pleased.

 The party?s decision to contest so many seats in the October 13 polls has prompted such diverse reactions because it is expected to cut into the Muslim and ?Uttar Bharat (heartland)? votes which normally go en bloc to the Congress.

 These votes are concentrated in and around Mumbai, home to thousands of migrants from eastern Uttar Pradesh and west Bihar. During May?s Lok Sabha elections, Muslims and ?Uttar Bharatis? plumped for the Congress, ensuring a near sweep of Mumbai.

 But Congress sources are uncertain of an encore in the Assembly polls. ?These elections are more localised and the constituencies are smaller. So local relationships get magnified. For instance, if a SP (Samajwadi Party) or Congress leader has relatives in a particular constituency, the biradari (clan) network proves useful. Some percentage of voters will always vote for the sake of honouring a familial relationship. Party labels count much more in a parliamentary election,? they said.

 Most of the Uttar Pradesh migrants hail from Pratapgrah, Jaunpur and Azamgarh districts. Looking to exploit the biradari sentiment, the Samajwadi Party has lined up controversial minister Raja Bhaiyya to camp in Mumbai and canvas for Pratapgarh votes since he belongs to the district. 

 Others Samajwadis likely to campaign are Jaunpur MP Parasnath Yadav, party general secretary Amar Singh who hails from Azamgarh and chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav?s brother Shivpal Yadav.

 The Congress hopes railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav will be able to counter the ?Mulayam Singh Yadav effect? among Yadavs, who are concentrated in Mumbai?s north-east suburbs.

 Congress sources also rued that only one ?Uttar Bharati?, minister of state for home Kripa Shankar Singh has been deployed. 

 They are hoping that the ?dominant? Marathi-speaking votes will go in favour of the Congress and Nationalist Congress Party even if migrant votes are split.

 The BJP, on the other hand, is banking on the Samajwadi Party to deliver those seats in Mumbai where it drew a blank five months ago. Party sources say they are not hopeful of getting migrants? votes because poll partner Shiv Sena has antagonised them with its ?Marathi-centric? outlook.

 Uttar Pradesh BJP leaders Rajnath Singh and Kalyan Singh, who were initially keen to campaign in the metropolis, have been asked not to ?overdo? it.

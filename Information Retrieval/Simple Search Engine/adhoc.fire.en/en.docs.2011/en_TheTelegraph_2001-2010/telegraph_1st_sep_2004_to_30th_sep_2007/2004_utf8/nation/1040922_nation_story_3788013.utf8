 Uma dares Sonia to duel

 KAY BENEDICT

 Agra, Sept. 21: Uma Bharti today challenged Sonia Gandhi to a ?face-to-face? debate and poked fun at CPM veteran Harkishen Singh Surjeet?s age as the firebrand sanyasin marched into Uttar Pradesh, her acid tongue sharpened by 12 days on the road.

 The BJP leader, whose tiranga (Tricolour) yatra criss-crossed several states before entering the heartland this morning, said the Congress chief should be ready for the verbal duel over national self-respect and development when the protest parade reaches Delhi.

 ?If she does not accept the challenge, I will expose her,? Uma said at a news conference in this Taj Mahal town, adding that they could also face off after September 25, the day the yatra ends in Punjab?s Jallianwala Bagh.

 The 3,526-km yatra from Hubli, Karnataka, is in protest against Uma?s recent imprisonment in the Congress-ruled state for a controversial flag hoisting 10 years ago.

 The former Madhya Pradesh chief minister, who welcomed senior colleague .K. Advani?s statement that a new leader will lead the party in the next elections, made fun of Surjeet, saying she was perplexed to still see his ?shakal? (face). 

 ?Last 10-20 years, I am tired of seeing him. Don?t they have another leader? Why don?t they have a younger leader?? said the 43-year-old, dressed in a light ochre robe.

 When a reporter asked if she had taken the place of party colleague Narendra Modi, who had once said older leaders should make way for younger ones, she shot back: ?Everyone has his or her own place.?

 Uma?s news conference was, however, low key compared to her party colleague Sushma Swaraj?s satyagraha in Port Blair. 

 Led by Sushma, about 150 BJP MPs and MLAs today marched with a plaque inscribed with Hindu Mahasabha leader Veer Savarkar?s words, demanding its restoration at the memorial for freedom fighters in the Cellular Jail, but courted arrest when local authorities stopped them.

 Uma?s main target was Sonia. She said the Congress chief need not think it below her dignity to face her in a duel of words. ?I have been the chief minister of Madhya Pradesh, whereas Sonia Gandhi is only a member of Parliament and UPA (United Progressive Alliance) chairperson,? she said.

 ?I have been asking questions to her but she is silent. I think she does not know how to answer. She is not just the widow of Rajiv Gandhi, or daughter-in-law of Indira Gandhi or granddaughter-in-law of Pandit Nehru, she is the UPA chairperson. She sets the agenda for the government.?

 The questions Uma wants to ask Sonia are: 

 What does the Congress 

 chief have to say about the insult to the tiranga in Ludhiana 

 (Uma did not care to explain)

 Her response to the Kerala 

 government?s omission of Gujarat from the national anthem

 Why a case over the flag 

 hoisting was filed against her ?when three Congress chief 

 ministers did not consider it for 10 years?.

 What does Sonia have to 

 say about the then Digvijay Singh government?s dropping 

 of a case against some people in Madhya Pradesh who had 

 burnt the Tricolour and hoisted the Pakistani flag?

 Rs 5-crore haul from excise boss

 OUR BUREAU AND AGENCIES

 Mumbai, Sept. 23: The CBI has seized assets worth Rs 5 crore from the commissioner of central excise in the country?s biggest confiscation of property from a government servant.

 The bureau raided P.K. Ajwani?s home in Andheri yesterday following a complaint from a textile merchant based in Vasai in Thane district.

 Today, it raided the home of a friend in Nana Chowk in south Mumbai. The CBI believes Ajwani operated with two accomplices.

 The bureau said it found only Rs 12.25 lakh on raiding Ajwani?s home. But there were hints that some money had been hastily moved elsewhere, said CBI superintendent Kiran Jadhav.

 Jadhav said his team gathered information and raided the house of Ajwani?s friend, Kumar Gandhi, this morning, from where Rs 2.76 crore that the commissioner had allegedly moved out from his Andheri flat was seized.

 The CBI also seized documents suggesting investment by Ajwani worth nearly Rs 1.50 crore in real estate and Rs 50 lakh in shares, insurance and other securities.

 The raids took place after the textile merchant lodged a complaint, alleging Ajwani had accepted Rs 60 lakh from him to clear his excise case but demanded Rs 90 lakh more.

 The CBI laid a trap but later raided Ajwani?s suburban Andheri house on a tip-off that a large sum of money was kept there.

 The excise commissioner got himself admitted to Jaslok hospital complaining of chest pain.

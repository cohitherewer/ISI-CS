 Amnesty for rein on MNCs 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 29: Amnesty International, Greenpeace and other non-governmental organisations are working towards establishing a legal framework to make multinational corporations more accountable to people?s needs.

 The organisations feel that only a world body like the UN can bring multinational corporations with enormous financial resources to book. The move comes in the wake of the Centre reaching an understanding with Union Carbide that many feel does not compensate the victims of the 1984 Bhopal gas tragedy.

 ?Human rights have been violated on a massive scale, including people?s rights to life and health. A framework based on the UN norms for business could be used to hold companies accountable for their human rights impact,? said a report released today by Amnesty.

 The report said the site of the Bhopal gas tragedy has not been cleaned properly. Union Carbide has still not stopped the pollution that began when the plant started operations in 1970, alleges the report. This implies that residents of the area continue to be exposed to contaminated drinking water, it said.

 The report pointed out that the tragedy continues to ruin lives of people living in the surrounding areas and the contaminated environment affects people?s basic human rights. 

 The rights body said the Centre must make a full assessment of health and environmental impacts. ?A generation on, survivors are still waiting for just compensation and adequate medical care,? it said.

 Amnesty said the government had failed to adequately protect the citizens before and after the disaster.

 The group alleged that Union Carbide stored hazardous chemicals in bulk, failed to set up an emergency plan to warn residents of the area, ignored warnings about the possibility of a chemical reaction similar to that which had caused the 1984 leak and withheld information critical to the medical treatment of victims.

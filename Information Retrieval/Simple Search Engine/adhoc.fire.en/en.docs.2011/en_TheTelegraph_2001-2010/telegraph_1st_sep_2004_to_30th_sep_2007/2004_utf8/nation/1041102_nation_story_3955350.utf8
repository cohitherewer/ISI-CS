 Gawli held for assault on scribe

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Nov. 1: He was in even before he stepped into the House.

 Two weeks after being elected an MLA, gangster-turned-politician Arun Gawli was arrested for assaulting a reporter even as the new chief minister was sworn in today.

 However, he was released on bail later on a surety bond of Rs 3,000 each, sources said.

 Police this evening arrested Gawli ? who had several cases of murder and extortion against him but was let off because of lack of evidence ? for attacking Mateen Hafeez, a reporter with an English daily, when he went to Gawli?s residence at Dagdi Chawl to interview him.

 Two of Gawli?s men were arrested last night. They were also released on bail. 

 The MLA was arrested on charges of criminal intimidation, wrongful restraint and causing hurt, deputy commissioner of police Ashok Dongre said.

 Hafeez, who had an appointment with Gawli late in the afternoon yesterday, alleged that Gawli slapped him and his bodyguards assaulted him in the course of the interview.

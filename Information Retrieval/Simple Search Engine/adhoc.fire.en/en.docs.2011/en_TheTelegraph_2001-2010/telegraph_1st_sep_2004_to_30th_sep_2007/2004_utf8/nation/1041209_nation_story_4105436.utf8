 Kargil salute from Kalam

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Jammu, Dec. 8: The President today turned poet for the men who man the border in the inhospitable heights of Kargil.

 In his first visit to the rugged Himalayan terrain ? also the first by a President ? A.P.J. Abdul Kalam lauded the troops for their ?courage and bravery?, completing the praise with a personal tribute. He recited Seema Kay Prahri ( Defender of the Border), a poem he has written in recognition of the role played by the jawans.

 ?By protecting our borders, you have allowed us to focus on developmental works in the country,? he told the 14 Corps, which was carved out of the army?s 15 Corps after the Kargil war with Pakistan in the summer of 1999.

 ?I congratulate you for the victory in Kargil which is a reflection of courage and bravery. Kargil is an important part of our country and I am proud of your morale and deeds,? Kalam, who was on a one-day visit to Jammu and Kashmir, said.

 The President, who is also the supreme commander of the Indian armed forces, was accompanied by army chief Gen. N.C. Vij and general officer commanding-in-chief, Northern Command, Lt Gen. Hari Prasad.

 Kalam sought to boost the morale of the troops. ?You are here on an important mission and you have been entrusted with ensuring the security of the nation,? he told them. ?I want to assure you that you live in every Indian heart.? He said the government was acquiring latest weapons and equipment for the army, especially in border areas like Kargil.

 He administered a five-point oath to the jawans. ?I am proud that I am member of the Indian Army, which has a great tradition,? he said, asking them to repeat after him. ?I will always achieve victory and take my nation towards victory. I will be a model citizen and in case need arises, I will extend all help and assistance to my countrymen. I will celebrate with pride the victories of my nation and countrymen. My flag is my life.?

 The general officer commanding, 14 Corps, Lt Gen. M.L. Naidu presented a memento to the President. Kalam gave a memento each to Naidu, the general officer commanding, Mountain Division, and the commander of the Infantry Brigade. He also distributed cashew nuts among the troops and had tea with them.

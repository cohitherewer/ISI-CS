 YSR ticks off babus

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, Sept. 24: Faced with instances of apparent indiscipline, Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy today told his bureaucrats he would not tolerate any nonsense from them.

 The Andhra Pradesh chief minister spelt out the dos and don?ts to the heads of departments in the wake of then health secretary Bhale Rao vetoing his decision to shift an official of the health ministry.

 Rao was suspended two days ago following an inquiry by the anti-corruption bureau.

 Hardly a week ago, bureaucrats of the transport and commercial taxes departments had vetoed a cabinet decision on a new approach to revenue collection.

 The heads of both departments 

 escaped disciplinary action by passing the buck to juniors.

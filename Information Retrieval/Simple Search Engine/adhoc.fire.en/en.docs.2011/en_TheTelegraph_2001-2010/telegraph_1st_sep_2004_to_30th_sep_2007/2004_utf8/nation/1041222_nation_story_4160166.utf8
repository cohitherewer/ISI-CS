 Rights cry before king touchdown

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 21: Ordinary Nepalese are the most affected by the battle between the Royal Nepal Army and Maoist rebels, say the country?s rights activists.

 Their opinion is reflected in a report, Caught Between a Rock and a Hard Place, that has been brought out two days before King Gyanendra arrives in India for a state visit.

 The report, circulated among opinion-makers here, is clearly aimed at putting pressure both on the palace and South Block to take the human rights situation in Nepal more seriously.

 The activists say most of the 10,000-odd people who have died since the Maoist rebellion began in 1996 were civilians from vulnerable sections ? the rural poor, Dalits and indigenous communities. The situation has worsened in the past two years since the king took over and deployed the army to crush the rebels, they said.

 ?Civilians supporting neither side are often faced with fateful choices,? said Dinesh Prasain, coordinator of the Collective Campaign for Peace, a rights group in Nepal.

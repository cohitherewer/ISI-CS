 Army test

 New Delhi, Sept. 23: A woman?s charge that she was asked to go through a gynaecological examination conducted by men in the army during recruitment tests has been denied by defence headquarters, says our special correspondent.

 Surya Moudgal, a candidate for short service commission in Allahabad, and the leader of the CPM-affiliated All India Democratic Women?s Association, Brinda Karat, yesterday alleged that women aspirants were forced to go through gynaecological tests conducted by men.

 An army spokesman said Moudgal was among three women candidates who had objected to being examined by male surgeons. 

 He added that according to rules, medical examinations of women candidates are carried out by men only in the presence of a woman attendant or nurse after getting the consent of the candidates. 

 When Moudgal and the others objected, they were given the option of going through the examination by a lady gynaecologist in Delhi. ?Of the three candidates, two were examined by a male surgical specialist and a lady gynaecologist. However, Ms Moudgal objected to examination by the male surgical specialist. So her medical examination which is essential to the selection process could not be completed,? the spokesman said.

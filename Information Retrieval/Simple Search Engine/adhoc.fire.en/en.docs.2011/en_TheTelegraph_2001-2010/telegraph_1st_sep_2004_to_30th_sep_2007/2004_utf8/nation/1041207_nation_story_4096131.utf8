 Authors in space concern

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Dec. 6: Eminent authors Manoj Das and Sunil Gangopadhyay have expressed their concern over the rapidly reducing space for literature in mainstream media.

 Speaking at ?New Voices?, a conference, which gave young writers the opportunity to interact with each other as well as eminent literary personalities, the Pondicherry-based Das recollected that leading Indian English magazines had promoted his literary career by carrying his stories when he was young. However, there are few such magazines left in this age of rampant consumerism, he rued. 

 The conference, hosted by Sahitya Akademi, ended yesterday. Sahitya Akademi vice-president Sunil Gangopadhyay said age does not define an author?s creativity, as several writers became famous while they were young. There is keen competition among the new writers, he added.

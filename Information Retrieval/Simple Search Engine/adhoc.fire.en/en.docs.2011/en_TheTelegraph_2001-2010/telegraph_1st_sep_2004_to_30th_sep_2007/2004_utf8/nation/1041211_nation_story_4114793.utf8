 SC notice to Centre on migrants

 R. VENKATARAMAN

 New Delhi, Dec. 10: The Supreme Court today issued notices to the Centre on the unchecked flow of Bangladeshi immigrants into the country on a petition urging the problem should not be viewed with a ?misconceived perception on secularism?.

 A three-judge bench admitted a PIL by the India Image Foundation alleging that over 3,00,000 Bangladeshi immigrants were entering India every year.

 The petition listed Bengal as a major recipient of such immigrants. It also said the Assamese faced the danger of being reduced to a minority in their home state as Bangladeshi immigrants would soon outnumber them.

 The court is already seized of the matter on a similar PIL by the All India Lawyers? Forum for Civil Liberties pleading that the Bangladeshi immigrants be deported. 

 But the issue in this PIL is a repeal of the Illegal Migrants (Determination by Tribunal) Act.

 Today?s petition sought a CBI probe into the presence of over two crore immigrants and urged that their names be struck off the electoral rolls in various states as they adversely affected the country?s security and demographic composition.

 The problem was not confined to Bengal or Assam, it said. Immigrants had infiltrated into Bihar, Delhi, Maharashtra and even Orissa, ?where reports with regard to presence of illegal Bangladeshi migrants have appeared in the media?. Tripura, Nagaland and Meghalaya were also affected.

 The petition contended immigrants caused an alarming growth in population, leading to change in demographic pattern, enrolment in the electoral rolls, adverse impact on development and serious threat to national security.

 ?As a result of population movement from Bangladesh, the indigenous people of Assam are being reduced to a minority in their own home state,? it said. 

 As much as 85 per cent of the total encroached forestland in Assam was in the hands of the migrants, who have a major say in 43 of 126 Assembly constituencies. 

 ?? one can imagine what is the dimension of illegal migrants deciding victory in about 43 constituencies, which is quite close to the figure of the majority mark (64) and understandably vote bank politics grows around this calculation.?

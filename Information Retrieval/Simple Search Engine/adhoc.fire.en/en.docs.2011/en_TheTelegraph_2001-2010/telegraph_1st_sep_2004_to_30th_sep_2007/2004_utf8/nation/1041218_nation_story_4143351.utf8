 Election roster put up

 New Delhi, Dec. 17: The 

 Election Commission today announced the schedule for Assembly 

 elections in Bihar, Jharkhand and Haryana in February next 

 year.

 Bihar and Jharkhand will go to polls in three phases on February 3, 15 and 23; Haryana will vote on February 3, chief election commissioner T.S. Krishnamurthy announced here today.

 Votes will be counted on February 27 and the entire election process will be completed by March 5, he said.

 The term of the 243-member Bihar Assembly and 81-member Jharkhand House ends on March 6 and that of the 90-strong Haryana Assembly two days later.

 The model code of conduct for the three governments, the Centre (as regards the three states) and political parties became effective with the announcement of the poll schedule, Krishnamurthy said.

 The states and the Centre are thus barred from making any policy announcement until the process ends.

 But Union finance minister P. Chidambaram need not worry when he presents the Congress-led government?s second but first full-fledged budget on February 28. The polling would be over by then, with the results expected by February 27 evening.

 The voting, Krishnamurthy said, would be conducted through electronic voting machines in all three states.

 The governor of Haryana will issue the poll notification for his state on January 10. His counterparts in Bihar and Jharkhand will issue separate notifications on January 10, 20 and 29 for each phase of polling, Krishnamurthy said.

 The filing of nominations will begin on January 17 for the first phase and on January 27 and February 5 for the next two phases.

 Krishnamurthy expressed satisfaction at the security arrangements for the polls in the three states.

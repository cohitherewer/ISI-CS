 Cong wins in Arunachal

 SAMIR K. PURKAYASTHA

 Guwahati, Oct. 11: Political astuteness is likely to get preference over loyalty to party when the Arunachal Pradesh Congress Legislature Party (CLP) meets on Wednesday to elect its leader.

 The Congress secured a majority in the 60-member Assembly, winning 34 seats. Three of its candidates were elected unopposed. Independents emerged as the second largest bloc with 13 seats.

 A senior Congress leader said over phone from Itanagar that incumbent chief minister Gegong Apang was almost certain to be elected CLP leader despite toppling the Congress government headed by PCC chief Mukut Mithi barely a year ago. He said the party was more concerned about political stability than loyalty, as epitomised by Mithi.

 Apang and his band of party-hoppers ? most of them from the Congress ? had joined forces with the BJP after the successful coup. But maintaining the pattern of his political career, he ditched the BJP before the polls and returned to the Congress after a gap of nearly a decade.

 The BJP, however, put up its best electoral performance in the state without Apang. The party not only opened its account in the hilly state, but surprised everyone by winning a total of 9 seats. The Nationalist Congress Party and the Arunachal Congress, which was floated by Apang in the mid-90s, won two seats each.

 The 13 victorious Independents formed a bloc under the leadership of . Pinch and said they would extend support to a Congress government led by Apang. Most of these Independents were Congress members who had been denied tickets. 

 ?As most of the newly-elected Congress legislators are his loyalists, Apang is in a better position to provide a stable government in the state,? a source said. 

 Mithi will probably have to be content with the deputy chief minister?s post. Some of his loyalists, including former cabinet minister and confidant Takam Sanjoy, lost their seats.

 A source said Mithi was resigned to his fate, and it became evident when he himself declared that stability rather than loyalty to the party should be the criterion for choosing the leadership. 

 ?In the Congress Legislature Party (CLP) meeting, we will discuss whether to create a post of deputy chief minister,? Apang said over his cellphone. He said the CLP leader would be elected unanimously by the Congress legislators ?with the consent of Madam Sonia Gandhi?.

 Apang ruled out clashing with Mithi, saying the Opposition was ?spreading such baseless rumours?. 

 ?We are together and will work together to complete the unfinished task of my previous government,? he said. 

 The CLP will meet in Itanagar and a senior Congress leader from the Centre is likely to attend the meeting as observer. Congress Working Committee member and party in-charge for Arunachal Pradesh Ramesh Chennithala is already camping in the state. 

 Former Union minister Omak Apang, who is the incumbent chief minister?s son, and former deputy chief minister and senior BJP leader Kameng Dolo are two of the prominent winners in the elections. The notable losers include former home minister . Wanglat, public works department minister Lechi Legi, parliamentary affairs minister T.. Rajkumar and Sanjoy.

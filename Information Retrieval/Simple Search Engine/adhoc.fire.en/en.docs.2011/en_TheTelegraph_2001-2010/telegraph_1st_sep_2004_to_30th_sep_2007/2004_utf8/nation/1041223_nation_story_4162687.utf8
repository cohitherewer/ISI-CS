 Atal visits PM with seer plea 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 22: Atal Bihari Vajpayee today led an National Democratic Alliance team to meet Manmohan Singh, urging him to ensure that ?humane? treatment is meted out to Kanchi seer Jayendra Saraswati.

 The delegation accused the Tamil Nadu government of declaring an ?all-out war? against the Kanchi mutt and urged Singh to take up the matter with chief minister Jayalalithaa.

 The NDA leaders submitted a memorandum demanding that among other things the seer be shifted from Vellore jail and ?interned in some guesthouse as he is an accused and not a criminal?.

 The team, that included leader of Opposition L.K. Advani and BJP deputy leader in the Rajya Sabha, Sushma Swaraj, urged the Prime Minister to ?redress the harassment? of the mutt and its pontiff.

 The Opposition leaders submitted the report of a fact-finding mission led by BJP Rajya Sabha MP Balbir Punj. The mission visited the mutt and met the seer at Vellore jail last week, NDA sources said.

 The report says the Tamil Nadu government has declared ?an all-out war? in the guise of a murder probe and there were attempts to tarnish the ancient institution?s reputation. The leaders also said mutt inmates were being ?allured and tortured? to make statements against the seer.

 When Singh said Jayalalithaa had assured him that the seer was being treated well, Vajpayee said there was a ?lot of difference? between her written assurances and reality.

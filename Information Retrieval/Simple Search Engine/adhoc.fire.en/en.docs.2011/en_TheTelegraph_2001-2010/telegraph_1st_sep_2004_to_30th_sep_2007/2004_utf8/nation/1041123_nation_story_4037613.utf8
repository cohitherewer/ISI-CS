 Probe cry at Kalam door

 R. VENKATARAMAN

 New Delhi, Nov. 22: A memorandum submitted to President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam today detailed the ?real reasons? behind the arrest of Kanchi seer Jayendra Saraswati and demanded a CBI probe.

 The memorandum said the purchase of a ?hospital? by the Kanchi mutt trust was one of the three major reasons behind the seer?s arrest.

 This is the first time that Kalam, who met a delegation of the Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad and the Akhil Bharatiya Sant Samiti this afternoon, has given appointment on the acharya?s arrest.

 The 18-member delegation was led by the former president of the Supreme Court Bar Association, M.N. Krishnamani and included VHP leaders Ashok Singhal and Vishnu Hari Dalmia.

 Tamil Nadu Hospital was being run by an NRI who sold it to the Kanchi mutt trust as the seer wanted to run a medical college and have a free wing and ward for the poor.

 The memorandum said ?this? and ?two other personal reasons? provoked the Tamil Nadu chief minister to order the acharya?s arrest.

 It said the Kanchi seer had observed Jayalalithaa?s ?ego is the only reason for her defeat? after the ADMK drew a blank in the 2004 Lok Sabha elections. Besides, the seer had expressed inability to help Jayalalithaa in her case.

 A PIL was also filed today in the Supreme Court by B.P. Singhal, the brother of Ashok Singhal, accusing Tamil Nadu police of ?bias? and seeking a CBI probe.

 DMK leader M. Karunanidhi also said today that Jayalalithaa?s ?personal vengeance and motives? were behind the seer?s arrest. 

 The memorandum said the arrest clearly showed Jayalalithaa?s ?personal mala fides? and the failure of the ?rule of law and democracy?.

 VHP bandh

 Today?s bandh called by the VHP to protest the arrest of Kanch seer Jayendra Saraswati evoked lukewarm response across the country.

 Only in Chhhattisgarh did the bandh make its presence felt. Incidents of violence from reported from several areas in the state capital Raipur. Business establishments downed their shutters and buses stayed off the road.

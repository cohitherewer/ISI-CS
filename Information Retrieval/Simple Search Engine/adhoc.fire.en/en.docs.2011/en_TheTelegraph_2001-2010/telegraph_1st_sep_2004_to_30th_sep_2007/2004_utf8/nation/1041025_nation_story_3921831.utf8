 Advani and Sangh play super selector 

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN 

 New Delhi, Oct. 24: As 

 the Vishwa Hindu Parishad persisted with its attack on the 

 BJP, new party president L. K. Advani reiterated that there 

 was no need to be ?apologetic? about ?our beliefs? in the 

 RSS. 

 As Advani?s anointment will be formally ratified on October 27 by the BJP national council to fulfil a requirement of the party constitution, senior members have started lobbying for slots in the new team he is expected to announce soon. 

 Uma Bharti will end her seclusion in the Madmaheshwar temple in the Garhwal hills and return to the capital tonight or tomorrow, following a phone call from Advani. She had been refusing to come down despite complaints of chest pain and uneasiness. 

 A source close to Uma said she might return to Bhopal as the chief minister or will find a place in Advani?s central team as a general secretary. ?Advani has to decide this.? 

 The source said the RSS felt Uma ought to have been reinstated as chief minister once the Karnataka court did not press charges against her. Instead, she was made a ?victim? of an ?ego clash? with former president M. Venkaiah Naidu, which started when Uma accused him of sabotaging her tiranga yatra. 

 Among the other ?hard? decisions Advani will have to take is what to do with Pramod Mahajan. A BJP source said during a meeting yesterday at Nagpur, RSS sarsanghchalak K.S. Sudarshan indicated to Advani the Sangh would like a ?brand? new team to signal to the cadre that the BJP was serious about its future and not merely effecting cosmetic changes. 

 Mahajan is an obvious target having failed to deliver in the Lok Sabha polls and in Maharashtra. The source said he is likely to be dropped as a general secretary and kicked upstairs as a vice-president, tasked with training new entrants at the BJP?s Rambhau Mhalagi trust near Mumbai.

 Sushma Swaraj, deputy BJP leader in the Rajya Sabha, may be inducted as a general secretary. Among the others who could be in Advani?s team are Najma Heptullah, Arif Mohammad Khan, Ananth Kumar and Bandaru Dattatreya. 

 The source said Heptullah and Khan might be projected as the new Muslim ?faces? in place of Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi and Shahnawaz Hussain. But Naqvi, rated as an ?effective? spokesman, could be retained as one. 

 Of the present general secretaries, only Arun Jaitley is expected to be retained. Rajnath Singh and Shivraj Singh Chauhan might be made vice-presidents or sent to their respective states, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, to shoulder ?greater? responsibilities. 

 Former Delhi chief minister Madan Lal Khurana is likely to put in his papers tomorrow as Rajasthan governor after being assured by Advani that he would be made a member of the new national executive and could plunge himself in the capital?s politics again. 

 His first round of consultations with Sudarshan over, the BJP source said Advani will ?inform? Atal Bihari Vajpayee of the changes and execute them. 

 The source claimed the RSS had a ?decisive? say in party postings and cited Yashwant Sinha?s example. Sinha, who came to the BJP in 1993 from the Samajwadi Janata Party, did a Varun Gandhi in the early years by constantly paying obeisance to the RSS bosses. When the BJP first came to power, he landed the plum finance portfolio. 

 ?The bond between us and (the) RSS is so strong that we had to sever ties with the Janata Party and form the BJP in 1980 because we go by what we believe in. We change with times and our political line may take new turns but our ideology of nationalism remains the same,? Advani told party workers in Hyderabad today. 

 His assertions cut no ice with the VHP. Its leader Acharya Dharmendra said in Nagpur today that by paying allegiance to the RSS flag in Nagpur or Agra once a year, the BJP cannot transform the country.

 Jingle bells ring in Valley

 Srinagar, Dec. 19 (Reuters): As tourism makes a slow comeback in Kashmir, authorities are wooing visitors with Christmas and New Year celebrations, the first since trouble erupted 15 years ago.

 The message is simple ? the scenic Himalayan region with its snow-covered mountains is equally, if not more, beautiful in winter as it is in summer.

 ?We want to send a message across that Kashmir is normal and project it as a winter destination,? said Saleem Baig, head of the state?s tourism department. ?We expect a good response.?

 Baig said the department will organise Christmas celebrations at Gulmarg, a hill station popular for its skiing pistes. The action then shifts to Pahalgam, another hill station in southern Kashmir offering New Year?s eve parties on snow-covered slopes sprinkled with towering pine and chinar trees.

 ?Winter months have remained mostly off season here. But this year we have bookings on the eve of Christmas and New Year,? said Aksar Tunda, a houseboat owner in Srinagar.

 Tourism officials said 362,000 tourists, including thousands of foreigners, had visited Kashmir this summer compared to 191,000 in 2003.

 While that is still a small fraction of the two million tourists who came to Kashmir every year before militancy hit the region in 1989, it is a great leap from the annual figure of about 6,000 during the early years of the insurgency.

 ?The number is very encouraging.? Despite travel warnings, a good number of foreign tourists also visited the Valley,? Baig said, referring to foreign governments? advisories to their nationals to avoid Jammu and Kashmir. Tourism would boom if there were permanent peace, houseboat owner Tunda said. ?I wish peace returns. We will have business through the year,? he said.

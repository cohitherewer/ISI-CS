 Lawyers stall Uma release

 B.R. SRIKANTH

 Hubli, Aug. 31: Agitating lawyers today delayed Uma Bhartis early walk to freedom.

 The lawyers, on strike in all cities of north Karnataka, prevented public prosecutor S.A. Barigali and additional public prosecutor . Nagendra from entering Hubli court, which was to have heard the state governments plea for withdrawal of cases against the BJP leader. The court would take up the case tomorrow.

 The government in a surprise U-turn yesterday told Karnataka High Court that it stood by an earlier decision to drop charges against the former Madhya Pradesh chief minister, jailed for inciting riots 10 years ago. The high court directed the Hubli court, before which Uma had surrendered on August 25, to consider the governments application.

 The lawyers were protesting against the decision of Karnataka High Court Chief Justice .K. Jain, who has ruled out a bench for the region, citing reasons like lack of adequate number of cases and financial burden on the exchequer.

 In the morning, Prakash Jayawadige, a member of the Hubli Bar Association, entered the court hall packed with reporters and supporters of the BJP leader and asked all the lawyers to skip proceedings. The court had to be adjourned thrice during the day.

 In the afternoon, Mohammed Ismail, the judicial magistrate first class, ordered police to offer protection to Barigali and Nagendra, but the constable on duty returned to say that he could not get past the lawyers. The magistrate then adjourned the court for the day. He has asked the prosecution to submit in writing its request for withdrawing cases against Uma, who is in judicial custody. 

 Barigali and Nagendra said they were not able to get into the court even with police protection. 

 State BJP leaders Ananth Kumar and B.S. Yediyurappa meanwhile told a news conference that .K. Advani would go ahead with the satyagraha in Bangalore tomorrow to protest Umas imprisonment. The leader of Opposition in Parliament would call on Uma in the morning and reach Bangalore later in the day to launch the satyagraha. BJP central leaders Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi and Ved Prakash Goel would join Advani. 

 In Bangalore, chief minister Dharam Singh ruled out any U-turn in the stand of the state government on the question of withdrawal of prosecution.

 Delhi mulls veto trade-off

 PRANAY SHARMA

 New Delhi, Dec. 19: A debate appears to have begun in the Indian establishment on whether Delhi should accept a permanent seat in the UN Security Council even if it comes without the veto power.

 India, Japan, Germany and Brazil are some of the candidates keen to get into the Security Council if and when it is expanded to allow more permanent members in the high-profile body. 

 But discussions among the 180-odd member countries of the UN have not been completed on what shape an expanded Security Council would take and who will be its new members.

 The debate in different parts of the world has heated up in recent weeks after the UN Secretary-General?s office came out with a report outlining its views on restructuring the world body.

 Indian governments in the past few years have been keen to get a permanent seat in the Security Council. At present, it has only five such members ? the US, Britain, France, Russia and China. All of them are also the recognised nuclear powers.

 Highly-placed sources in the government said a review of the Indian stand was on whether it should accept a permanent seat if it was offered the membership without the veto power, which the permanent five have. 

 Till recently, the dominant view in India was that if it had to be included in the Security Council, it should be with the veto power.

 But now there seems to be a shift, or the beginning of one, in the Indian stand. It is now being argued that Delhi should adopt a ?step-by-step? approach and try to get into the UN as a permanent member, even if it has to compromise on the veto power.

 This view has been strengthened as there are far too many contenders for the Security Council seats and none of the countries which are keen to get into it are sure whether they would get the required support of the other UN members to secure a place.

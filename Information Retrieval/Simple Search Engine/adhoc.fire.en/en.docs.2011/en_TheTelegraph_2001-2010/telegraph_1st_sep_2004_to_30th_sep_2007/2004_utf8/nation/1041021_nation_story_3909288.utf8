The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Easy battle over, others ahead

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 20: The United Progressive Alliance government today won one of the easier battles with its allies when it got the Left to issue a ?no objection? certificate to the decision to raise the limit on foreign direct investment in domestic airlines.

 At the very outset of the FDI controversy, Left parties were opposed to an investment hike in all three sectors ? telecommunication, insurance and civil aviation.

 They later dropped a part of the civil aviation sector from their list with the government promising to bar foreign airlines from investing in domestic carriers.

 CPM and CPI leaders today agreed to a cabinet decision to raise the FDI cap in domestic airlines from 40 to 49 per cent. But there was no end in sight to the tussle over the FDI hike in telecom and insurance. 

 ?We do not have any objection to civil aviation because the government?s decision is restricted to domestic private airlines,? said CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury.

 Senior CPI leader D. Raja said: ?The decision should be confined to domestic airlines and the cap should not exceed 49 per cent.? The Left said it did not object to the decision because management control would still remain with the domestic airlines.

 Yechury underlined the Left?s reservations about allowing FDI in other areas of civil aviation like allowing foreign airlines to have a stake in domestic airlines or permitting privatisation of airports.

 Backed by Left trade unions, Airports Authority of India employees have refused to endorse airport privatisation. Though keen to push through the decision, the Centre has kept it in abeyance for now. 

 The issue of FDI hike in telecom and insurance is still hanging fire. ?The Left parties will meet in a day or two to give a response to the note given by the UPA government,? Raja said.

 Finance minister P. Chidambaram has in his note issued a point-by-point rebuttal of the Left?s arguments opposing the FDI hike in telecom.

 The government is sticking to its resolve to increase FDI in telecom and insurance despite the Left?s opposition. Chidambaram?s note seems to have answered many of the questions the Left raised in its note to the government.

 The Left?s main objection to the FDI hike in telecom is based on concerns of national security. In his note, Chidambaram has explained the safeguards the government is planning to take to prevent any breach in national security.

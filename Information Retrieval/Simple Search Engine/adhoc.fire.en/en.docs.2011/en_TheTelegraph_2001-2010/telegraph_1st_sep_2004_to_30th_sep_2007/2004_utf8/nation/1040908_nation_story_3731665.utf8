 Court asks BCCI for Zee file

 Mumbai, Sept. 7 (PTI): Bombay High Court today asked the Board of Control for Cricket in India to produce the file on the award of telecast rights to Zee Network for four years.

 A bench of Chief Justice D.S. Bhandari and Justice D.Y. Chandrachud has adjourned the case till Thursday.

 ESPN-STAR yesterday filed a writ petition challenging the BCCIs decision to award telecast rights of national and international matches in the country from October 2004 to September 2008 to Zee, for which a tender was floated earlier.

 The petition said Zee did not possess the required two years experience of telecasting international matches and claimed that awarding tender rights to Zee was a violation of the principle of natural justice.

 Red carpet for PWG 

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, Oct. 12: Five Naxalite leaders who will talk peace with the government from Friday arrived here this morning to the comforts of a state guesthouse.

 People?s War Group state secretary Ramakrishna has been put up in a big suite with bedroom, living room and dining room. His counterpart in the lesser known Jana Shakti group, Amar, is in a two-room suite. 

 The three others, the PWG?s Ganesh and Sudhakar and Jana Shakti?s Riaz, have been accommodated according to rank.

 The five along with 50-odd guards from their militia are living in air-conditioned rooms in the Manjira guesthouse on Begumpet Public Road.

 Also on hand are a conference hall, a gym, a saloon and round-the-clock medical care. A mini theatre has been set up in the guesthouse for the entertainment of the team of 105, including the 20-strong escort of each rebel leader.

 A police team set up to provide the group foolproof security has taken over the guesthouse. ?Besides threat from anti-Naxalite outfits like Nalla Dandu and Green Tigers, they also face the wrath of the families of police victims,? said a police superintendent. 

 A group of cooks, cleaners and attendants has been selected to stay with the rebels for the duration of the talks. 

 Five Qualis and two Scorpios were offered for the Naxalite leaders? travel but they opted for their own transport and drivers. 

 ?However risky it is for our lives and that of our comrades, we have come in the interests of the benefit of the talks to the people,? Ramakrishna told reporters.

 He iterated that coming for talks did not mean accepting parliamentary democracy or giving up armed struggle.

 The ?peace process?, he said, was part of his outfit?s armed struggle strategy to get social justice. Chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy ? likely to visit the guesthouse ? had taken a potshot at the PWG for ?playing to the gallery? with its firm stand on armed struggle.

 Israel date next month

 PRANAY SHARMA

 New Delhi, Oct. 19: The first major official contact between India and Israel since the Congress-led Centre came to power will happen next month when the two sides meet here for foreign office consultations.

 The meeting will be followed within days ? probably late November ? by another close interaction when the countries? joint working group on counter-terrorism meets here.

 There are strong indications that Israel may even reopen its consulate in Mumbai before the two meetings begin. It was closed some years ago because of lack of funds.

 But the significant growth in trade and tourist traffic over the past few years has forced Israel to consider reopening the consulate.

 The moves clearly signal Tel Aviv?s desire to tell the new dispensation in Delhi that it is keen to maintain the bilateral ties that it enjoyed with the BJP-led NDA government.

 The exact dates of the meetings, both in November, are being worked out. At the first ? to be held at the secretary level ? the gamut of bilateral relations will be reviewed. 

 The counter-terrorism group will allow the two sides to further deepen their cooperation in an area of common concern that also plays an important part in their foreign policy.

 Soon after the UPA came to power in May, there was speculation in some quarters that the upward graph in bilateral ties would be affected.

 The new ruling coalition?s common minimum programme laid a lot of emphasis on strengthening India?s ?traditional relations? with the Palestinian authority and the Arab world, but glossed over Delhi?s growing ties with Tel Aviv.

 Foreign minister K. Natwar Singh, however, admitted a few days ago in a public speech that relations with Israel were of ?vital importance? even as he reaffirmed Delhi?s commitment to the Palestinian cause.

 But if Singh?s remarks indicate to the Israelis that it is business as usual, the recent West Asia visit of minister of state for external affairs E. Ahmed has brought back the frown on their foreheads. 

 Ahmed not only stayed away from meeting any Israeli leader but also made it clear in interviews that India felt Tel Aviv?s hardline was responsible for the ongoing West Asia crisis. His remarks and his decision to avoid visiting Israel have not gone down well with Tel Aviv.

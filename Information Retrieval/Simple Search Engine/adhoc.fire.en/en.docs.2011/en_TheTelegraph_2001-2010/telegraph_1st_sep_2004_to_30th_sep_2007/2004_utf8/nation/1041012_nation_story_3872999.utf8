 Jai Prakash film hits DD wall

 New Delhi (PTI): Prasar Bharati on Monday 

 dropped plans to show a Rs 90-lakh movie on Jai Prakash 

 Narayan, citing ?objectionable parts? related to the Emergency.

 ?The two-hour movie was previewed by a high-level committee comprising senior officials from Prasar Bharati as well as the information and broadcasting ministry. However, it was sent back to Prakash Jha, who has made the film for the culture ministry, after certain parts were found objectionable and it looked like a one-sided view,? Prasad Bharti CEO K.S. Sarma said.

 The film was slated to be shown on Doordarshan on Narayan?s birth anniversary on Monday and Prasar Bharati?s move has not gone down well with the Opposition. NDA convener George Fernandes described the move as highly disturbing. ?It shows in which direction the country is heading.?

 Narayan had revolted against Indira Gandhi?s imposition of Emergency in 1975 and united the Opposition parties under the banner of the Janata Party to defeat her in the following election.

 Sarma said Jha was given a three-month notice to make changes. ?Twelve suggestions have been given to improve it. Some specific areas were found to be missing while some shots were found to be long. We felt that it should be more balanced before being shown by the public broadcaster,? he said. 

 Domestic violence bill 

 New Delhi (PTI): Union law minister H.R. 

 Bharadwaj has said the long-pending domestic violence act 

 will be enacted as soon as possible and said the government 

 is in the process of consulting experts on the draft bill.

 ?The bill is with the ministry and I assure you that the law will be enacted as soon as possible,? Bharadwaj said at the inaugural session of a workshop on violence against women organised here by the National Commission for Women in collaboration with the United Nations Population Fund.

 Bharadwaj said the ministry was holding consultations with legal experts and women?s groups on how to make the law effective for women of all social and economic groups. ?The law should create a mechanism under which women in any part of the country and belonging to any social or economic group can get legal recourse. It should provide for an organisation of women lawyers in every district that will come to the aid of women,? the minister said.

 Patil?s copter forced to land

 Bangalore (PTI): A helicopter carrying 

 Union home minister Shivraj Patil, who is on an election 

 campaign tour of Maharashtra, made a forced but safe landing 

 at Gulbarga in northern Karnataka on Monday as it was running 

 out of fuel, director-general of police . Borkar said.

 An ?error? in information received by the pilot on the longitude and latitude of the area was another reason for the forced landing.

 Lakshya tested

 Balasore (PTI): The pilotless target 

 aircraft, Lakshya, was successfully test-flown from 

 the intermediate test range at Chandipur, about 14 km from 

 here, on Monday.. The aircraft has been designed and developed 

 by the Aeronautic Development Establishment, Bangalore, 

 to perform aerial reconnaissance of battlefields.

 Fake IPS trainee

 IPS probationer from Chennai, was arrested when she came 

 for training at the National Police Academy here. M. Malathi, 

 26, of Krishnagiri district of Tamil Nadu was taken into 

 custody after a complaint was lodged against her for submitting 

 fake educational certificates and other documents.

 Passport arrest

 Hyderabad (PTI): Immigration officers 

 at the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport here arrested 

 four persons from Gujarat travelling with fake passports. 

 The four had obtained the passports from agents at Mumbai 

 and Nagpur and had come to the city a couple of days ago 

 en route to Canada and the United States looking for jobs.

 Hoax call 

 New Delhi (PTI): Security personnel 

 were thrown into a tizzy on Monday after police received 

 a telephone call that a bomb had been kept in the Patiala 

 House court premises. An unidentified person called up police 

 around 1.30 pm claiming that an explosive had been placed 

 near a courtroom. Bomb detection teams and dog squads were

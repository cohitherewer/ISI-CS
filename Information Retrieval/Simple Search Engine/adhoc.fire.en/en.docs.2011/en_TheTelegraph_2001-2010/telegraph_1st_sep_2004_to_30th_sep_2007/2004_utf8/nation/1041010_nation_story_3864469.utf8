Srinagar, Oct. 9: A suicide bomber rammed a 

car packed with explosives into an army convoy at Singhpora village on the strategic 

Srinagar-Uri highway this morning, killing four soldiers.

 The unidentified suicide bomber and a civilian truck driver also died in the explosion on the highway near Pattan in north Kashmir?s Baramulla district. Twenty-eight army troopers and 15 civilians were injured in the attack, the first time a suicide bomber has managed to hit an army convoy.

 Sources said the suicide bomber overtook some vehicles in the heavily-escorted convoy as it headed to Baramulla before ramming his vehicle into the bus. The blast destroyed the bus; a passing civilian truck and four other vehicles were also damaged.

 The convoy was escorted by mobile patrols ? the army usually sanitises the highway every morning before its vehicles pass, heavily escorted. Civilian vehicles are rarely allowed to enter the convoy line. Today?s attack has heightened the challenge for security forces.

 Troops blocked the highway and began an extensive search operation. Many vehicles remained stranded on the highway till late afternoon as security forces deployed more road-opening parties ? these are responsible for detecting, locating and defusing explosive devices planted on or near highways.

 ?There was a deafening sound and I fell in a roadside khud. I opened my eyes and I looked back and saw a thick cloud of black smoke billowing out near the bus,? Sanaullah, a retired government employee, said. ?I saw blood oozing out from my back, hands and my right leg. With shivering limbs I managed to reach my home nearby. My family brought me to SMHS hospital here for treatment.? 

 Hilal Ahmed, a police wireless operator had just left his Singhpora house on the way to Srinagar. ?I saw the army convoy and suddenly there was a loud explosion. I fell down and I was bleeding. A police official took me to hospital. It was a miraculous escape. Thank God.?

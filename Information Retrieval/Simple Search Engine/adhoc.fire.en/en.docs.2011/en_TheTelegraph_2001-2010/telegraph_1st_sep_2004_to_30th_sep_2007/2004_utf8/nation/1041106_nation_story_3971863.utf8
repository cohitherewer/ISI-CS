 Kerala rows push back Muslim board meet

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Nov. 5: The All-India Muslim Personal Law Board was to have cleared a model nikaahnama at its Calicut meet next month but has instead got sucked into the rows over the ice-cream parlour sex scandal and the Marad communal riots.

 On a request from major Muslim organisations in Kerala, the meet has been deferred till Haj gets over at the end of January next year. It is likely to be held in February-March outside the state.

 The Jamiat-e-Islami, Jamiat-e-Ulema, Kerala Nadwatul Mujahiddeen and other organisations had written to board chief Maulana Rabey Nadvi expressing their ?sense of outrage? over the appointment of E. Abubacker as reception committee convener of the board meet that was set to discuss reform in Muslim society.

 Abubacker belongs to the radical National Democratic Front and his name has figured in connection with the 2002 Marad riots. Worse, he has the patronage of state industries minister P.K. Kunhalikutty who is now facing charges of sexual abuse in the 1996 ice cream parlour sex racket.

 A victim?s allegations had last week sparked a series of developments, with suspected Muslim League activists attacking mediapersons in many parts of Kerala and Opposition parties demanding the minister?s resignation. Kunhalikutty rejected the charges as ?politically motivated?.

 Sources close to Nadvi said he ?shuddered? to associate the board with anyone named in a communal riot or a sex scandal. Sensing a ?needless controversy?, he called up office-bearers for an explanation and, failing to get a convincing answer, called off the meet. Nadvi is in hometown Rae Bareli in Uttar Pradesh.

 A section of the board members has accused secretary Maulana Nizamuddin for stirring a controversy by appointing Abubacker. But sources close to Nizamuddin washed their hands of the issue, saying the decision was taken when the board met in Kanpur in July.

 Insiders said the board, being an apolitical body, had a tradition of surviving on donations from rich patrons or ?well-wishers? who take care of ?logistics?. 

 It was in this context that Abubacker and Kunhalikutty figured high on the priority list.

 Some younger and progressive elements on the board have been arguing for better management of its activities and programmes. Apart from creating a corps for funds, they have been pushing for a permanent legal cell.

 Such a cell could have helped people like Best Bakery key witness Zahira Sheikh, who has been constantly changing her statements in the case and causing embarrassment to the community.

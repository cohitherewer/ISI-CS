 Seer fired from temple panel

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Jayendra Saraswati

Chennai, Nov. 24: The Jayalalithaa 

 government has removed Kanchi seer Jayendra Saraswati, 70, 

 now lodged in Vellore central jail, from the chairmanship 

 of a high-level committee dealing with temples in Tamil 

 Nadu.

 The ADMK government had nominated Jayendra Saraswati to head an ?advisory committee to regulate the renovation works and to speed up the performance of kumbabhishegam (consecration ceremonies) in temples? in 2002, when the seer?s relations with the Tamil Nadu chief minister were at their best.

 But Jayendra Saraswati?s fortunes have nosedived since his November 11 arrest over the September 2004 murder of Shankar Raman, manager of the Sri Varadaraja Perumal temple. The advisory committee he was removed from today has about 15 members, including senior religious leaders from other Hindu denominations.

 Official sources today confirmed the seer?s removal as chairperson, saying a successor is yet to be appointed. Sources in the Kanchi Kamakoti Mutt said they are yet to receive any formal notice.

 Under Jayendra Saraswati, the temple committee made several suggestions to the government, including the renovation of the famous Kapaleeshwarar temple in Mylapore here. The temple, whose ?kumbabhishegam? was performed two months ago, was the last major temple to get a facelift.

 Elsewhere, the Opposition DMK, which continued to hint at ?there being something more? to the seer?s arrest than meets the eye, today opened up a new flank. Party chief M. Karunanidhi hinted that the DMK, which is a key constituent of the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government, would take up the arrest with the Centre.

 The party chief rejected Jayalalithaa?s criticism that he had made a ?huge somersault? on the issue after having first congratulated the state government for its ?fair and impartial action? in arresting Jayendra Saraswati. Karunanidhi said here today that the post-arrest developments only ?strengthened? the DMK?s suspicions that personal motives influenced the arrest decision.

 Replying to a query, the DMK chief said: ?When the time comes, if we feel it is desirable and necessary, we will take up the issue (with the Centre).? He told the media ?it is up to you? to urge Jayalalithaa to release the seer, a chronic diabetic, in the ?larger public interest?.

 Karunanidhi said the DMK thought Jayendra Saraswati?s arrest was ?commendable? as everyone was bound by the law of the land, adding that the seer would have to be ?punished? if any wrongdoing was proved.

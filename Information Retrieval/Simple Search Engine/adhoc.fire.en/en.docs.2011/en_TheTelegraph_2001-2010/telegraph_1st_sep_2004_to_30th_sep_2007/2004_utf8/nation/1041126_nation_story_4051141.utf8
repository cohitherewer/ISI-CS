 Hurriyat seeks talks in third country

 ALOKE TIKKU

 New Delhi, Nov. 25: The Hurriyat Conference today offered to meet the Kashmiri leadership across the border in a third country after sensing the Centre?s reluctance to allow it to visit Pakistan for this.

 ?A meeting in a third country can possibly be arranged if there are any problems in our (Hurriyat) visiting Pakistan,? Hurriyat leader and People?s Conference chief Bilal Lone said.

 ?When you want to solve a problem, you have to hold the bull by its horns,? he said, emphasising the separatist conglomerate?s need to understand and appreciate the views of Kashmiris across the border.

 Home minister Shivraj Patil had earlier said it was unlikely Delhi would have any problem with Hurriyat leaders visiting Pakistan and promised to consider their request when it was made.

 But it appeared today that the Hurriyat would not have to go through the trouble to get an opportunity to interact with both the Pakistani and the Kashmiri leadership.

 An international NGO called the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs is organising the Pugwash Conference in Kathmandu in the second week of December to promote intra-Kashmir talks.

 Pugwash brings together influential scholars and public figures involved in reducing the danger of armed conflict and seeking cooperative solutions for global problems.

 The NGO was awarded the Nobel peace prize in 1995 for its efforts to diminish the role of nuclear arms in international politics and to eliminate them in the long run.

 At the three-day Kathmandu meet beginning December 12, it would try to get Kashmiri leaders ? besides others from India and Pakistan ? to have a ?freewheeling discussion? as a first step towards improving understanding, sources said.

 Hardliner Syed Ali Shah Geelani is learnt to have turned down the invitation. 

 Moderate separatist leaders, including Mirwaiz Umer Farooq and Yasin Malik, Jammu and Kashmir MLA Yusuf Tarigami and PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti are expected to make it.

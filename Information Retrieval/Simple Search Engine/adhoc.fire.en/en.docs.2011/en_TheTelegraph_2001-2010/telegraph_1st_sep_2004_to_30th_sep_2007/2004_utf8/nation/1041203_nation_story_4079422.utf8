 - Tribute to benode behari 

 Visva-Bharati, where years of neglect are gradually effacing the murals executed by Benode Behari Mukherjee in Kala Bhavana, Hindi Bhavana and China Bhavana, is celebrating the birth centenary of the painter who lost his vision at the height of his career as a teacher, artist and writer. 

 Perhaps to make amends for the damage done to his celebrated works, Kala Bhavana mounted a large exhibition of the paintings of Mukherjee, who was thrust into the public eye after Satyajit Ray made Inner Eye, a documentary on the painter who was his mentor.

 The wide range of watercolours, drawings and graphics ? mostly executed between the 1930s and the 50s ? allows viewers to get a fairly good impression of his artistry.

 The first thing that strikes viewers is how Mukherjee managed to retain his individuality in spite of being exposed to myriad influences such as that of his teacher Nandalal Bose, indigenous arts and crafts, Japanese artistic practice and most definitely the modernist movement that was still making waves in Europe. 

 Viewers are taken by surprise when confronted with two colour lithographs that one would in a flash connect with Matisse?s papiers colles.

 Yet, as Soumik Nandy Majumdar writes in his informative article in the catalogue, ?Until the 40?s Benode Behari was primarily a painter of nature.? Bolpur unfolds as a harsh, red terrain extending to the horizon dotted with the solitary date palm. 

 His deft and precise strokes bring to life knotted and gnarled tree trunks, crowns of foliage and lowering clouds. His flowers still look fresh and joyful in spite of peeling paint.

 Vigorous and spontaneous calligraphic lines ? be it watercolour, ink, lithograph or etching ? conjure up figures in motion, domestic animals, herds of boars and Santhal children. 

 He invests humble folk from the hills with a dignity of their own as they go about their backbreaking chores. One cannot help chuckling at Mukherjee?s masseur for it immediately brings to mind Bhupen Khakkar?s rendering of the same subject. 

 Breaking free from the rigidity of verisimilitude, forms are placed in such a manner that they create a harmonious balance within the same framework. 

 The simple forms draw viewers into a world of introspection embodied in the paintings of the ateliers, where the lonely artist is immersed in the act of creation. However, unless something is done soon to preserve this legacy it will soon go the way of the murals.

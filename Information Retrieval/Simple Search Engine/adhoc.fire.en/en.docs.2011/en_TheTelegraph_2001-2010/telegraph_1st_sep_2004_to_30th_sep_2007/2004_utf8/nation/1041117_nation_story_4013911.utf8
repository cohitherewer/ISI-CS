 Srinagar, Nov. 16: Despite unprecedented security arrangements on the eve of the Prime Minister?s visit to Jammu and Kashmir, militants killed at least 12 people, including two counter-insurgents, in central Budgam district.

 Police said the two counter-insurgents had come to visit their relatives on Id in Kawoosa village near Magam when heavily armed militants tried to abduct them.

 As the two men and their relatives tried to resist, the militants opened fire, killing the two and four others. The militants escaped under the cover of darkness.

 No one has claimed responsibility for the attack.

 A soldier was killed and another two were injured near Kachidoora in Pulwama district of south Kashmir when militants ambushed a patrol party of the paramilitary Central Reserve Police Force.

 Militants also gunned down two civilians at Tund in Doda district. Three more bodies were recovered from different places in the state. The attacks came a day before Manmohan Singh is scheduled to arrive here on a two-day visit.

 An overwhelming security cordon has been thrown around capital Srinagar with all entry and exit points being manned by heavily armed personnel belonging to paramilitary forces, police and the Rashtriya Rifles.

 Spiked iron barricades have been erected in the middle of the road to obstruct vehicular movement around the cricket stadium, the venue of Singh?s public meeting.

 ?We have made tight security arrangements in the entire capital city. Traffic has been diverted to other routes for security reasons,? said a police officer.

 The All Parties Hurriyat Conference has said its leaders would not meet the Prime Minister during his stay in the state as two rounds of talks have been held with the Centre. ?And now after the two rounds, we would like to visit Pakistan to talk to the leadership on the other side,? said Mirwaiz Umer Farooq, the chairman of the moderate faction of the Hurriyat.

 The Prime Minister had recently decided to reduce the number of troops in the state. ?This is being done to move the peace process with Pakistan forward as the ground situation has been showing signs of improvement in Jammu and Kashmir,? he had said. 

 Singh had, however, made it clear that if the situation deteriorated, the decision would be reviewed.

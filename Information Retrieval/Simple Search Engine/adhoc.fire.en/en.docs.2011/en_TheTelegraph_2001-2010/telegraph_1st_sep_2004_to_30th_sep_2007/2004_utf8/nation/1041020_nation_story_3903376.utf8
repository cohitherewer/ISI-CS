 Rebels trash ?vague? talks

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Hyderabad, Oct. 19: The Naxalite delegation today termed the four-day talks with the Andhra Pradesh government as ?superfluous? and lacking in sincerity. 

 Addressing a news conference before returning to their forest hideouts, People?s War state secretary Ramakrishna described the assurances given by the state government as ?vague and lacking in clarity? and said it appeared they are delaying the talks. ?We hoped the government would come up with a political solution, but were disappointed.?

 He was peeved with chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy?s recent comments about their armed struggle, calling them ?irresponsible?. He pointed out that before agreeing to the talks, they had made it clear that their armed struggle was ?non-negotiable?. 

 ?The Naxalites have to give up arms and the democratic path should be adopted which will be more meaningful,? Rajasekhar Reddy had said, while also trashing the rebels? stand against World Bank loans. 

 The first phase of the talks ended without any breakthrough. ?We will invite you in a month or two after studying how we can implement the four demands placed before us,? home minister K. Jana Reddy, who headed the government team, said. 

 Despite their apparent disenchantment, the rebels said they had no intention of staying away from the second round. But they added: ?We will come only if the government shows its sincerity in fulfilling at least one of the assurances they had given in the first talks.?

 Ramakrishna said their agenda did not necessitate any legislation. ?All our demands can be fulfilled within the framework of existing law. What is needed is a political will to take initiative in favour of the common man rather than the upper classes,? he said. 

 A hint of controversy crept into the negotiations when the Naxalites claimed that the government had signed a truce pact with them to continue the ceasefire till the conclusion of the talks. The home minister denied signing any such pact. 

 While the state made it clear it would consider all the ? demands only after a careful study, it promptly granted a day?s parole to senior People?s War activist Ganesh, who is in jail in connection with the murder of liquor baron and Congress MP M. Subbarama Reddy. 

 On a special petition from Naxalite emissaries P. Varavara Rao and Gaddar, he was released yesterday to spend a night with his comrades in the state guesthouse. The Naxalites delayed their departure for the forests till this morning.

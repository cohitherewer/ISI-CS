 Russia arms ties crack

 New Delhi/Moscow, Nov. 30: A chill threatens to set in between India and its largest supplier of military hardware, Russia, even as Russian defence minister Sergei Ivanov and Indian defence minister Pranab Mukherjee begin talks that will last through tomorrow.

 Shortly before leaving Moscow, Ivanov said Delhi?s reluctance to sign an agreement on intellectual property rights was making it difficult for Russia to continue with its large military supplies to India.

 ?In our military-technical cooperation, we have come to a stage when, without signing of the agreement on the protection of intellectual property rights, we cannot look ahead,? Ivanov said. The minister is in Delhi three days ahead of Russian President Vladimir Putin?s visit. Talks between Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Putin are scheduled for December 3.

 Indian defence sources said the talks at the official level were on projects that India had either contracted or was negotiating but refused to comment on the Russian insistence on signing an intellectual property rights agreement.

 Russian representatives at the official-level talks of the Indo-Russia Inter-Governmental Committee on Military-Technical Cooperation are understood to have conveyed their displeasure with Delhi for not having responded to an agreement on intellectual property rights and secrecy presented two years ago.

 They are particularly miffed that India has signed two secrecy agreements with the US in the last two years even though India?s military cooperation with the US is minuscule compared to Russia?s. An estimated 65 per cent of India?s military hardware is of Russian or former-USSR origin.

 India has signed the General Secrecy of Military Information Agreement with the US and also another agreement guaranteeing confidentiality in high-technology cooperation. India has also given secrecy guarantees to Israel on military cooperation.

 Despite an agreement not being signed, Moscow continued to grant access to Indian defence officials to their ports and military manufacturing facilities, it has been pointed out.

 Ivanov, a close confidant and personal friend of Putin and seen by many as his possible successor, underscored that the absence of an agreement on protection of intellectual property rights had become an ?obstacle? in the development of defence cooperation involving cutting-edge technology.

 ?It has become something of an obstacle if we think of the future. We can fulfil our previous obligations without this, but we cannot move ahead in high-technology cooperation,? Ivanov said.

 ?We will not give away such high technology without signing an IPR (intellectual property rights) agreement for free. India is a priority and a strategic partner of Russia. It was also a strategic partner of Soviet Union, which used to give many things for free, but things have changed. Russia is a different country and there is a need for taking cognisance of this reality,? Ivanov said.

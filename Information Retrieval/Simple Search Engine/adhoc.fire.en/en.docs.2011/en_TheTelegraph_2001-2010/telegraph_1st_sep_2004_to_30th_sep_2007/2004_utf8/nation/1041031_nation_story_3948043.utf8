 Cop picks holes in Godhra FIR

Ahmedabad (PTI): A senior police officer on Saturday told 

the Godhra inquiry commission that there were ?discrepancies? in the FIR and ?differences? 

among the high-ranking police officials on investigations into the massacres in 

Naroda Patiya and Gulbarg Society during the post-Godhra riots.

 ormer Bhavnagar district superintendent of police Rahul Sharma said: ?On more than one occasion, I realised that I was not being consulted in the cases.?

 Sharma had been appointed deputy commissioner of police (control) in during the riots.

 ?In the FIR, the reason for the crowd attack at Naroda Patiya, where 87 Muslims were killed, was not specified. But in the chargesheet, the reason mentioned was the errant truck driver who killed a Hindu youth,? he said.

 The police official added that he similarly disagreed with the Gulbarg Society chargesheet that said the attack came after ex-Congress MP Ehsan Jafri opened fire from his house.

 In Mumbai, a special court conducting trial in the Bilkis Bano gangrape and massacre case will frame charges against the accused on November 5.

 Special judge U.D. Salvi deferred the matter after asking the CBI to hand over all documents pertaining to the case. The court said the worth of those documents would be decided later but they would be required by the defence to contradict the statements of witnesses.

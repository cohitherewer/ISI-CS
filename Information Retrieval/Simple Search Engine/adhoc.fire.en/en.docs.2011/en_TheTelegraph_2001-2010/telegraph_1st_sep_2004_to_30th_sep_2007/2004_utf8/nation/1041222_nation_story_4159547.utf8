 HC raps police in porn case

 Jammu: A division bench of Jammu and 

 Kashmir High Court on Tuesday pulled up police for their 

 indifference to the court?s directives and asked director-general 

 of police Gopal Sharma to submit a fresh report on former 

 Miss Jammu Anara Gupta?s role in the production of pornographic 

 films.

 The court also stayed a local court?s order allowing her to visit New Delhi to file a complaint with the National Human Rights Commission and National Commission for Women. Anara had earlier sought permission to visit Delhi and tell her side of the story to the two commissions.

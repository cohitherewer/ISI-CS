 Runaway girls tie knot

 GAJINDER SINGH

 Chandigarh, Dec. 8: Their parents are hoping it?s a joke. And the police are clueless.

 In what could be the first instance of same-sex marriage in the region, two girls fled their homes in conservative Amritsar recently and then phoned their parents to tell them they should be allowed to live like couples as they had ?tied? the ?knot?.

 Both girls ? Raju, 25, and Mala, 22 ? are from Sandhu Colony and their decision to get ?married? has sent shock waves through the holy city.

 ?We were shocked when we came to know that they had fled. We were aghast when they informed us that they had got married. Is this what we call kalyug?? said Raju?s mother Ranjit Kaur.

 ?They have even told us that they will return only if we give them a sworn affidavit to allow them to live like couples. It is humiliating for us and for humanity. We only wish they are joking.?

 Ranjit said Raju and Mala were friends since childhood. 

 ?We had no idea that the two were up to other things than being just good friends. They were always seen together. We used to laugh when they used to say they would get married to each other. Now we know why Raju shunned the proposals that used to come for her. Mala?s parents, too, hold similar views,? she said.

 If the parents are horrified, the police in both Amritsar and Chandigarh are clueless on what steps to take. 

 While Chandigarh police are seeking expert opinion on the case to be registered against the two, Amritsar police have washed their hands of the matter, saying the law is not clear on same-sex marriages.

 ?We would not be able to do anything as both are adults,? said Amritsar Civil Lines DSP Ashish Kapoor, though a missing persons? case has been registered on the complaints of both families.

 A lawyer, however, said Raju and Mala?s marriage would not be legally acceptable. 

 ?The law does not recognise lesbian marriages. The Hindu Marriage Act, Indian Marriage Act and the Special Marriage Act stipulate that a marriage can only be solemnised between a male and a female,? the lawyer explained.

 Chandigarh police have alerted their Himachal Pradesh counterparts to be on the lookout for the girls. ?They could have gone to the hills for their honeymoon, in case they have really tied the knot,? a police officer said.

 Police sources in Chandigarh said investigations are on and it is possible that the girls are playing a prank. 

 ?But since the girls? parents have mentioned in the complaints that they have eloped and married, we have to seek legal opinion on the matter before making the next move in case they are arrested here,? an officer said.

 Women?s rights activist Ranjit Chadha said nobody should object to who is living with whom, but added that ?such marriages do not contribute to society in any way?.

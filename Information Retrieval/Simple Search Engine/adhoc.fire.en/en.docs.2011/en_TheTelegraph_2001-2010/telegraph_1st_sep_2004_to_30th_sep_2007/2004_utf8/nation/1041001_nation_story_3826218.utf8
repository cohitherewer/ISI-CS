 Black Cats set for role recast

 New Delhi, Sept. 30: A 

 home ministry review of security for VIPs is to examine 

 afresh if National Security Guard commandos should continue 

 to protect the notables instead of fighting terrorists.

 A senior home ministry official said the comprehensive review, ordered by home minister Shivraj Patil over a month ago, will examine the whole security gamut, including guidelines for providing protection, training and the agencies to be used for the task.

 An official said the idea is to take a ?long-term view? of existing procedures and capabilities, including training of security personnel. Patil recently said a ?comprehensive review? was on the cards but did not spell out what this entailed. ?We will speak after we have taken the decision,? the minister had said.

 Ministry officials said the review would also consider if the NSG should be moved out of VIP security to let it concentrate on its primary mandate of conducting counter-terrorism operations. But any move to replace the Black Cat commandos ? as good at protecting VIPs as they are at boosting their ego ? is unlikely to be approved in a hurry by politicians.

 The recent furore over an Intelligence Bureau letter informing Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav that his NSG cover would be withdrawn due to low threat perception is held up as an example by officials. Lucknow promptly took up the matter with the Union home ministry, which said no commando withdrawal had been ordered.

 Officials said VIP security has always been a tricky issue. During the last security review in February 2000, the ministry decided, among other things, to replace the ?VIP security? tag with ?personal security?. It also said the threat ought to be posed by terrorists and rationalised the number of VIPs, especially those covered by the NSG. 

 Ministry officials admit it is debatable if the government has followed this policy which looked good on paper.

 They said the government had in principle decided to induct the Central Industrial Security Force into VIP security duty on the recommendation of the group of ministers on internal security in June 2001. The change began with CISF commandos replacing the Black Cats deployed for Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi last year; however, the NSG commandos were brought back soon after.

 Apparently, Modi and his security managers, used to fierce NSG commandos trained to scare the wits out of their opponents, did not like their more sombre CISF counterparts looking over their shoulders and promptly had them replaced.

 CISF officials say their commandos ? dressed in safari suits with weapons concealed like Delhi Police commandos who protect the home minister ? have been trained to be polite but firm in dealing with people who come to meet a VIP. The industrial security force reckons this could be one reason why politicians have opposed the switch from the Black Cats.

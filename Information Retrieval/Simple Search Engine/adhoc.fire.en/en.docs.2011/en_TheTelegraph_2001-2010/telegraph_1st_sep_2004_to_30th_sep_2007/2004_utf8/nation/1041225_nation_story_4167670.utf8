 Tech check in schools 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Dec. 24: Schools here have started a war against gadgets and new technologies to prevent their students from going the MMS scandal way.

 Besides mobile phones, the schools have cracked the whip on the use of CDs and floppy disks too. Authorities of DAV-Chandrashekharpur have instructed students not to bring cell phones, cameras, CDS and floppy disks to school and teachers to switch off their phones while in class. 

 The curbs did not end there. The authorities have also banned students from surfing the Net while in school. ?I make calls on the teachers? phones to confirm if they have switched them off,? said K.C. Satpathy, principal of the school.

 After the Delhi smut scandal hit the headlines, institutes across the country have initiated steps to check the use of mobile phones ? especially those with camera ? on campus. 

 The Church of North India, which runs a number of English-medium schools in Calcutta, has decided to ban the use of cell phones by children on campus. On Wednesday, Anna University in Chennai banned the use of camera-enabled cell phones on its four campuses.

 Back in the Orissa capital, a student of Sainik School was recently fined Rs 1,000 for using a cell phone in school. Other premier schools like St Xavier?s and St Joseph too have cracked the phone whip. ?We don?t allow the use of any expensive item,? said a teacher of St Xavier?s School.

 With mobile handsets becoming cheaper by the day, the demand for phones with MMS and camera has increased considerably, especially among the youths. 

 Waking up to the flip side of technology after the smut scandal, parents here are concerned over the use of mobile phones by their children. ?My daughter remains glued to her phone for hours. I don?t know who is on the other side of the phone though she says speaks to friends,? said Purabi Hansdah, a concerned schoolteacher.

 Cyber crime is not alien to the city. Recently, authorities of Xavier Institute of Management, Bhubaneswar (XIMB), lodged a complaint with Chandrashekharpur police station after students, teachers and administrative staff members received a series of obscene emails from an unknown sender. 

 However, the police ? ill-equipped to fight cyber crime ? are still at a loss over the identity of the sender.

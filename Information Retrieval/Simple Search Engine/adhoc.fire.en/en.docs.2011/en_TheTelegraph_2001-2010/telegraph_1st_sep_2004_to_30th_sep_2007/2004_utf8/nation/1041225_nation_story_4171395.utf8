 DM awaits govt word

 ASHISH SINHA

 Patna, Dec. 24: The Bihar government today remained non-committal about the request for lien made by the Patna district magistrate, Gautam Goswami, who has been offered the position of senior vice-president by a corporate house. 

 While Goswami will have to be released by the department of personnel in the Union home ministry, the state government?s consent is necessary first. The chief secretary, K.A.H. Subramanyam, however, told The Telegraph that no decision had yet been taken on the DM?s request. 

 Goswami, who proceeded on a week?s leave, indicated to the media that he expected the government to take a favourable decision on his request. 

 The request is unusual because Goswami is possibly the first IAS officer in the country to have sought the government?s permission to work for a corporate body without resigning from the administrative service. If his request is granted, said several senior bureaucrats here, it would set a precedent and a large number of IAS officers would like to eat their cake and have it too by working for private business organisations or even multinationals while retaining their service with the government.

 The DM would have to resign from government service, they felt, because it is highly unlikely that the personnel department would agree to release him on his terms.

 Goswami faces the prospect of being censured by the Election Commission following his failure to prevent Rashtriya Janata Dal workers from taking over and defacing government property and buildings in the state capital in the run-up to Laloo Prasad Yadav?s rally, which was eventually called off.

 The district magistrate has been on the defensive and was hard put replying to questions by Election Commission observer K.J. Rao, who was here to report on the alleged violation of the model code of conduct by RJD workers.

 The development comes at a time when two Bihar cadre IPS officers ? Ajit Joy and Rituraj ? have sought voluntary retirement from the government. Joy, who holds a degree from Harvard Law School, wants to practise law, while Rituraj wishes to open a school in his village in the backward Nalanda district, from where he hails.

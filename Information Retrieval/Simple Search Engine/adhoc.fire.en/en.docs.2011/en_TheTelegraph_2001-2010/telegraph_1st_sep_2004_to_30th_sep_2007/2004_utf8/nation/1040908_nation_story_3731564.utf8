 Visa relief for Pak scribes

 New Delhi, Sept. 7 (PTI): India today unilaterally announced its intention to ease visa restrictions to allow Pakistani journalists to visit any part of the country.

 I announce from our side free visa for Pakistani journalists allowing them to go wherever they want to in India, foreign minister K. Natwar Singh said at a function organised by the South Asia Free Media Association (Safma).

 Observing that he was sticking his neck out, Singh said he, along with national security adviser J.. Dixit, would persuade home minister Shivraj Patil and carry it for approval to the Cabinet Committee on Security headed by the Prime Minister. 

 Singhs announcement came after Safma representatives made a strong case for free flow of information and unrestricted movement of journalists to either country. The minister agreed there should be no difficulty in Pakistani scribes coming to India and going anywhere in the country.

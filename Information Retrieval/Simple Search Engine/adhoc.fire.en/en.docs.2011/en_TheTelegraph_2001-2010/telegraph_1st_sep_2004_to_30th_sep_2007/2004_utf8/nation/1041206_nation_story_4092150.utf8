 Indian FBI plan on govt table

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 5: India may finally have an FBI-like central law enforcement agency as a proposal to this effect is said to be under the home ministry?s consideration.

 The United Progressive Alliance government appears to have decided not to junk the plan ? mooted by L.K. Advani when he was deputy Prime Minister ? for a central agency that would be empowered to investigate serious offences notified as federal crimes.

 A senior home ministry official said the proposal to set up a central agency to deal with specified offences having inter-state or nationwide ramifications was under the ministry?s consideration. But he refused to share the details as the proposal was at an initial stage and under discussion within the Centre.

 With law and order coming within the purview of state governments, the CBI is as close as India has to a specialised body like the FBI. But the CBI is barred from taking up probes unless the state and the Centre make a formal request.

 Hot pursuit not Patil?s style

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 22: The Union home minister today put down hawks in the security establishment and ruled out ?hot pursuit? as a viable option to hunt down Indian insurgent groups based in Bangladesh or elsewhere.

 Hot pursuit means a war that no one wants, Shivraj Patil told the brass of the country?s security establishment at the 17th Intelligence Bureau Endowment Lecture.

 He finished his speech in half the allotted 60 minutes but offered to spend the next hour with intelligence officers, answering their questions on his vision vis-a-vis dealing with terrorism.

 During the interaction, B.L. Vohra, a retired officer who had commanded a central police force, wondered why India could not go a few kilometres into Bangladesh to destroy terror camps when the US could chase the Al Qaida down to Afghanistan.

 Others asked Patil about the ?absence? of a clear-cut policy on terrorism, the ability of the police machinery to deal with terrorism and the Centre?s approach towards hijackers. 

 The common strain in all the questions was the suggestion that India ? be it under the UPA, the NDA or any other political formation ? was a ?soft state?.

 The National Democratic Alliance had levelled this charge against the United Progressive Alliance government, which the home minister had rebutted in Parliament.

 Patil today told an audience made up of the people tasked to fight terrorism that the UPA regime?s positions did not make India a soft state or that ?hot pursuit? could achieve what diplomacy could not. ?India is neither a soft state nor does it believe in war-mongering.?

 Patil held up the mirror to them and asked if India had the right to blame others for letting terror camps function when security agencies had not been able to ensure there was none in the country.

 ?Going for hot pursuit means we should be prepared for everything... we will have to be prepared for war,? he said, explaining it was acceptable only under extraordinary situations.

 ?Our efforts are on to make it clear to officials and politicians in Dhaka that providing safe haven to militant groups can endanger their own national security sometime,? Patil said. Bangladesh, he added, would hopefully understand the flip side of giving terrorists a free hand.

 He emphasised that efforts should be made to remove social imbalances in the country as it was a major factor responsible for the youth turning to guns.

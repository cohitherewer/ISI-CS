 Cong cautious over Nitish

 KAY BENEDICT

 New Delhi, Oct. 29: The Congress and the Lok Janshakti Party are cautious in their approach to the Janata Dal (United) despite yesterday?s hints that it might explore the option of dumping the BJP and joining an anti-Laloo Prasad Yadav front in Bihar.

 LJP and Congress sources suspect that Dal (U) leader Nitish Kumar?s strong objection to BJP chief .K. Advani?s advocacy of the Hindutva line could be a ploy to stop the party from projecting Shatrughan Sinha as chief minister of Bihar, where polls are due in February.

 The perceived threat could also press the BJP to concede more seats to the Dal (U).

 Kumar had said at Pawapuri in Bihar that ?we outright reject the BJP?s assertion to invoke Hindutva plank. We will not compromise on our ideology?. He added that his party would release a separate manifesto for the Bihar polls.

 But today in Ranchi, Dal (U) chief George Fernandes said his party would stay committed to its principles without interfering with the BJP?s temple agenda.

 The Congress and the LJP see ambivalence in the stand.

 nKumar had last week welcomed Advani?s appointment as BJP chief and asserted their alliance was ?firmly in place and we want to further strengthen the partnership?

 nFernandes protege Digvijay Singh today sought to downplay the BJP?s ?return to Hindutva politics?, saying in Ranchi the media had misinterpreted Advani?s statement

 ?Is he (Digvijay) a BJP spokesperson? Even Advani did not contradict media reports on his address at the BJP national council meeting,? an LJP leader said.

 Nitish may be testing the waters as winning the Bihar polls with the BJP is an uphill task, a Congress leader said. But Fernandes will not go to the Congress and the Congress will not accept him, he said.

 LJP general secretary R.G. James asked: ?Who is their leader? Two leaders (Kumar and Fernandes) are talking in different voices. First, let them come out of the saffron camp and spell out the issues.?

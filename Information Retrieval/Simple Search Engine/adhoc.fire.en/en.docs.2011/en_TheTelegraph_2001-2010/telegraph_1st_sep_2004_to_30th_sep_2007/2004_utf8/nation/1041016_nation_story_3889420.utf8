 Mainpuri poll

 New Delhi, Oct. 15 (PTI): The Election Commission has ordered a stop to the Mainpuri bypoll counting, about to begin tomorrow, in the wake of ?various complaints of large-scale rigging and intimidation?, poll panel sources said.

 Congress spokesman Abhishek Singhvi said his party had approached the poll panel demanding ?immediate strong action? in Mainpuri due to ?large-scale booth capturing?.

 The bypoll was called following the resignation of the seat by Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav. 

 The sources said the poll panel has also decided to send a four-member team there tomorrow. The team would meet political parties and candidates on Sunday.

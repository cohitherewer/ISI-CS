 Goodwill ship in ?smoking? scare

 Tokyo (AFP): An Indian military vessel surprised Japan on Friday as it arrived for a goodwill visit billowing columns of white smoke in Tokyo Bay, alarming firefighters who rushed by boat to the scene.

 However, the 3,950-ton Indian Navy destroyer Ranvijay was only using its engines, said a spokesman for the Japan Coast Guard.

 ?Apparently, the ship does that all the time. But for a moment we thought the ship was possibly experiencing a major fire. People called the fire department,? the spokesman said.

 Major media, including the Japan Broadcasting Corporation and Kyodo Newswire Service, despatched helicopters to cover the incident unfolding by the Tokyo skyline.

 No one was injured and no oil leak has been detected, the coast guard spokesman said.

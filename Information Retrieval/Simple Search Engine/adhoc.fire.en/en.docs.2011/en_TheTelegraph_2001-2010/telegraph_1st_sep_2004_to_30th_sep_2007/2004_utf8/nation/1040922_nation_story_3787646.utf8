 BJP catch for Cong in Lucknow

 New Delhi, Sept. 21: Yet to recover from its disastrous showing in the Lok Sabha elections in Uttar Pradesh, the BJP today suffered another setback with two prominent leaders switching to the Congress.

 For Balram Singh Yadav, a former Union minister in the P.V. Narasimha Rao government, it was a homecoming as he returned to the Congress after almost six years. The AICC general secretary in charge of Uttar Pradesh affairs, Satyavrat Charturvedi, formally announced his re-admission at the party headquarters this evening. 

 The other catch for the Congress was Prabhu Dayal Kateria, a three-time BJP MP from Firozabad.

 The Dalit leader said he had decided to switch parties because he was disenchanted with the BJP. 

 Ridiculing the BJP claim that it represented Hindus, he said: ?It can represent neither Ram nor Rahim.?

 Yadav had quit the Samajwadi Party and joined the BJP on the eve of the Lok Sabha elections in May. He unsuccessfully challenged Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav from the Mainpuri seat.

 Claiming he had always belonged to the Congress, Yadav said he did not leave the party on his own but was forced to quit by the leadership in 1998.

 The induction of the two leaders, apart from three others, is part of Chaturvedi?s efforts to rebuild the state Congress from the grassroots level. 

 The Congress will go it alone in next month?s by-elections, including Mainpuri vacated by Mulayam Singh and a dozen Assembly seats.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Party at home, singers abroad

 BASANT RAWAT

 Ahmedabad, Oct. 10: Narendra Modi?s party stands the danger of turning into a damp squib. 

 Invitations have been sent out to the Gujarati diaspora for the Navratri festival his government organises as part of its ?Vibrant Gujarat? campaign, but most of the leading traditional Garba singers are heading out for performances in the UK or the US. 

 The government will hold the Navratri spectacle from October 14 to 22 and labels it the world?s longest dance festival. 

 The singers say they are not lured by big money. They find the non-resident Gujaratis much ?closer to roots? and ?more appreciative of traditional Garba? than the residents of Gujarat. 

 Vipul Trivedi, a well-known Ahmedabad-based performer who is leaving for Los Angeles on October 13, says ?the excitement among the NRGs is inspiring. They love traditional songs and do all the traditional steps, unlike youngsters here who are more encouraged by Disco Dandia?. 

 Apart from Trivedi, the other big names heading West are Praful Dave, Hemant Chauhan, Piyus Kahar and Vatsala Patil. 

 Chauhan chose to perform in London as he is put off by the decibel deadline here. In the good old days, he recalled, people danced to his music till dawn. Now before one could get them going, the police turn the speakers off, he cribbed. 

 But all is not lost for Modi. A few traditional singers like Shyamal Saumil have decided not to go out. 

 ?It is not that we have not got offers. We do get offers to perform in the US and the UK, but we chose to stay because we still believe that people like to dance to traditional tunes and numbers,? he said. 

 The theme for this year?s Vibrant Gujarat gala is tourism ? medical tourism, spiritual tourism, eco tourism and adventure tourism. 

 Modi claimed that his state has tremendous potential to occupy an important place in the world tourism map. 

 ?What we need to do is popularise the state?s cultural and creative strength and market aggressively this longest dance festival of the world,? he said.

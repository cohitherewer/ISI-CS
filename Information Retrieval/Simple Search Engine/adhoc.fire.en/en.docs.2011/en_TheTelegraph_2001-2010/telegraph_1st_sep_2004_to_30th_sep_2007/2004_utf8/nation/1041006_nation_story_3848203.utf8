 Mirage mishap in Mauritius

New Delhi: A Mirage 2000 fighter aircraft that was part of 

a showpiece contingent of the Indian Air Force skidded off the runway while landing 

at Port Louis in Mauritius, reports our special correspondent.

 The pilot was unhurt, IAF sources said.

 The fighter aircraft was among six Mirage 2000s that had stopped over in Port Louis en route from multinational exercises in South Africa.

 IAF sources quoted an eyewitness as saying that the undercarriage of the aircraft was not lowered fully as it approached touchdown. The sources said the aircraft had been recovered and would be airworthy again.

 IAF officers who would be in a mandatory court of inquiry into the incident are on their way to Mauritius.

 There was prima facie evidence that the mishap was because of a mistake by the pilot.

 Two weeks ago, a Mirage 2000 crashed near its homebase in Gwalior after its undercarriage had come off during take-off. The pilot ejected after flying the aircraft over uninhabited territory and jettisoning its fuel.

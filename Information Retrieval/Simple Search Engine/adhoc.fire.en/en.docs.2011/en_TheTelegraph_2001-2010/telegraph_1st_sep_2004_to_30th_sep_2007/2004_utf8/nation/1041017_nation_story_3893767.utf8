 Mumbai votes for Shanghai

 New Delhi, Oct. 16: Shanghai was used as a metaphor to project Mumbai?s future ? would it remain cosmopolitan or regress into an ethnic ghetto. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh began the debate on the eve of the Maharashtra polls, telling reporters on October 6 that he would like to see Mumbai transformed into a Shanghai. 

 Four days later when Shiv Sena patriarch Bal Thackeray appeared in a public meeting in Mumbai, he used Singh?s declaration of intent to whip up fears of how Mumbai may be truncated from Maharashtra if it were to become a Shanghai. 

 ?You can do that. But do not push us out. We will never go, we will never allow Mumbai to be independent of Maharashtra,? thundered Thackeray before a largely Marathi-speaking crowd. 

 The Sena?s ?Maharashtra for Maharashtrians? catchline went for a toss if the verdict in Mumbai and Konkan is taken as a barometer. Apparently, few are affected by the bogey of how outsiders would swamp the city even more densely if it went the Shanghai way.

 Today, as the Congress picked up five more seats in Mumbai over its 1999 tally and the Sena-BJP combine slid by the same number, an emboldened Singh promptly convened a meeting on his ?Shanghai dream?. He chaired a two-hour meeting with senior officials of the PMO, the urban development ministry and the Planning Commission to discuss details of the proposed national mission on urban renewal. 

 According to an official release, the mission would focus on slum development, facilities for the urban poor, construction of roads and footpaths and development of urban facilities, including sanitation. 

 The Sena?s parochial outlook that worked wonders for nearly four decades as Thackeray identified one enemy after the other ?the Gujaratis, the south Indians, Muslims, and finally migrants from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar ? is failing because the Sena failed to notice how Mumbai?s demographic composition had undergone a change. 

 The ?Uttar Bharatis? ? Sena lingo for the heartland migrants ? now make up over 20 per cent of the electorate. They are mostly self-employed and, therefore, the Sena?s attempts to whip up paranoia over the migrants eating into the job pie did not click. In the era of privatisation, epitomised by the character of Mumbai, younger voters were left cold by the Sena?s campaign of jobs and education for ?sons of the soil?. 

 This was echoed in faraway Konkan, whose economy is based on remittances from Mumbai in the absence of major industries. Despite the government sector being the largest employer, the Sena?s endeavour to project the ?rasping? south Indians as enemy number one failed because the new generation of voters saw multi-ethnicity and inter-state migration as present-day realities. 

 Mumbaikars were also haunted by memories of the five-year ?misrule? of the BJP-Sena. 

 While few, if none, rated the performance of the Congress-NCP government as high, they felt it did not harm them directly, the way the Sena did with its alleged policy of extortions. 

 ?It was petty corruption at its worst. Even if someone purchased a car or a washing-machine, the local Sena workers would come to know and demand a payment on the ground that if the purchaser had money to throw on such goods, the Sena was entitled to a cut,? a voter alleged. 

 Lastly, the feud in the Thackeray family over Bal Thackeray?s political legacy between his son Uddhav and nephew Raj took away from the Tiger?s roar and shine.

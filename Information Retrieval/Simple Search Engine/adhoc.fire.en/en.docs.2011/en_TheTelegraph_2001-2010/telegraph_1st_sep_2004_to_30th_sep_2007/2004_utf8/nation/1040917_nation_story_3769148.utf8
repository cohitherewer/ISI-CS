 Sikhs go back to schools in France

 New Delhi (PTI): All but three Sikh students 

 in France have returned to their schools after the government 

 addressed their reservations on the ban on religious headgear 

 in educational institutions. 

 ?Specific solutions were discussed and agreed upon with a few students in accordance with the law as well as the children?s requests. Solutions were found for almost all the Sikh children,? French ambassador to India Dominique Girard said in a letter to the chairman of the National Commission of Minorities, Tarlochan Singh. 

 The vast majority of Sikh students had returned to their institutes at the beginning of the academic year without any difficulty, the ambassador said. 

 Only three cases are pending and the authorities are talking to them to find a solution, Girard said. ?Whatever form the outcome of this dialogue may take, you can be assured that those students will be offered solutions to continue their studies within the French education system, which offers a lot of different options,? he said.

 The commission chairman had taken up the misgivings of the Sikh community in India regarding the ban with top French officials, including foreign minister Dominique de Villepin during his recent visit.

 A legislation recently banned religious headgear in schools to integrate different communities, particularly Muslims, into French society. Five Sikh boys were refused entry to state schools on September 7.

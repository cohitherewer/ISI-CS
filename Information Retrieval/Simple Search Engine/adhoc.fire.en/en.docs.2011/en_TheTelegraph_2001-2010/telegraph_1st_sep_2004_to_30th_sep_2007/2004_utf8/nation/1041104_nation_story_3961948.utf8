 Atal allays Ayodhya fears

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 3: The National Democratic Alliance is likely to meet early next week to discuss the BJP?s attempt to revive its Hindutva agenda.

 NDA convener George Fernandes met alliance chairperson Atal Bihari Vajpayee today to seek a ?clarification? on what BJP chief .K. Advani meant when he spoke of his party?s commitment to build the Ram temple in Ayodhya at its national council last week.

 Sources close to Fernandes said the Janata Dal (United) chief was told the issue was not projected the ?way? the media sought to and that Advani had not said anything new. Hence, there was ?no reason? for the BJP?s ?secular? allies to be alarmed.

 Fernandes was also assured by Vajpayee that there was ?no way? Ayodhya would be incorporated into the NDA agenda. He later said the question of his party snapping ties with the BJP did not arise.

 But the Dal (U) sources said they would see what Advani says ? or does not ? at the RSS national executive, scheduled to meet in Hardwar on Saturday and Sunday. They said if the convention passed a strong resolution on Ayodhya or Kashi and Mathura, the NDA would be ?forced? to discuss it in its meeting.

 Earlier, Advani was supposed to speak to Fernandes after the Dal (U) national executive in Ranchi last month passed a resolution saying ?we shall have to take another road? if the BJP tried to revive Ayodhya, Article 370 or the demand for a common civil code. 

 But the Dal (U) sources maintained it was ?more practical? to deal with Vajpayee on Hindutva because of their belief that an assurance from him sounded more ?credible? than any other BJP leader.

 The Sangh?s executive has become important to assess how far it goes on Hindutva and whether it would be to the point of jeopardising the BJP?s equation with its allies. But Sangh sources said the temple was not on their agenda and nor was it likely to figure on the omnibus resolution the executive would adopt.

 But the presence of the VHP trio of Ashok Singhal, Praveen Togadia and Acharya Giriraj Kishore has added an element of ?unpredictability?, sources said. They fear even if the VHP leaders do not speak on Ayodhya at the meet, the three could end up giving sound bites to journalists outside and send a ?wrong? signal.

 The VHP today kept up its attack on Advani. If a person did not have the ?strength to do anything? for the temple?s construction in the six years he was in power, ?what will he do now after losing power?? Kishore asked. 

 Asserting that the temple was only a ?means? for the BJP to ?grab power?, he described Vajpayee and Advani as ?two sides of the same coin?. ?The Vajpayee government went some steps ahead of the previous governments and converted (the) undisputed land (in Ayodhya) into disputed territory,? Kishore said.

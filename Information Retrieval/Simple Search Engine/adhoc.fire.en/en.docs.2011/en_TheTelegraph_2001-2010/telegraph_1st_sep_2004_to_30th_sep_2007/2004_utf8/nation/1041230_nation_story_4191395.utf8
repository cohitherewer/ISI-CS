 Delhi uses Bengal law against Left

 R. VENKATARAMAN

 New Delhi, Dec. 29: Born in Bengal, enforced in Delhi.

 The Congress government in the capital today invoked a law enacted by Bengal to issue an arrest warrant against Annie Raja, wife of CPI national secretary D. Raja, for ?defacing? public property during a protest on Parliament Street.

 Delhi police said the warrant, issued under the West Bengal Prevention of Defacement of Public Properties Act, 1976, would be executed by tomorrow morning. They pointed out that an act of a state could be implemented in another if the executing state government had invoked the law through a gazette notification.

 G.L. Mehta, additional commissioner of police of the Parliament Street area, said the Delhi government had issued a gazette notification invoking the law and, therefore, it was applicable in the National Capital Region.

 Annie, secretary of the National Federation of Indian Women, led the December 21 protest to press for an employment guarantee law. ?If arrest is the result or threat by a government to a person for demanding enactment of a social welfare legislation, then let them arrest me; but I will certainly expose this government?s anti-people policies,? she said.

 ?Sub-inspector Pratap Singh visited the NFIW office in the Connaught Place area of New Delhi district and said he would execute the warrant. I told him ?please do so? but, for reasons best known to them, they have not executed the warrant today,? she added.

 Singh said a case has been registered against Annie for ?defacing? public property. The demonstrators had put up banners on trees and though Annie said they were removed immediately after the procession, the police maintained that under the law, tying banners on trees also amounted to ?defacing of public properties?.

 Hundreds of workers and leaders, including veteran socialist Surendra Mohan, activists Swami Agnivesh and Aruna Roy and columnist Kuldip Nayar, participated in the procession, Annie said, adding that ?singling out a person is really intriguing?. She claimed that proper permission had been obtained from the police for the procession and every rule was followed.

 Srinagar, Oct. 21: Dismissing the Irish formula to resolve the Kashmir conflict, the visiting British chief of general staff, General Sir Mike Jackson, said it is a bilateral issue between India and Pakistan.

 ?We need to be careful in assuming that the situation in one part of the world has a mirror image in another. But you can see parallels sometimes and I do see some here, the problems that UK had in Northern Ireland,? Gen. Jackson told a news conference at the heavily-guarded headquarters of 15 Corps.

 Jackson, who arrived here yesterday on a two-day visit, pointed out the principles of a campaign like Kashmir. ?It is very well understood by my Indian colleagues that such a situation is not just a matter of military operations, there must be political progress, economic progress, social development, and these things are also part of a campaign such as this.?

 On India?s concern over cross-border terrorism, the British chief said: ?I am aware of concerns which India has. But Britain?s position is very clear that Kashmir is a bilateral issue between the two countries. Britain would like to see a peaceful settlement in due course. But I reiterate that we see it as an entirely bilateral matter for the two countries concerned.?

 He said there has been an overall improvement in the situation in the Valley. ?What I learnt from what I have been briefed on is that the security situation is improving. The statistics show the human rights aspect is also improving.?

 Gen. Jackson ruled out deployment of additional British soldiers in Iraq, but said there might be ?re-deployment of certain British troops within Iraq?. He said ?that question is still unresolved but I expect a decision soon?.

 Ex-minister shot

 Unidentified militants killed a senior leader of the Opposition National Conference and former minister Safdar Ali Beg at Sarnal in Anantnag district of south Kashmir this afternoon. Police said 59-year-old Beg had just stepped out of his house when the militants fired on him and his guard, killing the leader on the spot and injuring the guard.

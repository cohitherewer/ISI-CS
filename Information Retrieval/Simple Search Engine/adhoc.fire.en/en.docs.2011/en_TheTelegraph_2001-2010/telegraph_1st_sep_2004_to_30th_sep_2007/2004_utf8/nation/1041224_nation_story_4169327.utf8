 Court sets ESPN date after series

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Dec. 23: Sports channel ESPN today moved the Supreme Court through a special leave petition challenging the Kerala High Court order directing it to share live feed of the India-Bangladesh one-day series with Doordarshan. 

 The apex court posted the matter for hearing in the first week of January, which means Doordarshan would telecast the remaining two matches of the series to be played in Dhaka on December 26 and 27. 

 ESPN has sought a stay on the high court order on the ground that it violates its exclusive commercial rights to telecast all cricket matches played in Bangladesh. 

 The channel contended it has been granted the rights for five years by the Bangladeshi cricket board for about Rs 50 crore and giving live feed to any other channel would infringe on the right.

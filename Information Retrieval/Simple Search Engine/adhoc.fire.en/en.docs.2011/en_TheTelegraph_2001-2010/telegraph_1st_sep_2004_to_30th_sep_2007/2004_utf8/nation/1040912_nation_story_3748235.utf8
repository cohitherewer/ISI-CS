 Play underdog, romp home

 New Delhi, Sept. 11: The Congress has drawn a lesson from its low-cost aam aadmi campaign for the general elections: the underdog tag helps in the battle of the ballot.

 As it prepares for the Assembly polls in Maharashtra ? the first electoral battle since the Lok Sabha win ? the party leadership is consciously choosing to run a low-profile aam aadmi-centric campaign. 

 Unlike the high-voltage canvassing for the December Assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh that flopped, there will not be much song and drama.

 ?Though the Maharashtra election is important, we would prefer to underplay it,? said a senior leader associated with the Lok Sabha campaign strategy. Contrary to indications from senior functionaries till a few weeks ago, it is unlikely that Sonia Gandhi will go on a rigorous campaign in the state. ?Nothing has been fixed regarding her campaign schedule,? a general secretary said.

 Party strategists also feel that a high-profile campaign could prove counter-productive because the leadership believes that the Congress-led government in the state has not lived up to popular expectations. There is also a strong view that the party?s state unit lacks an effective pan-Maharashtra leader in its ranks after Sharad Pawar?s exit five years ago. Pawar is now an ally.

 It would, therefore, be prudent to approach the elections with an underdog tag and avoid making victory assertions. Instead, the focus is on running a low-profile but effective campaign built around the perceived strengths of the party: Sonia?s image, the formidable Democratic Front alliance and the morale-boosting Lok Sabha victory.

 The focus at the moment is on efforts to maximise the unity of the alliance, which includes the Congress, Pawar?s Nationalist Congress Party, the three Republican Party of India groups, the Peasant and Workers Party and the Janata Dal (S). On paper, the alliance is formidable and much stronger than the Shiv Sena-BJP combine. But that did not get reflected in the Lok Sabha election results, where the saffron combine won 25 seats, leaving 23 for the front.

 To maximise unity, the Congress has opted for a joint election manifesto with the NCP and has also proposed joint campaigning. Within the party, Sonia has sought to bring together faction leaders of the state unit by holding separate meetings with them in recent weeks. The last was with Ranjit Deshmukh, who has been making discordant noises after his removal as state Congress president.

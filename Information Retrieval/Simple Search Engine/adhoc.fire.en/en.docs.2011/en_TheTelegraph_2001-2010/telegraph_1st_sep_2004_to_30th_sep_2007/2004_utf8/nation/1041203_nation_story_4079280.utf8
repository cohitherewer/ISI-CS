The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 PC Bengali in Feb. 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 2: Bengali has come alive on the desktop. All operations on the computer can now be performed in the language, it was announced today at a gathering of the infotech industry.

 ?We are launching the beta or test version of Enterprise Linux 4 that will support Bengali. The commercial version will be launched in February,? said Javed Tapia, director of Red Hat India, a joint venture of Red Hat Inc of the US that is an open-source and Linux provider. 

 The Bengali desktop will allow the user to do everything that can be done with the English version. All menus (like file, save and view) and error messages will appear in Bengali, as will the keyboard. 

 Red Hat tools will also establish links to peripherals like printers and modems. The installation guide is also in Bengali. 

 Asked whether the Linux version can be installed in a computer that runs on Windows, Tapia said the two can coexist in the same system. 

 Linux is an open source platform that makes the source code or core of a software available for modifications and application development, unlike proprietary platforms like Microsoft where only the end product is accessible to the user. 

 Microsoft was to offer a preview of the Bengali interface of Windows tomorrow at the same conference and exhibition, Infocom 2004, organised by Nasscom and Businessworld, an ABP group publication. But the plan has been rescheduled. 

 ?The launch will take place in another three to four months,? said a spokesperson for Microsoft, which signed an agreement with the state government to roll out its project, Shiksha, last month.

 State IT minister Manab Mukherjee said: ?The use of Linux in Bengali will help us take IT to citizens across the state. We expect Linux to reduce the overall costs and boost our e-governance initiatives and education programmes.?

 In association with IBM, the state government plans to introduce IT education in 12,500 schools, many of which offer education in Bengali. IBM is one of the more vocal users of Linux.

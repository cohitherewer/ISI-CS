 PF relief for jobless

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 1: The 

 Centre has offered some relief for workers who have either 

 quit their jobs or lost them in the current fiscal. 

 Over 10 lakh workers will now receive 8.5 per cent interest on provident fund. But this will not apply to workers continuing in their jobs.

 The central board of provident fund trustees is yet to decide a final interest rate for all provident fund subscribers. The last account credited with interest was till March 31.

 A bitter wrangle between the Centre and the Left parties and trade unions has held up a final decision on the interest rate. The government wants to slash the interest rate from 9.5 per cent to 8 per cent while trade unions and the Left want the higher rate to continue.

 But the labour ministry has decided to make a concession for exiting workers. It has issued a notification to the provident fund organisation asking them to pay 8.5 per cent interest to workers who quit the fund this year.

 Welcoming the decision, the Citu?s W.R. Wardharajan said: ?We have been demanding this. There are 1.25 lakh workers who go out of the provident fund organisation every year. Ninety per cent of them are not entitled to pension since they lose their jobs before retirement.?

 But Wardharajan made it clear that this did not spell an end to the wrangle over provident fund interest rate. The finance ministry is not inclined to concede the trade unions? demand for continuing with 9.5 per cent interest.

 Left leaders say Union finance minister P. Chidambaram had at one United Progressive Alliance-Left co-ordination committee meeting assured them he would have interest rate at 8.5 per cent. Left to itself, the finance ministry wanted 8 per cent interest.

 The Centre argues the rate of returns from the special deposit scheme where the bulk of PF money is kept is too low to finance a 9.5 per cent rate of interest.

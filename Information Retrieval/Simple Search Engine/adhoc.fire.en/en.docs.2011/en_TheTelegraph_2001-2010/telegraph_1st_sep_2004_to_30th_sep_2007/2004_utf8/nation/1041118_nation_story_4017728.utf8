 YSR takes another court blow

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, Nov. 17: Andhra Pradesh High Court today stopped work on the Rs 570-crore Pulichintala project that aims to bring an additional 10.42 lakh acres into cultivation around the Krishna delta.

 This is the fourth judicial setback for the Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy government since it assumed power last May.

 A two-member high court bench of Chief Justice Devender Gupta and Justice C.V. Ramulu said the government should not start work on such big projects without appropriate environmental clearance. The project involved building a barrage on the Krishna river at Nalgonda district?s Pulichintala village.

 Naxalite rebels have also opposed the project and demolished a foundation stone laid by Reddy last month. Even Congress members who favour a separate Telengana state are also not in favour of the project as Krishna water would be siphoned to coastal Andhra from the quota meant for the Telengana region.

 Today?s high court interim order came on a public interest litigation filed by Telengana Rashtra Samiti leader G. Venkat Reddy and journalist P. Yadagiri.

 The Reddy regime received its first judicial setback two months ago when the high court struck down its order providing 5 per cent reservation to Muslims in jobs and educational institutions. The government was instead asked to set up a backward class commission in three months to identify eligible sections among minorities for reservations.

 The next setback was over the decision to wind up the present Andhra wakf board. The court held that the Reddy government had no jurisdiction over the wakf boards, which are governed by the Central Wakf Board.

 Another disappointment was the Supreme Court?s recent decision to set aside legislation on the categorisation of Dalits in Andhra. 

 The latest court verdict affects the Reddy regime?s irrigation initiatives. A senior bureaucrat said the Pulichintala setback would endanger the government?s resource mobilisation exercise since it had allotted Rs 46,000 crore for 26 pending irrigation projects.

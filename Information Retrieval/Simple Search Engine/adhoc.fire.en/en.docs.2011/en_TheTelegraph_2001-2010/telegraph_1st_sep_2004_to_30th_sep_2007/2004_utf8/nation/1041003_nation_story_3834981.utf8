 China sends peace envoy

 PRANAY SHARMA

 New Delhi, Oct. 2: A visit to India by China?s Prime Minister Wen Jia Bao seems unlikely this year, but Beijing has decided to send a senior emissary to keep the pace of engagement with Delhi going.

 Tang Jia Xuan?s visit to Delhi, not yet announced formally, is likely to take place from October 20. He is a state councillor of the rank of vice-premier to whom, in the Beijing pecking order, foreign minister Li Zhao Xing reports on important foreign policy issues.

 Tang is expected to meet senior Indian leaders, including Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, foreign minister K. Natwar Singh and national security advisor J.. Dixit. He may also meet Sonia Gandhi, the Congress chief and ruling alliance chairperson.

 One reason why the prime ministerial visit seems unlikely is the lack of ?substantial agreements? that the two sides could sign if Wen were to come.

 Though not expressed in so many words, one of the pacts China would like to have on the table, ready to seal, is that on resolving the boundary dispute. Both sides have agreed that the ?decades-old? dispute should not drag on to the next generation. There is consensus in Delhi and Beijing that an early resolution would benefit both and significantly contribute to strengthening ties.

 Since the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance came to power in May, the two sides have had one meeting between ?special representatives? Dai Bing Guo and Dixit. Before that, Dai had had two rounds of discussions with Dixit?s predecessor, Brajesh Mishra, when the National Democratic Alliance was in power.

 It is not clear whether the change of regime in Delhi has contributed to slowing down the negotiations on the boundary dispute, but indications are the two sides may have to hold a few more rounds of discussions before any agreement is reached.

 The other reason for Wen not visiting India could be that China, like many other countries, is not sure how long the Congress-led coalition would remain in power.

 Atal Bihari Vajpayee had gone to China last year -- in a Prime Ministerial visit from India to Beijing after 10 years but which had a lot of substance and a clear signal from Delhi to forge strong bilateral ties.

 China may not be in favour of a visit by its Prime Minister at this juncture, but it does not want to give the impression that the pace of bilateral ties has started slackening under the UPA government in Delhi. Hence, Beijing has decided to send Tang.

 Indications are that another state councillor, Chen Zhi Li, who is in charge of science and technology, would visit India within days of Tang?s trip.

 Sources said that contrary to speculations in some quarters that China might not be as comfortable in dealing with the Congress-led coalition as it was with the BJP-led NDA, Beijing is at ease with a regime whose leading partner is the late Rajiv Gandhi?s party.

 It was Rajiv?s visit to Beijing in 1988 that started the major thawing of relations. Since his widow, Sonia, is the Congress chief and UPA chairperson, the Chinese leadership feels confident that the upswing in bilateral ties would continue.

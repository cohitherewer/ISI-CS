 Illegal turns legal in master plot

 AYSWARIA VENUGOPAL

 New Delhi, Oct. 28: The Delhi government took a U-turn on relocation of industries even as its industries minister was awarded for undertaking the clean-up.

 The administration, in consultation with the Centre, yesterday decided in principle to regularise as ?industrial? those residential areas that have over 70 per cent concentration of industries.

 The decision followed a meeting between Union urban development minister Ghulam Nabi Azad, Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit and Lieutenant Governor B.. Joshi.

 Around the same time, Del-hi industries minister Mangat Ram Singhal was being awarded by the Mumbai-based Indiatech Family Foundation.

 Today, former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee made public his appeal to his successor, Manmohan Singh, to intervene in the Delhi government?s campaign against the industries.

 ?These tiny units employ about 15 lakh persons. More than a lakh small entrepreneurs will lose their livelihood if the Delhi administration continues with its tyranny under the excuse of the orders of the Supreme Court,? Vajpayee said in a letter written on October 23 and released to the media today.

 The decision will effectively mean that industries that came up illegally in areas designated residential in the Master Plan of Delhi, 1981-2001, will not be shifted out; instead, residents will have to move out.

 ?Redevelopment of clusters with more than 70 per cent concentration of industries will be undertaken. For this, an enabling clause will be made in the existing Master Plan, which has been extended till the new one is prepared,? Dikshit said yesterday.

 The big step backward was prompted by attempts to mend Delhi Congress fissures and the return of BJP leader Madan Lal Khurana, who decided to quit the Rajasthan governorship in favour of taking up the cause of the affected industries. His resignation was accepted today.

 All eyes are now on the Supreme Court to see if it will take an adverse view of the ?in principle? decision that Dikshit said would be conveyed to the court. It had in August 2000 ordered the closure of industries in non-conforming areas.

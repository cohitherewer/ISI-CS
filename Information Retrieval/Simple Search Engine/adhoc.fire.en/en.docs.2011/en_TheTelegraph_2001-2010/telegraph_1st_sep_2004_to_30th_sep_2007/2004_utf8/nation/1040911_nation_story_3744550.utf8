 Jaya bans PWG

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Chennai, Sept. 10: The Jayalalithaa government in Tamil Nadu today banned the Communist Party of India Marxist-Leninist, better known as the People?s War Group, and its front organisations.

 The extreme Left outfit was outlawed under the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1908, amid reports that the Centre has decided to repeal the Prevention of Terrorism Act. 

 The Centre branded the PWG and its front groups terrorist under the anti-terrorism act from December 5, 2001, but with the law now set for repeal, the ADMK government, which was in favour of the law, decided to ban it under the older law. 

 The new Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy-led Congress government in Andhra Pradesh, where the PWG was born more than 20 years ago under the leadership of the late Kondapalli Seetharamiah, announced on July 21 that the ban on the outfit and six of its frontal organisations would be allowed to lapse. The decision paved the way for a three-month ceasefire by the PWG and the Andhra government and set the stage for peace talks in the state. 

 The Jayalalithaa government then reviewed the situation vis-?-vis the PWG. Several members of the outfit and its frontal organisations are facing criminal cases for ?possession of arms and ammunition, extortion, abduction? and bomb blasts? in Tamil Nadu. 

 ?It has been assessed that there is every likelihood that the cadre and sympathisers of the CPI-ML (PW) will attempt to infiltrate into Tamil Nadu to indulge in acts prejudicial to public peace and slip back to Andhra Pradesh,? the government said in its statement.

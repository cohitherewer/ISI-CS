 Tricolour ?missing? from Uma yatra

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Bhopal, Sept. 18: It was supposed to be the tiranga yatra but the Tricolour was all but missing from Uma Bharti?s rally here today.

 Uma, conscious of recent Supreme Court guidelines on the flag code, prevailed on BJP supporters here not to display the Tricolour. There were just a few BJP workers holding onto the national flag, careful not to cause any disrespect.

 The flag was the only thing the sadhvi was restrained about. Addressing a 30,000-strong crowd, the former Madhya Pradesh chief minister spared none. 

 She lashed out at railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav and dubbed him the country?s ?number one thief?, wondering how a person of Manmohan Singh?s integrity could tolerate him. ?Laloo ko rail aur Uma ko jail (Laloo gets a ministry and Uma jail).?

 Saying she did not doubt the Prime Minister?s integrity, Uma added: ?Dr Singh should either drop him or put in his papers.?

 Laloo Prasad?s bete noire George Fernandes said the Singh government was surviving on the National Democratic Alliance?s mercy. ?We can end the rule whenever we wish to,? the NDA convener added.

 He also said it was matter of concern and ?shame? that the Singh regime was hiring World Bank consultants to shape Indian policies.

 Congress general secretary Digvijay Singh?s brother Laxman, now a BJP MP, also addressed the rally. Laxman said ?he could say with pride? now that he belonged to a ?nationalist party?.

 Uma said the Congress flag should be ?snatched? away as it resembles the Tricolour. ?The party is winning because it is managing to confuse the masses with its party flag that has the same colour scheme as the national flag. I will ask my party chief Venkaiah Naidu to formally approach the Election Commission to debar the Congress from using the Tricolour,? she said.

 Uma was given a rousing reception here which somewhat compensated for a lacklustre show at Burhanpur, bordering Maharashtra, last evening.

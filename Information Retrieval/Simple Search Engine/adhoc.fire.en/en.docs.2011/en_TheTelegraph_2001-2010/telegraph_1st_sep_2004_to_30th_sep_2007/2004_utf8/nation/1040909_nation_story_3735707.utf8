 Left push for power act review

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 8: The United Progressive Alliance government might consider the demand of the Left parties for a review of the Electricity Act 2003 which ensures the entry of private investors in this sector.

 Yesterday, a delegation of Left trade union leaders headed by CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and urged him to review the act. Singh, though hesitant at first, assured the delegation that he would talk to the Union power minister.

 The Left wants the government to set up a full-fledged committee that can look into the issue. ?We want a proper discussion,? a senior Left leader said.

 The Congress is not opposed to private participation in the sector but the Left?s main argument against it is that it would hike electricity tariffs. The altercation between the Left and former Andhra Pradesh chief minister . Chandrababu Naidu had peaked on this issue. The Left had opposed Naidu?s policy of inviting private participation in the power sector.

 Today, the Left added to its list of complaints ? which is growing longer by the day. Leaders of the four Left parties criticised the inclusion of World Bank and Asian Development Bank representatives in the Planning Commission?s consultative committees and have urged the government to reconsider the step.

 ?This is the first time representatives of such agencies are being included in the commission. Including representatives of foreign private companies in the consultative committees is an unwarranted step. It will not be acceptable to the Indian people,? the four Left parties said in a joint statement.

 ?The Manmohan Singh government must explain why it wants World Bank representation in the Planning Commission when the Congress holds the World Bank?s structural adjustment policies responsible for the miserable plight of farmers and ordinary people,? they said.

 The Left parties underlined that the inclusion of foreign representatives in a commission, which is accountable to the government, is unacceptable to them. 

 ?The Planning Commission oversees the implementation of five-year plans. It also plays a key role in the allocation of resources to the states,? they stressed.

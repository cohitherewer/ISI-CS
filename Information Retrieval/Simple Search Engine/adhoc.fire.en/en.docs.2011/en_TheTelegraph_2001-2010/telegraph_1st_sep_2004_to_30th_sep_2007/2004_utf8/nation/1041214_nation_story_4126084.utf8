 US balm on fighter sore

 New Delhi, Dec. 13: The US has said it is ?deeply sensitive? to India?s concerns and is yet to take a decision on the sale of F-16 aircraft to Pakistan.

 The clarification, made this afternoon by the American ambassador in Delhi, David Mulford, comes in the wake of strong protests from India.

 Mulford said the US is willing to be a major supplier of defence equipment to India but Delhi also has a role to play. ?It cannot be (a) unilateral decision on our part; the Indian government has to decide on this matter. After all, it takes two to tango.?

 US defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld got to know of India?s opposition to the proposed aircraft sale when he visited Delhi last week. 

 Defence minister Pranab Mukherjee has made it clear that the move would have a negative impact on the ongoing peace talks between India and Pakistan.

 ?We are deeply sensitive about the Indian concerns on the matter. The defence secretary has gone back to the US fully aware of Delhi?s position,? Mulford said.

 The proposed sale turned out to be a flashpoint in India?s discomfort over growing ties between Washington and Islamabad. 

 A resolution had been passed by the US Congress to make Pakistan one of its closest strategic allies. 

 In the 9/11 Recommendations Act, Washington has approved a waiver on all existing sanctions on Pakistan for the next two years. It has also extended the current levels of assistance of $3 billion, valid till 2009, without any time limit.

 Significantly, the act invokes the ?sense of the Congress? provision to say that the US should encourage Islamabad ?to seek to resolve outstanding difficulties with its neighbours, other countries?.

 To the Indian establishment, the ?difficulties? would read as the Kashmir conflict. Washington, however, argues that the provision is in Delhi?s interest as ?it encourages Pakistan to restore democracy and improve relations? with India. 

 ?Our attempt is to de-hyphenate our relations with India and Pakistan. The two relations are independent of each other,? Mulford said. 

 To support his view, he pointed out that Rumsfeld had not clubbed a visit to Islamabad with his trip to India. ?It was a significant visit as he was the first cabinet-level person to come to Delhi for talks with the Indian leadership after the US elections,? he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 ?State? bouncer hurled at Zee

 R. VENKATARAMAN

 New Delhi, Sept. 28: India?s 

 cricket board today asked the Supreme Court to dismiss Zee 

 Telefilms? writ petition against cancellation of the bidding 

 process for telecast rights as the BCCI was not a ?state? 

 as defined by Article 12 and no violation of fundamental 

 rights was involved.

 Under Article 12 of the Constitution, a corporation, a metropolitan body and any such organisation that discharges the functions of the state is construed to be a ?state?. As the BCCI is not a state within the meaning of this article and its ?contractual obligation or otherwise is with another individual firm or concern?, no writ petition could be filed to enforce a fundamental right, BCCI counsel K.K. Venugopal told the five-judge Constitution bench.

 Normally, for enforcement of a fundamental right, a writ petition has to be filed.

 ?A regulatory body of a game of sports need not be a government body and hence cannot come under the description of state enshrined in Article 12,? Venugopal said. 

 The counsel?s indirect argument is that as the BCCI is an ?autonomous? body, which does not receive any money, grant or subsidy from the government, Zee has to file a suit for specific performance.

 Normally, for contractual violations, a suit for specific performance is filed with a court fee of a minimum of 1 per cent of the value of the case. As the money involved in this dispute is estimated to be Rs 10,000 crore, the fee for a specific performance suit would be Rs 100 crore. The court fee for a writ is Rs 50.

 The whole case now rests on this point of maintainability of Zee Telefilms? writ against the BCCI. The channel, locked in a war with rival ESPN-STAR Sports over rights to cover all cricket matches played in India over the next four years, had emerged the highest bidder before the board cancelled the tender process on September 21. Zee accuses the BCCI of entering into a ?conspiracy? in a ?mala fide manner? to cancel the tender process to benefit a particular sports channel.

 Zee has also filed a special leave petition against Bombay High Court?s decision to permit ESPN-STAR Sports to withdraw its petition on the BCCI?s submission that the board was terminating the contract with Zee.

 ESPN-STAR Sports supported the BCCI?s stand, though in its arguments before Bombay High Court it had said the board ?is a state?. The change of stand came in the sports bouquet?s counter-affidavit in the apex court.

 The apex court has already issued notices to ESPN-STAR Sports, the BCCI and the Centre on the writ filed by Zee. The hearings will continue tomorrow.

 Pesticide rap

 Jaipur, Dec. 21 (PTI): 

 Rajasthan High Court today issued showcause notices to 47 

 food companies, including MNCs, the Centre and the state 

 government for not specifying pesticide content in food 

 products. 

 A division bench of Justices S.K. Keshot and Ajay Rastogi issued notices on a PIL filed by an NGO stating that food material, particularly packed products, manufactured by these companies have higher pesticide content ? a lot more than the prescribed maximum residue limit.

 The NGO, Public Action Group, quoting research reports of the Indian Agricultural Research Institute and the Indian Council of Medical Research, told the court that the high-level pesticide contents have harmful effects on people, particularly infants. 

 The petitioner produced packets of flour, butter, cereals and cheese, made by national and multinational companies, in the court. 

 The judges had instructed the NGO to present them as proof since the companies did not mention the contents on the packets.

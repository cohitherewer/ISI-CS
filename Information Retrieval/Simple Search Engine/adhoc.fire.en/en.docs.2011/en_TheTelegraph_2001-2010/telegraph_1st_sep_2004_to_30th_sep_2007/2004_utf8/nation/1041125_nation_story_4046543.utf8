 80 horsepower amp; more to match Arabian horse 

 GAJINDER SINGH

 Chandigarh, Nov. 24: Eighty horsepower in return for an Arabian horse just won?t do for Amarinder Singh.

 The Punjab chief minister, who is the scion of the Patiala royal family, has not forgotten the Arabian horse that his counterpart from Pakistan?s Punjab gifted him during a visit to Lahore earlier this year.

 So Amarinder is pulling out all stops to make the visit of Pervaiz Elahi a memorable experience. Not just an 80-HP tractor, a range of gifts will be bestowed on the visiting dignitary.

 The state government has set up a three-member committee to choose gifts for Elahi, his wife, their two sons and their wives and parents-in-law when they come visiting during the first mega confluence of east and west Punjab in Patiala from December 1 to 10.

 Officials in the chief minister?s office whisper that the panel is already scouting for gifts in Delhi and some other parts of the country. ?Most of the things that can be given to Elahi can be found in both Punjabs. We are looking for gifts that are different,? an official said.

 The tractor will be gifted to Elahi at the agri fair to be held here from December 3. He will be honoured with a doctorate, too, but the government feels these alone will not be enough.

 ?Both Punjabs have been the most affected since Independence. And both stand to benefit the most once complete peace returns to the region. It is imperative for us to repay in kind the wonderful hospitality Amarinder received during his trip,? an official said. 

 ?The gifts,? he added, ?or the amount they are being purchased for do not matter.? The government, enquiries revealed, has put its coffers at the disposal of the gift committee. The names of members are not being disclosed.

 ?Among the things being purchased are silverware, expensive crockery, woodcraft and some other items. We would like each member of the chief minister?s family to take back a part of India,? an official said.

 Elahi and family would be put up at Amarinder?s Moti Bagh Palace in Patiala on arrival on December 2, following a programme at Guru Nanak Dev University in Amritsar.

 The next day, Elahi would be in Chandigarh to inaugurate the agri fair. On December 4, he would leave for Agra and Jaipur and, the following day, return to Chandigarh for lunch with the legislators. 

 That evening, he would be in Patiala again to attend the East-West Joint Punjab Games. He will leave for Pakistan the next morning.

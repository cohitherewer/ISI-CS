 Culture fest 

 New Delhi, Nov. 3: For the first time, the country?s most exclusive club will celebrate 42 years of bridging culture and communities with a festival of dance, music, art, film and food over six days from Friday, reports our correspondent.

 The 1962-born India International Centre, where the Prime Ministers, ministers and decision-makers rub shoulders with the intelligentsia, will celebrate its role in the ?meeting of minds? with the IIC Experience ? a Festival of Arts.

 The cultural extravaganza will bring the IIC alive with a bit of Dadi D. Pudumjee?s puppetry from Broadway, art from Nilima Sheikh, Kristine Michael and Jyotsna Sehgal, and 20 classics from masters of world cinema like Kurosawa, Fritz Lang, Jean Renoir and Satyajit Ray. While classical vocalist Shubha Mudgal will fill the evenings with her khayal renditions, Aruna Sairam will present Carnatic vocals. An evening of Alarmel Valli?s Bharatnatyam will be juxtaposed with Sikkimese folk dances.

 To complement each cultural evening, a food fest will showcase the IIC?s excellence when it comes to culinary skills from all over India.

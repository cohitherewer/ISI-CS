 Row over ?Ram? on waiters? dress

 Jaipur (PTI): A five-star hotel here 

 has been charged with ?hurting religious sentiments? after 

 the waiters in its bar allegedly served liquor wearing ?saffron 

 clothes with the word Ram inscribed on them? on Ramnavami.

 ?A case of ?hurting the religious sentiments with malice? has been lodged against the Rambagh Palace (of Taj group of hotels) in Ashok Nagar area, and the probe has begun,? superintendent of police Sanjay Agarwal said.

 The case was registered following complaints by the public based on a media report that waiters and waitresses ?wearing saffron coloured clothes with Ram inscribed on them and rudraksh necklace? served drinks to foreigners at the hotel?s bar, he added.

 Dilip Puri, general manager of the hotel, said on phone that the event hosted on Friday was based on the Bollywood theme of ?Dum maro dum? (a song in Dev Anand?s movie Hare Rama Hare Krishna) and was not a religious one. ?It was not our intention to hurt anybody?s religious sentiments... It was unfortunate that the event coincided with the Ramnavami,? he said, adding the press coverage of the event was allowed.

 A Vishwa Hindu Parishad spokesman, Mahaveer Pareek, condemned the incident saying ?it was the most ugly face of hoteliers and a clear evidence of cultural invasion?. Rajasthan Congress spokesman Riyazuddin Sheikh said the event hurt Hindu traditions.

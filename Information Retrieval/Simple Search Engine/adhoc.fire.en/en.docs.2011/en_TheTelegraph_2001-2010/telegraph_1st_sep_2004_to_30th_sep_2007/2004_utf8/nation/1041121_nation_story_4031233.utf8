 Alarm on church incense smoke

New Delhi (PTI): Church candles and incense can be dangerous 

to the lungs, according to a study by Dutch scientists.

 The air in a church contains more polycyclic hydrocarbons, which cause cancer, than around busy roads. It also has particulate matter levels of up to 20 times the European limit, says the study. 

 With candlelight filling churches on Christmas, December could be an especially dangerous month for the lungs, according to a communication by the Netherlands research team, to be published in next month?s European Respiratory journal. 

 Theo de Kok and his team from the University of Maastricht had analysed particulate matter concentration in the air of a small chapel and a large basilica in Maastricht after candles or incense had been burnt for a long time. 

 Fine particulate matter contains different types of toxic chemicals, including soot, metals and various carcinogenic molecules. The particles can penetrate very deep into the lungs and can be dangerous.

 The scientists found that after the usual nine hours of burning candles, the air in churches ? which traditionally have poor ventilation ? had particulate levels of 600 to 1,000 micrograms per cubic metre, which is 12-20 times the European limit. 

 Left glare on Wakf ?raw deal?

New Delhi: The CPM has drawn the attention of the Congress-led 

government at the Centre to a series of ?irregularities? committed by the NDA 

regime in the management of central and state Wakf boards, reports our special 

correspondent.

 ?During the NDA regime, the Wakf board received a raw deal since it represents a minority committee,? Hanan Mollah, a CPM member of Parliament, said in a letter to Meira Kumar, the Union minister for social justice.

 Mollah, the chairperson of West Bengal Wakf Board, has accused the NDA government of reconstituting the central Wakf board in 2003 in violation of the 1995 Wakf Act. ?Some of the members were nominated illegally without reference to their eligibility qualifications,? said the MP.

 The CPM has demanded an inquiry into the bunglings. ?A proper inquiry will reveal everything,? maintained Mollah.

 New Delhi, Oct. 3: The Delhi government?s plans for heritage conservation are no longer limited to ancient monuments like the Qutab Minar and the Red Fort. 

 It is mulling a bill that will, for the first time, designate precincts of historical significance like Connaught Place, aesthetic, architectural or cultural significance like Lutyens? bungalow zone, as well as natural features of environmental significance like the Delhi Ridge for preservation. 

 The proposed Delhi Heritage Conservation Bill will widen the scope beyond buildings, artefacts and structures. On the lines of the heritage conservation committee in Mumbai, the bill will establish a Delhi Heritage Conservation Authority that will have powers to regulate conservation, protect and manage heritage sites and levy stiff penalties. 

 Shyam Chainani of the Bombay Environment Action Group, which was consulted by the government, said: ?The heritage conservation committee is very active in Mumbai and similar committees are working in Hyderabad and Pune. For instance, in Bandra, the Indian Navy wanted the naval dockyard shifted out. As it is a heritage precinct, we were able to get it stopped.? 

 Till now, only ancient monuments more than 100 years old were protected in Delhi by the Archaeological Survey of India under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1958. 

 As a result, more than 1,200 monuments and 26 precincts listed by the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (Intach) that the ASI does not protect and several national monuments, particularly those that acquired importance during the freedom struggle, have been neglected. 

 ?We have made a list of Delhi monuments but the government has been dilly-dallying on notifying this list. Once the authority is set up, no one can touch a heritage site without its approval. Two months back, the Supreme Court had instructed local authorities to make necessary amendments in the building by-laws for heritage conservation. For this, a committee has to be set up and legislation has to be further strengthened,? said Intach Delhi convener .P. Jain. 

 The authority will have experts in heritage conservation, two structural engineers, two architects, two environmentalists, two historians, the municipal commissioner, the Delhi Development Authority vice-chairman, the chairperson of the New Delhi Municipal Corporation, the ASI director and the Delhi Urban Arts Commission secretary. The principal secretary of the urban development department will be its member secretary. 

 The provisions for protection of heritage buildings in the building by-laws now lack teeth. If the bill is passed, the government will identify heritage sites for conservation, prohibit alterations to any designated property and even acquire it for maintenance. 

 The bill provides for jail up to three years and a fine of Rs 10,000 for first-time offenders. For subsequent offences, a fine of Rs 5,000 can be levied every day till it is set right. Once a site gets the tag, all building permissions would have to be issued by local bodies in conformity with the heritage conservation plans.

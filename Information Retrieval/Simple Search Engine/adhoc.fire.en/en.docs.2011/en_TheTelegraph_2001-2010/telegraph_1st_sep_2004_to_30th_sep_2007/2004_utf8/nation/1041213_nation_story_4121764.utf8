 Court blow to cop hopes of youths

 FARHANA KALAM

 Gaya, Dec. 12: The Bihar government?s decision to recruit Urdu darogas (sub-inspectors with knowledge of Urdu) has run into rough weather even before it can gather steam.

 While Patna High Court has stayed the recruitment on account of non-conformity with the Bihar police manual, sceptics like Left-wing activist Shree Bhagwan Bhaskar have slammed the move, calling it a gimmick ahead of the Assembly election.

 But the decision has its fair share of supporters as well, especially among the jobless youths in the state. Undeterred by the stay order, the youths have been practising hard in the hope that they will pass the test ? whenever that happens ? with flying colours.

 ?Even if it is a gimmick, the decision (to recruit sub-inspectors) has done a lot of good to the youths of Bihar. Quite a few of them have given up habits like smoking and rising late. Now, they are up early in the morning to join the race for darogas,? said Amit Kumar, a youth of Gaya.

 Like in other places of Bihar, jobless youths could be seen in Gaya town toiling hard for the physical test at places like Gandhi Maidan, Gaya College grounds and Azad Park. 

 The threat of abduction ? which has kept morning-walkers off the streets ? has not prevented the sub-inspector aspirants from practising early in the morning.

 During practice, the youths crack jokes to ward off pessimism. Two young men at the Gaya College grounds were heard saying that their daily practice sessions would make them fit enough to become ?booth-grabbers? in case the police recruitment doesn?t take place.

 On November 28, a group of youths went on the rampage at Patna Golf Club after it was denied entry. The youths, who had been practising on the club premises for their physical test, turned violent after they found that the management had closed the gate owing to preparations for a national tournament.

 Bihar police have not witnessed any recruitment for almost a decade and the absence of fresh talent has adversely affected the efficiency of the force. 

 Many in the current police force do not have the fitness required to conduct challenging operations.

 Former Bihar director-general of police V.P. Jain had tried to address this problem but the concerted efforts of senior officials ensured that the personnel remained unfit.

 According to M. Rahman, a retired officer, many policemen in Bihar do not bother much about their fitness and their higher-ups mostly choose to look the other way instead of cracking the whip.

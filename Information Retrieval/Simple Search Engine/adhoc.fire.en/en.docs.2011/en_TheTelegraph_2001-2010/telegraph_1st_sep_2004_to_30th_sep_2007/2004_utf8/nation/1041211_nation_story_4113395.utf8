 Patnaik: Hitting back

 Bhubaneswar, Dec. 10: Orissa chief minister Naveen Patnaik has said the Opposition has been making false allegations against him and the government over the Tangarpada mining issue.

 ?My conscience is clear,? Patnaik said during a debate last evening. 

 Orissa High Court recently rejected the joint venture between Industrial Development Corporation Ltd and Jindal Strips Ltd. Following the verdict, the Congress-led Opposition launched a tirade against the chief minister.

 ?Why has the Opposition started this huge conspiracy against the government and me?? Patnaik asked.

 He said the government has not made tax concessions to Jindal Strips and added that the files of the mining deal never came to his office. ?The government has acted with due diligence and transparency,? Patnaik said.

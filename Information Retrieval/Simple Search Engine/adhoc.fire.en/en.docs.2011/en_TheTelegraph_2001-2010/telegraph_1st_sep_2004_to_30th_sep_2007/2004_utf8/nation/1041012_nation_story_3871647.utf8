 India set to get more British jobs 

 AMIT ROY

 London, Oct. 11: Britain?s second-largest general insurance group, Royal amp; Sun Alliance, is to save ?10 million a year by outsourcing 1,100 jobs in call centres, administration and processing to India over the next two years.

 Anticipating an angry reaction from the unions, Duncan Boyle, the UK chief executive of Royal amp; Sun Alliance, explained: ?We are in a very competitive environment and processing some of our work in India will not only help us control costs but also give us greater operational flexibility.?

 The insurance group already has 100 staff attached to a pilot office in Bangalore, to which many of the new jobs will be moved. The office was opened by Accenture, a consultancy firm. It is now intended to open a second location for the further transfer of jobs.

 The company said it would try to avoid compulsory redundancies but was unable to offer guarantees on this or that there would not be more job transfers. The 1,100 jobs being shifted represent 10 per cent of the UK workforce.

 The chancellor of the exchequer, Gordon Brown, has spoken of the ?challenge? posed to the economy of Britain by India and China. Quite what the chancellor means is unclear, although some Indian diplomats have said that ?Gordon Brown is on our side?.

 The unions are continuing to press the government, though, to stem the steady outsourcing of jobs to India.

 David Fleming, the national secretary of Amicus, the biggest private-sector union, said today: ?This announcement clearly shows that offshoring presents an unprecedented threat to UK jobs and the economy. Over 8,000 job losses have been announced over the last few weeks.?

 He added: ?The government needs to make raising skills a priority. Policies to enable the UK to compete need to be actioned with urgency to reverse employer under-investment in training and development, which will hamstring the UK service sector if it is allowed to continue.? 

 Norwich Union has already announced it is to transfer thousands of jobs to India by 2007.

 Fleming said Amicus and Unifi, the banking union, were working to ensure that as far as possible the reduction in UK jobs would be ?managed through natural turnover and redeployment?. 

 He said: ?The UK has the second-lowest level of investment in training per head in Europe. If the UK is to benefit from globalisation and free markets then there needs to be a significant change in attitude to skills and training from employers. Amicus is calling on the government to do more to encourage employers to invest in skills for the long term.?

 IAF gets ready for rebuttal

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 9: The Indian Air Force today prepared to appeal against a Delhi High Court order that quashed the proceedings of a special promotion board and put a question mark on four of its seniormost officers even as defence minister Pranab Mukherjee said moves were on to stop disputes in the armed services from spilling over to civilian courts.

 Mukherjee said the order issued by Delhi High Court yesterday that questioned the credibility of the force?s promotions policy was being carefully studied and would be challenged through a special leave petition in the Supreme Court.

 The Delhi High Court order, issued after two air vice-marshals petitioned against the recommendations of a February 2003 special promotion board, has thrown air headquarters into a quandary over four of its air marshals ? A.D. Joshi, J.S. Gujral, F.H. Major and A.K. Singh. Joshi heads the Eastern Air Command and Gujral is deputy chief of air staff. Major is deputy chief of integrated defence staff and Singh is senior air staff officer, Western Air Command.

 The four officers were recommended for promotion to the rank of Air Marshal by the board that negated the claims of Air Vice-Marshals Harish Masand and T.S. Chatwal. Masand retired in January this year but would have served for at least two more years had he been promoted.

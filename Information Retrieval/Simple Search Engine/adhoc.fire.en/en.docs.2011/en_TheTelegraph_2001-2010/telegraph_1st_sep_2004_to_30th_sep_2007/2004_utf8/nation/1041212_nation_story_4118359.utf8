 Rival calls for Laloo, Paswan scalp

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Lucknow, Dec. 11: The BJP blast on Laloo Prasad Yadav and Ram Vilas Paswan continued with former party president M. Venkaiah Naidu today demanding their removal from the cabinet.

 ?We demand their expulsion from the ministry. The Union ministry is collectively responsible for their conduct in Parliament and they have clearly misled the House by furnishing false statements,? said Naidu, who was in the city to attend the BJP?s state executive meeting. 

 He slammed Prime Minister Manmohan Singh for keeping quiet while the two senior ministers were locked in a war of words, accusing each other of involvement in scams.

 Naidu described Laloo Prasad as ?a cut above all other politicians in misleading people? while Paswan, he said, appears to have buckled under pressure to tell lies.

 The BJP leader was referring to the railway minister disowning his reported remarks against Paswan, who holds the chemicals and fertilisers portfolio. ?When we protest and demand a statement from the government, we are charged with stalling the proceedings of the House,? Naidu said. 

 The UPA partners have forgotten that when the NDA was in power, the Opposition had disrupted 430 business hours of Parliament, he added.

 Naidu threatened to keep up the heat on the two warring ministers from Bihar and said the BJP might not let the House run till the Prime Minister makes a statement. With the coming Assembly polls in Bihar and Jharkhand on his mind, the former BJP chief is unlikely to stall the barrage of criticisms soon.

 Naidu said a new political equation uniting all constituents of the NDA who formed the anti-Laloo Prasad brigade in 2000 is unlikely to be forged now as Paswan does not seem eager to part with the Congress. ?The Janata Dal (U) and the BJP will try to bring together other smaller parties in the state to go to polls in Bihar against Laloo Yadav,? he added. ?Despite Nitish Kumar trying hard to bring Ram Vilas Paswan back to the NDA fold, the latter seems to be in no mood to change his mind.?

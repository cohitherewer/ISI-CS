 New Delhi, Dec. 1: Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee?s winter of discontent has begun.

 Chatterjee?s plate was full on the first day of the winter session as he had to tackle belligerent MPs from diverse parties. One after another, they stirred up trouble and finally forced an adjournment.

 First, the BSP stalled proceedings for 30 minutes demanding action against the arrest of one of its MLAs in Uttar Pradesh. After the din subsided and the House had functioned for some time, RJD members got into action. They raised allegations made by L.K. Advani?s former daughter-in-law Gauri against the BJP chief.

 The members waved newspaper copies, triggering noisy protests from the BJP. All BJP MPs, including senior leader Vijay Kumar Malhotra, rushed to the well of the House protesting against such a matter being raised in Parliament. 

 The Congress and the Left did not join Laloo Prasad Yadav?s brigade. But the RJD MPs kept shouting and the BJP retaliated, forcing the Speaker to adjourn the House 15 minutes ahead of lunch break.

 In the past month, Chatterjee has spent time talking to leaders of political parties at separate and joint meetings to ensure a smooth session.

 Trouble, however, erupted on the first day from unexpected quarters. The government had anticipated trouble from the Opposition BJP but it was the BSP that started it. 

 Eleven BSP MPs sought the dismissal of the Samajwadi Party-led government in Uttar Pradesh because it had arrested their party colleague, Mohammad Tahir. They stood in the well of the House and shouted slogans at the top of their voices.

 The Speaker struck a firm note and threatened to suspend the members if they did not return to their seats. ?I will name you and suspend all of you,? he said. ?I will do whatever I have not done before. Whoever comes to the well of the House will be suspended.?

 He had begun the process of suspension when senior Congress leaders Priya Ranjan Das Munshi and Suresh Pachauri went to the well and asked BSP members to return to their seats. ?Yeh tamasha nahin chalega (This mockery cannot go on),? Chatterjee said.

 The MPs finally went back to their seats. But peace did not last. A group of Left MPs from Kerala charged the Indian Union Muslim League with beating up journalists and intimidating members. They demanded a statement from Union home minister Shivraj Patil, but he did not intervene.

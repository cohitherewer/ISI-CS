 Author takes Ulfa message to PM

 ALOKE TIKKU

 Mamoni Goswami

New Delhi, Nov. 16: Celebrated Assamese writer Mamoni Raisom Goswami today took another step towards bringing the Ulfa to the negotiation table by meeting Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to convey the banned militant group?s willingness to start a dialogue with Delhi. 

 Goswami told the Prime Minister that the Ulfa was ready for ?unconditional talks?, but wanted the subject of ?sovereignty? to be the main item on the agenda. The meeting was held at Singh?s South Block office and lasted over half-an-hour. 

 Singh is understood to have communicated the United Progressive Alliance government?s seriousness about finding a solution to the problem of militancy in Assam.

 ?The Prime Minister is very, very keen to find a solution as Assam is his own constituency,? Goswami told the media after her meeting. 

 The writer yesterday met M.K. Narayanan, the special adviser to the Prime Minister, with an advance copy of the memorandum she submitted to Singh.

 Though the Prime Minister did not make any specific commitments, Goswami was not disappointed. ?I understand that he will have to find out a middle path after discussing (the issue) with experts. Without the sovereignty issue, Ulfa leaders will not come (for discussions),? she said. 

 Goswami said no timeframe or modalities for talks with the Ulfa, or the names of possible mediators, were discussed.

 ?It is a very long process and things have not gone to that level. But the government is trying to find a solution,? she said.

 Ulfa commander-in-chief Paresh Barua contacted Goswami recently to convey the outfit?s eagerness to start a dialogue with the Centre, provided the contentious topic of Assam?s sovereignty was discussed. 

 Chief minister Tarun Gogoi has publicly backed the initiative despite the Ulfa making it clear that it has no intention of negotiating with the state government.

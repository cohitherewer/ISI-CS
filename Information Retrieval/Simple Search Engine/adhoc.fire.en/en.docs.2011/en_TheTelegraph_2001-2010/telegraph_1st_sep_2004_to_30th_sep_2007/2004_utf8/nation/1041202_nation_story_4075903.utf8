 Seer arrest debate in RS 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 1: The Kanchi seer controversy will come up for an unstructured discussion tomorrow in the Rajya Sabha.

 A similar discussion on the issue is likely in the Lok Sabha next week.

 The government reluctantly agreed to an Upper House discussion after the BJP made a strong plea for it at the Business Advisory Committee meeting.

 Government sources said a discussion on the Kanchi seer?s arrest ? by Tamil Nadu police ? was unwarranted as the matter was sub judice and the home minister could in no way respond to an issue that is within the domain of a state government and the courts.

 A Left member joked that Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayalalithaa should be made a member of Parliament for an hour so that she could reply to the discussion.

 Sources said members of her party, the ADMK, present at the committee meeting resisted pleas for a discussion but gave in as it would not be conducted under any specific rule.

 Uma meets Advani

 Uma Bharti returned to the plains from her ?vacation? in the Himalayas last night, came straight to the capital where she met Atal Bihari Vajpayee and then headed to Vellore to call on the Kanchi acharya.

 Late tonight, she had a 45-minute meeting with BJP president L.K. Advani at his residence.

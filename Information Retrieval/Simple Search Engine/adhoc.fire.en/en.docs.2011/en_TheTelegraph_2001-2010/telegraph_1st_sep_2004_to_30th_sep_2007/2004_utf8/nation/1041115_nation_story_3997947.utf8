 Cong win woe for Andhra ally

 K. SUBRAHMANYA

 New Delhi, Nov. 14: The Congress?s electoral success in Maharashtra spells trouble for the Telengana Rashtra Samiti chief in his home turf.

 Last month?s Assembly poll victory has convinced the Congress leadership against conceding the Samiti?s demand for a Telengana state.

 K. Chandrasekhar Rao and his party lieutenants might now go about setting one deadline after another for the Congress-led Centre and Andhra Pradesh government to act on the party?s ?promise? of creating a separate state. The latest deadline falls in December.

 ?In the run-up to the simultaneous Assembly and parliamentary elections in Andhra, we compromised on the Telengana statehood issue believing it was a critical factor in the elections,? said a senior Congress leader closely involved in the party?s Maharashtra poll strategy.

 ?In Maharashtra, we took the risk of completely sidestepping the Vidarbha statehood demand. Our success in Vidarbha region shows that the demand has no popular backing,? the leader added.

 The Congress leadership has thus concluded that the party could have done well in the Telengana region, too, even without making common cause with the Samiti, whose only poll plank was statehood.

 The Congress, a senior AICC functionary pointed out, had done as well in Andhra?s Telengana region as in the coastal and Rayalaseema regions where the party fought alone and feared a backlash over its support for statehood.

 The ruling United Progressive Alliance?s common minimum programme, however, promises to consider the demand on the basis of consultations and consensus among the coalition partners.

 ?That promise was made immediately after the parliamentary election and under pressure from the TRS,? a Congress leader said.

 The Congress is now unlikely to change its mind even if its UPA allies back the Samiti?s demand.

 That the party high command has no intention to stick to its Telengana promise became evident a couple of weeks ago when it effectively wound up the seven-month-old Telengana Regional Congress Committee.

 Its chief D. Srinivas, who was simultaneously the state Congress president, had joined the Andhra ministry. Kesava Rao was appointed the new state unit chief.

 The Congress, however, is willing to offer a face-saving formula to its junior ally from Andhra.

 ?The TRS has five members in the Lok Sabha. Keeping this in view, we will consider a way out for the TRS,? the AICC functionary said.

 ?Probably, both of us will go back to the pre-CMP position that we jointly envisaged before the twin elections in May -? that of setting up a second states reorganisation commission,? the functionary added.

 But the party may not offer a clear timeframe for constituting the commission. The TRS, Congress leaders said, would have no option but to accept the face-saver as it has no decisive say either in the government in the state or at the Centre.

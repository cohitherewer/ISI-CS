 Notice to Naidu on land deal

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, Sept. 24: Andhra Pradesh High Court today issued a notice to former chief minister . Chandrababu Naidu and several others for an alleged breach of trust in granting land to a multinational sports academy.

 The court admitted a writ petition of Congress leader P. Govardhan Reddy against the former TDP government for grant of 850 acres to the sports company, IMG-Bharata.

 The petitioner alleged that the past government had caused a breach of trust and committed an act of cheating by selling prime government land for a song. ?While the market rate of the land at Gachi Bowli and Shairpet locations was Rs 2 crore per acre, the government sold it to IMG-Bharata for Rs 50,000 per acre,? Reddy alleged.

 The court has issued notices to former revenue minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju, director of IMG-Bharata A.J. Kriger, Indian partner P. Ahobila Rao (Billy Rao), then revenue secretary D.C. Rosaiah, and the then tourism, sports and youth secretary Chandana Khan. 

 The Naidu government had signed the deal with IMG-Bharata, the Indian entity of an American sports conglomerate, a few months before the polls.

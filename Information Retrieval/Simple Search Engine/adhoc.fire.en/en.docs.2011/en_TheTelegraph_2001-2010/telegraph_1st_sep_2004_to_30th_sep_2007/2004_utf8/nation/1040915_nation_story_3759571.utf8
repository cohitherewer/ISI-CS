 ?Pagal? amp; ?joker? on VIP lips

 OUR BUREAU AND AGENCIES

 Hyderabad/New Delhi, Sept. 14: ?Uma Bharti ek pagal aurat hai (Uma Bharti is crazy).?

 This is how Karnataka chief minister Dharam Singh, on a visit to the Andhra Pradesh capital, chose to describe his former Madhya Pradesh counterpart who was detained recently on charges of inciting riots after a 1994 flag-raising ceremony on the disputed site resulted in several deaths. 

 Singh?s choice of words to describe a senior BJP leader might be intemperate but is in keeping with the recent trend of exchanges between political adversaries turning particularly nasty.

 Former Union minister Yashwant Sinha recently termed Prime Minister Manmohan Singh a ?shikandi?, even if he translated the word as puppet and not transvestite. Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh has recently been involved in nasty exchanges with Congress leader Satyavrat Chaturvedi and Laloo Prasad Yadav. The latter has also trained his guns on the BJP and former deputy Prime Minister .K. Advani.

 Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Laloo Prasad dubbed the BJP a ?python? and described Advani as an ?antarrashtriya bhagodi (international absconder) wanted in connection with a conspiracy to murder (Mohammad Ali) Jinnah.?

 Today the BJP responded in kind, dubbing the RJD chief ?a joker of the Congress circus? and termed his accusations as ?baseless and imaginary?. Spokesman Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said in Delhi that Laloo Prasad had made ?condemnable? charges against Advani and others only to ?cover up for his sins committed in Bihar during 15 years? of the RJD rule.

 He refuted allegations that the senior BJP leader was involved in the Babri Masjid demolition and also circulated a March 6,2002 report quoting the then Pakistani high commissioner Jehangir Ashraf Qazi as saying there was no case against Advani.

 ?For several days, (Laloo) Prasad has been levelling imaginary, baseless and fake allegations against BJP and NDA leaders. Every day he is levelling a fake allegation to create confusion,? Naqvi said.

 Singh continued the lexicon of abuse today. ?She did not bother to file proper affidavits before the Election Commission during her nomination for the last Assembly polls. She had mentioned about the pending case in her affidavit. As a result, my government pursued the case and summons were issued to her. Finally a non-bailable warrant was issued and she had to appear before the court,? he said.

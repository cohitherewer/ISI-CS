 Factory to reopen

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Malda, Dec. 7: The sleeper-manufacturing factory at Kaliachak in West Bengal?s Malda district will reopen tomorrow. The owner had closed down the unit on November 25 and threatened to move to Jharkhand citing Citu-sponsored labour problems.

 The decision follows a tripartite meeting convened yesterday by assistant labour commissioner Partha Pratim Chattopadhyay. Owner Sabyasachi Munshi said he had agreed to reopen his unit after the trade union leaders assured him that they would curb militant trade unionism and help increase production.

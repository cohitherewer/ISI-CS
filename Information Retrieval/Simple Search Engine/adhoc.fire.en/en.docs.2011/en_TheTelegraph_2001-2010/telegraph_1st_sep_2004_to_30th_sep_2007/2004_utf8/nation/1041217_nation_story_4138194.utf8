 SP transfer after high court rap 

 - Next hearing on Dec. 22

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Patna, Dec. 16: After Patna High Court yesterday intervened to stop the harassment of a Bettiah-based reporter, the Bihar government last night transferred West Champaran superintendent of police Paras Nath to Aurangabad. 

 Nath is accused of denying security to a doctor, Ranjan Kumar Deonath, who has allegedly received ransom calls from Manoj Mishra, an inmate of the Bettiah jail. The reporter, Vikas Singh, who wrote a series of stories on the district police?s alleged failure to contain crime, has also accused the officer of implicating him in a murder case. 

 The court yesterday observed that SP Nath stood prima facie guilty of tampering with the FIR filed by the brother of a construction worker who was employed by the reporter. The worker allegedly had a fall and died later in a hospital. 

 A division bench headed by acting Chief Justice Nagendra Rai had directed the deputy inspector-general of Champaran range, S.K. Bharadwaj, to ensure no coercive action was taken on Singh till further orders, besides observing that the investigation might be hampered if the SP remained in office.

 The government?s counsel, Suryadeo Yadav, told the court today that the SP has been transferred. Nath, a 1996 batch IPS officer, has exchanged the office with the SP of Aurangabad, M.R. Naik.

 While the government was quick to act on the court?s suggestion, state director-general of police Narayan Mishra today failed to appear before the court and present the report on the crime situation in West Champaran, pleading his helplessness in the wake of the strike by employees of Bihar secretariats. 

 The original report prepared by the former DIG of West Champaran range, K.P. Singh, was submitted to the DGP and state home commissioner about six months ago. The court yesterday directed the DGP to submit the original report today. 

 The case will be taken up again on December 22 and Mishra has been asked to submit the report on that day and brief the court on what steps the government has taken based on the report. 

 According to a story written by the ?victimised? reporter, there were 24 cases of kidnapping and 14 cases of rape in West Chmparan last month alone. 

 The Bettiah case, which started with the alleged ransom calls made to Deonath, a doctor of Narkatiaganj and Nath?s alleged denial of police security to him, came up in the high court while it was hearing a PIL filed by the state unit of the Indian Medical Association on the deteriorating crime situation in the state.

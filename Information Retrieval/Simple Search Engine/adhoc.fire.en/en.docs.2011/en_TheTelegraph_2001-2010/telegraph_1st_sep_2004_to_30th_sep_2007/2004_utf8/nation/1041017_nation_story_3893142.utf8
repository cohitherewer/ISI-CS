 Pappu Yadav romps home

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Oct. 16: Rashtriya Janata Dal leader Pappu Yadav today trounced R.P. Yadav of the Janata Dal (United) in the Madhepura Lok Sabha bypoll with a record 2.08 lakh margin of votes.

 The RJD leader, who is accused of murder and is in jail, bagged more than 3.65 lakh votes while his rival got just over 1.57 lakh.

 The Dal nominee was ?shocked? at the margin of his defeat. ?I never expected this to happen,? said the senior advocate, who twice represented the seat in Parliament.

 The results indicate that this is more a victory for Pappu Yadav the individual.

 ?Everyone cutting across caste and political lines voted for Pappu Yadav. His pro-people image as Purnea member of Parliament helped. The sympathy wave after he was sent to jail again on the Supreme Court?s orders also helped,? said an elderly resident of Madhepura.

 The RJD leader scored massive victories in five of the six Assembly segments and trailed only in Alamnagar, that, too, by merely 2,000 votes, despite Dal(U) leaders Sharad Yadav and Nitish Kumar campaigning for the party candidate.

 The Dal(U)?s campaign focus on Pappu Yadav?s criminal background did not click. ?This perhaps indicates a growing malaise afflicting Bihar?s society and polity,? said a Dal(U) leader from Madhepura.

 The massive vote for the RJD candidate has surprised even the party. ?It is unbelievable. A candidate?s background is not a factor with voters in Bihar. We were reluctant to campaign vociferously in favour of Pappu Yadav but people have voted for him in a big way,? said a senior RJD leader.

 The RJD celebrations were muted. Pappu Yadav?s supporters did not take out a victory procession.

 Sena soldiers turn away

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 Thackeray: Lying low

 Chiplun (Konkan), Oct. 10: For the Congress in Maharashtra, rebellion has been a way of life ? the word bhandkor (rebel) being enshrined in its lexicon. 

 For the monolithic Shiv Sena ? cemented by the persona of Bal Thackeray ? though, rebellion was unthinkable. A whiff of dissent and the patriarch would crack the whip.

 2004, however, presents a different picture. Thackeray?s writ is no longer law and the Sena is learning to cope with bhandkors.

 If in Mumbai, Thackeray?s former lieutenant Ramesh Yashwant Prabhu is contesting as an Independent from the prestigious Vile Parle (East), some 300 km away in Chiplun it is Bhaskar Jadhav.

 The portraits of Thackeray and his late wife, Matoshri, adorn the walls of both candidates? election offices. But a slogan in Marathi that reads, ?Swabhimaani aamhee matdar, Bhaskarraoshetye aamche umeedvar, (Our voters are self-respecting, so their candidate is Bhaskarrao)? in Jadhav?s office says it all.

 Neither he nor Prabhu can no longer ?tolerate? Thackeray?s alleged dictatorial ways. But neither would have rebelled had it not been for the fact that the Sena leader decided to lie low in these elections. Both made it clear that they were open about their post-poll option. 

 ?I am an Independent in every sense of the word,? declared Prabhu.

 A doctor by profession, Prabhu became a Sena MLA in 1987. In 1995, he was debarred from contesting an election as, along with Thackeray, he was implicated for corrupt practices under the Representation of People?s Act for using religion to garner votes.

 ?Balasaheb is still like a god to me but I was not given a ticket. Perhaps he felt that for another 10 years, I should just serve people. I decided to go ahead and fight on the rail engine symbol,? said Prabhu. 

 The symbol, he says, signifies ?connectivity with people? but the element of irony in the choice is unmistakable ? the rail engine was also the Sena?s first symbol.

 Jadhav, who runs a transport business, may prove to be a bigger headache for the Sena than Prabhu who, his supporters claim, does not have his ?full heart? into the fight. 

 ?Jadhav is not fighting to oppose the Sena but to win. The janta (public) is with him because of the work he has done. He built roads, bridges, started water supply schemes, a high school and pick-up sheds for bus commuters. Even Muslims are with him now that he has left the Sena,? said his poll agent, Vijay Surve. 

 Sena sources sounded diffident when asked about the impact the rebellion would have. 

 Vile Parle is considered Mumbai?s ?seat of education? with 10 colleges located there. Its votes saw the Sena through in the Hindutva era.

 However, Prabhu?s supporters claim, people have become ?sceptical? of the Sena?s spiels on morality. ?The rags-to-riches lifestyles of many of their leaders are there for people to see. We don?t have to do much. Our candidate just walks from door to door promising good administration of the constituency and transparency in fund utilisation,? said a family member of Prabhu.

 Jadhav?s rebellion has shown the Congress-NCP a ray of hope in the Konkan region, considered a Sena fortress for over 10 years. The combine now views Chiplun as a breakthrough of sorts.

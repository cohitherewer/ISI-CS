 Reforms for fiscal revival

 DEBABRATA MOHANTY

 Bhubaneswar, Dec. 12: The Orissa government is mulling over a proposal to restructure the revenue administration by creating four divisions in addition to the existing ones at Cuttack, Berhampur and Sambalpur.

 A memorandum prepared by development commissioner Ajit Tripathy has been circulated among cabinet ministers for their views. Reorganisation of the revenue divisions has become imperative as the three RDCs (10 districts under each division) have found it increasingly hard to cope with the workload and meet the expectations of the government, the memorandum said.

 It suggested that the offices the proposed revenue divisional commissioners (RDC) should be located at Balasore, Puri, Koraput and Rourkela. Four of the five commissioners, posted in the board of revenue and looking after settlement, consolidation and land reforms, could be deployed as commissioners of the new divisions. 

 Since these commissioners enjoy revisional powers, the memorandum recommended that such authority should be given to all seven RDCs to ensure proper service. 

 Tripathy has suggested that the undivided Kalahandi-Bolangir-Koraput region ? excluding Bolangir and Sonepur ? should be made into a separate revenue division with headquarters at Koraput. The commissioner of the proposed Koraput revenue division should be designated as RDC-cum-deputy chief administrator of Kalahandi and Koraput districts. The Sambalpur RDC will continue to serve as the deputy chief administrator of Bolangir and Sonepur. 

 The development commissioner, who is also the chief administrator of the KBK region, could effectively function from Bhubaneswar, the note said. The memorandum further said a commissioner should be posted as Puri RDC comprising the districts of Puri, Khurda and Nayagarh.

 The Puri RDC should also be in charge of the Lord Jagannath Temple administration to ensure that the collector and superintendent of police of that district would remain under his/her administrative control, it added.

 According to the proposal, Bhadrak, Balasore and Mayurbhanj districts would be under the Balasore RDC; Cuttack, Dhenkanal, Jagatsingpur, Jajpur and Kendrapara under the Cuttack RDC; Sundargarh, Keonjhar and Deogarh under the Rourkela RDC; Sambalpur, Bargarh, Jharsuguda, Balangir and Sonepur under the Sambalpur RDC; Koraput, Malkangiri, Rayagada, Navrangpur, Kalahandi and Nuapada under the Koraput RDC and Ganjam, Gajapati, Boudh and Kandhamal under the Berhampur RDC. 

 Tripathy has also suggested that the authority of RDCs should not be limited to regulatory and welfare jobs for expeditious disposal of revenue cases and effective supervision of anti-poverty programmes.

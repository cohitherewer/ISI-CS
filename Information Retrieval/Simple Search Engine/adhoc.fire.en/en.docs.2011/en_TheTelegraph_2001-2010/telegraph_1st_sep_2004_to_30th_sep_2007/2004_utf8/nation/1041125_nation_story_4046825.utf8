 Easier travel on table

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 24: India and Pakistan appeared to have narrowed down their differences on the use of travel documents for the proposed Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus service.

 Although Delhi would continue to insist that passengers use their passports, there are indications it might show flexibility by stamping visas not on the passports but on sheets that can be detached later.

 At the two-day talks between the two sides, the Pakistani team suggested starting another bus service between Jammu and Sialkot. One more bus route linking Khokrapar in Sindh and Munabao in Rajasthan is also on the table as part of the effort by the neighbours to strengthen people-to-people contact.

 The technical team of the two sides would meet in Delhi on December 7 and 8 to iron out differences on the travel document for the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus service. ?The effort at the forthcoming meeting would be to resolve our differences successfully,? foreign secretary Shyam Saran said.

 The issue was discussed at the meeting between Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and his Pakistani counterpart Shaukat Aziz today. Both sides felt the bus service should start as early as possible.

 The proposed service would cut across the Line of Control. As Pakistan argues that the LoC is a temporary line, not an international boundary, it is opposed to passengers using passports. ?It is our initiative and we want to resolve it in a constructive spirit,? Saran said.

 The foreign secretary?s comment suggests India is willing to walk the extra mile, though officials insisted there would be ?no compromise on India?s basic position? that passports would be the only document recognised for passengers.

 Earlier, South Block?s assessment was Pakistan, which was not keen on starting the bus service between the two Kashmirs, would try and stall it. But there is a growing feeling in Delhi that once the service starts, it would be so popular among Kashmiris that Islamabad might find it difficult to stop it in future.

 Stamping visas on detachable sheets was being considered keeping this in mind. It is a practice still followed by Israelis and Russians for people travelling to their countries.

 The Jammu-Sialkot bus service was initially proposed by India, but Pakistan had rejected it. 

 Banking ties

 India and Pakistan today decided to establish banking relations ? they will set up banks in each other?s countries on a reciprocal basis, foreign secretary Shyam Saran said. He added that the central banks of the two countries will ?take the idea forward?.

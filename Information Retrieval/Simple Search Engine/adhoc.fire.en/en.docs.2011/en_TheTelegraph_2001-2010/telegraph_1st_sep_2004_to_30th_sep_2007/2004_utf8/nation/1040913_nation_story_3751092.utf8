 Trash art fires up jawans

 GAJINDER SINGH

 Chandigarh, Sept. 12: For Lance Naik H.R. Majumdar of the 3/5 Gorkha Rifles, it is a dream come true. 

 A soldier from a 17-member team of the 10 Corps located in Bathinda, the largest cantonment in Asia, Majumdar has shed his gun for the time being and taken the trench to a different route ? that of making murals and statues from trash. His immediate officer, despite never having had to don olive green, is no less strict than the one doing the rounds in his barracks.

 Nek Chand, the creator of the much-acclaimed Rock Garden here, has taken up the role of a commander these days. And the soldiers are enjoying every minute of their stint with him in the garden, learning how to create, not destroy.

 ?It is impossible to imagine that such beautiful things can be created from trash. Here, we realised that we can do so with things we otherwise throw away. I learnt a lot from Chandji. I will not forget the experience all my life,? Majumdar said.

 Taking lessons from the master on creating a mural from broken pieces of pottery, bathroom fittings and stones, the army man added: ?Chandji is just like our commander ? he demands perfection in everything we do.?

 ?I had always dreamt of working with someone great since childhood, when I began making various designs on paper and even on the ground. I cannot believe that I am getting training to hone my skills from a master who has no equal in the world,? Majumdar said with a glint in his eyes.

 Working under directions of their ?commander?, the soldiers, led by junior commissioned officer Yam Bahadur Thapa, term their learning mission as another ?arty?? artillery ? operation. 

 ?We are serious about our work on the nuances of environmental architecture made famous by Nek Chand,? said Majumdar, even as Chand shouted at three soldiers using excess cement while designing moulds.

 ?We expect to carry the training to wherever we are posted and replicate what he has been able to accomplish here. Not many of us are learning the craft. But it would not be wrong to say that by training a few the entire army is learning from him,? he said.

 Chand has been holding practical classes every morning, afternoon and evening. ?He tells us when we go wrong. He asks us to think of the beautiful things in life and make a mural based on them. He is a master of this craft. A master who has done all the work here himself,? Majumdar said.

 Chand said the army had invited him to Bathinda but he asked the soldiers to be sent to the Rock Garden itself. ?I am pleased with their effort. The team is eager to learn the craft and I have been enjoying supervising the work.?

 Left silent on plan panel axe

 MONOBINA GUPTA 

 New Delhi, Sept. 30: The CPM greeted the Planning Commission?s decision to remove experts with uncanny silence.

 Montek Singh Ahluwalia, the Planning Commission?s deputy chairperson and the CPM?s bete noire, robbed the Left of a sense of victory by dropping not only all 14 ?foreign? experts but also the five Left economists who were members of the official consultative committees.

 The Left wants to minimise the influence of the World Bank and the IMF on the government?s policy decisions. However, now that all consultative committees have been disbanded, Ahluwalia will be free to consult representatives of foreign organisations on an ?individual basis?.

 CPM leaders refused to comment on the removal of the ?foreign? experts, for which the party had led a strident campaign, saying they had not received any official communication about the Planning Commission?s decision.

 The three top CPM leaders who had lobbied hard with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh against the ?foreign? experts were unavailable for comment. CPM general secretary Harkishen Singh Surjeet could not talk to the media because of health reasons. Senior politburo member Prakash Karat was out of the capital. The mobile phone of his colleague Sitaram Yechury was constantly ?out of range?.

 However, M.K. Pandhe, the Citu general secretary, who was part of the labour consultative committee of the plan panel, accused the government of having no courtesy and called Ahluwalia a ?World Bank agent?. He also held the Prime Minister responsible for weeding out the Left.

 The Left will again knock on the Prime Minister?s door. Surjeet and Yechury will meet Singh tomorrow over breakfast for clarifications.

 ?We want to know whether these committees would be reconstituted again or not. If so, who will be the members or experts on these committees? We will elaborate our stand on the issue after Yechury?s meeting with the Prime Minister,? CPM Bengal secretary and politburo member Anil Biswas said tonight.

 CPM veteran Jyoti Basu said this morning that a new formula was being worked out by the Centre. ?However, I do not know the details,? he said at the party headquarters on Alimuddin Street, Calcutta.

 But Singh is unlikely to ask Ahluwalia to further placate the Left.

 Four of the five economists ? Prabhat Patnaik, his wife Utsa Patnaik, C.P. Chandrashekhar and Jayati Ghosh ? who have been shown the door along with the foreign experts are from the Jawaharlal Nehru University?s Centre for Economic Studies. Thomas Issac is from Kerala?s Centre for Development Studies.

 ?We would like to know the logic behind dismantling all the consultative committees,? said senior CPI leader D. Raja. ?We had only raised the issue of the foreign experts.?

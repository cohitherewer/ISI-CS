 ?Dead? man returns in assassin garb

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Nov. 21: Kameswar Baitha is supposed to be dead, at least that is what Varanasi police would have you believe. On three occasions earlier, the police claimed that he had been shot dead in an encounter.

 But this self-styled zonal commander of the east Uttar Pradesh unit of the newly-formed CPI (Maoist) not only sent signed handouts to newspaper houses today claiming responsibility for the killing of policemen in Chandauli yesterday but also came on camera in a hideout to justify the organisation?s ?planned operation?.

 Seventeen policemen, including 10 Provincial Armed Constabulary jawans, were killed and arms, including AK-47 rifles, looted when a patrol van was ambushed and blown up with landmines around 8.30 am yesterday in Chandauli district, about 120 km from Varanasi. Suspected Naxalites had also killed three persons, including two forest guards, in the Naugarh forest area on Friday.

 Baitha said in the handouts that the killing was in retaliation to the police pressure on the democratic movements for tribals of the area. Hundreds of forest dwellers were evicted and their houses demolished in Naugarh forest during the past few months. ?This time, the poor have retaliated against a repressive government and our battle will continue,? said the statement.

 ?Our fight is against the exploitative forces in the government, both at the Centre and the state. The backward and the poor are now waking up against torture and deprivation,? the statement added.

 Police sources said the Naxalites have been operating in the five districts of eastern Uttar Pradesh bordering Bihar and Jharkhand since 1996. They have been expanding their base by championing the cause of backward-caste farmers, forest dwellers and tribals. 

 They recently launched a people?s guerrilla army comprising exploited women and teenaged boys from tribal families. Maoists from Nepal, just across the border, trained them in operating arms. Yesterday?s ambush was the local outfit?s first assignment.

 ?There have been some incidents of extortion and isolated killing but never has the organisation hit the security forces in this way,? said Varanasi range inspector-general of police Devraj Nagar. 

 There would not be any let-up in patrolling and deployment of police forces after the incident, rather these would be intensified, he added. He said six teams of security forces are conducting raids in the forest areas.

 Insiders in the district police said the Naxalites were exploiting the police-mafia nexus in the area to their advantage. A section of the local police was in league with the radicals, they claimed.

 It is learnt that during the Samajwadi Party?s executive meet in Jhansi, the issue of extremism figured in chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav?s speech. He said his government would launch a crackdown on Naxalites and also sought help from the Centre to combat the problem.

 Sharon deputy set for Delhi

 PRANAY SHARMA

 New Delhi, Nov. 20: Israeli Vice-Premier Ehud Olmert, who caused a furore last year by saying Yasser Arafat must be killed if there was to be any headway in the peace process, is slated to visit India next month.

 His visit is a sign that the United Progressive Alliance government has managed to de-link its ties with Israel from its support for the Palestinians.

 Relations between Delhi and Tel Aviv have been on the upswing since India upgraded diplomatic relations in 1992. But ties improved dramatically during the six years the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance was in power.

 The Congress regime?s decision to pursue close ties with Israel despite differences over the Palestinian statehood struggle indicates that bilateral relations will continue to flourish despite the change in government here.

 Olmert, the deputy to Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, made his controversial statement about Arafat around the time the Israeli Premier visited India in September last year. ?Killing (Arafat) is definitely one of the options. We are trying to eliminate all the heads of terror and Arafat is one of the heads of terror,? he had said.

 During his official visit here, Sharon had sought India?s help in isolating Arafat. But Atal Bihari Vajpayee made it clear that there would be no dilution in India?s support for Arafat, whom Delhi regarded as the chief leader of the Palestinian movement.

 The dates for Olmert?s visit have not been finalised, but he is likely to visit in December. His visit will be preceded by a joint working group meeting on counter-terrorism, scheduled for later this month.

 Earlier this week, two sides held their first foreign office consultation since the Congress came to power. The meeting went off well, the more so for Israel as foreign minister K. Natwar Singh assured the visitors that bilateral ties would not be affected by Delhi?s support for Palestinian statehood.

 Olmert is likely to lead a large business delegation, comprising more than 60 leading businessmen. 

 Tel Aviv will look to further strengthen trade and economic ties with Delhi.

 Bilateral trade is expected to reach nearly $2 billions by year-end ? a significant figure for a country as small as Israel. Tel Aviv will aim to take advantage of its broad-based relations with Delhi to increase the volume of trade.

 Israel seems able to reconcile to India?s stand on Palestine, but the area of concern now seems to be Delhi?s relations with Iran. 

 Israeli leaders are convinced that Iran is pursuing a clandestine nuclear weapons programme and want to stop this. The matter was discussed during the last interaction with India. Delhi said it was opposed to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and had an impeccable track record on proliferation.

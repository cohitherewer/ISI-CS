 BJP backs Kalbe Sadiq 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 15: A day after a section of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board opposed a discussion on population control and literacy among Muslims, the BJP?s Muslim face, Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, supported Maulana Syed Kalbe Sadiq?s proposal to bring both issues on board.

 Not only did Naqvi advocate population control among Muslims, the BJP spokesperson also demanded that politicians set an example by having small families.

 In a potshot at railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav and his nine children, the BJP leader said: ?There should be as much of a debate on fertile ministers as on tainted ones.? By Naqvi?s yardstick, the minister falls into both categories.

 Sadiq, the vice-chairman of the personal law board, suggested on Monday that January?s board meeting in Kozhikode deliberate on these matters, which the clergy regards as ?sensitive?.

 Board chairman Maulana Rabey Nadvi shot down the proposal, saying there was no place for family planning in Islam. Other board members said if there was a discussion, it would be according to shariat rules.

 Naqvi said: ?Population control is part of the overall well-being of the nation. The growth rate among Muslims is a speed-bump in bringing social and economic reforms to the community. If the clergy opposes family planning, it will be like erecting a hundred speed-bumps and that is not in the country or society?s interest. There is no place for such a rigid attitude in a democracy.?

 He asked the Congress and the ?secularists? if they endorsed the board?s stand.

 While Naqvi sounded reasonable on population control, he donned the BJP?s Hindutva mask on Laloo Prasad?s lifting of the ban on inter-state transport of cattle by rail.

 The BJP spokesman alleged that after the ban had been lifted, cattle were being sent from Bengal to Bangladesh to be slaughtered.

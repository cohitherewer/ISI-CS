 Dethroned Uma back to playing the boss

 Bhopal, Oct. 1: Uma Bharti is back in Bhopal with a bang.

 Home after the tiranga yatra, Uma today declared she is the boss. At a joint news conference when chief minister Babulal Gaur said he owed his chair to the top BJP leadership, she grabbed the mike to say: ?And I am that top leadership.?

 More was to follow. Uma said from December 1 to 30, she would review the state government?s performance in what she described as ?panch-ja? ? jan (human beings), jal (water), jameen (land), jangal and janwar (animals).

 Asked in what capacity she would do so, Uma retorted: ?As a concerned citizen of the state.? In the same breath, the former chief minister issued a veiled threat to her successor: ?Let nobody be under any illusion. It is a party government and all of us are committed to fulfil promises.?

 Gaur, who had earlier lined up with other ministers to receive Uma, was a picture of humility, nodding his head in approval and frequently folding hands to seek her blessings as she went on to claim that she alone was responsible for his elevation as chief minister. ?I will continue to provide the support system that he needs. He should indeed feel lucky,? she said.

 Asked if they would function like the Sonia Gandhi-Manmohan Singh team at the Centre, Uma snapped: ?That is a remote control. Here I am talking about support system.? 

 Uma refused to acknowledge reports of her differences with the BJP leadership, including M. Venkaiah Naidu and Pramod Mahajan. Asked if she felt let down by the BJP?s refusal to reinstate her as chief minister after her ?acquittal? by the Hubli court, Uma said: ?I do not wish to say anything. Why don?t you ask them??

 Gaur supporters were annoyed by Uma?s assertiveness and expressed dismay that she had shown little inclination to vacate the chief ministerial bungalow. However, the Uma camp ascribed the delay to adverse planetary movement. 

 Starting Tuesday, Uma will spend six days in Maharashtra to ?boost? the BJP?s poll prospects.

 of her ?best intentions? to vacate 6 Shyamla Hills, Uma was helpless on account of the ongoing ?pitrapaksh?, they said.

 Pitrapaksh is a 16-day period when most Hindus remember their ancestors, feed Brahmins and pay dakshina in their memory. The more conservative do not buy anything or undertake auspicious work and even avoid getting a haircut. Women do not wash their hair on some days.

 A close Uma aide claimed that Gaur, too, was a firm believer of ?pitrapaksh? and added that the official residence would be vacated on October 13 when a new moon would usher in ?good fortune?.

 Starting October 5, Uma will spend six days in Maharashtra to ?boost? the BJP?s poll prospects.

 Elections

 New Delhi, Sept. 25: The Congress-Nationalist Congress Party combine which lost 10 Lok Sabha seats in the general elections in Maharashtra due to the presence of BSP-backed rebels, is doing its best to sideline its unofficial candidates from the fray this time. 

 The party, which had underestimated the damage the rebels could do in the parliamentary polls, has set up a cell in Mumbai to coordinate and persuade the dissidents to withdraw their candidature. Today is the last day for withdrawal for the October 13 polls. 

 AICC general secretary Margaret Alva, in charge of the state, said senior leaders, including NCP chief Sharad Pawar and chief minister Sushil Kumar Shinde, PCC president Prabha Rau and Mumbai Congress chief Gurudas Kamat are coordinating the efforts.

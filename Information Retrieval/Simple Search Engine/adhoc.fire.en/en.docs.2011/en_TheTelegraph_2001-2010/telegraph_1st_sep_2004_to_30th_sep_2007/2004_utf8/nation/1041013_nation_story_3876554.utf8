 Delhi target in Mumbai poll

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, Oct. 12: As 

 Maharashtra goes to polls tomorrow, the exercise has become 

 like a Lok Sabha rather than a state election. 

 At stake is the fate of not only regional satraps like Bal Thackeray and Sharad Pawar but also that of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Congress president Sonia Gandhi and BJP leader Pramod Mahajan.

 Personalities apart, the outcome of the election is expected to impact the Centre to the extent that a loose grouping of ?anti-Sonia? forces in the Opposition may raise the ?instability? bogey and try and woo back former NDA constituents like the DMK and the Lok Janshakti Party. While the BJP has not plunged itself into the George Fernandes-inspired exercise, sources have already started claiming that a Congress defeat would start the ?countdown? to the downfall of the UPA government.

 Both the Congress-NCP and the BJP-Shiv Sena conceded that the battle was heading for a photo finish rather than an outright victory for either coalition. 

 A year ago, it appeared as though the BJP combine could unseat the Democratic Front government on the strength of anti-incumbency alone. There was no dearth of issues: the serial bomb blasts in Mumbai and other places, a record number of communal clashes, death by malnutrition of tribal children and farmers? suicides.

 However, the unseating of the NDA and a good monsoon helped stave off the anti-incumbency factor to an extent in that farmers in some parts were able to cut the losses induced by two successive droughts. 

 The Congress-NCP peddled the line that their coalition at the Centre and in the state would be to the latter?s gain.

 On the flip side, there are several things going against the Congress-NCP. In the absence of a wave, regional variations could be the main determinant and these are loaded against the combine. 

 The only areas where it has an edge over the BJP-Sena are Mumbai and western Maharashtra. 

 Mumbai, because Thackeray?s Marathi-centric pronouncements have antagonised the 22 per cent migrant voters from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. This vote plus the 16 per cent Muslim vote gives the Congress-NCP the electoral underpinning the BJP-Sena cannot match with its share of Maharashtrian votes.

 In western Maharashtra, although the alliance has resulted in a rash of ticket hopefuls contesting as rebels, the Congress-NCP has an edge because of Pawar?s formidable network in the sugar lobby and the perception that voters would go for party labels rather than candidates as a rule. In coastal Konkan, the BJP-Sena retains its traditional advantage.

 There was little good news for the Congress-NCP from Vidarbha, Marathwada and the tribal belt of north Maharashtra which have 138 of the 288 Assembly seats. 

 In Vidarbha, the BSP?s encroachment into the Congress? Dalit base continues relentlessly.

 Congress mum as parties blast BJP

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 6: The Congress today kept mum in the House, allowing the Samajwadi Party, the Rashtriya Janata Dal and the Left to blast the BJP on the Babri Masjid demolition.

 Twelve years ago on December 6, the mosque was demolished by in Ayodhya. 

 Raising the issue during zero hour, the protesting MPs called the BJP members ?anti-national?, accusing them of hatching a conspiracy to demolish the mosque. ?The minority community remembers the incident with anguish, while fundamentalist organisations celebrate this day as Vijay Divas,? said Samajwadi Party MP Ramji Lal Suman. 

 The comment triggered loud protests from the BJP and Shiv Sena members who rose with shouts of ?Jai Shri Ram?. The BJP?s deputy leader in the Lok Sabha, Vijay Kumar Malhotra, raised objection on the use of the term ?anti-national?. 

 As neither party would sit quiet, it was left to Chatterjee to crack his whip. ?Remember, you are on television. I will give everyone an opportunity to speak. But you must sit down,? he thundered. 

 But the Left MPs continued with their protests, with CPM?s Basudev Acharya claiming that ?former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Kalyan Singh in his deposition before the Liberhan Commission had said the conspiracy to demolish the masjid was hatched at the residence of L.K. Advani?.

 Chatterjee, however, put his foot down once refusing to allow RJD MPs, who had not sought prior permission to speak on the issue, to take to the floor. The Speaker made it clear that he would follow the rulebook stringently. He circulated a note that he received from a young MP asking the members to allow a proper discussion instead of making a din on every issue.

 The Speaker also expunged some of Suman?s remarks from the records.

 But the Shiv Sena and the BJP did not relent. ?Ayodhya is the land of Ram. A temple should be built at the spot,? Shiv Sena member Chandrakant Khaire demanded during the discussion.

 ?The Supreme Court has directed the idols cannot be removed from the spot,? said Malhotra.

 Chatterjee repeatedly warned the agitated MPs that he would take action against them if they did not behave in the House. At one juncture BJP members trooped into the well but senior leaders persuaded them to go back to their seats. 

 Efforts by Chatterjee to restrain the members proved futile as the heated exchanges continued. In the end, the Samajwadis walked out in protest.

 Once out of the House, the Congress members broke their silence. At a news briefing, party spokesperson Anand Sharma said: ?The BJP after losing power has done a somersault. The language it used in the House shows that the party endorsed what happened at Ayodhya on December 6.? 

 ?After 12 years it is necessary to remind the nation what happened that day.?

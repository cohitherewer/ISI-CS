 Patil details Northeast steps 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Oct. 12: Union home minister Shivraj Patil seems to have pacified Left leaders ? at least for the time being ? by giving a detailed report on Jammu and Kashmir and the Northeast at this evening?s Left-United Progressive Alliance coordination committee meeting. 

 Patil claimed the situation has improved in the Northeast and Manipur and Assam were returning to normal at the two-hour meeting at 7, Race Course Road. 

 ?The home minister gave a detailed account of the security measures taken in Jammu and Kashmir and Northeast, the efforts made by him and his ministry to engage various sections of the people in negotiations and the measures to restore confidence among people,? said Union finance minister P. Chidambaram. 

 CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury said the Left parties raised the issue of terrorist camps in Bangladesh. ?The government told us that it was aware of what was happening and will discuss the issue with the Bangladesh government,? he added. 

 Apart from the leaders of the four Left parties, Patil, Chidambaram, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi, defence minister Pranab Mukherjee and Congress MP Ahmed Patel were among those present. 

 The Left parties had expressed dissatisfaction with the handling of the situation in Jammu and Kashmir and the Northeast and, in a meeting last evening, had decided to focus on these two areas. 

 Patil today claimed the Left is not unhappy with his measures in the troubled areas. ?People who have been reported as criticising my handling have been calling me up saying that they have not said all that,? he told reporters.

 The other contentious issue of raising limits on foreign investment in certain sectors did not figure in the discussions. 

 The government has given the Left a detailed response to its note on FDI in telecommunications and insurance. ?We have to study the note first and then give our comments,? said Yechury. 

 ?The issue will be discussed at the next coordination committee meeting,? said Chidambaram. ?The Left has also demanded a review of the Electricity Act, 2003,? he added. 

 The Left has made it clear it will oppose raising the FDI cap in telecom and insurance though it has agreed to give in on the aviation sector.

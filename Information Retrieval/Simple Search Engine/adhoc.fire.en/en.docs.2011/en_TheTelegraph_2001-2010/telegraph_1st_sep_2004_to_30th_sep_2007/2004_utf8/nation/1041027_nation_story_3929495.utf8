 Jaswant refutes Powell claim 

 PRANAY SHARMA 

 New Delhi, Oct. 26: Former foreign minister Jaswant Singh, often criticised for being ?too close? to the US, today came up with a scathing attack on Washington over its claims that it helped ?safeguard India?s national interests?. 

 The senior BJP leader picked on secretary of state Colin Powell, who claimed in a recent interview that the US played a key role in averting war between India and Pakistan two years ago. 

 Short of calling Powell a liar, Singh did everything to disprove his claims of brokering the latest peace process. 

 ?The way he has gone about claiming credit is a total concoction and a matter of imagination, the way he conjured up biological weapons in Iraq,? Singh told a news conference at the BJP headquarters this afternoon.

 Singh?s claim of pursuing an independent foreign policy is corroborated by Strobe Talbott, a former deputy secretary of state. Talbott said in his book, Engaging India, Delhi ignored US pressure in achieving its foreign policy objectives, both in dealing with Pakistan and Washington.

 The BJP?s decision to field Singh, who played a key role in rebuilding Indo-US relations after the 1998 nuclear tests, appears deliberate.

 The party seems to be signalling that when India?s security interests are involved, it is willing to take on anybody, including the US.

 ?We stopped the Indians and Pakistanis from going to war, at least helped them stop themselves from going to war two years ago,? Powell told the Chicago Tribune on October 18. He claimed to have called the two Prime Ministers and hinted he even told them what to say to each other. 

 ?I did not know that apart from running the US foreign policy, the state department had also become a telephone exchange and an elocution instructor,? Singh said, making it clear Powell never spoke to Atal Bihari Vajpayee on phone when he was Prime Minister.

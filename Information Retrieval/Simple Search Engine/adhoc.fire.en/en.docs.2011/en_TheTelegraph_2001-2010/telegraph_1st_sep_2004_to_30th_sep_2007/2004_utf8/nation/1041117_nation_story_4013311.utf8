 Ally push to woo Paswan

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 16: The BJP is persisting with its efforts to woo Ram Vilas Paswan for the Bihar elections despite his rebuff. But there is a caveat: the party will stay out of the picture and ally Janata Dal (United) will have to take the initiative.

 After a meeting of the Bihar leaders with BJP president L.K. Advani, state in-charge Arun Jaitley said: ?We do not want a division of the anti-Rashtriya Janata Dal votes. We want to ensure that no party cuts into this block of votes.?

 Jaitley, who was present at the meeting, said it was ?not possible? for the BJP to speak to Paswan after his assertion that he will not do business with the Hindutva forces. ?We will only talk to the Dal (U). But we don?t want to give statements which will break the anti-Laloo forces.?

 The Lok Janshakti leader had turned down the National Democratic Alliance?s appeal to him to join forces with it against Laloo Prasad Yadav?s RJD.

 The BJP has decided that after December 2, the Bihar leaders will go on a parivartan yatra across the state. Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje had gone on a similar yatra before the Assembly polls and BJP strategists later acknowledged this was the key in building a momentum against the then ruling Congress.

 While Jaitley did not reveal who would lead the yatra, sources said Sushil Modi, C.P. Thakur and Shatrughan Sinha would be in the frontline. As the combine is not expected to project a chief ministerial candidate, the presence of the trio ? a backward caste Bania, a Bhumihar and a Kayastha ?would symbolise the caste coalition the alliance hopes to forge to take on Laloo Prasad?s Muslim-Yadav combine.

 The BJP is expected to intensify its campaign after chhat puja and involve 20 senior leaders. The exercise will include a public meeting in Patna?s Gandhi Maidan on December 2. While BJP chief LK Advani has agreed to participate, A.B. Vajpayee?s presence was ?subject to his convenience? as Parliament will be in session from December 1.

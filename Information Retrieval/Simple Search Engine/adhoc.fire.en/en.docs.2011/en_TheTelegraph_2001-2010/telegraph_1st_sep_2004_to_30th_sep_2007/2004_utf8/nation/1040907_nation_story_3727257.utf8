 Left sees red over education barb

 New Delhi, Sept. 7: Manmohan Singh wants education to be free of all political patronage of the Right or of the Left. But the Left, clearly unhappy at being clubbed with the Right, is openly criticising the Prime Ministers remarks at Saturdays media conference.

 We did not like the Prime Ministers remarks against Left fundamentalism, said senior CPI leader D. Raja. 

 Historian Irfan Habib was more acerbic. The Prime Minister should explain what he means by Left fundamentalism. He is really playing into the BJPs hands by making such a remark, said Habib.

 I am opposed to fundamentalism of all kinds fundamentalism of the Right or of the Left, Singh had said when asked about the changes in the National Council of Educational Research and Trainings history textbooks.

 The Prime Minister did not rush to extend unqualified support to human resource development minister Arjun Singhs detoxification mission, but chose his words carefully while replying to a question on the recent upheavals in education.

 I do not want our education to be prisoner of any ideology or be the exclusive domain of the bureaucracy. We are in favour of maximum autonomy which shows concern for integrity and truth, he said.

 The Prime Minister should avoid making statements like this. It seems he has half accepted the RSS case, said Habib at a press conference organised by Sahmat. What is there in Bipan Chandras book that would attract the Left fundamentalist label? Then Gandhi and Nehru are also Left fundamentalists and the Prime Minister will be left alone, he said.

 Left leaders have commended Arjun Singh for his prompt detoxification measures. They may even seek legal advice to become a party to the case the RSS has slapped on the human resource development minister for his remarks against the organisations involvement in Mahatma Gandhis killing. We are studying the legal notice, said a Left leader.

 Just when the Left, cut up over information and broadcasting minister Jaipal Reddys lack of proactive measures in his ministry, were feeling happy about cleansing the human resource development ministry, Singh sounded a note of caution.

 However, the Left was not impressed. Mridula Mukherjee, a Left-wing historian at Jawaharlal Nehru University wanted more radical detoxification. She wanted to go a step further than the ministry and remove the present set of history textbooks from this academic session. But the education councils executive committee rejected her suggestion.

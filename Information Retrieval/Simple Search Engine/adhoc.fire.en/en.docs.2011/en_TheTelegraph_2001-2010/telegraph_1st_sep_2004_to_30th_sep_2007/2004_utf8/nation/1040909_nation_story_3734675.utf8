 Subhas cites funds crunch 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 8: The drainpipes are leaking; the plaster is peeling off the walls; the sunshades have blown off; the electrical wires hang dangerously.

 Welcome to Asia?s largest stadium, Yuba Bharati Krirangan, a study in neglect. Even if the lights had not gone off during the India-Japan tie, it was a disaster waiting to happen.

 ?Today it may have been a mechanical fault at the substation that has embarrassed the government, but it could very well have been the sorry condition of the stadium that could have similarly shamed the administration,? said state sports minister Subhas Chakraborty.

 ?This stadium was meant to be the pride of the country. Instead it has become a total shame,? Chakraborty added. ?The structure is there, but the infrastructure has to be put in place and maintained. For this money is required ? but this has not been forthcoming.?

 Officials said Rs 3 crore was required annually to maintain the stadium, but only a third of it was made available, that too, not on time. ?Besides, there are 182 employees at the stadium and their salaries have to be paid,? said Swapan Chakraborty, joint secretary in the state sports department. ?Actually, according to international standards, there should be 300 people employed to look after the stadium.?

 No major repairs have been undertaken in the last five years. Only patchwork repairs are carried out on a ?need-to-do? basis, officials pointed out. ?We had estimated that Rs 2 crore was needed immediately to carry out repairs in view of the fact that such an important international match was to be played here, but we got a paltry Rs 22 lakh for the purpose,? the joint secretary said.

 Stadium authorities pointed out that in order to raise funds for the stadium?s maintenance, Friends of the Stadium, a local club which has the blessings of the sports minister, had been organising fund-raising programmes at the stadium. 

 Additionally, the stadium premises are let out for weddings and other social functions.

 ?We have worked out a Rs 5-crore scheme for renovating the stadium thoroughly and have appealed to all Rajya Sabha MPs from the state as well as the local MP to provide money from their local area development fund to carry out the necessary repairs,? the sports minister said.

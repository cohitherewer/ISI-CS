 Hubli, Sept. 10: Waving a Tricolour, Uma Bharti today set out on her 3,000-km flag march from Hubli to Jallianwala Bagh and attacked the Congress as a ?communal? party.

 The yatra flag-off brought the city to a halt, with barricades and checkpoints all over and scores of armed policemen hovering around. About 2,000 policemen were posted around the venue ? the statue of Rani Chennamma, a widowed ruler of Kittur province who took on the might of the East India Company during the freedom movement.

 ?I want to ask (chief minister) Dharam Singh: Is it a crime to hoist the Indian flag? If it is not, why such security measures today? Why these barricades, policemen and the fear psychosis? If we can?t hoist the Indian flag in our own country, where will we hoist it? In Italy?? Uma said.

Leader of the Opposition L.K. Advani launched the 

16-day yatra by handing Uma a Tricolour only a few feet from the Idgah Maidan, 

the disputed site where she had hoisted a flag 10 years ago during a curfew, leading 

to several deaths in rioting.

 Uma had to step down as Madhya Pradesh chief minister after warrants were issued in the case recently and she was taken into custody. She was released after the court accepted an earlier petition of the Karnataka government seeking to withdraw the charges.

 The tiranga yatra has been launched in protest against her arrest, with an eye on the Assembly elections in neighbouring Maharashtra ? the state where Uma will spend six of the yatra?s 16 days ? next month. She has already been chosen the party?s star campaigner for the polls.

 About 5,000 partymen cheered Uma at the flag-off. The convoy?s first stop will be Dharwad, 22 km from here. She will travel through north Karnataka (two days), Maharashtra (six days), Madhya Pradesh (three days), Uttar Pradesh (two days), Haryana (two days) and Punjab (one day). The yatra ends at Jallianwala Bagh on September 25.

The BJP leader claimed that her yatra was not planned 

with the Maharashtra elections in mind. ?This yatra is not for election, not for 

vote bank, this is for the honour of the Tricolour and to uphold the spirit of 

nationalism,? she said. Her mini-bus had portraits of Veer Savarkar, Bhagat Singh, 

Chandrashekhar Azad, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, A.B. Vajpayee and L.K. Advani.

 For Advani, the start of the yatra evoked memories of the one he undertook in 1990. ?This is a historic occasion, but Dharam Singh is trying to cause a sense of panic among Muslims about the national flag with so many policemen around this place,? he said.

 The case against Uma was reopened by Dharam Singh?s government to divert attention from the BJP?s protests against ?tainted ministers?, Advani alleged. ?He will regret this decision,? he warned.

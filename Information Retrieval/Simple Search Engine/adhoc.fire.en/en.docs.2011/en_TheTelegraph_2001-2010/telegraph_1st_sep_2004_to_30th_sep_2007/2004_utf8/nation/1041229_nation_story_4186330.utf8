 Scam minister quits

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Thiruvananthapuram, Dec. 28: Sex scam-tainted Kerala industry minister P.K. Kunhalikutty has decided to step down, a little over two months after fresh charges of sexual exploitation were levelled against him.

 The Muslim League?s state chief, Panakkad Mohammed Ali Shihab Thangal, read out the resignation letter at a news conference in Malappuram this afternoon in Kunhalikutty?s presence.

 But Shihab Thangal called a meeting of the League?s state committee in Kozhikode on January 1 to discuss the resignation without straightaway passing it on to chief minister Oommen Chandy.

 Kunhalikutty says in the letter he cannot hold the dual posts of League general secretary and minister; so he wants to quit the ministry and continue his efforts to strengthen the party.

 He has resolved to work for realising the party?s campaign goals based on the Justice K.K. Narendran Commission report, which had pointed out inadequate representation for the backward classes in government jobs.

 The League?s state committee meeting is seen as a careful strategy by Kunhalikutty himself to mitigate the embarrassment of his resignation, coming as it does after weeks of often violent agitations by the Opposition and increasing demands from the ruling United Democratic Front leaders for his ouster from the cabinet.

 This is perhaps the lowest point in the 30-year political career of Kunhalikutty, who was a high profile minister in three successive UDF ministries led by K. Karunakaran, A.K. Antony and now Chandy.

 The resignation did not come as a total surprise as there were rumours that Kunhalikutty was waiting for his son?s marriage to be over on December 26.

 CPM state secretary Pinarayi Vijayan welcomed the decision, claiming that the Opposition?s pressure had forced the minister to quit.

 Govt unhappy with TN report

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 17: The Union home ministry today received a formal report on the arrest of the Kanchi seer from the Tamil Nadu government but made no secret of its disappointment with the contents of the document.

 The Centre had expected the report ? the first since the arrest of the seer from Andhra Pradesh last week ? to shed some light on the compelling circumstances that obliged the state government to make the arrest on Diwali eve, rather than wait a few days till after the festival.

 Sources said the home ministry had not taken kindly to the Tamil Nadu government arresting the seer in Andhra Pradesh a day before most parts of the country celebrate Diwali and a few days before Id. 

 The Tamil Nadu government had earlier informally conveyed to the Centre that the police had conducted a thorough probe into the murder and had gone ahead with the arrest only after collecting irrefutable evidence linking the seer to the crime, including phone transcripts and documentary evidence. The Centre had expected details of this evidence in the report.

 Instead, sources said a large part of the four-page document received after Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayalalithaa made a statement in the Assembly dealt with the sequence of events just before and after the arrest, the seer?s journey to Kancheepuram and his production before the court.

 Emphasising the state had neither taken the Centre into confidence at the time of the arrest nor later ? there were fears ?it could have had repercussions across the country? and sparked communal clashes ? a central government official termed the report as ?very ordinary? and as giving less information than was already in the public domain.

 The report does not give any details of the evidence against the pontiff of Kanchi mutt, the investigation process that resulted in the decision to make the arrest or the precise role of the seer in the murder conspiracy, he said.

 The state government report ? that appeared to be on the same lines as Jayalalithaa?s statement in the Assembly ? also referred to a previous case relating to an attack on a mutt associate in 2002.

 Investigations in that case led the police to point fingers at the seer but the police had failed to come across concrete evidence.

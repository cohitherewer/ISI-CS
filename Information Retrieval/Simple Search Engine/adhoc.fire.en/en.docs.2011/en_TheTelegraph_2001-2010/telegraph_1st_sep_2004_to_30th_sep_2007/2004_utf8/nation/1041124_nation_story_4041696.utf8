 Terror alert shuts mission

 OUR BUREAU AND AGENCIES

 Nov. 23: The US closed its consular office and the American Center in Mumbai and tightened security around its mission in Delhi today following intelligence inputs that they could be targets of possible terrorist attacks.

 A US embassy official also warned Americans in India to maintain ?a high level of vigilance?.

 A statement posted on the US embassy website suggested the decision to close the Mumbai consulate was a precaution in view of the threat. 

 ?Based on information received by the US government, terrorists may be planning attacks on US interests in India in the near future. Although not specific, the information suggests that an attack could be aimed at US interests in the cities of New Delhi or Mumbai,? the statement said.

 This is the third time in recent months that the US has taken such steps in the country. US missions in India were last shut down on security grounds on 12 September. In early August, the US embassy in Delhi shut three of its offices after American intelligence agencies warned of an attack on the basis of interrogation of al Qaida members caught in Pakistan.

 A consulate spokesperson in Mumbai said employees who reported for duty were told early in the day to go home. The closure forced organisers to move a dinner to celebrate the Thanksgiving holiday from the consulate to a hotel several miles away.

 The embassy in Delhi, however, functioned normally and so did the other consulates in Calcutta and Chennai, though under stepped-up security. Indications suggest the closure of the consulate and the American Center was only for a day and they would re-open tomorrow.

 A Union home ministry official in Delhi said police in both cities have stepped up security around US installations.

 ?We definitely do not want an incident in Mumbai (Bombay) and have taken adequate security measures,? joint commissioner of police Ahmad Javed said.

 Jaijit Singh, DCP with the anti-terrorist squad of the Maharashtra government, said Mumbai police have deployed ?additional forces, wherever necessary.

 A ?warden notice? from the US government warned Americans that clubs, restaurants, schools or hotels where foreigners congregate were likely targets.

 ?The (US diplomatic) message encourages American citizens in Mumbai consular areas to maintain a high level of vigilance and to take appropriate steps to increase security,? embassy spokesman David Kennedy said. 

 ?We take the threat seriously enough,? he added.

 US officials said though American citizens in Delhi and Mumbai were cautioned, Washington has not issued a countrywide travel advisory. This means though it has information about possible attacks on its assets, the level of threat is not that high.

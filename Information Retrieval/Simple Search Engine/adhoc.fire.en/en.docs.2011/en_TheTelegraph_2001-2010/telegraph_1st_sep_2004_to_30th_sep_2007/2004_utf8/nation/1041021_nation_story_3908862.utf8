 Doctor sent back to US jail

 Silicon Valley, Oct. 20 (PTI): An Indian doctor, who was recently released after serving a prison term of two years for ?stealing? his children from his estranged wife seven years ago, has been sentenced again.

 The US district court in Massachusetts today sent Fazal Raheman, 48, to jail again for one year and a day for violating its order to assist in the return of his children.

 Raheman, who is originally from Nagpur, was convicted of international parental kidnapping and wire tapping in March 2002. He was sentenced to three years? imprisonment to be followed by three years of supervised release.

 The doctor was released in February this year and had been serving his term of supervised release at a residence in Blackstone, Massachusetts, until he was taken into custody last month.

 Among the terms of his original supervised release was the requirement that Raheman return his two children ? now 12 and eight years old ? to their mother.

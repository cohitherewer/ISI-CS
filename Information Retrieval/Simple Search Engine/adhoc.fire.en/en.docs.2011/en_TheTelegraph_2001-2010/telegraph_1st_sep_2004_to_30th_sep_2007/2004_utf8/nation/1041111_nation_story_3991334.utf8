 Import bar on China globes

 New Delhi (PTI): Delhi High Court has 

 banned the import and marketing of Chinese-made globes that 

 incorrectly depict Jammu and Kashmir. 

 Directing the government not to permit the circulation of such globes in the market, a bench of Chief Justice B.C. Patel and Justice B.D. Ahmed pulled up the customs department for not taking up the issue seriously despite its order.

 ?After the order made by this court, the consignments were received at Chennai and customs officials allowed marketing of toy globes depicting the Indian territory incorrectly,? the bench said. ?We direct the customs officials not to permit the import of toy globes depicting the territory of India incorrectly,? it added.

 The bench referred to a CBI report, which pointed out that the globes depicting Indian territory incorrectly were being manufactured by four firms in China and Hong Kong.

 Government counsel Siddharth Mridul informed the court that action has been initiated against customs officials who were negligent in examining the consignment of toy globes.

 The order followed a public interest litigation filed by advocate S.P. Gautam, which pointed out that the globes showed Jammu and Kashmir in a different colour from the rest of India, creating the impression that the state was an ?independent? country. The court disposed of the PIL, directing the Centre to pay Rs 10,000 to the petitioner.

 Student in RAW murder net

 Jammu (PTI): A 14-year-old boy has been 

 arrested for triggering a blast at a shop that killed a 

 top officer of the Research and Analysis Wing in Rajouri 

 district in 2003.

 Army personnel raided a hideout and arrested Mohammad Ishfaq, a student of Class IX in the government high school at Manjankote in Rajouri district, on Tuesday evening, official sources said. He was handed over to police and a case has been registered against him.

 The boy allegedly planted a powerful improvised explosive device fitted in a VCR at a shoe shop on October 21, 2003, at the behest of Jaish-e-Mohammad militants to eliminate RAW assistant commissioner Avinash Dutta. Four others were also killed.

 Ishfaq was initially pressurised by Jaish militants Abu Asma and Umar Mansoor to go to Pakistan for arms training, the sources said, quoting the boy. On his refusal, Ishfaq was persuaded to plant the explosive at the shop that Dutta used to visit every evening. 

 After reaching Rajouri, he straightway went to the shop and left the bag with the VCR there, they said.

 Court rejects brigadier plea

 New Delhi (PTI): Delhi High Court has 

 dismissed a petition by Brigadier Iqbal Singh challenging 

 the general court martial (GCM) proceeding against him in 

 connection with the Tehelka expose.

 Vacating the stay on the GCM proceedings, a bench of Justices M.K. Sharma and Gita Mittal said his plea was ?misconceived and premature?. Singh must exhaust the remedies available to him under the Army Act before approaching the court, it said.

 Amte discharged

 Nagpur (PTI): Social activist Baba Amte, 

 who was admitted to a nursing home on Monday, was discharged 

 on Wednesday, sources said. ?Baba has recovered fully and 

 was allowed to go home today,? a family member said. 

 Rains claim 29

 Chennai (PTI): Heavy rains that lashed 

 several parts of Tamil Nadu, especially the Cauvery delta, 

 have claimed 29 lives in 10 days, chief minister Jayalalithaa 

 said on Wednesday. The deaths were mostly due to wall collapse, 

 drowning and electrocution, she said in a statement while 

 announcing a solatium of Rs 50,000 to the kin of each of 

 the victims from the chief minister?s relief fund.

 Judeo case

 New Delhi (PTI): Delhi High Court has 

 dismissed a petition filed by Bhupendra Singh Patel alias 

 Rahul seeking quashing of an FIR registered against him 

 by the CBI in the cash-on-camera scam involving former Union 

 minister Dilip Singh Judeo. It said there was no merit in 

 the plea for quashing the FIR at this stage. Rahul had conducted 

 a sting operation in which Judeo was shown as accepting 

 a bribe.

 Bakery trial

 Ahmedabad (PTI): Zahira Sheikh, the prime 

 witness in the Best Bakery case, met National Commission 

 for Women chairperson Poornima Advani on Wednesday. Advani 

 described Zahira as a ?suffering? woman needing protection. 

 Bombay High Court deferred to November 23 the anticipatory 

 bail petition of social worker Teesta Setalvad after directing 

 the Gujarat government to declare its stand.

 If senior citizens of the Ajmer division in Rajasthan need any help from police, they need not go to police stations anymore. Policemen will visit them on being called over phone, IG Ashim Chatterjee said during the legal service week.

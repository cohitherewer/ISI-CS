 Pak to test-fire nuclear missile

 Islamabad (AP): Pakistan will test-fire 

 a missile with nuclear capability within the next few days 

 despite a thaw in relations with India, a senior government 

 official and a scientist said on Sunday.

 ?Yes, everything is in place for Ghazanvi?s test,? the official, who refused to be named, said of Pakistan?s new medium-range missile.

 A scientist confirmed the planned test, but refused to say when it would take place.

 It would be Pakistan?s second major missile test in the past six weeks, following the October 12 launch of the Ghauri V missile, which has a range of 1,500 km.

 The official said Islamabad has informed neighbouring countries, including India, about the planned test.

 Also on Sunday, deputy foreign minister Makhdum Khusro Bukhtyar said in a statement that Islamabad ?wants to sustain the dialogue process with India and make it result-oriented so that all outstanding issues between Pakistan and India can be resolved?.

 Bukhtyar said resolution of the Kashmir issue would be the biggest confidence-building measure, ?which can rid our region of tension and usher in an era of stability and co-operation?.

 School under suicide glare

 Kochi (PTI): The parents of a 12-year-old 

 schoolboy, who committed suicide after failing in a test, 

 have filed complaints with the Kerala director-general of 

 police and the Kochi police commissioner holding the school 

 authorities responsible for the suicide.

 Neeraj Hari Nair, a Class VII 

 student of a public school here, had ended his life on Thursday 

 after he failed in an English test, police said.

 In the complaint, the boy?s father alleged that his son was caned by the teacher concerned and was made to stand outside the class for four periods. Unable to withstand this humiliation, he ended his life by hanging himself in the toilet at home when his parents were away.

 The school authorities have denied 

 that the child was punished, saying they were against corporal 

 punishment and were prepared to face any kind of probe regarding 

 the incident.

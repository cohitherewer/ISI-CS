The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 NDA slams light session

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 10: After failing to put the government on the mat over the price rise, the Kanchi seer?s arrest or internal security, the National Democratic Alliance pulled out a new weapon from its arsenal.

 The alliance today accused the government of not packing enough legislative business into the winter session, one of the shortest ever.

 Parliamentary affairs minister Ghulam Nabi Azad?s only counter was that it was the NDA?s disruption of the first three sittings of Parliament since the May elections that had brought matters to such a pass. But Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee ticked off the government for mismanagement of legislative business.

 Last week, the Rajya Sabha was twice adjourned two hours before schedule for lack of an agenda. But it was only today that the BJP raised the matter when its Lok Sabha deputy leader V.K. Malhotra mentioned during zero hour that there was no legislative business listed for the afternoon session barring the introduction of two bills which ought to take a few minutes. ?We are spending crores of rupees on Parliament but no business is taking place,? he said.

 The BJP got unexpected support from the Samajwadi Party whose MP, Ramjilal Suman, said whether the Opposition cooperates or not, it is the government?s job to set out the legislative agenda. ?We hope this will not be repeated,? Suman said.

 Azad intervened to tell the BJP benches: ?You wasted crores of rupees earlier. Now you have no issue to raise. Go and find an issue and come back to the House. It is total bankruptcy on your part.?

 The Speaker interjected and told the government to ensure sufficient legislative business is transacted in the House. ?The matter needs to be looked into,? he said.

 NDA sources said they brought up Parliament?s ?underfunctioning? with Azad during meetings of the Lok Sabha business advisory committee and asked why this had happened.

 ?There was no convincing answer from the minister. He said the introduction and passage of bills was a cumbersome process, the concerned ministries had to be chased, the bills cleared by the cabinet and sent to the standing committees and the President for his approval. But all this is well known,? a Telugu Desam Party MP said.

 The MP said when the NDA was in power, the spadework was done between sessions and enough bills and other agenda placed in the ?basket? so that there were no pauses when a session was on.

 Asked to respond, Azad said: ?Their charges deserve to be dismissed with contempt.? He added: ?The BJP has two faces. Inside meetings, they urge the government to give more time to them to raise issues. On the floor? they talk of legislative agenda.?

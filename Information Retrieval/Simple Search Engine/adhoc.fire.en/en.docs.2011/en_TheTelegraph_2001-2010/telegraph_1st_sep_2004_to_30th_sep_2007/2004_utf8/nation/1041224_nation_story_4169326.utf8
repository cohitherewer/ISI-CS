 Shield sought after video

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Ahmedabad, Dec. 23: Vadodara municipal councillor Nisar Bapu, who had facilitated Tehelka?s probe into the alleged bribery of Best Bakery case witness Zahira Seikh, has sought police protection after allegedly receiving threat calls from BJP MLA Madhu Srivastava?s cousin, Chandrakant Bhathu.

 Bapu alleged, in his application to Vadodara police commissioner Sudhir Sinha, that ?some Opposition leaders?? are threatening him and his life is in danger.

 Sinha confirmed that he had received the ?application? but said it was very vague. The police official said he had, therefore, sent it to a police inspector to find out if there is a threat to the councillor?s life.

 Bapu claims that Bhathu has called him at least four times, threatening him of dire consequences and saying he would frame the councillor in false cases.

 ?They can do anything. They are unscrupulous people and can go to any extent.? That is why, the councillor said, he had not stepped out of his house today.

 Bhathu, who suspects that Bapu has planted a spy camera in his office, said he called him up after the Tehelka expose was aired but denies having threatened him. ?Yes, I called him up on his mobile as I wanted to know why he did it to me. We were like friends, though he belongs to the Nationalist Congress Party,?? he said.

 Bhathu calls himself a saviour ? he says he saved Zahira?s life.

 ?Nisar Bapu is just a goon who was jailed for murder during riots. How can one threaten him? If he was really threatened, as he claims, he would have not been able to visit the municipal corporation after his acquittal in a murder case,? said Bhathu.

 DNA lifeline for animals 

 AYSWARIA VENUGOPAL

 New Delhi, Sept. 1: A cutting-edge technology that helps track criminals will now help save animals, birds and fish on the brink of extinction or even bring them back from the dead.

 The Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) in Hyderabad is leading the effort to set up the Laboratory for Conservation of Endangered Species, which will use DNA fingerprinting and associated biotechnological methods for the purpose.

 Lending his expertise will be centre director Lalji Singh, who holds a patent for an indigenous DNA fingerprinting process.

 The laboratory will be built on five acres near the Nehru Zoological Park in Hyderabad in association with the Central Zoo Authority under the Union environment and forests ministry, the biotechnology department and the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research.

 Expected to give animals like lions, leopards and tigers a new lease on life and preserve their genetic diversity, the laboratory has been designed as a national programme for the conservation and propagation of endangered species.

 Extinction threatens 11 per cent of birds, 25 per cent of mammals and 34 per cent of fish species.

 The new laboratory will have gene banks which could prove to be the last resort for assisted reproduction in animals or even cloning when all else fails.

 Scientists of the molecular biology centre, however, are not waiting for the completion of the laboratory that will take five years to build at an estimated Rs 746.78 lakh.

 They have already developed a semen bank of tigers, lions and leopards and plan to set up egg, embryo and cell banks that may be the only solution when partners are behaviourally incompatible.

 They have also standardised protocol for assisted reproduction in wild animals under circumstances that do not support mating and natural conception.

 The laboratory may also make Jurassic Park-like resurrections of extinct and endangered species possible by cloning their frozen genetic material and reproductive cells of closely related species to be used as a surrogate mother.

 The project is jointly funded by the CSIR, the biotechnology department and the Central Zoo Authority, which has already released half its share of Rs 360 lakh. 

 The Centre will release its contribution over five years.

 The scientists have already been provided a mobile van that includes cryopreservation and sonography facilities and a computerised sperm motility analyser to collect samples from habitats and attend to animals for immediate aid.

 DNA fingerprinting will be used to monitor genetic variations in a species and establish family lineage that would contribute towards planned in-house breeding and, maybe, wildlife parks.

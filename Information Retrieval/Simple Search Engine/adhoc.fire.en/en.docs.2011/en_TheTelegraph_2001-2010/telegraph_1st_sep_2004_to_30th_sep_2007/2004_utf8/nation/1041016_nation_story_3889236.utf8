 India plans terror talk with China

 PRANAY SHARMA

 New Delhi, Oct. 15: The presence of terrorist groups on Pakistani soil and its impact on the region is likely to come up during Chinese vice-premier Tang Jia Xuan?s talks with Delhi next week.

 Tang will hold a series of meetings on bilateral relations on October 19-20 with key Indian leaders, including Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and foreign minister Natwar Singh. 

 His arrival here in the wake of the killing of a Chinese engineer by terrorists in Pakistan has given both sides a chance to focus on the menace.

 Tang will be flying to Delhi on Monday from Islamabad where he is slated to hold talks on issues of common concern to China and Pakistan.

 On the face of it, China may not be too keen to discuss counter-terrorism with Delhi, especially if the focus is on Pakistan. 

 Beijing is aware of Islamabad?s sensitivity on the issue and is likely to scotch any move that could give a wrong impression.

 But the killing of the Chinese engineer has provided Delhi the chance to raise the issue with Tang. 

 China believes Pervez Musharraf has put his neck on the block in his fight against terrorism, particularly terrorist groups operating from Pakistani soil.

 India has been trying to tell the world that despite Musharraf joining the global terror war, the Pakistani establishment is not serious about stopping the export of terror into Kashmir. 

 Delhi believes it has turned off the terror tap but not done anything to dismantle the structure. This will be the argument India will place before Tang.

 The Chinese vice-premier?s visit is basically to assure India there was no attempt on Beijing?s part to slow down the pace in bilateral relations. 

 Since Tang is of the rank of state councillor, his presence could send the required signals.

 The visit comes a few days after that of Ismail Tiliwaldi, governor of China?s Xinjiang province, and could be an indication that both countries are trying to broad-base relations.

 Tang, who is head of the Chinese foreign ministry establishment and comes higher in the pecking order than foreign minister Li Zhao Xing, is likely to assess the mood of the government on bilateral relations. 

 He is also likely to sound out Delhi on the boundary dispute for which both sides have already appointed special representatives.

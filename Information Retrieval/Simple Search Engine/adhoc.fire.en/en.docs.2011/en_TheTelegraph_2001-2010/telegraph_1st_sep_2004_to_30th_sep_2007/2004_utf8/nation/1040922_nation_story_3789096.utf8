 Edusat working properly

 Chennai: The Indian Space Research Organisation 

 (Isro) has said that India?s first satellite dedicated to 

 education, ?Edusat?, launched successfully on Monday by 

 a Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV-F01) from 

 the Satish Dhawan Space Centre at Sriharikota, about 100 

 km north of Chennai, is doing well, reports our special 

 correspondent.

 ?All the systems on board the satellite are functioning normally,? Isro said in a press release issued on Tuesday. The ?solar panels? of the satellite were deployed soon after its injection into orbit, Isro said.

 t 7:48 am on Tuesday, the first orbit manoeuvre of Edusat was successfully carried out by commanding the satellite from the ?Master Control Facility? at Hassan in Karnataka, the release said.

 With this operation, the satellite?s perigee (nearest point from the earth) has been raised from 181 km, at the time of its injection into a geosynchronous transfer orbit on Monday evening, to 8800 km, the release said. The apogee (the farthest point from earth) remained at 36,000 km, Isro said. The satellite ?is now orbiting the earth once every 13 hours and 25 minutes?, the ISRO release added.

 Siachen major objects to jury

 Jodhpur (PTI): Major Surinder Singh, 

 charged with enacting fake killings on the Siachen glacier, 

 raised objections on Tuesday against the general court martial 

 (GCM) jury soon after it began proceedings against him in 

 the case and demanded a probe by an independent agency. 

 ?I object to the entire jury, including its presiding officer, because all its members were under the influence of the convening authority ? GOC of desert core G.S. Jamwal ? as all of them have been selected from desert core itself,? Singh told the general court martial on the opening day of the trial. 

?Army chief Gen. N.C. Vij wants to punish me, which 

is evident from the fact that I have been made an accused in the case whereas 

I was the complainant,? he alleged. ?I have no expectation of justice from the 

army. Therefore, the case should be probed by an independent agency like CBI or 

by a retired judge or officials of navy or air force,? he said. 

 Referring to a 1982 Supreme Court observation 

 in a judgment on constitution of general court martial, 

 Singh said: ?Since members of the jury in GCM depended on 

 the convening authority for their future promotions and 

 postings, they could not go against wishes of higher officers 

 and, therefore, could not act freely.?

 Judge gets more security

 Pune (PTI): Security for S.M. Shembole, 

 judge of the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime (MCOCA) 

 special court, who is hearing the multi-crore fake stamp 

 paper case, has been tightened following a claim by prime 

 accused Abdul Karim Telgi?s advocate Abdul Rehman, official 

 sources said.

 Rehman claimed last week that a conspiracy was being hatched to kill Shembole at the behest of former Mumbai police commissioner R.S. Sharma, an accused in the case.

 Red tide recedes

 Kochi (PTI): Kerala fisheries 

 minister Dominic Presentation said on Tuesday that the ?red 

 tide? phenomenon and the stench in the coastal areas of 

 the Kollam and Thiruvananthapuram districts had almost receded. 

 The minister told reporters that fish from these areas was 

 now fit for consumption.

 Cop gets bail

 Mumbai (PTI): A local court on Tuesday 

 granted interim anticipatory bail till September 29 to assistant 

 police inspector Sachin Vaze, charged with killing Ghatkopar 

 blast accused Khwaja Yunus. Sessions judge U.D. Malavankar 

 restrained police from arresting Vaze, who had filed an 

 anticipatory bail following the filing of a fresh chargesheet 

 in the case on September 16.

 Poems by convict

 Chennai (PTI): A prisoner in the death 

 row in Salem Central Jail has released an anthology of poems 

 penned by him in prison during the past few years. The anthology, 

 ?Sirai Muthukkal 3450? (pearls from prison) contains his 

 poems on various national and international issues like 

 the Iraq war and personalities like LTTE chief Prabhakaran 

 and US President George Bush.

 Dowry killing

 Muzaffarnagar (PTI): A 35-year-old 

 woman was allegedly burnt alive at Sainpur village in the 

 district by her in-laws for not bringing enough dowry, police 

 said here on Tuesday. The charred body of the woman was 

 recovered from her house on Monday.

Maria of Virginia in the US met Sheikh Azhar Quereshi, 

a jawan of Madhya Pradesh Special Armed Forces, on the Net over a year ago and

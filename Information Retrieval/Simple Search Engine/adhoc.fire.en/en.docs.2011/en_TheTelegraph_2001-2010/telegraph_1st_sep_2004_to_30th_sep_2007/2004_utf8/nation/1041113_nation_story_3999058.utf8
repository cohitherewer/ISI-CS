 Doctor shot for not paying up

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Nov. 12: Suspected extortionists struck this evening at a private clinic here, killing eminent physician Naval Kishore Agrawal and his assistant Arvind Kumar. 

 Sources said the doctor had just shut his clinic in Rajendra Nagar under Kadamkuan police station around 6 pm and was about to leave for home to celebrate Diwali with his family, when four persons approached him. 

 Pretending that one of them was unwell and needed immediate medical attention, they requested the doctor to reopen his clinic. 

 Once inside the clinic, the criminals whipped out firearms and shot the doctor and his assistant just as they were attending to the ?patient?. 

 Sources said the doctor was shot in his head several times from close range. 

 After executing the killings, the assailants drove away on two motorcycles. The victims were declared brought dead at Patna Medical College and Hospital.

 Police officials, who went to the spot, said the doctor appeared to have been targeted because he had refused to shell out extortion money. 

 They also suspect the involvement of notorious criminal Bindu Singh, who is lodged in Bhagalpur jail, in the murder. 

 Last week, Patna had witnessed a similar killing allegedly on the orders of Singh. Two employees of Patna?s Dr Zakir Hussain Institute were shot on the campus on November 6. The institute director, Uttam Kumar Singh, too, was said to have received extortion threats from the same criminal two months ago.

 Senior superintendent of police, Patna, N.H. Khan said raids were on at several places to nab the culprits. ?We have reason to suspect the involvement of Bindu Singh in this killing. However, it is yet to be confirmed,? he said.

 Justice voice for women

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 11: Chief Justice R.C. Lahoti today called for ?gender justice? from the judiciary and advised judges across the country to ?strike a balance? in their approach to ensure that women who seek justice are treated as equals.

 ?Please make efforts to render quick, speedy, cheaper and effective justice to women victims,? he said at the first meeting of chief justices of all high courts on women?s empowerment organised by the National Commission for Women (NCW).

 ?Treat women with dignity and honour and inculcate confidence in them by your conduct, behaviour and ideology whenever they come to you as victims or seekers of justice,? Lahoti told the judges who had gathered to deliberate on legislative and judicial measures to empower women.

 ?Judges should be informed of the historical and cultural background in which the women have lived over the ages and understand their feelings and have regard for their needs as a class,? he said. At the same time, he added, the issue of gender injustice should not be perceived as a ?war between the two sexes?.

 Lahoti said judges, starting from those in the lowest courts to the country?s highest forum of justice, should be careful to see that no gender bias occurs in courtrooms. A ?message should clearly go that any behaviour unbecoming of the dignity of women shall not be tolerated by the court?, he added.

 ?Any comment, gesture or other action on the part of anyone in or around the courtroom which would be detrimental to the confidence of the women is to be curbed with a heavy hand.?

 Lahoti stressed that examination and cross-examination of women witnesses, especially in rape and sexual harassment cases, must be conducted by the court itself or under the direct supervision of the presiding judge. 

 ?Crime against women ought to be dealt with on a priority basis so as to decide it finally at an early date lest the delay should defeat the justice,? he said.

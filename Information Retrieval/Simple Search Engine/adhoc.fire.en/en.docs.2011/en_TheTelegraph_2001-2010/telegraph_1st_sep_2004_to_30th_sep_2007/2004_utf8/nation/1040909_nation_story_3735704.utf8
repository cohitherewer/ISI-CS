 Truth cover in contempt cases

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 8: The United Progressive Alliance government today decided to reintroduce a bill to amend the contempt of courts act to make truth a ground for defence in contempt cases.

 The bill, introduced last year by the previous BJP-led government, could not be passed as the 13th Lok Sabha was dissolved and elections declared.

 A note issued after the Union cabinet met this morning said the Contempt of Courts Act (Amendment) Bill, 2003, ?will enable the courts to permit a defence of justification by truth? if the ?bona fides of the plea? are found to be satisfactory and in ?public interest?.

 As of now, truth is not a defence in contempt cases. But after the amendment, a person accused of casting aspersions on the judiciary can bring in witnesses ? so far not allowed in contempt cases ? to substantiate his allegations.

 In a recent case over allegations that some Karnataka High Court judges were involved in a sex scandal, it was argued during contempt proceedings that ?truth is not a defence? in such cases. Some high court lawyers initiated the contempt proceedings after several publications came out with reports that the judges were involved.

 On appeal, the Supreme Court last year, then headed by Chief Justice V.. Khare, orally observed that ?truth is a defence?. But Justice Khare also said ?nobody comes forward with the truth?.

 A high-powered committee of the apex court that probed the matter recommended closing of the case because of ?lack of evidence?. But the contempt proceedings as well as the suit for damages by a judge are still pending adjudication.

 The Union cabinet also approved a parliamentary committee?s recommendations regarding the Payment of Wages (Amendment) Bill, 2002. The cabinet meeting, chaired by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, decided to move necessary amendments to the bill, an official spokesperson said.

 One of the recommendations of the standing committee on labour and welfare is to increase the wage ceiling mentioned in the payment of wages act from Rs 1,600 a month to Rs 6,500. Several trade unions have demanded abolishing of the ceiling or at least enhancing it on the basis of the consumer price index.

 The cabinet?s approval means a person with an income of up to Rs 6,500 a month will come under the purview of the act, which protects employees from exploitation.

 At present, only those workers whose wages are less than Rs 1,600 a month and who are working in a factory or railway administration come under the purview of the act.

 Another recommendation of the committee is to hold the principal employer responsible for payment of wages if the contractor, under whom the employees work, ?disappeared?. The principal employer is responsible for payment of wages in cases under the Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act.

 The standing committee report has also called for ?adequate steps? to prevent ?unauthorised deduction from wages?, but it is not yet known what these steps will be. The committee called for ?more stringent? penalties to have ?deterrent effect? on those who violate labour laws. The report noted that the government proposes to enhance the penal provisions five times so as to make them more realistic.

 The amendment bill to remove ambiguities and enhance the wage ceiling was introduced in the Rajya Sabha on May 16, 2002, and was referred to the committee on labour and welfare.

 3 Ps top PM?s Laos agenda 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 26: An agreement on peace, progress and shared prosperity will be the highlight of the third India-Asean (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) summit in Laos next week.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh flies out with a high-powered Indian delegation to the Laos capital, Vientiane, on Sunday.

 The agreement will set the tone for future India-Asean ties. Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia, Vietnam, the Philippines, Cambodia, Brunei, Laos, Myanmar and Malaysia make up the 10-member trade bloc.

 ?The Asean-India business council at the summit will conclude a partnership document which will set out the future direction on relations between India and the Asean bloc. While trade and economic co-operation will be at the heart of the agreement, the fight against terrorism will also be an important element of the document,? Rajiv Sikri, secretary (east), said this evening.

 While working towards strengthening economic and other ties, India and Asean are aware of the need to jointly combat terrorism. At the Bali summit last year, the two sides signed a declaration on cooperation in combating international terrorism and other trans-national crimes.

 But economic activity remains at the core of India?s relations with its southeastern neighbours. It was with a view to increasing trade and business that then Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao launched his look-east policy in 1991.

 Rao believed Delhi needed to look towards the Asian tigers and Japan to bring prosperity and business to the Northeast. Atal Bihari Vajpayee?s government built on this, deepening ties with Asean.

 Trade between India and Asean last year was around $13 billion and is expected to grow by at least 10 per cent this year, Sikri said. The aim is to reach the $30-billion mark by 2007.

 Sikri added that the partnership pact will chart out a collective vision for political, economic, science and technology, health, culture and other key areas.

 During his three-day visit to Vientiane, Singh is expected to meet Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, Japan?s Junichiro Koizumi and other leaders on the sidelines of the summit. The dates for the meeting will be finalised only when the Prime Minister reaches Laos. Singh returns home on Tuesday.

 Foreign ministers of Asean countries will meet on summit-eve for the first time. K. Natwar Singh has already left for Vientiane ahead of the Prime Minister and national security adviser J.N. Dixit.

 ?As the Indo-Asean economic relation is quite broad and diversified, we are looking at the operationalisation of comprehensive economic cooperation agreement shortly,? Sikri said, adding that special programmes are being chalked out for Cambodia, Myanmar, Laos and Vietnam.

 Under the cooperation framework with Myanmar and Thailand, India is committed to developing a highway linking the three countries and providing vital road links to the rest of the Asean region, Sikri said.

 A Delhi-Hanoi rail link is still on the drawing board; it will augment the connectivity further once it is operational.

 Sikri said India would help set up entrepreneurship development centres in Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam. The first centre will be inaugurated by Natwar Singh at Vientiane tomorrow and the other three will be completed by early next year.

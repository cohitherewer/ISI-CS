 Legislator death

 Lucknow, Sept. 7: In a twist to the murder of ruling party legislator Ajit Singh, one of the slain leaders security guards, Sanjay Trivedi, today claimed that the bullets that killed Singh had been fired from his carbine by accident when he was dancing at Ajits birthday party at a hotel in Unnao, reports our special correspondent.

 The state government has ordered a probe into the incident by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID).

 Sanjay, who had been absconding since Sunday, surrendered to the police this morning and handed over the carbine. According to officers of the Unnao district police investigating the case, four of the legislators security guards were examined on an initial suspicion that an insider might have killed Ajit. However, Sanjay, the fifth security guard, did not appear for interrogation.

 Sanjay told the police that he had fired 40 rounds from his carbine while rejoicing at a birthday party and some of the shots that had accidentally gone off hit Ajit and a 12-year-old assistant of the hotels electrician. Both died later in hospital. 

 The bullets recovered from the body during post mortem were found to have matched the serial numbers of those in the carbine of the security guard, a police officer said, adding that 40 rounds of cartridges were missing from the carbine.

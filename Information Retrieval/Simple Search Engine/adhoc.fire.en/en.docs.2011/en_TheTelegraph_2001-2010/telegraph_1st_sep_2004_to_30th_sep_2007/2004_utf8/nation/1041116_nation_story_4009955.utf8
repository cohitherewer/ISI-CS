 Rs 1567 cr for Bhopal victim kin 

 Bhopal (PTI): Distribution of fresh compensation 

 to the tune of Rs 1,567 crore to victims of the Bhopal gas 

 tragedy began here on Monday with notices being served in 

 127 cases of deaths caused by the gas leak from the Union 

 Carbide factory in December, 1984.

 The notices were served in two wards of Shivaji Nagar. Around 325 beneficiaries are believed to have appeared in these cases wherein pro-rata compensation was distributed in accordance with the Supreme Court?s directives, said an additional welfare commissioner. The families of the deceased would get around Rs 1 lakh each, which would be distributed equally among the dependants.

 The apex court had directed distribution of compensation to over 5.72 lakh victims under different categories on a pro-rata basis by April 15, 2005.

 Around 15,004 cases of death were yet to be heard, said an assistant professor at National Law Institute University, claiming that the varsity was asked to offer assistance to victims in maintaining proper documentation for the compensation.

 Doctors issue bandh threat

 New Delhi (PTI): The Indian Medical Association 

 on Monday threatened to call a nationwide bandh of medical 

 institutions on November 25 if the Bihar government failed 

 to arrest those involved in the murder of a surgeon, N.K. 

 Agarwal, and secure the release of Dr Nagendra Prashad who 

 was kidnapped on October 28.

 ?We will be organising protest rallies from November 21 to 24 in support of the agitating Bihar doctors all over the country. But if the issue is not solved to the satisfaction of medical community, we will be forced to call for a nationwide bandh on November 25,? said the association?s secretary-general, Dr Vinay Agarwal.

 Health services across Bihar remained paralysed for the third day on Monday as nearly 20,000 private and government doctors stayed away from work protesting the killing. The surgeon and his assistant, Arvind, were killed on November 12.

 ?The situation in Bihar is very pathetic and we are genuinely concerned,? Dr Agarwal said. ?We have prepared a list of 35 doctors kidnapped and five murdered in the last 13 years in Bihar. The actual number may be much more,? he said.

 AIDS rule for motor licence

 Promotion caveat

 New Delhi (PTI): Air Vice-Marshals T.S. 

 Chhatwal and Harish Masand have filed caveats in the Supreme 

 Court pre-empting the air force?s move to obtain stay of 

 a Delhi High Court order for reconsidering denial of promotion 

 as air marshals. The court had on November 8 ordered the 

 setting up of a fresh promotion board within four weeks 

 to reconsider their cases along with those of four air marshals 

 whose promotions it quashed.

 Chandimandir, Nov. 28: The chief of army staff designate, Lt Gen. Joginder Jaswant Singh, today promised a more humane force and said Pakistan should match India?s confidence-building measures.

 ?The withdrawal of some of the troops is a step in the right direction but Pakistan should also keep its word (of controlling violence in Kashmir),? Singh said at an informal chat with reporters at the Western Command headquarters here near Chandigarh.

 He added troops withdrawal would be reviewed in stages and decisions taken accordingly. ?If they (Pakistan) are not going to keep their word, then we will have to keep our options clearly defined on what to do next. This is also what our Prime Minister has stated.?

 Singh, however, said: ?The CBMs initiated by the government are a step in the right direction. Troops withdrawal is a good CBM.?

 Terming the army ?responsible? and ?accountable?, the lieutenant general hinted that the force under him would deal sternly with ?aberrations?.

 ?I can assure you that we are a very professional army. We take action wherever there are aberrations. We act not only responsibly but are also accountable. We are there to protect,? he said, referring to reports of human rights violations in insurgency-hit areas.

 On the challenges facing the army, Singh said any army on a modernisation drive faces an onerous task. ?We are now in an era of a shift from being manpower-intensive to firepower-intensive. Till our borders are resolved, we will continue to face challenges. But we are second to none in combating insurgencies.?

 His anguish over the turmoil in Kashmir was evident when he narrated the capture of two youths trained in Pakistan ? one had got married two days earlier.

 ?I ordered his and his friend?s release when his parents came to me with his wife and an assurance that he had not participated in any terrorist operation. I told the people not to allow their sons to pick up weapons as that meant signing their death warrants.?

 Singh said he would visit the Valley and interact with the people and then ?decide on the steps to be initiated in the Valley. We are full of restraint in an invisible war. We are a people?s army. We may be fighting a messy war but we are not butchers?.

 On the induction of militants in defence forces, Singh felt there was a need to restore them to the mainstream.

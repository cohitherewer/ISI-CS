 Laloo clean track whip

 Patna, Oct. 3 (PTI): Laloo Prasad Yadav today said people found littering railway premises and relieving themselves on the tracks would be penalised. 

 The railway minister, after laying the foundation stone of six-road-over railway bridge here, said policemen would be asked to keep an eye on people throwing waste and defecating on the tracks and a penalty would be imposed on them. ?No compromise would be made on security and cleanliness,? he said. 

 Ticketless travellers were also warned. Frequent checks would be carried out to catch free trippers, Laloo Prasad said. The railway is trying to enhance its revenue without increasing passenger fare and freight charges, he said. 

 The days of the mafia who try to corner railway contractors are over and such elements would be dealt with severely, the minister said. 

 Laloo Prasad assured that arrangements would be made for those being displaced or bearing loss because of the construction of the bridge.

 The minister has also ordered repair of tracks damaged by floods in north Bihar on a war footing.

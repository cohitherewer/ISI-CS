 Army plots troops cutback roadmap

 SUJAN DUTTA

 New Delhi, Nov. 12: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh?s instructions to reduce troops in Jammu and Kashmir will result in a thinning of military presence both along the Line of Control and in the internal security grid, highly placed defence sources said here today.

 But the number of personnel to be withdrawn from Kashmir is yet to be worked out. Estimates on the number of army troops in Kashmir vary from 3.5 lakh to 6 lakh, with the outer limit being a claim made by Pakistani sources and activists who say India has a poor human rights track record.

 A more reasonable estimate is that the army?s roughly 11 battalions along the LoC, four Rashtriya Rifles divisions and forces of the 15 (Valley) and 16 (Jammu) Corps make for about 4 lakh troops.

 ?The Prime Minister has directed withdrawal of troops. The details of how much reduction (would be made) in which sector are being worked out,? defence minister Pranab Mukherjee said here today. Commanders at the army headquarters and in the state will prepare a roadmap and schedule of withdrawal.

 ?All these matters would be decided at the operational level and not at the policy level,? he said.

 Mukherjee said the ?infrastructure? of militants in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir continues to exist.

 Along the LoC, the army is likely to reduce the number of troops manning snowbound heights in Gurez and Kargil but not withdraw them altogether. 

 In the Kargil sector, particularly, the thinning of troops is a sensitive matter because the 1999 war was the result of withdrawing troops from the heights in winters.

 The main objective of the announcement to reduce troops is to demonstrate the United Progressive Alliance government?s sincerity in implementing confidence-building measures. The Prime Minister had given an indication early in his tenure that he would like to reduce troops in Kashmir by the end of the year.

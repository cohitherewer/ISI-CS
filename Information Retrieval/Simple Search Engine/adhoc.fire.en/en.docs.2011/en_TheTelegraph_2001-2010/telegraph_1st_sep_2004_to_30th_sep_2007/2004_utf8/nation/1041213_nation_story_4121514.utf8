 Pranab sticks to his guns

 Bhubaneswar, Dec. 12 (PTI): Brushing aside the US argument that its proposed supply of hi-tech weaponry to Pakistan was to tackle terrorist groups, India today said the sale would affect the Indo-Pak peace process.

 ?The argument given is that the weapons are being given to contain terrorist groups like al Qaida and the Taliban, but it does not stand,? defence minister Pranab Mukherjee said here after dedicating a martyrs? memorial.

 India, Mukherjee said, had told US defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld during his recent visit to New Delhi that ?supplying weapons like F-16 fighter aircraft, lethal missile systems and naval reconnaissance aircraft to Pakistan at this juncture would affect the peace process?.

 ?Nobody uses F-16 planes and other weapons meant for big wars to fight terrorists,? the minister said.

 ?Rumsfeld, during his recent visit to New Delhi, had met me, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and external affairs minister K. Natwar Singh and all of us impressed upon him that the weapons should not be given to Pakistan at this juncture,? Mukherjee said.

 On the possibility of US mediation to solve the Kashmir dispute, the minister said there was ?no question of such a thing?.

 ?Our stated position has been that it is essentially a bilateral issue to be resolved bilaterally. There is no scope for any third-party mediation,? he added.

 Asked whether the reduction of troops in Jammu and Kashmir had affected the morale of the armed forces, Mukherjee replied: ?Not at all.?

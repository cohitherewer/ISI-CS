 Hope for ocean giant

 Dwarka, Dec. 10 (Reuters): A few weeks ago, the crew of an Indian fishing boat in the Arabian Sea thought they had the biggest catch of their lives. A 40-feet unsuspecting whale shark had entered their nets on a still night.

 But instead of killing the creature, known as the gentle ocean giant, the captain called the boat owner, who promptly told him to let it go. ?I may have lost a lot of money. But I?m happy that I could play a role in saving the protected fish,? Kamlesh Chamadia, the boat owner said.

 Two years ago, Chamadia, like hundreds of other fishermen along the Saurashtra coast in Gujarat, would have had little hesitation in killing whale sharks (Rhincodon typus). But a lively campaign by a wildlife group and a popular religious leader have helped reduce the killing of the world?s largest fish, which migrates to the Indian coast from faraway Africa to breed.

 Despite a government ban in 2001, fishermen slaughter at least 1,000 whale sharks every year wildlife activists say. ?We have been relentlessly campaigning in the Saurashtra coast to protect whale sharks. Fishermen would have certainly continued to kill them had we not launched the campaign,? said Dhiresh Joshi, Wildlife Trust of India?s campaign manager.

 The group has been hoisting life-size inflatables of the whale shark along the Gujarat coast, holding poster shows and putting up banners urging the protection.

 There have been no reports of whale shark hunting in the past year since the start of the campaign, also backed by the International Fund for Animal Welfare and two business firms, activists say.

 The sharks, mostly found in tropical temperate waters, feed on plankton and are protected by several countries.

 The whale shark protection campaign in Gujarat has also got a religious flavour to it after Murari Bapu, a popular Hindu preacher, agreed to be its brand ambassador.

 Bapu, who holds his audience spell-bound with narration of stories from the Ramayana, likens the migration of the whale shark to pregnant daughters coming to their parental home for delivery.

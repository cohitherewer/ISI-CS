 Hope for ESPN, hard task for Zee

 SUBHAJIT BANERJEE 

 Sept. 9: As the cricket 

 rights battle took a fresh twist with Bombay High Court 

 ?suggesting? the option of depositing fresh bids with the 

 Board of Control for Cricket in India, it was reprieve for 

 ESPN-STAR Sports and back to brainstorming for Zee Network. 

 The matter being in court, neither party would go on record with their reaction. But the mood in the ESPN camp was upbeat and reflected hope and vindication. Zee saw the court decision as what it was ? a suggestion. 

 Zee officials indicated that a board meeting to decide whether to go for fresh bids or carry on the legal battle is likely to take place on Monday. The company would have to inform the Bombay Stock Exchange for conducting the meeting, an official added. 

 Zee shares fell by 5 per cent (Rs 8) to Rs 151 after the court decision. 

 In case of fresh bids, neither party is willing to talk about the kind of figures they would look at. But ESPN has claimed repeatedly that had it known the BCCI would ask Zee to match its revised bid of $308 million, they would have quoted a figure beyond the reach of Zee. 

 Both parties are not pleased with the BCCI readily agreeing to the fresh bid proposal. From ESPN?s point of view, it goes to show there may have been loopholes in the process, while for Zee, it is an odd move by the cricket body, showing a lack of confidence in its decision and tender process. 

 Zee, however, made it clear that the developments will not affect its sports channel plan. ?We are going ahead with the launch and scouting for partners as planned,? said a Zee spokesperson. 

 Losing the rights, analysts said, would make it difficult for the entertainment network to fill an entire channel with cricket without India and content related to other sports. 

 ESPN maintains they have other prime sports rights to fall back on and would aggressively try to acquire more. ?We have around 132 days of cricket featuring India in six countries and around 660 days of total international cricketing action,? a spokesperson said. 

 Rights still up for grabs include the 2006 Asian Games where cricket makes its debut and the ICC Super Series in Australia next year, where the number one test side (Australia) takes on the Rest of the World XI in ODIs and ?test? matches.

 The sports bouquet has plans for promoting other sports aggressively, including football and hockey. Preparations are on for a Premier Hockey League among the cities of India, on the lines of English Premier League football. 

 Evaluation twist

 Both ESPN and Zee claim the BCCI had given the impression that accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) would tabulate the bid amounts and also evaluate whether the bidders fulfilled the requirements.

 But PwC said it had made it clear to the BCCI that ?it was beyond our scope to do any kind of technical evaluation of the candidates?. 

 The incident raises the question as to how the bids were evaluated and by whom.

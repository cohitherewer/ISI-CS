 School drops badges

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Ahmedabad, Oct. 28: Eight years after the practice was started, a school in a town 25 km from Godhra has removed separate badges for its Hindu and Muslim students following a showcause notice from the district authorities.

 The controversy, however, broke only early this week when two trustees of the SJ Dave High School in Shehra highlighted the emblems on the uniforms ? one with Goddess Saraswati and another with a star.

 ?It was a practice of convenience and not compulsion. Some vested interests are trying to harm peace, which was not disturbed here even after the Godhra carnage,? school board vice-president Iqbal Pocha said.

 Panchmahal district collector Dinesh Brahmbhatt said: ?The controversy appears to be a fallout of local political rivalry.? He did not elaborate.

 Last week, the Shiv Sena had set up an office in Shehra.

 The collector, who ordered to ?discontinue this discriminatory practice?, admitted that residents had never complained. The school of 714 students, 150 Muslim, has been asked why its state grant should not be suspended.

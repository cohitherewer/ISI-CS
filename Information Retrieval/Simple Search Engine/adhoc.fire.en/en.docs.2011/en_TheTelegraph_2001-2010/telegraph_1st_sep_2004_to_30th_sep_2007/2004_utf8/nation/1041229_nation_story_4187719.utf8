 Diving lesson saves life

 Swedish Carl Michael Bergman, in Thailand on vacation, said diving lessons, a 40th-birthday present from his wife, saved his life when waves hit their resort at Khao Lak.

He was out at sea at the time, but instructors, uneasy 

at the strange behaviour of the water, began heading back. His one-and-a-half-year 

old son Hannes (in Reuters picture above), now hospitalised with pneumonia, was 

found alone in a hotel room. His three-year-old son, Nils, was safe on higher 

ground.

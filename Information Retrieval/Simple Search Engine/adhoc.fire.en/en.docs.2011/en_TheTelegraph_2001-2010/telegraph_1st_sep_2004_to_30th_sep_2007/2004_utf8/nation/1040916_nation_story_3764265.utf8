 BCCI notice

 Bhopal, Sept. 15: A court today issued notices to the Board of Control for Cricket in India and two other organisations on a petition alleging contempt of court when Jagmohan Dalmiya was named the cricketing body?s patron-in-chief.

 Acting upon an application by Yogesh Khattar ? a Bhopal Divisional Cricket Association member ? civil judge P.K. Nigam asked the BCCI, Madhya Pradesh Cricket Association and the Bhopal association to respond to the notice by October 5.

 The court, in an order on September 10, had restrained the BCCI from taking any decision on the elevation of Dalmiya that went against its rules.

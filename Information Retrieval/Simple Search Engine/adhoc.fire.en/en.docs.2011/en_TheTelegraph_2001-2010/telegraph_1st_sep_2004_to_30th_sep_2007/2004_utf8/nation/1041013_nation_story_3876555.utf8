 Mirage crash in Gwalior drill

 Gwalior (PTI): A Mirage-2000 trainer aircraft crashed near Gwalior on Tuesday during a joint exercise with Singapore Air Force. The two pilots ejected safely.

 The mishap occurred around 11.30 am when the fighter was returning to the Gwalior air base after detecting some technical snag soon after take-off, an IAF spokesperson said. The pilots, on realising that the aircraft would not be able to make it to the airfield, decided to eject, he said. The plane subsequently crashed four nautical miles short of the base. The two pilots are safe and nobody was injured on the ground.

 Earlier, additional district magistrate R.K. Jain said preliminary information showed that the wheel of the Mirage fell off immediately after it took off from the Maharajpur air base.

 The spokesperson said the joint exercise, Ankush, was unaffected by the mishap. A court of inquiry has been ordered to ascertain the cause of the crash. 

 This is the second Mirage crash at the Gwalior air force base in less than three weeks, and the fifth since the frontline French-made aircraft was inducted into the Indian Air Force in the late 1980s. The Mirage, however, has had a good flying record as most crashes have involved Russian MiGs, the mainstay of the air force.

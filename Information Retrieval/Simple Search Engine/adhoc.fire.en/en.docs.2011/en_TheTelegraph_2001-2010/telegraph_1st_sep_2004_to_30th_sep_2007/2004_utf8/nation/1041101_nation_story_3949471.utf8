The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Brawl before Bangla talks

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT AND AGENCIES 

 Morshed Khan 

 New Delhi, Oct. 31: Bangladeshi foreign minister Morshed Khan arrives here tonight amid tension on the border and a tussle over the Northeast rebels in the country. 

 Khan has claimed he is travelling to invite Prime Minister Manmohan Singh for the Saarc summit Bangladesh will host in early January. 

 He is scheduled to hold talks tomorrow with Singh, foreign minister K. Natwar Singh and national security adviser J.. Dixit. 

 The stage was set for a high-strung meeting, with the Indian high commission in Dhaka today terming as ?baseless and incorrect? reports that the Border Security Force was trying to push in Bengali-speaking Indian Muslims into Bangladesh. 

 Bullets fired by the Bangladesh Rifles, allegedly to foil an attempt by the BSF to push in illegal immigrants across the border, peppered a village in Jalpaiguri district this week. 

 ?The question of forcing Indian citizens into the territory of any other nation by any Indian authority does not arise,? the high commission statement said. 

 The comments have come after Dhaka gave an aide-memoire to deputy high commissioner S. Chakravarty two days ago, expressing concern over the alleged push-in bid. 

 India stressed that peaceful management of the border is important for maintaining cordial ties and ?better and effective guarding of the border is necessary to prevent trafficking and cross-border movement without proper and legal documents?. 

 ?India has always made every effort to maintain peace on the border and implement the letter and spirit of the agreed 1991 guidelines for border management,? the statement said.

 Delhi added that the BSF had offered a joint verification of the people, but the BDR refused. It had earlier proposed a ?coordinated and simultaneous? patrolling of the 4,000-odd km border, but Dhaka has been sitting on it for two months. 

 Apart from this, the issue of Northeast rebels is likely to be raised by the Indian leadership ? as at several past engagements ? during talks with Khan. Dhaka?s response to Delhi?s persistent prodding on security-related issues has been varied, from outright denial to vague assurances of action.

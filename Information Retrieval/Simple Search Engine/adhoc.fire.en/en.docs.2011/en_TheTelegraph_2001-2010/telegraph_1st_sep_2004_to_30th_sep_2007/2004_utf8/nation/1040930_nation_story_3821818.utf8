 Sandeep hits zoo hurdle

 AYSWARIA VENUGOPAL

 New Delhi, Sept. 29: Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit may have won elections on an environment platform but her government?s move to shift an abattoir close to the zoo on her son?s instance is posing a threat to the animals there.

 The Supreme Court had ordered the Idgah abattoir to be shifted out of its present location in the walled city to Ghazipur. Last July it gave the Delhi government six months to do so. However, East Delhi MP Sandeep Dikshit, under whose constituency the area falls, has tried to persuade the government to look for alternative sites.

 The Sheila Dikshit regime settled on a site near the National Zoological Park and the Millennium Park where a Japanese peace stupa is being built. But even if the animals did not protest, the director of the National Zoological Park did, demanding that the government review the plan which posed health, environment and security hazards

 Sandeep, a first-time MP, will also have to contend with the ministries of defence and environment over the proposed new site which is not far from Pragati Maidan and India Gate: the zoo falls under the Union environment and forests ministry while the defence ministry inspects the site each year before the Republic Day parade.

 In a letter to Delhi chief secretary S. Reghunathan, zoological park director B.S. Bonal yesterday said the planned move to a site near the Delhi zoo would pose a danger to the animals there as they would be vulnerable to air-borne diseases originating from the abattoir. 

 ?The foul smell emitted by the waste, dead and decay will spoil the environment of the zoo. The slaughterhouse will attract large number of birds which will be disease carriers as well as flying hazards,? Bonal added. 

 The zoo director said the slaughterhouse would not only be a health and environmental hazard but also a security problem. ?The ministry of defence visits the zoo area every year for the Republic Day parade to check the density of flying birds so as to secure the aircraft during the flypast,? he said.

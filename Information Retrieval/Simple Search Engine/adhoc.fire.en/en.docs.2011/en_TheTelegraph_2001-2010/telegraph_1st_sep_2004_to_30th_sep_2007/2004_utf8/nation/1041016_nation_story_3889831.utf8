The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Intolerance slur on Centre 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 15: The BJP today hit out at the United Progressive Alliance, accusing it of ?ideological intolerance?.

 The party cited four examples to substantiate its charge: 

 Prasar Bharati?s objections 

 to the reference to the Emergency in a documentary on Jai 

 Prakash Narayan made by Prakash Jha

 The removal of Anupam Kher 

 as Censor Board chairman 

 A Bihar government directive 

 banning cartoons of politicians at Durga Puja pandals

 A ?gag order? issued by 

 the Punjab government on a newspaper that published reports 

 of corruption charges against the son of Punjab chief minister 

 Amarinder Singh.

 BJP spokesperson Arun Jaitley stopped short of demanding the resignation of information and broadcasting minister S. Jaipal Reddy. 

 ?The I amp; B ministry is headed by Reddy who, like some of us, spent Emergency in jail. Therefore, for him it is a moral dilemma that his ministry and the Prasar Bharati board under his ministry should indulge in such censorship of an independent filmmaker. Reddy is known as a man who responds to his conscience. It is for him to choose between his sense of history and his present company.?

 Asked if Reddy should quit, Jaitley declined to reply. 

 BJP sources claimed to have ?information? that Prasar Bharati was being pressured by railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav to hold up Jha?s film. ?A year ago, when he was making the film, Jha had also interviewed Laloo Prasad as he was active in JP?s Sarvodaya movement. We believe Laloo Prasad then went hammer and tongs against the Congress for enforcing a state of Emergency. Now as a senior minister in a Congress-led government, he will be embarrassed if his comments are shown,? a source said.

 Another reason the railway minister is ?upset? with Jha, the sources added, is the alleged uncharitable references to his family members in the film, Ganga Jal, which gave a critical account of Bihar police. 

 On Kher being shown the door, Jaitley said: ?This government is a puppet in the hands of those (the Left) who extract a price for this support by preaching intolerance. The likes of Charu Mazumdar are accepted by the government while Kher is rejected.? 

 As for the alleged ban on political cartoons in Puja pandals, Jaitley said: ?(For the) first time after Emergency, this has happened. It is not good for the country and democracy. Intolerant regimes do not want people to laugh at them.?

 The BJP leader described Amarinder?s ?gag order? on a newspaper as ?a dangerous sign for the future?. 

 The paper had carried reports alleging that the chief minister?s son was involved in transaction of foreign currency for a project in which the state government was involved.

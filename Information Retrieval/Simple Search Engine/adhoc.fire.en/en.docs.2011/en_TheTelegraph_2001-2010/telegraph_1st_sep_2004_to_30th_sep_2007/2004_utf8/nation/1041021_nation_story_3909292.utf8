 Onion takes essential knock

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 20: Onion, the humble bulb that knocked the daylights out of the BJP-run government in Delhi five years ago, is back in the news.

 Yesterday, the government took it off the list of essential commodities ? a seemingly innocuous decision but one that will benefit the country?s onion farmers, especially in Maharashtra where the Congress-Nationalist Congress Party has just returned to power.

 Maharashtra accounts for almost 30 per cent of the country?s onion production and 80-85 per cent of onion exports.

 Five years ago, onion prices had touched an astronomical Rs 80 a kg in Delhi largely because of hoarding by traders, nixing the BJP?s chances of coming back to power.

 Today, onion prices are down to modest levels and production has risen sharply this year, prompting farmers to clamour for a relaxation in trading restrictions that are attached to essential commodities.

 The Union cabinet, which decided to delete onion from the essential commodities list, noted that the production and availability of onions during the last five years was ?by and large satisfactory?.

 The move essentially implies removal of all trade restrictions on onion to ensure free supply as well as remunerative prices to farmers by allowing them to export.

 ?The removal of unnecessary restrictions and relaxation of controls on onion will give fair returns to growers, promote consumer interest and free trade,? an official statement said.

 The government said: ?Onion is a perishable commodity and storage problems coupled with controls or interventions have often led to distress sale by farmers in several states at very low prices, causing them economic hardship.?

 The decision will ensure that onions no longer attract controls like licensing of dealers, limits on stock and restriction on movement.

 The free trade and movement will enable farmers to get best prices for their produce, achieve price stability and ensure availability in deficit areas.

 Of the total onion production in the state, 10-15 per cent is in the kharif season, 30-40 per cent in the late kharif and 50-60 per cent in the rabi or the summer season.

 The produce of the summer season can be stored for up to 56 months but not that of the late kharif, which is why today?s decision will help onion farmers.

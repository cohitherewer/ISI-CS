 Cong, Left bicker over banking

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Chidambaram: Acting firm

 New Delhi, Dec. 20: The Congress high command has told party ministers not to punch the Left too hard on policy differences, keeping in mind the ?sensitive? nature of the coalition.

 This afternoon turned out to be an exception as Union finance minister P. Chidambaram ? Left?s bete noire ? decided to raise his voice to counter CPI MP Gurudas Dasgupta?s charges during a discussion on banking sector reforms.

 ?The honourable member has given expression to his personal views,? and not to that of his party, Chidambaram said. ?We will continue on the path of reforms.?

 Dasgupta, he said, is not a member of the United Progressive Alliance-Left co-ordination committee. ?We have discussed the issue at a UPA-Left co-ordination committee meeting. I have personal knowledge of the matter.?

 The CPI MP retorted: ?I also have personal knowledge. I do not have to be a member of the co-ordination committee to know what my party thinks.? Chidambaram repeated that he could not know about the meeting as he was not its member. Dasgupta reiterated he knew his party?s position.

 At the last co-ordination committee meeting, Chidambaram had proposed increasing foreign direct investment in the private banking sector to 74 per cent and the Left had not opposed.

 The CPI leader earlier set an aggressive pitch to the discussion by virtually warning Chidambaram that the UPA government was surviving on the Left?s support. ?I request the finance minister not to incur displeasure of the Left,? he said. ?You know what happened to the last government when it displeased the people.?

 Shabby post office to one-stop shop

 M. RAJENDRAN

 New Delhi, Sept. 26: That dowdy post office near your home is readying for a makeover.

 The department of post has drawn up elaborate plans to modernise the postal set-up. Post offices across the country will be transformed into one-stop shops that will provide postal and telecom services and also supply stationery, confectionery and beverages.

 Soon, automatic teller machines will be installed at the post offices not only to provide cash but also stamps and other postal services.

 The finance ministry has already cleared Rs 836 crore for the modernisation of the postal department, which will go on till 2007.

 The postal department is also undergoing a sartorial revolution with officials set to don blue uniforms from next month: the original men in blue (the Indian cricket team) may be having dog days right now, but the humble postman has something to be proud of. Moreover, general post offices across the country that have heritage value will be transformed into swanky offices from inside to take on the look of a multinational company.

 The postal department has joined hands with the Archaeological Survey of India and the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage to identify the heritage buildings housing the post offices in Calcutta, Chennai, Mumbai, and Delhi. Intach and ASI will then undertake revamping of the internal structures without changing the exterior of the buildings.

 A Rs 50-crore initiative to train 276,200 personnel will be taken up by the postal department during the next three years to improve the approach of employees to customers.

 The personnel will be trained at the Postal Staff College in Ghaziabad and at six postal training centres in Guwahati, Madurai, Darbhanga, Vadodara, Saharanpur and Mysore.

 Early this month, finance minister P. Chidambaram had asked the department to emulate the courier company DHL that is not owned by a private entrepreneur but by the government of Germany.

 These initiatives are part of the year-long celebrations that the department has planned to commemorate its 150 years of existence. On October 1, 1854, the Indian Post Office was recognised as a separate organisation and placed under the unitary control of the director-general of the post office.

 The postal department has proposed to the communications ministry that modernisation initiatives are necessary to meet challenges when private players are allowed in the sector. Communications minister Dayanidhi Maran has given his approval to the proposals.

 The celebrations will be kicked off by President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will unveil a stamp on October 3. Sources in the postal department said about Rs 5 crore are likely to be spent during the year on various events to be organised across the country.

 ?We have been neglected as a department not only by the government but also by the media and have never been recognised for the service we offer,? said a senior official of the department. ?It is not fair to compare our service with courier services. If the public feels the service has deteriorated, it is because we work with the same tools to meet the increased demands while private courier companies get the latest technology and training.?

 India has the world?s largest postal network with more than 1.6 lakh post offices. When India attained Independence, there were about 25,000 post offices. On an average, a post office serves 21.13 sq. km and a population of 6,500.

 ?While ATM machines vending postal services may take another 2-3 years, we hope the modernisation effort will help the department meet the challenges from courier companies,? said the official.

 Activist takes on coal mafia 

 KAY BENEDICT

 New Delhi, Oct. 24: Civil rights activist Ramashray Singh of Dhanbad has taken on a mafia that has held sway over successive central and state governments.

 The crusader has, in his letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, alleged corruption in Bharat Coking Coal Limited, Dhanbad, and Fertiliser Corporation of India, Sindri, to the tune of Rs 20,000 crore over the last two decades.

 The activist has urged the Prime Minister to order a CBI probe into the ?huge scandal in the matter of supplies of coal to PSUs in Dhanbad and Sindri?. He has also requested Singh to order a CBI probe into the reasons behind the Sindri unit?s closure.

 The activist had also petitioned President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, whose secretariat forwarded his memo to the secretary to the ministry of chemicals and fertilisers ?for appropriate action? in March.

 On July 3, he wrote to Union home minister Shivraj Patil and two days later to Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee and Congress president Sonia Gandhi.

 Singh had also submitted a memo to former Jharkhand chief minister Babulal Marandi with some documents seeking a CBI probe.

 The activist is not the first to highlight this. Several people, including many Left politicians, have brought this to the notice of successive Prime Ministers ? from P.V. Narasimha Rao and Atal Bihari Vajpayee to Manmohan Singh ? to no avail.

 On August 19, the president of the People?s Union for Civil Liberties, K.G. Kannabiran, had written to the Prime Minister highlighting the scam. CPM parliamentarian Hannan Mollah had in a letter to Singh on September 3 said: ?Many MPs, including myself, Somnath Chatterjee, Basudev Acharya and others, wrote several letters to your predecessors on the subject but no previous government could unearth or check the corruption.?

 On September 7, CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan had written to the Prime Minister supporting the activist from Dhanbad. ?There are a number of big scams in the coal sector, especially in the state of Jharkhand. The papers submitted (by Ramashray Singh) include concrete evidence of corruption that is going on. I request you to kindly order a probe into all these corrupt acts through the CBI,? he had said.

 Former Lok Sabha Speaker Rabi Ray wrote to Singh on September 13, followed by RSP leader Abani Roy?s missive on September 20.

 Wool worth a cool crore

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Dec. 16: Feel good 

 is getting better. 

 Not for the BJP, but for Raymond Limited which inspired L.K. Advani to coin the party?s now-vilified slogan for this year?s general elections. 

 The company today announced that it has secured the costliest wool of 11.8 micron thickness, prided as the ?world?s finest and rarest wool?. 

 After acquiring 69 kg of the wool ? for the first time, beating stiff Japanese and Italian competition ? valued over Rs 1 crore, the company is ready to offer limited edition suit lengths of Super 230s. 

 The BJP had picked up the company?s ?Feels like heaven, doesn?t it? Feels like Raymond? catchline for its finest suits and spun the ?feel good? campaign to showcase the NDA?s achievements. 

 Going by the results at the hustings, the sentiment did not go down well with the electorate. 

 Unlike the BJP, Raymond is not targeting the wider market. It is eyeing a niche of the super rich for its 69 suit lengths, the price of which hasn?t been fixed. ?It is as precious as a rare painting,? said a Raymond spokesperson.

 ?It is for the discerning customer. India is getting prosperous and Raymond is targeting the industrialists, rich NRIs and a few politicians? There are quite a few Calcuttans who would be interested,? said Nabankur Gupta, the group president, Raymond Limited. 

 The cost of the wool would be in the region of Rs 1.80 lakh per kilo and other charges would add a few more lakhs. But Gupta was not willing to put his finger on a price. 

 S.K. Gupta, the president, corporate and textiles, is confident about finding buyers for the costliest suiting in the world. He said the previous lots of marginally higher thickness were completely sold out. 

 One micron is one millionth of a metre. Over the years, Raymond has consistently upped its technology and skills to improve the quality of its fabric. This year, Raymond launched a limited edition of the Super 220s collection (13.2 micron wool) and in 2002, the Super 200s (13.5 micron wool). 

 The Super 230s fabric will be launched towards the middle of 2005. The term Super 230s connotes the fineness of the fabric. Higher the grade of wool, finer the fabric. 

 The finest wool is not easily available and comes from a special breed of Australian merino sheep, Saxony Merino, at a time when they are at most 12 months old. The sheep are reared in Queensland and Victoria, where the weather is conducive for high quality wool. 

 ?Excellence, quality and leadership are the hallmark of all that we deliver at Raymond. This showcases Raymond at its best with its world class technology to create the rarest and finest fabric in the world,? said Gautam Singhania, the Raymond chief and a man known for his discerning taste.

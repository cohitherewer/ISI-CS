 Harassment cloud on ashram

 New Delhi, Oct. 11 (PTI): Women inmates of Pondicherry?s Aurobindo Ashram have alerted the National Commission for Women on alleged instances of sexual harassment and other ?perverted acts? such as defecation and urination in their rooms.

 The inmates refused to identify the perpetrators as they were ?threatened that they will be asked to leave the ashram if they lodged any complaint?.

 Five sisters living in the ashram told the women?s commission during its October 6 visit to the city that ?quite a few inmates? were facing such harassment. 

 The complainants, whose father was working in the ashram, have been living there for years after deciding not to get married, commission chairperson Poornima Advani said.

 She said the commission has directed the newly-formed women?s body in Pondicherry to investigate the matter. 

 The commission has also asked the Pondicherry government to set up short-stay homes for the women inmates as they have complained that no separate hostel facilities are available for ashram women.

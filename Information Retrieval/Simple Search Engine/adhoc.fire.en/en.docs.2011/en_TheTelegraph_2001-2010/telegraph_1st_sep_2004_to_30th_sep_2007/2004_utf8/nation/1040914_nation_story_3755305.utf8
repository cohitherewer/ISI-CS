 Court wind in Uma flag

 New Delhi, Sept. 13: Uma Bharti today received a shot in the arm as the Supreme Court criticised a public interest litigation alleging the former Madhya Pradesh chief minister had dishonoured the national flag during the ongoing tiranga yatra.

 The petitioner, Seema Nayar, contended that Uma was violating the national flag code, dishonouring the Tricolour by hoisting it during her ongoing tiranga yatra from Hubli to Jallianwala Bagh. 

 The division bench of Justices . Santosh Hegde and S.B. Sinha, however, took exception to the petition. Justice Hegde shot back saying ?it is strange (that) none took note of its dishonour by a model and cricket fans?. 

 ?What about the handling of the national flag by thousands of Indian cricket fans during the matches?? Hegde asked.

 The bench also asked why the petition was directed against ?one politician?. 

 It suggested that the petition be amended to seek a directive for the formation of a ?proper national flag code? as the court was all for it. 

 The judges said: ?All political parties should be made respondents in the petition.?

 The bench said ?entertaining a petition containing allegations against a particular politician would have a cascading effect?.

 On the suggestion of the apex court, the petitioner has agreed to amend the petition to make it general in nature and array all political parties as respondents.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 High grades for Singh 

 MONOBINA GUPTA 

 New Delhi, Oct. 8: A.B. Bardhan in his presentation of a ?report card? on the Congress-led Centre has accused many of its leaders and ministers of not working according to coalition principles.

 In a lead article in the CPI mouthpiece New Age, the party general secretary wrote: ?The Congress has accepted coalition politics. But many of its leaders and ministers have still not acquired coalition culture and the style of functioning. This leads to friction.?

 But Bardhan put in a positive word for Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. ?It is good that the Prime Minister often reminds his colleagues that it is a coalition government. We are now in 2004 and not in 1991.?

 The Left parties have found an ally ? at least for the time being ? in the Prime Minister and against ministers whose policies they are opposing.

 Left leaders had sought the Prime Minister?s intervention not once but repeatedly during the recent spat with Planning Commission deputy chairperson Montek Singh Ahluwalia.

 Bardhan brought up the plan panel issue in his article and criticised its decision to wind up all consultative committees. ?This is a typical instance of throwing the baby with the bath water,? he said.

 There was also a clear message to the United Progressive Alliance government not to ignore the Left. ?The Left is a crucial force in the present set-up. Its sensibilities and concerns have to be taken care of,? Bardhan asserted.

 His criticism of the Centre, however, was less strident than a month ago when both the CPM and CPI leaderships had expressed in strong terms their disaffection with the government?s functioning. 

 Basu against US help

 CPM leader Jyoti Basu has opposed the US offer of help in the investigation of the recent militant attacks in the Northeast. He said he would ask his Left colleagues to take up the matter with the government. 

 ?I am totally opposed to it. This is unthinkable. We can deal with our problems, why should we take their support?? Basu said in Calcutta.

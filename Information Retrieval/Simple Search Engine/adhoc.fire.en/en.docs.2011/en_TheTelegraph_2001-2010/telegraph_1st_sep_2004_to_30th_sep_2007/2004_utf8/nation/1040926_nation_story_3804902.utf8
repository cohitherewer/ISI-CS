 Hyderabad eyes slice of IT pie

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, Sept. 25: Cities have been circling for the spoils since Azim Premji tut-tutted at Bangalore?s ?poor infrastructure? and threatened to expand elsewhere. Hyderabad, it seems, has emerged top dog, at least for now, over Calcutta, Chennai, Bhopal and Indore. 

 The Wipro chief breezed into the Andhra Pradesh capital last afternoon for a brief 15-minute red-carpet meeting with chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy in the secretariat and walked out with a clutch of promises. 

 The information technology giant is not forthcoming on the discussions, but it is believed that Premji briefed Reddy, who was accompanied by IT secretary J.C. Mohanty, on his group?s expansion plans for Hyderabad, including relocating a proposed major development unit from Bangalore to facilitate European clients. 

 Wipro already has a development centre at Hi-tech City to look after its Asian and US business. 

 Premji asked for almost five lakh sq ft of built-up area to be ready in two years and projected, in return, about 15,000 software jobs in the state. 

 The chief minister, elated that an IT boon was falling in his lap though his government is viewed as pro-farmer, was quoted by aides as saying: ?Take whatever and wherever you want. But condition is that you should provide more employment for my boys.? 

 But he clarified that there should not be any compromise on skills. ?Take them only if they are fit. But tell us now what you require so that we can make it available to your standards when you really begin operations,? Reddy said.

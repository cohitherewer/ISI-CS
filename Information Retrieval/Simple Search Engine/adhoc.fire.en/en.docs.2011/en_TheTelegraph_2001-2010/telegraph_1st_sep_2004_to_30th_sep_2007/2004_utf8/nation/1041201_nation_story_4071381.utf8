 Red appeal for third force in Bihar polls

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Nov. 30: The CPI-ML today called for the formation of a ?third force? to take on the RJD and the BJP in the coming Assembly elections.

 But with the Left party distancing itself from the Congress and Ram Vilas Paswan?s Lok Janshakti Party, it was clear that the appeal ? with little scope of realisation ? was directed only towards the CPI, CPM and the Janata Dal (United).

 Addressing an impressive rally, CPI-ML general secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya said while the RJD was responsible for criminalisation of politics, the LJP had worked for the politicisation of crime in Bihar.

 ?It should be clearly understood that crime, mafia and corruption were not the only options of governance in Bihar. A vibrant and honest alternative is also available in the state. The replacement of the RJD by similar forces will not help solve the problems of the vast majority of poor people in the state. That is why we want to forge a principled alliance with Left-wing, democratic and socialist forces,? Bhattacharya said.

 What Bihar needed, he said, was ?new politics?, which could be provided only by taking the CPI-ML along. 

 ?No one can ignore the red flag in the state today. We want to change the situation in Bihar. The new politics has to focus on the poor, unemployment and education. Our doors are open to all talks for the formation of a third force,? the CPI-ML leader said.

 Bhattacharya said hunger is a stark reality in most of Bihar today. ?Flood and drought have hit the poor hard. Industries have closed down. The situation has to be changed,? he added.

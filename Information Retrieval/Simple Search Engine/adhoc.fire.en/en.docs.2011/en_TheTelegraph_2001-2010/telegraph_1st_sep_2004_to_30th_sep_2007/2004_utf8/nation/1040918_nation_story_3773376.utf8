 Musharraf extends stay

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 17: A 

 meeting between Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Pakistan 

 President Pervez Musharraf is likely to be held on the sidelines 

 of the United Nations General Assembly in New York on September 

 24.

 Musharraf was scheduled to leave on September 23, but the fact that he was willing to extend his stay in New York by a day for the meeting with Singh shows his keenness on talks with the Prime Minister.

 Singh will also meet the heads of government of Japan, Brazil and Germany ? the three other contenders, along with India, for a permanent seat on the Security Council.

 The meeting will provide the quartet the opportunity to coordinate their positions to bring about an early restructuring of the Security Council.

 On September 22, Singh will address leading CEOs ? and not stockbrokers ? at the New York Stock Exchange. On his way to the US, he holds a similar meeting with British CEOs in London.

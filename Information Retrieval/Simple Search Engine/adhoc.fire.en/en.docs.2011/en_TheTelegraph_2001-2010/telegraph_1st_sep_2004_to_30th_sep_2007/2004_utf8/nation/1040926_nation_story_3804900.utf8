 BJP slams Delhi?s Pak stand

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 25: The BJP and the ruling Congress had a slanging match on the wording and content of the India-Pakistan joint statement issued yesterday.

 The BJP claimed that Delhi?s stand on issues of ?vital national interest? was diluted in the statement, issued in New York after a meeting between Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President Pervez Musharraf.

 The main Opposition party objected to the ?omission? of cross-border terrorism and accused Singh of allowing the bilateral dialogue to become ?Jammu and Kashmir-centric?.

 ?It is for the first time that the J amp;K issue has been singled out for special mention in the joint statement,? former foreign minister Yashwant Sinha said at a news briefing. India, he added, has always had the principled stand that all issues, including Jammu and Kashmir, had to be sorted out bilaterally.

 Sinha said the joint statement amounted to ?regression from the position we (the National Democratic Alliance government) had achieved in the January 6 joint statement?. The reference was to the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-Musharraf statement arrived at in Islamabad earlier this year.

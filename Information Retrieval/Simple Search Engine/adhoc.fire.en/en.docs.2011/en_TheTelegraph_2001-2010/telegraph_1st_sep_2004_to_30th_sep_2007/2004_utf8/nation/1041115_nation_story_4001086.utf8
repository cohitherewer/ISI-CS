New Delhi, Nov. 14: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh?s orders to reduce military presence in Jammu and Kashmir has been taken as a signal by the army that peace is the agenda of the season but there continue to be concerns over talk of ?de-militarisation?.

 ?We are far, far away from that (de-militarisation). It is with some satisfaction that we note that the immediate response of a cross-section of political representatives is to welcome the move (to reduce troops) but the interpretation in some foreign media that we are headed towards ?de-militarisation? is just not correct,? a high-level source in the security establishment told The Telegraph.

 A defence ministry source said the northern army commander and the commanders of the 15 (Srinagar) and 16 (Jammu) corps are working out the details in consultation with army headquarters on the schedule to withdraw troops. One source said that even if there were indications from the political leadership that a reduction of troops was being considered, it is an idea that army headquarters is not used to.

 This is the first time since insurgency started in Kashmir in the mid-1980s that the security establishment has been given such an order. So far, all exercises have been aimed at finding troops to increase the military density in Jammu and Kashmir.

 In the Valley, despite the welcome accorded to the statement of intent to reduce troops, there continue to be concerns on the density of the Rashtriya Rifles? presence. The Rashtriya Rifles is under the home ministry but is staffed by the army. Its human rights record is questioned by social activists. 

 In Delhi, the source said reducing troop levels is a confidence-building measure that is aimed at paving the way for talks in the Valley with outfits like the Hurriyat and also an effort to assuage international concerns. But on no account should the measure be interpreted as a move towards ?de-militarisation?, the source said.

 Military brass has noted that Mirwaiz Umar Farooq welcomed New Delhi?s announcement to reduce troops. But the Mirwaiz also welcomed President Pervez Musharraf?s ?loud thinking? on Kashmir. Musharraf had said at an iftar on October 25 in Islamabad that Kashmir may be divided into seven distinct regions and then Delhi and Islamabad should discuss which regions can be de-militarised, placed under joint and/or UN control. 

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had initially dismissed these remarks as ?off-the-cuff? but external affairs minister K. Natwar Singh said yesterday that if Islamabad made a serious proposal, India would be willing to give it consideration.

 Defence ministry sources said that the tangible drop in infiltration has largely influenced the decision to reduce troops. This has been attributed to intensive counter-insurgency operations, the fence along most of the Line of Control and the modern detection hardware supplied to infantry battalions manning the LoC.

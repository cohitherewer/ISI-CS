 Laloo pawn in Cong poll game

 K. SUBRAHMANYA

 New Delhi, Dec. 12: Two months ago, the Congress had outmanoeuvred the Nationalist Congress Party while forming the government in Maharashtra. Now it appears set to act tough again with another ally, the Rashtriya Janata Dal, as elections in Bihar draw near.

 That the Congress is intent on a firm approach was clear from its stand in Parliament in the past week. The party repeatedly rejected the Opposition?s demand for a statement from Prime Minister Manmohan Singh over the public spat between its two Bihar allies ? RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav and Lok Janshakti Party president Ram Vilas Paswan.

 Apparently, Laloo Prasad ? whose RJD is the second-largest constituent of the United Progressive Alliance after the Congress ? had hoped that Sonia Gandhi?s party would take his side in the House in view of the Bihar Assembly elections scheduled for February.

 But the Congress kept the RJD chief guessing by its silence, which is being interpreted in All India Congress Committee circles as a positive pre-poll signal to Paswan. The LJP leader has vowed to take on the RJD in the poll battle and is looking for allies for his anti-Laloo Prasad front.

 Till recently, an alliance between the Congress and the RJD for the Bihar polls was seen as a forgone conclusion, though the Congress state unit under Ram Jatan Sinha has always held a different view. But with the elections drawing near, AICC leaders have started thinking in terms of alternatives.

 A poll course independent of the RJD could have implications for the UPA at the Centre. But Congress leaders argued that they are working with the Left parties at the national level despite being rivals in states like Bengal, Kerala and Tripura. Besides, they added, nothing could prevent parties from coming together after the polls to form a government.

 To back up their argument, AICC leaders also pointed out that the current RJD-Congress government in the state was a post-poll arrangement as the two parties had fought the last elections separately.

 AICC leaders are enthusiastic about Paswan?s efforts to forge a Dalit-Muslim social coalition. They reckon that if the Congress decides to throw its weight behind Paswan, not only could they wean away the minorities from Laloo Prasad?s Muslim combination but upper-caste communities, too, might be willing to leave the BJP and support an anti-Laloo Prasad formation. And if Paswan succeeds in roping in the Nitish Kumar-led dominant Janata Dal (United) faction in the state, the combination, AICC leaders believe, could spell serious trouble for Laloo Prasad?s 15-year-long stranglehold over the state.

 While Laloo Prasad has had his way with Sonia, which has prompted him to adopt a ?dismissive? attitude towards the Bihar Congress leadership, AICC functionaries are certain that she is too independent to be swayed by the RJD leader.

 They said though Sonia had adopted a magnanimous approach while striking alliances for the Lok Sabha elections, the need to revive her party in Bihar would dictate her approach to the Bihar polls.

 Dal mulls united fight

 - End of RJD misrule on agenda of BJP and LJP too, says JD(U) state president

 Patna, Dec. 14: Rumblings apart, the Janata Dal (United) is fast veering round to the idea that ditching the BJP for the coming Assembly election in Bihar is pointless and the more pertinent task is to win over Ram Vilas Paswan?s Lok Janshakti Party to its side.

 The party is willing to do all that is possible to build an anti-RJD coalition in the state and also to convince Paswan that going alone will be a futile exercise for the LJP with its ?limited? appeal base.

 In the bargain, the JD(U) has repeatedly said it is ready to offer the chief minister?s post to Paswan. The BJP, while expressing itself in favour of ?broadening? the anti-Laloo Prasad Yadav combination for the election, has refrained from naming individuals who could lead any such alliance.

 ?We, too, are opposed to the BJP?s communalism. But apart from that, we do not have much difference with the BJP. That party stands for the development of Bihar and wants to end the RJD?s misrule, for example. These are on the LJP?s agenda too. So, we do not see any problem in all anti-Laloo forces joining hands,? state JD(U) president Vijendra Prasad Yadav said today.

 In his public and party meetings, senior JD(U) leader Nitish Kumar has been stressing the same logic. ?Our offer of the chief minister?s post to Ram Vilas Paswan still stands,? Yadav said.

 At the party?s Pawapuri convention last month, a sizeable section of party members had favoured snapping of ties with the BJP. But JD(U) leaders now say that being ?realistic? is much more significant than harping on the BJP?s communalism, which is ?insignificant? in the context of the coming election.

 ?The fact is that the BJP garnered 11 per cent of the votes in the last election. Our combined vote was more than 30 per cent, while Paswan managed 7 per cent. It is only common sense to suggest that we should come together. We are in touch with the LJP. Politics is a game of possibilities and the common goal of ousting the RJD should determine the course of electoral politics in Bihar,? the JD(U) president said.

 The JD(U) has announced that it will have a separate election manifesto from the BJP. ?There is no contradiction because we are two different parties,? Yadav said.

 The party?s state executive took exception to Laloo Prasad repeatedly announcing development schemes in the run-up to the election. ?The RJD chief has been taking the people for a ride. He has not taken the necessary cabinet clearance for the schemes, as directed recently by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh,? the JD(U) leader said.

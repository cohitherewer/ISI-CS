 Natwar clears air on W. Asia

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 6: External affairs minister K. Natwar Singh today made it clear that no dramatic changes in India?s dealing with Israel or Palestine was coming in a hurry.

 In its common minimum programme, the United Progressive Alliance had said it would give a ?fresh thrust? to Delhi?s traditional ties with West Asia. But in what appears to be the first proper articulation of its policy regarding the region, Singh said: ?Our relations with Israel have developed on the basis of mutually beneficial co-operation and are important.? 

 He was addressing the Indian Association for Central and West Asian Studies at the Jamia Millia Islamia University.

 The UPA?s common minimum programme does stress on deepening ties with West Asia and India?s traditional support to the Palestinian homeland but fails to mention anything on Israel.

 Fresh charges in Bakery case 

 Mumbai (PTI) : Clearing the decks for 

 retrial of the Best Bakery case in Maharashtra, a special 

 court declared on Wednesday that it would frame charges 

 afresh on September 15 against the 21 accused of killing 

 14 people in Vadodara during the post-Godhra riots.

 Special judge Abhay Thipse directed public prosecutor P.R. Vakil to submit a draft of charges against all the 21 accused by September 13. The court also declared that charges would have to be framed against those absconding, after they are arrested and produced before the court. The judge indicated that his court was likely to shift from Sewri to the new premises at Mazgaon for the next hearing.

 Fifteen of the accused, lodged in the central prison here, were also produced before the judge to mark their presence. Non-bailable warrants against five absconding accused were extended till the next hearing.

 The public prosecutor complained to the court that the Gujarat police were not keeping him informed about steps taken to trace the absconding persons. However, investigating officer P.P. Kanani, posted at Shahpur police station in Ahmedabad, said he had submitted a report in this regard to assistant prosecutor Manjula Rao and also published photographs of the absconding persons in local newspapers in keeping with a court directive.

 124-yr-old Bible donated

 Durban (PTI): A 94-year-old woman of 

 Indian origin, Rasammal Kathan Pillai, donated a 124-year-old 

 Bible, written in Tamil in Pondicherry during French rule, 

 to the local documentation centre here.

 The Bible, written in 1880, has been with the Pillai family for 115 years. It was brought to South Africa by Rasammal?s great-grandfather, who was an indentured labourer. She presented the precious family heirloom to Kwazulu-Natal minister of arts and culture Narend Singh, who received it on behalf of the documentation centre.

 Pillai, whose father gave the Tamil Bible to her on her wedding day, said she wanted to present the Bible to the documentation centre because she did not believe her offspring would look after the priceless heirloom. She has five children, 19 grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren.

 ?I want to know that when I die, the Bible will live on. I chose to donate it, instead of it lying around at home. I want others to appreciate it,? she said.

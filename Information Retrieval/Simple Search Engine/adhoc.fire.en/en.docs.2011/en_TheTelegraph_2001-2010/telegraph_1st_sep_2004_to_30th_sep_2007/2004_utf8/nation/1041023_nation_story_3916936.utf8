 India opposes human cloning, backs it for research

 United Nations, Oct. 22 (Agencies): India has strongly opposed reproductive human cloning but supported it for research on stem cells, saying the new technology could be used to fight diseases.

 The Indian stand was echoed by UN secretary-general Kofi Annan. He endorsed scientific research involving the cloning of human embryos, differing with President George W. Bush who is backing a resolution calling for a ban on both the cloning of humans and the cloning of human embryos for stem cell or similar research, known as therapeutic cloning.

 The US and Costa Rica have been joined by over 50 countries, mostly Catholic or developing nations, in sponsoring a resolution calling for a total ban.

 The stem cell row has become an issue in the US presidential election campaign. Bush has opposed government funding for any research involving the future destruction of human embryos, while his opponent John Kerry has backed aggressive pursuit of embryonic stem cell studies.

 US opinion polls show strong public opinion backing stem cell research. The cause has been highlighted by the recent death of Superman actor Christopher Reeve, an ardent supporter whose widow Diana endorsed Kerry yesterday. 

 ?Obviously it is an issue for the member states to decide. But as an individual and in my personal view, I think I will go for therapeutic cloning,? Annan said on his return to the UN headquarters after weeks of official travel.

 All member nations of the UN oppose reproductive human cloning. But many support therapeutic cloning for research into debilitating diseases and spinal cord injuries.

 Annan?s announcement will have brought cheer to US opponents like India and Belgium, who are behind a rival resolution that would ban only reproductive cloning.

 Death-wish patient dies

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, Dec. 17: K. Venkatesh, the terminally ill patient in the middle of a euthanasia tussle with the court, breathed his last at 5.13 this morning.

 The muscular dystrophy patient died in his sleep, with his mother and doctor by his bedside, after chronic pneumonia spread and most of his organs began malfunctioning one after the other. Even the ventilator that had kept him ticking for almost 15 days failed to revive his heart.

 Dr B. Srikanth, who attended on the 25-year-old through the last two months of hospitalisation, said only his eyes remained unaffected and useful for transplantation.

 Venkatesh, a commerce graduate who was computer literate, was two days ago conveyed the Andhra Pradesh High Court?s decision to reject his plea for non-heartbeat death (absence of heartbeat) so that his organs could be donated.

 Venkatesh had pushed his mother Sujata to seek legal sanction for voluntary death of another kind as the possibility of brain death was said to be minimum in the genetic neurological defect that afflicts only men and leads to death by the mid-20s.

 A state committee of doctors had said Venkatesh?s organs were fit for transplant.

 The high court refused to pass an order in contravention of the Andhra Pradesh Human Organs Transplant Act, 1995, saying there was no provision in law for allowing organ donation in cases other than that of brain death.

 ?But for his wish to donate his organs, my son would have breathed his last almost a month ago. He strained to live for others? sake. When he realised it was a vain effort, he just gave up,? Sujata said.

 Venkatesh?s last words to the media yesterday evening were perhaps indicative. 

 ?I want my mummy to take me home,? said the man who battled the physically-disabling disease since he was six.

 ?Since (yesterday) afternoon, he has been in heavy pain and almost without speech,? his doctor said.

 D.R. Patnaik, an administrative officer of Global Hospital, said Venkatesh?s eyes were removed and given to the L.V. Prasad eye hospital and the Chiranjeevi eye bank.

 Sujata said she planned to approach the Supreme Court soon to seek recognition for non-heartbeat death in the Andhra act.

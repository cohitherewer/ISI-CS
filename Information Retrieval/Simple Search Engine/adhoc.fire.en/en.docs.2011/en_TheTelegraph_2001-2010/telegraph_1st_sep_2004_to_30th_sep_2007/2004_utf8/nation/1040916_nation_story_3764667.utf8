 Somnath has English tea, misses action 

 AMIT ROY 

 Somnath Chatterjee

 London, Sept. 15: Somnath Chatterjee, the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, had tea and scones at the House of Lords yesterday but missed an example of British democracy in action.

 Chatterjee could not witness today?s unprecedented uproar in the Commons when five supporters of fox hunting, which the government is set to ban, broke into the chamber today. However disorganised the Lok Sabha can be, Chatterjee does not have to deal with the kind of passions aroused by the controversy over fox hunting. 

 Chatterjee?s host, Lord Swraj Paul, said: ?I asked a few of my colleagues to join us. They included Baroness Amos, the Leader of the House of Lords which makes her a full member of the cabinet, Baroness Symons, a foreign office minister, and Lord Grocott, the chief whip in the Lords.?

 On Monday, the Indian High Commissioner, Kamlesh Sharma, gave a lunch for Chatterjee to which members of parliament from all the three major parties were invited. Seventy-five-year-old Chatterjee, who is in London on his way back from a meeting in Toronto of parliamentary officers, is a Cambridge man and a barrister and no stranger to either Britain or the ways of parliament.

 He briefly sat in on a session of the House of Lords and even if he wished things were like this back home in Delhi, he made no comment to Paul.

 ?The upper house is a very, very quiet place,? said Paul, who was elevated to the peerage in 1996. It is traditional even for peers who strongly disagree with each other to show exaggerated courtesy to a fellow member by referring to him as ?My noble Lord?. Paul said: ?The Lords is a very decorous place. The debates here are very good, very informed. Those who have no knowledge of a subject say nothing. Some visitors who come here from India find the Lords even a little boring.?

 Paul added that in contrast to the well-measured debates in the Lords, ?the House of Commons has a very different atmosphere. It?s much more political. I would say the debates in the Lords are much better.?

 The Commons can be rowdy and noisy but unlike the Lok Sabha, the Mother of Parliaments does not witness too many walkouts by the opposition. ?I don?t think so,? said Paul thoughtfully. It is now common practice for most British national newspapers to employ ?parliamentary sketch writers? whose job is to report the Commons as a piece of theatre.

 Since parliament, especially the Prime Minister?s question time, is televised, it is natural for MPs to ?play up to the TV cameras? in an effort to impress their constituents ? most certainly make an effort to wear clothes suitable for television.

 It is not as though MPs never misbehave. Michael Heseltine, a former flamboyant Tory MP, once famously shocked his fellow parliamentarians by grabbing and swinging the mace. Today, the atmosphere in the Commons is more gladiatorial than unruly and wit and the cut and thrust of debate more appreciated than out and out bad behaviour.

 The Speaker can also deal effectively with any member who lapses into ?unparliamentary language?. 

 The palace remains a favourite with tourists but a recent ?flour-bombing? of Tony Blair from the gallery of the Commons highlighted the dangers of a possible terrorist attack.

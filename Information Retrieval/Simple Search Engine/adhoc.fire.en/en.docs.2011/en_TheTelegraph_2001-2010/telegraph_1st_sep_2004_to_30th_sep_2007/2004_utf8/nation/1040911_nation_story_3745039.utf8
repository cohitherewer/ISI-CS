 Strike deaths

 New Delhi, Sept. 10: The ongoing industrial strike here claimed its first two victims today when a factory worker in west Delhi committed suicide and a factory owner collapsed and died after addressing a protest gathering, reports our correspondent.

 Deep Bhatia, the 42-year-old owner of one of the oldest metal-work units in Vishwas Nagar locality, was rushed to a local hospital where he was declared dead. Fellow protesters said Bhatia was under severe mental tension of late.

 Sudhir Gupta hanged himself in Mundka locality while agitating small-scale manufacturers were organising a roadblock on National Highway 10 nearby.

 Small manufacturers and owners of small industries here have been on an indefinite strike for the last three days protesting against Supreme Court orders for the closure of F-category polluting industries in residential or non-conforming areas.

 The Delhi government is yet to take action on the court orders that had caused chaos when implemented for the first time in 2001.

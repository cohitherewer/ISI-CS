 Border dams

 Kathmandu, Oct. 3 (AFP): India has agreed not to construct any dam along its borders with Nepal without Kathmandu?s consent.

 The decision was taken after four days of talks between officials from both countries on India?s construction of dams on its side of the border and the annual flooding of lowland tropical areas in Nepal. 

 The leader of the Indian team, C.B. Vashisth, confirmed that the committee had reached an agreement on methods to avoid inundation problems caused by the construction of dams.

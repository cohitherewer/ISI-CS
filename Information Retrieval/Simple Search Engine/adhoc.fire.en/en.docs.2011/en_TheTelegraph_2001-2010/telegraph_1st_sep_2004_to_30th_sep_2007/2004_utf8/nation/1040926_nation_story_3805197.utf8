 Airport bar to be open 24 hours 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 25: The Indira Gandhi International Airport will lead the way in making Delhi a round-the-clock, seven-days-a-week experience, with chief minister Sheila Dikshit finally giving the green signal for it to have the first 24-hour bar in the country?s capital.

 The cabinet has also decided to allow bars in the city?s restaurants ? stand-alone and in hotels ? to close one hour later. A formal order will soon be issued to implement the cabinet decision, said Delhi government officials.

 The government is also planning to extend the 24-hour facility for bars to five-star hotels, but the move has been put on hold.

 However, the first to savour the change in bar timings will be those travelling by international flights. The Indira Gandhi International Airport has two bars in the arrival lounge and two in the departure lounge. These are managed by hotel majors like Welcomgroup, Taj, Ashok and Radisson and each caters to passengers of specific airlines.

 The bars till now used to open from 1 pm to 1 am and were treated on a par with stand-alone restaurants in terms of licence fee, which could vary from Rs 3 lakh to Rs 7.5 lakh depending on the number of covers at these restaurants.

 Bars in restaurants had to close by 11 pm, while those in five-star hotels were allowed to stay open till midnight.

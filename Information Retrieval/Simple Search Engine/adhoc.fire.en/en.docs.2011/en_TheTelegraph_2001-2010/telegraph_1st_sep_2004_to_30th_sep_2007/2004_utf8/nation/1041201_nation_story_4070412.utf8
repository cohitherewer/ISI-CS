 NRI festival

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Nov. 30: This winter the NRIs will come home to Mumbai.

 The Pravasi Bharatiya Divas, the annual fest organised by the Government of India for that coveted species of Indians, will take place in Mumbai early next year.

 The official reason: weather. ?Delhi is not the best venue in January for such an event,? said S. Krishna Kumar, secretary, ministry of overseas Indian affairs. ?Mumbai would be at its best at that time.?

 But the selection of Mumbai is an attempt to give the Divas a much-needed shot-in-the-arm. Attendance at the event dropped significantly this year, from 1,750 registrations in 2003, the first year, to 1,350. Kumar hopes the Mumbai venue ? where Bollywood will also be enlisted ? will make the show house-full.

 ?There were some mistakes during the previous events. In Mumbai, there should be more participation from the Gulf. There were some logistical errors, too. Many people who wanted to register at the last moment could not get air tickets. Mumbai is better connected with the Gulf and Southeast Asia,? he said.

 ?We are expecting record attendance,? said Vivek Bharati, adviser to the Pravasi Divas organising committee.

 Pawar in ?normal? gimmick

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Oct. 6: If the Shiv Sena deliberately played up Bal Thackeray?s ?illness? for impairing his ability to campaign, the Nationalist Congress Party?s endeavour has been to put behind Sharad Pawar?s indifferent health and get on with the business of electioneering.

 NCP functionaries dismiss the Sena?s strategy as a ?cheap gimmick to extract emotional mileage?. ?For the sake of power, they are ready to do anything. No other party is saying a word on Thackeray?s illness, yet he waxed in detail about it in Saamna (the Sena mouthpiece),? said party secretary Munaf Hakeem.

 General secretary Prakash Binsale said without emphasising it that the NCP would project Pawar as ?normal and active?. ?Gaining sympathy is the last thing on our minds. Saheb is up and about and he?s addressing eight meetings a day,? he said.

 Binsale recalled that when the Maharashtra strongman was wheeled in for emergency surgery just before the Lok Sabha polls, he made it a point to present himself before the press two days later, ignored medical advice and spoke at length to clarify that he would campaign.

 Underlying the NCP?s effort is the realisation that without Pawar the party is a zero. ?He carries it on his shoulders. In fact, even the Congress does not have a state-level campaigner of his stature. They depend on Sonia Gandhi,? a source said.

 However, two things bother the NCP. First, why did Pawar, known for his astuteness, contest the election for cricket board president only to lose to a ?non-entity?? Then, for the first time, he was not able to contain the large-scale rebellion in the party ranks.

 The sources said the two were linked because Pawar was away from the state for three days when the rebellion started to brew. When he returned, it was too late to persuade the rebels to withdraw.

 ?His style of working is distinct,? explained an aide. ?He creates little networks around key persons so that those around him or her can keep him informed of the goings on. In the BCCI set-up he was not able to do that. In spite of that, he got more votes than he expected. If the nominee from Maharashtra was allowed to vote, Pawar would have won.?

 Of greater concern to the NCP is the presence of rebels ? party sources claim there are only nine, though the BJP says the number is 63. 

 ?There were two big failures on our part,? a source said. ?One, we were not able to bring the other secular parties like the Samajwadi Party and the Janata Dal (S) into our fold. The second was too much time was spent distributing tickets and too little on placating the rebels.?

 While the sources claimed the alliance with the Congress was ?textbook perfect? on the ground, the rebellion was attributed to the fact that after the last Assembly elections, Pawar directed every contestant, including those who lost, to plunge themselves into preparing for the next election. ?They took his word seriously and, therefore, felt more cheated,? the sources said.

 In the sunset of his political career, NCP watchers believe Pawar is out to honour a much bigger commitment in these elections. ?He wants to prove that he is a quintessential Congressman and was faithful to the party despite the allurements from the BJP to have an alliance,? Hakeem said.

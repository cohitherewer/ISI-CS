 SC in war widow move

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 6: The Supreme Court today issued notices to the Centre on a public interest litigation alleging lack of compensation and total neglect of about 40 per cent of Kargil war widows.

 A division bench of Justices . Santosh Hegde and S.B. Sinha also issued notices to the Uttar Pradesh government on the petition citing the case of Shakuntala Devi, the widow of Naik Chaman Singh who died in the Kargil war.

 The widow had attempted to immolate herself in front of the residence of Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav but was saved by the police personnel deployed there, the petition said. She had later said it had become impossible to carry on a battle against vested interests to acquire land allotted to her and restart her life after the death of her husband.

 The petition was filed by a final-year law student of Delhi University, Jyotsna Dwivedi, who argued the case herself. Dwivedi contended that 40 per cent of the widows did not get any compensation or benefit and were running from pillar to post to get the welfare and rehabilitation packages announced by the government.

 The package included an ex-gratia payment of Rs 10 lakh, Rs 5 lakh to buy land to construct houses, Rs 2 lakh for childrens education, Rs 1,000 a month for recurring expenses, Rs 1,000 to aged parents and liberalised family pension. However, over 500 women who lost their husbands in the Kargil war were yet to get any benefit, alleged the petition.

 When the petitioner repeated the plight of Kargil war widows, the judges observed: Why do you restrict yourself only to the Kargil widowsall war widows are yet to get full benefits. Dwivedi then agreed to amend her petition to include all war widows.

 This is an indication that the scope of the petition would be expanded to include all war widows and the apex court may determine a set of guidelines for their welfare and rehabilitation.

 The petitioner cited a report of the STAR News channel to contend that many war widows were on the verge of frustration and might end up trying to end their lives. In this context, she recalled Shakuntala Devis attempt to immolate herself in front of the Uttar Pradesh chief ministers residence.

 It is disturbing to note the apathy of the government towards that section of society that has made the country safe through its selfless contribution, Dwivedi said. She urged the court to direct the Centre to immediately take steps for proper implementation of the schemes so that widows actually benefited.

 An estimated Rs 20-25 lakh was being distributed to Kargil war widows. Under government rules, the money was being paid directly into the accounts of the widows or parents and not any other relative to reduce possibility of misuse.

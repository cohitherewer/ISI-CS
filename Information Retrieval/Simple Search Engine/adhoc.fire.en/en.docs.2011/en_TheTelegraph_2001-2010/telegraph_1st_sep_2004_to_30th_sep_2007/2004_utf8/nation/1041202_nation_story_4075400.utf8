 Now, pay for groundwater

 AYSWARIA VENUGOPAL

 New Delhi, Dec. 1: The Delhi government has announced a first of its kind decision in the country to levy user charges on groundwater extraction.

 The decision to tax groundwater, subject to the Centre?s approval, came with the Delhi government?s announcement yesterday of a new rationalised water tariff structure that implied a four-fold hike.

 The new charges, following the recommendations of a World Bank study, will be effective from today.

 Delhi Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Vision was prepared by consultants PriceWaterhouse Coopers in connection with a Rs 1,640-crore loan that the Delhi Jal Board had sought for undertaking water sector reforms.

 The capital, according to a report of the Central Ground Water Board in 2002, had 400,000 tubewells, of which only 100,000 were licensed. It had also observed an alarming drop in Delhi?s watertable levels.

 Over the last few years, groundwater levels plunged from 2-5 metres below surface to 8-12 metres below surface. The problem became so severe that at several places, tubewells had to be sunk as deep as 30 metres.

 According to the government?s proposal, tubewell owners will have to pay Rs 1,500 per horsepower as a one-time charge. With tubewells dug so deep, most owners use pumps ranging from 2-5 HP ? which means a spiralling of water bills.

 Moreover, the charge is subject to yearly revisions.

 The groundwater tax would affect residential areas, builders and posh areas such as Sainik Farms that are dependent on groundwater for their needs.

 The user charges are aimed at regulating groundwater use but leading environmentalists, like Vandana Shiva, have questioned the government?s move on the grounds that it failed to involve the public in the decision. 

 Shiva pointed out that Kerala High Court had in the Plachimada vs Coca-Cola case ruled that ?underground wealth belongs to the public. The state and its instrumentalities should act as the trustees of this great wealth?.

 Emphasising that the new tariff structure and proposals would place a huge financial burden on Delhi residents, she said: ?The reason for the dependence on tubewells was because of the unreliability of the Delhi Jal Board. You cannot charge this rent without first determining the ownership rights.?

 ?There should be a larger public debate and this can?t be done through any regulator, which is again an undemocratic institution,? Shiva added.

 She accused the Delhi government of increasing water tariff with the eventual aim of privatising water distribution in accordance with World Bank recommendations. ?You cannot hand over a public utility with a reasonable tariff structure to a private company and expect it to make huge profits without a huge public uproar,? she said.

 ?This tariff hike before privatisation is about managing public uproar and smoothening the way to super profits,? Shiva claimed.

 Cong ruffles Jat duo

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 12: The Congress high command might have stoked the Jat fire in Haryana with just over two months left to the Assembly elections in the state.

 Senior Jat leaders Birender Singh and Bhupender Singh Hooda are understood to be infuriated with the central leadership?s appointment of AICC secretary and Youth Congress chief Randeep Singh Surjewala as the Haryana unit working president.

 Birender and Hooda, both former state presidents who have eyes firmly fixed on the chief ministerial crown, have been running a concerted campaign to oust Bhajan Lal from the state chief?s post and position themselves in a now-or-never battle for the top job.

 For nearly two months, the high command has been pretending as though the Haryana unit is united behind Bhajan Lal in the battle to defeat the common enemy ? chief minister Om Prakash Chautala and his Indian National Lok Dal (INLD).

 The leadership was also hoping that the Birender-Hooda intra-Jat rivalry would help maintain the organisational status quo under Bhajan Lal in the run-up to the Assembly polls.

 At one stage, it held out a quiet threat of giving the president?s post to Selja, Union minister and prominent Dalit leader, as a compromise arrangement to contain the triangular rivalry involving Bhajan Lal, Birender and Hooda. But the move was aimed at keeping the two Jat leaders quiet.

 The high command sprung a surprise on Wednesday when Birender and Hooda persisted with their attack on Bhajan Lal and, in the process, threatened to widen the factional rivalry ahead of polls. It appointed Surjewala, a lesser-known Jat leader, the working president who would ?work under PCC president Bhajan Lal?.

 Sources close to Birender and Hooda expressed ?disappointment? over the high command?s move.

 The Jat camps of both leaders dismissed talk that Surjewala?s appointment would help rally the powerful community behind the Congress by weaning it away from the INLD, whose main vote bank is derived from the Jats.

 The two leaders themselves believe that the appointment was a ploy by Bhajan Lal, a non-Jat leader, to win over the Jats without conceding the leadership.

 Birender and Hooda openly demonstrated their differences with Bhajan Lal, a former chief minister, by organising separate rallies in the state on Thursday to mark Congress chief Sonia Gandhi?s birthday.

 The state unit leadership has viewed it as parallel activity but left it to the high command to deal with the situation.

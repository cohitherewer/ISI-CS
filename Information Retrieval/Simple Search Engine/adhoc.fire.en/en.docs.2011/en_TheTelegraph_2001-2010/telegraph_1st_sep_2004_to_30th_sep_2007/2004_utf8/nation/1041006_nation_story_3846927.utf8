 NDA smells bid to isolate Fernandes

 KAY BENEDICT

 New Delhi, Oct. 5: A section of the NDA is keeping a wary eye on the Centre?s aggressive bid to hunt for skeletons in the previous regime?s closet, fearing that a sustained drive might isolate George Fernandes, one of the key leaders who have held the Opposition alliance together during crises.

 Government sources had hinted that the CBI probe into Tehelka could just be the tip of an iceberg and inquiries into other controversies could follow but Fernandes? party feels that the firepower will eventually be concentrated only on him and his close aides.

 Janata Dal (United) sources said they expect the government to soft-pedal cases against .K. Advani and others but gun for Fernandes for his strident campaign against Sonia Gandhi. Railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav is also keen to hem in Fernandes to prevent him from creating roadblocks for the Rashtriya Janata Dal in the Bihar Assembly polls scheduled in February.

 The capital is rife with speculation that an informal ?Friday Group? ? a combine of senior Congress ministers and leaders ? has put under its scanner at least half-a-dozen issues concerning the previous NDA government.

 The issues on the shortlist include the decision not to contest quashing of charges against .K. Advani in the Ayodhya case, purchase of AK-47 rifles by the home ministry, allegations of irregularities against Ananth Kumar in land allocation, charges of fudging rural development figures against M. Venkaiah Naidu and alleged improprieties in coal purchase when Sahib Singh Verma was minister. All these former ministers belong to the BJP.

 The rest of the charges relate to Dal (U) leaders: Fernandes (coffin purchase besides Tehelka), Nitish Kumar (alleged graft in railway projects) and Sharad Yadav (alleged corruption in the food ministry).

 NDA sources said so far the Congress seems to be serious about pursuing only the Tehelka cases against Fernandes and Jaya Jaitly.

 The NDA sources said their understanding is that the Congress will not touch Opposition leaders like Advani. They fear that the BJP may not go beyond a point to bail out Fernandes. 

 Some Dal (U) leaders still believe that Fernandes would not have been taken back to the Cabinet after the Tehelka scandal but for Atal Bihari Vajpayee. They feel that eventually the other scandals may be quietly put on the backburner, leaving Fernandes and Jaitly to fend for themselves.

 However, there is also a section in the NDA which believes that the ?witch-hunt? will make the Opposition alliance, adrift after losing power, ?more cohesive?.

 ?Right now the BJP is dogged by squabbles and ego clashes with second-rung leaders running a vilification campaign against each other. Once the Congress-led government resorts to witch-hunting, we will all unite. All differences will be peppered over,? said a BJP leader.

 The NDA sources claimed that the Phukan Commission in its interim report had exonerated Fernandes in all 14 defence deals it took up to investigate. But the report has not been made public.

 Immediately after law minister H.R. Bhardwaj announced the decision yesterday not to give an extension to the Phukan Commission, Dal (U) general secretary Shiv Kumar demanded that the interim report be made public.

 But sources close to a ?Friday Group? minister denied that there is any concerted effort to launch a ?witch-hunt?. They tried to downplay the drive as an attempt by leaders who had earlier levelled charges against NDA ministers in Parliament to look into questionable deals.

 Blair repeats UN support

 AMIT ROY

 London, Sept. 20: Britain will support India?s bid to become a permanent member of the UN Security Council, Tony Blair said today at a press conference at 10, Downing Street, with Manmohan Singh, the Prime Minister of ?the worlds greatest democracy?, standing by his side.

 No 10 has probably not seen so many Indians crammed into one room as happened this afternoon for the joint press conference addressed by the two Prime Ministers.

 They pledged to work together in a wide range of fields, including the war against terrorism, science and technology, G8 meetings, climate change and even Iraq.

 Manmohan Singh sidestepped questions on Indian opposition to the war. He said that India?s position was well known but his government would be prepared to help train the Iraqi police. It was not clear whether this would be in Iraq or in India.

 In response to a question about whether Britain was soft on Pakistani terrorism, Blair adamantly denied his government was but he welcomed the talks currently talking place between India and Pakistan.

 Manmohan Singh stepped down as finance minister in 1996, a year before Blair was elected as prime minister in Britain. So this was partly in the nature of a ?get to know you? encounter. 

 It was clear from their remarks that there are not too many bilateral problems between Britain and India. The two Prime Ministers issued a long joint declaration after their meeting which was crammed with ?things to do?.

 It noted that ?the relationship between our two countries is now the strongest it has been? and paid tribute to the contribution of 1.3 million people of Indian origin in the UK towards ?making Britain the vibrant, dynamic society that it is today?.

 Blair may have to work a bit harder next time, though, to get their votes for many have been put off by his endorsement of the Iraq war.

 The document revealed that India is now the 8th largest investor in the UK and that 500,000 Indians visit Britain every year.

 There is a detailed section on defence and terrorism. ?We will build upon and expand programmes of joint military training exercises,? the declaration said.

 ?Both our countries are deeply committed to combating terrorism in all its forms and manifestations,? it added. ?We will try to ensure that the global norms against terrorism are upheld by all countries. We will share our experience and augment our cooperation, including operational; cooperation between police, law enforcement agencies and others in our criminal justice system. We will enhance our cooperation to counter money laundering and terrorist financing.?

 There were important sections also on nuclear power and science.

 ?The UK and India agree to expand cooperation in the fields of civilian nuclear activities, civilian space programmes and high technology trade,? it said.

 And on science, the declaration stated: ?We have established a joint committee on science and technology and a networking scheme that enables scientists to meet each other, exchange research ideas and establish links.?

 New areas for cooperation would include ?climate change, alternative and clean energy technologies, environmental science, agriculture, and health research and development.?

 There was a very interesting paragraph on culture, which included a nod to Bollywood. ?The cultural influence of the UK, not least through the use of English, has added to the richness of Indian culture, and Indian writers have enriched English literature. Now, through the community of Indian origin in the UK, and directly, Indian culture is becoming an important component of multi-ethnic Britain. We welcome this and will work to strengthen cultural linkages between our two countries, including in areas like publishing and film production.?

 The comments made during the press conference put flesh on an already dense declaration, which will take officials on both sides months and possibly years to implement. 

 ?India is a country of 1.2 billion people,? said Blair. ?For India not to be represented on the Security Council is, I think, something that is not in tune with the modern times in which we live.?

 Britain has long argued that the structure of the Security Council drawn up following the Second World War ? under which the US, Russia, UK, France and China hold permanent seats ? should be reconsidered, with a seat for India the top priority.

 Manmohan Singh said he was ?very glad? to hear Blair?s reaffirmation of Britains resolve to help India gain permanent membership of the Security Council.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Learn lesson, forget cost

 - MPs root for move to televise House proceedings

 SEEMA GUHA

 New Delhi, Dec. 18: The yearly fee that tax payers have to shell out for this ?political education? would be somewhere between Rs 200 crore and Rs 300 crore. But the men who shape the country?s future say its value can?t be calculated in terms of money.

 Parliamentarians, cutting across party lines, have welcomed Lok Sabha speaker Somnath Chatterjee?s move to televise proceedings in both Houses. They believe that in a democracy, people have a right to see what their elected representatives are doing in Parliament. So the debate on the telecast, which started from December 14, cannot boil down to mundane monetary considerations.

 ?I want the visitor?s gallery to be extended to every home in this country,? Chatterjee said. ?People have the right to know what is happening inside Parliament.? The speaker?s office has also dismissed charges that public money will be spent unnecessarily. Doordarshan already has the transponders, officials said, while the money is minimal.

 Parliament will have to shell out Rs 15 lakh to Doordarshan for the 10 days in this session while the national broadcaster is gearing up for regular telecasts from February, when the the railway and general budgets will be presented.

 DD will not be allowed to make money through sponsors or take advertisement spots for the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha telecasts, but Mandi House bosses are not worried. 

 ?When Parliament in its collective wisdom decided on telecast of proceedings in the House, who are we to question the decision of the political leadership? We are not here to make profits from these channels. It is our duty as public broadcasters to show how Parliament functions and we will do so. The funds will come from Parliament,? K.S. Sarma, the CEO of Prasar Bharati, said.

 But what is worrying them is how to fill the slots on the two exclusive channels when Parliament is not in session. Parliament has to meet at least for 110 days in a year.

 One suggestion was to fill them with archival material. But the problem remains: will there be any takers for such material? And will DD spend its money on beaming programmes that nobody will watch?

 Those close to the scene of action disagree. Yesterday, when Somnath Chatterjee threatened to quit after the BJP criticised his ?dictatorial? style, the Lok Sabha speaker?s office was flooded with calls from all over the country asking him not to step down. ?The power of television is enormous. We were amazed at being swamped by callers across India who were watching the proceedings and knew what was happening,? a source in the speaker?s office said.

 The source, who refused to be named, also shrugged off Doordarshan?s concerns as to what to show when Parliament is not in session. DD need not worry, the official said. The Lok Sabha secretariat would meet before the budget session and decide how best to utilise the channels for educating the public politically.

 The official explains that ?political education? means the public will get a chance to find out how laws are ?enacted?, how the Houses function and how discussions take place. ?It will certainly not be confined to the views of one particular party or try to promote the ideology of that party.?

 The channels will be under the speaker and there will be clear-cut guidelines to ensure that speakers do not misuse their position to promote themselves or their political views.

 If Chatterjee spoke of extending Parliament?s visitor?s gallery to every home, Yerran Naidu of the Telugu Desam Party said his party was the first in the country to telecast Assembly proceedings. ?We believe the channels can be used effectively to educate the people and bring transparency into the system,? he said.

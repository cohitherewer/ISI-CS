 MP kin in murder net

 Mani Kumar Subba

 New Delhi/Jalpaiguri, Sept. 12: The brother-in-law and wife of Assam MP Mani Kumar Subba were arrested less than 24 hours of each other, one for allegedly murdering the parliamentarian?s personal assistant and the other for tampering with evidence in a bid to save her brother.

 Narendra Limbu, the prime accused in the murder of Milan Subba, was last night traced to Mani Subba?s house at Salugara, off Siliguri town of Bengal. 

 This morning, Delhi police took the MP?s wife, Jyoti, into custody on charges of conspiring with her brother to wipe out evidence and helping him escape.

 Milan was found murdered at his boss? sprawling farmhouse in Mehrauli, on the outskirts of Delhi, on Thursday.

 Jalpaiguri superintendent of police A.K. Nand said Delhi police requested their Bengal counterparts to keep an eye on Mani Subba?s residence near Siliguri, based on information that the absconding Limbu was headed for his home state, Sikkim.

 ?After we received the information, we started keeping vigil on the house. Also, vehicles were checked at different places in Darjeeling and Jalpaiguri, and even on the Assam border. Delhi police officials also informed us that he might try to enter Sikkim,? Nand said.

 Last night, Delhi police informed the Jalpaiguri police control room that Mani Subba?s brother-in-law was on his way to Siliguri from Purnea on a Toyota Qualis. 

 ?We thus intensified our vigil. They arrived last night. As officials at Bhaktinagar police station were getting ready to raid the house, an assistant sub-inspector at the same police station, who was keeping watch on the house, found Limbu coming out on a motorcycle. He immediately gave chase him and overpowered him after a 3-km pursuit,? Nand said. 

 A Delhi police team, led by a sub-inspector, reached Jalpaiguri today to take the prime accused and two accomplices to the capital. Judicial magistrate Mou Chatterjee, standing in for the subdivisional judicial magistrate, cleared the decks for Limbu?s transfer to the Delhi team?s custody. 

 Milan?s wife, Gita, told the police Limbu had quarrelled with her husband. 

 After Milan was killed, Limbu?s sister allegedly helped him flee the capital. 

 She was booked for bailable offences after being questioned about her role in the incident.

 The police said it was unlikely that Jyoti did not hear the gunshot that killed Milan. An investigation revealed that bloodstains had been removed from the floor of the room in which the crime was committed. 

 The police were informed about the murder six hours after the incident, by which time Limbu and the two guards at the farmhouse ? Ravi Lal and Arjun ? had fled.

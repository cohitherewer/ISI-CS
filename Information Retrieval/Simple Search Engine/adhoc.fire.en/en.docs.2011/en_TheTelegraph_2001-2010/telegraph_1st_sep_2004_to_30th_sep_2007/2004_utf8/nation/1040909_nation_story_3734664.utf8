 Bangalore, Sept. 8: Two women will lead the charge of the BJP in the run-up to the Maharashtra elections.

 The strategy for next month?s polls took precedence over other issues at a meeting of the BJP?s central office-bearers attended by former Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayee, leader of the Opposition .K. Advani, party chief M. Venkaiah Naidu and 50-odd members.

 Former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Uma Bharti and former Union minister Sushma Swaraj have been handed charge of the campaign. While Uma will spend five days travelling through Maharashtra as part of her tiranga yatra, Swaraj will lead an ?Andaman satyagraha? for restoration of Veer Savarkar?s plaque at the Cellular Jail in Port Blair on September 21.

 During nationwide protests against ?tainted ministers? from September 21 to 25, party leaders will focus on ?follies? of the Congress-led coalition at the Centre and in Maharashtra.

 BJP leaders today chose to tread with caution on the statistics released by the Census Commission, seeking a national policy on population growth. ?It is not an issue of Hindus versus Muslims, but one of disproportionate growth. The government should implement a national law for planned growth of the population,? Swaraj said.

 Yesterday, Naidu had said: ?It is disturbing as the Hindu population is declining and the Muslim population is on the rise.? He added: ?Yeh desh ke liye achchha nahin hai. (This is not good for the country.)?

 Former minister Arun Jaitley suggested a national debate on population control and the need to promote the two-child norm with incentives for small families. ?More population means more poverty and other socio-economic problems. The population explosion should be a national worry,? he said.

 Jaitley announced that Uma would set off on her yatra from Hubli on September 10 and travel through Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana before arriving at Jallianwala Bagh in Punjab.

 Uma was applauded for stepping down as chief minister and surrendering in court. She had resigned after the court in Hubli issued warrants against her in a case involving flag-hoisting at the disputed Idgah Maidan that led to several deaths in rioting.

 ?Vajpayee and Advani paid compliments as she has enthused party workers across the country with her stand on nationalism,? Jaitley said.

 Party sources quoted Vajpayee as saying: ?The coming times are going to be highly favourable to the BJP and our allies. The need of the hour is to work together.? 

 He claimed that the UPA government?s problems were multiplying with time.

 ?There is no single centre of power in the new government. The ruling coalition is in disarray. Relations between the Congress and the communists are souring,? Vajpayee told the meeting.

 But the former Prime Minister also said the BJP was ready to join hands with the Congress to bar ?tainted persons? from entering Parliament and the Assemblies.

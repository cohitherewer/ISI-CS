 Left holds up Iraq class

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 27: The Left Front does not want the Centre to send Election Commission officials to Iraq to train its personnel for the polls early next year.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has invited Left leaders to breakfast tomorrow morning to discuss a proposal from Iraq?s interim government seeking the training.

 ?We do not mind if they come here to be trained. But we do not want our officials to go there,? CPM politburo member Prakash Karat said. This is the only issue on tomorrow?s agenda, he added.

 There is, however, a lengthy agenda awaiting the next United Progressive Alliance-Left coordination committee meeting as the debate over the issue of foreign direct investment in telecom is far from over.

 ?The note circulated by P. Chidambaram has several inaccurate information,? Karat said after a meeting of Left leaders that chalked out the issues to be raised at the next coordination committee meeting. ?We will issue a point-by-point rebuttal.? 

 CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan said: ?We will have a full-fledged discussion on the issue at our next meeting, which is likely in the first week of November.?

 The Left is also ?concerned? over the UPA government?s intention to divest shares in a large number of profit-making public sector undertakings, including in the navratnas and miniratnas.

 ?The common minimum programme gives public sector undertakings the autonomy to mobilise resources in the capital market. But the decision to off-load shares of 35 public sector units has been taken by the finance ministry,? Karat said.

 ?The current move will not strengthen the public sector,? he said. 

 ?It will only facilitate an easy route for resource mobilisation by the finance ministry.?

 The Left parties are insisting on a board for restructuring public sector enterprises and the government has agreed.

 ?But the board is yet to be formed even though the empowered group of ministers is already going ahead with fixing the price for the sale of profit-making public sector undertakings,? Karat said.

 The Left parties have come up with a list of ?dos and don?ts? on foreign policy. For instance, they have asked the Centre to make a clean break with the NDA regime?s policy regarding the US and Israel.

 ?The NDA government was following a policy of subservience to the US. This must stop,? Karat said.

 ?It is necessary for the UPA government to review the nature of the strategic ties with Israel,? he added.

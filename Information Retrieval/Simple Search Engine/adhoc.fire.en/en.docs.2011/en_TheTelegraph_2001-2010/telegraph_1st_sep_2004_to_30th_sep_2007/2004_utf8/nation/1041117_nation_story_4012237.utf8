The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Mum on seer, vocal on rivals

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY 

 Sonia

 Rae Bareli, Nov. 16: Sonia 

 Gandhi today gave a patient hearing to her constituents 

 but flared at the Opposition?s attempts to renew attacks 

 on her over the arrest of the Kanchi seer and the state 

 government?s apparent step-motherly treatment to the Gandhi 

 pocket boroughs. 

 ?Since the case is sub judice, I won?t comment on the arrest of the Sankaracharya,? she said during her third visit to her constituency. 

 But she did not hold back on her rivals. ?If (the) NDA targets me over the case, what is new in it? They have been doing this on some pretext or other. But if they plan to target me now, this would be only in the interest of (the) Congress? The more (the) NDA attacks me, the better for (the) Congress,? she said. 

 Sonia arrived at Bhojpur village, 80 km from Rae Bareli town, around 1.45 pm and headed for the Dasharni Devi mandir ground. 

 Like before, the Congress president adopted the chaupal system of interacting with people in one-to-one sittings. Accompanied by her personal assistants, the block officers and former party MLA from the area, Ashoke Singh, Sonia mingled with about 3,000 people, listening to their complaints. 

 Septuagenarian Shia Devi spoke about the problem of treating her daughter who is suffering from hysteria after being abandoned by her husband. Bring the patient to Delhi for treatment, Sonia told Ashoke Singh. 

 Then she listened in embarrassment as students of the Kamla Nehru Degree College alleged that they were cheated by its owner, a leader of Sonia?s party. 

 More complaints, of power cuts, roads and other basic amenities, triggered an attack on chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav. 

 ?Oh yes, I do believe the state government is behaving like a stepmother towards the people of my constituency. The power shortage is an acute problem here. There are other problems of road and healthcare facilities,? she said. 

 But she denied his allegation that she was conspiring to topple his government. ?Sazish wazish bilkul nahi hai (There is no truth in the allegation of conspiracy),? she said.

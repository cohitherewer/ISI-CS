 UK seeks Kohli extradition 

 New Delhi, Aug. 31: Britain today sent a request to India for extradition of Maninderpal Singh Kohli, wanted by Scotland Yard in connection with the rape and murder of 17-year-old Hannah Foster, reports our special correspondent.

 The request was received by the foreign ministry from London Interpol. The CBI has alerted its Chandigarh unit to appear at a Chandigarh court tomorrow where Kohlis bail plea is to come up for hearing, an agency spokesperson said here.

 We will ensure that he does not get the bail till his extradition request is decided upon, he said.

 The request came from British police barely 11 days before Kohli completes 60 days in custody when he would have been eligible for bail. The extradition trial would begin soon after the ministry issues a notification under the extradition act designating a court in Delhi for the case.

 Kohli, 37, was arrested at Panighata near Naxalbari in Bengals Darjeeling district on July 15.

 Hannah went missing on March 14, 2003, in Southampton, England. Her body was found after two days and a post-mortem found that she had been raped and strangled to death. Kohli fled England for India within two days of the discovery of the body.

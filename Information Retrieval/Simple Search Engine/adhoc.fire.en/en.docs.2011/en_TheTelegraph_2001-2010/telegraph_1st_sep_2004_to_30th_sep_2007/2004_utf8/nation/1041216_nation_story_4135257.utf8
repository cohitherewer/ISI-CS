 Jilted lover burns bride

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Katras (Dhanbad), Dec. 15: 

 The rage of a jilted lover engulfed a wedding here, 

 burning to death the bride and her two relatives.

 Twenty-eight-year-old Laxman Singh tried to immolate himself after dousing his beloved ? 18-year-old Aarti ? with petrol an hour before her marriage to Nand Kishore, whom she had consented to marry.

 The small room where Aarti?s pre-wedding rituals were being held caught fire when the petrol sprinkled by Laxman fell into a burning oven in a corner. 

 The incident took place at Katras in Dhanbad?s Baghmara block.

 Aarti suffered 75 per cent burns, along with eight of her relatives, while another eight sustained 50 per cent burns. Aarti, her cousin Nitu and her aunt Shanti Devi later succumbed to their injuries.

 The youth, who stood at the doorway to prevent anyone from escaping, was badly burnt.

 Aarti?s mother Shova Devi, sister Vaso Devi and two others were struggling for life in a hospital.

 Aarti and Nand Kishore were supposed to be married in the nearby Ma Lilori Sthan temple, 5 km from Katras town. 

 It was almost 9.15 am when the youth barged into Aarti?s Ganja Gali home. The three-room house near Katrasgarh railway station mostly had women as the men were busy making arrangements for the wedding.

 Narrating the incident, Aarti?s sister Soni Kumari said Laxman entered the house through a narrow lane with a five-litre container filled with petrol. 

 ?He entered the room and started pouring petrol on Aarti. A charcoal chulha (oven) was burning and in 15 minutes the room was reduced to ashes,? Soni said.

 ?Two knives were strapped to his chest,? added Soni, who was unhurt as she had ventured out for a bath. 

 Laxman, a resident of Bhagalpur in Bihar, was an employee of Katras Sweets.

 The injured were taken to the nearby Chaudhury Nursing Home by former legislator .P. Lal, behind whose house Aarti stayed. The critically-injured were later sent to Patliputra Medical College and Hospital.

 Superintendent of police Ajay Kumar Singh said the ?incident was unfortunate and an FIR has been lodged?.

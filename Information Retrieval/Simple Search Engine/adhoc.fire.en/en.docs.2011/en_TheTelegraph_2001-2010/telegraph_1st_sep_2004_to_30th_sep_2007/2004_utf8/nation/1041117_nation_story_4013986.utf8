 Uma sends letter of peace to ranks

 Uma Bharti 

New Delhi, Nov. 16 (PTI): 

 Suspended BJP leader Uma Bharti tonight told her supporters 

 to ?keep mum? on the disciplinary action against her and 

 said she does not want to turn Madhya Pradesh into a ?venue 

 for a trial of my strength?.

 In an open letter that is seen as part of a patch-up bid, Uma asked her supporters to ?stand firmly? behind the party, saying it is necessary as the country is passing through a ?grave crisis and difficulty?.

 Describing Atal Bihari Vajpayee and L.K. Advani as ?symbols of clean politics and development?, she said: ?We all have worked hard to reach this stage.?

 The letter, which she is understood to have dictated from her spiritual sojourn in Kedarnath and released to the media in Delhi late tonight, came six days after her sudden suspension from the party following a spat with Advani at the first meeting of the partys new office-bearers in full glare of cameras.

 ?I do not want to turn Madhya Pradesh into a venue for a trial of my strength. We cannot become strong by weakening the ideology,? Uma said, launching a veiled attack on Congress chief Sonia Gandhi and the communists.

 ?Those forces which want to weaken the country are behind that foreign woman as also the people of the communist ideology who have from the start been against the basic principles of India,? she said.

 In a letter to Advani released a day after she was suspended, Uma had compared herself to a ?daughter being thrown out of the house on the day of Dhanteras?.

 In today?s letter, Uma told her supporters that they should not get disturbed over whatever decision is taken on her suspension.

 ?Keep mum on that issue,? she advised them, adding they should refrain from making any comments. ?You should recall what Shivaji Maharaj had done... We should focus our attention on our ultimate goal and not get entangled in personal ambition and ego,? Uma said.

 Groan! Burgers out, idlis in

 AYSWARIA VENUGOPAL

 New Delhi, Oct. 27: Eat 

 healthy, study healthy appears to be the catchphrase in 

 Delhi.

 The Delhi government has got into the act of cleaning out canteens in private schools of potato chips, burgers, pizzas and aerated drinks, and organising health and hygiene camps.

 It has been sending circulars to the schools to encourage healthy eating habits after chief minister Sheila Dikshit objected to ?junk food? dished out by the canteens. The campaign has been on for about a year, said Delhi education minister Arvinder Singh Lovely.

 ?The department issues circulars to schools from time to time about the need to eat healthy food and these have guidelines on the kind of food served in a canteen. We don?t tell them what they should serve but we tell them to avoid junk food,? Lovely said.

 Awareness camps, including those on diabetes and heartcare are being organised in schools to tackle health problems like obesity among children, the minister added.

 The schools themselves have been on this campaign for the last three years, claimed Jyoti Bose, the chairperson of the National Progressive Schools Forum, an association of leading private schools here.

 ?I know of schools like Mothers International, St Thomas and St Mary?s that are already cutting down on the junk and replacing it with healthy food. When we talk of junk food, we mean high calorie, high cholesterol or fried food, and high salt food,? said Bose, also the principal of Springdales School in south Delhi.

 ?Indigenous Indian snacks that were lost are now being put back on the menu because obesity is a big problem,? Bose added.

 Some of the schools, however, are not averse to soft drinks. ?We have a balance of everything and we don?t want our children to feel out of place when they go abroad,? said Shyama Chona, principal of Delhi Public School in R.K. Puram locality.

 The school instead avoids fast food in favour of ?sandwiches, idli, dosa, fresh samosas, which are fried in front of the students because frying them again and again is unhealthy?. ?In Korea, there are 150 choices in schools,? Chona said. 

 DPS also encourages mothers of students to come up with healthy recipes that are then printed in a booklet. 

 ?Any move towards healthy living is appreciated. But what do I do when parents send potato chips for lunch,? Chona said.

 Chona?s Springdales counterpart said: ?Initially, there is a little disturbance but the children get used to it. The tendency to eat fast food is the trouble in every metropolis where the population has great purchasing power. Most children have working parents.?

 Bose?s school opts for ?home-made? pizzas. ?Instead of greasy burgers and pizzas that we get in restaurants, we make our own pizzas, which are almost like home-made ones.?

 The canteen also does not stock soft drinks, cutlets and samosas, ?which are full of masala?. ?There are also no kulchas. Instead, there is idli, sambar and bean sprouts,? she said. Tetra-packed fruit juices, lime juice and soya milk are the drinks.

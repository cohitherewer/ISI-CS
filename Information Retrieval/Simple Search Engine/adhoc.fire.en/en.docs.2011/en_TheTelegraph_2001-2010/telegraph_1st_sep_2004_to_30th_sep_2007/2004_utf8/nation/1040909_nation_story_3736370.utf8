 Zee names sports channel

 Zee Network has named its new sports channel scheduled for an October 2 launch as Zee Sports. Ashish Kaul, a company official, said: ?For the first time, a concentrated and focused effort will be made to leverage the position of domestic cricket.? 

 He added that Zee Network would ensure that ?the best standards and production values are maintained for the telecast of these matches?.

 Zee is finalising partners and content providers for the 24-hour channel. Talks are on with Ten Sports and the Turner group, the latter already having a distribution tie-up with Zee. ?Detailed plans for the channel will be announced in a couple of days,? Kaul added.

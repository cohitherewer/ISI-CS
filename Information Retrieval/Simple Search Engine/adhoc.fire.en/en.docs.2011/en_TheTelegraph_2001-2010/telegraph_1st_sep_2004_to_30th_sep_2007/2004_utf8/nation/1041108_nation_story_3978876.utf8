 Sex racket arrest

 Jammu, Nov. 7 (PTI): Police today arrested the chief of a local cable network after a raid on a hideout in an alleged sex racket involving a former beauty queen.

 Acting on information obtained during interrogation of prime accused Narinder Kohli and former Miss Jammu Anara Gupta, a police team raided a hideout in Jammu and arrested managing director and chief executive officer of Vision TV Cable Networks, Samant Singh, a top police officer said tonight. 

 Soon after his arrest, Singh was whisked away to an undisclosed destination for interrogation. 

 Earlier in the day, after dodging police for a fortnight, Kohli, the prime accused in the sex racket and pornographic CD production case, surrendered before inspector-general of police S.P. Vaid in Jammu. 

 Kohli was accompanied by his brother to the office of inspector-general, and the accused was later handed over to the investigating team.

 Fewer mishaps? Praise the lord, not Laloo

 M.R. VENKATESH 

 Laloo Prasad Yadav

 Chennai, Sept. 18: If the 

 number of train accidents has come down of late, thank the 

 Lord.

 At least Laloo Prasad Yadav is doing so.

 If the railway minister is to be believed, a shining picture of Vishwakarma ? the divine architect and the god of all artisans ? he has installed in his office in Rail Bhavan in Delhi has helped reduce the accident rate.

 ?I pray to him daily,? the Rashtriya Janata Dal chief told a news conference today on his first visit down south after joining the cabinet.

 ?You direct me (in running the railways), I tell Vishwakarma, and so there is no rail accident now,? he added to laughter from the audience, which included minister of state for railways R. Velu and a large contingent of railway officials.

 The homage to Vishwakarma came on Ganesh Chaturthi, a day another popular deity was being worshipped across the country. So if he praised the divine architect, a day after the elephant-riding god was worshipped at factories and workshops, Laloo Prasad did not forget to mention the ?remover of all obstacles?. He began his speech by saying the whole country was today celebrating both Ganapathy Puja and Vishwakarma Puja.

 The minister, on a four-day tour of the southern states to review ongoing projects, also played to the gallery.

 ?Sab log press ko (seat) de dijiye,? he told railway officials who had taken up the front row seats under the shamiana on the lawns of Rail House, asking them to vacate the chairs for mediapersons. The command came after a reporter asked whether it was a press conference or an official meeting. 

 But if anyone thought the scribe had got the better of the RJD chief, he was wrong. ?You are late,? he shot back at the reporter, his humour intact.

 Laloo Prasad, who will visit Rameshwaram to inspect the ageing Pamban Bridge that connects the island to the mainland and flag off the Madurai-Nizamuddin Sampark Kranti Express in Madurai tomorrow, said passenger safety, modernisation and punctuality were his priorities.

 The minister denied any ?internal resistance? to reforms but ruled out privatisation. ?We are not going by the dictates of Washington and the World Bank,? he said, taking a dig at the previous BJP-led regime?s attempts to ?hand over the railways to the private sector?.

 ?We can tackle our money requirements by raising funds in the domestic market,? he added to a query and dismissed suggestions of taking a World Bank loan for developing the railways. He said he would introduce a new type of toilets in trains, ?like those in aeroplanes?.

 When the questions turned to politics, the minister did not hesitate to tick off rivals. Asked about Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayalalithaa?s remarks during her latest visit to Delhi that she never meant anything personal against Sonia Gandhi in her attacks on the Congress chief?s foreign origin, he said ?the level of politics has gone down very low in our country?.

 He criticised former Union finance minister Yashwant Sinha for calling Prime Minister Manmohan Singh a shikhandi (transvestite) at a recent rally in Bangalore. ?Personal attacks against anybody is bad,? Laloo Prasad said. ?(But) I respect all leaders of Chennai and I address her (Jayalalithaa) as sister,? he added.

 When the reporters persisted on Amma?s visit to Delhi and whether she was warming up to the new government, Laloo Prasad quipped: ?I am in her (Jayalalithaa?s) state. My wife Rabri Devi is also here. But she (Jayalalithaa) has gone to Delhi now. So, along with Bihar we have taken over this state.?

 He rejected the suggestion that Jayalalithaa?s ?softening stance? towards Sonia signalled a realignment of political forces. ?There is no realignment of political forces,? he asserted. ?There is a very powerful force of social justice here which is against Jayalalithaa.?

 Nepal pact in sight

 PRANAY SHARMA

 New Delhi, Nov. 10: After years of negotiations, India and Nepal appear to have agreed on an extradition treaty. The neighbours have agreed to extradite nationals of other countries but have decided against handing over their own citizens.

 The two countries are also putting the final touches to a mutual legal assistance pact.

 Nepalese home secretary Chandi Prasad Shreshta is slated to arrive here on November 18 for talks with his Indian counterpart Dhirendra Singh. It is not clear yet if the pacts will be signed then or kept ready for a later date, probably King Gyanendra?s December visit.

 An Indian team led by Ashok Amrohi, joint secretary of the foreign ministry?s consular-passport-visa division, had detailed talks on the two proposed treaties with Nepalese officials over the last few days.

 Sources said significant progress has been made on the extradition treaty, but differences persist over the legal assistance pact. A major problem stems from the ?physical verification? clause under which Indian investigators would be allowed to question on Nepalese soil a Nepali citizen committing a crime in India.

 The Sher Bahadur Deuba government, which has not been able to hold elections and get a parliament in place, feels this provision may not go down well with the Nepalese. The clause also entails additional expenditure since the ?reciprocal? arrangement means Nepal would also have to send investigative teams to India to interrogate suspects.

 It appears that the provision is being shelved on Nepal?s insistence. But there might be a clause saying the provision could be brought into play later if both sides feel the need.

 Signing the extradition treaty would represent major progress and reflect their mutual trust. Such a treaty had been proposed some years ago, but could not be finalised for many reasons, chief being the political instability in Nepal.

 Advani takeoff in RJD bastion

 ASHISH SINHA

 Siwan, Nov. 7: The BJP has put its best foot forward and convinced party president L.K. Advani to start its poll campaign from Siwan.

 The Saran division is said to be a Rashtriya Janata Dal bastion as it includes Siwan, Chhapra and Gopalganj, which are represented in the Lok Sabha by jailed politician Mohammad Shahabuddin, railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav and his brother-in-law Sadhu Yadav ? the three most talked about leaders of the party.

 Advani admitted as much but gave a spin to his choice. ?After becoming BJP chief, I was advised against addressing a meeting in Siwan. But I insisted on the place as the BJP wants to fight crime in Bihar and no other place depicts that better than Siwan,? he said yesterday at a rally at which the turnout was impressive.

 ?The attendance (at the rally) could have been better as Saran division has been our stronghold from the Jan Sangh days. But the henchmen of the only person who matters here kept the people under surveillance. Besides, a large number of our workers were prevented from entering Siwan. This place has an air of terror but we want to counter it,? said a BJP leader of the district.

 Advani enthused party workers by recounting that the power of the ballot has been an antidote to the biggest terrors in a democracy. ?The Congress looked invincible after Emergency. But people showed Indira Gandhi the door. Of the 54 seats in (united) Bihar, the Congress got zero. The story was repeated in Uttar Pradesh, where again the Congress was unable to open its account,? he said.

 The BJP chief said Jan Sangh leader Deen Dayal Upadhyay and socialist Jai Prakash Narayan have influenced his life the most. ?It is ludicrous that Bihar today has a leader who claims to be an inheritor of JP?s legacy and still the state?s track record in all spheres has been dismal,? he said.

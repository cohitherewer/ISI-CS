 B-school trio boost for Asia

 BASANT RAWAT 

 Ahmedabad, Sept. 24: IIM Ahmedabad and Bangalore will cooperate with Peking University to facilitate greater regional collaboration and promote ?contextual management education? in business schools of the Asia-Pacific region.

 IIMA dean Indira Parekh said a decision to this effect was taken at a round-table meeting of Asia-Pacific Association of Management Schools in Beijing attended by representatives of about 15 leading business schools of the region.

 The three institutions are expected to identify a topic for the Asia-Pacific conference of management schools to be held in India in November.

 The meeting has decided to establish an Asia-Pacific case centre where researchers from different business schools will jointly write regional case studies as the ones that are now taught in business schools are alien to Asia-Pacific realities.

 A journal that caters to the needs of business schools of the region will be launched. The association will also establish an accreditation system for Asia-Pacific management schools. Those who plan to establish business schools anywhere in the region will require accreditation from the association, said the IIMA dean.

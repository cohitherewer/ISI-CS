 Citu probe cry on PM table

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 10: The Citu has asked Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to probe the bunglings in the social security scheme for unorganised workers, launched by former labour minister Sahib Singh Verma before the elections.

 ?Verma used the Employees? Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) as a fraudulent cover for a non-existent scheme without any authorisation,? Citu leader and Rajya Sabha MP Dipankar Mukherjee has written to Singh.

 ?I request you to order an immediate inquiry into the social security scheme, the launching of national social security numbers for the workers and the unauthorised role of the EPFO.?

 Verma designated EPFO as the nodal agency for conducting the first national social security scheme for the country?s 37 crore unorganised workers. The former labour minister rushed the scheme, which aims to provide medical security and pension, before the Lok Sabha polls although there were many loose ends.

 The Citu said the pilot projects introduced in Delhi, Lucknow and Mumbai have failed. ?They managed to enrol only 3,500 members till July this year. The government of India had contributed only a token amount of Rs 1 lakh for 2003-04 while the EPFO had spent nearly Rs 13 lakh till March this year.?

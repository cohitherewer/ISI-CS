 Kyunki producer ducks hearing

 New Delhi (PTI): Television producer Ekta Kapoor, summoned by the National Commission for Women over a marital rape scene in her serial, failed to appear before the commission on Wednesday, resulting in the hearing being adjourned to December 14.

 Kapoor had sent two lawyers to the women?s body to represent her, but commission chairperson Poornima Advani adjourned the hearing saying ?lawyers cannot represent their clients in the commission?.

 On whether any reasons were cited for Kapoor?s 

 failure to appear before the commission, Advani said: ?It 

 appears she was under the impression that lawyers can represent 

 the person summoned by the commission. But NCW has never 

 entertained such a procedure. So we are giving her another 

 opportunity.?

 The commission had served a showcause notice to Kapoor and summoned her over ?objectionable? depiction of marital rape in her popular soap Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi.

 Advani said Kapoor, through her lawyers, submitted a CD of the episode in question to the commission.

 ?I have not seen the episode myself, but the other NCW members have. And all have taken objection to the way marital rape has been depicted in the serial,? she said.

 The episode in question was aired on October 12.

 The initiative is being taken up by the Indian Space Research Organisation in association with some non-government and voluntary agencies, minister of state in the Prime Minister?s Office Prithviraj Chavan said in a written reply.

 500 farmers set for Africa

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, Nov. 15: Andhra Pradesh has finalised plans to send 500 of its farmers to Uganda and Kenya by June next year.

 The state?s adviser on foreign investments and human resources, C. Chandrasekhar Reddy, said the government will sign a memorandum of understanding with three organisations in Uganda and Kenya before March 2005.

 He said Andhra?s proposals to provide investment, knowledge and entreprenuership were welcomed in both countries during his visit to Africa this month.

 Each farmer will be given a lease on minimum 100 acres through farmers? cooperatives to be floated by the Andhra government.

 Letters of intent, Reddy said, had been procured from the Ugandan Investment Authority and Kenya?s Tana and Athi Rivers Development Authority (Tarda) and Kerio Valley Development Authority (KVDA).

 ?It is one more farmer-friendly initiative,? said chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy, who along with chief secretary Mohan Kanda is said to have principally concurred with the proposal.

 The government will obtain lease on 10,000 hectares each in the Tarda and KVDA areas in Kenya (20,000 hectares equal almost 50,000 acres).

 In Uganda, only 20,000 acres have been opted for. ?We have chosen riverbank land, which will need minimum investment to make it cultivable,? Chandrasekhar Reddy said.

 KVDA managing director John Murunga in his letter to the chief minister says: ?A draft proposal of the MoU on terms and conditions, besides the extent of land made available for this project, will soon be intimated to the Andhra Pradesh government.?

 The state?s adviser said the government would help the farmers with funds to kickstart their operations and facilitate their travel arrangements and work-visa permits.

 ?Even expatriate Indians in Kenya and Uganda were exulting over the initiative of the Andhra government,? he added.

 Language, Chandrasekhar Reddy said, should be no constraint as English is spoken well in the two African countries and they share a single currency and market.

 Sericulture and groundnut farming have been identified as a profitable debut venture for the farmers, the adviser said.

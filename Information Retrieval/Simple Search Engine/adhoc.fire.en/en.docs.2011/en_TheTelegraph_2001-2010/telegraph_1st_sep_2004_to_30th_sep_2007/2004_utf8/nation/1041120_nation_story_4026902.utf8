 New Delhi, Nov. 19: A number of petitions ? ranging from violation of human rights and arrest procedure to right to life ? are being prepared to be filed in the Supreme Court over the arrest of Kanchi seer Jayendra Saraswati, reports our legal correspondent.

 Former law minister Arun Jaitley is said to be ?ready? with the petitions that might be moved immediately after the verdict of Madras High Court on the acharya?s bail plea. Also ?ready? are former Supreme Court Bar Association president M.N. Krishnamani and lawyer Rani Jethmalani.

 Krishnamani said there was ?messing up of post-arrest evidence with the pre-arrest one?. Bar association members conducted a signature campaign for an urgent meeting to condemn the arrest.

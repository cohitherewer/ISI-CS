 Naxalite outfits on merger route

 NALIN VERMA

 Ranchi, Oct. 13: Two of 

 the strongest underground Naxalite outfits have signalled 

 the formation of a ?new unified party?, which will be known 

 as Communist Party of India (Maoist). 

 A formal announcement is expected tomorrow by Ganapati, the general secretary of the new party.

 The implication and significance of the new development are still not clear, though sources close to the Naxalites claimed that the merger of the People?s War (PW) and the Maoist Communist Centre (MCC) had increased their ?fire-power? and ?battle ability?. 

 Armed squads of the two outfits are also said to have merged and sources claimed that the ?action? in Mahuadanr this week was carried out by the unified command.

 The two underground groups are known to be working together and sources acknowledge that the formation of the new party took almost five years of dialogue.

 Ganapati, who was the general secretary of the People?s War till the merger, appears to have dispelled the illusion that the new party was a step towards electoral politics. 

 In a pamphlet, said to be his maiden statement, the general secretary lays down the goal as a ?protracted people?s war? and ?seizure of power? by armed agrarian revolution.

 The merger, it is said, followed burial of political differences by the groups. The People?s War agreed to accept Kanai Chatterjee and the MCC acknowledged Charu Majumdar as founders of the CPI (Maoist). 

 The literature that the new party plans to distribute is designed to cause concern to the government, which has been holding out an olive branch. Jharkhand, in fact, is keenly waiting for the outcome of talks between the Andhra Pradesh government and the People?s War in Hyderabad. 

 The literature makes it clear that the new party will promote active collaboration with the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) and ?Indian expansionism and US imperialism? in Nepal. 

 The party also pledges to keep opposing the Congress and the mainstream Left.

 The MCC and PW were at war in the eighties and for most parts of the 1990s, which took the lives of hundreds of their cadre in Jehanbad, Gaya, Chatra, Saranda and Palamau regions of undivided Bihar. 

 The friction between the groups provided much relief to the police. But they initiated the process to bury the hatchet to fight the ?common enemy? in 1999 and began working in unison on several issues in the last five years. 

 The development, besides being politically significant, could pose renewed threats to the already-stretched police force in Jharkhand.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Job gain for state

 Calcutta, Oct. 1: Bengal appears to be the biggest beneficiary of the United Progressive Alliance government?s scheme to give one able-bodied person in every family in the country?s 150 poorest districts work for at least 100 days in a year, says a staff reporter.

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee told a rally on Rani Rashmoni Avenue today that Bengal accounts for six of those 150 economically backward districts. 

 The Rs 2,020-crore employment scheme, which will ensure food coupons against work, does not have the legal guarantee that the UPA government had promised in its common minimum programme.

 Bhattacharjee said the Centre was sympathetic about reopening closed central public sector undertakings in Bengal. ?The Alloy Steel Plant in Durgapur was closed. It was estimated that about Rs 56 crore will be required for its revival. But (Union chemicals, fertiliser and steel minister) Ram Vilas Paswan who met me recently assured that Rs 40 crore is ready for the ASP. I am hopeful about its re-opening shortly,? the chief minister said.

 ?Attempts are also being made to save the Hindustan Fertiliser Corporation in Durgapur. We are trying to supply coal gas to the factory from Ranigunj for its revival. A team from the Union government has recently visited the closed Mining Allied Machinery Corporation in Durgapur and is supposed to submit their report to the Centre. We are waiting for the report and I am hopeful about its revival,? he added.

 ?(The) jute industry in Bengal is also likely to run smoothly as the Centre has recently issued a circular making use of jute bags for packaging of foodgrain mandatory,? the chief minister said. Bhattacharjee added that during a recent meeting he had urged Manmohan Singh to consider the case of 27 closed public sector undertakings in Bengal.

 ?I have specifically requested the Prime Minister to rectify their previous mistakes like encouraging globalisation and liberalisation policies. The previous Congress government had opened the path for globalisation for which they had to suffer an electoral setback. I have requested the Prime Minister to rectify their previous attitude towards globalisation and liberalisation,? the chief minister said.

 Today?s rally was organised by 50 mass organisations owing allegiance to various Left parties to protest the Centre?s failure to honour promises made in its CMP. But Bhattacharjee did not criticise the Union government during his 40-minute speech and instead praised the steps it has taken in education. He also applauded the regime?s initiative to establish its secular character by ordering a fresh probe into the 2002 Godhra train-burning.

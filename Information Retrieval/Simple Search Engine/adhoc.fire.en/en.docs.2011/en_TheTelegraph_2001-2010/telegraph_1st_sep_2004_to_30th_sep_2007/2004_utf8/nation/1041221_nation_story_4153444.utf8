 Blast warning for Laloo show

 K.C. PHILIP

 Patna, Dec. 20: Train services were affected in the Gaya-Mughalsarai section of East Central Railway for almost 10 hours after suspected CPI (Maoist) activists detonated a bomb and damaged the track and a culvert early today.

 The incident occurred a fortnight after the Bihar government banned a Naxalite rally in Patna and barely 12 hours after railway minister and Rashtriya Janata Dal president Laloo Prasad Yadav exhorted Left-wing extremists to give up arms at a function in Ranchi.

 Train services in the grand chord section linking Delhi with Calcutta were disrupted for several hours. Normal services resumed after almost nine hours.

 The bomb was planted under a culvert between Karbandiya and Sasaram stations. The blast damaged about 10 ft of the track as well as the culvert near Karbandiya station a little before 1 am, minutes after the Chambal Express passed, a railway source said.

 Two live bombs and 60-ft long wires were reportedly recovered from the site of the blast. The damage would have been much more extensive had all the bombs exploded, the source added.

 ?Our night patrol team acted immediately after the blast and stopped the movement of trains on both the Up and Down lines,? Mughalsarai divisional railway manager (DRM) Vijay Mohan said.

 A number of major trains, including Jammu Tawi- Sealdah Express, New Delhi-Sealdah Rajdhani Express and New-Delhi-Howrah Rajdhani Express were delayed by hours. Two trains ? Kalka Mail and Bhopal Express ? were cancelled from Howrah.

 A couple of days ago, two suspected rebels were killed after a bomb they were carrying went off accidentally at a crowded market in Patna.

 On October 16, suspected Naxalites planted bombs on a track before the Howrah-New Delhi Rajdhani was to cross. But an alert railway employee foiled the attempt on that occasion. The incident happened near the same Karbandiya station in Rohtas district. 

 Assistant stationmaster of Sasaram, P. Lal, said some leaflets left behind by the culprits spoke of retaliation to the government?s decision to ban the Naxalite rally on December 5.

 Yesterday, organisers of the banned rally ? the Krantikari Jan Sangharsh Ekjutta Samiti, a group sympathetic to the Naxalites? cause ? decided to boycott the RJD?s mega show on December 23. 

 Refusing to buy Laloo Prasad?s argument that the government acted on the Centre?s instructions, the rally organisers held the state responsible for ?banning the rally and arresting workers, cultural activists and children? who were headed for Gandhi Maidan.

 DRM Mohan said the rail authorities are keeping an eye on the Naxalite-affected areas in the division following yesterday?s boycott call.

 CBI probe into Pappu durbar

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 2: The Supreme Court today ordered a CBI inquiry into the alleged illegal visit of over 50 supporters of Madhepura MP Rajesh Ranjan Yadav alias Pappu Yadav to Patna?s Beur Central Jail yesterday. 

 The division bench of Justices N. Santosh Hegde and S.B. Sinha also sought a detailed report from inspector-general (prisons) of Bihar, Deepak Kumar Singh, of the incident. 

 Yadav?s supporters allegedly violated jail rules and behaved in an unruly manner. The MP is now in judicial custody after the Supreme Court had cancelled his bail in the Ajit Sarkar murder case.

 The court took suo motu cognisance of media reports on the alleged unruly behaviour of the visitors. The timing of the durbar coincided with the visit of the IG (prisons) to the jail in connection with a function to mark World AIDS Day.

 Both the CBI and Singh were directed to submit their reports on or before December 13. The matter would be heard a day later.

 ?We take notice of news reports in the media regarding the incident in Beur Jail. We direct the IG (prisons) to send a report in this regard to the court,? the bench said. 

 ?There was a heated argument between supporters of Yadav and the jail staff during the visit of IG Singh but there was no violence,? Bihar jail minister Raghavendra Pratap Singh had said.

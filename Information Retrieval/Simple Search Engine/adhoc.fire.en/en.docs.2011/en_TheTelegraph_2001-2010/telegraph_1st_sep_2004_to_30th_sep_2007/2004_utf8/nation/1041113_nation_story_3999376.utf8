 Silence to heal Uma wound 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 12: The RSS is believed to have advised Uma Bharti, who left this morning for her retreat in Kedarnath, to keep mum for the next two weeks or so during which its leaders hoped to thrash out a way of bringing her back to the BJP. 

 The BJP, it is learnt, is toying with postponing its national executive ? to take place in Ranchi from November 24 ? until the Uma tangle is resolved to the ?mutual satisfaction? of both sides. 

 The problem may cast a shadow on the meeting, with her sympathisers ? who have so far remained silent ? speaking up, directly or indirectly, feared sources.

 ?They don?t have to plead her cause. They can raise the issue of how grassroots leaders have been sidelined and how the BJP is losing its base as a result,? said a source.

 Besides, the Ranchi meeting nearly coincided with a swadeshi sammelan convened in Varanasi by K.N. Govindacharya. There is apprehension that he or his supporters may tangentially speak out. 

 Two views have emerged about the letter Uma had shot off yesterday to BJP president L.K. Advani. 

 One section said the missive was not a ?show of defiance?, there were ?traces of affections? and the personal references to Advani and Atal Bihari Vajpayee suggested it is a ?family problem?. 

 The second view, expressed by a source close to M. Venkaiah Naidu, is that she had insulted the party president by reading out a letter to the press before handing it to him and ought to be expelled. 

 The RSS favours a ?give-and-take?. Advani, said the source, should hear out Uma?s version and decide with a ?cool mind? whether her statements constituted an ?act of indiscipline? or not. 

 Uma, who reportedly told the Sangh she would go back on her ?terms?, has been asked to reconsider her stance and suggest a face-saver.

 Once bitten, TN staff shy of strikes: Survey

 M.R. VENKATESH

 Chennai, Nov. 5: Tamil Nadu government employees want to retain their right to strike but do not want to exercise the right, according to a survey.

 Last year, the Jayalalithaa regime dismissed nearly a lakh employees for going on strike. 

 About 74 per cent of the government staff support, in principle, ?the right to strike and agitations?, revealed the survey by the Public Services International (PSI) ? a France-based global federation of workers in public sector services. 

 These employees ?do not want to forgo trade union rights?, including the right to association, right to collective bargaining and benefits conferred by membership of trade unions.

 However, nearly 80 per cent of the respondents of the first such survey in an Indian state do not want to actually use strikes and agitations as a weapon, said the survey whose results were made public today.

 ?As many as 79 per cent of the employees, irrespective of their affiliation, consider only a cordial approach by the unions is necessary to get concessions from the government. Only 10 per cent of the respondents support strikes and only 9 per cent support demonstrations and rallies,? said PSI?s Lakshmi Vaidhiyanathan while releasing the survey.

 The government employees concede that public support for strikes is marginal, according to the survey.

 Government staff feel that a single union would enhance their bargaining power. However, the employees are equally divided on supporting unrecognised unions.

 The Image Audit ? as the survey has been named ? was carried out to understand the mindset of Tamil Nadu government employees after the mass dismissals last year and in the aftermath of the Supreme Court ruling banning strikes by government employees.

 The survey ? of 2,811 employees, with men accounting for 79 per cent ? was undertaken in the last week of September and covered Cuddalore, Vellore, Tiruchirappalli and Chennai districts.

 The PSI, which is recognised by the International Labour Organisation, recently wrote to Jayalalithaa urging her to open the ?doors for talks and settle pending issues?.

 Thackeray let off in contempt case

 New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Monday 

 quashed charges of contempt of court against Shiv Sena leader 

 Balasaheb Thackeray, reports our legal correspondent.

 A three-judge bench of Justices Y.K. Sabharwal, D.M. Dharmadhikari and Tarun Chatterjee in a unanimous decision set aside a Bombay High Court order of 1997 convicting Thackeray of contempt of court for allegedly levelling bribery charges against a judge in a public speech at Mumbai?s Shivaji Park in 1996.

 The judges held that the contempt proceedings were initiated by private parties and, hence, under the Contempt of Court Act, consent from the state advocate-general should have been obtained before initiating the proceedings.

 As no consent was obtained before the petition was filed by state Congress members Harish Pimpal Khute and Mohan Prasad Tripathy, the high court had committed an error by going ahead with the contempt proceedings, the Supreme Court said.

 The high court had held Thackeray guilty of making the contemptuous remarks that a particular judge?s ?price? was Rs 35 lakh to get a favourable order. These remarks were also published in the party mouthpiece Saamna. 

 Charges against Saamna?s editor Sanjay Raut and its printer and publisher Subhash Desai were also quashed. The Supreme Court directed that the fine deposited by them be refunded. 

 AIIMS union undertaking

 New Delhi (PTI): The AIIMS Karamchari 

 Union on Monday gave an undertaking to Delhi High Court 

 that it would not disrupt the normal functioning of the 

 hospital, which had been affected by a strike by Class III 

 and IV employees since November 25.

 A division bench of Chief Justice B.C. Patel and Justice B.D. Ahmed then disposed of a public interest litigation that contended that the strike violated the right to life and was also contrary to Supreme Court directives on the subject.

 The petitioner, Sampat Kumar, had sought directives to AIIMS, the Union health secretary and the hospital union to restore normalcy in the hospital.

 However, the court clarified that the employees could give a memorandum to authorities for the redress of their grievances.

 Telgi alleges plot to poison him

Pune (PTI): The prime accused in the fake stamp paper scam, 

Abdul Karim Telgi, on Saturday alleged before a local court that there was a conspiracy 

to eliminate him by slow-poisoning.

 Telgi, who, along with 60 other accused, was produced before additional sessions judge V.V. Borikar presiding the special Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act court, alleged that he was being put through untold misery, tortured and being slow-poisoned as part of a conspiracy to eliminate him and necessary instructions should be passed to lift the lid off the ?plan?.

 Telgi said he was being kept in a cell where he could not talk to anybody. Further, despite court orders, the jail authorities, particularly the medical officer, were being ?careless? towards his health knowing well that ?my condition was not good and that I have been referred to at least 17 hospitals all over the country over a period of time?. If anything happened to him, the jail authorities should be held responsible, Telgi added.

 Earlier, Telgi?s lawyer Harshad Nimbalkar said despite court orders to provide bedding and nutritious food to the accused and to allow Telgi to talk to his mother and wife, the jail authorities were not complying. He said Telgi was an HIV patient and, therefore, the court had allowed him to be taken for regular medical check-up.

 Indians top earners in US

Washington (PTI): Indian Americans, numbering about two million, 

are the best educated and highest earners in the US, according to the US census 

bureau.

 The median family income for ?Asian Indians? (so termed to differentiate them from American Indians) in 1999 was $70,708 against $50,046 for all families in the US, according to figures of the 2000 census.

 In educational attainment, Asian Indians are top on the list. Not less than 63.9 per cent have a bachelor?s degree or more against 24.4 per cent in the total US population. Pakistanis come next with 54.3 per cent.

 Occupation-wise, 59.9 per cent Indians were in management, professional and other jobs, 7 per cent in service, 21.4 per cent in sales and office, 0.2 per cent in farming and forestry, 2.1 per cent in construction and 9.4 per cent in production, transportation and material moving.

 Considering that about 40,000 Asian Indians immigrate to the US every year, even accounting for some flow-back, the Asian Indian population in the US is easily 2 million.

 Anthem arrest after 32 years 

Akola (PTI): Fifty-six-year-old Masabkha Nawabkhan, who had 

allegedly insulted the national anthem in a cinema hall on August 1, 1972, was 

arrested on Friday following issuance of a non-bailable arrest warrant against 

him by a local court.

 The then government had issued orders for cinema viewers to stand up when the national anthem was played. But Nawabkhan, who was then 24, had defied the order, police said.

 Roshan plea

Mumbai (PTI): Film director Rakesh Roshan has made an application 

before a court to hold an in-camera deposition to record his statement in a four-year- 

old case related to an attack on him by the underworld. Roshan said being a public 

figure, his appearance at the court would attract attention and also allow his 

enemies to learn about his deposition.

 Turban ban

Chandigarh (PTI): The Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak committee 

on Friday said it would approach the UN and also send a delegation to France over 

the expulsion of three Sikh boys by French authorities for wearing turbans in 

educational institutions. Forty-three students, including the three Sikh boys, 

were expelled from their schools in France on Friday after they refused to comply 

with a new law banning religious insignia in state-run educational institutions.

 Pilgrims looted

Siliguri (PTI): Valuables and cash worth Rs 75,000 were looted 

from a group of 50 pilgrims from Sikkim, bound for Bodh Gaya, on a highway near 

Purnea in Bihar on Friday. About 25 armed criminals attacked the pilgrims? bus 

and injured one of the passengers.

 Tomb discovered

Agra (PTI): A 15th century tomb has been discovered in Mahal 

village, about three km from here. A team from the Archaeological Survey of India 

has inspected the ruins of the building in which two graves were found.

Soirees and craft shows will mark the four-day Kurukshetra 

Utsav beginning on Sunday. The festival, also known as the Gita Jayanti Samaroh, 

will open with a ballet, Krishna Leela. Singer Anup Jalota will also perform.

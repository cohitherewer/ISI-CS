 Labour ministry lines up PF talks

 New Delhi, Dec. 12 (PTI): In the first such exercise of its kind, members of the parliamentary consultative committee of the labour ministry will have on Tuesday a direct interaction with top officials of the Employees? Provident Fund Organisation, whose functioning has drawn flak from Left trade unions.

 Against the backdrop of charges of ?utter corruption? and gross mismanagement in the organisation levelled by the CPI?s trade union wing Aituc, the meeting has been convened to ?exclusively? discuss its functioning.

 The decision to hold the meeting was taken by Sis Ram Ola when he was the labour minister in the present government following suggestions by members of the consultative committee, official sources said. He had directed all the regional provident fund commissioners to be present, they added.

 The decision comes in the wake of allegations that the organisation was shielding big defaulters, mainly central public sector units.

 Aituc general secretary Gurudas Dasgupta had alleged: ?EPFO does not function and there is utter corruption since enforcement is marginal and coverage is less.?

 The meeting assumes importance in the backdrop of unions questioning the veracity of the projected accounts of the central board of trustees, which had said it would not be in a position to offer any interest over 8 per cent when faced with the demand for restoration of 9.5 per cent.

 The board of trustees, after four rounds of meeting with union representatives, employers and states, had recommended an interim 8.5 per cent for the over 4 crore provident fund beneficiaries for this year, which is yet to be ratified by the finance ministry.

 The new labour minister, K. Chandrasekhar Rao, who favours the rate of 9.5 per cent, has promised to take up the matter with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and finance minister P. Chidambaram.

 Rao has also sought finance ministry ratification of the provident fund rates for 2002-03 and 2003-04 and hinted at possible changes in the investment patterns of the organisation to fetch higher returns and in turn pass it on to the beneficiaries.

 The organisation has recovered as much as Rs 727 crore during the first six months of this fiscal, the sources said.

 Around Rs 1,862.80 crore was outstanding as employees? provident fund arrears at the end of 2003-04, they said. Of this, as much as 50 per cent was not recoverable at present owing to either court disputes or establishments having gone sick and been referred to the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction, they added.

 The minister also asked the organisation to settle the unclaimed deposit account, which has about Rs 942.95 crore as on March 31, 2004.

 In this regard, the organisation would launch a special awareness drive to inform subscribers, who have not made provident fund contribution for last three years, to settle their accounts.

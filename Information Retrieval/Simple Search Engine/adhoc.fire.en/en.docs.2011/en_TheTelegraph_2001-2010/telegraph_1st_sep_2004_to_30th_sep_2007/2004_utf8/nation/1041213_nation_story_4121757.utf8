 ?Illegal? label 

on Biju memorial

 DEBABRATA MOHANTY

 Bhubaneswar, Dec. 12: In 

 his life, Biju Patnaik courted one controversy after another 

 for his forthright views. In death as well, controversies 

 refuse to spare him.

 A civil court in Puri, where the tombstone of the late chief minister was built by the Orissa government and the Puri Municipality seven years ago, has ordered the memorial structure to be demolished, calling it illegal. 

 The court of additional (ad-hoc) judge Shyam Sundar Das on Tuesday ruled that the structure was illegal as the permanent construction would reduce the area of the Swargadwar, the holy crematorium overlooking the sea.

 The mortal remains of Biju Patnaik were consigned to flames there on July 17, 1997. Later, the Puri civic body built a 40ft x 40ft samadhi (concrete memorial) in the one-acre area of the crematorium. 

 The place has been a must-visit for chief minister Naveen Patnaik, who pays his homage to his father every time he starts out on a political assignment.

 The construction of the memorial was first challenged by Ramesh Prasad Singh, a lawyer of Puri, and three others in the court of the civil judge (junior division) in 1999. Singh alleged that since there were no other permanent memorials in that area, it should be demolished. In 2002, judge Rohitlal Panda declared the construction illegal. Following the court?s order, the civic body appealed before the fast-track court of the additional (ad-hoc) judge, which upheld the lower court?s order.

 ?There are so many places in Puri. If it?s Biju Patnaik today, then tomorrow there could be such memorials of former chief minister J.B. Patnaik and Nandini Satpathy. The area would be choked to death,? said an exultant Singh.

 But the Biju Janata Dal, the party that borrows its name from the legendary politician, does not seem to be in a mood to challenge the order in the high court. Stung by an adverse judgment by a division bench of the high court over a controversial mining deal last month, Naveen, sources said, is against taking on the judiciary. 

 ?We will respect the order of the court. Bijubabu is surely not above the law. We will find a new place for the memorial,? said Narendra Swain, general secretary of the BJD.

 Swargadwar, according to Hindu religious texts, is the stairway to heaven. Nearly 15 bodies are cremated here every day. Scholars have written that the place came into existence in 4th century BC.

 Swindle shadow on donations: survey

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Nov. 8: A large chunk of Muslim philanthropic donations ? zakaat (poor-rate) ? is siphoned off annually in India.

 The latest study on Muslim philanthropic behaviour in Kozhikode in Kerala, Murshidabad and North 24-Parganas in Bengal, Surat and Jamnagar in Gujarat and Bijnore in Uttar Pradesh has come up with startling revelations: approximately, 60 to 70 per cent of zakaat funds are drained off by the very people who are supposed to collect them. 

 In India, more than 30 per cent of the over Rs 20-crore annual charity is given out by women alone. Only a fraction of it trickles down to orphans, widows and the poor who are entitled to receive it. 

 Delhi-based sociologist Imtiaz Ahmad, who conducted the study, said zakaat forms the core of the Islamic faith. It comes in league with the other four pillars of Islam: tauhid (belief in oneness of God), namaaz (prayers), roza (fasting) and haj (religious pilgrimage). 

 Zakaat is binding on all Muslims who earn reasonably well. The calculations are based on a donation of 2.5 per cent of the total assets or Re 1 out of every Rs 40 earned.

 Ahmad, who is part of a global research team that conducted similar studies in Turkey, Egypt, the UK and Indonesia, said he was dismayed by the findings in India. 

 ?Most of the zakaat amount goes into individuals? pockets,? he said, pointing out that safirs ? those who go from door to door to collect zakaat on behalf of Muslim madarsas and institutions ? are the biggest culprits.

 There are several mechanisms to siphon off charity money, Ahmad said. While one practice was not to deposit the collections to madarsas, another was to use the money for construction of mosques and madarsa buildings, as well as to pay salaries to staff.

 Claiming this was against the spirit of zakaat, he said: ?Zakaat is supposed to be given only to the poor, orphans, widows and the under-privileged.? 

 Ahmad said he would be publishing the report as a book early next year. ?It will be called The Philanthropic Behaviour of Muslims in India.? 

 The former Jawaharlal Nehru University professor said in many Islamic societies across the world, zakaat funds are managed by the state. ?They use zakaat judiciously by state-run apparatus,? he said, adding that Turkey was a ?good example?.

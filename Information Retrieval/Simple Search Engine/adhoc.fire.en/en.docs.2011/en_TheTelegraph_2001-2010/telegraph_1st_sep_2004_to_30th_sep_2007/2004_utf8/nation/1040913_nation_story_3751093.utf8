 Tibet firm on tact

 MANJEET SEHGAL WARRIOR

 Dalai Lama

 Shimla, Sept. 12: The Tibetan government-in-exile has decided to stick to its ?middle- way approach? to cement relations with China and continue to raise its voice at international level for a resolution of the Tibet problem.

 A resolution to ?review? the approach ? which espouses peaceful means towards attaining freedom ? was rejected by 21 votes in the 46-strong Tibetan parliament, called the Assembly of the Tibetan People?s Deputies.

 Fourteen deputies, who along with the others represent major regions of Tibet, were not present.

 The decision to undertake a ?review? was made at the Assembly?s previous session, provided Beijing failed to take appropriate steps by March 2005 on the issue of Tibet.

 The ?review? was, however, taken up at the Assembly?s ongoing 10-day session after China formally invited two high-profile envoys of the Dalai Lama to talks. Lodi Gyaltsen Gyari and Kelsang Gyaltsen left for Beijing today.

 The resolution on the ?review? was rejected on September 9, the first day of the Assembly?s current session.

 ?Tibetans are of the view that reviewing of middle-way approach would undermine the authority of the Dalai Lama,? an official spokesperson said at Dharamsala.

 The government-in-exile had re-established direct contact with Beijing in September 2002, resuming dialogue after nine years. Envoys were again sent to Beijing in May-June, 2003, to push the talks forward.

 However, on May 23, 2003, Beijing released a white paper on the issue in ?harsh? language. Officials of the Central Tibetan Administration, a department of the exiled government, said China then delayed a third visit by envoys.

 But some positive indications were noticed later, culminating in the formal invite.

 In his address on September 9, the Dalai Lama said: ?As a leader, I have a responsibility to work towards resolving the issue of Tibet. I consider promotion of human values and religious harmony my duty. I will continue performing it till my last breath, whether in exile or after the issue is resolved.?

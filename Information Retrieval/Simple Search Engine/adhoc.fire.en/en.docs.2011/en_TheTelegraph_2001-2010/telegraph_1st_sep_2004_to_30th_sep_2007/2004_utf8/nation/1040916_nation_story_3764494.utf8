 ?Dead? man shoves SBI into corner

 New Delhi, Sept. 15 (PTI): Three years after A.S. Arunachalam found that his State Bank of India locker declared him ?deceased?, the apex consumer court has found the bank ?deficient? in service.

 Arunachalam, 66, had hired safe-deposit locker number A-31 in 1966 and paid the annual rent regularly. On June 6, 2001, he went to the bank to operate the locker and found a sticker on it that said ?A-31 deceased?.

 A shocked Arunachalam decided against operating the locker that day and made an entry to that effect in the locker access register. He demanded to know from the bank why the sticker was pasted. The bank not only refused an explanation but also rejected his request to see the rest of the entries in the register, saying it was a confidential document.

 After a prolonged fight from the district to the apex level, the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission said: ?The bank has made no effort whatsoever in explaining at any stage as to how this sticker got pasted on the locker.... This sticker certainly created mental shock and agony to the complainant.... To that extent, it (the bank) is certainly deficient in service.?

 The commission also directed the bank to permit Arunachalam to see the locker access register or provide him an extract of its entries to check if his locker was operated by anyone else.

 The panel noted he had not operated the locker from May 5, 1998, till June 6, 2001, though he had regularly visited the bank to pay the charges.

 ?There is every justification for him to find out as to whether anyone else has operated the locker during the three-year period, especially when the sticker on the locker says he is dead,? said commission chief Justice M.B. Shah and member Rajyalakshmi Rao.

 The commission told SBI to pay Arunachalam Rs 5,000 in litigation cost and also ordered opening of the locker in the presence of the customer and an impartial observer.

 Arunachalam had first filed a complaint with the district consumers forum, which held the bank guilty of deficiency in service and asked it to pay Rs 25,000 compensation and Rs 2,000 in litigation cost.

 The SBI appealed to the state panel, which set aside the forum?s order, saying the bank was not deficient in service as there was no evidence of anyone tampering with the locker.

 Arunachalam then approached the national commission, which overruled the state panel?s order. It said that obviously someone other than Arunachalam had pasted the sticker on his locker. ?If it is done by a bank employee, it is for the bank to clearly and properly explain the circumstances, especially when the bank is such a renowned organisation as the State Bank of India.?

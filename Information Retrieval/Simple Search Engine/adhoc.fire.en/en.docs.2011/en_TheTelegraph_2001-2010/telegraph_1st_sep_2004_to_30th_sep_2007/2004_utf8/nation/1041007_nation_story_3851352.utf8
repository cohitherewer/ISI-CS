 Roerich centenary on disputed estate

 B.R. SRIKANTH 

 Roerich

 Bangalore, Oct. 6: For connoisseurs of art, a landmark in the form of an international heritage centre will be unveiled during the birth centenary celebrations of painter and orientologist Svetoslav Roerich here between October 17 and 27. 

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will participate in the finale on October 27. An entourage from Russia, comprising senior representatives of the government, artists and friends of Roerich and his wife Devika Rani will participate in a variety of programmes scheduled at their sprawling Tataguni estate on the outskirts of Bangalore. 

 Ahead of the centenary, the Karnataka government is renovating the bungalow and the tombs of the couple. A museum and an art gallery on the 486-acre estate, too, are on the cards. A vintage car of the couple ? a 1948 Chevrolet Fleet Master Sedan ? has been overhauled for display at the estate. 

 The car was rotting at a city police station for over a decade and a half because of litigation over the ownership of the Roerichs? estate, paintings and artefacts, official sources said. 

 The sources said ?we are going to take the works of Dr Roerich across to all districts in Karnataka to give people in rural areas a glimpse of his paintings and artefacts. Senior artists will attend a workshop on the lawns of the estate as part of the festivities. An exchange programme for artists of both countries will be another feature of the centenary?. 

 The state government recently received approval for the festivities from a Constitution bench of the Supreme Court. Nonetheless, the shadow of a long-drawn litigation over the legacy of the Roerichs would loom over the centenary. The wills (at least six have been produced in court), naming former secretary Mary Joyce Poonacha as heir to the legacy, have been contested by the Karnataka government. 

 The government has also moved the Supreme Court for an early hearing of its plea to vacate the stay issued by the apex court two years ago on acquisition of the Tataguni Estate. 

 ?We have moved an application for an early hearing in view of the celebrations planned for Dr Roerich?s centenary. The court has allowed the government to protect and maintain the estate. We have a lot of plans to develop the estate into a museum and art gallery,? chief secretary K.K. Misra said. 

 In 2002, Karnataka High Court had allowed the state government to take over the estate, paintings, jewellery and artefacts of the couple through the Roerich and Devika Rani Roerich Estate (Acquisition and Transfer) Act. 

 Another legal battle is on in the lower courts against Mary, her husband Anil and his friend B.M. Nandakumar. Bangalore police have charged the trio with cheating and forgery of wills that surfaced after the death of the celebrity couple. They were arrested in 1994 but released as they had secured anticipatory bail from the city sessions court. 

 The wills were investigated after Mary?s brother-in-law, R. Devadas, filed a complaint claiming that he held the power of attorney for Devika Rani. Mary was charged with misappropriating funds up to Rs 2.5 crore. 

 Among the artefacts seized from her were the original begging bowl of Buddha, several gold necklaces, gold coins with French, Russian and Bulgarian markings, antique idols, gold bangles, antique gold spoons, pearl necklaces, ear studs of precious stones, ankle chains, animal hides, paintings and two revolvers.

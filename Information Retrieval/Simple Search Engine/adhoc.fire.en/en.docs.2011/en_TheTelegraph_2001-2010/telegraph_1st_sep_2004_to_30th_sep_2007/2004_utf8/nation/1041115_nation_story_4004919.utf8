 Minority status for Jains in sight

 R. VENKATARAMAN

 New Delhi, Nov. 14: Jains are set to get ?minority status? after the Centre moved to promulgate a minority institutions? ordinance this week.

 ?Jains are recognised as a minority in some states but not nationally. The ordinance, by recognising their education institutions as minority ones, will also accord minority status to them,? central government officials said on Friday.

 The officials said the ordinance, which will nationally recognise Jains as a minority, also does away with ?obstacles? that the previous National Democratic Alliance government had created for madarsas such as the need for police verification.

 NDA members such as the BJP and the Shiv Sena as well as Sangh parivar outfits had waged a sustained campaign, alleging that madarsas were the ?breeding ground? for ?Islamic terrorism?.

 ?It may be recalled that in Uttar Pradesh, madarsas were to get a police clearance certificate. Now this would be also removed in the new ordinance,? a central government official said.

 On Thursday, the Union cabinet decided to promulgate an ordinance giving minority institutions the right to run educational institutions of their choice. 

 Some minority institutions run private medical, engineering and other professional colleges.

 The ordinance allows the government to have at least ?indirect? control over the ?huge mass? of funds that religious organisations have access to.

 The ordinance seeks to affiliate minority educational institutions to mainstream universities. 

 ?Thus, once the official affiliation is done, the money with these religious trusts would come under the scrutiny and regulation of the affiliating institution or university so that indirectly, government control over the finances of such religious trusts would be enforced,? the official said.

 ?The government will not directly control finances of these religious trusts, but the affiliating universities and institutions would have overall and general regulation of the finance of the minority educational institutions,? he said.

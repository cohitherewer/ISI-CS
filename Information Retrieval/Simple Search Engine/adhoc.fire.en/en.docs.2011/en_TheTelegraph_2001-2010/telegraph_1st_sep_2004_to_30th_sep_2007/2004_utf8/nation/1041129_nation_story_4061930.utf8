 UN hopes soar on Singh non-aligned signal

 K.P. NAYAR

 New York, Nov. 28: After eight long years, India is back in business at the UN. As the 59th General Assembly copes with an unusually heavy agenda here in the context of unprecedented challenges to multilateralism in the backdrop of the Iraq war, there is new respect for New Delhi in the corridors of the UN, unseen since India?s disastrous defeat in the election to the Security Council on October 21, 1996.

 India?s stunning victory last month in elections to the Economic and Social Council (Ecosoc), in which it was just 17 votes short of a unanimous choice by the entire international community, has come as a shot in the arm for New Delhi?s case for permanent membership of the UN Security Council.

 India topped the list of countries elected to four Asian seats in Ecosoc with 174 votes from among the UN?s 191 members, scoring over China and leaving Pakistan way behind.

 This is the first major election that India has fought in eight years during which it had cold feet resulting from the mere 42 votes it got for the Security Council seat against Japan?s 142 in a UN then made up of 182 members.

 UN diplomats attribute the change in India?s fortunes in the world body to a return to non-aligned values being signalled by the Manmohan Singh government and renewed interest in the Third World.

 There was a perception here in the last decade that India had turned its back on its traditional friends and allies, cosying up instead to big powers and seeking strong alliances in the West.

 During his visit to New York in September, Prime Minister Singh attempted a course correction, stressing the Nehruvian roots of India?s external affairs, while his aides went that extra mile during the General Assembly to reach out to the non-aligned after a long gap.

 In the campaign for the Ecosoc seat, India?s new permanent representative to the UN, Nirupam Sen, optimised the view here of the United Progressive Alliance government that its assumption of office marks the return to India?s traditional alliance with the less privileged countries of the globe.

 In this effort, Sen was helped by his reputation as a campaigner for such policies and a liberal throughout his diplomatic career spanning 35 years. 

 In recent speeches to the Security Council and elsewhere in the UN, Sen emphasised such beliefs to the delight of the majority of UN?s membership.

 Sen has never done UN work before his posting here; but the campaign for Ecosoc showed that he was not, therefore, hamstrung by the ways of diplomats who have been dealing with the UN.

 For instance, following in the footsteps of politicians in New Delhi ? and President George W. Bush, of late ? Sen held an iftar for ambassadors of Muslim countries to the UN for the first time in the history of India?s permanent mission to the UN.

 A win in the contest for Ecosoc was crucial to Indian diplomacy because the failure to fight elections and a tendency in South Block to play a low-key role in the world body since 1996 had eroded India?s presence in UN agencies both in country presence and in Indians holding important UN jobs.

 The election was important also because of the resistance within South Block to forget the spectre of defeat in 1996, without which India will never make it to the Security Council. 

 The ministry of external affairs had since 1996 resisted efforts to field Indian candidates at key UN elections.

 Indeed, not long ago, Indian ambassadors in western Europe had collectively written to South Block arguing that India should not field candidates for any poll in the UN unless victory was guaranteed by a two-thirds majority.

 All this had made the Indian mission to the UN redundant and without purpose in many ways. 

 The latest victory marks a crossing of the proverbial Rubicon.

 As New Delhi intensifies its bid jointly with Japan, Germany and Brazil for a permanent seat in the Security Council, the margin of victory in the Ecosoc poll has convinced General Assembly members that India does have wide support in the community of nations.

 A two-thirds vote is needed for election to permanent membership of the Security Council, a figure of support now demonstrated by India.

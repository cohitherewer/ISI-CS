 IOC refinery blast

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Ahmedabad, Oct. 29: A powerful explosion in the main reactor of the Indian Oil Corporation refinery rocked Vadodara early this morning, injuring 16 people.

 The blast, which occurred at 3.30 am, was so powerful that it could be heard miles away and filled the sky with smoke.

 The injured were taken to hospital where all except three were discharged after first aid.

 The damage caused by the blast is estimated at several hundred crores. 

 District collector Bhagyesh Jha, who is also chairman of the state?s emergency disaster management cell, rushed to the refinery situated on the outskirts of the city.

 ?The cause of the explosion is not known,? said the district collector. Jha said he was awaiting the report of technical experts studying the explosion that ruptured the boiler. 

 All the 16 injured were labourers. Only six of them were regular Indian Oil employees, while the rest are on contract. 

 The reactor had shut down for maintenance for a long time and had resumed operation only yesterday. 

 The refinery?s chief executive officer was out of station at the time of the mishap.

 An IOC statement said: ?The blast resulted in a fire in the cracking unit. The fire was controlled by 5.30 am. There was no casualty. The labourers suffered minor injuries.??

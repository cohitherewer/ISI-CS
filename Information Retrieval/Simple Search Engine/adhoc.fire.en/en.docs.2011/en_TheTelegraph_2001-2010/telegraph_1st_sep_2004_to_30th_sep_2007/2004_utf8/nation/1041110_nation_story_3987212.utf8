 Ranbaxy AIDS drugs off UN list

 Geneva (Reuters): Ranbaxy, the country?s largest pharmaceutical company, has taken off all its anti-AIDS drugs off the UN?s approved list, the World Health Organisation said on Tuesday, dealing a blow to efforts to make cheaper medicines more widely available for the scrounge.

 The UN?s health agency said the company took the step voluntarily after discovering ?discrepancies? in tests done to show the antiretrovirals were equivalent to brand-name drugs.

 The Geneva-based agency had already announced in August that it was dropping three generic HIV/AIDS drugs produced by the firm. ?Ranbaxy Laboratories Limited has informed the World Health Organisation that it is voluntarily withdrawing all its antiretrovirals,? the WHO said.

 But the agency added that the Indian firm had said it planned to submit new studies of the seven drugs, which could see them re-admitted to the list, with the first such study expected to be finished by next month.

 Following the problems detected by Ranbaxy, the WHO said it wrote to all manufacturers of listed HIV/AIDS medicines, urging them to check the data they had submitted.

 Breather for porn actor

 Jammu: Her dream was to become a big 

 screen star and the men, she believed, held the keys.

 The bubble burst when police moved in last week to bust the sex-and-sleaze racket that the former Miss Jammu had got sucked into.

 Anara Gupta on Tuesday repeated her story in a court, which granted her bail on the condition that she would not leave Jammu and Kashmir till investigations into the pornographic CD case were over. Jammu chief judicial magistrate Sanjiv Gupta told her to cooperate with investigators and also stay off interactions with the media.

 The media had blown the lid off her role in the CDs that were in circulation in the city and its neighbourhood. Anara had added to the grime by telling how she landed in the flesh trade and named some high officials, politicians, businessmen and even journalists.

 In her candid admission before reporters, Anara did not underplay the role of her ambition that led her astray. ?I wanted to be a big star and I have paid the price,? she said.

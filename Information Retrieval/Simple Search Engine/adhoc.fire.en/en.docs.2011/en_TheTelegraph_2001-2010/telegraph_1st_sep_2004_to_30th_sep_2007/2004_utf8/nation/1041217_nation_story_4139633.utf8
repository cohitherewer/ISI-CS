 Laloo keeps Cong waiting

 KAY BENEDICT

 New Delhi, Dec. 16: With less than two months left for the Assembly elections in Bihar, railway minister and RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav is playing truant with ally Congress. 

 Much to the discomfiture of the Congress, he has not made himself available for talks with the Bihar unit or the party?s high command. 

 The Congress? Bihar in-charge, Harikesh Bahadur, and the state party president, Ramjatan Sinha, who met Sonia Gandhi on Tuesday, were apparently told to wait a few more days for the electoral strategy to be worked out.

 Sources said Laloo Prasad, who has made himself scarce for the Congress, has almost finalised the seats for the RJD.

 RJD insiders say it is part of his strategy to keep the Congress waiting till the last so that it is not in a position to bargain for a large chunk of seats.

 After his meeting with the Congress president, Sinha told The Telegraph that the party has identified 125 winnable seats out of 243. But he declined to say how many seats the Congress is demanding from Laloo Prasad. An internal survey had named 161 seats where the Congress was in a ?strong position?.

 Sinha said the party has yet to take a decision on whether or not to align with the RJD. ?We had an alliance with the RJD for the Lok Sabha elections. As for the Assembly, we have yet to take a decision,? he said. 

 As Laloo Prasad is keeping everyone guessing, there is a lurking suspicion among Bihar Congress leaders that he may be wanting the Congress to go it alone as a division of upper caste votes between the NDA and Congress will benefit the RJD.

 Sources said Laloo Prasad is sticking to the Lok Sabha formula, when the Congress was offered four out of 42 seats. According to this ratio, the Congress can expect 24 seats (one Lok Sabha seat is equal to six Assembly seats). 

 Congress sources said it agreed to the offer then in its eagerness not to divide the anti-BJP votes. 

 The party is unlikely to accept 24 seats this time and is in a mood for hard bargain. Party sources said it would pitch for anything between 50 and 60 seats. 

 Congress insiders feel the party?s prospects have improved vastly in Bihar after the United Progressive Alliance government came to power. Now, it also has the option of sewing an alliance with Ram Vilas Paswan.

 Bhubaneswar, Dec. 29: Three days after the tsunami strike, people in Orissa are still waiting to hear from their family members working in the affected areas of the country. 

 As the toll continues to rise, the fate of 35 Oriyas from Kendrapara district ? who used to work in the tsunami-hit Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Tamil Nadu, AndhraPradesh and Kerala ? is yet to be known.

 The families of 10 people from Pattamundai block of the district, working as plumbers in the Andamans, are frantically trying to contact their loved ones. 

 Dibakar Pradhan, whose son Mayadhar works in Port Blair, is praying hard for his son?s safety. Similarly, family members of Gagan Das, Sanjiv Behera, Nimai Charan Dash and Nakul Parida are worried over their fate. These people from Orissa worked in Chennai and Kanyakumari.

 Behera worked in a sea-side hotel at Kanyakumari. His father Sandhan Behera has not heard about his son since Sunday, Nakul Parida of Mandapada village worked in a fish processing unit at Chennai and is believed to be missing.

 Similarly, the family members of Pitambar Das in the Panpana area of Balasore have no idea about the whereabouts of Gagan. Besides, there is no news of several Oriya people who worked at the air force base in Car Nicobar. The airbase has been washed away by the marauding waves.

 Special relief commissioner R. Balakrishnan said 92 of the 97 families from Rourkela who had gone to the Andamans to spend the winter holidays, have come back safely. He expressed hope that the rest would reach Rourkela soon. 

 Concerned over possible cancellation of hotel bookings, Orissa tourism minister Suryo Narayan Patro has declared that tourist resorts in the state have not been affected by the natural disaster. 

 ?The killer waves have mercifully spared Orissa. All tourist locations in the state are totally safe,? he said.

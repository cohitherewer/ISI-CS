 Apex court clarifies retrial rule

 R. VENKATARAMAN

 New Delhi, Nov. 24: The Supreme Court today said fresh recording of evidence in every criminal case is not possible and the principle of retrial, followed in the ?extraordinary? Gujarat riot cases, could be applied only rarely.

 The ruling came in a case of abetting suicide of one Kana Banerjee in Calcutta in 1995 in which the high court had ordered retrial of her husband and in-laws ? which was to begin afresh ? after a trial court had acquitted the accused.

 The high court had based its order on the apex court?s directive in the Gujarat riots cases, especially the Best Bakery case which was ordered to be tried ?de novo? or afresh.

 Banerjee, who was ?found dead? on October 25, 1995, had left a suicide note in which she spoke of her ?illicit relationship? with another man and noted that she could not deceive her husband for long. She also said she was lucky to get such a husband and that her father should treat him well and arrange for his second marriage after her death.

 However, an FIR was lodged charging her husband and mother-in-law with abetting the suicide. But the trial court acquitted them. On appeal, the high court ordered retrial as the allegation was that Banerjee?s husband and mother-in-law ?increased their torture on her?.

 When the accused appealed to the Supreme Court, a bench of Justices Y.K. Sabharwal and D.M. Dharmadhikari ruled that the evidence recorded in the case could not be erased even if a retrial has been ordered by the high court.

 The bench said the ?trial judge has to decide the case on the basis of the evidence already on record and the additional evidence would be recorded on retrial?.

 The judges said the retrial order in the Best Bakery and other riot cases was necessary as they were ?extraordinary? and in which the ?entire prosecution machinery was trying to shield the accused?.

 ?The witnesses were terrified and intimidated to keep them away from the court. It is in the aforesaid extraordinary circumstances that the court not only directed a de novo trial of the whole case but made further directions for appointment of new prosecutor,? the judges said.

 ?The law laid down in the Best Bakery case in the aforesaid extraordinary circumstances cannot be applied to all cases against the established principles of criminal jurisprudence,? they added.

 Boost for Haj pilgrims

 ALOKE TIKKU

 New Delhi, Sept. 15: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has backed a demand to reverse the earlier government?s decision to impose conditions on Haj pilgrims aimed at eventually reducing the number of beneficiaries.

 The NDA government, which had introduced these conditions last December, barred income-tax payers from availing the subsidised air travel and made it mandatory for them to stick to arrangements made by the central Haj committee. 

 The government also said it would only offer subsidy to pilgrims who are on their first visit.

 Congress president Sonia Gandhi had written to then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee requesting him to put in abeyance the new rules that had created ?intense distress? to the pilgrims till the matter was reviewed in consultation with the Opposition. The rules had also led to an Opposition walkout after the government refused to reconsider its decision.

 Minister of state for home Sriprakash Jaiswal, who met Singh today, returned with the assurance that the government would waive the new conditions and restore the pre-2003 status, but added that the formal decision will be taken by the Union cabinet.

 Jaiswal, who was reminded about the conditions by some religious leaders when he visited Lucknow last week, said he had been promised that all amendments to the Haj regulations made by the BJP-led government would be reversed.

 Nearly 1.2 lakh Indians undertake the pilgrimage every year, 72,000 through the Haj committee, costing the civil aviation ministry about Rs 200 crore in subsidy to Air-India and Indian Airlines for the Haj charters.

 A similar amount has been allocated in the budget this year, too. Jaiswal said he was confident that the cabinet decision would come before the process of receiving applications from prospective Haj pilgrims begins in a few months.

 Jaiswal said the bar on income-tax payers was unfair as it required everyone with an income of over Rs 1.1 lakh to pay the full fare of about Rs 32,000. ?They may not be able to afford it,? he said, dismissing suggestions that the income restrictions allowed the subsidy to be targeted at the economically weak.

 Beaches empty

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA 

 Hyderabad, Dec. 30: Half-eaten food, empty beer bottles and crowds running helter-skelter.

 Just when tsunami-battered Andhra Pradesh had started picking up the pieces, a fresh alert threw its coastal districts into frenzy.

 Year-end revellers on the Visakhapatnam beach fled leaving their food and drinks behind at sea-shore restaurants, which in turn were left with unpaid bills.

 ?My customers vanished without paying the bills. So did my cooks and other workers,? said Gopinath Rao, who runs a bar and restaurant. 

 District authorities across the state have sent out a warning to relief officials to ensure fishermen do not venture into the sea for another 48 hours. Krishna district collector Prabhakar Reddy said: ?All the relief camps will run for another day till the situation normalises.?

 Officials have been asked to keep the campaign low key so that the tourism industry is not hit by adverse publicity. ?Already, the state has lost tourist trade worth over Rs 120 crore since Sunday. About 3,700 tourists from Bengal alone have cancelled their trips,? said state tourism secretary S.P. Singh.

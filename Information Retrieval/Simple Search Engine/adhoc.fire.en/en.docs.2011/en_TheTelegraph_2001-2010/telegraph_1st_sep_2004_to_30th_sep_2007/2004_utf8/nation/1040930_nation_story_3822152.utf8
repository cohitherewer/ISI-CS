 Kerala govt office ?siege?

 was hampered on Wednesday as Opposition Left Democratic

 against the government?s ?anti-people? policies. 

 Reports from districts said attendance in most offices was thin as the protesters converged in large numbers and squatted on roads near the offices from early morning. Functioning of the collectorates in the northern districts of Kasargode, Kannur, Kozhikode and Palakkad came to a near standstill.

The police kept one of the secretariat gates free of agitators to keep the way clear for ministers and their personal staff who turned up for work.

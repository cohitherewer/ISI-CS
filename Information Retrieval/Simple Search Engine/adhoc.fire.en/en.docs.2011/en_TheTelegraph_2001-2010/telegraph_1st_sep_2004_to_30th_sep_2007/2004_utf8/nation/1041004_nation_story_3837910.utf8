 Naga group in culprit hunt

 NISHIT DHOLABHAI

 Dimapur, Oct. 3: Blaming a ?non-Naga? outfit and its ?Naga ally? for the simultaneous blasts at Dimapur railway station and a nearby market, the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isak-Muivah) today announced a reward of Rs 5 lakh for information leading to the capture of the culprits.

 The militant group said it had already constituted a special commission to investigate the incident and submit a report to the organisation?s top leadership within a month. 

 The NSCN (I-M), which considers Dimapur its stronghold, claimed the blasts were triggered by rivals to sabotage the peace process with Delhi. In a statement to a television channel earlier in the day, it said ?neighbours? were involved in both incidents.

 NSCN (I-M) deputy kilonser of information and publicity Kraibo Chawang, however, declined to name any militant group of Assam ? the Ulfa, the National Democratic Front of Boroland (NDFB) or the Dima Halam Daoga ? as the culprit. He said the outfit was certain who masterminded the blasts, but it was ?too early? to name the group(s).

 Almost immediately after the blasts yesterday, the NSCN (Khaplang) and the Federal Government of Nagaland, which is the militant wing of the Adinno Phizo-led Naga National Council, accused the Isak-Muivah group of masterminding the incidents.

 The Ulfa, one of the militant groups suspected of having a hand in the incidents, is known to be close to the NSCN (K). The Naga group provided asylum to Ulfa members in Myanmar after Bhutan launched a military operation last year to flush out militant groups from its territory. Leaders of the Khaplang group admitted they were assisting the Ulfa, but reiterated the group would never be party to any act of subversion that endangers the lives of innocents.

 The NDFB, too, is on the list of suspects. One of its leaders was killed in Nagaland by security forces last week and today is its ?raising day?.

 An NSCN (I-M) functionary said his organisation would investigate the twin blasts and punish the culprits ?faster than Indian? agencies?.

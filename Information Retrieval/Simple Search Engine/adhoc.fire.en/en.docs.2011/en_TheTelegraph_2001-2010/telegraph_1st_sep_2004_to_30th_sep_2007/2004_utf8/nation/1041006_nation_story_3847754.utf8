 Sonia, Pawar meet on dais

 CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA 

 Nashik, Oct. 5: For the first time after the Lok Sabha polls, Sonia Gandhi and Sharad Pawar addressed a public meeting together on the second day of her Maharashtra tour.

 The Nationalist Congress Party chief and Sonia presented a pretty picture of solidarity, sitting side by side, flanked by chief minister Sushil Kumar Shinde and Republican Party of India (A) president Ramdas Athvale.

 The Congress chief and the Maharashtra leader complemented each other?s speeches, though they did not refer to each other individually. Sonia spoke Pawar?s language, too ? rounding off her speech in much-improved Hindi with a neat Marathi phrase: ?Agharila vore dya (Vote for the alliance).?

 This was also Sonia?s concluding rally in this leg of the Maharashtra campaign. She started her campaign from Vidarbha yesterday as the region demanded the foremost attention for its push for statehood and the drought deaths that occurred there. But the ruling alliance reserved Nashik for the Sonia-Pawar joint appearance as this holy town of temples and the Kumbh Mela has been the traditional starting point for the Congress? state campaigns.

 Sonia began on an auspicious note, addressing Nashik as ?Dharm ki dharti, karm ki dharti? and launched a veiled attack on Uma Bharti?s tiranga yatra and a frontal one on the Shiv Sena-BJP alliance and advocated the Congress as a champion of the poor and the disenfranchised. 

 ?For eight years, the Congress was out of power at the Centre. In these years, the BJP-Sena alliance tried to turn the tides of history. They introduced wrong notions of history in schools and colleges. There was corruption. The common man felt ignored. There was unemployment among the youth. The will of the nation was weakened,? she said. ?But the Lok Sabha verdict changed all that.?

 Without referring to Uma, the Congress chief said: ?One does not become a patriot just by waving a flag or taking its name. The tiranga is in every Indian?s heart. One does not show respect to it by just taking its name.? 

 Sonia added that if voted to power, the Congress would address the common man?s issues. It would look at the farmer?s problems like power and water, the youth?s issues like unemployment and focus on the development of the weaker sections of the society.

 Pawar slammed the ?hypocrisy? of the BJP-Sena, saying that since the Sena had a power minister at the Centre (Suresh Prabhu), it had no right to criticise the power situation in the state now.

 The Sena and the BJP have made the power cuts in the state one of their main campaign planks. They have also promised free power to farmers ? a pledge duplicated in the Congress-NCP manifesto.

 The NCP chief added that at the grassroots level, it was not names of BJP leaders .K. Advani and Pramod Mahajan that were famous, but those of the Gandhis and Nehrus.

 New Delhi, Dec. 7: After leading an armed movement for decades, Naga militant leaders Isak Chisi Swu and Thuingaleng Muivah today told Prime Minister Manmohan Singh that they had come to believe that ?a solution cannot be found in violence and blood?.

 Singh reciprocated by assuring the NSCN (I-M)?s collective leadership that he wanted a ?mutually acceptable and honourable solution that can ensure that the Naga people live a life of peace with dignity and self-respect?.

 The Prime Minister is understood to have also acknowledged the NSCN (I-M)?s commitment to a peaceful resolution of the conflict and conveyed his government?s preparedness to walk the extra mile for a peaceful solution. 

 The discussions were the first in a series of meetings that the NSCN (I-M) leaders ? Swu is the outfit?s chairman and Muivah its general secretary ? will have with the political leadership during their weeklong stay in New Delhi. The duo met Union home minister Shivraj Patil shortly after emerging from the meeting with the Prime Minister.

 They will meet Congress president Sonia Gandhi, defence minister Pranab Mukherjee and former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee before leaving for Nagaland. 

 Admitting to being ?extremely impressed? by Singh?s sincerity, the Naga leaders said the Prime Minister?s wisdom was reflected in his invitation to them for a dialogue. 

 Swu is said to have pointed out that though the Nagas once suffered under Congress rule, nobody could overlook the fact that the first ceasefire the insurgent leadership entered into was with a Congress government in the 1960s. The second peace initiative, which resulted in the ceasefire that has continued for seven years now, was also by the Congress government led by P.V. Narasimha Rao, he said.

 The NSCN (I-M) leadership told the Prime Minister that the Nagas had only heard the sound of guns for 50 years and were desperate for peace. ?Now that the government of India has invited them for a peaceful dialogue, do they not have the right to be happy? The Nagas are happy that the government is sincere in trying to find a peaceful negotiated settlement.?

 Another senior NSCN (I-M) leader, V.S. Atem, clarified that discussions on ?substantive issues? had not begun yet. 

 ?There have been no discussions on autonomy. We are not discussing autonomy ? that question does not arise,? a spokesperson for the outfit said later. ?We have submitted our proposals and in the intensive dialogue that will follow, we will discuss each of them threadbare to arrive at a peaceful and mutually acceptable solution.?

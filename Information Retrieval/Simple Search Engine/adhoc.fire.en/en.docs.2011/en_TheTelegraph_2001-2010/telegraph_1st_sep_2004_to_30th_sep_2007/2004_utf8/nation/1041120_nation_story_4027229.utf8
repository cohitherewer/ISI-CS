 Thorns cleared for PM visit

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 19: Delhi set the ball rolling for a review of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act and the implementation of the 1985 Assam Accord on the eve of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh?s visit to Manipur and Assam.

 Under instructions from the Prime Minister?s Office, North Block got down to constituting a committee to review the armed forces act ? the cause of the crisis in Manipur ? and drawing up a strategy to evaluate the implementation of the Assam accord, specifically the process of identifying and deporting illegal migrants from the state.

 Officials said the announcement on the accord had had the desired effect, a reference to the All Assam Students? Union withdrawing its opposition to Singh?s visit.

 The AASU had planned to disrupt the Prime Minister?s visit to the state, beginning Sunday, in protest against the government?s alleged inaction against infiltrators from Bangladesh and Delhi?s decision to retain the Illegal Migrants (Determination by Tribunals) Act.

 A spokesperson for the Union home ministry reiterated the United Progressive Alliance government?s commitment to implementing the Assam accord, which was the culmination of a mass anti-migrant movement initiated and led by the AASU. He said the implementation of the tripartite agreement would be reviewed by the three signatories to the accord.

 Hospital strike on blacklist

 MONOBINA GUPTA 

 New Delhi, Dec. 21: The Union health minister today came out strongly against shutdowns in hospitals and found unexpected support from an MP who backs the right to strike for government employees.

 ?Hospital employees have no right to go on strike even for one hour,? Anbumani Ramadoss said today in the Lok Sabha during a discussion relating to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences. ?We will take a strong view of the strikers. They could be doctors or (other) employees,? he added.

 The discussion related to the AIIMS management?s dismissal of 17 employees who had gone on an indefinite strike last month protesting against the death of a staffer?s son in the emergency ward.

 ?Nobody has a right to go on an indefinite strike in hospitals. It could be a serious risk to the lives of the patients,? Ramadoss said.

 CPI parliamentarian Gurudas Dasgupta said hospital doctors and employees should not be allowed to strike work because hospitals were not ?factories? where people could stop production for a whole day. Dasgupta, also general secretary of the All India Trade Union Congress, emphasised that advocating trade union protest did not mean indiscriminate support for any kind of action.

 The minister?s statement came in the wake of frequent strikes in government hospitals in the country, particularly Bihar and Bengal.

 Ramadoss? principal critic was a fellow member of the ruling coalition ? Ajay Maken of the Congress. The MP from New Delhi demanded that the employees be reinstated because they were not protesting for the implementation of any demand.

 The minister reminded him that a Delhi High Court order of September 2 ?prohibits disruption of work, aiding and abetting of cessation of work, shouting of slogans, demonstrations, dharnas within the (AIIMS) campus?.

 Rajdhani blast foiled 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Oct. 17: In its 

 first operation in Bihar after formalising the deal with 

 the People?s War, Maoist Communist Centre rebels planted 

 bombs on the track before the Howrah-New Delhi Rajdhani 

 was to cross. But an alert railway employee foiled the attempt. 

 The incident happened late last night near Karbandia station in the Gaya-Mughalsarai section of East Central Railway. 

 One of the bombs, being planted by a group of extremists, suddenly exploded and a railway employee, who works in a cabin outside the station, took note of the incident, a police source said.

 The spot was not very far from Rafiganj, where the Howrah Rajdhani had met with an accident in 2002, killing scores of passengers. Karbandia, in Rohtas district, is around 20 km from Sasaram while Rafiganj is around 45 km from there.

 ?The rebels had managed to plant a few bombs on the track. But the railway employee alerted the authorities well in time. A police party rushed to the spot and removed the explosives. All but one extremist managed to escape. He was arrested,? a railway source said in Patna.

 ?The track was safe. The train was allowed to pass after clearance by an inspection team. The bomb that exploded was of low intensity,? the source added. 

 The grand chord section of East Central Railway, through which several important trains pass every day, has been on the target list of the Naxalites for a long time. Had the rebels succeeded in their attempt, the damage would have been substantial.

 The MCC recently merged with the People?s War and last night?s incident was the first handiwork of the rebels in Bihar after the coming together.

 MF paints MS to life

 M.R. VENKATESH

 The MS painting at the Chennai exhibition

 Chennai, Dec. 21: M.F. Husain has paid tribute to M.S. Subbulakshmi with a portrait that carries his signature in Tamil.

 The painter was in Hyderabad when he heard of the Carnatic vocalist?s death on the night of December 11.

 The following Monday he went to Dubai, where he painted in a day the tribute to the ?Queen of Song?, using acrylic on canvas. It shows MS, as Subbulakshmi was popularly called, clad in a deep red sari and sporting jasmine flowers in her hair, with her famous tambura.

 ?On his arrival in Chennai on December 15, he brought the MS painting and displayed it himself as the centrepiece of his first major exhibition of paintings here,? said show coordinator Geetha of the Lakshana Museum of Arts.

 The start of the exhibition (December 15-January 22) coincided with the inauguration of the museum, which is a permanent art gallery.

 So intense was his devotion to MS and her music that Husain signed his name in Tamil after Geetha wrote it down in the Tamil script. ?He looked at that and signed his name,? she said.

 ?What is striking about the MS picture is the earnestness and brilliance with which he has captured the quintessence of that great soul,? Geetha said, explaining the painting?s significance to visitors.

 Art experts say the original MS portrait should easily be worth more than Rs 1 crore, should Husain choose to sell it.

 For now, it adorns the centre of the exhibition hall, surrounded by prints of over 100 of the artist?s other paintings, in the show titled ?Husain Edition Limited?.

 Another work on display is the Sansad Upanishad ? M.F. Husain in Parliament ? A Painter?s Reflection in Drawings, which the artist owes to his six-year tenure in the Rajya Sabha from 1986.

 Husain never uttered a word during his stint in the House but ?all along my sitting in Parliament, I continued to make hundreds of drawings?.

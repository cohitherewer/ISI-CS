 Court grants bail to Nanda

 New Delhi: Delhi High Court on Thursday 

 granted bail to industrialist Anil Nanda, accused of bringing 

 goods worth over Rs 50 lakh into the country without paying 

 customs duty.

 Justice H.R. Malhotra ordered Nanda?s release on bail upon furnishing a personal bond of Rs 50,000 and a surety of the like amount, said Nanda?s counsel R.K. Anand.

 He was also asked to surrender his passport and not to visit foreign countries without court sanction.

 On Monday, additional chief metropolitan magistrate Ravinder Dudeja had turned down Nanda?s bail application after the department of revenue intelligence which arrested him said an investigation was still pending.

 Nanda was arrested on October 14 from the Indira Gandhi International Airport here on his arrival from London on a British Airways flight. According to the department, he had not declared the goods he was carrying to customs authorities at the airport.

 The department also detained three employees of Nanda who were allegedly travelling with him. Officials of the department said the employees told them that Nanda had used them as ?carriers? to bring the goods into the country. However, only Nanda was arrested as he was the ?real culprit?, the department?s counsel said.

 Governor shuffle whispers

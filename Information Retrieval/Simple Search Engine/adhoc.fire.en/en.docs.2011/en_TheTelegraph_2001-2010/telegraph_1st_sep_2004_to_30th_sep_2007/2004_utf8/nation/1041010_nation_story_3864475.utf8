 Meet with aunt sets tongues wagging

 KAY BENEDICT

 New Delhi, Oct. 9: Varun Gandhi?s quiet meeting with Sonia Gandhi in between his Maharashtra campaign for the BJP and the Shiv Sena has fuelled speculation that he might join the Congress.

 While Varun confirmed his meeting with his aunt, both the BJP and the Congress have denied he is joining the Congress.

 A senior Congress leader said it would be wise to keep Varun at a distance, though his coming together with his cousins Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka might give psychological relief to Sonia.

 ?Varun is very sharp and crafty for his age. He has sensed that he has no future in the BJP (which is) riven with power struggle in the second-rung leadership. He paid three visits to the RSS headquarters in Nagpur to seek the blessings of K.S. Sudarshan in the last eight months as he knows that without the Sangh?s backing he cannot climb up the ladder in the BJP. But the Lok Sabha elections seem to have shattered his faith in the BJP,? a Congress source said.

 The source said Varun?s entry might open a parallel power centre in the Gandhi family. ?Moreover, we are not sure of the game plan of Maneka Gandhi, a strident critic of the Congress president,? he added. Varun?s mother is a BJP MP.

 Maneka had converted her Sanjay Vichar Manch into a political party ? Shakti Dal ? on the eve of the 2002 Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections. The Dal contested a few seats in and around Pilibhit with Varun making his maiden campaign speeches, but the party drew a blank.

 Maneka joined the BJP just before the April-May Lok Sabha polls. BJP strategists and National Democratic Alliance convener George Fernandes felt the coalition would gain by playing a ?deshi bahu? against the ?videshi bahu?.

 Officially, no Congress member wants to comment on Varun?s meeting with Sonia or any move to induct him. Asked about the meeting, senior leader Motilal Vohra said: ?I do not have any information.?

 Party spokesperson Jayanti Natrajan echoed Vohra. ?I am not aware of any such meeting,? she said.

 ?The party has no view,? said another Congress leader. ?It is a story which is more like a mirage in a desert.?

 Senior BJP leader Arun Jaitley was more categorical. ?The reports are absolutely wrong. I spoke to Maneka Gandhi?and Varun. He is campaigning actively for us.?

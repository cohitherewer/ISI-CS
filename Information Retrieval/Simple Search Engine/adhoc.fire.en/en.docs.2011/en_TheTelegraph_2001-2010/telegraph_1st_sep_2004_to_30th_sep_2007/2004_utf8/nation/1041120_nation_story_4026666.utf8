 Engineers abducted

 Patna, Nov. 19: Two senior engineers of the National Hydroelectric Power Corporation were kidnapped this afternoon on the borders of Vaishali and Muzaffarpur districts in Bihar, reports our special correspondent.

 The incident is a jolt to the Centre and the state government?s move to hand over work under the Prime Minister?s Gram Sadak Yojana to central undertakings. NHPC is the first such agency to be assigned the construction of roads in Bihar and was allocated West Champaran district.

 NHPC general manager T. Mandal and chief engineer K.K. Singh were on their way from Patna to Bettiah in north Bihar when they were kidnapped. ?The driver had apparently been drugged,? a source said.

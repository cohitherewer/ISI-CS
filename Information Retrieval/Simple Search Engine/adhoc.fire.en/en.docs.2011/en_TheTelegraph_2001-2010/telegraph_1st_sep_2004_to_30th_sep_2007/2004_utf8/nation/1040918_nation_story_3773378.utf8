 Uma name out of flag case

 New Delhi, Sept. 17: Uma Bharti?s name was today dropped from a case of flag-code violation, following which the Supreme Court issued a notice to the Centre on the formation of a comprehensive National Flag Code, says our legal correspondent.

 The petitioner has ?deleted the name of an individual (Uma) and amended the petition not singling out anyone. Issue notice (to the Centre) on the new petition?, a division bench said in its brief order today.

 Seema Nayar had in her petition accused Uma of violating the flag code and ?dishonouring? the Tricolour in view of her ongoing tiranga yatra.

 Justices . Santosh Hegde and S.B. Sinha had subsequently observed that the petitioner was ?singling out? an individual when ?dishonour? to the flag was being committed by ?models and cricket fans?. The bench suggested that Nayar amend the petition.

 Following the amendment, the notice was issued to the Centre seeking details of the steps it had taken to form a comprehensive flag code.

 Nayar had said that in the guise of freedom granted to individuals under the flag code, the Tricolour was being misused for partisan political gains and abused at fashion shows and sports events.

 The national flag, the petition said, was a ?symbol of pride? for which numerous people had laid down their lives.

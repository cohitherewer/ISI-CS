 Rivals wield spat stick

 Laloo Prasad 

 New Delhi, Dec. 8: After trying unsuccessfully to find a stick with which to beat the United Progressive Alliance government, the National Democratic Alliance has settled on the Laloo Prasad Yadav-Ram Vilas Paswan spat to embarrass the government.

 The overwhelming mood in the NDA is to confront the government, but BJP sources said the hitch is that the party had assured the Speaker it would not stall Parliament. It will thus have to find a way of registering its protest during the winter session without appearing disruptive ? a tall order, sources say.

 The NDA will hold a second meeting of its MPs this week to formulate what the BJP?s deputy leader in the Lok Sabha V.K. Malhotra termed an ?effective and cohesive? response to the Laloo Prasad-Paswan fight.

 The alliance?s attempt to embarrass the treasury benches fell flat today when Laloo Prasad dismissed the spat as a ?media creation? and parliamentary affairs minister Ghulam Nabi Azad said there was no need for the Prime Minister to issue a ?clarification? as the NDA has demanded.

 When the leader of the Opposition, L.K. Advani, led a walkout, Trinamul Congress and Akali Dal members followed reluctantly. NDA sources said there was ?pressure? from the Janata Dal (United) and the Shiv Sena to troop into the well of the House and hold up proceedings, which the other constituents did not relish.

 The Telugu Desam Party, an ?outside? ally, made it clear it wanted to raise issues but wished the House to run.

 The Dal (U) reckoned that spotlighting the spat would send a ?loud and clear? message to the UPA?s voters in Bihar that the alliance between Laloo Prasad?s Rashtriya Janata Dal and Paswan?s Lok Janshakti Party had come apart. The party also felt it would show that the RJD chief was no longer as ?invincible? as he appeared and that the secular forces were in ?disarray?.

 The Sena, which was against holding up the House during the last session, reportedly felt that ?things were going too smoothly for the government and the Opposition was not discharging its role properly?, BJP sources said.

 But before the NDA goes for the jugular, sources said alliance leaders have asked for videotapes of the public meetings at which Laloo Prasad reportedly levelled all sorts of accusations against Paswan.

 Power talks roll for Left

 MONOBINA GUPTA 

 Singh: Listening

 New Delhi, Dec. 22: The Prime Minister has set the ball rolling on the Left demand for a review of the electricity act after receiving a letter from CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan last month.

 Union power minister P.M. Sayeed met Bardhan and CPM politburo member E. Balanandan yesterday to discuss the Left demand.

 ?This is the first meeting we have had on this issue. The next meeting will take place in January,? said Bardhan, who wrote to Manmohan Singh in November threatening an indefinite strike by electricity workers unless the 2003 act ? which paved the way for privatisation of state electricity boards ? was reviewed.

 Privatisation of the electricity sector has come to stay ? the electricity act was passed by the then National Democratic Alliance government last year with the Congress help. It is already operational in Uttar Pradesh, Orissa, Delhi, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Haryana, Rajasthan and Assam.

 Even so, the Left wants to drastically amend the act, virtually negating the purpose it was drafted for.

 The act allows state governments to split the generation, transmission and the distribution sectors which are integrated at present. But the Left is unhappy that states have been allowed to hive off distribution and hand it over to private companies. ?We want to stop this,? Bardhan said.

 However, the process is under way in many states. ?In Uttar Pradesh, for instance, distribution of electricity has been separated from generation and transmission of electricity. The distribution unit has been handed over to private companies,? the CPI general secretary said.

 The Left admits there are legal complexities to amending the act. But employees belonging to Left unions are already on the warpath. Electricity workers from all over the country gathered here last month to urge the Centre to review the act. Employees in Punjab struck work on Thursday.

 ?The Maharashtra government is not implementing the act because of our pressure. We are heading for a national strike,? Bardhan said.

 The ruling United Progressive Alliance?s common minimum programme is committed to take a second look at the electricity act even though the Congress has supported the legislation in the past. The Left made it one of the key issues when the common programme was being drawn up.

 In Andhra Pradesh, the CPM- and CPI-backed electricity employees? federations had fought former chief minister N. Chandrababu Naidu?s attempts to privatise the electricity sector. This was one of the major factors responsible for the cooling of ties between the Left and Naidu.

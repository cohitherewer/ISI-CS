 Jakhar disappoints with kebab-less iftar

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Jakhar: Tongues wagging

 Bhopal, Nov. 4: No roganjosh, no murg biryani, no kebabs.

 ?It is all vegetarian fare,? whispered a disappointed guest sporting a Turkish cap.

 By the time the guests had finished surveying the food counters, their smiles had disappeared. ?We thought governor sahib to be a former Congressman, but he seems to be influenced by the state?s ruling party culture,? sighed a maulana.

 The iftar that Balram Jakhar, the governor of BJP-ruled Madhya Pradesh threw last evening, was a grand affair. He received and saw off distinguished guests and made elaborate arrangements for magrib (evening) prayers on the green court of Raj Bhavan. But his menu triggered a debate with conservatives pointing at the ?age-old practice? of dishing out Mughlai fare for rozedars (those who fast).

 City qazi Abdul Latif, who was among those present at the feast, however, said it was up to the host to choose the menu. And, he added, there was no link between rozas and non-vegetarian food. ?What is important is all rozedars eat what is permissible to them in accordance to faith.?

 Raj Bhavan sources defended the governor. They said Jakhar being a strict vegetarian cleared an all-veg menu.

 But it was food for criticism from Congress leaders unhappy with Jakhar. ?When Mohammad Shafi Qureshi was governor till 1998, he used to throw lavish non-vegetarian parties every fortnight,? recalled Zaheeruddin. 

 He said even Digvijay Singh, who had stopped having non-veg during his second stint as chief minister, continued to serve non-vegetarian food at iftar and other parties.

 Digvijay, incidentally, has gone back to eating non-veg stuff.

 Qureshi, who is from Kashmir, had such fondness for Mughlai food that Raj Bhavan chefs would often fetch goats in bulk to prepare delicacies. At times, the governor would summon chefs from his home state.

 The Raj Bhavan went for a sweeping change when Bhai Mahavir replaced Qureshi. A former employee recalled that meat, fish and poultry were banned as Mahavir stopped purchases from outside.

 Mahavir, known for his frugal eating habits and austere lifestyle, insisted on utilising the huge farmland at the governor?s summer retreat in Panchmarhi, while his wife spent time growing vegetables inside Raj Bhavan. That continued till Mahavir retired and Ram Prakash Gupta replaced him.

 Gupta, a strict vegetarian, made little changes during his brief tenure. Frail health kept him in and out of local hospitals till his death.

 When Jakhar took over, the city?s meat suppliers and those fond of Raj Bhavan feasts thought their wait for better times was over. It looks like they will have to wait some more.

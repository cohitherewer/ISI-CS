 Priest murder finger at Sangh 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 11: The Catholic Bishops Conference of India has demanded a CBI probe into the recent murder of a Catholic priest in Kerala, the first such hate crime in the 2000-year history of the church in the state.

 Church authorities feel the murder is part of a conspiracy by the RSS and the BJP to wreck communal peace in Kerala after their failure to whip up large-scale frenzy in the wake of last year?s Hindu-Muslim clashes in Marad.

 Many people died in the violence in Marad, a fishing village in Kozhikode district on the Muslim-dominated Malabar coast of northern Kerala.

 CBCI spokesman Father Babu Joseph said the church wants to know why Father Job Chitilapilly was killed. The 73-year-old was stabbed to death on the premises of the parish house in Chalakudy, Thrissur district, by Reghu Kumar, on August 28 as he was preparing for holy mass. Though the RSS claimed Kumar was not a member, the church suspects the Sangh was behind the murder.

 Church sources said they were worried because the Sangh parivar could be shifting its focus from the north to central Kerala to drive a wedge between Hindus and Christians. Thrissur, Ernakulam and Kottayam districts in central Kerala are Christian-dominated while the northern districts have a sizeable number of Muslims.

 In districts like Ernakulam and Thrissur, Hindus are in a minority and the murder of the priest, a church official said, may have been aimed at setting Christians against Hindus.

 The BJP, which failed to open its account in Kerala in the recent elections, is trying hard to consolidate Hindu votes. The state unit of the party organised a two-day camp on Thursday and Friday near Kochi to chalk out a programme of agitations against the ruling Congress-led United Democratic Front.

 Senior leaders .K. Advani, M. Venkaiah Naidu, Sanjay Joshi, . Ganesh and . Rajagopal were among those who attended the meeting.

 After the camp, state BJP president P.S. Sreedharan Pillai said the party would demand removal of the education portfolio from the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML). The Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha will take out a march to the secretariat demanding removal of the portfolio from the IUML, he said.

 ?It is the Sonia (Gandhi)-(H.S.) Surjeet axis which is ruling the country,? Pillai said, alluding to the Left?s support to the Congress-led coalition at the Centre. ?We will convey the message to the people that both the Fronts (United Democratic and Left Democratic) in Kerala are similar. The unholy alliance between the Congress, CPM and the Muslim League will also be exposed,? he added.

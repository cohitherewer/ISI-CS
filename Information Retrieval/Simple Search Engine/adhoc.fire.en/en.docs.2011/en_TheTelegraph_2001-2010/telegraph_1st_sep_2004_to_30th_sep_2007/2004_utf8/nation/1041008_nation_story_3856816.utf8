 Censor scissors spare riot film

 CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA

 Mumbai, Oct. 7: The Censor Board made a complete turnaround today and cleared Final Solution, a film on the aftermath of the Gujarat riots, without any cuts.

 In August, the board had rejected the internationally acclaimed film, made by Rakesh Sharma, on the ground that it could incite communal flare-ups. Sharma had appealed to the board to send the film for a review.

 The film was shown today to the high-profile revising committee comprising Censor Board chairperson Anupam Kher, filmmaker Shyam Benegal, activist Teesta Setalvad, theatre personality Dolly Thakore and filmmaker Ashok Pandit, who said it could be released without any change.

 Kher said the documentary was a ?testament of history? and ?a very well-made film?. It was passed unanimously by the revising committee.

 Rejecting the documentary, the Censor Board had previously said ?the film promotes communal disharmony among Hindu and Muslim groups and presents the picture of Gujarat riots in a way that may arouse communal feelings and clashes. Certain dialogues involve defamation of individuals. The entire picturisation is highly provocative?.

 Final Solution shows Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi and VHP leader Praveen Togadia campaigning before the Assembly polls, inciting Hindu crowds with inflammatory speeches against Muslims.

 The film has won the prestigious Wolfgang Staudte Award at the Berlin International Film Festival, where it also won the Special Jury Award. But the Censor Board took more than a year in arranging for the screening of the film to one of its committees, then refused to give it a censor certificate.

 Sharma said it was major victory for his film and the battle against censorship. ?Documentaries should not require censor certificates at all.?

 Hope for 9/11

 Fahrenheit 9/11, the controversial film on George W. Bush that got stuck at the Censor Board here, is also likely to be cleared soon. ?The review committee will come to a decision on Saturday,? said Kher.

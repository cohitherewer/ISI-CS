 Pact to trap criminals 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 1: Bangladesh and India, likely to decide on modalities for co-ordinated patrolling along the 4,000-km border, have finalised a deal to work together to cut the possible lines of escape for criminals across the border.

 The BSF had expected to reach an agreement on the final draft of the modalities at the meeting of the heads of the BSF and the Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) that ended here today. However, it is now expected to take some time.

 BDR chief, Maj. Gen. Mohammad Jahangir Alam Chowdhury, said he would respond to the BSF?s suggestions shortly. Neither Chowdhury nor BSF chief Ajai Raj Sharma spelt out a time frame for the co-ordinated patrolling but some officials associated with the discussions said they were hopeful that it would be in place by February.

 Members of the Indian delegation, however, are suggesting that when an agreement was reached on sharing information about miscreants, Dhaka had opposed the use of the words insurgents and terrorists, and settled for criminals.

 The BSF had proposed the pact in view of Northeast insurgents crossing over to Bangladesh. Under the agreement, Sharma said, the security forces would inform their counterpart when a ?serious crime? is committed and steps would be taken to seal all escape routes. 

 Security officials said Delhi does not expect the BDR to act on all its requests but believes the pact would put it under pressure to keep a distance from militants. 

 The two sides did not get into the nitty-gritty of the standoff on allowing India to erect a fence within 150 yards of the zero line as Dhaka had sought time to take a decision. But the home ministry has threatened to continue with the fencing. 

 Chowdhury indicated that the BDR might not remain silent if Delhi carries out its threat. ?The situation will dictate the response,? he said.

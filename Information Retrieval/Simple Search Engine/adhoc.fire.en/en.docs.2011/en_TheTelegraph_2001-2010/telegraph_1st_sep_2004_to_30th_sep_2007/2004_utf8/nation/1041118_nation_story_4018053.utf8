 Soldiers gun down 75-year-old teacher

 KHELEN THOCKCHOM

 Imphal, Nov. 17: Assam Rifles jawans gunned down a 75-year-old man and injured his wife in Manipur last night, rekindling the embers of the agitation over the custody death of Thangjam Manorama in July.

 The victim, retired school teacher 

 L.D. Rengtuiwan, was coming out of his house at Bungte Chiru 

 village of Bishenpur district when troops of 28 Assam Rifles 

 killed him. 

 His wife, Thangmuchim, was shot in the leg when she rushed out of the house on hearing gunshots. 

 The incident occurred in the midst of a cordon-and-search operation by an Assam Rifles unit deployed in neighbouring Thoubal district. 

 The soldiers, who were on the lookout for four members of the banned United National Liberation Front, claimed Rengtuiwan was struck when they opened fire on some ?fleeing persons? in the dark of the night.

 The paramilitary force submitted a report on the incident to the police, who found three empty AK-47 shells at the spot. The incident occurred around 9.30 pm.

 Anticipating trouble just ahead of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh?s visit to the state, the Okram Ibobi Singh government did not waste any time in instituting a judicial inquiry into the incident. The probe is to be completed within a month. 

 A judicial commission headed by retired judge C. Upendra is investigating the circumstances leading to Manorama?s death in Assam Rifles? custody. 

 In a memorandum to the chief minister, the Komrem Union ? Rengtuiwan was from the Komrem community ? accused the Assam Rifles of storming the former schoolteacher?s house and opening fire without warning. It said the soldiers assaulted three more persons in the neighbourhood.

 The Komrem Union demanded penal action against the personnel involved in the incident and compensation of Rs 10 lakh to the family of the deceased. It recommended payment of Rs 1 lakh each to the injured.

 Apunba Lup, a conglomerate of 32 organisations, has been campaigning against the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act ever since Manorama died in Assam Rifles? custody. 

 A team from the 17th battalion of the paramilitary force had arrested her on suspicion of links with a banned militant group. She was allegedly sexually assaulted before being shot.

 After extracting an assurance from the Prime Minister that the armed forces act would be replaced by a ?humane? legislation, the Apunba Lup today demanded ?immediate steps? to repeal the law. 

 The organisation adopted a resolution to continue the agitation during a daylong convention to ascertain public opinion on Singh?s promise.

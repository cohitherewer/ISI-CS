The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Ticket rap on teacher protest

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Katni/Bhopal, Oct. 14: Strip to the minimum, go on satyagraha, invoke the Father of the Nation ? if you must ? but buy a ticket by all means.

 Or take a walk to jail.

 Some 250 schoolteachers, travelling without tickets on the Bhopal-bound Rewanchal Express in an innovative protest for better wages and perks, were today forced to cough up Rs 20,000 after being booked by rail authorities in Jabalpur division.

 The teachers first tried to gag the checkers saying they were ?merely following? Mahatma Gandhi?s way of peaceful satyagraha. But the men in black coats were not impressed. They pointed out that Gandhi, even while travelling third class, always carried a valid ticket.

 The teachers were asked to pay up or face arrest. Heated exchanges followed, delaying the train for an hour-and-a-half, but the authorities refused to relent. Finally, a senior teacher went around collecting the money to pay off the penalty.

 Divisional manager Devi Prasad Pande said his men were ?merely fulfilling? their duty and enforcing the rule of law. The fine, he added, was not aimed at increasing revenue.

 But the teachers are determined to carry on with their novel forms of protest. State teachers? association chief Murlidhar Patidar said such ?coercive? methods would not deter them from seeking better wages.

 If ticket-less travel is one of the tactics that over 80,000 teachers in government-run schools in Madhya Pradesh have resorted to, the other is stripping to the bare minimum. Patidar had led a procession of teachers who stripped to just short of embarrassment in the busy New Market area of the state capital.

 Patidar said the teachers have been inspired by the recent incident in Manipur, where women staged a naked protest against the army after the alleged rape and custodial death of a woman accused of militant links. ?Unfortunately, nothing shocks those who are in power,? he rued.

 The demands of the teachers include payment of salary, which they claim has not been paid for the past few months, new pay scale, lifting of the ban on leave travel allowance and recruitment on compassionate grounds.

 ?We have tried everything from writing letters to leading delegations but the state government has turned a blind eye,? Patidar said. His organisation, he added, has explored all other means of protest, such as rallies, demonstrations, blocking traffic and hunger strike.

 Patidar said they were planning to ?gherao? the chief minister?s bungalow but abandoned the plan as the official chief ministerial residence at 6, Shyamla Hills does not have a ?valid occupant?.

 Current occupant Uma Bharti ? though off to the Himalayas for 45 days ? has not vacated the house, while her successor, chief minister Babulal Gaur, has left for Sharjah.

 Iraq poll on Rumsfeld talks table

 New Delhi, Dec. 6: US secretary of defence Donald Rumsfeld is expected in New Delhi on Wednesday for a short visit during which he will meet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, defence minister Pranab Mukherjee and external affairs minister Natwar Singh.

 Rumsfeld, who was on Saturday asked by George Bush to continue as secretary for defence after the US President inaugurates his second term early January, gives the establishment in New Delhi a first opportunity to interact with the old-new dispensation in Washington.

 Manmohan Singh has already indicated that India will look closely at offering help to conduct elections in Iraq due on January 30. The Election Commission has signed an agreement with the UN electoral assistance division to assist in conducting polls in post-conflict countries. Despite doubts on the feasibility of conducting elections in violence-rocked Iraq, the Bush administration has so far been intent on the exercise. Only last week Rumsfeld announced the US was sending 1,50,000 more troops to Iraq.

 With Rumsfeld being a crucial component in the shaping of the Bush administration?s medium-term strategies, it is only to be expected that he will request New Delhi to commit civilian assistance for the elections in Iraq. India offered token assistance to the elections in Afghanistan in October but Washington would want the world?s most populous democracy to have greater exposure in the Arab country if only to grant the hustings a stamp of legitimacy. For New Delhi, too, the opportunity to showcase its democracy and get warm with the second Bush (junior) administration will be too good to pass up.

 But whatever India?s diplomatic compulsions to remain on the right side of Washington, the arrival of Rumsfeld, the face of the US military machine, in New Delhi at a time when it is engaged in peace negotiations with Islamabad, will not go unnoticed in Pakistan. Neither will it be heartwarming to those like the Left who are sceptical of US? designs in South Asia. It is not done, they argue, for Rumsfeld to visit New Delhi and sell arms when the mood is for peace.

 More so because the US has offered to India equipment, including the maritime patrol aircraft P-3C Orion, even F-16 fighters, Sea Hawk helicopters and, most importantly, a version of the Patriot anti-missile defence system.

 Indian Navy chief Arun Prakash said last week that his service will review its decision to take a hard look at the Orion after the US was reported to have offered the same machine to Pakistan. Likewise with the F-16 aircraft, which the Pakistan Air Force already has. But India will be seriously looking to negotiate the Patriot missile defence system because it perceives a huge strategic advantage in it.

 India has been in the global market for a missile defence system, with Indian military and defence officials having also attended demonstrations in the US.

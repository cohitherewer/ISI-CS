 Court comes to couple?s rescue

 Meerut (PTI): A local court here allowed 

 a Hindu woman to continue living with her Muslim husband 

 after she furnished documents to prove that they were legally 

 married, police sources said.

 Rubi (26) informed ADM (City) Shreesh Dubey on Sunday that she had married Waseem Saifi five months ago of her own free will and had not been kidnapped as alleged by her father, they said.

 Rubi presented her quot;nikaah-namah quot; and age certificates in court and also expressed her desire to continue living with her husband, police said.

 Earlier, her father Brijpal Singh had lodged a complaint in the Kasna police station in Ghaziabad alleging that Saifi had kidnapped her.

 Acting on the complaint, the Ghaziabad police conducted a raid in Hashimpura locality on Saturday to quot;rescue quot; Rubi. During the raid, a mob damaged the police van and tried to attack police personnel.

 In view of the sensitive nature of the case, the court was convened on Sunday and a large posse of police was stationed outside the premises to prevent any untoward incident, they added.

 SC eye on scavenger plight

 New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Monday 

 summoned the principal secretaries of eight states and a 

 Union territory to be present in court on October 1 to reply 

 to a petition seeking abolition of manual scavenging in 

 the country, reports our legal correspondent. 

 The states of Assam, Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Gujarat, Jammu and Kashmir, Manipur and Uttaranchal and the Union territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli have not yet filed replies. Hence, the order to the principal secretaries to be ?present in person?.

 A division bench of Justices S..Variava and H.K. Sema took a serious note of these states not replying to the earlier notices of the court and expressed its displeasure over their taking the matter ?lightly?.

 The court had issued notices to all states and Union territories and the Centre on a petition filed by a social activist organisation, ?Safai Karmachari Andolan?.

 The petition said the Centre had launched the National Scheme of Liberation and Rehabilitation of Scavengers on March 22, 1992 to liberate scavengers and their dependents from the ?hereditary, obnoxious and inhuman occupation? of manually removing night soil and filth. But the scheme remained only on paper and has not yet been implemented.

 Cong fires Sena salvo

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Sept. 4: The Congress has said it will approach the Election Commission over the Shiv Senas distribution of provocative literature in Maharashtra on poll-eve.

 Margaret Alva, an All India Congress Committee general secretary and in-charge of party affairs in Maharashtra, said the Sena was distributing inflammatory materials across the state.

 The Congress has proof of provocative literature being distributed in Mumbai and other parts of Maharashtra that depict images of Congress leaders with Pakistani leader Mohammad Ali Jinnahs cap superimposed on their heads, Alva told an election meeting in Nagpur.

 She also accused the party of luring voters with promises to waive crop loans and provide free electricity to farmers. The Congress leader alleged that the Sena was using forms signed by its chief Bal Thackeray that sought information on farmers to propagate its poll promises, in violation of the code of conduct.

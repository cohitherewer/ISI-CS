 Malaysia in joint patrol call

 New Delhi, Sept. 7: The Malaysian government has proposed a joint patrolling of busy sea lanes of communication off its coast with the Indian Navy, defence sources said here today.

 The chief of the Royal Malaysian Navy, Admiral Dato Sri Mohammad Anwar Bin HJ Mohammad Nor, met the navy chief, Admiral Arun Prakash, and senior defence ministry officials on a visit here and proposed other joint activities such as training of Malaysian naval personnel and navy-to-navy cooperation on the high seas in the Indian Ocean Region.

 The sources said the Indian government was considering the proposal for joint patrolling. It was assessing the responses of other countries in the region to the Indian Navys joint patrols with Malaysia. Singapore had expressed keenness for such patrolling in the past and talks with it are to be revived, the sources said.

 The sources said the Indian Navy was patrolling the 6 degree channel, a sea lane that was just about a mile wide in some stretches and 200 nautical miles long. The region is south of Indira Point, the navy and coast guard station in the South Andaman islands.

 The Indian Navy was already conducting joint patrols with the Indonesian Navy between Indira Point and the Indonesian coast. The sea lane is a feeder pass for many Asian countries and navies are concerned over complaints of piracy.

 The channel is just about a mile wide in some places and in certain stretches only two or three ships can pass at a time because the depth reduces to 25-30 metres. This is a potential blockage area. It is not unknown for vessels to be intercepted here by pirates in fast craft embarking a ship and siphoning off crude, the sources said.

 India began patrolling the Malacca Straits jointly with the US Navy in the run-up to Operation Enduring Freedom, the war in Afghanistan. Indian vessels relieved US naval vessels that were deployed in the military operation against Afghanistan in 2001.

 The sources said the Indian and Indonesian navies had extended an exercise in the region for the month of September under an arrangement called IndIndocorpat (Joint Coordination Patrol).

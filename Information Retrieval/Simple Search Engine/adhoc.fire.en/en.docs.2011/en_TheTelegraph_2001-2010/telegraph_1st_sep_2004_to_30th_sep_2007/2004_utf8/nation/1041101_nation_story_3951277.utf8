 Home push for assault victims

 Mumbai (PTI): In cases of domestic violence, 

 the victim should be first given the right to possession 

 of the house of her spouse to ensure her protection, family 

 court judge Roshan Dalvi has said.

 ?It will solve most of the cases,? she said at a meet on proposed laws on domestic violence here on Saturday.

 The judge said in most cases of domestic violence, the victims are thrown out of their homes. She cited instances of the UK and Canada where victims get special suites in such cases. ?We don?t have such infrastructure but we can at least help them have a place to live,? Dalvi said.

 Advocate and human rights activist Indira Jaising said judges in family courts should be sensitised towards cases of domestic violence. Addressing the inaugural session, she said judges should treat matters of domestic violence as an emergency. ?It (domestic violence) is an indication of emergency and is not a litigation that can wait. It means that an action is awaited,? she said, adding that delay may lead to loss of life of the victims.

 Ammu Abraham from Women?s Centre said in many cases the parents of the girl are also responsible for her suffering. ?They (family members) force them to go back to the houses of their husbands and ask them to adjust there,? she said.

 Man uses e-mail for talaq

 Lucknow (PTI): A man has reportedly divorced 

 his wife through e-mail in Bareilly district of Uttar Pradesh. 

 Rahat Iqbal, living in the US, is reported to have recently 

 given triple talaq to his wife Rubab Anwar through 

 e-mail.

 Rubab was married to Iqbal in 1998, but barely after a month or so her husband left for the US promising to send her a visa within 20 days.

 She received a triple talaq message from Iqbal in her e-mail last week. Though she immediately challenged the talaq in a court, the issue has posed the question before Muslim scholars whether talaq through e-mails and SMS was justified in the eyes of Islam.

 ?Triple talaq is very much effective in Islam but the authenticity of the communication must be established as anyone can misuse the method,? said Darul-ul-ifta Firangi Mahal secretary and All India Muslim Personal Law Board member Khalid Rashid. The Muslim personal law board spokesman, Mohammad Hashim Qureshi, however, chose to remain non-committal on the matter.

 plant of Ranbaxy Laboratories Limited here on Saturday,

 Munitions find

 Ahmedabad (PTI): Police have recovered 

 125 cartridges from a consignment of scrap at Kandla port 

 in Kutch district. ?The cartridges, recovered yesterday 

 (Saturday), were small in size and several contained powder, 

 while some were empty. They were found in a scrap consignment 

 and customs officials are looking into the matter,? Kandla 

 police said.

 Uplinking norms

 New Delhi (PTI): The government 

 has extended the uplinking arrangement of news and current 

 affairs TV channels till December 31 to examine various 

 issues related to revising the guidelines. The deadline 

 for the existing norms, which had been extended earlier, 

 was Sunday. The government is in the process of revising 

 the guidelines related to the eligibility criteria for uplinking

 Teacher shot 

 Moga (PTI): Unidentified people shot 

 dead a schoolteacher in Jogewala village near here. Surjit 

 Singh, a science teacher at the government senior secondary 

 school in Kahansinghwala village was shot when he was going 

 to school on Saturday.

 Panchayat polls

 Srinagar (PTI): The Jammu and Kashmir 

 government has decided to dissolve the existing panchayats 

 and hold fresh elections to these institutions between January 

 15 and February 15 next year, rural development and panchayati 

 raj minister Peerzada said on Sunday.

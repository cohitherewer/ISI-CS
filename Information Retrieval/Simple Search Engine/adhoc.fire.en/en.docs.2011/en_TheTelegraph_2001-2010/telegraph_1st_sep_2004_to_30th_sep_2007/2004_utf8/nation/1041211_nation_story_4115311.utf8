 Kashmir normalisation checks in

 MUKHTAR AHMAD

 Srinagar, Dec. 10: The ?normalisation? drive in Kashmir today reached areas that affect the people the most: hotels and schools.

 Chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed has ordered security forces to vacate hotels, schools and other public places occupied by them.

 Mufti approved allocation of Rs 9 crore for constructing permanent accommodation facilities for the army, paramilitary and police so that their ?presence does not hamper tourism, education and other development activities in Kashmir?.

 Instructions have been issued to give priority to vacating hotels on the boulevard on the banks of Dal Lake. ?The owners of these hotels (now occupied by the CRPF) should get enough time to renovate infrastructure in time for the ensuing tourist season,? an official statement said.

 In the first phase, seven hotels on the boulevard will be vacated by January-end, freeing as many as 200 rooms for use by tourists.

 During the last peak-season, the lack of space in hotels told on the visitors who again thronged one of the most celebrated spots on the tourist map following the thaw in India-Pakistan relations.

 As many as 48 hotels, including some of the best properties around Dal Lake, are now occupied by the security forces, which have converted them into makeshift barracks.

 The tourism industry, struggling to cope with the clawback to normality and the resultant surge in the number of visitors, applauded today?s decision, which follows a series of ?de-escalation? measures announced by both the Centre as well as the state government.

 Nazir Bakhshi, a tour operator, said: ?It is a major decision. We welcome it. We will now have additional rooms available after the decision is implemented.?

 ?This is a welcome step, provided the government implements fast so that the hotels are refurbished for the next tourist season,? said Mohammad Latief, who owns a hotel.

 The instructions to vacate the hotels were issued after a meeting between the chief minister and the state police department.

 ?The meeting discussed threadbare the situation arising out of the continued occupation of hotels, educational institutions and other public facilities by the security forces,? a spokesman said.

 The chief minister asked the security forces to look for alternative accommodation, pointing out that ?the state was paying a whopping sum as rental for hotels and private accommodation annually?.

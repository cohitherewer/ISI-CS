 Forced out, herd wrecks new ground

 Panaji (Goa), Nov. 18: Man-animal conflict has taken a jumbo shape on the Maharashtra-Goa border with villagers adopting strong-arm tactics to beat back elephants as their requests for government help seem to have fallen on deaf ears. 

 Wildlife activists said at least four persons have been killed and property worth lakhs of rupees have been damaged since the herd made a foray to the Tillari region on the border. 

 Elephants are new there and as the villagers are not aware of their behavioural patterns and habitat preferences, the conflict is taking a violent turn. 

 A lack of legal provisions to compensate victims of elephant attacks has aggravated the problem. The elephant is a Schedule I animal in India and gets protection from the law. 

 ?In the (Maharashtra-Goa border) villages of Konal, Tillari, Medhe, Sonaval, Paliye of Dodamarg taluka, villagers get ready to thwart the elephants at sunset with torches, country-made weapons and sticks,? said wildlife campaigner Nirmal Kulkarni. An artist in his twenties, Kulkarni has been associated for many years with wildlife issues in the region. 

 Deforestation, encroachment on elephant migration corridors and increase of monoculture plantations are seen as some of the problems that have forced elephants from the Dandeli sanctuary of Karnataka to move to the Mahadai forests in Goa and from there to the Tillari region. 

 Tillari is on the Maharashtra-Goa border, where a dam is being built jointly by the two states. Plenty of water, fodder like sugarcane and other crops are luring the pachyderms to the area. 

 ?From 2002, these elephants are repeatedly visiting these areas and have destroyed not only agricultural produce but settlements as well,? Kulkarni said. 

 The villagers, most of them cultivators dependent on seasonal crops, are afraid and angry as their only source of livelihood is being threatened. 

 They have been urging the Maharashtra government to arrange for trans-location of the herd and compensation, but the authorities seem to have done precious little to alleviate their sufferings. 

 Goa-based campaigner Rajendra Kerkar and his team of volunteers of the Vivekanand Environment Awareness Brigade are working with the villagers to create awareness. But a solution to the problem is beyond their means ? capturing the elephants and moving them is a major operation which would require involvement of all three states. 

 ?What is most important is that both the elephants and the people are not harmed in any way as there is a panic situation in the region and the locals have got the feeling that they are not being heard,? Kulkarni said.

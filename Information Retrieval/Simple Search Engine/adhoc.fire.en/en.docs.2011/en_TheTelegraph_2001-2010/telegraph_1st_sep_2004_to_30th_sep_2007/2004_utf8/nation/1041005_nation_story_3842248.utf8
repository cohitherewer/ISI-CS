 Party names

 New Delhi, Oct. 4 (PTI): The Supreme Court on Monday issued notices to the Centre, the Election Commission and six national political parties, including the Congress and the BJP, on a public interest litigation seeking de-recognition of parties with religious connotations in their name.

 A bench of Chief Justice R.C. Lahoti and Justice G.P. Mathur also issued notices to 22 other parties, including the Indian Union Muslim League and the Akali Dal.

 The petition contended that, according to the Constitution, India is a secular state and provided for separating religion and governance.

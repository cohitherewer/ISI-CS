 UK flight, visa jump for trade

 Bangalore: The Tony Blair administration 

 proposes to double the number of direct flights to Indian 

 destinations from the UK and increase the number of multiple-entry 

 visas in a drive to attract more investment from the subcontinent, 

 reports our special correspondent. 

 ?The number of flights between India and the UK will go up to 40 (from 19 now) a week from the summer of 2005. Besides the four metros, Bangalore, Kochi and Hyderabad will be directly connected to London,? Sir Michael Arthur, the British high commissioner to India, said on Tuesday at BangaloreIT.com, the IT flagship event of the Karnataka government. 

 The number of visas for Indians would also increase by 30 per cent to touch 3,00,000 this year. This is more than twice the number given to citizens of other countries, he said.

 he envoy, who released Infinite Possibilities: A guide to establishing a presence in the UK at the meet, said the recent visit of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to London catalysed more business initiatives between the two countries.

 Goa casts vice net

 Panaji: Goa police have arrested four 

 women operating as sex workers along Calangute beach in 

 north Goa, reports our correspondent.

 The crime branch declined to divulge the names of the women ? in their early twenties ? but said two of them were from Calcutta and the rest from Assam.

 The arrests followed a campaign charging the government with ignoring tourism-linked prostitution in a state that receives more visitors (an estimated 2 million every year) than its 1.4 million population.

 The police said two men held for soliciting customers have been identified as Saulo alias Vicky Kandolkar, 25, of Parsem in north Goa, and Ramu ?Keshav? Devre, 27, from Nepal. The women, who used to work as dancers in Mumbai bars, had shifted to Goa a fortnight ago.

 In August, a weekly newspaper undertook a sting operation, exposing child sex abuse by foreigners and how the authorities were turning a blind eye to it.

 In October-end, it was said the police were taking steps to tackle the menace, especially the prostitution rackets being run from bar-and-restaurants and shacks (makeshift beachside restaurants).

 The menace is more rampant in north Goa?s coastal belt, a hotspot for tourists, both foreign and domestic. 

 Rail enquiry on SMS

 New Delhi (PTI): The railways will 

 shortly launch an SMS-based enquiry service for information 

 on passenger numerical record (PNR) status. 

 The number 676747 will also provide the status of the train list, an official release said on Tuesday, adding that the same number will be valid all over the country.

 Indians saved

 Mauritania (AP): An international 

 humanitarian agency helped rescue 23 Indian and Bangladeshi 

 migrants stranded in the Sahara desert. They were trying 

 to migrate to Europe. 

 Lottery objection

 New Delhi (PTI): Delhi Public School 

 has opposed the idea of selecting children for admission 

 to nursery through a draw of lots, saying school admission 

 was different from a lottery or a housing scheme. DPS Society 

 officiating secretary Sheila Markan said this in an affidavit 

 filed in Delhi High Court. The court is hearing a petition 

 filed by three parents challenging a single-bench judgment, 

 which on January 12, 2003, had rejected a plea against interviewing 

 children and their parents for nursery admissions.

 Councillor blow

 Mumbai (PTI): A court has set aside 

 the election of Congress councillor Shantidevi Kamleshkumar 

 Yadav from Kandivali (West) and declared Samajwadi Party 

 councillor Bimla Achelal Yadav elected. A voter had filed 

 a petition challenging Shantidevi?s election on the ground 

 that her caste certificate was bogus.

 Infiltration foiled

 Poonch (PTI): The army on Tuesday 

 foiled an infiltration bid along the Line of Control in 

 the Mendhar area of Poonch district and gunned down an intruder. 

 A group of six to seven infiltrators resorted to firing 

 when the troops challenged them. 

 Dalai Lama fit

 Mumbai (Reuters): The Dalai Lama 

 was found to be in excellent health after a routine health 

 check-up, according to a statement issued by Lilavati Hospital 

 on Tuesday.

 The army has completed fencing along the Line of Control in the Gurez sector, once considered a gateway for infiltration into the Kashmir Valley. Gurez is situated at 7,800 feet on the Bandipore-Gilgit road in Baramulla district.

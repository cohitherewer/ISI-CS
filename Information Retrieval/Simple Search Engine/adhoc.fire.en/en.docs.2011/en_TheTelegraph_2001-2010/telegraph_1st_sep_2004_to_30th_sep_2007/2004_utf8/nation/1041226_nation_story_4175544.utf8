 Mother echoes 

Anara plea

 New Delhi, Dec. 25 (PTI): The mother of Anara Gupta, the main accused in a pornographic CD case, today filed a petition with the National Commission for Women (NCW), claiming that the girl in the film is not her daughter. 

 ?The girl in the CD is very different from Anara. There is no resemblance,? Raj Rani said. She also urged that the probe into the case be put in the hands of the CBI. 

 Raj Rani?s 80-page petition says her 18-year-old daughter, a former Miss Jammu, was being ?framed and ?harassed? by police. 

 Anara, the police allege, was involved in making a pornographic VCD in connivance with a Jammu cable operator, Narendra Kohli. 

 The girl had petitioned the high court asking for a CBI inquiry and had also sought Rs 1 crore as damages from police officials, claiming they had forced her to confess that she had performed in the film.

 After meeting NCW chairperson Poornima Advani, Raj Rani spoke to the media. ?I told the commission how my entire family was kept in illegal detention for 11 days and tortured by the police. It was when Anara could no longer bear to see her mother being beaten up that she said she got involved in the making of the CD,? she said.

 ?I don?t know why all this is happening, but one possibility could be that there is a tie-up between the CD mafia and the policemen. We have no faith in the police or the crime branch, which is why we have urged for a CBI probe.? 

 She was accompanied to the commission by her son Kumar Sangam and brother Sanjay Sachdeva, the president of the Delhi unit of the Panther?s Party. Raj Rani, who arrived here yesterday, will also approach the National Human Rights Commission. 

 The women?s body has asked Raj Rani to come back on Monday with the CDs of TV programmes Anara has worked in and the CD in question, as well as some documents. ?She appears to be an extremely unhappy mother to me. It was a weeping mother who presented her case to me. She spoke about the alleged atrocities committed by the police on the entire family,? Advani said. 

 On the commission?s stance regarding Raj Rani?s appeal for a CBI probe, Advani said: ?If justice is not being done in the case, then the CBI probe is a probable solution. But it is too early for me to say.?

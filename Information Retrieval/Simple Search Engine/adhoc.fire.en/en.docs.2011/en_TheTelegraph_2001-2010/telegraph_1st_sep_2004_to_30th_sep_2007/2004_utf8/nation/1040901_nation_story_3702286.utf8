 President to pilgrim-poet

THE 

POEM

 Many many 

years ago our Gurus lit the lamp

And the Prakasham was born carrying power of the soul

This light of truth on the land of five rivers

It orbited and orbited around the Sun

Along with the earth that carried it as Sindur

This earthly Prakasham is so powerful

Of human universal message of one God

Four hundred orbits gone in no time

The great Prakasham has even outglowed the Sun

As it orbits all around the Sun, even the Sun bows in enhanced reverence

And salutes the Earth, for all that it carries

The greatest Prakasham of Guru Granth Sahib

Amritsar, Aug. 31: A.P.J. Abdul Kalam played pilgrim and poet today to mark the 400th anniversary of the installation of the Guru Granth Sahib that has been dubbed the Prakash Utsav.

 The President first prayed at the Golden Temple and later enthralled the audience at the Guru Nanak Dev University by holding forth on the relevance of the holy book by reciting a poem he penned in praise of the Sikh scripture. He termed his ode Gurus Prakasham.

 Kalam said he penned his poem as he flew in from Delhi. I had thought about it in Tamil. This is its English version, he said before reading it out.

 As thousands of devotees cheered during his visit to the temple to pray for the wellbeing of the universe, Kalam termed the Granth Sahib the greatest treasure of mankind which had added relevance today. The Guru Granth Sahib is a national treasure; it should be preserved for centuries in its original form, he said.

 I find in Guru Granth Sahib a universal guru. The divine and heroic life of all the 10 gurus gives us many examples to emulate for eternity. The great two missions of Guru Arjan Dev (who compiled the Granth and installed it in the temple) has given unique holy treasures to humanity and we can derive many practical principles and best practices of management as well.

 Guru Granth Sahib is a great human heritage and belongs thus to the whole world. It is all the more relevant in todays world as we see much strife amidst great many possibilities of universal happiness. I see in it a practical guide for life and a spiritual guide to elevate the soul. I am also happy to see that many good authentic translations of Guru Granth Sahib are available now from different sources.

 Kalam, who was presented a robe and kirpan inside the temple, said the books essence was a message of love, humanism, equality and coexistence.

 I have been struck by the great universal spirit behind the teachings of the Sikh gurus. Despite the difficult periods in which they lived, they held the principles of the oneness of God high, and the equality of all human beings before them. Their concern for the poor, downtrodden and oppressed people was very high. They were ready to sacrifice everything in upholding the principles and to bring justice to the people, he said.

 The gurus instituted the system of langar which asserts the principle of equality of all in action and also removed the hunger and pain of the poor. In one of the five projects of the Surat Spiritual Declaration, this beautiful concept of langar has been introduced to inculcate unity of minds among our people and to develop them as enlightened citizens, Kalam said.

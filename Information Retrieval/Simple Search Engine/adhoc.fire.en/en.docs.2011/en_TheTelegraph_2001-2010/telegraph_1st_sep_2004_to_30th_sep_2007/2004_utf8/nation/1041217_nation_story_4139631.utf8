 ?Evil? eye cry earns bakery judge?s wrath

 CHANDRIMA BHATTACHARYA

 Mumbai, Dec. 16: In another 

 shock in the course of the Best Bakery retrial, Shehrunnisa 

 Sheikh, mother of star witness Zahira, was arrested on the 

 second day of her deposition at the special court in Mumbai 

 for contempt of court.

 She was kept in custody for more than an hour, after which judge Abhay Thipse served her a show cause notice asking why action should not be taken against her for contempt of court. Shehrunnisa told the judge she had made a mistake and asked to be forgiven.

 But the judge, observing that ?the witness was persistently prevaricating? and had shown a ?defiant attitude? towards the court, said that some penalty had to be imposed on her. He slapped a fine of Rs 100. If she fails to pay this, she will have to serve simple imprisonment for three days.

 Soon after the judge initiated contempt of court proceedings against Shehrunnisa, her advocate Harshad Ponda withdrew from the case. He said he would not represent her, though he is also appearing for the other members of her family, her four sons and daughters, who are witnesses in the case.

 Shehrunnisa incurred the judge?s wrath from yesterday, as she refused to answer most of the questions put to her and made statements to the court that were obviously not true. But today the court took serious offence when she pointed to a person in the audience and said he was ?looking? at her, suggesting an evil intent.

 The person, Raees Khan, is an activist-colleague of Teesta Setalvad, who worked to bring the Best Bakery case to light.

 The judge told Shehrunnisa to address the court and not to look at others. But she continued to look at Khan and said he was ?looking? at him and making gestures.

 The judge told her that she could be held guilty of contempt of court and punished. To this, Shehrunnisa replied: ?Any punishment is welcome.?

 The judge then asked police personnel present in the court to immediately take her into custody and court proceedings were stopped for more than an hour.

 When they resumed, Shehrunnisa, with her head bent, said that she was sorry and begged the court?s pardon. The judge told her that such behaviour would not be tolerated.

 Yesterday Shehrunnisa had called Setalvad a ?goonda? and said she had threatened to kill her family members. She also said she was happy that her daughter Sabera was killed in the carnage at Best Bakery, otherwise she would have had to pay for her marriage.

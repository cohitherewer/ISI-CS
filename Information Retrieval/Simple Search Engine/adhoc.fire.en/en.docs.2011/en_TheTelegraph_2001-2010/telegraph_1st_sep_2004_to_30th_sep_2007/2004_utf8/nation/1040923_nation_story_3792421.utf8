 YSR quota salvo at Naidu 

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Reddy

 Hyderabad, Sept. 22: Andhra Pradesh chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy today blamed his predecessor . Chandrababu Naidu for failing to provide reservation for Muslims in the current academic year.

 Reacting to the high court verdict that struck down the government?s move to provide 5 per cent quota for them in jobs and educational institutions, Reddy said the backward class commission appointed by Naidu?s Telugu Desam Party government in 1995 had failed. The commission stopped functioning in 2002.

 The chief minister said the state government?s stand was vindicated by the high court, which upheld its argument that reservation is essential for the Muslim community?s all-round growth. ?The court has only questioned the criteria and rationale but not the purpose,? he said.

 ?The commission on which the TDP government spent Rs 2.71 crore had not given even an interim report during its eight years of existence,? the chief minister said, explaining the reasons for opting for a report of the minority commission instead. 

 ?We might have been hasty, but we only wished to fulfil our election promise during the current academic year itself,? he added.

 He said his government would follow the high court judgment and set up a backward class commission within three months and seek a report by six months. 

 Reddy added that he hoped to provide reservation to Muslim youths ?at least during the next academic year?.

 Following the high court verdict, nearly 119 medical, 42 dental, 3,472 engineering, 438 law, 607 MBA and 1,697 BEd seats will be taken away from minorities, he pointed out.

 The chief minister said his government has already constituted a sub-committee of a group of ministers to give recommendations on the creamy layer among the backward classes.

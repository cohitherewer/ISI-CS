 Maoist cloud on king visit 

 FARHANA KALAM

 Gaya, Dec. 23: The CPI (Maoist) has called upon the people of the country ? especially those in Bihar, Uttaranchal, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal, the states which share a border with Nepal ? to oppose the 11-day visit of King Gyanendra.

 In a two-page statement, outfit secretary Ganapati said the people should stand up to the king of Nepal for his ?repressive and anti-democratic policies? at home and efforts to ?silence the masses?.

 According to the statement, ?the Indian ruling classes are going to wage an undeclared and deceitful war on the people of Nepal and the People?s Liberation Army?. 

 The main purpose of Gyanendra?s visit is to ?ensure the support of the four bordering states of Bengal, Bihar, UP and Uttaranchal for the deployment of Indian armed forces and beefing up hundreds of outposts, which have emerged in the recent past to monitor activities of the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)?, the note added.

 The statement alleged that Gyanendra was playing a ?double game? in India. While the king was trying to get the support of the UPA government in his fight action against Maoists back home, he was also hand-in-glove with the Sangh parivar, particularly the Vishwa Hindu Parishad.

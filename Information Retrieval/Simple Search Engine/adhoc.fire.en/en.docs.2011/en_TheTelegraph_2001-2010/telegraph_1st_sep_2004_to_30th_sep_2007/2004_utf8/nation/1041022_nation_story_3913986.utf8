 Security tops twin-trip agenda

 PRANAY SHARMA

 New Delhi, Oct. 21: Three days after Myanmar?s Senior General Than Shwe?s state visit to India ends, the Bangladesh foreign minister will arrive for official talks.

 Shwe, the chairman of Myanmar?s State Peace and Development Committee, is scheduled to leave on October 28 after a five-day visit. Bangladesh?s Morshed Khan will arrive on October 31 for a three-day trip.

 Both Myanmar and Bangladesh have been identified as the two major countries where a large number of Northeast insurgent groups have been taking shelter.

 After the series of bomb blasts in Assam and Nagaland over the last few months, the states have demanded that Delhi urgently raise the presence of the insurgents with the authorities of the two countries.

 The back-to-back visits are significant because of the growing violence in the Northeast and rising Indian security concerns.

 There is every indication that Shwe will want to make his visit a success and thus try to go out of his way to accommodate Delhi?s security concerns.

 An assurance from Myanmar to act on Northeast insurgents using its territory is bound to increase pressure on Bangladesh to do something when Morshed meets the Indian leadership.

 The ostensible reason for Morshed?s visit is to invite Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to Dhaka for the January Saarc summit. 

 But during his talks here, Morshed is likely to hear some plain-speaking from Delhi on bilateral ties, particularly security-related issues.

 ?If Morshed claims he is the best friend of India in Bangladesh, then it is about time he starts delivering on some of our concerns,? a senior South Block official said.

 ?We want to deliver a tough message to him that for good neighbourly relations, Dhaka has to take some urgent and visible steps on the Northeast insurgents,? the official added.

 Morshed had expressed his desire to visit India earlier this month. But South Block was reluctant to let him come because of what Delhi perceived as Dhaka?s indifference to repeated Indian requests to take urgent steps against the insurgents using Bangladeshi territory.

 In order to delay Morshed?s visit, Delhi informed the Bangladesh government that since the foreign minister would be out of India at the time of Morshed?s planned tour, it would be better to postpone it.

 A section of the Indian foreign ministry felt his visit should be finalised only after foreign office consultations between the two sides scheduled for November 8 and 9.

 But now foreign secretary Shyam Saran will be out of the country on those dates. So it was finally decided to allow Morshed to come before the foreign office consultations since it would now be held at a later date.

 Morshed?s stock in India plummeted following his ?unprovoked? remarks against Delhi some weeks ago. He had told some ?young journalists? from India that Delhi?s big-brotherly attitude was a hurdle to better relations.

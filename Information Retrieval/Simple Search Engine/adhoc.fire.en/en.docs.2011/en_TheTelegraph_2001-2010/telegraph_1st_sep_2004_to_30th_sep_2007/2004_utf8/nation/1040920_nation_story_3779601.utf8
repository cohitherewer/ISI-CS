 Manipur students target Hindi

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Imphal, Sept. 19: Two student groups of Manipur have declared a ban on teaching Hindi in all educational institutions and the closure of NCC training centres from Tuesday, plunging the state into pandemonium after a short spell of restraint. 

 The All Manipur Students? Union and the Democratic Students? Alliance of Manipur, part of the group of 32 that is leading the agitation against the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, said their decision to prevent Hindi from being taught in educational institutions was provoked by Delhi?s allegedly nonchalant attitude towards the region.

 The state has been in turmoil since the Assam Rifles arrested and shot Thangjam Manorama, claiming she was a member of the banned People?s Liberation Army. She was allegedly sexually assaulted before her death.

 A three-member team from the National Commission for Women, headed by chairperson Purnima Advani, reached Imphal today on a three-day mission to assess the condition of women in the state and other related issues.

 The presidents of the two student organisations, K. Umesh and . Romesh Meetei, said in a joint statement that Delhi had denied the people of Manipur and other Northeast states their ?basic rights?, including the ?right to life?. The duo said learning the national language was ?meaningless? if the government did not show the same concern for Manipur as it does for states outside the Northeast.

 The student leaders said it is surprising that the Prevention of Terrorism Act was put on the chopping block, while the armed forces act was being persisted with. ?The ban on Hindi will remain in force till the armed forces act is withdrawn. Any form of repressive measures will not deter the students. They are prepared to continue the agitation until the act is withdrawn.? 

 Students from the primary school to the university level have been boycotting their classes. That phase of the agitation ends tomorrow, but the Okram Ibobi Singh government will have to contend with something more serious than boycott of classes. 

 A blockade of the two national highways passing through the state began at midnight tonight. The Apunba Lup, comprising representatives of all the organisations participating in the agitation, said the blockade would continue till October 4. It urged all vehicle owners not to use the two highways.

 Amid the gathering storm, the NCW team began meeting members of NGOs. Advani said the commission?s objective was to gather authentic information about the condition of women.

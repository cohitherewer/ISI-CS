 Sikh voice for Behzti writer 

 London, Dec. 25 (PTI): Sikh leaders in Britain have appealed for withdrawal of the death threats against Gurpreet Kaur Bhatti, the writer of the controversial play Behzti (Dishonour), who is now in hiding.

 The British Sikh Consultative Forum, the national body of Sikh organisations, in its statement said it did not support any form of threat to the author. ?We unequivocally appeal to anyone who may have made these threats to withdraw them. They have no endorsement from the Sikh community.

 ?We understand the high tensions on all sides of this unfortunate incident and regret that matters went beyond the process of dialogue and reason. We hope that further progress on the balance between liberty to offend and right to dignity can proceed within the law and with civility,? the statement added.

 Behzti was being staged at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre but was stopped after violent protests from some members of the Sikh community. The play featured sexual abuse, kissing, dancing, homosexuality and murder in a gurdwara, which is said to have infuriated many Sikhs. 

 Officials at the Birmingham Rep decided to abandon the three-week run last week on grounds of safety as Sikh leaders said they could not ensure there would not be a repeat of violence.

 The Birmingham Stage Company later offered to stage the play but then abandoned the plan after a request from Bhatti. Birmingham Stage Company?s actor-manager Neal Foster said the request was made because of ?increased threats? to her safety. He said he, too, had received several threatening phone calls.

 The row has led many to criticise the demonstrations as a curb on free speech.

 On Thursday, more than 400 known figures from the world of art signed a letter supporting the playwright.

 Poet laureate Andrew Motion, director Richard Eyre and writer Willy Russell were among those who wrote to the Guardian supporting Bhatti. The letter said: ?Those who use violent means to silence it must be vigorously opposed and challenged.?

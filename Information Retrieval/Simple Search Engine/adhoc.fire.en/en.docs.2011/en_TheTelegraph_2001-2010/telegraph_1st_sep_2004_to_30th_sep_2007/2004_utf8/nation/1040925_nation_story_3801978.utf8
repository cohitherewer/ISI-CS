 Kabaddi player gets life term

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 24: A national-level kabaddi player and her lovestruck boyfriend accused of beheading her former boyfriend were sentenced to life imprisonment by a Delhi court today.

 Additional sessions judge J.M. Malik sentenced Gurdeep Kaur and her boyfriend Amandeep to life and fined them Rs 5,000 each for the murder of Deepak Kapur, whose head was chopped off at an isolated spot near the Talkatora Gardens parking lot here.

 Gurdeep studied at Janaki Devi Mahavidyalaya here and was a national level kabaddi player and Amandeep had participated in many international cycling events.

 The murder came to light when beat constable Bhagwan Sahay discovered Deepak?s headless body on March 9, 2003, near the parking lot.

 Investigations led police to Deepak?s brother Yogesh with whom he ran a shop in Connaught Place. Yogesh said his brother met friends Rakesh and Gaurav the day he was killed; they told the police he was in love with Gurdeep and often met her at the garden. 

 When the police questioned Gurdeep, she broke down and revealed that Deepak had continued to harass her even after they broke up. Tired of this, she asked Amandeep to help her get rid of Deepak.

 Hatching a plan, Gurdeep called Deepak to the garden where Amandeep attacked him with a knife and chopped off his head, the athlete said.

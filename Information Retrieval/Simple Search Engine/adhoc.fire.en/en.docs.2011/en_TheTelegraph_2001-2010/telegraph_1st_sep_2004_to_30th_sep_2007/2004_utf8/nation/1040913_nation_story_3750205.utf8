 Naxalite peace talks

 Karimnagar, Sept. 12: Renewed liquor prohibition and land distribution to the poor will figure in the People?s War Group?s proposed peace talks with the Andhra Pradesh government next month.

 This was indicated by poet and PWG emissary P. Varavara Rao at a public meeting of the Jana Shakti faction of the CPI (Marxist-Leninist) at Vemulawada town in Karimnagar district yesterday.

 Prohibition was lifted in 1997 during the . Chandrababu Naidu regime.

 Rao took the opportunity to iterate that the PWG would not go back on peace talks proposed to begin in the first week of October and also would not give up arms as suggested by the state government.

 Almost 20,000 activists and sympathisers turned up for the meeting in the town famous for its Shiva temple. Several were tribal and Dalit leaders from Chhattisgarh.

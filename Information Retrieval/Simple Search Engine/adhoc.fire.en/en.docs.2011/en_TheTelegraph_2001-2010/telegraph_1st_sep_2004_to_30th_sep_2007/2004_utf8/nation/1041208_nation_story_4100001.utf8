 Lanka concert dust

 Shah Rukh

 Colombo, Dec. 7 (PTI): Sri Lanka?s Buddhist clergy today marched to the Indian high commission here, urging Delhi to scrap a Shah Rukh Khan concert that coincides with the first death anniversary of a popular monk.

 The monks said they had no objection to Khan and his troupe performing in Sri Lanka, but did not want Saturday?s Colombo concert to go ahead as planned since it coincides with the first death anniversary of monk Gangodawila Soma. The monks want to observe Saturday as a day of mourning.

 ?We request you to inform Mr Shah Rukh Khan about the special two days of religious activities (over the weekend),? the monks said in a petition to high commissioner Nirupama Rao.

 There was no response from the organisers of Temptation 2004, whose tickets are going for Rs 10,000 ($100) apiece. The concert is being billed as Sri Lanka?s biggest musical show of the year.

 ?We will stage peaceful demonstrations to block the show,? a spokesman for the all-clergy National Heritage Party said.

(Shah Rukh?s spokesperson said she was aware of the incident, but would not comment, our special correspondent adds from Mumbai. She added a decision would be taken soon and those involved in organising the concert were looking into the matter.)

 The monk?s death saw an upsurge in attacks against non-Buddhists in Buddhist-majority Sri Lanka. Soma had been a staunch campaigner against what Buddhists term ?unethical conversions?.

 The national organisation of Buddhist monks also urged the Sri Lankan government to cancel the concert.

 Shah Rukh?s troupe includes actors Preity Zinta, Saif Ali Khan, Priyanka Chopra, Zayed Khan and Celina Jaitly.

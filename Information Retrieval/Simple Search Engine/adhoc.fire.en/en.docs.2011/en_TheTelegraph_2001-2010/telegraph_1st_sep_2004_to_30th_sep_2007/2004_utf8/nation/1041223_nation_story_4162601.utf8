 Kanchi suspect takes confession U-turn

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 (Top) Sankaracharya, Appu: Conspirators? 

 Kancheepuram, Dec. 22: On a day when Appu, one of the chief accused in the Shankar Raman murder, was remanded in six more days of police custody, another accused, Rajnikanth alias Chinna, denied having made any confession under Section 164.

 Amid these developments, confusion reigned over the whereabouts of the second accused, Chennai-based builder Ravi Subramanian.

 The biggest twist of the day was provided by Chinna, a member of the five-man gang ? allegedly headed by Appu ? which killed Raman, manager of the Sri Varadaraja Perumal temple, on September 3. 

 Kanchi seer Jayendra Saraswati, the first accused in the case, was arrested in connection with the murder on November 11.

 Chinna made his statement when he was produced before first judicial magistrate G. Uthamaraj today for extension of remand. 

 His statement led the magistrate to say: ?Do not worry if you have not given any (Section) 164 statement.?

 Darwin Wisdom, Chinna?s lawyer, later said the prosecution had cited his statement as a basis for arresting the seer. The statement of another key accused, Kathiravan, also contributed to the Kanchi seer?s arrest.

 It would appear that Chinna had only made a statement under Section 161 before an investigating officer ? such a statement is not admissible as evidence in court. Wisdom said he would file a separate application tomorrow before the magistrate to get a copy of Chinna?s statement.

 The judicial remand of Chinna, Kathiravan and two others was extended till January 3 today. Kathiravan had retracted the Section 164 confessional statement he had made before another magistrate here.

 Expectations had been raised that Subramanian, believed to have been already arrested, would be produced for remand but police said the accused was still absconding. 

 Subramanian is alleged to be the conduit for the funds said to be sent by the Kanchi mutt to Appu?s gang.

 When a smiling Appu, alias Krishnasamy Reddy, was produced in court for extending his police remand, he told the magistrate he had been treated well in custody. He was arrested by a Tamil Nadu police team in Andhra Pradesh last Sunday.

 Public prosecutor S. Jayakumar and assistant investigating officer C. Rajamani asked for eight more days of police custody for Appu, saying fresh revelations in the case needed to be investigated. 

 Asked for his response, Appu said: ?I have no objection. I leave it to the court.?

 Even as Uthamaraj appeared startled by this response, Appu?s lawyers stepped in to say that even the seer, the first accused in the case, had been kept in police custody for only three days. 

 They pointed out that Appu had ?made himself available to the police? and had not been arrested as police claimed, saying this should be taken into consideration. The lawyers added that he was cooperating with police.

 But Jayakumar argued that though Appu is alleged to have only ?conspired? with the seer, he is ?the man behind the murder? and is very important as an accused in the case. Police custody should thus be extended to help complete the investigation.

 Appu was eventually remanded in custody till Monday.

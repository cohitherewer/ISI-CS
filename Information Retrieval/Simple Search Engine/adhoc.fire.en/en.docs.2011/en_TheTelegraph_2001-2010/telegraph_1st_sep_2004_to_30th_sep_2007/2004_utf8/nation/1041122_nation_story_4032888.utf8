 ?Pragmatic? PM plan on foreign camps

 ANUPAM BORDOLOI

 Imphal, Nov. 21: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today said India had adopted a pragmatic approach to the task of persuading Bangladesh and Myanmar to deal with Northeast militant groups operating from their territories.

 ?We can choose our friends but not our neighbours,? he said on being asked during a news conference in Imphal if India ought to act tough with Bangladesh. 

 Singh said he drew the attention of the Bangladesh Prime Minister to the activities of militant outfits operating from that country when they met in Bangkok a few months ago.

 On Myanmar, the Prime Minister said the country?s ruler, Senior General Than Shwe, gave an assurance during his recent visit to New Delhi that the junta would crack the whip on anti-India militant groups. 

 ?They have assured us that they will not allow their territory to be used against us,? Singh said.

 The northeastern states, especially Assam, maintain that militancy will continue to fester as long as militant groups continue to operate out of their bases in Bangladesh and Myanmar.

 Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi has gone so far as to admit that Bhutan?s offensive last year did not succeed in finishing off the Ulfa and the National Democratic Front of Boroland.

 On attempts to bring the Ulfa to the negotiation table, the Prime Minister said the United Progressive Alliance government was willing to talk to any group that was ready to shun violence. 

 ?This is an open invitation to all young men and women who have taken to arms to give up this path and to work with us to bring peace and prosperity,? he said.

 The Prime Minister described his two-day visit to Manipur as a mission to ?promote the cause of peace and accelerate the pace of development?. 

 He appealed to all groups ?to give peace a chance? because it was the foremost requirement for development.

 The highlight of Singh?s visit was handing over posse-sion of the historical Kangla Fort, hitherto occupied by the Assam Rifles, to the Manipur government. 

 The people of the state had long been demanding that the paramilitary force vacate the fort.

 There were expectations of an economic package on the lines of the one announced for Jammu and Kashmir a few days ago, but the Prime Minister said that he did not believe in doling out grants for the sake of it. 

 ?I am not going about announcing packages and distributing money. As there was need for funds in Kashmir, our government has come forward to help the state,? he said.

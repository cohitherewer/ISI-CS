 New ?front? dares Laloo 

 - Group of eight puts ball in court of LJP and Dal

 ASHISH SINHA

 Paswan, Mulayam: With whom?

 Patna, Dec. 19: Lok Janshakti Party leader Ram Vilas Paswan?s ?love? for the Congress and the Janata Dal (United)?s ?weakness? for the BJP was put to test by a group of eight smaller players today, which joined hands to oppose the Rashtriya Janata Dal in the Bihar Assembly election.

 They invited the LJP and the JD(U) to dump their present friends and join the new combination to give a ?viable alternative? to the electorate in an attempt to defeat the ruling RJD.

 The leading lights of the new ?front? are the CPI(ML) and Mulayam Singh Yadav?s Samajwadi Party while fringe outfits like the Samata Party, Samajwadi Janata Party and Rashtriya Lok Dal are also part of it. The presence of the Bharatiya Momin Front, a representative of a minority community, is significant because Laloo Prasad Yadav has constantly appealed to the Muslim-Yadav combine for votes.

 The CPI(ML) has its pockets of influence in central and south Bihar while the real strength of the Samajwadi Party, which garnered impressive votes in the Lok Sabha election, is yet to be tested.

 The parties will contest on their respective symbols and manifestos but decided to chalk out a ?common minimum programme? to make seat adjustments. ?We will make famine, crime, unemployment, scarcity of electricity and irrigation our main election issues,? CPI(ML) central committee member Krishna Dev Yadav said.

 The representatives described as ?unfortunate? the CPM?s stand that it will continue its alliance with the RJD. They appealed to the CPM and the CPI to reconsider their positions vis-?-vis Laloo Prasad in the interests of the people of Bihar.

 The new alliance will garner strength only if the LJP or the JD(U) or both join hands with it. ?It is the first step towards presenting an alternative to the electorate, which is reeling under the excesses of the government led by the RJD and clearly wants to keep off the BJP,? Samajwadi Party leader Shankar Prasad Tekriwal said.

 The development came on the day the LJP reiterated its position on contesting all 243 seats. Paswan is ready to join hands with the JD(U) only if the latter leaves the BJP, a possibility that appears remote at present.

 ?We have asked for the list of probable candidates from the block and district heads of all constituencies. Applications are available on the payment of Rs 5,000 and Rs 2,500 for general and reserved category hopefuls at our office in Patna,? party MLA Satish Kumar said.

 The BJP today set up a 10-member committee that will prepare the party?s manifesto for the February election. The party has appointed Bhagalpur MP Sushil Kumar Modi as the chief of its campaign committee.

 ?The RJD is openly flouting the model code of conduct by holding the December 23 rally. We have appealed to the chief electoral officer to get all billboards, posters and welcome arches removed. But no action has been taken so far. A party delegation will meet the chief election commissioner in this regard,? Modi said.

 The RJD, however, has not paid much attention to the allegations levelled against it. Laloo Prasad was seen distributing Rs 100 notes among poor women in the Bihta region of Patna, which the BJP described as a violation of the model code of conduct.

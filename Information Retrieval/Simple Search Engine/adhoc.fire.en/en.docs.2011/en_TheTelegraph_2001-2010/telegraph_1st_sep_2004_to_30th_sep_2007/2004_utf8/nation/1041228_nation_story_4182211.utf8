 Paswan says no, BJP hangs on

 KAY BENEDICT

 New Delhi, Dec. 27: Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan today categorically ruled out any understanding with the BJP, post or pre-poll, but the BJP remains hopeful.

 There can be a tacit understanding between the BJP and the Lok Janshakti Party only if the Congress decides to stick with Laloo Prasad Yadav?s Rashtriya Janata Dal.

 However, Paswan today declared that ?kichad se kichad saaf nahin hota (dirt cannot be used to clean dirt)?, meaning that the BJP cannot be used to wipe out the RJD.

 BJP sources said that in their assessment, Muslim votes will by and large stay between the RJD and the Congress, and the feelers from Janata Dal (United) leader Nitish Kumar notwithstanding, the Congress is unlikely to junk the RJD at this juncture.

 For Paswan and the BJP, the sources added, Laloo Prasad Yadav is the common enemy in Bihar and without mutual collaboration, neither can take him on.

 Sources said while the LJP chief is going all out to woo a chunk of the 15 per cent Muslim voteshare in the state, the BJP is using Nitish Kumar to work out an understanding with Paswan, keeping the post-poll scenario in mind.

 Asked to identify his biggest enemy, Paswan said the ?removal of RJD was his top priority?. However, he added, ?the BJP is nowhere in the fight today. Not only in Bihar, but elsewhere in the country also, the saffron party has ceased to be a deciding factor?.

 Sounding a warning to Paswan, senior BJP leader Pyarelal Khandelwal said: ?If Mr Paswan goes it alone, he will not get even a dozen seats. Why should people vote for the LJP? Why should they waste their votes??

 Khandelwal urged all anti-Laloo Prasad forces, including Paswan, to join hands. ?We want to defeat the RJD. All anti-Laloo forces should unite and not split the anti-Laloo votes.?

Babri barb

 Union law minister H.R. Bhardwaj has dismissed charges that the UPA government is ?vindictive? and is ?targeting? L.K. Advani in the Babri Masjid demolition case.

 The minister clarified that the PMO official?s letter to the CBI to initiate the case against the BJP president was a ?routine one?.

 Dated December 8, the letter said the law ministry may be asked to ?examine if there are any legal provisions and grounds for the CBI to file a revision (petition) against discharge of Shri L.K. Advani at this stage and examine if there is any negligence on the part of any investigation/prosecuting agency in not filing a revision petition on time?.

 Bhardwaj said: ?Advani should be grateful to the CBI for not filing the revision petition against the Rae Bareli court order dropping charges against him. We are not politically motivated. We are doing nothing against him.?

 He accused the Opposition of raising an unnecessary controversy. The PMO, he hastened to add, is entitled to enquire about the status of cases pending in courts. ?The government is doing what is legally permissible.?

 Breather for Met boss

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 31: Science and technology minister Kapil Sibal today ruled out action against the Indian Meteorological Department director-general till investigations are over.

 A 30-year-old woman has accused S.K. Srivastava of rape and death threats. After failing to register a case at Lodhi Colony police station, she subsequently filed it with R.K. Puram police station about two days ago.

 He (Srivastava) will remain in office till investigations are over, Sibal said. The IMD chief is learnt to have made a representation before the minister today.

 Sibal said he had received a complaint against Srivastava in July and had initiated an inquiry. 

 Clarifying he had not met the woman concerned, Sibal said: It (the case) is very unfortunate. A person in high position should be highly circumspect about his actions. It is of great concern to me that charges have been made I consider it a very serious charge.

 Sources said the woman alleged that Srivastava was sexually exploiting her for the last 10 years and also threatened to kill her husband.

 The woman has filed a very detailed FIR and we have to verify the facts before we can take any action. It is a case of inducement, allurement and coercion, said Deependra Pathak, the deputy commissioner of police, southwest district.

 Sibal, also an eminent lawyer, said: There is a law and action needs to be taken according to it. He added that action could be taken under conduct rules as such cases were outside the ambit of police investigations that need proof.

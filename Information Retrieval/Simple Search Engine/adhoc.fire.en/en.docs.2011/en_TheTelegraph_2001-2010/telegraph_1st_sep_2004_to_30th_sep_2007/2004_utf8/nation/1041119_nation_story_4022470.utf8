 Bihar doctors end strike

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Nov. 18: The Bihar unit of the Indian Medical Association today called off its indefinite strike, bringing relief to thousands of patients across the state. 

 Yesterday, Dr Nagendra Prasad, abducted from Vaishali on October 28, returned home and an arrest was made in the murder of surgeon N.K. Agrawal. The government also assured the doctors that they need not worry about security.

 The IMA steering committee will meet on Monday to decide its course of action. ?We will review the steps the government takes and will also try and get its written assurance on all our demands,? said IMA state unit president Vijay Shankar Singh.

 Prasad, whose relatives yesterday said he escaped from the clutches of his captors, attended the IMA meeting today. But police claimed they secured Prasad?s release by exerting pressure on his abductors.

 At the meeting, the doctor was critical of the IMA. ?What have you done for me? I am getting threats even now,? he said.

 Doctor liability case thrown open

 R.VENKATARAMAN

 New Delhi, Sept. 9: Doctors heaving a sigh of relief after a Supreme Court bench ruled they could not be held criminally liable for ?mere negligence? will have to wait as another bench today referred the judgment to a full five-judge Constitution bench.

 Justices Arijit Passayat and C.K. Thakker, who were hearing a case in which a doctor from Punjab sought relief from criminal liability, referred the matter to a Constitution bench. 

 A division bench of Justices Y.K. Sabharwal and D.M. Dharmadhikari had recently held that doctors could not be held criminally liable for ?mere negligence? and ?error in judgement?.

 When Krishan Mahajan, the counsel for Dr Jacob Mathew, cited the judgment, Justice Passayat shot back: ?How can you say that for a negligence resulting in the death of a patient, a doctor could not be held criminally responsible?? 

 ?We disagree with the judgment,? he added, and referred it to a larger bench.

 The instant case related to delay in fitting an oxygen cylinder, after which a patient died allegedly for lack of oxygen. Mahajan said the cylinder was empty, for which the hospital should be held responsible. 

 ?When another cylinder was hurriedly brought from some other ward, the instrument for opening it was not available, for which, again, only the hospital can be held responsible and not my client,? he argued. 

 Mahajan also contended that his client, Dr Mathew, was a paediatrician and had nothing to do with the patient who had died. ?However, on hearing a hue and cry from the ward where the patient was admitted, he rushed to render some help, in the absence of the doctor in charge of that ward. If he is charged with criminal liability, then in future, no doctor, or anyone else for that matter, would rush to the help of an ailing patient in emergency situations,? he argued.

 Justice Sabharwal and Justice Dharmadhikari had held that for fixing criminal liability on a doctor, the standard of negligence required to be proved should be so high as could be described as ?gross negligence? or ?reckless?. 

 ?Where a patient?s death results merely from an error of judgement or an accident, no criminal liability should be attached to it,? the judges had said. In such instances, there would only be a civil case against the doctor for compensation.

 Peoples for Better Treatment (PBT), an organisation of health activists, will also file a petition in the matter. Dr Kunal Saha of the PBT said from the US that the organisation would intervene, pleading that a doctor?s criminal liability could not be nullified in medical negligence cases.

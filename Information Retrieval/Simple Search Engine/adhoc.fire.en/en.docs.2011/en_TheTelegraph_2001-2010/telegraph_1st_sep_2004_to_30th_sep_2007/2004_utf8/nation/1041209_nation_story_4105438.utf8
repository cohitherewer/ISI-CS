 Indian jailed for wife murder bid

 Sydney (AP): A 35-year-old Indian was 

 sentenced to 16 years in prison for attempting to murder 

 his wife, who was pregnant with his brother?s child.

 Justice David Harper at Victoria state?s Supreme Court sentenced Rajinder Kumar to a minimum of 13 years without parole.

 Rajinder?s wife, Mamta Rani, was first married to his brother Baljinder and immigrated to Australia from India in the mid-nineties with her husband and his parents.

 In 1997, the family decided that Rani should divorce Baljinder and return to Punjab to marry his brother so that he could immigrate to Australia as well, the judge said.

 Accordingly, Rani returned to India and married Rajinder, who was granted an Australian visa in 2000.

 Once the couple arrived in Australia, Rani resumed her relationship with her former husband though she remained married to Rajinder.

 In November 2003, Rajinder attacked her, then pregnant with Baljinder?s child, in her home in Melbourne. 

 Justice Harper said he stabbed Rani in a fit of jealousy after using the woman to get a visa. He termed the actions of Rajinder and his family as ?morally repugnant?.

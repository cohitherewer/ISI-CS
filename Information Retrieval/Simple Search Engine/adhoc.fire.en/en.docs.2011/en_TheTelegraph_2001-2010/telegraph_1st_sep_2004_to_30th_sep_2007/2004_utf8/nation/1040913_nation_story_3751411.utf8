 4 die in strike on CRPF hub

 MUKHTAR AHMAD

 Srinagar, Sept. 12: Four persons were killed and seven others were wounded as a night-long gun battle between holed-up suicide attackers and paramilitary troops at Dalgate ended early this morning.

 The dead include two deputy commandants of the Central Reserve Police Force and two suicide attackers.

 ?The operation is over. The security forces gunned down the two suicide attackers. We lost two senior officers,? Inspector General of CRPF told The Telegraph.

 Police sources said the commanding officer of CRPF?s 94 Battalion was among the seven police officials injured in the gun battle that ended with security forces storming the battalion headquarters building. The injured are undergoing treatment in various hospitals here.

 A spokesman of the militant outfit Al-Mansoorain phoned local newspapers to claim responsibility for Saturday night?s attack.

 Paramilitary forces surrounded the Hotel York complex housing the battalion headquarters after the two attackers burst into the complex hurling grenades and firing from their automatic weapons. A police officer said: ?They managed to enter the complex from the rear, hurling several grenades and firing on the CRPF personnel guarding the complex. Reinforcements were immediately rushed and the area was surrounded.?

 ?Security forces gunned down a holed-up suicide attacker early today. The other attacker was shot dead by troops last night. We have searched the complex,? a police officer added.

 The area reverberated with heavy gunfire and explosions as the security forces engaged the militants in a gun battle.

 ?Though the marriage season is on, the night-long encounter virtually brought the entire neighbourhood to a standstill. Deafening sounds of explosions and gunfire kept us awake the whole night,? said Mohammad Ashraf, a bank employee who lives some distance away from the site of the gun battle.

 On July 27 this year, two suicide attackers stormed a paramilitary camp located on an isle on Dal Lake. Five CRPF men and two attackers died in the night-long gun battle. Most tourists throng the hotels in the area, houseboats on the Dal waters being in high demand from honeymooners.

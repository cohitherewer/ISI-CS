 Manipur defies boycott call

 OUR BUREAU

 Oct. 13: Voters turned out in large numbers for the Konthoujam Assembly byelection in Manipur today, defying the poll boycott and general strike called by Apunba Lup, the working committee of 32 organisations demanding withdrawal of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act. 

 While in the rest of the state people stayed indoors ? shops remained closed and vehicles stayed off the roads in response to the general strike ? polling was brisk in Konthoujam since morning. 

 By 1 pm, the polling booths had recorded 53 per cent voting. The polling, held under unprecedented security cover, was peaceful. Official sources said 30 heavily-armed BSF personnel were deployed at each of the 28 polling stations. Security posts at the entrance gave the centres a fortified look.

 ?We have instructions not to allow anyone, including ministers, MLAs and state police personnel, inside the polling stations. Only poll observers and voters are allowed,? a BSF official said. The voters and candidates, too, were frisked before allowing to cast their votes. Returning officer . Heramani Singh said it was the tightest security arrangement ever made for polling in the state.

 Six candidates, including two Independents, are in the fray for the Konthoujam seat. Counting is on Saturday. 

 The byelection was necessitated by the resignation of Thokchom Meinya Singh of the Congress after his election to the Lok Sabha. Bypolls to three Assembly segments in Nagaland were also peaceful. 

 Official sources said the average voter turnout was over 80 per cent at the end of the day.

 The voter turnout in Tehok constituency of Mon district was over 90 per cent and over 70 per cent in Tenning constituency of Peren district. The Aonglenden segment in Mokokchung district recorded over 85 per cent turn out. Polling was held amid tight security in all the three seats and was by and large peaceful. 

 Voting was also peaceful in the Moran Assembly constituency of Assam. The voter turnout here was 60 per cent. Although there are seven candidates in the fray, the contest has narrowed down to Congress candidate Jibontara Ghatowar and Parag Jyoti Baruah of the AGP.

 Cong on state tightrope

 K. SUBRAHMANYA

 New Delhi, Sept. 11: A wary Congress is treading with caution as it deals with the emotive clamour for creation of smaller states, aware that a hasty move could open the proverbial Pandora?s Box.

 Sources said the leadership seems to have decided to fall back on last year?s working committee resolution that talked of a second state reorganisation commission.

 Well-placed sources involved with the drafting of the manifesto for next month?s Assembly elections in Maharashtra said the draft proposed a second reorganisation commission to deal with the demand for a separate Vidarbha state.

 The demand has many enthusiastic proponents among Vidarbha region Congress leaders, including recently sacked state unit chief Ranjit Deshmukh.

 The draft is awaiting the clearance of the Congress? ally, the Nationalist Congress Party, as the two have decided to go to the polls with a joint manifesto.

 The sources, however, indicated that a second reorganisation commission is likely to remain on paper.

 When the working committee first proposed it in the context of the move to forge an alliance with the Telengana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) in Andhra Pradesh, it was in the form of a demand on the then Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led government.

 But now, the sources said, the situation is different as the Congress heads the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government at the Centre.

 Although the proposal for a second reorganisation commission was part of the initial drafts of the UPA?s common minimum programme, it was excluded from the CMP when it finally emerged in end-May.

 The CMP tackled the TRS? one-point agenda by promising consultations for a separate Telengana state and assuring a decision at an appropriate time. The mere promise of a state reorganisation commission may not have been to TRS leader K. Chandrasekhar Rao?s liking.

 The Congress? reluctance on the Vidarbha issue is being seen as a setback to the TRS. The high command has also cold-shouldered the request of Deshmukh ? who is reported to have asked Rao to campaign in Vidarbha ? for setting up a Vidarbha regional Congress committee on the lines of the Telengana regional Congress panel formed on the eve of the general elections.

 While the Congress remains tentative about a separate Vidarbha state, it is likely to come under pressure from Mayavati?s Bahujan Samaj Party.

 The BSP?s presence in the region caused a near-rout for the Congress in the Lok Sabha elections. The party now wants to consolidate its position and plans to issue a election manifesto supporting the demand for a separate Vidarbha state.

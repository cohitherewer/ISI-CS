 Terror law blow to BJP

 ALOKE TIKKU

 New Delhi, Sept. 22: Shivraj Patil today turned upon the Opposition for criticising the United Progressive Alliance?s repeal of the Prevention of Terrorism Act, saying its tirade would weaken the fight against terror.

 Speaking a day after President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam gave his assent to repeal the ?draconian? anti-terror law and incorporate anti-terror provisions in the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, the Union home minister said the anti-terror act had not helped curb terrorism. Patil has long spoken against the act due to its misuse and contradictions with Indian criminal jurisprudence.

 Patil also indicated that BJP-ruled states may not be able to enact anti-terrorist provisions even though their party leadership wants this done on the ground that the Pota repeal would cause a vacuum in the anti-terror machinery. Determined to project the anti-terror law?s repeal as a weakness in the UPA regime?s internal security strategy, the BJP leadership recently directed six party-ruled states to enact laws to replace the act.

 ?If there is a law created by the Centre and the state for the same purpose, the law enacted by the Centre will have precedence. That is the constitutional position,? Patil said. 

 The minister said the government had not left any gaping holes in the security apparatus as it had promulgated an ordinance to amend the unlawful activities act at the same time. ?It may not be as stringent as Pota but it can be used more wisely,? he added.

 The reference was to the ministry?s decision to keep out provisions giving police extraordinary powers to level charges that can keep the accused behind bars for months without having to substantiate their claim.

 The Unlawful Activities Prevention Amendment Ordinance retains most penal provisions that describe acts of terrorism in Pota but does not give law enforcement agencies the sweeping powers that had allegedly been misused in states where the law was used.

 Reel thrill for Laloo, praise from stars 

 ASHISH SINHA

 Patna, Sept. 12: The railway 

 minister knows that Padmashree Laloo Prasad Yadav, 

 due for an October 1 release, has nothing to do with persona. 

 But he has no hassles to lend his name to the Mahesh V. 

 Manjrekar film since he feels that it would help the people 

 understand Laloo Prasad Yadav better.

 ?People call me a joker and what not. But do you know that a sociological research is on at Harvard University on me? A large number of people are against me, but they have to be made aware of my real worth,? Laloo Prasad said in the company of his wife at the music release function of the film.

 Suneil Shetty, who plays Laloo in the film, which has three more characters ? Padmashree, Prasad and Yadav ? was much more candid. ?You know it very well why the film has got such a title. Lalooji is the most popular politician this country has. Obviously, people would be curious to watch a film that has his name as its title. It is a healthy comedy like Hera Pheri, which you can comfortably watch with family,? he explained.

 Laloo Prasad said he generally does not watch films. ?But I will see this movie. And I will not demand any royalty. My name is my royalty. I wish the venture all success. It will be a superhit,? the RJD president said.

 Rabri Devi too promised to watch the entire film. ?Bachche log is film ka gaana dekha hain TV par (Children have seen its songs on the TV). I am curious to watch the entire film,? she said. But Laloo Prasad provoked the chief minister and said there are rumours that Aishwarya Rai would be playing Rabri Devi in another film. ?Oh yes, I have also heard about the film. I do not know if the news is correct. But if someone makes a film on me, I will like to watch it too,? Rabri Devi said.

 Masumi, who plays Padmashree in the film, was visibly happy in the company of Bihar?s most famous couple. ?This is my first trip to Bihar and I was told about the place being rowdy and lawless. But my impression of Bihar has been the exact opposite of this stereotype. This is a friendly place with warm people,? she said.

 Most of the film has shot in South Africa. The story is about a group of people looking for diamonds that belonged to Padmashree?s late father, which have been stolen by his business partner.

 Asked if there was a role for Laloo Prasad himself in the film, Shetty said: ?Mahesh was very keen on it but I don?t know what happened to the idea. But let there be an element of surprise, which will be revealed only on the silver screen.?

 Kim Sharma, who is in love with Laloo in the film, said she is ?a great fan? of both Laloo Prasad and Rabri Devi. 

 ?I want to get Laloo in the film by any means. I will not tell you if I succeed. But let me tell you that Lalooji has a kamal ka persona,? she said.

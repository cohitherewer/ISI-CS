 Surjeet meet

 New Delhi, Sept. 3: CPM 

 general secretary Harkishen Singh Surjeet called on Congress 

 chief Sonia Gandhi a day after the Left leadership sounded 

 a warning on foreign direct investment limits, reports our 

 special correspondent.

 The CPM veteran was tight-lipped about the meeting at 10 Janpath that lasted 20 minutes, but senior party leaders said Surjeet had met Sonia for personal work.

 The co-ordination panel of the central alliance and the Left is to meet next month for another round of discussions on various issues, particularly the FDI cap.

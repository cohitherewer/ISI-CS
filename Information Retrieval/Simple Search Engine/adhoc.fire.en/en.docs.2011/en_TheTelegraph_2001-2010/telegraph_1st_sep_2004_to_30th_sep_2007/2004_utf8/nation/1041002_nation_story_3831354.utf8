 Live rockets in blast scrap

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 1: Twenty-five rockets, of which some were live, and three rocket launchers were found in the scrap that triggered a blast in Ghaziabad yesterday.

 The explosion occurred at the factory of Bhushan Steel Company when the scrap was being unloaded in the afternoon. Ten labourers were killed and 30 injured. 

 Two officials of the company ? general manager V.S. Verma and assistant general manager Ompal Singh ? were arrested today. 

 Factory officials said the 105-tonne scrap, had come in three trucks. As the first consignment was being unloaded using a crane with a magnetic field, a live rocket hidden in the scrap exploded.

 DIG, Meerut range, Chandrika Rai, said the scrap had come from Iran through Kandla Port in Gujarat but had managed to get customs clearance and was later brought to the Tughlakabad Depot here. 

 However, the police said no Iranian marks were found on the bombs and or the rocket launchers that were defused by the Bomb Disposal Squad. Forensic experts from Delhi and Agra have been called to inspect them.

 Additional Judicial Magistrate Chandra Prakash Pandey is conducting an inquiry into the incident while police was investigating a transporter from Muzaffarnagar District whose trucks were used to carry the scrap.

 District administration has ordered an interim-relief of Rs 10,000 to families of those killed in the blast.

 Nehru under RSS fire

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Chandigarh, Oct. 24: The RSS chief today denounced Jawaharlal Nehru, just two days after he blasted ?Marxputras? and ?Macaulayputras?.

 ?Nehru imposed the western concept of development which is the sole cause of many ills facing India,? K.S. Sudarshan said in an hour-long speech at the DAV College auditorium here during a book-release.

 Nehru, he claimed, was made the Prime Minister solely because he was Britain?s man in the Congress. ?Britain wanted a man who could be easily influenced.? 

 ?Instead of adopting Hindi after Independence, he chose to continue with English for 10 years. It was the most rude shock for Indian culture. We are ruing that decision even now,? the RSS chief said.

 On Friday, Sudarshan had said that ?Marxputras (offspring of Marx)? and ?Macaulayputras (the English-speaking class)? were ?conspiring to harm the Hindu forces?.

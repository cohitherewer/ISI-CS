 Mufti in Assembly

 MUKHTAR AHMAD

Srinagar, Oct. 16: Chief minister Mufti Mohammad 

Sayeed?s dream of heading the ruling alliance in the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly 

was fulfilled today when he won from Pahalgam. The win was his first in an Assembly 

poll from the Kashmir valley.

 Mufti, who had long wanted to be chief minister, made it to the top post after the 2002 state elections but had to be nominated to the Upper House to help him to the chair, raising Opposition eyebrows. 

 But today?s bypoll victory has given his post ?both moral and legal sanctity?.

 Mufti defeated his nearest National Conference rival by 5,200 votes. His People?s Democratic Party also won the Batmallo seat in summer capital Srinagar.

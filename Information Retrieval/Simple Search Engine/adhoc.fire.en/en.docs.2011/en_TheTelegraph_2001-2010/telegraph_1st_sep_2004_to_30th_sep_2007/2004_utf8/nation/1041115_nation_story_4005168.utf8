 Britain in dock for shipping out risk

 AMIT ROY

 London, Nov. 14: Britain?s ageing ships, which are being broken up in India, pose a serious risk to the health of the usually poor workers involved in dismantling tankers and others vessels, an all-party House of Commons committee warned last week.

 The report exposes the scandal of richer countries getting poorer ones to undertake dirty and risky work they would not do themselves.

 The British MPs disclosed that some of the ships contain such dangerous material as asbestos, polychlorinated biphenals (PCBs) and waste oils, with workers exposed to conditions ?unacceptable? by the standards of developed countries.

 The Commons Environment and Rural Affairs Committee said the need to outlaw irresponsible ship dismantling was ?urgent? and blamed the British government for turning a blind eye to standards of health, safety and environmental protection at ship-breaking yards in developing countries.

 The ships were being dismantled under ?wholly inadequate? conditions on beaches in India as well as in Pakistan and Bangladesh, the committee said.

 British TV has often horrified viewers by showing footage of impoverished, barefoot workers, in the breaking yards of Gujarat for example, hammering away on bits of steel.

 The committee?s warnings were endorsed by Greenpeace, on whose behalf Mark Strutt said: ?Greenpeace welcomes the environment committee?s report and agrees with its conclusions that dismantling British ships in wholly inadequate conditions in Asia or Turkey is unacceptable and must be stopped as a matter of urgency. We hope the government heeds the recommendations of the committee and ensures that from now on all government-owned vessels are dismantled in the UK.?

 He added: ?They should support the development of purpose-designed, state of the art ship recycling facilities in the UK and put pressure on commercial ship owners to cease sending ships contaminated with hazardous materials like asbestos, PCB and waste oils to developing countries.?

 Environment minister Elliot Morley commented: ?I welcome the committee?s report and recommendations on this important issue. I am in full agreement that ship dismantling must be undertaken in an environmentally and humanely sound manner and that urgent progress is needed at the international level to develop a solution.?

 He pointed out: ?The government is already actively engaged in international discussions on ship recycling. At home, work is under way on the development of a UK ship recycling strategy.?

 Under current rules, all remaining single-hulled tankers must be dismantled before 2015, many before 2010 and the oldest by the end of 2005.

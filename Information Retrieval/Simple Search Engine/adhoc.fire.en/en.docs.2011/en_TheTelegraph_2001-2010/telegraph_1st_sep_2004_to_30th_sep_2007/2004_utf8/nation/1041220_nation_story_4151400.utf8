 Atal sees space for Mulayam

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY 

 Lucknow, Dec. 19: Atal Bihari Vajpayee stirred fresh speculation about Mulayam Singh Yadav?s links with the BJP, saying he was willing to share a political platform with the Samajwadi Party chief in the country?s interest. 

 Mulayam Singh, sitting next to Vajpayee at the inauguration of a modern convention centre here, smiled. But the comment must have reminded him of the trying time he had before the general elections when the former Prime Minister first hinted at a BJP-Samajwadi Party link. 

 Barely 10 days before the elections, he had declared that Mulayam Singh?s party is ?ideologically? closer to his NDA. 

 Mulayam Singh has been talking about the need for a third force since a recent meeting with CPM veteran Harkishen Singh Surjeet. Only yesterday, he told reporters here that he was actively working to prop up a third front. 

 This evening, the paths of the two crossed at the new Scientific Convention Centre, a state-of-the-art hall with two auditoria. Vajpayee said unlike Bangalore and Hyderabad, Lucknow needed a proper hall to host international seminars. The centre is his gift to his constituency. 

 Also present were Vice-President Bhairon Singh Shekhawat and Samajwadi Party general secretary Amar Singh. 

 While appreciating the state government?s cooperation in speeding up construction of the centre, Vajpayee said: ?The least I speak about Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav, the better.? The throwback to their pre-poll strife triggered a roll of laughter in the hall. 

 Claiming that people were yearning for a change for the sake of development, he said: ?The general speculation is that we have closed ranks and have become politically aligned. We are not, but if that (alignment) happens in future, it will be in the broader interest of the country.? 

 The former Prime Minister launched into a praise of the chief minister. 

 ?The frequent trips he makes around the vast state, addressing rallies and meeting people of the districts, is an example. He is fulfilling the administrative responsibilities of being the chief minister of the state.? 

 The comments clouded the faces of several BJP leaders in the hall, like Rajnath Singh, Kesrinath Tripathi, Kalraj Mishra and Lalji Tandon, who have recently launched an anti-Mulayam Singh movement. Many felt Vajpayee was trying to send a message to the leaders who had failed to connect to their constituencies, resulting in the BJP?s dismal showing in the polls. 

 In their speeches, Mulayam Singh and Shekhawat stressed on development that would benefit the poor. ?The scientists and medical researchers attending this centre in seminars should send down a message to the poor that they were attempting a solution to their key problems,? Shekhawat said. 

 One problem was on top of Vajpayee?s mind. He cut short his ramblings for fear of fog, playing havoc with flight and train schedules. 

 ?Aur zyada bolenge nahi. Hum ko bola gaya, aur zyada bolu to kohra ajayegi (I have been warned against speaking long or the fog will come in),? said Vajpayee, who was to fly back to Delhi tonight.

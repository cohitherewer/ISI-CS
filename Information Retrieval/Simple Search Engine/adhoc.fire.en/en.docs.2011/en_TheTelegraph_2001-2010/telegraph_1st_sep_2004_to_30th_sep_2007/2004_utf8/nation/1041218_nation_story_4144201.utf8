 CPI blow

 New Delhi, Dec. 17: CPI MP Gurudas Dasgupta?s claim that the Prime Minister had assured him of increasing the provident fund interest rate to 9.5 per cent boomeranged today, reports our special correspondent.

 While the CPM distanced itself from the CPI, the BJP used the claim as a stick to beat the government with. The government stuck to its position that it had not given any categorical assurance to Dasgupta.

 CPM politburo member M.K. Pandhe called Dasgupta ?an unguided missile? while party MP Nilotpal Basu said: ?It was not a Left delegation which met the Prime Minister yesterday but a delegation led by Gurudas Dasgupta.?

 Soon after Dasgupta?s statement, the Prime Minister?s Office clarified that Singh had said the government would favourably look into the matter.

 It appears Dasgupta was trying to use his meeting with the Prime minister as a pressure tactic on the government to give in to the Left?s demand.

 Union labour minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao also said in the Lok Sabha today that the Prime Minister had not given any assurance to Dasgupta on increasing the provident fund rate. He, however, assured that as labour minister, he would try to persuade the government to increase the interest rate.

 In the Lok Sabha, BJP deputy leader Vijay Kumar Malhotra said: ?It is an important issue. And the Prime minister should not have spoken outside since Parliament is in session.? The government should inform the House whether it was proposing to increase the interest rate, he added. Union minister Pranab Mukherjee replied that the government would communicate its decision when it would be taken.

 Dasgupta, who was present in the House, wanted to put across his point of view but was not allowed.

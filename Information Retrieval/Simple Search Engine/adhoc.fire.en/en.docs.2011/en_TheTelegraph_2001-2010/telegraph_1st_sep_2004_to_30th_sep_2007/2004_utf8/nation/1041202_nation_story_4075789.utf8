 Prison boss runs into Pappu durbar

 ASHISH SINHA

 Pappu: Free run

 Patna, Dec. 1: Controversial Madhepura MP Pappu Yadav was again caught in the act at Beur Central Jail today.

 The jailed RJD leader was the star attraction at an impromptu, though totally illegal, durbar of over 50 visitors who had come to meet him at the prison around noon. The timing coincided with the visit of inspector-general (prisons) Deepak Kumar Singh to the jail in connection with a function to mark World AIDS Day.

 The officer was shocked to see so many visitors whose presence not only violated the letter and spirit of the jail manual but also posed a risk to the high-profile prison, home to some dreaded criminals.

 Not just that, when Singh tried to make queries, the jail officials, including superintendent P.K. Jha, left him alone to argue with Pappu Yadav, who, sources said, made free use of his mobile phone to ring up the highest echelons of power.

 ?The entries in the register were not proper. Besides, the jail manual does not permit the entry of so many visitors to meet any one prisoner. These are gross irregularities. I have recommended the suspension of the jail superintendent and reported the matter to the home department,? IG Singh told The Telegraph.

 Pappu Yadav had attracted the ire of Patna High Court after he arranged a ?party? at the jail soon after he was released on bail, granted earlier by the same court. The Supreme Court subsequently cancelled his bail and the parliamentarian, an accused in the murder of CPM leader Ajit Sarkar, returned to jail.

 Superintendent Jha was recently transferred to the Sasaram jail but he is yet to relinquish charge, apparently because his successor has not reported for joining. Jail minister Raghvendra Pratap Singh said Jha, prima facie found guilty of ?gross irregularities?, has been suspended.

 The more interesting part of the day?s drama was the phone calls made by Pappu after he was caught in the act. Sources said the jail minister received the information ?very soon? and he reportedly asked the IG (prisons) to return back. ?A phone call was made to the city?s most important address from where the information was passed on to further quarters,? a source said.

 But the IG denied having received any instructions from the minister. ?I have taken all action that was necessary. The AIDS Day programme was held as per schedule,? Singh said.

 The programme that the senior police officer attended was scheduled from before. ?Yet the jail superintendent and other subordinate officials openly violated all norms that guide the running of prisons. It is clear that there is no control or decorum at the jail. Even the judiciary?s intervention has failed to make any difference,? sources said.

 ?Mobile phone jammers are yet to be installed in the jails of Bihar despite court orders. Jail officials do not dare to displease mighty politicians like Pappu Yadav even at the risk of violating all rules,? the sources added.

 Today?s incident has come soon after the superintendent of Bhagalpur jail was accused of helping dreaded criminal Bindu Singh, believed to be the mastermind in the murder of Patna doctor N.K. Agrawal.

 A jail official said all boundaries of the Beur jail have blurred after RJD president Laloo Prasad Yadav was lodged there for a brief while.

 Chappal charge at CM

 B.R. SRIKANTH

 Bangalore, Nov. 25: A protest by 5,000 members of the Kannada film industry led by Rajkumar almost went out of hand today when some of the agitators hurled chappals at Karnataka chief minister Dharam Singh, who was standing on a van.

 The film industry had organised the sit-in to highlight a slew of demands, including mandatory screening of Kannada movies in all theatres.

 It also called for enhancing the entertainment tax on non-Kannada movies from 40 per cent to 100 per cent and sought the levy of an entry tax of Rs 50 lakh on these films.

 The protesters had planned to hold the sit-in at one entrance to the Vidhan Soudha complex, which houses the Assembly and the state secretariat. However, the agitators were stopped by police and held the demonstration at a traffic island, a stone?s throw from the complex.

 Singh, who has earlier held talks with film industry representatives inside Vidhan Soudha, came out of the complex with several senior cabinet colleagues. The chief minister stood on a van waiting to address the gathering after Rajkumar finished speaking.

 Soon some enraged fans of Rajkumar, who have been demanding a complete ban on non-Kannada films, hurled chappals at the chief minister who was meeting them in the open for the first time since their agitation began. The situation was quickly brought under control.

 Rajkumar asserted the industry is united, though six exhibitors have shown Yash Chopra?s Veer-Zaara in Bangalore, flouting a call for a three-week delay in the release of non-Kannada films.

 ?I am ready for any sacrifice for the cause of Kannada film industry. We are not against other languages, but our language should survive. Through this protest, we have shown that we are all united (in the industry),? he said.

 Other actors said they were fighting for justice and the government should intervene at this juncture.

 Later, Singh said he would discuss the demands of the Kannada film industry with the cabinet. ?The government is committed to protecting the interest of the Kannada film industry and language. The government is very firm on protecting public property and maintain law and order.?

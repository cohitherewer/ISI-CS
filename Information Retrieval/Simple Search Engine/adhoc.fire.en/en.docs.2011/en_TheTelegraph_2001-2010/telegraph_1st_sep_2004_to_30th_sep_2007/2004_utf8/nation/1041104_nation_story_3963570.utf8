 Cong reloads riot gun

 K. SUBRAHMANYA

 New Delhi, Nov. 3: The Congress has demanded that the Centre should draw the attention of the two panels probing the Godhra train burnings and the riots that followed to former Gujarat governor S.S. Bhandari?s observations against the Narendra Modi government.

 ?Bhandari has clearly stated that if the Modi government had used the state machinery properly, the post-Godhra incidents involving loss of life, limb and property could have been averted. Though late, the former governor?s observations are significant as (he) has been a constitutional eyewitness at that time,? Congress spokesman Abhishek Singhvi said.

 As Bhandari also happened to be a ?senior insider? of the BJP who had full knowledge of the Modi-led government?s functioning, his account was significant and it ought to be taken note of by the Centre, Singhvi added.

 The former governor?s comments should form the basis of further investigations by the Justice U.C. Banerjee Committee and the Nanavati commission that are looking into the Godhra and post-Godhra incidents, he said.

 Singhvi said Bhandari?s ?evidence? was yet another vindication of his party?s stand that the Modi government had a hand in the 2002 communal flare-up. 

 The Manmohan Singh government, he added, should take note of recent threats by Sangh parivar affiliates that such incidents could be repeated if their Hindutva agenda is ignored. 

 The spokesman also welcomed the move to reactivate the Babri Masjid demolition case against BJP chief .K. Advani and several others. ?The long arm of the law is catching up? with the leaders with ?potentiality for conviction?, he said.

 The Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court yesterday admitted a CBI plea and issued notices to Advani, BJP leaders M.M. Joshi, Uma Bharti, Kalyan Singh and Vinay Katiyar, and 14 others, including Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray and VHP leader Ashok Singhal.

 The revival of the case has come at a time when the BJP leadership under Advani has stated its resolve to press ahead with its agitation against ?tainted? ministers in the United Progressive Alliance government.

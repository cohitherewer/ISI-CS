 Bypoll boost to Cong

 KAY BENEDICT

 New Delhi, Oct. 16: Not just Maharashtra, the Congress today bucked anti-incumbency across the country, registering victories in several by-elections as the rival BJP suffered jolt after jolt.

 Of the 37 Assembly seats spread across 13 states where elections were held, the Congress won 13. The BJP and the Samajwadi Party managed seven each while the Bahujan Samaj Party bagged two. The CPM won three seats and others five.

 The Congress wrested Bidar Lok Sabha seat in Karnataka from the BJP, taking its individual tally to 146 in the lower House. Pappu Yadav of the Rashtriya Janata Dal, a Congress ally, won the Madhepura parliamentary seat.

 In the Assembly by-elections, the Congress recorded wins in BJP strongholds Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh. In Gujarat, it won three seats while the BJP held on to one and wrested another.

 In Madhya Pradesh, the Congress snatched the Balaghat seat from the BJP, which managed to retain Nohta. The BJP?s Balaghat defeat is considered a jolt as it comes barely 10 months after the party swept to power in the state.

 The BJP?s only consolation was it won one seat each in Goa and Himachal Pradesh. But the BJP candidate Isidor Fernandes who contested from Goa is a former Congress leader.

 In Jammu and Kashmir, the People?s Democratic Party chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed won Pahalgam, managing to get elected to the Assembly from the Valley after 17 years. Ally Congress won Akhnoor and Basohli seats in Jammu region.

 However, the Congress drew a blank in Bengal and Uttar Pradesh. While the CPM won all three seats in Bengal, the Samajwadi Party won seven of the 11 seats in Uttar Pradesh, while its ally Rashtriya Lok Dal won one seat. The Congress won none.

 The BJP wrested Atrauli from the Samajwadi Party with Premlata, former chief minister Kalyan Singh?s daughter-in-law, registering a win.

 In the Northeast, the Congress won four Assembly seats, retaining two in Nagaland and one in Manipur, and wresting one in Assam. But it lost one seat in Nagaland.

 In Andhra Pradesh, the Telugu Desam remained out of luck with the Telengana Rashtra Samiti retaining Siddipet. 

 The Congress, too, received a setback with the stunning defeat of chief minister Rajasekhar Reddy?s nominee, D. Nagender, from Asifnagar. The Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen won Hyderabad.

 In Punjab, Congress candidate Sukhjinder Kaur won the Kapurthala seat, defeating her Shiromani Akali Dal (Badal) rival and former transport minister Raghubir Singh.

 In Rajasthan, the Congress and the BJP won a seat each. While the BJP snatched Behrod from the Congress, the latter wrested Merta.

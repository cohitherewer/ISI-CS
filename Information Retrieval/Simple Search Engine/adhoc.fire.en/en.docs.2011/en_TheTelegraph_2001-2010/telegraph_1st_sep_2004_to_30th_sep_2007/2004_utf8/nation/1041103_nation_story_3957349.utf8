 Andhra farmers for Kenya

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Hyderabad, Nov. 2: Drought, debts, crop failures and depression are driving Andhra Pradesh farmers to suicide. In a few months, many of them could be driving to the airport, to fly to the Dark Continent and a bright future. 

 A project to outsource farmers to the fertile tracts of East Africa initiated by the Congress government two months ago is likely to bear fruit soon, enabling the cultivators to make a living off the fertile lands of Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania. 

 The Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy government has agreed in principle to take land on lease for 99 years and sub-let it to farmers? co-operatives, which would send cultivators willing to migrate to Africa. 

 A draft copy of a memorandum of understanding to be inked by the leaders of Andhra and Kenya is ready. 

 A team from the state, led by C. Chandrasekhar Reddy, adviser on foreign investments and human resources outsourcing, is now in Nairobi.

 The Kenyan high commissioner to India, Mutuma Kathurima, was here recently to discuss with the chief minister the prospects of outsourcing farmers to put land in his country to better use. 

 ?Only 5 per cent of the land there is cultivated,? he said. 

 ?It will take a minimum of four to five months before the first batch of farmers and experts board flights for their new destinations in East Africa,? said a spokesman for the team.

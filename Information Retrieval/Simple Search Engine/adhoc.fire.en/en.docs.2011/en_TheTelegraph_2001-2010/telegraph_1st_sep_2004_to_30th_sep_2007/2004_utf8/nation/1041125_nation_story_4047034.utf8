New Delhi, Nov. 24: Rarely are Left parties rewarded with such prompt response from the government to their demands.

 At a meeting with top Congress leaders this morning, Left parties insisted on a reduction of prices of petroleum products. By evening, the government had rolled back its decision to increase the price of cooking gas by Rs 5 every month.

 But the Left is still not satisfied. ?The government has considered our demand. But it would have been better had they reduced diesel price also. The government would have to consider that,? said CPI leader D. Raja who was present at the meeting.

 The Left had reacted similarly to an earlier government decision to partially roll back petrol prices following a reduction in international prices of petroleum products. CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury had said the reduction was ?inadequate?.

 Reduction in petroleum prices topped the Left?s list of demands at today?s meeting. The Left parties, which have been protesting against the hike in petroleum prices since international prices began shooting up, suggested restructuring of customs and excise duties to avoid a price increase.

 The decision to roll back LPG prices came as a sort of concession to the Left. Moreover, with Assembly elections in Bihar, Jharkhand and Haryana due in February, the government does not want to be seen as pushing up prices of commodities that affect a large section of the population. At the meeting, the Left leaders also told the government to push through as many positive, pro-poor policies that it can before the Election Commission?s code of conduct comes into effect.

 So far the government has dragged its feet over most of the Left?s economic demands. The Left expects the government to give up its move to raise the ceiling on foreign direct investment in telecom and insurance. It wants the government to restore the employees provident fund interest rate to 9.5 per cent, to review the Electricity Act that calls for privatisation of the sector and to set up a board that would look into the issue of restructuring sick public sector undertakings.

 Finance minister P. Chidambaram, at a UPA-Left meeting two months ago, had assured the Left that the government was ?actively considering? restoring the PF interest rate to 9.5 per cent. He had also said the cabinet would soon announce a new restructuring board for PSUs. This morning, the Left again demanded restoration of PF interest rate.

 The Left has also submitted a note in response to Chidambaram?s note explaining the government?s stand on FDI in telecom. The government has not yet given a reply.

 Sheila daughter in spot

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 23: Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit?s daughter Latika has been booked under several sections, including a non-bailable one, after a city court directed police to register a case against her following a complaint of assault on a lawyer.

 Advocate Akshaya Kumar Sharma accused Latika and some others of threatening and assaulting him after an argument over reversing his car.

 According to Sharma, the incident happened on the evening of August 25 when he was returning from his office in the Patiala House Courts. He said a blue Opel with a home ministry sticker suddenly appeared in front of his vehicle near the chief minister?s residence, which is close to the Patiala House Courts.

 Sharma claimed the Opel was being driven by Latika, who asked him to reverse his car, which he could not do as the traffic behind him was heavy. Sharma?s complaint said Latika stepped out and threatened him to turn back. When he did not listen, she called out a man seated inside the car. This person caught hold of his collar, Sharma alleged.

 Later, some more men, allegedly policemen in plainclothes, joined them and started shouting at him, Sharma said.

 Latika has denied the allegations. ?I will answer the charges one by one when the investigating officer approaches me. I did not block his way. I was not on the wrong side and he was the one who gesticulated at me,? she said.

 ?The charges of having a muscleman in the car with me are also wrong. There was only my three-year-old child, maid and cook in the car.?

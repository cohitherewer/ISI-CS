 Cong sop for Telengana

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi/Hyderabad, Nov. 2: The Congress is working on a financial package for the backward Telengana region along the lines of the one worked out for Bihar when Jharkhand was carved from it.

 Its reluctance to grant Telengana statehood has widened a rift with the Telengana Rashtra Samiti, the Congress? ally in the Assembly and Lok Sabha elections. 

 M. Satyanarayana Reddy, the deputy leader of the TRS in the Andhra Assembly, said today all its six state ministers might quit soon in protest against the ?Congress? reluctance to fulfil its pre-poll promises?.

 TRS chief and Union minister without portfolio K. Chandrasekhar Rao has threatened to quit the United Progressive Alliance if statehood is not granted.

 Amid the uproar, National Advisory Council convener Jairam Ramesh has started working on a package for Telengana at Congress chief Sonia Gandhi?s instance. 

 The council will ratify the proposals which will then be placed before the UPA-Left co-ordination committee.

 The Congress has iterated that a second state reorganisation committee should examine all statehood demands, including the call for a separate Vidarbha.

 To blunt the campaign for a separate Telengana, the Congress last week made K. Kesava Rao the Andhra Pradesh unit chief. Kesava Rao, who hails from the region, had helped clinch the electoral alliance with the TRS. 

 Chief minister Y.S. Rajashekhara Reddy had separate talks with Sonia today. Reddy said his government felt the statehood issue ought to be resolved through consensus or a state reorganisation panel.

 But the Samiti chief is not sitting idle. He had earlier demanded that a bill for creating a Telengana state be introduced in Parliament?s winter session beginning December 1. 

 With the Congress providing no assurance, Rao has extended the deadline till March 2005 when Andhra is slated to hold municipal elections.

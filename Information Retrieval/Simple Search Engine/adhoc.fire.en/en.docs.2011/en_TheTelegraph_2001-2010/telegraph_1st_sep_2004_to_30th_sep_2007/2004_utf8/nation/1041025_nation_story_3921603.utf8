 Singh resents restraints on nuclear energy

 Chennai, Oct. 24: Manmohan Singh has said he resents ?artificial restrictions? on the country?s ?genuine peaceful nuclear applications? by the advanced nuclear powers.

 Denying technology and closing avenues for international cooperation over the peaceful uses of nuclear power ?is tantamount to denial of developmental benefits to millions of people?, the Prime Minister said yesterday at Kalpakkam, about 55 km from here.

 He was addressing the golden jubilee commemoration function of the department of atomic energy at the Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research (IGCAR).

 Life in developing countries, Singh said, could be transformed by the peaceful use of nuclear energy and relevant technologies.

 So the ?limitations of the present non-proliferation regime should not be further accentuated by artificial restrictions?, he said in an apparent reference to sanctions on India by some developed countries.

 US concerns about Delhi?s nuclear record and ties with Tehran continue to create diplomatic sparks though Washington last month removed decades-old restrictions on equipment for India?s commercial space programme and nuclear power plants.

 The US slapped sanctions last month on Y.S.R. Prasad and C. Surendar, former chiefs of the Nuclear Power Corporation of India, for allegedly selling weapons or cruise and ballistic missile technology and equipment to Iran. Tehran is part of the US? ?axis of evil?.

 Singh, whose government had rejected the charges against the scientists and demanded withdrawal of the sanctions, assured that India would not be the ?source of proliferation of sensitive technologies?.

 ?We are determined to utilise our indigenous resources and capabilities to fulfil our national interests in a manner that is not contrary to the larger goals of nuclear non-proliferation,? he said.

 ?We will also ensure the safeguarding of those technologies that we already possess,? he added.

 India, the Prime Minister asserted, would ?remain faithful to this approach as we have been for the last several decades? despite ?well-known and glaring examples of proliferation, which have directly affected our security interests?.

 Iterating that India ?is a responsible nuclear power? and fully conscious of the ?immense responsibilities? that come with it, Singh took a dig at the advanced nuclear powers.

 ?Constraining? those who are responsible players ?amounts in effect to rewarding those who are irresponsible?, he said.

 The international community must face the implications of this choice, Singh said and added that India was ready to shoulder ?our share of international obligations provided our legitimate interests are met?.

 The Prime Minister appealed to the advanced powers and all those with a stake in the future of nuclear energy ?to come together for a constructive dialogue to evolve more effective measures that would stem the tide of proliferation without unduly constraining the peaceful uses of nuclear energy?.

 When India has actively ?embraced globalisation?, there is no reason why nuclear energy production should be an exception, Singh argued.

 Cost-effective and clean nuclear energy ? which now accounts for only 2 per cent of India?s installed power capacity ? is required to ensure the country?s energy security, he said.

 It ?can also be a much needed cushion against fluctuations in oil prices?, he added.

 During the day, Singh launched the construction of the 500-mw ?prototype fast breeder reactor? project at Kalpakkam worth Rs 3,492 crore. It signified the beginning of the commercial phase of the ?fast breeder reactor? programme.

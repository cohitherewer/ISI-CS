 DD cricket sales roll

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 4: Government broadcaster Doordarshan has pipped Sony to win the rights to telecast cricket matches in India for the ensuing season, even after the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) had announced that it was going with the private channel.

 ?The board had always made it clear that even if the issue of cricket rights had moved to the Supreme Court, the cricket matches for this season were going to be telecast by us,? Prasar Bharati chief executive officer K.S. Sarma said here today.

 ?Suddenly, we found that towards the end of last week they said they were going with Sony. We threatened to go to court but now we have sorted it out. We have bought the rights for Rs 100 crore, and cricket matches of the ensuing India-Australia series and for the rest of the season will be telecast by us,? he said.

 Zee sources said they would await the outcome of a hearing in the Supreme Court tomorrow to give their response to the BCCI-DD deal.

 Sarma said the BCCI has given Prasar Bharati both terrestrial and satellite rights for all the Tests and one-dayers. ?Even before the agreement was signed (last evening), we had started marketing airtime. I expect by now, we have already sold 90 per cent of commercial time,? Sarma said.

 The rights cover the matches in the India-Australia series, the series against South Africa and an ODI against Pakistan.

 Sarma said he had spoken to BCCI officials led by Jagmohan Dalmiya and ?reminded? them of their commitment. It is understood that Prasar Bharati officials had also been in touch with Sony TV top brass.

 ?We made it clear that if the rights were given to us, they do not need to deal with any other broadcaster because of our reach,? Sarma said. 

 Doordarshan will pay the BCCI Rs 3 crore per day for the Test matches and Rs 7 crore per day for the ODIs.

 Sarma said Prasar Bharati has engaged former additional solicitor-general Vaidyanathan to represent it in the Supreme Court when the case challenging the award of long-term rights by the BCCI to Zee comes up for hearing. Prasar Bharati was the third highest bidder for the rights after Zee and ESPN-STAR Sports. Sarma said Prasar Bharati will attend the proceedings and present its case if required.

 The BCCI had cancelled the tender process despite Zee topping with its bid after ESPN-STAR Sports had challenged the award of rights from 2004-2008. Since the issue moved to the courts, the board was under pressure to work out an interim arrangement. Cricket Australia had threatened to walk out of the series if the telecast of matches was not decided by the time the series got to a start.

 Zee DTH signals

 Prasar Bharati on Monday decided to block signals of India?s Test series against Australia and South Africa and the ODI against Pakistan on Zee?s DTH arm, Dish TV.

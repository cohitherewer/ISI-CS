 Inflation bill on cable TV 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 1: Cable television tariffs are likely to go up by around 5 per cent after December 26 this year, the government-appointed regulator asked to look into proposals to reshape the cable TV market said here today.

 But the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) has lobbed the hot potato of an issue ? reshaping the cable television subscription market ? back to the government. It has made a series of recommendations that translate to just one advice: no change as of now.

 Trai officials said that tariffs could go up to adjust for inflation and if its recommendation on a new pricing mechanism was notified. Till such time, however, the cable channel rates should remain frozen at the level they were on December 26 last year.

 Trai was asked to study proposals to restructure broadcasting and cable television distribution after the Centre?s futile attempts last year to introduce a set-top box regime that could separate free-to-air and pay channels under a conditional access system (CAS).

 The regulator has pointed out that cable television connections in the country outnumbered fixed phone connections. The industry, which has grown to massive proportions, was never regulated and any measure to restructure it needs to ?evolve? and cannot be implemented overnight. Trai chairman Pradip Baijal said allowances have to be made for variations and a uniform system across the country may not be feasible.

 It has come out with a new pricing mechanism for cable channels with the rider that prices need not necessarily be the same everywhere. Fixing the prices of channels based on costs was complicated and can be easier to arrive at with the introduction of an addressable system ? a set-top box regime that can segregate pay and free-to-air channels.

 The regulator suggested that pay channel tariffs prevailing on December 26 last year should be taken as the ceiling. Tariffs for new pay channels should be within that ceiling.

 In a lengthy set of recommendations made to the government Trai said:

 Cable channel tariffs should 

 continue to be what they are till the end of the year

 Options on cable signal 

 delivery systems that include mandatory CAS should be explored

 State governments and local 

 stakeholders should be consulted before an addressable system 

 like CAS or Direct to Home (DTH) is introduced

 The regulator said it was in favour of maintaining the basic tier price for channels suggested by the government under CAS ? Rs 72 per month for a minimum of 30 free-to-air channels. New rates may be fixed after a decision on an addressable system.

 What this means for the cable television viewer is that he/she will continue with the current regime in the market for better or for worse.

 ?The ceiling shall be reviewed from time to time to make adjustments for inflation,? Baijal said. 

 Baijal said that tariffs may be revised after December 26 this year. Before fixing prices, Trai has asked broadcasters to give information on the charges. 

 ?We will intervene after reviewing the information if necessary,? he said.

 The regulator suggested that the government may examine three models for cable channels.

 ?Model-i provides for the existing system with all new pay channels after a notified date (designated as premium channels) to come via a set-top box, model-ii provides for the use of traps as well as the condition that all new pay channels after a notified date will come via a set-top box (as in model i) while model-iii is based on the presumption that addressability through CAS is introduced by a legislative mandate,? Trai said in its recommendations.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 BJP duo at each other?s neck

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Nov. 7: The tussle among the BJP?s GeNext leaders continued with senior leader Shahnawaz Hussain sniping at vice-president Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi for his remarks against Uma Bharti. 

 ?Naqvi is not spokesperson for the party. Whatever he has said is his personal view,? Hussain told reporters here. ?Senior leaders should avoid using harsh words against party colleagues.? 

 On Friday, Naqvi, who belongs to the M. Venkaiah Naidu camp, had criticised Uma?s utterances against general secretary Pramod Mahajan and dubbed it ?indiscipline?. 

 Uma had referred to Mahajan as a ?power broker? and took credit for the party?s victory in Madhya Pradesh last year. 

 Hussain said he did not believe Uma had criticised Mahajan and argued ?she is a leader of the state (Madhya Pradesh) and her role in the election was very important?. 

 In another development, RSS chief K. Sudarshan today tried to assuage the feelings of minorities, saying that ?the other sections of the society? had nothing to fear from the Sangh ?if they do not suffer from guilt?. 

 ?Any society has to be strong and organised to preserve its identity. The weak have no place in this world. Nobody respects them,? Sudarshan said, addressing hundreds of RSS workers at the conclusion of the Sangh?s two-day national executive in Hardwar.

 Without naming any community, he said ?it will be ridiculous to think that I do daily exercise to beat my neighbours and not to keep myself healthy and disease-free?.

 Quoting RSS founder K.B. Hedgewar, Sudarshan said ?neither will we frighten nor will we get frightened? and added that ?if there is no fear, there is no love. Without social strength, nobody will listen to you?.

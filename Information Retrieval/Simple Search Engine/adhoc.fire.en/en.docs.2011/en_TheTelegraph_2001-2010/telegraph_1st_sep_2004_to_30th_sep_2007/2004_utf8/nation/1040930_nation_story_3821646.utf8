 UN?s hip, labour meet worth a skip

 PRANAY SHARMA

 New Delhi, Sept. 29: The Centre did not spare any efforts to send delegates to the UN General Assembly last week but skipped a key labour welfare meet in Manila. 

 The three-day Asian Labour Migration Ministerial Consultations, which labour officials from several nations attended, ended on Friday without any Indian representation.

 Officials here said a delegation was not sent due to lack of funds. However, according to some estimates, it would have cost the government less than $10,000 to send a delegation even if the team included the labour minister and other senior officials.

 India is one of the 10 countries in Asia from where workers migrate in large numbers to other parts of the world. 

 There are more than five million Indian migrant workers in different parts of the world who remit $19 billion every year. More than four million Indian workers are in the Gulf and send back nearly $15 billion annually.

 The decision not to send a team for the second Asian Labour Migration Ministerial Consultations in Manila came at a time when 67 migrant Indian workers are reportedly stranded at the border of Mauritania in west Africa.

 South Block said attempts were being made to bring home the Indians, who were being given shelter in camps by the International Organisation on Migration, which organised the Manila conference with funding from the UK?s department for international development and the Asian Development Bank.

 A series of ?best practice? studies on labour migration launched by the migration organisation ? one of the main world bodies working on the issue ? were presented at the meet that began on September 22.

 The meeting aimed at strengthening cooperation between labour-sending and -receiving countries, according to the organisers. It is part of the capacity-building project for the protection of vulnerable labour migrants in Asia.

 The stress at the meeting was on implementing the proposals from the first meeting in Colombo, which India had attended. 

 The Colombo meet had focused on the protection of migrants and services to them, optimisation of benefits of organised labour migration and interstate cooperation for the welfare of migrant workers.

 One of the major developments from the Colombo meet was the proposal to set up migrant advocacy and welfare centres in labour-receiving countries. There was also a proposal for setting up a joint migrant resource centre in one of the Gulf countries. 

 The consultations with different countries would help forge alliances and strengthen collective bargaining on issues affecting migrant workers, said the organisers. These alliances, they said, could come either through bilateral or regional arrangements or agreements with labour-receiving nations.

 Andhra adds rural rider to Naxalite talks

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Ramakrishana: Peace poser

 Hyderabad, Dec. 7: The Andhra Pradesh government has hardened its stand on talks with Naxalites, casting doubts over the scope of the second round of the peace dialogue.

 Home minister K. Jana Reddy yesterday said the situation in rural Andhra is not ?conducive for continuing the peace dialogue?. He said the Naxalites have been terrorising people with weapons and extorting donations for martyrs? meetings and construction of memorials.

 ?In this atmosphere, it is difficult to begin the second round of talks without attending to our democratic duties of attending to citizens? woes,? Reddy said.

 The minister said the rebels? representatives had been told of the government?s reservations. ?They have agreed to make a fresh appeal to (the) Maoists to restrain themselves,? he said.

 The police cannot ignore their duties because talks are being held with the rebels. ?Police have to maintain law and order in spite of negotiating with the ultras,? Reddy said.

 The minister said Naxalite skirmishes over the last month at Kadapa, Karimnagar and Mahboobnagar had been referred to a monitoring committee set up to probe incidents that occur during the course of the peace talks.

 The government first held talks with the rebels in October. Five prominent leaders of the People?s War, including committee secretary Ramakrishana alias A. Hargopal, and the Janashakti faction emerged from their hideouts in the Srisailam forest to participate in the talks here under police escort. The same team is likely to represent them if the second round of talks takes place.

 The talks were expected to begin last month but did not take place for a number of reasons. Among them was the Naxalites? attempt to distribute government and private land among the landless on their own.

 However, the rebel action made the Congress-led state government draw up an ambitious plan to distribute land to the landless on Republic Day next year. On January 26, 1.14 lakh acres will be distributed to the landless and rural poor under the Indira Prabha scheme, named after the former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. Each farmer will get two acres of wet land or five acres of dry land.

 The friction between the police and the Naxalites has been on the rise since last fortnight after the former unearthed landmines the rebels had planted in Warangal and Medak districts. The discoveries have revealed that the Naxalites are trying to regroup and strengthen their network.

 MF paints a surprise

 Ahmedabad, Dec. 25 (PTI): Painter M.F. Husain today made a sudden visit to the city and gifted a painting to a restaurant in the Lal Darwaza area of the walled city.

The bare-foot painter made his ?routine? visit to 

Lucky restaurant ? famous for its tea and snacks ? and gifted the painting in 

a show of ?affection? for the shop, especially for the tea served there.

 ?I come here each time to have chai whenever I visit the city for any occasion. I have been promising them one of my paintings. I completed it yesterday and installed it here as a symbol of my affection,? Husain told reporters.

 The unnamed painting has his trademark brushstrokes and is on the desert theme with a ?kalma? written across.

 ?Husain has been a regular visitor at the tea stall for nearly 25 years now. He said he wanted to give us a painting and what can be a better honour for us. This painting is priceless,? Gulabbhai, the owner of Lucky, said.

 Husain, also a controversial filmmaker, has made another contribution to the city, which is the Hussain-Doshi gufa (cave). It was made in collaboration with city-based architect Balakrishna Doshi.

 Jaya tax leg-up for film wallahs

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Chennai, Sept. 27: Jayalalithaa today slashed entertainment tax on screening of movies in Tamil Nadu and stiffened penalties to curb video piracy under a major package to boost the sagging film industry.

 The chief minister cut the tax applicable in municipal corporation areas, including Chennai, and special grade municipalities from 25 per cent of gross collections to 15 per cent for new films; the rate for old films has been halved to 10 per cent.

 These rates will also be applicable to permanent and semi-permanent theatres situated within a radius of 5 km from these local body areas. In other (rural) areas, the government has decided to do away with the ?compounding tax system and introduce a simple levy of 10 per cent on the gross payment?.

 Jayalalithaa said low-budget films with ?quality and good themes? will henceforth be totally exempt from entertainment tax. The package of concessions was announced today after representatives of the Tamil film industry met her a few days ago asking her to set matters right. She added: ?As I have myself been part of the film industry earlier, I am aware of all the issues confronting the film industry.?

 The cuts in entertainment tax will affect the incomes of various local bodies as 90 per cent of the tax receipts are given to them at present as tax devolution. But Jayalalithaa said a compensation package is being worked out to protect them from revenue loss.

 Cracking down on video piracy, the chief minister said unauthorised exhibition of films, including uncensored versions, will henceforth come under the ambit of the Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Bootleggers, Drug Offenders, Forest Offenders, Goondas, Immoral Traffic Offenders and Slum Grabbers Act, 1982.

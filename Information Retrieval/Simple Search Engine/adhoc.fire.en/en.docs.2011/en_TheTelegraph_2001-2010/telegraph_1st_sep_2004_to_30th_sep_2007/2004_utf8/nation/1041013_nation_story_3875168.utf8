 Fernandes: Combat mode

New Delhi, Oct. 12: George Fernandes is not giving up. 

 In a bid to involve Mulayam Singh Yadav in the formation of a third front, the NDA convener had offered to merge his seven-member Janata Dal (United) with the Samajwadi Party. But the Uttar Pradesh chief minister declined the offer ? at least for the time being. 

 Fernandes, who yesterday hosted a tea party to discuss ways of toppling the Congress-led government, has been trying his best to cobble together a third front by uniting all secular parties except Laloo Prasad Yadav?s RJD.

 Sources said he sold the idea of a Dal (U)-Samajwadi Party merger to lure Mulayam Singh, who nurses ambitions of becoming Prime Minister. The merger would have taken their combined strength to 45 MPs in the Lok Sabha. 

 In 1996, H.D. Deve Gowda, a leader of the undivided Janata Dal with 45 MPs, had become Prime Minister in the United Front government. But Mulayam Singh knows the time is not ripe yet, Dal (U) sources said.

 The chief minister and his lieutenant Amar Singh ? who are in touch with CPM leaders Harkishen Singh Surjeet and Sitaram Yechury ? know that without the Left?s support, a third front is not viable. 

 Fernandes? efforts to destabilise the Centre are also backed by Telugu Desam Party chief Chandrababu Naidu. Two weeks ago, the former Andhra Pradesh chief minister had sent an emissary to meet Yechury and discuss revival of the third front. But Yechury, Desam sources said, refused to meet the emissary. 

 Sources said Mulayam Singh wants to buy time as the Congress backs his government in Lucknow. He is also waiting for the results of 12 Assembly byelections and victory in two-thirds of these seats would help him discard the Congress crutch. 

 Much also depends on the Maharashtra polls. If the result is a hung House, Mulayam Singh, the sources said, might like to join a Congress-led government like the NCP. 

 Besides Fernandes? merger offer, there was also a proposal for an electoral tie-up between the Dal (U) and the Samajwadi Party in Bihar to take on the RJD in the February 2005 elections. The sources said a section in the Dal (U) had even suggested dumping the BJP to attract Muslim votes.

 Dal (U) leader Sharad Yadav held talks with Mulayam Singh recently on a tie-up in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. Lok Janshakti Party chief Ram Vilas Paswan also deliberated with Mulayam Singh for a possible electoral understanding in both states. Paswan and Mulayam Singh have common targets: both want to settle scores with Laloo Prasad in Bihar, while BSP chief Mayavati is their common enemy in Uttar Pradesh.

 BJP vows to block bill in Upper House

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 6: Unable to thwart the passage of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Amendment Bill, 2004 in the Lok Sabha, the BJP seems determined to hold it up in the Upper House.

 The bill, which is expected to become an act by tonight and will replace the Prevention of Terrorism Act, is to be sent to the Rajya Sabha for its assent this week.

 The BJP will demand that the bill be referred to the home ministry?s standing committee before it becomes law. 

 Sushma Swaraj, the party?s deputy leader in the Rajya Sabha, said: ?We are not totally opposed to any law which will fight terrorism but we are clear in our demand that it should be sent to the standing committee.?

 The BJP, which lacks the numbers to vote out a bill if there is a division of votes in the Upper House, reckons that it will make up for the shortfall on two counts: one, the UAPA bill will have to go to a parliamentary standing committee of the home ministry. This is one of the eight committees under the jurisdiction of the Upper House. The other 17 fall under the Lok Sabha?s jurisdiction. 

 Sushma heads the home ministry?s standing committee.

 The BJP is also happy that it is Rajya Sabha chairperson Bhairon Singh Shekhawat?s prerogative to send a bill to the committee; he is not bound to go by the will of the House. 

 He can thus overrule the Congress and the rest of the ruling United Progressive Alliance if they clamour for the bill?s passage.

 Sushma cited parliamentary precedents to buttress the BJP?s case. 

 She said home minister, Shivraj Patil ? an Upper House member ? was finicky about referring new bills to a standing committee when he was Speaker and deputy leader of the Congress in the Lok Sabha. ?He made the rules as the Speaker. His plea was even if there was a single-line amendment it should go to the standing committee. He felt passionately about it,? the BJP MP said.

 She added that there was no way the BJP would allow the bill to be passed ?just like that? for it had ?far-reaching implications? since it dealt with terrorism.

 Congress sources in the Rajya Sabha admitted the chairperson?s verdict is binding but said they would argue that a law against terrorism was the ?need of the hour? and ?things could not exist in a vacuum?. They said other parties supported their view.

 But the Samajwadi Party today backed the BJP?s demand that the bill be sent to a standing committee.

 Apart from this strategy to disconcert the treasury benches, the BJP is apparently reconciled to allow Parliament to run normally. It is ready to settle for a discussion under rule 193 on the price rise although it was earlier spoiling for a discussion under rule 184 which entails a division of votes.

 The party reckoned that the Left, which has raised a storm over inflation outside Parliament, might be put in a quandary. But once the Left made it clear it would not vote with the BJP on any issue the latter backed off.

 The BJP has also sought discussions on internal security, foreign policy, farmers? suicides and the UPA?s own contradictions, shown up during the Laloo Prasad Yadav-Ram Vilas Paswan spat as well as the demand for a separate Telengana state. The Left shot down the statehood demand made by the Telengana Rashtra Samiti.

 The Kanchi seer?s arrest has reportedly been removed from the BJP?s platter. A National Democratic Alliance meeting late tonight was to decide if it should press ahead with the ?tainted? ministers? issue and continue its ?boycott?.

 Sources said the government conceded discussions on price rise and foreign policy.

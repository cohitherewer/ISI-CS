 Arjun scanner on Joshi schools

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 25: Human resource development minister Arjun Singh has sought an inquiry into the illegal setting up of 97 kendriya vidyalayas during the tenure of his predecessor Murli Manohar Joshi.

 ?The schools were set up violating all norms and without any rationale. The HRD minister?s office directly issued orders bypassing the ministry ? violating procedures,? said a ministry official.

 Singh has urged that the matter be referred to the cabinet for scrutiny so that an appropriate decision can be taken with regard to the continuation of most of these schools and the allocation of resources for them. 

 The HRD ministry has, however, stressed that the careers of the students in these schools should not be jeopardised in any way.

 The setting up of kendriya vidyalayas usually involves plan allocations and budgetary provisions and needs the approval of appropriate authorities. These schools are located in areas with a concentration of government employees. There should be at least 200 schoolgoing children in that area.

 ?The schools require 15 acres of land and rent-free temporary accommodation for at least 50 per cent of employees? till they are in a position to construct their own buildings, said a HRD ministry note.

 The ministry stressed that Joshi violated all these guidelines. ?This resulted in schools being opened without proper facilities with an inadequate number of teachers and students ? much below the prescribed norm,? the ministry said. In some cases, there are only 10 to 15 students in each class.

 ?As a result of this, there has been a deterioration in the quality of academic work in these schools. Arbitrary deployment of staff depleted the teaching resources,? the ministry said. ?The random expansion without additional financial resources has also put a strain on the government?s finances.?

 Soon after taking charge, Singh issued a notice reversing the arbitrary transfer procedures practised during Joshi?s tenure. Singh has alleged that Joshi transferred kendriya vidyalaya staff according to his whims.

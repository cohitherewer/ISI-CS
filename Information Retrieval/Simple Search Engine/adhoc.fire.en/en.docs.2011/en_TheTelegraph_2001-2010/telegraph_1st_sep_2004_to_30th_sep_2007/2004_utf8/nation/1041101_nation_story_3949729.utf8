 Sangh prefers temple to BJP

 BASANT RAWAT

 Vadtal (Gujarat), Oct. 31: The Vishwa Hindu Parishad today threatened to snap ties with the BJP if forced to make a choice between the party and Ram temple.

 ?We can dump the BJP but we cannot give up the temple issue,? VHP president Ashok Singhal told about 700 full-time workers gathered here in central Gujarat for a nine-day national convention.

 He criticised the BJP for its ?political opportunism? and inconsistency on the Hindutva plank.

 Singhal dubbed the party?s attempt to resolve the Ayodhya dispute through court or dialogue an exercise in futility. ?Muslims do not believe in dialogue or negotiation. They only understand the language of force,? he said.

 ?Samjhaute se mandir nahin ban sakta hai. Muslim samaj ne kabhi samjhauta nahi kiya hai. Ham bhi nahi karenge, mandir ke mamle me (The temple cannot be built by negotiations. The Muslim community does not believe in negotiations; neither will we in the matter of the Ram temple),? the VHP chief said.

 He iterated that the Ram Janmabhoomi, Kashi and Mathura temple issues were ?equally important to us? and non-negotiable.

 Top BJP leaders, he said, were out to appease the minority community to get votes and had ?wanted us not to rake up the Mathura and Kashi issue, if they supported us on the Ram temple?.

 ?But we have told them that we can leave you, but not Mathura and Kashi.?

 Singhal urged all political parties to help enact a law to hand disputed sites in Ayodhya, Mathura and Kashi to Hindus or face political consequences.

 He took the opportunity to praise Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel ? today being his 130th birth anniversary ? but pilloried Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru for all the country?s ills because of their ?pro-Muslim? stand.

 Singhal also hit out at Pakistan, saying the ?very existence of that country was a threat to India?s peace?. 

 ?There cannot be permanent peace in India unless Pakistan is dismantled and completely pulverised,? he said.

 Praveen Togadia, the VHP international general secretary, exhorted the outfit?s youth wing to prepare for a prolonged ?dharma yudh (religious war)? against jihadi elements to establish a ?Hindu rashtra?.

 ?We need our youths to demonstrate their power as they did on February 28, 2002,? he said, calling for ?fighters? to prevent Godhra-like incidents. The Godhra train carnage that month had exploded into communal riots.

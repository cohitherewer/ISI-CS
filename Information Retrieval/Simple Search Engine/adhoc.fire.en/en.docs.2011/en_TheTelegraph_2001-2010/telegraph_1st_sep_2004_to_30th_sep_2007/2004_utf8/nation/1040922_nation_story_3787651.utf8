 Indian touch to MIT 100

 Houston, Sept. 21 (PTI): Seven scientists of Indian origin, including Srinidhi Varadarajan who built a supercomputer from off-the-shelf commercial products, were named among the world?s top 100 young researchers in a technology review published by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

 The top 100 list, an annual event of the prestigious institute, recognises exceptional talent in fields like biotechnology, medicine, nanotechnology and computing.

 Besides Varadarajan, other young researchers of Indian origin who made it to the MIT list were Anuj Batra, Ramesh Raskar, Chaitali Sengupta, Ravi Kane, Vikram Sheel Kumar and Ananth Natarajan.

 Varadarajan, the director of Terascale Computing Facility, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, conceived and built the world?s third-fastest supercomputer from a cluster of 1,100 Apple Macintoshes. 

 The project cost around $5 million whereas similar supercomputers cost $100 million or more. The young researcher, who designed the supercomputer in less than three months, used off-the-shelf commercial products due to a funds constraint.

 Batra, a systems engineer at Texas Instruments, leads one of the industry?s top teams in advancing ultra wide-band wireless technology, which provides the high speeds needed for streaming media applications with low power consumption. 

 Raskar, a visiting research scientist at Mitsubishi Electric, was named for building large computer display systems that seamlessly combine images from multiple projectors. 

 His image-processing and graphics research may lead to new applications in entertainment, image-guided surgery and user interfaces, the review said. 

 Sengupta is a systems architect with Texas Instruments, which oversees the architecture of communication chips used in multimedia cellphones that handle Internet access, video conferencing and mobile commerce. 

 Kane, assistant professor, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, was selected for creating a highly potent anthrax treatment in which each drug molecule blocks multiple toxin molecules rather than just one. He is now extending the concept to anti-HIV therapies.

 Another young researcher, Kumar, CEO of Dimagi, is one of the founders of the Boston-based company which develops interactive software that motivates patients to manage chronic diseases such as diabetes and AIDS. 

 Natarajan, CEO of Infinite Biomedical Technologies, was named for devising technology that enables implantable cardiac devices to detect incipient heart attacks.

 The MIT review selected 69 men and 31 women from a pool of 500 nominations for this year?s honours.

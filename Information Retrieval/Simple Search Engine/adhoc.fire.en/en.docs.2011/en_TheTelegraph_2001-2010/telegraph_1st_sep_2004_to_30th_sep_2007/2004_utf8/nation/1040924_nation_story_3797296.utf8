The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Sushma sees fans, tourists stay firm

 OUR BUREAU 

 Sushma Swaraj

 Sept. 23: BJP leader Sushma Swaraj today denied that her party?s Savarkar satyagraha and subsequent law-violation programme in Port Blair on Tuesday had prevented tourists from visiting the Cellular Jail. 

 However, several tourists on their return said they had to bear the brunt of the BJP?s political agenda. 

 Visitors to the islands could not go to the jail following the Andaman district administration?s promulgation of prohibitory orders under Section 144 CrPC from Saturday on the jail premises. As a result, they were forced to forgo the famed light and sound show in the national memorial, a major tourist attraction. 

 Sushma today claimed in Delhi that the Sharma family, which was ?elated? to meet her in Port Blair, did not complain about their holiday being spoilt. 

 ?Yesterday, when we boarded the flight to Calcutta, two kids of the family came to me and asked if I recognised them. I did, of course. Then they asked if they could have my autograph because they did not have an autograph book when they came to my press conference (in Port Blair). They said ?we are not just your fans, we are your coolers?.? 

 ?I asked the children if they saw the sound and light show at the jail; they said no because their parents had already lined up a trip to another island. They added perhaps it is not in ?our naseeb (fate) to watch the show but another island. But we are very lucky because we could meet you?,? Sushma said. 

 When contacted in her Delhi residence, Priya, banker R.K. Sharma?s younger daughter, said she had complained to Sushma about ?my family?s unpleasant visit? to the Andaman island. 

 ?We were really elated to see Sushmaji both at the Peerless Hotel in Port Blair as well as on the flight yesterday. We also asked for her autograph. But everywhere we told her that we had to miss the light and sound show in the historic jail because of the BJP?s political programme,? the 14-year-old said. 

 Priti, her elder sister, said: ?We have nothing against Sushmaji. But our point is that why should tourists like us suffer for political parties? programmes. Why should they be debarred from visiting the historic jail?? 

 ?After all, tourists like us spent a lot of money on visiting the Andaman island.? Both Priya and Priti had walked up to Sushma on the flight to Calcutta yesterday. 

 Sharma, an officer of Punjab National Bank, is still crestfallen at the huge amount of money he had to spend on the holiday ?for nothing?. ?The main purpose of the visit was lost,? he said tonight, adding that he took the children to another island after they were denied permission to visit the jail.

 Sonia Gandhi: More power, less freedom

 New Delhi, Sept. 7: Sonia 

 Gandhis movements, already restricted by the Special Protection 

 Group cover she has been provided, have been curbed further 

 after the Congress returned to power in May.

 Sonia suspended her Tuesday morning visits to the 24 Akbar Road party headquarters after the Congress ended its eight-year stint on the Opposition benches. She used to spend every Tuesday morning at the headquarters interacting with workers and party functionaries when she was in the capital.

 A party functionary felt security considerations, reflecting the changed political scenario in which Sonia has emerged as the topmost leader of the ruling coalition at the Centre, may have prompted the change.

 As the Congress chiefs threat perception has increased, security was beefed up around her official residence and the party headquarters immediately after the United Progressive Alliance government was formed.

 Entry to the party office has also been made stricter due to security considerations. As a result, former Delhi minister Narendra Nath, a prominent contender for the Delhi Congress chiefs post, found it difficult to enter the party office recently. Security personnel have been instructed to guide visitors through the reception door where registration is compulsory.

 Sonias visits to the party office have become infrequent of late. The last time she visited the party office, barely 50 metres from her 10 Janpath residence, was on Independence Day when she hoisted the Tricolour.

 But sources said Sonia has not stopped meeting party workers. She interacts with partymen at 10 Janpath, a source said.

 A Congress media department functionary said Sonias Tuesday visits to the headquarters have been suspended temporarily. He said security may be a reason, but added that the party chiefs office is not available at present as it is being renovated. The renovation reportedly includes a security upgrade.

 Another Sonia office is yet to be completed: the secretariat of the National Advisory Council of which she is chairperson with the rank of cabinet minister. The 2A Motilal Nehru Marg bungalow, located close to her official residence, is also being renovated.

 Congress Rajya Sabha MP Jairam Ramesh, a member of the advisory council, said the secretariat office will be ready shortly. Sonia has been holding council meetings at her residence during the last two months.

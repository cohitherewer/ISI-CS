 Sack amp; jail for Siachen major 

 OUR BUREAU

 Dec. 21: Ketchup and liquor blots are spreading on the starched olive army uniform, besmirching a reputation built on blood and discipline over centuries. The stain spread today with a major?s dismissal from service for faking encounters on the Siachen glacier. 

 Major Surinder Singh, accused of staging the killing of Pakistani soldiers on the world?s highest battlefield for medals of honour, was also sentenced to three years? rigorous imprisonment by an army court set up in September at Jodhpur. 

 He is the second casualty in the ?ketchup scandal?, which had earlier claimed a colonel for faking encounters in the Northeast. 

 Singh ?has been found guilty of all charges by the general court marshal and is cashiered (deprived of his rank and retirement benefits) from the army and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for three years?, the court said. 

 Brigadier A.D.S. Grewal, who presided over the seven-member jury, announced the judgment after a six-hour sitting, sources said. 

 The verdict will be sent to the general officer commanding-in-chief of the southern command for ?confirmation?, they added. 

 Singh, who has been combative throughout the months-long proceedings, said he would move court against the order. 

 ?As far as the rigorous imprisonment is concerned, I will go to the high court. If required, I will not hesitate to even move the Supreme Court? I have full faith that the law of the country is not in such a bad shape like the army,? he said. 

 This is the third time in a few weeks that military courts have had to crack the whip on corruption in the ranks. After the colonel, Brigadier R.P. Singh was cashiered for diverting liquor from the army canteens to private parties. 

 The sources said the court of inquiry had found Singh, a Gorkha Rifles officer, guilty of faking the killing of five ?enemy soldiers? and busting two ?enemy bunkers? on August 24 and September 21 last year. He had filmed the encounters to buttress his claims to bravery awards. 

 After the order, Singh said ?this is not justice. My commanding officer has made a scapegoat out of me. We have been taught to obey orders and I followed the orders of Col K.D. Singh?? 

 He accused army chief General N.C. Vij of having taken a ?personal vindictive stand? against him, pointing out that he had been made an accused though he was a complainant. He had told the court that Col Singh had ordered the encounters.

 Riot top-cop out of CBI

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 25: The Centre today informed the Supreme Court it was transferring CBI additional director P.C. Pande, who had a controversial stint as Ahmedabad police commissioner during the Gujarat riots, to the Union home ministry.

 Within hours of this submission, the Centre issued an administrative order posting Pande to the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP). In its order, the home ministry asked the department of personnel and training, the CBI?s cadre-controlling body, to relieve Pande with immediate effect so that he can take up his new posting.

 The 1970 batch Gujarat-cadre IPS officer took over as CBI additional director last March. His appointment was as controversial as the role of the police during the 2002 post-Godhra riots, with many non-governmental organisations petitioning the Supreme Court that the bureau was probing some riot cases.

 Earlier, solicitor-general G.E. Vahanvati informed the Supreme Court that a decision was pending on Pande?s transfer to another department from the CBI. The court then disposed a raft of public interest litigation from various NGOs challenging Pande?s appointment. But it made it clear that his new appointment should ?not include any matter relating to the Gujarat communal riots?.

 Pande has been appointed on a lateral shift and on deputation to the border police until March 2, 2008 or until further orders, the order said. The home ministry has asked the CBI to let it know when Pande will be relieved.

 The PILs had alleged that Pande?s role in investigating post-Godhra riot cases was ?dubious? and contained many lapses. It added that the CBI was probing many riot cases.

 The government will now have to appoint another additional director from a list of names recommended by a high-powered committee comprising the central vigilance commissioner, CBI director, home secretary and secretary (personnel). 

 The names of additional director Vijaya Shankar, director-general of police (training) S. Ramani and K.K. Mandal, a senior IPS officer from the Bengal cadre, are doing the rounds.

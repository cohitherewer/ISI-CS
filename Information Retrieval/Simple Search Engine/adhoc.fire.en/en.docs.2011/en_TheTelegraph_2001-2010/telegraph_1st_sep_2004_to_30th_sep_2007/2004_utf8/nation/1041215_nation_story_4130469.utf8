 Advani flak for flock

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 14: BJP president L.K. Advani has taken exception to his party MPs absenting themselves not only from Parliament sittings but also the meetings of the parliamentary party and other forums. 

 He has asked the deputy leader of the BJP parliamentary party, V.K. Malhotra, to seek an explanation from absentee members and direct them to regularly attend meetings and participate in voting.

 Advani?s censure ? delivered at the weekly parliamentary party meeting today ? was occasioned by several BJP MPs not turning up to vote in the elections to the various boards and research and academic institutions held last week. These included the coir, tea, coffee and the rubber boards and the Indian Council of Agricultural Research.

 Most of the bodies have a provision for two MPs ? one from the treasury bench and the other from the Opposition. Sources said if none of the BJP members lost these elections, it was only thanks to large-scale absenteeism on the other side as well. Advani asked Malhotra to draw up a list of the ?errant? MPs and write to them individually.

 The BJP chief also expressed his annoyance with MPs not showing up at the parliamentary party meetings. Sources said the standard excuse was they had to attend weddings in their families and constituencies.

 Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who chaired the meeting, said he was perturbed by the lack of legislative business in Parliament.

 In today?s meeting, it was decided that a discussion under Rule 193 on the mid-year review of the economy should take place in this session. 

 Malhotra told reporters that the review, presented in the Lok Sabha by finance minister P. Chidambaram yesterday, confirmed the ?apprehensions? voiced by the BJP when the general budget was presented. ?We said the budget was inflationary and anti-development and will result in a huge budgetary deficit,? he said.

 Malhotra said, according to the survey, the budgetary deficit ? estimated at Rs 76,171 crore for a year ? was already Rs 60,000 crore in six months. 

 ?At this rate, inflation will remain between seven and eight per cent and the government will not be able to bring it down to 6.5 per cent as it claims,? he said.

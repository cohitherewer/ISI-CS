 Asia Week kicks off with song and dance

Dance amp; confusion

 A Thai princess and some song, dance and food from four countries kicked off the Asia Week extravaganza in Milano, otherwise known as Le Vie Dell ?Oriente. The venue was the delightful Hotel Principe di Savoia, hosted by Massimo Zanello, minister of industry, Lombardy region. The star guest was a princess, no less, from Thailand, though no one has yet managed to find out her name. Her Royal Highness, however, will do just fine.

 The wine flowed and the spirits were high. The packed hall welcomed the Indian diplomatic community, movers and shakers from the design and fashion industries, representatives of the media and the delegations from India ? minister of industry and commerce Nirupam Sen, et al? Thailand, Singapore and Hong Kong.

 Thai and Indian dance provided pre-dinner entertainment, though the venue was less than conducive to any kind of viewing. The dancers, by the end of it, were rather upset, to say the least, and the guests, more than a little confused.

 That aside, there was a craft corner where Thai artists painted paper fans. Three craft forms from Bengal were presented ? shola carving, tangail weaving and pat. The high point here was the tiny, fully functional hand-operated tangail loom and charki, which could create a tussar sari, albeit a minuscule one.

 The nameless princess, Bengal?s minister, Indian ambassador to Italy Himachal Som and other high-powered guests had a leisurely sit-down dinner (while the rest made do with the buffet), sampling the best from each of the country counters.

 The huge hall left some guests in the dark as to what was exactly where. The waiters ? equally overcome ?managed to convince some of the diners that the spread from Hong Kong was Indian. (A rice pudding that looked exactly like Dal Makhani may have also done the trick.)

 The princess, charming in a purple silk gown, left quite a large hole in some hopeful hearts.

 Statutory warning for the stricken: she is only 17 and clearly (if for no other reason), out of bounds.

Playing it cool

 Nirupam Sen seemed quite relaxed at the gala. If sharing the VIP table with the underage princess left him unflustered, it may have been because his first day of selling Bengal to the Italians had proved quite successful. Sen, accompanied by industry secretary Sabyasachi Sen and the crew from the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC), travelled to Valenza, where he met the jewellery manufacturing association to tell them about the possibilities Calcutta and Bengal had to offer.

 They visited a high-end jewellery factory, where the delegation was blown over by the quality of the creations. Then it was on to Alessandria, where the chamber of commerce for agro-processing was waiting.

 While the first meet seemed to carry potential, the second was rather more lukewarm, according to Gopal Krishna, managing director, WBIDC. But the folks from the jewellery hub are expected to pay a visit to Calcutta by the end of the year. While they had some concerns about duties, the lure of the yellow gold (read: cheap labour) at Manikanchan may bring in some business from far-off Milano.

 Day two, Saturday, saw Sen doing the rounds at the two exhibitions set up in the city. And the fashion show could not draw him out of more pressing business matters.

Tongue twister 

 When in Rome, you might choose to throw caution to the winds and not act as the Romans do, but in Milan, it would be wise to at least learn some Italian. Surprisingly few people speak English in Italy ?s business capital (even the computer at the business centre is set to Italian).

 While the suits seem to have recognised the need to pick it up, most others have preferred to learn French or other continental languages. The isle across the channel (and their friends from across the Atlantic, if the unprintable wall graffiti is to be trusted) doesn?t have the most popular folk around these parts.

 One Italian journalist tried to explain the phenomenon: ?We are Catholic, they are Protestant. We live well, eat well and dress well. Their food isn?t fit for dogs.?

 Strong words and an opinion not shared by all, but it is well nigh impossible to get by without a few critical phrases. Or you can simply fake it. Most of the Indian delegates have adopted a softer way of speech, avoiding harsh consonant sounds and adding vowels to everything (which, one assumes, suits the rosogolla tongues just fine). And it must be said, throwing in a ciao or two works rather well.

Catching Sabyasachi

 It was hours before the biggest show of his career, but on Saturday morning, Sabyasachi Mukherjee was enjoying the melting mood of Milan. Walking down the streets for some last-minute shopping was the best thing that could have happened in a city where every street, every corner is ?full of inspiration?.

 Baguettes are the accessories for the ramp at Fiera Milano at 3.30 pm, Milan time. A bakery provides ample choice of breads. ?I am looking for the right textures,? he says. Crisp whole-wheat buns and long bread sticks are to go into the bags and be eaten on the ramp. Though all his clothes are in order, a shop selling stockings proves too much to resist for the south Calcutta boy.

 Chocolates are the next touch. Not tiny pretty pieces but bars, again with interesting textures. Twenty bars for the team of around 20. Walking the ramp can leave a girl a little hungry, especially when she is trying to capture the lost-little-girl spirit.

 To go with the vintage, romantic look of his collection Pepsi (or Sabya, or whatever else you want to call him) walks into a tiny store selling flowers, fresh and dry. The few sprigs of red berries and flowers he picks up are being wrapped by the grey-haired gentlemen behind the counter. Style oozes from every pore of Milan, and things are no different here. He wraps the stems delicately in brown paper, ties them lovingly with a length of beautiful brown natural fibre. The only risk with such perfection is that our resident star designer may choose not to return to Hazra as scheduled.

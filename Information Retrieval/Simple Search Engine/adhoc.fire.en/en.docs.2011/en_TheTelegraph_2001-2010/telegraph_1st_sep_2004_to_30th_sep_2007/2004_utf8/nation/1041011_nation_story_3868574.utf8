 Sharp decline in polio cases

 Coimbatore (PTI): Sixty-eight cases of 

 polio have been reported so far this year in the country, 

 a senior medical officer in the World Health Organisation, 

 has said.

 The country, which had 1,126 polio cases in 1999, was able to bring it down by creating awareness and largescale immunisation programmes over the last five years, said Dr G.K. Durairaj, surveillance medical officer of WHO?s National Polio Surveillance Project.

 However, because of ?complacency and laxity? the number of cases increased to 1,600 in 2002, from 265 in 2000 and 268 in 2001, Durairaj said.

 The cases came down from 225 in 2003 to 68 this year after largescale awareness and immunisation programmes carried out by the government and no case is anticipated in 2005, he added.

 Of the 68 cases reported, the highest, 47 cases, have been reported from Uttar Pradesh, followed by Bihar with 12, Maharashtra and Delhi with two each and Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Uttaranchal and West Bengal with one each.

 Eye on stamp scam finances

 New Delhi (PTI): The CBI has constituted 

 a seven-member team, which will ascertain the financial 

 magnitude of the fake stamp paper scam and analyse the bank 

 transactions of the people involved, including its kingpin 

 Abdul Karim Telgi.

 Deputy inspectors-general Arun Kumar and Prabodh Kumar, RBI deputy general manager E. Karthak, technical officer of State Bank of India .K. Handa and superintendents of police S. Jagannathan, S.K. Jha and Alok Mittal will be the members of this group. Karthak and Handa are now on deputation to the CBI.

 The committee will also look into aspects like account-wise tabulation and analysis of debits from the bank accounts to work out the end use of funds. 

 This would include finding out whether the funds have been used ? towards creation of assets or for laundering into other areas of business.

 The team will make an analysis of credits into the bank accounts with a view to link them with the supply of fake stamps and also the income tax returns filed by Telgi and his accomplices.

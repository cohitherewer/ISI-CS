 New Delhi, Nov. 28: Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee?s hopes of running a smooth winter session of Parliament may come to nought with the re-induction of Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) chief Shibu Soren into the cabinet.

 The main Opposition party, the BJP, reacted swiftly to Soren?s re-entry, saying it ?suspected? the ?moral fabric? of the government. Officially, the party maintains it will not ?disturb? proceedings but will ?aggressively, offensively and effectively? raise the issue of the Kanchi seer?s arrest and Soren?s re-induction in the winter session, which begins on Wednesday.

 It was the issue of tainted ministers in the UPA government which had provoked the BJP to stall the budget session. The Union budget was also passed without a discussion.

 Soren had stepped down in July after an arrest warrant was issued against him in a Jharkhand massacre case. The government has chosen to take him back following his release on bail. According to political analysts, the forthcoming Jharkhand elections, in which the JMM will be a major player, is one of the main reasons which prompted the government to take him back into the cabinet.

 But the BJP is not lowering its guard even though it assured the Lok Sabha Speaker at an all-party meeting on November 23 that it would allow House proceedings to continue. At the same time, the BJP leadership also conveyed to the ruling party that it would raise issues close to its heart.

 Atal Bihari Vajpayee and L.K. Advani have put the onus of smooth running of the House on the ruling coalition. At the all-party meeting with the Speaker, the BJP leaders accused the government of not allowing Opposition members to raise issues.

 The UPA, on the other hand, is determined to run the short winter session, which spans less than 20 days with weekends coming in between. The CPI has already accused the government of cutting short parliamentary sessions and has said that this would lead to an ?authoritarian? trend.

 The government wants to pass as many as 20 bills in the session. Parliamentary affairs minister Ghulam Nabi Azad has indicated that the session may be extended, if necessary. 

 Among the important bills are the patents amendment bill, prevention of domestic violence bill and the public health emergency bill. Eleven bills will replace ordinances.

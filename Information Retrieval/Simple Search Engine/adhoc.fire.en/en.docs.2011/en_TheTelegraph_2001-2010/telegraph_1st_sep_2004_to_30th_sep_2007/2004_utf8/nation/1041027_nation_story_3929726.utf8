 Naidu fights south ?canard?

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 26: None of the three BJP chiefs from the south of the Vindhyas have lasted their term. 

 Bangaru Laxman was sacked after he was caught accepting money on camera. K. Jana Krishnamurthi was eased out when he became too much his own man and stopped consulting A.B. Vajpayee and .K. Advani. M. Venkaiah Naidu was thought of as another name for Advani, so he survived the odd attempt at denigrating Vajpayee to promote his mentor.

 When it is time for Naidu to exit, the buzz in a section of the BJP is no southerner could succeed in the party. But Naidu ? as he prepares to demit office tomorrow ? disagreed with the ?canard?. ?Some people wrote the party did injustice to the South. This is injustice and humiliation to me that I was linked to a particular state. I have gone beyond all this,? he said.

 The outgoing chief, who has insisted he be addressed as Venkaiah Naidu from now on, sought to put the record straight at a farewell lunch he hosted for the media today. ?I have seen different interpretations in the media. In Delhi?s political circles truth is not what it is but how it is projected. I, too, could have said things selectively and made it appear like the truth. But I speak from my heart because I am trained that way, never to suppress the truth.?

 Naidu said his exit was not because of the poll reverses.?When the NDA was in power, I went to Vajpayee and told him Advani?s leadership is very much needed. He said ?I cannot spare him from the government?. I knew then and I know now, the post is bigger than an individual.?

 Naidu maintained the RSS had nothing to do with the change. Also, he was not responsible for either the BJP victories or the defeats. ?The president presides, the committee decides. No party line is decided by an individual.?

 As for the charge that he was not a mass leader, Naidu said: ?I was the MLA for a constituency where there was no BJP and not much of RSS. I subsequently decided that I cannot be grounded in one constituency because I devoted my entire time to expanding the party?s base.?

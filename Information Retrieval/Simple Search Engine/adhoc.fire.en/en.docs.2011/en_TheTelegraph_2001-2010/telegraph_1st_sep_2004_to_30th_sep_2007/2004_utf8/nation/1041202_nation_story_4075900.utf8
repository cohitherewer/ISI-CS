 Price rise ire, left amp; right

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 1: The United Progressive Alliance government is at the receiving end of both the Left and the Right over price rise, particularly that of petroleum. 

 Parliament?s winter session got off to a fiery start today with the BJP staging protests inside and outside the House. 

 In the Lok Sabha, BJP leader Vijay Kumar Malhotra squarely blamed the Centre for a ?back-breaking? price hike and party MPs walked out. 

 Similar echoes of disaffection emanated from the Left ranks. 

 Senior CPI MP Gurudas Dasgupta lambasted the government and demanded ?total rollback? of prices of petroleum products. 

 ?The Left parties are supporting this government, but they were not consulted on the issue,? he said.

 He was, however, quick to demarcate the Left?s stand from that of the Opposition. 

 ?I do not join the NDA on this issue because they also took similar kinds of decisions when they were in power,? Dasgupta said. 

 ?The Prime Minister and the finance minister had assured us that inflation will not cross the 5 per cent mark. But the figure is now more than 7 per cent,? said Malhotra. 

 The common minimum programme means giving ?minimum? to the ?common? person, the BJP MP added.

 The Centre had last month slashed the price of petrol and announced the withdrawal of the additional Rs 5 that was going to be added to the price of LPG. But the Left is far from satisfied. 

 ?We will oppose each and every unilateral decision this government is taking. But at the same time, we are not going to allow the BJP to extract political capital out of this,? Dasgupta said.

 Earlier, the CPI leadership had asked Dasgupta to tone down his criticism of the UPA government following complaints from a section of senior Congress leaders. 

 The Left is walking a thin line trying to balance its criticism of the government and not letting the BJP expose chinks in the alliance.

 Malhotra said the UPA government is in a ?minority? on this issue. ?Let there be a discussion on the subject under Rule 184 and I am sure two-thirds of the members will vote against the government,? the BJP leader said. 

 A discussion under this rule requires voting in the House.

 Dasgupta said he ?suspects? the government is increasing petroleum prices not because of spiralling international crude oil prices but because it wants to mobilise additional revenue. ?The government should tax people who are spending Rs 250 crore on marriage ceremonies.?

 Axe on prison officials

 OURCORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Dec. 6: Bihar jail minister Raghavendra Pratap Singh today suspended the superintendent of Beur Central Jail, P.K. Jha, and two other officials on the recommendation of inspector-general (prisons) Deepak Kumar Singh, who had caught Madhepura MP Pappu Yadav in the act at the same prison last week.

 ?We have realised that serious offences have been committed by the said officials in the jail, which warrants their suspension,? minister Singh said here today.

 Besides the superintendent, assistant jailer Arjun Prasad Singh and head warden Rambali Prasad have been suspended. Jha was transferred to Sasaram jail earlier, but he continued to serve in Beur for the administration?s alleged failure to get his replacement. 

 The prompt action follows the Supreme Court?s intervention in the matter. The court took suo motu cognisance of media reports on the alleged unruly behaviour of the visitors. The timing of the durbar coincided with the visit of the IG (prisons) in connection with a function to mark World AIDS Day.

 Both the CBI and Singh were directed to submit their reports on or before December 13. 

 The jail minister had also issued a showcause notice to jail superintendent Jha after getting news of the incident.

 While the administration decided to take the errant officials to task, the man at the centre of the controversy ? Pappu Yadav ? continued with his fast inside the jail. According to sources, Yadav wanted to be shifted to All-India Institute of Medical Sciences in Delhi for better treatment, but his ?request? was declined.

 ?A conspiracy is being hatched to eliminate me. This jail is no longer safe for me,? sources quoted Yadav as saying.

 Yadav had a mild fall while playing badminton inside the jail recently and he claimed to have health complications such as high blood pressure.

 Jail minister Singh has described the fast as ?unjustified?. ?If he (Yadav) has any complaint against the jail officials or anyone else, he should approach us. But shifting him to the Delhi hospital is not in our hands. He was brought here following the order of the Supreme Court. Only the same court can order his transfer to some other hospital. Let him appeal to the court,? he said. 

 IG Singh said Yadav is under regular medical supervision and the MP should not worry about his health.

 The government is reportedly planning to shift all ?tainted? politicians and the most notorious inmates of Beur Central Jail to the central prison in Bhagalpur, which is in for a security overhaul.

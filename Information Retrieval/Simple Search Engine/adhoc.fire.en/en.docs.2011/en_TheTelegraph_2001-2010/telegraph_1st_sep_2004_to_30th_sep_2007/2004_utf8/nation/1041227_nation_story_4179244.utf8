 Govt gropes in darkness of devastation 

 ALOKE TIKKU 

 New Delhi, Dec. 26: As home minister Shivraj Patil set off on a tour of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu today, his heart would have been heavy with the reports of death and destruction there. But gnawing at his mind would be fears born of a lack of information from the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. 

 The haze was worrying the minister and his team of top officials monitoring the disaster as home ministry officials had managed to speak to the deputy commissioner of the Union territory over satellite phone but had little clue about the extent of devastation. 

 However, PTI quoted a police official as saying that at least 1,000 people were feared killed and over 200 injured in the Union territory.

 ?The situation is very grim. Three hundred were confirmed dead... mostly in Car Nicobar, while 700 were untraced for a long time and believed to be dead,? inspector-general of police S.B. Deol said.

 The entire air force base in Nicobar islands has been virtually washed away leaving 23 air force personnel and their family members dead, the agency quoted Air Chief Marshal S. Krishnaswamy as saying. ?Reports reaching us till this evening say that 63 more people are missing from the base.?

 The islands are the closest India gets to the Sumatra epicentre of the 8.9 quake this morning. The Great Nicobar island lies barely 250 km from the northern tip of Indonesia. 

 The string of islands south of Car Nicobar down to Indira Point ? the southern tip of India ? has a combined population of about 45,000 people. Add to this a few thousand tourists who are believed to have arrived on their winter vacation. 

 ?We do not know what has happened there,? said a home ministry official overseeing the relief and rescue missions that the disaster management division of the ministry is coordinating. But if their worst fears come true, he said the death and devastation recorded on the mainland would be dwarfed. 

 Patil spoke about the estimated fatalities on the mainland, but did not say a word about the archipelago. ?The situation there is unclear because of no reports from that side,? Patil told reporters before flying to Andhra Pradesh.

 The home ministry fears that the Andamans, which stretch along 700 km, would have borne the brunt of the tsunamis churned up by the Sumatra quake and an aftershock measuring 7.3 on the Richter scale recorded much closer to the Great Nicobar island. 

 There were no reports of damage to ships in the deep seas, but three passenger ships docked in Port Blair were damaged, one of them severely, officials said.

 Unlike the Andaman islands, the Great Nicobar island are much smaller and not as wide, opening up the possibility of the leaving a larger proportion of the people open to the risk of having to fight a losing battle with the giant wall of water crashing on them. ?But there is also a possibility that people in these smaller islands live on hillocks. That would have saved them,? the official said. 

 Two ships have left for the islands this afternoon but they will take about 34 hours to reach, the official said. 

 A Dornier aircraft left earlier from the Tambaram air base in the suburbs of Chennai on a reconnaissance mission, but it has not be able to give a clear picture of the situation in the islands either. 

 Satellite imagery is another dependable source of information, but the satellite passes over the region around 5 pm. By the time the image is processed and interpreted, it would be late in the night. ?We are not very sure of the situation there... but we should have a clear picture of what happened there by early tomorrow morning, if not late tonight,? said home secretary Dhirendra Singh. 

 He added that the Port Blair runway had been closed for civilian aircraft due to a ?big crack? though the air force succeeded in landing a AN 32 cargo aircraft. The runway is expected to be repaired by tomorrow when evacuation sorties will be carried out.

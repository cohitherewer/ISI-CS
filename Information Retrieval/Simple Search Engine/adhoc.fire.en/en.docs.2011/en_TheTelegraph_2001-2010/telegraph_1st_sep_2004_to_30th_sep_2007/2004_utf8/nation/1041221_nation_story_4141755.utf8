 Distance gift from varsity

 FARHANA KALAM

 Gaya, Dec. 20: Scam-scarred Magadh University is in the news again, but this time for a positive development.

 Authorities of the university, who met recently, have decided to chart the distance education path.

 The university has been rocked by a series of controversies, including an examination and appointment scam and a fake degree racket. Besides, three former vice-chancellors and as many principals of constituent colleges face criminal charges. 

 One of the three former vice-chancellors to be chargesheeted by the economic offences wing of the CID, S.C. Mukherjee, has been a judge of Patna High Court. 

 The CID chargesheeted him for his alleged involvement in the Shikha Gupta degree case. Gupta, the wife of Anurag Gupta, a former superintendent of police of Gaya, was declared to have cleared the MA (History) examination of the university with first-class marks even though she allegedly did not appear in seven of the eight papers.

 On December 15, the Senate decided to set up a directorate of distance education, which will introduce courses such as Master of Business Administration, Master of Computer Application, Master of Library Science, B.Ed and M.Ed in due course. 

 The other courses to be introduced by the directorate include Postgraduate Diploma in Mass Communication, Journalism, Biotechnology and a training programme for primary teachers.

 University professor Arun Kumar Prasad feels the training programme will help the scores of untrained teachers, appointed by the government to fill vacancies in primary schools, who have nowhere to go at present to learn the tricks of the trade.

 Shedding light on the sorry state of primary education in Bihar, Prasad said about 57 per cent of girls in the state have never been to school. 

 Addressing the Senate meeting, vice-chancellor Shamshad Hussain said the government and the governor, who is also the Chancellor, have given their consent to the distance education courses. Though the government will not fund the courses, Hussain believed that they will be able to run the show without any problem.

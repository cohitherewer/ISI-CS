Lucknow, Nov. 27: Samajwadi 

 Party general secretary Amar Singh today said he would urge 

 Kokilaben Ambani to mediate in the alleged feud between 

 her sons Mukesh and Anil for the stakes in the quarrel are 

 very high ? Reliance is the country?s largest business house.

 ?Kokilaben is like my mother and I will request her to intervene and resolve the matter,? he said.

 Singh has been in the thick of controversy after the Uttar Pradesh Congress chief Salman Khursheed accused him of engineering a rift between the Ambani brothers. ?I am not even remotely connected with the entire episode,? he said today. 

 Political circles have speculated that the feud is linked to Anil?s proximity with the Mulayam Singh Yadav government in Uttar Pradesh ?the younger Reliance scion became a Rajya Sabha MP in June with the Samajwadi Party?s support. But chief minister Mulayam Singh has dismissed this theory as a ?figment of imagination?.

 Singh?s comments this evening came after the inauguration of an exhibition of paintings on actor Amitabh Bachchan and the release of a book on his father, poet Harvanshrai Bachchan. 

 Singh said the brothers should close ranks and remain united for the sake of the vast industrial empire the family has built over the years. ?Ghee dal me aaye ya dal ghee me jaaye, samjhauta ho jana chahiye (Either brother should act to remove the bad blood and reach a settlement),? the Samajwadi Party general secretary said. 

 ?I would suggest (the) respected wife of Dhirubhai Ambani should step in positively to end this deadlock to protect the legacy of Dhirubhai Ambani,? he added.

 ?I have deep emotional ties with Anil but this has nothing to do with their business and industry. Sometimes emotional relations are thicker than blood. I can claim to have that. But I play absolutely no role in their feud,? Singh said.

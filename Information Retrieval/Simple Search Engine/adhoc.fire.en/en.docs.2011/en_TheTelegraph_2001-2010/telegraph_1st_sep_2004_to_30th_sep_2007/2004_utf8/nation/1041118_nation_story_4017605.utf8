 Post-quota, garment workers look to US

 Ahmedabad, Nov. 17 (Reuters): Among the millions around the world whose lives will change when global textile quotas expire at the end of the year are the illiterate women garment workers of Gujarat.

 The end of a system that has capped poor countries? textile exports to the rich world for more than 40 years is inspiring the women to set their sights on selling their colourful hand-woven products to leading retailers in the US and Europe.

 To that end, the Self-Employed Women?s Association (Sewa), a group of informal-sector rural women workers, plans to move into a modern composite mill to produce garments that meet global quality standards.

 ?It?s an opportunity that we don?t want let go. We are trying to get our unit started by January so that we are there to take our share in the post-quota period,? said Rema Nanavaty, who heads Sewa?s garment venture. Sewa, whose members have been making clothes in run-down buildings that still bear the scars of the 2001 earthquake that devastated Gujarat, has received inquiries from top retail chains such as Wal-Mart Inc.

 ?This can be a big opportunity and we intend to cash in on that by setting up a big unit,? Nanavaty said.

 China is expected to be the big winner from the shake-out of the $350-billion-a-year global trade in textiles and clothing. It could triple its share of the US market for imported clothes to 50 per cent once it is freed of export quotas, according to a World Trade Organisation study.

 But India should also do well. The Geneva-based trade watchdog reckons India could quadruple its share of the American market from 2002 levels to 15 per cent.

 Anticipating a surge in demand, leading Indian textile firms such as Arvind Ltd and Raymond Industries Ltd are ramping up capacity and upgrading technology.

 The country?s textile industry directly employs nearly 35 million skilled and unskilled workers. Its overseas sales of more than $11 billion account for about 24 per cent of the country?s total exports.

 Welspun India Ltd., the world?s fifth-largest terry towel-maker, is more than doubling manufacturing capacity in western India to scoop up new market opportunities. ?Our new unit will start production only in March 2005, but 40 per cent of the new capacity for next year is already booked,? said Rajesh Mandawewala, Welspun?s executive director.

 ?The quotas were the biggest impediment we faced in export markets. With the end of quotas and cheap financing available, we are in an expansionary mode,? Mandawewala said. Welspun exports nearly 90 per cent of its output.

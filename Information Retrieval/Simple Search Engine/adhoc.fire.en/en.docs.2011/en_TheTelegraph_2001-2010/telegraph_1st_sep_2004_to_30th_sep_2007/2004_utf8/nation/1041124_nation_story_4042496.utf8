 Naga trip put off

 Dimapur, Nov. 23: Naga militant leaders Isak Chishi Swu and Thuingaleng Muivah have indefinitely postponed their trip to India at the Prime Minister?s invitation because of a dispute over support to rival groups, reports our correspondent.

 Swu, the chairman of the NSCN (I-M), and Muivah, the group?s general secretary, were to reach New Delhi on Sunday to hold discussions on ?substantive issues? with the Prime Minister and other central leaders. This was to be followed by a series of ?consultative meetings? with representatives of various public and political organisations of Nagaland.

 A statement said the NSCN (I-M) was anguished over Delhi?s ?half-hearted response? to its queries. It accused the government of continuing clandestine activities with ?discredited groups?. It accused security forces and intelligence agencies of arming and abetting the activities of its rivals, the NSCN (Khaplang) and the Naga National Council (Adino). Security forces allegedly escorted NSCN (K) leader Kughalu Mulatonu to Delhi recently to hold a news meet, where he spoke out against the I-M group. 

 ?Till now, we have not received any suitable response from the Government of India on the objections raised by us. So it is not possible now for our leaders to visit this month,? said K. Chawang, the outfit?s deputy kilonser (minister) in charge of its ?ministry of information and publicity?.

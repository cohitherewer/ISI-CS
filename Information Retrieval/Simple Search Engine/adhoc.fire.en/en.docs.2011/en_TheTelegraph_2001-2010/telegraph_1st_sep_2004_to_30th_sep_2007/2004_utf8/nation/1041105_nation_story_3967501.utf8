 Union seeks say in PSU revamp

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 4: The Citu has demanded that the Centre consult trade unions and states on all proposals before restructuring public sector units.

 It said the proposed Board for Restructuring of Public Sector Enterprises (BRPSE) should be mandated to consult all stakeholders, particularly trade unions and the state governments concerned, while formulating restructuring/revival proposals, in line with the UPA?s common minimum programme.

 The Citu said the board should examine the viability of sick PSUs on a case-to-case basis with an open mind, delinking itself from any preconceived notion of closure/privatisation or recommendations of the administrative ministry or the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction.

 ?BRPSE should also ensure that holding-on operation for the sick PSUs continues till a consensus is reached on techno-economic viability and the revival package of the sick PSUs,? it said in a statement today.

 The Citu also stressed that payment of statutory/legitimate dues to PSU workers, which is under the board?s consideration, should not be linked to the sale of surplus assets or finding other sources of funds.

 The government, as the owner of PSUs and the employer of their staff, cannot renege on its commitments, citing restructuring/revival proceedings before the board, it said.

 The Citu urged the UPA to ensure that private firms or their representatives do not have a role in the board as non-official members.

 Child norm for polls

 Chennai, Sept. 9: Tamil Nadu may go the Haryana way if the government agrees to implement the ?two-child norm? for candidates in local-body elections, reports our special correspondent.

 The state poll panel, which conducts all local-body elections, has made a recommendation to this effect.

 State election commissioner V. Palanichamy today said the panel has advised the government that ?those with more than two children should be barred from contesting for positions at various levels in the local bodies?. Haryana was the first state to implement the norm.

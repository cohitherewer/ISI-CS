 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 8: An early warning system to track the outbreak of diseases such as malaria, cholera, typhoid, tuberculosis, polio and encephalitis was launched today.

 The Rs 408-crore World Bank-aided project, spread over five years, is in keeping with the United Progressive Alliance?s promise to accord importance to public health.

 Inaugurating the pilot project, health minister Anbumani Ramadoss said: ?The integrated disease surveillance project launched today would help notify the Centre and state within six hours if a death occurs due to some disease, and so detect disease outbreak well in advance.?

 He said the project is expected to provide essential data to monitor the progress of ongoing disease control programmes and will also help allocate health resources optimally.

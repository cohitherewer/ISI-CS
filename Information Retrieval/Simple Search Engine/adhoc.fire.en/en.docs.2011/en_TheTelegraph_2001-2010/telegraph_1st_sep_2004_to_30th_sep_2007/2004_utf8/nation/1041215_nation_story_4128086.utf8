 Varsity bid to fight land sharks

 GAUTAM SARKAR 

 Madhepura, Dec. 14: Taking a cue from Tilka Manjhi Bhagalpur University (TMBU) ? where cabbage is cultivated on land meant for growing plants to be studied ? authorities of B.N. Mandal University (BNMU) here have decided to use their land to generate revenue.

 Besides the economic benefits, the move will also help the authorities address the problem of land grabbing.

 According to BNMU estate officer Shailendra Kumar, land sharks are in control of over 300 acres of unused land, which belonged to the university. 

 At Bakunia village in Nauhatta block, the land mafia has encroached upon 200 acres of land, which belonged to MLT College, Saharsa, a constituent college of BNMU. ?The land could have been used to generate revenue for the university,? sources said. 

 MLT College authorities recently brought it to the notice of the vice-chancellor that owners of 15 shops in a complex built on its land have not paid their rent for a few months. ?The college can cope with its financial problems if the shop-owners pay the rent on time,? the sources added.

 After the abolition of the zamindari system, people with surplus land donated the same to set up colleges. So, most colleges under BNMU had large tracts of land at their disposal. But the menace of land grabbing slowly raised its head and went on to assume alarming proportions.

 Besides MLT College, land sharks have also targeted K.P. College, Murliganj (10 acres), MHS College, Sonbarsa (9.1 acres), and the local T.P. College (3.25 acres), to name only three, to spread their tentacles. 

 The estate officer pointed out that the university has a little over 1,026 acres of unused land at its constituent colleges, of which 306.97 acres are under control of the land mafia.

 Teachers and staff members of BNMU said the former vice-chancellor of TMBU, Ramashay Yadav, had initiated steps to save the university?s land from encroachers. ?There was bloodshed on the streets of Bhagalpur during the anti-encroachment drive but Yadav eventually succeeded in retrieving the university?s land. The same plots of land generate revenue for the university these days,? they added. 

 Expressing concern over rampant encroachment, they said, ?We need a vice-chancellor like Yadav who initiated a number of steps for the benefit of the university in Bhagalpur and its students,? the BNMU employees said. 

 The authorities of BNMU recently visited the constituent colleges and held talks with the principals as well as district officers. They have decided to launch an anti-encroachment drive to solve the problem once and for all. ?We have asked the district magistrate and superintendent of police to help us in this regard. The district officers have said they will extend their cooperation to drive out land sharks,? sources said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 It?s Shivaji versus Savarkar

 OUR BUREAU

 Oct. 1: The difference between the Congress-NCP manifesto released today and the Shiv Sena-BJP one, released on Tuesday, is tough to tell, including the point of Maharashtrian pride.

 The one big difference is that if the latter combine invoked Veer Savarkar for the October 13 Assembly elections by promising a ?Savarkar Jyot?, the former has found its icon in Shivaji.

 Mauled by the BJP-Sena campaign over the removal of Savarkar?s plaque from Cellular Jail, the Congress combine says (under the heading ?Pride of Maharashtra?) it will instal a ?Shiv Chhatrapati Smarak?, an ?international class? memorial, in the Arabian Sea at ?not less than Rs 100 crore?.

 Another is the ruling alliance?s pledge to implement in letter and spirit the Srikrishna Commission report on the Bombay riots of 1992-93; the rivals are silent.

 Otherwise, the two manifestos look like twins separated at birth, with small modifications.

 The Congress-NCP promises free power for pumps up to 5 HP and the rivals free power without mention of limits. It also pledges a 59 per cent waiver of dues and penal interest for farmers while the Sena-BJP promises a loan waiver, limits not specified.

 The ruling combine also offers 30 per cent subsidy to reclaim infertile land.

 It promises a Mumbai Infrastructure Fund to attract private funding with an initial corpus of Rs 1,500 crore. The Sena-BJP promises Mumbai Vision 2010.

 The Congress-NCP promises a legislative ban on the devadasi tradition; the rivals Sanjivni Yojana, a special education scheme for devadasis.

 On statehood for the Vidarbha region, both are quiet ? expected of the BJP-Sena but not quite of its rivals. But the ruling combine has promised roughly Rs 778 crore in assistance to the region.

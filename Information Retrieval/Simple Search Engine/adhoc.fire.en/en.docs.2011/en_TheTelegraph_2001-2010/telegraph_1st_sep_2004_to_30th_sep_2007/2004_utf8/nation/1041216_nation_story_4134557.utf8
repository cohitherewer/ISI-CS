The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Play fair off pitch, cricket bosses told

 R. VENKATARAMAN

 New Delhi, Dec. 15: India?s cricket board today contended that Jagmohan Dalmiya was ?still? its president despite Ranbir Singh Mahendra?s recent election, but was told by the Supreme Court that polls to elect the BCCI chief should be held in a manner ?acceptable? to the public.

 The observation, from Justices N. Santosh Hegde and S.B. Sinha, came as hearings resumed on a petition filed by the BCCI against the Madras High Court order restraining the newly-elected board from functioning and the appointment of Justice (retired) S. Mohan as interim administrator.

 The apex court had stayed the high court order, allowing Mahendra to function, but had restrained Dalmiya from becoming the board?s patron-in-chief, a post the former president had been elected to before the poll for board president.

 In that earlier election, Maharashtra Cricket Association (MCA) president Dhaneshwar Agasse was allowed to vote. But Agasse was not allowed to vote in the BCCI elections, which Dalmiya?s nominee Mahendra won by the former chief?s casting vote after a tie.

 Abhishek Manu Singhvi, who appeared for the BCCI, told the bench that Dalmiya ?is discharging functions as president? as, technically, a new board could not be constituted. He said the annual general meeting of the board in Calcutta on September 29 and 30 could not be concluded because of an interim order of a Chennai civil court. Therefore, under BCCI rules, Dalmiya, as on date, ?is the president of the BCCI?.

 The counsel, however, added that if ?your lordships ordered so, Dalmiya could step down right now?. ?If the Supreme Court struck down the order of the Chennai civil court enabling the general body to end, which was adjourned due to the civil court order, then Dalmiya would step down and the new office-bearers with Ranbir Singh as president? could take over, Singhvi said.

 At this, the court said: ?This means de jure (in reality) as on date Ranbir Singh Mahendra is not the president of (the) BCCI.? Singhvi nodded and requested it to pass an order for the conclusion of the general body meeting so that Mahendra could assume office.

 Singhvi also requested the court to vacate its ?interim order? restraining Dalmiya from becoming patron-in-chief. ?There is mischievous campaign in the press as well as in other quarters that Dalmiya would assume the de facto presidentship of the board by becoming the patron-in-chief,? he said. He gave an undertaking that ?the patron-in-chief has no official authority in the functioning of the BCCI which is controlled by the president and other elected members?.

 At this, the judges observed that the ?election of president (for BCCI) should be held in such a manner that it should be acceptable to the general public considering the importance of the board?.

 Singhvi argued that the BCCI under Dalmiya had committed no irregularities by preventing ?certain so-called representatives of the state cricket associations? as their legally nominated representatives took part in the BCCI election.

 But the judges, referring to the Agasse controversy, said they have to take a ?holistic view?. They said if they are ?satisfied that a particular person was prevented from voting? in Calcutta, ?then the question arises as to why was he allowed to vote by the board in the patron-in-chief election held earlier?.

 Siddhartha Shankar Ray, who appeared for Dalmiya, said he had submitted ?15 documents to prove how and why Agasse should not be allowed to vote? and ?going by those documentary proof, no chairman in the world, My Lord, will allow Agasse to vote?.

 Ray argued that S. Deshmukh, whom he described as ?one of the best cricket administrators of the country?, was the ?true representative? of the MCA and was allowed to vote. 

 Ray said Dalmiya, who raised a lot of money for cricket, also made it the most popular game in India. But ?green-eyed monsters? had started a vicious campaign against him.

 Shanti Bhushan, for the MCA, and Fali Nariman, for Agasse, would commence arguments tomorrow.

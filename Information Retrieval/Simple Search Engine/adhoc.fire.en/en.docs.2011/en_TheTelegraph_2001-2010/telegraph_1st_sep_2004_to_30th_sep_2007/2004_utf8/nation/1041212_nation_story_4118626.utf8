 Muslim board cracks, glare on Cong

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Dec. 11: A leader of the influential Barelvi sect yesterday broke away from the All-India Muslim Personal Law Board to form a ?parallel? body in a move that sources said was a setback to the fragile unity among various Islamic groupings across the country.

 Insiders in the parent council also voiced fear that the ?division? would undermine its authority as a credible voice of Muslims.

 But more alarming is the ?jadid? (new) board?s first remark that it is open to the idea of a negotiated settlement of the Ayodhya dispute. The statement is significant as it has come from Maulana Tauquir Raza, a self-proclaimed Congressman and now head of the parallel board.

 Throughout the day, Maulana Rabey Nadvi, the chief of the original law board, and other office-bearers were trying to figure out Raza?s agenda. 

 Whether the Congress-led coalition at the Centre was trying to prop up Raza, known to be close to party MP Ubaid-ullah Azmi, was one of the questions on their minds. Another question was why was the original board being sidelined if the objective was to arrive at a negotiated settlement.

 The timing of setting up the new board has intrigued the parent committee. Insiders said a year ago, when the BJP was in power and keen on an out-of-court settlement, there were concerted efforts to break the board. 

 A number of prominent Muslims like Maulana Asad Madni, Maulana Kalbe-Sadiq, the Shahi Imam of Jama Masjid, Ahmad Bukhari, and lesser known clerics, like Maulana Jamil Illyasi and the diwan of Ajmer Dargah, Zainulabeddin, were credited with the idea of setting up a parallel board.

 But the unity of the board ? which is not even a registered body and came into being in 1971 when various Islamic schools came together for a common approach to matters pertaining to Muslim personal law and the Shariat ? remained intact.

 A section of the law board today reacted sharply to the creation of the parallel body. 

 Others said it was better to ?ignore? Raza as the new body had no standing and did not represent a cross-section of various Islamic schools of thought.

 Mohammad Abdul Rahim Qureshi, a spokesperson for the original law board, said: ?The setting up of the new board was absolutely unnecessary and is a setback to the attempts of Muslims to unite against the onslaught on Muslim Shariat from various quarters.?

 Reacting to Raza?s charge that the original board had failed to safeguard the Shariat and the interests of Muslims, Qureshi said: ?The allegations against the existing board are absolutely baseless. The AIMPLB is the most representative of all schools of Muslim Shariat. All decisions of the board are taken strictly according to the Shariat and the board has never succumbed to any government pressure as alleged by those who have created a new board.?

 Qureshi rejected the charge that the Barelvi sect has been ignored. 

 He said the law board?s first president was Mufti Burhanulla Jabalpuri and, after his death, Mohammad Muzaffar Husain Kichchavi ? ?both known Barelvi leaders? ? held the post.

 ?Its present vice-president, Mohammad Mohammadul Hasan, is from Gulbarga Dargah and the board, at present, has 10 scholars of the Barelvi school itself, which shows the representative character of the body,? the spokesperson added.

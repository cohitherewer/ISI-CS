 IAF lands a record

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 2: The Indian Air Force today claimed it had set a world record for the highest landing by a helicopter after landing a Cheetal at Sasser Kangri Massif in eastern Ladakh this morning.

 The Cheetal is the improvised version of the older Cheetah helicopter produced by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited for the IAF. The Cheetal project is about two years old and the IAF put together its first squadron only this year.

 IAF sources said the two-seater Cheetal, flown by Group Captain A.S. Butola and Squadron Leader S. Sharma, landed at a pressure altitude of 23,220 feet (25,150 feet density altitude). The Cheetal broke the record so far held by a Bell 407 helicopter that had landed at 22,180 feet pressure altitude (24,971 feet density altitude).

 The record-setting landing of the Cheetal was witnessed and validated by Wing Commander (retired) Upadhyay, chief test pilot, rotary wing of Hindustan Aeronautics and Wing Commander (retired) Uni Pillay, who was flying in a Dhruv helicopter.

 The body of the Cheetal is mounted on a Cheetah airframe but it has been given a French TM-333-2b2 aero engine that generates 1000 BHP (horsepower). The engine for the Cheetah generates about 847 BHP. The combination of a lighter airframe and a more powerful engine has made the Cheetal capable of landing in and taking off from great heights. 

 ?We were motivated not by the quest for a record but to rescue casualties in a team of mountaineers,? the IAF sources said.

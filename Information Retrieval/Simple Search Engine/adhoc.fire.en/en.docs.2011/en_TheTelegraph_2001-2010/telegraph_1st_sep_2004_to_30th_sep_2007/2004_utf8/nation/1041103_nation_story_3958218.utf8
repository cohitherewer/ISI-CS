 Water in two classes

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 2: The Union cabinet meets tomorrow to decide on legally classifying water as ?food? but only packaged water will come under its scrutiny.

 The Centre?s decision to amend the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act to expand its definition of edible items to include water will plug a major legal loophole. 

 But this will not cover drinking water from the municipality that most households depend on.

 The government?s move follows the Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment?s survey last year that showed high quantities of pesticides and impurities in bottled water. Manufacturers and retailers had gone scot-free because of the legal loophole.

 Once the amendment to the act administered by the Union health ministry is in place, checking of water quality by health inspectors will become mandatory. As a result, bottlers as well as sellers would be held responsible for any impurities or contaminants.

 The Bureau of Indian Standards had already formulated regulations for water quality but these were meant for bottlers or suppliers of water.

 The prescribed standards were in three categories: packaged drinking water that involved processing treatments like ozonisation; packaged natural mineral water that did not involve any treatment and was bottled in its natural state, and municipal water.

 The CSE survey had found pesticide levels in bottled water to be higher than those prescribed by the European Union and, in some cases, above the World Health Organisation limits.

 In Delhi alone, pesticide levels in most bottled water were as high as 36 times the permissible limit. 

 The pesticides included DDT, malathion and organochlorines.

 The manufacturers and bottlers, however, cited WHO standards ? less stringent than those of the EU ? to escape scrutiny.

 The proposed amendment also implies the establishment of a food safety commissioner at the Centre to check and monitor the level of impurities in packaged water.

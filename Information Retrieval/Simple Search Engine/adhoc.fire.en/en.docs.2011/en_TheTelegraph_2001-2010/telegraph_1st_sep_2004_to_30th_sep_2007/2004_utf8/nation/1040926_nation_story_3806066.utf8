 Scientist held for selling data

 Lucknow (PTI): A senior scientist of the Uttar Pradesh Remote Sensing Application Centre was arrested on charges of selling important data and satellite pictures to a private firm, a senior official said here on Saturday.

 Alok Saini, who has been placed under suspension after his arrest last night, was charged with selling the data to a city-based firm for Rs 2.5 lakh, Uttar Pradesh science and technology department secretary Navneet Sehgal said. 

 Saini?s wife, who acted as a mediator in the deal, was also arrested, police sources said.

 The data was allegedly sold to the firm, which was engaged by the Lucknow Electricity Supply Agency for collecting details to identify cases of power theft in the trans-Gomti area of the city, Sehgal said.

 The secretary said the data collected by the centre was used by different departments for planning and other purposes and was kept secret. Selling it to a private firm was an offence, he added.

 Film festival entries declared

 New Delhi (PTI): India?s entry for the Oscars, Shwaas, and Rituparno Ghosh?s Chokher Bali, were named on Saturday for the Indian Panorama section of the 35th International Film Festival of India even as uncertainty prevailed over the event?s date and venue.

 The jury, which submitted its recommendations to information and broadcasting minister S. Jaipal Reddy, selected 21 films for the feature section and 19 in the non-feature film segment. Sandeep Sawant?s Marathi film Shwaas, which is India?s entry for the Oscars this year, will represent the country in the Asian competition section along with Anjan Dutt?s English movie Bow Barracks Forever.

 The government is yet to make an official announcement for this year?s edition of the film festival, even as Goa ? decided as the permanent venue at last year?s festival ? is most certainly to host it in November.

 here are six Hindi movies among those selected for the feature section by the jury headed by Shaji . Karun, the renowned filmmaker from Kerala. Others finding places are the critically acclaimed Chameli, Vishal Bharadwaj?s Maqbool and M.F. Hussain?s Meenaxi: Tale of 3 cities.

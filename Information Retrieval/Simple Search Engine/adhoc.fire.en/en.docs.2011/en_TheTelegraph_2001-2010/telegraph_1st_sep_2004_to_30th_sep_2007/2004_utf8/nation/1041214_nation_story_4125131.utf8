 SC blow to Bengal medical quota bloc

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, Dec. 13: The Supreme Court today ordered the West Bengal government immediately to cancel the admission of 69 students, given seats under the non-resident Indian (NRI) quota in the MBBS course at the SSKM and Midnapore medical colleges.

 The students will have to be replaced by candidates on the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) 2003 merit list within five days. The court also slapped contempt notices on four senior government officers for flouting an earlier order.

 ?The bottom 69 of the NRI students should get out forthwith? and the top 30, 15 in each college, can continue,? the order states. 

 Mum was the word for chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, when confronted with the apex court verdict. Just weeks ago, he had declared that nothing could stop the NRI students from continuing the course. ?I have spoken to the chief secretary on this score, but I am not aware of the details,? was all he said.

 Today, a division bench of Justice Y.K. Sabharwal and P.P. Naolekar slapped a contempt petition on chief secretary Ashok Gupta, principal secretary (health) Kalyan Bagchi, director of medical education C.R. Maiti and selection committee chairperson Jayshree Mitra for not adhering to the apex court?s earlier order. They have been asked to reply to the contempt proceedings before the court resumes hearing of the case in January.

 The order had specified that only 15 per cent seats in each of the two colleges could be reserved for students under the NRI quota. The rest would have to be filled by students on the JEE merit list. 

 However, with the government deciding to ignore the order, aspiring candidates filed a contempt petition before the Supreme Court a few weeks ago, seeking its immediate intervention. The apex court sent notices to the three senior state government officers to appear in person in court on Monday, an order they complied with. 

 The division bench came down on the government for not following its earlier directive and asked Dipankar Gupta, the government?s counsel, to explain why the ?state government behaved in such a manner.? 

 Gupta said the government could not implement the order owing to technical reasons. The bench shot back to ask the government to submit a written affidavit in this regard. 

 Medical students under the NRI quota said they will meet government officials before taking a fresh decision.

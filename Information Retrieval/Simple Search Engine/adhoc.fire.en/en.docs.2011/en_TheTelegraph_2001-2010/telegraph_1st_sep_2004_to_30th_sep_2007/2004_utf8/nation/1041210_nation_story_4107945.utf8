 Election bell rings

 ASHISH SINHA

 Patna, Dec. 9: The Election Commission today formally announced that Bihar is in poll mode and the big difference this time would be that each of the 243 Assembly constituencies will have a non-Bihar cadre official as observer.

 The non-Bihar cadre officers would be in addition to the two special observers for the state and expenditure observers for the districts.

 Election commissioner B.B. Tandon refrained from making any suggestion on the date of the poll or the number of phases in which it would be conducted. However, he said the election would be held in late February or early March since the Assembly?s term expires on March 6.

 A poll panel team returned to Delhi today after the first review of the necessary aspects and another full panel review is expected before the election.

 ?The EC is open to all three options of conducting the election in one, two or three phases. But while deciding the mode, we will consider the inputs we have received from the political parties,? Tandon said.

 ?A special summary revision of the electoral rolls has been undertaken and all those who have attained the age of 18 till January 1, 2004, will be enlisted as voters. Under all circumstances, we want the finals rolls to be published by January 3 next year, which will be displayed at all necessary locations, including post offices, for the convenience of the voters,? Tandon said.

 Proof of identity will be mandatory before one gets to exercise his/her franchise but the absence of voters? identity cards, Tandon stressed, will not be a handicap. ?Alternative documents can be used as proof of identity but in case someone does not have a document, the local representatives will issue the necessary certificate in this regard,? he added.

 Every district will have a special centre where voters can apply for their cards. They can also get their names included or make other modifications on the rolls after January 3 till the last date of filing of nominations.

 The panel received specific complaints against blacklisted or ?tainted? officers who have been found guilty of misconduct during the elections and ordered that they should not, in any manner, be associated with poll duty. The government has already started large-scale transfers of officials.

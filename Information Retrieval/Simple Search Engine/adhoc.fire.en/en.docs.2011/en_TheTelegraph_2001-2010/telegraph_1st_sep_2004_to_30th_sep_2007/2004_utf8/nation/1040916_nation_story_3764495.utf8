 Laloo bail in gunsight

 Laloo Prasad: Fodder cloud

 New Delhi, Sept. 15: The fodder scam came back to haunt Laloo Prasad Yadav today as the Supreme Court ordered that an ?appropriate bench? would hear arguments on cancellation of the bail granted to the railway minister. 

 Petitioner Rajiv Ranjan Singh ?Lalan?, a Janata Dal (United) MP, has contended that Laloo Prasad?s bail should be cancelled in view of ?new grounds?, like the change of a public prosecutor and also an income-tax official handling the fodder scam cases. 

 A bench of Chief Justice R.C. Lahoti and Justices G.P. Mathur and P.K. Balasubramanyan said the bench ?monitoring? the fodder scam-related cases would hear the matter. 

 The petition pointed out that R.K. Tyagi, a member (judicial) of the income-tax appellate tribunal who was hearing the tax cases against the minister and his chief minister wife Rabri Devi, was ?curiously? sent on deputation and replaced by P. Mohanan on July 2.

 Mohanan ?was on the verge of his retirement? and after he was made head of the tribunal ?this person (Mohanan) picked up only two cases pertaining to respondents 4 and 5 (Rabri and Laloo Prasad), even though the matter had been heard by another bench?, the petition said. ?Within two weeks, the matter was heard and allowed in favour of the assesses (that is Rabri and Laloo Prasad) and no appeal has been filed against the order,? Rajiv Ranjan?s petition said. 

 The official?s decision in favour of the minister and his wife would have ?significant impact on the cases relating to the disproportionate assets held by the accused respondents?, the Dal (U) MP said. 

 In another instance, the petition said, a public prosecutor conducting all the cases in the animal husbandry scam and withstanding ?pressures of all kinds from the accused? was replaced on July 27 by Om Shankar Singh, a retired deputy superintendent of Delhi police ?who has commenced law practice recently?. 

 By an administrative order, Om Shankar Singh has been appointed to look after the CBI animal husbandry cases in Jharkhand and Bihar and ?by a subsequent order, he has been given charge of special case No. 5/1998 (relating to the railway minister and his wife) also?, the petition said. 

 The Union of India, the respondent number 1 in the case, was acting ?arbitrarily and interfering in the judicial process to benefit respondent numbers 4 and 5 ?only because they are holding positions of eminence and authority?, it said.

 Senior counsel Mukul Rohtagi, who appeared for Rajiv Ranjan, said the ?change of public prosecutors, replacement of the income-tax tribunal member with another to have the case decided in favour of the Yadavs? were the ?new grounds? warranting cancellation of bail.

 Earlier, a bench headed by Justice K.T. Thomas was ?monitoring? the scam cases. Now it is presided over by Justice S.. Variava.

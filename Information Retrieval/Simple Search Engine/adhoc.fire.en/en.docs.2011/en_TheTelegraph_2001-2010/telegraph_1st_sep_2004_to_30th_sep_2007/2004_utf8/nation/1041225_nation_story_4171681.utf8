 Cash amp; phone catch in raid

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Dec. 24: The ?prison privilege? chapter was reopened today after police recovered a number of expensive items and cash from the possession of inmates at the Purnea district jail.

 The morning raid yielded five cell phones, three television sets with cable connection, narcotics and cash worth Rs 70,000.

 The team, led by district magistrate Pankaj Kumar and superintendent of police Sudhansu Kumar, seized mobile phones from dreaded criminals Naveen Yadav and Nandu Yadav, as well as from North Bihar Liberation Army chief Shankar Singh and his associate Banti Singh. 

 A big chunk of the cash was seized from Shankar Singh alone. Police have disconnected the three cable connections. 

 The district authorities called it a ?routine raid? on the instructions of the government, which has asked the police to regularly conduct such raids.

 According to sources, the district administration suspect that the jail authorities has helped the inmates get access to mobile phones and other prohibited items.

 ?We will soon go through the call lists and interrogate the mobile operators. Besides, we will also look into the allegation of threat calls being made to a local doctor, .P. Saha, from the jail for money,? Sudhansu Kumar said.

 In Patna, state inspector-general (prisons) Deepak Kumar Singh said he was yet to get the final report. He held a meeting later in the evening with Bihar jail minister Raghavendra Pratap Singh. The outcome of the meeting is not yet known.

 However, sources said, the administration might shift a few inmates of the Purnea jail to some other prison.

 On December 8, Patna High Court had instructed the government to conduct raids on all 55 jails in Bihar. The raid conducted by Bihar Military Police personnel yielded, among other items, a mobile phone used by Beur Central Jail inmate and Madhepura MP Pappu Yadav. 

 The RJD leader is lodged in the Beur jail for his alleged involvement in the murder of CPM legislator Ajit Sarkar. 

 The court, hearing a PIL filed by the Indian Medical Association, has repeatedly asked the state police to take prompt action to check crime.

 Cloud on Teesta talks

 SUJAN DUTTA

 New Delhi, Sept. 10: The Bengal government?s reservations about the sharing of Teesta waters with Bangladesh will hang heavy over secretary-level talks next week on the river that flows through north Bengal.

 An 11-member team, led by Union water resources secretary V.K. Duggal, is to visit Dhaka from Monday for the seventh meeting of the joint committee of experts on the sharing of the waters of the Teesta and six others ? the Manu, Khowai, Gomti, Mukuri, Dharla and the Dudhkumar ? in eastern and northeastern India that flow into Bangladesh.

 The committee has two points on its agenda: to finalise the terms of reference for a joint study on the availability of water in the Teesta and the requirement in both India and Bangladesh; and examine Dhaka?s request for an interim sharing agreement pending the results of the joint study. The study is estimated to take five years.

 The Bengal government?s nominees are members of a joint technical group constituted under the joint committee of experts. The technical group has made visits to the site and has held two meetings so far and given its report. Details of the report are not being made public with the talks due next week. 

 The central government is understood to have agreed ?in principle? to an interim arrangement but the Bengal government has reportedly argued that there isn?t enough water in the Teesta in the lean season. There are two barrages on the Teesta ? at Gajoldoba in north Bengal and at Doani in Bangladesh. A decision is unlikely to be taken without the concurrence of the Bengal government.

 Significantly, Union water resources minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi has been also elected from north Bengal.

 The technical group is understood to have marked the issues of agreement and disagreement.

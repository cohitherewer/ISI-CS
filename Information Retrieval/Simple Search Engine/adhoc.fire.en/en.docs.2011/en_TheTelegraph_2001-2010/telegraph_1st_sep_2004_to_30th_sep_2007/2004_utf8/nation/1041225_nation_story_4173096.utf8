 Mercury plunges in north, 11 die

 New Delhi (PTI): Cold wave conditions 

 have intensified across northern India, killing 11 people 

 in Uttar Pradesh since Thursday.

 The mercury plunged, freezing lakes and rivers in the higher ranges of Himachal Pradesh and triggering icy winds in other parts of the region.

 Dense fog continued to envelop large areas of Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Delhi, disrupting vehicular traffic, movement of trains and flights and throwing normal life out of gear.

 Three persons each died in Ballia and Mau while one each died in Jaunpur, Basti, Bhadohi, Azamgarh and Kushinagar because of cold, official sources said.

 Bareily, recording 7 degrees celsius, was the coldest place in Uttar Pradesh while Lucknow shivered at 8 degrees, the Met office said. The snow and rain forecast in the hills of adjacent Uttaranchal could aggravate the cold conditions.

 A cold wave swept most parts of Himachal Pradesh as the higher hills and high mountain passes had intermittent snow and night temperatures hovered around the freezing point in the mid- and high hills.

 594 doctors? jobs scrapped

 Jammu (PTI): Jammu and Kashmir High Court 

 on Thursday quashed the selection of 594 assistant surgeons 

 by the state public service commission and also directed 

 the commission to conduct fresh interviews of the candidates.

 The judge further directed the commission to issue a notification inviting applications against 164 vacancies referred to the commission by the health and medical education department.

 The appointments were challenged by nearly 200 candidates who failed to clear the selection process on the ground that the criteria adopted by the government for the selection was arbitrary. The petitioners had submitted that only 40 marks were reserved for academic qualifications whereas 100 marks were set for the viva voce.

 The judge observed that the commission was aware that the criteria envisaged was not in accordance with the law and reservation of 100 marks for viva voce against 40 for other criteria was in violation of Supreme Court judgments.

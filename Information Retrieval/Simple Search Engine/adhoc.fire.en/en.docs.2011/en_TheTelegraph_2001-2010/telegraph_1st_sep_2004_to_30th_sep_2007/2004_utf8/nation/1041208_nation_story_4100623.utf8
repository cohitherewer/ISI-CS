 Uma alone at home a year after poll win

 Bhopal, Dec. 7: The BJP today marked a year in power in Madhya Pradesh by announcing more power cuts, but it was the architect of that victory who must have realised more than anyone else what loss of power could mean.

 Uma Bharti, who resigned as chief minister three months ago in the wake of an arrest warrant in a riot case, passed through the state capital yesterday almost unnoticed.

 The sadhvi was on her way to Chennai to meet Kanchi acharya Jayendra Saraswati, now embroiled in a murder case. When the 2622 Tamil Nadu Express stopped at Bhopal, only a few ? including Bhagwan Das Sabnani who recently lost the race for mayor ? were there to greet her. 

 Uma was not impressed and urged the BJP workers to go back.

 She had reasons to be upset. The sight of only a handful professing loyalty in her home state signalled dwindling support base. Uma loyalists, however, gave a different spin, saying the former chief minister, suspended after a public spat with BJP chief L.K. Advani, did not want to ?expose? her supporters to disciplinary action.

 Exactly a year ago, Uma was the darling of the masses, the party cadre and the BJP high command. Her swearing-in on December 8, 2003, was a spectacular show where top BJP and Vishwa Hindu Parishad leaders had queued up to ?bless? her. Madhya Pradesh was dubbed a ?model state? and Uma a ?model leader?.

 If Uma felt the pinch of reality, local BJP leaders saw an element of irony in the government?s announcement of two to eight hours of power cuts a day throughout the state. 

 After all, the BJP had been voted to power on the plank of ?bijli, sadak, paani? (electricity, roads and water). When Digvijay Singh was in power, Uma and the BJP had targeted the Congress regime for failing to provide these basic amenities.

 Now the BJP government is under attack from within. Yesterday, at a meeting of state party MPs, Betul?s Vijay Khandelwal criticised chief minister Babulal Gaur, who succeeded Uma, for his failure to improve roads. Another MP, former Union minister Sumitra Mahajan, even threatened to launch a public agitation against power cuts.

 Party leaders fear that long power cuts in rural areas would make them unpopular, particularly at a time when the farming season is round the corner. In the past one year, the BJP has won over 75 per cent seats in every election in the state ? the December 2003 Assembly polls, May 2004 general elections and the recent civic polls ? and party leaders are wary of any move that could have an adverse impact.

 Seer visit

 ?None is above law. Whatever the misfortune I am suffering, I am okay,? Jayendra Saraswati was quoted as saying by Uma Bharti who met him in Vellore jail today.

 Uma said the seer?s health was good and he was getting good care in the jail. ?The arrest of a person of his stature tells something bad,? she said after visiting him. 

 The leader said god might be ?testing him and I feel that the arrest will create a shadow of curse on the country as well as the UPA government?.

 Zahira kin recalls trial horror

 Mumbai (PTI): Nafitullah Sheikh, brother 

 of Zahira Sheikh, told a Gujarat police team on Tuesday 

 that he and his family were regularly visited since a month 

 before the Best Bakery trial began by people who said accused 

 were close to the local MLA and that nothing would happen 

 to them.

 ?All the persons arrested as accused in the Best Bakery massacre whom you all have named are MLA Madhu Shrivastava?s and Bhattu?s (Chandrakant Shrivastava) men. Nothing will happen to them. The government is theirs, the police are theirs. You all will be killed. There will be no one left to give evidence,? Nafitullah told the police, narrating the threats.

 The Gujarat police team arrived here on Tuesday to record the statement of the key witness in the Best Bakery case, Zahira Sheikh, and his family in a suit on alleged threats to them by Madhu Shrivastava.

 ?The duo of Rehemtullah and Lal Mohammad (Shrivastava?s men) took me to a place near Alpana Talkies on the pretext of showing me some scrap,? Nafitullah said. He, instead, was taken to a hotel owned by Bhattu. Both Madhu and Bhattu were sitting there with their henchmen and warned him against giving evidence. Otherwise, he and his family would be killed, Nafitullah was told.

 A mob had killed 14 people in Best Bakery on the outskirts of Vadodara on March 1, 2002. The accused were acquitted by a fast-track court in Gujarat after Zahira withdrew her statement. But the apex court has ordered a fresh trial in Maharashtra which is expected to begin on Wednesday.

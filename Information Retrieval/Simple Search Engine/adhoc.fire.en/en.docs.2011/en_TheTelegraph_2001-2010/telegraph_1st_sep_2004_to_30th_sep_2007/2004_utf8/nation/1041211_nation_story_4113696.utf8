 Strike for pay justice

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Dec. 10: More than 10,000 employees of Bihar secretariats began their indefinite strike today to draw the Rabri Devi government?s attention to their problems.

 The employees also demonstrated against the government?s ?continuous neglect? of their interests.

 The strike has been called by the Bihar Rajya Sarkari-Ardh Sarkari Sevakarmi Samyukth Morcha, Bihar Sachivalaya Seva Sangh and Bihar Rajya Arajpatrit Karamchari Mahasangh.

 Supported by various trade unions and primary teachers, the associations have placed a seven-point charter of demands before the government. These include raising the retirement age from 58 to 60, merger of 50 per cent of dearness allowance with basic salary, end of retrenchment, implementation of the recommendations of the Aftab Committee and regularisation of services of daily-wage earners.

 While a section of employees loyal to the Sachivalaya Samyuktha Sangharsh Morcha stayed away from the strike, about 75,000 Grade IV workers threatened to join it.

 R.N. Thakur, secretary of the All-India Central Council of Trade Unions, said: ?Non-gazetted employees of the Bihar government do not enjoy the facilities their central counterparts do. Anomalies could be found everywhere.? 

 ?Promotions have stopped and salary revision is improper. Besides, recruitment has stopped in the technical departments,? he added. 

 After meeting chief secretary K.A.H. Subramanyam on Wednesday, leaders of the three striking associations said the government was not willing to meet their demands. With the government not calling for talks yesterday, the associations took out a torchlight procession and announced that they would begin their strike today.

 Subramanyam said the government is open to talks to settle the matter. ?The government wants to discuss the matter with the employees. But they seem to be more interested in paralysing the state machinery,? a senior official said. 

 In another development, Patna Municipal Corporation employees decided to intensify their strike today.

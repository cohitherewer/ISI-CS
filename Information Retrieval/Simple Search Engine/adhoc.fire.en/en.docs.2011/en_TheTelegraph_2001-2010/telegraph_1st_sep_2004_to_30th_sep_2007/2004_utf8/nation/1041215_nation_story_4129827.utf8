 Two Kashmirs, one language

 New Delhi, Dec. 14: Leaders from the two Kashmirs, who came face to face in Kathmandu three days ago to kickstart an intra-Kashmir dialogue, have called for triangular talks that will involve the Kashmiris at some stage in the Indo-Pak peace process.

 A consensus statement ?issued after the three-day meeting of the Kashmiri leaders, intellectuals and former bureaucrats as part of Track-II diplomacy ? said the process of peace should be carried forward to seek an honourable and feasible solution to the Kashmir problem in a peaceful way. 

 The leaders also called for an end to violence in the Valley and hoped that a sustained dialogue between India and Pakistan would lead to resolution of all outstanding problems, including Kashmir.

 The meeting ? the first formal interaction between Kashmiri leaders from either side of the Line of Control in recent years ? was organised by US-based think-tank Pugwash Conference and is in line with the thinking in Delhi, Islamabad and Washington on the need for governments and the people to stay engaged in a continuous round of dialogue.

 It was the reflection of this informal patronage that the meet had from the governments concerned that Nepal ? which at one time had threatened to play spoilsport if its soil was used for anti-India activities ? eventually played the perfect host and allowed several separatist leaders from Jammu and Kashmir to enter the country on the basis of identity cards issued by their respective parties. Mirwaiz Umer Farooq, acting chairman of the Hurriyat Conference, was reported to have been one of them and had made it a point to leave his Indian passport back home.

 The meet, attended by nearly 45 delegates, had been split into three groups ? each tasked to deliberate threadbare on a given subject, including confidence-building measures taken by India and Pakistan and intra-Kashmir dialogue.

 Sources said a three-page report produced at the end of deliberations by the group on intra-Kashmir dialogue acknowledged that a basic assumption while talking of dialogue within Kashmiris was that there could be no lasting solution without the involvement of the people of undivided Jammu and Kashmir. This was a point that had also come up when Pakistan Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz met Kashmiri separatists during his Delhi visit. Most of his guests from Kashmir had insisted that they also had to be involved in the peace process.

 In Kathmandu, leaders from the two sides came up with a broad outline on how this could be achieved. The report suggested a step-by-step approach that begins with initiating the dialogue internally within each part of the two Kashmirs, then between the two Kashmirs and followed by Indo-Pak talks.

 In a point that emphasises some movement on the Kashmiri leaders trying to look at their situation from the same prism, the report said the ?language of our Kashmir and your Kashmir should stop. It is one?. It was also recognised that a military solution was not feasible and the situation desperately needed a political solution.

 The Mirwaiz later said there was an across-the-board recognition that the resolution of the dispute could come about if there were fresh ideas.

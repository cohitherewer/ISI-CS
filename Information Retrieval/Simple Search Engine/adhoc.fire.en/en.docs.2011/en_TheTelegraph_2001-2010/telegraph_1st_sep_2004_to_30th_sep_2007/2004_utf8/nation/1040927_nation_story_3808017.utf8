 PMO leaves bullies to god

 MAIN UDDIN CHISTI

 Cooch Behar, Sept. 26: The Prime Minister?s Office trusts its policies to address affairs of state, but would rather let god deal with school bullies.

 ??Trust in God and be positive. Every problem will sort itself out?? is how a letter written by the director of communications, PMO, to a Class VII student of St Mary?s High School reads.

 Soujanya Roy, apparently of weak health and mild mannered, had written a letter to the PMO unable to bear the bullying of his seniors in school, in the classroom and on the school bus.

 The student said in his e-mail that he was forced to write to the PMO because the principal, Sister Lily, had insulted his father and asked the watchman to drag his mother out of her office when they had gone to complain against the torture his seniors subjected him to.

 The letter, of which The Telegraph has a copy, was sent last Friday. 

 The reply from the PMO arrived the same day. ?Dear Soujanya Roy, please send the e-mail ID of the school. This is a matter of misunderstanding that has been blown up. Trust in God and be positive. Every problem will sort itself out. With best wishes, Director Communications, PMO.?

 Although brief and light in tone, the reply has instilled some hope in the boy and his parents. 

 ?We are very happy that we got such a prompt reply. We are now trying to get hold of the e-mail address of the school,? said Soujanya?s father, Sujan Roy, an auditor with Gour Gramin Bank.

 When contacted, Sister Lily refused comment: ?I will not talk to you on this issue,? she told the correspondent.

 For Soujanya, however, it has been a harrowing week. First, his father was allegedly turned out of the school on August 16 by the principal when he went to her with a written complaint about three boys who had reportedly been bullying Soujanya. 

 ?My son was so terrified that he refused to go to school. When I met the principal, she refused to take me seriously. I told her that if she did not accept my complaint, she would have to receive it through an advocate. My statement made her angry and she turned me out of the school,? the boy?s father said.

 Last Friday, when Soujanya?s mother, Rajashree Roy, went to Sister Lily with a plea that her son be allowed to appear for his final exams next month, the principal apparently grabbed her hand and summoned the watchman to escort her out of the office.

 ?I lodged an FIR with the police and also wrote to the district magistrate,? Rajashree said. ?My son has been under so much mental stress because of being constantly harassed that he is currently being treated by a child psychiatrist.?

 ?Our principal taught us about forgiveness, then why cannot she forgive my parents,? Soujanya wrote in his e-mail to the PMO.

 Asked about the incident, district magistrate Ravi Inder Singh said: ?I am yet to see the complaint. If it has been submitted to my office, I will definitely go through it.?

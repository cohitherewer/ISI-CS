 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Hyderabad, Oct. 17: The Naxalite delegation at the peace talks with the government today created a flutter by submitting a document that listed over 43 individuals and companies holding up to 2,000 acres of land each in and around Hyderabad. 

 Among the prominent names on the list are ETV owner Ramoji Rao, former chief minister . Chandrababu Naidu, industrialists G.V. Krishna Reddy of the Taj Krishna, Dr Anji Reddy of Dr Reddy?s Laboratories and Girish Sanghi of Sanghi Industries. 

 The list, handed to home minister K. Jana Reddy, who is leading the government team, came up on the third day as talks focused on land reforms. 

 Bandi Prakash, a People?s War activist, who released the list to the media, said: ?We are submitting the list to the government to disprove their contention that there was no surplus land available in the state capital for distribution to the urban poor.?

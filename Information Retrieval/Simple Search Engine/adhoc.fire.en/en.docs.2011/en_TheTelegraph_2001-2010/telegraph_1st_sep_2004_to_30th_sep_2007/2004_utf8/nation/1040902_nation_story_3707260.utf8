 CM return row

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi/Bhopal, Sept. 1: BJP chief M. Venkaiah Naidu today said Uma Bharti would not be reinstated as Madhya Pradesh chief minister if she is released from jail even as the power struggle in the partys state unit intensified.

 Six ministers in Babulal Gaurs ministry today openly sought his predecessors return.

 Naidu, who was in Bangalore to start a satyagraha with .K. Advani and other BJP leaders to protest Umas arrest, said: There is no proposal and no question of a change in leadership in MP (Madhya Pradesh). The leadership issue is settled.

 The BJP chief said the party has planned a countrywide tour for Uma on her release.

 Elsewhere, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad threw its weight behind the former chief minister for the job of BJP chief.

 VHP vice-president Acharya Giriraj Kishore, who has been associated with Uma from the time of the Ayodhya agitation and who met her in Dharwad jail two days ago, said in Delhi that she is not interested in becoming chief minister again but more inclined to work for the party organisation.

 We have no objections if she becomes the BJP president, she is committed to the Hindutva ideology, Kishore said. 

 He added that she was suited for the post as she is Hindi-speaking and a sanyasin who commanded the respect of society.

 In Bhopal, ministers Harnam Singh, Rustam Singh, Gopal Bhargava, Sunil Nayak, Om Prakash Dhurve and Dhal Singh sought Umas return. 

 They said several of their colleagues have promised to come out in the open.

 A large section of party MLAs have also begun making noises in Umas favour. They are looking to convene a BJP legislature party meeting to settle the leadership issue.

 Pro-Uma MLAs and ministers were planning to gherao the Madhya Pradesh party office but called off their plans at 3 pm when a Karnataka court deferred her release until Saturday.

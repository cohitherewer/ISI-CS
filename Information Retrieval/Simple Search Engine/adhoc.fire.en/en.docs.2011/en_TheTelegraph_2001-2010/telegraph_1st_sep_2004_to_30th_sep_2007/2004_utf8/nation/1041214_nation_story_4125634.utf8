 Residents of hills to go without ration

 VIVEK CHHETRI

 Darjeeling, Dec. 13: Hill residents will have to go without their fortnightly quota of rice and wheat as Modified Ration Distributors have decided against lifting foodgrain from Food Corporation of India (FCI) godowns from next week.

 The move comes at a time when the cash-strapped West Bengal government is finding it difficult to buy foodgrain from the FCI for residents of the hills, forcing distributors to shell out an additional amount to get the entire quota of foodgrain allotted to the hills.

 ?There are 11 distributors in Darjeeling Hills and we have paid an excess amount of Rs 2 crore, which the government has not been able to either adjust or refund. As a result, we have no other option left but to stop lifting foodgrain,? said Brij Mohan Garg, the general secretary of Darjeeling Hill MR Distributors? Association.

 The hills, which have a special status because they are a non-producing zone with more than 70 per cent of the population depending on the public distribution system, also get foodgrain at concession rates.

 While in the rest of the state, residents of Above Property Line (APL) category get rice at Rs 8.30 per kg and those in the BPL category for Rs 5.65, the people in the hills get rice at the flat rate of Rs 7. Similarly, while the APL and BPL rates for wheat are Rs 6.10 and Rs 4.15 respectively, the hill rate is Rs 5 per kg.

 According to standard practice, the government first deposits the money for the required amount of foodgrain to the FCI. The distributors then give the money to the government and lift the foodgrain from the godowns. 

 The distributors alleged that the cash-strapped government is now taking the money first from them and then depositing it with the FCI for the foodgrain.

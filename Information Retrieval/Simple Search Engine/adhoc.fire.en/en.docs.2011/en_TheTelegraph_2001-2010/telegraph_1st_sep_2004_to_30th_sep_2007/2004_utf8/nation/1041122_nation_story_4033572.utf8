 Bribery jail for judge

 New Delhi, Nov. 21 (PTI): The Supreme Court has found an Andhra Pradesh sessions judge guilty of accepting money for acquitting the accused in a criminal case. The judge has been sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for three years with fine.

 A bench of Justices B.N. Agrawal and A.K. Mathur found S. Janardhan Rao, a member of the Andhra Pradesh Higher Judicial Service and posted as a sessions judge in Hyderabad, guilty of accepting Rs 3 lakh in September 1996 for acquitting the accused in a criminal case.

 When a similar malpractice was brought to its notice, the apex court had ordered a CBI probe into the ?cash-for-warrants? scam involving a Meghani Nagar magistrate in Ahmedabad who had issued warrants against the President, the Chief Justice of India and other VIPs. 

 In the Andhra case, the trial court had convicted the judge but had acquitted his wife and son. On appeal, the high court had acquitted the judge of corruption charges.

 Justice Agrawal said: ?We find that the trial court was justified in relying upon the witnesses? evidence to prove the circumstance and the high court was wholly unjustified in doubting the veracity of their statements on the basis of minor contradictions in their evidence.?

 He said that the high court was not at all justified in making adverse remarks in its judgment against the then registrar (vigilance) of the Andhra Pradesh High Court, which were wholly uncalled for and expunged them.

 Former MLA shot dead

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Dec. 23: For the second time in four years, Pankaj Kumar Sinha (55) hogged the headlines today. 

 A terrorist group had held the former Congress MLA a hostage in Jammu amp; Kashmir four years ago. But while terrorists had then spared his life, criminals nearer home turned out to be more ruthless and shot him dead this morning, as he stepped out for a morning walk. He died on the spot.

 Sinha?s route was well-known as he generally walked towards the secretariat every morning. Today, two men riding a motorcycle shot him in his legs and the head.

 There was tension in the area, as Sinha was known as an upright person who had been vocal in opposing criminal activities around Jakkanpur. Police too suspect the involvement of local criminals. Two suspects have been taken into custody and were being interrogated, the police said.

 Barely 24 hours before the cold-blooded murder, police had raided a few houses in the locality and arrested two criminals. 

 It is possible, said neighbours, that the criminals believed that Sinha had tipped off the police and had decided to kill him to teach ?informers? a lesson.

 The widow of the deceased, Pratima Sinha, named a local ?muscleman? as a suspect. Her husband had ticked the man off on several occasions, she said, and it was possible that the man had sought to avenge the ?humiliation?. ?My husband had no enmity with anyone and was liked by the people; I cannot think of any other reason for anyone to take his life,? said the dazed lady.

 The ire of the neighbours was directed at the ?muscleman? in question, who is also a resident of Jakkanpur. The father of the local tough, they alleged, was frequently seen shouting abuses at Sinha from his rooftop.

 Sinha, who once represented the Islampur constituency in Nalanda district, had left the Congress to join the Janata Dal (United) just before the last general election. He was expected to contest the Assembly election in February next year a JD(U) candidate.

 The politician has left behind his widow, a daughter and a son. Sinha?s body was cremated after the post-mortem

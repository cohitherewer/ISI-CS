The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Left keeps Calcutta 

 OUR BUREAU 

 Calcutta, Oct. 16: The Left Front strengthened its political sway in the city by retaining all three Assembly seats which went to byelections on October 9 by greater margins. 

 The results were a setback for the principal Opposition party, the Trinamul Congress, which was relegated to a poor third in Entally and Jorabagan. It came second in Shyampukur. 

 The three seats fell vacant after front legislators Subrata Basu of the Forward Bloc, and Mohammad Selim and Sudhangshu Sil of the CPM were elected to the Lok Sabha in May. 

 The CPM?s Abu Sufian won from Entally by a record margin of 51,101 votes against his nearest Congress rival Khalid Abdullah. 

 Trinamul nominee Manzar Iqbal polled only 6883 votes. 

 At Jorabagan, Parimal Biswas, a local CPM councillor, defeated Rajesh Sinha of the Congress by 14,239 votes. Trinamul?s Sanjoy Bakshi, a Mamata loyalist, came third. 

 The Bloc?s Jiban Saha won from Shyampukur by a margin of 29,694 votes. 

 Here, Trinamul?s Madan Mitra was ahead of Congress nominee Shivaji Sinha Roy by about 5,500 votes and took the second position. 

 While state CPM secretary Anil Biswas hailed the victory of Front candidates as ?another instance of the people?s trust in us?, Trinamul spokesperson Partha Chatterjee said the result was the ?natural outcome of the largescale rigging conducted by the Marxists on the bypoll day?. 

 Mitra said a large number of genuine voters were not allowed to exercise their franchise by ?CPM goons who forcibly occupied many polling booths at Shyampukur?. 

 State Congress leaders, too, castigated the Marxists for winning the bypolls ?by unfair means?, but expressed satisfaction that its candidates came second at Entally and Jorabagan. 

 ?CPM workers did not allow the people to cast their votes in many booths. Our party?s performance would have been much better if there was a free and fair byelection,? said state Congress general secretary Manas Bhuniya. 

 The results show a steady erosion of Trinamul?s support base in the city. The party?s electioneering was hampered not only by chronic infighting, but also Mamata?s virtual absence from the poll arena. 

 Mayor Subrata Mukherjee had opposed Bakshi?s nomination at Jorabagan and refused to campaign for him. 

 Mamata, recuperating from the injuries she received when a dais she was speaking from collapsed in Midnapore on August 9, paid a whirlwind visit to the three constituencies for a few hours only a couple of days before the bypolls. She also faced criticism for nominating Mitra, a resident of south Calcutta, for Shyampukur in the north. 

 Compared to the lacklustre campaign of the Congress and Trinamul, the CPM?s rallies and door-to-door canvassing were well organised. 

 There was a dispute between the Bloc and the CPM over nominating Saha for Shyampukur, but the dispute was quickly resolved.

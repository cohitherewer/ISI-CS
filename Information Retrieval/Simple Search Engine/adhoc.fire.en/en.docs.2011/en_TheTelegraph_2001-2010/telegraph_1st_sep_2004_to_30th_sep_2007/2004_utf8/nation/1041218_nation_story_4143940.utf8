 Don notice to Centre

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 17: The Supreme Court today issued notices to the Centre on a petition by gangster Babloo Srivastava contending that trial in cases against him have not begun even after about 10 years of ?languishing in the jail?. 

 Srivastava was extradited to India from Singapore in 1995 to face trial in four cases of murder and kidnapping.

 Notices were also issued to the CBI and the governments of Maharashtra, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh.

 Srivastava?s senior counsel, R.K. Jain, requested the court to issue a directive for quick trial. ?India promised Singapore that a free and fair trial would be held when sending the extradition request. No trial has begun in three cases and the lone case in which trial has begun is also due to the order of this court.?

 Singh is Left?s model for Montek

 - Take a lesson on coalition dharma from Prime Minister, says Yechury

 New Delhi, Sept. 28: The CPM wants Planning Commission deputy chairperson Montek Singh Ahluwalia to emulate the example of coalition dharma set by the Prime Minister.

 The party is ready to certify Manmohan Singh a ?different personality? from his days as finance minister when he had ushered in liberalisation and leaned on the World Bank for financial support.

 ?The Prime Minister is working within the coalition parameters. Others unfortunately are not,? CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury said.

 ?There is no need for Montek Singh Ahluwalia to be tuned to the Left but he must take into account different points of view,? he added.

 Ahluwalia had ruffled the Left with his statement that foreign advisers would continue on consultative committees of the plan panel, a day after the Prime Minister assured a high-level CPM delegation of taking the party?s views into consideration.

 Yechury blamed Ahluwalia for ?blowing the issue out of proportion?. ?For once, I am not blaming the media. The Prime Minister had assured that he would take the Left?s sensibilities into consideration. Then, Montek made this statement and stirred a hornet?s nest,? he said.

 In response to Ahluwalia?s statement, five Left economists who are members of the Planning Commission?s consultative bodies had threatened to resign unless the foreign experts quit the panel.

 The Left parties would now like the stand-off to end without further escalation of the controversy. 

 For this, they are relying on the Prime Minister to strike the right balance between them and Ahluwalia. Singh would like to keep both on the right side.

 Also, the Left ? at least for the time being ? would not like to pick a quarrel with the Prime Minister. The CPM believes Singh, who between 1991 and 1995 tried to push through unbridled liberalisation, including an easy policy of hire and fire, has since undergone a change of perception.

 He is now emphasising reforms with a human face, a slogan the Left endorses. 

 ?Manmohan Singh as finance minister and Manmohan Singh as Prime Minister are two different personalities,? Yechury said.

 For his part, the Prime Minister has made all the right gestures towards the Left, his most crucial ally. Yesterday, he said he agreed with their concerns and was confident of being able to work with them.

 Ahluwalia, however, has not sent out any conciliatory message. After a meeting of the plan panel today, the deputy chairperson said: ?We will meet the Prime Minister in a day or two and resolve the issue.?

 Yechury defended the Left, saying that it did not raise the contentious issues on its own but only made its stand clear when the government made unilateral policy decisions.

 ?All the issues of dispute are issues where the government has taken unilateral decisions, like on FDI, EPF. The Left has not raised a single issue on its own,? he said.

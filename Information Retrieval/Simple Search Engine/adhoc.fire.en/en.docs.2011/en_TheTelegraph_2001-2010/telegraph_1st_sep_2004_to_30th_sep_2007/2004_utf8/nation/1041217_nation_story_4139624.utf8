 Seer files second bail plea in SC

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 Jayendra Saraswati

 New Delhi, Dec. 16: Kanchi seer Jayendra Saraswati today moved another bail application in the Supreme Court in the Radhakrishnan assault case.

 A former Kanchi associate, Radhakrishnan was allegedly attacked by goons at the seer?s behest in 2002. Last week, a Chennai trial court had declined him bail in the case.

 The acharya has also moved a bail petition in the Shankar Raman murder case.

 ?Since in both the cases (the) same question of law relating to bail has arisen, both the petitions are tagged and being heard together on Friday,? said M.N. Krishnamani, the authorised senior counsel of the mutt.

 The sessions court had said there is a prima facie case against the seer. Besides, the rationale fixed in the Pappu Yadav case is that unless the high court or the trial court has materials to believe the accused is innocent, it should not grant bail.

 The acharya?s petition argued that this ratio was based only on the merits and demerits of the case allegedly involving the Rashtriya Janata Dal MP and could not applied as a universal ratio.

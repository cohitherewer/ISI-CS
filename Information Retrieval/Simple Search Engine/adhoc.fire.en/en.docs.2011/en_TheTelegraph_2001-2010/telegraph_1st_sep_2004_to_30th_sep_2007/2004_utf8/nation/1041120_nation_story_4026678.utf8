 Modi revives two-child plan

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 19: The Gujarat government will bring a bill in the next session of the Assembly to prohibit elected representatives from having more than two children.

 Chief minister Narendra Modi said at a news conference here today that the bill was part of his governments ?packaged? approach to control population and had nothing to do with minorities.

 If the bill becomes an act, it will cover all elected representatives in the state from the panchayat to Parliament. Any person who has a third child while holding any public office will have to resign immediately.

 Modi said: ?The issue of population control will have to be viewed from a different perspective because if the fruits of development have to reach the lowest levels, population growth will have to be contained.?

 The Gujarat government had set up a population control commission under Modi to propose incentives and disincentives against having large families. The chief minister said the proposals were implemented in parts.

 However, Modi clarified that the legislation will come into being with prospective and not retrospective effect. When the idea was mooted, there were protests from Modis council of ministers because 11 of them had more than two children. Modi?s bugbear, Keshubhai Patel, had then calculated that the bill might become a rallying point for the dissenters.

 Modi had also made out as though it would apply only to Muslims. His notorious comment, ?Hum paanch, hamare pachees (We are five, we produce 25)? was meant to reinforce the stereotype of polygamous Muslims having many children and provoked an outcry from non-BJP parties and activists.

 The BJP then repackaged the idea and made development, rather than religion, the underpinning idea so that it was accepted by the ?secular? constituents of the National Democratic Alliance. 

 L.K. Advani, during his tenure as the deputy Prime Minister, had said at a rally in Chhattisgarh on April 11: ?It is not a question of majority and minority. If it is an educated family, it will adopt the two-child norm, irrespective of its religious beliefs.?

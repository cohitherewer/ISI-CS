 Wild West heist

 Raipur, Sept. 14 (PTI): 

 Armed robbers today looted about Rs 5 crore from the main 

 branch of the State Bank of Indore in the heart of the city 

 after taking 45 people, including employees and customers, 

 hostage.

 ?At gunpoint, about six to seven robbers took away money from the strong room where there was a cash balance of about Rs 10 crore,? said branch manager Chandrakant Pathak, who arrived around 11 am after the goons had left.

 The branch, about 100 metres from Mohdapara police station, had not taken account of the balance left and hence it was difficult to tell the exact amount looted, but it could be less than Rs 5 crore, he added.

 Before leaving, the robbers pushed the bank staff and customers into the strong room and left after locking its grill and the gate, senior superintendent of police Ashok Juneja said.

 Bank attender Bharat Lal Dhiwar and a customer said the robbers told them they would not harm the people or take their money. ?We are forced to indulge in this since the government has failed to give us a job,? one of them told the duo.

 ?They were courteous and during their stay from 9.45 to 10.45, were very calm,? said Sulochana Suraj, the last employee to enter the bank.

 There is no clue to which way the robbers went. They are yet to be identified but, based on their accent, could be from Bihar or Bengal, the police officer said.

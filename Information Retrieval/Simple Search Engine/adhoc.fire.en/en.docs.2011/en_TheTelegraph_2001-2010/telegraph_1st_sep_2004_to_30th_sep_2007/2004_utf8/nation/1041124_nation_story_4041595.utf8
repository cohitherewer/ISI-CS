 Pawar plots ginger group 

 KAY BENEDICT 

 New Delhi, Nov. 23: Miffed with the Congress for short-changing him after the Maharashtra elections, Sharad Pawar is trying to mould a pressure group within the Sonia Gandhi-led United Progressive Alliance to rein in her party and force her to take the non-Left partners more seriously. 

 The Left bloc is a key backer of the alliance and makes itself heard through the Left-UPA coordination committee. 

 Pawar is working to bring together the non-Left UPA constituents who account for 80 MPs, more than the Left. 

 Last week, he sounded out telecom minister Dayanidhi Maran from the DMK, Telengana Rashtra Samiti chief K. Chandrashekhar Rao, who is languishing as a cabinet minister without portfolio, and Jharkhand Mukti Morcha boss Shibu Soren, awaiting reinduction into the Manmohan Singh government, on the need for a pressure group. 

 The Nationalist Congress Party chief has also held talks with Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav for coordination inside Parliament. 

 A senior NCP leader close to Pawar said: ?There are 80 non-Left UPA members in the Lok Sabha. If the 40 MPs of Mulayam Singh and Ajit Singh coordinate with us, we will be a formidable force and the Congress can?t ignore us.?

 NCP spokesperson D.P. Tripathi today demanded a coordination committee meeting of the alliance partners once a month and said the proposed group would seek Left support. Asking the Congress not to treat the UPA as its ?fief?, he said ?the Congress should realise that it is not a one- party government, but UPA government?.

 As Tripathi expressed his party?s unhappiness with the UPA, senior Congress leader Digvijay Singh called on Rao. Sources close to Rao said he might have been sounded out on a ?good? portfolio. It is being speculated that he may be given the coal and mines ministry vacated by Soren. 

 As for the JMM leader, the source said the Prime Minister might induct him after the winter session of Parliament, in time for the Jharkhand polls.

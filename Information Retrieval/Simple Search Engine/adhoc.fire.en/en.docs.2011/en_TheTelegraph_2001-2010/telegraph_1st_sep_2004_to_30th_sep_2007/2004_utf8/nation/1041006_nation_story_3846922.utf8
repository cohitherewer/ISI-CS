 Turkey team for trade talks

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 5: High on the upswing in bilateral relations, India and Turkey will hold discussions on ways to deepen economic cooperation.

 Officials of the two sides, along with representatives of the private sector, will participate in the two-day talks ? beginning in Delhi tomorrow ? of the working group of economic ministries. 

 Identifying economic ties as the linchpin of bilateral relations, former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had mooted the proposal for setting up the working group during his visit to Ankara in September last year.

 Trade between the two countries has shown a significant growth in the past three years. From $427 million in 2001, it touched the $1-billion mark this year. But both countries agree that the figure could be higher.

 In the next two days, members of the working group will try to find fresh items to fill up their trade basket and also newer areas for economic cooperation that might include investment in each other?s country and also joint ventures in a third one.

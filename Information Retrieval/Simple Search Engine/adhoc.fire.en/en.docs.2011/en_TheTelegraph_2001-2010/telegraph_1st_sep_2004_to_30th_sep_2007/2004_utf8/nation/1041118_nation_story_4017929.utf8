 SC glare on Raja Bhaiyya reprieve

 New Delhi: The Supreme Court has issued 

 notices to cabinet minister Raghuraj Pratap Singh alias 

 Raja Bhaiyya and the Uttar Pradesh government, asking them 

 to explain why the Prevention of Terrorism Act should be 

 withdrawn against him, reports our legal correspondent.

 Acting on a petition filed by S.K. Shukla, a division bench of Justices B.N. Agrawal and P.K. Balasubramanyan also issued notices to Raja Bhaiyya?s father Uday Pratap Singh and cousin Akshay Pratap Singh. 

 The Mayavati government had begun prosecution under the anti-terror act against Raja Bhaiyya, his father and cousin for unleashing terror in the state. 

 But the charges were withdrawn soon after Mulayam Singh Yadav became chief minister. He even made Raja Bhaiyya a cabinet-rank minister. 

 Shukla contended that the state had no right to withdraw the charges without consulting the Centre as the act had been passed by the Union government in Parliament.

 Kalyan before Babri panel

 New Delhi (PTI): Former Uttar Pradesh 

 chief minister Kalyan Singh has said he would make a statement 

 before the Liberhan Commission, which is probing the demolition 

 of the Babri Masjid 12 years ago.

 ?It is definite I will appear before the commission and give (a) statement on December 2,? the BJP leader, during whose rule the mosque was razed, told reporters after appearing before the commission on Wednesday.

 ?I will leave all my work and go through the records as statements have been made on different occasions relating to (the) demolition in the past 12 years.?

 The commission, headed by Justice M.S. Liberhan, had directed Singh to appear before it after Delhi High Court dismissed his writ petition that he should not be forced to give a statement.

 The commission adjourned the hearing to December 2 and 3 after Singh?s counsel made a request that he was not well for the last few days and needed some more days to go through the records of the incident, particularly those that concerned the former chief minister. 

 Bandit spy in suicide bid

 Chennai (PTI): A woman who is said to 

 have played an important role in helping the Tamil Nadu

 on Wednesday arrested Tirlochan Singh, the food and supplies

 issue a fresh ration card. 

 Mystery virus

 Ghaziabad (PTI): Thirty-seven 37 children

 two days in western Uttar Pradesh, taking the toll to 177.

 its nature.

 Abattoir shift

 New Delhi (PTI): The Centre and the Delhi 

 government have told the Supreme Court that moving an abattoir 

 from Idgah to Ghazipur in east Delhi would not pose a security 

 threat to the nearby airbase. The governments and the air 

 force had earlier opposed the shift, earning the ire of 

 the apex court judges. 

 Stick for ADC

 Hyderabad (PTI): The Maharashtra government 

 has recommended suspension of Deepak Pandey, the ADC to 

 the governor, for ?harassing? a traffic constable. An inquiry 

 has found him guilty, deputy chief minister R.R. Patil said.

 his IAS officer wife Nidhi for dowry demands, is on leave.

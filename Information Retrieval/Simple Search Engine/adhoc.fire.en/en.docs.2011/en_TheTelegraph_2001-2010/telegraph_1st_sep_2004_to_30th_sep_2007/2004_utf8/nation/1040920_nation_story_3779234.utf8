 Joshi jab at ?archaic? Left

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Sept. 19: Murli Manohar Joshi, who is leading the BJP?s ?save education? campaign, today lashed out at pro-Left historians like Romila Thapar and R.S. Sharma and called them ?archaic?.

 ?They are archaic historians who need to brush up their history in the light of new research. The history books written by them should not be prescribed in schools. As far as the BJP-ruled states are concerned, their books will definitely not form part of the school curriculum,? the former human resource development minister said.

 The senior BJP leader, a former teacher of physics at Allahabad University, said new research has demolished several stereotypes of history conceived by the British and propagated by post-Independence Left-oriented scholars.

 ?It is unfortunate that the ideological myths postulated by these historians are seeping into the curriculum. These myths portray wrong facts and end up presenting a history that is factually incorrect. Our campaign aims at exposing these falsehoods with an appeal for correctives. These canards amount to the rape of our education and history,? he added.

 ?The new HRD minister (Arjun Singh) believes that our nation should not be referred to as matrabhoomi. He should explain how then should our motherland be addressed. The revolutionaries of our freedom movement are being referred to as terrorists. This is most unfortunate and amounts to putting on British glasses for understanding Indian history,? Joshi said.

 The BJP leader said he would leave for the Andamans to take the BJP?s fight on the Savarkar issue to its conclusion.

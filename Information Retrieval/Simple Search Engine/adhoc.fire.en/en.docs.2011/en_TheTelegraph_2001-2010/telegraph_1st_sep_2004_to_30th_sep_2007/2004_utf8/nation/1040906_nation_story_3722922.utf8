 Arms haul sparks strike alert

 Chandigarh: Gurdaspur police have arrested five persons and seized a huge cache of arms and ammunition, including an underwater mask, raising fears that rebels had worked out a different ploy to sneak into the country, reports our correspondent.

 Preliminary interrogation of the arrested, including two Pakistani nationals, has revealed an ISI-backed attempt to revive militancy in the state by way of initiating major terrorist action through bomb blasts and shootouts, Gurdaspurs senior superintendent of police, Narinder Bhargav, said over phone.

 Two AK-56 rifles, magazines, 15 kg of RDX, hand grenades, sophisticated time devices, 13 pistols and nearly 500 rounds of ammunition were seized from various places in the sensitive border district of Punjab. But it is the seizure of the underwater mask that has sent shock waves through police circles here. 

 No such mask had ever been recovered, not even when terrorism was at its peak. With the fence proving to be a big hurdle for both Khalistani and Kashmiri terrorists to infiltrate easily, the recovery of the mask points to a change in strategy. Infiltration could now be taking place through river routes, a senior officer said.

 The inspector-general of police (Jalandhar zone), S.K. Sharma, said among those arrested are Saroop Singh of the Khalistan Commando Force (Panjwar group), his brother Nirmal, and Rashpal Singh. The other two are Pakistanis who were living under the assumed names of Rattan Singh and Avtar Singh in Bajpur and Meerut, respectively, in Uttar Pradesh.

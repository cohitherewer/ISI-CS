 Lohia park 

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY 

 Lucknow, Oct. 11: Two parks in memory of two ideological icons ? one is a ?shame?, the other a ?dream project?.

 Chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav will tomorrow lay the foundation for a park named after political mentor Ram Manohar Lohia, in a project similar to rival Mayavati?s Ambedkar Park which Samajwadi leaders had slammed for frivolous extravagance.

 The Uttar Pradesh government recently released Rs 14 crore as initial allocation for what is said to be Mulayam Singh?s ?dream project?. But sources said the expenses are set to exceed the Rs 120 crore that Mayavati had allotted for the park in Lucknow?s Gomtinagar dedicated to B.R. Ambedkar, her BSP?s icon.

 Mulayam, who two years ago had called the Ambedkar Park ?ayyashi ka adda? (luxury den), has hired the same landscape architect, Shaheer, who worked on Mayavati?s project. 

 Lohia Park will be spread over 58 acres, also in Gomtinagar. A statue of Lohia, similar to that of Ambedkar?s, will be installed. A model will be displayed at the tomorrow, Lohia?s birth anniversary.

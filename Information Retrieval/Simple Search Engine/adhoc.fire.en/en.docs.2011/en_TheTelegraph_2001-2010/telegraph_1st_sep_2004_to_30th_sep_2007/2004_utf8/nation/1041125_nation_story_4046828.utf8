 Nation at a Glance

 Untouchable row over Indian

 Durban (PTI): A cashier of Indian origin 

 at a shopping centre here has been accused of ?insulting? 

 a vice-chancellor of a technical college by not putting 

 change in his hand after serving him. She placed it on the 

 counter.

 Professor Aaron Ndlovu, vice-chancellor of Mangosuthu Technikon in the township of Umlazi in Durban, alleged that he was insulted by the cashier at the Gateway shopping centre. 

 ?She did not want to touch my hand. This little Indian girl is sick,? he alleged while addressing a memorial service for a Technikon council member.

 sked why he judged all Indians on the basis of the behaviour of one girl, Ndlovu alleged: ?The manner in which the Indian cashier treated me is common behaviour by Indians.?

 The professor also claimed that the children of Indian staff at his institution did not attend his college but went to former white institutions.

 He was also reported to have said that the attitude of Indians on campus supported playwright Mbongeni Ngema?s statements on the ?attitude of Indians towards blacks?.

 Ngema, who had apologised for writing an anti-Indian song a few years ago, and other leaders in the city have, however, chastised the educator for promoting hatred against the Indian community.

 Indian-origin playwright Ronnie Govender has called for an investigation by the education department into the comments made by the professor.

 Valley post offices reopen

 Jammu (PTI): All post offices which were 

 closed in Jammu and Kashmir in the wake of militancy and 

 firing across the Line of Control have been reopened, the 

 chief postmaster general of the state circle said on Wednesday.

 All the 1689 post offices, including 708 in Kashmir, are now functional, Samant said.

 The chief postmaster general said the department has also improved services, which includes providing mobile bills. ?We have also undertaken delivery of call letters of the public service commission and the service selection board at a cheaper cost,? he said.

 Damages rap on TN body

 Madurai (PTI): A court has ordered attachment 

 of nine buses of the Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation 

 following its failure to give compensation to accident victims.

 The court had asked the corporation in 2002 to pay Rs 3.84 lakh to the next of the kin of 10 passengers killed in a collision between a state bus and a van on March 21, 2001. As the corporation did not pay any compensation, a relative of one of the victims moved court, which passed the order on Tuesday.

 in Madhya Pradesh.

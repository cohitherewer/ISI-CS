 Focus shifts to bandit booty

 Bangalore, Oct. 20: Veerappan?s booty, amassed over 30 years and tucked away in 6,000 sq km of dense forest along the Karnataka-Tamil Nadu border, could be up for grabs.

 No one, however, has a clue to the bandit?s secret stockpile of cash, ivory, sandalwood logs and weapons.

 In 1993, the Karnataka unit of the Special Task Force had discovered an underground storehouse of food grain and weapons after finding paddy planted in the shape of Tamil alphabets and decipherable from a height.

 Veerappan?s gang had used the spot for a couple of months but moved away on sighting the police. A few days later, the force had caught the bandit?s wife, Muthulakshmi, in the vicinity.

 Another combing operation following Rajkumar?s abduction and release late in 2000 had discovered several lakhs in crisp Rs 500 notes. Neatly packed in polythene bags, the currency was believed to be part of the ransom reportedly paid to secure the Kannada thespian?s release.

 The cash was handed to the Karnataka government but the task force chief, inspector-general P. Kempaiah, was transferred following differences with the S.M. Krishna regime.

 Now that Veerappan is dead and buried, the task of unearthing the riches would either be official ? the STF could mount random searches ? or it could be left to tribals living in the region.

 That such an operation, if launched, would be shrouded in secrecy could be gauged from the smile of Jyothi Prakash Mirji, who leads the Karnataka arm of the joint task force.

 ?Somebody will find it. It is for the government to decide the future of STF because it was set up with the sole task of tracking down Veerappan,? Mirji said here today.

 Veerappan?s secret deposits could run into several crores. He had at first earned a pile through poaching and sandalwood smuggling. Then he extorted money from local quarry owners.

 But his biggest cache came in the form of the ransom reportedly paid for Rajkumar?s release.

 Karnataka has always denied any payment to the bandit, but retired director-general C. Dinakar mentions Rs 20 crore in his book Rajkumar: Veerappan?s Prized Catch.

 A twist was added to the ransom story by former assistant commissioner of police Sangram Singh soon after the CBI arrested him for his alleged links with stamp scam mastermind Abdul Karim Telgi.

 In his confessional statement to a magistrate in Bangalore, Singh alleged he was asked to carry Rs 20 crore from the house of Krishna?s son-in-law V.G. Siddartha and that he once saw Telgi in that bungalow.

 Ulfa signal to Delhi

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Goswami

New Delhi, Nov. 15: A day after the National Democratic Front of Boroland (NDFB) said it was ready to hold talks with Delhi but not the Assam government, the Ulfa sent a similar message across to the Prime Minister?s Office.

 Armed with an appeal that has been ostensibly approved by the militant leadership, writer Mamoni Raisom Goswami met M.K. Narayanan, the special adviser to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, to convey the Ulfa?s willingness to enter into a dialogue with Delhi. 

 Goswami is also understood to have informed the PMO that the Ulfa was open to the idea of dropping ?sovereignty? as a condition for the talks, provided it remained the ?key element? in the discussions. 

 She said the outfit would, however, not budge from its stand of holding talks only with the Centre.

 The writer indicated during her discussions with Narayanan that the Ulfa had given up its demand for talks on the pattern of the dialogue between Delhi and the NSCN (Isak-Muivah) in a ?third country?. 

 Sources said the PMO was satisfied with the content of the appeal and could arrange a meeting between Goswami and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh tomorrow.

 The award-winning writer and teacher has been in touch with Ulfa commander-in-chief Paresh Barua for quite some time.

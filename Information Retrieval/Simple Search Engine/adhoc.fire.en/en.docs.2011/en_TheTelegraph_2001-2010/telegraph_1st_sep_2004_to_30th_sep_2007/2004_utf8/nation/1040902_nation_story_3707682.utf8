 Arjun clears air, ministry book backlog

 New Delhi, Sept. 1: As Arjun Singh today set out to clear the air about his detoxification drive, the National Council for Educational Research and Training went on an overdrive to make pre-2000 history textbooks available to school teachers.

 The government blamed the recent truckers strike after coming under criticism for delay in distribution of the old textbooks. The NCERT has completed reprinting history texts for all classes, except IX and X, and is in the process of making them available to teachers, a human resource development ministry official said.

 HRD minister Singh today said his drive to detoxify the curriculum was in line with the United Progressive Alliance governments common minimum programme.

 It is not a shot in the dark, the minister said, clarifying that the drive was executed after discussions with the Prime Minister and other cabinet colleagues.

 On criticism that his focus was limited to changing textbooks, Singh said this was the argument of people who are despairing of everything else.

 The changes were made so obviously and blatantly by the good offices of (former HRD minister Murli Manohar) Joshi that I had no choice, he added.

 Singh declared that his priority was to restore the equilibrium in education but his ministrys officials hinted their focus right now was on ensuring that teachers received the old books soon.

 The NCERTs executive committee at its meeting on July 19 had decided not to change the texts for the current academic session but desaffronise them from the next.

 It had also decided that the old texts would be printed in sufficient numbers so that at least five copies could be sent free to each Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) school as reference material.

 The NCERT advised teachers to let students continue using the books currently available and not force them to buy the previous texts.

 The government asked CBSE to conduct tests in such a manner that students being taught toxic history do not suffer in the board examinations if their teachers have failed to consult the NCERTs advisories.

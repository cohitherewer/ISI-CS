 Monica closer to dead end

 New Delhi: The Portugal Supreme Court 

 has turned down Monica Bedi?s petition against her extradition 

 to India to stand trial for getting a fake passport but 

 she may finally be sent to India only some time next year, 

 reports our special correspondent.

 Monica has exhausted her options in Portugal courts but CBI officials said she could make one last try and appeal to Lisbon?s parliament to let her return to Norway to her parents.

 The Bollywood actress, whose arrest in Lisbon along with gangster Abu Salem made headlines a little more than two years ago, had recently made a similar attempt and written to President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to get the CBI to spare her.

 The CBI has sought her extradition to make her face trial for getting a fake passport in India. But it is more interested in the opportunity to question her to get details about the functioning of the underworld and Salem.

 That Monica also realises this came out clearly in her letters to the Indian dignitaries. She emphasised she did not know as much about the underworld as the CBI must believe and came to know about Salem?s underworld links quite late in the day. 

 Autistic boy denied residency

 Sydney (AP): The family of a 12-year-old 

 Indian boy has been denied permanent residency in Australia 

 because of the child?s autism, his father said on Friday.

 Rophin Morris was recently chosen to appear on a government-sponsored calendar honouring people.

 Rophin, who is described as ?moderately autistic? by his father, Jude, was honoured on Thursday at the launch of the calendar to mark December 3 as international day of people with a disability. 

 The family, which came to Australia in 1993, first applied for permanent residency in 2002, but received a rejection saying their son did not meet the country?s health requirements. ?The wording used was that he had a condition that will cost the community,? Jude, who is from Kerala, said in a telephone interview.

 After exhausting the immigration department?s appeals process, Jude filed a plea in September with the immigration minister ? the last resort before deportation ? and is awaiting a decision, which he has been told could take up to a year. 

 Children hurt in mishap

 Thiruvananthapuram (PTI): Thirty-five 

 children and two employees of a school for the mentally 

 challenged were injured when the bus in which they were 

 travelling turned turtle at Peroorkada here on Friday.

 The children, from the P.R.S. Pillai Memorial School, were going to a function organised to mark World Disabled Day. While most of them received minor injuries, two had to be admitted to hospital.

 Rebel abduction

 Raipur (PTI): Suspected Maoist rebels 

 abducted three forest department employees from Kanker district 

 of Chhattisgarh on Friday. The two forest guards and a beat 

 guard were kidnapped in the Pondgaon forest of Antapur police 

 station area, about 250 km from here, police said.

 Rape slur on cop

 Dehradun (PTI): A constable, Vinod, was 

 arrested for allegedly raping a girl in Rudraprayag district 

 of Uttaranchal. The victim?s father, a resident of the Bhaisgaon 

 area of the Rudraprayag district, has lodged a complaint 

 with the police alleging that Vinod had raped his daughter, 

 a Class XI student.

 Aircraft snag

 Chennai (PTI): A Kuala Lumpur-bound 

 Austrian Airlines flight with 300 passengers on board made 

 an emergency landing here in the early hours of Friday after 

 one of its engines developed a snag. The passengers were 

 taken to the airport?s lounge after the plane landed safely 

 at 4 am, airport sources said. The Chennai air traffic control 

 granted permission to the commander of the Airbus-300, on 

 a flight from Vienna, to make the emergency landing when 

 he got in touch after noticing the snag.

 Mild tremor

 New Delhi (PTI): An earthquake of low 

 intensity shook areas along the Delhi-Haryana border early 

 on Friday. No damage was reported. The quake, measuring 

 2.5 on the Richter scale, was felt at 12.52 am.

 The population of the Great Indian Bustard, an endangered species, has shot up by at least 40 by September, 2004. A 200-hectare area in Gujarat?s Kutch region was declared a sanctuary in 1992 to protect the bird.

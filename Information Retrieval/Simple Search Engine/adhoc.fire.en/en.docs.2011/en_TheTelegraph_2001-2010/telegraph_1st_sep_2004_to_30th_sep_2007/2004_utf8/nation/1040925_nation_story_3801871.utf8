 Minority school push

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 24: The human resource development ministry will soon bring an ordinance to set up a national commission for minority education in order to make it easier for minority educational institutions to get affiliated to central universities.

 The ministry believes much damage has been done during former minister Murli Manohar Joshi?s tenure, when he gave minority educational institutions a hard time.

 The proposed ordinance, currently being worked out, will speed up the creation of the commission, which, in turn, will be able to address the problems of minority institutions without delay. Parliament will enact a law when it meets in November to give the commission the required legal backing.

 The government does not have to wait for another two months for the commission to start functioning if it brings an ordinance. According to the ministry, the commission will be a quasi-judicial body that will act as a facilitator between minority educational institutions and central universities.

 The BJP, Joshi in particular, may object to the introduction of an ordinance since political parties believe it gives the government an opportunity to dodge a discussion on a sensitive subject.

 The United Progressive Alliance?s common minimum programme promises a minority education commission. ?The UPA government,? it says, ?will amend the Constitution to establish a commission for minority educational institutions that will provide direct affiliation for minority educational and professional institutions to central universities.?

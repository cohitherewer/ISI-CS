 Basu keeps up Montek attack

 OUR BUREAU

 Sept. 24: CPM leader Jyoti Basu today dubbed Montek Singh Ahluwalia ?a World Bank man? for including foreign consultants in the Planning Commission but the party?s central leaders said it would wait for the Prime Minister?s decision.

 Basu slightly softened his stand when asked if he wanted the plan panel deputy chairperson to resign. ?Why should he (Ahluwalia) resign? He should change his mind and discuss the matter with us.?

 The four Left parties have asked Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to remove representatives of the World Bank, Asian Development Bank and McKinsey from the panel?s advisory bodies.

 ?The Prime Minister has told us he will look into the matter. We are waiting for his response,? CPM politburo member Prakash Karat said.

 Ahluwalia has made it clear he does not favour showing the foreign consultants the door but he, too, has left the final decision to the Prime Minister. ?All this we are going to discuss when we get back. On that one (issue), I have no comments to make,? Ahluwalia said in New York today, PTI added. He is accompanying Singh on his foreign tour.

 Basu?s comment came at the CPM secretariat meeting held at the party?s Alimuddin Street office in Calcutta.

 ?There is nothing wrong in seeking advice or fund from the World Bank or any other international body. But why did he take World Bank experts into the consultative committees of the Planning Commission? Why do outsiders dictate us in framing our policies?? Basu asked.

 ?This is all wrong and unacceptable,? he added.

 The matter would be taken up with Singh on his return, Basu said. The next United Progressive Alliance-Left coordination committee meeting is scheduled later this month.

 The United Progressive Alliance government could face more trouble and acrimony if Singh backs Ahluwalia.

 The Left parties have disapproved of Ahluwalia from the day he took charge. 

 CPM general secretary Harkishen Singh Surjeet had met Singh and voiced his party?s objection to the appointment.

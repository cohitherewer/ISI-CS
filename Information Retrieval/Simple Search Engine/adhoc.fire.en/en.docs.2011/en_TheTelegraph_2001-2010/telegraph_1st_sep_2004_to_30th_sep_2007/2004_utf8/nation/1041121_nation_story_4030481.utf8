 Akram shares diabetes fightback tips

 AYSWARIA VENUGOPAL

 New Delhi, Nov. 20: Mental strength not karela (bitter gourd) juice is what helped former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram tackle diabetes.

 The cricketer who was here today to spread diabetes awareness was diagnosed as a diabetic soon after Pakistan won the World Cup in 1992. Akram says he beat the disease with discipline and mental strength and ?hasn?t felt tired since he started exercising?.

 ?Diabetes gave me a point to prove. It was a challenge to me that one could give their best despite having diabetes. It is all in the mind,? says Akram who was in the capital campaigning for diabetes awareness as part of the Accu-Chek Inspiration Series ?04 organised by Roche Diagnostics (India) Pvt. Ltd.

 Playing international cricket as a diabetic often meant popping chocolates during matches or taking insulin in the evening to keep blood sugar levels steady. ?You have to actually monitor yourself carefully. For instance, batting is more stressful and blood sugar levels really go down during batting for me. Or if you are bowling, then you have to adjust the insulin injections accordingly because it takes 20 minutes to act,? Akram, who debuted as a tearaway left-arm quick but went on to become one of the best all-rounders in the world, said.

 But exercise and diet control is important. Fighting diabetes meant a change of lifestyle for the veteran of 104 Test matches. ?You cant eat junk food at all. Fried food like samosas and pakoras that we are all fond have to be totally avoided. You have to avoid a sedentary lifestyle. Regular exercise is very important for control. Start walking or if you are like me, start gyms for about two hours, depending on the age group. If you are going to office, come back and go for a walk. Go for a walk after dinner,? he says.

 Giving up fried and junk food was easier for Akram than trying out the old Indian diabetes remedy ? drinking glassfuls of karela juice. ?Have you ever had it? Do you know what it tastes like?? the cricket legend asked.

 Speaking about the time he was diagnosed as having diabetes, but under control, Akram recalls it was a huge shock. ?When I was diagnosed with diabetes, I was in shock. I couldn?t sleep for two weeks. But since then, I have performed better,? he says. The all-rounder admits he was afraid then that the Pakistan cricket establishment might ask him to retire.

 Akram?s family and friends helped him tide over the difficult times. ?If you are mentally strong, you can fight this. My wife was just as shocked as I was. However, with their help and my friends, I decided to fight it. My doctor?s role was also important as a motivator. He told me that it (diabetes) could be handled and soon I was back on the road. Obviously, if you go to a doctor who says its all over just because you have diabetes, then you are done for,? Akram said. He made it clear that the support of family and friends is important for patients to tackle the disease.

 Diabetes could not hold Akram back from being rated as one of the all-time greats, even if he had to regularly battle its tell-tale symptoms like poor glycemic control, tiredness and see-sawing blood sugar levels.

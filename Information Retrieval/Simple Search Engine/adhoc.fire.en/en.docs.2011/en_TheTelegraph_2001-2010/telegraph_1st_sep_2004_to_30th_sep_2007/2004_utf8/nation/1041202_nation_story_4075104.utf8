 Ex-major held

 New Delhi, Dec. 1: A retired army major and Arjuna Award winner has been arrested for allegedly evading income tax worth over Rs 11 crore, reports our correspondent.

 Suresh Yadav, who owns a cable television company that served northwest Delhi, had evaded tax from 1998 to 2002. This led to a non-bailable arrest warrant against the former middle distance runner who represented India at the Asian Games and Asian Championships. He was arrested at Peera Garhi in west Delhi yesterday.

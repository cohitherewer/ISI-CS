 SUDHANSHU MISHRA 

 Shekhawat: Licence to shoot

 Jaipur, Nov. 1: It could be the wild, wild West, going by the number of firearm licences taken out in Rajasthan, particularly by those in government. 

 Leading the list of those who have the licence to shoot with a view to ?defend themselves? is Vice-President Bhairon Singh Shekhawat. He armed himself with a revolver and the right to carry 10 to 20 bullets in 1997 when he was the chief minister. 

 Though he has moved to Delhi, the revolver stays dear to him. He got the licence renewed in September. 

 Also renewing his licences for a 12-bore gun and a 22-bore rifle in September was Narpat Singh Rajvi, industry minister in the Vasundhara Raje government and Shekhawat?s son-in-law. He is entitled to keep 20-100 bullets. 

 Rajvi was living with his father-in-law when he ruled from Jaipur and had applied for the licences mentioning 8, Civil Lines ? the official residence of the chief minister ? as his residential address. 

 The gun fetish pervaded Raj Bhavan, too. A former occupant, retired Justice Anshuman Singh, took out licences for a 12-bore gun and a .315 revolver. He had received permission to carry a pistol immediately after his retirement from Rajasthan High Court. 

 Justice Ashok Parihar of the high court holds a licence for a 22-bore rifle, which he took out in 1999, and Justice Karni Singh Rathore keeps a 12-bore gun and a 22-bore rifle.

 Several political leaders took out licences during their tenures in the government of the day or as representatives of the people. 

 Raghuvir Singh Kaushal, now a BJP MP, keeps a 32-bore rifle since he was minister for forests, environment and parliamentary affairs in the Shekhawat ministry. He had mentioned his ministerial bungalow as his residence. 

 Education minister Ghanshyam Tiwari took out a licence in 1992 and yet another in 1996, when he was energy minister. He had mentioned his MLA quarters as his residential address. 

 Pradyuman Singh of the Congress, finance minister in the previous Ashok Gehlot government, had taken a licence for a 32-bore rifle in 2001 when he was a legislator. He is a Congress MLA in the present Assembly. 

 Former public works minister Harendra Mirdha, son of senior Congress leader Ram Niwas Mirdha, keeps a pistol. 

 A former Congress finance minister, Chandan Mal Baid, got gun licences as far back as 1954 and then in 1956. Former chief minister Shiv Charan Mathur has a pistol and is allowed to keep 10 bullets. 

 Several IAS and IPS officers and their wives have followed in the footsteps of their political masters.

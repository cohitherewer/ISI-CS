 Fight for flights

 London, Nov. 7: The UK?s 

 three biggest airlines, British Airways, Virgin and BMI, 

 are this week set for a fierce battle for the right to operate 

 extra flights to India, one of the most lucrative routes 

 in aviation.

 The civil aviation authority will allocate a further 21 direct flights per week to India on Thursday. BA currently owns the rights to all 19 flights a week, which are typically sold out months in advance.

 However, BA has requested all 21 new flights, which have become available after talks between the UK and India. Experts say the UK to India market is worth around ?200 m a year in revenue, but is expected to grow substantially.

 The battle will be settled at a so-called ?scarce capacity hearing?, the first since 1999 and the first to involve the UK?s three biggest airlines.

 Around 60 per cent of those travelling on the route are forced to go via another airport, usually Frankfurt or Dubai, on flights operated by Lufthansa or Emirates.

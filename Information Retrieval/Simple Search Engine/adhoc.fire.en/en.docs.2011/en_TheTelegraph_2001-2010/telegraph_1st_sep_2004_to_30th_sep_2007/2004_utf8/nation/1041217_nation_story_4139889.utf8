The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 DD pitches for Pak series

 New Delhi, Dec. 16: Doordarshan is back in the running for sole telecast rights of the India-Pakistan cricket series scheduled for early next year, reports our special correspondent. 

 The Board of Control for Cricket in India has asked the public broadcaster to forward its bid for the series, but sources in Mandi House were tightlipped about the amount DD was willing to offer. 

 ?We are ready to offer a fair price,?? Prasar Bharati CEO K.S. Sarma said. ?But the amount cannot be like what was on offer for the earlier India-Pakistan or India-Australia matches. Public interest is going down after India?s poor performance against Australia and the one-dayer with Pakistan.?

 He said the BCCI decision would be known by next week.

 .? The teams? current good showing in Bangladesh will make little difference as interest in these games are minimal.?

 ?Bangladesh is not yet regarded as a major cricket playing nation by the Indian audience,? Sarma said.

 Manipur varsity officials missing

 Imphal: Confusion and conspiracy theories emerged from a commotion within the Manipur University campus on Wednesday after it transpired that the vice-chancellor and the registrar of the institution had not returned home since Monday.

 Vice-chancellor N. Bijoy Singh and registrar R.K. Ranjan Singh were ostensibly in their offices until Monday afternoon. Neither informed any of their staff members before leaving their offices and nobody saw them walking out with strangers. 

 The officials? families confirmed in the morning that they had been missing for over 48 hours, but declined to say whether the duo may have been abducted for ransom. A member of the university staff said both were ?found absent? in their offices after 2 pm on Monday.

 The abduction theory gained credence when investigations revealed that the registrar?s driver, S. Sunil Singh, had not returned home either since that day.

 The families of neither official sought any help from the police. They said the vice-chancellor and the registrar could be busy with ?official work? elsewhere.

 ?No formal complaint has been lodged either by the university or the families. But we are trying to find facts,? a senior police official said.

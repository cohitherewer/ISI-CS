 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 28: Under fire from the Left for including foreign consultants in the Planning Commission?s consultative committees, plan panel deputy chairperson Montek Singh Ahluwalia today tried to save face by saying that he will meet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh shortly to find a solution. 

 The four Left parties want representatives of the World Bank, Asian Development Bank and McKinsey removed from the panel?s advisory bodies.

 Ahluwalia today met the plan panel members to rally support for himself. 

 Later, many members pointed out privately that the World Bank and the ADB have decided to keep their representatives off the consultative bodies.

 ?We have discussed with the members of the commission and will meet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in a day or two to resolve the issue,? Ahluwalia said after today?s meeting.

 Certain UN bodies are represented in the consultative process but neither the Left nor Left economists have objected to this. 

 After the Left took up cudgels against the Centre, many Left-leaning independent economists inducted into these consultative panels threatened to walk out if World Bank and ADB economists remained on the committees.

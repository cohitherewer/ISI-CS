 Sharmila saddened by Saif but candid still

 London, Oct. 20: Sharmila Tagore did not dodge the issue when she was asked deeply personal questions about her son Saif and the break-up of his marriage to Amrita.

 Instead of refusing to answer such questions, she responded to everything that was thrown at her last night at the Nehru Centre by journalists who turned the occasion into an impromptu and long press conference with the chairperson designate of the film censor board.

 What about Saif and Amrita, asked an intrepid reporter who was prepared to go where others were perhaps a little scared to, for Sharmila can be famously haughty. The journalists needn?t have worried.

 She was obviously saddened by the break-up of her son?s marriage but she was now most concerned that Saif and Amrita should behave in a mature way and be guided by what was in the best interests of their young children, Sara and Ibrahim.

 ?The son is very young,? said Sharmila, full of grandmotherly concern.

 ?They (Saif and Amrita) are grown up and they have children. We have spoken to them, he was away for a couple of months, he has had time to think, (and) his mind seems to be made up.?

 Sharmila repeated that what she was most concerned about was the welfare of the children. As for Saif and Amrita, ?after the initial shock and hurt, there is less acrimony, they are (being) more understanding and mature about it?.

 Impressed with Sharmila?s candid replies, a woman journalist exclaimed: ?I really like her. She speaks very well and should be the I amp;B minister.?

 Sharmila, accompanied by her husband, ?Tiger? Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi, launched a CD of Tagore songs and poems at the Nehru Centre on Monday and a book on Bollywood last night.

 Afterwards, she told the press that although she had accepted the job of chairperson as of now, she would not be free to be fully active because of shooting commitments until February next year.

 She is shooting Mahesh Manjrekar?s Virudh with Amitabh Bachchan and would also love to do something for Aparna Sen, although the latter had offered dates which clashed with the first film, said Sharmila.

 She also made it clear that the appointment as chief censor had come as a complete surprise. Again and again, she stressed she respected and admired Anupam Kher whom she had replaced. ?I did not lobby for the post,? she assured journalists.

 In fact, she was shopping in London when the call came through on her mobile phone from someone at I amp;B in Delhi who ?wanted my biodata ? so I gave it. Tiger said I should ask why they wanted it but I didn?t?, she added with a shrug.

 She and Tiger appear to have an easy relationship. 

 Once the glamorous boy of world cricket ? Winchester, Oxford and captain of India at 22 ? he now sits quietly on a sofa, allowing his wife, glamorous last night in a black silk sari and a greenish one on Monday ? to hog the limelight.

 A happy marriage, suggested Sharmila, required many accommodations, such as allowing each other sufficient ?space?, tolerance, understanding, and ?not trying to win all the time?. When the early passion was spent, a comfortable relationship, almost like that between ?brother and sister?, meant husband and wife instinctively knew what the other thought or felt without the need for words. ?There is no recipe for a successful marriage,? said Sharmila.

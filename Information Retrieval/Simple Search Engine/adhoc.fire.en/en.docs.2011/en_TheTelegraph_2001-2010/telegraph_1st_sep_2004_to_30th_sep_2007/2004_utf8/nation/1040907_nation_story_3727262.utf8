 Bombs found in plastic balls

Ahmedabad (PTI): A crude bomb packed in a plastic ball exploded 

in a garbage dump in the Sarangpur area on Monday, injuring a 20-year-old ragpicker.

 Police found 10 more such bomb-stuffed balls from the spot.

 An alert has been sounded in all police stations after the recovery was made as this is the first time that crude bombs stuffed into plastic balls have been recovered. It is either an apparent bid by unknown persons to lure children or they dumped the whole bundle fearing a police crackdown, a police official said.

 Combing operations will be increased with Janmashthami being celebrated on Tuesday, sources said.

 A case has been registered at Kalupur police station and a bomb disposal squad and a forensic team have joined the investigation, the police added.

 Teachers quota for widows

10 per cent reservation for widows and separated women in jobs in the education

 As the first step, 2,800 jobs will be open to widows and separated women. An ordinance on this will be issued soon, Tiwari added.

 The women recruited under this quota will have to complete either their B Ed degree or STC within five years of recruitment, the education minister said.

 The oldest surviving Olympic gold medallist will have a hockey match between Pakistan and India dedicated to him after celebrating his 100th birthday on Thursday.

 Feroz Khan played in the Indian national hockey team that won gold at the 1928 Olympic Games in Amsterdam and settled in Pakistan after Partition.

 Khan became the oldest-known living Olympic medallist after the death of American James Rockefeller ? who won gold in rowing at the 1924 Paris Olympics ? at the age of 102 last month.

 ?It is a matter of pride for us that we still have such a distinguished figure among us,? Pakistan Hockey Federation secretary Brigadier Musarratullah said. 

 ?We have decided to celebrate his 100th birthday by dedicating the first Test of the hockey series on September 24 in Karachi after him.?

 In Lahore to celebrate his birthday with his family, Khan said a better performance from Asian teams at the Athens Olympics would have been his birthday gift. 

 ?It is sad that we have lost our traditional style of playing because of the European advancement in world hockey,? he added.

 Pakistan finished fifth in Athens while India had to be content with seventh place as Australia won the hockey gold for the first time.

 ?The hockey you see today is not what we used to play. The artistry and flair is gone,? he said. ?It is sad but the International Hockey Federation has done nothing to prevent changing of rules that have robbed the sport of its finesse and skills.?

 Born in a small village called Basti Danishmandan in Jalandhar on September 9, 1904, Khan was a contemporary of Indian hockey great Dhyan Chand and they played together in the 1928 Olympic Games.

 ?I was very upset at being dropped from the Indian team for the 1932 Olympic Games in Los Angeles because the selectors had to accommodate Dhyan Chand at the centre forward position which was why when the time came, we moved to Pakistan,? Khan recalled.

 He was a member of the committee that selected the Pakistan team that won the hockey gold medal at the 1960 Rome Olympics by beating India in the final ? an event he described as one of the highlights of his life.

 ?I am also proud that my son... Farooq Feroze Khan also served as the president of the Pakistan Hockey Federation and did a lot for the promotion of the game.?

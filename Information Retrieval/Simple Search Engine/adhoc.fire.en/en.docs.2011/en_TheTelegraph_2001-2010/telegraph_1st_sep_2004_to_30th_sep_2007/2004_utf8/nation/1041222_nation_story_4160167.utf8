 Code for camera phones

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 21: The sex-clip scandal has prompted a camera mobile phone maker to come out with a code of ethics for users.

 ?The camera phone should not be used to take photographs in public places like swimming pools, changing rooms, gyms, etc.,? Samsung India Electronics said in a list of dos and don?ts. 

 ?The company believes that there is a need to use technology responsibly,? Kunal Ahuja, vice-president (telecom), said.

 The company said camera phones should not be used to take photographs of individuals without their consent. ?Users must respect individual office, educational or industrial environment where confidentiality of design and information is a matter of great importance,? it added, describing the guidelines as voluntary. 

 The company reminded users that camera phones should not be used to ?shoot and circulate? objectionable content. ?It is illegal and punishable by law,? it said. 

 Samsung also cautioned users not to use the phone in ?prohibited areas? like airports, high-security zones, museums and theatres and at live performances. ?It is dangerous to use camera phones while driving,? it added. ?Users should refrain (from using it) while driving.?

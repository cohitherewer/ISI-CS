 Minority panel boost

 R. VENKATARAMAN

 New Delhi, Nov. 27: The Centre may grant constitutional status to the National Minority Commission.

 The move comes a day after Justice (retired) M.S.A. Siddiqui was appointed head of the three-member National Commission for Minority Educational Institutions set up after an ordinance was promulgated.

 Official sources said constitutional status for the minorities? panel would give it ?teeth? so that it could ?summon? even a state government to inquire into any violation of the rights of minorities. ?So far, the NMC (National Minority Commission) has been a statutory body created under the NMC Act enacted by Parliament,? a source said.

 ?The NMC being a statutory body can only make recommendations and its recommendations are not binding on the government. The sole function of the NMC so far has been recommendatory. Now, armed with the constitutional status it can pass verdicts and can compel all the state governments and the Centre to provide it with records in cases of violations of minority rights and communal riot situations like the Gujarat incidents,? the source added.

 If communal attacks like the ones in Gujarat occur, the minority panel will be able to call for documents and summon the state government through its chief secretary and other police officials and civil administrators.

 The sources gave the analogy of the poll panel which is a constitutional body. ?To decide a matter, the EC summons the government concerned, the political parties and other officials to adjudicate. Likewise, the NMC, after attaining constitutional status can also issue summons and call for records.?

 The National Commission for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes is the only panel that has constitutional status. All other commissions have been created through parliamentary statutes. ?It has been a long-felt need and demand of the minorities to confer NMC with constitutional status and hence the move,? a source said.

 But with Parliament?s winter session starting on December 1, there may not be an ordinance. A bill to reorganise the panel as a constitutional body is likely to be introduced instead.

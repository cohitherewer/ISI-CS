 Search yields 100 more shells

 New Delhi: In the first discovery of its magnitude in the capital, more than 100 shells of rockets and mortars were found in a container carrying metal scrap at the Tughlakabad Inland Container Depot here on Saturday, reports our correspondent.

 After a blast last week that killed 10 labourers and injured 30 at the factory of Bhushan Steel and Strips, the recent discoveries of unexploded ordnance among imported metal scrap have blown the lid off the large quantity of undetected explosives finding their way into the country.

 The shells found on Saturday were in a container headed for the Bhushan steel plant in Ghaziabad.

 Police did not rule out the possibility of more such explosives being found as four other containers from overseas were being screened. 

 The central government has also tightened norms for import of metal waste and scrap, particularly from a country affected by war. 

 According to a directorate general of foreign trade notification, import of metal waste and scrap would now be permitted only in shredded or compacted form.

 The import of waste not processed accordingly will be allowed only after thorough inspection and that too, only through major ports and the inland container depot in Tughlakabad. 

 For imports of scrap from rebellion- or war-affected countries, certain documents will have to be furnished to the customs department.

 Fahrenheit 9/11 cleared

Mumbai (PTI): Fahrenheit 9/11, a film by Academy Award-winning 

filmmaker Michael Moore, has been cleared by the censor board. 

 The film looks into why US President George W. Bush and his inner circle avoided pursuing the Saudi connection to the September 11 terror strikes.

 ?The film, which was sent to a revising committee earlier, has been cleared without a single cut,? censor board chairman Anupam Kher said.

 He said many films are sent to a revising committee and it was part of the procedure. ?It is only the press that chooses to react on the issue,? he added.

 ?Why talk about only Fahrenheit 9/11? Recently even a religious film, Dharamshakti, was sent to a revising committee,? Kher said.

 IIMA fair

 Ahmedabad: Students of the Indian Institute of Management here will get a taste of ?disguise marketing?, a concept developed by students themselves, at its annual marketing fair, Insight, on Sunday. At the fair, visitors would be expected to play certain games as they stroll through stalls exhibiting consumer products. Students will study their reactions and suggest solutions. The technique aims to get genuine feedback as it has been seen that users have developed a bias against market research and their feedback does not show their original choice. 

Designers, artists and members of the diplomatic community 

of Delhi have painted pots to sell them at an auction. The funds will be used 

to build schools for children of potters of Khurja in Uttar Pradesh.

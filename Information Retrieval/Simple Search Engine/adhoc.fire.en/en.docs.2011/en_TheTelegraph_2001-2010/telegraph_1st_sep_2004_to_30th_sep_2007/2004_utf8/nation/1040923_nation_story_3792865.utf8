 Mufti escapes grenade attack

 MUKHTAR AHMAD

 Srinagar Sept. 22: Mufti Mohammad Sayeed escaped a bid on his life when militants attacked the office of the Anantnag district magistrate with rifle grenades where the chief minister was filing his nomination papers this afternoon.

 Police said six persons were injured in the vicinity of the complex. The rifle grenades were fired in quick succession. One exploded inside the office complex of the district police chief while two others exploded inside and outside the district magistrate?s office, the police said.

 ?One grenade exploded inside a mini-bus stand injuring bystanders. We immediately took them to hospital,? said a police officer. 

 Three seriously injured persons were shifted to Soura Institute. Doctors said the condition of one injured person, identified as Fayaz Ahmad, was critical.

 After filing his papers for Pahalgam constituency, Mufti was escorted out of the complex and later returned to the summer capital Srinagar in a heavily guarded cavalcade. Additional troops had been deployed for his security.

 No one has yet claimed responsibility for the attack.

 Mufti?s guards present inside the office of district magistrate, however, kept assuring him that the explosions were crackers burst in jubilation by party supporters.

 The chief minister?s daughter, Mehbooba Mufti, and other ministerial colleagues and the party supporters had accompanied Mufti to Anantnag.

 The chief minister is seeking election to the Lower House of the state legislature after the Pahalgam seat was vacated by Mehbooba who was elected to Parliament. At present, Mufti is a member of the Upper House of the state legislature. 

 Earlier, while addressing a gathering at Anantnag, the chief minister had said a lasting solution to the Kashmir problem was necessary to end the suffering of the people. ?The problem has taken a heavy toll of human life over the decade and the atmosphere of friendship would benefit the people of the state the most.? 

 About his contesting the Pahalgam byelection, Mufti said the decision was taken in ?deference to the wishes of the people?.

Mumbai, Dec. 20: Asha Gawli, wife of gangster-turned-MLA Arun Gawli, was arrested today and produced in court on charges of assaulting a woman, confining her wrongfully and intimidation, reports our special correspondent. She was granted bail after being produced at the Mazgaon court. 

 Asha was arrested with four others, two men and two women, all of whom were released on a surety of Rs 3,000 each. ?But they have been asked to be present at a police station for two hours daily for 14 days for interrogation,? said deputy commissioner of police Ashok Dongre.

 The arrest took place following a complaint from Lata Mohite yesterday morning. She claimed that Asha wanted her son and the son of another woman, both teenagers, to be produced before her in connection with a jewellery theft. But since they were not available, Mohite was picked up. The other woman, whose son was wanted by Asha, lives in Dagri Chawl, like Gawli.

 With this, Asha joins the rank of her husband against whom such charges abound and who was picked up last month, on assault, wrongful confinement and intimidation charges by a reporter from an English daily here.

 Alexander: Insider story

 New Delhi, Sept. 17: P.C. Alexander may be bitter about the Congress thwarting his presidential ambitions and setting up roadblocks on his way to becoming a Rajya Sabha MP, but he had only good things to say today about Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi.

 The long-serving former Maharashtra governor served as principal secretary to both Prime Ministers.

 Speaking after releasing his much talked about autobiography, Through the Corridors of Power ? an Insider?s Story, Alexander said Indira Gandhi had ?warned? the then army chief about the fallout of Operation Bluestar while her son had ?the potential to become a great Prime Minister, but god did not allow him?.

 The former bureaucrat?s book release was attended by many VIPs. But Congress leaders other than national security adviser J.. Dixit, himself a former bureaucrat, were absent. 

 Alexander has been bitter at the Congress? lack of support for him when his name was bandied about as a candidate for the post of President. He emerged as an early frontrunner, but failed to get the nod after a last-minute NDA compromise in favour of A.P.J. Abdul Kalam.

 Eminent lawyer Fali S. Nariman released the book and handed over a copy to former Prime Minister I.K. Gujral. Nariman, Gujral, former President R. Venkatraman and BJP leader Arun Jaitley spoke at length about the book and praised Alexander as an outstanding bureaucrat.

 Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar and former Rajya Sabha deputy chairperson Najma Heptullah, who recently joined the BJP, attended the function.

 Alexander said Indira Gandhi ?was a broken woman? after the 1984 Operation Bluestar. Alexander, who was privy to all decisions taken by the Prime Minister?s Office, said criticism of Indira Gandhi?s handling of the Punjab crisis was unfair.

 He said she had the ?highest respect? for Sikhs and never thought of harming their interests. ?Do everything to bring them back,? Alexander quoted her as having said. Blaming then army chief A.S. Vaidya for the storming of the Golden Temple, he said the operation panned out differently from what Indira Gandhi had intended.

 Alexander praised Rajiv Gandhi for trusting him as principal secretary and snubbing those Congress leaders who tried to badmouth him.

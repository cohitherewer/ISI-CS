 Bandh total: BJP 

 GAUTAM SARKAR

 Bhagalpur, Dec. 10: The BJP claimed that today?s dawn-to-dusk Bhagalpur bandh, called in protest against the lathicharge on party legislators at the Bihar Assembly in Patna, was a resounding success.

 Bhagalpur MLA Ashwini Chaubey and other party members received injuries after police lathicharged them while they were on their way to the Assembly riding bullock-carts on Wednesday. 

 Today, a beaming Chaubey said over phone from Patna that the people of the silk city supported the bandh call as they wanted to protest against the Assembly incident and the poor law and order situation. 

 Despite the claims of Chaubey, the bandh was far from ?total?. While most business establishments remained closed and few vehicles plied on the roads, the bandh had partial impact on schools, colleges and cinema halls and none on government organisations. Vehicles returned to the streets after dusk. 

 Police arrested about a dozen BJP workers but no major incident was reported from anywhere in the district. Bandh supporters put up roadblocks at a few places and also tried to disrupt train services at Bhagalpur railway station. But prompt police action put paid to their efforts to hold up trains.

 Last evening, district BJP workers took out a procession in the town and burnt the effigies of chief minister Rabri Devi and railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav near the station. 

 Party spokesperson Dev Kumar Pandey said the lathicharge on BJP legislators was akin to the state high-handedness witnessed during the Emergency. He also alleged that the government has been providing patronage to criminals in the state.

 Political observers here said the bandh was part of Chaubey?s plans to win public sympathy before the election. The RJD as well as the Janata Dal (United) condemned the bandh call.

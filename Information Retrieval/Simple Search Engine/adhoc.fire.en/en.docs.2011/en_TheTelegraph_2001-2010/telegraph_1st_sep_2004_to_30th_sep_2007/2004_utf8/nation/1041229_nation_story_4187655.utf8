 Sea yields up a life after 8-hour trial

 Survived, but...: A file picture of Nemcova

 London, Dec. 28: British holidaymakers have been flying back to London from Thailand and Sri Lanka with nightmare stories of how they escaped with their lives when the killer tsunami waves crashed through their hotels just as they were preparing for breakfast on what they thought would be another leisurely day.

 The British government has estimated that there were about 10,000 UK holidaymakers in the affected areas. 

 The number of confirmed British deaths is 17, though this is expected to rise.

 Among those missing is an English fashion photographer, Simon Atlee, 33, who was on holiday with his supermodel girlfriend, Petra Nemcova, 25, on the Thai resort of Khao Lak. Petra managed to keep her head above water and grabbed hold of a palm tree before she was swept out to sea. She held on for eight hours, watching bodies float past, in agony from her injuries and the horror of seeing Simon disappear under water.

 Rescuers found her at sunset and she was airlifted to an inland hospital, where doctors found she had a broken pelvis and serious internal injuries. ?I can?t find Simon,? she said from her hospital bed. ?It was horrible. I?m very lucky, but I can?t find Simon.?

 A pensioner described how her daughter-in-law was swept to her death after popping into a supermarket to buy sun cream while holidaying on the popular Thai island of Phuket. Brenda Willgrass, 73, of Dereham, Norfolk, said her daughter-in-law Louise Willgrass, 43, was on holiday with her husband Nigel, also 43, and their four children, Emily, 16, Ben, 14, Michael, nine, and Katie, six. 

 Louise, Nigel and the children were on their way to the beach when the tsunami hit.

 ?Nigel was driving and they stopped because Louise needed some sun cream,? said Brenda. ?She got out of the car to pop into a supermarket but she never made it. Nigel said the tidal wave hit while she was standing outside the car.?

 Brenda went on: ?He said he saw some boats being overturned and the wave coming towards him. He tried to reverse the car but there was nothing he could do and the car was thrown back. Nigel and the children clung to debris as best they could and they were swept away and ended up on a hotel roof. They didn?t see what happened to Louise but her body has been found and Nigel has identified her.?

 Physiotherapist Debbie Bateson, 39, from Wokingham, Berkshire, said she was forewarned about the tsunami by a palmist at her hotel in Ahungala, on the south west coast of Sri Lanka, on Christmas Eve. ?He said to me the day before, ?Stay out of the sea ? big wave.? I took no notice.?

 Home office IT expert Dominic Ludlow, 32, from Kenley, Surrey, arrived at Heathrow Airport in a wheelchair, his chest lined with cuts and his leg in stitches, with his girlfriend, Samantha Scott, 23, from Essex. The pair were staying in a bungalow at Bangtaw beach when the wave hit. 

 Scott said one of the most terrifying aspects of her ordeal was when the waves subsided it was all silent except for the cries of people trapped and dying.

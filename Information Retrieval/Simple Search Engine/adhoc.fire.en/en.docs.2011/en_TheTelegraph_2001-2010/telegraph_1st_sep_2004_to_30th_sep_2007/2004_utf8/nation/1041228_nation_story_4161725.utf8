 Cool future for sizzler

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Dec. 27: Titlagarh in Orissa may stop sizzling from next year.

 With the government recently kicking off the Green Titlagarh project, the western Orissa town in Bolangir district ? known for temperatures as high as 50 degrees Celsius ? may witness cooler summers in future. 

 The project, taken up by forest officers, includes large-scale afforestation and creation of water bodies in the area. The three-year project features extensive plantation on the six granite hills of Kumuda, Sikerdangarpada, Tulung, Belpadar, Tikrapada Chattan and College Road Chattan. 

 Besides, avenue plantation, gochar plantation and institutional plantation have also been planned. 

 Around 1.5 lakh seedlings will be distributed among the residents of the town for planting.

 The divisional forest officer of Bolangir had earlier submitted a plan for the Rs 3-crore Green Titlagarh project. The Centre has sanctioned Rs 2 crore for three years of which Rs 25.66 lakh will be spent in the current financial year.

 The granite hills surrounding Titlagarh do not have much green cover, which makes temperatures soar in summer.

 A team from the Tropical Forest Research Institute, Bhopal, had surveyed the area last year and found that huge granite rocks, which are found just 15 cm below the soil surface and the absence of forest cover in the south-east and south-west parts of the town led to abnormal rise in temperature during summer.

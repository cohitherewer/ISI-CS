 Brahmin cook for acharya

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Chennai, Nov. 20: Food for the Kanchi seer ?is being cooked by a Brahmin, though he is our man,? the prosecution told Madras High Court today to refute the impression that his status and standing are being overlooked.

 Senior Supreme Court advocate K.T.S. Tulsi told Justice A.K. Rajan there had been no allegations that the seer is being ill-treated while in custody at the all-woman police station in the Kancheepuram district police office complex.

 Opposing Jayendra Saraswati?s petition to quash yesterday?s order by the first judicial magistrate placing him in police custody for four days, the counsel said the seer?s ?religious sentiments were being fully honoured? while in custody.

 To ensure that no baseless allegations are made later, ?we are very careful during the questioning and the entire interrogation of the seer by the investigating officers is being video recorded,? Tulsi told the court.

 Justifying the police custody, the counsel added: ?We are discovering some new facts with another accused (in the temple murder case) surrendering a few days back, which may require to be confronted to the petitioner (the seer).?

 Shortly afterwards, the chief investigating officer of the case filed a separate application in the high court urging it to direct the Kancheepuram magistrate to extend the seer?s police custody by one more day. Saraswati has been remanded in custody until 10.30 am on Monday.

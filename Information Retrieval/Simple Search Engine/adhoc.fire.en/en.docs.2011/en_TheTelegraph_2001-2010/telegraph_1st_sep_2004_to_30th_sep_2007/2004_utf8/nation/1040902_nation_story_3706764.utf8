 Amritsar, Sept. 1: Only assurances, no financial package.

 Manmohan Singhs first visit as Prime Minister to the town he grew up in disappointed the many thousands who thronged his rally today. The hoped-for financial assistance did not materialise.

 Praising the Guru Granth Sahib as the only scripture that speaks of the good of all mankind, Singh said he had come to pay his respects at the Golden Temple on the 400th anniversary of the books installation as a common man.

 The greatness of Indian democracy can be visualised by the fact that it has made a commoner like me hold such a high office in the country. I congratulate the people of Punjab on the holy books installation anniversary and also for their contribution to the country, the Prime Minister said.

 Singh promised help for spreading the Granths message across the world through a national committee and for beautifying Amritsar and the Golden Temple complex. He said the Centre had urged France, which has banned religious symbols in schools, to allow Sikhs to wear turbans.

 The Prime Minister said he would speak to defence minister Pranab Mukherjee about the demand that the army vacate the Gobindgarh fort and try to hand over relics allegedly seized during Operation Bluestar in 1984.

 Earlier, Singh visited the Golden Temple with his wife Gursharan Kaur and was presented a siropa (robe of honour) by head priest Puran Singh. He then visited Jallianwala Bagh nearby to pay his respects to those gunned down by British troops on April 13, 1919. He also prayed at the Durgiana Temple before addressing the rally at New Amritsar on the citys outskirts.

 Chief minister Amarinder Singh and his predecessor and Shiromani Akali Dal chief Parkash Singh Badal pressed for a financial package to turn the city into a tourist hub. Both were disappointed. Dal secretary Daljit Singh Cheema said: This is not the occasion for discussing the demands.

 Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who was greeted with the loudest applause, congratulated Indians on the anniversary of the Granth Sahibs installation. We have to imbibe the Granths teachings in a world that is constantly forgetting the importance of living together, he said. He added that he had tried his best to give Amritsar the funds it needed during his tenure as Prime Minister.

 The Dalai Lama, who shared the dais with singh and Vajpayee, spoke briefly about the significance of the holy book in the modern world. We have to learn its teachings of mutual tolerance, he said. 

 Priests from all communities sat on the stage and participated in the Granth Sahibs recitation.

 Even as lakhs of devotees thronged the temple, the celebrations lost some of their sheen as the original Granth, the Adi Granth compiled by Guru Arjan Dev, was not exhibited by his descendants, the Sodhis of Kartarpur.

 The family, which displays the book once a year at Kartarpur, turned down an SGPC request to send the book here. We tried our best to get the original Granth but failed. We hope the family will see reason and place it at the Golden Temple where it belongs, SGPC secretary Dalmegh Singh said.

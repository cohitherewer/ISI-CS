 Blamed for cheating, invigilators hit by bullets in the leg

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Imphal, Nov. 25: Known for its vigilantism against drug trafficking and educational malpractice, the militant Kanglei Yawol Kanna Lup (KYKL) of Manipur last night shot six examination invigilators in their legs for allegedly encouraging students to take recourse to unfair means to pass the test.

 Two women accused of doing the same were beaten up and warned of harsher punishment if they repeated the mistake, a spokesperson for the outfit said.

 Gun-wielding militants of the KYKL rounded up all eight invigilators and took them to an undisclosed location in the capital town. The six men in the group were segregated and shot in their legs. All six were admitted to the Regional Institute of Medical Sciences here late in the night.

 The KYKL claimed the invigilators were ?caught? assisting examinees at some National Open School examination centres in Imphal West and East districts. The examination got under way on November 17. 

 The spokesperson claimed the invigilators distributed photostat copies of answers and allowed impersonation of candidates. He said KYKL activists conducted surprise checks at the examination centres to ensure that nobody resorted to unfair means. ?It was during these inspections that the invigilators were caught red-handed.? 

 The outfit launched a campaign called Operation New Kangleipak a few years ago to cleanse the state?s education system. 

 It has since been keeping an eye on invigilators in every matriculation and higher secondary examination. The outfit?s standard punishment for encouraging the use of unfair means to pass examinations is a gunshot in the leg.

 Earlier this year, the KYKL asked a government school teacher to take voluntary retirement after declaring him guilty of dereliction of duty. 

 Two allegedly corrupt government employees were asked to do the same last year. Another senior official, I.S. Laishram, was abducted for a vigilante trial at a KYKL hideout. He had allegedly taken bribes during his tenure as the commissioner of education.

 A year ago, students took to the streets to extend support to their teachers, who had been ordered to retire from service by the KYKL. The outfit asked 17 teachers, who were on duty during the higher secondary examinations, to retire from service since they had failed to check cheating by students at their respective centres. More than 200 students had protested against the diktat in Thoubal district.

 The KYKL spokesperson said his organisation had asked all invigilators well in advance not to encourage the use of unfair means. 

 He said some invigilators took between Rs 4,000 and Rs 5,000 from candidates, promising to help them pass the examination.

 The National Open School system of education in Manipur has been under the scanner for quite some time. 

 Several students? organisations have been demanding that candidates who pass National Open School examinations be barred from academic courses in other schools and colleges.

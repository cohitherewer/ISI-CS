 Grenade attack on mosque

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Srinagar, Dec. 24: Two persons were killed and 34 injured in a grenade explosion in central Kashmir this afternoon .

 Police said militants lobbed a hand grenade at a party of the special operations group (SOG) of the state police posted outside a mosque in Pakherpora in Budgam district, 45 km from Srinagar. The injured include three members of the SOG.

 ?We had just left the mosque and there was a loud explosion. As I turned, I saw smoke going up and everyone around ran. I, too, rushed for cover and then stopped. I looked back and was shocked as I saw people lying on the ground crying for help. We took the injured to hospital,? said Abdul Rahman, a resident of Pakherpora.

 ?People were dispersing after the Friday prayers when militants hurled the grenade.... Riyaz Ahmad Sofi, 22, died on the spot while 35 others, including three policemen and 32 civilian bystanders, sustained splint injuries. The injured include the in-charge of the local SOG camp in Pakherpora town,? a senior police officer said.

 Seven injured civilians were taken to hospital in adjoining Pulwama, while one who was seriously hurt was brought to Srinagar. 

 A Congress activist, who the police said was standing near the site of the blast, escaped unhurt.

 Girls lured into Gulf flesh ring 

 Dubai(PTI): A network of agents and pimps are 

 allegedly luring Indian girls to Dubai for prostitution 

 after promising them jobs as housemaids. 

 Two such girls, one from Andhra Pradesh and another from Kerala, have been rescued and are waiting for travel documents to return home. ?Most of the agents are from Kerala and most of the girls are from Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Kerala,? an Indian consulate official said. 

 Dubai has 225 dance clubs, many of which employ Indian dancing girls who are changed every three months.

 The consulate is preparing a note for the Protector of Emigrants to check these agents. Several preventive measures are already there, but they ?exploit the loopholes and bring the girls on visit visas. Even minors are not spared?, the official said. ?Three months ago, a minor girl was rescued in pitiable condition.?

 The girls also hardly get any money as the lion?s share of their income is pocketed by the agents. 

 ?On January 18 this year, a girl landed in Sharjah and the very next day, she was arrested on charges of prostitution after she refused to comply,? he said. Her agent told police and the court that she was the brothel owner and he was only working for her. Believing the testimony, the girl from Andhra was sentenced to three years in jail, he added. 

 Such incidents are on the rise. At least 10 girls in Sharjah and another 10 in Dubai were sent to jail in August for the same offence. 

 Bakery retrial on Wednesday

 Mumbai (PTI): A special court has set 

 the stage for holding retrial in the Best Bakery case from 

 Wednesday. 

 The prosecution will, however, submit draft charges on Monday following an earlier directive of the court of designated judge Abhay Thipsay. 

 A fast-track court in Vadodara in Gujarat had acquitted 21 accused in the case after the witnesses turned hostile. Gujarat High Court had upheld the order.

 Later, Zahira Sheikh, the prime witness in the case, moved the Supreme Court with a plea for a retrial outside the state on the ground that she had been intimidated. 

 The apex court had on April 12 ordered Bombay High Court to set up the special court.

 Fifteen accused, lodged in the central prison here, will be produced before the judge on Wednesday to face the trial. One accused, on bail, has also been asked to remain present on that day. The rest are absconding.

 The special court has also asked prosecutor P.R. Vakil to frame charges against the absconders after they were arrested.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Letter vs footage in House

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 23: If the Opposition fished out a letter, the other side had a videotape in its armoury.

 Parliament today witnessed uproarious scenes over a letter from the Prime Minister?s Office seeking information on a case in which L.K. Advani was acquitted.

 With footage secretly filmed by news portal Tehelka also finding a mention in Parliament, the spotlight shifted away from Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Laloo Prasad Yadav even though his party was in the thick of action.

 As the National Democratic Alliance brandished copies of the letter written by a senior PMO official to the CBI, RJD and Left MPs responded with ammunition of their own.

 They focused on Tehelka?s allegations that BJP MLA Madhu Srivastava had paid Zahira Sheikh, a key witness in the Best Bakery case, Rs 18 lakh to change her testimony in court. The portal produced secretly filmed footage at a news conference yesterday to support its allegations.

 Even so, the NDA stuck to its guns. Targeting Manmohan Singh, the alliance MPs accused the Prime Minister of ?influencing? the CBI and demanded his resignation. The Left and RJD countered by saying Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi should resign instead since his associates had bribed Zahira and dared the BJP to defend him.

 Leader of the House Pranab Mukherjee dismissed the Opposition allegation that it was pressuring the CBI to reopen the case against Advani, saying it was the government?s ?legitimate right? to seek information about the legal position in any case.

 He reacted sharply when former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee said: ?It was a strange letter from the PMO and should not have been written. It is nothing but putting pressure on the CBI.?

 BJP deputy leader of the Lok Sabha V.K. Malhotra said: ?The letter could have been written only under the Prime Minister?s direction.?

 Defence minister Mukherjee responded by saying it was not ?fair? on Vajpayee?s part to refer to correspondence between the Prime Minister?s Office and the law ministry on the floor of the House. ?The PMO wrote the letter in order to ascertain the legal position on two revision petitions filed by witnesses in the case. The government has the legitimate right to do so,? he said. 

 ?The reference from the Prime Minister?s Office only requested clarification on the legal position about filing of revision petitions (by witnesses) and failure, if any, on the part of the prosecuting agency in taking timely action to move a higher court.

 ?The sum total of this correspondence is nothing more than eliciting information from the investigating agency. It is not a directive of any kind to any investigating agency and cannot be construed to amount to any manner of interfering in the working of the agency,? Mukherjee said.

 The issue sparked turmoil as soon as the House convened this morning for NDA members demanded an explanation over the PMO letter.

 The Tehelka expose gave the RJD ? smarting under the NDA attack on Laloo Prasad ? the chance to hit back at its detractors. ?You asked Laloo Yadav to resign because he had distributed hundreds of rupees. Now we are asking Narendra Modi to resign because his party distributed Rs 18 lakh as bribe,? RJD MP Devendra Prasad Yadav said.

 The NDA levelled the same charge 

 that the Congress raised until last May that the CBI was 

 being used to settle political scores.

 Stepson slur on ?Lady Luck?

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Lakshmi Parvati

Hyderabad, Dec. 13: Lakshmi Parvati, who was 

hailed as ?adrusta devata (Lady Luck)? by the Telugu Desam Party when she 

helped husband N.T. Rama Rao and his son-in-law N. Chandrababu Naidu win the 1994 

Assembly elections, continues her freefall into ignominy.

 A forgery and cheating case was registered against the widow of the Desam founder yesterday over the sale of a Banjara Hills Road no. 13 bungalow belonging to the former Andhra Pradesh chief minister.

 The case was filed in the court of the fifth metropolitan magistrate here by N. Ramakrishna, 41, the youngest son of the late actor-politician.

 Parvati, who was slammed as an ?evil force? within just nine months of the 1994 poll triumph when her husband was toppled as chief minister, has been accused of forging Rama Rao?s signature on an October 15, 1995 will, to give herself ownership of the flat.

 The Desam founder?s family says the house had been given to his youngest daughter N. Uma Maheshwari according to the original will, drawn up in early 1992.

 Ramakrishna, who holds the power of attorney over the property on behalf of his sister who lives in the US, had filed an eviction suit in 1999 saying his stepmother continued to be in ?illegal possession? of the house from the time his father died in January 1996.

 She even ran a political party, the Telugu Desam Party (LP), from there for a few years.

 Parvati, who is currently in Mysore and could not be reached for comments, is accused of underselling the property, which has a market price of Rs 2.5 crore, for Rs 1.3 crore to a third party on November 14 this year.

 She has been charged under Sections 420 (cheating), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating) and 471 (passing off a forged document as genuine) of the Indian Penal Code as well as Section 34, 156 and sub-section 3 of the CrPC.

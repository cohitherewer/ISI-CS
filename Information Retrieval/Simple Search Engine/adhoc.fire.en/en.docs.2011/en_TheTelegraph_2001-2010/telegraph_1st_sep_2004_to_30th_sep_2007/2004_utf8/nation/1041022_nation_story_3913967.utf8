 Paswan eyes minority votes 

 KAY BENEDICT

 Ram Vilas Paswan

 New Delhi, Oct. 21: Ram Vilas Paswan today unveiled his strategy for the Bihar Assembly polls due in four months, with the major contenders competing for crucial Muslim and upper-caste votes.

 The Union steel, chemicals and fertilisers minister is crafting a ?DM (Dalit-Muslim)? vote bank to counter Laloo Prasad Yadav?s assiduously cultivated ?MY (Muslim-Yadav)? combination.

 Paswan, the Lok Janshakti Party chief, is planning to field a large number of Muslim candidates and is currently on a drive to recruit more leaders from the community. He knows that the only way to humble the Rashtriya Janata Dal chief is to wean away a sizeable chunk of the state?s 15 per cent Muslim votes.

 The LJP is wooing former BJP MP Anwar-ul Haq who quit the party two days ago protesting against ?hardliner? .K. Advani?s appointment as BJP president.

 Paswan has already inducted some upper-caste leaders into his party and feels the forward castes ? bitterly opposed to the RJD ? will not waste their votes on the BJP or the Janata Dal (United) since he is becoming the ?nucleus? of the anti-Laloo Prasad front.

 Talking to reporters at his house here today, Paswan said it would be ?DM versus MY?, with some help from the upper-castes. ?No caste is allergic to Paswan,? he said. He added that if he gave tickets to Bhumihars, Rajputs and Kurmis, he could arrange a formidable winning combination.

 ?I have 18,000 to 20,000 base votes (Dalits) in several constituencies,? the minister said, implying that with some Muslim and forward-caste votes, his party could emerge the single largest.

 The LJP is thus trying to forge a third front to take on the RJD ? presently allied with the Congress and the CPM ? and the NDA.

 Ruling out any poll tie-up with the NDA, Paswan said the recent byelection to the Madhepura Lok Sabha consti-tuency amply demonstrated that the BJP-led alliance was not an alternative in Bihar.

 Party sources said Mulayam Singh Yadav?s Samajwadi Party, which is trying to get a foothold in Bihar, has offered to forge an understanding with the LJP.

 The Samajwadis have also approached the Dal (U) to forge a front. Paswan?s party said it could have an electoral pact with the Dal (U) only if it quit the NDA, a condition that Nitish Kumar rejected today.

 The LJP chief indicated there was no question of his returning to the NDA and hinted Bihar could go the way of Jammu and Kashmir, Karnataka and Maharashtra. 

 The Congress formed the governments in the first two states with regional parties, the PDP and the Janata Dal (Secular). In Maharashtra, the Congress alliance with the NCP has just returned to power.

 The LJP, Paswan said, would go it alone in the 243 Assembly seats in Bihar despite being a partner in the United Progressive Alliance.

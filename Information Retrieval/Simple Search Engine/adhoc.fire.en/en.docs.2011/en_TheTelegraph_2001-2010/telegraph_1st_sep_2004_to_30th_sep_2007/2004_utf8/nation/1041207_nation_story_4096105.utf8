 Letter slur in Kanchi case 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Chennai, Dec. 6: After the lady come the letters and the lakhs.

 Stunning a packed courtroom, the prosecution today alleged that Kanchi seer Jayendra Saraswati had received 39 letters from the temple manager he is accused of conspiring to murder.

 The Kanchi mutt had also withdrawn Rs 50 lakh from various banks soon after Shankar Raman?s murder, strengthening suspicion that they could be ?towards payment for the murder?, it claimed.

 The allegations, coming a week after the prosecution turned around on the seer?s ?contacts? with a woman, came during a hearing of the seer?s bail plea in Madras High Court. Senior Supreme Court advocate K.T.S. Tulsi said these were ?new facts? towards unearthing the ?motive? for the crime.

 Tulsi said Raman?s letters, in which he threatened to expose the goings-on in the mutt, had been written over a two-year period from May 2002 to August 2004. Raman was murdered on the Sri Varadaraja Perumal Temple premises in September.

 Thirty-three of the 39 letters had been written after the 2002 attack on Radhakrishnan, a former mutt associate, he said.

 Asked how the prosecution had got hold of the letters, Tulsi initially said ?copies? were recovered from Raman?s house. 

 Quizzed by defence counsel I. Subramaniam on the genuineness of the copies, he said they were ?originals? provided by one of the seer?s assistants.

 ?Two of the letters were recovered from the residence of the partner of the second accused (Chennai-based builder Ravi Subramaniam),? Tulsi added.

 He told the court the prosecution was ready to furnish the list of telephone calls ? with details of dates, time and duration ? made by some of the key accused to the acharya.

 ?We have further information on withdrawal of cash from ICICI Bank, Indian Overseas Bank and Indian Bank after the murder and we find as much as Rs 50 lakh has been withdrawn from certain accounts in cash by way of bearer cheques on the name of somebody.?

 Tulsi declined to give out details of the bank accounts to the defence counsel. 

 ?This is the first time a defence counsel is being made a Dhritarashtra as in the Mahabharata,? Subramaniam said.

 ?Was the money withdrawn from the mutt account or from the Trust?? he asked. Tulsi said the prosecution was not obliged to give details.

 Subramaniam said if the money was withdrawn from the Trust ?there was nothing wrong as the Trust had a number of commercial activities?.

 ?They (the prosecution) are merely creating post-arrest materials as they have no materials and it is not a bona fide investigation,? he said.

 Judge to probe farmer firing

 New Delhi (PTI): The Rajasthan government 

 has ordered a judicial probe into the police firing on agitating 

 farmers in Sriganganagar district that killed three persons 

 on Wednesday.

 A compensation of Rs 5 lakh each to the next of kin of the victims and Rs 1 lakh each to those injured have been announced.

 An emergency meeting of the state cabinet ordered the inquiry by a sitting judge of the high court, an official release said here.

 Chief minister Vasundhara Raje and Sriganganagar MP Nikhil Chand, who attended the BJP?s national council session, were present at the meeting.

 A two-member committee of public works minister Rajendra Rathore and irrigation minister Samwar Lal has been constituted to take stock of the situation, it said.

 The chief minister cancelled her Jharkhand tour scheduled for Thursday and left for Jaipur, the release added.

 Three farmers were killed and six injured in pitched battles between agitating farmers and police on Wednesday, prompting authorities to clamp curfew on two towns and call the army.

 Mercy plea to Saudi king

 New Delhi: The All India Catholic Union 

 has urged the Centre to secure the release of an Indian 

 sentenced to 300 lashes and 10 months in a Saudi Arabian 

 jail for ?possessing pornographic material, selling alcohol 

 and spreading Christianity?, reports our special correspondent.

 It has also sent a mercy petition to Saudi King Fahd pleading that Brian ?Connor, who hails from Karnataka, be freed.

 The Catholic Union has also urged President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam to intercede on ?Connor?s behalf.

 A Union release said the Indian was arrested in Saudi Arabia last March and sentenced last Wednesday. He was arrested by the Muttawa (Saudi religious police) and ?tortured? during his captivity.

 In late September, ?Connor was taken to a court for a 90-minute hearing. The charges against him were ?selling alcohol and possession of pornography in addition to spreading Christianity?, said John Dayal, national president of the Union, in his petitions to the Centre, Kalam and Fahd.

 The petition said the Union felt the charges against ?Connor were not valid even though it agreed he was a practising Christian. The letter adds that the arrest, his experience in jail and the harsh sentence have caused deep concern among Christians in India and abroad.

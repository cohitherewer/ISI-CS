 BJP, Sena see turnout hope 

 CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA

 Mumbai, Oct. 15: The BJP-Shiv Sena camp, despite the exit poll predictions, is upbeat about government formation because of the large voter turnout.

 ?We are confident of getting 140 seats,? says BJP spokesperson Keshav Upadhyay. ?The voter turnout of 63 per cent will help us a lot.?

 The Maharashtra Election Commission has said the Assembly elections on Wednesday witnessed a 63.21 per cent turnout of the 6.59-crore electorate after compilation of data from constituencies spread over 35 districts.

 The BJP spokesperson said that this was a 10 per cent increase over the turnout in the Lok Sabha elections and would prove crucial for a greater margin for the BJP-Sena alliance, as it has been proved that such increase in voter turnout is always prompted by the anti-incumbency factor.

 Sena spokesperson Kiran Wadivkar also names the turnout on the top of factors that he claims will put the Sena-BJP alliance in power.

 ?The turnout will go in our favour,? he said. ?The percentage is high because the new voters this time were enlisted by our workers,? he said.

 Sena MP Sanjay Nirupam agreed, mentioning Mayavati?s strong presence this time and the greater number of rebels in the Congress-NCP camp as the other factors in favour of the Sena-BJP.

 Nirupam said that 40 seats for the Congress-NCP would be affected in western Maharashtra alone because of rebel candidates. He said it would be a ?neck-and-neck? fight but the anti-incumbency factor in rural Maharashtra and the presence of the Samajwadi Party and the BSP would make a big dent in the Congress-NCP votes. 

 ?In a close contest like this, the BSP and the SP can take away about 1,000 votes in many seats which may make the difference, because the winning margin would be generally 1,000-5,000 votes in many seats,? he said.

 Governor?s diktat

 The BJP and the Sena said that they are to submit in writing the response to the fiat from governor Mohammad Fazal that all parties should inform him by Monday whether they intend to continue with their pre-poll alliances after polls. 

 But both parties said that they were not unduly worried about the implications.

 Fazal?s missive, the first such sent by a governor before even the counting has begun, seems to have been prompted by apprehensions of widespread horse trading, as all assessments have pointed to a hung Assembly. 

 But the parties feel the order is pointless in a way, as even in case of a hung Assembly, all alliances are likely to be decided by Monday.

 ?The Sena-BJP has only one other party as its ally, the Shvetkari Sangathana, but its candidates have also fought under the Sena symbol. There is not much to add,? a BJP spokesperson said. ?Even if there is, we will be able to submit our response well within the deadline,? he added.

 SC no to Cauvery tribunal recast

New Delhi (PTI): In a setback to Karnataka, the Supreme Court 

on Tuesday dismissed a plea for reconstitution of the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal 

and paved the way for the proposed visit of two of its members to the river basin.

 The bench of Justices Ruma Pal and Arun Kumar dismissed the petition filed by the Gandhi Sahitya Sangh Trust, which was supported by the Karnataka government, and imposed cost on it.

 The court on September 10 had virtually lifted the stay on the decision of two members of the tribunal to visit the river basin by refusing to extend its August 20 interim order in this regard.

 The public interest litigation filed by the non-government organisation had challenged the decision of the two members, who despite the objection of the chairman of the tribunal, had insisted on visiting the basin. Karnataka had supported the petitioner and said such conduct of the members had led to the people losing confidence in the tribunal and pleaded for its reconstitution.

 However, Tamil Nadu had termed the petitioner a proxy for the state of Karnataka and accused the latter of resorting to delaying tactics to frustrate the efforts of the tribunal to give an award on the water dispute.

 The court had on August 20 directed the tribunal to defer by 10 days its visit to the river basin after the petitioner expressed ?deep distress? over the functioning of the tribunal, which has not been able to complete its work for nearly 15 years. The proposed visit was to begin from August 23.

 Uma denies ego battle

 Lucknow, Dec. 18: Uma Bharti today said if her suspension from the BJP is revoked, it would be a decisive ideological action by the party.

 ?Although my differences with the party leadership appear to be a simple case of indiscipline and insubordination, let me clarify that I was not fighting any ego battle. My difference were based on ideological grounds and my return to the party, if it happens, would mean the party?s support for my ideological stand,? said the former Madhya Pradesh chief minister.

 ?I don?t go to Kedarnath frequently after getting into a bad mood,? she said, adding that the perception that she is a mercurial woman is a creation of the media. ?There are more ill-tempered politicians in the country than me,? she said.

 Uma, who was in the city before heading to Ayodhya in the afternoon, said she has been associated with VHP programmes for long and could not distance herself from the organisation now.

 ?The direction of my work is unlikely to be altered by wherever I am ? in the party or out of it, as chief minister or as an ordinary worker of the BJP. Main aisie hun (I am like this),? Uma said a day after party president L.K. Advani said in an interview to a news channel that her return to the BJP is not being ruled out.

 However, the former chief minister and senior BJP leaders gave each other a miss, though scores of BJP Mahila Morcha members and BJP youth activists thronged Lucknow station when Uma arrived this morning. The senior leaders were also conspicuous by their absence at a seminar and during her interaction with Mahila Morcha members and party loyalists.

 Uma did not visit the party office and left for Ayodhya after attending the seminar on the politics of ideology organised at the Press Club and meeting the media.

 The sadhvi stressed that her priorities were ensuring food for the poor and building the Ram temple at Ayodhya, which even senior leaders such as M. Venkaiah Naidu and Jaswant Singh have avoided talking about when they were here recently.

 ?The Ram temple has to be built there at the site in Ayodhya,? she said. Uma emphasised that only the Ram temple movement can challenge caste politics in Uttar Pradesh, which she called her karma bhoomi.

 In Ayodhya, Uma received Ram?s baraat, which arrived from Nepal this afternoon. She will offer prayers at Hanumangarhi tomorrow before finalising her plans for the proposed tour of Varanasi, Allahabad and other parts of the state.

 Earlier, in Lucknow, the former chief minister stressed the need for a back-to-the-basics programme. ?No one has ever found out if the people of a constituency could be provided two meals a day, whether a farmer?s son has got a textbook or a slate to write on,? she said at the seminar.

 ?The yardsticks of economic growth came to be frequently measured by other factors,? Uma said in an oblique reference to the stress laid by the National Democratic Alliance government on the sensex as a standard of growth. In this context, she cited the starvation deaths in Andhra Pradesh and spoke of a boy in Uttaranchal carrying loads like a mare.

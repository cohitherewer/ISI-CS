 Riots draft bill to go on Net

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 28: The Centre plans to initiate a public debate on communal violence by putting on the Internet the draft of a bill meant to deal with communal disturbances and killings.

 Union home minister Shivraj Patil today said the government wants people?s views on the bill. People can get the details of the bill from the Internet and send their views to the government, he said.

 ?We want to bring a law which is really effective and will remain in the statute books for many, many years to come. The bill will be in accordance with the wishes of the people, their demands and opinions,? said Patil.

 The home ministry has prepared a note that has been forwarded to the law ministry, which is drafting the bill. 

 ?The draft will be put on the Internet. We will hold seminars and encourage a countrywide debate before finalising the bill,? said the home minister.

 The Gujarat riots of 2002 and the dubious prosecution of some of the accused are the main reasons that have prompted the United Progressive Alliance government to draft the bill. The Supreme Court has repeatedly rapped the Narendra Modi government for not bringing the guilty to book and not providing relief to the victims.

 However, the bill, as outlined by the home minister, goes beyond the Gujarat killings and seeks to encompass the larger issue of communal violence ? its definition and the accountability of the IAS and IPS officers who are in charge of areas where violence breaks out. The bill will provide for the stringent punishment of offenders and compensation for the victims of violence.

 The Centre believes that communal disturbances should be defined clearly to separate them from general law and order problems. The bill proposes the setting up of special courts to deal with such incidents.

 The common minimum programme of the Congress-led government at the Centre talks about the strict enforcement of law to deal with communal violence. 

 The document says the government will ?preserve, protect and promote social harmony and enforce the law without fear or favour to deal with obscurantist and fundamentalist elements who seek to disturb social amity and peace?.

 The law proposed by the Centre will outline the parameters of investigation into communal incidents and decide the authority ? Centre or state ? that will conduct the investigations. It will also decide the timeframe for this and lay down the rehabilitation measures for the victims.

 The Centre, Patil said, will also set up a multi-member committee, including people who frame laws and implement them, to seek their views on the bill. ?The committee can suggest methods, devices, rules and regulations that the government can adopt to meet the situation,? he said.

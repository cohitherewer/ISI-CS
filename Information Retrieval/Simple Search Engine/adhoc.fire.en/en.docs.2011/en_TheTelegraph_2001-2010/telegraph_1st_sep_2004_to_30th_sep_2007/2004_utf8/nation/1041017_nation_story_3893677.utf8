 Victors reap rain gain

 CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA

 Mumbai, Oct. 16: Was it the weather?

 BJP leaders here attribute the poll verdict to two reasons: one, the Congress-NCP alliance which, they say, managed to consolidate the anti-BJP-Sena votes and second, overestimating the role of ?spoilers? like the BSP and Samajwadi Party.

 But even as the Congress gloats over the magic of Sonia Gandhi?s ?sacrifice? and her tours criss-crossing the length and breadth of Maharashtra, and the NCP over the many meetings Sharad Pawar addressed, many feel the rains before the polls managed to negate the anti-incumbency factor in the dry regions of Maharashtra, including Vidarbha.

 The Sena-BJP also failed to convert the widespread rebellion in Congress-NCP ranks into a winning plank and couldn?t raise any issue of their own, observers felt.

 The losers are yet to recover from the verdict. BJP leaders in Delhi said the tally was ?shocking? and fingers were pointed at Pramod Mahajan, the architect of the party?s poll strategy. But his colleague Arun Jaitley said: ?No one person is responsible.?

 Mahajan said at a news conference here that he did not yet know all the factors responsible for the loss. ?I wish I knew what the reasons were,? he said.

 But accepting the defeat gracefully, he named Vidarbha and Mumbai as the two regions that dented the BJP-Sena?s prospects.

 The Congress-NCP won 30 of the 66 seats in Vidarbha against 31 in the last Assembly, but the Sena-BJP could only retain the 30 seats it won when the Sonia-led party triumphed in 26 seats.

 In Mumbai, the Congress-NCP won 18 seats against the 12 it had won in 1999. 

 not counting ?our rebels?, as a Congress leader put it. There were reports that the party faced rebellion in 30 to 35 constituencies.

 In Mumbai, the Congress-NCP won 18 seats against the 12 it had won in 1999. The Sena won 20 seats in the region the last time as against 15 now.

 Mahajan said the alliance?s performance was better in western Maharashtra and Marathwada, but the loss of 8 to 10 seats for both the BJP and Sena had proved crucial. ?Those 20 seats made all the difference,? he said.

 The BJP leader felt some wrong candidates had been selected. ?About 20 of the BJP?s sitting MLAs have lost,? he added.

In Delhi, top BJP leaders went into a huddle at former 

Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee?s residence once it became clear their alliance 

was not in the hunt. L.K. Advani, Jaswant Singh, Jaitley and Sushma Swaraj were 

among those who attended the nearly two-hour long meeting. The leaders are expected 

to meet again next week to analyse the results region-wise once Mahajan returns 

to the capital.

 At the news conference in Mumbai Sena leader Narayan Rane, who won from Malvan and was seen as a chief ministerial candidate, denied the rebellion in his party had affected the performance. He said rebel candidates made a difference only in Chiplun and Vile Parle.

 Rane also denied that cousins Raj and Uddhav Thackeray were involved in a tussle for supremacy or that this contributed to the defeat.

 A Congress leader said the Sena-BJP lost because they did not have an electoral issue. ?Raking Veer Savarkar or imitating Congress leaders doesn?t work any more,? he said. ?But what issues did the Congress-NCP have,? is Rane?s counter.

 Perhaps Maharashtrians voted against the alliance that played up the more trivial issues. It appears time for Atma-Chintan, Part II.

 SC nod to loan lapse sack

 New Delhi (PTI): The Supreme Court has 

 upheld the dismissal of a manager of the State Bank of India 

 for sanctioning a loan to his wife though he realised his 

 mistake and did not encash the bank draft issued in her 

 name.

 Terming it as a breach of trust and discipline, a bench of Justices K.G. Balakrishnan and A.R. Lakshmanan said ?acting beyond one?s authority is by itself a breach of discipline and trust and a misconduct?.

 The charge against the manager, Ganesh Santaram Sirur, was very serious and grave as rules prohibit a bank manager from sanctioning loans to his wife or his relatives or to any partner, the bench said.

 Noticing the irregularity, the bank had conducted an inquiry and the disciplinary authority, on the basis of the inquiry report, ordered reduction of the bank manager?s substantive salary from Rs 4,020 to Rs 3,900.

 Aggrieved by the punishment, Sirur moved the appellate authority for reconsideration of his case. But the appellate authority ordered termination of his services.

 The manager lost in his appeal before Bombay High Court and had moved the Supreme Court.

 Littering fine in Delhi

 New Delhi (PTI): Delhi High Court has 

 directed the Municipal Corporation of Delhi to slap fines 

 on those throwing rubbish at inappropriate places.

 A division bench of Chief Justice B.C. Patel and Justice B.D. Ahmed also exhorted people to approach the court against the civic body if plastic waste and garbage are found near their houses and in residential colonies.

 The order came on a public interest litigation filed by V.K. Jain of a non-government organisation, Tapas, seeking direction to civic agencies for proper management of 8,000 metric tonnes of garbage produced everyday in the capital.

 The court asked the Delhi government and the municipal corporation to give adequate publicity to the provisions of the Recycled Plastic Manufacturing Rules, 1999, (amended in 2003) and the Environment Protection Act, 1986, that apply to such cases. 

 The court also asked the municipal corporation to provide separate garbage bins for bio-degradable and non-bio-degradable recyclable waste all over Delhi. The bins should be covered properly so that animals do not feed from them, it added.

 Porn accused remanded

 Jammu (PTI): The chief judicial magistrate, 

 Jammu, on Saturday ordered 14 days? judicial remand for

 involving former Miss Jammu Anara Gupta.

 Miners drown

 Madurai (PTI): Two illegal sand miners 

 drowned in the Vadamalapuram river on Saturday while trying 

 to flee after mistaking a bather for a vigilance official.

 the river in panic. The tractor driver and another person 

 escaped. The bodies have been recovered and sent for post-mortem.

 St Xavier?s relics

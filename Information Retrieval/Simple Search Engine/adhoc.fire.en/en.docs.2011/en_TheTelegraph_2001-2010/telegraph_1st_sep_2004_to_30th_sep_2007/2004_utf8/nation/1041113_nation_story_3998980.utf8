 Welfare scam bomb ticks in heartland

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 Lucknow, Nov. 12: The social welfare delivery pipeline ? a key area of concern for the Prime Minister ? has sprung a multi-crore leak in Uttar Pradesh, channelling thousands of quintals of foodgrain to the black market. 

 The food-for-work programme in the state has been sullied by revelations that top officials and middlemen conspired to siphon grain meant for the welfare scheme to the black market.

 According to initial estimates, grain worth Rs 15,000 crore could have been diverted from the Antodaya Yojana over the last five years. If the figure is confirmed, it will make the scandal bigger than the fodder scam in Bihar.

 Initiatives such as the food-for-work programme ? where labourers are rewarded in kind for work on development projects so that poverty can be tackled without too much of a strain on the exchequer ? have been given pride of place in the central coalition?s common minimum programme.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, too, has been stressing the importance of an efficient delivery system for such schemes to succeed.

 The Left parties have taken up the scam with the Uttar Pradesh government, prompting the administration to suspend the district magistrate of Lakhimpur Kheri, bordering Pilibhit district near the Nepal border, in connection with the scandal.

 State rural development minister Rajpal Tyagi is learnt to have sent a directive to all district magistrates to register FIRs whenever they get a whiff of the scam. ?The government is aware of the issue and there is nothing to hide. We are looking into the matter,? he said.

 Official sources said in eastern Uttar Pradesh?s Basti district alone this year, 7,135 quintals of rice and wheat were sold in the black market.

 The rip-off came to light after 70 truckloads of rice meant for distribution among labourers were lifted from the Food Corporation of India (FCI) in March.

 However, when the FCI demanded payment for the grain and a project director refused to verify the stock register, a probe was ordered. 

 It was detected that a section of officers from the regional food controller?s office and the District Rural Development Agency (DRDA) had connived to sell the grain in the black market. 

 The food controller?s office is responsible for procuring the foodgrain, while the DRDA is in charge of distribution.

 CPI state secretary Ashoke Mishra, whose party is supporting the Mulayam Singh Yadav government, said that in just five districts ? Gorakhpur, Azamgarh, Jhansi, Varanasi and Basti ? foodgrain worth Rs 10,000 crore had been sold.

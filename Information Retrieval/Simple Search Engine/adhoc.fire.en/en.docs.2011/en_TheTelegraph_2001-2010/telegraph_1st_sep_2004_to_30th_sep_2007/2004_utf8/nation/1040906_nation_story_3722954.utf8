 Lunch tickles Pak pipeline taste buds

 PRANAY SHARMA

 New Delhi, Sept. 5: When two old friends meet tomorrow over lunch, it could lay the table for an unexpected confidence-building measure in India-Pakistan relations. 

 Petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar will play host to Pakistani foreign minister Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri. Aiyar and Kasuri know each other since their days in Cambridge many years ago.

 The lunch comes against the backdrop of a formal Pakistan offer to be part of the proposed Indo-Iranian gas pipeline. Delhi has agreed to consider the offer, but much more might emerge when the two meet.

 Aiyar has been one of the main votaries of the line that Pakistans inclusion in the project would be beneficial to India as well as the region. He had also written to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on this.

 Unlike the previous NDA government, the Congress-led coalition has not been averse to roping in Pakistan. Foreign minister K. Natwar Singh has said Delhi is willing to consider the proposal, provided Islamabad gives security and international guarantees.

 Kasuris meeting this evening with Atal Bihari Vajpayee was cancelled as the former Prime Minister was keeping indifferent health.

 But Kasuri met Opposition leader and former deputy Prime Minister .K. Advani. The meeting is being seen as Islamabads attempt at assessing the extent of the Oppositions support for the peace process.

 Advani reportedly told him that the BJP-led alliance was committed to the peace process. Advani referred to the fact that it was the previous government that had invited Pervez Musharraf to the Agra summit, even though most of the world was then not ready to accept the dictator as the leader of Pakistan.

 But the former deputy Prime Minister pointed out that for the peace process to succeed, it was essential that Pakistan delivers on its commitment to stop cross-border terrorism. This, he reminded Kasuri, was the commitment given by Musharraf in the joint statement that he signed with Vajpayee on January 6 in Islamabad.

 Later in the evening, Kasuri attended a dinner hosted by Natwar Singh. Tomorrow, he and Singh will again meet along with their delegations to firm up the joint statement and steps the two sides could announce.

 Pakistan has agreed to host a made in India business exhibition early next year. An expert team from Islamabad will also be here to interact with their Indian counterparts to find ways of strengthening economic and trade ties.

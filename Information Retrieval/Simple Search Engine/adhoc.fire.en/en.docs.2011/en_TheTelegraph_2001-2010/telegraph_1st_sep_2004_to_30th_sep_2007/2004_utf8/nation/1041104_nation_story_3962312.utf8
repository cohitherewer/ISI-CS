 Naxalite growth finger at cops

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 3: Left-wing extremism, insurgency in the Northeast and terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir figured prominently at the three-day annual directors-general of police conference that began today.

 Naxalites had not only remained ?deeply entrenched? in their strongholds but were sucking new areas into their vortex, Intelligence Bureau chief A.K. Doval said. He attributed their spread in 143 districts across 12 states to ?continued neglect of these regions?.

 Home minister Shivraj Patil, who inaugurated the meet that will review internal security and think up suitable strategies, acknowledged the ?serious threat?.

 Naxalite violence, he said, had increased by 8.5 per cent, resulting in 6.5 per cent more deaths. The menace, however, must be tackled on the political, economic and security fronts, he emphasised.

 The security officers appeared worried at the merger of the People?s War and the Maoist Communist Centre to form the Communist Party of India (Maoist), which recently held peace talks with the Andhra Pradesh government.

 The ascendancy of the Maoists of Nepal was an ?added matter of concern?, the IB chief said.

 Doval dismissed the myth that the striking abilities of Northeast militant outfits had been dented.

 Referring to the agitation in Manipur following Thangjam Manorama?s death and people?s call for the repeal of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, he said this carried ?special significance? as underground outfits had tried to leverage a section of civil society to undermine the rule of law.

 Patil cautioned that any counter-insurgency strategy for the Northeast would have to consider the region?s mosaic of cultures, economic underdevelopment and perceived remoteness.

 Recent terror attacks in Jammu and Kashmir, including that on National Conference chief Omar Abdullah, will be taken up at the meeting because of militants? perceived technological progress.

 Patil will visit the state for three days this weekend.

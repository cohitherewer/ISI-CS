 Cry for Delhi role in Lanka

 R. VENKATARAMAN

 New Delhi, Oct. 30: Several Eelam organisations today urged India to renew its ?approach and intervention? in Sri Lanka?s ethnic Tamil problem by isolating the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam and its chief Velupillai Prabhakaran, the main accused in Rajiv Gandhi?s assassination.

 The Organisation for Eelam Refugees Rehabilitation, the Eelam People?s Democratic Party and the Protection of Tamils of Eelam from Genocide were among the outfits that issued this call today.

 Making the appeal were S.C. Chandrahasan, son of the ?Mahatma Gandhi of Ceylon? Father S.C. Chelvanayakam and the founder leader of the Refugees outfit and Protection of Tamils organisation, and Douglas Devananda, the Democratic Party chief and a Sri Lankan central minister.

 Addressing a convention here today organised jointly by the Centre for National Renaissance, Chandrahasan and Devananda urged the Congress-led government to take up Prabhakaran?s extradition with Sri Lanka.

 Devananda said a solution to the Tamil problem was possible only ?without Prabhakaran? as ?he would not want any solution to succeed as his importance would be reduced in a multi-party democracy?. The minister said the LTTE chief would not allow Norwegian peace efforts to succeed and would use peace talks only to strengthen his rebel outfit.

 The ?conference on India?s Sri Lanka policy? drafted a resolution calling for ?rejecting the concept that the LTTE can be the sole person/agency of the minority Tamils? and ?called upon the international community to ensure that any peace talks in Sri Lanka take into account the interests of all parties in the divide?.

 It added: ?Whatever solution is found, India should ensure that the assassination of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi is not forgotten, but all the accused are brought to justice under the law.?

 The conference said in another resolution that ?the international community, India in particular, should assist the Sri Lanka government to ensure that the essential peaceful environment prevails to implement a federal constitution. Hence, any outfit or organisation that seeks to block the implementation of such a constitution or disrupt the peaceful environment should be treated as a terrorist organisation (read LTTE) and dealt as such by the international community within the framework of the UN resolutions on terrorism?.

 In a third resolution the conference said India should work closely with Sri Lankan refugees in India to prepare for their return to the island. It added that Delhi should facilitate the refugees? safe rehabilitation so that they could prosper.

 Asian Age editor M.J. Akbar, The Hindu editor . Ram, former foreign secretary Salman Haidar and Centre for National Renaissance chairman Subramanian Swamy spoke at the conference and adopted the resolution.

 D.R. Kartikeyan, chief of the special task force that probed the Rajiv assassination, said that ?extradition of Prabhakaran should not be a precondition to participation of India in the peace process and positive intervention in the imbroglio?. He added: ?There is something beyond the LTTE and Prabhakaran and that is the Tamil issue in the islands decades of conflict.?

 Former Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar was to deliver the valedictory address but could not make it as he was ill.

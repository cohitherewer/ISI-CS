 Industry behind Baazee boss

 B.R. SRIKANTH

 Narayana Murthy

 Bangalore, Dec. 21: More than a thousand infotech professionals signed an online petition to Manmohan Singh as the industry rallied behind Baazee CEO Avnish Bajaj, who was granted bail today after his arrest last week in connection with the sex-clip scandal.

 A top industry leader also underlined the need to create a ?legal framework to suit the electronic age?.

 ?We must spend some time for framing the laws and educate people on them before taking drastic action. I don?t know the details of this case, but we must create a framework where everybody understands the rules of the game,? N.R. Narayana Murthy, chairman of Infosys Technologies, told reporters on the sidelines of a conference.

 The online campaign to the Prime Minister, signed by more than 1,500 professionals, echoed Narayana Murthy. The petition, initiated by Mahesh Murthy, CEO of Passion Fund, a tech-investment and support firm, sought clarity on e-commerce transactions in India.

 ?The arrest of Bajaj is a travesty of cyber-law and e-commerce. This is not just to gather support for Bajaj?s immediate release but also raise the people?s and government?s awareness on issues relating to e-commerce,? the signatories said. Such steps, like Bajaj?s arrest, would prompt potential investors to look at India with doubt about its ability to offer ?a strong, fair law that protects the interests of Internet and other technology-driven businesses?, they said.

 Rajesh Jain, an IIT Mumbai graduate who now heads a dotcom, said the probe into the scandal should continue but the sale of the video clips on the online trading site baazee.com ?in no way implicates? Bajaj. The clips showed two students engaged in a sexual act.

 The National Association for Software Service Companies (Nasscom) suggested caution on issues connected with the IT industry. 

 ?As a global, mature, and responsible technology industry and the most attractive destination for services, we need to ensure that we do not send out the wrong signals to global customers and investors. While the law must take its own course ? without favour or fear ? such a peremptory arrest in a case like this is not only an extreme and completely unnecessary step, it verges on Draconian measures that do not fit into our self-image as a civilised, modern democracy,? Nasscom president Kiran Karnik said in a statement.

 Subrata Bagchi, co-founder and chief operating officer of MindTree Consulting, however, said the issues involved transcended e-commerce. ?We must handle it as a human tragedy and try to heal it because it was a mistake of juvenile minds,? he said.

 IIMs pay Rs 1.8 cr to shed elite tag

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 3: Five 

 Indian institutes of management have announced a grant of 

 Rs 1.8 crore as scholarship to help poor students get admission 

 in the countrys premier business schools.

 The decision came in the wake of growing criticism that the B-schools are elitist in their approach to admitting students and do not give enough scholarships to the needy and talented.

 After Arjun Singh took over as human resource development minister, the scholarship scheme was expanded and restructured to cover students whose annual family income is up to Rs 2 lakh.

 This is in line with the United Progressive Alliance governments common minimum programme, the HRD ministry said.

 The five IIMs will disburse Rs 179,69,757 to 255 students under a need-based financial assistance programme.

 IIM Calcutta has received 80 applications for need-based financial assistance for the year 2004-2005. The institute has extended the date for submission of (scholarship) applications at the request of the students, a note issued by the ministry said.

 IIM Lucknow, always at the forefront of disbursing scholarships, has handed 101 students Rs 48,68,013.

 IIM Ahmedabad has caught up in the scholarship race by handing Rs 69,78,244 to 79 students. Next is Bangalore, which has given scholarships worth Rs 53,83,500 to 56 students.

 The less well-heeled Indore and Kozhikode IIMs come lower on the list, with the former disbursing Rs 5 lakh among 10 students and the latter Rs 2.4 lakh among nine students.

 But that is not all. IIMs Bangalore, Indore and Kozhikode are considering more applications. Indore is considering 42 more applications involving Rs 21 lakh, the HRD ministry said.

 The B-schools expanded their scholarship schemes after a face-off with former HRD minister Murli Manohar Joshi who issued a fiat for an 80 per cent fee-cut on the grounds that poor students could not afford the exorbitant fees.

 After taking charge, Singh defused the stand-off by scrapping Joshis order and leaving the fee structure to the IIMs. He, however, asked the institute chairpersons and directors at a meeting on June 29 to ensure that no meritorious student is denied access because of financial constraints.

 The coalitions common minimum programme says the government should respect the autonomy of institutions of higher education.

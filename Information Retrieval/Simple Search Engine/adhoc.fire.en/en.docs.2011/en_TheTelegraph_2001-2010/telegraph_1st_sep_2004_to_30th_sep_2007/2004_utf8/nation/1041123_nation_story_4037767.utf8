The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 CEO is out but not down

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, Nov. 22: Farmer-friendly chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy does not want to be called CEO of Andhra Pradesh Inc., but the man he dethroned is still acting as one.

 N. Chandrababu Naidu, whose Telugu Desam Party tumbled out of power in the elections earlier this year, is leaving on a four-day visit to Pakistan to take part in an international seminar at the Institute of Asia Studies and Management on December 1.

 Naidu said Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf will also participate in the seminar and added that he would have enough opportunities to explore issues of interest to both countries.

 Asked whether he would discuss Kashmir with Musharraf, Naidu said: ?I am not going to do any politics in Pakistan. I am going as a guest to participate in a global event on management studies.?

 If Naidu is thinking global, his successor sounded earthy. ?I don?t want to be called a CEO. I am only a chief minister, a post which does not give me the luxury of being a high-profile corporate chief,? he said, expressing displeasure when reporters drew his attention to a brochure that addressed him as CEO of the state.

 Reddy was addressing a news conference with the director-general of the Dubai World Trade Centre, organiser of the GITEX 2005 exhibition to be held here in January, and whose brochure carried an appeal by Reddy in which he and Naidu were referred to as CEOs. 

 ?I am only keen to exploit this opportunity to push initiatives that help people ? poor as well as others ? to improve their quality of life,? he added.

 Asked if he preferred to be described as computer savvy, the chief minister said he would not like to be referred to in that way either. ?I am not computer savvy. But that does not mean I am opposed to use of computers in public domain. I am pro-active to all development initiatives.?

 Reddy said unlike the previous government, his regime had taken measures that have made personal computers cheap.

 ?There will be a tax holiday on sale of computers and accessories at the special retail showcase Computer Shopper at the GITEX,? he said.

 Asked to comment on Reddy?s aversion for sobriquets, the erstwhile CEO of Andhra laughed it away. ?He always says something and does something else. He is unpredictable and clueless about his own activities,? Naidu said.

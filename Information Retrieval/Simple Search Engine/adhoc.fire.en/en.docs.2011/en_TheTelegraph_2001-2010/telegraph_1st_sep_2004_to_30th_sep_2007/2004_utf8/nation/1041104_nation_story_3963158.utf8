 SC cheque order

 R. VENKATARAMAN

 New Delhi, Nov. 3: The Supreme Court has held that notice by post in cases of bounced cheques amounts to ?service of notice? and the party who had issued the dishonoured cheque could not plead that the notice was not served on him.

 With this ruling yesterday, the court has settled a major aspect relating to cases of bounced cheques as parties issuing cheques which were dishonoured often claimed they did not receive the notice with the 15-day statutory period.

 Under the law, a person has to deposit the money within 15 days of receiving a notice that the cheque he or she has issued has bounced.

 One of the ?unscrupulous? methods is to instruct the postman to say that the ?door is locked?. In the instant case, one V. Raja Kumari issued a cheque for Rs 80,000 which bounced. The notice posted to her came back with the post office entry ?door locked?.

 She later argued as the notice was not served on her, the 15-day period should not have been deemed to have commenced. The court rejected the argument and held that once the notice was sent by post to the correct address, it would be taken as served on the offender.

 By ?properly addressing, preparing and posting by registered post? the letter containing the document, the period of 15 days should be deemed to have begun ?at the time at which the letter would be delivered in the ordinary course of post?, a division bench said.

 ?In a case where the sender had despatched the notice by post with the correct address written on it, then it can be deemed to have been served on the sendee unless he proves that it was not really served and that he was not responsible for such non-service. Any other interpretation can lead to a very tenuous position as the drawer of the cheque who is liable to pay the amount would resort to the strategy of subterfuge by successfully avoiding the service,? it said.

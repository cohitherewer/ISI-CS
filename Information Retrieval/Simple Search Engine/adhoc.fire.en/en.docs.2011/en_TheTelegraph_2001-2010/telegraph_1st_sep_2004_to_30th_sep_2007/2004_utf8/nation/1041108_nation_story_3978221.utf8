 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 7: The government today continued with its detoxification drive by replacing all the trustees of the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts, including the four appointed by the National Democratic Alliance government.

 The Centre also dropped Congress president Sonia Gandhi as a trustee to stay clear of any controversy.

 All the trustees have been ?retired in public interest? and eight new members appointed in their place, said an official release. Those appointed today include industrialist Ratan Tata, eminent filmmakers Adoor Gopalakrishnan and Mrinal Sen, former foreign secretary Salman Haider, scientist R. Narasimhan and Professor A. Ramachandran.

 The Union ministers of urban development and information and broadcasting have been appointed ex-officio trustees.

 Congress sources said Sonia was dropped as she did not want to invite controversy by remaining the president of the centre over which the BJP had kicked up a row earlier. She is also overburdened with work as Congress president and chairperson of the ruling United Progressive Alliance.

 The NDA appointees who have been replaced include singer-composer Bhupen Hazarika, danseuse Sonal Mansingh journalist M.V. Kamath and former high commissioner to the UK, L.M. Singhvi.

 The others dropped are former President R. Venkataraman, former Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao, scientists M.S. Swaminathan and H. Narasimhaiah, academicians Vidya Niwas Mishra, P.V. Krishna Bhat, Yash Pal and Abid Hussain, artist Anjolie Ela Menon, vocalists Bhimsen Joshi and K.J. Yesudas and dancer Satyanarayana Sarma.

 The member secretary of the centre has also been retired, the official release said.

 Brain mapping on HIV accused

 Ahmedabad (PTI): A lie-detector test and brain mapping 

 would be conducted on a Maharashtra-based doctor, arrested 

 six months ago for allegedly injecting his wife with an 

 HIV-infected syringe.

 Dr Ajay Sharma had been arrested 

 for allegedly injecting his pregnant wife with an HIV-infected 

 syringe because of which both she and their child contracted 

 the deadly virus.

 ?Maharashtra police have requested 

 us to carry out a brain mapping test, lie-detector test, 

 narco-analysis test and brain finger printing on Sharma 

 to extract more details about the incident. The tests will 

 be conducted soon,? an official of the Gujarat directorate 

 of forensic sciences said on Sunday.

 Sharma, a resident of Nandurbar 

 in north Maharashtra, married Bharti on December 13, 2001. 

 She got to know of Sharma?s previous love affair, following 

 which differences cropped up, according to police. After 

 Bharti fell ill on January 9 this year, a blood test was 

 conducted on her, which indicated she was HIV positive.

 On March 30, Bharti lodged a complaint 

 accusing her husband and in-laws of torturing her and alleged 

 that they had connived to inject her with the virus, police 

 added.

 She claimed that on October 10, 

 2002, Sharma gave her an injection with an HIV-infected 

 syringe on the pretext that it was for treatment for jaundice.

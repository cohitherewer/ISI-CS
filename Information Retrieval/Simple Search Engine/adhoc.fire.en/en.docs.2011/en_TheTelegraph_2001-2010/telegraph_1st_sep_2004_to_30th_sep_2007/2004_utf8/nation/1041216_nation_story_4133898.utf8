 Orissa woos Russia 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Dec. 15: The Orissa government has decided to bring Russian tourists back to the state.

 Expressing concern over the sharp decline in the inflow of tourists from Russia, Orissa tourism minister Suryo Patro said the government has decided to make the state a favoured destination of Russians once again.

 He pointed out that several decisions were taken at a meeting between the government, tour operators from Delhi and hoteliers. To begin with, the tourism department would print brochures in Russian for the convenience of tourists from that country. Besides, a delegation of Russian tour operators would be taken to the important tourist centres of the state to give them an idea of the infrastructure available. 

 The government would then act on the suggestions made by the Russian delegation.

 Last month, a 12-member delegation of the Building and Construction Authority, a Singapore-based company, had evinced interest to invest in the tourism sector of the state.

 During its visit to the state, company officials held discussions with Patro and explored the investment opportunities. The company has considerable experience in tourism development and allied activities.

 The minister said hoteliers and tour operators have agreed to work as tourism ambassadors by putting up stalls at exhibitions in Russia and other countries. They would also formulate package tours for Russian tourists. 

 Patro said similar efforts are on to woo tourists from Asian countries like Vietnam and Cambodia. He pointed out that a sum of Rs 12 crore, including a central grant of Rs 8 crore, has been sanctioned to develop Ratnagiri, Lalitgiri, Langudi, Khandagiri and Udaigiri to attract tourists from these countries.

 Despite its beaches and thousands of temples, poor infrastructure has prevented Orissa from emerging as a major attraction for foreign tourists.

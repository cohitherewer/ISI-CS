 Secrecy breach slur on Jaya

 OUR BUREAU

 Chennai/Hyderabad, Oct. 30: Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayalalithaa today ruled out any breach of oath of secrecy as the row over her ?taped conversation? with Union home minister Shivraj Patil on changing the governor led to Opposition calls for her resignation.

 The ADMK government also denied rumours that chief secretary Lakshmi Pranesh had put in her papers last night following the controversy over including the transcript in the plea to the Supreme Court to restrain the Centre from removing governor P.S. Ramamohan Rao.

 In Andhra, Patil said the Jayalalithaa government was guilty of violating the norms of privileged dealing between the Centre and states.

 The Tamil Nadu government should assess whether ?revealing such privileged talks is in public good or not,? he said in Hyderabad after the passing out parade of the 56th batch of Indian Police Service probationers.

 In Chennai, Jayalalithaa?s assertion came within hours of DMK chief M. Karunanidhi?s demand for the ?immediate resignation? of both the chief minister and the chief secretary as ?atonement?.

 Karunanidhi said both Jayalalithaa and Pranesh, the state?s first woman chief secretary, were guilty of ?breach of oath of secrecy?. He questioned how the chief secretary could have details of the October 28 ?taped conversation? in which Patil had said the decision to shift Rao had already been taken.

 Rao resigned yesterday after the Supreme Court refused an interim order on the state?s earlier plea to stop his transfer.

 Karunanidhi questioned whether a telephone conversation between a Union home minister and a chief minister could be ?recorded in a tape in the first place?. 

 The DMK leader slammed the chief secretary for mentioning in the state?s earlier application before the apex court that his party, a partner in the central coalition, wanted a ?pliable successor? in Raj Bhavan who could recommend the state government?s ?dismissal?.

 Rebutting the allegations, Jayalalithaa said Karunanidhi?s demand for their resignations was ?ridiculous and malicious? and exposed his single-point agenda to ?destabilise my government, driven by his sheer avarice and vaulting desire to seize power by hook or by crook?.

 She said the governor transfer issue has been in the public domain for some months and ?it is no state secret?. The ADMK chief said though the apex court refused an interim order on the state government?s October 24 application, it said the state ?could approach the Supreme Court in the event there was a specific cause of action?.

 Subsequently, Jayalalithaa said, the Union home minister spoke to her over the phone to inform her that it had been decided to shift the governor. 

 As the court had said it could be re-approached on a specific cause of action, the telephone conversation was indeed the ?specific cause of action? to move the court again.

 ?I had immediate consultations with the chief secretary and briefed her on the conversation,? Jayalalithaa said. She added that in all Centre-state matters, it is the chief secretary who ?is always informed? and who takes up ?appropriate action on behalf of the state?.

 In Hyderabad, Patil said the controversy should not affect the sound relations between the state and the Centre.

 Asked why the Sarkaria Commission?s recommendations were not followed in this case, Patil said the suggestions of any committee become ?binding? only when they become law.

 He said the policy of the Congress on governors was made amply clear in Parliament. ?We cannot define our policy every day,? the minister added.

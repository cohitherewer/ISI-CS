 Another VIP falls victim to burglary

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Nov. 19: After Jyoti Basu and Shah Rukh Khan, it was the turn of Vice-President Bhairon Singh Shekhawat to bear the burglars? brunt.

 Computer hardware and accessories worth Rs 50,000 were stolen from Shekhawat?s 6 Tughlak Road residence.

 Last year, the defence ministry had launched an investigation when 17 computer discs containing ?super-secret data? went missing from the Defence Research and Development Organisation office. 

 The theft at the Vice-President?s house was discovered on Wednesday. An FIR has been filed at the Tughlak Road police station.

 With several questions being raised about the security at Shekhawat?s house, top Delhi police officials are monitoring an inquiry.

 Police sources said a Hewlett Packard computer disc writer, used to record and transfer data, and accessories like speakers have gone missing from the office of Shekhawat?s personal secretary. 

 The Vice-President?s office, however, downplayed the incident.

 The police suspect the involvement of an insider and will be taking the help of forensic and fingerprints experts to identify the culprit. A list of all those working and staying there has been prepared and the police have begun interrogating them.

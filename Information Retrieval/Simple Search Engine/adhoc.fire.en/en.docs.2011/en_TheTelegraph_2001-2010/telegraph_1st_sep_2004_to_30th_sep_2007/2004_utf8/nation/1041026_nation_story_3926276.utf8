New Delhi, Oct. 25: Union minister Ram Vilas 

Paswan today hosted the season?s first iftar, but it turned out to be a drab affair 

with the acknowledged master of sound bites staying away.

 Railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav, who is ferociously guarding his Muslim vote bank lest Paswan makes inroads, skipped the party, though Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and central coalition chairperson Sonia Gandhi were present.

 Not only Laloo Prasad, not a single MP from his Rashtriya Janata Dal attended the gathering.

 Neither did anyone from the Left parties.

 The two odd men out appeared to be Samajwadi Party general secretary Amar Singh and BJP leader and former Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the only NDA representative in the VIP crowd.

 Other big guns included Rajya Sabha deputy chairperson K. Rahman Khan, Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar, his colleagues in the central coalition Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, Oscar Fernandes and Sriprakash Jaiswal; Congress Rajya Sabha MP Rajiv Shukla and RPI leader Ramdas Athawale also attended.

 Pakistan high commissioner Aziz Ahmed Khan and a few other foreign dignitaries were also present.

 The first senior leader to walk in was external affairs minister K. Natwar Singh, followed by Congress treasurer Motilal Vora. A little later, Telengana Rashtra Samiti chief and cabinet minister without portfolio K. Chandrasekhar Rao and Rashtriya Lok Dal leader Ajit Singh walked in. Champions of small states, they sat together and gave each other company.

 A few minutes later, Paswan and his wife led Singh and Sonia to the podium. After a while, Amar Singh ambled in. Pawar came in after about 10 minutes.

 Mokama don Suraj Bhan, a former acolyte of Janata Dal (United) leader Nitish Kumar but who has now joined Paswan?s Lok Janshakti Party, tried to walk up to the podium. He was stopped by the Special Protection Group.

 The Begusarai MP kept standing there trying to attract Paswan?s attention, but the embarrassed Union minister ignored the law-maker with criminal antecedents. A couple of minutes later, Paswan?s brother Ramchandra intervened and got Bhan a seat on the podium. But nobody took notice.

 There was little sign of bonhomie. Sonia, flanked by Singh and Paswan?s wife, was seen talking to them most of the time. As Singh and Sonia got up to leave, photographers noticed Pawar standing on the extreme right and requested Paswan to bring him to the centre. A smiling Paswan obliged for a happy picture of perfect harmony.

 Paswan made light of Laloo Prasad?s absence. ?I invited all the 780-odd MPs (of both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha). No party politics here. It is up to them to come or not,? he said, when asked why the railway minister did not turn up.

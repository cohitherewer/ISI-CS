 Bound for Iraq, via Iran

 PRANAY SHARMA

 New Delhi, Sept. 22: Iran is fast becoming a favourite route for Indian workers to surreptitiously enter Iraq.

 Delhi has imposed a ban on going to Iraq for work, but indications are that Indian workers are looking for other options to get into the violence-ravaged country where they can earn high wages.

 Earlier, the favoured transit route used to be the neighbouring countries of Kuwait and Jordan. But the current ban and the cooperation of the Kuwaiti and Jordanian authorities have made it difficult for Indians to slip into Iraq.

 According to reports, Indians from the United Arab Emirates head for Kish, an Iranian island in the Persian Gulf, and then travel to Basra or other parts of Iraq. ?We have received reports that some Indians are now opting for the sea route instead of land for entry into Iraq,? an Indian official said. He pointed out that most of them are ferried on boats or launches from the UAE.

 A number of Indian and South Asian workers who would come to the UAE, Oman or other places in the Gulf for a job on a short-term visit visa would spend a few days in Kish before returning to the countries of their choice for employment. But now an increasing number of people are choosing to move on to Iraq.

 A meeting was held recently between officials of the foreign, labour and home ministries to assess the situation in Iraq and Kuwait after the release of the three Indian truckers ? Antaryami, Tilak Raj and Sukhdev Singh ? by their Iraqi captors. Since then, nearly 2,000 Indians are believed to have returned home. However, around 3,000 Indian nationals are still working in Iraq.

 About 300 Indian truckers recruited by Kuwaiti transport companies have also come back. But a large number ? 60 per cent ? continue to stay on in the hope that Delhi would lift its ban on working in Iraq.

 A week ago, a delegation of Kuwaiti transporters met Indian ambassador Swash Pawan Singh urging him to lift the ban. But Singh stuck to the government?s stated policy and made it clear that the ban would be in place till there was a dramatic improvement in the situation in Iraq.

 A team of Kuwaiti transporters had met the ambassador a month ago. They were even willing to give a written declaration that the government would not be blamed if anyone was killed or kidnapped in Iraq. Delhi, which was then reeling under the hostage crisis, had turned down the request.

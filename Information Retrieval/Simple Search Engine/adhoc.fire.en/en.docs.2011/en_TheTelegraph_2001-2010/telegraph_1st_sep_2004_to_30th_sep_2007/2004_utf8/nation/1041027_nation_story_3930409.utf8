 ?Rebel? deaths spark protest

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Imphal, Oct. 26: Manipur today returned to agitation mode after police gunned down three tribal youths in an alleged fake encounter.

 The incident occurred less than a week after a policeman killed a former chief minister?s relative for not giving right of way on a crowded Imphal street. 

 The police claimed the three tribal youths were militants and were carrying two hand grenades, a wireless communication set and some incriminating documents. The influential Kuki Students? Organisation (KSO) disputed the police version, insisting that the slain youths were ?innocent students?.

 The organisation called a 24-hour state-wide general strike from midnight and an indefinite bandh in all five hill districts from Thursday.

 KSO president K. Khongsai said one of the youths was in the third year of a BA course at Imphal?s D.M. College of Arts, while the other two were students of a high school in Moreh. 

 The high school students were in Imphal for a training programme, Khongsai said.

 Three more persons were killed in separate incidents in the state last night. 

 The three youths were killed during operations in the capital town and its surrounding areas to prevent the entry of militants. The police said a team was deployed in the New Checkon locality last night on receiving information that some militants were to visit the area to extort money. 

 ?The police team spotted some youths moving about in the locality and asked them to stop. The group immediately opened fire, forcing the policemen to retaliate. Three of them were killed on the spot, while the rest managed to escape,? an official said.

 The KSO president gave a different version of the incident. He told the media that the slain youths were on their way to a Kuki church when the police waylaid them.

 Shinde shut out from campaign

 - Maharashtra CM shaky, Rajasthan governor restive

 Sushil Kumar Shinde

 New Delhi, Sept. 14: Chief minister he is, but chief campaigner? No way.

 In fact, Sushil Kumar Shinde may not also survive in the Mantralaya hot seat in Mumbai beyond the October 13 elections even if the Congress-led Democratic Front retains power in Maharashtra.

 Nearly 20 months after Congress chief Sonia Gandhi hand-picked him to replace Vilasrao Deshmukh as chief minister, Shinde?s stock with the high command has hit rock bottom.

 As such, the chief minister ought to have led the re-election campaign. But the high command appears to have concluded that keeping Shinde at the forefront would be a huge risk not worth taking.

 According to party leaders involved in drawing up the campaign strategy, the chief minister has been virtually blacked out from all publicity material being finalised by the central leadership. Sources said Shinde does not figure in any of the half-dozen posters finalised here.

 ?The pictures of only Sonia Gandhi, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Nationalist Congress Party supremo Sharad Pawar would appear on the publicity material of the party. In some areas, it could in addition include the pictures of RPI leaders,? a source involved with working out plans for the campaign said.

 The sources said the feedback the central leadership has got from Maharashtra is that neither Shinde nor any other party leader from the state has a political standing which could justify their projection during the ?tough? re-election campaign.

 Shinde, the sources added, may even have a tough battle on hand in his Solapur constituency in the NCP stronghold of western Maharashtra as the party?s candidate had trailed his BJP rival in the recent Lok Sabha election. Apparently, there is talk of Shinde shifting to a safer seat.

 With the party unable to project any state leader from its ranks to lend weight to its campaign, it is not surprising that the Congress has opted for a joint campaign and a common manifesto with the NCP. In effect, Pawar would be the party?s and the Democratic Front?s Maharashtra mascot.

 NCP sources said Sonia and Pawar could address at least six joint rallies in different regions of the state. The projection of Pawar, they added, could also send the right signal to the powerful Maratha lobby in the state.

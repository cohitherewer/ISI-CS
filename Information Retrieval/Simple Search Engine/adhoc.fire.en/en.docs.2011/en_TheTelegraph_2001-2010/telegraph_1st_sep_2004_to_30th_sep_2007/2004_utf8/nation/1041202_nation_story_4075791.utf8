 Kids sold for Rs 2500 to beat hunger

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Dec. 1: Orissa may be on the path of progress but there are those who are forced to part with their children to stay alive.

 Poverty and hunger yesterday forced a woman of Mayurbhanj district to sell her twin sons ? Jaga and Balia ? for just Rs 2,500. The woman sold her four-month-old twin sons to a couple of persons at Sahadevkhunta bus-stand in Balasore town yesterday afternoon.

 Balasore district officials said Geetanjali Patra (32) of Sungadia village in Mayurbhanj sold her fourth and fifth children to one Rama Chandra Sethy, a middle-aged hotel owner and Rabindra Sahu of Gosalapada under Balasore town police station. 

 Both the buyers claimed that they were ?moved? by the pitiable condition of the woman. Sahoo admitted that he purchased the child for Rs 1,000 while Sethy said he had only paid Rs 1,500 to the woman. 

 Patra initially wanted to sell the children at Rs 2,000 each but had to settle for a lower price in the end.

 The woman could not be found anywhere.

 Balasore sub-collector Bhaskar Sethi admitted that hunger and poverty could have been responsible for the sale of the two children. ?We have asked the Baripada district authorities to locate the woman and her husband. Once we get to hear from them, we may opt for legal adoption of the twins,? he said.

 ?As my husband was trying to kill the children after failing to feed them, I sold my two sons so that they could be properly looked after,? Patra reportedly told the two buyers.

 Geetanjali is said to have ignored the advice of a few local people who had implored her not to sell the children. According to eyewitnesses at the bus-stand, the woman was seen requesting passers-by to buy her children.

 District officials said Patra married Padma Lochan Patra around eight years ago. The couple has five children ? one daughter and four sons. Padma Lochan owned a shop but it did not do well.

 In Orissa, starvation deaths and child sale are nothing new. In the mid-80s, the sale of Banita, a minor girl from Kalahandi, had shocked the nation. Driven by hunger, her sister-in-law Phanus Punji sold off the 14-year-old Banita to a fellow villager for just Rs 40. Then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and his wife Sonia Gandhi had visited the remote village of Anlapali, where she lived.

 Last month, slum-dwellers in Cuttack rallied around a daily-wage earner ? who wanted to sell her child ? by giving her food, clothing and shelter.

 A childless couple wanted to buy the child for Rs 400. When the couple tried to take the girl away after paying the money, the neighbours intervened and prevented the sale of the child.

 Israel talks in Arafat shadow

 PRANAY SHARMA

 New Delhi, Nov. 14: The United Progressive Alliance government will hold its first major official engagement with Israel barely five days after Yasser Arafat?s death.

 Tuesday?s foreign office consultation ? the first since the Congress-led coalition assumed power last May ? will allow India and Israel to review the whole gamut of bilateral relations. Both sides will also have the chance to discuss the post-Arafat scenario in West Asia. 

 Officials pointed out that the meeting had been scheduled months ago. Arafat?s death on Thursday means the political situation in West Asia is likely to figure in the talks.

 Foreign minister K. Natwar Singh said on his way back from Cairo where he attended the Palestinian leader?s funeral: ?We have good relations with Israel which does not and should not come in the way of our expressing sympathy and our support to Palestinian people.?

 But his remarks were a pointer to the balancing act India will have to perform during the talks with senior Israeli officials.

 ?We will exchange information, analysis and views concerning Middle East, the peace process, issues of regional importance like the situation in Iraq, Iran, Syria, Lebanon and of course the Israeli-Palestinian (peace) process and would hear from India on the situation in South Asia,? Mordechai Amichai, director, Asia and Pacific division at the Israeli foreign ministry, told PTI in Jerusalem.

 The UPA had made it clear in its common minimum programme that its foreign policy would focus on strengthening India?s ?traditional relations? with the Arab world and Palestinians. The lack of reference to Israel and the government?s dependence on Left support for survival led many to think Indo-Israel ties would no longer be a priority. 

 Relations with Tel Aviv were very good when the BJP-led coalition was in power.

 When the Manmohan Singh government finalised names of those who should lead the delegation to Cairo, it was suggested that Sonia Gandhi should head the team as she is UPA chairperson. But within hours it was decided that the foreign minister should lead Indians at the funeral.

 The decision has sparked speculation in diplomatic circles here that India was trying to deliberately downplay its participation.

 Israel and some of its western allies, particularly the US, have been arguing that Arafat was the main stumbling block to West Asian peace.

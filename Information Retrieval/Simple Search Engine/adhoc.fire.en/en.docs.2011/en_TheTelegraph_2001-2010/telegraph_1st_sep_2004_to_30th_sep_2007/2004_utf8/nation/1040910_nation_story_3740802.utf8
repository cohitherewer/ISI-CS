 Rs 101 crore for 100 Husains

 Husain: In demand

 Mumbai, Sept. 9 (PTI): A city-based technocrat has paid M.F. Husain Rs 101 crore for 100 paintings that he plans to use to raise funds for charity.

 Guru Swarup Srivastava, an IITian who runs a firm that exports iron ore to China and Hong Kong, said he paid Husain the money and offered to buy the artist?s next 75 paintings. Twenty-five already exist.

 The deal materialised after a chance meeting between the two at Bombay Turf Club following Husain?s return from an exhibition in Dubai where he displayed 25 of his works.

 The Citigroup had offered to buy these for Rs 25 crore.

 But Srivastava convinced Husain otherwise and offered Rs 101 crore for 100 paintings, including the 25, which would be a series.

 He claimed Citigroup had ?undervalued? the paintings. ?They are a treasure of this country and should stay here only,? the technocrat said, explaining why he shelled out the huge amount.

 ?His (Husain?s) contribution is tremendous,? Srivastava added and thanked the painter for his willingness to enter into a memorandum of understanding with him.

 Srivastava had done his B.Tech from IIT Delhi and returned to Mumbai nearly 30 years ago.

 The paintings, he said, would be a new area of investment and the money raised from their sale would be used for charity. ?There would be value addition to the paintings before selling them.?

 Srivastava said he was also planning a book on the collection.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 One-day order

 Calcutta, Dec. 22: Cricket lovers across the country denied India-Bangladesh Test cricket action owing to the ESPN-STAR Sports switchoff can breathe easy with Kerala High Court directing the broadcaster today to share its feed with Doordarshan for the ODIs, says a staff reporter.

 The first ODI gets underway at Chittagong tomorrow.

 In an interim order, the high court directed ESPN-STAR Sports to share the revenue at the ratio of 80:20 (80 per cent to ESPN-STAR Sports and 20 per cent to DD) subject to terms and conditions prescribed by the Supreme Court in pending cases. DD must also carry the ESPN logo and air its advertisements during the broadcast.

 ESPN-STAR Sports, however, is moving the Supreme Court against the directive. ?We are aggrieved by the order issued by the Kerala High Court and will appeal against it in the Supreme Court tomorrow,? said an ESPN-STAR Sports spokesperson.

 ?DD did not approach us for sharing the India-Bangladesh rights and there is no contract in place to do so. Our appeal to the Supreme Court will be to ensure that the series remains exclusive on ESPN and STAR Sports,? he added.

 The directive was issued on a writ petition filed by two persons, including S. Ramesh, a former Kerala Ranji cricket captain.

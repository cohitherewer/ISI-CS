 Shuffle to pacify Rao and Soren

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 26: The Congress will go in for a minor reshuffle of the Union council of ministers tomorrow to pacify sulking allies Shibu Soren and K. Chandrasekhar Rao.

 Jharkhand Mukti Morcha chief Soren, who had to step down as coal minister after an arrest warrant was issued against him in a rioting and murder case, will be restored his earlier portfolio in the expansion fixed for 3 pm.

 Telengana Rashtra Samiti chief Rao, left hanging without a portfolio, will be given the labour and employment ministry, now held by Sis Ram Ola. Ola would get mines, official sources said.

 As a double bonus, Rao also wangled an assurance on statehood for Telengana at tonight?s UPA coordination committee meeting chaired by Sonia Gandhi and attended by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.

 A sub-committee has been set up to ?identify? issues relating to Telengana, Union finance minister P. Chidambaram said after the two-and-a-half-hour meeting.

 The coordination committee also decided to bring forward the bill to provide 100 days of employment to one member of each family in rural areas during Parliament?s winter session starting December 1. Singh will leave for Laos on Sunday but will be back in time for the winter session.

 Rao tonight subverted the UPA?s official agenda as he hammered on with the demand for Telengana. He had been getting increasingly restless with the Congress? dilly-dallying on the issue.

 The Congress and the TRS had jointly fought the last Lok Sabha elections in Andhra Pradesh. At that time, the Congress had assured the TRS full support for a separate state. But it changed tune after a landslide win in Andhra Pradesh and coming to power at the Centre.

 A fed-up Rao today forced a discussion. He met Singh and Sonia before the co-ordination committee meeting and said he would not attend tonight?s dinner meeting unless they agreed to discuss the statehood issue.

 Left leaders, too, attended the coordination committee meeting as special invitees. Left parties had opted to keep out of the committee because they are not part of the government.

 The UPA also discussed the 33 per cent women?s reservation bill. ?The views of all parties in and outside the UPA have been taken,? said Chidambaram.

 The government wants to pass the bill that has been pending since 1996 because of dogged opposition from various parties, including the Rashtriya Janata Dal, Samajwadi Party and a section of the BJP.

 The UPA has decided to pass some 20-odd bills in the winter session, including the patents amendment bill.

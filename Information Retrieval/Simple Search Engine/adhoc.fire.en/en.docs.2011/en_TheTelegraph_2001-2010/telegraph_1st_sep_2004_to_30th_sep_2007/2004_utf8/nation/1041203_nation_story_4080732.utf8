 BJP takes Kanchi row to Parliament

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Dec. 2: After steering clear of the issue on the first day of the winter session, the BJP today launched a high-pitched campaign against the arrest of Jayendra Saraswati in both Houses of Parliament.

 The acrimonious debate at one stage virtually boiled down to the question of which party represented the Hindus. The BJP members took potshots at Congress, Left and ADMK members, indirectly questioning their ?commitment? towards Hindus.

 This brought the ruling side on their feet, with Congress, Left and RJD members telling the BJP that it cannot claim to be the sole representatives of Hindus. The ADMK members also joined in.

 ?The last part of V.K. Malhotra?s speech about Hindus should be deleted. Nobody is against Hindus here,? said parliamentary affairs minister Ghulam Nabi Azad, referring to the speech of the BJP?s deputy leader in the Lok Sabha that insinuated there were ?Hindu-virodhi? (anti-Hindu) parties.

 Malhotra said: ?The Sankaracharya should not have been arrested in the manner he was. He could have been interrogated in the mutt had it been required.?

 However, leader of the Lok Sabha Pranab Mukherjee made it clear that the issue was entirely outside the Centre?s domain. ?It is a matter that exclusively falls within the domain of the state government. The Prime Minister wrote a letter because of humanitarian considerations,? he said.

 In the Rajya Sabha, Sushma Swaraj, who had met the seer in Vellore jail, alleged the condition of his prison cell was ?appaling?.

 Uma regret

 Uma Bharti tonight met BJP chief L.K. Advani for the second time in two days and expressed ?regret? over her conduct at a party meeting last month, which party sources felt could pave the way for revocation of her suspension, reports PTI.

 ?I met him today and handed over a letter in which I expressed my regret for my conduct (on November 10) and for hurting Advani. I have left the decision to Advani,? Uma said.

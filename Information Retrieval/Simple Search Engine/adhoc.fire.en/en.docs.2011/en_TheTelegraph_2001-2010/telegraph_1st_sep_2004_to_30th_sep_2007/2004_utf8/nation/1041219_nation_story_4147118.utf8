 Kanchi case

 Chennai, Dec. 18: The brother of the Kanchi Kamakoti Mutt?s junior pontiff, who accused police a few days ago of ?mentally torturing? him during questioning over the Shankar Raman murder, today failed to turn up for interrogation at Kancheepuram.

 Wracked by severe stomach pain, Raghu has been in Chennai for the last few days after getting himself admitted to Shankara BP Jain Hospital on Thursday. 

 He was operated at short notice for appendicitis and was discharged from hospital today, sources said. He is now at his father?s house here.

 Kanchi seer Jayendra Saraswati is the prime accused in the murder case.

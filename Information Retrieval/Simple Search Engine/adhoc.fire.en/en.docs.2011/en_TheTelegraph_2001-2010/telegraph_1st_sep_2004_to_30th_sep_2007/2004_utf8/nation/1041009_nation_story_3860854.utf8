 Disabled charges Gulf Air

 New Delhi, Oct. 8 (PTI): 

 A disabled Indian has charged Gulf Air with treating 

 her in a ?dehumanising and discriminatory? manner and ?forcibly 

 deplaning? her for not having a certificate from its medical 

 board clearing her to fly.

 Bhubaneswar-based Sruti Mohapatra, in a letter to civil aviation minister Praful Patel, alleged that she was made to face ?humiliation, discrimination and harassment? by the captain and another crew member and was taken off the plane at Muscat airport on September 5. She has demanded an apology and a commitment from the airline never to harass the disabled. 

 Mohapatra said the crew member asked for the medical certificate and curtly told her the captain was insisting that the plane would not take off till she showed it.

 From Mumbai, Gulf Air general manager (India) John Anderson said over phone that he was not aware of any such incident. He, however, added that a medical certificate was required by all disabled persons to ascertain what kind of assistance they would need.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Stage set for NDA school curriculum review

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 16: The National Council of Educational Research and Training today formally launched the process of reviewing school curricula introduced during the National Democratic Alliance regime.

 ?We have decided to review the curriculum introduced in 2000. This is a routine review since a curriculum is due for review every five years,? NCERT director Krishna Kumar, who succeeded J.S. Rajput, told reporters. 

 Rajput, a loyalist of former human resource development minister Murli Manohar Joshi, had pushed through a new curriculum in 2000 despite stiff opposition from a majority of state governments ruled by non-NDA parties. These governments alleged that the curriculum ignored the larger perspective and tried to ?Indianise? every aspect of education. History was the most hotly debated subject.

 Kumar has so far preferred to stay clear of controversies. At his maiden news conference today, he made it clear that a school curriculum is not just about history and social sciences but a range of other subjects, including mathematics, science and music.

 The reforms in the curriculum, the NCERT director stressed, would be ?comprehensive and major?. One of the focal points will be to reduce the load on children.

 ?A country like India needs a curriculum truly federal and not Delhi-centric. The exercise of drawing up a curriculum must involve teachers, non-government organisations and the best known professionals in various fields,? Kumar said.

 The NCERT has set up a 31-member national steering committee headed by Yashpal, former UGC chairperson and the author of a report that argued in favour of lessening the textbook burden.

 The steering committee, which will draft a new curriculum, does not include any of the usual Left-wing academics like Romila Thapar, Bipan Chandra, Arjun Dev and Mridula Mukherjee. It has people from different walks of life. The list includes Arvind Kumar, director, Homi Bhabha Centre for Science Education, Trilochan Das Garg, principal of Faridkot?s Kendriya Vidyalaya, Mrinal Miri, vice-chancellor, North Eastern Hill University, R. Ramanujam, a professor at Chennai?s Institute of Mathematical Science, and musician Shubha Mudgal.

 Kumar said Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and HRD minister Arjun Singh have made it clear that the Centre has no intention to interfere with the workings of the NCERT. ?The HRD ministry had no say in choosing steering committee members. We sent the list to them after the press conference was over today,? Kumar said.

 Asked how the panel would keep itself aloof from pressures witnessed during the previous regime, he said: ?I am not going to take any direction from any political party.? 

 ?We expect to complete the review process by the summer of 2005,? Kumar said.

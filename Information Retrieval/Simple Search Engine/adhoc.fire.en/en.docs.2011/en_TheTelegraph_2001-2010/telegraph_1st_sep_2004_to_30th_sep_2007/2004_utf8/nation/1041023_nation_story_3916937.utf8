 Left push to private quota

 Madurai, Oct. 22 (PTI): CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury has said his party favoured reservation in the private sector and the Centre should not wait to implement it till a consensus is reached.

 Till then, the government should implement reservation in public sector units privatised by the National Democratic Alliance regime, he said at the party?s state-level conference on eradicating untouchability.

 Stating the issue was mentioned in the Congress election manifesto and in the common minimum programme of the ruling United Progressive Alliance, he said steps should be taken to ensure that public sector units which were privatised adhered to reservation norms.

 He said his colleague Ajay Kumar had brought forward a private member?s bill in Parliament to provide reservation in the corporate sector. 

 However, it could not be taken up as the BJP had obstructed the functioning of Parliament.

 He said the Manmohan Singh government would last its full term, contrary to predictions by the Sangh parivar.

 CM heat on UP cops

 Lucknow, Dec. 22: After constant attacks from rivals on the poor law and order situation in the state, Mulayam Singh Yadav decided to act today, reports our special correspondent.

 The chief minister sought disciplinary action on 18,000 long-pending complaints against policemen facing charges of dereliction of duty, corruption and inaction. His detractors, however, see this exercise as an eyewash.

 Briefing newsmen, principle secretary, home, Aloke Sinha said the decision to punish the policemen was taken following a law and order review meeting in which the chief minister was present.

 Sinha said 119 policemen were sacked after charges of corruption were proved against them in departmental probes. The policemen who were sacked belonged to the rank of superintendent of police, additional SP, deputy superintendent of police and sub-inspector. The number of SPs against whom disciplinary action has been taken is over 200, a source said.

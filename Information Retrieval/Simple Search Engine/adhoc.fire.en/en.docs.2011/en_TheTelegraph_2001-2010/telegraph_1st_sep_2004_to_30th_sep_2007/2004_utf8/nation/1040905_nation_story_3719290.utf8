 Last sati accused acquitted 

 Jaipur, Sept. 4 (PTI): A court has acquitted the only remaining accused in the Roop Kanwar sati glorification case citing absence of evidence. 

 Six other accused in the 17- year-old case were acquitted by the magistrate last year. Special court judge Shiv Singh acquitted Indra Kumar Tiwari yesterday owing to absence of evidence against him.

 Tiwari was mistakenly shown as dead in the court record earlier and case was dropped against him. However, the court summoned him in February to face trial after it was noticed that he was alive.

 Prosecution has opted against challenging the acquittals in high court. However, a PIL has been filed before Rajasthan High Court against the lower courts order.

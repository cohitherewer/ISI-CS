 Girlfriend amp; cobra on boxer?s sleaze disc

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 Lucknow, Dec. 24: A second-year undergraduate student in Allahabad has repeated the Delhi sex video scandal by filming his girlfriend and recording it on a compact disc and putting it on the market.

 The CD begins with a shot in which a baby cobra, the pet of 25-year-old Tanveer, crawls on his body before he embraces the teenage girl, a first-year undergraduate student in Allahabad. There are close-ups of her interspersed with explicit shots. 

 Tanveer, a state-level boxer known as ?Champion?, had allegedly invited her to a friend?s house, drugged the girl and filmed her naked. 

 The youth, known for his ?highly-placed parents?, and at least four of his associates, including a photographer, have gone underground after Allahabad police made a sluggish start to investigations yesterday.

 Local student leaders had approached the police after coming across the CD that has become ?hot stuff? in Allahabad and Lucknow since early last week.

 ?It became difficult for us to start a case as the girl?s parents refused to lodge any FIR,? senior superintendent of police S.K. Gupta said.

 The police ? of Shivkuthi locality ? visited the parents of the girl and questioned her after her relatives approached a Lucknow police officer of the inspector-general level on Wednesday. The officer contacted Allahabad police.

 The girl and her parents have left Allahabad for their residence in Jaunpur in eastern Uttar Pradesh.

 The CD was seized along with another showing the Delhi incident during raids by Uttar Pradesh police yesterday that turned up 250 sleazy discs in Ghaziabad and 120 in Lucknow. This was in reaction to the growth of the sleaze market elsewhere.

 Earlier on Monday, Agra police had raided a series of cybercafes and marched 21 couples, said to have been ?in a compromising position?, down the street before putting them in police vans.

 The next day, the police raids were repeated in Aligarh. ?During the raid on a cybercafe in Civil Lines area, the police not only passed lewd remarks at young women but one male officer was seen dragging a student by her hair and forcing her to face the camera of a local news channel,? said Siraj Ahmed, student of Aligarh Muslim University.

 The high drama during the raid, reported on TV, upset Justice A.S. Anand of the National Human Rights Commission so much that he sent a notice to the Uttar Pradesh police department today, seeking an explanation on the violation of students? rights.

 Chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav has ordered a probe into the incident.

 ?There indeed have been police excesses during the raid at Aligarh. Innocent students need not have been harassed. We will take action against officers involved in inflicting atrocities on the girls,? state home secretary D.K. Verma said.

 Social worker Sarita Joshi said cybercafes have become a meeting place for young lovers in the repressive society of the country?s heartland but many were there for career purposes. ?But the police chose to harass them,? she said.

 Dr Prabhat Sitholey, head of the psychiatry department at Lucknow?s King George Medical College, said any confusion by police in distinguishing an adolescent?s sexual curiosity from the commercial marketing of their private moments could result in psychological damage.

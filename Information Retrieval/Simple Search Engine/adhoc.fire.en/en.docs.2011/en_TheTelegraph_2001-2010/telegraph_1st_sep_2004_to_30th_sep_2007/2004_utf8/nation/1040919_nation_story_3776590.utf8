 Himachal missing list grows long

 MANJEET SEHGAL WARRIOR

 Shimla, Sept. 18: Over a hundred people are said to have gone missing in the hills of Himachal Pradesh over the last several decades and their whereabouts are still not known.

 Among the exception has been Margot Lydia Aulikki Ryyanen, a Swedish trekker who died on the Kangla glacier in Lahaul and Spiti district in 1981.

 Her remains, discovered by a four-member Spanish trekking team last month on the 18,500-ft high glacier, were retrieved on Monday and brought to Indira Gandhi Hospital here yesterday for forensic examination.

 Margot?s passport (75406334) and other documents show that the 29-year-old was on a five-month visa to India and had entered the country from Pakistan (via Wagah border) on April 22, 1981.

 She was with her American boyfriend Zen Victor Milstein and two or three others. Two of the bodies, already discovered and still buried in the snow, could not be recovered by the 22-strong rescue team because of heavy snowfall.

 But they are not the only ones buried in the icy heights. Altogether 16 foreign trekkers, including five women, are missing for the last 12 years.

 The latest was this year when two women, an Italian and a Lebanese, went missing in Manali Hills in Kullu.

 ?Most foreign trekkers rely on theoretical knowledge based on travel guides. They fail to locate themselves and are trapped in glaciers,? a Manali-based tour operator said.

 ?No communication system is available in the remote hills. They should hire experienced tourist guides,? he added. Police, too, blamed foreign tourists for the growing list of the missing. They said these trekkers do not leave any information behind and end up in inaccessible mountains.

 ?Foreign tourists venture into interior areas without road and communication links. These areas are sparsely populated where performing rescue operations is a herculean task,? said Kullu superintendent of police A.P. Singh.

 The earliest reported incident involving foreign trekkers dates back to 1992 when two women, a Swiss and a Yugoslavian, went missing in Manali.

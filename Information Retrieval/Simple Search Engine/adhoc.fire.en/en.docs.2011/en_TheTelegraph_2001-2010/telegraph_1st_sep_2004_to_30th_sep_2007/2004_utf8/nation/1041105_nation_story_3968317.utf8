 Foetus register plan to save girls 

 GAJINDER SINGH 

 Chandigarh, Nov. 4: The Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee today suggested registering pregnancies to arrest the problem of female foeticide in Punjab. 

 Members of the SGPC, an independent body entrusted with the task of managing Sikh historical gurdwaras and religious matters, floated the idea after the first meeting of Sikh clerics and Punjab political leaders on the issue convened by National Commission for Minorities chairman Tarlochan Singh in New Delhi. 

 ?There is need for all governments in the country to register conceptions. It will make people aware of the problem and also answerable for abortions and miscarriages. It will also become difficult for parents to kill a girl child immediately after birth,? Akal Takht jathedar Joginder Singh Vedanti said. 

 Punjab, along with Haryana and Himachal Pradesh, has recorded some of the most skewed sex ratios in the 0-6 age group in India. In Punjab, the ratio has dropped to an alarming 786 girls for every 1,000 boys in 2001 from 875 in 1991. Haryana has recorded a decline from 879 to 820 over the decade while the Himachal count has dropped from 951 to 897. 

 Chandigarh is not far behind. It has recorded a ratio of 845, among the lowest in the country.

 Significantly, Punjab and Haryana are ranked among the most prosperous states with the highest per capita incomes, yet statistics show that none of the 19 districts in Haryana, 17 in Punjab and 12 in Himachal have a sex ratio favourable for girls. Out of 12,778 villages in Punjab, 6,376 have a female sex ratio below 800. 

 The Akal Takht had issued a hukumnama (edict) to Sikhs three years ago not to indulge in female foeticide, saying it went against Sikhism which respects women. Pointing out that the Guru Granth Sahib provides equal rights to women, it had also called for a social boycott of those indulging in the practice. But the edict fell on deaf ears.

 The Punjab government is mulling providing cash incentives to parents opting for family planning measures. The scheme, yet to be announced, is expected to be on the lines of the Devirupak scheme by Haryana. 

 In Haryana, Rs 500 is given every month for 20 years to couples adopting a permanent method of sterilisation at the birth of the first girl child. Those choosing sterilisation at the birth of the first male child or the second girl child get Rs 200. 

 The Punjab health department has also proposed that the Centre release more grants to villages with a better sex ratio under centrally funded projects. 

 SGPC general secretary Sikhdev Singh Bhaur, who had been campaigning against female foeticide, had suggested holding village-level women committees accountable for further decline in the sex ratio in their areas. 

 Bhaur, Vedanti, Punjab health secretary Darbara Singh Guru, Shiromani Akali Dal general secretary Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa and Congress MP Parneet Kaur were among those attending today?s meeting.

 Andhra starts picking up pieces

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, Dec. 27: As the death toll climbed, Andhra Pradesh began counting the costs.

 Over 134 people have been officially declared dead in the state in yesterday?s disaster. Relief commissioner Ashutosh Mishra told reporters this evening that nearly 1,300 people, including fishermen who went to sea early on Sunday, are missing and almost 10,000 have been rendered homeless.

 The state government has evacuated over 22,000 people living in low-lying areas and shifted them to relief camps, where medical help was provided besides food and water.

 Mishra said mild tremors hit several coastal towns thrice but did not cause any major damage to either life or property. ?The government is making an assessment of the losses to make a report for seeking central assistance,? he said.

 At Machilipatnam, district relief officer B.R. Meena said: ?We are trying to assess the damage to aqua life and ecology. The tsunami had hit thousands of acres of mangrove forests, coral and sea vegetation. It will take years to revive them.?

 Navy helicopters and coastguard boats are searching for bodies all along the eastern coast, which stretches more than 100 km. ?The shallow waters and corals near Machilipatnam had apparently attracted floating objects, including human bodies. We might even get bodies from the Andamans, Nellore and Chennai,? Meena said.

 Authorities have begun despatching relief to the tsunami-hit districts. ?Without waiting for further tremors, we have set off distribution of food, water and medical aid to all,? Meena said.

 Union home minister Shivraj Patil, who landed in Hyderabad last night, left for Chennai in the afternoon after making an aerial survey of the districts.

 Chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy visited Nellore and Prakasham districts, where the toll is slowly rising.

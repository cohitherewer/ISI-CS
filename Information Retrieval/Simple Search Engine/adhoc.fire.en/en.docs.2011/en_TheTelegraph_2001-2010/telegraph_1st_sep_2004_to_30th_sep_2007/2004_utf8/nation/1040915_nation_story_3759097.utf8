The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Dinner date for YSR, envoys

 KAY BENEDICT

 Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy

New Delhi, Sept. 14: Pradesh 

 may have dumped its ?cyber CM (chief minister)? . Chandrababu 

 Naidu last May, with his political detractors deriding his 

 ?reform mania? and running an election campaign about it.

 But his Congress successor Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy appears to be stepping into his shoes: he has stunned observers with the speed with which he is wooing global players for investment.

 Reddy will be present tomorrow at a gala dinner being held for 60 US, European and Asian diplomats at Nandiya restaurant in Maurya Sheraton hotel here. The purpose seems to be to attract investment and promote Andhra and himself in the manner of his predecessor.

 The dinner is being hosted by Peter Hasan ? Reddy?s newly-appointed adviser on industrial matters, who holds cabinet rank. Chief ministers are not allowed to hold dinners for diplomats without the permission of the foreign and home ministries. Committed to taking reforms forward, Reddy will get to interact with the envoys and invite them to Andhra, sources close to him said.

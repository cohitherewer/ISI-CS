 Water war

 New Delhi, Sept. 8: The dispute over sharing Cauvery water today engulfed the tribunal set up to settle it, with rival riparian states Karnataka and Tamil Nadu arguing for and against its dissolution before the Supreme Court, reports our legal correspondent. 

 Karnataka sought a directive through an affidavit for dismantling of the Cauvery River Water Disputes Tribunal and constitution of a new one. Tamil Nadu, in a counter-affidavit, has opposed the formation of a new tribunal. 

 The latest battle between the neighbours was triggered by a petition of the Gandhi Sahitya Sangh Trust of Karnataka, which contended that differences between chairman Justice .P. Singh and members on visiting the Cauvery delta in Tamil Nadu have rendered the tribunal redundant.

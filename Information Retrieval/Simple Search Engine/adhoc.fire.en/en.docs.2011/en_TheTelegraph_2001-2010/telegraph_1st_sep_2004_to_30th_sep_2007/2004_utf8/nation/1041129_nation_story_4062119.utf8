 Slew of tech schools, not enough students

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, Nov. 28: Faced with a glut of engineering colleges in Andhra Pradesh, one such institution has notched up the dubious distinction of enrolling only one student for the current academic year.

 Five others ? all private colleges in rural areas in Warangal, Mehboobnagar, Adilabad, Srikakulam and Anantpur districts ? have recorded less than five enrolments each.

 The startling figures came up following the counselling for admissions to 238 private engineering colleges in the state early this month.

 The previous N. Chandrababu Naidu regime had sanctioned as many as 250 private colleges over the last two to three years, of which 238 started functioning from last year.

 The managements of these colleges have flooded the commissionerate of higher education with demands for more concessions to fill up 16,000 vacancies of the 90,000 seats in engineering institutions, including 18 run by the state.

 ?I need a minimum of 75 students to run the institution as I have to hire teachers and also watch-and-ward staff to run hostels,? said P. Sathyanarayana Reddy, chairman of P.V. Reddy College of Engineering ? which has only one electrical engineering student ? in Warangal?s Mulugu town.

 Faced with the flood of pleas, education secretary Chellappa said the government can provide permission to set up educational institutions and help acquire clearances from apex bodies but cannot guarantee student intake. He was speaking to management representatives when they called on him last week.

 A senior education ministry official said: ?In view of the increase in seat availability in private institutions, the government even urged the intermediate board to be liberal in giving good marks to students.?

 Almost 1.7 crore students appeared for the intermediate, of which about 1.2 crore took the Engineering and Medical Competitive Entrance Test.

 According to higher education minister P. Venkateswar Rao, ?this is not a new trend (as) even last year there were nearly 9,000 vacant seats?. He told reporters on Tuesday that the government was keen to reduce fees to attract more students from other states.

 Statistics available with the higher education ministry show 89 such colleges have filled up less than half their capacity ? around 100 of 240 seats in each. Nine have less than 10 students each and about 40 less than 50 students each. The situation has prompted the government to urge the ministry to allow transfer of students between institutions to make them viable.

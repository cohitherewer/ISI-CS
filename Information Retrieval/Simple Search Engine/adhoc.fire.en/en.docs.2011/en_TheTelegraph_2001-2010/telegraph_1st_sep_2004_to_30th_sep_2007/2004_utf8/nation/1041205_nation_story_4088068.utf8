 Mystery release of NHPC manager

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi/Patna, Dec. 4: National Hydroelectric Power Corporation general manager T. Mandal has walked free but what brought his freedom ? the ?Hare Ram Hare Krishna Mahamantra? as he likes to believe, or money ? is not clear.

 Bihar police and the Uttar Pradesh Special Task Force are conducting further investigations into the kidnapping of two NHPC executives on November 19 from Vaishali district in Bihar.

 ?When they let me go, they just touched my feet, perhaps because I used to chant the Mahamantra all the time,? he said today, a day after he was put on the Delhi-bound Saptakranti Express by his captors.

 Reunited with his family in south Delhi 15 days after his abduction for ransom, Mandal said it could be a case of mistaken identity. He said the abductors told him before they set him free: ?Hamne galat aadmi ko pakad liya (We kidnapped the wrong person).?

 Be it spiritual chants or mistaken identity, the ?rescue? of Mandal was projected by railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav as a fitting reply to those opposed to development. ?We are prepared to take on anyone who wants to scuttle the development of Bihar,? Laloo Prasad said moments after Mandal reached home. NHPC had undertaken road projects in Bihar under the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana.

 Union rural development minister Raghuvansh Prasad Singh said much the same and added the ?rescue? was a big success for the police. Bihar police said nothing more than that it was ?a successful operation, which involved strategic planning and patient waiting?.

 Mandal and his colleague, chief engineer K.K. Singh, were kidnapped while they were on their way to West Champaran. Singh managed to escape at Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh, on November 26. Mandal, an Iskcon devotee, recalled that ?when my colleague left, I was scared they would do something to me. I would chant the (Hare Ram Hare Krishna) Mahamantra?.

 The kidnappers had called up the officials? families in Delhi demanding Rs 5 crore each for their release. Asked about last Thursday?s withdrawal of Rs 19,000 from the Connaught Place ATM of his account with ICICI Bank, Mandal said: ?I don?t know whether any money has been paid or not.?

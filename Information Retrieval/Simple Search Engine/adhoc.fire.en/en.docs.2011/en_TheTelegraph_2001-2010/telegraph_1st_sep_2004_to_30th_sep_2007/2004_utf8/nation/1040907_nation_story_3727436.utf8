Corporations to take action on solid waste management 

 States to set up waste-energy project in one city in three years

 Bylaws to be amended to ensure installation of solar-water heating systems 

in new buildings

 Rebate in power bills to domestic users of solar geysers

 New traffic signals to be powered by solar power

 Solar-based switching systems to be installed for street lights

 Incentives to be given for using solar-based lighting systems and solar-based 

generators for commercial establishments 

New Delhi, Sept. 6: The Bengal government will soon approach the state electricity regulatory commission to allow them to offer a rebate in electricity tariff to domestic users of solar geysers.

 At the same time, the municipal corporations in the state will amend their bylaws to ensure mandatory installation of solar-water heating systems in new buildings.

 The governments of Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh have already issued orders to change building bylaws. The municipal corporation of Bangalore is the first city to make it mandatory to install solar power-based water heaters.

 Mayors and commissioners of municipal corporations met here today and drew up a 10-point action plan for creation of new-age cities that will harness non-conventional energy sources.

 The action plan called for measures that need to be taken by state governments and municipal corporations to encourage the generation of energy from waste and the use of solar thermal and photovoltaic technologies to meet a variety of energy needs in cities.

 Municipal corporations will take action for proper collection, segregation, transportation and disposal of solid waste. Private companies will be encouraged to participate in a project to convert waste to energy in at least one city in each state over the next three years. The Union government will provide an interest subsidy to such projects.

 The action plan is expected to benefit the urban population in the country and save energy resources.

 State governments and municipal authorities will formulate guidelines and offer incentives to promote installation of solar streetlights, solar lighting systems for hoarding and solar generators for commercial establishments in cities.

 An expert committee is proposed to be set up to examine the feasibility of adopting solar passive designs and other measures to promote energy efficiency in buildings.

 The Centre will provide financial assistance to a few pilot projects and for training activities relating to solar energy technologies.

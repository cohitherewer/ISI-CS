 EC bans ?violent? Sena video

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Oct. 2: The Election Commission has banned a video the Shiv Sena released yesterday as part of its high-profile audio-visual campaign.

 The video has been conceived and directed by Raj Thackeray, who reportedly spent a lot of time putting together the visuals.

 The banned video, one of a series of eight compact discs, features a bomb blast in a BEST bus. The visuals appear to be an attempt to recreate the Ghatkopar blast in July 2003 in which four persons died.

 In the 45-second video, shot in slow motion, a bus is seen approaching a crossing when a bomb inside it goes off. The shots that follow show the destruction, the mangled remains of the bus, and a baby, whose mother has been killed, crying helplessly. The voiceover says there have been several riots and blasts in the last five years. The copy at the end of the video asks: ?Don?t you want a change??

 A three-member committee set up by the Election Commission, led by joint chief electoral officer K.V. Kurundkar and comprising a returning officer and a Doordarshan officer, today rejected the video and ruled that the short film was not fit to be shown as it was too violent.

 State chief electoral officer U.P.S. Madan today said the commission had cleared seven of the eight compact discs. An appellate committee under him took a fresh look at the video recreating the bus blast after the Sena filed an appeal against the panel?s order yesterday.

 Raj Thackeray, reportedly aggrieved over the way he has been sidelined in the elections, made his debut in the poll campaign yesterday with the compact discs. He has prepared the audio-visual material, considered his forte, on the ?development? during the Sena regime between 1995-1999 and the ?deterioration? during the Congress-NCP administration in the last five years.

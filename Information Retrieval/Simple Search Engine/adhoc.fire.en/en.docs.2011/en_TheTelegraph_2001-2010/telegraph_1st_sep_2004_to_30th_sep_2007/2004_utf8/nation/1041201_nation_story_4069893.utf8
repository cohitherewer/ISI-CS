 Live warhead takes off

 Balasore, Nov. 30 (PTI): India today used a live warhead for the first time in the test-launch of the surface-to-air Akash missile, a day after Pakistan launched its medium-range nuclear capable missile, Ghaznavi.

 The missile soared into the skies from the Integrated Test Range at Chandipur-on-Sea and successfully hit a moving target. The warhead, carrying 60 kg of explosives, hit the target as programmed, defence sources said.

 The sleek missile fired from a mobile launcher hit the target attached to an unmanned aircraft, Lakshya, flying at an altitude of 4.5 km, they said.

 ?This is a milestone in the history of India?s defence research and development,? Prahalada, the programme director of the Nodal Development Laboratory at Hyderabad, said over telephone.

 Never before have Indian defence scientists used a live warhead in test-launching any missile, he said. ?The experiment was a 100 per cent success.?

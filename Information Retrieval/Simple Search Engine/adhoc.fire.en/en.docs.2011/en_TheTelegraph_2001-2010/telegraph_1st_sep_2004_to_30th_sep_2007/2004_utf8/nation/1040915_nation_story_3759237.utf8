 23-year-old frozen tragedy

 MANJEET SEHGAL WARRIOR

 Shimla, Sept. 14: Three 

 Indians ? Laxmi, a cook, Azhar, a tourist guide and Ram 

 Bahadur, a porter ? were returning to Manali, having seen 

 off a four-member Spanish trekking team they had been escorting. 

 On their return journey, about 2 km from the Kangla glacier, 

 the trio spotted a torn bag containing some letters dating 

 back to 1981 and 1982.

 The three reported the find to the authorities and the pieces of a long-unsolved puzzle then started falling into place.

 A few days after the trekking team had left Manali on August 6 this year, it had spotted the bodies of three trekkers buried in snow at the 18,500-foot high Kangla Pass in Lahaul and Spiti. From the letters found in the bag, it has now emerged that one of the trekkers was Swedish.

 Manali police had not reported any foreign trekker going missing in 1981. However, the Swedish embassy had learnt ? from the missing persons bureau in Stockholm ? that Margot Lydia Aulikki Ryyanen, born on December 15, 1952, was travelling in north India during the summer of 1981 with her American boyfriend Zen Victor Milstein. The US embassy also confirmed that one of its citizens had gone missing during his trip to India the same year.

 The exact date that the foreigners had gone to trek Kangla Pass is not known. The authorities are also not certain about the exact number of trekkers but they estimate there were four or five of them.

 The operation to trace the bodies began on Thursday. A 22-member rescue-cum-retrieving team reached Than Pattan on Friday, 75 km from Manali. The next day, it reached Falfu and camped for the night. The team reached the glacier by Sunday night and the three bodies were found on Monday buried in the snow at Kangla Pass.

 The authorities are yet to identify the bodies. However, as the letters were found near the woman trekker?s body, they feel it could be Margot. The parents of the trekkers are yet to get in touch with the Himachal Pradesh government.

 The Himachal chief secretary, Kanwar Shamsher Singh, said in Shimla today that the authorities had lost contact with the search team as the phone it was carrying had gone out of order.

 On directions from the Centre, the team had been asked to airlift the bodies to a forensic laboratory in Shimla. Based on information received from the team, Himachal government authorities had requested the defence ministry for a smaller helicopter as the government one was too large to land where the bodies are buried.

 Singh had earlier said the bodies would be kept under the snow to avoid decomposition and would be airlifted once they heard from the embassies concerned.

 Singh said: ?Two of the bodies could be of a young Swedish woman and her American friend. We have not found any clue about the third body,? he said. A search is on for the body of the fourth trekker.

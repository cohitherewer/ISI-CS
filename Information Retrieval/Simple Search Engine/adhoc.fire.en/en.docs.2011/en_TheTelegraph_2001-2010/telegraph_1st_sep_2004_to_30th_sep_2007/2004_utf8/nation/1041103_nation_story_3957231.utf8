 Kashmir rights rap on Pakistan

 PRANAY SHARMA

 New Delhi, Nov. 2: Islamabad may emphasise the need to involve Kashmiri leaders in its talks with India but does not allow individuals or political parties that favour independence to contest elections in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.

 A report by the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan further observes that those who participate in polls in PoK and get elected to its parliament are obliged to take an oath that they would remain loyal to the ideology of Kashmir?s accession to Pakistan.

 The Inter-Services Intelligence, which has a strong presence in PoK, keeps the people there ? particularly those in favour of independence ? under continuous surveillance, says the report.

 ?No person or political party shall be permitted to propagate against or take part in activities prejudicial or detrimental to the state?s accession to Pakistan,? part 7 (2) of the ?Azad Kashmir? constitution states categorically.

 ?This deliberate exclusion of the pro-independence opinion, held by many people as well as organised political groups, demonstrates lack of respect for dissent, which is more prevalent than is generally acknowledged or admitted,? says the commission?s report.

 Its candid remarks, however, indicate that a serious attempt is perhaps being made in Pakistan to allow such bodies to independently criticise some of the government?s policies.

 The report also admits that the PoK high court has no jurisdiction over people caught by the ISI and ?most of the times, detention and arrests by the agencies are arbitrary and are not scrutinised?.

 The commission says the state does not even have its own textbook board and ?students are taught more about Pakistan than about Kashmir?.

 PoK ? known as ?Azad Jammu and Kashmir? across the border ? covers 13,297 sq km and has 2.9 million people. It has two divisions ? Muzaffarabad and Mirpur ? that comprise seven districts.

 The Pakistan President had recently come up with a number of proposals in his ?out-of-the-box? thinking to find a resolution of the Kashmir dispute.

 Mayavati on mentor?s Maharashtra mission

 Mayavati: Fulfilling a dream

 Amrawati, Oct. 7: Not many political leaders in Maharashtra seem to be aware of a warning Kanshi Ram sounded in Lucknow four years ago. The Bahujan Samaj Party founder told a rally that after the Hindi heartland his target was Maharashtra and the 2004 Assembly elections. 

 Kanshi Ram is out of action now, but his anointed successor Mayavati is on Mission Maharashtra. With just a week left for the October 13 polls, she has prompted all prominent players in the battleground to uneasily ponder the likely impact of the BSP factor on their prospects. 

 Till a few days ago, the BSP headache was confined mainly to the Congress. Now, the rival Shiv Sena-BJP combine, which was wishing the BSP would make a dent in the Congress? traditional Dalit vote bank across the state, has also become anxious, particularly in the Vidarbha region. 

 The rival combine?s bid to return to power depends on its performance in Vidarbha, which accounts for 66 of the 288 Assembly seats. It desperately needs a big lead over the ruling Congress-Nationalist Congress Party coalition, which could be crucial in making up for the huge deficit it expects in NCP boss Sharad Pawar?s western Maharashtra bastion. 

 In the Lok Sabha polls four months ago, the Sena-BJP led over the ruling combine in 57 seats. Mayavati is seen to have contributed to the success to some extent. 

 But Pramod Mahajan, the BJP?s chief strategist, is a worried man, unsure how desertions would impact the Vidarbha results. Nearly half-a-dozen local BJP leaders have moved to the BSP, peeved ?their seats? had gone to the Sena. 

 In Nagpur, hardcore RSS man and former BJP city unit treasurer Ashok Goel stunned his boss Nitin Gadkari, the Opposition leader in the legislative council, by entering the fray from Nagpur East as a BSP candidate. Goel is currently a Nagpur corporator. 

 ?It is a setback to the party,? admitted Gadkari, also the party?s chief campaign manager for Vidarbha. 

 Mayavati has not spared the Sena either. Half-a-dozen ?strong? Sena leaders, particularly in Amrawati, Nagpur and Washim districts, have joined the BSP to enter the fray. What is really causing disquiet is that most of those who crossed over to the BSP are not Dalit leaders. 

 However, Mayavati?s incursion into the Sena-BJP camp?s upper caste and OBC voter base is hardly comforting to the Congress-NCP combine. Because at least another 18 BSP candidates are its dissidents, though not all of them are strong enough to trouble it. What is more worrying for the Congress is the likely impact of the BSP?s presence on the party?s traditional Dalit vote base. 

 Mayavati has virtually relegated most of the Republican Party of India factions that once exercised influence over the Dalits. The Congress has not even bothered to court the RPI, except the R.S. Gavai faction, which is fighting a tough battle to withstand the BSP assault in its Amrawati base. 

 ?In the Lok Sabha elections, Dalits voted aggressively against the Congress. Mayavati was the beneficiary,? said Prakash Dubey, editor of a Hindi daily in Nagpur. The Congress lost 10 of the 11 Lok Sabha seats in the region. In 17 of the 66 Assembly segments that make up the 11 seats, the presence of BSP candidates had made the Congress-NCP combine concede lead to its rival. 

 With eyes fixed on warding off the BSP threat, Congress chief Sonia Gandhi?s rallies in the backward region a couple of days ago were organised in Dalit and tribal-dominated areas. The party?s hopes of retaining power depend largely on a recovery in Vidarbha. 

 The party is hoping Sonia?s rallies would counter the BSP forays into its Dalit vote bank. On the other hand, Mayavati is scheduled to devote the last three days of her campaigning to Vidarbha.

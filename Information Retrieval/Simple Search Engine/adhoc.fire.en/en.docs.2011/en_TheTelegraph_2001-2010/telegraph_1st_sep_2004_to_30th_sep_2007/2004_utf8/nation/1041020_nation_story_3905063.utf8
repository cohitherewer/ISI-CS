 Vermin of the gutter, spits relieved actor 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bangalore, Oct. 19: Veerappan?s death at the hands of the special task force has let loose the emotions of prominent people who have had run-ins with him.

 For Kannada thespian Rajkumar, the bandit?s death meant good riddance to a ?cruel animal and vermin of the gutter?.

 ?I suspect that he would have nurtured elements like him. They should not be allowed to grow. I am happy he is no more,? said the veteran actor who spent over 100 days in the forest after Veerappan whisked him away from his farmhouse at Gajanur, Tamil Nadu, in 2000.

 His wife, Parvathamma, who was a witness to the abduction, woke him up early today to break the news of Veerappan?s death.

 ?Now I am free to visit my native village without fear after waiting so long,? said Rajkumar, who was prevented from visiting his ancestral home since his release.

 Rajkumar said he had offered Veerappan the opportunity to begin a new life while in captivity in the dense forests of Satyamangalam.

 ?To change him, I offered to assist him with my contacts so he could buy a house and farmland and live a normal life. He told me he would not surrender in this life.?

 Rajkumar said he knew nothing about the ransom reportedly paid for his release. ?I have not seen any money being transacted or paid to him (Veerappan), at least in my presence. However, I respect P. Nedumaran (Tamil Nationalist Movement leader), whose intervention helped set me free.?

 The bandit?s death was the end of a ?cruel animal?s life? to Parimala Nagappa, widow of former Karnataka minister H. Nagappa, who died in Veerappan?s captivity two years ago. ?If only Veerappan was held or finished much earlier, my husband would not have been kidnapped or found dead in the Chengadi forest. I wish he was captured alive; so many truths could have come out,? said Parimala, now a Janata Dal (Secular) MLA .

 Nagappa was abducted on the night of August 25, 2002, and held captive for 104 days before his body was found on December 8.

 His son Preetan demanded a ?CBI probe to find out how he came to know about our village and took my father away?.

 Retired deputy superintendent of police Abdul Karim said Veerappan?s death ?is a relief not only to me but also to millions of people?. His son, sub-inspector Shakeel Ahmed, was killed by the bandit in August, 1992.

 In 2000, Karim had fought the governments of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu when they wanted to release Tada detainees as demanded by Veerappan for Rajkumar?s release. His petition in the Supreme Court stalled the release of 51 detainees.

 Qualis cloud on Zahira

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Dec. 7: The special 

 court hearing the Best Bakery re-trial ordered an inquiry 

 into the immediate circumstances of the family of prime 

 witness Zahira Sheikh, including their use of the car in 

 which they arrived from Gujarat to Mumbai to be present 

 at the court. 

 The judge ordered the inquiry following a report submitted by deputy commissioner of police (protection) M.M. Rathod on the three constables who were escorting Sahira Sheikh, Zahira?s elder sister who turned hostile in the witness box.

 The report said Mumbai police had discovered in its interrogation of the three Gujarat police constables ? Shantilal Parmar, Jayantilal Patel and Praveen Suryavanshi ? that they were given Rs 8,000 and a Qualis for Sahira?s stay in the city by R.B. Brahmabhatt, superintendent of police, Gandhinagar. No lady constable was in attendance on Sahira, neither did the constables have any official letter to authorise them as Sahira?s security. 

 The judge said there were irregularities in the way the Gujarat government has provided police security to Sahira. He asked Mumbai police to look into the circumstances and find out the ownership and registration of the Qualis bearing number GJ 06 VA 3082.

 The court also questioned why its driver had left without waiting to take her back to Vadodara, as it was supposed to have done.

 The Qualis and its driver cannot be traced. The court has asked the police to trace the driver and also find out who was paying for the sisters? stay at a private guesthouse in Mumbai. 

 Brahmabhatt is expected to be present in court tomorrow.

 Shun ghee call in Britain

 London, Nov. 18: Indians in Britain should give up ghee and switch to other cooking oils, the UK?s public health minister, Melanie Johnson, said today.

 Her intentions are totally honourable but she is up against deeply ingrained cultural and dietary habits. She wants Britain?s ethnic minorities to lead a healthier life, for example by taking more exercise and making better use of the provisions that were outlined earlier this week in the government?s white paper, Choosing health: Making healthy choices easier.

 She wants Asians like everyone else to give up smoking ? 42 per cent of Bangladeshi men smoke compared to 28 per cent of the total population.

 She also wants Asians to cut down drastically on their salt intake in their food and to walk a lot more. She suggests, for instance, that parents walk their children to and from school rather than do the school-run by car. The recommendation is for a three-mile walk every day so that a person is ?slightly out of breath?.

 The government wants to target the ethnic minorities, especially the most deprived sections of the community, by training volunteers and also taking on extra National Health Service staff who will act as ?personal trainers? to members of the public.

 These services will be available either by ringing the NHS ?Health Direct? number or online for those who have Internet access.

 Asked what she would do if people in India, for example, approached the NHS for advice on health issues, she told The Telegraph: ?We are happy to share our knowledge.?

 While most of her suggestions will make sense to Asians, even if they do not immediately respond to them, her ideas on ghee did not meet with universal approval from Indian food experts.

 Johnson said: ?I like ghee myself.? But she wants people to come off ghee as a precondition for tackling a wide range of problems such as obesity, diabetes and heart problems. It is known that Asian men, in particular, are prone to heart attacks.

 Among Indian restaurant owners, Andy Varma, who runs Vama on King?s Road, said: ?My grandfather and my grandmother had rosy cheeks into their nineties and they cooked in nothing but ghee. At home, I cook in ghee and my children ? my daughter is eight and my son is six ? love it.?

 He added: ?I don?t cook in ghee in the restaurant because that is what the public wants. But I think that other oils may have lower cholesterol but they are synthetic and can be more harmful.?

 One of the most senior chefs in Britain, Udit Sarkhel, who runs Sarkhel?s Indian Cuisine and Calcutta Notebook in south London, declared: ?I prefer to cook in ghee as compared with hydrogenated fats. Ghee is pure because it is derived from milk and cream.?

 He explained: ?Ghee is not really needed for strong meats such as red meat but it is ideal for pilau, for daal and some vegetables.?

 Sir Gulam Noon, director of Bombay Halwa Ltd, which makes Indian sweetmeats ? it had huge sales over Diwali ? and of Noon Products which provides millions of packets of Indian meals to Sainsbury and other supermarket chains, would not budge on the need for ghee. 

 ?An Indian sweet is ghee and ghee is an Indian sweet ? no one will use anything other than ghee in making Indian sweets,? he insisted. ?Indians have cooked in ghee for thousands of years. Nothing else has the same aroma.?

 As for the public health minister, she merely wants to help.

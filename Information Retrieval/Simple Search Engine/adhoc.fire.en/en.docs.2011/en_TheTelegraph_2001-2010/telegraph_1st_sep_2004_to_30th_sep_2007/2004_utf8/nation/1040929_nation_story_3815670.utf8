 Cong aloof, Biswas prefers Pawar 

 A STAFF REPORTER AND AGENCIES

 Sept. 28: The CPM today said it ?wants? Sharad Pawar to win the BCCI election because ?political elements? are at play while the Congress expressed reservations about politics in the organisation. 

 CPM?s Bengal secretary Anil Biswas said ideally cricket and politics should be kept apart but since it was not so, ?we are sympathetic to Sharad Pawar and want him to win the poll?. 

 ?I don?t understand cricket. But we have noticed a number of political elements become active over the BCCI elections. We are also a political party and (thus) want Pawar to win the elections,? Biswas said at the party headquarters on Alimuddin Street in Calcutta. 

 Asked whether Pawar had approached the CPM leadership for its blessings, Biswas said: ?I can?t tell you about this. Our leaders in Delhi might be able to answer you.? 

 Outgoing president Jagmohan Dalmiya, who is backing another candidate to succeed him, is on good terms with the Marxists. 

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said he was not at all interested in the cricket polls. ?I am interested in cricket, Sourav Ganguly and the Indian cricket team as a whole. I also understand cricket. But I am not interested who all come and go in the committee (BCCI),? he said. 

 Veteran Marxist Jyoti Basu said: ?I don?t understand cricket very much but I think there should be an election.?

 In Delhi, the Congress side-stepped questions on supporting Union agriculture minister Pawar in the race for cricket board president. 

 ?BCCI should be kept away from politics... Political parties should also keep away,? AICC media cell chairperson Girija Vyas said when asked whether her party would back the allied Nationalist Congress Party leader in the poll. 

 Asked if Pawar was contesting as a politician or a sports lover, Vyas said one who promoted sports could also be a sports lover and take part in related contests. Pawar heads the Mumbai Cricket Association.

 Her remark came hours after defence minister Pranab Mukherjee ruled out in Calcutta any political interference in the election of the BCCI president, for which Pawar is a likely candidate.

 ?It is a totally apolitical affair. The Congress has nothing to do with this,? Mukherjee said.

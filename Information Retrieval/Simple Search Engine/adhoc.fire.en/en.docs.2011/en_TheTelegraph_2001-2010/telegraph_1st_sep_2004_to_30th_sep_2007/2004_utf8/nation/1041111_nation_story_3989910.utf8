 Soft Mulayam 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lucknow, Nov. 10: Mulayam Singh Yadav today softened his stand against the Congress-led Centre over value added tax after a meeting with the finance minister and his Bengal counterpart.

 P. Chidambaram was on a mission to achieve political consensus on VAT in the country?s largest state and Asim Dasgupta was there as chairman of the VAT Empowered Committee. They set about to win over the Uttar Pradesh chief minister, each his own way, after his stand against VAT assumed a shrill anti-Congress tone of late in his running battle with the party.

 Mulayam Singh had repeatedly opposed Chidambaram?s bid to implement the system, which has been designed to levy taxes ranging from 4 per cent to 12.5 per cent on many product categories in four segments. ?This will harm the interests of the small traders,? he had argued.

 After about an hour?s meeting between the duo, the chief minister and his party?s general secretary Amar Singh, Mulayam Singh sounded conciliatory. He said he ?would not have any problem in implementing VAT in the state if the traders and business community agree to accept?.

 For Chidambaram and Dasgupta, this was a sort of triumph as Mulayam Singh has never relented on his tough stand against VAT. 

 Stepping out of the chief minister?s house, a smiling Chidambaram said Mulayam Singh happened to be ?my old colleague?. ?I was a finance minister of a cabinet in the late nineties of which he was a defence minister. We cannot agree to disagree on key issues,? he said, referring to their association in the H.D. Deve Gowda government.

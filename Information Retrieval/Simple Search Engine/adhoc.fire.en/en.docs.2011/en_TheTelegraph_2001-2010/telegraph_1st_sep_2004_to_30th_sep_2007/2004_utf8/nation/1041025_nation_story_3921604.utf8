 Advani alert on rebel talks

 Hyderabad, Oct. 24: L .K. 

 Advani today cautioned the Centre against soft-pedalling 

 the extremist problem plaguing several states in the country.

 The Congress-led government, the BJP president said, has undone the efforts of the National Democratic Alliance regime to contain the spread of extremism.

 Advani was addressing party workers here after inaugurating the state BJP?s new building, the Dr Shyama Prasad Mookerjee Bhavan.

 Extremist forces, he said, posed a serious threat to the country?s internal security and had assistance from external elements.

 ?It was a matter of internal security of the country and any move by individual states would be dangerous,? Advani said, referring to the Andhra Pradesh government?s recently concluded talks with Naxalites.

 The United Progressive Alliance government has given up coordinated efforts, he claimed, and instead allowed each state to follow its own path. While one state is talking with the Naxalites, another (Tamil Nadu) has banned it, he said.

 The former deputy Prime Minister said the BJP-led NDA government had launched an exercise for coordinated efforts by Naxalite-infested states with the Union home ministry?s assistance.

 ?We had formed a coordination committee comprising police top brass of the affected states to evolve strategies for tackling the Naxalite menace. But the UPA government has reverted it and is giving free hand to the states,? he said.

 ?We even had quarterly review by chief secretaries of all such states,? he added.

 The NDA regime, Advani said, had never compromised and insisted that the extremists should give up armed struggle before coming for talks. ?Talks should be held with those groups or revolutionary organisations that lay down their arms first.?

 Dubbing the Andhra talks a ?self-defeating and retrograde approach?, Advani said: ?Naxalism is one of the internal problems the country is facing now and it is showing its ugly face in Andhra Pradesh.?

 ?But the Congress governments,? he said, ?have compromised with the ultras and gone to the extent (of saying) that it was a fulfilment of poll promise to hold talks with them.?

 Citing the previous government?s method, Advani said the NDA had followed the path of negotiations sincerely and achieved results in talks with Bodos and Nagas. ?Even on the Jammu and Kashmir issue, we had three rounds of summit talks.?

 Taking a dig at the Maharashtra impasse, Advani, also the leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, said the UPA did not have the skills or experience to run coalitions.

 ?This has been amply displayed in their dealing with the NCP in Maharashtra where they are yet to finalise the chief ministerial nominee even 10 days after poll results,? he said.

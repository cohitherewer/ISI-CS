 Author link in Ulfa talks

 OUR BUREAU

 Guwahati, Sept. 30: Assam 

 chief minister Tarun Gogoi gave the Ulfa 15 days to cease 

 hostilities after learning that the militant group had contacted 

 writer Mamoni Raisom Goswami to broker talks with the government.

 Gogoi told the media that Goswami telephoned him to say that the Ulfa leadership had expressed its readiness to start a peace process with the government if she acted as the mediator.

 ?To begin with, the state government will declare a month-long ceasefire if the outfit ceases hostilities by October 15,? the chief minister said.

 The Jatiya Mahasabha, a federation of various organisations, recently appealed to the outlawed militant group to rein in its armed members. It also urged Delhi and Dispur to start the peace process without further delay.

 Gogoi said his government was ready for an ?unconditional dialogue? with the outfit. ?Why does the Ulfa have to insist on imposing conditions? When we say we are ready for unconditional talks, it implies all issues will be discussed,? he said, hinting that the government was no longer averse to the idea of including contentious subjects such as sovereignty in the agenda.

 Gogoi?s remark was a departure from his earlier statements, wherein he categorically ruled out any discussion on sovereignty.

 Ulfa commander-in-chief Paresh Barua said last month that his organisation would sit across the table with the government ? if need be, in the state capital ? if its demand for a ?sovereign Assam? was included in the ambit of the dialogue.

 Gogoi said the government was not averse to the ?NSCN (I-M) model of talks? with its role limited to that of a facilitator. He said Dispur only wanted the Ulfa to declare a truce with the government, like the Naga militant outfit has done.

 The chief minister, however, made it clear that the government would not declare a unilateral ceasefire unless the Ulfa promised to abjure violence.

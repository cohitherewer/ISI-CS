 Hope floats on falling fertility 

 AYSWARIA VENUGOPAL

 New Delhi, Sept. 15: A Union health ministry report has brought cheer to population watchers as it claims the country?s fertility rates are finally falling.

 ?Given the scale and diversity of India?s population, a decline of total fertility rate of 5.2 (children) per woman in 1971 to 2.9? in about three decades is a ?significant achievement?, says India Country Report: Population and Development 10 years since ICPD (International Conference on Population and Development).

 It adds that India, which has clocked the 1-billion mark, is in the middle of a demographic transition as ?both fertility and mortality levels have started falling?.

 The trend will be sustained in the coming years though the sizeable growth in population is likely to continue for the next few decades as the decline in mortality preceded that in fertility, says the report prepared by the ministry?s family welfare department.

 Mortality rates started falling since 1921 but the decline in fertility rates became noticeable only after 1990.

 The report also notes that ?the pace of fertility decline in the northern belt of India will determine the time and the level at which the countrys population stabilises?.

 The falling fertility in India and other regions of the world notwithstanding, population will continue to be a big problem, cautioned the India chapter of the UN Fund for Population Activities.

 Its State of the World Population report said by 2050, global population would jump by 2.5 billion, a number equal to the world population in 1950.

 ?Global population, now 6.4 billion, is still growing rapidly, currently by 76 million persons per year,? says the report that was launched today in the presence of health minister Anbumani Ramadoss.

 It further says that 96 per cent of the projected growth would be in developing countries as 50 of the poorest countries would triple in size to 1.7 billion people.

 But it was not all gloomy news. Population growth has slowed since it peaked in the mid-1990s with the average family size declining from six children per woman in 1960 to around three today, the report said.

 The UN report takes stock of goals achieved 10 years after the International Conference on Population and Development when 179 countries, including India, adopted the Cairo Consensus.

 The consensus sought to balance population with the world?s resources, improve women?s status and ensure universal access to reproductive healthcare.

 The Indian report, made available on the occasion of the UN document?s release, attributes the falling fertility rates to steady increase in use of contraception and, to a smaller extent, the rise in age of marriage.

 ?At the national level, the use of modern contraception rose from about 10 per cent of couples protected around 1970 to over 45 per cent in 2000,? the report says.

 The trend appears to be a worldwide phenomenon as the UN report says use of contraception across the world rose from 55 per cent in 1994 to 61 per cent this year.

 Kargil ghost stirs

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Chandigarh, Sept. 11: Memories of Kargil have been rekindled with armed militants continuing to tip-toe into Indian territory with alarming regularity from the Poonch-Rajouri sector of Jammu division.

 ?The continuous flow of militants... is indicative of yet another attempt to occupy strategic peaks in the region, within and outside the LoC. We are estimating that nearly 3,000 militants are waiting to occupy certain peaks in the Pir Panjal range. Force may have to be used to cleanse the infiltrated areas,? a northern command officer said from Udhampur.

 The army has been receiving information about the militants? plans to occupy peaks that are normally not manned by India owing to treacherous terrain.

 Members of the Gujjar and Bakarwal nomadic tribes, who live in the upper reaches of the mountains and are sometimes forced by militants to ferry arms, ammunition and explosives to ?safe havens?, are believed to be the informants.

 ?We are keeping a strict watch on all movements in the region. But even if all soldiers of the Pakistan and Indian armies posted in the area stand arm-in-arm, infiltration would continue unabated. We are, however, worried that even after Operation Sarp Vinash last year, Pakistan continues to push militants inside Indian territory. The firing during intrusions may have stopped but infiltration continues as before,? the officer added.

 Operation Sarp Vinash had brought into light the existence of a fully functional transit camp with arms and ammunition, communication equipment and large stores of ration that could sustain 500 men for at least 15 days. While the exercise was hailed a success for preventing a Kargil-like situation, senior officers admitted it was an intelligence failure.

 Five militants, arrested 2 km inside Indian territory from the Hiranagar sector of Jammu on August 22, told interrogators about a plan to occupy some of the mountain ranges. The arrest also laid bare gaping holes that have allowed militants to cross over even in areas where infiltration was claimed to be ?impossible?.

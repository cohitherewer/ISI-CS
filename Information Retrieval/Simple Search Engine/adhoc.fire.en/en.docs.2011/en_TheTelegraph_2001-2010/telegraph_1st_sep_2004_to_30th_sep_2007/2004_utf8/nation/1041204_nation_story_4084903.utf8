 Putin 

in veto thumbs down

 SEEMA GUHA

 New Delhi, Dec. 3: Russian 

 President Vladimir Putin disappointed the Indian establishment 

 today when he refused to endorse veto powers for new entrants 

 to the UN Security Council.

 India has been working hard for over a decade to join the exclusive club of the US, the UK, Russia, China and France that wields overwhelming international influence.

 Russia had in the past supported India?s entry to the UN Security Council, but Putin indicated that even Delhi?s staunchest political ally is unwilling to expand the charmed circle to accommodate friends like India.

 Putin, on an official visit to the country, did not directly say he was against allowing veto rights to new members of a reformed Security Council but gave enough indication that Russia was not ready to accommodate In-dia?s wishes for equal status with the current members.

 At a joint news conference with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Putin said Russia supported a reorganisation of the Security Council to reflect the changes in the international situation.

 As one of the largest countries in the world, India, he said, should rightfully be a permanent member of the Security Council. But he was unwilling to extend veto powers to India or any of the other hopefuls like Germany, Japan and Brazil.

 ?But speaking about the role of veto and other tools present in the United Nations, we should say that we believe it would be absolutely unacceptable to erode such tools of the UN,? the President said when asked his views on veto rights for new members.

 The veto powers of the five members, he said, should stay, ?otherwise the UN organisation will lose its weight and lose its role, changing into some discussion club, a new addition of the League of Nations?.

 At the same time, Putin underscored the point that there was room for flexibility and discussion on veto and that the expert panel recommendations were not final.

 He said in the process of negotiations, ?we will show significant flexibility...we have full understanding with our Indian partners in this matter?.

 ?Our position,? Putin said, ?is in preserving the United Nation?s universal character, serving as a tool for the resolution of all the problems of the modern world?.

 ?Beyond any doubt, there should be no deterrents in the rights of the members of the Security Council. I think that would have been a destructive approach. We have to show flexibility taking into account the interests of all participants in the process. That?s how I have described to you our position,? Putin said.

 Indian leaders were not impressed. Unwilling to openly comment on Putin?s remarks, they were privately disappointed because the views came from India?s strategic partner. 

 ?The signals from the President are not very positive,? an Indian official said.

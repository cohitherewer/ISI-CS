 Cell sex leads to escort rule

 AYSWARIA VENUGOPAL

 New Delhi, Dec. 10: The mobile phone scandal has prompted Delhi Public School, R.K. Puram, to give the kindergarten treatment to its Class XII students on their last day in school.

 Two Class XI students recently had sex and shot it on a mobile phone enabled with multimedia messaging service or MMS. This was later made into a compact disc that has become a best-selling item in the capital?s underground CD market.

 Confounded by the mobile phone menace, Delhi?s liberal schools sent a list of dos and don?ts to parents a few days ago. DPS, R.K. Puram, has taken extra precautions ahead of December 23, the last day in school for the class of 2004-05.

 On Monday, principal Shyama Chona wrote to parents of Class XII students asking them to come to the school and sign out their wards on December 23. The students would then proceed on a three-month leave to prepare for their pre-board and board examinations.

 The pupils, on the threshold of college, are embarrassed at having to be escorted out of school.

 Some parents are also irritated. ?This is the first time that such a notice is being sent to parents to pick up the children from school. It has never been done before and the children also don?t like that their parents have to come to school to pick them up as if they are in nursery. I don?t know how this is going to help but it is obviously being done because of the MMS incident,? said Deepak Mehta, a parent, on receiving the notice.

 The school has also scrapped Scribbling Day ? when outgoing Class XII students sign and scribble messages on each other?s uniforms in what is a passing-out rite.

 ?It is the last day in school. Scribbling messages is a done thing on the last day. It is just a fun thing to do on the last day. It?s almost a tradition and we have seen our seniors do it earlier. I was planning to keep my shirt forever. I cannot understand why the school is doing this,? said a student.

 In an earlier letter, the DPS principal had commented on the lack of discipline and decorum among students. 

 ?We are disconcerted by the existing malaise of rowdyism, rude behaviour, disrespect to elders, lack of etiquette and values in general,? Chona had said.

 The principal?s letter also bars students from visiting a particular shop outside the school. Students have also been stopped from buying DPS jerseys with smart slogans made by private firms.

 The letter also advises parents not to provide mobile phones to their children. It says the uniform code has to be followed strictly and warns students not to turn up sloppily dressed.

 Besides prohibiting mobile phones and skipping classes, students found indulging in violence, rude behaviour, damaging school property or using abusive language have been warned of disciplinary action that could result in suspension.

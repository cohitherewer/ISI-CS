 One-use syringe check on HIV

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Dec. 16: India?s largest condom manufacturer plans to distribute foreign-made syringes that it claims will be impossible to reuse. The initiative is aimed at preventing the spread of HIV and other infections through contaminated needles.

 Early next year, Hindustan Latex Limited (HLL) will begin distributing ?auto-disable syringes? produced by Becton Dickinson (BD), a US-based medical technology firm, company executives said today after signing an agreement.

 About 60 per cent of the three to four billion injections given in India each year are unsafe because of syringe reuse or inefficient sterilisation, the officials said citing a study sponsored by the World Bank. 

 Contaminated needles may help spread HIV as well as the Hepatitis B and C viruses that can cause chronic liver disease and liver cancer.

 A study earlier this year had indicated that unsafe injections in India account for 50 per cent of Hepatitis B and C cases and one-fourth of HIV infections in the country every year. 

 The syringes that Hindustan Latex plans to distribute will get automatically disabled after being used once and are ?impossible to reuse?, said Gary Cohen, president BD. One type of the syringes is intended for the immunisation programme while another will be aimed at routine treatment purposes.

 However, an environment analyst cautioned that while India needs auto-disable syringes, it lacks the infrastructure to deal with the waste generated by such devices. 

 ?It may take three years to build infrastructure like needle cutters, needle pullers, waste management systems and to train people to use them,? said Ravi Agarwal, director of ToxicsLink, a non-government organisation that has been tracking various types of waste and the channels for disposing them in India.

 Health minister Anbumani Ramadoss had said earlier this year that the government plans to introduce auto-disable syringes in the universal immunisation programme. An estimated 290 million syringes are used annually to immunise children.

 The collaboration with BD would allow Hindustan Latex to sell syringes through its nationwide network of 800 stockists and 450,000 retail outlets. ?We?ve been contributing to HIV prevention through condoms. This initiative addresses another major route of the spread of the infection,? managing director M. Ayyappan said.

 HLL and BD officials said their product would be priced competitively. ?If the numbers grow, we will consider local manufacture,? Cohen said.

 Boycott sword over IT.com

 B.R. SRIKANTH

 Bangalore, Oct. 9: The clamour for improving roads and other infrastructure before Bangalore IT.com, Karnataka?s flagship event, has prompted chief minister Dharam Singh to invite CEOs of infotech companies to a meeting next weekend.

 The government has been jolted into action after some IT companies threatened to boycott Bangalore IT.com 2004, slated for November 1-5. The companies, which informally call themselves the Bangalore Forum for Information Technology, planned the boycott as a ?wake-up call? to ensure better roads and smooth traffic flow.

 Some of the firms making up the forum ? Philips Software, Texas Instruments, Motorola, HP, SAP Labs, Novell, Sasken, Talisma and Bosch Software ? spoke of their proposed boycott at a meeting last evening.

 Though no company has confirmed they will keep away, the state IT department responded to the threat with Singh?s talks invitation ? the second such initiative after an August 10 meeting with captains of industry.

 ?The state government is aware of the issues raised by IT companies. The chief minister will meet CEOs of IT companies later next week. In a month?s time you will see better roads and smoother flow of traffic because we have alerted the departments concerned. We have plans for an elevated access to the Electronics City and have discussed the project with Union minister T.R. Baalu,? M.K. Shankarlinge Gowda, secretary of the department of information technology, said today.

 Gowda said the companies that have threatened to skip the annual event were not invited to the August meeting. ?We picked the CEOs of big IT companies and from different sectors. They were not invited and are not aware of improvement plans discussed at that meeting. We want to decongest Bangalore and make it accessible from all highways as part of a long-term plan,? he said.

 The official said despite the infrastructure problems, more companies have confirmed they will attend this year?s event compared to the previous year. Firms from 14 countries will attend, up from 11 last year, while companies from 13 Indian states will make it to Bangalore IT.com as against 11 the year before.

 B.V. Naidu, director of Software Technology Parks of India, said a group of six companies had issued the boycott call. ?I spoke to each of them and they have the same problems in terms of infrastructure. We will meet the CEOs next week and set at rest all apprehensions about roads and traffic,? he said.

 The forum is unhappy with the government?s apathy to the infrastructure problems. The faculty and students of the Indian Institute of Management blocked traffic for hours on Bannerghatta road earlier this week to protest against poor roads.

 Referring to this protest, Bob Hoekstra, CEO at Philips Software, said: ?When the city is collapsing, it is not right to have an event to invite new tenants. We have invested millions of dollars in our facilities here and unlike the services companies, we cannot move out of Bangalore and expand.?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Naga leaders land in Delhi

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 5: NSCN (I-M) leaders Isak Chisi Swu and Thuingaleng Muivah landed in Delhi tonight on a historic visit that has the potential to narrow down differences between the government and the longest-surviving insurgent group in the country.

 ?We have come here on the Prime Minister?s invitation and we see in it a great wisdom for a peaceful political solution,? Muivah, the general secretary of the militant group, told Naga students who had gathered at the Indira Gandhi International Airport.

 He praised Manmohan Singh, Sonia Gandhi and other Congress leaders for their initiative. ?We will try to negotiate with the government of India on the basis of the uniqueness of the history of the Naga people.?

 Nearly 2,000 members of various Naga groups lined up at the airport in traditional attire and greeted the duo with the Pete Seeger classic, We shall overcome. 

 This is the duo?s second visit to the country in as many years. But unlike the last time, this visit ? expected to stretch for nearly four weeks ? will provide an opportunity to give their negotiations with Delhi since 1997 one hard push.

 Delhi?s interlocutor for the Naga talks, K. Padmanabhaiah, told The Telegraph that he expected the visit to ?narrow down? differences in perception between the NSCN (I-M) and the government to ?such an extent that a mutually satisfactory negotiated solution can be found?.

 Padmanabhaiah, however, indicated that it would be unrealistic to expect a resolution overnight in view of the complexities of the problem. 

 ?No one has a magic wand... It will take patience, understanding and mutual trust,? he said.

 Over the next few days, the two Naga leaders will meet the Prime Minister, the Union home minister and Sonia.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Power shift, on ground amp; air 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 20: Who said state-controlled media does not convey the true picture? 

 Doordarshan has diligently captured the change in power equations, featuring Sonia Gandhi from this May to October for over eight hours ? more than double the coverage she received as the leader of Opposition a year ago (see chart). 

 More dramatic ? some will say illustrative ? has been the swing in the television fortunes of the Left.

 From an anaemic four minutes during the same period last year, CPM leaders clocked as much as one hour and five minutes on air in the corresponding phase this year.

 Not surprising, considering CPM leader Sitaram Yechury had chosen a television channel, albeit private, to send a chill down the stock markets on divestment no sooner than the election results were announced in May. 

 There is a twist in the Left tale: the CPI outgunned its big brother. Against last year?s three minutes, CPI leaders managed one hour and 38 minutes this time.

 If Sonia and her allies have made their small-screen presence felt, a similar space for the BJP has shrunk.

 Between May 23 and October 31, this year, the BJP president has been on the state-run channel for a little over four hours. During the same period last year when the party was in power, its chief Venkaiah Naidu was covered for almost five-and-a-half hours.

 Naidu is no longer the BJP president, having given way to L.K. Advani, who took over on October 27, which means only four days of his reign falls within the period reviewed.

 The telecast figures were painstakingly collected by the government and submitted in writing in the Rajya Sabha by information and broadcasting minister S. Jaipal Reddy in response to a question.

 The BJP was quick to tar Doordarshan with the same brush that all parties use against the state media when they are in the Opposition.

 ?It is obvious there is gross misuse of the public broadcaster by the ruling party to favour their leader,? BJP leader Arun Jaitley said.

 But Doordarshan officials pointed out that news, not prejudice, influenced their decisions, adding that similar surveys of any other television channel ? state-controlled or not ? and newspapers will also reflect the same trend. 

 ?We give prominence to newsmakers. We were doing no favour to anyone. The Congress president was newsworthy and had to be given time,? a Doordarshan official said. ?Check the private channels during the same period and see how much television time was devoted to the Congress president.?

 The time given to Sonia also includes appearances in her capacity as chairperson of the UPA and the chief of the National Advisory Council.

 Vasanthi Rao of the Centre for Media Studies said: ?I?m not surprised with these figures. Doordarshan has always been used as a tool by whichever government is in power at the Centre. But I have to say that the BJP was much worse. They used it blatantly for the party.?

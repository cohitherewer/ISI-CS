Lata and Sukhdev's mother Jaspal Kaur react to the news of release. 

 Sept. 1: The news was good but the reaction was cautious.

 The families of the three Indian truck drivers held hostage in Iraq since July 21 were unwilling to believe media reports that they had at last been set free. They hadnt forgotten the experience of August 1 when similar news had proved false.

 We did not believe the TV news at first. We confirmed it from the external affairs ministry. Only then did we inform our relatives and friends, Tilak Rajs brother Kashmiri Lal said at their home in Himachal Pradesh.

 Sukhdev Singhs brother, too, reacted guardedly when he was told the news at Makrauna Kalan in Punjabs Ropar district. We will not believe it till the government informs us they are safe and coming home, Harbinder Singh said over phone. But his voice betrayed hope. This time, we have a feeling that they could have been set free.

 The confirmation finally let loose the pent-up emotion. I am eager to see my brother. We have spent the last 42 days in hell. We will dance bhangra when my brother comes home. I cannot explain my happiness in words, Harbinder said.

 In Himachal Pradeshs Una district, Antaryamis mother Bhago Devi said it was time for thanksgiving: I have promised a number of things to God a fast and a yatra to some temples. We will perform puja when he lands in India. God has finally listened to our prayers. 

 His father, Ram Murti, too, thanked divine intervention. Like Harbinder, he linked it to Prakash Utsav, the celebration to mark the 400th anniversary of the installation of the Guru Granth Sahib.

 My son had last spoken to me on July 20 and to hear him today after experiencing all the trauma for nearly six weeks, you dont know the relief I felt, Ram Murti said after speaking to his son in Baghdad.

 Antaryamis wife Kusum Latas happy smile said it all.

 They could not have forgotten the picture of Antaryami, kneeling on the floor and sweating in fear with a rifle held to his head, as seen on a videotape released to foreign media late in July by the abductors, Holders of the Black Banner.

 The three truck drivers of Kuwait Gulf Link Transport Company were abducted along with four other colleagues.

 Tilak Rajs pregnant wife Promilas first reaction was to rush to the black and white TV and tune in to Doordarshan. The family home at Dharampur doesnt have a cable connection. I am very happy. I have not seen the latest photos of my husband. I was told by others that he has been released. We are thankful to all and want to distribute sweets, Promila said.

 Neighbours had to hunt for half-an-hour to get Tilak Rajs mother, Kishni Devi, and sister Taro back from the fields where they were working and tell them the news. Taro was home for rakhi. Im very thankful to God, Kishni Devi said. Kashmiri Lal cant wait to see his brother. We will welcome them with a band and distribute sweets.

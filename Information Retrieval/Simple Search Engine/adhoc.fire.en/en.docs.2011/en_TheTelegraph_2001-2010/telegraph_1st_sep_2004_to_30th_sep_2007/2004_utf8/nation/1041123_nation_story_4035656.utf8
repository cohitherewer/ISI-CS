 Pak praise for troops pullout

 Colombo, Nov. 22 (Reuters): The reduction of troops by India in Kashmir had helped reduce tension, Pakistan?s Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz said today, but added he did not expect this to lead to a breakthrough in talks with Indian leaders this week.

 In Colombo ahead of his first official visit to India, Aziz said in an interview that he was encouraged by progress in talks over the Kashmir issue, but said any permanent solution was likely some way off.

 ?I think the fact that India has started to reduce its troops is welcome. This is from one particular area and we hope that this process will continue, particularly in the urban areas, where there?s a large concentration of troops,? Aziz said.

 Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf has said his country might be willing to drop its plebiscite demand and last month made new proposals, saying Kashmir could be demilitarised and placed under UN control, put under joint control or even given independence. But Musharraf says India must also show flexibility.

 Aziz said he did not expect a breakthrough in talks with his Indian counterpart Manmohan Singh.

 ?Pakistan?s stand is very consistent. We don?t change our stand every time we take a trip to a country,? Aziz said. ?This is part of a process. I don?t think we are looking at one trip to change everything, but I think it?s a step-by-step process.?

 ?We have to move our discussions from strictly the tactical level to the strategic level, and that?s how we can look at solutions, which will find a sustainable end result,? he said.

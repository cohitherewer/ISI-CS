 India cool to US-Pak arms deal

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 19: The public posture notwithstanding, India is not too worried over the US decision to sell surveillance aircraft, related equipment worth $970 million and anti-tank missiles to Pakistan.

 Although India has officially expressed concern over the proposed arms sale, there are indications that Delhi is reserving its energy for when the handover is completed ? expected to be sometime next year.

 The US Defence Security Cooperation Agency has decided to sell eight P-3C Orion surveillance aircraft, 2002 TOW-2A missiles and 14 TOW-2A missiles to Pakistan.

 Foreign secretary Shyam Saran, who is in Washington for talks with US officials on the Next Steps in Strategic Partnership II, has discussed the matter with US secretary of state-designate Condoleezza Rice and other senior officials.

 Foreign ministry spokesperson Navtej Sarna said Saran pointed out the repercussions of the move on India-Pakistan relations.

 Much of what Delhi has said appears to be aimed at the domestic audience, particularly to pre-empt critcism from the Opposition.

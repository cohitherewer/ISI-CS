 December date for Pak talks

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Islamabad, Nov. 29: Islamabad and New Delhi have agreed to hold the next round of foreign secretary-level talks in December, dispelling fears about derailment of the composite dialogue process in the wake of sparring over Pakistan?s proposal for demilitarisation of Kashmir.

 ?The talks will be held in Islamabad on December 23 and 24,? foreign ministry spokesman Masood Khan said today in Islamabad. Pakistan had earlier proposed December 21 and 22 for the second round of talks but India suggested alternative dates, which Islamabad accepted.

 ?The foreign secretaries will discuss overall progress as well as subjects of peace and security, including confidence-building measures and the Jammu and Kashmir dispute,? the spokesman added.

 According to the schedule for the second round of meetings already agreed by the two countries, talks between railway authorities on the Munabao-Khokhrapar rail link will be held in Islamabad on December 2 and 3. This will be followed by a meeting on December 3 and 4 in New Delhi between the Indian Coast Guards and the Pakistan Maritime Security Agency to discuss the establishment of communication links.

 A meeting on the commencement of a bus service between Srinagar and Muzaffarabad will be held in New Delhi on December 7 and 8, followed by a meeting on nuclear and conventional confidence-building measures in Islamabad.

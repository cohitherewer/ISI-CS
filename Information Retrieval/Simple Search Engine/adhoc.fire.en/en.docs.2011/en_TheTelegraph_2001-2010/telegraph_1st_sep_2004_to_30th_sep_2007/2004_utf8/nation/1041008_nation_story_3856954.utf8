 Army build-up in Assam 

 SUJAN DUTTA

 New Delhi, Oct. 7: The army has begun moving a brigade of troops from its peacetime location in the Meghalaya capital, Shillong, to neighbouring Assam to reinforce its counter-insurgency operations in the wake of the blasts in the state last week.

 The Union home ministry said yesterday that additional forces would be deployed in Assam, if required.

 Army sources confirmed today that a brigade that was held in reserve in Shillong had been moved to positions in Lower Assam. 

 The brigade of about 3,000 jawans is in addition to the three divisions (about 45,000 troops) in the army?s 4 Corps deployed in Assam. The sources said no new operation was being launched, but the counter-insurgency drive called Operation Rhino II that has been going on for the last five years was being intensified.

 The sources said reinforcements were being sent to Assam without disturbing the security grid in the Northeast and without drawing troops from formations in the Dimapur-based 3 Corps, despite the ceasefire in Nagaland with the NSCN (Isak-Muivah). 

 ?The idea is to thicken troop density in Assam where operations have already been on,? a source said.

 Troops from the Shillong brigade would fan out in Bongaigaon, Dhubri, Kokrajhar and Goalpara districts.

 The nature of the counter-insurgency operations in the state is unlikely to change and will continue to be a sustained one mostly involving cordon and search operations in the rural areas. The troops are not going in with non-traditional hardware.

 Militant groups have had less access to Bhutan since December last year, when the royal army attacked camps of Ulfa and Bodo militants. Against this backdrop, army operations in Lower Assam will involve quick raids into thick jungles where militants are suspected to be hiding. 

 Sources did not rule out using helicopters for aerial recces, a standard measure during counter-insurgency operations in Assam?s uneven and forested terrain. Army sources said troops had been asked to operate ?with restraint?.

 It is understood that paramilitary units, which are also likely to be reinforced after the home ministry?s decision, will be tasked to secure rear areas.

 Men at divorce receiving end

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Bhopal, Sept. 26: More and more Muslim women in Bhopal are taking the initiative to end marriages, contrary to the general impression that they are at the receiving end in most divorce cases.

 Of the 285 divorce cases last year, 200 had women opting for khula (where the wife takes the lead in annulling the marriage), statistics at the city qazi?s office, which maintains marriage records under the Shariat, showed. The approval of the office is mandatory for executing divorces.

 Community leaders, women activists and psychologists argued that such a ?progressive? trend did not augur well for society.

 ?Among all the permissible things, divorce is the most reprehensible act,? Qazi Abdul Lateef Khan quoted Prophet Mohammed as saying. The worst victims of divorce were children, he said. The qazi said he always tried to dissuade those seeking divorce but relented if the individual was determined to go ahead.

 Women?s rights activist Zahira Khan supported the qazi. ?It brings us little pleasure to note that women are taking a lead in separations. Divorce is a necessary evil ? more evil than necessary ? and, therefore, needs to be discouraged rather than encouraged,? she said.

 Islam recognises and permits divorce, she pointed out. But men in a male-dominated society have often used the provision as an instrument to assert supremacy. 

 The misuse of divorce had figured at a recent meeting of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board in Kanpur where community leaders had discussed but failed to forbid triple talaq.

 Qazi Lateef attributed the new trend to changing social mores and the Nawabi era in Bhopal during which women ruled for more than 120 years. After the death of Aurangzeb in 1707, Nawab Shahjahan Begum, Sikandarjahan Begum and Sultanjahan Begum brought about sweeping reforms, putting women of the region on a higher pedestal than those in other parts of the country.

 Saeed Khan of the city?s Tajul Masjid sought to point the finger at soap operas. ?These days our women are spending considerable time watching serials where all sorts of social ills are on display. There is a malicious propaganda that separation leads to a better life. Some of them seem to be rehearsing it in their real life,? Khan said.

 However, some of the women who have opted for khula asserted that the problem was serious and could not be attributed to TV soaps.

 An engineer, Tasneem (name changed), who married in West Asia later discovered that her husband was a low-level employee at a department store in Sharjah. Tasneem got a job, but this led to more complications as her husband reportedly developed an inferiority complex. She returned to Bhopal and got a divorce on the ground that her husband was assaulting her.

 Disparities in economic and social levels are also driving many women to separation. Suhela is a bank manager who was married to her businessman cousin. Her husband?s business started making losses and coincided with his affair with a neighbour. This resulted in domestic quarrels gaining momentum.

 Suhela chose not to suffer silently. She walked away with her teenage daughter, saying economic independence gave her the strength to call off the marriage.

 Korea President set for Delhi trip

 PRANAY SHARMA

 New Delhi, Sept. 30: At a time when South Korea is coming under international pressure, especially from the Non-Aligned Movement, its President Roh Moo-hyun arrives here next week on a state visit to strengthen economic and political ties.

 Roh is the first South Korean President to visit India in eight years. His visit comes at a time when his country has come under pressure from the developing world over reports that it was pursuing a clandestine nuclear programme. 

 Revelations that South Korea till a few years ago was ?surreptitiously? trying to build a nuclear bomb have led North Korea to threaten to pull out of talks with key international players and resume its own nuclear programme.

 During his three-day visit starting on Monday, Roh will meet President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, foreign minister K. Natwar Singh and other senior leaders and officials.

 South Korea has invested $2.5 billion in India, the fifth-largest share of foreign direct investment in the country; bilateral trade is over $4 billion. Strengthening of economic and trade ties will figure prominently in Roh?s discussions with Indian leaders.

 The President is scheduled to address leading businessmen and industrialists at a function jointly organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry and the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry on Tuesday.

 Officials said South Korea, which has already invested significantly in key areas like automobiles and electronics, may try to look for new avenues, one of which could be ship-building. Seoul, in turn, may seek Delhi?s cooperation in information technology.

 At the political level, nuclear proliferation will be one of the main areas of discussion between the two. South Korea has been part of the six-nation talks to defuse the situation in its backyard after North Korea, which admits to pursuing a programme to develop nuclear bombs, threatened to pull out of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. 

 But recent reports revealing South Korea?s attempt to separate plutonium in 1982 and enrich uranium in 2000 in violation of international guidelines and its own obligations to the nuclear treaty have led to a fresh crisis.

 Seoul has argued that the programmes were unauthorised and did not have government sanction. But North Korea and Iran ? both of which are in the US firing-line for trying to secretly build nuclear bombs ? have accused the West of ?double standards? for going easy on South Korea. Both countries have threatened to pull out of talks with the West.

 The crisis has worsened after many developing nations, particularly NAM members, rallied behind Pyongyang and Tehran to put Seoul in a spot.

 Roh will try to convince Indian leaders that South Korea has no intention of pursuing a clandestine nuclear programme and will seek Delhi?s support to defuse the crisis.

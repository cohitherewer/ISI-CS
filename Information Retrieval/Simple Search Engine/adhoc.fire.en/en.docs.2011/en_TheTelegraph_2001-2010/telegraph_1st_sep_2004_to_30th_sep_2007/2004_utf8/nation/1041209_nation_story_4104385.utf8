 ?Friend? Laloo

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 8: Even as Opposition MPs were trying to corner Laloo Prasad Yadav in the Lok Sabha today on his spat with cabinet colleague Ram Vilas Paswan, the railway minister was seen chatting with Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee.

 Mamata had raised the issue of starvation deaths in several districts of Bengal and urged that a central team be sent to assess the situation. She said hundreds have died in Purulia, Bankura and the Dooars region. 

 The Congress-led government, she added, has started the food-for-work programme, but people were not getting any food.

 As soon as the House adjourned, Laloo Prasad, accompanied by fellow RJD member and minister for company affairs Prem Gupta, walked up to Mamata.

 Laloo Prasad and Gupta later said the RJD was thinking of sending a team to Bengal to ascertain details of the deaths and offer help to the needy. Neither the RJD leaders nor Mamata would say in what way the party could help. Quite a few Biharis are among those who have died of hunger in the tea gardens.

 Earlier, the BJP and the Janata Dal (United) had created an uproar over the Laloo Prasad-Paswan spat. 

 Leader of Opposition L.K. Advani led a walkout by the NDA after the government rejected the demand that the Prime Minister make a statement. Mamata, however, seemed reluctant to follow suit but was persuaded by some BJP members to join the walkout.

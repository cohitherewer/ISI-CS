The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Cricket battles today in court

 OUR BUREAU

 Sept. 13: Jagmohan Dalmiya?s naming as patron-in-chief of the cricket board and the award of telecast rights have, by coincidence, got tangled up.

 Both are expected to come up in court tomorrow ? the first in Bhopal where a contempt petition will be heard against Dalmiya, the BCCI president who was elevated to the post of patron-in-chief last week, vice-president Kamal Morarka and secretary S.K. Nair.

 The board of Zee Telefilms, locked in a dispute with ESPN-STAR Sports over telecast rights for matches in India over the next four years, met in Mumbai and said it would convey its decision to the high court tomorrow.

 Last Thursday, Bombay High Court had proposed that Zee and ESPN submit fresh bids to the court?s registrar-general, but both parties had to agree to it. Zee had sought time till Tuesday.

 ?We will inform the high court, along with the BCCI and ESPN, of our decision tomorrow morning,? said Ashish Kaul, vice-president, corporate brand development.

 If the network decides against fresh bidding, hearing in the case filed by ESPN, challenging award of the telecast rights to Zee, will resume.

 In the other case, on Friday, magistrate P.K. Nigam of a Bhopal court had directed that the BCCI could not go against its own rules while making Dalmiya the patron-in-chief. The board named him patron the day after.

 Today, the court accepted another petition filed by the same person, Yogesh Khattar, challenging the BCCI decision. 

 Khattar?s application has sought attachment of property and three months? detention for ?violating? the court?s order.

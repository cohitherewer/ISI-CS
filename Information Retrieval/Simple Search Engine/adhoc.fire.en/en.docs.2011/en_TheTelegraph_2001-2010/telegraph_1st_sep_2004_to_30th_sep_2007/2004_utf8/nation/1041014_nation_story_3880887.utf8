 Traffic revolt looms on info highway

 B.R. SRIKANTH

 Bangalore, Oct. 13: Traffic snarls in the country?s Silicon Valley could take a turn for the worse on Friday with employees of IT companies located inside the Electronics City campus threatening a protest.

 Several companies, including Infosys Technologies, Wipro, Siemens Information Systems and Motorola, are housed here. Employees have to negotiate a number of bottlenecks on their way to the Electronics City, about 20 km from Bangalore on the national highway to Hosur, Tamil Nadu.

 A flyover was constructed last year to ease traffic flow, but heavy vehicles clog the road during peak hours.

 Last week, the IT department got into overdrive to soothe the tempers of chief executive officers of some companies that threatened to boycott IT.COM, Karnataka?s flagship event scheduled for November 1-5, over the same issue. 

 The CEOs were informed of chief minister Dharam Singh?s intentions to discuss the problems of infrastructure at a meeting next weekend.

 As a prelude to the discussions with Singh, the chief executive officers are scheduled to meet M.K. Shankarlinge Gowda, secretary, IT department, tomorrow. 

 ?Some of these issues can be addressed at this level and that?s why I have invited them over for breakfast,? Shankarlinge Gowda said.

 However, the Electronics City Industries Association has called a protest on Friday. The protest would draw the attention of the chief minister and his colleagues to the state of the road, said .R. Narayana Murthy, chairman of Infosys Technologies.

 The mode of protest would be decided tomorrow, though Narayana Murthy hinted that employees would hold up traffic on the national highway.

 H. Prakash Rao, the president of the Electronics City Industries Association, said: ?We are certain to do something to express our frustration.?

 Prakash Rao said the government has not responded to the association?s plea for diversion of heavy vehicles for three hours in the morning and evening. ?We want the link roads to be activated so that these trucks deviate from the highway. We need a solution, and a quick one at that,? he added.

 The association has agreed in principle to part-fund the Rs 360-crore elevated four-lane motorway over a nine-km stretch proposed by the Union Government to link the city with the Electronics City. The feasibility study would be completed by April next year and construction completed in three years.

 On the woes of the IT industry, Nandan Nilekani, CEO of Infosys Technologies, said Bangalore should not lose its brand equity because of poor infrastructure. 

 ?All of us are concerned about the slowdown in development of infrastructure. We have raised this concern, but we must not compromise on the global brand that has been built over the years,? he said.

 In 1996, the employees of companies situated inside the Electronics City had blocked traffic on the national highway to draw the attention of the then Janata Dal government to the pathetic road conditions. 

 Such a move prompted the J.H. Patel administration to hasten work on a four-lane approach to Hosur.

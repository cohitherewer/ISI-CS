 Siblings frown on Andhra talks 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Hyderabad, Sept. 21: Seven voices of concern left hosts Andhra Pradesh isolated at a meeting of Naxalite-hit states here today as they cast doubts on the new government?s move to hold talks with rebels despite their refusal to give up arms. 

 Almost all the representatives of the other states said Andhra?s individual approach could not solve the problem and called for the Centre to work out a common strategy.

 ?Unless the Centre promotes a uniform policy for tackling the extremist menace, it is difficult to curb the extremist violence,? Chhattisgarh home minister Brij Mohan Agrawal said. 

 Agrawal said rebels were hiding in Andhra after launching strikes in his state. 

 The chief ministers of Andhra, Jharkhand and Orissa attended the meeting, chaired by Union home minister Shivraj Patil. Among the others who participated were senior ministers and officials of the home ministry of Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Bihar and Bengal.

 The conclave was held in Hyderabad to highlight the new Congress regime?s approach to tackling the Naxalite menace. The Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy government said it was fulfilling its election promise of holding talks with the People?s War Group. 

 Reddy defended his state?s strategy, saying the ?objective is driven by an ambitious programme to lift agriculture from its present low level in Andhra?. His home minister, K. Jana Reddy, made a presentation on the dialogue and other features of the truce, including the contentious clause banning carrying of arms by the rebels during negotiations. 

 But nearly all the other states rooted for a common plan. ?The divergent policies and programmes of each state on internal security is going to be a disaster,? Jharkhand chief minister Arjun Munda said. 

 He wanted the Centre to liberally fund development activities in Naxalite-affected areas. ?Such a measure will go a long way rather than holding talks with them,? Munda said.

 Orissa chief minister Naveen Patnaik said he recently met a delegation of PWG leaders at Bhubaneswar and was keen on a lasting solution to the problem. ?But it has to be constitutional and feasible.? 

 Bengal home secretary A.K. Deb said his state, too, was keen to hold talks with extremists. ?The problem in my state is that we do not know who the leaders of these groups are. The leaders hail from Andhra Pradesh,? he said. 

 Patil said the Centre had no specific role as law and order was a state subject. ?We are telling the state governments we are always available for any advice, monetary support or supply of troops, if needed,? he said. But the decision to tackle the menace, either through force or negotiation, was the prerogative of the states. 

 Reddy later told reporters that Patil had left the decision on the contentious issue of negotiations to the states.

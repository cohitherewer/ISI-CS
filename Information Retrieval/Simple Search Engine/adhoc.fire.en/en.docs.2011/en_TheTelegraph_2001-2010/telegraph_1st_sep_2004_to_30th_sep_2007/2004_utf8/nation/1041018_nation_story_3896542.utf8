 Singh says thanks over lunch

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 17: In a first for Manmohan Singh, the Prime Minister today interacted with top Congress functionaries by inviting general secretaries to lunch at 7 Race Course Road to thank them for the Maharashtra results.

 But two important general secretaries ? Margaret Alva and Digvijay Singh, who are in charge of Maharashtra ? were absent.

 They were in Mumbai closeted with Congress legislature members to discuss the ticklish issue of chief ministership now that the party and its ally, the Nationalist Congress Party, have retained power in the state. Two others, Ambika Soni and Salman Khursheed, turned up for the informal meeting.

 This is the first time Singh has held interactions with party functionaries. 

 Usually, it is Congress chief Sonia Gandhi who deals with organisational matters. One of the common complaints about Singh is that he is not a ?political person?.

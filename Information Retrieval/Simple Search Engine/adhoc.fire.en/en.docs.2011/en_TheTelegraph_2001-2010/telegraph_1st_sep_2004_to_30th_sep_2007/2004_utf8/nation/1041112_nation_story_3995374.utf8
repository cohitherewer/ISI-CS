 Pakistan welcomes ?wise? decision

 IMTIAZ GUL AND AGENCIES

 Islamabad, Nov. 11: Pakistan today welcomed India?s decision on troop reduction in Jammu and Kashmir, saying ?it is a good decision in the right direction?.

 ?This is a welcome development,? Pakistan Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz told reporters minutes before leaving for Cairo to attend the funeral of Palestinian President Yasser Arafat.

 Aziz, however, appeared cautious when he refused further comments, saying he had not yet seen the full text of Manmohan Singh?s statement.

 Pakistan foreign ministry spokesman Masood Khan said here the ?wise decision by the Indian Prime Minister? would help the ongoing peace process between the two countries.

 Delhi and Islamabad had resumed long-stalled talks in February. The two sides will hold a fresh round of meetings later this month and in December.

 ?The decision will augur well for the people of Indian-administered Kashmir besides making atmosphere in the Valley conducive,? Khan said.

 In Jammu and Kashmir, the positive reaction of moderate separatists and political parties to Singh?s decision was met with the discordant note of the hardline faction of the Hurriyat Conference.

 Its chief Syed Ali Shah Geelani said the scaling down of troops would have no impact in the Valley and demanded total withdrawal of the forces and the Armed Forces Special Powers Act and the Disturbed Areas Act.

 Moderate faction leader Maulana Abbas Ansari, however, described the decision as ?a good step? but said the question was not the number of troops but their behaviour with the people.

 Asked whether they are now encouraged to resume talks with the Centre, Ansari said the Hurriyat executive committee will meet after Id to decide.

 Senior separatist leader Shabir Shah dubbed Singh?s decision ?bold? and ?encouraging?.

 Chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed and ruling People?s Democratic Party president Mehbooba Mufti termed it the ?biggest ever? confidence-building measure, post-ceasefire.

 National Conference chief Omar Abdullah, too, welcomed the decision but sought withdrawal of the armed forces act.

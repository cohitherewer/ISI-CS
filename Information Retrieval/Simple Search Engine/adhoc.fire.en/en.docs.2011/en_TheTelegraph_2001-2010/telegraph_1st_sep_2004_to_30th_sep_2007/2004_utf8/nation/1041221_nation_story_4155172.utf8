 Net smut touches Telugu actor

 - Complaint filed against video clip showing bathroom scene

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, Dec. 20: Net perverts haven?t had it so good.

 After the Delhi school sex-clip that went online, a bathroom scene that shows Telugu star Trisha taking a shower has further steamed up the season of smut.

 Footage showing the actor, who said the video clip was morphed, undressing and then stepping under the shower has been on the Net for the last few days in the city. Before that the clip, which now can be accessed only after it is e-mailed, did the rounds in Chennai for nearly a month.

 A local Telugu channel has showed the video clip in all its bulletins. 

 The video is the latest piece of smut to hit the Net after a clip showing two former students of a Delhi school in a sexual act made it to the online auction site baazee.com.

 The 17-year-old boy, who police said had filmed himself while engaging in the sex act and then transmitted the images shot by his camera mobile phone, was arrested last evening.

 Trisha, who has also acted in a number of Tamil films but is famous for her role in the hit Telugu movie Varsham, said she had heard of the morphed version in Chennai. ?I was shocked to see one such clipping at a friend?s house,? she said. ?It appeared like a key-hole artist?s operation enhanced digitally.?

 The clip was allegedly available on a website but was withdrawn ?after the furore?, a police source said.

 Trisha said she has filed a police complaint in Chennai and also with Hyderabad police who have registered a case under the cyber crime act at both places. Posting obscene mails and pictures on the Net is an offence under the act.

 Asked if she suspected anyone, she said: ?This is a scene from a bathroom. Everyone has to take a bath every day. With my shooting scheduled all over the country, I really do not recognise where it might have happened.?

 In her complaint to Hyderabad police, Trisha had, however, said the clip ?closely resembled her? but was not her. She made the same point when she spoke to reporters. ?It might resemble me, but it is not me. I have filed police complaints to ensure that such heinous and mentally sick acts are firmly contained,? she said.

 The actor, in the city to shoot for the Telugu film Nevu Vasthavante Ne Vaddantana (How will I say no to you), told a local television channel that she is determined to fight the menace. ?I know at least half-a-dozen cine artistes are suffering embarrassment due to circulation of their morphed video versions,? she said. 

 ?But this is the first time that someone has dared to take it seriously.?

 Additional commissioner of police A.K. Khan said the origin of the video files could be traced by their Internet Protocol numbers. ?We are waiting for Chennai police to forward details of the case to us,? Khan said.

 Recently, the city?s cyber police tracked down a caller from Visakhapatnam who had been harassing an IPS officer?s wife. 

 Making obscene calls on mobile phones is a serious offence under the IT Act, 2000.

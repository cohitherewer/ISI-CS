 Threat to raise private army

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Bhopal, Nov. 1: Last week?s massacre in Bhanwarpura has taken a casteist colour with the Gujjar community threatening to raise a ?Gujjar Sena? on the lines of the Ranbir Sena in Bihar.

 Dacoit Rambabu Gadaria had gunned down 12 people in Bhanwarpura village in Ghatigaon, Gwalior on Friday.

 A Gujjar community leader and state chief of Gujjar Vikas Parishad, Virender Singh Harshana, said a ?mahapanchayat? has been convened at Phoolpur in Gwalior to chalk out the community?s response.

 He said the Gujjars would assess the state government?s anti-dacoit drive till Diwali (November 12) before taking law into their hands. ?We Gujjars are a warrior tribe and capable of taking on dacoits like Rambabu Gadaria,? he said.

 Another dacoit, Nirbhay Singh Gujjar, has also jumped in the fray. Nirbhay, who is wanted in dozens of cases of kidnapping, murder and extortion, and carries a prize of Rs 5 lakh on his head, said he would ?teach Rambabu a lesson.?

 He yesterday sent his emissaries to Bhanwarpura and surrounding areas with a message that the villagers should not remain dependent on a ?defunct state police? and he would seek a ?befitting revenge?.

 The Gujjar community?s move to raise a ?sena? has alarmed the police, politicians and bureaucracy alike. Senior police officials who had supervised anti-dacoity operations in Chambal said the trend was alarming. In spite of poverty and social discrimination, clashes between communities have been rare. 

 ?If one social group forms a sena, another group would not fall behind and this could lead to a Bihar-like situation,? said a police officer of inspector-general rank in Bhopal.

 The Congress has also seized the opportunity to settle political scores. Besides despatching a team of party MPs consisting of Jyotiraditya Scindia, Avtar Singh Bhadana and Sachin Pilot, the Congress has accused the BJP of ?patronising? Gadaria. Bhadana and Pilot hail from the Gujjar community. 

 State Congress spokesman Manak Aggarwal claimed that in last year?s Assembly polls, Gadaria had canvassed for the BJP candidate, Narendra Bhirthare, now an MLA. Bhirthare has, however, denied the charge.

 Pilot, who visited Bhanwarpura today, demanded that the Madhya Pradesh government increase compensation to the families of the massacre victims from Rs 2 lakh to Rs 5 lakh.

 Condemning the attack, the Congress MP promised Rs 50,000 to the next of kin of those killed and urged the government to ensure safety to the villagers.

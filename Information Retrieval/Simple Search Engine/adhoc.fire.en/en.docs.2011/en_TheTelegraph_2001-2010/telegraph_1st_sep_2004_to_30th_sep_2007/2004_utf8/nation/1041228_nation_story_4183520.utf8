Islamabad, Dec. 27: India appears to have given up its insistence on passports being the only valid document for passengers boarding the proposed Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus. 

 Indications are that Delhi is willing to accept permits issued by Pakistani authorities so that the buses roll out without further delays.

 The issue will come up for discussion between the foreign secretary Shyam Saran and his Pakistani counterpart Riaz Khokhar tomorrow.

 Sources said the clearance for accepting permits and the toning down of India?s ?passport only? stand was taken at a recent meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Security in Delhi, chaired by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.

 Saran, who briefed leaders on his proposed visit to Pakistan, apparently got the green signal to accept the Pakistani suggestion on the proposed bus service.

 A reason for the shift in India?s stand might stem from its understanding that Pakistan would make all efforts, even by putting up more conditions, to stall the proposed bus service.

 Pakistani foreign minister Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri told reporters today that differences between the two sides on the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus service had narrowed down. ?Hopefully, my optimism will not be belied,? he said. 

 The Indian side also gave indications that an agreement on the issue could now be possible. The sources said India was willing to show ?flexibility? without compromising on its stated position on Jammu and Kashmir.

 Delhi claims that the entire state of Jammu and Kashmir, including the part under Pakistan?s ?illegal? occupation, is an ?integral part? of India. Pakistan, however, claims that the entire area is disputed.

 Delhi?s insistence on accepting only passports as valid documents for the bus service has been opposed by Islamabad as it fears that this would only legitimise India?s stand on Jammu and Kashmir.

 Pakistan has also been insisting that the bus service be exclusively for the people of Jammu and Kashmir.

 The idea of the bus service was initially floated by India to bring the people of Jammu and Kashmir, living on the two sides of the Line of Control, closer. 

 ?Instead of a wall, the LoC could become a bridge for Kashmiris on the two sides,? sources said.

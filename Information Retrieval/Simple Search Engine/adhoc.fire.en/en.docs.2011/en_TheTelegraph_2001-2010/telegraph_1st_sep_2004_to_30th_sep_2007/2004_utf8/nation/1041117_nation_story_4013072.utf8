 Court blow to foreign doctors 

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 16: The Supreme Court today upheld the guidelines of the Union health ministry and the Medical Council of India that doctors from foreign universities have to clear a screening test before being allowed to practise in India.

 A bench of Chief Justice R.C. Lahoti and Justices Ashok Bhan and G.P. Mathur dismissed several petitions filed by doctors who got their degrees from medical colleges in Russia and other CIS countries.

 Justice Bhan, writing for the bench in the Russian doctors? case, said the medical council would conduct the screening test as per the guidelines approved by the health ministry on June 13, 2004.

 About 5,000 doctors contended that as they had acquired medical degrees after clearing many tests during their six-year studies in CIS colleges, they should not be subjected to an additional test as a qualifying examination to practise in their mother country.

 Under Section 13 of the Medical Council of India Act, any person obtaining a medical degree from a foreign country has to clear the screening test conducted by the council before being allowed to practise in India.

 Information law 

 The Supreme Court has sent notices to the Centre, the states and the Union territories on how long it would take to implement the right to information law, passed by Parliament in 2002 and ratified by the President the next year, reports our legal correspondent. 

 The law enables members of the public as well as the press to apply for documents they want to scrutinise and get their own copies by paying the photocopying charges. 

 However, classified documents of defence and other similar departments are exempted. 

 A division bench of Justices N. Santosh Hegde and S.B. Sinha issued the notices on a public interest litigation filed by one Sanjay Goel, who pointed out that the law has not been notified so far in the official gazette, rendering it unenforceable. 

 He sought a direction from the court to the Centre to fix a reasonable time frame for enforcing the act.

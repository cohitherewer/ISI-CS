 Terror law set to get a year

 R. VENKATARAMAN

 New Delhi, Sept. 3: The Centre has drafted a sunset clause for the Prevention of Terrorism Act that will enable it to launch prosecutions for another year.

 The Centre drafted this clause even as the law ministry readied an ordinance to repeal the anti-terror law and sent it to the home ministry yesterday. Sources say the ordinance will be promulgated any time now.

 The spirit of the anti-terror law should survive in the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, that is currently being given a facelift.

 Contrary to the United Progressive Alliance governments posturing on repealing Pota, the ordinance has provided the Centre and states an enabling provision to launch prosecutions under the legislation even after it lapses. The sunset clause will enable registration of new cases.

 The Congress-led UPA had promised it would repeal the anti-terror law when it came to power even though it was set to lapse on October 23 anyway.

 The sunset clause is so called because ordinarily in a repeal bill or act, a specific period is mentioned within which offences purported to have been committed during the existence of an act could be proceeded under the same act although it has been repealed or has lapsed, a source said

 The best example is the lapse of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (Fera) and the introduction of the Foreign Exchange Management Act (Fema). Under Fera, a foreign exchange violation was a criminal act but it counted only as a civil wrong under Fema. 

 But Fera was provided a sunset clause that continued till June 2003 even though Fema had replaced it 12 months ago. The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence also launched prosecutions by serving notice to different companies and individuals during that period.

 Likewise, the sunset clause for Pota will enable the police, other prosecution agencies and various state governments and the Centre to launch prosecution under the act against those who committed offences punishable under Pota.

 However, the central Pota review committees decision would be final and it would review cases launched and give its verdict whether the prosecution launched is right or wrong. If the committee opines that the prosecution is wrong, then state governments or the Centre have to withdraw the case, sources said.

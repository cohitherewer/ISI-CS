 New Delhi, Sept. 8: India and Pakistan have agreed to start the next round of the composite dialogue from December, indicating that they would remain engaged in talks at least till March 2005, irrespective of their differences on Kashmir.

 The joint statement issued here this afternoon made it clear that Pakistan foreign minister Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri was as keen as his Indian counterpart K. Natwar Singh to show some progress in their two-day talks before he returned to Islamabad.

 Both countries agreed on 13 proposals that included meetings between experts on conventional and nuclear confidence-building measures.

 The statement ? which almost read like the one issued at the end of the foreign secretary-level talks in June ? once again tried to balance the Indian concern on infiltration and the Pakistani desire to show progress on Kashmir.

 ?Recalling the reassurances contained in the (Vajpayee-Musharraf) joint press statement of January 6, 2004, they (the ministers) exchanged views on carrying the process forward in an atmosphere free from terrorism and violence,? the statement said.

 The ministers, it added, iterated they were confident that the composite dialogue would lead to ?peaceful settlement of all bilateral issues, including Jammu and Kashmir, to the satisfaction of both sides?.

 The two sides for the first time also agreed to include a new category for ?tourists? in their visa regime, which clearly signalled the rising desire among the peoples to visit each other?s country.

 Earlier, an Indian or a Pakistani wanting to visit each other?s country had to find a relative to sponsor their trip. The new proposal would allow visits to any part of either country as a tourist.

 Discussions are scheduled on the proposed Muzaffarabad-Srinagar bus service, particularly to iron out differences on travel documents to be used by the people of the two Kashmirs.

 The foreign secretaries will meet in December ? on a date to be announced later ? to discuss peace and security and Jammu and Kashmir, two of the eight issues that form the composite dialogue.

 The two sides also significantly agreed to cooperate in the energy sector. The petroleum ministers would meet in the coming days to see how ?availability and access to energy resources in the region around South Asia? could be used in their ?multifarious? dimensions.

 Also, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf are scheduled to meet for the first time on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York later this month.

 In November, new Pakistan Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz would visit Delhi as Saarc chairman, but is expected to review the peace process and give it the required push.

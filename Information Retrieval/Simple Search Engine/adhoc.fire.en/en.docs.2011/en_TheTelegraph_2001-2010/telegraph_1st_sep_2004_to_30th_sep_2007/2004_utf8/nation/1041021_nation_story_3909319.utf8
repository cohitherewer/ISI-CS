The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Forgotten Hero in London festival fadeout

 - Anticipated delay before censors forces Benegal to call off screening of film on Netaji

 London, Oct, 20: Ever the 

 man of mystery, now Netaji has also ?disappeared? from London.

 Shyam Benegal?s much anticipated blockbuster on Netaji Subhas Bose has been pulled out from the London Film Festival, it was announced today.

 The four-hour ?historical epic?, Bose: The Forgotten Hero, starring Sachin Khedekar in the lead role, was due to have been screened on November 3 but has been withdrawn after apparently running into problems with the censors back in India. 

 ?The print won?t be here on time,? said a spokeswoman for Premiere PR, an agency which is handling publicity on behalf of the London Film Festival.

 The cancellation has caused intense disappointment ? and not only among Indians ? because the film was one of the highlights of the festival.

 Its removal follows the cancellation also of Rituparno Ghosh?s Raincoat, starring Aishwarya Rai, which was pulled off by Venus, its distributors who apparently did not want the film to be exposed to public viewing before its general release in the UK. The logic might be that negative ?word of mouth? about a ?talking heads? film emanating from those lucky enough to get tickets at the festival might not help its long-term prospects.

 The Bose film was sold out at NFT3, the National Film Theatre?s small theatre, for November 3, and an extra screening had been organised for November 4 at NFT1, the more spacious hall. This, too, had been practically sold out. 

 Now, having put the organisers through hoops, the Indians have left the festival in the lurch. 

 A reliable source told The Telegraph today: ?The film was withdrawn by Shyam Benegal because he felt he would not get it past the censors in time. Any Indian film requires a certificate from the Indian censors before it is released for international viewing.?

 The source added that ?sometimes a film is held up because it has too much sex or violence but this certainly does not have sex. 

 It could be that they don?t like the disparaging comments Hitler makes about the Indians ? he looks down his nose at them and says they would be better off under the British. You never know with Indian censors. In India, the censor board behaves quite erratically. The only way the situation can be saved is for the government to intervene.?

 One of the few people in London to have seen a cut of the film in September is Rajinder Cary Sawhney, who works for the British Film Institute and is an adviser to the festival.

 Today he said that although he personally felt that ?at four hours (222 minutes, actually), the film is, perhaps, too long?, ?it is a very important historical film. It has an interesting role for Adolf Hitler and the film has a very thorough, detailed and accurate perspective on Bose?s life?.

 In his programmes notes for the festival brochure, Sawhney has promoted the blockbuster in glowing terms: ?Acclaimed film-maker Shyam Benegal?s biopic explores the controversial life of Subhas Chandra Bose, the Bengali freedom fighter who renounced Gandhi?s non-violence teachings and declared open warfare on the British empire.

 ?He escapes from imprisonment in British Calcutta, travelling to Berlin where he meets Adolf Hitler, who is disparaging and lukewarm in his support. Frustrated, he leaves Germany in a U-boat to South East Asia. Here, he links up with the Japanese to begin his own war. 

 ?Benegal depicts the multi-facted nature of the inner man and his doubts and drives, while unveiling a historical perspective rarely afforded in the West. Some fine performances are elicited on the way from his players, including Sachin Khedekar as Bose, Rajit Kapur as Abid Hasan, Kulbhushan Kharbanda as Uttamchand Malhotra, Alan Thomson as Lord Wavell, Nicholas Chagrin as General Auchinlek and Udo Schenk as Hitler.?

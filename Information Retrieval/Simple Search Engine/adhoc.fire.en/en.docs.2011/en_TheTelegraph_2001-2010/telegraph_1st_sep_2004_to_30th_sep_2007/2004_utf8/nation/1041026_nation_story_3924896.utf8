 RBI clears air over coins

 Chandigarh, Oct. 25 (PTI): The Reserve Bank of India today rubbished reports that 25 and 50 paisa coins have been withdrawn from circulation.

 The central bank said it has come across reports in the media and has also received complaints that shopkeepers, traders and transport undertakings had refused to accept these coins.

 ?Such complaints are based on misinformation that these coins have ceased to be legal tender,? an RBI release said.

 The central bank added that people should not believe such rumours. ?These coins are legal tender and will continue to be so. The Reserve Bank and all commercial banks will continue to freely accept all the coins for exchange in bank notes,? said a statement by the RBI.

 Rao raves, Cong gets even

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Rao, Jaya: Court date

 Hyderabad, Sept. 15: The Andhra Pradesh Congress today hit back at Telengana Rashtra Samiti president K. Chandrasekhar Rao for hurling insults at Sonia Gandhi by demolishing his constituency office in Karimnagar town.

 Furious over a proposal to form a second state reorganisation committee, Rao had threatened to ?drag both Sonia Gandhi and (chief minister) Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy to the streets?.

 Former state Congress president P. Janardhan Reddy led a procession in Hyderabad today, demanding unconditional apology from Rao within 24 hours, failing which he threatened to drag the Telengana leader to the streets. ?I will expose all the underhand deals of the former TDP leader and wash his dirty linen in public,? Reddy said.

 In Karimnagar, around 50 people gatecrashed into Rao?s office and destroyed furniture, air-conditioners, telephones, computers and books. They also burnt an effigy of the TRS president. Police have clamped Section 144 in the town.

 Earlier, Rao appeared in the court of the fifth metropolitan magistrate, who had issued a non-bailable warrant against him in a cheating case. He has been accused of fraud while issuing party tickets for the Assembly polls.

 The magistrate cancelled the warrant on the basis of two sureties and a personal bond. The next hearing has been posted to October 14 and the minister has been exempt from personal appearance.

 Actor-turned-Samajwadi Party MP Jayaprada and former Union minister S. Venugopal, charged with violating the election code of conduct during the Hyderabad civic polls, also appeared in the court this morning.

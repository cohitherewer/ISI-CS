 Junior seer to be questioned today

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Kancheepuram, Dec. 25: Police have summoned Vijayendra Saraswati, the junior pontiff of the Kanchi Mutt, for questioning tomorrow over the murder of Shankar Raman on September 3.

 The summons came barely an hour after mutt manager Sundaresa Iyer this afternoon denied the prosecution?s charge that he had paid Rs 55 lakh to the killers of Shankar Raman, the manager of the Varadaraja Perumal temple.

 Iyer, who was arrested late last night, was remanded in judicial custody till January 7 by the first judicial magistrate, G. Uthamaraj, who recorded the statement at a special holiday sitting in his chamber. Iyer was then taken to the Chennai central prison.

 The special investigation team?s summons to Vijayendra Saraswati, asking him to be present at its office at 10 am tomorrow, brought gloom to the mutt as both the peetapathis will technically be in police custody at the same time. Kanchi acharya Jayendra Saraswati is already in Vellore central prison. This has put a cloud over the Dhanur Maasa puja tomorrow.

 Iyer, a retired bank official, was arrested on the basis of disclosures by Appu alias Krishnasamy Reddy, who is in police custody. He was charged under IPC sections 302 (murder) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy).

 However, Iyer, who has been interrogated at least 15 times over the past one month, was given to understand that he ?will be taken as a witness?, according to a mutt lawyer.

 In his deposition at the magistrate?s court, which he reached around 1.45 pm, Iyer refuted the charge of having given Rs 55 lakh to the killers. The mutt manager, who signs all the cheques, said a cheque of Rs 5 lakh was ?given to one person? (allegedly Ravi Subramanian) for some construction activity.

 ?The person concerned had himself signed on the back of the cheque and withdrawn the money from the bank,? Y. Thyagarajan, a senior advocate for the Kanchi Mutt, quoted the manager as saying. ?So, the question of me taking the money and disbursing it does not arise,? said Iyer.

 Ravi Subramanian, a Chennai-based builder, is yet to be arrested and is said to be in Bhopal.

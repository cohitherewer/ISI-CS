 Left union fires PF gun at Centre

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Nov. 9: Left trade unions are meeting here tomorrow to assess the impact of the increase in petrol and LPG prices but they opened another front with the Centre today, criticising the labour ministry.

 The CPI?s trade union wing, Aituc, alleged that the Employees? Provident Fund Organisation was protecting defaulters, mainly central PSUs.

 ?We are seriously alarmed at the functioning of the labour ministry, which is found to be wanting in protecting workers? interests,? general secretary Gurudas Dasgupta said. 

 After a meeting of the consultative committee on labour, he said: ?There is total callousness on the part of EPFO since arrears amount to Rs 2,000 crore. There are unclaimed funds to the tune of Rs 942 crore and as much as Rs 8,071 crore is lying in inoperative accounts.? The central PSUs alone account for Rs 822 crore in arrears.

 The Centre has agreed to their demand for setting up flying squads and a meeting with regional provident fund commissioners next month.

 Dasgupta also said the provident fund interest rate should be restored to 9.5 per cent from 8.5 per cent. ?The way I understood them (Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and finance minister P. Chidambaram) was that EPF interest will be increased,? he said to a query on the trade unions? previous meetings with the Centre.

 Assailing the increase in the prices of petroleum products, he hit out at the oil ministry?s contention that LPG was still the cheapest in the subcontinent. ?Let us not take lessons from anybody,? Dasgupta said, when asked to comment on the internal note that made the comparative study. A 14.5-kg LPG cylinder in Delhi at the new price of Rs 281.60 is cheaper than cooking gas in Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, the note stated.

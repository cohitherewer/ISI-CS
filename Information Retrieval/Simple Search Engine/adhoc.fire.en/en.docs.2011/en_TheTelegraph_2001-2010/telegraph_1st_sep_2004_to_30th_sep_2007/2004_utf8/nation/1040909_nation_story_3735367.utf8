 Babus jockey to keep asset cover

 ALOKE TIKKU

 New Delhi, Sept. 8: Babus are not ready to bare all.

 A proposal to have central government officials make their assets public has the bureaucrats crying foul. Their argument: ?We are public servants, not public figures.?

 Questions are also being raised on the advantages of the move. Besides, the bureaucrats ask, who in the government is going to find the time to upload thousands of pages detailing their assets?

 The P.C. Hota committee ? set up to recommend measures to make the civil services transparent, accountable and ethical ? had suggested in July that property returns of central government officers be made available on the Internet. Hota is a former Union Public Service Commission chairman.

 The report, which is being debated in the government, argues that this would enable any person familiar with details of property owned by a public servant to compare the declared assets with the actual wealth and report to the government if there is a major discrepancy.

 Existing civil conduct rules require government officials to submit annual property returns to their departments detailing expenditure incurred on acquisition, construction or extension of their immovable assets.

 Officials said this information is treated as ?privileged communication? between an employee and an employer and there is no reason to put it in the public domain. 

 The Hota committee, a senior official said, had failed to note that there was a distinction between a public servant and a public figure.

 Unlike politicians, who are in public life and are required to declare their assets when contesting elections so that voters know who they are electing, he said: ?We are not directly responsible or answerable to the people but the government, which is informed about the assets owned by us.?

 Bureaucrats against the move also argue that the recommendation, if implemented, would be an intrusion into their privacy without any commensurate benefits. 

 ?Do you really expect people to come up with instances where the official has under-reported his assets?? asked one, wondering if making their assets public had helped catch corrupt politicians.

 On this point, bureaucrats appear to have the support of police officers entrusted to catch corrupt public servants. A senior police officer who has spent the better part of the last four years in the CBI tracking down the corrupt said: ?More than anything else, I think it is impractical.?

 Close to 80,000 central government officials are covered by the committee?s recommendations and it would be a mammoth task to upload property returns for all of them and update them every year. 

 ?Given the government?s track record in updating its websites, it will never be updated even if a special exercise is carried out to upload the data the first year,? the police officer said.

 Instead, the CBI officer called for enforcing existing rules on filing of annual property returns and introducing a law that would allow the government to confiscate property not declared. 

 ?There are several departments where most officials have not filed their annual property returns for years, even decades, but no one bothers,? the officer said.

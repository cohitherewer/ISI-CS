 Zahira rerun in Kerala

 JOHN MARY 

 Thiruvananthapuram, Nov. 4: A day after Zahira Sheikh?s stunning turnaround in the Best Bakery case, a young housewife retracted her allegation of sexual abuse against a minister in Kerala within hours of her arrest in a six-year-old attempted suicide case. 

 Rejina, 23, who triggered a political furore with her accusations, today shouted to reporters on the premises of the Kozhikode first class judicial magistrate?s court: ?It was all because Ajita wanted me to say so? I?ve nothing more to say.?

 K. Ajita, president of the Anweshi Women?s Counselling Centre, had taken up Rejina?s case. She was planning to form a common forum of women?s organisations to fight for her against industry minister P.K. Kunhalikutty. 

 Rejina?s retraction had shades of Zahira?s recant. The Best Bakery witness said yesterday in a statement that Teesta Setalvad, a human rights activist who had helped reopen the Best Bakery case, had ?tutored? her to implicate innocent people in the Gujarat riot case. 

 Last week, Rejina said Kunhalikutty had ?used? her three times at different locations when he served in the 1991-96 A.K. Antony cabinet and later bribed her into retracting her charges before a magistrate. 

 Ajita said she suspects that Rejina retracted her charges under duress. She wanted to know which notary had signed her statement because Rejina doesn?t know how to write. 

 Rejina?s brother Ayub told reporters in Kozhikode today that their mother Fatima had been instigating her to go back on her statement against the minister. 

 Rejina?s retraction came after the police produced her before the magistrate in connection with a 1988 case, in which she is alleged to have barged into the house of her lover, Prasad, and tried to commit suicide for deserting her. 

 She submitted a written statement to the magistrate, but its contents are under wraps.

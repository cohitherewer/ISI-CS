 Laloo amp; rival spared stick

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Patna, Dec. 26: With the Election Commission not taking any drastic action in the cases of alleged violation of the model code in Bihar, the Rashtriya Janata Dal and the Janata Dal (United) today heaved a sigh of relief that their top leaders were spared the rod, at least for now.

 Laloo Prasad Yadav and George Fernandes are facing charges of ?bribing? voters and cases have been registered against them under Section 171-B of the Indian Penal Code at Bihta (Patna) and Muzaffarpur respectively.

 According to sources, any immediate action against the two senior leaders was unlikely as the charges framed against them are yet to be proved. 

 ?The inquiry will take its course and the poll panel is not expected to act on its own. Other matters of the model code violation can, however, attract action after December 31,? they added.

 The Election Commission has directed that all banners, hoardings, posters and cutouts put up by the RJD and other political parties on public properties in violation of the code be removed by December 31.

 The election panel does not seem to be in a hurry as Bihar chief secretary K.A.H. Subramaniam, too, has been directed to investigate how public property was defaced, especially in the run-up to the RJD?s December 23 rally, which was called off by Laloo Prasad at the last moment.

 Subramaniam is also to fix accountability and identify officials who failed to ensure that the model code of conduct was not violated and report to the Election Commission by January 5. 

 ?It is certain that the EC believes that the poll code was violated in Bihar. That is why the state government has been asked to recover the expenses incurred in removing the hoardings and banners from the political party concerned,? a government source said.

 The election panel looks determined to ensure that the code is strictly adhered to in all districts. 

 Initially, only the district administrations of Patna and Hajipur, where Election Commission consultant K.J. Rao went during his inspection, registered cases of code violation. ?But now, all district magistrates have been asked to be on guard,? the source added. 

 On the same day, Fernandes has gone from denying that he paid money to a woman in Muzaffarpur to maintaining that he was ?ready to be jailed? and that he would not offer any explanation to the poll panel.

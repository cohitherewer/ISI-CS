 Bhiwandi, Oct. 11: Maharashtra erupted with the blame game with political bigwigs lunging at each other?s throats as the campaign for the Assembly elections drew to a close at 5 pm today, but Sonia Gandhi had the last word.

 Her day began at 11.30 with a rally in Bhiwandi, the ?powerloom town? about 60 km from Mumbai, where she flew in two hours late and addressed a crowd of about 15,000 that seemed to fill up the stadium at Dhobi Talao slowly and a little reluctantly. 

 Launching a veiled but strong attack at the Samajwadi Party, which has fielded its Maharashtra chief Abu Asim Azmi here, Sonia said certain parties shed crocodile tears for the minorities while being hand-in-glove with communal forces. Azmi has a good chance of winning from Muslim-dominated Bhiwandi, observers say. 

 Sonia said levelling personal allegations was against her culture, but did not spare the ?communal forces? of the BJP-Shiv Sena and the ?former Prime Minister who came to Mumbai yesterday?. 

 ?Yesterday, he said there is no discrimination against communities in Maharashtra,? Sonia said, referring to the joint rally addressed by Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray. ?Yeh bilkul jhoot hai (This is an absolute lie).?

 The Congress chief added that the BJP-Sena has not only encouraged communal disharmony in Maharashtra, but also in other parts of India like Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Nagaland. 

 Referring to the controversy over her origin, Sonia said acceptance was India?s great tradition. ?Our country?s tradition is to unite people and accept others, but the communal forces are trying to break the society.?

 After the rally, Sonia left for a five-hour roadshow in Mumbai titled Jan Sampark Abhiyan, stopping at nearly 20 places along the central line. The crowds were overwhelming, but it was a whistle-stop tour with Sonia barely getting out of her car. Some were unable to contain their dissatisfaction, saying they had waited for hours and Sonia hardly spared them time. 

 The Congress-NCP had saved ?Rahul Gandhi?s and Priyanka Gandhi?s mummy? ? as she is referred to here ? for the last to make the most of her ?sacrificing? image after she said no to the post of Prime Minister.

 Thackeray?s son and nephew, Uddhav and Raj, respectively ? who are touring Maharashtra, with an indisposed Sena chief restricted to Mumbai ? went at their rivals hammer and tongs. So did BSP leader Mayavati. 

 Raj lashed out at railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav at a rally near Nagpur. ?There is a monkey called Laloo Prasad Yadav who does not have any brains. He has not been able to achieve any progress in his own state of Bihar and now he has come here to ask for votes for the development of Maharashtra.? Laloo Prasad has been campaigning in the state for the Congress-NCP alliance. 

 Uddhav held a rally at Yeola in Nashik, where Sena ?arch enemy? Chhagan Bhujbal is in the fray. The huge turnout is said to have sent a chill down the NCP?s spine, though Bhujbal is tipped to win the seat. 

 Mayavati, in Maharashtra since October 1, said the Assembly polls will throw up a ?chamkane wala nateeja? in her party?s favour. 

 Shinde notice

 The Election Commission has issued a notice to chief minister Sushil Kumar Shinde for giving incorrect information about his property in his affidavit. The BJP had accused Shinde of undervaluing his Bandra flat.

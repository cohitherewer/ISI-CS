 Mission Kashmir, replayed

 MUKHTAR AHMAD

 Srinagar, Nov. 17: Mission Kashmir revisited the Valley today as Prime Minister Manmohan Singh arrived on his first tour of the state since taking office.

 Two militants were locked in a three-and-a-half-hour encounter with security forces on Sankaracharya Hill overlooking the stadium where Singh was scheduled to address a public meeting just a couple of hours later.

 When the Prime Minister landed at Srinagar airport at 10 am and headed straight to Hazratbal shrine, the gunbattle was still raging and the city rattled with gunfire.

 Central Reserve Police and Border Security Force personnel had rushed reinforcements as soon as the encounter began. Specially trained commandos later encircled the area and targeted the militants hiding inside a burnt-out cafeteria barely 300 metres from the chinar-lined stadium.

 ?The commandos went up the hillock and after encircling the gutted cafeteria building, they shot dead the two hiding militants,? the Kashmir inspector-general of police said.

 By then, it was 11.30 am. The Prime Minister had left Hazratbal and was addressing a convocation at the Sher-i-Kashmir conference centre.

 In the Sunjay Dutt-Hrithik Roshan starrer, Mission Kashmir was a militant plot to attack Sankaracharya and Hazratbal to trigger communal violence during the Prime Minister?s visit. Needless to say, the plot was foiled and the visit went without hitch.

 Singh?s visit to the Valley today also went off as scheduled, with minor changes. The rally at the stadium, scheduled for 1 pm, was pushed back to 2.30 pm. And the Prime Minister could not go to Hazratbal by boat, as planned, having to fly instead.

 Police said four persons, including two paramilitary soldiers, were injured in the battle and are in hospital.

 But the fidayeen presence a sniper?s distance from the venue of the Prime Minister?s meeting was a jolt to the impregnable security net the authorities said they had thrown around the area. 

 The first batch of soldiers left Kashmir?s southern Anantnag district today as part of Singh?s troops reduction plan. The pullout began at 8 am, around the same time that the encounter started on Sankaracharya.

 At his afternoon rally, the Prime Minister promised: ?If peace prevails and infiltration stops, more troops would be withdrawn from the Valley.?

 Both Hurriyat factions stayed away. Srinagar, crawling with securitymen, was closed in response to a strike called by the hardline group.

 Varun (Top), Rahul

 New Delhi, Oct. 11 (PTI): Varun Gandhi has responded to reports that he is about to join the Congress by saying he will not leave the BJP.

 ?Right now I am in the BJP. I will not leave the BJP, which is going through a crisis period,? Varun said.

 Asked if he would join the Congress if his supporters demand it, he said the people?s mandate would be ?supreme?.

 Rahul Gandhi, asked in Amethi if he was making any effort to establish a rapport with cousin Varun, said: ?As far as personal rapport is concerned, well I had spoken to him once before the (Lok Sabha) elections. We had spoken to each other on phone only once in five-six years. I don?t have a personal rapport.?

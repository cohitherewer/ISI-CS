 Centre sees no scrap shell plot 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 12: Any 

 conspiracy angle to munitions sneaking in with scrap iron 

 and steel imports has been ruled out, but the Centre is 

 worried by the distress dumping of live explosives by importers 

 and furnace owners.

 At the end of two meetings convened by the home ministry, the Centre has decided to advise states to inspect steel factories for live shells and encourage furnace owners to report their presence to police. 

 The ministry has ruled out any conspiracy behind the import of live shells or the possibility that weapons were being smuggled in. It said people were dumping shells for fear of police harassment. 

 The police in several states today reported recovery of shells from public places. In Uttar Pradesh?s Bagpat, 300 empty cartridges were found in Dhunduhera village.

 In Jaipur, the police continued digging dumping grounds of three foundries after five drums of explosives were found on Sunday.

 In Ludhiana, the police recovered over 100 rocket-like objects and rusted AK-47 shells from scrap imported from Yemen. In Thane, 60 rocket-like objects were found on the banks of the Kalu.

 ?You are finding them all over the country because people are dumping them,? junior home minister Sriprakash Jaiswal said. 

 Jaiswal, who attended a meeting chaired by home minister Shivraj Patil, said states were being advised to inspect foundries to avoid recurrence of any Ghaziabad-type explosion that killed 10 people.

 The home ministry has made suggestions, including installation of scanners at big ports, to check unshredded scrap. 

 The minister said the government did not intend to take measures that would affect the import of steel scrap. It would suffice if importers certified there were no explosives in a consignment and action could be taken if anything was found later.

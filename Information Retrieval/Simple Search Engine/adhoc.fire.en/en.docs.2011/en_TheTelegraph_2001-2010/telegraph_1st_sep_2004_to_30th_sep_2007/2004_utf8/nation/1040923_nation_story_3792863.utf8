 Desi and American, conmen prey on BPOs 

 - Fraud alarm rings in call centres

 Bangalore, Sept. 22: Heaven help if you are a budding BPO or call-centre entrepreneur out to grab every which overseas contract that comes your way and have unwittingly fallen into the clutches of John Schofield.

 Suave, sophisticated, American and employed with Tritech Information Strategies of the US, he?d first size you up. Then he?d invite you to his luxury hotel suite, tote his snazzy mobile and flash his sleek thinkpad that he claims is stashed with impressive client lists and business projections.

 Your desperation index measured, he?d turn on his charm. And before you realised it, he?d have sweet-talked you into believing you would land the most lucrative of contracts ahead of your rivals if you trusted him.

 Only, you?d have to pay him a few lakhs upfront so that your name tops his overseas clients? list. Your money and you parted, you wouldn?t be able to track him again. Not to worry, you?d be told, he?d get back after an urgent overseas business trip. Subsequently, if you tried to catch him on his mobile, a taped voice would keep telling you negotiations were still under way.

 Welcome to the world of ITeS frauds.

 With the race having hotted up for a slice of the global $400-billion IT-enabled services pie, more and more unsuspecting entrepreneurs are falling prey to the wiles of these crafty self-styled consultants. The only silver lining is that the games of some are up and they are cooling heels behind bars.

 The biggest catch yet is Schofield, who is now in Tihar jail on charges of cheating several call centres and BPO companies in India. He would charm entrepreneurs into liaising with him by sending elaborate e-mail messages containing the latest business trends and two-year projections and then con them.

 ?He (Schofield) is a sophisticated fraud. All the documents seemed perfect. We were impressed with the way he held discussions with us and was prompt in replies to our queries. We paid him Rs 10 lakh upfront for a 100-seat BPO, but he soon came back asking for more,? said Ritesh Jain, the CEO of a Bangalore-based BPO who has filed a complaint against him.

 ?We heard of such transactions in other places and realised that he was moving from one five-star hotel to another with new mobile numbers.?

 Jain?s lawyers have also moved a local court for a body warrant against him. But the website www.tritechis.com continues to offer call centre and BPO business through Schofield. 

 Just before he was taken into custody in June, Schofield was on the verge of pulling off another deal ? this time with Ravi Chandar, CEO of Inter-Tech Communications, a software company based in Bangalore. ?We were looking at diversification at that point and were talking to some people. I believe there are 25 self-proclaimed consultants in Bangalore who offer to provide leads and contacts to companies such as ours,? Chandar said.

 ?The letters of credit from banks abroad are forged documents. Those who are eager to acquire business but have little knowledge of how the fraud network operates fall for the bait and make upfront payments.?

 Another conman ? this one homegrown, not American ? has been picked up in Nagpur. Although Girish Mehra, director of E-Soft Technologies, is in hot water on fraud charges, his company continues to offer openings to clients in Mauritius and Bangladesh.

 ?When I met him I found he knew nothing about the industry. Then I discovered that the address of his end-client, Ms Dextrous Global Solutions, was of a Chinese restaurant in London and the phone numbers were of one wing of UK?s Parliament,? said Arvind Kumar, CEO of GreenSQUARE, a BPO based in Dehra Dun.

 Kumar said he had fallen into a similar trap another time with two Surat-based frauds, who had posed as representatives of a non-existent Canadian company ? Simprose e-network ? that had a Toronto address. They had even handed him a payment security note of the Royal Bank of Canada, which was fake, he said.

 The conmen were on a roll because BPO entrepreneurs were lured by huge profit margins offered by overseas firms, he explained. Profit margins often touched 40-50 per cent in data conversion (from jpeg or pdf format into Word) and form-filling ventures (of employee details).

 ?Half of these offers are fraud, but another half are serious business because a number of foreign firms are outsourcing these operations to India because of low labour costs,? Kumar said.

 Of late, warnings have been put up on websites providing information on BPO and call centres about the operations of these fly-by-night frauds. One instance is of Sunny Wadhwa of Clear Communications in New Jersey, who vanished with funds whacked from Indian BPOs and telecom firms from the US. The American firms have registered complaints against him.

 Another fraud whose name is up on the telecom frauds? website is Subramaniam Iyer of Western Infotech Multimedia in Mumbai.

 Not that the daredevils stick to greenhorns only, they chance their arm with well-known firms too, including TransWorks, a BPO owned by the Aditya Birla Group, Phoenix Global Solutions (acquired by TCS recently) and Mphasis BFL.

 ?If people are naive, there are enough number of people waiting to make a fast buck. We get mail all the time from people who claim they are representatives of companies abroad and offer us business propositions, but we delete such mails,? said Prakash Gurbaxani, CEO of TransWorks, Bangalore. ?Companies that do not care for due diligence get sucked into this scam.?

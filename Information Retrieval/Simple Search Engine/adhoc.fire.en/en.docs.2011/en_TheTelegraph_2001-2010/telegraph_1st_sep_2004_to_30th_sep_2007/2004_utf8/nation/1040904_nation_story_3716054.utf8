 Uma case withdrawal challenged

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hubli, Sept. 3: Uma Bharti appears to be caught in a legal maze after a Hubli resident today challenged the state governments move to withdraw cases against the former Madhya Pradesh chief minister.

 Chittaranjan Kallannavar, 33, told the court of the judicial magistrate first class (JMFC) that he is of the view that it is only arbitrary use of power by the state government in abusing the processes of this honourable court.

 If such moves are allowed, a day is not too far when recourse is taken at even the fall of a hat, he added.

 He urged the judicial magistrate, Mohammed Ismail, to reject the governments plea filed in July 2002 in the interest of justice. The government had sought to withdraw the cases against Uma over a controversial flag-hoisting ceremony that left several dead in 1994.

 Kallannavars challenge came a couple of hours after the district sessions court here ordered the public prosecutor to submit his report and opinion in writing to the magistrate at 11 am tomorrow. 

 Rejecting the prosecutors plea for a weeks time to hand in the report, sessions judge John Michael DCunha said: This court does not have the jurisdiction to interfere with the high court and the JMFC orders. You should comply with the directive.

 On August 30, Karnataka High Court had directed the magistrate to reconsider the governments application for dropping all charges and withdrawing cases against the BJP leader in line with a cabinet decision of January 2002.

 Two days later, the magistrate refused a weeks time to the public prosecutor to file a report to this effect. His order was challenged in the sessions court last evening.

 Kallannavars challenge further said the prosecution failed to secure the custody of the accused so far because of sheer lethargy and negligent attitude. 

 The above case was adjourned 48 times for the appearance of accused persons between September 1, 1994, and August 23, 2003. The state has failed in its duty towards the court.

 Later, he said: I am a farmer but I devote some time for matters that have an impact on the lives of people in Hubli. I have taken up this cause because it should not set a precedent.

 Senior BJP leaders such as Rajnath Singh and Kalraj Mishra today joined the satyagraha launched by the party to seek withdrawal of the cases against Uma.

 They were among 1,000 people who courted arrest here on the third day of the agitation.

 Cong salvo

 The Congress today said it would move the Election Commission against Umas failure to mention the Hubli court case while filing nominations for the Assembly polls last year, reports PTI.

 We have now got copies of the nomination papers of Bharti. There is no mention of the cases related to the Hubli violence. We will initiate steps with the Election Commission, party spokesman Abhishek Singhvi said in Delhi.

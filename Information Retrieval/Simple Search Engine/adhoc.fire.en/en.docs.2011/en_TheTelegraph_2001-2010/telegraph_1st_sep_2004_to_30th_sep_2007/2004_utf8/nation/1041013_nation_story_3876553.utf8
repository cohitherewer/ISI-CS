 Sena gambles with son-of-soil card

 K. SUBRAHMANYA

 Mumbai, Oct. 12: Bal Thackeray has again gambled with his Marathi card in the country?s financial capital. 

 ?Mumbai cannot be separated from Maharashtra. Make Mumbai a Shanghai but not at the cost of Maharashtrians,? the Sena chief asserted at his Sunday rally here which was also addressed by former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.

 ?Mumbai is ours,? Thackeray asserted. For the Sena here, ?B? can only stand for ?Balasaheb? and not ?Bangladesh?, party mouthpiece Saamna emphasised in its edition yesterday, the last day for campaigning for Wednesday?s Assembly polls.

 The emotive appeal to Marathi sentiment to rally behind the Sena-BJP combine in Mumbai is widely viewed here and elsewhere in the state as a huge gamble by Thackeray to stage an electoral recovery in the city. Mumbai had emphatically rejected the Sena-BJP in the May general elections, defeating its candidates in five of the six Lok Sabha seats here.

 The rejection in a city that has for long been a Sena bastion was widely seen as the result of northern Indians? anger against Sainiks? intimidatory behaviour towards them. People of northern Indian descent, particularly from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, constitute a large proportion of the metro?s population.

 After the Lok Sabha poll debacle in the city, the Sena leadership tried to make amends by acknowledging the mistakes while seeking to reassure the migrant population. For the Sena patriarch, the stakes in tomorrow?s battle for Maharashtra, however, are very high.

 Significantly, as the campaign picked up momentum in the past few days, Mumbai became the focus of targeted campaigning both by the Sena-BJP and the ruling Congress-NCP alliance.

 Privately, top poll strategists in the rival camps believe the outcome in the 36 seats in the city could hold the key to winning majority or reaching close to the majority mark in the 288-member Assembly.

 Margaret Alva, the AICC general secretary in charge of Maharashtra, has set for the city Congress leaders a target of 25 seats from the metro. Till recently, the party was confident about realising the target but the leadership has noted the Opposition bid to stage a recovery. 

 Thackeray is widely seen as trying to consolidate Marathi voters in the city ? estimated at close to 38 per cent of its 13 million population ? behind the Sena with his ?Mumbai is ours? assertion.

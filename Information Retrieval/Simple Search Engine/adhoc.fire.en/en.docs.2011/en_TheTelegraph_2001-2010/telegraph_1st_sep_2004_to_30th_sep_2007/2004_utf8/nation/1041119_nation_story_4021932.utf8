 Crush blame on train rejig

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 18: Investigation into the stampede at New Delhi station is veering round to the conclusion that last-minute re-scheduling of trains on different platforms coupled with the huge rush due to the unlimited number of tickets issued caused the tragedy. 

 The report of the high-level inquiry instituted by the railway ministry into the stampede that killed five persons on Saturday is expected tomorrow. 

 According to officials conducting the investigation, the shuffle of platforms allotted to several trains caused waiting passengers to run helter-skelter to board their trains. 

 ?What added to the confusion was that unlimited tickets had been given out. As a result, there was a huge crowd converging on the platforms far beyond its capacity. There was so much crowd on the overbridge and the staircase was slippery,? said an official. 

 The Ferozepur-Janata Express, which usually leaves from platform 4 at 1.20 pm, was diverted to platform 2 though it was already bursting at the seams with passengers waiting for the Bihar-bound Jan Sadharan Express waiting on its other side, on platform 3. 

 Though the Jan Sadharan Express was supposed to leave at 3 pm, the train had been at the platform since 11.30 am. Already, the platform was crowded with persons trying to return to Bihar for the Chhat puja. 

 The crush was increased manifold by shifting the Ferozepur-Janata Express, ostensibly as the Jalandhar-Amritsar expected originally at platform 2 was late. 

 Adding to the jostle in one of the busiest stations was the diversion of the Ganganagar-Bhatinda Superfast, due at platform 2 at 1.20 pm, to platform 4. 

 The officials believe these last-minute changes coupled with the failure to restrict and control the crowds on the platforms who had landed up after unlimited tickets were handed out without taking into account the risks are what contributed to the stampede.

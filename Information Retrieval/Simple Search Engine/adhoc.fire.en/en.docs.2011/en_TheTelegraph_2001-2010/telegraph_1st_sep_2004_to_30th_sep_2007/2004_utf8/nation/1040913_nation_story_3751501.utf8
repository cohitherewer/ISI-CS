 Indian fleet in Gulf

 New Delhi, Sept. 12 (PTI): India has positioned a flotilla of guided-missile destroyers, a stealth corvette and submarines in the Gulf.

 The overseas deployment for three weeks is part of an exercise that the Navy undertakes from time to time, a naval spokesperson said.

 The taskforce of six warships is commanded by the flag officer commanding Western Fleet, Rear Admiral P.S. Pye and includes two indigenous daily class 6,700-tonne displacement guided-missile destroyers and the Russian-built stealth frigate INS Talwar.

 The taskforce also includes the indigenously built fleet tanker INS Aditya and indigenous missiles.

 The spokesperson said the taskforce would be divided into two groups, with the one visiting Muscat, the capital of Oman, from September 13 to 17 and the second visiting the strategic Iranian port of Bandar Abbas on the Makram coast from September 14 to 18.

 This is an attempt to showcase Indian warships, missiles, torpedoes, sonars, radars and helicopters, he said.

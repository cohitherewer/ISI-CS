 Left unions line up ?massive? protests

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 10: A day before the Left-United Progressive Alliance coordination committee meets, all Left-backed unions have called for a nationwide ?massive? agitation on November 24.

 They are protesting against the UPA government?s ?anti-people? policies, particularly the increase in petrol and LPG prices.

 The unions? call to stage ?massive protest actions? such as rallies, demonstrations at state capitals and industrial centres across India came even as Prime Minister Manmohan Singh refused to join issue with the Left today on their criticism of last week?s petrol price hike.

 The call, coming on the eve of the coordination committee meeting that Sonia Gandhi will chair, is seen as an attempt to pressure the government.

 The trade union leaders will meet again on November 16 to plan their future strategy.

 Dismissing suggestions that the unions are ?shadow boxing?, AITUC general secretary and CPI MP Gurudas Dasgupta said: ?It is a real movement. The taste of pudding lies in its eating.?

 Speaking after a meeting of Left union leaders, he said the outfits would oppose tooth and nail any action that hurts the working class.

 Left leaders will meet separately before the coordination committee meeting. They are demanding a rollback of petroleum prices and an increase in the provident fund interest rate from 8.5 per cent to 9 per cent.

 Sources said tomorrow?s coordination committee meeting will, among other things, discuss the increase in foreign direct investment in telecom, finance minister P. Chidambaram?s note, the Left rejoinder and the patent amendment bill. The communists want the bill to be introduced only after a detailed discussion.

 Slamming the petrol price increase, the unions said the hike is ?bound to trigger a further inflationary spiral as has already been witnessed in the shooting up of the prices of vegetables and other essential articles?.

 They said their meeting ?unequivocally condemns the price hike and demands immediate rollback thereof?.

 The unions said the UPA government was refusing to heed their suggestions for enhancing the tax-GDP ratio by broadening the tax base and raising resources through levies on the affluent.

 They said the government could roll back the prices by reworking the duty structure on oil products, securing a bulk purchase discount of around 10 per cent that crude oil exporters allow other countries and deflate the profit margins of public and private sector refineries.

 Asked to comment on the Left reaction to the price hike, the Prime Minister said: ?I have already explained (the rationale behind the decision). I have nothing more to add. I will explain my position to my colleagues, too.?

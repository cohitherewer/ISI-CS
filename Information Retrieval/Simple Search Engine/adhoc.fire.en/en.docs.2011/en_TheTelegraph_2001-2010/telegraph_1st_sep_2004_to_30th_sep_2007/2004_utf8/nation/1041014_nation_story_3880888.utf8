The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Left to pipe down on FDI 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 13: The Union finance ministry?s rejoinder to the Left?s objections to FDI in telecommunication seems to have put the communists on the backfoot.

 It is unlikely that the government will get the Left parties to change their mind. But they may not push the row to another high-pitched confrontation and instead leave it with an official note of protest once they realise the government is determined to go ahead with the move.

 ?The four Left parties will meet and take a decision on the issue,? said CPI leader D. Raja. The parties, however, are not in a hurry and have given their go ahead to the government to increase the FDI cap from 40 to 49 per cent in domestic airlines.

 The Left is likely to focus on the Electricity Act, 2003, which seeks to privatise the generation and distribution of electricity. At yesterday?s UPA-Left co-ordination committee meeting, the CPI submitted a note to the government seeking a review of the act. 

 The note quotes the common minimum programme that says: ?In view of the concerns expressed by states, the act will be reviewed.?

 The CPI, in its note, has suggested clause by clause changes in the act. ?The control of the electricity supply cannot be left to market forces in a developing country like ours since it is a public utility service.?

 For the time being, the government is not touching the insurance sector as it needs Parliament?s approval to amend the insurance bill and increase the FDI level. The BJP and the Left have said they will oppose it, which means the government will not be able to push through an amendment.

 In telecom, the government does not need Parliament?s approval to make changes. It only needs a cabinet sanction.

 Eye on metro 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 15: The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation will use closed-circuit television cameras to keep an eye on possible criminals and terrorists when its underground line between Delhi University and the Central Secretariat opens next month.

 It is not just the closed circuit television that the Metro Rail Corporation intends to press into service to keep stations and commuters from becoming targets of criminals.

 There are no toilets and seating areas at the paid sections at the Delhi Metro for the same reason.

 The closed circuit cameras will be installed at the Delhi University, Delhi Vidhan Sabha, Civil Lines and Kashmere Gate stations.

 Each of these stations will have about 20 to 25 cameras so that authorities can nip any trouble in the bud.

 The cameras will be connected to the station?s control panel as well as a central control panel. They will help police keep a watch on commuters as well as others using the stations.

 The cameras will act as a warning system in case of emergency.

 Delhi Metro Rail Corporation officials say the elevated sections of the Shahdara-Rithala station that do not have closed-circuit cameras will be provided the system soon.

 The metro stations as well as the trains themselves have been so designed that it is difficult to loiter about or leave suspicious objects behind without being spotted.

 Very little baggage space has been provided.

 The use of pre-paid metro token cards at the underground stations makes it difficult for beggars and hawkers to wander about without checks.

 Escalators are in operation at the stations instead of stairs to make it difficult for beggars to hang around.

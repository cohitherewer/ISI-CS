 Milkman in hot water

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 31: The neighbourhood milkman can no longer milk his customer by supplying diluted milk.

 The Supreme Court has sentenced a milk supplier of Haryana to six months rigorous imprisonment and fined him Rs 1,000 after finding the milk he supplied had fallen short of standards.

 Daya Nand was carrying 20 litres of cow milk on July 6, 1988, when he was intercepted by the deputy chief medical officer, Narnaul. A sample of 750 ml sent to the public analyst was found short of milk solid by 5 per cent of the prescribed minimum standard.

 The trial court found Daya Nand guilty under the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act and prescribed the minimum sentence of six months rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs 1,000 as the accused had no previous criminal record.

 The milkman was directed to further undergo simple imprisonment for three months if he failed to pay the fine.

 On an appeal, Punjab and Haryana High Court set aside the sentence on the finding that non-solid fat was found to be 8.1 per cent instead of 8.5 per cent and solid fat 4.5 per cent against the required 4 per cent. He was given the benefit of doubt as there was a possibility of improper stirring.

 The Haryana government approached the Supreme Court, contending that the high court had erred in appreciating the facts on record.

 A bench of Justices . Santosh Hegde, S.B. Sinha and A.K. Mathur on August 25 said the high court could not have substituted a factual foundation available on record by an assumption to give benefit of doubt to the respondent.

 The high court, the bench said, rather casually has come to an erroneous assumption that there was improper stirring for which there is no foundation at all, as could be seen from the finding. Churning of curd was different from stirring of milk and there was no legally prescribed method for either, the bench said and directed that Daya Nand serve out the sentence awarded by the trial court.

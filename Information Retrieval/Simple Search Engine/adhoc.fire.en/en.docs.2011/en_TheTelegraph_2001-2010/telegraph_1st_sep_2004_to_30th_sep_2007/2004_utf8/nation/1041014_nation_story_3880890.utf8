 Maharashtra

 An estimated 55-60 per cent of the 6.59 crore electorate voted in the Assembly polls that were peaceful barring a stray Naxalite-police skirmish in Vidarbha. Two injured jawans were airlifted to Nagpur. Almost 200 people, including Congress-NCP workers, in Mumbai were rushed to hospital with food poisoning after eating ?pedas?, police said.

 Andhra Pradesh

 Bypolls to the Assembly seats of Asifnagar saw a low 37 per cent turnout and Siddipet 60 per cent, from where T. Harish Rao, the nephew of the Telengana Rashtra Samiti chief made his debut. 

 Kashmir

 Amid heavy security, dull voting in Pahalgam, where chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed is contesting a poll after 17 years, picked up despite a double-grenade attack near a booth before polling began and boycott call by separatists. After polls closed, a landmine blast wounded 12 people. 

 Uttar Pradesh

 Two deaths in a group clash and allegations of booth capturing, intimidation and damaging of voting machines marked polls in Mainpuri Lok Sabha seat, vacated by chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav. Another person was killed in Aligarh. The turnout was over 55 per cent.

 Northeast

 Amid heavy security, voters in Manipur defied a statewide general strike by an association opposed to the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act to register 53 per cent polling by 1 pm in the Konthoujam Assembly seat. Assembly bypolls to three seats in Nagaland and one in Assam were also peaceful.

 Karnataka

 The parliamentary by-election to Bidar, the first poll since the Congress-Janata Dal (S) took charge, saw the allies fight each other and the BJP in a contest that drew an unimpressive 40 per cent turnout. A downpour and Mahalaya Amavasya kept most voters away.

 Bihar

 Around 50-52 per cent people voted in the Madhepura bypoll that was largely peaceful. Seven persons were arrested for trying to obstruct polling in the heavily-guarded constituency, vacated by Laloo Prasad Yadav.

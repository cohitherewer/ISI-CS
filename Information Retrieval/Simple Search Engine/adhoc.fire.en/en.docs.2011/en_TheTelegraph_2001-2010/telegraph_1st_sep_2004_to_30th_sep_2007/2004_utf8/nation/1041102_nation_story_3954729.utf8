 New Delhi, Nov. 1: Major players are exploring all options to win the Bihar elections with barely three months left for the polls.

 The ruling Rashtriya Janata Dal is considering an electoral understanding with the Mayavati-led Bahujan Samaj Party to pre-empt Union chemicals and fertilisers minister Ram Vilas Paswan from making inroads into the non-Paswan Dalit vote bank.

 To dent the Dalit base of Paswan?s Lok Janshakti Party, railway minister and RJD chief Laloo Prasad Yadav recently inducted former Union minister Sanjay Paswan into his party. Sanjay Paswan, who quit the BJP, was made an RJD spokesperson last week.

 Advocates of an RJD-BSP alliance on both sides say a tie-up would help both parties. Mayavati, a Chamar, could campaign against Paswan and limit his influence to Paswan-Dushad dominated areas, to Laloo Prasad?s advantage.

 The BSP has considerable influence among Chamars in the districts of central-south Bihar bordering Uttar Pradesh such as Siwan, Sasaram, Gopalganj and Buxar. In many places, the Chamars? allegiance is divided between the CPI-ML, the RJD and the Congress.

 During the last Assembly elections, the BSP had an understanding with the RJD and bagged five seats. But relations between Laloo Prasad and Mayavati soured when the MLAs joined the RJD. One MLA, Mahabali Singh, was made a minister in the Rabri Devi government.

 Sources said Laloo Prasad is yet to talk to Mayavati. He is still weighing the pros and cons as there is a feeling that giving the BSP a toehold in Bihar could hurt the RJD in the long run.

 Alliance partner Congress, also a beneficiary of Dalit votes, is not keen on taking the BSP on board unless it agrees to a quid pro quo in Uttar Pradesh to take on Mulayam Singh Yadav.

 It is thought Laloo Prasad may not be averse to a limited understanding with the BSP but might not opt for a formal alliance as Mayavati might demand a number of seats.

 Paswan campaigned against Mayavati during the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, indirectly benefiting the Mulayam Singh Yadav-led Samajwadi Party; the BSP chief hopes to even the score by campaigning against the LJP in Bihar.

 Asked if the RJD would ally with the BSP, party spokesperson Moti-ur-Rehman said nothing had been decided. ?As of now, we have an alliance with the Congress, the CPM and the CPI.? He added that the RJD did not need anyone?s help to win in Bihar.

 ?As against Paswan?s four per cent, Laloo Prasad Yadav has 60 per cent support base in the state and it is increasing after he became railway minister. His image has gone up among the people as he has done a lot of development work for the state,? the spokesperson said.

 Civilians shot in soldier scuffle

 MUKHTAR AHMAD

 Srinagar Nov. 29: Two civilians were shot dead after a scuffle broke out during a cordon-and-search operation by soldiers in central Kashmir?s Budgam district early this morning.

 Police sources here said 35 Rashtriya Rifles troops began an operation in Dangerpora village near Chadoora, 30 km from here, today. The troops asked the villagers to gather in a field and then began house-to-house searches.

 When the villagers demanded that they be allowed to go home since it was biting cold the soldiers refused, leading to a brawl. The troops roughed up two persons with police saying some villagers hurled kangris (traditional fire pots) at the soldiers.

 Sources said the troops then fired from their automatic rifles injuring three people, two of whom later died of their bullet injuries in hospital.

 Budgam district magistrate Khawaja Bashir Ahmed visited Dangerpora late this afternoon. A senior army officer who also visited the spot assured the villagers that a ?court of inquiry has been ordered into the unfortunate incident?.

 Hundreds of villagers later held a huge demonstration to protest the killings.

 The incident comes close on the heels of Saturday?s encounter at Foreshore Road here near Nishat in which Jammu and Kashmir police claimed to have gunned down four hardcore Lashkar-e-Toiba militants.

 One of the militants, Tajamul Haq, belonged to the north Kashmir town of Handwara, where protests over the last three days have crippled normal life, forcing education institutions to close. Locals insist Haq was innocent and not connected with the militants.

 Haq?s burial was put off for three days as the villagers demanded an apology from chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed who described the Nishat encounter as a ?great success for local police?.

 Elsewhere, 15 people, including two securitymen, were injured in two hand-grenade explosions here today.

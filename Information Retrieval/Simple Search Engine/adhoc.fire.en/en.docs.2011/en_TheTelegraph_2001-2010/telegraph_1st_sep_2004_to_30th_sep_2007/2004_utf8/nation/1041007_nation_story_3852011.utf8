The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 More muscle for Assam forces

 ALOKE TIKKU

 New Delhi, Oct. 6: Back in Delhi after a two-day tour of the violence-hit Northeast, Union home minister Shivraj Patil today said Assam would get more central forces over the next few days and access to Indian Air Force helicopters to track down militants.

 The Centre will despatch 20 companies of central forces ? a mix of the BSF and the CRPF ? to Assam over the next few days. Another 15 companies will be deployed in the state, where militants have killed 42 people since Saturday, after the elections in Arunachal Pradesh and five companies when the electoral process in Maharashtra is completed. 

 Nagaland has not sought additional forces though two blasts rocked the state?s commercial hub, Dimapur, during the weekend.

 The objective behind accepting Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi?s demand for 40 additional companies ? approximately 5,000 security personnel ? is to increase the visibility of the security forces in the affected areas.

 Security forces deployed in Assam will also have access to two IAF choppers that can be requisitioned at short notice.

 Special secretary in the Union home ministry Anil Choudhury, who accompanied Patil to the Northeast, said the Ulfa and the National Democratic Front of Boroland (NDFB) were behind the incidents in Assam but the identity of the group involved in the Dimapur blasts was not known.

 However, he virtually ruled out the possibility of any Naga militant group triggering the twin explosions because they do not have a history of hitting soft targets. 

 Delhi made it clear that the key to the success of counter-insurgency operations in Assam and elsewhere was an effective intelligence-gathering mechanism. A meeting of the chief secretary-led strategy group of the Unified Command for counter-insurgency operations is slated for Friday. It will be followed by similar co-ordination meetings of operational groups.

 The next week will see police chiefs of the northeastern states putting their heads together to work out a joint strategy to deal with militancy.

 BJP team visit

 Critical of the Congress-led Centre?s approach to terrorism, the BJP today decided to send a three-member team to Assam and Nagaland to study the situation in the wake of the killer blasts there.

 The BJP alleged that the United Progressive Alliance government?s ?soft? policies towards militants had ?emboldened? them to step up attacks in the Northeast. Party spokesperson Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said the team comprising himself, B.C. Khanduri and S.S. Ahluwalia would visit the two states on Saturday.

 Lucknow, Dec. 20: Former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Uma Bharti today cleaned the stairs of the Hanuman Garhi temple in Ayodhya as well as devotees? shoes as penance for not taking part in the VHP?s 2001 shila daan programme for the construction of the Ram temple. 

 ?My conscience had been troubling me since I failed to take part in the shila daan programme of the VHP (Vishwa Hindu Parishad) in March 2001 when I was a minister in the Union government and this act is in repentance for it,? she said in Ayodhya today.

 The suspended BJP leader said she had offered to quit as minister to attend the shila daan three years ago. ?But at that time I was advised against it by the VHP chief, Ashok Singhal, and the late Ramchandra Paramhans,? she added.

 The sadhvi said she had apologised to the Ayodhya?s sants and mahants as well as its ordinary residents for her 2001 no-show. ?I still maintain that Ram and roti are the two planks of politics that will rule India?s future and a temple should be built there as soon as possible,? Uma said.

 Earlier, Uma took a dip in the Saryu and prayed at the makeshift Ram temple and the Nageshwar Nath Shiva temple. She meditated for an hour there.

 The leader arrived in Ayodhya on Saturday afternoon and received the baaratis for Ram?s ?wedding anniversary?. She also met a number of VHP sants yesterday.

 At 10.30 am, Uma arrived at the steep staircase leading up to the Hanuman temple. As the sants chanted slogans amid beating of drums and blowing of conch shells, she took a long broom and began to clean the temple stairs.

 Accompanying her up the steps with a bucket of water to splash on the steps as she cleaned them was former Uttar Pradesh BJP unit chief Vinay Katiyar, like her a backward class leader. He was the only BJP leader by her side. An hour later, she sat in front of the gates where devotees have to leave their footwear and began cleaning them with a towel.

 BJP insiders said Uma?s ?repentance? suggests that she is keen to make common cause with the VHP?s temple programme at a time when she is being attacked by her colleagues in the party.

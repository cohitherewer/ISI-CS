 Centre plans stamp shield

 New Delhi, Nov. 1: The Centre today informed the Supreme Court that a scheme was being worked out to prevent recurrence of stamp paper scams like the one masterminded by Abdul Karim Telgi, reports our legal correspondent.

 The scheme, which would complement amendments to the Stamp Act, would include dematting of stamp papers, additional solicitor-general Amarendra Saran said in a written submission in the court as the hearing of a public interest litigation filed by former counsel for the Uttar Pradesh government Ajay Agrawal resumed today.

 The court had, on the basis of the PIL, earlier ordered that the probe into the multi-crore scam be taken over by the CBI.

 Saran said a meeting of finance officials presided over by finance secretary D.C. Gupta recently ?decided that in view of the amendments carried out in the Stamp Act, the states would be asked to send to the Centre a time-bound programme to introduce fool-proof modern method of revenue collection?, including computerisation of all records.

 Hashmi case bail

 Allahabad, Sept. 18 (PTI): Allahabad High Court today granted bail to four accused in the fatal attack on theatre activist Safdar Hashmi as he performed a street play 15 years ago.

 Mukesh Sharma, Devi Saran Sharma, Tahir Hussein and Yunus Ali were among 10 people sentenced to life imprisonment in November last year by a sessions court in Ghaziabad. They were found guilty of murdering Hashmi on January 1, 1989 as he staged a street play, Halla Bo, in Sahibabad?s Jhandapur village.

 The play was aimed at attracting votes for Ramanand Jha, Congress candidate Mukesh Sharma?s rival for the mayor?s post. 

 However, the accused appealed to the high court against their conviction. During pendency of the appeal, six of them were granted bail while the others were granted bail by Justice R.C. Deepak today.

 Two accused died while the trial was on.

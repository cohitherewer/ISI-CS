 Uniform science terms 

 New Delhi, Sept. 6 (PTI): The Supreme Court today directed all governmental bodies, including the National Council for Educational Research and Training (NCERT), to ensure uniformity in scientific terminology used in textbooks, as recommended by a standing committee.

 A bench comprising Justices Ruma Pal and Arun Kumar, while disposing of a public interest litigation filed by Matribhasha Vikas Parishad, directed all governmental education bodies to follow the terminology suggested by the standing committee on scientific and technical terminology.

 The bench noted that the petitioner had brought on record several instances, which showed different Hindi translations of the same scientific expression used in textbooks.

 The court said the object behind setting up of the standing committee was to avoid confusion among students by adopting a uniform scientific terminology. It was mandatory on the part of the governmental education bodies to follow the recommendations of the committee, the court added.

 The petitioner, among other things, had sought framing of rules and regulations in relation to the preparation of books and their evaluation as to the use of scientific terminology.

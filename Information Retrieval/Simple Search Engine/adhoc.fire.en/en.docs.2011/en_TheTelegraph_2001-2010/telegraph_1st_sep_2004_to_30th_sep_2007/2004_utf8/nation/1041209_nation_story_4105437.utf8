 Car in Jaipur, fined in Delhi

 AYSWARIA VENUGOPAL

 New Delhi, Dec. 8: Beware of traffic violations ? whether you commit them or not.

 Delhi police have served 52 computerised challans on a Delhi University professor for a car that he does not drive and which does not even ply in Delhi.

 Ramesh Kumar of the Germanic and Romanic studies department even received 21 challans for the time that he did not own the car.

 Thirty-one more followed after Kumar?s Jaipur-based nephew ? Bijender Kumar Singh, DIG, Home Guards, Jaipur ? bought the second-hand Maruti Esteem (DL 1CH 6318) in April 2003 and registered it in Kumar?s name.

 The car, according to the professor, has barely been to Delhi twice since it was bought second-hand.

 Over the last few months, non-bailable warrants for the ?traffic violations? have left Kumar bewildered and with no option but to report to court for offences committed in Delhi by a car that is plying in Jaipur.

 The supposed offences have cost Kumar close to Rs 2,000 in fines paid in Delhi courts and could go up to Rs 12,000.

 ?This has become a mental trauma to me. I don?t even receive notices. I get the non-bailable warrants straightaway. Then I have to go to court and sort it out. It has become a big nuisance,? Kumar said.

 Computer trouble is apparently not to blame. Kumar suspects the flood of challans is a case of harassment by a disgruntled police official. 

 ?My nephew warned me that he recently sacked someone who has a brother in Delhi police. It could be him at the bottom of this trouble.?

 Qamar Ahmed, joint commissioner in charge of traffic police in Delhi, rejected the charge. 

 ?If the challans were being issued in one area, then I would have understood. On what basis is he saying that the car is not running in Delhi. If he feels there is someone in the department, let him come with the name and I will look into it,? the officer said.

 The professor did complain to the police but the traffic department has not bothered even to figure out that the car?s insurance has been paid at Alwar in Rajasthan for the last two years.

 ?There are many times when we receive a complaint that the car wasn?t where the challan was issued,? Ahmed said.

 ?The other day, there was a case where two challans were issued for a car in two different places. It turned out to be a problem with the watch that the two officials in two places were wearing. We get cases where the car number does not match with the make recorded or its colour. In such cases, the files are closed.?

 Over the last two years, computerised challans sent by post have become a norm for Delhi police?s traffic department that was frequently pulled up for lack of enforcement. 

 For a short while, a stay order by the courts, following a case, froze the issue of postal challans.

 A journalist said: ?I received a challan which placed my car in G.B. Road, the red-light area. I have never been there. It is not even a place where you can drive, but the challan issued by the traffic police put my car on the spot. They are just arbitrarily sending these challans.?

 ?Earlier, too, they sent a challan that put me at Max Mueller Bhawan (on Kasturba Gandhi Marg),? the journalist added. ?I have never been there. I had to pay Rs 1,000 for something I did not do.?

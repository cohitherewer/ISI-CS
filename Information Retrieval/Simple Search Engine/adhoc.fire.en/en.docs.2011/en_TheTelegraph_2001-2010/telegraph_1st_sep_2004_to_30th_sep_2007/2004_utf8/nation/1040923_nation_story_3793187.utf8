The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Seat push to sanyas call

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Bhopal, Sept. 22: Uma Bharti?s announcement today of ?sanyas? shows her growing disillusionment with the BJP leadership and her impulsive nature.

 The last straw for Uma came yesterday evening when her loyalist Prahlad Patel was denied party nomination to contest Assembly bypolls from Nahota in Madhya Pradesh.

 Patel today filed papers as an ?Independent? in the hope that Uma?s pressure may prompt the party to withdraw its nominee, Dashrat Singh Lodhi. But till late evening, the party showed no signs of relenting. Reports from Nahota said the local unit was resisting Patel?s presence.

 Influenced by former BJP ideologue K. Govindacharya, Uma now intends to ?break free? and launch a nationwide ?Bharat Gaurav Yatra? to restore a sense of nationalism and patriotism among the people.

 Uma believes there is a craving need for change as politicians and parties are failing the people; on assuming power, all parties follow the same agenda.

 An Uma associate narrated an incident from when she was a minister in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government.

 Uma, the associate said, had objected to the presence of a multinational company in a project and threatened to cancel the contract; within days, her portfolio was changed.

 Making the ?sanyas? announcement and reflecting on her future role, Uma said in Mathura: ?Politics is increasingly becoming petty.... I have realised that posts are not as important as campaigns for public awakening.?

 But later in Faridabad, she said she wanted two years off from politics to pursue such campaigns.

 Her quit call surprisingly went almost unnoticed in her home state where, until some time ago, she was all-powerful as the chief minister. Loyalist state ministers switched off mobile phones while BJP functionaries passed the buck to the central leadership.

 Words of sympathy came from an unexpected quarter. Arch-rival Digvijay Singh of the Congress told The Telegraph: ?I feel sorry for her. Since the age of five, the VHP-BJP-RSS-Bajrang Dal and her own family members have exploited her.? 

 The former chief minister said: ?It is a shame she was not even given a single seat (for one of her nominees). Why did the BJP deny her such a small courtesy??

 Digvijay was quick to add that having known Uma from when she was barely five, he would need time to believe she was taking political sanyas. ?She is fickle minded. She may change her mind. I would believe (the announcement) if she resigns from the BJP, too.?

 Madhya Pradesh chief minister Babulal Gaur, too, sounded dismissive. He said he and the party had successfully persuaded Uma a ?hundred times? before. ?We will again request her to stay on,? Gaur said.

 Uma has been agitated for the last few days over denial of party ticket to Patel, who was set to emerge as an alternative power centre to Gaur.

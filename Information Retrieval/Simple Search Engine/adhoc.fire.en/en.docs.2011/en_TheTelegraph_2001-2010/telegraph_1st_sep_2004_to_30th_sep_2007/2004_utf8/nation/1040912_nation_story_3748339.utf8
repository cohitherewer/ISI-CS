 Attack on CRPF camp

 Srinagar, Sept. 11 (PTI): Two militants belonging to the Al-Mansurian tonight stormed a hotel housing the 94 battalion of the CRPF on the banks of the Dal lake, injuring an officer and two soldiers.

 This is the third suicide attack on the CRPF in less than two months. A three-member squad is believed to have mounted the attack.

 Hurling grenades and firing indiscriminately, the militants stormed Hotel York around 9.30 pm and engaged the troops in a fierce encounter which is continuing, official sources said.

 Militants attacked the CRPF?s battalion headquarters in the Dal gate area on July 27. Six CRPF personnel and two militants were killed in the encounter. Nine personnel and a militant were killed in another attack on a CRPF camp on August 4.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Governor transfer outcry 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, Oct. 24: Twelve ADMK members of the Rajya Sabha and nearly 140 members of the Assembly today flooded the offices of the President and the Chief Justice of India with telegrams urging them to take steps to immediately stop the Centre?s proposed move to transfer the Tamil Nadu governor, P.S. Ramamohan Rao.

 In a sensational development just a day after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh?s first visit to the state after having assumed office that was marked by utter sobriety, the ADMK MPs and MLAs individually sent telegrams to President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, urging him not to approve the appointment of a new governor for Tamil Nadu.

 In their messages to the President, the MPs and MLAs alleged that the Centre was pressurising him to transfer the governor ?merely to satisfy the unreasonable demand of Karunanidhi, to create an artificial instability in the administration of Tamil Nadu?.

 Jayalalithaa had gone to the airport here yesterday to receive the Prime Minister, as did the governor. But expectations about her meeting with Singh at Raj Bhavan in the evening were belied, while the DMK president, M. Karunanidhi, has been out of Chennai for nearly a week now, away at Kodaikanal to complete the script for a new Tamil film Kannamma that he is writing.

 But after yesterday?s relative political calm ? some newspapers even described Singh?s trip to Chennai as a ?non-political visit? ? the ADMK got its act together, training its guns at the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government at the Centre in which the DMK is a key constituent. The move came amidst reports that the former governor of Tamil Nadu, Surjit Singh Barnala, was being re-appointed in place of Rao.

 Coming down on the ?political pressure being exercised by the DMK in pressuring the President of India to transfer the present governor of Tamil Nadu?, an ADMK press release said it ?considers this demand of the DMK as totally unreasonable, apart from the fact that it violates the federal structure of the country?.

 The issue concerning transfer of governors was pending before the Supreme Court, the ADMK pointed out.

 ?The Supreme Court has already been approached in the matter. We request your excellency to kindly wait for the Supreme Court?s verdict in the matter and not to approve any file to appoint a new governor for Tamil Nadu and thereby render constitutional justice,? the ADMK members of the Rajya Sabha and the MLAs said in their messages to the President.

 Simultaneously, they have also sent individual ?telegraphic writ petitions? to the Chief Justice of India, Justice R.C. Lahoti, urging him to treat their telegrams as writ petitions to restrain the central government ?from advising the President of India to transfer the present governor of Tamil Nadu?.

 Pointing out that a writ petition raising identical issues, in which 12 ADMK members of Parliament have impleaded themselves, was already pending before the apex court, they said that the ?action of the Union of India is an attempt due to the political pressure of its ally, the DMK, to overreach the issue pending in the Supreme Court?.

 Therefore, ?kindly restrain the Union of India from transferring the present governor of Tamil Nadu?, the ADMK MPs and MLAs pleaded in their ?telegraphic writ petitions?. The order transferring Ramamohan Rao was expected to come on Monday, but the ruling party here has promptly moved a day ahead to stall that proposed action.

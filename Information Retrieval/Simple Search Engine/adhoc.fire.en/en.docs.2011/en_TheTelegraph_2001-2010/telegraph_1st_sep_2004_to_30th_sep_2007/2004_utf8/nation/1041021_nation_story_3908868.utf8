 New Delhi, Oct. 20: Brajesh Mishra, the national security adviser and principal secretary to the Prime Minister in the NDA regime, today warned against tailoring intelligence reports to suit governments and politicians. 

 Doctoring intelligence inputs to suit pre-determined action would lead to greater disasters than the intelligence failures themselves, Mishra said at the inaugural of a workshop on Recent Intelligence Failures in the US, UK and Russia: Lessons for India.

 Illustrating his point, Mishra pointed to the intelligence inputs that were designed to pander to policies of the governments in the US and the UK and justify the invasion of Iraq. This produced a ?catastrophic result?, he told an audience of defence experts, former and current intelligence officials and security officials at the Observer Research Foundation here today.

 Mishra also emphasised the need for co-ordination among agencies and noted that communication gaps among security outfits was a problem not only in India but also in countries like the US. He said the attacks on New York?s World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, might have been pre-empted if the FBI and the CIA had co-ordinated and exchanged intelligence on the possible actions of the terrorists. But the intelligence the FBI had gathered following the arrest of Zarqawi Musavi was not passed on to the other agency, he added.

 Mishra said even the report on an earlier attack on the World Trade Center in 1993 was not studied and assessed. As an example of the lack of co-ordination he cited the instance of one intelligence agency official speaking negatively when asked whether a particular piece of information had been passed on to the other for necessary action. Mishra said it was important to strike the right balance to overcome the shortcomings of secrecy and reap the benefits of transparency.

 Strategic affairs analyst K. Subrahmanyam, in his keynote address, said the Joint Intelligence Committee was turned into the cabinet secretariat by the NDA government. He said unfortunately, the UPA government was also persisting with the practice. 

 Subrahmanyam said the National Security Council had also failed to be effective. He said even before the war of 1962 with China, there were intelligence inputs but those were not assessed.

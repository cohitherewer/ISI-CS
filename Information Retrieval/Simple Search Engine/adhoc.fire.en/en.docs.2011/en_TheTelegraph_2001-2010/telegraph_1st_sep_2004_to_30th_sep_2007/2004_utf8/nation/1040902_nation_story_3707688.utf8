 Samajwadi attack on Laloo

 ASHISH SINHA

 Patna, Sept. 1: The first pre-poll challenge to Laloo Prasad Yadav came today from Independent MLA Dadan Singh Pehalwan, an upcoming Yadav leader of west Bihar, with the Samajwadi Party promising to back any effort to throw the Rashtriya Janata Dal government out of office.

 Not just Pehalwan, Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh and Mulayam Singhs son Akhilesh, both MPs, also went hammer and tongs at Laloo Prasad for unleashing 14 years of misrule in Bihar.

 Amar Singh tendered a public apology for his leader (Mulayam Singh) being instrumental, along with Devi Lal, in catapulting Laloo Prasad to political prominence and making him chief minister in 1990.

 To atone for that mistake, I make a solemn promise that the Samajwadi Party will never align with Laloo Prasad, whatever be the circumstances. The bluff of the RJD presidents political policy of use and throw needs to be called. Bihar desperately needs a change and that is not possible as long as Laloo Prasad is in command, Amar Singh said.

 The Uttar Pradesh duos sharing of a platform with Pehalwan is significant because it signals that the Samajwadi Partys political interest in Bihar was here to stay. 

 The party fielded a large number of candidates in the Lok Sabha polls, some of whom garnered impressive votes.

 We were not able to open our account in Bihar though our candidates did well. We will definitely win seats in the Assembly poll and for that we extend an invitation to Dadan Pehalwan and other leaders like him to join hands with us, Akhilesh said.

 The leaders were speaking at a function to inaugurate the rath yatra of Lorik, the mythological god of the Yadavs.

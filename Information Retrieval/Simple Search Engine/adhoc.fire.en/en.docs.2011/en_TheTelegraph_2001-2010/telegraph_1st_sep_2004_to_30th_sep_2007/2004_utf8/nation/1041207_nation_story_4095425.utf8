 Lok Sabha repeals terror law

 - Left joins cry on review by panel

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 6: The Lok Sabha today repealed the Prevention of Terrorism Act amid a walkout by the National Democratic Alliance. The bill repealing the controversial anti-terror law will be sent to the Rajya Sabha in a few days for discussion and approval.

 The Lower House also approved another bill amending the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 to strengthen the fight against terrorism.

 Both measures were passed by voice vote after a nearly five-hour discussion during which the United Progressive Alliance argued for repealing the previous anti-terror act citing several instances of its misuse and the NDA opposed a repeal.

 The Opposition alliance was isolated on the repeal, but the Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party and the Left joined the BJP in asking for the amendment bill to be sent to a parliamentary standing committee.

 Speaker Somnath Chatterjee rejected the demand for referring the amendment bill to a standing committee, saying this was not being done as the ordinance and the bill would lapse on January 12 after Parliament?s winter session ends. Thus, the bill had to be passed during the session itself, said the Speaker who made it clear that he personally favours referring important bills to a standing committee.

 The Samajwadi Party and the BSP separately walked out to protest the decision not to refer the new bill to the standing committee. The CPM and CPI wanted more consultations to ensure that certain provisions of the old anti-terror act which have been included in the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Amendment bill, 2004 are not misused.

 With CPI hinting it could abstain from voting if the government did not agree to consultations, the Leader of the House, Pranab Mukherjee, said amendments could be made in the second bill, if required, even after the House passes it.

 Leader of the Opposition, L.K. Advani, demanded that the repeal and the amendment should be referred to the home ministry?s standing committee. He said in the past too a bill replacing an ordinance has been referred to the standing committee and cited examples.

 Advani said India would be the first country to repeal an anti-terror law despite the UN Security Council having stated that terrorism is the biggest danger the world faces. He added that the Prevention of Terrorism Act should not be repealed just because it has been abused in some cases.

 The Opposition leader led a walkout by the BJP and its allies after home minister Shivraj Patil said the government opposed referring the bills to the standing committee.

 Gurudas Dasgupta of the CPI asked the government not to link the repeal of one bill with the passage of the other, saying: ?This is not the way to pass a bill.?

 Patil assured the House that the Centre would consult the Left on the second bill after the CPI and CPM protested against the decision not to refer the amendment bill, 2004 to the standing committee.

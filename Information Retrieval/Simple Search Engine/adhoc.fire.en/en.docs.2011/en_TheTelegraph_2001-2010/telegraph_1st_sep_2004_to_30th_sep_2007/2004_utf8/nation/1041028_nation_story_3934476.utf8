 Catch Modi in Gandhi cloth

 BASANT RAWAT 

 Narendra Modi

 Ahmedabad, Oct. 27: Enthused by how popular his short-sleeved ?Modi kurta? has become, Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi wants every BJP worker to promote khadi and thereby boost the rural economy.

 To popularise the use of the fabric, 

 Modi has asked party workers to buy at least one set of 

 khadi clothes a year and promote their sale and use. The 

 chief minister will set a personal example, buying the fabric 

 from a khadi outlet in his Maninagar constituency on November 

 3.

 Modi, who will be accompanied by some BJP workers, hopes to inspire party colleagues into following his lead.

 Gandhians are not impressed by his sudden love for khadi, but BJP insiders say Modi hopes the fabric-buying will lead to bonding between party workers dispirited by the recent electoral reverses. Gandhians like Chunni Vaidya believe the desire for khadi is fuelled by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh?s realisation that there is no alternative to the Gandhian model for boosting the rural economy.

 All BJP MLAs have been instructed to start buying khadi in their constituencies. The party has asked 60,000 active members across Gujarat to buy the fabric from a khadi outlet in their area.

 Long before the chief minister asked party functionaries to launch a statewide khadi movement, Gujarat unit general secretary Nalin Bhatt and two BJP officials were already sporting the ?Modi kurta? which proved a hot favourite during Navratri.

 Loyalists of the chief minister say there is no ?hidden agenda?? behind the promotion of khadi. They point out that the government organised a successful khadi fashion show at Porbander during Gandhi Jayanti last year. An aide said the National Institute of Fashion Technology has taken up designing khadi clothes because of Modi?s initiative.

 But Gandhian Prakash Shah doubted the chief minister?s motives, dubbing the move a desperate Modi attempt to gain legitimacy. ?When you are feeling guilty, you are in search of legitimacy,? he said, adding that this sort of gimmick will not work.

 BJP general secretary Jayanti 

 Barot said the party has 20 lakh primary members in Gujarat. 

 The khadi industry is sure to flourish when they start wearing 

 the fabric, she said.

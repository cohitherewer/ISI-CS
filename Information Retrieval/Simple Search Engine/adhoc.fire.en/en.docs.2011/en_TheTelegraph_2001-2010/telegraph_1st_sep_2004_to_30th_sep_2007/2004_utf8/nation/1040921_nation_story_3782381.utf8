 Atal in damage control

 Uma Bharti

 New Delhi, Sept. 20: The BJP has switched to damage-limitation to scotch rumours that the party had distanced itself from Uma Bharti?s ?tiranga yatra? because its chief M. Venkaiah Naidu saw her as a potential threat to his leadership.

 It was announced today that former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee will address a public meeting at Jalllianwala Bagh in Amritsar when the yatra concludes there on Saturday. Sources said Naidu may also participate if his ailing wife is better by then.

 The BJP will ferry a team of journalists from the capital for a news conference Uma will address in Agra tomorrow.

 These moves have been initiated amid murmurs of an alleged spat between Uma and Naidu. She reportedly accused him of trying to prevent Vajpayee from addressing the Jallianwala Bagh rally saying he had already spoken at a September 8 meeting in Bangalore where BJP leaders offered a ?satyagraha? to protest Uma?s arrest.

 The upshot of his ?tiff? with Uma was that Naidu cancelled his visit to Bhopal where he was to have addressed a joint meeting with her. Janata Dal (United) president George Fernandes turned up in his place.

 The official BJP version is that Naidu skipped the meeting because his wife was unwell and he had to rush to Chennai to attend to her.

 But the party has been hesitant about Uma?s rally from the start. She was reportedly told not to go ahead with the yatra and plunge herself into the Maharashtra election campaign instead. When she refused to budge, the leadership decided to involve the organisation and not let Uma ?steal the thunder?. Thus, the BJP chief sent his confidant and Bangalore MP Ananth Kumar to accompany her.

 But sources close to Uma said the party headquarters was out to ?sabotage? the yatra. They said while ?press parties? were organised to cover ?lesser? events addressed by other leaders, Uma?s rally got short shrift.

 Uma?s reaction prompted the BJP?s media cell to call off a plan to fly journalists to Port Blair to cover tomorrow?s ?satyagraha? by Sushma Swaraj to protest the removal of Veer Savarakar?s plaque.

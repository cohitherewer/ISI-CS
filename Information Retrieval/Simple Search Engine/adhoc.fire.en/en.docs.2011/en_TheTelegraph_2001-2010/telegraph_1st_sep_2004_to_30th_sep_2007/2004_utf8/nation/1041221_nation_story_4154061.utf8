The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 BJP offers Somnath balm, just

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 20: The National Democratic Alliance has expressed displeasure with Speaker Somnath Chatterjee for not mentioning railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav?s name in his statement on adjourning the Lok Sabha last Thursday.

 NDA sources said the coalition leaders, who met today, were upset by what they called the Speaker?s ?bias?. 

 The sources said Chatterjee took ?no action? against Laloo Prasad for failing to come to Parliament to make a statement on the Punjab train accident.

 However, at the end of the meeting, attended by leaders such as A.B. Vajpayee and L.K. Advani, a carefully worded statement was issued so as not to rub the Speaker the wrong way. It was also decided to send an NDA delegation to Chatterjee ? who had offered to resign at being called dictatorial by BJP MPs ? to assuage his feelings and offer constructive cooperation to the chair.

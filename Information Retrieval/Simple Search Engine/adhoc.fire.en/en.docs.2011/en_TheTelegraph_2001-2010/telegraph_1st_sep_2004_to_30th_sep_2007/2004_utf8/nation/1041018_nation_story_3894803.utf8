 Plea for schoolgirl

 New Delhi, Oct. 17 (PTI): A 10-year-old girl?s mother has sought the intervention of Delhi High Court against a south Delhi school?s decision to throw out her child for alleged violent behaviour.

 The girl?s name was struck off the rolls on October 6 for allegedly showing erratic, violent and disruptive behaviour.

 In her petition, the girl?s mother denied the charges and urged the court to direct the school to take back her ward. She claimed the school took the step because she had opposed its advice that the child be withdrawn from regular classes and put in a study centre for physically and mentally challenged children.

 Claiming that putting the child in the learning centre was actually harming her, the petitioner said that doctors of Vimhans Hospital had opined that the child was fit.

 The petition came up for hearing on Friday before Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, who refused to hear it saying it should go the appropriate bench dealing with education-related cases.

 Putin: Meet on cards

 New Delhi, Oct. 10: Russian President Vladimir Putin will visit India for an annual summit with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, scheduled for December 3 and 4.

 The dates were finalised after discussions this evening between visiting Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov and his Indian counterpart K. Natwar Singh. Lavrov met the Prime Minister and conveyed to him Putin?s desire to attend the December summit.

 The Indian and Russian foreign ministers and their Chinese counterpart Li Zhaoxing will meet in Almaty on October 21 and 22 to discuss closer cooperation, especially in trade, between the three nations.

 The two sides held wide-ranging talks on bilateral issues as well as regional and international developments. The India-Pakistan peace process, developments in Iraq and Afghanistan and global terrorism came up for discussion.

 Natwar Singh said Indo-Russian ties have been traditionally strong, but emphasis was now on deepening trade and economic cooperation. He said defence collaboration, especially between the army and navy, has been extremely satisfactory.

 The ministers identified science and technology, biotechnology, energy and the civilian space programme as areas in which the countries could work closely.

 Lavrov said a number of Russian companies were interested in investing here. This includes energy giant Gazprom which is keen to work in the Bay of Bengal for oil and gas exploration.

 Asked if Russia, a Group of Eight member, would support India?s entry into the exclusive club, he said: ?Evolution of the G8 is going to continue. India?s position in the world today makes it one of the leading powers and we certainly believe it is healthy for international system and makes it more balanced and more stable.?

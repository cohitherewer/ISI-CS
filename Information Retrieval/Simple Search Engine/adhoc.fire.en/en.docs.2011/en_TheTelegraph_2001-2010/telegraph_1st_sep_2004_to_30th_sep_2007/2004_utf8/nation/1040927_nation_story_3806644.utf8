The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Tour titans discover power of ?small guys? 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Sept. 26: A hassle-free holiday and an experience to remember ? that?s what Indians want and it?s the travel agents? job to see that they get it. This was the hot topic on the final day of deliberations at the Travel Agents? Association of India (Taai) annual convention today. 

 Sharing the spotlight was the theme Incredible India, discussed within the larger framework of global opportunities in tourism. 

 Wooing Indian travellers were Italian and Singaporean officials, but making a stronger mark was J. Daboo, CEO of the Taj group of hotels, with his pitch for India. ?A study has shown that people increasingly demand hassle-free holidays, safety, something for the entire family, no hidden costs and an experience,? he said. 

 It wasn?t just about wooing foreigners, but also about promoting domestic travel.

 ?We?ve still got a firang mentality. Why?? asked Ranjit Malkani, chairman and CEO, Kuoni Travel Group. ?When I spoke to the chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir, he didn?t know about me or SOTC, one of the biggest travel agencies in the country run by us. He was impressed with some Kesaribhai Patel from Mumbai, who had sent 40,000 people to Kashmir last year. We have to start tapping into that potential. The small guys are very important. There is immense scope to develop this sector.? 

 While the Northeast showcased by the Indian Chamber of Commerce held the eyeballs, delegates were left wide-eyed by the some number crunching by UB Group chairman Vijay Mallya. ?A two-digit growth in travel is expected in the next several years? The industry forecast is a four-fold swell in passenger traffic over the next 20 years,? he said. 

 The member of Rajya Sabha added the railway ferries 14 million passengers a day; airlines took one year (2003) to match the figure. But the period from this April to May has already seen a 29.7 per cent rise. 

 ?I was shocked when somebody told me recently that the largest number of per capita (population-wise) Mercedes Benz was in Coimbatore, Guwahati and Ludhiana,? he said. ?So we have to look at the secondary and tertiary sectors.? 

 India?s image has changed, making the world sit up and take notice, said Ashwini Kakkar, CEO and managing director of Thomas Cook. 

 ?The BBC and CNN image of a troubled and poverty-stricken India is gone. National Geographic has rated it the second best travel destination in the world and it?s on the top 10 list of Discovery Channel and the travel bible Conde Nast, an international magazine,? Kakkar told The Telegraph. 

 The president of the Bombay Chamber of Commerce and Industry was on a recent trip to Italy, when tourism minister Renuka Chowdhury made a presentation on India to travel agents. ?They were amazed. It was an equally good reception in Paris. She?s planning another one in the UK soon.?

 Opening up the skies would only improve the situation, Kakkar said. ?Now you?ve got the Vijay Mallyas, Gautam Singhanias and others jumping on the private airlines bandwagon, which means better connectivity. Thomas Cook brings in several chartered flights of foreigners into India, with different brands targeting various segments. For instance, if it?s a trekking holiday, they?ll bring their own tents. So, not much infrastructure is required. I foresee a huge growth in the next five years.?

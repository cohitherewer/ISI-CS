 Kalyan sees Babri as ?act of God?

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 3: Kalyan Singh today stated before the Liberhan Commission that the Babri Masjid demolition was ?an act of God? and retracted his earlier statements accusing three senior BJP leaders of ?conspiracy?.

 ?It (demolition) was the spontaneous act of the kar sevaks and there was no role of his (Singh?s) government nor any other governmental agency? and ?the reaction was an act of God?, said Singh?s ?corrected affidavit? filed today before the panel.

 Stating that the affidavit filed today should be considered the real one, Singh said he had made accusatory statements on the role of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, L.K. Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi in the demolition out of ?aavesh (anger)?.

 The former Uttar Pradesh chief minister said he was angered by news reports that the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance government had told the panel last year that his state government had failed to arrange for the mosque?s protection on December 6, 1992.

 ?This statement of the counsel for the central government was wrong and badly hurt the deponent (Singh),? the affidavit said.

 ?In that reaction and anger, the deponent might have said before the media that there was a conspiracy between Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee, L.K. Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi etc to demolish the disputed structure.

 ?The deponent has no knowledge, information or evidence to support the above allegations,? the affidavit added.

 The Congress poked fun at BJP leaders for their tendency to invoke ?divinity?. Advani had at a recent meeting in Ranchi said his party is ?really the chosen instrument of the divine to take the country out of its present problems?.

 Congress spokesperson Anand Sharma said ?if that is the case, it was also the divine wish as to what happened on May 13 (results of Lok Sabha polls that the BJP-led alliance lost)?.

 Singh?s affidavit was filed in response to former Bengal chief minister Jyoti Basu?s production of an audio-video tape before the commission last year to contend there was a pre-planned move to demolish the mosque.

 The tape, played before Singh yesterday at the panel, showed him at a Calcutta rally in 1993 purportedly saying that he had ?no regrets? over the demolition.

 Since the demolition was ?an act of God?, Singh?s affidavit said he had ?no repentance, no sorrow and no grief for that (demolition)? and he had conveyed this to his listeners at the Calcutta rally.

 Singh said he had taken all security measures to protect the mosque but made no bones of his view that he was for the construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya. Lord Ram is the symbol of ?Bharatiyata (Indianness)?, the affidavit said.

 Left meet

 New Delhi, Nov. 8: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will meet Left leaders over lunch on Thursday to discuss the hike in the prices of petrol and LPG, reports our special correspondent. 

 Indications are that the government might offer some relief ? the proposed Rs 5 rise in the price of LPG every month is likely to be scrapped. The Prime Minister had on Friday appealed to the Left parties to understand that the price hike had become unavoidable.

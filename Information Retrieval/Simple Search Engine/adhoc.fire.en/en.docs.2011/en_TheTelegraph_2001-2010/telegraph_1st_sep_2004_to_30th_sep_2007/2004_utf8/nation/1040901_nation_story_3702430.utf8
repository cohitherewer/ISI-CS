 Flagging mood fuels BJP Tricolour rethink 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Uma Bharti

 New Delhi, Aug. 31: The 

 BJP might press ahead with its satyagraha and Uma Bharti 

 her tiranga yatra even after she walks free.

 The mood yesterday was both would be called off after the Karnataka government said it was sticking to an earlier decision to drop charges against Uma, jailed for inciting riots after a controversial flag-hoisting ceremony in 1994 left several people dead.

 BJP sources said the rethink came with the realisation that the Tricolour hype might fizzle out once Uma is released. The party, the sources added, would also have to occupy her gainfully in keeping with her stature and temperament a functionary described her as a loose cannon. So the buzz today was both are on the satyagraha to sustain the build-up and the yatra to keep the former Madhya Pradesh chief minister busy.

 Although, for the record, spokesman Arun Jaitley said the issue of reconsidering the satyagraha will come up after the court pronounces its order, senior leader .K. Advani and party chief M. Venkaiah Naidu left for Bangalore today. Advani is scheduled to launch the protest from Bangalore tomorrow.

 The BJP had hoped to squeeze the Uma and Veer Savarkar issues dry for the October polls in Maharashtra. Sources said the party was hoping the Congress would not try and make amends for petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyars alleged insult of the Hindu Mahasabha leader.

 But its feedback was Aiyar might lose the portfolio in the next cabinet revamp and his successor might repair the damage by restoring the plaque with Savarkars quotations in Port Blairs Cellular Jail.

 The sources said Uma would be asked to plan her Hubli-Jallianwala Bagh yatra once she is released and ruled out her reinstatement as chief minister. It will look improper if we keep changing heads of government every two weeks, said a source.

 Laloo slams Cong

 Railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav today criticised the Congress-led Karnataka government for going soft on Uma. The Karnataka governments decision is in bad taste and will send a wrong message, he said in Patna.

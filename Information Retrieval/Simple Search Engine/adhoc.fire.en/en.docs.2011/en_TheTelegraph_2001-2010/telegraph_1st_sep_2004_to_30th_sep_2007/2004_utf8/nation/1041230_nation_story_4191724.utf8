 EC to keep officers on leash 

 FARHANA KALAM

 Gaya, Dec. 29: State-sponsored ?holidays? are likely to get over soon for election officials.

 Addressing returning officers at a training programme in Gaya yesterday, Election Commission adviser K.J. Rao made it clear that the panel will not accept any lapse on their part during the Assembly election in Bihar.

 In the past, election observers as well as returning officers consider their deputation as state-funded ?holidays?, sources alleged. After yesterday?s wake-up call, they can be expected to take their jobs more seriously.

 Returning officers of 26 Assembly constituencies in the Magadh division and their assistants were present in the training session. 

 Rao is understood to have ordered the poll officers to remain faithful only to the Constitution and not allow their personal likes, dislikes and compulsions to come in the way of their duty.

 The adviser?s tough stand comes in the wake of allegations of casual approach on the part of a section of election observers. The alleged indifference and incompetence of many poll officials, said sources, are to an extent responsible for electoral malpractice, which forces the commission to countermand elections.

 Shedding light on the ?indifference? of poll officers, the sources cited a couple of instances to add substance to their allegations. 

 A few years ago, an election observer deputed in the Chatra Lok Sabha constituency of undivided Bihar (now in Jharkhand) instead went to Chhapra and stayed there for several days. It was only after the arrival of the actual observer for Chhapra that he realised his mistake.

 Another oft-quoted case was the misuse of STD facility at the Gaya circuit house by an observer a few years ago. A printout later submitted to the commission made it clear that almost all STD calls were made to friends and relatives of the observer.

 Sources said the commission plans to keep its observers on a tight leash and to ensure that, the observers have been directed to stay in the hub of respective constituencies and not the district headquarters. If for some reason, the observers have to stay away from the constituency headquarters, they will have to furnish specific reasons. 

 However, the adviser altogether skipped the issue of disciplining errant observers during his interaction with reporters, choosing not to comment.

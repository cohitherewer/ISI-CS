 Sex abuse plea in SC

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 5: The Supreme Court has decided to hear a petition by the Tamil Nadu government seeking to quash a Madras High Court order for a CBI probe into the Jayalakshmi ?sexual abuse? case.

 The court posted the hearing to October 15. 

 S. Jayalakshmi, a sales woman from Sivakasi, had alleged that practically the entire top brass of Tamil Nadu police had ?sexually exploited? her and ?enjoyed? her like ?beasts? to ?quench their sexual thirst?.

 A habeas corpus petition was initially filed two months ago by Jayalakshmi?s father as she was ?missing? from home. Such a writ petition is moved in a high court or the Supreme Court for a directive to state authorities to ?bodily produce? a person missing or allegedly killed in police custody.

 Chennai police produced Jayalakshmi in court, contending that she was in custody for cases relating to the suppression of immortal traffic act. As the case was progressing, Jayalakshmi in her affidavit said she was sexually abused and named almost all top police officials.

 The high court said it was a fit case for a CBI investigation. Against this, the Tamil Nadu government moved the Supreme Court.

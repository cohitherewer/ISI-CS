 Fifth court blow to Andhra CM

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, Nov. 18: Andhra Pradesh High Court today cancelled all 67 packages of government tenders for nine major irrigation projects, dealing the fifth judicial blow to the Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy regime.

 Yesterday, the same bench of Chief Justice Devender Gupta and Justice C.V. Ramulu had stopped work on the Rs 570-crore Pulichintala project that aimed to cultivate 10.42 lakh acres around the Krishna delta.

 The latest order is a major setback to the six-month-old Congress government?s irrigation initiatives in a state that has been hit by farmer suicides and starvation deaths.

 The court directed the state to call again for global tenders for the projects worth Rs 36,000 crore and also disqualified seven of the nine companies that the government had shortlisted out of the eligible 37.

 The court observed that the notification inviting the contractors should not have been restricted to some companies and asked the state to involve all eligible organisations in the fresh tender process.

 Following the orders, the chief minister this evening held a meeting with finance minister K. Rosaiah, major irrigation minister P. Lakshmaiah and officials.

 Late tonight, the two ministers said the state had decided to re-issue all 67 packages of tenders afresh.

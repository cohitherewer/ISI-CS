 Laloo charts progress path

 - RJD chief inaugurates power line, seeks people power for December 23 rally in Patna

 ASHISH SINHA

 Biharsharif, Dec. 12: Abhi nahin to kabhi nahin (If not now, then never). That was the message from Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Laloo Prasad to the people of Bihar, asking them not to let the ?best development package of pro-poor governments? in Patna and Delhi slip away.

 ?There is no dearth of money, now that we have a friendly government in Delhi. Infrastructure will be built in Bihar. The state will see big investment very soon and your lives will improve. Before that, come to Patna for the December 23 rally. Reach the previous evening itself. One crore people will come,? the railway minister said here at the inauguration of a Powergrid Corporation transmission line from NTPC?s Kahalgaon unit.

 The RJD president is not known to focus greatly on development as an agenda the way he is doing for the coming elections. ?Vikas mudda nahi hain (Development is not an issue),? he famously said not long ago.

 ?There will be a massive food-for-work programme in the building of infrastructure in Bihar. Whether it is electricity or roads, the poor of Bihar will have a lot of work to do. This will especially benefit the Dalits, backward classes and the minorities. I will also check the migration of labour in a year,? Laloo Prasad said.

 The RJD president said the need of the hour was unity in the state. ?Whatever I say, I do. Barsati beng halla kar raha hain (Some monsoon frogs are making noise). They say they will uproot the RJD government. Rabri Devi koi mooli nahin hain ki ukhaad donge (Rabri Devi is not a radish that can be uprooted). Now is the time for the development of Bihar,? he added.

 The railway minister said central agencies will come to Bihar, an oblique admission of the fact that the state agencies have been unable to deliver the goods. ?If an engineer of any central agency comes to your village to construct a road, you should welcome him. Some politicians were behind the kidnapping of two NHPC officials recently. I will soon expose them,? he said.

 The railway minister is busy launching schemes of the Union government, most of them proposed by the previous NDA government, before the model code of conduct comes into operation. The state government too has been liberally announcing development schemes. 

 Laloo Prasad had a few words for the media as well. ?They devote so much time to Pappu Yadav making phone calls from the jail. They should focus on the more positive aspects. I will not let Bihar become a joke,? he said. 

 Union power minister P.M. Sayeed said a total investment of Rs 16,000 crore has been planned for Bihar. ?This includes funds for enhancing the capacity of central power undertakings as well as rural electrification projects. All transmission and distribution problems will be over in two years,? he added. 

 In choosing his words, Laloo Prasad unwittingly echoed Mamata Banerjee, a former railway minister herself. Laloo Prasad will do well to remember that the ?now? of Banerjee?s ?now or never? clarion call ? given before the 2001 Assembly election in West Bengal ? is yet to come.

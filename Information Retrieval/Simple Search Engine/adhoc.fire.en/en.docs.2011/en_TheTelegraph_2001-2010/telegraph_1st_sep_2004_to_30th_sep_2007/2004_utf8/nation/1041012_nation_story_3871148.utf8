 Topple talk over tea

 KAY BENEDICT

 New Delhi, Oct. 11: Five 

 seasoned heads and an old ?Young Turk? today met over tea, 

 reviving memories of the April 1999 party at a five-star 

 hotel that had heralded the fall of the then Vajpayee government.

 This time, too, the agenda was similar, though the target and the setting were different. The objective was how to topple the Congress-led government while the venue was the residence of NDA convener George Fernandes. The theme songs of the main actors were ?Sonia Gandhi is a threat to national security? and ?devaluation of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh?.

 There was another difference: Subramanian Swamy, who threw the April 10 tea party five years ago, is now on the other side of the fence.

 Fernandes had stepped up efforts to revive the third front after astrologers predicted that the government would fall on September 26. Speculation has been rife that he sent feelers to DMK chief M. Karunanidhi and offered him the prime ministership of a third front government if he defected from the ruling alliance.

 But Karunanidhi is said to have told Fernandes loyalists that he had quit the NDA first. And though the Samajwadi Party?s Mulayam Singh Yadav and Amar Singh are waiting for the opportune moment, Left leaders have refused to play ball.

 Apart from Fernandes and Swamy, those who attended the meet were former Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar, the old ?Young Turk?, JD (U) leader Digvijay Singh, the Shiv Sena?s Sanjay Nirupam and Fernandes? confidante Jaya Jaitly. The BJP?s Uma Bharti and former Lok Sabha Speaker P.A. Sangma could not make it. 

 Fernandes said the meeting decided to float a ?National Self Respect Front? on November 4 to address ?challenges? before the country. 

 Sikh ?insult?

 The BJP today found itself under fire for Narendra Modi?s allegedly ?insulting? remarks against Manmohan Singh and Sikhs. Though the party denied that the Gujarat chief minister had used the ?12 midnight? analogy at an election rally in Maharashtra, even poll partner Shiromani Akali Dal was up in arms. The Congress sought Modi?s resignation.

 Plane to Nepal stirs Purulia ghost

 OUR BUREAUS IN AHMEDABAD AND NEW DELHI

 Sept. 29: An aircraft carrying arms and ammunition despatched by the US government for Nepal landed in Ahmedabad and took off for Kathmandu today, reviving in its wake the ghost of the Purulia arms drop.

 Unlike that December 1995 event in which an Antonov transporter air-dropped lethal cargo in the Bengal countryside, the Antonov-12 this time was carrying legal cargo with both the US and Indian governments extending support to Nepal?s insurgency-threatened administration. 

 US embassy and Indian government sources said the aircraft landed this morning around 7.25 and took off for Kathmandu shortly before noon.

 But a media report that said the aircraft was detained since Saturday had he security establishment aflutter. 

 The Hindu newspaper reported that officials of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation had confirmed on Tuesday that as of yesterday morning, the aircraft was at an Indian airport.

 Today, Ahmedabad airport director .S. Jaldhari said the plane took off five hours after it landed and customs and intelligence officials had searched the cargo and found nothing ?objectionable?. 

 Asked for details, the Ahmedabad airport director said ?I can only only tell you that it was not a scheduled flight? and hastened to add that ?we did not find anything objectionable . They were in possession of valid documents?. He denied that the plane was ?detained?.

 A spokesperson for the US embassy in New Delhi said: ?The US state department is training Nepal police to develop anti-terrorist capability. The state department carries out ?anti terrorist assistance programme? in several countries. The US and India share similar objectives in Nepal and both support the training initiative. The US embassy had informed the Indian government about the training programme and had received clearance for the plane to land and depart.?

 The An-12 took off from Bulgaria last evening. It was carrying simulated ammunition and arms for training and equipping Nepal police, the spokesperson said. 

 The ministry of external affairs also said the Indian government was ?aware of the supply of certain explosives and ammunition sent by the US government to Nepal for use in its training programme for Nepalese police in counter-insurgency operations?.

 A foreign ministry spokesperson said the clearance for the Bulgarian cargo flight was given yesterday after necessary internal procedures, subject to standard stipulation. 

 However, the official version of events does leave some questions unanswered:

 If the aircraft landed 

 in Ahmedabad this morning and took off around noon, how 

 could the DGCA confirm yesterday that the plane was in an 

 Indian airport

 How routine is it for foreign 

 aircraft carrying arms and ammunition to land and take off 

 from Indian airports

 Why did the US use a private 

 airline for a government-to-government delivery of weapons?

 Riot cloud on Arjun clears

 AYSWARIA VENUGOPAL

 Arjun Singh

New Delhi, Oct. 20: BJP leader Uma Bharti stepped down as Madhya Pradesh chief minister after an arrest warrant was issued against her in a rioting case. But Union minister Arjun Singh and Uttaranchal chief minister .D. Tiwari need not worry that they may have to resign.

 The Delhi government has ordered withdrawal of a rioting case against Singh and Tiwari. According to government sources, the decision to withdraw the case was taken about a week ago at a meeting of the home department?s apex committee, headed by Lieutenant Governor B.. Joshi.

 An FIR lodged with Parliament Street police station on August 9, 1995, had accused three Congress leaders ? among them Singh and Tiwari ? of leading a mob shouting slogans against the then P.V. Narasimha Rao government. At that time, Singh was a Lok Sabha MP.

 According to Delhi government officials, it is routine for the home department?s apex committee to examine cases that are of a politically sensitive nature. ?In 90 per cent of the cases, these are usually withdrawn,? an official said.

 After the apex committee ? which comprises senior officials like the police commissioner and the principal secretary, home ? decides to withdraw a case, the file is sent to the lieutenant governor for approval. 

 The file is then forwarded to the director, prosecution, who sends it to the relevant court.

 But it looks as if the Union human resource development minister and the Uttaranchal leader have nothing to fear from this particular case as the apex committee must have taken into account the Uma case when it arrived at its decision.

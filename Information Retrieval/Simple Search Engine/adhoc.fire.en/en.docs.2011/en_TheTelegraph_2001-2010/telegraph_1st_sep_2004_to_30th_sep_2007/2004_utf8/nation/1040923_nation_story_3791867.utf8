 Amar IT knock yields little

 B.R. SRIKANTH

 Bangalore, Sept. 22: The Uttar Pradesh Development Council today came calling on Infosys Technologies Ltd but left without securing any investment pledges from the IT firm.

 Samajwadi Party general secretary Amar Singh, who heads the council, came with a retinue of several senior bureaucrats following an invitation from Nandan Nilekani, the Infosys CEO and managing director. 

 Chief secretary V.K. Mittal led the team of bureaucrats.

 Nilekani is one of the members of the development council along with Anil Ambani, Amitabh Bachchan, Kumar Mangalam Birla, Adi Godrej, Subrata Roy Sahara, K.V. Kamath and M.S. Banga. 

 Ambani participated in today?s meeting, though the other high-profile members could not make it. 

 Singh said that the state?s proposed IT policy was discussed at the meet, but Nilekani did not commit any investments for Uttar Pradesh. 

 ?We are not disappointed that Infosys did not promise any investments in our state. This is only the beginning and Mr Nilekani has agreed to play a key role in our IT policy. This policy will be taken to the cabinet for approval. He will visit Noida on November 5 to interact with IT leaders and companies to increase the growth rate of the industry in that region,? Singh said.

 In the past nine months, the development council is said to have received investment proposals to the tune of Rs 25,000 crore. The most significant one was made by the Reliance Group in the form of a Rs 15,000-crore gas-based power plant at Dadri. 

 Turning his attention to the coming Maharashtra Assembly elections, Singh said the Samajwadi Party would focus on the Justice Srikrishna Commission report (on the 1992-93 Bombay riots) as well as the Veer Savarkar issue during the run up to the polls.

 He told reporters here that neither were the commission?s findings made public nor its recommendations implemented by the ruling Congress-Nationalist Congress Party coalition in Maharashtra, though both parties harped on it during the previous elections.

 The Samajwadi Party would strive to emerge as the third force in Maharashtra by contesting in regions where it has a strong vote base, he said.

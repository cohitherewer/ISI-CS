 HC scanner on online lottery

 Mumbai (PTI): Bombay High Court has asked 

 the All India Association of Federation of Lottery and Allied 

 Activities as well as the Arunachal Pradesh and Nagaland 

 governments to file affidavits on or before October 5 in 

 response to a public interest litigation (PIL) challenging 

 online lottery and urging for a CBI probe into violation 

 of rules.

 An affidavit filed by the Maharashtra government justified the lottery and said there was nothing illegal about it. However, the Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh governments sought time to file affidavits.

 A bench of Chief Justice Dalveer Bhandari and Justice Dhananjay Chandrachud was hearing a PIL filed by advocate Ratnakar Singh, secretary of Consumer Action Network.

 The PIL challenged online lottery on the Internet and computers saying it violated the provisions of the Lotteries (Registration) Act, 1998 and exploited gullible people. It alleged that the states were not conducting the online lottery themselves but had appointed agents and distributors who were running the show.

 Notice on tomb under threat

 Mumbai (PTI): Bombay High Court on Tuesday 

 issued a notice to the Centre, the Maharashtra government 

 and the collector of Satara district following a petition 

 that said illegal structures have cropped up near the tomb 

 of Mughal warrior Afzal Khan, a heritage site.

 A bench of Chief Justice D.S. Bhandari and Justice D.Y. Chandrachud asked the respondents to disclose by October 4 what steps they had taken against the encroachers and why no measures were taken to ensure that the area was not being encroached upon.

 Advocate Varsha Deshpande had alleged in her petition that the land was being encroached upon and the issue was being used for political upmanship. The tomb was included on the heritage list in 1951 and the land was given on lease to the Hazrat Mohammed Afzal Khan Memorial Society.

 However, this lease was later cancelled by the charity commissioner, who said the land belonged to the government and a private party could not have its ownership. The lawyer for the petitioner said the land is now being used for commercial purposes with lodges and canteens springing up. He prayed for immediate action as some people were seeking demolition of the tomb.

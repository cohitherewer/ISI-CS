 Kanti sings Joshi tune

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 11: Bengal education minister Kanti Biswas wants to bring institutions of higher education under government control, though the UPA?s common minimum programme assures complete autonomy to them.

 The 10-member committee on higher education headed by the minister met this morning in Delhi and floated a formula to look into issues relating to these institutions.

 Sounding strikingly similar to former Union human resource development minister Murli Manohar Joshi, Biswas told a news conference today: ?Autonomy cannot be absolute and it cannot be without accountability.? 

 During his tenure, Joshi had triggered a row with the Indian institutes of management after he charged them with abusing their autonomous status and not being accountable. The BJP minister had decided to slash IIM fees by 80 per cent, in a move that threatened to make them dependent on government funding.

 His successor Arjun Singh scrapped the NDA government?s decisions, met heads of IIMs and promised them that the United Progressive Alliance would not meddle with their functioning and autonomy.

 Biswas, however, has different ideas. ?Central and state governments will have to evolve some kind of a mechanism with the help of academics to monitor higher education institutions,? he said.

 The monitoring bodies will keep tabs on the appointment of teachers, curriculum and the structure of admissions, the CPM leader added.

 Taking a leaf out of Joshi?s book, Biswas said: ?The fee structure must be reasonable. At present, some institutions are using education for profit. This cannot be allowed.?

 The committee on higher education, under the jurisdiction of the Central Advisory Board of Education, will organise four regional workshops across the country to gather views of experts. At the end of the exercise, the committee will make recommendations that the advisory board will study.

 Biswas, who is deeply sceptical of unbridled western influence on education, however, made a concession when he said: ?Globalisation requires students to learn good English. The situation is not what it used to be 10 years ago.?

 The state government, he added, is trying to upgrade the standard of English through collaboration with UK-based funding agencies. ?British teachers will teach our resource teachers, who in turn will train others in different parts of the state.?

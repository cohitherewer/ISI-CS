 After-Tiwari debate in Cong 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 21: With a little over two years to go before the Assembly elections, the Uttaranchal Congress felt it was time the high command effected a mid-course correction to salvage its waning prospects.

 As speculation continued whether chief minister Narayan Dutt Tiwari would stay or be ?honourably retired? with a governor?s job, the growing feeling in the state Congress was his successor should be someone who was an ?integral part of the movement for a separate hill state? and not merely a nominee of Delhi.

 The issue of whether Tiwari would go and who should replace him, if he did, will be discussed at a meeting of the Congress central office-bearers and state leaders next week.

 Well-placed sources in the state Congress said: ?The next chief minister should be part of the movement because the immediate task in hand is to restore the faith of the common man and the party workers in the government. This was a movement which engaged 80 per cent of the population.?

 Sources pointed out that Uttaranchal was born out of this movement, which touched an emotive high in the nineties when the government of Mulayam Singh Yadav enforced its reservation policy for backward castes. 

 The policy impacted the hill regions adversely because they were mainly peopled by the upper castes who stood to lose as much as a 27 per cent share in government jobs and education to the backward castes. The other two states which were created with Uttaranchal ? Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand ? did not experience any such political ferment, sources maintained.

 ?The people feel betrayed and angry because the earlier BJP government and now ours have given nothing new,? said sources.

 Instead of using region and caste as the determinants to pick a new leader ? whether he or she ought to be from Garhwal or Kumaon and a Brahmin or a Thakur ? sources felt a person who was ?hardworking, sharp, honest and with mass contact? should be chosen.

 While Tiwari was brought in with high expectations ? given his record as Union finance minister and Uttar Pradesh chief minister ? the perception was he ?failed? because he could not ?properly guide? the bureaucracy, which was grappling with the problems of an infant state. 

 Also, sources claimed Tiwari and his senior ministers allowed themselves to be guided by a ?coterie? whose commitment to governance was questionable. 

 For instance, the adviser to the public works minister was thrice suspended by the erstwhile Uttar Pradesh government.

 Sources alleged that an obvious fallout was ?rampant corruption?. ?It is pinching ordinary people. We are not talking of mega deals or anything. One has to pay a huge bribe to get into the police or a teaching job. 

 For road construction and other works, the government has favoured companies from outside and overlooked the genuine claims of local contractors,? they said.

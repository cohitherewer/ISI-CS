 BJP plots Dalit push to Savarkar drive

 RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

 Aiyar: Fuel for fire

 New Delhi, Sept. 7: The BJP plans to stress the pro-Dalit affiliations of V.D. Savarkar and the RSS in its campaign for the Maharashtra Assembly polls.

 BJP sources argued that contrary to the Congress claim that the Savarkar controversy would impact only a section of Marathi-speaking Brahmins, the freedom fighter had a pan-Hindu appeal and, if anything, he was disliked by the elite Brahmins for his radical stand on the practice of religious rituals.

 The controversy was provoked by petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyars alleged directive to replace a plaque inscribed with the Hindu Mahasabha founders quotes on a pillar outside Cellular Jail in Port Blair with Mahatma Gandhis sayings.

 The sources said Savarkar founded the Patita Pavana Sanghatana in Ratnagiri to bring Dalits and backward castes into the Hindu fold by propagating abolition of untouchability, entry into temples, equal social status, economic uplift and encouraging them to set up their own educational institutions that should be recognised on a par with those run by the upper castes.

 The BJPs campaign will highlight Savarkars spearhead role in granting them access to the Kala Ram temple in Nashik.

 The RSS is likely to use Maharashtra general secretary Bhiku Ramji Idate in a big way in its door-to-door campaign. Like B.R. Ambedkar, Idate is a Mahar, a Dalit sub-caste.

 In the last 10 years, Sangh sources said, its strategy was to break into Dalit organisations which were monopolised either by the Left or the Republican Party of India (RPI) and its splinters. 

 One way was to float non-political front organisations like the Jana Kalyan Samiti and the Samajik Samrasta Manch, whose one-point agenda was opposing the communists and the church, and get them to work in tandem with the RPI.

 For instance, when Dalits congregated in huge numbers in Mumbai every year on April 6 to commemorate B.R. Ambedkars death anniversary, these RSS outfits helped the Dalit political parties to organise these celebrations. Such participation helped the RSS and, by implication, the BJP to create a base among the community whose votes are substantial in Maharashtra.

 Reacting to an interview given by Aiyar, BJP spokesperson Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said a towering nationalist like Savarkar did not need a certificate of nationalism from a tutpunjiye minister afflicted with negativist thinking.

 Naqvi accused the petroleum minister of using Mahatma Gandhi as a shield to cover his pathetic actions. He should have first read the principles of Gandhiji who had great respect for freedom fighters and nationalists.

 He also questioned an advertisement issued by the Karnataka government that sought to correct the facts on the Uma Bharti episode. He said the Congress was rattled by the BJPs proposed campaign on the Tricolour and the Vande Mataram. The manner in which it (the Congress) was trying to hide its actions, in reality, raised questions on its idea about national honour, self-respect and honour towards the national flag.

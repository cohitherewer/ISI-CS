The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Bansi talks to BJP, returns to Congress

 GAJINDER SINGH

 Swaraj Kaushal: Close shave

 Chandigarh, Oct. 10: Bansi Lal?s Haryana Vikas Party today confirmed its merger with the Congress in the state.

 HVP leaders had been holding parleys with the BJP till a few months ago for an alliance for the Assembly elections, slated early next year.

 If the merger had come through a month earlier, it would have put the husband of Sushma Swaraj, Swaraj Kaushal, in a piquant situation. Kaushal had reached the Rajya Sabha as a nominee of the HVP but his term ended a month ago. Otherwise, the husband of one of the most vocal critics of Sonia Gandhi would have had to be known as a Congress MP or resign.

 Bansi Lal is considered by many as one of the principal villains of Emergency who later joined those who suffered under it. The merger is expected to strengthen the Congress and bring back into its fold voters who had moved away to the HVP. 

 ?We have decided to merge with the Congress,? Bansi Lal told The Telegraph.

 THe HVP leader, who had till recently ? and even in the Assembly ? been maintaining that Sonia Gandhi was a foreigner, said since the Congress president had refused to become Prime Minister, ?the issue is dead?.

 ?It is not true that I and my party leaders, including son Surinder, were talking to the BJP only for an electoral alliance for the Assembly polls. ?We were talking to all parties, big and small, to get together to oust Chautala,? he said.

 While central BJP leaders wanted a tie-up with the HVP even for the Lok Sabha polls held earlier this year, its members had threatened to resign en masse in the event of any electoral understanding with the party.

 Close aides of state Congress president Bhajan Lal said it was early to comment on the merger. While some said Bhupinder Singh Hooda was behind the merger, many termed it as a move by Birender Singh Chauhan, who has been eyeing the chief minister?s chair.

 The proposed merger is expected to be announced on October 14 at the AICC headquarters in New Delhi and is likely to aggravate the existing factionalism within the Congress in the state. 

 ?There will be many from the HVP aspiring for tickets. Can the Congress ignore its loyal workers and give tickets to those who had betrayed it when the party needed them the most?? asked a leader.

 The merger is also being seen as a last-ditch effort by an ailing Bansi Lal to ensure that son Surinder?s political career remained secure.

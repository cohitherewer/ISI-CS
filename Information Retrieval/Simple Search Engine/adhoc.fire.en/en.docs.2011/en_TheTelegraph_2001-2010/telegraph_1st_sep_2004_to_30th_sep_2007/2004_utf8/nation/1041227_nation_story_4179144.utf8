 Livelihood swept away

 Chennai, Dec. 26: Homes and hearts were broken by the time the tsunamis were through with Marina beach here, the world?s second largest.

 ?The waves rose up nearly 50 ft to hit the upper tip of the lampposts, marched 500 metres into the Beach main road and minutes later, I saw at least seven bodies of women. They were fisherfolk who had come to sell their ware this morning,? cried Durai, whose makeshift seashell shop was washed away.

 The entire stretch of the Marina was a huge sheet of water. Many fishermen out at sea managed to return but ?we have no count of those missing?, Durai said.

 The tsunamis bulldozed scores of catamarans and motorised fishing boats and many were swept in as far as the main road. Raja, a fisherman, said the city must have lost 300 to 350 boats.

 ?Each cost me Rs 7 lakh,? cried a boat owner near Tiruvottiyur in north Chennai.

 The huge boulders placed along the northern coast to check erosion ?miraculously saved us?, said Muthamma, ?but nearly 350 of our huts were washed away?.

 Susai Mary was one of several hut dwellers who rushed with their belongings to the nearby narrow Ennore highway. ?I saw the giant wave curling in as I stepped out after my morning prayers in the church,? Mary said. 

 Inside Chennai port, at least seven ships were set aswirl after their anchoring knots got severed. One ship was reportedly tossed around in circles.

 The wreckage of a Maruti car stood forlorn in the middle of the beach. Witnesses said it carried four persons, including two women, who were apparently morning walkers. All were drowned.

 At least 1,000 beachside shops were destroyed, said Prakash, a fisherman. Tents and bamboo poles were all that remained of them.

 At the Royapettah Hospital mortuary lay the body of a jean-clad young woman, apparently a morning walker. Rows of sand-smeared bodies with mouths agape at the mortuaries showed the nasty surprise the tsunamis had sprung on them.

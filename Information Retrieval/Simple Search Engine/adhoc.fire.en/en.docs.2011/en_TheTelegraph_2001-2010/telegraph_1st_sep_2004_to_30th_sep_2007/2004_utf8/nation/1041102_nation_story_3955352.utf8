 Backlash against Gujarat cops in AP

 OUR BUREAU

 Hyderabad/Ahmedabad, Nov. 1: Ten people, including five policemen, were injured in fresh violence in Saidabad in the old city of Hyderabad this afternoon as members of the Dasargah-e-Jehad-e-Shahadat protested against yesterday?s death of an activist in police firing.

 Stone-throwing by Dasargah members today prompted police firing and caning. The spiral of violence had started last evening when Mujahid Islahi Azmi, 26, was killed during a clash between a mob and police.

 The mob had stormed a complex housing the office of the director-general of police, demanding the release of Maulana Naseeruddin, the chief of the Tahreek Tahfuz-e-Shariyat-Islami, who was taken into custody after Ramazan prayers by Gujarat police last evening.

 Naseeruddin, in his sixties, is believed to be one of the main conspirators in the murder of former Gujarat home minister Haren Pandya and the Akshardham attack.

 Gujarat additional police commissioner (crime) D.G. Vanzara claimed that the cleric has been an active Lashkar-e-Toiba operative wanted in connection with several cases in the western state. Although Naseeruddin has never visited Ahmedabad, he and his Dubai-based Hyderabad-born mentor Abu Hamza are believed to have hatched a plan to avenge the post-Godhra carnage. Hamza is thought to be the Lashkar?s ideological brain.

 Naseeruddin, whose presence was demanded at Mujahid?s funeral prayers in Hyderabad today, is on his way to Ahmedabad. But versions on the mode of transport to get him there differed, with Vanzara saying the cleric was being taken by road and would reach tomorrow and Andhra Pradesh police claiming he had been flown out early today by a special flight.

 Hyderabad?s old city was tense when Mujahid?s body was shifted from the corporate Yashoda hospital to the government-run Osmania hospital. Dasargah chief Sheikh Mahbood Ali said the activist?s body would not be shifted for the funeral till the cleric came to offer prayers only to be told he was on his way to Gujarat.

 Additional commissioner of police A.K. Khan, who supervised the movement of the body from the hospital, permitted a funeral procession to appease the angry mob. The processionists began to throw stones at police and the media, forcing the police to retaliate.

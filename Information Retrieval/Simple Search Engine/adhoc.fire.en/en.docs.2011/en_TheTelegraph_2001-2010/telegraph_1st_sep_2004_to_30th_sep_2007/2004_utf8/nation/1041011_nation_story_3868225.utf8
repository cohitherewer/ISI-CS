 Help! Shah Rukh is facing extinction

 - Bangkok meet hope for bears

 Korai (Uttar Pradesh), Oct. 10 (Reuters): His name is Shah Rukh Khan and he can wiggle his hips better than the Bollywood star and strum a guitar almost like a rock star.

 Khan is a shaggy black bear who dances at the roadside on the way to the town of Fatehpur Sikri, near the Taj Mahal, while his handler keeps a tight hold with a coarse rope pierced through the bear?s nose.

 ?We treat him like our child as he supports our family,? says Abdul Nasser, thwacking Khan with a thick stick every so often. ?We value them so much, we even give bears in dowry to our daughters.?

 Just a few years ago, dancing bears or sloth bears ? protected under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) ? were as common as snake charmers with their king cobras.

 On pavements and outside movie theatres, sloth bears entertained crowds by playing imaginary guitars, smoking cigarettes and dancing in the hot sun on their hind legs to the pounding of drums ? all just for a few rupees a day.

 Today, activists say, sloth bears are on the verge of extinction because of increased poaching by an ancient tribe of gypsies known as Kalandhars who use the animals for their shows.

 Wildlife activists hope the current CITES conference in Bangkok will push India to boost efforts to protect the bear and eliminate the factors leading to its extinction.

 ?We give so much importance to the rhino and tiger. But the sloth bear, too, is right there with these animals,? said Geeta Seshamani of Wildlife SOS, an animal rescue group. About 100 bears are poached from forests every year. And the bear population has fallen from some 10,000 in 1997 to about 4,000.?

 Activists say the Kalandhars poach sloth bears as young as two months and then subject them to horrific treatment to force them into submission.

 The Kalandhars ? an ancient Muslim tribe of wrestlers who have been entertaining people with dancing bears since Mughal emperor Akbar?s reign in the 16th century ? wrench out the bears? teeth without anaesthesia and force an iron needle with a coarse rope through their muzzle. Some animals go blind as the rope pulls over their eyes.

 But most Kalandhars say they will never give up the profession of their forefathers. ?If we give up our bears, how will we live? One bear supports a family of about 10,? said Mohammad Muslim, sitting on a jute bed surrounded by dozens of irate villagers from Korai. ?We are poor people with no education and no land either. This bear is our life.?

 Activists say there are about 600 Kalandhar families with about 1,000 bears, and they train them by putting them on a pan over a fire.

 They often castrate the bears with a hot knife. ?Otherwise, their testosterone levels are very high, which makes them very aggressive and difficult to control,? said Kajal Jadav, a vet who treats rescued bears. 

 ?Bears are nocturnal animals that get very lethargic during the day. It?s only the fear of the stick that makes them dance.?

 Many bears die of infection and trauma before their life span of about 25 years, prompting the Kalandhars to poach more.

 In an effort to save the bears from the desperately poor tribe, Wildlife SOS has set up a sanctuary in Uttar Pradesh, caring for about 60 of them.

 Many bears arrive with maggot-infested wounds at the rescue centre, about 20 km from Agra, where they are treated and then kept in a socialisation pen before being released in the fenced sanctuary.

 ?They can?t manage in the wild because they?ve been traumatised after so many years with the Kalandhars and they don?t know the rules of the jungle,? said Jadav, standing near a pen where about six bear cubs were playing.

 Just metres away at the Sur Sarovar Bird Sanctuary, a pack of bears grunt and snort as they tear into papayas scattered across an enclosure. One blind bear thrashes around incessantly.

 But the Kalandhars deny any cruelty.

 In the tiny village of Korai, on the way to a stunning Mughal archway in Fatehpur Sikri, angry Kalandhars shouted that they were being maligned by activists and forest officials, who confiscated their bears, leaving them with no way to make a living.

 ?We?ve lived off them for generations. How can we treat them cruelly?? shouted Shakur, the 75-year-old?s deeply-lined face twisting in anger as he sat outside a cluster of ramshackle mud huts with more chickens and goats around him than bears. ?We give milk to our bears first and then to our children. And the rope is still like the steering of a car. After all, can you drive a car without a steering??

 Dancing bears first shot into the limelight about 15 years ago when authorities confiscated a bear named Munna and moved him to a zoo, sparking widespread outrage among Kalandhars and other street performers, who protested outside Parliament.

 Some Kalandhars in Korai said they were willing to give up their bears if the government gave them compensation of Rs 100,000 and a job to one person from each family.

 Wildlife SOS has convinced about 60 Kalandhars to surrender their bears for Rs 50,000, which they have used to set up cold drink stalls and other small businesses.

 But most Kalandhars say they will never give up the profession of their forefathers. ?If we give up our bears, how will we live? One bear supports a family of about 10,? said Mohammad Muslim, sitting on a jute bed surrounded by dozens of irate villagers from Korai. ?We are poor people with no education and no land either. This bear is our life.?

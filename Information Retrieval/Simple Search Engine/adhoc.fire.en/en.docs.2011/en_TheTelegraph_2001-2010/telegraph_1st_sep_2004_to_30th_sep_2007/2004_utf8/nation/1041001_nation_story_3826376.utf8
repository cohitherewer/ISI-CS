 Trafficking cloud on Telgi

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 30: Preliminary investigations following yesterday?s nationwide raids by the CBI indicate the involvement of fake stamp paper scam mastermind Abdul Karim Telgi and a foreigner employed at a European embassy in human trafficking.

 Telgi, who was booked yesterday for procuring a second passport from Mumbai on the basis of forged documents, has also been accused of running a visa racket from his Delhi office in the mid-nineties.

 The embassy employee is believed to be involved in a human-trafficking racket run by Punjab-based travel agents.

 A case has also been registered against unknown officials of Delhi police and the foreign ministry for their involvement in Afghan nationals obtaining Indian passports on the basis of forged documents, CBI spokesman G. Mohanty said. The exact magnitude of the racket is being ascertained, he said.

 The bureau said the role of the foreigner employed in a Delhi mission had come to light after some people, who had been illegally sent abroad on payment of lakhs, were deported to India as their papers were not in order. Searches at the offices of some Punjab-based travel agents resulted in the seizure of passports, used and unused air tickets and passport application forms.

 Mohanty said the special drive had brought to light the involvement of 230 people, including 88 government officials, in 65 cases. A dozen cases were registered against officials of regional passport offices and the immigration department. However, the maximum number of cases ? 15 ? related to officers of the central excise, customs and income-tax departments.

 Tea hope for Alzheimer?s

 ROGER HIGHFIELD

London, Oct. 26: Drinking regular cups of tea 

may help prevent Alzheimer?s disease, a study has found. 

 Both green and black tea have similar effects to drugs developed to combat the development and progression of the disease and tests have shown that they have the potential to boost and enhance memory by inhibiting the activity of certain enzymes in the brain.

 The findings, published in Phytotherapy Research, may lead to the development of a ?super cuppa? to help combat Alzheimer?s and, according to other work, cancer and heart disease, too.

 Since preliminary evidence suggests that it would be necessary to drink about 10 cups a day to enjoy the full benefits, the aim is to develop a more concentrated brew of the active ingredients, said Ed Okello of the University of Newcastle Upon Tyne.

 Ideally, the super tea would be derived from the black (fermented) variety since a straw poll of his colleagues suggests that the more promising unfermented green tea is less popular.

 With colleagues at the university?s Medicinal Plant Research Centre, Okello investigated the properties of coffee and green and black teas. 

 Both teas inhibited the activity of enzymes associated with the development of Alzheimer?s.

 The teas inhibited the activity of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE), which breaks down the chemical messenger, or neurotransmitter, acetylcholine. Alzheimer?s is characterised by a drop in acetylcholine and current drugs act to prevent this.

 Green tea and black tea also hinder the activity of the enzyme butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), which has been discovered in protein deposits found on the brain of patients with Alzheimer?s. 

 Green tea went one step further in that it obstructed the activity of beta-secretase, which plays a role in the production of the protein deposits.

 Clive Ballard, of the Alzheimer?s Society, said: ?This builds on previous evidence that suggests that green tea may be beneficial?.

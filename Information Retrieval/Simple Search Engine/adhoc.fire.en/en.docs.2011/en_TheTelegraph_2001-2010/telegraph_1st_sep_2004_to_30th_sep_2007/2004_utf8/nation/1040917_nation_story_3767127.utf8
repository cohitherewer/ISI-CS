 Gaur lines up loyalty show

 RASHEED KIDWAI

 Bhopal, Sept. 16: Uma Bharti?s ongoing tiranga yatra has been given virtual official status in Madhya Pradesh as her chief ministerial successor is eager to put his loyalty on display.

 Babulal Gaur has gone to the extent of assigning state ministers charge of various regions to mobilise crowd for Uma?s rallies in the state.

 But his blatant show of loyalty seems to be having little impact on the former chief minister and her supporters. They are pushing for former Union minister Prahlad Patel?s nomination as the BJP candidate for the Nohta Assembly by-election.

 Patel?s presence in state politics is bad news in Gaur?s scheme of things as he would be pitted against a powerful regional satrap who could emerge as a rallying point for Uma supporters.

 Gaur discussed yatra preparations at a cabinet meeting today asking his colleagues to ensure a good turnout in Burhanpur, bordering Maharashtra, where Uma will hold a rally late tomorrow evening on entering Madhya Pradesh.

 Ministers holding charge of various departments and state-run corporations have been asked to give newspaper advertisements welcoming the yatra.

 Uma will also hold a public meeting here on Saturday, which might be addressed by BJP chief M. Venkaiah Naidu and NDA convener George Fernandes. Gaur and his party are hoping to mobilise over 100,000 people for the meeting.

 For Uma, too, the success of the Bhopal meeting is important. It would establish her supremacy in her home state and perhaps cover up for the modest turnouts in Maharashtra, where the local BJP virtually distanced itself from the yatra.

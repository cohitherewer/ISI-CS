 Ban heat on birth-control shots

 AYSWARIA VENUGOPAL

 New Delhi, Nov. 1: Women?s organisations and health groups have demanded a ban on the use of hormonal injection contraceptives like Depo Provera and NET-EN in government hospitals, claiming that they are considered hazardous to women?s health.

 In a memorandum, 62 women?s groups, health groups and individuals across the country have urged Union health minister Anbumani Ramadoss to consider scientific independent scientific research which suggests such contraceptives are not safe for women.

 The memorandum pointed out that the risk far outweighs the benefits of convenience of administration and use. The activists opposed any move by the Union health ministry to include the controversial contraceptives in its family planning programme.

 The activists were reacting to a workshop conducted at Manesar in Haryana last week by a national-level NGO, Parivar Seva Sanstha. The workshop, on expanding choices of contraception by introducing the use of hormonal contraceptives which can be injected, was organised in collaboration with the Centre, the United Nations Population Fund and the Packard Foundation through the Population Foundation of India.

 The memorandum stated: ?The public health system is particularly ill-equipped to administer injectables and NGOs and practitioners are currently out of the ambit of practically all mechanisms of accountability. This scenario is not conducive to entry of injectables. We do not believe that women?s choices are enhanced by adding yet another hazardous contraceptive to the basket.?

 The activists allege that Parivar Seva Sanstha is engaged in social marketing of Depo Provera as a contraceptive among women even though scientific studies have pointed to its hazardous nature. According to Laxmi Murthy of a women?s group, Saheli, the workshop was being organised to lay a roadmap for the use of such contraceptives, which included Depo Provera and NET-EN. 

 Activists have been waging a war against the inclusion of these contraceptives in the government?s family planning programme. In a case filed by Saheli and other women?s groups against the use of NET-EN, the Supreme Court had said ?the government?s admission that mass use of NET-EN in the family planning programme is not advisable is a recognition of the potential risks and need for close monitoring and follow-up?.

 ?Our first demand is to clearly stop the use of injectables in government hospitals. Though these are not part of the family planning programme, the government hospitals are already promoting injectables and government doctors are promoting contraceptives by private companies that have not been cleared by the ministry of health and family welfare,? said Brinda Karat, the general secretary of the All India Democratic Women?s Association. ?Indian women are being used as guinea pigs for drug trials, including contraception,? she added.

 Karat alleged that ?there is an effort in certain circles of the bureaucracy backed by certain sections in the government? to use coercive methods of population control, oblivious to health concerns of women. Erosion of the drug controller?s office had ensured that there is absolutely no monitoring even in the case of over-the-counter sales.

 Depo Provera was approved for marketing in India in 1993 though it had not undergone all the mandatory trials. It was introduced pending a post-marketing surveillance study.

 ?The fact that Depo Provera, which ordinarily costs Rs 150, is being provided to women at a nominal value of Rs 20 to 30, speaks volumes about the kind of commercial interest involved. While the US market for Depo Provera stands at around 1 million users, there are an estimated 40 million potential users of these contraceptives in India ? a market larger that the population of Switzerland, Norway, Sweden and Australia put together,? says Sarojini .B. of Sama, a group working on women and health issues.

 Last year, Sama had released a report on a study involving 167 women who were administered Depo Provera between October 1999 and June 2000. The study found that the women, who were inhabitants of resettlement colonies, had been given the contraceptives by a hospital in Delhi, which received the vials directly from the pharmaceutical company marketing the contraceptive.

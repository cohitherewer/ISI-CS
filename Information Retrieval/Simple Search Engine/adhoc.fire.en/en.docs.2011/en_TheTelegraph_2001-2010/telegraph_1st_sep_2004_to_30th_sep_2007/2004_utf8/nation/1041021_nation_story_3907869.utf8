 No clues in Sonia riddle

 KAY BENEDICT

 New Delhi, Oct. 20: An inquiry by the Lok Sabha Secretariat has failed to shed light on who placed Sonia Gandhi?s portrait on the wall of the Speaker?s Hall on Friday.

 Only four portraits adorn the hall in the Constitution Club here: Rajendra Prasad, B.R. Ambedkar, the incumbent President and the Prime Minister.

 On October 15, NDA convener George Fernandes had objected to Sonia?s photo, saying that only portraits of constitutional heads could be placed in the club. Sonia, he pointed out, was the ruling United Progressive Alliance?s chairperson, which was not a constitutional post. 

 The Congress had said it did not authorise anyone to place its chief?s photo there.

 Club sources said her photo was placed next to those of the first President and Ambedkar, contrary to earlier claims that the latter?s portrait had been shifted to another wall to make way for Sonia?s.

 Her portrait is now lying with the club caretaker; nobody has come to claim it. AICC sources said the party has nothing to do with the incident.

 ?We are not bothered how it (portrait) reached there. What pains us is his (Fernandes) negative mindset,? AICC secretary in charge of media Tom Vadakan said. 

 ?If he wants to tear all posters of (Sonia) Gandhi, he is welcome to do so but he cannot remove the image of Gandhi from the heart of people,? he added.

 Last week, Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee, who was in Calcutta at the time of the incident, had ordered an inquiry as the club comes under his office?s jurisdiction. He had said on Friday ?it is all unauthorised?.

 But the mystery remains unsolved. The club caretaker was unable to recall anybody bringing the photo into the hall. 

 The only possibility, club sources said, could be that some overenthusiastic Congress supporter brought it in during a recent function on Feroze Gandhi?s birth anniversary or some Dal (U) workers could have smuggled it in to make mischief.

 The Dal (U) had hired the Constitution Club premises for a two-day convention on the restoration of democracy in Myanmar.

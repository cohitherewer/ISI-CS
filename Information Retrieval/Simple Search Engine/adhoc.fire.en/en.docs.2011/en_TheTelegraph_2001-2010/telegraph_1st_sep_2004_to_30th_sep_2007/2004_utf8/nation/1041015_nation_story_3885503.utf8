 Upbeat Sena picks CM nominee

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi/Mumbai, Oct. 14: The BJP-Shiv Sena is unfazed by the Maharashtra exit polls, most of which give a thin edge to the rival Congress-Nationalist Congress Party combine.

 The BJP-Sena alliance is instead considering the shape of things to come after Saturday when the Assembly poll results will be declared.

 BJP sources said the Sena?s Subhash Desai will be made chief minister if the alliance reaches the halfway mark or falls just short. They said Desai, who contested from Goregaon in suburban Mumbai, is the choice of Sena chief Bal Thackeray.

 Even though Thackeray?s son Uddhav is the ?natural? choice for chief minister, the party chief feels he is a political greenhorn and needs ?proper grooming? in governance and legislature before he is considered for the top job. Uddhav was a photographer before plunging into politics.

 With Desai as chief minister, Thackeray would have time to work on his nephew Raj, who has staked a claim for the top chair, as well as daughter-in-law Smita, who is reportedly against brother-in-law Uddhav, holding him responsible for her estrangement with the Sena patriarch.

 Desai has been an MLA just once and was disqualified along with Thackeray under the Representation of the People Act for using religion to canvass for votes. But sources say he enjoys the Sena chief?s confidence and as party general secretary, is involved in decision-making.

 BJP sources in the capital said the verdict will be ?decisive? regardless of which combine it favours. Dismissing the exit polls, Sena spokesman Kiran Wadivekar said: ?There are various factors. The higher voter turnout this time as against the Lok Sabha elections will go in our favour.?

 The party?s own assessment is that the alliance will win 140 seats ? five short of a majority ? because the ?anti-incumbency? sentiment and presence of rebels will hurt the Congress-NCP.

 BJP sources say their leaders are not in touch with the rebels or the Bahujan Samaj Party and the Samajwadi Party, which are expected to win a few seats. ?The moment they see one of the combinations racing ahead, they themselves will come to them,? a BJP functionary said. ?Neither money nor muscle power or the use of coercive tactics work in Maharashtra because the rebels and Independents (are) themselves worth several crores of rupees. A blandishment of one or two crores will not entice them,? he said.

 The combine is instead worried that these MLAs will expect to become ministers in return for their support. With the ceiling set at 43 ministers in line with the new legislation on downsizing of cabinets, both coalitions will find it difficult to accommodate rebels and Independents.

 The BJP-Sena has been boosted by the feedback that the Congress-NCP combine is in deep trouble in Vidarbha, Marathwada and north Maharashtra, which account for 150 out of 288 seats.

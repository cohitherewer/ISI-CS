The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 Winter date for BCCI tug-of-war

 R. VENKATARAMAN

 New Delhi, Oct. 27: The Supreme Court today fixed November 30 for the final hearing in the dispute over the recently held cricket board elections in which Nationalist Congress Party leader Sharad Pawar was defeated after outgoing president Jagmohan Dalmiya used his ?casting vote?.

 A bench headed by Justice . Santosh Hegde fixed the date after the senior counsel for the Board of Control for Cricket in India, K.K. Venugopal, and Harish Salve for the Netaji Cricket Club ?mentioned? the issue today.

 On October 11, the court had stayed the appointment of retired Justice S. Mohan as an interim administrator of the cricket board but made it clear that it would order fresh elections ?if need be?.

 A division bench of Justices Hegde and S.B. Sinha had said in an interim order that the ?Madras High Court order is stayed to the extent of appointment of administrator? and permitted the board to file a special leave petition.

 ?Normally, even if rigging had taken place in any election, we do not restrain the newly elected body but after hearing this petition we may order fresh elections,? Justice Hegde had observed when Salve listed a series of irregularities by ?Jagmohan Dalmiya and others? to ?rig? the elections at the annual general body meeting of the BCCI in Calcutta.

 The apex court had said that the election or appointment of Dalmiya as patron-in-chief was also stayed. This order is valid till November 30 when the matter will be taken up for final hearing.

 The bench had fixed October 26 for final hearing after hearing the BCCI, NCC, Maharashtra Cricket Association (MCA) and the Delhi District Cricket Association (DDCA). But the matter could not be taken up for two consecutive days. Venugopal and Salve had to mention the matter when the court was about to rise for the day.

 Salve had argued that Dalmiya disqualified the MCA and the Rajasthan Cricket Association and allowed the DDCA to vote and had cast his ?casting vote? to decide the outcome of the elections.

 In season of bahus, Gursharan steps out

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Gursharan: Party time

 New Delhi, Dec. 15: Bahus are in the news this season as the Prime Minister?s wife gets ready to step out of his shadow and reach out to his colleagues? wives.

 After the country?s best known ?bahu?, Smriti Z. Irani, made news of the political kind, Gursharan Kaur will strictly play hostess to revive the ?neglected? social role of a Prime Minister?s better half.

 Manmohan Singh?s wife will host a lunch for the wives of his council of ministers at their official home at 7 Race Course Road on December 20. It will be strictly out of bounds for the men. But woman ministers Renuka Chowdhury, Kanti Singh, Meira Kumar, Suryakanta Patil and Kumari Selja will be there.

 Congress chief Sonia Gandhi and the wives of Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee and Rajya Sabha chairman Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, too, have been invited.

 Sonia herself is hosting a dinner tonight for Congress MPs and their spouses and another tomorrow for UPA MPs and spouses.

 Gursharan Kaur?s friend Ishar Judge Ahluwalia, the wife of Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia, and Delhi chief minister Sheila Dixit are the other special invitees.

 This is the first time in over a decade that a prime ministerial spouse will host a social occasion at the official residence. 

 An aide of Singh said the luncheon was an attempt to revive the ?neglected? social role of a Prime Minister?s better half.

 Gursharan Kaur, who accompanies Singh on his overseas and domestic trips, thought of the women?s day out when she attended the wedding of a cabinet minister?s son recently and discovered she did not know the wives of her husband?s colleagues.

 After Rajiv Gandhi?s stint as Prime Minister, the occupants of 7 Race Course Road were either without a spouse or had wives who kept a low profile.

 Sita, the wife of V.P. Singh, Rajiv?s immediate successor, was rarely in the spotlight and was known to move around without security or an entourage.

 Then came P.V. Narasimha Rao, a widower. H.D. Deve Gowda?s wife did not move to the capital and continued to live in Bangalore with her extended family.

 I.K. Gujral?s wife Sheila was noticed on a couple of occasions, such as when she released a book of her poems.

 Atal Bihari Vajpayee was single. His foster family largely stayed out of public glare after his foster son-in-law fell foul of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and was openly attacked by its leaders.

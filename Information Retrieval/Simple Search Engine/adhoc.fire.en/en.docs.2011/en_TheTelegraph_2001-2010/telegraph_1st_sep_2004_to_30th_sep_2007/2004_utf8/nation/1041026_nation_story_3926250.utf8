 Governor row

 New Delhi, Oct. 25: In a setback to the Tamil Nadu government, the Supreme Court today declined to issue an interim order restraining the Centre from replacing the governor, reports our legal correspondent.

 However, a division bench of Chief Justice R.C. Lahoti and Justice G.P. Mathur admitted for hearing the state government?s petition along with a PIL challenging the removal of governors at the ?whims and fancies? of the Centre. 

 There have been allegations that the Tamil Nadu governor is being shifted under pressure from the DMK, a partner in the United Progressive Alliance at the Centre.

 With the axe falling on the Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Goa and Gujarat governors, the shifting of the Tamil Nadu governor has been considered a matter of time. There have been allegations that the Tamil Nadu governor is being shifted under pressure from the DMK, a partner in the United Progressive Alliance at the Centre.

 BJP legislator B.P. Singhal, the brother of the VHP?s international working president Ashok Singhal, filed a PIL challenging the constitutional validity of the removal and shifting of governors, the ADMK joined the issue with a petition of its own that went a step further. The Jayalalithaa government sought an interim order from the court restraining the Centre from removing, changing or shifting the Tamil Nadu governor till disposal of the case. x

 The court, while issuing notices to the Centre during the last hearing, had observed: ?The PIL filed in this regard raises an important public issue involving interpretation of article 156 of the Constitution? (appointment of governors who remain in office during the ?pleasure? of the President). 

 Singhal?s PIL contended that the President ?could not have dismissed? the governors of Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana and Goa on the advice of the Union government ?disregarding? the constitutional provision mandating a five-year tenure for governors.

 In this context, the petition said the President was ?not bound? by the advice of the council of ministers headed by the Prime Minister if a cabinet decision or resolution was ?contrary to the provisions of the Constitution?.

 Health check for Pandits in camps

Jammu: Regular medical check-up for Kashmiri Pandit migrants 

living in camps in Jammu and Kashmir has been made mandatory, reports our correspondent.

 The decision was taken at a meeting on Friday following a three-day visit of an inter-ministerial team from the Centre. The team, led by Planning Commission adviser Sushma Choudhary, had expressed concern about the deteriorating health of the migrants living in the camps.

 The Jammu and Kashmir government will depute a special team of doctors and paramedical staff to conduct medical examination of the camp inmates who number about 2,00,000. At least 1,50,000 Kashmiri Pandits live in their own houses or rented accommodation.

 Most of the camp inmates are suffering from stress-related diseases like high blood pressure and diabetes and also from tuberculosis. The visiting team took serious note of the absence of proper diagnosis and medical care, because of which their condition was deteriorating.

 State revenue and relief and rehabilitation minister Hakim Mohammad Yaseen, whose department looks after the camps, said it was a ?moral duty of the government? to provide proper healthcare to the migrants.

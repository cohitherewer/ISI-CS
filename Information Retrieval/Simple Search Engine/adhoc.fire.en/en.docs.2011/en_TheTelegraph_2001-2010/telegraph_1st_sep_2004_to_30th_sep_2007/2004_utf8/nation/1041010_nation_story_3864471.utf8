 Cong springs Singh campaign surprise

 K. SUBRAHMANYA

 Manmohan Singh

 Aurangabad, Oct. 9: With two days to go before campaigning ends in Maharashtra, the Congress has, in a surprise move, deployed Manmohan Singh to canvass in areas where the rival Shiv Sena-BJP combine is thought to be well-placed.

 Singh will address three meetings tomorrow: in north Maharashtra?s tribal Dhule district, in Akola, Vidarbha and Nanded in Marathwada.

 Nanded has a Sikh pilgrimage centre and Singh?s visit there is significant in the light of the furore caused by BJP poll manager Pramod Mahajan?s recent statement that Sikhs should vote for the Sena-BJP alliance. It is hoped that Singh will be able to woo Sikh voters with the Congress suddenly shaky about its prospects in Mumbai, which sends 36 MLAs to the 288-member Assembly.

 When the Prime Minister visited India?s financial capital last Wednesday his appearance was restricted to a news conference and interaction with the city?s business leaders. 

 The party?s campaign managers did not envisage a role for Singh beyond Mumbai and possibly, Nagpur, Pune and Aurangabad. The idea was to consolidate the Congress? perceived hold over Mumbai?s voters who voted overwhelmingly for the party in May?s Lok Sabha elections.

 But the Congress has changed its strategy last-minute apparently after an ?internal assessment? that the battle for Mumbai might not be as one-sided as it was in May. 

 The party reckons that even a minor recovery by the Sena-BJP alliance in the state capital could make it difficult for the Congress-Nationalist Congress Party combine to reach the 145 seat-mark in the Assembly.

 The focus has thus shifted to north Maharashtra, Vidarbha and Marathwada where the Sena-BJP hopes to make up for the seats that will fail to come its way in the ruling combine?s west Maharashtra bastion. 

 The Congress-NCP alliance fared badly in May in the three regions which account for 114 seats. A large number of Dalits and tribals live in these relatively backward areas.

 There have been a number of farmer suicides and malnutrition deaths in Vidarbha and north Maharashtra in recent years, thus putting the ruling alliance on the defensive.

 The challenge has become tougher still as Mayavati?s Bahujan Samaj Party is seeking to dent the Congress? traditional support base among Dalits.

 Kerala care for aged

 JOHN MARY

 Thiruvananthapuram, Nov. 28: The Kerala government plans to adopt a carrot-and-stick policy, including prosecution of children who neglect their elderly parents, to ensure better care of the aged.

 The secretary for social welfare, Lida Jacob, said the prosecution provision was quite new, though the policy draft is in line with the national policy. The draft had been sent to various organisations, seeking their comments by November 30.

 The thrust of the policy is on the poor and the rural population.

 The draft legislation, to be finalised by the year-end, says children who take care of their parents will be eligible for concessions on water and power tariffs, besides other state tax benefits.

 The financial capacity of children will be a criterion for fixing their responsibilities and both sons and daughters will be equally responsible for the welfare of their parents.

 The government will extend support to those elderly people who have no children and those below the poverty line will get free rations and health insurance cover.

 The policy also provides for special access to public transport and in public places for the physically challenged. While the physically challenged of all ages currently enjoy concessional travel in proportion to the extent of disability, the new policy provides for fare concession even to those who escort the physically challenged.

 The government will strive to provide jobs such as kindergarten teaching to those who have retired from service. 

 Private hospitals will reserve a minimum 10 per cent of the total bed capacity for geriatric care.

 Senior citizens will get multipurpose identity cards containing personal details, including their medical histories. Free check-ups, periodic clinical care and provision of hearing and visual aids are also part of the package. 

 Government hospital staff will get special training in geriatric care and hospitals will be equipped to meet the challenges.

 Special police will function under district administrations to protect the elderly against domestic violence.

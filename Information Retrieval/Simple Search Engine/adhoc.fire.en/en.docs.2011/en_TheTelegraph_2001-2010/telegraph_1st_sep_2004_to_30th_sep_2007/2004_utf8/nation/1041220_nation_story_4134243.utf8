 Helipad raises green fear

 DEBABRATA MOHANTY

 Bhubaneswar, Dec. 19: Wildlife activists in Orissa have expressed their reservations against the construction of a helipad in Bhitarkanika wildlife sanctuary of Kendrapada district for the visit of the Vice-President in January.

 Vice-President Bhairon Singh Shekhawat is scheduled to visit the sanctuary on January 6. While the final itinerary is yet to be finalised, it has been decided to use a helicopter for Shekhawat?s convenience. 

 The district administration has given its consent to the construction of a helipad at Khola, which is located in the sanctuary. 

 Wildlife activists feel the movement of helicopters will upset the tranquillity of the sanctuary. 

 Bhitarkanika is home to the largest population of giant salt-water crocodiles in India. It is also the second largest viable mangrove eco-system in India. ?The helipad falls inside the Bhitarkanika sanctuary. The rules stipulate that there cannot be any construction within 10 km of the sanctuary unless the environment ministry permits it. Besides, an impact assessment study has to be conducted,? said Biswajit Mohanty, secretary of the Wildlife Society of Orissa. 

 Mohanty said the helicopter landing at Khola creek would adversely affect the crocodiles and there could be none left for Shekhawat to see.

 However, chief wildlife warden of Orissa Suresh Mohanty said the helipad does not fall inside the sanctuary. ?We can always allow the construction of a helipad for someone like the Vice-President. The helipad will be a temporary one,? he said. 

 Mohanty added that the environment and forests department might allow the armed guards of Shekhawat to move freely if the need arose. Firearms are not allowed inside the sanctuary areas under the Wildlife Act.

 BJP backs Sinha slur on PM

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 6: The BJP today sprang to the defence of former minister Yashwant Sinha who has refused to apologise for calling Prime Minister Manmohan Singh Shikhandi.

 Party spokesperson Arun Jaitley said: We have always believed that the language of politics has to be appropriate, but there should be no double standards. He was hinting at Laloo Prasad Yadavs reportedly derogatory references to .K. Advani and Samajwadi Party general secretary Amar Singh as well as the allegedly derisive language used by Priya Ranjan Das Munshi and Janardhan Poojary against Atal Bihari Vajpayee.

 Sinha, who was in Calcutta today, said: I made the statement while courting arrest in Bangalore in support of Uma Bharti. I had to speak the truth. Why should I apologise? There is no question of any apology. 

 He added that recent actions by the government and its constituents were in poor taste. 

 Sinha displayed a newspaper clipping of a Karnataka PCC advertisement deriding Uma and bearing the photographs of Singh, Congress chief Sonia Gandhi and the late Rajiv Gandhi.

 All the allegations in it were lies and set aside by the Hubli court. Did the Prime Minister say he was not a party to it? After this, the Prime Minister should have dissociated himself from the advertisement, Sinha said.

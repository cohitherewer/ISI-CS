 Speaker ends impasse

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Dec. 9: Orissa 

 Assembly Speaker Maheswar Mohanty permitted a discussion 

 on the Tangarpada mining issue but with a rider.

 Mohanty asked the Opposition members to refrain from commenting on the high court judgment while discussing the issue in the House.

 Earlier, deputy Speaker Prahllad Dora had to suspend question hour and adjourn the House for an hour. When it reassembled, the Speaker allowed the members to discuss the mining issue.

 However, nothing new emerged from the discussion as both the Opposition and the ruling BJD-BJP combine stuck to their earlier stand.

 Welcoming the Speaker?s move, chief minister Naveen Patnaik said, ?I have consistently maintained that we should have a discussion on this matter so that the air is cleared on the allegations.? 

 A section of politicians, besides the public, believe that the legislators have sacrificed the sanctity and tradition of the Assembly. ?I have been stunned by the failure of parliamentary democracy. I just think of the hapless voters who have elected these representatives,? said BJP legislator Pratap Sarangi. 

 He suggested that members who cause disruptions in the House should not get their daily allowance. ?The MLAs should not be paid if they stall proceedings,? Sarangi said.

Tremors

 Baby born on ship

Port Blair, Dec. 30 (PTI): A woman being evacuated by a naval 

ship from Hut Bay in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands yesterday gave birth to a 

healthy girl on-board.

 According to the ship?s doctor, the woman felt labour pains at 5 pm yesterday. ?I took her down to my cabin where she gave birth to a healthy girl at 7.55 pm,? he said. Both mother and baby are fine.

 Fauna safe

Point Calimere (PTI): The Point Calimere wildlife and bird 

sanctuary in Tamil Nadu, which houses several deer and painted storks, escaped 

devastation because of the surrounding mangrove forests. Forest officials had 

gone into the sanctuary spread over 25 sq. km to assess the damage but found the 

mangrove plantation had helped minimise the damage.

 Queen aid

London (AFP): Queen Elizabeth has made a ?substantial? donation 

for victims of the tsunami disaster in Asia. The money would most likely be given 

to British charities with which the monarch is already associated as a patron, 

a Buckingham Palace spokesperson said on Wednesday.

 Annan effort

United Nations (AFP): United Nations secretary-general Kofi 

Annan has cut short his vacation and is due to return to New York to oversee humanitarian 

efforts for affected countries. He will hold a meeting with the UN deputy chief 

for humanitarian affairs, Jan Egeland, who is coordinating the world body?s action 

on the crisis, a spokesperson said.

 US advice

Washington (Reuters): The US state department on Wednesday 

urged Americans in tsunami-affected countries to call home, even if they are far 

from the disaster areas. ?This is a time when people who know they?re hundreds 

of miles away from where the disaster might have occurred need to call home and 

tell their relatives who know it?s only a quarter-inch on the map,? said the state 

department?s spokesperson, Richard Boucher.

 Satellite help

Washington (AP): The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency 

of the US is using its spy satellites to measure the scope of the devastating 

tsunamis in Asia and help relief workers manage their efforts.

 Vulgar e-mails swamp student IDs

 DEBABRATA MOHANTY

 Bhubaneswar, Dec. 16: Sleaze 

 MMS in DPS, obscene e-mails in a premier management institute 

 here ? the saga continues.

 Students and staff members of Xavier Institute of Management, Bhubaneswar (XIMB), have allegedly been receiving obscene e-mails from unknown senders for about a month. 

 Initially, the recipients ? students, teachers and administrative staff members ? ignored the e-mails, as they felt the objectionable text material was nothing but unsolicited mail or spam.

 But the e-mails kept coming, which made the authorities sit up and approach the police to put an end to the menace. They lodged an FIR with Chandrashekharpur police earlier this week.

 XIMB administrator Satya Sekhar Rath said anonymous senders were up to some ?purposeful mischief? since all the students and staff members were targeted. 

 Khurda superintendent of police Amitav Thakur said the matter has been referred to the cyber crime cell, which operates from the office of the deputy inspector-general (computers) in the city.

 The XIMB authorities are worried over the presence of hackers on the Internet in the wake of the controversy. XIMB uses a number of software solutions like Examination Online and Internet Survey and hackers can wreak havoc if they manage to access them.

 After the complaint was lodged, Chandrashekharpur police requested the State Crime Records Bureau to investigate the matter. Since the state police do not have the required expertise, SCRB has been designated as the cyber crime cell.

 Last month, two persons were arrested after they hacked into the account of customers of a private bank and illegally transferred Rs 1.43 lakh through Internet banking. The arrested duo managed to access confidential information, which helped them manipulate the accounts.

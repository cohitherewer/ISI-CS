 Jogi jitters for Shukla

 K. SUBRAHMANYA

 New Delhi, Sept. 9: Ajit Jogi may not be back on his feet yet, but he is certainly back in reckoning.

 The former Chhattisgarh chief minister, still wheelchair bound after a road accident last April, was yesterday appointed chairman of an All India Congress Committee panel to shortlist candidates for the Assembly elections in Arunachal Pradesh next month.

 Party chief Sonia Gandhi?s move signalled Jogi?s full rehabilitation in the Congress after his stock hit rock bottom last December when the high command suspended the defeated chief minister for an alleged attempt to win over six BJP MLAs by bribing them.

 Normally, such organisational responsibilities are given to full working committee members, which Jogi is not.

 Sonia?s move is being seen as a setback to Jogi?s arch rival in Chhattisgarh, V.C. Shukla, who was planning an early return to the Congress.

 Jogi can barely stand on his feet. A few days ago he had said that on a physical fitness scale of 5, he would get just one. But that seems to have been enough to put a spoke in Shukla?s rush to re-enter the party. Even before Sonia reposed trust in him yesterday, Jogi was on the job to counter Shukla?s plans.

 Sources said Jogi, from his hospital bed in the national capital, managed to slow down Shukla?s moves to leave the BJP, which he had joined on the eve of the parliamentary elections earlier this year. Shukla had hoped for a breakthrough in his efforts to rejoin the Congress last weekend and even promised to make an announcement in this regard at Raipur.

 Left to himself, Jogi ? who from his hospital bed in Mumbai last April defeated Shukla in their Lok Sabha poll battle in Shukla?s home turf Mahasamund ? would not even give an opening to his rival to return to the Congress.

 But, with only his cellphone to help him as he is still immobile physically, Jogi has to put in extra efforts to convince his friends in the central leadership against paving the way for Shukla?s return. More so because party treasurer Motilal Vora, who also heads the state Congress unit, would not mind pitting one rival against the other. Vora, apparently, has not been averse to helping Shukla?s cause.

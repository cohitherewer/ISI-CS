 Left lines up patents note

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 21: The United Progressive Alliance government and its outside allies, the Left, are waging a ?war of notes?.

 The Left is now preparing a note on the patents amendment bill after it has submitted two notes to the Congress-led Centre against increasing foreign direct investment (FDI) in telecommunication and insurance.

 ?We have asked the government not to increase prices of drugs and to protect the Indian pharmaceutical industry,? CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan said after leaders of four Left parties met the group of ministers on the patents bill for two hours today.

 The group is headed by defence minister Pranab Mukherjee and includes commerce and industry minister Kamal Nath and science and technology minister Kapil Sibal.

 They heard out the Left leaders and asked them to give their suggestions in a note.

 ?The Left leaders,? Kamal Nath said after the meeting, ?had some apprehensions about price rise of pharma products. We assured (them) that there were adequate safeguards to prevent such a situation. They will give us a detailed note on their suggestions in the next two days.?

 The bill, he added, will be introduced in Parliament?s winter session, beginning December 1.

 The Left had earlier outlined its objections to increasing FDI in telecom and insurance in a note to Union finance minister P. Chidambaram. He then submitted a note to the Left rebutting its arguments. The Left replied with a second note.

 The discourse on the patents bill ? part of World Trade Organisation agreements to globalise drug prices ? could be headed in a similar direction.

 Left leaders, however, have dropped their earlier demand of referring the bill to a parliamentary select committee.

 The Left is also gearing up for its coordination committee meeting with the UPA scheduled on Tuesday. Bardhan said the increase in diesel and LPG prices tops the Left?s list of priorities.

 Unhappy with the slash in petrol prices earlier this week, Left leaders want the Centre to also roll back the hike in diesel and LPG prices.

 Another issue the Left will raise at the coordination meeting is the government?s decision to set up a pension fund that will be controlled by private agencies. CPM and CPI leaders have said they are opposed to private management of pension funds.

 The Left will also raise the much-debated issue of FDI in telecom and insurance. The leaders say they will continue to stick to their stand of opposing FDI hike. The Left maintains that Chidambaram?s note arguing for an increase has several crucial factual errors.

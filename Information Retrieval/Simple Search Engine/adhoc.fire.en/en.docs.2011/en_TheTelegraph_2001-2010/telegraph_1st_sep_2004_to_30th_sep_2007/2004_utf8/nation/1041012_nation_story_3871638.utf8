 Bangla ?camps? on Left radar

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 11: The Left parties will ask the government to talk to Bangladesh foreign minister Morshed Khan if he visits Delhi to ask him to put an end to terrorist camps operating in his country.

 ?We know Bangladesh has become a haven for terrorists operating in the Northeast,? said CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan after leaders of the four Left parties met this evening to discuss tomorrow?s agenda for the United Progressive Alliance-Left co-ordination committee meeting.

 Bardhan explained that tomorrow?s meeting will focus on political issues, the Northeast and Jammu and Kashmir.

 The Centre is not satisfied with Dhaka?s response to repeated alerts about terrorist camps of northeastern insurgents in Bangladesh. Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had earlier met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and expressed apprehension about the growing threat from these camps.

 Left leaders are not satisfied with the government?s handling of Jammu and Kashmir and the Northeast and expect to do some plain talking with the government ? particularly Union home minister Shivraj Patil. ?We expect the home minister to give us a report on the Northeast situation,? said Bardhan. ?The government does not have a policy on Jammu and Kashmir,? said the CPI leader.

 Patil has not been a favourite with the Left since his handling of the Manipur crisis triggered by the July death of Thangjam Manorama after she was taken into custody by the Assam Rifles. 

 The home minister?s trip to Manipur came too late and the Left blamed the Congress-led government for allowing the Manipur situation to get out of hand.

 The recent bomb blasts in Nagaland and Assam have reinforced the Left?s apprehensions about the government?s handling of this region. Left leaders patted the Prime Minister on the back after he returned from his trip to the US and the UK, but want the government to take greater initiative in improving the situation in Jammu and Kashmir.

 The focus of the Left?s interaction with the government ? at least for the time being ? seems to be shifting. Contentious issues such as the cap on foreign direct investment, the provident fund rate, and the exim policy are not on tomorrow?s agenda.

 ?We are waiting for the government to submit a note in reply to our concerns on the FDI issue,? said Bardhan, adding that the differences regarding the Planning Commission have been sorted out. 

 Indians arrested

 Bangladesh Rifles today arrested 18 Indian nationals for allegedly possessing weapons in Habiganj district near the border.

 The arrest came during a six-hour raid on a slum, police said, adding that the Indians, hailing from Tripura, had illegally crossed over to Bangladesh and were carrying arms and ammunition.

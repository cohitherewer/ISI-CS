 Laloo no-show in orphan protest show

 FARHANA KALAM

 Gaya, Dec. 15: The banners and protest messages were ready but the ?big man? himself was not there to get a taste of ?reality? at today?s Rashtriya Janata Dal rally in Gaya.

 Armed with ?hostile? banners, hundreds of inmates of the Cherki minority orphanage positioned themselves in the middle of Gandhi Maidan to let railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav know what they felt of his party and its alleged failure to protect the centre?s land from the mafia.

 However, Laloo Prasad could not turn up as he had to return to Delhi from Patna in the wake of rumblings in Parliament over yesterday?s train accident in Punjab.

 While the cancellation of Laloo Prasad?s visit would have disappointed children, ? who wanted to draw his attention to the starvation-like situation they were in after land sharks disrupted agricultural work on a 13-acre plot of land of the orphanage ? district RJD chief Irshad Ali Khan and fellow organisers must have heaved a sigh of relief.

 ?Hum bhookhe hain,humare zameen wapas do (We are hungry, give back our land)?, said a banner. RJD leaders shuddered to think of Laloo Prasad?s reaction had the orphans got the opportunity to queer the pitch for the ?messiah of the minorities? and expose the uncomfortable ground realities.

 Intervening on behalf of the Bihar government, law, energy and minority welfare minister Shakeel Ahmed Khan said action would be taken in four days. Taking the assurance with a pinch of salt, the orphans threatened to ?play spoilsport? during the Patna rally on December 23 if their demands were not met as promised.

 Laloo Prasad?s former friend Shivanand Tiwari addressed the impressive gathering. Eight RJD legislators of the district and dozens of other ticket aspirants had transported the party supporters to Gandhi Maidan for the rally. Tiwari accused NDA leaders Sushil Kumar Modi, Nitish Kumar and George Fernandes of being insensitive to the plight of flood victims in the state.

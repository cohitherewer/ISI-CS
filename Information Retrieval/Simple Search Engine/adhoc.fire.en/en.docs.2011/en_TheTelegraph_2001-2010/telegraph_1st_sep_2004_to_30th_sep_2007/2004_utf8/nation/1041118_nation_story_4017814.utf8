 Rs 24000-cr Singh deal

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Srinagar, Nov. 17: Jammu and Kashmir must become a normal functioning economy, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh feels. To this end, he today announced a Rs 24,000-crore plan for the development and reconstruction of the state?s economy.

 Singh also promised Kashmiris that he would ?seek to persuade top private companies, especially in the IT sector, to make Kashmir a priority destination?. The government would also help revive the tourism industry. Singh hoped that ?once there is a permanent end to violence, the state will surely become one of the most attractive international destinations for tourists?.

 At the same time, Singh urged Kashmiris ?to make use of the wealth of opportunities that exist in the rest of India?.

 ?India is changing and changing rapidly. There is a new energy, a new wave of entrepreneurship which has been unleashed. Become a part of this process. By doing so you will carry forward the vision of peace building in Kashmir into the rest of India,? he said.

 The Prime Minister also launched a direct employment creation initiative that would lead to over 24,000 new jobs in Jammu and Kashmir.

 This, according to the Prime Minister, would be achieved through raising five additional India Reserve Battalions for state police (5,000 new jobs across the state); another 5,000 new recruitments to the CRPF and other security force battalions; 14,000 jobs for women in Anganwadis; and most important, lifting the ban on government recruitment.

 Calling for a ?new vision of development for Jammu and Kashmir?, Singh said: ?Kashmir needs financial resources. Kashmir needs physical infrastructure, Kashmir needs better connectivity in all directions.?

 The Rs 24,000-crore project, he claimed, would be ?a plan to reconstruct the economy, reform the government, regenerate entrepreneurship, revitalise the institutions of civil society and redefine the political paradigm and context of the subcontinent?.

 The plan for development and reconstruction of Jammu and Kashmir is a joint effort by the Centre and the state government spread over 2004 to 2008. The aim of this development and reconstruction plan, according to government sources, would be to convert the economy of the state into ?a normal, well-functioning, dynamic and entrepreneurially active economy?.

 The plan, it is said, would revitalise the state?s ailing tourism industry, create new capabilities and generate self-employment opportunities. The Prime Minister, however, also emphasised the need for economic reforms and steps to improve governance in the state. ?The people want a government that is efficient, transparent and free of corruption,? he said.

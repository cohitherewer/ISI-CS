 Bangalore, Nov. 1: Chief minister Dharam Singh today announced a sprawling hi-tech city exclusively for information and biotechnology companies in an effort to retain the city?s reputation as India?s silicon hub.

 The project would take off in a fortnight, he told the 1,000-odd representatives of nearly 300 infotech companies from 15 countries at the inaugural session of Bangalore IT.com, organised jointly by the Karnataka government and the Software Technology Parks of India.

 ?We will leave no stone unturned to ensure Bangalore maintains its pre-eminent position as an IT destination not only in India but also in the world. My government is fully committed to ensure an orderly growth of Bangalore, which is in tune with the requirements of IT industry,? the chief minister said.

 The proposed city, to be spread over 1,070 acres and cost about Rs 390 crore, would serve as a link between the Electronics City at one end of the IT corridor and the International Tech Park Ltd at the other end, on Bangalore?s outskirts.

 The chief minister, stung by recent criticism that Bangalore had inadequate infrastructure, also announced a slew of initiatives. Prominent among them was upgrading all roads in the IT corridor and one linking the Bangalore airport and the Electronics City. ?We are exploring all possibilities of bringing investments to improve the infrastructure,? he said.

 There was a word of advice, too, for head honchos of IT companies: look beyond Bangalore and move on to tier-two cities such as Mysore, Mangalore, Hubli, Belgaum and Gulbarga. ?Setting up new operations in these secondary cities will help the industry cut down costs and check attrition rates. It will also ease the load on Bangalore?s infrastructure and decongest the city,? Singh said.

 Singh said the state government would unveil a comprehensive electronic hardware policy soon to spur growth in the sector. Such a policy would support the software sector, which needs a strong manufacturing base. ?The sector has attracted maximum foreign direct investment and is the key driver of industrial growth in the state. On date, there are about 1,400 IT firms in the state, including 506 multinationals and 116 major Indian companies, employing about 250,000 people.?

 Soon after the inaugural session, industries minister P.G.R. Sindhia said the hi-tech city project would be cleared during the next cabinet meeting. ?The hi-tech city is one major endeavour to ensure good infrastructure facilities for IT and biotechnology companies,? Sindhia said.

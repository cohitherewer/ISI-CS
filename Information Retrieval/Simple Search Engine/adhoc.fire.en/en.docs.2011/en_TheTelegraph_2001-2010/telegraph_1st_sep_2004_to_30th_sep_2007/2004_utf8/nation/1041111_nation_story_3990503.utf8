 Pilot goes down with Mirage

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 10: The pilot of the Mirage 2000 fighter plane that crashed last night, was killed.

 Flight Lieutenant Neehar Gururani was on an ?interception exercise? being trained to hunt enemy aircraft and is suspected to have been disoriented by the pulls and pressures of the supersonic aircraft that he was taking into dives and climbs in the darkness of the night.

 Till last reports on Tuesday night, he was said to have ejected and parachuted down. 

 But Indian Air Force sources confirmed today that he did not survive and went down with the plane.

 The vice chief of the IAF, Air Marshal S.K. Malik, said here this afternoon that Gururani had taken off from the Mirages? base in Gwalior around 8.40 pm, along with a senior officer in another Mirage. 

 Some 15 minutes later when the two aircraft were in the thick of the training sortie, they suddenly disappeared from the radar screen. The radio controller failed to make contact with Gururani. 

 The leader of the exercise was informed but it was too late and all he detected was the smouldering debris of his junior?s aircraft some 50 km northeast of the Gwalior base. 

 The pilot?s father, Air Marshal Gururani, retired recently as the commander of the IAF?s Nagpur-based maintenance command.

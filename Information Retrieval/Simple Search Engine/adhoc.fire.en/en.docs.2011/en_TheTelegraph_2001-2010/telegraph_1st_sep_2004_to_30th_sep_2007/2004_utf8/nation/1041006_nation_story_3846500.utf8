The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation

 ?Team India? poser to board

 OUR BUREAU

Oct. 5: Citing new disclosures, the Supreme 

Court today said ?it appears that the cricket team is ?team India? and not ?team 

BCCI??.

 The observation came when hearing resumed on Zee Telefilms? petition challenging the cancellation of the cricket telecast bidding process.

 The question whether BCCI is a ?state? is crucial for deciding whether Zee?s petition is maintainable.

 The court, which had earlier said the government has not been able to establish the contention that the board is under its control, said from ?the manner in which BCCI has been seeking permissions from the Centre, it appears that the cricket team is ?team India? and not ?team BCCI??.

 The correspondence between the Centre and BCCI ?reveals? how the cricket board always approached the government seeking permission for hosting cricket matches against foreign teams and for sending the Indian team abroad, Justice S.. Variava said.

 ?Contrary to your (BCCI) stand that you do not go to the government for anything, you go to the government from time to time. You should have disclosed this correspondence to the court earlier,? the judge said.

 ?Because you (the board) say that India is playing with such and such country, you go to the Union government seeking permissions. It would not have been so if it was BCCI playing its club team,? he said.

 ?If a club wanted to send its team abroad for playing a match, it would only have to seek visa from the foreign country and not permission from the Union government,? Variava said.

Ten pads up 

 Ten Sport, which will produce the Australia series for BCCI, is bringing in 20 tonnes of equipment from Singapore and England and putting together a crew of around 150 with people from Australia, England, South Africa and India.

 Everything is being put into place, but costs are rising due to the short notice, an official said.

 ?The same things that would take seven to 10 days if planned ahead are being done in a day or two,? said the official. As a result, costs have gone up by at least 30 per cent. 

 Ten did not divulge the production fee, but the channel said it is ?recovering only the cost? from BCCI. 

 The commentary team for the Australia series would have Sanjay Manjrekar, Laxman Sivaramakrishnan, Michael Atherton, Dean Jones and Michael Slater, while Ravi Shastri is set to join for the last two Tests.

 Jaya rush to YSR to even scores

 Hyderabad: Jayalalithaa landed here on Friday to procure more drinking water for Chennai, two days after her rival party directly appealed to the Andhra Pradesh chief minister.

 fter the half-hour meeting with Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy, the Tamil Nadu chief minister said: ?We are already getting 2,000 cusecs of Krishna water daily. On our request, the AP chief minister has assured us to increase the flow to 10,000 cusecs daily.?

 The DMK had stolen her thunder when the party?s MP and Union minister T.R. Baalu had requested Reddy for more water. M. Karunanidhi sent the Andhra?s Congress chief minister a note of thanks after he assured all help. Their parties are allies both in Tamil Nadu and at the Centre.

 This morning, the Andhra irrigation ministry held a high-level meeting and prepared a blueprint for releasing 10,000 cusecs from the Krishna from today.

 ressed in a bottle-green sari and without her customary bulletproof jacket, Jayalalithaa said: ?I have come to plead for more water on behalf of the people of Chennai? as the city was suffering its worst water crisis in 54 years.

 Endangered species sighted

 Pune (PTI): A type of wild dog known 

 as whistling hunter, an endangered species under the Wildlife 

 Protection Act, has been sighted in the southern part of 

 the district.

 hief conservator of forests P.J. Thorse on Friday said: ?I talked to people in the area and the information provided by them points towards the existence of wild dogs in the southern part of Pune district.?

 ?We have increased patrolling in the area where the wild dogs have been sighted and also sought people?s help in ensuring the safety of this endangered species,? he said.

 Tigers, leopards and bisons are said to fear the wild dogs, Thorse said.

 The dhole ? another name for the wild dog ? hunts in packs. Though it looks similar to the domestic dog, it has shorter legs and muzzle, its ears are more rounded at the tip and the tail is more bushy.

 They differ from wolves, domestic dogs or jackals as these animals have seven molar teeth while wild dogs have six in the lower jaw, the official added.

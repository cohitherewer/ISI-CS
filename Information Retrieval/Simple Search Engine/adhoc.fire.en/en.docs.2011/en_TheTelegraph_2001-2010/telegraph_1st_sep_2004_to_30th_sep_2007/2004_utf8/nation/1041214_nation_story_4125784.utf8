 Laloo legal support swells

 Laloo Prasad

 New Delhi, Dec. 13: The Central Board of Direct Taxes today said the Patna income-tax appellate tribunal had not committed any ?irregularity? in quashing the huge tax claim against Laloo Prasad Yadav and Rabri Devi in the ?disproportionate assets cases? filed against them.

 The direct taxes board has said this in an affidavit filed before the Supreme Court.

 The court had earlier issued notices to the CBI and the direct taxes board on a petition by Janata Dal (United) MP Rajiv Ranjan Singh ?Lalan? and BJP leader Sushil Modi.

 Lalan moved a public interest litigation seeking action against Laloo Prasad, saying the railway minister was misusing his official position and that of his wife ? who is Bihar chief minister ? to manipulate proceedings. He said a tax official had been brought in ?overnight? to head the tribunal and make things easier for the couple.

 The CBI, which has been probing cases related to the fodder scam as well as the assets case, had earlier told the court that the PIL was ?politically motivated?. Lalan?s plea sought cancellation of the bail, alleging that Laloo Prasad has been ?tampering with evidence? and ?influencing witnesses?, besides manipulating various government departments.

 Modi, the joint petitioner in the PIL, has alleged that the tribunal quashed the income-tax case as well as the claim against the couple in a ?suspicious? and ?hurried? manner.

 Taking on record the tax board?s reply, a division bench of Justices S.N. Variava and H.K. Sema adjourned hearing on the petition till the second week of January. In its response, the tax board said the Patna tribunal had functioned ?appropriately and properly as per procedure established by law?.

 It said an appeal could be filed under Section 260a(I) of the Income-Tax Act against the appellate tribunal order only if a ?substantial question of law arises from the orders passed by the authorities specified in Section 260(2)(a)?.

 The board also refuted the petitioners? allegation that Laloo Prasad and Rabri Devi had influenced it in getting the tax demands quashed. It termed the argument that the couple ?influenced? the government departments as ?wholly malicious and untenable?. 

 ?By making such blatantly erroneous and misconceived averments, pressurising tactics have been employed by the petitioner to hamper independent functioning of the executive wing of the government of India via CBDT,? the board added.

 It said the allegations against it were ?unfounded?, ?misconceived? and ?unsustainable?. The board added that it had sought legal opinion, according to which ?there is no substantial question of law for filing an appeal?. 

 Earlier, the CBI questioned the locus standi of the petitioners, saying: ?The petitioners are politicians and are obviously seeking to achieve political mileage.?

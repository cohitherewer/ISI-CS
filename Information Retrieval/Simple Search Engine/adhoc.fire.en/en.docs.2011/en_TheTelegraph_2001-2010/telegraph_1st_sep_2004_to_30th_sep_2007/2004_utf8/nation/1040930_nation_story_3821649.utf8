 Pak frowns on shrine hit

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Islamabad, Sept. 29: Pakistan today condemned the recent attack on Gurdwara Nankana Sahib near Lahore.

 ?The miscreants will be firmly dealt with in accordance with laws,? foreign ministry spokesperson Masood Khan said in a statement here. Pakistan would continue to assist and facilitate pilgrimage by Sikhs from all over the world to their shrines in the country, he added.

 The provincial education department?s announcement that it was returning a college on the gurdwara premises to the Evacuee Trust Board for construction of a guesthouse for Sikh pilgrims had provoked the attack by students on Saturday.

 Officials said the expansion would help accommodate more than 6,000 Sikh pilgrims who visit Pakistan every year. Nankana Sahib is the birthplace of Guru Nanak, the first Sikh guru. Chief minister of Punjab Pervaiz Elahi has approved construction of a modern complex and a railway station near the gurdwara.

 The students claimed that the administration had been asked to move out without being allocated suitable land and funds for a new building.

 Officials in the Evacuee Trust Board had earlier this week denied the attack, which was reported by the Sikh Sang at Committee. But Kalyan Singh of the committee iterated that students had stormed the gurdwara. ?This attack was the first of its kind,? he said.

 Eight members of the committee had on Sunday blocked a road in front of Lahore Press Club to protest the incident. But they dispersed after being promised protection for the gurdwara. ?We protested against an attack on our sacred place and property? it is our right and the local police failed to do anything as the incident took place in their presence,? Singh said.

 A government handout said the chief minister had taken strict notice of the incident at Nankana Sahib and directed the IG to investigate it.

 ?Pakistan has strongly condemned the recent attempt by some miscreants to damage property associated with Gurdwara Nankana Sahib,? the foreign office statement said.

 Inspector-general Sadatullah Khan said the issue had been resolved amicably but promised to look into the possibility of the involvement of a hidden hand.

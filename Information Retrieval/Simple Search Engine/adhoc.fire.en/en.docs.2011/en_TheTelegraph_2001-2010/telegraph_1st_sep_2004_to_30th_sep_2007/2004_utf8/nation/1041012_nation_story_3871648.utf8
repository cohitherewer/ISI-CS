 Locked-out judge at HC door 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, Oct. 11: The controversy over the Board of Control for Cricket in India continued to boil today with Justice S. Mohan handing a report to Madras High Court on the events of Saturday, when he had gone to Mumbai to take charge of the sports body.

 The high court had on October 8 restrained the newly-elected BCCI office-bearers from functioning and appointed the retired Supreme Court judge as the interim administrator. 

 However, when Justice Mohan reached the cricket board?s office in Mumbai the next day, he found the doors locked.

 ?It (the report) is not a complaint. I have made a factual report as to what happened the day before yesterday when I went to Mumbai,? Justice Mohan said after submitting the report to the court in person.

 The former apex court judge declined to comment on the subsequent developments in the Supreme Court today. 

 Justice Mohan had expressed shock at the ?sorry? state of affairs on finding the BCCI doors locked. He said he was disappointed as he was in Mumbai in an official capacity and not to interfere with the game.

 ?The high court requested me and I accepted it only out of respect for the court and my love for the game,? he had said.

 Asked if the events of Saturday would invite contempt of court proceedings, he said, ?It is for the court to decide.?

 The former apex court judge did not think that the legal tussle would affect the game. ?Why should it affect the game? The game will be affected only if the selection process is not proper,? he said.

 Himachal snow threat to power supply

Shimla, Oct. 30: A bad monsoon and an early 

snowfall in Himachal Pradesh could spell trouble in several states dependent on 

Himachal hydel projects for power supply. 

 The 1,500-mw Nathpa Jhakri power project alone supplies power to New Delhi, Haryana, Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Uttaranchal, Chandigarh and Himachal Pradesh. It generates 149 mw for the central grid, besides supplying 319 mw to Haryana, 152 mw to Punjab and 217 mw to Rajasthan. Uttar Pradesh gets 221 mw from the project, Delhi 397 mw, Chandigarh 8 mw and Himachal 37 mw.

 This year, however, power generation was badly hit after there were fears of flash floods from the likely collapse of an artificial lake on the Pare Chu river in Tibet. Due to this, six units of the Nathpa Jhakri project were closed for days. The erratic monsoon aggravated matters. The state gets rains till September 15 but this year the rains stopped by the last week of August. The water level in the country?s largest dam, the Bhakra reservoir, touched an all-time low in 40 years. 

 In addition, the early snowfall has led to freezing of water sources. 

 ?Only one unit out of six is generating electricity these days. The water level in the Sutlej has come down drastically to as low as 65 to 90 cusecs. Normally, the project (the Nathpa Jhakri) gets adequate water till November and all units work efficiently, but this year the scanty rainfall has reduced the water level. We normally get 350 cusecs water during September but this year only 200 cusecs were available,? said project director H.K. Sharma. 

 If the conditions remain unchanged, the low power generation in the state units can lead to power cuts in several states.

 ?Early snowfall has expanded the lean period of electricity generation in the state. Normally the lean period (when the electricity generation is lowest) starts after November 15, but due to early snowfall it started in October. This can affect 10 per cent electricity generation but if the temperature does not improve, it can bring down the generation to 50 per cent,? says S.. Kapoor, the chief engineer (operations) of the state?s electricity board.

 The condition of electricity generation in other power projects of the state is no different. Generation at the Chamera Hydel Power Project in Chamba district has also gone down due to the fall in water level. 

 This project is one of the major sources of power in the North Region Load Despatch Centre, Delhi, which is currently getting power from other sources. 

 Himachal state electricity board sources said the 540-mw Chamera project has failed to meet the targets fixed by the North Region Load Despatch Centre. 

 ?The water in Ravi river has receded drastically and we?re not able to meet the given targets,? said an electricity board senior engineer.

 The power generation in the 110-mw Shanan Hydel Power Project in Mandi has come down to 45 mw. This drop can jolt power supply to the Punjab Electricity Board.

 Low power generation in Himachal, known as the ?power state?, may compel the state to purchase power from its neighbours. 

 The state consumes highest amount of electricity in winter.

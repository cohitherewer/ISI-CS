Hospital in tizzy over Priyanka son mishap

 New Delhi, Oct. 25: A south Delhi hospital was thrown into a tizzy last evening when a tense Priyanka Gandhi and Robert Vadra brought along son Rehan, 4, for attention after a freak accident.

 Nine doctors at Max Healthcare Hospital in Panchsheel Park were kept on alert for Rehan who was injured when a branch struck him in the neck as he was playing on the terrace of his Lodhi Estate house.

 With Rehan complaining of a stiff neck, his parents rushed him to hospital around 6.45 pm. Carried in by Robert, the four-year-old was admitted to the emergency ward.

 Since there weren?t enough doctors on duty as it was a Sunday, the hospital issued an SOS to nine doctors. Some rushed to the hospital while others were kept on standby.

 Hospital sources said Rehan was thoroughly examined and an MRI scan done to make sure there was no fracture. Priyanka and Robert stood in attendance for nearly an hour as doctors conducted the whole gamut of tests.

 The boy was cleared of serious injury and allowed to go home after the test results came in.

 Police had tightened security around the hospital anticipating visits by senior Congress leaders, including grandmother Sonia Gandhi. But the security was relaxed once it became clear there was no serious injury and Rehan would be soon allowed to go home.

 Russia ties in new mould

 New Delhi, Dec. 1: India and Russia?s time-tested military relationship is being refashioned in talks that visiting Russian defence minister Sergei Ivanov led today. 

 India has asked for bank guarantees for current and future arms contracts that it is negotiating with its biggest supplier of military hardware and Russia is insisting on a secrecy pact that will ensure information on weapon systems is not transferred to a third country.

 Both Moscow and Delhi have taken unconventionally hard postures in the talks that precede Russian President Vladimir Putin?s visit. Putin is expected in the capital on Friday.

 But neither side will push the envelop so hard as to take the relationship to the brink. Between 65 and 70 per cent of Indian imports of military hardware are Russian (or from the former USSR countries) and nearly half of Russian military exports are to India. 

 Russian companies are just as financially dependent on sales to the Indian armed forces as the Indian Army, Navy and Air Force are dependent on them for supplies. The military trade between Russia and India is worth an estimated $33 billion.

 Ivanov said India-Russia military relations can scale greater heights if Delhi were to sign a secrecy agreement, a draft for which was placed two years ago.

 ?We are prepared to transfer high-tech frontier technology to India in a strategic tie-up based on a new pattern of defence cooperation,? Ivanov said after an hour?s meeting with defence minister Pranab Mukherjee. 

 The new pattern of defence cooperation is clearly a move towards transactions involving joint ventures and co-production arrangements and can mean the scaling down of extra-economic considerations in the relationship.

 Russian officials in the talks sought an Intellectual Property Rights Agreement with India. Concerns have been voiced in the past over India using Israeli technology in conjunction with Russian hardware. For instance, the Phalcon airborne early warning systems that India has contracted with Israel are to be mounted on Russian aircraft.

 Ivanov said India and Russia?s defence cooperation can transcend buyer-seller relationship. Delhi, too, has been increasingly keen on joint production with its military hardware suppliers. 

 Indian officials say co-production arrangements are more secure. They point to uncertainty over some contracts, such as16 MiG 29K fighter aircraft that are to be based in the Admiral carrier, Gorshkov. The carrier has been contracted and is now being refitted for delivery scheduled in 2008. But the MiG Corporation had run into financial difficulties and there have been doubts on whether the company would be able to stick to the production schedule for the aircraft.

 Ivanov said if an agreement on intellectual property rights in military trade is signed, it will be possible to enter into joint development of high technology weapon systems. There have been concerns on India-Russian joint venture weapon systems ? such as the BrahMos supersonic cruise missile ? that has been earmarked for export to ?friendly? countries.

 The heads of the Indian armed forces, Air Chief Marshal S. Krishnaswamy, General N.C. Vij and Admiral Arun Prakash, met the Russian defence minister. The Russian delegation for the talks include, apart from Ivanov, admiral of the fleet and Russian navy chief Vladimir Ivanovich Kuryodov, head of the main department in the ministry of defence, Colonel General Anatoli Ignatievich Mazurkovich, and Lieutenant General Vladislav Alexanderovich Polonski, head of the main armoured department.

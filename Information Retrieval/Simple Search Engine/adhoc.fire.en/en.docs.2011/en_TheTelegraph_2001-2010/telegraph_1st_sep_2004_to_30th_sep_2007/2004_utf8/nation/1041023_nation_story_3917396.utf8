 Poll over, Singh on way to EU meet

 New Delhi, Oct. 22: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will leave for The Hague on November 7 to attend an India-European Union summit the next day.

 The summit, slated for October 14, had to be put off because Singh was preoccupied with the Maharashtra elections and his Dutch counterpart Balke Nende was ill. The Prime Minister will fly back on November 9.

 The EU is India?s largest trading partner and the two sides have tried to strengthen ties, especially through their annual summit. The EU holds annual summits with the US, Russia, China and Japan and India?s inclusion in the group suggests the European bloc wants to count Delhi among key international players.

 The EU council, equivalent to the European cabinet, came up with a strategy paper on India on October 13. The document will serve as a guide for future ties between the two sides.

 There are indications that the two sides will try to upgrade their dialogue into a ?strategic? one and come up with a document announcing their partnership. ?The council recalls the ambition of the European Security Strategy to move towards a strategic partnership with India, taking into account the country?s role in international relations,? the EU strategy paper says.

 The EU has appreciated the Singh-led United Progressive Alliance government?s commitment to stay on the reforms course but feels the benefit of rapid economic development should reach more states.

 The bloc has said the ?fight against poverty? remains at the top of India?s agenda. ?Despite impressive economic growth in the last few years, around 300 million people live below the internationally agreed poverty line. The benefits of India?s rapid economic development should be spread more equitably between all Indian states,? the paper says.

 ?The council stands ready to launch in the near future the elaboration together with India of (a) comprehensive EU-India Action Plan and a new joint EU-India Political Declaration for approval at the next summit meeting,? it adds. Strengthening economic ties and boosting trade through better market access and continued economic reforms seems among the priority areas.

 The EU also wants to have better cooperation with India in the UN and other multilateral fora, especially on conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction. It wants better and closer cooperation on non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery. The bloc also wants to work closely with India against terrorism and organised crime.

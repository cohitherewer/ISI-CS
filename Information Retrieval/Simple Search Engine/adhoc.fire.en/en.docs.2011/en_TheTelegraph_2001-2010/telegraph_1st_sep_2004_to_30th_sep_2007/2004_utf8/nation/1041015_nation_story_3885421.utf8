 Clive treasure

 WILL BENNETT

 London, Oct. 14: A unique 

 collection of Mughal treasures assembled by Robert Clive 

 was temporarily banned from leaving Britain yesterday in 

 an attempt to stop the world?s biggest art buyer from taking 

 it to the Gulf.

 The collection was bought for ?4.7 million by Sheikh Saud al-Thani, a cousin of the Emir of Qatar, at Christie?s in London in April for a museum of Islamic art in the Gulf state.

 Clive?s jade jewelled flask (in picture) was sold for almost ?3 million, but yesterday arts minister Estelle Morris placed a two-month export ban on four pieces to give British buyers the chance to match the auction price. 

 The flask, once part of the collection at the imperial court in Delhi, was loaned to the Victoria amp; Albert Museum in 1963 by Vida Schreiber, who had inherited it from her first husband, Viscount Clive. Following her death, the family decided to sell it and three other pieces. These are a flywhisk of banded agate and inset with rubies valued at ?919,000, a ceremonial dagger set with gems worth almost ?750,000 and a hookah priced at over ?97,000. All were bought by the sheikh.

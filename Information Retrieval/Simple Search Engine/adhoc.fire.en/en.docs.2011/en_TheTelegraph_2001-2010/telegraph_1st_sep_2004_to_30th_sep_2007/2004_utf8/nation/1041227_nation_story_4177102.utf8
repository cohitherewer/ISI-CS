 Delhi catches whiff of gas

 PRANAY SHARMA

 Islamabad, Dec. 26: Iran foreign minister Kamal Kharazzi is arriving here tomorrow to hold talks with the Pakistani leadership, which could lead to serious discussions on the proposed Indo-Iranian gas pipeline passing through Pakistan.

 His visit coincides with the two-day talks that begin here tomorrow between foreign secretary Shyam Saran and his Pakistan counterpart Riaz Khokhar to review the progress of the peace process and discuss Jammu and Kashmir and security questions.

 The gas pipeline from Iran to India has been touted in some sections as a major factor for peace and stability in the region. Of the 27,775 km that the pipeline is likely to cover, nearly 760 km will run through Pakistan.

 Although both India and Pakistan agree that the pipeline will be to their mutual benefit and also be a stabilising factor in their ties, they ? like in most other cases ? differ on how to go about implementing the project.

 Islamabad wants it to be a ?stand-alone? agreement. But Delhi insists it should be linked with the free market access for Indian goods to Pakistan?s markets and deepening economic and trade ties.

 But the fact that petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar was in Tehran less than a fortnight ago to discuss the pipeline with the Iranian leaders makes Kharazzi?s visit to Islamabad more important.

 The Iran minister is scheduled to meet President Pervez Musharraf, Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz and foreign minister Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri during his two-day talks. Although it has not been stated officially, the proposed pipeline is likely to feature prominently in the talks. Among the senior officials taking part in the talks will be Pakistan commerce secretary Ahmed Waqar. 

 The Iran-Pakistan working group on the pipeline also met in Tehran a few days ago and Kharazzi?s visit now has raised the hope of a meaningful discussion on the pipeline in several quarters. Aiyar, during his visit to Tehran, had made proposals to the Iranian leadership on the $4-billion pipeline.

 The minister told CNN that he suggested Iran and India negotiate the terms and conditions for delivery of gas at a point on the Indo-Pak border while the question of its security and uninterrupted operations could be a bilateral matter between Iran and Pakistan.

 ?The two agreements would become back-to-back but independent of each other with different partners and that might be the way forward,? Aiyar was quoted as saying on CNN.

 With over 16 per cent of the world?s gas reserves, Iran has the potential for playing a significant role in supplying gas to the Asian markets, especially to South Asia. The demands for gas in both India and Pakistan is exceedingly high and Iran could be the perfect answer.

 Arjun puts college reforms on hold

 Singh: Autonomy plea

 New Delhi, Nov. 18: The human resource development ministry has put on hold the move to reform the University Grants Commission and the higher education system.

 Murli Manohar Joshi, the human resource development minister in the former National Democratic Alliance government, had drafted a model act to revamp the UGC. The act sought more UGC control on colleges and universities.

 A senior official in the ministry said the United Progressive Alliance government has decided not to rush the reforms and wait for the recommendations of the Central Advisory Board of Education (Cabe), which is expected to meet in January.

 The ministry believes there is no doubt that the UGC has its shortcomings. But as the commission has been functioning for decades, there is no harm if reforms are delayed a little longer.

 The Cabe is unlikely to back the reforms Joshi suggested. His successor, Arjun Singh, has already indicated the likelihood of scrapping the model act altogether.

 Singh says a large section of academics is unhappy with Joshi?s reform proposals, which are construed as a means to erode the autonomy of higher education institutions.

 The ruling coalition?s common minimum programme is committed to maintaining the institutions? autonomy. 

 But advocates of UGC reforms argue that Indian universities must reform themselves in terms of quality of education and efficiency if they are to meet the challenges posed by globalisation.

 They believe that reputed foreign universities will make an official entry in the country if India decides to open up higher education as part of negotiations on the General Agreement on Trade in Services. The HRD ministry is working out areas of negotiation in education.

 One of the changes in higher education the UGC has suggested is to offer more job-oriented courses and to hire part-time teachers for these new disciplines. University teachers are opposing the proposal.

 Officials say the decision to delay the reforms is not influenced by political considerations. The ministry, they emphasise, has no agenda to undo all of Joshi?s decisions.

 Singh has systematically reversed a majority of Joshi?s decisions, beginning with the Indian Institute of Management fees and going on to Kendriya Vidyalaya policies.

 He has also set in motion an exercise of reviewing the national school curriculum introduced by J.S. Rajput, former director of the National Council of Educational Research and Training. The NCERT, under new director Krishna Kumar, will draft a new school curriculum that will be ready by the summer of 2005.

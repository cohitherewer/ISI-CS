 Dodgy economics of cricket rights

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 8: Analysts are divided over Zee Network?s ability to transform its $308-million cricket rights acquisition into a profitable venture but the company is oozing confidence.

 A study by SSKI Securities, a Mumbai-based brokerage firm, shows Zee ending up with losses of over Rs 100 crore, even in the best-case scenario.

 The study suggests Zee?s bagging the rights will result in better declaration of the consumer numbers, resulting in higher revenues, as well as have a positive impact on advertising pull.

 Assuming 144 days of cricket (64 ODIs and 80 Test match-days), the study estimates total income from advertising at Rs 691 crore. Combining earnings from international rights (Rs 200 crore) and subscription (Rs 768 crore), total revenues are estimated at Rs 1,659 crore.

 With a production cost of around Rs 250 crore, Rs 95 crore for sharing domestic rights with the national broadcaster and the bid amount of Rs 1,447.60 crore, the total cost to Zee works out to around Rs 1,792.60 crore. The loss is over Rs 133 crore.

 ?Taking all the factors into consideration, we can?t see Zee making any money at all,? said Nikhil Vora of SSKI Securities. ?The study takes into account increase in ad rates, optimum utilisation of capacity and increase in bouquet subscription rates,? he added.

 Others offer a different view. ?It?s true that since ad rates have already gone up in the past six months, they will not go up by much in the immediate future,? said Nitin Jain, the general manager of media buying agency Mindshare. ?However, one of Zee?s greatest strengths is that it has the largest international network.? 

 Zee has a strong presence in the US and UK markets. The task may be a daunting one, feels Jain, but not impossible, given the way distribution patterns are constantly changing. ?Also, four years is a long time and other sources of revenue can crop up later.?

 Although no one would go on record, broadcasters, particularly those who have handled cricket before, feel that it will be a tough task for the entertainment network. ?The initial bid amount was already more than what Zee could hope to recover,? said a broadcast official. ?Raising it to $308 million makes it extremely hard for the company to earn any profits.?

 Zee had revised its initial bid of $260 million to $308 million for broadcasting rights of cricket played in India for the next four years.

 But Zee itself is confident of not only breaking even but also making profits out of the deal. ?We have always stressed that there is a lot of potential in domestic cricket in India that has not been tapped,? said Ashish Kaul, the vice-president, corporate brand development group. ?Why should we even think on the lines of recovering money? he said, ?when we are here to make good profits.?

 According to Kaul, international syndication will be a key source of revenue for the network. ?In the case of the India-Australia series, for instance, we will be able to sell the rights directly to any broadcasting company in Australia.? 

 Kaul also stresses that it will not be a standalone sports channel but the might of a network, comprising 20 channels, that will make the difference.

 ?No one has a distribution platform like us,? said Kaul. Direct-to-home, of which Zee is the only private broadcaster at present, is also an option that will be aggressively explored.

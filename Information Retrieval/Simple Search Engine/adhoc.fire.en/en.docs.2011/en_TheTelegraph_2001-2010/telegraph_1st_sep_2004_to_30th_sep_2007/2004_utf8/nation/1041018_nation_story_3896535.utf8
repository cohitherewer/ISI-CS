 Sushma does Sonia U-turn

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Sushma: Volte face

 New Delhi, Oct. 17: Sushma Swaraj today went back on her statement lauding Sonia Gandhi for her leadership in the Maharashtra elections, dubbing it instead as the Congress? ?worst? performance in the state. 

 It is believed the BJP leadership pulled up Sushma after she told reporters yesterday that due credit should be given to Sonia Gandhi as Congress president for leading the party to victory not only in the Lok Sabha polls, but also in Maharashtra. 

 Asked if Sonia was instrumental in the victory, Sushma said she had worked and campaigned hard. 

 A day later, she read a different script. Sharad Pawar, chief of the Congress? junior partner, the Nationalist Congress Party, and not Sonia was the real victor in these elections, said Sushma. 

 ?In the 1999 elections, the Congress won 75 seats on its own. This time it has won only 68 seats and that, too, in alliance with the NCP,? she said. 

 Sushma had made the statements complimenting Sonia on television while conceding her party?s defeat yesterday. Today, she denied it all. ?Nobody in the country expects me to say what was reported in the press,? she said. 

 The Maharashtra elections, she clarified, were not fought on the issue of Sonia?s leadership. The contest was over local issues and the Congress ended up with its lowest-ever tally in the state. 

 The BJP, which targeted Sonia during the Lok Sabha elections, has been pushed on the backfoot after the Congress wrested power in Delhi and managed to hold Mumbai. 

 Sushma and Uma Bharti were particularly virulent in their attacks on Sonia after the Congress-led coalition came to power at the Centre. 

 Sushma had threatened to live like a widow if Sonia became the Prime Minister.

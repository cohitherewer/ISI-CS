 Call of science in model passion

 Panda: All for his love

 Bahanaga (Balasore), Dec 27: Forty-year-old Mihir Panda of Bahanaga block in Balasore district has a passion for which he can go to any extent.

 Inside the civil engineer?s house, it feels like being inside a museum with science models of all shapes and sizes greeting visitors from every nook and corner. His models include miniature versions of a steam engine, a bulldozer and even a crane, which Panda built using scrap material. 

 The last time he counted, there were over 10,000 models in the house. 

 Panda?s affair with science models began in 1986 when he started teaching some local children. Confessing that he did not know much about science models then, Panda recounts how he dismantled the doorbell of his house to show the children how it worked. Undeterred by the scolding he received from his parents for his act, Panda himself built a doorbell, which stopped working a few days later. 

 Panda did not give in and built another doorbell, this time with success. ?I felt like being on cloud nine that day. I thought I had just won the Nobel Prize,? he said. 

 The experiment with doorbells transformed the self-confessed ?romantic? to a serious follower of science. ?I was into writing romantic poems then,? he recalled. Even after he secured a government job, the passion for science did not wane. 

 As he invested heavily in the science models, Panda?s parents, former teachers and even friends thought he had gone mad. ?But once the models started taking shape, I knew there was no looking back,? he said. 

 Egged on by his children and a supportive wife, the civil engineer indeed never looked back as he built a series of models for the benefit of students. 

 Today, Panda churns out small scientific models like counting box and microscope with the help of two carpenters. He also runs an NGO ? the Social Development Research Organisation for Science Technology ? through which he aims to popularise science among schoolchildren.

 Though he regularly used to visit schools with his models earlier, the government job has prevented him from doing so now. Instead, students from far and wide come to his workshop every Sunday for long sessions on Panda?s science models. 

 The children have an enriching experience as Panda explains the mechanisms of steam engines, aero engines, bulldozers, submarine, cranes and water turbines, all of which he has worked upon. 

 Learning sessions with Panda are never dull as he uses songs and toys to teach the children. ?The submarine was really fascinating,? said an excited Ramya Ranjan Pradhan, a student of Nilagiri Town High School.

 ?He (Panda) may look and sound weird. But he is so passionate about science,? said M.P. Nayak, a government official in Balasore who has known Panda for years. 

 Several of Panda?s models have won prizes at science exhibitions. Although he has not received any financial assistance for his efforts, Panda manages to fund his models by selling the bonsai trees he collects from various places.

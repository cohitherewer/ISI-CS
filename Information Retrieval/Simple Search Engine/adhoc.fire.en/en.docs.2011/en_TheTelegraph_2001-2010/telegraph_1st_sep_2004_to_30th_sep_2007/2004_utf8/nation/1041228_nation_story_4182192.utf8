 EC makes Laloo shed frills

 Patna, Dec. 27: When Laloo Prasad Yadav came to the Rashtriya Janata Dal?s office here on December 21, he travelled as people knew he would ? his car guided by a pilot vehicle and siren playing all through.

 Laloo Prasad had come to the party office to announce that the RJD?s rally was being called off. But the Election Commission?s tough talk ? on the reality of the model code of conduct coming into force in the state ? has changed everything.

 The RJD chief landed in Patna last night from Delhi. But the usual caravan of cars was missing outside the airport. The fact that Election Commission consultant K.J. Rao had boarded the same flight from Delhi contributed to the change.

 Laloo Prasad travelled in a simple jeep from the airport to his wife, chief minister Rabri Devi?s residence. Most of the waiting journalists even missed to catch a glimpse of the RJD president since they did not expect him to move without the usual frills.

 The ways of ministers and senior politicians in the Bihar government have also changed. Some of them had been caught on the wrong foot when they came in their official vehicles to attend the RJD?s national executive meeting on December 23.

 ?Suddenly, everyone who matters has been trying to adhere to the model poll code. Such strict observance of the code is happening in the state for the first time. The big shock of the RJD having to call off its December 23 rally for the same reason is the main factor,? official sources said.

 A traffic policeman at the Dak Bungalow Chowk, the busiest junction in the city, said he too had noticed the change. ?We do not spot too many vehicles with red beacon lights these days, although there is no change in the number of cars with orange lights. I think the change has something to do with the model code coming into operation,? he said. Orange beacon lights are fitted on cars used by bureaucrats.

 The Election Commission consultant today began the training programme of state employees at the collectorate. Such programmes will be conducted at all divisional headquarters before the elections.

 The ongoing strike of the non-gazetted employees has become a cause of concern for the election officials. But the training programme will continue despite the strike as the poll panel has indicated its wish to co-opt as many central government employees for election duty as possible.

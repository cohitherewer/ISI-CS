 Deadly scrap import

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 4: Senior managers of Bhushan Steel and Strips, arrested by Ghaziabad police, have admitted to knowing there were explosives in steel scrap imported from Iran recently. 

 An explosion in the scrap last week had killed 10 persons and injured 30.

 Police sources said general manager V.S. Verma and assistant general manager Ompal Singh, who were picked up on Friday, had revealed during interrogation that getting ammunition in imported scrap was routine and the company used to segregate them during offloading. 

 But they did not clarify how they used to dispose of the ammunition, indicating that the nearby Hindon river could have been used.

 The local administration and the police have drawn up a list of 15 factories in the area that receive a similar kind of scrap for melting.

 The scrap, which was loaded in 11 trucks, had been imported from Bundar Abbas in Iran through the Dubai-based Lucky Metal. The scrap, which had come in containers, had entered India by sea through Kandla Port in Gujarat. The consignment had managed to get customs clearance and was later transported to the Tughlakabad depot in the capital. 

 The Central Board of Excise and Customs today suspended superintendent A.K. Pathania and inspector Ajay Jain, posted at the Tughlakabad Inland Container Depot, who were responsible for checking the containers. An inquiry to ascertain the role of the customs officers who examined the consignment has also been ordered.

 Defence ministry officials said there was enough ammunition in one truck to supply a small army. The bomb disposal squads of the National Security Guards and the army are now engaged in segregating the explosives from the scrap. Till the time of filing the report, 37 pieces of unexploded ordnance had been retrieved from the scrap during the day. 

 Army officials said there was enough ammunition to cause substantial damage to Ghaziabad had the explosives been put into furnaces. 

 Among the ammunition were mortars, grenades, anti-tank mines and anti-tank shells. The markings on the shells, however, were not just from Iran but were different companies.

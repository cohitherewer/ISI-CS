 Mental health-care lessons for West

 M.R. VENKATESH 

 Chennai, Nov. 15: Model Indian, appeal global.

 Western countries are increasingly looking at the role of the Indian family tradition in curing and coping with mental illness.

 A recent international conference here of the Toronto-based World Fellowship for Schizophrenia and Allied Disorders came up with statistics to highlight the importance of family ties for such patients.

 India has 4,000 psychiatrists for a population of one billion, said the organisation, which catalyses the formation of self-help groups to help people cope with mental problems. New York has more and so does Holland, which has a population of just six million.

 While India cuts a sorry figure, the numbers also indicate the importance of family bonding in dealing with mental maladies.

 Developed and affluent societies suffer from ?death of the family syndrome?. However, the last 25 years have seen a ?paradigm shift?, J.K. Trivedi, president of the Indian Psychiatric Society, told the conference that brought together nearly 50 delegates from the US, the UK, Sweden, Germany, Switzerland, Australia, New Zealand and Africa.

 Trivedi said studies have shown that from being blamed as the ?cause of mental illness?, there has been a dramatic shift towards the family being ?considered very important for favourable outcomes in treating mental illness?. 

 Despite the fragmentation of the joint family, the Indian family, as the primary social unit, has been the ?main source of support? in caring for relatives, he pointed out.

 While five to six million people suffer from major mental ailments, less than 10 per cent get treatment. The government spends only 0.01 per cent of the GDP on mental health. Most mental patients live with family members who provide medical, financial and emotional support.

 Psychologist and social worker Sarada Menon, who founded the Schizophrenia Research Foundation in Chennai, underlined that treatment and rehabilitation of the mentally ill could not be achieved by medication alone. ?Unless there is unstinted family support, the rate of recovery can at best be marginal,? she said.

 Norman Sartorious, a WHO expert on mental health and president of the Association of European Psychiatrists, said it was ?well functioning families? that could promote ?social capital?. In today?s world, he said, ?the family movement was the only hope for a better environment?.

 Sartorious said social capital could be defined as ?public good, which results from mutually helpful relationships among people?. 

 ?When people think they can buy everything, including love, with money, then social capital of that society goes down, which is bad,? said Sartorious, who claimed to have learnt a lot working in India.

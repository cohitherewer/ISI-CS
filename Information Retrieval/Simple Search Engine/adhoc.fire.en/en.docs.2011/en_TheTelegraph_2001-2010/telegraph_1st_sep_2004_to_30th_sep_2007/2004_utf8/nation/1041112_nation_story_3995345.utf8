 Major suspended over rape charge

 New Delhi, Nov. 11: The army chief today suspended an officer who is suspected to have sexually assaulted a woman and her daughter in the Valley.

 Major Rahman has been ordered to be put under ?close arrest for violation of set-down procedures with regard to execution of operations?, an army spokesman announced here tonight, reports our special correspondent.

 Over the past few days, a wave of protests in the Valley, following the charges against the army officer, has threatened to queer Delhi?s peace initiative in the Valley.

 The alleged rape occurred on November 6 at Badran village near Handwara, 80 km north of Srinagar, during a search operation.

 The army spokesman said a joint court of inquiry has also been asked to investigate the charges against the officer and DNA samples of the officer, the woman, her husband and their daughter were being sent to a forensic laboratory.

 The spokesman said the army chief, General N.C. Vij, has ordered that the court of inquiry ?should act expeditiously and suitable action corresponding to the degree of culpability will be taken?.

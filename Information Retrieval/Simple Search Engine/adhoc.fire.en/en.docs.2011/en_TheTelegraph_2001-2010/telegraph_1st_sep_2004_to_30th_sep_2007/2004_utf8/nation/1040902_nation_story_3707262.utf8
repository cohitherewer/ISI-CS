 Delay derails victory parade

 B.R. SRIKANTH

 Hubli, Sept. 1: The delay in Uma Bhartis release has upset the BJPs plans for celebrations here and the Vijayothsava in Bangalore in the evening.

 The courts decision to defer the case to Saturday also led to a change in .K. Advanis schedule. The leader of Opposition in Parliament, who had plans to meet Uma, returned to Delhi.

 In Bangalore, BJP leaders vowed to continue their dharna through the week to press for withdrawal of cases against Uma. Tomorrow, former Union minister Murli Manohar Joshi and other leaders will participate in the satyagraha.

 Advani, state unit chief Ananth Kumar, leader of the Opposition in the Assembly B.S. Yediyurappa, BJP spokesperson Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, senior Gujarat leader Kanshiram Rana and 20 MPs and 90 legislators from Gujarat, Chandigarh and Karnataka courted arrest in Bangalore and were released later.

 During the satyagraha, Advani said: When the ruling alliance threw a challenge to Bharti to quit the chief ministers post on the national flag issue in Parliament during the budget session last month, we accepted it on moral grounds and directed her to resign. Now we demand the tainted (Union) ministers, who were charged with murder, kidnapping, extortion and corruption, follow her and quit or be sacked from the UPA government.

 BJP chief M. Venkaiah Naidu, who shared the dais with Advani during the satyagraha, criticised the Karnataka government for precipitating matters. 

 This andolan (agitation) will continue till the UPA government restores the plaque of freedom fighter Veer Savarkar at the Cellular Jail in Port Blair and till the tainted ministers are dropped, he said.

 On September 8, former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee will address a rally in Bangalore, Naidu said.

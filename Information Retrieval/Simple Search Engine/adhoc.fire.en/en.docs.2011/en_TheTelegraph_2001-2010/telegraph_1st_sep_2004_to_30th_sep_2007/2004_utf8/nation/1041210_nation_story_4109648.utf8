 Porn suspect cries police pressure

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Jammu, Dec. 9: Former Miss Jammu Anara Gupta has retracted her confessional statements, saying these were made under police pressure.

 Anara, who was barred by Jammu and Kashmir High Court from speaking to the media about a fortnight ago, made the retraction in the form of a petition filed in court yesterday. The former Miss Jammu?s mother Raj Rani and her two brothers are co-petitioners.

 The beauty queen had been arrested over a month ago for alleged involvement in the production of pornographic compact discs and also in flesh trade.

 Anara and five others, including a Jammu cable operator, Narinder Kohli, were booked on November 4.

 The former beauty queen has moved court seeking damages of Rs 1 crore. She claims she has never acted in pornographic films and has charged the police with forcing her to tell the media that she did. She said she has acted only in television serials.

 Anara?s petition sought a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation and alleged that the police had kept her illegally confined and forced her to make the ?confessional? statements. The petition has sought the registration of a case against four police officers for the ?illegal? confinement of the former beauty queen from October 24 to November 4.

 The petition, which starts with the sequence of events from 4.57 am on October 24, also details the alleged physical torture and mental harassment of the former beauty queen and urged the court to initiate proceedings against the officers. 

 Anara and her co-petitioners have sought damages for breach of their fundamental rights. The family of the former beauty queen had demanded a CBI probe earlier, too. ?Our sister Anara is a victim, not a culprit or an accused as police have made out,? her brother Prince had said last month.

 ?This is a conspiracy against us. Why have not the police arrested the real culprits?? he had asked. Anara had said in media interviews earlier that she acted in a pornographic film ? that had been seized by the police ? in an attempt to get a foothold in films.

 ?I wanted to be a big star and I have paid the price,? she had said.

 Anara had reportedly told the police that Kohli had raped and then forced her into pornography with false promises of a break in Bollywood.

 The Jammu chief judicial magistrate had ordered judicial remand for Kohli last month and observed that Anara appeared more a victim than an accomplice, going by her police statement.

 The former beauty queen had also named some top officials, politicians, businessmen and journalists as being involved in the sleaze racket.

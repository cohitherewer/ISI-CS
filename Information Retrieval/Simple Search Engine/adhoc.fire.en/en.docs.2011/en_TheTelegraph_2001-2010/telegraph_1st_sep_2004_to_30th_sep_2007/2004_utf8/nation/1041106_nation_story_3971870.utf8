 Quota law setback

 New Delhi, Nov. 5 (PTI): The Supreme Court today dismissed an Andhra Pradesh legislation splitting the government job quota for Scheduled Castes among four sub-groups, dubbing it unconstitutional.

 A five-judge Constitution bench of Justices N. Santosh Hegde, S.N. Variava, B.P. Singh, H.K. Sema and S.B. Sinha gave the ruling while setting aside an Andhra Pradesh High Court verdict upholding the constitutional validity of the law.

 The state government had notified the Andhra Pradesh Scheduled Castes (Rationalisation of Reservation) Ordinance of December 9, 1999, categorising Scheduled Castes into four groups for dividing the 22.5 per cent reservation in government jobs. 

 The court allowed petitions challenging the high court order and said reservations must be considered from the social objective angle with regard to the constitutional scheme, and not as a political issue. 

 ?Thus, adequate representation must be given to the members of Scheduled Castes as a group and not to two or more groups of persons or members of castes,? the bench said.

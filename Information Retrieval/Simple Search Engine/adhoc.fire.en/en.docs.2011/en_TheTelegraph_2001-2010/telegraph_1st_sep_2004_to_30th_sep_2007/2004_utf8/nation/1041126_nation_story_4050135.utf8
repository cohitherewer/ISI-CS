 Last rites live on the Net

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Ahmedabad, Nov. 25: Bandwidth will soon overcome distance hurdles to last rites.

 A hi-tech crematorium ? the brainchild of Jagdish Thakkar ? that is to come up at Vadodara will allow people who cannot make it to a funeral to watch the last rites on the Net. ?The aim is to enable the family members, relatives and friends of the dead person to be with their relatives, virtually, during their time of grief,? said Thakkar, a Vadodara-based member of Rotary Club.

 The Moksha Dam, as the crematorium has been named, will have equipment for the live webcast of cremations through bandwidth connection provided by Reliance. The relatives of the deceased will also be able to send condolence messages from their homes.

 The Moksha Dam is a joint venture between the Vadodara Municipal Corporation, the Rotary Club and Indian Petrochemicals Corporation Limited ? a Reliance Group company. A memorandum of understanding for the crematorium, dedicated to Reliance founder Dhirubhai Ambani, will be signed next week.

 The crematorium ? equipped with all modern facilities ? will come up at an estimated cost of Rs 1 crore, which will be borne by IPCL, according to company spokesman Devendra Amin. 

 Work on the project, designed by leading architect Karan Grover, is likely to start by mid-December.

 Moksha Dam will be operational by May 31, 2005, said Thakkar, the project coordinator on behalf of Rotary Club, which has taken it up as a centenary project. Rotary Club will maintain the crematorium for five years from the date of commissioning.

 Thakkar said Reliance chairman Mukesh Ambani himself gave the green signal to this unique project when he proposed it at the IPCL general meeting on June 12. ?When I mooted the idea, Mukesh Ambani immediately told me to go ahead,? he said.

 The crematorium will be free of pollution with the ashes flowing directly into Vishwamitri river through a drainage system. The crematorium will have bath cottages and a prayer hall that can accommodate 1,000 people at a time.

 Moksha Dam, claimed Thakkar, will be a model that can be replicated.

 Staff rightsizing in IAF

 SUJAN DUTTA

 New Delhi, Oct. 6: The Indian Air Force is cutting down on staff even as it is asking the government to expedite acquisitions so that force levels of its fighter fleet are not further depleted.

 The IAF has already suspended recruitment in short service commission across all its branches for male candidates. Women were being recruited (in non-combat roles) in short service commission. This has been done because the IAF has overcome the manpower shortage it was faced with five years ago.

 Air Chief Marshal S. Krishnaswamy said non-combat manpower was expected to be down by about a third in the next five years. The air force has an officer cadre of about 11,300 and a workforce of about 1,50,000. The reduction of manpower would be mostly in the non-technical and non-combat category.

 IAF sources said the force was maintaining its annual ?churning? of manpower at about 7,000 ? about that number leaves the force and is recruited every year. In the last year, about 50 male candidates were recruited through short service commission.

 The ?rationalisation? of the manpower in the IAF would be done through diverting human resources and multi-skilling the non-technical staff. Krishnaswamy said that non-technical civilian personnel in the air force would also be assigned operational responsibilities.

 ?We do not want to make them surplus... manpower can be used like the navy uses on board its ships where everyone has an operational role...this could mean that a non-technical person may have to acquire technical skills, maybe like learning to use a shoulder-fired weapon,? the air chief said.

 The strength of the officer cadre would depend on ?cockpit vacancy?, that is on the requirement of combat personnel in relation to the number of aircraft in use.

 The air chief said the IAF was currently hard put to maintain its sanctioned strength of 39.5 squadrons. Krishnaswamy said efforts were on to acquire multi-role aircraft to replace the ageing MiG-21 squadrons. Air staff requirements for new acquisitions had been projected but the defence headquarters was still in the process of making requests for proposals from vendors.

 The Mirage 2000-V is said to be the frontrunner in a major IAF acquisition plan but the air chief would not give specifics. The contract for about six squadrons (about 125 aircraft) to be acquired over the next five to seven years could be as large as Rs 30,000 crore.

 The air chief said that the 39-squadron strength of the IAF was still below the objective of a 45-squadron force. He expected the new fighters to be inducted before the IAF decommissioned its nearly 300 MiG-21s that make up the bulk of its air defence fleet.

 Krishnaswamy also said that the accident rate in the IAF was at its lowest in more than three decades at 0.83 per thousand even if it was still higher than the ideal of 0.5.

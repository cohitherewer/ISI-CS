 Nod to Bodo truce

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 21: Delhi today gave the green signal to tripartite peace parleys with the National Democratic Front of Boroland.

 The ceasefire plan with the NDFB, which was initiated by Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi, got a boost from Union home minister Shivraj Patil. He endorsed Dispur?s initiative to engage the banned Bodo militant outfit in across-the-table negotiations.

 Patil announced that tripartite talks would be held between the NDFB and representatives from the Union home ministry and the Assam government. The Centre has also approved Gogoi?s suggestion to model the talks and the ceasefire ground rules on the system used for the Bodo Liberation Tigers (BLT) last year. Gogoi explained his plans for the ceasefire and the steps taken to implement last year?s agreement with the BLT to the Union home minister at an hourlong meeting today. 

 Gogoi described the NDFB to Patil as one of the most dangerous militant outfits in the state, emphasising that a ceasefire with this Bodo group was desirable for furthering the cause of peace. He however, is reported to have pointed out that the influence of the outfit has been waning among the people. 

 Gogoi also kept up his efforts to rope in the Ulfa for a dialogue. He spoke to litterateur Mamoni Raisom Goswami today, urging her to continue her efforts to mediate with Ulfa leaders who are ready to talk to the government.

 Gogoi later told mediapersons that the NDFB?s representatives and his government would start work on the ceasefire and the process for initiating talks shortly. As part of this, the ground rules for the ceasefire would also be contoured. 

 As Gogoi pointed out: ?So far there is a unilateral ceasefire from the NDFB in place. We have not announced a ceasefire so far.?

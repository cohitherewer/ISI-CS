 Court relief for Salman

 Mumbai, Nov. 23 (PTI): Salman Khan has been exempted from appearing in court in a hit-and-run case. 

 A Bandra court today also deferred the trial till December 20. 

 The court exempted the actor after Salman pleaded that he was busy shooting in Chennai. His lawyer Dipesh Mehta said case papers have not been transferred from the sessions court to the trial court and he was expecting this formality to be completed before December 20.

 Salman allegedly rammed his vehicle into a shop in Bandra on September 28, 2002, killing one person and injuring four. Police said he was under the influence of liquor at the time of the accident, a charge denied by the actor.

 Principal sessions judge R.R. Vachha had on June 9 transferred the case from the court of magistrate S.Y. Sishode to the court of additional chief magistrate J.B. Pankhe.

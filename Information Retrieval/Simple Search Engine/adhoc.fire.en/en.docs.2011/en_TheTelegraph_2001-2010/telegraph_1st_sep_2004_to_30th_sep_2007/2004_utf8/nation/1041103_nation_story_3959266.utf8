 Bangalore, Nov. 2: Name of the movie ? X and I. Protagonists: a sheep, humans and fleas.

 And no, it?s not just another cartoon film.

 If all goes well, X and I, India?s first 3D animation feature film with the highbrow theme of ?individualism versus collectivism? will be ready for release worldwide by next October.

 The 90-minute movie, with a multimillion-dollar budget, will be produced at the Bangalore-based Paprikaas Animation Studios (Pas) under the direction of Stanislao Pasqualini, an Italian director who has handled action movies.

 Pas co-founder and chief executive officer D. Nandish said the company has produced several animation tele-series for clients in Japan and Europe in Japanese, French and Spanish.

 According to Pas president Srini R. Raghavan, the movie would be a major milestone for the nascent Indian animation industry. ?We are doing the complete movie and not pieces and parts. It?s a serious film as opposed to cartoons. It?s about X, a sheep, humans and fleas that live off sheep. It is being produced for a premier studio in Europe, but I cannot disclose the name now. We will have the movie ready for release by October 2005,? he said.

 At a news conference earlier, Raghavan had said the project would have cost anywhere between $15-20 million if it were to be produced elsewhere. ?We are producing it in India at 50 to 60 per cent of the cost.?

 The company?s 120-odd animation specialists are spread over three centres ? Bangalore, Borgomanero, Italy, and Coraopolis (Pennsylvania) in the US.

 The company plans to ramp up the workforce to 300 in the next 12 to 18 months. ?Last year, we showed a year on year growth of 120 to 180 per cent. Most of our TV serials are nearing completion. They have a duration ranging from 30 to 45 minutes spanning 13 to 26 episodes. We are also planning to grow our business both organically and inorganically and are scouting for firms with good skills,? Raghavan said.

 Pas today announced its partnership with Carnegie Mellon University?s Entertainment Technology Centre for education and training programmes covering the entire gamut of digital animation, games, visual effects and entertainment. The training arm of Pas will be called the Paprikaas Animation, Game amp; Education Academy.

 The first course will be offered in mid-2005. ?Faculty from the ETC along with their content (course material) will train our employees and upgrade their skills in animation. This is the only way to ensure that the talent pool is created so that this industry can take off. All animation companies are moving from 2D to 3D animation,? Raghavan said.

 ?The idea is to penetrate the Hollywood market. By executing projects in India, we will be able to provide immense cost advantage. In order to be able to ensure that we do not miss out on this opportunity, we need to have a good talent pool.?

 Nandish said the Indian animation industry is in its ?infancy? but on its way to an ?explosive growth? over the next few years. ?Paprikaas is at the forefront of this evolution and we are building a strong company and an industry by training and educating the manpower,? he added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Look

 Sunday, December 12, 2004 

 Women politicians have often been 

 accused of not paying attention to the needs of their gender. 

 Well, guess who wants to be different? Vasundhara Raje, 

 that?s who! In order to do something meaningful on completion 

 of one year in power, this week the Rajasthan chief minister 

 announced not one, not two, but three welfare and development 

 schemes for women and children at a fair in Bhilwara. These 

 are, Janani Yojna, a scheme to help pregnant women ? both 

 financially and with non-fiscal assistance such as information 

 pertaining to healthcare, Sishu Palana Grah Yojna, which 

 is a care centre for the newborn, and Mahila Udhyam Byaj 

 Anudan Yojna, a plan to provide subsidy for women entrepreneurs. 

 ?The schemes will benefit lakhs of women in the state,? 

 Raje assured everyone present. Let?s hope so.

 The-33-per-cent-reservation-for-women-in-Parliament 

 issue seems to have reared its head again! This time the 

 one helping raise it is the Andhra Pradesh minister for 

 higher education, Pennamaneni Venkateswara Rao. Earlier 

 this week he announced that the Congress Party was ?committed 

 to working for welfare of women in the country, including 

 making provision of 33 per cent reservation for them in 

 Parliament and state assemblies?. Yeah? Well, in that case, 

 can everyone just stop talking about it and start doing 

 something to actually have it implemented?

 The Andhra Pradesh Mahila Samakhya, 

 as its name suggests, is a women?s rights organisation. 

 This week, it held a conference at Vijayawada during which 

 25 resolutions were passed. These mainly highlighted the 

 problems faced by women in the state, especially agriculture 

 workers. One of the resolutions, for instance, demanded 

 that every woman agriculture worker should be provided one 

 hectare of land. With a little luck, the resolution will 

 come into effect from January 2005. 

 Poor women, as mothers, bear 

 the brunt of malnutrition in children. With this belief, 

 and to find possible ways of eradicating hunger and malnutrition, 

 different NGOs and women?s groups across the world met at 

 a convention on ?Food Sovereignty? at Dhaka in Bangladesh 

 recently. Here, a workshop on ?Women and Rural Production? 

 provided the space for discussing the different problems 

 faced by women as ?food producers?. The participants reaffirmed 

 their commitment to continue to work for the broader struggle 

 for food sovereignty, freedom and justice. The slogan was, 

 ?We are women, we will unite, we will fight!?

 Why blame god?

 A United Nations estimate shows 

 that more than 5,000 women are murdered every year in ?honour-related? 

 violence, but the number could be higher. Experts speaking 

 at an international conference which ended in Stockholm 

 on Wednesday, pointed out that men all over the world, belonging 

 to different religions, distort the teachings of their holy 

 books to justify abusing their wives and daughters and even 

 killing them, with many courts providing them virtual impunity. 

 Their narration of horror stories of women and even girls 

 as young as seven being beheaded, burnt to death, maimed, 

 beaten, raped, forced into suicide or mentally abused underscored 

 that patriarchal violence against women pays no heed to 

 religion.

 that the head of Amnesty International, Irene Khan, said 

 recently, ?Women are raped and sexually tortured during 

 war because they are viewed as ?the reproductive machinery

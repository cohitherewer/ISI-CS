 NOTABLE ABSENTEE: Pervez Musharraf

 The BBC, which is clearly bored with the season of goodwill in the subcontinent, has just sparked off an Internet bidding war between Indians and Pakistanis.

 The BBC certainly likes to think of itself as the most superior show on earth (which, admittedly, it sometimes is) but one should never underestimate its ability to be mischievous. Among my circle of friends, acquaintances and relatives not on remand, we have been conducting a straw poll to discover the most idiotic BBC poll of all time. A strong contender is the BBC?s current poll urging people to ?vote for South Asia?s greatest-ever leader?.

 This is a follow-on from the poll to discover ?the greatest Briton of all time?. Various personalities appeared on television to make a pitch for their candidate. In the end, the poll was won by Churchill. 

 I am sorry we were denied the chance to vote for other great Britons, giants who have changed the course of the meandering river of history ? David Beckham or even his wife, Posh Spice; David Blunkett; Fergie, the Duchess of York; Robin Hood; Robin Cook; butler Paul Burrell; Ian Botham; Christine Keeler and Liz Taylor, to name but a few.

 Since the BBC is trying to find the greatest leader from South Asia, it has had to offer rival candidates from all the countries in the region. The teams from India (Vajpayee, Indira Gandhi, Nehru, Mahatma Gandhi, Netaji) and Pakistan (Jinnah, Bhutto, Zia-ul Haq) are strong on paper but things could go either way in a day-night poll.

 Bangladesh is represented by Sheikh Mujib and Ziaur Rahman; Sri Lanka by Jayawardene and Chandrika Kumaratunga; while the minnows, Afghanistan and Nepal, have Ahmad Shah Masood and King Zahir Shah, and B.P. Koirala.

 I know what you are thinking. Where, in all this, are the other towering personalities who have shaped the destiny of over a billion people ? Sourav Ganguly, Imran Khan, Kareena Kapoor, Alyque Padamsee, the Big B, umpire Shakoor Rana, Harshad Mehta, Brother Osama (Afghan by naturalisation), and my own favourite, on whose behalf I would like to appear on television, old Mushie himself?

 I will e-mail multiple votes, as per South Asian custom and practice, for the uniformed General. Without him, as Bush would say, there would be no democracy in Pakistan and no Indo-Pakistan cricket. And Sehwag wouldn?t have got his 300.

 COURAGE OF CONVICTION: Narasimha Rao

 Indians in England are desperately keen for the big names from Bollywood to come to London to tread the boards in the West End in the style of Hollywood stars who take massive salary cuts to appear in British theatre.

 The list of those who have come from America to act in the best theatre in the world is long ? from Dustin Hoffman to Jessica Lange, Calista Flockhart, Kathleen Turner and Nicole Kidman. Kevin Spacey stayed on to become the artistic director of the Old Vic.

 No drama group anywhere has the prestige of the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC), which has taken great strides in casting black and Asian actors in what were previously regarded as ?white roles?. I remember a black Romeo in the past. In the current production of Romeo amp; Juliet, which has replaced Hamlet at the Albery Theatre in St Martin?s Lane, Escalus, Prince of Verona, is a black actor, Leo Wringer. 

 This is an indication of how much Britain has progressed, both in terms of colour-blind casting and as a multicultural society, that no one now thinks anything of it.

 In this case, Romeo and Juliet are played by Matthew Rhys and Sian Brooke, who are both white. Brooke is a pretty blonde, who has to make the transition from a 12-year-old girl to a woman after a night of love with Romeo. 

 The kissing scenes on the balcony ? ?lip lock? in modern Mumbai parlance, though I absolutely loathe that expression ? are full of passion.

 Actually, the RSC, which is nothing if not experimental, would probably be willing to cast Bollywood stars such as Kareena as Juliet and similar lead roles ? providing they can act and agree to rigorous rehearsals. It would bring in new Asian audiences.

 But would Kareena be willing, if the director so wished, to kiss and be kissed (even if there were Indians in the audience with sneaky mobile phone cameras)?

 ?That,? as Hamlet wondered last time round, ?is the question?.

 Sir Nicholas Fenn, The former British high commissioner in India, whom I had wanted to consult earlier on Rao?s legacy, got round to ringing me back last week.

 Fenn?s five-year tenure in Delhi coincided ?almost exactly? with the years 1991 to 1996, when Rao was ushering in economic reform as Prime Minister of India.

 Fenn retains a high opinion of Rao, whom he met often enough, as he does of Manmohan Singh, the finance minister whom he also got to know pretty well.

 ?Manmohan Singh was the architect of economic reform,? is Fenn?s view. ?But he couldn?t have done it without the Prime Minister. Rao had the courage to recognise that India had reached a real (economic) crisis, and, as he told me, he ?couldn?t shilly-shally with disaster?. Narasimha Rao had the courage to jettison 40 years of Nehruvian inheritance and set India on a new course.?

 And that is a certificate-and-a-half from one of Britain?s best diplomats in the past 50 years.

 ?Narasimha Rao deserves better from Indians than he is likely to get,? reflects Fenn, whom I remember affectionately as ?Nick?, head of the foreign office news department in London. ?This is because his time was overshadowed by a particular issue (that of bribery and corruption). He is undervalued in India.?

 Fenn has now retired to a very English life in a Kent village, though he pops up now and again on the Indian scene. Eccentric in a nice English way, he will not have e-mail in his house.

 The Bollywood actor, who was in danger of being deported from the UK for not possessing the proper work permit, tells me: ?I shall crack open several bottles of champagne over Christmas and well into the New Year. The home secretary has just granted me leave to remain and permission to work in Britain.?

 The whole process has been painfully protracted. This is one visa application that David Blunkett certainly didn?t fast-track.

 This year, he appears to have cut down on Christmas cards, not even sending them by e-mail (a terrible practice) or posting rubber-stamped ones without personal signatures, which show poor manners on the part of Indian corporate types.

 However, having overspent on steel acquisitions, wedding parties, mansions, jet fuel and Labour party donations, it does make sense to cut down on Christmas cards.

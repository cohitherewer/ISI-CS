 AMIT ROY

 TO BE OR NOT TO 

 BE: Toby Stephens as Hamlet with Meg Fraser as Ophelia 

 All the world?s a Bollywood 

 stage

 The other day, while watching 

 a three-and-a-half-hour play at the Albery Theatre in St 

 Martin?s Lane in London, I got this idea for a Bollywood 

 film. I know the plot is more than a little melodramatic, 

 even by the standards of Hindi movies, but it would go something 

 like this. 

 The Maharajah of the rotten state 

 of Din Marg has been pushed out of the window of his apartment 

 in Modibhavan. A bhoot, clothed in a white dhoti, warns 

 the Yuvraj, Hum Late, that the dastardly deed has been committed 

 by his uncle-cum-underworld goonda, Kala Das, who has added 

 lust to his sins by marrying his newly-widowed sister-in-law, 

 Gauri Sood. 

 The wretched Yuvraj, who cannot 

 get his girlfriend, Awfuleeya, to sleep with him ? even 

 though she is a wheat-complexioned modern Indian girl drawing 

 five-figure salary with own car and flat ? cries out in 

 anguish: ?2B or not 2B. Is it nobler to get the Metro or 

 suffer the slings and arrows of the bandh? To sleep, perchance 

 to dream. Alas, poor Ambanis, I knew them well.? 

 If this all sounds as skilfully 

 crafted as one of Subhash Ghai?s blockbusters, I can only 

 say that William Shakespeare?s Hamlet and almost everything 

 over-the-top scripted by the Bard anticipated Bollywood 

 by 400 years. 

 So, it seems entirely appropriate 

 that a fine English actor such as Toby Stephens should be 

 playing Hamlet one moment in a Royal Shakespeare Company 

 (RSC) production ? as he is in sell-out performances at 

 the Albery ? and be admired early next year as ?Captain 

 Gordon? opposite Aamir Khan?s Mangal Pandey in The Rising. 

 Toby, 35, is the son of Dame Maggie 

 Smith and the late Robert Stephens, has distinguished himself 

 in a number of RSC productions, played the baddie in the 

 Bond film, Die Another Day, and the notorious British spy, 

 Kim Philby, in the TV series, Cambridge Spies. 

 I thought his Hamlet, tortured, 

 camp and heroic in turn, was magnificent. 

 Bobby Bedi and Ketan Mehta are 

 fortunate to have got Toby for The Rising. But judging by 

 Toby?s melodramatic performance in Hamlet, it is not too 

 far-fetched to suggest he has returned richer from India. 

 All the world really is a stage 

 on which actors can transcend cultural boundaries.

 ROLE PLAY: Alastair Niven 

 (top) and Vincent Ebrahim

 Mulk?s Raj

 It was an obvious thing to say 

 but Alastair Niven, the literary critic, said it. Had Mulk 

 Raj Anand lived until December 12 this year, he would have 

 been 99 ? and 100 had he lived until December 12, 2005. 

 At a Nehru Centre function last 

 week, where the British Asian theatre company, Man Mela, 

 presented a ?dramatised celebration? of Mulk Raj Anand?s 

 work, Niven predicted: ?In 100 years? time, his books will 

 still be read.? 

 The actress Douad Faress read 

 extracts from Conversations in Bloomsbury and Seven 

 Summers, while a number of actors, including Vincent 

 Ebrahim and Raj Ghatak, performed sketches from Across 

 the Black Waters and Little Plays of Mahatma Gandhi. 

 The author, when London-based, 

 met Gandhi at his ashram in Gujarat and switched to Indian 

 clothes after the Mahatma chided him for dressing ?like 

 a monkey?. At Gandhi?s instigation, he completely rewrote 

 the manuscript of his debut novel and simplified the language 

 of Bhaka, the sweeper boy. 

 Untouchable, published 

 in 1935, ?has been continuously in print since then?, Niven 

 pointed out. 

 Gandhi was clearly a shrewd judge 

 of English prose as well. Had he lived today, he could easily 

 have earned a reasonable living in London, pocketing ?1,000 

 a time writing book reviews for one of the big newspapers.

 Fond memories

 Dev Anand has been everywhere, 

 done and seen everything and got the T-shirt to prove it 

 but he still retains an infectious delight in life. 

 When the name of Anil Ambani?s 

 wife, Tina Munim, came up, as it tends to these days, he 

 remembered: ?I introduced her in Des Pardes.? 

 That was in 1979 when Tina was 

 tiny ? only 16. 

 I had been to a Mulk Raj Anand 

 evening, I told Devsaab when I met him and his son, Suniel, 

 for dinner. 

 ?Yes, I was in Rahi in 1953, a 

 film based on his novel,? he said. ?It was shot in Coonoor 

 in south India, which was meant to be the tea gardens of 

 Assam. The film was made in two versions.? 

 The following year, Dev Anand 

 and his brother Chetan, Raj Kapoor, Nargis and Balraj Sahni 

 were part of a 14-member delegation to the Soviet Union. 

 ?This was the first delegation to the Soviet Union. Eight 

 hundred prints each of my film and Raj Kapoor?s Aawara were 

 released in all the languages of the Soviet republic. The 

 warmth of the people was overwhelming.? 

 Later, I checked the reference 

 for Rahi, and, sure enough, it was directed in 1953 by Khwaja 

 Ahmad Abbas. The Hindi/ English film, also known as The 

 Wayfarer, was 139 minutes long, and the cast included Dev 

 Anand (former army officer), Nalini Jaywant (Ganga), S. 

 Michael (English tea plantation manager) and Balraj Sahni. 

 The film, about a poor tea planter 

 in Assam, was based on Mulk Raj Anand?s 1937 novel, Two 

 Leaves and a Bud. 

 City of joy

 My old mate Salman Rushdie, accompanied 

 by his bibi, has chosen to visit Calcutta in my absence, 

 I note. Actually, I share his enthusiasm for New York but 

 at the risk of being called biased, I have got to say this: 

 intellectually, Calcutta is a lot livelier ? and nosier. 

 At any rate, more people will have read his stuff. 

 As we like to say when bidding 

 goodbye at Netaji Subhas International Airport: ?Please 

 come again ? soon.? 

 Two?s company

 Two Indian schoolgirls, Gayathri 

 Kumar, 13, and Nisha Abraham Thomas, were champion and runner-up 

 in the BBC?s Hard Spell contest from a field of 10,000 children 

 aged 11-14. 

 No wonder Indians are going around 

 with insufferable ?I told you so? looks. 

 Queen Bee

 So, it came to pass last week 

 that the senior businessman Dr Kartar Lalvani, president 

 and CEO of Vitabiotics, handed over his ?Asian of the Year? 

 title, which is conferred annually by the publishers of 

 Who?s Who of Asians in Britain, to Ramola Bachchan 

 for her charity work over many years. 

 Now that the Queen Bee intends 

 to spend much of the year in Delhi, I fear the Kir Royale 

 will no longer be served at her Hampstead home but in the 

 Indian capital. 

 Tittle tattle

 President Musharraf was bowled 

 some friendly full tosses by presenter Kirsty Wark on BBC 

 TV?s Newsnight. But at one point in the interview, the President-cum-army 

 chief of Pakistan was stumped. 

 When the Pakistani cricket team 

 tours England, should British Pakistanis cheer for the English 

 players or the Pakistanis, Musharraf was asked. 

 ?That?s a difficult one,? confessed 

 Pakistan?s non-playing captain, a characteristic he frequently 

 shares with our own Sourav. 

 His face broke into a guilty smile 

 as he tried to wriggle out of answering what is called ?the 

 Norman Tebbit test? of loyalty to England. 

 ?When people get a visa (residency 

 right), it doesn?t mean their loyalties change overnight,? 

 he said. ?Anyway, why make such a big issue of it!? 

 Even now, I can see Clive Lloyd 

 reaching for the red light.

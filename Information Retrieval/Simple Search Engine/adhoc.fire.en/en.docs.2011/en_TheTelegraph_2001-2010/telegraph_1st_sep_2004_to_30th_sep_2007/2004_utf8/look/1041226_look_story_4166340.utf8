The Telegraph - Calcutta : Look

 Sunday, December 26, 2004 

 The day after tomorrow, at a seminar in the Conference Room of the Academy of Fine Arts, Calcutta, participants will argue for and against legalising prostitution. According to organisers Sanhita, the city-based NGO working with sex workers, the discussion will focus on how both sides can be seen to explore the topic from a feminist point of view. 

 Such questions as ?Does a woman?s ?right to own her own body? mean that she is free to sell it in the marketplace??, ?Can selling sex be equated to or compared with selling any other skill?? and ?Is violence faced by women in prostitution a form of violence against women?? are expected to be debated. Those interested should call up: 2216 1471 or 2284 5525. 

 As high as 21 per cent of Indian women have experienced some form of violence from the age of 15, a new report released this week says. The report, ?Violence against women: health sector perspective?, part of a national family health survey, says that among women who report physical abuse, nine out of 10 have been beaten by their husbands, one out of seven by other persons, and one out of 12 by their in-laws. The study stresses that abused women face serious reproductive and sexual health complications and that therefore the issue must be addressed as a public health concern. Let?s hope 2005 sees to it. 

 China?s first women?s rights protection centre has now opened a branch in Shanghai, to help women who are victims of family violence or think their husbands are cheating on them. Since the centre opened its first office in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, its employees have been dubbed ?mistress killers? by the media, because they help suspicious wives prove their husbands? infidelity. The cost of each case depends on a client?s financial situation. And poverty-stricken women often get free service. 

 Several women?s organisations are accusing the health ministry of forcing unacceptable population control measures on rural women in the name of health. The two-child policy, which was a policy of incentives and disincentives, they claim, is arbitrary, used coercive measures and went against the national population policy (NPP) of 2000. A memorandum was presented to the Prime Minister, listing their objections to the policy, and according to Brinda Karat of the All India Democratic Women?s Association, the PM has agreed that family size should be a choice of the family. 

What a sport!

 Mexican men?s soccer club, Celaya, has signed on a new player, Maribel Dominguez. Nothing surprising about that except that Dominguez is a woman. And that is what last week prompted soccer?s governing body FIFA to insist that regulations require a clear separation between men?s and women?s football. Though Celaya will not appeal against the ruling, Celaya vice-president, Maurico Ruiz, voiced his disappointment at a news conference. He said, ?Mexico wanted to be a pioneer in this. It wasn?t achieved.? Dominguez acknowledged that FIFA?s decision stung, but she said she would look for other opportunities while continuing to play. ?Logically, yes, it has caused some sadness,? she said. ?But at the same time too, yes, I respect decisions. If it?s a ?no?, well it?s a ?no?. This is not going to affect my career.? Atta sport!

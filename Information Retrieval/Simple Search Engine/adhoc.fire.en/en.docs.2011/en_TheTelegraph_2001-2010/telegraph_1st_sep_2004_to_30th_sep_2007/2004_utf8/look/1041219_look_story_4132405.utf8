AMIT ROY

 BOOK MARK: The cover of Rao?s The Insider

Promoting the insider

Perhaps I can reveal some harmless trade secrets, 

one being that British newspapers, unlike some of their Indian counterparts, make 

a big deal of ?obits? ? shorthand for obituaries.

Old boys in gentlemen?s clubs apparently joked: ?The 

first thing I do in the morning is glance through the obits columns of The Times. 

If I am not in there, I get up.?

There is also the case of the ailing Nizam of Hyderabad, 

who was prematurely killed off by The Times. When the error was discovered, The 

Times apologised. Then the Nizam passed away.

I once attended the retirement party for a distinguished 

obituaries editor whose editor remarked: ?My dear man, people were always dying 

to get into your columns.?

All newspapers keep ?set and keep obits? on most dignitaries 

since news of their death often breaks inconveniently minutes before deadline. 

Everyone will hope that P.V. Narasimha Rao makes a complete recovery but his critical 

illness caught papers here on the hop.

It is relatively easy to find the highlights of his 

career ? born June 28, 1921, Prime Minister (1991-1996), twice external affairs 

minister, defence minister and chief minister of Andhra Pradesh ? but for Britishers 

it is harder to make an assessment of his legacy. Also, there isn?t much ?human 

interest stuff?on him.

He came to the Nehru Centre once to promote his novel, 

The Insider. There is a sexy passage or two in this book, which is given over 

otherwise to the gripping subject of land reform. I know he was not pleased when 

an Indian woman asked him innocently: ?Is the sex from your imagination or your 

memory??

British politicians, on the other hand (e.g. Edwina 

Currie, Douglas Hurd), love to talk about the sexy bits in their novels because 

they know sex sells.

P.V. Narasimha Rao?s reputation has been tarnished 

by the charges of corruption. But it is fair to say that although the process 

of economic liberalisation began with Indira Gandhi and continued under Rajiv, 

opening India up to globalisation might not have happened in the way it did without 

him. As such, the country does owe him a lot.

I don?t want this to sound like an obit but just before 

he paid a visit to Britain 10 years ago, he told me in an interview that he would 

move India at a pace that suited India, not Western investors: ?I will not take 

rash decisions to conform to a theoretical framework which may lead to large-scale 

unemployment and runaway inflation.?

I do believe Madame Tussaud?s has been unkind in melting 

down his waxwork model.

Nanny state

Indian servants in India are part of the social fabric 

and quite often, they do become part of the family. But in London, in the homes 

of rich Indians, I find the practice of importing them to this country totally 

objectionable. 

One up from maidservants are the nannies brought in 

from south Asia to enable Western women to pursue their careers. To be blunt about 

it, those who cannot be bothered to look after their children employ nannies. 

I do appreciate the eternal juggling act between home 

and career but, really, one woman?s sexual emancipation is another woman?s slavery. 

I am not saying that the Filipina 37-year-old nanny, Leoncia ?Luz? Casalme, at 

the centre of the Blunkett affair, was badly treated by her mistress, Kimberly 

Quinn nee Fortier, the American publisher of The Spectator.

But once, when her mistress shouted at her, the nanny 

protested: ?Please don?t yell at me, I am not your slave.?

Such a relationship can be, at best, unequal. Still, 

in England, the situation for nannies is infinitely better than, say, in the Arab 

world, where ayahs from Kerala and Sri Lanka are routinely molested by their employers. 

So far, the UN hasn?t recognised that the traffic 

in nannies represents a new form of slavery.

Battle of Britain

The flight path to India is paved with gold. Despite 

a carve-up of the 21 new direct weekly flights from London to India, the battle 

between Sir Richard Branson?s Virgin Atlantic and British Airways, who are less 

friendly than even the Ambani brothers, continues.

Both airlines are appealing against the adjudication 

of the Civil Aviation Authority, which has awarded seven of the flights to British 

Airways (four to Chennai and three to Bangalore, a new route), 10 to Virgin (seven 

to Delhi and three to Mumbai) and four to British Midland (all to Mumbai).

British Airways already has 19, so its total will 

go up to 26. But it says it has to compete against Lufthansa and Emirates, which 

have indirect services to India, and, as Britain?s national carrier, should have 

been given all 21.

Branson argues that his is the only airline capable 

of challenging the BA domination of the market, but with only 10 flights, he is 

?fighting with one hand tied behind my back?.

When his inaugural flight landed in Delhi, he ran 

down the aircraft steps declaring himself to be ?Bran Singh?. The inaugural flight 

to Mumbai next spring will, I am informed, ?have a Bollywood theme? ? maybe Branson 

decked out as Bachchan.

Stowe gals

Among British public schools, Stowe in Buckinghamshire 

arguably has the most beautiful grounds in all England.

Its old boys and girls include Sir Richard Branson, 

and, more recently, Dev Anand?s leading lady in Mr Prime Minister, Khursheed 

Khurody. She is holidaying in Britain with another girl from Stowe, Virginia Holmes, 

who is part of the growing number of English women working in Bollywood.

In Virginia?s case, it is as a make up artist ? she 

has worked on several TV ads (Close-up toothpaste, 7-up), music videos plus films 

such as Lakshya, Mira Nair?s Vanity Fair in Jodhpur, and The 

Rising when she looked after Aamir Khan in Tajikistan.

Unlike Bollywood heroines, who will not allow anyone 

other than their personal make up artists near them, she found Aamir remarkably 

receptive to her suggestions.

?I have a lot of time for him,? says Virginia, who 

first went to India in her ?gap year? between school and Exeter University. ?He 

asks a lot of questions and is very respectful.?

Make up and what constitutes beauty are subjects on 

which Virginia has strong views. She thinks Indian make up artists are excellent 

but the tendency is perhaps to slap on too much.

?I am not saying Bollywood is bad, just different,? 

she says.

NEW ROLE: Gopal Gandhi

She considers BBC make up artists, from whom she received 

part of her training, to be ?the best in the world?. Her view is that Hrithik 

Roshan ?has a nice skin? and does not require masses of make up and Aishwarya 

Rai, with minimal make up in Chokher Bali looked more beautiful than in 

the run-of-the-mill Bollywood extravaganzas. 

?In Britain,? Virginia points out, ?less is more.?

Tittle tattle

Friends of Gopal Gandhi in Britain are delighted he 

has become governor of West Bengal. Since he cut quite a dash as director of the 

Nehru Centre in London, many feel he is their man in Calcutta. When he was here, 

he bore the burden of being the Mahatma?s 13th and youngest grandchild, with great 

courage.

 Sigourney Weaver

Look who?s talking

 Fancy strolling through Manhattan and listening to Sigourney Weaver drawl on about the wonders of New York? Well, that?s just been made possible with Talking Street, a series of walking tours through the city, where the stars voice in on your mobile phone and talk to you as you make your way forward. While Weaver and Jeremy Stiller have signed up for the New York tours, journalist Larry King will help you out on the soon-to-be-launched Washington D.C. tour. Pegged at $6, the tours have been planned by Miles Kronby, who thinks that such tours will become even more popular as talktime charges go down. And with camera phones, things can only get more adventurous. 

 Jude law likes things 

 up close and personal. The star recently landed up at 

 a sleazy club, apparently promoting his new movie Closer, 

 which has Natalie Portman as a poledancer. Instead, 

 he ended up getting a lap dance from a really hot performer. 

 Cool promo, that?ll make!

Get this, dude

 There?s no way you can miss this. 

 Scott Kiesling, a linguist at the University of Pittsburg, 

 has entered the heart of cooldom and deconstructed one of 

 its most prevalent catchphrases ? ?dude?, which can define 

 anyone from a surfer to a stripling. Kiesling?s paper tries 

 to prove that ?dude? derives its popularity from something 

 he calls cool solidarity ? a not-too-intimate, social bond 

 between young people. For his research paper, he went back 

 to old taped conversations, as well as data he collected 

 from undergrads who kept a tally of the first 20 times they 

 heard ?dude? in a day. The paper reportedly shows that men 

 use the phrase more than women. It?s used least to refer 

 to parents.

 Smoke screen

 Doctor Tanvir Reza is a man on 

 a mission. He has started Kolkata Action on Smoking and 

 Health, reportedly the first clinic in the city devoted 

 to ?curing? smokers of their habit. The programme begins 

 from the 1st Sunday of January, and plans to tackle the 

 problem of addicts. Dr Reza is visiting schools to get youngsters 

 involved.

Lap it up

 This is a history lesson that?ll 

 raise the spirits of every budding tippler. Researchers 

 have traced the history of winemaking to 7,000 BC to the 

 village of Jiahu in the northern Chinese province of Henan. 

 Before this finding the ancestry of alcohol was only around 

 seven-and-a -half thousand years old ? the evidence came 

 from a neolithic site in Iran. But tests on pottery shards 

 now found in Jiahu have shown traces of a drink prepared 

 from a combination of rice, honey and grapes. Jiahu is in 

 the Yellow River basin ? a location famous for its rich 

 archaeological relics. So there?s more to ancient China 

 than just silk and paper.

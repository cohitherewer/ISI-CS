 Robosapien

Dance like a robot

 This chap has been giving Barbie sleepless nights for some time now, because Christmas shoppers can?t keep their hands off him. Called Robosapien, the toy has already sold over 180,000 pieces this festive season in the UK. The female version of it can apparently comb the owner?s hair and hug the male robot when asked to do so. The fellas even rap, dance, talk and land a few kung fu kicks if necessary. And all of this comes for a neat ?80. But according to Mark Tilden, the inventor of Robosapien, this is just the beginning. Robosapien 2, due for release in February, will unleash a fresh set of wonders. Maybe it will scratch your back as well.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro

Love in a time of homophobia

Bharat Too

 Sandhu Colony in Amritsar has just witnessed a marriage 

in which nobody wears the pants. 

Avijit Ghosh reports

Sandhu Colony isn?t the shining side of Amritsar. 

Rife with fetid garbage dumps, pesky bylanes and carelessly cobbled houses, it 

is the sort of place that seems to have fallen off the map of townplanners. But 

for the town?s tumbleweed underclass ? the sweepers and the peons, the motor mechanics 

and the small shopkeepers ? this is both their heart and home, the place where 

they anonymously lead their nondescript lives.

This lowly mohalla of invisible people ? where 

most women still dutifully watch the K-serials and where men firmly disapprove 

of movies like Girlfriend ? is also home to Raju and Mala, the city?s first 

openly lesbian couple. When the two women ran away from home last month, the city 

newspapers front-paged their story. Now that they have returned and are staying 

together, their private lives have been subject to intense media scrutiny. One 

local journalist even proudly claimed having asked the couple about their sexual 

life during ?those days? ? a euphemism for periods.

The neighbours have been less callous. But, undeniably, 

the couple is the neighbourhood?s talking point. For, while urban India is aware 

and slowly accepting same-sex couples, in small-town India, a lesbian couple is 

more of an oddity. When sitting in his Lawrence Road office, senior corporate 

Bimal Sharma just shrugs his shoulders and says, ?Everybody should have a freedom 

of choice. And they have made theirs. So what?s wrong?? he represents a minority 

view.

Away in the bylanes of Sandhu Colony, it is a different 

story. A mood of sullen resentment prevails there. Fear, displeasure, exasperation, 

resentment ? the mohalla is a collage of emotions that come out in conversation. 

When one argument goes as far as this ? ?The government will never oppose these 

girls. After all, such behaviour helps in population control? ? one feels that 

there is a bit of heterosexual paranoia at work.

Scooter mechanic Vinod Khokar feels that the two girls 

? Raju, or Rajwinder, is 20 and Mala 19 ? are sending out a wrong message to the 

next generation. ?They have set a wrong precedent,? he says. Army havaldar 

on holiday, Balwant Singh, is of the view that the girls are imitating Western 

culture. ?Everyone thinks what the girls have done is wrong,? says his wife Rajwant. 

Khokar?s wife sums up the mohalla?s mood. ?We don?t like what they have 

done. But what can we do??

There is nothing to be done, especially since the 

law has stood by the girls. When Raju and Mala were presented before the duty 

magistrate last week on the basis of complaints of kidnapping filed by the police, 

the girls passionately argued their own case. The court said that since both were 

adults, they could live together at their own free will. No authority could summon 

them.

Life has never been more beautiful for the girls, 

now together in Raju?s home. Dressed in a red salwar kurta, Mala looks 

like any newly-wed girl in Punjab; she is wearing 33 bangles on each hand. On 

Tuesday, they went with their family to Gurdwara Beed Baba Budha Saheb in Chabbal, 

a must-visit shrine for every newly-wed couple, situated about 25 kilometres from 

the city of the Golden Temple. ?People recognised the girls. But nobody said anything,? 

says Raju?s mother, Ranjeet Kaur.

Kaur is firmly supportive of her daughter now. Not 

long ago, she had dragged Raju by her hair and beaten her up when she found out 

that her only child was more than just friends with the attractive Mala, a hospital 

helper?s daughter who lived just a few homes away.

It was the time Mala, too, had discovered her love 

for the boyish Raju, who could ride a motorcycle. ?When I saw her being beaten 

up, I wept for hours. Then, I asked myself why I wept so much. I knew then, I 

was in love. I confess that I love Raju more than I ever loved my father or my 

brothers,? she says.

The ardour was equally intense from the other side. 

When Mala?s parents got her to be engaged and set a marriage date for her, Raju 

? who has Mala tattooed on her right hand in Hindi ? tried to commit suicide by 

consuming poison. If these women are not in love, nobody ever was. ?I never thought 

of the way the society would react. I just followed my heart,? says Raju, dressed 

in a khaki shirt and blue trousers.

Now Raju ? she, like Mala, has studied up to Class 

X ? is looking for a job. Any job. She is even willing to drive the tractor her 

father owns to help him keep the home fires burning. During their brief runaway 

phase, she had worked as a salesperson.

Not everybody has adjusted to the reality. A few days 

ago, Mala?s relatives threatened Raju?s family with dire consequences if they 

did not return the girl. ?We went to the police but they have taken no action,? 

complains Raju?s father, Mukhtar Singh, who transports soil on his tractor for 

a living. But the police officers contend that there is no cause for alarm. ?We 

will take action when we feel that the family?s life or property is in danger,? 

assures deputy superintendent of police, Ashish Kapoor.

But for the girls, nothing really matters. Nothing 

but the comfort of each other?s company. It doesn?t matter to them whether their 

runaway marriage, conducted before a priest in New Delhi, has any legal validity 

or not. For them, it was just a form of messaging their relatives of their strong 

intent, their unwavering desire to be with each other. Says Raju, ?Come what may, 

we will be with each other. Always and forever.? Mala smiles coyly and rushes 

inside.

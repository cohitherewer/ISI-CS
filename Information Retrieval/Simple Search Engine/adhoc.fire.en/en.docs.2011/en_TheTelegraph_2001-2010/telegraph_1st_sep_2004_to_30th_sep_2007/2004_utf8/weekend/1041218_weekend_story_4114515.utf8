Ol? to olives

 PREAH NARANG 

 Stuffed or tossed in dishes, olives taste great in every way 

Olives have been a symbol of peace since ancient times. This fruit dates back to the 17th century BC when it first appeared in print in Egyptian records and was mentioned numerous times in the Bible. The word comes from the Latin ?olivea?, which first appeared in English around 1200 A.D. 

Olives are native to the Mediterranean and Italy and Spain are its world?s largest producers. The olive tree was introduced to California in the 18th century by the Spaniards, where they flourished. In the late 19th century, a professor of the University of California invented a method of canning olives, thus ensuring their year-round availability. 

The only difference between green olives and black olives is the ripeness. Unripe olives are green and fully ripe olives are black. Olives are cured or pickled before consumption, using various methods including oil-cured, water-cured, brine-cured, dry-cured, and lye-cured. The longer the olive is permitted to ferment in its own brine, the less bitter and more intense its flavor will become. Green olives are usually pitted, and often stuffed with various fillings, including almonds, onions, anchovies, jalap?nos or capers. Black olives are graded into sizes like small, medium, large, extra-large and supercolossal. Black olives contain more oil than green. 

Tips for storing: 

 An unopened jar of olives can be stored in 

a cool, dark place for up to a year. After opening, store them in the refrigerator 

for no more than a month. 

 Never refrigerate canned olives in the can 

because the metal tarnishes the taste. Transfer them to an airtight glass jar 

instead. 

 Store bulk olives in an airtight jar covered 

with vegetable oil and place them in the refrigerator. 

 One way to quickly remove olive pits is by 

placing the olives between towels and rolling over them with a rolling pin.

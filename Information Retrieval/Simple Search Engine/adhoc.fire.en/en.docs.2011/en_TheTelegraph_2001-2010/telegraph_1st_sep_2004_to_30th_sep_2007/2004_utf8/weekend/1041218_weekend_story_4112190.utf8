The Telegraph - Calcutta : Weekend

 My Weekend

Long, leisurely weekends seem to be a part of my very 

distant past. I can?t remember spending a laid-back Saturday and Sunday with friends 

and family for several months now because of my film commitments. Right now, I 

am inundated with work as I am designing costumes for Rani Mukherjee and Amitabh 

and Abhishek Bachchan for the Shaad Ali film, Bunty Aur Babli.

But a perfect Saturday dawns with me waking up really 

late. I am rarely at home so this is truly a luxury. I potter around the house 

doing very little and usually call up a few close friends and fix a time to meet 

them at some happening coffee bar. Saturday night always swings and we usually 

end up at a party or a lounge bar where we spend a few hours catching up.

 Yet another late start on Sunday and I?m ready for 

a leisurely brunch with special friends. I try and catch a film in the theatre 

as I am a die-hard movie buff. And there?s nothing to beat the joy of joining 

serpentine queues for tickets (or the cheap thrills of getting them off the black 

market).

Sometimes I make a stop in the market and buy prawns 

and fish and make a meal of it later. I must confess that I am quite a good cook 

and enjoy getting into the kitchen on the occasional Sunday. I have friends over 

at least once a month and I try and do all the cooking myself (though I can?t 

handle more than eight to 10 people at a time). Weekends are not just a time for 

chilling out but also time for rejuvenating for the week ahead.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Weekend

 The art of marriage 

Be it in their work or their personal life, Hema and 

Chintan Upadhyay always paint a picture of togetherness 

Family Ties

Hema Hirani now Upadhyay, was born in Baroda and 

did her BFA and MFA from the Baroda Faculty of Fine Arts. She claims that her 

creative urges come from material things and daily life. As an emerging artist, 

Hema uses painting and sculpture to explore the theme of identity. She has held 

several shows around the country and will soon travel to Japan, where she will 

exhibit her matchstick chandelier titled ?Loco-Foco-Motto?. 

Sharing her love for the arts is her husband of 

six years, Chintan, who hails from Partapur in Rajasthan. Also an artist, Chintan 

and Hema were classmates for four years before they decided to get married. Though 

Chintan is presently in the UK learning and exploring various new media, the husband-wife 

duo has worked together on several occasions. One of their famous joint efforts 

is the one they did for Portraits Decade for CIMA Art Gallery, Calcutta. The painting, 

which is a self-portrait of the couple kissing is, according to Chintan, ?a look 

at the couple?s identity in a city like Mumbai where there was a phase of moral 

policing?.

Hema on Chintan 

Chintan and I first met in college where we studied 

in the same class at the Baroda Faculty of Fine Arts. I didn?t take to Chints 

at first sight as I couldn?t imagine going around with him but over a period of 

four years, we became friends and then a couple. In 1998, we got married and honestly, 

it doesn?t really feel like we?re married. I feel as if I?m living in with my 

boyfriend. 

Like most others, we are distinctly different from 

each other. Chintan?s idea about art for instance, is very different from mine. 

A lot of people have told me that Chintan?s work is way ahead of the times. I 

too believe that he is a very techno-savvy person and uses a lot of references 

from daily life. Over the years, Chintan has evolved and changed a lot of conventional 

attitudes regarding art. His workshops, which he holds in several rural areas, 

see a lot of participation from people from all walks of life. As an artist and 

a person, he has tremendous faith in himself. He has very big plans and I know 

he?ll find a way to achieve them.

Our relationship today is the same as it was back 

in college. We still fight, argue and irritate each other. Of course, we?ve become 

more responsible towards each other and we tackle problems by talking, arguing 

and then apologising for all the rubbish we say to each other in the process. 

Chintan has taught me a lot not only in my personal 

life but also in my professional space. I love the fact that he lets me be ?me?. 

This is very important between two individuals when they are in love.

Of all the romantic and not-so-romantic things we 

have been through, what I remember the most is this particular incident in college 

when he held me in his arms. That day, all of us were supposed to clean the college 

studio and I was standing on a high ladder, cleaning the roof. Since I?m a Sindhi, 

all our friends kept teasing me saying, ?Oye Sindhi, you will fall and break your 

neck?. I was a bit scared but then Chints came up to me and said, ?Don?t worry, 

I will have my arms spread out for you so you can fall into them.? While I didn?t 

actually fall, to my surprise, Chints still picked me up and insisted on carrying 

me in his arms. Needless to say, I went red with embarrassment even as everyone 

stood around us applauding. 

The only grouse that I have against my husband, though, 

is that he?s become very busy nowadays and I do wish we could get to spend more 

time with each other.

Chintan on Hema

Hema and I used to be in the same class in college 

and I fell in love with her right from the very start. In fact, I?d keep bugging 

her by proposing almost everyday but she never took me seriously. Finally after 

five years of pursuing her, she came up to me one day and said ?OK, but if we 

go around you will have to marry me.? That was how we started seeing each other 

? just like that.

Hema is like my best friend. Post-marriage, she is 

the centre of my world. I miss her a lot when she goes out of town and am completely 

lost without her. Of course, I don?t admit that to her but she?s become an integral 

part of my life. My companion in good and bad times, I can rely on her completely. 

Obviously, like every couple we too have our disagreements, but we know we are 

there for each other no matter what. We fight but never let that hamper our life 

? professional or personal. And in our heart of hearts, we both known that we 

really care for each other.

On the professional front, we both respect each other?s 

privacy and professional space. The two of us are aware of our positions as artists 

and we have no inhibitions about talking about our weaknesses. We try and find 

solutions not only within ourselves but also from the outside world. I won?t say 

she has influenced my career but yes, Hema has influenced me in many other ways. 

I have changed a lot because of her ? my lifestyle, my way of thinking and my 

work. 

As an artist, Hema deals with totally different topics 

than I do. Her projects are always there in her mind and her diary but she doesn?t 

like to talk about them till she is finally ready. I also feel that she translates 

materials very well and is very sensitive to the whole idea of representation. 

Being her husband and a fellow artist, I have kept in touch with her work and 

my favourite is ?The Cockroach?, which she showed at the Indian Triennial, Delhi 

in 2001. My other favourite is the work she did at Khoj, which is more like a 

letter to her parents, which she titled ?This space in between you and me?. I 

also like her latest work in Karachi titled ?Loco-Foco-Motto?. Hema always deals 

with materials sensitively and when you ask her about her work, she will have 

simple real life references. It is this that makes her so special as an artist.

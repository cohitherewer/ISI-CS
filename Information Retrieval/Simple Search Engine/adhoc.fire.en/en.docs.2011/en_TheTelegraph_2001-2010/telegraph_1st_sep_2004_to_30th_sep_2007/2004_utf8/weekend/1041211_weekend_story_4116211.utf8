The Telegraph - Calcutta : Weekend

 Comfort driving 

Superior suspension makes for a smooth and easy ride, 

says Anamit Sen

What is it that enables one car to glide over any 

road, be it good or bad, while another struggles over even the gentlest of bumps? 

While the price of the car and its tyres play a significant role, what really 

makes the difference between a smooth ride and an uncomfortable, bone-rattling 

one is the suspension. 

Suspension systems have been evolving ever since man 

discovered the wheel and started using it as a means to provide motion. Early 

car suspensions were little more than ideas borrowed from horse-drawn carriages. 

Thankfully, automobile technology has come a long way since then and now, superior 

systems are available that allow comfortable cruising in your car. What?s more, 

the manner in which the suspension has been set up also makes all the difference 

between a car?s sharp, go-where-you-point-it handling and loose, wayward handling.

Basically, the car?s suspension has two jobs. First 

and foremost, it has to absorb shocks due to imperfections on the road surface 

so that the occupants can travel without discomfort and fatigue. Secondly, the 

suspension keeps the wheels on the road so that contact is maintained between 

the tyre and tar. Consequently, friction between the two allows the car to move 

in whatever direction the driver desires. 

One of the most basic systems for the rear suspension 

is the leaf spring suspension. This consists of a beam (axle) that connects two 

wheels on either side of the car. Leaf springs comprise several strips of spring 

steel one on top of another and these are mounted on the two wheel-ends of the 

beam. When the beam is forced up by the tyre, the friction that exists between 

the several strips or leaves provides resistance and causes damping of the movement. 

The leaf spring also locates the axle beam and prevents it from moving. 

There are two types of axles used in beam-type suspensions. 

One is the dead or rigid axle, which is just a beam and the second is the live 

axle, which houses the differential and the drive shafts to the wheels. The latter 

is used in the case of rear-wheel-drive cars. For examples of dead axles, take 

a look at the rear suspension of a Maruti 800 while live axles can be seen in 

both Ambassadors and Padminis. This is not the best option for a suspension system 

in terms of both ride and adhesion to the road as the entire axle is susceptible 

to bumps, which are transmitted to the passenger cell. 

Modern cars have found a way around the live axle. 

This is called IRS or independent rear suspension. Here, in the case of a rear-wheel-drive 

car the differential is mounted on the floor of the car while the drive shafts 

have universal joints to enable them to track the movement of the wheels easily 

and independently. Finally, for true all-round independent suspension, the rear 

suspension can consist of just an assembly where wishbones are mounted at a central 

point on the floor pan. The rear suspension of the Mitsubishi Lancer is a good 

example of this.

A superior alternative, however, is independent suspension. 

Here the wheels on either side of the car can move independently of one another. 

This is achieved through wishbones, which are acknowledged to be the best and 

struts, called MacPherson after the person who invented them. In the case of the 

former, two arms shaped like the letter A are used. 

These are located one above the other and one end 

each of both arms is connected to the car body while the other ends are connected 

to the hub upon which the wheel is mounted. The two arms move up and down freely 

as the wheel/tyre rides over the road?s imperfections. Additionally, to prevent 

the arms from moving excessively and violently as would be the case when one encounters 

a pothole at speed, a damper (shock absorber) with a coil spring around it is 

employed. Such suspension systems can be found in a Formula racing car (Maruti 

or other) or even older cars like Standard Heralds and Premier Padminis. 

The MacPherson strut consists of a long tube, which 

is mounted on top in the engine bay while the bottom is the mounting point for 

the wheel assembly. The upper half has a spring coil around it while the lower 

section is a damper. This system is more convenient than effective and is useful 

in cars where space is at a premium.

My favourite long drive

Anoushka Manchanda, veejay

While hosting the show [V] On The Run for Channel 

[V], I had the opportunity of travelling to some of the beautiful places in India 

by car. My companions, which included veejays Purab and Sarah Jane and I had a 

wonderful time driving to these places with each of us taking turns at the wheel. 

While it?s tough to narrow down my outright favourite, 

one of the best drives I?ve been on is Kaziranga in Assam. The road to Kaziranga 

National Sanctuary is marvellous and being maintained by the forest department, 

you get to see some wonderful natural scenery. We drove in a Maruti Versa and 

while driving we came across the beautiful flora and the fauna. Not only Kaziranga, 

but the whole mountainous belt in the north-east is great and the scenery that 

unfolds is simply spectacular.

Driving down Mumbai to Pune via the Expressway is 

another wonderful experience. The scenery immediately changes once you are out 

from the concrete jungle of Mumbai and there are ghats and green paddy 

fields to give you company. The best part is that, while driving down this road 

I make it a point to put on the music and just enjoy the drive.

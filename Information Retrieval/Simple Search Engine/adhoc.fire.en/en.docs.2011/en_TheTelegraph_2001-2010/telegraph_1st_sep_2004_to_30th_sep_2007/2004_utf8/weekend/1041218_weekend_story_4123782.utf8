The Italians dominated the week with a high-profile perfume launch in Mumbai and a show by two fashion biggies in Delhi. Miss Universe made a brief appearance before being whisked away while a noted Mumbai designer unveiled her latest line 

A Latin touch 

With Italian food festivals, fashion shows and even book launches currently the flavour of the season, can Italian perfumes be far behind? Thus, in keeping with the mood of the moment, the, fresh and flowery Italian fragrance, Max Mara, was launched amidst much fanfare at South Mumbai?s Taj Mahal. 

Mumbai?s smart set was out in force and there was plenty of Italian food and music to keep everyone happy. The Max Mara Parfums global sales manager, Maurizio Morello, introduced the brand to the guests and took them through a short presentation about the perfume and other related items. This was followed by the official launch of with upcoming model Kaveri walking the ramp holding a king-size bottle of Max Mara in her hand. The evening was topped off by a classical music recital with Dheeraj Kapadia on the flute, Piyush Pawar on the santoor and Jieetu Shankar on the tabla. Seen getting a whiff of the new perfume were party regulars like Kishen Munchandani, Chaya Momaya and designer Narendra Kumar. 

Designs on you 

What are the top trends in the Indian fashion world this year? The answer is almost certainly femininity and opulence. And that?s what designer Anita Dongre dished out in her stylish new collection that was launched at High Street Phoenix Mills recently. Dongre, creative director of AND, celebrated youth and fun with flouncy feminine skirts and tops in rich, no-holds-barred hues. 

The look of Dongre?s new line is dramatic, with an accent on outrageous femininity and jewelled hues. Raw colours have been used in a very subtle way and off-shoulder tops in turquoise, topaz-yellow and ruby have been teamed with flouncy skirts. Be it the Belle de Jour in swingy satin or the 50s skirts in georgette, the collection emphasised on wearability and the comfort factor. 

In vintage Dongre style, the new line plays homage to minimalism with its crisp and clean linear look. But in deference to today?s accent on fluidity and femininity, the designer has used stark ?90s minimalism with softer lines and a contemporary colour palette. In another limited edition collection, long linear silk skirts paired with formal bustiers were on display. The pieces can be paired or worn as separates and for stunning effect, even with jeans. 

The fashion show drew its share of celebrities who turned up to see first-hand the latest from Dongre?s stable. Spotted in the audience, among others, were actress Mallika Sherawat, actor Sanjay Suri, veejay Purab Kohli and models Bhairavi Goswami and Monika Vaziralli. 

Fashion fiesta 

High fashion ruled once again at the Italian ambassador?s residence as Festa Italiana 2004 got underway with plenty of easy-on-the eye action. There were gorgeous men strutting the ramp in outfits from Ermenegildo Zegna?s Spring Summer collection, while the women held their own in stunning Valentino creations. 

Zegna?s collection for men, which kickstarted the evening, was all about a refined and exclusive tailored look. While the couture line consisted of pin stripes and micro-pattern tweeds, the sartorial line revisited classic items like the travel jacket in linen with multiple pockets and optional elbow patches. For the men, the sporty line with its bright blue and lemon hues, however, was undoubtedly the show-stealer. 

Next in line for the audience to feast their eyes upon was Valentino?s fall-winter collection, which showcased classic designs in black and ivory, camel, purple and mauve. The eveningwear shimmered in gold and silver and Valentino red and pink. Neckties held in place with jewelled studs were paired with fitted shirts and narrow, wrap skirts. The hottest draws though, were the stunning red gowns. 

Designer Aparna Chandra loved the feminine look of the Valentino collection and she wasn?t the only one. While restaurateur A D Singh, sporting a Rohit Bal creation, could not stop praising our desi designers, wife Sabina went ga-ga over the Italian designers? creations. 

Jewels in the crown 

The D?damas jewellery launch at Le Meridien started early, but its brand ambassador Miss Universe Jennifer Hawkins, chose to make a fashionably late appearance. It created a stir among the shutterbugs who refused to let the lady breathing space. ?Jenny, Jenny look here,? was the common chant from the melee of photographers. The drama was heightened by an accented voice ringing out: ?We have a guest from foreign. Will you please let her speak?? 

Besides Hawkins D?damas had also hired a handful of foreign models who displayed jewellery from the collection, Origin, inspired by nature. Designed by Japanese designer Kazio Ogawa, Origin comprises four lines ? Felina, Avia, Florise and Oceana. A part of the sales proceeds is slotted to go towards nature conservation. D?damas is the jewellery brand from the Gitanjali (Digico) stable which has signed on the reigning Miss Universe as its brand ambassador ?in line with its aspiration to make the brand truly global?. 

Hawkins, resplendent in a black sari studded with blue sequins, posed for a full 10 minutes for the cameras before she was whisked away by her bouncers.

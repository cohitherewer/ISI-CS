The Telegraph - Calcutta : Weekend

Second time lucky 

 Anamit Sen helps you find out whether your proposed second-hand buy has been just used or abused 

You desperately need a new car but the only ?new? thing you can afford these days is a glossy auto magazine where you can just longingly pore over dozens of steel beauties. But even if you are resigned to driving a used car, it needn?t be a rattletrap. You could zip around in a fairly decent second-hand set of wheels provided you have the know-how to make a good buy. 

The good news is that there are all types of second-hand cars available for sale, of which quite a few make for a rather good deal. True, the variety is not as large as one can expect to see in most Western countries and neither are the prices as low. In fact, a flip through any Western auto magazine, especially one on classic cars, can actually prove rather depressing. In the UK for example, for the equivalent of about Rs 3.5 lakh, you could pick up saloons like an Alfa Romeo GTV V6, an Audi Quattro, a Daimler Sovereign or even an Opel Commodore. And it gets even better if you zoom in on the sports cars available. Imagine zipping around in a Porsche 924 Turbo or 944s for the same amount you?d pay for a Maruti 800, or cruising down the highway in a Nissan 240Z or a Toyota Supra by forking out the same cash as you?d for a Hyundai Santro. 

That said, however, second-hand cars are obviously available in India too, though, the range may not be as exotic as that found in Western countries. How about a Fiat Palio NV for Rs 1.5 lakh or a 800 for under a lakh, a Hyundai Accent at about Rs 3.3 lakh, and hold on, a Suzuki Baleno or a Mitsubishi Lancer for about Rs 3.8 lakh? Look carefully and you could find Hyundai Sonatas and Skoda Octavias for about Rs 7 lakh and earlier-version Honda Accords for Rs 10 lakh. Now doesn?t that sound like a basketful of bargains! 

Before you race off to make your second-hand steal, however, there are certain guidelines to consider when venturing into the used car market. The most important of these is to always be aware of the fact that a private sale is just that ? a private sale. There is no manufacturer to fall back upon in case of a problem. Take a good look at what?s on offer and only then should you part with your cash. Having said that, also remember that in the face of increasing competition, manufacturers such as Maruti and Ford have gone to the extent of starting second-hand sales schemes like True Value and Ford Assured. Here, the car you purchase has been thoroughly refurbished and checked and most importantly, is accompanied with a guarantee. 

Returning to the rules of the second-hand car game, buyers need to ensure that the registration papers are in order. Then inspect the car thoroughly. Take a good look at the bodywork, especially the surface of the panels and the panel gaps. This is a indicator of whether the car has been in an accident or not. 

My 

first car

Shovana Narayan, danseuse

 My first car was an old 1963 Fiat. It had quarter windows and the doors would 

open up in the front. It belonged to my father who got transferred from Delhi 

to Mumbai and then to Calcutta. But the family decided to stay on in Delhi and 

the car was passed on to me in 1968. I was 18 at the time. From then on, I 

literally grew up with it and it became a part of the family. I even remember 

its number plate: DLI 5776.

 My car was a light fawn colour in the beginning, which was later changed to 

a silvery-grey. In the late 70s, the hand brakes stopped functioning. Maybe 

it was trying to indicate that its days were numbered. But even after that, it 

saw me through thick and thin.

There are so many memories attached to my first car. I brought back my son in 

it after he was born on June 18, 1985. Two weeks before he arrived, the car even 

got stolen. Surprisingly I got a call a week later saying that my Fiat had been 

retrieved. I finally had to part ways with my dear old car in 1988 after 20 long 

years. 

As told to Arundhati Basu

Don?t forget to check under the bonnet as the condition of the engine bay could reveal the seller?s maintenance habits. Chances are that it could have been spruced up to facilitate the sale, so delve deeper. Check the engine oil, the brake fluids and the coolant level. Low levels or contamination should ring alarm bells, especially if the engine oil has mayonnaise-like residue in it ? it could be a worn head gasket or worse, a cracked cylinder block. 

Your next step of the inspection routine should be cranking up the engine. Stand behind the car to see the exhaust smoke. Blue smoke on starting, that disappears after the engine has settled into idling, indicates worn valve guides. If the blue smoke continues, then the engine needs expensive work. Next, test the suspension by going to each corner of the car and pushing down on it hard. Release the pressure and the car should bob up once and settle down ? any more than that indicates damaged dampers. The tyres also need to be inspected carefully. There should be adequate tread depth left on them. Check the wear pattern: if it?s uneven, then the suspension has been either misaligned or even on its last legs. Once again, overhauling would be an expensive proposition. The sidewalls too need to be checked for cuts and nicks that could result in early replacement of the tyre. 

Before hopping into the car and taking it for a test drive, ask the seller to drive the car on the road in front of you ? first, away from you and then, back. A crabby kind of gait indicates the car has been in a major accident and while the body may have been repaired, it has not been straightened properly. 

Before the road test, take a good look at the interiors as well. Check the seats, the ABC pedal rubbers and the steering wheel. Be alert to contradictions like a low reading on the odometer along with a shiny steering wheel. Ensure that everything works ? lights, switches, instruments, power windows and the air-conditioning. While driving, keep an ear open for any strange rattles or noises. Check the clutch for both bite and slippage ? clutch repairs are usually expensive. 

Now if all of the above seems terribly complicated, take along a professional mechanic or at least, a knowledgeable friend. Always insist on a road test ? if denied, avoid the seller (and his car) like the plague. Remember, not every seller out there is a gentleman but there are certainly a large number of cars out there and one of them, maybe more, is just the one you?re looking for.

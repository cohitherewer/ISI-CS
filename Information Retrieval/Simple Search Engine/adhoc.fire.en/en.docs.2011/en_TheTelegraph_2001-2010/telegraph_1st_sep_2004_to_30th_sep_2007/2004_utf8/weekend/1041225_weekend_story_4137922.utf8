The Telegraph - Calcutta : Weekend

 My Weekend 

Pooja Bedi

Unlike the other days of the week, weekends are pretty 

quiet and laid-back for me. My kids go visiting their father over the weekends 

and so, I have the house all to myself. Honestly, I am very bored without them 

and feel a bit low but still, in a way, it?s about the only time I get off from 

my motherly duties. I usually make the most of it and spend all my time at home 

? relaxing, unwinding and doing my own thing.

I do all of my reading, writing and research over 

the weekend. All my columns, research for my book and other related things are 

done on Saturdays and Sundays. I am not a party person so I spend a lot of time 

at home with my family. I usually call over my brother or close friends ? we sit 

around, chat, eat some good food and catch up. I try and entertain at home as 

it is my favourite space ? it gives me this feeling of oneness and comfort. 

If I have to go out, it is usually to close friends? 

homes. I enjoy house parties and small get-togethers ? they offer a greater degree 

of intimacy and fun. I enjoy such evenings, where I know everyone by their first 

names. If I do have to go out, I love Rain and Olive, both of which are in Bandra. 

I do try and catch a few plays at Prithvi if I can manage. But over and above, 

weekends mark my getaway from household duties and chores. I just try to unwind 

and enjoy myself, indulging in my own interests.

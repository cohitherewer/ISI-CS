The Telegraph - Calcutta : Weekend

 My Weekend 

Vijay Arora - Fashion designer

Evenings out and family fun

If I get a weekend to chill out, then Saturdays are 

for partying and Sundays are meant for the family. Having said that, it is not 

always that I get a nice long weekend given the busy schedules at work, especially 

during this season. We are very busy with work during the last quarter of the 

year as it?s the wedding season.

However, usually on Saturdays, I work during the day 

and try to finish up early and get back home. We have a get-together with friends 

if there are no big parties to attend. These days, someone or the other is either 

having a show or throwing a winter party ? so that keeps me busy. My wife Shobhna 

prefers to stay home with children, though she joins me if there is an interesting 

evening. If she is not accompanying me, then I do not stay out late and prefer 

to come back relatively early to join the family for dinner.

As for Sunday, I am at home, playing with my kids 

and enjoying domesticity with my wife. Once in a while, we do call friends over 

for an early dinner. After all, given that most Indians work six days week, it 

is only such efforts that keep us all tied together.

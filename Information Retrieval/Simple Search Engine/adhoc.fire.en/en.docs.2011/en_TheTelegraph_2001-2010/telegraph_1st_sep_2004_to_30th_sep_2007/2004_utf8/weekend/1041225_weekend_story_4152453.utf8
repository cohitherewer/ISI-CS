The Telegraph - Calcutta : Weekend

Honeymoon havens 

 You just can?t top these fabulous destinations when it comes to romantic getaways, says Sushmita Biswas 

In the old days, the rules were clear: youthful honeymooners headed for hillstations like Shimla, Mussoorie or Ooty. Today, the hillstations are overcrowded, probably rundown and, dare we say it, slightly d?class?. Today?s young honeymooners are probably better advised to check out romantic foreign destinations ? if nothing else the airfares are cheaper. If you haven?t found the perfect destination, here?s a list of honeymoon getaways around the world to help you with your decision. 

Switzerland 

Goethe summed up Switzerland succinctly as a combination 

of ?the colossal and the well-ordered?. If you are there, you will wonder at the 

just-so precision of Swiss towns tempered by the lofty splendour of the landscapes 

that surround them. Switzerland conjures up wonderful images ? irresistible chocolates, 

yodelling Heidis, humourless bankers and international bureaucracies. The major 

attractions are Ch?teau de Chillon Castle that receives more visitors than any 

other historical building in Switzerland. Geneva is Switzerland?s second largest 

city, but surely the most international: a third of the population is from elsewhere. 

The city is crowded with museums, has many excellent cultural events, even more 

good restaurants, and is ideally placed for quick hops to the Swiss and French 

Alps. Zermatt, the swanky skiing and mountaineering resort bathes in the reflected 

glory of one of the most famous peaks in the Alps. 

Packages: 

Cox and Kings Travels 

Swiss Splendour: 8 Days/ 7 Nights ? Lucerne, Interlaken, Murren, Zurich 

Price INR 38,749 + Euro 625 

Italy 

nItaly has it all ? popes, painters and poets. Its dreamy light and sumptuous landscapes seem made for romance, and its three millennia of history, culture and cuisine seduces just about everyone. You can visit Roman ruins, gawk at Renaissance art, stay in tiny medieval hill towns, go skiing in the Alps, explore the canals of Venice and gaze at beautiful churches. Naturally you can also indulge in the pleasures of La dolce vita: good food, good wine and improving your wardrobe. From the Arab-Norman and Byzantine wonders of Palermo in Sicily to the majestic peaks of the Dolomites, Italy is a movable feast of endless courses. Few countries offer such variety and few visitors leave without a fervent desire to return. 

New Zealand 

There?s nothing quite like a hot bath to help you 

unwind and in New Zealand?s Central North Island, nature has run one for you. 

Other hot spots include the steaming waters of Inferno Crater, Champagne Pool 

at Wai--Tapu and the hot headed Pohutu Geyser, which erupts up to 20 times a day. 

Such dramatic landscape also makes for great skiing. Also spend time around the 

Wellington region and you?ll find a new world at your fingertips. The concentration 

of eateries in downtown Wellington creates a fun and vibrant atmosphere. From 

Christchurch at South Island you can see a promise of what?s to come ? the majestic 

outline of Mount Cook and the Southern Alps shimmering in the distance. To the 

extreme south lies the city of Dunedin with spectacular scenery and wildlife only 

minutes from the city. For stunning vistas of a different kind, there?s Central 

Otago. Once the gold mining centre of New Zealand, its rolling hills, rivers and 

lakes now attract honeymooners. 

Packages: 

Sita Travels 

New Zealand Extravaganza: from $2,185 

Cox and Kings 

Romantic And Exciting New Zealand: 8 Days/7 Nights 

Christchurch, Queenstown, Rotorua, Auckland (Flexi Hols package) 

Australia 

Australia?s biggest attraction is its natural beauty 

as the landscape varies from endless sun-baked horizons to dense tropical rainforest 

to chilly southern beaches. Scattered along the coasts, its cities blend a European 

enthusiasm for art and food. Don?t forget to visit the opera in Sydney. It is 

the sheer vastness that gives Australia ? and its diverse population ? much of 

its character. Around the coast, wander into the depths of a rainforest or spend 

time at its beaches. 

Packages: 

Cox and Kings 

Australian Experience 

Price INR 55950+AUD 1325 9 days/8 nights Australia. Also add on an eight days Kiwi Surprise Tour 

Sita Travels 

Tours of Australia and New typically range from $45 to $130 per person, per day, plus airfare 

Mauritius 

Mauritius is the most accessible island in the Indian 

Ocean, boasting as much tropical paradise as Maui or Martinique and, better still, 

offering it at a bargain price. Though nestled up alongside Africa, it?s actually 

more influenced by its British and French ties and massive Indian workforce. Here, 

you can enjoy a dish of curried chickpeas or a nice Yorkshire pudding on the terrace 

of a French caf?, sipping imported wine or a thick malty ale while listening to 

Cr?ole music and the conversation of locals. If you?re looking for a lazy honeymoon 

vacation, you could certainly do worse, but don?t forget the rambling interiors 

and the multicultural capital Port Louis. 

Langkawi 

Honeymooners love this paradise on Earth because of 

the sheer treat they get here the moment they land at the airport. As you hit 

the wide roads here, let your gaze travel beyond the stretches of deserted island 

to the quaint fishing hamlets and flora and fauna. Being a coral island that consists 

of 104 small and big isles, the water at Langkawi is incredibly clear. You can 

almost see the bed of corals and shells even as you try and catch tiny fish and 

baby crabs. Langkawi is a stunning huddle of 99 tropical islands that lies off 

the north-western coasts of Malaysia with the main island popularly known as Pulau 

Langkawi. A major draw here is the duty-free shopping and on your honeymoon, you 

can pick up a range of local and imported goods at attractive prices. 

Phuket 

Thailand?s largest island is a wonderland of wildlife 

and rainforest, fringed by white sand beaches with some of the world?s premier 

resorts. Most visitors to Phuket Province head straight for the sea, but the interior 

is well worth exploring for its vivid patchwork of plantations and rice paddies, 

crowned by the island?s rainforest in Khao Phra Thaw Royal Wildlife Reserve. Rainy 

season is the best time for hiking with excellent views of Ton Sai and Bang Pae 

waterfalls, with possible sightings of resident wildlife such as flying foxes. 

Though the best time to visit Phuket is between November and February, those looking 

for a quiet holiday should head here between May and September. Each of its beaches 

has a charm of its own ? be it the crowded Patong Beach or the relatively quiet 

Nui Beach. 

Chiang Mai 

Thailand?s second city, Chiang Mai, is a comfortable 

yet sophisticated city and gateway to the mountains of northern Thailand. Originally 

settled by the Mons, King Mengrai founded Chiang Mai as a Thai kingdom in 1296. 

Centuries later, it was absorbed into the Lanna Thai kingdom and became a major 

centre for religion and culture. The Burmese controlled the city from 1556 until 

King Taksin redeemed it in 1775, placing it permanently under Thai sovereignty. 

With all this history, there is plenty to hold your attention in Chiang Mai: walk 

around the old walled city, see traditional temples, trek through rural mountain 

villages, visit cultural centres and go shopping for exquisite handicrafts. 

Koh Samui 

nThis place is ideal for a laid-back vacation meant for just the two of you. Due to the many spas and holistic health centres that have mushroomed in recent years, Koh Samui is fast gaining a reputation for being a health and relaxation retreat. Indulge in a traditional Thai massage at one of the fancy spas or save money by patronising languid beachside practitioners. The Na Muabg waterfalls, mummified monks, the Hin Ta Hin Yai rock formations and the eight-headed coconut tree are other big draws. 

Singapore 

It?s a mini-state country that has turned itself into 

a tourist destination. At first glance, Singapore appears shockingly modern and 

anonymous, but this is an undeniably Asian city with Chinese, Malay and Indian 

traditions from Feng Shui to ancestor worship setting the scene for the pursuit 

of commerce. It?s these contrasts that bring the city to life. One day you?re 

in a stall, melting over a bowl of Indian curry, the next you?re enjoying high 

tea in a five star setting. In the crowded streets of Chinatown, fortunetellers, 

calligraphers and temple worshippers are still a part of everyday life. In Little 

India, you can buy the best sari material, fresh spices or a picture of your favourite 

Hindu god. 

Bali 

Both magical and mythical, this land of volcanic lakes, 

spectacular rice terraces, stunning tropical beaches, ancient temples and palaces 

is an exotic melting pot of cultures and peoples. Renowned for its unsurpassed 

architecture, traditional theatre, dance and elaborate religious festivals, the 

colorful Balinese culture is a dynamic force that is constantly synthesising the 

old and the new, the traditional and the innovative. Bali is one of more than 

18,000 islands that make up Indonesia. It is located between the two islands Java 

and Nusa Tenggara. There are a number of beaches in Bali like the Kuta Beach, 

which is now a thriving tourist resort, popular mainly among the young. It is 

a popular beach for surfing, though currents make it less suitable for swimming. 

Pantai Seseh is a quiet beach of black volcanic sand, mainly visited by local 

fishermen. Quiet, rough, and close to nature, this beach is simply unforgettable. 

Shopping in Bali can offer excellent bargains, and best buys include modern artwork, 

leather goods, casual summer clothing, shoes, jeans, CDs, T-shirts, furniture 

and pottery as well as knick-knacks. 

Malaysia 

There is much more to Malaysia than meets the eye. 

Its mysterious jungles and rainforests, pristine beaches and clear waters are 

seldom talked about but give Malaysia much of its character apart from its multi-cultural 

heritage. The black sand beach of Pantai Pasir Hitam and the pebble beach of Pantai 

Batu Kerikil are equally breathtaking in their beauty. Its hill resorts are also 

no less beautiful than its beaches and forests. Genting highlands, a mere 50 km 

from Kuala Lumpur, has in recent years become an international resort ? though 

it can be a trifle noisy. It also has two theme parks, discos and world-class 

casinos. The Cameron Highlands, located at the northwest corner of Pahang, is 

the largest hill resort in Malaysia, with terraced slopes, tea plantations and 

strawberry farms. Apart from the thrill of visiting this place, you could also 

indulge in exciting activities that will remain fresh in your memory even years 

after your marriage ? angling, boating through swirling rapids, mountain climbing, 

swimming and camping in forests.

To the moon and back 

Reymon Singh, actress

 Before we got married, both my husband and I planned way in advance where we 

would go for our honeymoon. We went to Hong Kong and Phuket and it was a wonderful 

experience, as we got to see breathtaking vistas and taste some amazing food. 

Hopefully, well be able to visit these places again in the near future. 

Bikram Ghosh, percussionist

 Right after I got married, I had to go for an extended tour, with my band, 

Rhythmscape. After touring Barcelona, we had to perform at some shows in the United 

Kingdom. My wife Jaya joined me there. We visited lots of places in England including 

Cambridge and Chelmsford. Our honeymoon at London was perfect since we could indulge 

in activities that were consistent with our tastes. Apart from that, London has 

the widest variety of cuisines and both of us had a blast.

Ritu Beri, designer

 It was my husband Bobbys idea to go to Argentina for our honeymoon. I 

readily agreed for it is not one of those run-of-the-mill places like Paris or 

Venice, though the latter would have been great as well. I think Italy is a great 

honeymoon spot as its so romantic.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Weekend

On a role

 Small-town boy Rajpal Yadav is hoping to make a splash with his new film, Main, Mere Patni Aur Woh, says Sushmita Biswas 

He?s the quintessential small-town man who worked his way up in Bollywood by dint of sheer talent and hard work. From a mere three-minute performance in Shool to playing the main lead in Chandan Arora?s upcoming film, Main, Mere Patni Aur Woh ? it?s been quite a journey for actor Rajpal Yadav. Some of his most memorable performances have been in Ram Gopal Verma films like Mast, Jungle, Darna Mana Hain and Main Madhuri Dixit Banna Chahti Hoon, which have all earned him the reputation of being one of the most talented yet underrated actors in the industry. 

For an actor who started out in 1997 on the small screen, Rajpal?s success has been more than well deserved. He attributes a lot of this to his extensive training, first a two-year diploma in acting from Lucknow?s Bharatendu Natya Academy, followed by a stint at Delhi?s National School of Drama for three years. Says Rajpal, ?This training gave me the technical know-how and the confidence to tackle different characters in different situations. It was only after this that I felt that I was ready to join mainstream cinema and made my way to Mumbai.? 

Born and brought up in Shahjehanpur in Uttar Pradesh, Rajpal hails from a typical middle-class family where education was given paramount importance. ?My parents wanted me to become a doctor, which was why I joined the science stream in college. But I was an average student and hated all those lab experiments and finally switched to arts. In college, I used to take an active part in dramas and even joined a local theatre group. The appreciation that I got as an actor in one such college play, Andher Nagari Chaupat Raja, made me change my mind about my career aspirations. I decided to pack my bags and join an acting school to hone my skills,? he says. 

Training over, Rajpal embarked on a small screen career, starting out with television serials like Mungerilal Ke Bhai Naurangilal on Doordarshan. He was soon spotted by director E. Niwas who gave him a small role in Shool. Ramgopal Varma, who was producing that film, liked his performance, brief though it was, and offered him a bigger role in Mast, followed by a villain?s role in the blockbuster Jungle. ?That negative role was the turning point in my career,? says Rajpal. ?It won me rave reviews as well as the Screen Videocon Award for Best Actor in a Negative Role in 2000.? 

Another role, which won him critical appreciation, was as Raju in the film Main Madhuri Dixit Banna Chahti Hoon, where he played Antara Mali?s husband. Though the film didn?t do well, the character appealed to me. When Ramuji told me that I would have the lead role opposite Antara Mali, I was extremely surprised. But I was very happy that I had finally managed to break my character-artist mould and get a break as a hero,? he says. 

At present, Rajpal looks completely at peace with himself, largely because of the kind of offers that he is now getting. ?I am not saying that I have arrived because I still have a long way to go. But I can safely say that people have accepted me in spite of the fact that I am not the regular hero you see in Hindi movies. The directors I am working with have seen the potential in me and are willing to offer me roles that suit my personality,? he says. 

His face lights up at the mention of Chandan Arora?s soon-to-be-released film, Main, Mere Patni Aur Woh, ?This is the second time I have worked with Chandan after Main Madhuri Dixit Banna Chahti Hoon and by now, we both know just what the other wants. He is an intelligent director and we share a wonderful rapport. Though I am not in a position to divulge details about this film, the only thing I can say that it is a story about the odd pairing of couples. I play the husband of actress Rituparna Sengupta and we had a great time working together. It?s an experimental film minus all the thrills and the frills,? he points out. 

Ever since he?s stepped into the industry, Rajpal has always been associated with experimental films. Did he want to do these films or were these the only offers that came his way? ?I always wanted a character to excite me and motivate me enough to bring out the best in me. I don?t want to judge an offer on the basis of whether it?s a commercial film or a realistic one. As far as I am concerned, the first thing that should appeal to me is the script and the director who I am working with,? he says. 

Success may have come early to this actor but he isn?t one to rest on his laurels. For him, award functions are occasions where industry people meet and exchange pleasantries. ?It?s like any other event and once the show is over, people forget about it. Though it feels good to be appreciated, that doesn?t mean you should stop working and bask in past glory,? he laughs. 

So what next? ?At present, I have several exciting offers in hand. I am working with directors like Shyam Benegal, David Dhawan, Ram Gopal Varma, Mahesh Bhatt and Vipul Shah as I want to try out different genres of acting,? he says. That?s what everyone says these days but Rajpal Yadav is definitely doing a better job of it than most others.

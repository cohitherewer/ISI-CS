The Telegraph - Calcutta : Weekend

 Winter Wonderlands 

The winters are when the hill stations are at their 

very best, says Samita Bhatia

Joyful Travel

Looking for a getaway that offers rock-bottom rates 

and throws in some exciting extras into the package? What you?d like are sumptuous 

meals with luxurious rooms that offer picturesque views for a price that won?t 

set you back by a small fortune! No, we aren?t talking about a beach weekend in 

Sri Lanka or a few days in Singapore. Why not try something closer ? the hill 

stations. 

Never mind if you did head for the hills during summer. 

The mountains have a charm of their own in the traditional off-season. The hills 

may be alive with holiday-makers when the plains groan under sweltering heat waves, 

but the action is now beginning to hot up in winters when the biting cold sets 

in. So if you?ve checked out some skiing destinations in the past, a hill holiday 

may be just the thing this season.

According to travel agents, ?now? is a good time as 

any to holiday in the mountains ? what with Christmas and the New Year coming 

up. Travel agents are also cashing in on the fact that the wedding season has 

countless honeymooners looking for getaways in the hills. 

The good news is that the winter months ? from November 

15 to April 15 ? bring plenty of add-ons in their wake: the air is sharp and bracing, 

the crowds are thin thus bringing down hotel tariffs to annual lows. The only 

exception is the Christmas and New Year period from December 20 to January 5 when 

hotels command higher tariffs than even the summer season. Visit now and you can 

knock off about 30 to 40 per cent of rack rates. The bonus for city slickers? 

In some hill stations, it snows.

A paradise for adventure seekers, the hills offer 

plenty to do. You can walk down sleepy roads or indulge in activities like skiing 

(as in Gulmarg), hiking, trekking, mountaineering, rafting, para-gliding, kayaking 

or even mountain biking.

Besides the popular hill towns in the north and north-east, 

one should also look south and westwards of the country as well. Statutory warning: 

hill temperatures in winter can go anywhere from six degrees to zero degrees and 

below.

In the lap of the Himalayas in the north and east

Close to home in the lower Himalayas lies Darjeeling 

and Kalimpong (in West Bengal), Shillong (Meghalaya) and Gangtok (in Sikkim). 

Darjeeling, a celebrated tea-growing district, has possibly the best views of 

any Indian hill station ? including those of the snow-covered peaks in the distance. 

The bulk of Kanchenjunga, some 8,580m high, appears to sit above the town. Here 

you can visit Buddhist monasteries, visit tea plantations, go for a ride on the 

chair-lift or even go on a trek. The bonus is the toy train ride on the New Jalpaiguri-Darjeeling 

route.

The nearest airport from Darjeeling is Bagdogra while 

New Jalpaiguri is the nearest station. The journey up takes about three to four 

hours. 

Close to Siliguri and Darjeeling is Mirik, a hill 

that?s almost completely surrounded by some of the best tea gardens in the region. 

Another option for a holiday is lush Kalimpong that is dotted with monasteries. 

About 4km from the heart of town lies Kalimpong?s famous Swiss Welfare Dairy that 

should be on the must-see list.

Further away, in Sikkim, it?s time for festivities 

at this time of the year. Your holiday will be peppered by ongoing celebrations 

of some important festivals. The tour can also include visits to Jaldapara or 

Gorumara Wildlife Sanctuary in the foothills of the Himalayas. Accommodation in 

three to four star hotels will cost anything between Rs 1,475 to Rs 2,700.

Up north, Gulmarg in Jammu amp; Kashmir emerges as 

India?s premier skiing destination at this time of the year. There are several 

private hotels, ranging from the upmarket to the budget category that offer rooms 

from Rs 500 to upwards of Rs 3,000. And if you?d rather not go skiing, then revel 

in other snow sports such as tobogganing or riding snow scooters. Go for nature 

walks or ride ponies to day excursion spots like the frozen Alpather Lake, Ningal 

Nallah and Lienmarg (tourists information at: Director of Tourism, J amp;K Government, 

Tourist Reception Centre, Srinagar. Tel (0194)-72449, 73648, 77224).

The north is also home to some of India?s oldest and 

most popular hill stations. Himachal Pradesh teems with these and you can take 

your pick from Bharmaur, Chail, Kasauli, Kufri, Dalhousie, Dharamshala, Kullu, 

Lahaul-Spiti-Kinnaur, Manali and Shimla. Shimla tops the list closely followed 

by Kasauli, a cantonment town originally developed by the British.

In Shimla, you can book two nights and three days 

for around Rs 6,666 per couple. The tariff usually includes breakfast and dinner 

too. A Kasauli vacation for two nights and three days will set you back by Rs 

6,500 a couple.

If hiking, picnics, mountain climbing, sunbathing 

and fishing are what you?re looking for, head for Manali. It?s an excellent gateway 

for a trek to the Lahaul, Spiti, Kinnaur, Leh and Zanskar regions. Three nights 

and four days here costs about Rs 4,999 per couple, including meals.

In the Dhauladhar range, Dalhousie, in the Chamba 

district, is another Himachal hotseller. Himachal Pradesh Tourism Development 

Corporation?s (HPTDC) hotels as well as private hotels, guest houses and forest 

rest houses provide a variety of accommodation in and around the town catering 

to all budgets. 

In Uttaranchal, the favourites remain Nainital and 

Mussoorie. Nainital has several lakes closeby such as Bhimtal, Sattal, Naukuchiatal, 

Khurpatal, Malwatal, Harishtal and Lokhamtal. What?s more, Ranikhet is just 60km 

away while Ram Nagar, that leads one to Corbett National Park, is just a 65km 

drive. Contact: Kumaon Mandal Vikas Nigam Ltd, Nainital; Tel: (05942)-35337. 

For some magnificent views, head for Mukteshwar, 52km 

from Nainital, while Almora, another attraction is 60km away. The Nainital-Almora-Ranikhet 

route makes for an interesting itinerary. In Nainital, a weekend stay costs about 

Rs 4,999 including stay, breakfast and dinner. Three nights and four days at a 

four-star hotel though costs about Rs 5,500 (no meals) for a couple.

Mussoorie comes with commanding view of the Himalayas 

to its north-east, while overlooking the Doon Valley. The town is a gateway to 

Yamunotri and Gangotri. In Mussoorie, expect to pay as little as Rs 4,999 per 

couple for accommodation and meals.

Further south of the Himalayas, the Aravallis, one 

of the world?s oldest ranges, stretches along the West of the country from Delhi 

to Gujarat. The most popular hill resort here is Mount Abu. 

Central India

In the Satpura range, which runs parallel to the Vindhyas, 

lies Pachmarhi, a quaint and charming hill resort. This is also Madhya Pradesh?s 

only hill station.

Westward bound

Along the West coast, close to Mumbai, are resorts 

such as Mahabaleshwar and Matheran. The natural beauty of Mahabaleshwar attracts 

nature lovers, filmmakers and adventure-seekers alike. Mahabaleshwar?s 30 striking 

viewpoints offer some magnificent landscapes which are all located within the 

10-km radius of its bazaar. Some points can be reached by road while others can 

be reached on foot. Matheran is another popular hill destination close to Mumbai.

Southern spice

The Nilgiris have beautiful hill towns in Ootacamund 

and Kodaikanal in Tamil Nadu. If you travel to the southern tip of the upper Palani 

Hills in the Western Ghats, stop at Kodaikanal. Located 120km from Madurai, Kodaikanal 

is famed for its picturesque waterfalls, fruit orchards, abundant bird life and 

rare orchids.

Ootacamund or Udhagamandalam, better known as Ooty, 

is another popular stop. Developed as a hill resort by the British in the early 

1800s, Ooty retains a colonial flavour with beautiful bungalows and cottages, 

the Ootacamund Club, the Nilgiri Library, St. Stephens Church and a Raj-era cemetery. 

In Kerala you?ll find not just golden beaches and 

swaying palms but also one of the most beautiful hill resorts in India. Munnar, 

in eastern Kerala is known for its verdant green environs, and has some of the 

highest tea estates in India. Tea plantations and tourism are the mainstays of 

Munnar and it?s easy to find accommodation ranging anywhere between Rs 900 to 

Rs 6,500 per day.

The hills are alive ? though not with the cacophony 

of tourists. Quieter in the winters, they beckon you to take a break. And you?re 

sure to return for more of their idyllic beauty and quaint charm ? but in winter.

Head for the hills

Vidhi Singhania, designer

I?m completely at peace in the mountains. Winter is 

great for a holiday as the hills are quieter and calmer then. Mashobra near Shimla, 

Ananda near Rishikesh and Kodaikanal are my favourite holiday spots.

Mouli Ganguly, actress

I holidayed in Manali last winter which was freezing 

at that point of time. Although it?s very beautiful, due to the heavy snowfall, 

we were confined indoors. But it was a wonderful experience all the same and I 

loved the surrounding scenery.

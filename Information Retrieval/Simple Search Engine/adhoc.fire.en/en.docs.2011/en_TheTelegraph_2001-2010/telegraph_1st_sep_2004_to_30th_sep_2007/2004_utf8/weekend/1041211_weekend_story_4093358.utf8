Go fish!

 PREAH NARANG 

 Strongly-flavoured anchovies can punch up even the most boring dish 

Native to the Mediterranean, anchovies are tiny fish that are strongly-flavoured when cooked. Most people dislike anchovies but what they probably don?t know is that these are used to flavour Worcestershire sauce, remoulade sauce and green goddess dressing among several other recipes. 

Finding fresh anchovies is virtually impossible as they are highly perishable. Thus, it?s best to go for whole anchovies packed in salt. These have the best flavour and are bigger than oil-packed anchovies. Then there is also anchovy paste which is quite popular given that most recipes usually require a tablespoon or so. Anchovies work well to flavour tomato sauces, fish sauces, salad dressings, vegetables and chicken and lamb preparations. A little goes a long way. Capers and olives also pair very well with anchovies. 

Cooking tips: 

 To cook anchovies, keep the heat low and cook 

slowly, so that they dissolve gradually. 

 When using whole canned anchovies, you should 

rinse them gently in cold water. Peel off the fillet from one side and then remove 

the backbone and tail from the other side. Rinse again. The skin is edible and 

needn?t be removed. 

 Once you open tinned anchovies, ensure that 

they are covered in oil in a sealed container and refrigerated. Use as soon as 

possible. 

 There?s a big difference between fresh, canned 

and salted anchovies. They are not interchangeable in recipes. 

 Small sardines can usually be substituted for 

anchovies in many recipes, but ensure they are the same form (ie canned for canned 

or fresh for fresh) and size. 

 To remove some of the salt from anchovies, 

soak in cold water or milk for 1/2 to 1 hour. Drain and pat dry before using. 

Anchovy paste is not as strong in flavour as salted or canned anchovies, but remember 

that it is saltier. 

 Anchovy oil can also be used in salad dressings 

and sauces instead of whole anchovies. It will have a stronger flavour than if 

the anchovies were used and also be more salty. You can use a combination of oils 

and check the salt before adding more.

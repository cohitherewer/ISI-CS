The Telegraph - Calcutta : Weekend

Festive fervour

The various Indian festivals and fairs are an expression 

of the spirit of celebration that is so much a part of our country, says Sanghamitra 

Bhowmik

India is a rich land, which has attracted invaders 

from Central Europe and Asia ? all of whom have left their imprint on this land, 

its religions and its lifestyles. As a result, today, Indian celebrates more festivals 

than any other country. Apart from the regular festivals, India also hosts many 

fairs that attract tourists from all over the world. The birthdays of gods, goddesses, 

saints and prophets, historical happenings, all find expression in colourful festivities. 

These fairs are occasions to get together with friends and relatives, exchange 

gifts, dance and sing and also a time for prayer, pageantry and processions.

Pushkar Festival, Rajasthan

 Come November and the tiny village of Pushkar 

in Rajasthan dresses up to worship Lord Brahma. For tourists this is ?folklorique 

India at its best. Religion combines with bedecked camels, decorated cattle, competitions 

and meditating sadhus. If all that isn?t enough, there?s a chance to take 

a holy dip and browse through the colourful stalls. 

Pushkar literally means ?a lotus that blooms in mud?, 

and it?s also home to one of the only two temples dedicated to Brahma. This is 

one of the innumerable temples skirting the large Pushkar Lake with 52 ghats, 

and it?s the focal point of all devotional activities and the main reason for 

the confluence. The fair itself centres around the event of taking a dip at Pushkar 

Lake on a full moon night. Not much is known about the origin of the fair but 

scholars suggest that the cattle fair was an extension of the religious event 

of taking a dip in the lake. The nearby Saraswathi temple too, is a huge attraction 

for married women.

The biggest cattle fair in the country also sees a 

huge congregation of men and women from all over. Although a small sleepy town 

in the Ajmer district of Rajasthan, Pushkar is transformed into a glittering display 

of activity, with a variety of colourful stalls and vendors for the duration of 

the fair. In addition to its commercial importance, the fair is also a window 

to the cultural richness of Rajasthan.

Goa Carnival, Goa

 Though celebrated by the Christian population 

of Goa, the carnival?s only relevance to Christianity is that it is celebrated 

before Lent. The festival today has no religious undertones and has come to be 

a cultural highlight of the state, rather than of the religion. Celebrated three 

days before Lent, the Goa Carnival is an integral part of the Portuguese heritage 

of the state. The carnival epitomises the fun-loving culture characteristic of 

Goa. The erstwhile rulers had a rowdy celebration in which flour, eggs, oranges, 

lemons, mud, sand-filled gloves along with dirty water, various liquids and glue 

were aimed at passersby. Used pots, pans, and other kitchen utensils were also 

thrown out of windows. Perhaps this was done to discard the old and the dirty 

before the Lenten fast.

Fierce battles were waged in the streets with plaster-of-Paris 

eggs, wax lemons, corncobs and beans. Blows with brooms and wooden spoons were 

dealt out liberally. It was also an occasion for unchecked eating. People gorged 

on rich food at lavish feasts. Even the convents distributed cakes and pastries. 

The carnival in Goa has retained the core of these festivities, while adapting 

and amalgamating it with the local culture.

Jagannath Rath Yatra, Puri

 Jagannatha Rath Yatra or the chariot journey 

of Lord Jagannatha is a festival that celebrates the annual visit of the God to 

his place of birth. The presiding deities of the temple in Puri, Jagannatha, his 

brother Balaram and his sister Subhadra, are taken in a chariot to Gundicha Ghar. 

On the journey there and back, Lord Jagannatha is accompanied by a huge procession 

of people, singing and celebrating. 

The festival has been celebrated since ancient times 

and finds mention in the Puranas. Each deity has his/her own chariot, which are 

replicas of the temple. They are made of neem wood and Lord Jagannatha?s 

chariot is called Nandighosha. The chariots are pulled by devotees, who believe 

the act will secure them a place in heaven.

Once the chariots have reached their destination, 

the momentum settles down. The week passes quietly, with only locals offering 

prayers to the deities. The journey back to the temple consists of another ritual, 

observed on a much smaller scale, known as Phera Rath Yatra. Every year, the great 

chariots are broken down and their wood is sold as relics. A replica is made on 

exactly the same pattern the next year. However the images of the deities are 

preserved.

Kumbh Mela, Haridwar, Prayag, Ujjain and Nasik

 This is a festival that attracts millions from 

around the country and the world. Believers aim to take a dip in the sacred waters 

at Haridwar, Prayag, Ujjain and Nasik. According to legend, the gods and demons 

collectively churned the sea and produced amrit (immortal juice). In the 

tussle that followed the pot was shifted from place to place and wherever this 

was shifted, there was some spillage. These places were Prayag, Haridwar, Ujjain 

and Nasik. The Kumbh fair is held at these places every three years. 

The confluence of the three holy rivers ? Ganga, Yamuna 

and Saraswathi also marks the importance of the Kumbh Mela destinations. The fair 

has to be witnessed for its sheer extravagant size. Scores of sadhus, sanyasis 

and tourists make it a point to visit the sacred waters to wash away their sins.

Leh and Ladakh Festivals

 Festivals in Ladakh are the occasions for merry-making. 

These festivals provide people with ample opportunities to interact with each 

other, form new ties and renew the old ones. Many of the annual festivals of the 

gompas take place in winter, which is a relatively quiet time for a majority 

of the people. The festivals are organised every year by the Kashmir and Jammu 

Tourism Department in collaboration with the local communities and the district 

government administrations.

The Hemis Festival

 Hemis is the biggest and most famous of the 

monastic festivals. It is held every 10th day of the lunar month and is celebrated 

as the birthday of Padmasambhava, the founder of Tibetan Buddhism. Held for two 

days, the festival showcases the cultural heritage of the region and features 

the colourful dresses of the people and their enthralling moods. Also on display 

at the festival are an array of handicrafts. 

Dosmoche Festival

 Dosmoche, the festival of the scapegoat, is 

celebrated with great enthusiasm in Leh. Falling in the second half of February, 

Dosmoche is one of two New Year festivals. At Dosmoche, a great wooden mast decorated 

with streamers and religious emblems is set up outside Leh. At the appointed time, 

offerings of storma (ritual figures moulded out of dough) are brought out 

and ceremonially cast away in the desert, or burnt. These scapegoats carry away 

with them the evil spirits of the old year, and thus the town is cleansed and 

made ready to welcome the New Year.

Losar Festival

 This spectacular festival celebrates the Ladakhi/Tibetan 

New Year. Festivities last for two weeks during December or January depending 

on the lunar calander. All Ladakhi Buddhists celebrate it by making offerings 

it to the gods, both in gompas and in their domestic shrines. The festival 

is marked by ancient rituals, stage fights between good and evil and chanting 

and passing through the crowds with fire torches.

The Elephant March, Jaipur

 Jaipur has a long, colourful association with 

elephants. The Rajasthan Tourism revived the tradition by including the Elephant 

Festival in the cultural calendar. During Holi, the festival of colours, to herald 

the advent of spring, the Jaipur Chaugan is brought alive with elephants, dancers, 

musicians and onlookers from all over the globe. The festival starts with an impressive 

procession of the majestic animals, lovingly painted and attired in glittering 

ornaments and embroidered velvets.

The elephants greet the visitors, offer garlands to 

the guests and walk past the ramp before a jury of experts and tourists who select 

the most smartly turned-out animal for the ?Best decorated Elephant? shield. There?s 

also a game of elephant polo, a newly-introduced sport. To get a feel of their 

true strength, join hands with the ten people who take part in the tug-of-war 

with the largest elephant. Then there is the unique ?Gaj Shringar? exhibition 

displaying everything connected with elephants ? ornaments, textiles (jhoo 

howdahs and carriages, paintings, medicines and food.

Desert Festival of Rajasthan

 Held in the months of January-February, the 

Desert Festival is Rajasthan at its best. For three days, the otherwise barren 

land comes to life as hordes of colourfully dressed people congregate. In fact, 

during these days, Rajasthan gets a chance to parade its exuberant charm to the 

world. Some chosen and cherished moments of the glorious past and affluent culture 

are on display. The traditional dances backed by high-pitched music take the folk 

dancers and the audience on an euphoric trip. The turban-tying competition and 

the commercialised Mr Desert Contest add a touch of excitement to the festivities.

Desert Kite Festival

 January 14 is celebrated as Makar Sankranti 

in many parts of India. The festival is held to mark the movement of the sun into 

the Northern Hemisphere. It is also a popular day to fly kites in several parts 

of India when children can be seen with their heads turned to the sky. In cities 

like Jaipur and Ahmedabad, kites virtually blot out the sky. Everyone joins in 

this riotous celebration and shouts of ?Woh kata hai? reverberate from 

rooftops to the accompaniment of drum beats as adversaries? kites are brought 

down.

Camel Festival

 The Camel Festival begins with a colourful 

procession of bedecked camels, in front of the red sandstone Junagarh Fort. Colourful 

bridles, bejewelled necks, jingling anklets and long, lanky camel shadows on dusky 

sands, cast a magic spell. The jubilant, skirt-swirling Gair dancers, the awe 

inspiring Fire dance, and dazzling fire-works light up the fortified desert city 

of Bikaner.

The festivities move to the open sandspreads of the 

Polo Grounds, followed by camel races, camel milking, fur cutting design, the 

best breed competition, camel acrobatics, camel bands and watching all this, are 

the gaping spectators. The camels display amazing foot-work, dancing at the direction 

of their riders, making it an experience to remember.

On the festival route

Shruti Seth, veejay

 I have been to the Goa Carnival but as a child. Naturally, I dont remember 

too much about it except for the crowds. The gaudy clothes, the masks and the 

music was all very heady and interesting. I plan to go back sometime and see the 

carnival as it is today.

 Jayabrato Chatterjee, author and filmmaker

 Id gone to shoot in Ajmer where the Pushkar mela is held and my memories 

of that experience are still vivid. Im not a very religious person but what 

was very moving was the faith of so many people, old, young, even disabled, whod 

congregated from across the country. This apart, I found the cattle fair extremely 

colourful and beautiful. 

 Meher Sarid, wedding planner

 I went to the Kumbh Mela about eight years ago with a few friends who were 

foreigners. They were fascinated with the picture that Kumbh presented, especially 

the Naga sadhus with their huge tilaks. The Pushkar Mela, which I visited about 

seven years ago, was filled with colours, fun and frolic. I loved the camel-selling 

and the flea market.

The question confronting every retailer is what 

encourages a customer to shop in one store rather than the other? The answer is, 

a co-ordinated effort that includes marketing, merchandising, store design, and 

visual merchandising. Yes, visual merchandising is the language that retailers 

use to communicate with the targeted customer. It is the art of grabbing the shoppers 

attention, broadening the perception of the product on display and thereby initiating 

its purchase. It gives passion and pizzazz to the retailing business.

Visual merchandising is essentially the basic methodology of presentation i.e. 

arranging items for display including design, composition, colour, props, mannequins, 

lighting, and more. Its general use is in merchandise and store displays, including 

window dressing. An integral part of any commercial space today, visual merchandising 

gives it a competitive edge over other establishments dealing in similar products. 

What do i have to do? 

 Visual merchandisers come in contact with the wonderful world of mannequins, 

meet leaders from all sectors of the design community, develop and instal merchandise 

presentations at retail establishments. Additionally, they design sets for the 

annual fashion shows. 

 Visual merchandisers: Create dynamic wall presentations using a variety 

of fixtures, signs, visual props, and mannequin alternatives. Explain how 

to use wall presentations to enhance selling. Create tabletop and wall 

presentations. Design a sign layout. Co-ordinate fashions by end 

use, fabrication, and colour. Create an idea board for presentations to 

executives. Follow guidelines for dressing and maintaining mannequins. 

 Dress a display hanger with a co-ordinated outfit. Determine lighting 

priorities. Plan layouts and fixtures for grocery and food stores. 

Select key locations for product displays. Develop a special event or fashion 

show concept. Plan effective window display merchandise themes to meet 

retail goals. Develop strategies for placing mannequins so they match a 

stores image. Identify the basic supplies and tools needed for a 

visual-merchandising department. 

What should I study? 

 The basic qualification required for the diploma course, is a pass in your 

Class X examination. For postgraduate programmes, you should be a graduate in 

any field. The courses are designed to introduce students to the best practices 

and strategies in visual merchandising. The visual merchandising course exposes 

students to an in-depth analysis of the retail store environment. 

 Students visit local retail establishments to view displays and engage in on-site 

investigation and documentation of successful design and merchandising practices. 

Students learn basic drawing techniques used by retail designers to indicate and 

communicate store layout and design concepts. 

What are the prospects? 

 Visual merchandising is a comparatively new field that has sprung up with the 

growing popularity of window and floor displays. Visual merchandisers can find 

employment with fashion boutiques, shopping malls, emporia etc. They are also 

engaged as shop floor managers. They can do freelancing on contract basis for 

window displays in exhibitions, fairs and other places. Other options available 

are production co-ordinator, quality control supervisor, fashion retailer, export 

manager etc. You can also be employed as product and brand executives in buying 

houses, advertising agencies, wholesale organisations and trading houses. 

 With hands-on experience in display, product presentation and design, visual 

merchandisers may move into middle management and senior management positions. 

As most cities are witnessing a massive expansion of department stores and hyper 

markets like Shoppers Stop, Ebony, Big Jos, Arcus, Westside, and Forum, 

there is a growing demand for professionally trained and talented visual merchandisers.

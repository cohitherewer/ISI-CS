The Telegraph - Calcutta : KnowHOW

More visas to USA

 In the coming year we want more student visas to the US and a more student-friendly visa interview process 

Sushmita Basu sifted nervously through her papers as she waited for her turn to be interviewed at the US consulate last June. ?Do you really plan to come back? Your course suggests you intend to work in USA,? thundered the visa officer. ?No, but I?..?. Sushmita wasn?t allowed to defend herself and was asked to leave the room without the visa. She was in tears. The eighteen year-old had a full scholarship from a leading US university but it still wasn?t enough. 

Every year, thousands of students go through the ordeal and a fair number fail to clear this last hurdle. The situation has worsened post 9/11. In the last three years, applications to US universities have dropped sharply. In the same period, the number of student visas issued by the US has gone down from 24,000 to 17,000. And in 2004-05, the country is expected to issue less than 16,000 student visas. 

Well, that?s not what we expect. Or want. Come 2005, what we want for our students who?ve bagged scholarships to study in the US are more student visas and a less arbitrary and more student-friendly visa interview process. 

Indeed, there is absolutely no way of ensuring that you will get that all-important visa. It depends entirely on the discretion of the visa officer. You can only try to answer all questions and provide all the requisite data. Strangely enough, a full scholarship may not be enough. ?You need to demonstrate your ties with India in the form of a job, family business, property etc. In case you don?t have a scholarship, you must be able to show your sources of funds, at least for the first year. Also, the officer must be convinced that the applicant is serious about the course he is taking up and that he isn?t going there just for the heck of it,? says education counsellor Shekhar Niyogi of Education Unlimited. 

Fair enough. But denying visa to a full scholarship-holder is perhaps a little too harsh. Let?s have a less intimidating system that won?t scare the applicant to death. As it is, the student has to run around, do in-depth research on universities, correspond and get the application package ready. It?s a long and tedious process. ?At the end of it you feel exhausted and then comes this interview. Other than your certificates, marksheets, application and the university, you could be quizzed on anything under the sun. If you stutter even for a second, your chances might be ruined for they won?t wait for you to phrase a plausible reply,? says Sanjoy Halder who took the interview a few years ago. 

As to the question of being able to convince the visa officer of your intent to come back, really, why have this exercise in the first place? ?Let?s be less hypocritical,? says a student who is now studying in the US, ?How many of those who go there for engineering or management do actually come back?? 

There is perhaps a case for giving visas to all scholarship awardees. Or, they should at least be given a second chance to prove their worth in case they fail in the first interview. Again, does taking up an outlandish course in an obscure university necessarily mean that the student is not serious? But any counsellor would advise you against it for ?it could be difficult to explain to the visa officer?. 

Today, those taking the interview in Calcutta are having to jostle for time and space with applicants from Chennai and Hyderabad. The consulate conducts more than 160 interviews a day. It leaves very little time for an individual and that makes the interview even more chancy. 

While eyeball photography and fingerprinting has been widely publicised, very few youngsters know that the USEFI conducts regular workshops on visa applications. Even those who do, rarely bother to attend them. ?It could be of great help. More than anything else, it gives you a lot of confidence for the advice is coming from the right quarters,? explains Semanti Sinha Roy who will be joining the Pittsburgh State University next month. She was among the lucky few who had it easy at the interview last week. She was asked why she chose the university and the course and a ?few other questions?. ?It got over in three minutes. That day everyone had it easy,? she says. Let?s hope the trend continues in 2005. 

NEW-LOOK SAT 

The exam that serves as the passport to US universities will wear a new look from May 2005. SAT I will now contain a writing section with multiple-choice questions on grammar and usage. It will also include an essay. In the verbal section, analogies are being done away with while short reading passages are being added to the existing long reading ones. Math will be tougher. It is being expanded to include topics from third year college preparatory math. Quantitative comparisons will be eliminated. 

Apart from the multiple-choice questions on grammar and usage, students will be asked to write a short piece that requires them to take a position on an issue and use examples to support their position. These questions will be similar to the writing skill test in SAT II. The new format is in line with the curriculum in high schools in the US. 

Math will include topics like exponential growth, absolute value, functional notation and there will be greater emphasis on linear functions and properties of tangent lines. ISC students may now have an edge for, the new areas are included in their syllabus. Since SAT candidates usually don?t take the state or the IIT-JEE, preparing for the board exam may now suffice for them. The time limit for the test has been extended by 45 minutes and the maximum score is up by 800 points. 

The question that?s now doing the rounds is whether the new format will be tougher. According to the USEFI, it will be different but not necessarily more difficult. ?For 2005 enrolment, the old SAT I scores will be accepted. But it remains to be seen whether colleges accept them subsequently,? says Sevanti Narayan, education counsellor at USEFI. As of now, SAT I scores remain valid for five years.

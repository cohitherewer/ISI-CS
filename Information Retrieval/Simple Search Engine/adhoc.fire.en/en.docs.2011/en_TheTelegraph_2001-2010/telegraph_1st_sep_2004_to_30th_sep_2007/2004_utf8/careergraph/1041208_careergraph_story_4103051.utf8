PERVIN MALHOTRA 

Director, CARING (Career Guidance India), New Delhi

Q:After completing MSc, I am now working 

as a junior officer in a public sector bank. Please suggest some courses that 

will enable me to equip myself to adapt to the changes in the banking sector.

Saurish Pal

A: The financial sector in India is largely 

dominated by banking. With increasing deregulation, changing customer needs, the 

prevalence of telebanking and the consumer calling the shots, this sector is now 

facing continuous challenge, as must be evident in your day-to-day working. This 

is an interesting field, but with the dynamics changing so frequently, particularly 

in consumer banking, ongoing learning is a critical ingredient for success.

As all business transactions are now conducted electronically, 

a course in e-commerce would help. At the higher end, Oracle DBA/Financials may 

be a good bet. 

Yet another option for you, considering that you have 

done your MSc, would be the MTech (IT) programme offered by the Institute of Development 

 amp; Research in Banking Technology (established by the RBI). This multi-disciplinary 

course offers specialisation in banking technology and information security in 

collaboration with the University of Hyderabad.

While direct recruits (BE/BTech/MCA/ MSc maths/physics/CS 

or equivalent are admitted on the basis of GATE scores (85 per cent plus), employees 

of banks and financial institutions with three years of work experience can apply 

under the sponsored category. 

Institute of Development amp; Research in Banking 

Technology (IDRBT) also offers a distance-learning programme, which you may find 

convenient. There is currently an acute shortage of system security experts in 

the banking industry. 

Selection is on the basis of an all-India entrance 

exam, group discussion and interview. For details, log on to the IDRBT website: 

www.idrbt.com.

Creative path to success

writing. Please advise.

Creative courses are available in Hindi in both these universities. 

Karnataka State Open University, Manasgangotri, Mysore 570006. Website: www.ksoumysore.com/

and can be pursued at your own pace.

MBA with industrial microbiology

Q: I am doing BSc in industrial microbiology. 

Would combining industrial microbiology and MBA offer better prospects?

Shefali Misra

A: Industrial microbiology finds important 

applications in the pharmaceutical and food industries and in medicine and agriculture. 

Industrial microbiologists work with microorganisms or microbes such as bacteria, 

viruses, fungi and their metabolism to produce such products as antibiotics, amino 

acids, citric acids, Vitamin C, etc. 

This technique finds wide application in food, dairy, 

alcohol and agrobased industries and those involving fermentation processes. Besides 

enhancing the value of natural foods, it is used for developing artificial fibres 

with the help of enzymes and in manufacturing oils, paints and plastics. 

Biotechnology (the control of biosynthesis through 

genetic engineering) is a development of industrial microbiology that has helped 

develop new chemicals and drugs and special membranes used in microelectronics. 

The nature of work in the field of microbiology is 

essentially scientific and researchoriented. With a PG/ doctoral qualification 

in microbiology, you can work in pharmaceutical companies, chemical industry, 

wine manufacturing and food industries as well as in research laboratories run 

by the government and corporate sector. Prospects of a career in this field are 

very bright. 

Combining MBA with your degree in industrial microbiology 

will certainly be an asset as you can then pitch for a manageriallevel job in 

any of the relevant industries. Interestingly, Department of Management Sciences, 

University of Pune, even offers an MBA (biotechnology). For details log on to 

website: www.unipune.ernet.in.

Q: I am in Class XI (arts). Am I eligible 

to pursue a medical course? Please advise.

Kumud Jhamwal

A: Unfortunately, to enrol for any kind of 

medical course you must have studied science subjects (physics, chemistry and 

biology) at the Ten Plus Two level. The only way you could come anywhere close 

to medicine is by way of taking psychology or social work at the postgraduate 

level so that you can become a medical social worker or clinical psychologist 

which involves working with patients and their relatives in a hospital or clinic, 

or assisting a psychiatrist in handling cases which require counselling.

Takes 

Short Takes

BITS goes online

The Birla Institute of Technology and Sciences will conduct online tests for admission to its Pilani and Goa campuses from next year. Till now, BITS admitted students on the basis of their Class XII board results.

The three-hour test, common for admissions to all courses offered by the institute, will be on the pattern of the GRE and will comprise 150 questions on physics, chemistry, mathematics, English proficiency and logical reasoning. But, unlike GRE, candidates can appear for the test only once. A sample test will be made available at www.bits-pilani.ac.in/BITSAT from February 1, 2005. 

GRADE SYSTEM

Calcutta University is all set to switch to grades and a semester pattern from 2006. A committee has been formed to decide on these reforms. The committee will submit its report on the reforms by early 2005. Among other things, it will decide if there should be six grades (A+, A, B+, B, C+ and C). Committee members felt the present system of marks was putting too much pressure on students. 

TENDER LOVING CARE

After Shiladitya Sengupta committed suicide in his room at Shibpur Bengal Engineering College on December 13, the college authorities have decided to have a counsellor made available to the students so that the depressed and emotionally-disturbed among them have someone to talk to. Sengupta?s was the third suicide at BE College this year. Initially, the counsellor will interact with students thrice a week. 

OLD MAGIC

Critics of modern education standards seized on a rediscovered Victorian exam paper for 11-year-olds which they claim proves that tests have been ?dumbed down?. The Spectator magazine published entrance exams for King Edward?s School in Birmingham in 1898 that would tax most adults today, let alone children leaving primary school. The questions covered Latin, details of British history, English grammar, and math.

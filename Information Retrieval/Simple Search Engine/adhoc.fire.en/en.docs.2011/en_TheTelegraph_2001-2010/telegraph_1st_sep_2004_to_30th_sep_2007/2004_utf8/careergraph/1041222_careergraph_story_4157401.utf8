Best among the best

BusinessWeek?s survey of the top-30 B-schools in the 

US holds a few surprises. Abhinay Dey reports

 PILLARS OF KNOWLEDGE: The main building of Northwestern University?s Kellogg Business School 

When the class of 2004 entered their respective B-schools in the US, September 11 was fresh in their memory and the devastated economy an indicator of the bad days ahead. They watched with horror as the class of 2002 found recruiters reneging on job offers. Clearly, it was not the best of times to enter a B-school.

However, going by BusinessWeek?s (BW?s) biennial survey of the top-30 business schools in the US, their worries were largely unfounded. Because after the gloomy recruitment seasons of 2002 and 2003, this year saw recruiters return in droves. 

According to the BusinessWeek?s rankings, Northwestern University?s Kellogg School of Business retains its summit position among the top-30 B-schools in the country, for the second year running. BW attributes Kellogg?s success to ?the balance between an in-depth academic experience and a welcoming culture?. In a year when MBA students rebelled against academic corner-cutting and sloppy ethics, Kellogs?s achievement is a high-water mark of sorts, adds the report.

Rival University of Chicago Graduate School of Business also retained its second spot from the 2002 survey. It landed the number two position in the overall rankings, the third time since the rankings began in 1998. Chicago?s grads were hands-down favourites in the BW survey of the companies recruiting MBAs. In fact, Chicago got more marks than Kellogg on customer (students and recruiters) satisfaction. It is interesting to note here that Kellogg tops the list in ethics in the recruiters? survey and Chicago doesn?t even figure in the ethics top-10 list.

While Kellogg and Chicago retained their respective positions in the rankings this year, University of Pensylvania?s Wharton School of Business and Harvard Business School swapped places for the third and the fifth positions. The fourth place went to Stanford University, which again retained its position from the last survey.

Harvard Business School?s fall from the third to the fifth position, however, has not affected the compensation offered to its grads. It notched the second position after Stanford in getting the highest median pay for its graduates. A number from the survey will give a clearer picture ? ?Ninety-four per cent of the class of 2004 of Harvard had at least one job offer by the time they graduated.? A contrast from last year, when nearly 35 per cent of the top B-school grads were left knocking on the doors of employers. 

However, there are some well-known B-schools that have fallen drastically in the rankings. The University of South California?s (USC) Marshall School of Business recorded the steepest decline, falling 10 spots to no. 27 in the overall rankings and nine spots to no. 23 in the student polls. 

This despite its class of 2004 boasting the highest average GMAT scores in the school?s history. BW quotes a graduate of the school who says, ?The administration failed to match the calibre of the students with an equally tough and challenging curriculum.?

The other big names that followed USC in the decline in the overall rankings are Yale (slipped eight places to no. 22), Berkeley (fell from 13 to 17), University of Maryland?s Smith School of Business (went down three places to no. 28) and Massachusetts Institute of Technology?s Sloan School of Management (slipped three places to the no. 9 position).

The schools that recorded the highest jumps in the rankings include Purdue University?s Krannert School of Business (rose five places to no. 21), Notre Dame university?s Mendoza School of Business (jumped five places to no. 24), Georgetown University (landed the 25th position from last year?s 30th), the prestigious Cornell and Carnegie Mellon universities (both posted a jump of four places to stand at nos 7 and 15 respectively).

As the offers from recruiters poured in, the students? criteria for accepting an offer saw 32.3 per cent saying that ?challenging duties? was the most important factor. Surprisingly, only 8.5 per cent of the respondents felt pay package was the most important factor.

Consequently, one of the biggest changes this year, according to the BW report, is the awareness among students that leadership is important. Now, that is something, given that many students from these elite B-schools ?already see themselves destined for the corner office?.

For wannabe managers

Dear friends, its the season of management entrance 

tests so this weeks website is for wannabe MBAs. It is called www.indiabschools.com 

and it is hosted by the centre for forecasting and research (C-Fore), a company 

that conducts opinion polls and market research for various media publications. 

The homepage is designed as a chessboard where all 

the sections are arranged. Some important sections include admission notices, 

website of B-schools, entrance tests, mock CAT, tuition fees, rating and ranking 

of B-schools, MBA abroad etc.

Since this is part of a market research firm, the 

website gives you a lot of advantages. For instance, in the B-schools ranking 

section you get the latest C-fore-Outlook ratings on the best Indian B-schools 

and also the previous years ratings. This will help you in choosing the 

right B-school. 

If you are interested in studying abroad, the MBA 

abroad section will be a lot of help. There is information on US, UK, Australia, 

New Zealand and for a change, information on B-schools in Hong Kong, Thailand 

and Singapore as well. 

In the entrance test section you get information on 

the major MBA entrance tests in the country like the CAT, MAT, XAT and JMET. You 

also get an analysis of the pattern of questions and some suggestions. In short, 

this site has almost everything that you wanted to know about MBA exams. 

There is a free online journal called Spark that gives 

you articles on various specialisations like HR, marketing systems etc. This site 

is not only for the aspirants but also for professionals as well as teachers. 

This is easily one of the best sites on MBA that I have come across. Check it 

out.

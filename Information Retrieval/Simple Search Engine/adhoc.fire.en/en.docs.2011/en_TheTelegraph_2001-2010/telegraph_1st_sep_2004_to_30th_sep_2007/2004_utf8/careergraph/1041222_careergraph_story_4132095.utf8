The wedding planner

Q: I want to know about wedding management. 

From where can I pursue such a course? Please advise.

Shilpi Sen 

A: With themes ranging from Lebanese, Egyptian 

and Japanese to floral and Gothic, designer weddings have become the order of 

the day. As people have less and less time to plan the hundred and one nitty-grittys, 

wedding planners and coordinators have become an integral part of modern day weddings. 

Making sure that every detail is taken care of, they 

provide expertise in planning and coordinating the event. Wedding coordination 

does not require a huge investment. A small office and minimal staff will do. 

The only requirement is perfect coordination between different service providers 

at the wedding.

Several educational websites, including zeduniv.com 

and zeelearn.com offer courses in wedding management. The course content 

is designed to help you set up your business and learn the ropes of this fascinating 

business. 

It comprises seven modules, including different Indian 

weddings, pre-wedding arrangements, ceremony management, post-wedding arrangements, 

skills needed to become a wedding coordinator, self-marketing and advertising. 

The online course is followed by a workshop or a project. 

The project includes training in negotiation, networking, customs and rituals, 

and costing and budgeting. It also includes coordinating a wedding under the supervision 

of an expert. 

A word of caution: Although these courses are extremely 

useful, they dont guarantee entry into the profession. Working with an established 

wedding coordination agency would help you gain the necessary hands-on experience. 

Being a seasonal business, some wedding planners also 

branch out into party management.

The right formula for research in chemistry

Q: I am a student of BSc chemistry. 

I would like to pursue research, but I am not sure if I am cut out for it. Please 

advise.

Madhur Bhandari

A: Anyone who wishes to be a scientist, must 

be prepared to study at least up to the PhD level, if not beyond, by way of formal 

education. Your work will require you to study and research throughout your career. 

You also need loads of patience and hard work for research. 

Here are a couple of options that will really help 

you decide: I think you should try and work in a lab during your summer holidays 

in each of the three years of your BSc degree. The Indian Academy of Science, 

Bangalore, offers summer research fellowships to bright students to work with 

fellows of the academy on research-oriented projects. Approximately, 75 such fellowships 

are offered every year with two-way travel and living expenses between April and 

July. Watch out for the notice on their website in November-December. If selected, 

you will be notified by February-March. 

The list of fellows who are willing to accept students 

for working on joint short-term projects is posted on the website: www.ias.ac.in. 

Your application should include your brief r eacute;sum eacute; (see format on 

website), a one-page description of your planned activity, the fellow with whom 

you would like to work, your tentative date of visit and a recommendation letter 

from a teacher who is familiar with your work. Send to the Executive Secretary, 

Indian Academy of Sciences, C.V. Raman Avenue, P.O. Box No.8005, Sadashivanagar 

P.O., Bangalore 560 080 by January 31, 2005. 

Similarly, the CSIR Programme on Youth for Leadership 

in Science (CPYLS) offers 

opportunities for academically brilliant students and those who have secured very 

high marks in their board exams. Students who have secured 90 per cent marks in 

natural sciences in the senior secondary exam who wish to pursue studies in science 

are supported by CSIR throughout the bachelors degree level. 

As a CSIR Student Associate you will enjoy 

the opportunity of working on a project in a CSIR lab of your interest during 

your vacations. CSIR will also meet your travel expenses, provide hostel accommodation 

besides giving you a studentship of Rs 500 per week. For details, log onto: http: 

//csirhrdg.nic.in/ cpyls.htm. Bright students like you must avail of these opportunities. 

Even if you dont go in for PhD, they serve as an excellent learning experience.

Catering to the hotel industry

Q: How tough is the competition for admission 

to the hotel management institutes under the National Council? How should I prepare 

for the interview and GD? How much do trainees earn after passing out?

Nikhil Gupta

A: NCHMCTs entrance test is very competitive 

but unlike most other courses, there is no GD or interview. Moreover, NCHMCT has 

introduced a decentralised counselling to make the admission process more transparent 

and save students time and money. The counselling is conducted in the four metros. 

NCHMCT is also thinking of adding more seats. Placement is expected to touch 85-90 

per cent thanks to the boom in the hospitality sector. Trainees get Rs 5,000- 

6,000 at start. However, not all IHMs are of equal standing. Some enjoy a better 

reputation in the industry than others. But thats shouldnt affect 

you now. Just make sure you prepare well and get a high score.

Testability

Civil services exam

 Prelims: Optionals 

The civil services are the most prestigious of all careers 

in India. Continuing with our special series, Subhas Chakraborty tells 

you how to approach the exam

We may now turn to the optional subjects for the Preliminary 

examination. One has to offer only one subject, but the subject should be chosen 

with care. Here, it is very useful to keep the Mains examination in mind. There 

should be one common subject for both the Preliminary and the Mains examinations. 

It may help to choose the subject one has done graduation or postgraduation in. 

The second subject for the Mains then could be an allied subject. For example, 

if you have majored in history, it is better to offer it for both the examinations. 

The second subject for the Mains may be political science/public administration/sociology/anthropology/geography. 

We shall return to the possible combinations later.

Analyse and synthesise

We will recall that the questions for the optional 

subjects in the Preliminary examination are of objective, multiple-choice type. 

Let us briefly look at the rationale behind the framing of these questions. This 

type of test aims at evaluating not only the information that a candidate has 

mustered, but also his/her understanding. The questions are devised to judge a 

candidate?s ability to analyse complex situations and find appropriate solutions. 

The ability of a candidate to synthesise scattered bits of information into a 

meaningful whole is also tested. The questions are objective, but of various types.

The first type simply tests the information base. 

These are relatively easier to answer if you have the information asked for. Sometimes 

the question is an incomplete statement and the responses are alternative ways 

of completing that statement. You may be asked to give the correct sequence of 

some events in the history of India. Another type is matching one set with another. 

These are, however, mostly based on information.

The other types are meant for testing understanding 

and the ability for application. In some questions there are two statements: one 

is an Assertion (A), and the second is Reason (R). There are four responses: a) 

if both are correct and R explains A, b) if both are correct, but R does not explain 

A, c) if A is correct and R is wrong, and d) if A is incorrect and R is correct. 

We shall give examples of these sets.

History is a very popular subject for competitive 

examinations. The percentage of success with history as a combination is not very 

high, but many of the successful candidates have history as one of the subjects. 

The total number of students offering history is high. One reason for this is 

that everyone has read history in school. Therefore, Indian history in particular 

is broadly familiar. And, for the Preliminary examination, one has to study only 

Indian history. 

Comprehensive paper

The syllabus for history is divided into three sections: 

the first section starts with prehistoric cultures and continues up to c.750 AD. 

The second section includes the early medieval period, the Sultanate and the rise 

and fall of the Mughal period. The last section covers the period from c.1740 

to 1964. The syllabus then compresses three (now four) papers of Indian history 

into one. 

The syllabus is pretty comprehensive as all the regions 

get due emphasis. To begin with, it is essential to know the broad outline of 

political developments over the centuries. Then social, economic, religious and 

cultural aspects of Indian history through the ages need to be studied in some 

details. The history of the Indian National Movement is a very important segment. 

Consulting the questions of earlier years would be of help.

For the love of English

Nearly five hundred years ago, there was a gentleman 

in England called William Shakespeare. He wrote plays and created characters that 

stirred the masses. Even today, his plays stir students of English literature, 

some with excitement and some with trepidation. No wonder that some of you keep 

asking for resources on Shakespeare. So this week I have for you a website that 

is absolutely a treasure-trove for all students of Shakespeare.

One look at the homepage of www.absoluteshakespeare.com 

and you know you?ve really hit the jackpot. Plays, sonnets, poems, summaries, 

quotes ? it?s all there. So where do we begin? That?s a good question to ask because 

there is so much to explore, but I would say ?Begin at the beginning? as the king 

tells the white rabbit in Alice in Wonderland ?and go on till you come to the 

end: then stop?!

However, it?s up to you to decide where to begin. 

If you?ve had your introduction to the Bard and his plays you may want to go straight 

to the ?Study guides? section on the right hand side of the homepage. The plays 

listed here include the ones you?ll find in most school and undergraduate syllabi. 

They include Hamlet, Julius Caesar, Henry IV, King Lear, Macbeth, Merchant 

of Venice, Othello, Romeo and Juliet, The Tempest and Twelfth Night. And 

wait till you hear what you get when you click on each of these plays. You find 

plot summary, detailed commentary on the play, character sketches of the dramatist 

personae, and essays by well-known Shakespearean scholars. 

If you are interested in Shakespeare trivia there 

is a whole lot of stuff in the ?Trivia? section just below the ?Study guides?. 

You can?t afford to miss it.

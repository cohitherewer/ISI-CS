CIVIL SERVICES EXAM

General studies

The civil services are the most prestigious of all careers 

in India. Continuing with our special series, Subhas Chakraborty tells 

you how to approach the exam

The component parts of this paper are: general science, 

current events of national and international importance, history of India and 

Indian national movement, Indian and world geography, Indian polity and economy 

and general mental ability. 

Questions on general science test the understanding 

of science that is expected of an educated person. The standard is of Class X 

level and detailed or specialised knowledge on any particular branch of science 

is not expected. If you have studied science at the graduate level or thereafter, 

it may still be useful to look at the old Class X and Class XII science textbooks. 

The same advice may be given to the arts students.

Tough questions

Though the syllabus says that only very general questions 

will be asked, the questions are sometimes quite tough. It helps to refresh oneself 

about the basics of science. In physics such topics as physical quantities, standards 

and units, mechanics and properties of matter, heat, motion, electromagnetic radiation, 

light, sound, magnetism, static and current electricity, atomic physics, nuclear 

physics and astronomy are important. Chemical reactions and the chemical equation, 

periodic table of elements, chemical bonding, oxidation and reduction, oxygen 

and air, hydrogen and water, carbon, nitrogen and their compounds, acids, salts, 

gas, environmental chemistry and pollution, polymers and plastics, dyes, biochemistry, 

agricultural and medicinal chemistry are the major topics in chemistry. 

For the biological sciences, it is imperative to know 

about cells, classification of the living body, organisation of the living body, 

nutrition, respiration, metabolism, bio-communication, reproduction, plant growth 

and development, human diseases etc.

Consulting questions set in the last five years will 

indicate the type of questions that are set on these topics. The NCERT text books 

for Class X and Class XII are highly recommended. You should also read a general 

studies compendium which gives a fair sampling of questions as well. Tata McGraw-Hill?s 

or Unique?s general studies manuals are good.

Learning from the past

The part on Indian history emphasises a broad understanding 

of the country?s history in its social, economic and political aspects. The awakening 

in the 19th century, the emergence of Indian nationalism and the attainment of 

independence constitute the segment on the Indian national movement. These are 

very important sections of the syllabus and sometimes more than 40 questions are 

set from these two sections. 

Indian history includes developments from the ancient 

period to the attainment of independence and beyond. The period is very long and 

not easy to manage. Divide the entire period into ancient, medieval and modern 

and learn about the main currents in each period. The chronology of different 

dynasties, the major battles, the main religious systems, the principal socio-cultural 

movements, eminent authors and their works are some of the topics to be studied 

in this section. Here also an exposure to questions already asked will help. The 

NCERT books by Romila Thapar, Satish Chandra and Bipan Chandra will help for the 

part on Indian history. 

India?s Struggle for Independence by Bipan 

Chandra and others is more than adequate for the segment on Indian national movement. 

The history of the Indian National Congress, the revolutionary movements, the 

roles of Gandhi, Nehru and Subhas Bose, worker? and peasants? movements, constitutional 

arrangements, stages leading to the transfer of power are some of the aspects 

which need to be studied with emphasis.

Plastic Dreams 

 With the make-me-beautiful mantra catching on, cosmetic surgeons never had it so good. Abhinay Dey reports on the booming profession 

Remember the movie Face/Off, where John Travolta, who plays a cop, undergoes surgery to replace his face with that of the villain Nicholas Cage? While this is a screenwriter?s imagination running wild, today, the developments in the field of cosmetic surgery are not too far from the realm of fiction. 

Gone are the days when cosmetic surgery was seen mostly as a corrective procedure. Today, it is not only used to conceal or correct impairments or deformities but also to enhance your bodily features. If you want a nose job or a jawbone restructuring or a skin enhancement, cosmetic surgery is the answer. And the good news, for the profession at least, is that ageing movie stars are not the only ones going for it. 

Says Dr Aniruddha Bose, consultant cosmetic surgeon at the Apollo Gleneagles Hospital, Calcutta, ?It is a misconception that only the rich go for cosmetic surgery. I can give you loads of examples where people from middle-class backgrounds have come to me for advice. For instance, there was a teacher from Midnapore who came seeking help for his daughter or this tea vendor who wanted patches removed from his face.? 

Adds Dr Manoj Khanna, a cosmetic surgeon who runs his own clinic in Calcutta, ?There is increased awareness among people thanks to a booming media scene. Which is why 60-70 per cent of my patients are from the middle-class.? 

With cosmetic surgery going mainstream and almost every hospital opening a department of cosmetic surgery, there is now a huge demand for trained practitioners in the field. Cosmetic surgeons are highly skilled professionals who can transform the way one looks and hence, feels about oneself. So if you decide to opt for this career, you are sure to end up among the most well-paid surgeons in the country. 

But becoming the perfect cosmetic surgeon is no cakewalk. 

One of the nine sub-specialities of plastic surgery, 

cosmetic surgery is not a one-man show. A whole gamut of professionals are involved 

in creating that perfect look. In fact, one of the most important aspects of cosmetic 

surgery, Dr Bose says, is the psychological assessment of the person who wants 

to undergo the procedure. 

According to Dr J.R. Ram, consultant psychiatrist, Apollo Gleneagles, The 

desire to look good is integral to the mental well being of a person. So the problem 

sometimes is more in the mind than in the body. If it is a case of imagined ugliness, 

no amount of surgical enhancements can help. At the same time, there have 

been cases where cosmetic surgery has done wonders to the self-esteem of a person, 

adds Dr Ram. 

Art of the matter

 Another interesting aspect of a cosmetic surgeons training is the knowledge 

of art and aesthetics. Says Dr Bose, While studying in the UK, we had a 

course on the art of reconstructive surgery, which had lectures by professional 

artists on the evolution of art and sculpture over the ages. After all, if you 

dont know the works of, say, a Da Vinci or a Michelangelo, you dont 

know what a perfect body form is all about. 

 So how would you like to be part of a profession that is as much an art as 

a science? Its a job where, as Dr Khanna, says, One should have the 

eyes of an eagle, heart of a lion and the delicate fingers of a lady. Cosmetic 

surgery is also different from other branches of the medical profession. As Dr 

Bose points out, Elsewhere, the patient can measure the competence of the 

doctor based on whether his ailment is cured or not. But in cosmetic surgery, 

the satisfaction of the patient depends on his perception of the outcome.

Satisfaction is the key

 Satisfaction, it appears, is the keyword. And the level of satisfaction you 

can deliver to your patients depends on the kind of practice you have had in perfecting 

your craft. Consequently, the most important phase in the learning curve of a 

cosmetic surgeon begins only after you have completed your studies. Once you have 

completed your MBBS followed by an MS and MCh in plastic surgery, you have to 

pick up the tricks of the trade at a hospital for at least four to five years.

 Says Dr Madhumita Mukherjee, who has done her MS and is awaiting admission 

to the MCh course, This is such a specialised profession that ill-trained 

people have no place in it.

 Dr Bose, who has more than 20 years of practice behind him, feels that unless 

one has enough experience in hospitals under experienced practitioners, one shouldnt 

embark on an independent practice. Owing to its immense popularity, cosmetic surgery 

is, unfortunately, vulnerable to abuse by ill-trained professionals, says Dr Bose, 

adding, all aspiring cosmetic surgeons should endeavour to protect this 

beautiful profession from abuse.

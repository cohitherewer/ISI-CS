A play at gender bending

NEWS, VIEWS AND TRIVIA STRAIGHT FROM SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES

department. (Photo: Subhendu Chaki) 

There is a peal of laughter whenever you ask the Jadavpur 

University English department cast about their latest production, Measure for 

Measure. For, the play, performed at Gyan Manch on the 9th and 13th of this 

month, had hardly been lacking in backstage comic relief. 

?First of all, none of the guys had any prior experience 

of dressing in feminine attire. And the women hardly knew how uncomfortable a 

full beard could be,? says Debojoy Chanda, whose portrayal of a pregnant Juliet, 

complete with loud, hysterical sobs, drew guffaws from all corners of the hall. 

The final performance was a gender-bender of a different 

sort with the director Dr Ananda Lal asking the boys to take up all the women?s 

roles and the girls to wear the pants. The outcome was striking, to say the least, 

with Sreejita Deb?s cold and menacing Angelo pitted against Simon Jenning?s vulnerable 

Isabella. Karma Mingyur as the jaded prostitute Mistress Overdone from the sub-plot 

had the audience in splits. 

This was the first time the JU team has teamed up 

with a professional theatre group like Theatrician, and this has improved the 

overall production quality. The play was a resounding success, and as they say, 

all?s well that ends well.

Shakespeare meet

The third World Shakespeare Conference was held at 

Loreto College from December 5-8. A special feature this year was the play A 

Midsummer Nights Dream, produced by Loreto College in collaboration 

with the students of Rabindra Bharati University. Directed by Dr Brian C. Russo, 

Fulbright visiting lecturer in Performing Arts at the Franklin and Marshall College, 

Pennsylvania, the play was Indianised to an extent, although the script was left 

virtually unchanged. 

The play was staged in the college lawns where three 

different stages projected the three different worlds in the play ? the palace, 

the world of the commoners and that of the forest. Russo also discussed certain 

aspects of the play and pointed out how Shakespeare provides subtle stage-directions 

within the play itself.

In memoriam

On November 18, Gokhale Memorial Girls? College observed 

the death anniversary of their founder principal Dr Rani Ghosh. 

The quiet memorial ceremony opened with the song Aguner 

parashmoni choao praane, followed by a reading from the scriptures and remembering 

Rani Ghosh?s life and work. 

We felt overwhelmed by the years of dedicated, selfless 

service of the lady who shaped our present. The ceremony drew to a close with 

her favourite song Shara jibon dilo alo surjyo groho chand.

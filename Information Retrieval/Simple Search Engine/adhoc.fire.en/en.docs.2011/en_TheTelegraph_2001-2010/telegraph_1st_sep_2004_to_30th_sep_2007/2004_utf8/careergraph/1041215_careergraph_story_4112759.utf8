Subhankar Mukherjee, the first Indian to bag 

a full scholarship to the Vancouver Film School, writes of his experiences at 

the prestigious institute

 CANADA CALLING: The Vancouver Film School 

and (below) Subhankar Mukherjee 

It all began in December 2003. I was in Toronto working 

on an assignment for GlobalOm Media (a Canadian-German enterprise) when Vancouver 

Film School (VFS as it is popularly known) happened to me. 

Anyone who has anything to do with film and television 

knows about VFS? year-long Writing for Film, TV and Interactive Media programme 

that is revered in North America. I knew that with my portfolio (I had written 

for newspapers, radio and Internet magazines in India, Australia and Canada) and 

recommendations, I stood a chance of acquiring the prestigious VFS full-time scholarship. 

But it?s always a bit uncertain as you are pitched with the best . 

I applied and completed their creativity test. A couple 

of days later, I got a call. I was told that I had been selected and it was time 

for the all-important telephone interview. Head of the Department Dr Rob Gray 

interviewed me. Two days of nail-biting suspense later, I found a message in my 

answering machine asking me to pack my bags and head for Vancouver. I?d swung 

the scholarship, the first Indian to do so! 

VFS is an experience I?ll take to my grave. The programmes 

are only meant for people who are prepared for a hard grind. In these 11 months, 

I?ve seen nerves fail, tempers soar, lives sucked dry. On the other hand, I?ve 

also seen some emerge triumphant from it all.

Thanks to VFS, I?ve lived the fastest year of my life. 

From the minute the gun goes off, we put in 16-20 hours of work every day. The 

curriculum is rigorous, aimed not only at refining the writing of the budding 

storyteller, but also at turning his talent into marketable ideas. VFS students 

get to show their skills in diverse genres ? from feature films to sketch comedy 

and also learn to collaborate their ideas by working in groups. 

After VFS, no one watches films the same way ever. 

Students breathe films. Workshopping is regular and intense. Viewing, writing, 

analyses and critiquing your peers? work comprises a standard day. 

VFS trains you to kick open half-closed doors and 

turn adversity into profitable business ventures. While at VFS, I have scripted 

two spec scripts of The Simpsons, submitted a short for a festival and 

two feature films are ready to be optioned. I am also finishing a TV pilot, writing 

commercials and completed two documentary proposals. Two sitcoms (co-written) 

have just been produced along with a Web TV short, co-wrote a sketch comedy show 

and am finishing two feature films for Indian cinema. 

In this craft, an innocent misjudgment can wreck hours 

or days of work. The system believes only in survivors. People who come here often 

believe that they know the distance in light years to every star. That changes 

soon. And we realise how much more there is to the art of storytelling. 

We all know that in this line of work, failure is 

the rule and success, the exception. But with the VFS name with you, people look 

at you differently. Animation gurus, producers, directors, writers, editors, cinematographers 

often come down from Hollywood to meet students and share their experiences through 

creative workshops. 

As an individual, I realise that whatever I do has 

to be exemplary as I?m carrying India?s flag wherever I go.

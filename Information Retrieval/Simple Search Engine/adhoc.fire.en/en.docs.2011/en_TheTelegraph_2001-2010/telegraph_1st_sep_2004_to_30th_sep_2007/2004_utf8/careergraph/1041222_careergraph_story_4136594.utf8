At first glance, FORE School of Management (FSM) in New Delhi looks like a block of residential flats. Surrounded by trees on all sides, the light grey building of the Foundation for Organisational Research and Education (FORE), located in south Delhi?s Qutab institutional area, doesn?t quite look the centre of excellence in management education, research, training and consultancy that it?s said to be. But, then, looks can often be deceptive. Make no mistake, this is a serious business school with serious students. 

FSM was set up in 1981 as a non-profit society. Its mission was to achieve and sustain leadership in management education, research, consultancy and development. With the globalisation of the Indian economy, the search for trained managers intensified in the early Nineties. In 1992, the society decided to set up a management institute to provide post-graduate education in management. According to a recent BusinessWorld survey, FSM is now 11th among the top business schools of the country. 

The school offers five major courses ? a full-time two-year post-graduate diploma in business management (PGDBM), a part-time three-year PGDBM, a three-year masters of computer applications (MCA), a one-year MSc in international business management and a two-year part-time MBA in IT and international business. 

FORE offers good facilities to its students. The classes are air-conditioned and so are the lecture halls. The auditorium can seat 300 people and a beautiful, lush green garden is used as an open-air theatre. And it has as neighbours several leading management institutes such as the Indian Institute of Foreign Trade and the Indian Institute of Planning and Management. 

The library is well-equipped and fully computerised, with over 16,000 titles in management and related areas. Students and faculty members have access to inter-library institutional membership. The computer centre has six laboratories, and all computers are interconnected through the Ethernet-based LAN. 

As part of its student and faculty exchange programmes, FSM has forged ties with the Renne Business School, France. It also proposes to start a PhD-level doctoral programme with the Nottingham Trent University, UK. Says director Dr Seema Sanghi, ?The curriculum is regularly updated. We keep our students abreast of the latest developments in management thoughts, We believe in quality and not in quantity. Our aim is to produce entrepreneurs rather than employees.?

FSM has developed important links with many national and international companies to provide placement to the students. The placement cell is responsible for identifying the right organisation. They select, target and invite organisations to the campus for summer and final placements. 

On a lighter note, FSM also publishes an in-house journal and newsletter. The students organise an annual management festival called Genesis.

Not surprisingly, FSM students are a happy lot. Many stress that the faculty is experienced and co-operative. ?They are very helpful not only with our course but also with our personal problems,? says Abhishek, an outstation student. FORE provides leased hostel facilities, phones with STD and ISD and 24-hour Internet facilities. 

Nevertheless, life is hard. ?Most of us study for at least 16-18 hours,? says Abhishek. ?But we also have a good canteen, which helps us unwind.? The dhabas in front of the institute attract many students. They not only get cheap and tasty food but also get to interact with students of other management schools. 

In keeping with its present rate of growth and future requirements, FSM has recently acquired eight acres of land for a new campus in Gurgaon.

Old memories

Sanjiv Bajaj, director, Bajaj Capital 

Limited, remembers his alma mater

BACK IN THE Nineties, I was a management student at 

FORE. My memories of the place are pleasant. I vividly remember the beautiful 

campus. The location was perfect and it provided a great environment for academics. 

The teachers were very helpful and they always inspired us. The focus was on case 

studies. Classes were based on practicals and fieldwork. It was hectic, but enjoyable. 

FORE believes in producing well-rounded managers. 

So, the faculty and students were encouraged to take part in all kinds of events 

 academic and otherwise. The institute helped us develop broad-based skills 

while focusing on individual specialisations. 

FOREs only drawback in those days was its lack of in-house facilities. Even 

the curriculum was not very broad-based. However, the placement cell was good. 

There was a strong sense of bonding among students. Sometimes we would organise 

parties so that we could all interact with each other. Actually, FORE gave me 

the perfect platform to achieve my goals and ambitions.

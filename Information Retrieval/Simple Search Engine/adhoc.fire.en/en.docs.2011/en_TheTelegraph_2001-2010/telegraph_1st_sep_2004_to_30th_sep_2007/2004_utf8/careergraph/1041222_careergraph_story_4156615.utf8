TUNE IN TO THE LATEST FROM THE WORLD OF EDUCATION

Lessons on learning

Schools are opting for a special set of tests for a reality check on how much students are actually learning in class. Prithvijit Mitra reports

Do our students really learn what they are taught in class? A surprisingly large number of teachers across the country admit that they don?t. Exams, they say, only reflect what youngsters can memorise, not what they have learnt. 

So how can we improve the quality of school education? A group of IIM Ahmedabad alumni chucked juicy corporate careers to try and answer that question. Sridhar Rajagopalan, Sudhir Ghodke and Venkat Krishnan have launched Education Initiative, a company dedicated to upgrading the quality of education in our country.

They have chosen the domain of diagnostic assessments to do a ?where are we now? analysis. This analysis can apply to a child, a class, a school, a group of schools, or even a district. They have devised a system and a test called Assetplus that tells teachers and parents how much students have really learnt as opposed to what they have learnt by heart.

Assetplus is a self-learning programme that is a collection of activities, worksheets, projects, experiments and games scientifically designed to strengthen skills that children are generally weak in. Its fun-based activities reinforce logical interpretation, grammar, word application, comprehension, mathematics, conceptual learning and original thinking. 

Meant for students of classes III to IX, Assetplus covers maths, English and science. It is based on the curriculum of various state boards, CBSE and ICSE. ?Unlike the conventional system of examination which tests the ability of a student to memorise without application of thought, Assetplus diagnoses the understanding of a student,? says Ghodke. 

He narrates the example of a Class V student who told him what she had learnt in her geography class. She said: ?The difference between the earth?s equatorial circumference and polar circumference is 72 km.? Impressed with her knowledge, he asked her what she understood by equatorial circumference. She said she did not know. And polar circumference? Again, she was not sure. Circumference? She had no idea. In desperation, he asked her ?Then what do you know?? She answered, ?I know that the difference between the Earth?s equatorial circumference and polar circumference is 72 km.? 

Assetplus kits are scientifically-developed by subject experts based on a study of student performance. In the conventional system, English is often taught as a set of grammar rules. But this system employs a combination of listening, speaking, reading and writing activities. Similarly, science hardly includes examples from daily life or application of theories. Most children observe their teacher performing experiments in class, but do not get a hands-on experience. 

The questions ?stress on application of skills that helps to assess the extent to which the student has grasped the topic. Also, there is a detailed analysis for each child that helps the teachers,? says Meenakshi Atal, principal of Heritage School that ran the programme. 

After children go through the test, a skill profile chart is prepared based on the child?s performance. Each student is given a certificate, score card, strength-weakness analysis report and an all-India ranking.

Over 400 schools in the country are taking the test every year in India, Middle East and Singapore, says Ghodke. 

But this isn?t going to have an immediate effect, believe some. ?Assetplus is a very well-structured programme that will certainly help the bright and above-average students. But I doubt if it will help teachers unless the course is reduced,? says S. Mukherjee, principal of Abhinav Bharti School, Calcutta, which has also run the programme.

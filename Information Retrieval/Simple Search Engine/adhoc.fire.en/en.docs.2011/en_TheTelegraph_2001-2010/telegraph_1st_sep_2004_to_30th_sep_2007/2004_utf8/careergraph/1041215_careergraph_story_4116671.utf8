Biprodas Bhattacharya

Senior Teacher, Ramakrishna Mission School, Narendrapur

Q: I am a student of Class XII science 

with physics, chemistry and maths. In my Class X board exams, I had scored only 

45 per cent. But now I wish to improve my marks and score between 70-75 per cent. 

My final exams will be held in March 2005. How can I improve my marks and how 

many hours of study should I put in each day? Please advise.

Gaurav Sharma

A: The number of hours is really not important. 

What is essential is to make sure that you understand the lesson, and that you 

are able to solve the questions pertaining to each lesson. A standard tip for 

preparation is to solve the question papers of the last 10 years in each subject, 

and get your answers checked by your teachers. 

Students of science subjects often tend to neglect 

the languages, but this reflects in their total marks. You must not make this 

mistake. Do not lag behind your classes in school. Try to take as many mock exams 

as possible. 

Sticking to a steady routine of studying, rather than 

erratic hours, will help you to finish your workload, and also give you confidence. 

I wish you all the best in your endeavours.

Indian Statistical Institute, Calcutta

Q: I am a BSc (physics honours) first-year 

student. I have passed my higher secondary examination with 70 per cent. As I 

did not get through the All-India Engineering Entrance Examination (AIEEE), Joint 

Admission Test (JAT) and the Joint Entrance Examination of IIT (IIT-JEE), I was 

extremely depressed. 

Consequently, I was thinking of dropping a year 

and appearing for the AIEEE 2005. However, due to some family problems I will 

not be able to carry out my plans. But I do not wish to pursue BSc. I am in a 

dilemma ? should I pursue BSc honours and prepare for AIEEE along with it? Please 

advise.

Raju Paul 

A: I think your idea of pursuing BSc honours 

and preparing for the All-India Engineering Entrance Examination (AIEEE) alongside 

is a very prudent one. Remember, in this competitive world it is always a good 

idea to keep your options open to the maximum extent possible. By doing the BSc 

honours along with the AIEEE, you shall have two options for the future which 

may well be of help. All the best.

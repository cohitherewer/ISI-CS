NEWS, VIEWS AND TRIVIA STRAIGHT FROM SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES

Turning over a new leaf

Of late, school students have been getting increasingly 

involved in conserving the environment and spreading awareness about state of 

Mother Earth. 

New Leaf, an inter-school newsletter, launched 

in October, was conceptualised for publication by the nature clubs of schools 

like Don Bosco Park Circus, Birla High School (girls? section), G.D. Birla Centre 

for Education, La Martiniere for Boys, Mahadevi Birla High School, St Thomas? 

Girls? School and Lakshmipat Singhania Academy. 

New Leaf intends to provide a platform for 

students to express their views about the city and its environment. It will be 

an umbrella under which students of Calcutta?s schools can unite to undertake 

various projects to protect the environment.

Vidyasagar fest

 Anjan Dutta 

Vidyasagar College held its annual fest at Mahajati 

Sadan on October 15. There was a lot of excitement, particularly among the first-year 

students. The college union created some suspense and kept us guessing on who 

the guest artists were.

When they finally came on stage, Anjan Dutta and Shilajeet 

created quite a stir. Anjan Dutta?s deep and mellifluous voice was well-appreciated. 

He finished with Purano shei diner katha and asked us to join in. Shilajeet?s 

peppy numbers got the adrenaline pumping and soon, everyone was dancing madly.

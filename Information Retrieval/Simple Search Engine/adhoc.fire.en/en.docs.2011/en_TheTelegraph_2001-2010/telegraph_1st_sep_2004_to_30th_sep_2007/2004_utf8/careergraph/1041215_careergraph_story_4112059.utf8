 I Think

Is Jayendra Saraswati a saint or a sinner?

Yes 80%

HE 

IS REALLY a sinner. He has sullied the reputation of a shrine like the Kanchi 

Mutt. Jayendra Saraswati is now devoid of not only spirituality but also public 

sympathy. 

SABUJ SARKAR

Jadavpur University

HE 

IS INDEED a sinner in the guise of a saint. People like him should be hanged 

till death. He is a black spot on the name of religion, culture and above all, 

God.

PAYAL SRIVASTAV

Bhawanipore College

A 

SAINT MUST keep himself far from profit-making. But, the seer ventured into 

profit-making bodies like hospitals and schools andtried to hog the limelight. 

We don?t know if he is a sinner but he was certainly never a saint. 

TAMANNA PERWEEN

Gaya

THE 

KANCHI SEER is a hard-core sinner involved in murder. He is also a pervert 

who tried to outrage the modesty of women. God only knows what other crimes he 

has committed. He should be severely punished. 

SAPTADIPA GHOSH

Serampore College

THE 

SEER IS surely a saint who embraced asceticism at an early age and detached 

himself from every material pursuit. He will definitely emerge unsullied from 

this ?frame and blame? game.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Careergraph

 Short takes 

Getting into engineering college just got easier in 

Bengal. There will be 1,000 more seats up for grabs from the 2005-06 session. 

The new seats have been allocated to 54 government and private engineering colleges 

under the West Bengal University of Technology. Some of the colleges that will 

see an increase in seats are the Meghnad Saha Institute of Technology, Bengal 

Institute of Technology, Techno India and Heritage Institute of Technology. The 

hike in the number of seats was spurred by the lifting of the domicile quota which 

kept aside a certain number of seats for students from Bengal.

For 25 years, Pink Floyd?s Another Brick In The 

Wall has been the anthem for youngsters all over the world. But the boys and 

girls of the school choir that performed the chorus were not only forgotten, they 

also missed out on what was their due. The song involved 24 children, aged 13-14, 

from Islington Green School in London. They were not paid individually, although 

the school received ?1,000. Now the former pupils have learnt that under the 1996 

Copyright Act, they are supposed to get royalties each time the song is played 

by broadcasters on radio or TV.

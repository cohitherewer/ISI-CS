All you need to know about a course of your choice

Dr Amrita Dass 

Director, Institute for Career Studies, Lucknow

Do you love animals? Have you successfully given ?first 

aid? treatment to your pet before the vet could arrive? Would you enjoy dealing 

with the well being of animals as a career. Then read on ? 

Koko, a 33-year-old gorilla that was taught to communicate 

using American Sign Language, recently told her care-givers that she desired oral 

surgery to remove an aching tooth, which was extracted with success. This is veterinary 

science at its best.

Traditionally, a veterinarian?s job is to diagnose 

and treat diseases affecting animals. He / she administers first aid, performs 

surgery, prescribes medicines and vaccinates animals against diseases. 

What do i have to do? 

All you animal lovers can make a career in caring, 

healing, nourishing and improving the quality of life of animals. There is a growing 

awareness of quality medical care for animals. Veterinary surgeons (vets) treat 

a variety of animals. Much of the work in the urban areas, is related to domestic 

pets. 

The emphasis in general practice is on diagnosis and 

treatment of disease and injury. Vets also inoculate (treat an animal with a small 

quantity of the agent of a disease, in the form of a vaccine to promote immunity 

against the disease) animals against diseases and advise owners on matters such 

as food intake and breeding. Vets working with farms are concerned with, improvement 

in production, artificial insemination and disease control. 

Veterinary practice is not a white-collar job and 

the training is lengthy. Commitment and a sense of vocation are essential. Dealing 

with people is an important part of the work; vets should be tactful, patient 

and sympathetic, with good communication skills. They often need to help owners 

make difficult decisions, such as whether to have an elderly and much-loved pet 

put down. 

Good powers of observation are required: animals cannot 

describe their symptoms so to make a diagnosis, the vet must be aware of small 

and important changes in an animal?s appearance and behaviour. Manual dexterity 

is needed for performing surgical procedures. The work can be physically demanding, 

particularly when it involves horses or farm animals and vets often work in cold, 

wet, dirty and smelly conditions. It is important not to be squeamish about the 

messy tasks. 

What should i study? 

You can opt for BVSc and AH (bachelor of veterinary 

science and animal husbandry) after completing your Plus Two exam with physics, 

chemistry and biology. Further studies are in the form of the masters degree programme: 

MVSc (two-years) in which various specialisations are offered. 

What next? 

With emphasis on a scientific approach to dairy and 

poultry, both in government and private sectors, veterinarians in general practice 

have very good prospects. There are job openings in zoos, national parks, wildlife 

sanctuaries etc. Commercial organisations like Amul and Parag, specialising in 

dairy production, also have openings in research and development of improved products. 

Some NGOs in the field of animal protection like Worldwide Fund for Nature and 

Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals etc have positions for vets. 

If you are a person with entrepreneurial drive, you may consider setting up a 

creche for animals! 

Where should i study?

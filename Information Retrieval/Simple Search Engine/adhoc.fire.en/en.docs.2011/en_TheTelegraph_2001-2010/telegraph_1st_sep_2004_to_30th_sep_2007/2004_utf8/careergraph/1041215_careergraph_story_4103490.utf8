 WHERE IS IT? Bidhan Chandra Krishi Viswavidyalaya, Mohanpur, Nadia,

The sprawling campus of Bidhan Chandra Krishi Viswavidyalaya 

(BCKV) at Mohanpur, 13 km from the town of Kalyani, is surrounded by greenery. 

At 5 in the evening on a late November day, there is a nip in the air and the 

campus is a buzz of activity. Classes have just got over for the day and students 

and faculty are streaming out of buildings, painted beige and maroon. In the centre, 

there is a fenced garden of medicinal plants. Other than that there is little 

to indicate that this is one of the country?s most renowned (and West Bengal?s 

only) agricultural institutes. 

Each year, it receives over 6,000 applications from 

all over the country for its 160 seats. According to vice-chancellor Dr D. Dasgupta, 

?It is a pioneer in agricultural studies in the state.? 

BCKV?s history goes back to the pre-Independence days, 

when it was a small agricultural college in Dhaka, offering bachelors degrees 

in agricultural science. After 1947, an eminent professor of Calcutta University, 

who belonged to a family of zamindars, donated some land in Jhargram for 

the continuation of agricultural studies. Later, classes were held in a bungalow 

at Ranikuthi in Tollygunge. At the time, the college came under the affiliation 

of Calcutta University and offered bachelors degrees in science. 

In the late 50s, the college shifted to Mohanpur, 

after the Birlas donated a vast area of farm and forestland there. The college 

came to be known as Birla College of Agriculture. Finally, in 1960, when Kalyani 

University came into being, the college was affiliated to it, becoming the university?s 

faculty of agriculture.

However, it was not until 1974, after the central 

government made it mandatory for each state to designate at least one university 

for agricultural studies, that the college, together with a college of veterinary 

studies at Belgachhia, became a full-fledged university. 

Today, BCKV offers degree courses in three disciplines 

? agriculture, horticulture and agriculture engineering. Agriculture and horticulture 

are BSc honours courses while agriculture engineering is a BTech course. All these 

are four-year courses. There are also MSc courses in agriculture and horticulture 

and a PhD programme. 

Says Prof. A.K. Das, Dean, faculty of agriculture, 

?There is a growing demand for people with agriculture degrees. They are sought 

by agro-based industries, state and central government research agencies and rural 

development banks.? 

Soumyadipta Guha Neogi and Niladri Chatterjee, both 

BSc agriculture students, have opted to study here for these reasons. Says Guha 

Neogi, who is from Siliguri, ?I had the opportunity to study in a medical college, 

but I chose BCKV. The versatility of subjects offered here was what attracted 

me most.? Chatterjee was impressed with the facilities, which include, among other 

things, well-equipped labs, a well-stocked library and a computer lab. 

BCKV students are not restricted to the classroom 

alone. They go to the rural areas of Kalyani, Jhargram, Birbhum and Purulia to 

gain hands-on experience in the fields. While agriculture students learn land 

preparation, ploughing, seed-sewing, harvesting and other farming techniques, 

horticulture students are taught floriculture, methods of pollination etc. Engineering 

students learn the science of pumping, irrigation, and tractor technology, among 

others. 

?BCKV students are doing well,? says Dasgupta, ?but 

there is scope for improvement. We need to change the way we design our syllabi.

Old memories 

Prof. Dipak Bagchi, agriculture science department, 

ISI, reminisces about BCKV

 WHEN I WAS a student at the agricultural institute (from 1959 to 1962) it was 

not known as BCKV. It was still the Birla College of Agriculture. During those 

days it was the norm for parents to decide what was best for you, so, frankly 

speaking, the only reason I went there was because my parents wanted it. 

 But I am glad I listened to them, because today, I realise that the teachers 

who taught me can be compared to some of the best in the world. The student-teacher 

ratio was good. there was no dearth of infrastructure, with well-equipped labs 

and plenty of books. The curriculum was very challenging.

 We were also taken on education tours to Bihar and Delhi. Our hostel was located, 

not in the main campus at Mohanpur, but in Kalyani. A bus would bring us to the 

institute . We also had only one girl in the class. Like all young men, we wanted 

to bunk classes, but there was nowhere to go as the institute was surrounded by 

endless swathes of farmland and forests. 

 Our only recreation was watching films in town Uttam Kumar starrers 

and Hindi movies were our favourites. Though today, I am not in touch with my 

alma mater, I know that there are some very bright, young people studying there. 

I am sure they will do very well in future. I owe a lot to my years in the institute.

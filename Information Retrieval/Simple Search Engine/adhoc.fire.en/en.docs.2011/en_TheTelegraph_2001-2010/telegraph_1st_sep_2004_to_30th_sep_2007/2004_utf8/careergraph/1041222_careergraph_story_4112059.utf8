The Telegraph - Calcutta : Careergraph

 I Think

Could Juniors life have been saved?

Yes 100%

YES, 

IF THE match had been held in a country like the US. Indian grounds dont 

have even basic medical facilities. Had these been there, he may have survived.

 SAMRAT SHAW

Calcutta

HE 

DIED BECAUSE of negligence. The main reason for his death was the absence 

of medical staff at the ground. He would have been alive had he been given the 

life-saving injection instantly.

 AVIK DAS

Scottish Church College

YES, 

IF PEOPLE around him had been more concerned. He should have been taken to 

a nearby hospital instead of one so far away.

 ANKITA SRIVASTAV

Welland Gouldsmith School

YES, 

HAD THERE been good medical facilities on the ground. Moreover, there should 

be periodical fitness checks of the players.

 KRISHANU JOARDER

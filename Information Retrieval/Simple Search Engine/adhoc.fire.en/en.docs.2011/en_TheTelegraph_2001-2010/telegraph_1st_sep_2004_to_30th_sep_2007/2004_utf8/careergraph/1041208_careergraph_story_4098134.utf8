 Of patents and trade marks

TUNE IN TO THE LATEST FROM THE WORLD OF EDUCATION

A new course teaches you the intricacies of intellectual 

property management, reports Prithvijit Mitra

is exclusive to tea produced in Darjeeling 

What happens if a company?s trade secret is let out? 

Or, if a rival resorts to an unfair trade practice, thereby eating into its profits? 

You can take recourse to legal action ? a long-drawn, cumbersome process that 

involves both loss of money and time. Or, if you know the ins and outs of intellectual 

property management, you can make sure that such a situation never comes to pass.

The Indian Institute of Social Welfare and Business 

Management (IISWBM), Calcutta, is the first in India to launch an Intellectual 

Property Management (IPM) course. Titled postgraduate diploma in Intellectual 

Property Management, Administration and Law, the programme will be offered in 

collaboration with the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry 

(FICCI), New Delhi, and Institute of Intellectual Property Development (IIPD), 

New Delhi, with assistance from the ministry of human resource development, Government 

of India. 

IP has so far been a much-neglected area, especially 

in corporate management. This has led to India losing out on the patents for Basmati 

rice and turmeric. 

?The course will produce IP managers who will be well-versed 

in the rules of knowledge protection so that they can help the company steer clear 

of legal disputes,? says Sohini Banerjee, in-charge of the programme at IISWBM.

The programme will cover a wide area, including patents, 

copyrights, trade marks, geographical indications, traditional knowledge (TK), 

designs protection, trade secrets, unfair competition and IP violations on the 

Internet. 

 ?Geographical indications is an area of contention. 

It identifies a good as originating in the territory or a region or locality in 

that territory. 

For example, Darjeeling tea packs have the common 

trade mark depicting a woman in a tea garden smelling a tea bud which acts as 

its Geographical Indication,? explains Banerjee. 

Having IP managers is an excellent idea, believe experts. 

?With more multinationals coming in, they will be looking for arbitration rather 

than litigation and protection of patent rights. IP managers can work in tandem 

with company lawyers and help organisations safeguard their copyrights, patents 

and trade secrets? says senior advocate Geetanath Ganguly. 

IISWBM will follow the Cambridge model of instruction. 

Classes will be interactive with everyone chipping in with their ideas and opinions. 

India being a member of the WTO, must implement the 

Trade-related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement. This requires that 

Indian intellectual property laws have to be immediately amended and corporate 

management strategies innovated to bring them in conformity with provisions of 

the TRIPS agreement. This has led to an unprecedented demand for IP professionals 

in the IT sector, BPO/outsourcing enterprises, corporate sector, government and 

academia, pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors. 

But unless you have a grounding in law, it could be 

tough doing the course, say experts. ?This is where it is different from any other 

management course. It could be difficult for an economics student to walk into 

the course,? says Prof Biju Abraham of IIM.

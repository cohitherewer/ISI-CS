South Point School hosted its annual inter-school 

fest Ullas on December 10 and 11. There were a number of exciting competitions 

and events. About 700 children between ages 6 and 12 from 18 leading schools in 

Calcutta participated. 

Off-stage events like Tuli, Tulika, Patra Ranjan and 

Chitrangan allowed the participants to showcase their talents in drawing, painting, 

card-making and creative decorations. Spin-a-tale and Spell Bee were creative 

writing and vocabulary competitions, respectively. All these were held on Day 

I itself, on the school premises.

For the on-stage events, the scene shifted to Madhusudhan 

Mancha the next day. Noted singer Indranil Sen was the chief guest. Events like 

Rhyme and Rhythm (a recitation competition), Bohurupee (fancy dress), Do-re-mi 

(group Western music), Saare jahan se achchha (group patriotic songs) and Ghungroo 

(creative dance) were the highlights of the day. 

The top honours went to Modern High School and South 

Point jointly but, being gracious hots, we gave the trophy over to MHS. Future 

Foundation finished runners-up.

CALCUTTA

Word power

The 5th Inter-institutional National Debate, held 

in memory of L.N. Birla, was held at Vidyamandir recently. After the semi-final 

round was kicked off here in July, the debate travelled to Bangalore, Hyderabad, 

Chennai, Mumbai, Pune, Dehi, Jaipur before returning to Calcutta. 

The topic for the final was Television Destroys 

the Mind. The British Deputy High Commissioner in Calcutta, Andrew Hall, 

was the chief guest. Opponents of the motion like V. Sathyanarayan of Chennai, 

who came first, sought to demolish claims that violence on TV promotes violence 

on the streets. Ranked second was Vrinda Marwah of Delhi Public School. 

In the college section, Rakesh Ankit from St Stephens, 

Delhi, was ranked first while Calcuttas Rahul Chawra from Bhawanipur Education 

Society finished runner-up. 

The grand debate had a grand ending. A lavish dinner 

awaited everyone.

SILIGURI

Dooars do

Siliguri Institute of Technology organised its annual 

cultural function Sitex 2004-Resurgent, recently. Schools and colleges from Darjeeling, 

Kalimpong, Sikkim, Jalpaiguri and Siliguri were invited. There were 15 competitions 

in all, including quiz, singing, dancing, acting, T-shirt designing and so on.

The theme of the T-shirt designing competition was 

the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway which passes by the institute every day. Performances 

by the Bangla bands Chandrabindoo and Fossils drove the audience crazy. There 

was also a performance by our own students.

On the last day, renowned playback singer Babul Supriyo 

played cricket with us. He was quite good at it, piling on the runs and smashing 

a number of sixes. Later in the evening, he had everyone dancing to his tune, 

including the faculty.

Stories 

away from home

Hostale

When we were studying at St Edmunds, some of 

us had girlfriends staying at a private hostel nearby. Naturally, the hostel wouldnt 

allow a man to even cross its threshold unless he was the father or brother of 

a boarder. 

One day, the girlfriend of one of our friends suddenly 

fell sick and couldnt meet him for almost a week. Her family lived in a 

remote part of Arunachal Pradesh and could not come to see her either. Naturally, 

our friend was very worried. We tried to console him by saying that her fellow 

boarders and the warden would look after her. 

Finally, to set his mind at rest, we decided to send 

in someone posing as his girlfriends brother. Our friend wrote a letter 

for his ladylove, the brother was briefed about the girls family, 

and sent off with a prayer. There would be hell to pay if anything went wrong.

However, everything went like clockwork. The brother 

delivered the letter and came back with a favourable report.

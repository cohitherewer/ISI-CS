The Telegraph - Calcutta : KnowHOW

by indian school kids ? that?s set to zoom into space next month. Varuna Verma

The playground at Bangalore?s Bishop Cotton Boys? 

School is thick with boys at lunchtime. This clearly is where they like to hang 

out. The din breaks all optimum noise levels. Tennis balls fly around the field, 

and the boys run helter-skelter. 

Not everybody, though. Two Standard XII boys prefer the physics laboratory to the playing field. Chandan Prasad and Dhanvi Reddy have a deadline to meet. They are busy giving final touches to a 10-feet-long rocket they have been building for the last two years. On December 15, the two boys met with scientists at the Thumba test centre of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). ISRO scientists are expected to examine the rocket in detail. ?They have given us a list of tests to conduct,? says Dhanvi. 

The rocket, christened Ebender, has got the ISRO interested because this is the first such effort by Indian school students and the organisation feels this would go a long way in promoting a scientific temperament among students. 

Of course, it was the Bishop Cotton School staff who first gave moral and financial backing to the project. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has cleared it and the Bangalore Air Traffic Control (ATC) has given it the go-ahead as well. The ATC had earlier scheduled the launch for December 12, but is now fixing a new date. 

Chandan and Dhanvi hit upon the idea of building a rocket in 2002 when ISRO launched a satellite. The boys ? who have been buddies since childhood ? couldn?t stop discussing the event. ?We were completely captivated,? says Chandan. 

One thing led to another and very soon the two boys ? then in Standard X ? decided to build a satellite of their own. They read up every word on satellites in the school library and scanned the Internet for information. Soon they realised that they were biting off more than they could chew. ?We realised we had to move in steps,? says Chandan. 

Step one was to build a rocket. Information collection took up a whole year. ?We had to get precise information on everything ? from what fuel to use, the strength of the motor casing, to wiring, circuits, and even the best shape for the nose cone,? says Dhanvi. 

Arranging for the nuts and bolts and machines was 

the next phase of the project. Since Chandan was a hostel resident and had to 

follow strict curfew timings, it was left to Dhanvi to visit metalwork shops, 

discuss pipes with plumbers and raid junkyards for cheap metal and wood pieces.

Up, up and away

The boys were working on a shoestring budget. We 

had only our pocket money to invest. So we were always on the lookout for the 

cheapest option, says Dhanvi.

More than money, communicating with each other proved to be a problem. Chandan 

had to live by the school hostel rules play in the evening, dinner at seven, 

homework and early bedtime. If I got an idea at night, Id have to 

wait till morning before I could discuss it with my partner, remembers Dhanvi.

Mission Ebender which has cost Rs 16,000 so far, remained 

hush-hush for two years. The boys would steal time out during school hours to 

work on their project. Then Dhanvi would assemble the rocket and conduct tests 

in the dead of night on the terrace of his house in Bangalores Wilson Garden. 

We never thought Ebender was big enough to let anyone know, says Dhanvi.

But by August this year, they realised that they were 

actually on to something big. Our project was moving on the right track 

and we needed more than our pocket money and junkyard raids to sustain it, 

says Chandan.

Next on the agenda

Thats when Bishop Cotton School stepped in. 

After the initial astonishment bouts, the school agreed to lend the money, material 

and infrastructure support needed for the rocket. The first table at the physics 

laboratory was reserved exclusively for Ebender. A signboard standing in the middle 

of the table reads, Out of bounds for students. So that nobody 

fiddles around with our equipment, explains Chandan.

The school contacted the DGCA and Bangalore ATC to 

get the project cleared. An ISRO scientist was invited to give a lecture on aerodynamics. 

Ebender had made Bishop Cotton space-science savvy. 

The rocket, which weighs 7 kilograms, is expected 

to reach an altitude of 3.8 km and travel at a speed of one mach. It is equipped 

with a parachute, an altimeter system and a radio to track its landing. Dextrose 

potassium nitrate is the propellant fuel. This is a small step towards building 

a fullfledged satellite, say the boys.Next on the agenda is a multistage 

rocket with two engines, says Chandan. That will take them one step closer 

to making their dream satellite.

Chandan and Dhanvis hopes are soaring as high 

as the Ebender is expected to. Chandan sees himself as a future aerospace scientist. 

He plans to study space science at a top-notch US universtity. But Dhanvi has 

other plans hes more keen on a career in computers. Rocketry 

is my hobby, he says.

Right now, though, the boys are waiting for their 

dream and the rocket to take off. The countdown has begun.

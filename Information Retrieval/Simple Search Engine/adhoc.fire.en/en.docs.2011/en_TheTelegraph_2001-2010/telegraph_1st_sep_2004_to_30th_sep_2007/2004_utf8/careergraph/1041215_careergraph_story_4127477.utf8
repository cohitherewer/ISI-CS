TUNE IN TO THE LATEST FROM THE WORLD OF EDUCATION

Making sense of nonsense 

Calcutta girl Nandana Bose has penned a book of limericks 

that?s sure to raise a few laughs. Jayeeta Ganguly reports

Funny girl: Nandana Bose

A girl once applied some lotion/And drank a secret 

potion./From gladness to sadness/She finally reached madness/Traversing the gamut 

of emotion!

It was in the year 1997-98 when she was an English 

(honours) student at Presidency College that Nandana Bose penned 60 limericks 

and ?forgot about them?. Luckily for her (and us too), she decided to revise them 

after returning from the University of Leeds in the UK (she was awarded the British 

Chevening Scholarship to study communications studies at the university in 2001) 

and considered publishing them.

It was easier said than done. Though she was determined 

and knew that she would succeed, Indian publishers were not so optimistic. Says, 

Nandana, who is currently pursuing a PhD in film studies at the University of 

Notthingham, UK, ?I had approached some Indian publishing firms but they weren?t 

interested in publishing poetry. I was told that it was not financially viable 

for them. How can anyone prove their worth until and unless they are given a chance? 

Finally, I approached Athena Press, London, from Calcutta. They were willing to 

publish poetry by a newcomer.?

And that was how Life, Love and Laughter with Limericks 

came into being earlier this year. ?It was like a dream come true,? says Nandana. 

?When Athena Press agreed, I felt so blessed. Just seeing my dream taking shape 

? right from the manuscript stage, to reading the proofs and then finally taking 

a look at the book cover ? the entire journey was extremely fulfiling for me.? 

But why limericks? Nandana laughs and makes an honest 

confession. ?Writing these limericks was almost an accident although I?d always 

been interested in creative writing and had read Edward Lear when I was young. 

But I never thought that I would write a book of limericks.?

A self-proclaimed ?voracious reader?, Nandana had 

always had a predilection for humour and comedy. As a literature student, she 

had developed a keen sense of observation ? studying human nature, noticing people?s 

moods, emotions, expressions and foibles. And it was this sense that brought out 

the dormant Edward Lear, or shall we say, the Sukumar Ray in her. An example: 

There once was a harridan/ Curved like a meridian/ She misused and confused 

/And verbally abused /Like a character straight out of Sheridan!

Ask her about the response she has received on her 

maiden venture and Nandana replies, ?I published this book for my own satisfaction, 

to be read by my family and friends and so I haven?t really marketed it at all. 

But I do think that more budding writers should be encouraged in India.? 

However, for Nandana, who is also a topper in MA in 

film studies from Jadavpur University, the ?limerick phase?, as she calls it, 

is over. ?I was delighted to have the opportunity to study cinema as an academic 

discipline since cinema has always been my passion. I have also worked with SRFTI 

briefly as a film researcher and freelanced with well-known dailies. 

?My future plans include completing my PhD in film 

studies and doing research on cinema. I would also like to write a novel or a 

collection of short stories some day,? says Nandana, whose motto in life is to 

do the best in the given circumstances.

Given her track record, she hasn?t done too badly 

either.

The origin of nonsense verse

Most of us remember the nursery rhyme Hickory Dickory Dock. But did you know that 

this was also one of the first bits of nonsense verse to be published, 

and that too as early as 1744? The first book of nonsense verse was called The 

History of Sixteen Wonderful Women (1829). Then in the 1860s, the magazine Punch 

began a competition where readers were invited to send in nonsensical poems about 

a named geographical location. The idea caught on and the contest continued for 

several years. Though nonsense verse was becoming increasingly popular, it would 

be another 40 years, 1896, in fact, before the word limerick was used 

to describe this kind of poem.

The limerick man 

 If there 

is a father of the modern limerick, it is Edward Lear, the British poet (1812-1888), 

whose humorous and nonsensical poems went a long way in popularising the genre. 

Lears poems poked fun at everything, including himself. Like Lewis Carroll 

after him (and like our very own Sukumar Ray), Lear wrote fantastical poems on 

imaginary creatures. Remembered for his humorous poems like The Owl and the Pussycat, 

Lears passion for the ridiculous is often thought to be his way of cocking 

a snook at the all-pervasive orderliness of Victorian society.

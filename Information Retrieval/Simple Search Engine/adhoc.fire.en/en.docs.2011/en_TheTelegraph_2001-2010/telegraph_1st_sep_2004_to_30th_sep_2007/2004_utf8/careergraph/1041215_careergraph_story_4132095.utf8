Of craftsmanship and design

Q: I?m interested in doing a course in craft 

design. Please suggest some institutes offering courses in this field.

A: The Indian Institute of Crafts and Design, 

Jaipur, is the only institute of its kind that offers education, training and 

research in craft design, craft management and craft technology. 

The main objective is to evolve a sustained programme 

to help crafts and craftsmen develop in an integrated manner and produce a cadre 

of professional design-techno-managers for advancing the state-of-the-art in the 

craft sector. An autonomous body established by the Government of Rajasthan, the 

institute works in close collaboration with NID and NIFT. 

A three-year PG diploma in craft design has been launched. 

Graduates in any discipline can take a shot at the entrance test in March (at 

Jaipur, Delhi and Calcutta) which is followed by an aptitude test and interview.

of Crafts amp; Design, B16/A, Bhawani Singh Road, C-Scheme, Jaipur 302001 (Rajasthan).

Short courses in craft design are also offered at 

Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs). Kurukshetra University, Directorate of 

Distance Education offers a Diploma in Art amp; Craft (two-year) through MPCT 

Institute of Engineering amp; Technology, Panjokhra Sahib, Ambala and other institutes.

Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU) and 

Khadi Village Industries Commission have jointly launched study programmes in 

various aspects of crafts, design, and art. One of these is a six-month certificate 

programme in crafts amp; design (pottery). 

Application forms are free and can be obtained from 

IGNOU, Maidan Garhi or their website: www.ignou.ac.in. The application 

deadline is December 24, 2004.

Eligibility for CAT, MCA

Q: I did my ?O? amp; ?A? level from 

DOEACC and BCA from IGNOU. Am I eligible for appearing in the JEE-MCA and CAT 

for MBA? 

A.Majumdar

A: You are eligible for JEE-MCA and CAT as 

the eligibility is a bachelor?s degree for both. For MCA, the additional condition 

is that you should have studied maths as one of your subjects in Class XII. 

You can also take direct entry into the third semester 

of MSc (IT) through distance education mode in some universities: Punjab Technical 

University, Jalandhar, Sikkim Manipal University, or Karnataka State Open University, 

in which case you will complete your masters in two years. Similarly, you can 

also get direct entry to the third semester of MCA at IGNOU or SMU under the lateral 

entry scheme, if you have cleared the ?A? level exam and completed your project 

work. Although a regular MCA from a reputed university is preferred, if you are 

already working, opt for IGNOU. 

What it takes to build dream spaces

Q: I am in Class XII and am preparing 

for BArch exams. But my teachers say that it is not an easy field. Please advise.

Hemal Chauhan

A: Your teachers are right in saying that it 

is not easy to become a successful architect, but then rarely does success come 

easy in any field. But if you have the talent and are willing to work hard, then 

go right ahead. 

Although the study of architecture is long and demanding, 

the sheer diversity of the course is fascinating. Every project you execute is 

a learning experience. In the initial stages of your career, you will work as 

an assistant to an established architect. 

Assignments will include researching zoning regulations, 

working with subcontractors and drafting plans (now essentially on the computer). 

Once you?ve gained some experience as a junior architect, you can start designing 

parts of a building or its interior.

At this stage you will interact with the contractor 

to ensure that the construction and fabrication conforms to the plans. It is not 

until a decade or so that most architects get actual opportunities to design and 

plan full-scale buildings as the lead architect.

The professional terrain is harsh and demands good 

academic skill, analytical thinking and an observant eye. Apart from creative 

skills what you need is a stonemason?s instinct for raw material, a technical 

engineer?s knowledge of structural design and above all, a fine sense of aesthetics. 

You have to master everything ? from science to maths to almost all fields of 

humanities. 

You will also require practical, interpersonal, and 

organisational skills accompanied by immense patience and commitment. As a successful 

architect, you must be able to visualise, express, and finally translate your 

dream building into a reality.

Government organisations that provide employment are 

?public works department, ministry of defence, departments of railways, Housing 

and Urban Development Corporation etc. In the private sector, you can work with 

architectural firms, urban planning agencies, builders, consultants or function 

as an independent architect. If you are academically oriented, you can also opt 

for teaching. 

Town planners and landscape developers are in great 

demand now. In fact, considering that construction is one of the largest sectors 

of investment which is currently in a boom phase, there is no dearth of demand 

for people with the relevant skills.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : KnowHOW

FACES '04

Maria Sharapova 

Maria Sharapova showed she was not just a glamour 

girl who also played tennis. The 17-year-old Siberian beauty came out with a smashing 

Wimbledon Ladies Singles victory over the redoubtable Serena Williams. She beat 

her again at the WTA Championships in Los Angeles, thereby signalling the end 

of the Serena serenade on grass and clay courts around the world. The Florida 

resident, who loves jazz and Sherlock Holmes, finished 2004 with a singles world 

ranking of No 4. Way to go, Maria! 

Ankur Aggarwal 

You wouldn?t think your insurance agent was a millionaire 

many times over. Well, take a look at Ankur Aggarwal, the 20-year-old insurance 

salesman extraordinaire, who has netted a cool Rs 68 lakh at last count. A student 

of second year BBA at a Delhi college, Aggarwal had started working for Kotak 

Mahindra Old Life Insurance Company to finance his studies. But there was no stopping 

him once he discovered his knack for selling policies. ?I never give up on a potential 

client,? he says. He?s still keen on completing his studies, though. Hey, is this 

guy nuts?

Chetan Bhagat

IIT-ians have got it made, right? Wrong, said Chetan 

Bhagat in his hilarious book on life at India?s tech meccas, Five Point Someone: 

What not to do at IIT. A graduate of IIT Delhi with an MBA from IIM Ahmedabad, 

Bhagat, 29, who works for an investment bank in Hong Kong, fits the bill of the 

archetypal Indian super-achiever. Yet his book takes digs at the performance-oriented, 

high-pressure lives IIT-ans are forced to lead. But Bhagat, who won heaps of accolades 

for his acute and uproariously funny book, does admit that his time at IIT was 

one of the happiest in his life. His motto: ?Don?t stop making friends?. Well, 

okay, Chetan, but we?d rather you didn?t stop writing.

Sunidhi Chauhan

The brassy, sassy, smoky-voiced Sunidhi Chauhan emerged 

as the queen of Hindi pop in 2004, topping off the year with the chart-busting 

Dhoom macha le. She?s got youngsters around the country swinging to her 

beat now, the Shefali Jariwalas of this world quite forgotten in the collective, 

orgiastic dhoom. A child artiste who tasted fame with the TV talent hunt 

show Meri Awaz Suno, Chauhan, 20, is not one to rest on her laurels. A 

staunch fan of Michael Jackson and Mariah Carey, this gal wants her fame to spread 

worldwide. 

Amen to that!

Ronaldinho

He?s the Fifa World Player of the Year 2004. And why 

not? Ronaldinho scored as many as 19 goals for his club Barcelona and set up many 

more in his capacity as the team?s star playmaker. Like most Brazilian footballers, 

Ronaldinho, 24, has come up the hard way, kicking the ball around on the streets 

and beaches of Porto Alegre. His real success this year has been in catapulting 

a dispirited, faction-ridden Barcelona to the top of the Spanish Primera Liga. 

The ever-smiling, long-haired soccer star is admired as much for his performance 

on the field as his enthusiasm off it. 

Ashwin Chitale

Nine-year-old Ashwin Chitale stole the heart of viewers 

and reviewers alike with his award-winning role of a village boy who has a rare 

form of cancer of the eyes in Shwaas, the Marathi film that is India?s 

entry for the Oscars this year. Chitale, who got the national award for the best 

child artiste (Shwaas bagged the 

Golden Lotus for best film), was only four when he 

was signed and that too after being put through five rigorous screen tests. 

Now a student of Class IV at Pune?s Nutan Marathi 

Vidyalaya, the pint-sized star doesn?t feel friends treat him any differently 

now that he has become famous. He has already acted in another Marathi film and 

has five short films to his credit. Clearly, acting is what he loves best. Ask 

him about his future plans and Chitale pipes up, ?Main Amitabh Bachchan 

anoonga!? Here?s hoping you do, kid!

Irfan Pathan

A Man of the Series award for his 18 wickets and a 

maiden 10-wicket haul in Tests in the recently-concluded series versus Bangladesh 

? 2004 saw Baroda?s lanky Irfan Pathan come into his own. The medium-pacer who 

cut his Test teeth against the formidable Australians in December 2003, has scalped 

39 victims in the one year that he has been in operation. His ODI tally is now 

an impressive 47 before the Bangla series. Also, unlike most quicks, the 20-year-old 

is no mug with the bat and sells his wicket dearly lower down the order. Overall, 

a very handy package. The coming year may see him become the pace spearhead 

of Team India.

Gayathri Kumar

Word perfect ? that?s what 13-year-old Gayathri Kumar 

proved to be when she came out tops at a UK-wide spelling contest held by the 

BBC. Quite a feat considering that she spoke only Malayalam when she came to England 

in 1996. But since then, Gayathri has not only mastered an impressive English 

vocabulary (troglodyte, mezzanine, apocalypse and claustrophobia were some of 

the words she spelt correctly), she is fluent in French and Spanish as well. Passionate 

about reading and writing, she wants to be a novelist when she grows up. Attagirl!

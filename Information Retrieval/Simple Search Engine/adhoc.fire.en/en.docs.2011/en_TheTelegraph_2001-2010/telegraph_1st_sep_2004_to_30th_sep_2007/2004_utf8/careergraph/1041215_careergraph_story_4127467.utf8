Boom Boom BPO

With the BPO industry expanding fast, there are now 

institutes that train you in the newer and more complex areas of customer support.

If it was the computer courses in the Eighties and IT finishing schools a decade later, it?s now the turn of BPO training centres to draw students in droves. Several have mushroomed in the city and elsewhere and the older ones have registered a sharp rise in enrolment ? a testimony to the continuing boom in the BPO sector. Interestingly, more than just call centre training, these institutes focus on domain knowledge, which is believed to be the future of BPO. 

In fact, BPO, or business process outsourcing, is no longer restricted to call centres either. The whole industry is expanding and diversifying so fast that the share of call centres is expected to drop to 30 per cent from the current 70 per cent by the end of 2006. Today, activities like technical support, claims processing, human resources, accounting, auditing, benefits and document management and tax preparation are being increasingly outsourced. As Ashok Raman R, manager, strategic sourcing, Spectramind, remarks, ?It is no longer just about making and receiving calls. It is about value-addition.? 

BPO employment in India is expected to grow from 200,000 

at the start of 2003 to 1,000,000 by end 2006. The reasons for its rising graph 

in this country are, of course, the same as before: low labour costs, adequate 

supply of English speakers, adequate and cost-effective communications and other 

infrastructure. ?The fact that BPO is expanding augurs well for youngsters as 

it will create more jobs, says Lopamudra Banerjee, assistant manager, coordination 

and administration, BNKe Solutions, Calcutta.

 In the new and improved BPO scene, all levels of technical support are provided 

to businesses and consumers. This includes simple customer service, product information 

requiring specialist knowledge, complex tech-support and high-end queries. 

 Hence, the key to BPO/ITeS training and resourcing will mainly be domain 

knowledge (knowledge related to specific areas) which is our main focus, 

says Jishnu Gupta, general manager, Globsyn BPO Academy. We have three specialised 

areas: technology support, healthcare, financial services. We will soon add digital 

publishing. 

 Financial services is another area which is being increasingly outsourced. 

Transaction processing and back-office services are also being looked after by 

BPOs. Daksh, for instance, provides back-end support and processes voluminous 

transactions for its clients. 

Indias share

 Outsourcing of human resource services is also emerging as a big opportunity 

for Indian BPOs with the global market in this segment estimated at $40-60 billion 

per annum. HR BPO comes to about 33 per cent of the outsourcing pie. India 

has immense potential as more than 80 per cent of Fortune 1000 companies will 

discuss offshore BPO as a way to cut costs and increase productivity, says 

V. Chandrasekaran, co-founder of Secova eServices Ltd, the first Indian HR BPO. 

 If you want to make a career in the BPO industry, the first step would be to 

join a call centre, which is still the nucleus of BPO in India. Entry-level salaries 

have been hiked to Rs 6,000-7,000 from Rs 4,000 a few years back. This is 

just marginally less than what most other jobs will offer you, says Banerjee. 

Agrees Neha Kejriwal who has been working at Spectramind for four years. This 

is the best way for ordinary graduates to get started, she says.

Bright prospects

 Today, large BPOs like Daksh and Spectramind cater to Fortune 1000 companies 

and service a wide range of inbound and outbound customer interaction and back 

office processing services to both retail and corporate customers. Things 

are looking good. And this should continue, for BPOs help companies cut costs, 

says Raman R. 

 But there are a few negatives that threaten to put a brake on BPOs galloping 

growth in India. First, theres the perennial threat of USA and UK suspending 

their offshore sourcing. Attrition rates are high and there is a shortage of expertise 

in the fast growing areas like insurance, logistics, health care, real estate 

and document management. But with training centres like Calltech, Globsyn and 

Cosmic Academy, New Delhi, coming up, the deficit could soon be wiped out, say 

experts.

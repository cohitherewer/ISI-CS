 I Think

Is Jayendra Saraswati a saint or a sinner?

Yes 100%

THE SEER is an absolute sinner hiding behind the fa?ade of a saint. There 

is every indication that he is involved in scandalous episodes of sleaze, debauchery 

and greed. He has also misappropriated temple-related funds. Worse, he has covered 

his misdemeanours in the garb of charity.

AFTER 

HIS ?confession?, I think he is more a sinner than a saint. India has seen 

many such saints who have committed crimes but escaped scot-free due to their 

money, influence and muscle power.

SAINTS are often guilty of gross crimes. With the facts and figures stacked 

against him, it now appears that Jayendra Saraswati is more a sinner than a saint.

A 

TRUE saint is above all worldly considerations. But in Jayendra Saraswati?s 

case, there is evidence that he has amassed wealth, conspired to commit murder 

and given into a life of sensual pleasure and comfort. Thus, he is an avaricious 

criminal and a sinner in the guise of a saint.

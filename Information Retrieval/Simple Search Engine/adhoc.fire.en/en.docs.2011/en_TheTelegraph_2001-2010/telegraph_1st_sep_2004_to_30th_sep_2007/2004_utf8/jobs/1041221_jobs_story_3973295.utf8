Reinventing the business suit

 Out with the T-shirts and ponytails! Formal menswear is making a comeback in corporate circles, says Luke Johnson 

Once upon a time it was easy to know what to wear to the office. The uniform for executives was a dark suit, solid tie and white shirt with black shoes. Then came the coloured shirt and funky silk tie. And finally the arrival of Dress-Down Friday, and the dotcom bubble, and all the old rules went to hell.

Playwright Arthur Miller foresaw the problems this might present a would-be high flyer: ?Where choice begins, Paradise ends, innocence ends, for what is Paradise but the absence of any need to choose this action?? So where are we now in the fashion cycle for boardroom appearances?

The menswear trade would have us believe that formal attire has staged a great comeback, with pinstripes once again in vogue. The theory is that with the death of the bull market, there has been a return to a more conservative look - no more T-shirts and ponytails.

The message is, these are serious times; frivolity is out. Of course, the clothing industry has a vested interest in convincing men to dump the casual look at work: wool suits and silk ties cost more. There has even been a re-issue of the 1955 bestseller The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit by Sloan Wilson.

It tells the tale of the suburban PR executive who gives up the corporate struggle for a more bohemian life. But I am not so sure the informal trend is dead. The departure of the chairman of Marks amp; Spencers recently, and the struggles of Austin Reed and Moss Bros indicate that middle management aren?t buying as many classic business suits as they used to.

In certain fields a traditional wardrobe remains de rigueur: accountancy or banking, for example. I?ve never met an American auditor who wears any other colour but a white shirt. Yet when accountants or bankers switch careers to the media or private equity businesses, the first thing they do is dump the Savile Row look and go for the Bill Gates ?relaxed billionaire? style.

There is not just a division between trades: age is a big factor when it comes to adopting the casual look. Few managers over the age of 50 feel comfortable in wearing anything but a suit.

Younger generations have grown up with GQ and FHM magazines, and designer labels, and they seem less willing to wear identi-kit outfits. Perhaps the presence of more women in the boardroom suite has encouraged a greater interest in haute couture among the males. This is the age of sartorial self-expression.

In continental Europe many executives wear a mix-and-match combination of blazer and trousers and I?m surprised such an offering hasn?t caught on in a big way among British retailers. It would allow customers to select off-the-peg garments in exactly the right size much more easily, and to dress with a bit more flair.

And it?s not as if the Italians, for example, are mean about their spending on business attire. However, they have been known to wear eccentric colours abroad, like green and brown suits. Such costumes would raise eyebrows in the more staid British organisations.

Perhaps the real reason for the decline in formal workwear is that tailors and designers have not evolved menswear fashions and textiles as much as they should. More demanding and style conscious customers are bored of the same old cut and fabrics. It?s time for a reinvention of the business suit!

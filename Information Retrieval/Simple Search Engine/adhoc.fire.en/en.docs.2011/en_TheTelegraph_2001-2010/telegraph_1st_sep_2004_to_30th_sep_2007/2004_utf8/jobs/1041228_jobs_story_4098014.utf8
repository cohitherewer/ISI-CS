 HOW I MADE IT 

 Manish Kumar

 Managing director, Ritspin Synthetics

 He thought for a while of becoming 

 a pilot. But Manish Kumar, managing director of Ritspin 

 Synthetics, finally settled for the more mundane kapda. 

 And he has spun for himself a very fine yarn so far. 

 ?After passing out from La Martiniere, 

 I did my graduation in BCom from St Xavier?s College,? says 

 Kumar. ?Immediately after that, I did a short diploma in 

 business management from Harvard Business School.? And business 

 won the day when it came to a career choice, though flying 

 was a passion. Radio flying was the main outlet for this 

 interest. He won the national championship when he was 10, 

 and still cherishes his models. 

 ?On my return from Harvard in 

 1991, I joined our family tea business and was put in charge 

 of export marketing,? continues Kumar. 

 ?But the business had hit a stumbling 

 block due to the insurgency problem in the Northeast. We 

 couldn?t even visit the gardens. ?At that time, the Soviet 

 Union was our biggest market. When it broke up, our business 

 went into a tailspin. I had already been looking around 

 for other opportunities and narrowed in on textiles and 

 chemicals. Eventually, I settled for textiles as there was 

 tremendous growth potential in this field.? 

 In 1994, Ritspin was set up with 

 factories in Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. ?I was keen 

 on West Bengal but there was no raw material here,? continues 

 Kumar. ?In hindsight, I could still have given it a thought 

 had the present industrial climate prevailed then. 

 ?The beginning was very tough. 

 It was a miracle how we managed to complete the project 

 six months ahead of schedule. It was a mad rush against 

 time. The land was bought in December 1994 and construction 

 started in March next year. We had to meet the deadline 

 to beat the monsoons, otherwise the project would have been 

 delayed by several months. But there was a problem. The 

 letter of intent for the long-term loans had not yet come 

 through. We decided to take a risk and go ahead without 

 the letter. 

 ?Even before that had been sorted 

 out, we encountered upon a power shortage. The state government 

 told us that the 4 MW that we required could not be provided. 

 So we had to set up a captive power plant, which needed 

 a Rs 12 crore investment. I had no idea where the money 

 was going to come from. After a frantic search we got ICICI 

 to finance the plant.

 ?Our commercial operations finally 

 started in April 1997. In two months we hit a severe crisis. 

 The south-east Asian tigers collapsed and there was a bloodbath 

 in the textile industry. All the companies suffered heavy 

 losses for there was hardly any buyer in the export market. 

 We didn?t make our planned public issue as the climate was 

 not conducive but we still needed at least Rs 14 crore to 

 survive. 

 ?Again I didn?t know where the 

 money was going to come from. Somehow we managed unsecured 

 loans from the money market and ran our plant. Export was 

 our thrust area. In the first year it accounted for just 

 Rs 6 crore out of our total turnover of Rs 66 crore. It 

 jumped to Rs 70 crore in three years. 

 ?How did we do it? With a focus 

 on marketing. I spent days on end at the customers? doorsteps, 

 quite literally. Everywhere there would be a long line of 

 sellers from India, Thailand and Indonesia. But our advantage 

 was technology. It let us reduce our workforce by about 

 25 per cent. In textiles, the less the human touch, the 

 better the quality. This gave us a headstart. 

 Ever since, we have specialised 

 in value-added niche products. For instance, our R amp;D 

 cell has come up with an innovation which we call Ritvang. 

 It is a blend of viscose and polymite. The fabric is considered 

 to be one of the finest in the world. We also have a collaboration 

 with Tencel of Australia. 

 ?I am often asked why we have 

 not looked at the domestic market. The primary reason is, 

 of course, that profit margins are lower in India. Also, 

 there are infrastructural problems. ?In the past three years, 

 we have doubled our turnover. We hope to close this year 

 at Rs 140 crore and take an even bigger leap next year. 

 Unless the export market shrinks drastically, Ritspin will 

 continue to be on a roll.?

 Kumar may not be flying his models 

 too much these days. But he is still flying high.

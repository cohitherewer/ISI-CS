 HOW I MADE IT 

 Pramod Kapoor

 Publisher, Roli Books

 In the early Seventies, students 

 didn?t clamour to get into B-schools as they do now. But 

 some like Pramod Kapoor thought it was the best choice. 

 ?For a while, I was exploring an array of career options, 

 from aeronautical engineering, to medicine,? the very successful 

 publisher of Roli Books confesses. But life for him took 

 a definite turn when Benaras Hindu University (BHU) decided 

 to start a novel course in management. Kapoor, who grew 

 up in Varanasi, decided to take it up. And he hasn?t regretted 

 it once.

 Roli Books is India?s biggest 

 coffee-table books publisher. In fact, they hardly have 

 any competition in this country. Kapoor has perfected the 

 art of getting together the best writers and photographers. 

 He provides the best packaging and international printing 

 standards, which make his books a treat. 

 ?We have a huge market for our 

 books in Europe,? he says. In fact, his books are packaged 

 with the European market in mind. But Kapoor also stresses 

 that he has an equally big market in India, where the glossy, 

 illustrated books make perfect gifts, and even good reading 

 and reference material. 

 All this started with a marketing 

 management course at BHU in Varanasi in 1974. Kapoor?s father 

 owned a newspaper distribution agency. Publishing house 

 Rupa amp; Co was owned by his maternal family, some of 

 whom were based in Calcutta (Kapoor was born there). Publishing, 

 you could say, was in his blood. 

 That, and his love for reading, 

 prompted the 19-year-old Kapoor to take up summer training 

 in Delhi with publishing house Macmillan. They were new 

 to India then, and experiencing the proverbial teething 

 troubles. Kapoor impressed them so much with his managerial 

 and administrative skills that they offered him a job immediately, 

 asking him to come back as soon as he had finished his course. 

 In 1975, Kapoor came to Delhi 

 to chart out his career. He lived in Karol Bagh initially, 

 but for all practical purposes he lived at the Macmillan 

 office at Daryaganj. ?I was hired to sell academic books, 

 but in truth, we had to do all kinds of jobs,? he says. 

 That included packing books in the warehouse, slotting them, 

 and even doing all kinds of back-office work. There were 

 times, says Kapoor, when he would go home for an hour everyday, 

 for three to four days, to freshen up and come back and 

 work again. ?I was alone, didn?t know anyone in Delhi, and 

 so could devote all my time to my job,? he says. 

 The hard work, however, paid dividends. 

 In the three years that Kapoor worked with Macmillan, his 

 salary was hiked to five times its initial level. However, 

 Kapoor decided to leave his cushy job and try out new vistas. 

 In August 1977, he took up a job with a Singapore-based 

 publishing house, although his work was the same. He was 

 still selling textbooks. Six months after he joined, however, 

 the company went bust. It was then that Kapoor decided to 

 start Roli Books. 

 ?I started Roli Books in a 350-square-feet 

 run-down warehouse in Daryaganj with one-and-a-half people,? 

 says Kapoor. A part-timer and he himself would look after 

 the entire business. By then, with his textbook-selling 

 experience, Kapoor had also made friends in the publishing 

 industry. Neil ?Brien, then head of Oxford University Press 

 (OUP), India, gave him an assignment, the first time that 

 OUP had outsourced its publishing. Kapoor had to adapt Singaporean 

 textbooks to Indian ones. The OUP team would change the 

 basic characters and do the translation, but Kapoor had 

 to do the rest. 

 Along the way, Roli Books has 

 acquired India Ink and has ventured into publishing fiction. 

 The glossy pictorial books, though, remain Kapoor?s favourite. 

 He works with a dedicated team of 41 at his posh Greater 

 Kailash II office. Frantic brainstorming sessions, attention 

 to detail, involving the best people in the business, Roli 

 Books leaves no stone unturned when it comes to churning 

 out the perfect product. At the helm of it all is Kapoor, 

 who still looks after the details of each and every book 

 that comes out of the Roli stable. 

 Roli Books has gone from strength 

 to strength, despite its focus on a niche market. ?At BHU, 

 the visiting American professors had taught us that we needed 

 to make products that the market demanded, not thrust our 

 products on it,? Kapoor reminisces. He?s definitely proven 

 to be a good student.

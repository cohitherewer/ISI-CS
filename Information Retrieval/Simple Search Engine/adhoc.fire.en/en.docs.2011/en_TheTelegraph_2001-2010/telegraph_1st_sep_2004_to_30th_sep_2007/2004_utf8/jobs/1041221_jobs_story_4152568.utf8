HR MATTERS

 Shiv Agrawal 

Head amp;Director, North amp; East 

 Q: I am 53 years old and I have been working in 

 a subsidiary branch of a nationalised coal company in Calcutta 

 for the last 28 years. I have experience in working in the 

 legal/personnel, IR/accounts departments. I was a sportsperson 

 and I had joined the organisation via the sports quota. 

 I had joined in the junior clerical grade in 1976. Now I 

 am in O.S. grade (non-managerial/ non- executive) after 

 promotion.

I hold a BSc degree from Calcutta University. During 

my employment, I have earned several professional degrees ? LLB plus postgraduate 

diploma in management (PGDM) from IMM, (Calcutta) plus DPM from Bharatiya Vidya 

Bhavan and NIPM and DHRM from Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU). 

I was not considered for promotion because my qualification is not recognised 

by DGMS under the Mines Act 1952 and also for other reasons. 

I will soon be opting for voluntary retirement 

scheme (VRS). Given my age and the fact that it is a tough job market out there, 

will I be able to get a position that will match my skill and experience? Please 

advise.

 Sanjeev Ghosh, Calcutta

 A: It is difficult to comment 

 on employability unless we can evaluate the resume of the 

 person in greater detail. Age might be a factor that will 

 go against you, especially in the private sector. You may 

 want to get in touch with placement consultants in your 

 city to get them to evaluate your career till date and then 

 advise you on the next steps. 

 Q: I am a teacher by profession and I teach physics 

 and computers in a private higher secondary school. I have 

 completed BSc (physics honours) and CNE from Novell Inc. 

 as well as CCNA from IIHT, Calcutta. Recently, I had appeared 

 for the MCA entrance test conducted by Annamalai University 

 and got selected. However, since this course will be conducted 

 under the distance education mode, I am a bit apprehensive. 

Is the MCA offered by Annamalai University recognised 

by the University Grants Commission (UGC) and All India Council for Technical 

Education (AICTE)? Will this course help me in getting a job as an IT professional? 

Many of my friends and colleagues are advising me not to go for the course. I 

am confused. Please advise.

 Chandan Munshi, Calcutta

 A: The MCA course conducted 

 by Annamalai university is recognised by several IT companies 

 as a good course for software programmers and software professionals. 

However, since you have no prior experience in software, the best you can hope for is an entry-level job in a software company from where you can rise up the ranks. All the best.

 Q: I am a 27-year-old BCom (honours) graduate. 

 I have completed the three-year course from NIIT and a course 

 in e-commerce. I have five years? work experience in office 

 administration and technical support. 

At present, I am working as an office administrator 

in a reputed company and also pursuing masters in business administration (MBA) 

course with specialisation in marketing. There is no scope for growth in my present 

job and I feel that I am stagnating here. Hence, I wish to change my job. 

As I am doing MBA in marketing, I am thinking of 

joining the marketing field. What career options will suit me at this stage? Is 

there any field where I can implement my computer and MBA skills at the same time? 

Please advise.

 Ratul, Calcutta

 A: Ratul, First sit down 

 and ask yourself what you want to do in your life. What 

 excites you more ? computers or marketing? Do note that 

 taking rash decisions will only ruin your career prospects. 

If it is marketing that excites you more, then you should ideally look for a study break in your career and do a full-time course from a good institution and then be prepared to let go of your computer/ administrative skills or use them proactively in your marketing career. 

If it is IT that you like to stick to then Calcutta is emerging as a IT/ITeS hub, and you can speak to HR consultants/ friends/ associates/ colleagues who will be able to guide you.

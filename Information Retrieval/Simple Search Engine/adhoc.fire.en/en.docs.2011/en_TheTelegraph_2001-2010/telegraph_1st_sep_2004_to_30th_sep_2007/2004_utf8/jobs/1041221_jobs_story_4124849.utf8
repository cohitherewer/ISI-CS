The future is now

 Walk away with the right paycheck with these tips on salary negotiation 

 I am currently interviewing for 

 a senior level position. I will be prepared for my current 

 salary negotiations but what I would like to do is negotiate 

 in a way that sets me up for future earnings. Can you give 

 me any advice? 

This is a good question to ask if you are joining a new organisation. You have to think ahead and pave the way for your future growth in terms of salary as well as position. So start working right away on it. 

Once you have done your basic preparation for your initial compensation package (e.g., determined what you want for a starting salary, sign-on bonus, etc.), it is a great idea to think about how you can negotiate now for things that will enhance your compensation down the road. Most people do not think that far ahead, and thereby forfeit a great opportunity. 

Here a few key points to consider: 

Talk about your interests

You can begin by explicitly raising the issue. Ask about typical raises or bonuses that this company provides, and what criterias they are based upon. Determine the key drivers of the company?s profitability or future growth, or the projects that will propel its business strategy. You can use this information to manage your time and choice of work so that you perform the right tasks as well as possible and thereby position yourself for the right benefits when the time arrives for appraisal. 

Negotiate for the right opportunities

Keep in mind that you can try to negotiate every aspect of your job, including your title, responsibilities, and people (or departments) with whom you work. Try to find out what experiences, projects, or managers enable executives to quickly gain greater recognition and raises, then see if you can get a commitment now to have access to those opportunities as you work along. 

You can say, ?I really would like to work for so and so projects because those projects are really interesting and I know I can add value to them. Can you place me there, or at least ensure that I have a shot at them?? You can even negotiate for unallocated time (e.g., I will only have to spend 90 per cent of my time in my department) and reserve the rest to use for volunteering on critical projects that you would like to work on. 

Seek quicker promotions

If you feel that you can add measurable value right away, ask for expedited performance reviews that lead to more rapid promotions and raises. Do not wait a year for an annual review, but instead request quarterly evaluations. You could say ?I want that frequent feedback so I know I am hitting the ground running ? and if I am, I should advance as quickly as I possibly can.? 

Negotiate for guarantees

Do not be afraid to negotiate guaranteed raises. Perhaps you can tie your compensation to that of your counterpart?s or your closest competitor?s (or an average of the compensation offered by similar-sized companies operating in your field). Or receive a performance-related bonus for hitting measurable goals (e.g., your department has five quarters of profitability, or an increase in revenues of so and so per cent). 

The more the target benefits the company, and seems reasonable, the better your chances of persuading the company to agree to a guaranteed raise for yourself. There are many other creative approaches that you can take, once you set your mind along this path. If nothing else, you can try to learn from the experiences of other executives who have managed to do it.

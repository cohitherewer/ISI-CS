IN LAW

ARIJIT BANERJEE

Barrister, High Court, Calcutta

 Q: I am employed in the South-eastern 

 Railway. In December 1992, a disciplinary proceeding was 

 instituted against me on allegations of misconduct. The 

 Disciplinary Authority (DA) held against me and imposed 

 certain punishments. The Appellate Authority (AA) dismissed 

 my appeal in 1997. I challenged the orders of the DA and 

 the AA before the central administrative tribunal (CAT), 

 Calcutta. By its order, the tribunal quashed the chargesheet 

 and the orders of both the DA and AA. However, I had to 

 suffer humiliation and mental agony due to the charges brought 

 against me by the management. Can I file a defamation suit 

 against the DA and/or the management as well as for undue 

 harassment claiming damages? Please advise.

S. Benari, Calcutta

 A: A defamatory statement 

 is one which exposes a person to hatred, contempt or ridicule 

 or injures him in his profession, etc. or causes him to 

 be shunned or avoided in the society. If such a statement 

 is in writing, it is called libel and if made verbally, 

 it is called slander. But no action for libel or slander 

 lies for words written or spoken in the course of any judicial 

 or quasi-judicial proceedings before any court, tribunal 

 or other authority recognised by law. This is because such 

 words or statements are absolutely privileged and even if 

 such words or statements are written or spoken maliciously 

 or without any justification, the same cannot form the basis 

 of a defamation suit. However, the Calcutta high court has 

 held that if a statement made in the course of a proceeding 

 as mentioned above is wholly irrelevant to the issue involved, 

 it may give rise to a valid cause of action for libel or 

 slander. 

In view of the aforesaid, it will be very difficult for you to maintain a suit of defamation on the basis of statements made by your employer in the course of the disciplinary proceeding. As regards your grievance for undue harassment, I am afraid the law does not appear to be in your favour. While a legal action claiming damages may lie for malicious prosecution, i.e. maliciously initiating criminal or quasi-criminal action which are ultimately dismissed as being meritless, no such legal action seems to be available in respect of similar proceedings of a civil nature which are ultimately dismissed. 

In my view, the proceedings that you were subjected to were of a civil nature and no action for damages for harassment can be successfully maintained. The law of the land does not award damages for mental anxiety suffered by a person against whom a proceeding ultimately fails. Hence, in my view. any civil suit you may institute claiming damages for defamation or undue harassment/mental anxiety suffered by you is unlikely to succeed.

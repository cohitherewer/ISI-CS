 Girl defeated in justice pursuit

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Burdwan, Sept. 24: A 16-year-old 

 girl who stood up against the meagre punishment spelt out 

 by a CPM-led conciliation board for a youth who sold her 

 cousin in Mumbai has been forced to withdraw her complaint.

 Marjina Khatoon, a Class X student in Kalna, had written to the subdivisional officer against the panchayat?s decision to let Rajab Ali get away with a fine of Rs 16,000.

 The officer, Srikumar Chakraborty, had asked the local police station, which earlier refused to register a complaint, to do so ?immediately?. 

 Rajab was arrested, but on the charge of brawling. Panchayat leaders piled pressure on Marjina?s father Haider Sheikh to persuade her to retract the complaint. There was little the family could do against a system the government wants to formalise into a law.

 On August 29, Sabina Khatoon, 14, went missing from Krishnadebpur, about 160 km from Calcutta. Villagers suspected Rajab because he was missing around the same time. When he returned, the truth emerged. Rajab confessed to having taken Sabina to Mumbai promising her a job and selling her off to a prostitution racket. 

 Rajab was forced to bring the girl back. Sabina returned on Sunday.

 Her father Kalu Sheikh, a farmer, and some others went to the Kalna police station but the officials there did not register a complaint. 

 A conciliation meeting (shalishi) called by CPM local committee member and Kalna panchayat pradhan Abdar Rahman decided that Rajab must pay a fine of Rs 16,000 to Kalu for his crime. 

 Kalu and Rajab were forced to give in writing that they accepted the decision and neither would move court or any other authority in future.

 Rahman said: ?We settled the dispute at the shalishi meeting attended by both sides. Rajab will pay Rs 16,000 to Kalu Sheikh and they have given it in writing that they have accepted the decision. The matter ends there.? 

 Marjina, armed with school education, thought the panchayat?s decision was insensitive. Her father was threatened. Haider said: ?Local leaders scolded me and threatened that we will be ostracised if we do not accept their decision. We did not know what to do... so we persuaded Marjina.?

 His daughter has stopped going to school. ?Rajab?s crime is terrible. The punishment cannot be a few thousand rupees. That is why I wrote to the SDO, but we were threatened..,? she said.

 In Krishnadebpur, Sabina remembered 10 others from nearby villages whom she met at the brothel in Mumbai.

 The officer said nothing ?can be done now? as the complaint has been withdrawn. ?The panchayat pradhan has informed me that they have settled the matter at village level,? he added.

 Colleges choose to be headless

 TAMAL SENGUPTA

 Calcutta, Oct. 26: Even as the higher education department is filling up vacancies for posts of principals in undergraduate colleges across the state, some of them are being shown the door by governing bodies of the institutions.

 Nearly 50 undergraduate colleges are virtually headless as they have no principals, officials said today.

 They are being run instead by teachers-in-charge appointed by the college governing bodies, most of which are CPM-controlled.

 In at least two colleges, principals appointed by the West Bengal College Service Commission have been removed following the orders of the governing bodies.

 The chairman of the commission, Ajit Kumar Banik, today said he was aware of some college governing bodies? refusal to accept its candidates as principals.

 ?Against this backdrop, we have decided not to send any candidates to the colleges in the near future. We are also taking up the issue with the government,? he said.

 At Kanchrapara college in North 24-Parganas, for instance, the CPM-controlled governing body has terminated the services of principal Sunil Khan, though he was appointed through a college service commission selection process.

 ?I had joined the college as principal in May, 2002, after the commission selected me. But the governing body terminated my services in May 2003, without assigning any reason,? Khan said.

 Governing body president and local CPM MLA Jagadish Das said Khan was removed because a majority of the members had opposed his appointment. ?I had to go by their decision.?

 Deben Sarkar, principal of Ranaghat College since November 1999, was removed by the CPM-controlled governing body in October, 2001. ?I was removed because I did not belong to the CPM,? he alleged.

 President of the governing body Sourendranath Nag refused comment.

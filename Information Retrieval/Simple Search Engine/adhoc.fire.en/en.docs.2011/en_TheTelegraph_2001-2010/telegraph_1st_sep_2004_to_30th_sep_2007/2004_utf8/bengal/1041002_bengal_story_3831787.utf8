 President push to digital library

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 1: The renovated ancestral home of Swami Vivekananda at Gour Mohan Mukherjee Street in North Calcutta was thrown open to the public today by President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam.

 The President, who inaugurated the library at the centre, suggested that it be made digital.

 ?The digital library at this cultural centre can be integrated with the Visva-Bharati University and other universities in Calcutta. This will facilitate researchers to study Ramakrishna and Vivekananda?s literature, comparative religion and Indian culture.?

 The renovated heritage building spread over 66 cottahs will house a museum showcasing momentoes and articles associated with Vivekananda.

 Flight delayed

 Kalam?s flight to New Delhi, scheduled to leave at 7.30 pm, was delayed by 50 minutes as the sweets he had ordered arrived late at the airport.

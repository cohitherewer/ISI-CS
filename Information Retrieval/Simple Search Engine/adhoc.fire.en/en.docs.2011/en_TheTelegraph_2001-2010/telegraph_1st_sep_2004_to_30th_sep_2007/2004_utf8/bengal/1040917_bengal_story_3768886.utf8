 Power relief on for new industries

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 16: The 

 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government today allayed fears of 

 power-intensive industries by assuring them continued electricity 

 concessions.

 ?We will fulfil our commitment to them (the aggrieved industries). As for other power-intensive industries, which are here for more than six years, we are formulating a long-term policy,? commerce and industries minister Nirupam Sen said.

 The Left Front government had in 1999 announced discounts on power tariff for six years from the date of production to attract ferro-alloy industries to Bengal.

 The state electricity board, however, stopped the concession two months ago after the West Bengal Electricity Regulatory Commission barred power utilities from charging any consumer less than what was due.

 Its directive clarified that any subsidy for any sector had to be provided by the government, not the power utilities.

 The aggrieved industries, less than six years old and including four ferro-alloy units set up in Bankura between 1999 and 2003, protested.

 Asked about the fate of such power-intensive industries, Sen today said the government would continue providing them subsidy. 

 Power minister Mrinal Banerjee had recently met Sen to discuss the problem.

 ?We are happy that the government has finally understood our problems. But we want to see the type of concession,? said .K. Das, president of Sri Vasavi Industries, one of the four new units in Bankura that had threatened to shift to Orissa.

 ?In June, we received a bill for Rs 3.66 crore. But in July, the concession was withdrawn and we got a bill for Rs 4.43 crore. If we don?t get the discount, it will be difficult for us to bear such huge electricity costs,? Das added.

 Sri Vasavi, Rohit Ferrotech, Sri Gayatri Minerals Pvt Ltd and Modern India Concast had been set up by entrepreneurs from Andhra Pradesh and Bengal.

 The electricity regulatory authority had in its directive also delinked the concession from the tariff. It put the onus on the government to determine the discount and pay that amount to the power board in advance.

 ?It is the government which will have to decide whether it will provide the discount amount for the ferro-alloy and other units as subsidy,? a power department official said.

 The regulatory authority had last year ordered a halt to cross-subsidy, sparking fears of a rise in power tariff.

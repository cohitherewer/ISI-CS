 CPM back to land reforms 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Nov. 26: After flaunting its land reforms programme for years, the CPM today admitted that the process remained ?incomplete?. 

 ?We must admit that the extremist forces have been misguiding innocent villagers in some districts highlighting lapses in our land reforms programme. We will have to set things right in land reforms to gain people?s confidence,? said CPM state secretary Anil Biswas at a party state committee meeting in the presence of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, Jyoti Basu and Left Front chairman Biman Bose. 

 He pointed out that the CPM-led front had earned popularity by successfully implementing land reforms. ?So nothing should be left incomplete in this sector,? he added. 

 In an introspective mood, the party leadership acknowledged that extremists ? be it Naxalites in the west or the KLO in the north ? are taking advantage of ?incomplete land reforms to make the poor hostile?. 

 ?Our party will have to play a major role in combating these forces politically. We have to overcome the shortcomings of land reforms,? Biswas said this afternoon. 

 More than 70 per cent of agricultural land in the state is in the possession of landless and marginal farmers, but several delegates pointed out that a majority of them cannot use the land for lack of working capital. 

 ?We are aware that landless farmers have no working capital. The Left Front government has failed to provide capital to them. Most of these poor farmers are still depending directly or indirectly on rich landlords for capital,? said one delegate. 

 The CPM today announced it is advancing its Brigade rally planned for February 13 (Saraswati Puja) by a day. 

 Memo for PM 

 Congress leader Somen Mitra said the party will hand over a document on Bengal?s deteriorating law and order to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh when he visits Calcutta on December 18.

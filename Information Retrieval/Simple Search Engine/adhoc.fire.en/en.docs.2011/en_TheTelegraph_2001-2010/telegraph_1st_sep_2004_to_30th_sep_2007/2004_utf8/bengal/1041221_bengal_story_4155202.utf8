 Officer breaks in amp; ?robs? guns, treasury guards snore 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Islampur, Dec. 20: Not in their wildest dreams did the guards at the treasury building here think that they would be caught napping, literally.

 At midnight on Saturday, subdivisional police officer Ujjal Kumar Bhowmick caught two armed sentries curled up comfortably in chairs on the verandah of the treasury building, snoring lightly. 

 Their rifles, too, were at rest, propped against a wall, an arm?s length away.

 Bhowmick decided against interfering with their sleep and chose instead to walk away with the rifles.

 Police sources said he had been tipped-off about the guards? habits. But what Bhowmick saw during his surprise check left him surprised. 

 In the barracks on the treasury premises, he wanted to test to what extent policemen could sleep.

 The door to the dorm was bolted from inside. Bhowmick tapped on it lightly. There was no response. He broke in and heard them snoring. 

 There were six guards, all of them tucked under blankets. Bhowmick picked up their rifles, lined up on a rack, and left.

 Back in office, Bhowmick called up the officer-in-charge of Islampur police station, Sukumar Mishra, and instructed him to wake up the guards, break the news of the subdivisional police officer?s visit to them, pull them off duty and replace them with more alert personnel.

 The errant policemen will be sent back to the district police headquarters at Raiganj, where they will await penal action. ?I had been receiving complaints from people about policemen posted at the treasury being lax and decided to pay a surprise visit. I found them asleep. This is serious dereliction of duty,? Bhowmick said today.

 Subdivisional officer of Islampur Rabindranath Roy said: ?The treasury not only contains cash, it stores important documents concerning land and stamp papers. I shudder to think of what would have happened if robbers had struck.? 

 A constable, however, expressed doubts over whether Bhowmick actually raided the treasury premises. ?Who will inform him at midnight about whether or not policemen are sleeping?? he asked.

 Additional superintendent of police Pallab Kanti Ghosh said: ?A departmental inquiry has been initiated and action will be taken against these personnel.?

 Writers cool with schools

 - Co-operate cry on fire measures 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Where the bell started tolling: A student passes by the gutted school at Kumbakonam.

 Calcutta, Sept. 4: The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government went after market complexes and highrises with a firemans axe for not adhering to fire safety measures. For schools, it has donned kid gloves. 

 Writers Buildings is asking the school authorities to co-operate with them for the sake of the young students. 

 The fire services department issued a notice asking all crches and Montessori, primary, Madhyamik and Higher Secondary schools to submit detailed description of fire safety measures in their respective buildings at the nearest fire service office or at the city head office by August 31. 

 While inputs have come from a large number of schools, it is clear to the department that not all schools in the city have come forward.

 We are in the process of compiling the inputs and noting down how many schools have submitted information. However, it is very clear to us that all schools have not given us the details, a fire services department official said today. 

 We will go through the inputs from school authorities and find out what they have to say, and how we can help them out. And as for the schools who have not come up to us yet, we will issue fresh appeals and not pull them up immediately, said fire services minister Pratim Chatterjee. 

 It is only after the tragedy at Kumbakonam where 94 children died in a school fire that we decided to set things in place. We cannot change the situation overnight, and want the schools to co-operate with us in a bid to have safer schools, the official added. 

 The minister agreed. Only forcing them wont help matters, he said, adding that it is for this that we have decided to give them more time. 

 Chatterjee added that help is also being sought from several quarters to locate the Montessori schools and crches. We are asking those associated with car pools for children to tell us the locations of Montessori schools as it is difficult to track down all of them otherwise. In this manner, we can locate the schools and also appeal to them to adopt fire service measures for the safety of their students, he said. 

 We cannot take any stern action right away because these norms are only being recently worked out, the official added.

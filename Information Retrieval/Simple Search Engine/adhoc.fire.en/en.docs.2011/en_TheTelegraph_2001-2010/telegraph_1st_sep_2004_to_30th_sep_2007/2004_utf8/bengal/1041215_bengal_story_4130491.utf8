 Water dues dispute rages 

 Calcutta, Dec. 14: The government today virtually issued an ultimatum to city mayor Subrata Mukherjee for not paying drinking water dues amounting to Rs 400 crore.

 The civic body has not paid the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority for the drinking water it took from it over the past five years. 

 ?Enough is enough. We cannot provide water free to the civic board. We may have to stop supply from the Garden Reach Water Works if it does not pay,? urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya said.

 He added that if the Trinamul Congress-run civic board could levy water tariff on business houses and factory owners, it should be able to pay the dues. ?Though we are still hesitant to take a drastic step like discontinuing water supply, we may have to do so in the near future,? Bhattacharya said. 

 Mukherjee said there is no question of paying up. ?Can Bhattacharya show any document saying that the corporation has to pay fees for water supplied from the Garden Reach Waterworks??

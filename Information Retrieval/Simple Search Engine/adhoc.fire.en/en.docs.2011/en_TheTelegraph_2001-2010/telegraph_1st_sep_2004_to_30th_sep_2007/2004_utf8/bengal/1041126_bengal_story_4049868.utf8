 Calcutta, Nov. 25: The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government today assured swift redress of problems afflicting many small-scale entrepreneurs in the state. 

 A large number of issues was discussed at the meeting at Writers? Buildings between small-scale entrepreneurs? associations and a government team led by the chief minister. ?We got the finance department?s nod for Rs 6 crore, which is to be offered as incentive,? said small-scale and cottage industries minister Bangsagopal Chowdhury. 

 Senior officials of the West Bengal Small Industries Development Corporation (WBSIDC) were also present at the meeting with representatives of 25 different industrial associations representing different sectors of small-scale industries. 

 An industrial estate has been planned on a five-acre plot at Rajarhat.

 Teacher held after abduction

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Chinsurah, Sept. 23: A high school teacher was arrested here yesterday in connection with the kidnapping of a 17-year-old boy.

 Sanjoy Singh, a lifescience teacher of Kesoram Rayon High School at Kuntighat in Mogra, had apparently made several calls from his mobile phone to the house of Vishal Singh before he was abducted.

 Vishal was kidnapped on Monday afternoon. But in the absence of any call for ransom, the motive is still not known. Singh, who was picked up from Tyre Bagan, 60 km from Calcutta, was remanded in police custody today.

 Police sources said among calls that Vishal received from Sanjoy?s mobile were a few by a woman who threatened him against seeing a girl. ?We have not been able to identify the girl yet,? a police officer said.

 Vishal, who failed Madhyamik this year, was apparently picked up minutes after he left home near the Dunlop factory in Sahagunj around 1.30 pm. Witnesses said his bicycle was stopped and he was forced into an Ambassador. Father Jawahar Singh, who owns an oil mill, said he was going to a dentist to get medicines. 

 Officer-in-charge of Chinsurah police station Sankha Biswas said: ?Immediately after the abduction, the teacher changed his mobile service provider.?

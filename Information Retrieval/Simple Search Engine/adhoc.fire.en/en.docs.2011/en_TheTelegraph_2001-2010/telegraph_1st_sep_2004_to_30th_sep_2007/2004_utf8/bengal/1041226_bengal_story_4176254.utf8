 Police jeep spills blood in New Town

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 25: A police van speeding down the Rajarhat flyover early this morning lost control and ran over Sheikh Rahamulla who ran a tyre repair shop in the area.

 Police were caught on the wrong foot after the accident, with residents alleging that driver Bablu Banerjee, who was later arrested, was not a police employee and did not have a valid driving licence.

 North 24-Parganas superintendent of police Praveen Kumar said: ?Sheikh Rahamulla was on his way to his shop at Lauhati when the driver of this radio transmitter van of Rajarhat police station suddenly lost control over the vehicle and hit him. Rahamulla was standing on the roadside, and the driver of the killer vehicle was arrested.?

 Soon after Rahamulla, 55, a resident of Chhapra, Bihar, died at a local hospital, MLA Tanmay Mondol said: ?Vehicles speeding down the flyover have become a menace for people in the area. And if the killer vehicle turns out to be that of the police, how secure can the people feel??

 Bablu?s arrest did not satisfy the residents. ?If the law-keepers turn out to be so callous as to kill a man under the wheels of their own vehicle, how will the common people learn to value the lives of others? How could the police allow their jeep to be driven by someone who is not part of the force?? asked an angry Naser Sheikh, the dead man?s nephew.

 Rajarhat police officials admitted Banerjee does not belong to the police force, and had been hired to drive the van. ?It is common practice to hire vehicles and drivers. The local people are getting agitated unnecessarily. That a pedestrian was killed by a police jeep does not mean that the police are callous. Rather, it is the fault of the driver concerned and he has been arrested. There is no reason why the local people should be out to tarnish the image of the police on the basis of one accident,? an official said.

 But some residents alleged that Bablu had often been spotted in the neighbourhood carrying out police orders ?in extorting money from traders?. They also said that he was drunk when he ran over Rahamulla.

 Kumar could not agree. He said: ?I am aware that the people are making a lot of allegations about the driver, but it is too early to comment on them. All I can say is that he has been arrested and we are looking into what led to the mishap??

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE

 Calcutta, Sept. 23: The government has decide to redraw the transport map along the Hooghly and the Bhagirathi. 

 The Rs 22-crore plan includes construction of 53 jetties from Tribeni in Hooghly to Farakka in Murshidabad, introduction of ferry services and construction of roads to enable passengers to reach the jetties minus hurdles in the way.

 The union surface transport ministry cleared the project following a meeting with state transport officials in Delhi on Monday. 

 The Centre will bear 90 per cent of the project cost and the state the rest. According to the Transport Infrastructure Development Corporation ? the project?s implementing agency ? the first instalment of Rs 4.52 crore is expected within a week.

 ?We have already selected 53 places, in four districts ? Hooghly, Burdwan, Nadia and Murshidabad ? for the jetties. The construction will start in a fortnight. We are drawing up a detailed plan with the PWD to connect the jetties with the main roads,? said Dhiman Mukherjee, the managing director of the corporation.

 The jetties will be close to tourist spots, major markets, haats (rural marts), and industrial areas. The routes for the ferry services are yet to be decided but private players will be allowed to run them under the aegis of the transport department and the local administration.

 Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty said the proposed the ferries would supplement road transport in the districts. ?If we can provide all amenities, a large number of commuters will avail of water transport instead of depending solely on roads,? he added.

 The minister also said his department is preparing a separate plan to boost water transport in Calcutta, Howrah and North 24-Parganas. ?We will ply launches on different routes between Calcutta, Howrah and parts of North 24- Parganas. This will benefit thousands in the industrial belt.?

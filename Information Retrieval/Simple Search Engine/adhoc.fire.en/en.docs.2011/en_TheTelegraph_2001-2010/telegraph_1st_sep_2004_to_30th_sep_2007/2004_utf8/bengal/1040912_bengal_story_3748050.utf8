 Resettle hope behind lake eviction cloud 

 OUR BUREAU 

 Calcutta, Sept. 11: Defence minister Pranab Mukherjee is at the centre of efforts to resettle nearly 19,000 squatters along railways tracks between Ballygunge and Tollygunge under the Valmiki Ambedkar Abasan Yojana and thus pave the way for peaceful eviction. 

 On September 2, Justice Barin Ghosh of Calcutta High Court directed the railways to carry out the Supreme Court?s order to evict the settlers along the Rabindra Sarovar as soon as possible. The ruling had come in a case regarding pollution of the lake, considered the lungs of Calcutta. 

 ?Pranabda has discussed the matter with railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav. If a consolidated amount is arranged by the railways, the state government can provide suitable land at the minimum cost where alternative accommodation can be made under the Valmiki Ambedkar Yojana,? said Sukhendu Sekhar Roy, the counsel representing the settlers. 

 Earlier, the settlers had refused the railways? proposal to provide land for resettlement at Ranaghat in Nadia. 

 The new proposal seems to have taken off after a delegation led by Trinamul Congress MLA Saugata Roy recently met some senior leaders of Laloo Prasad?s Rashtriya Janata Dal in Delhi and spoke for the squatters. 

 ?Primarily, it has been decided that the railways will provide a certain amount as shifting cost to the squatters and the Bengal government will allot a suitable land in the suburbs of the city to construct shelters for the squatters,? a railway official said. 

 ?We want a peaceful settlement. The government will have to provide alternative accommodation for us,? said Ratan, a leader of Akata, an organisation of the settlers. 

 ?I will also pray before the court seeking a directive to bring the settlers under the Valmiki Ambedkar Abasan Yojana. My only intention is to develop the environmental condition of Rabindra Sarovar,? said Subhas Dutta, who had moved the pollution petition. 

 The railway authorities are planning the eviction drive with assistance from the state government and the municipal corporation.

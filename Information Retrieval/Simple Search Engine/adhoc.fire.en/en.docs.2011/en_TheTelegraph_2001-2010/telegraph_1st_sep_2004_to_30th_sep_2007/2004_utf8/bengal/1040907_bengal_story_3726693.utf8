 Fire in office district

 A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta, Sept. 6: A fire broke out in an office 

on the sixth floor of a seven-storey building on Clive Row around 6.30 this evening. 

 It took 17 fire engines more than three hours to bring the fire under control. No one was injured but there was damage to property, a fireman said. We have not been able to ascertain the cause, but the fire was confined to a room with wooden cubicles and office materials like papers and furniture, said Dipak Kumar Sarkar, the divisional fire brigade officer. 

 Residents noticed smoke billowing out of Rampuria Chambers, built in 1927. Though the building houses offices, about 20 people spend the nights on its terrace. They rushed down hearing an alarm. A fireman said there was more smoke than fire because of the wood and papers inside.

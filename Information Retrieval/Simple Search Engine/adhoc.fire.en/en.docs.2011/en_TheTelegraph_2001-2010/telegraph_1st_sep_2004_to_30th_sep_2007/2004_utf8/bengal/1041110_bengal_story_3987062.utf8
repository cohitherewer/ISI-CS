 Pushback in the dark

 OUR BUREAU

 Nov. 9: Seven persons stranded in no-man?s land at Belagachi in Bihar?s Kishanganj since Sunday morning were pushed back into Bangladesh by the Border Security Force around midnight. 

 The border guards kept the operation under wraps even hours after they had escorted the group to a point on the border where no Bangladesh Rifles personnel were in sight. 

 Till evening, none but BSF officers knew the outcome of the impasse between the forces on either side. ?The entire operation went off without the BDR?s knowledge,? a senior official said later. 

 The BSF had said yesterday that those stranded were from Bagerhaat district in Bangladesh. The seven ? three men, two women and children ? were part of a larger group spotted by jawans around 3:30 am on Sunday. 

 Confronted by the guards, most of them managed to retreat to Bangladesh. Seven failed to make it back as neither the BSF nor the BDR allowed them entry into their territory.

 Senior BSF officials rushed to the spot last night to settle the impasse through dialogue. One of them today disclosed that they had ?successfully? pushed the group back into Bangladesh. 

 ?A man in the group told us that they hailed from a particular district in Bangladesh (Bagerhaat). They also told us that they wanted jobs here,? the official added. 

 The detention of the Bangladeshis on Indian territory sparked allegations that the BDR?s 20th Battalion, posted at Mundamala, opposite Belagachi, had masterminded the push-in .

 Tension simmered through the day around Belagachi, Sonamoti and Satvitta as news of the standoff spread. Since early this morning, the BSF had cordoned off the triangle formed by these places. 

 BSF deputy inspector-general (north Bengal Frontier Headquarters) Sukhjinder Singh Sandhu told said: ?We have expressed grave concern over the manner in which the BDR tried to clandestinely push the Bangladeshis into India. The matter was communicated in writing to the commandant of the BDR?s 20th Battalion posted at Mundamala.? The BDR is yet to reply.

 A meeting between BSF and BDR officials at Belagachi this morning discussed joint measures to defuse the tension along the international border. The fact that the intruders had been pushed back by then was, however, not brought up. 

 School unrest

 Police had to rescue teachers gheraoed by a mob of about 2,000 at Sadi Ghati Primary School in Ghatal, West Midnapore. Guardians of Jhuma Ghati, a Class II student, complained to the police that she had to be taken to hospital after being beaten by a teacher.

 CPM boots out seven 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Dec. 22: The CPM today expelled seven members for ?anti-party? activities. 

 Six of them, Sanjoy Mitra, Rajsekhar Purkait, Provat Manna, Salil Mullick, Prabir Das and Gopal Pal, belong to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation zonal committee and were hauled up for breach of discipline while attending a meeting sometime ago. 

 The seventh person to be sacked was Nagina Begum, a party member in Taltola. Action was taken against her after the party found her allegation that another member had pushed her into the flesh trade in Kashmir, where she had gone with him to find a job, false.

 Calcutta, Nov. 1: Subhas Chakraborty told the CPM leadership today the pressure being piled on him for alleged links with the dreaded hatkata Dilip was linked with the party?s organisational polls.

 At a meeting with state CPM secretary Anil Biswas and Left Front chairman Biman Bose, who returned from Delhi last night apparently to probe the criminal?s connections in the party, the transport minister said a section of its North 24-Parganas unit was trying to corner him.

 Party sources said Chakraborty cited the example of Sushanta Ghosh, who used to be the minister?s deputy. ?When Sushanta?s ex-confidential assistant accused him of misdeeds, including attempted murder, neither the party nor the government took cognisance.? 

 ?But, strangely, a great deal of importance is being attached to an unsubstantiated charge against me, being levelled by a few odd people with help from a section of the media. Nobody thinks it necessary to ask them to place evidence in support of their position.?

 At Writers? Buildings, Chakraborty had his chin up and contested the charges. ?I shall not attach any importance to anything other than what my party says? The question of resignation does not rise. It will come only if my party thinks I should quit.?

 Chakraborty also claimed at the meeting with the CPM leaders that a section of the district police was hostile towards him. In support of his contention, the minister named certain party colleagues, one of whom is a minister said to be close to Humayun Kabir, the police officer who picked up Bengal?s most wanted man. 

 The meeting came in the wake of former chief minister Jyoti Basu and senior leader Benoy Konar?s assertions that an independent party probe was necessary to confirm the charges against Chakraborty. 

 The transport minister looks at Basu as a mentor.

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee left the party headquarters on Alimuddin Street before Chakraborty arrived around 11.15 a.m. 

 ?I had no links with Dilip, neither did I organise his sanctuary at Haripal,? Chakraborty said. ?I have seen some scandal or the other is programmed to corner me before state party conferences. It is time to investigate this as well.? 

 The CPM leadership today clammed up on the issue. Biswas said: ?We will require a few more days to finish our inquiry.? Sources said he is likely to meet Basu before formulating the party?s stand.

 Power cards in Sunderbans

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Durgapur, Sept. 4: Forget long queues. Or long bills and weird amounts. Just buy a prepaid smart card from any West Bengal State Electricity Board outlet according to your need.

 The West Bengal Renewable Energy Development Authority has decided to introduce the Smart Card Operated Prepaid Energy Meters, which would start replacing the existing electricity meters, after the pujas.

 Under the scheme, consumers would get a prepaid card according to their demand, which they can recharge by making additional payments. The prepaid meters will alert the consumers before the card is exhausted, prompting them to recharge the cards within three days.

 The concept of such meters was developed by S.P. Gon Chowdhury, the director of the renewable energy authority, and the design of the meters was prepared by Joydeb Roychowdhury, a scientist at the Central Mechanical Research Institute, Durgapur.

 The joint venture project between the mechanical research institute and the renewable energy authority started a year ago and the required fund has been provided by the authority, said Gon Chowdhury at a ceremony held today at the research institutes auditorium to inaugurate the prepaid energy meters.

 The director of the institute, Gopal Prashad Sinha, handed over a meter to power minister Mrinal Banerjee.

 These meters would initially be installed in the remote islands of the Sunderbans in South 24-Parganas, where solar power plants have already been installed. Soon after the pujas, we will provide prepaid energy meters to the consumers of Moushumi, Sagar Islands and in parts of Namkhana and Patharpratima blocks in South 24-Parganas. Later, other areas will have to adopt this technology, Gon Chowdhury said.

 Banerjee was also optimistic about the success of this concept. The scheme is set to revolutionise electricity consumption. If the scheme gains popularity, it would be implemented in all the districts of the state, asserted the power minister.

 We have developed four such prepaid meters on an experimental basis and soon will develop 100 more for commercial uses, said Sinha. Another 100 meters will be developed by March, though the renewable energy development authority will start replacing the existing meters with prepaid ones after the pujas.

 Each meter will cost about Rs 3,000 now but we expect its price to soon come down to Rs 1,500. Consumers will have to pay the installation charges, said Gon Chowdhury.

 Initially, prepaid cards of Rs 100 denomination will be available at solar power plant offices in different areas of the Sunderbans.

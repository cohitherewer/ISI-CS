 Pandal relief

 Hili (South Dinajpur), Sept. 

 19: Bangladesh has softened its stand on the puja pandal 

 bar in border villages here.

 Ganesh Saha, the secretary of Biplabi Sangha, which has been organising Durga puja for 50 years and whose pandal was in the heart of the row, said: ?The news reached us this evening. We have again summoned the decorator.? The good news came after a Friday fraught with tension as border troops on both sides deployed renewed forces. BSF sources said senior officers had ?long discussions with their Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) counterparts? to defuse the growing tension.

 The BDR had earlier objected to pandals within 150 m of the frontier.

 Cong sticking to CMP, says Pranab

 OUR BUREAU

 Sept. 12: A day after Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said the CPM might withdraw support to the Centre if it fails to implement the common minimum programme, defence minister Pranab Mukherjee said the Congress-led government is ?strictly adhering to it?.

 Mukherjee, also the state Congress chief, told a news conference at Ahiran, about 270 km from Calcutta, that the Centre is bound to act in accordance with the programme, which the central allies had agreed upon. 

 ?Though the CPM is not a signatory to the CMP (common minimum programme), it had extended support to it. Why is the question of withdrawal of support cropping up now?? he asked.

 Speaking at a state bidi workers? conference at Jhalda in Purulia yesterday, the chief minister said the CPM would rethink its support to the United Progressive Alliance government if the Congress failed to provide ?good governance?. He also resented the manner in which the Centre hiked petrol, diesel and LPG prices.

 State CPM secretary Anil Biswas today joined forces with Bhattacharjee. He reiterated the chief minister?s threat to withdraw support from the Centre if it failed to implement the common minimum programme.

 Keeping the pressure up, the party politburo member said the Congress is ?going the BJP way?. 

 Speaking to reporters at the state party headquarters on Alimuddin Street, Biswas said: ?The Congress is going the BJP way by following the economic policies of the NDA (National Democratic Alliance). If it does not change its ways and take steps to implement the CMP, people will isolate them and the Left parties will not have to do much.?

 Jyoti Basu expressed unhappiness about the Manmohan Singh government. ?We are unhappy with the performance of the Centre,? the veteran CPM leader said. 

 He was peeved with the involvement of the World Bank and other international funding agencies in the consultative committees of the planning commission. 

 Basu said he would take up the issue with Congress president Sonia Gandhi and the Prime Minister during his visit to Delhi on Thursday. He will be in the capital along with Bhattacharjee to attend the politburo meeting. 

 Mukherjee today began a two-day visit to his Jangipur parliamentary constituency in Murshidabad by addressing a string of street-corner meetings at Farakka, Ahiran and Raghunathgunge. At Brahman village in Farakka, he promised an anti-erosion scheme to protect the embankments on the Bhagirathi.

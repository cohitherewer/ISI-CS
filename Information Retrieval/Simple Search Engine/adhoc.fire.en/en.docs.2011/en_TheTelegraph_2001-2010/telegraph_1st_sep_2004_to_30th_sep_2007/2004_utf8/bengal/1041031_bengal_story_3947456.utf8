 Only two of the dead have been identified yet ? Jitendra Kumar Gupta (45) and one-and-half-year-old Priyanka.

 The injured have been admitted to a private nursing home in Siliguri, Jalpaiguri superintendent of police Ajay Nand said.

 Doctors described the condition of four of them as serious. ?The women and children have received multiple injuries.... Their condition is critical,? Anup Chakraborty, the attending doctor, said.

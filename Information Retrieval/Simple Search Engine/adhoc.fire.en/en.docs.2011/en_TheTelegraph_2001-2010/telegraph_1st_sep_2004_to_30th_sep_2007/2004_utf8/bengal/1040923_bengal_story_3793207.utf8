 Kenya-style bonfire of hides, tusks

 Alipurduar, Sept. 22: The forest department means business and criminals involved in the trafficking of animal parts will get the message loud and clear this wildlife week. 

 Following the example set by then Kenyan President Daniel Arap Moi in 1989, the department will torch all animal parts seized from poachers, smugglers and illegal traders.

 Moi had set ablaze 10 tonnes of ivory worth $3 million in a bid to end the mindless slaughter of African tuskers before a worldwide broadcast audience of 850 million. 

 The bonfire reduced 2,000 tusks to ashes.

 The site of the dramatic ?ivory bonfire?, in Nairobi National Park, has a commemorative plaque with the words ?great objectives often require great sacrifices? inscribed on it. 

 The first-of-its-kind initiative in India has been approved by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who is also the chairman of the Wildlife Advisory Board.

 The seized animal parts ? which include tiger, deer and leopard skins, rhino horns, exotic birds and animal bones, deer antlers and tusks ? will be destroyed during wildlife week. 

 Bhattacharjee will inaugurate the wildlife week on October 6 in Calcutta. The closing ceremony will be held at Chilapata under Cooch Behar forest division.

 M.A. Sultan, the chief conservator of forests (wildlife), said from Calcutta: ?The public bonfire will be lit in Calcutta on October 8 and in Chilapata on October 12. We want the poachers to know that their way of life does not pay.? 

 The chief conservator of forests said all the forest divisions had been asked to draw up a list of confiscated animal parts in their possession.

 ?Once we get the details, we will make a final list of items that will be torched during the wildlife week celebrations. We have already received permission from the pollution control board. The fire department will assist us in keeping the blaze under control,? Sultan said.

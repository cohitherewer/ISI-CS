 Rape protest unites foes

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Haroa (North 24-Parganas), Sept 11: The ruling CPM joined forces with the Opposition Trinamul Congress-BJP combine and the Congress in calling a dawn-to-dusk bandh today to protest yesterday?s rape of a 25-year-old housewife by constable Soumitra Chowdhury in the Haroa police station barracks.

 ?We are not happy over the mere suspension of the constable. We want him dismissed from service. He is a blot on the image of our police administration,? said Amita Pal, the secretary of the Basirhat zonal unit of the CPM-led Ganatantrik Mahila Samity.

 Anwara Khatoon, another samity member, pointed out that last month a Railway Protection Force constable was dismissed after he was found to have raped a housewife inside a railway compartment. ?Yesterday?s incident is no less heinous than the previous one. Why should not the constable be dismissed?? she asked.

 Khatoon said the samity would write to the party leadership seeking ?stringent action? against the constable.

 Bhuvan Mondal, a CPM local committee member, demanded that the officer-in-charge of the police station also be punished.

 ?We have reports that the OC himself put pressure on the housewife to withdraw the charge. But she did not give in. Why should the OC mediate to save the constable?? he asked.

 The medical report that reached the Haroa police station confirmed that the victim, who returned home this afternoon amid tight security, was raped.

 Life ground to a halt in Haroa and its adjoining areas today. Shops, business establishments and educational institutions were closed and buses could not ply between Haroa and other parts of the district because of the bandh.

 Supporters of both the CPM and the Trinamul Congress marched to the police station demanding that action be taken against the ?guilty constable?.

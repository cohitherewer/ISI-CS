 Govt ready for bandh II

 - Backers and opponents put response onus on people

 OUR BUREAU

 Nov. 20: Having to grapple with the second shutdown in a week, the government today sounded resolute about foiling the bandh on Monday.

 Chief secretary Asok Gupta?s Friday circular spurred district officials into action to ensure that November 22 turns out like any other Monday. 

 ?We have made the same arrangements as on November 17 to keep everything normal. Our primary concern is to ensure normal life,? inspector-general of police, law and order, Chayan Mukherjee said. 

 A Naxalite outfit, the CPI-ML (Liberation), has called the bandh to protest against the fuel price hike. SUCI had called the bandh on November 17 to highlight the same issue. The Trinamul Congress, too, has called a bandh against the price hike. The bandh on December 3 will be the third in little over a fortnight. 

 The inspector-general said additional forces headed by senior officials will be deployed at key points in the city and all over the state to ensure unhindered flow of traffic. ?We have also ordered immediate arrest of those who put up road or rail blocks. Instructions to provide police escort to those stranded have been issued,? he added.

 The CPM, which deployed its cadre during the SUCI-sponsored bandh, today said party workers would keep vigil to avert untoward incidents on Monday but ?will not be on the roads?. 

 State party secretary Anil Biswas said: ?People will reject Monday?s bandh as they did on November 17.?

 However, if the authorities sounded firm, the bandh promoters tried to match their zeal in going ahead.

 Kartik Pal, the state secretary of the CPI-ML (Liberation), threatened that they would resist any move on the part of the government and the CPM cadre to foil the strike. ?We are firm on the bandh. It is to show that we are with the common people and not against them,? he said. 

 ?We don?t need to fight against the CPM cadre on the streets. People?s response would be spontaneous and they will not go to work that day. It will not only be a chakka (wheels) bandh, but also a rail bandh.? 

 Smarajit Roychowdhury, the secretary of the CPM-backed government employees? union, Coordination Committee, said the bandh would flop ?minus people?s support?.

 ?As on November 17, employees would join work to show they are against unjustified bandhs. We have asked them to respond similarly to the next bandh as well.?

 The government which, prompted by a high court order, had mentioned the possibility of a pay cut for being absent from offices on November 17, has not done so this time.

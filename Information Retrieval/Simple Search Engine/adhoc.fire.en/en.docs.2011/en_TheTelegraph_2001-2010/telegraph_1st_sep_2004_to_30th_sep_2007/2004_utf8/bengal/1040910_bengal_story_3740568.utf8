 Jail house for mentally ill

 SIMI KAMBOJ

 Calcutta, Sept. 9: In April, Rana Majhi, a mentally challenged 23-year-old, told his mother he was going to the fields behind their house in Siliguri. He was then found loitering in Basirhat, several hundred kilometres south. Rana, who could not remember his home, was sent to Basirhat jail and then to Dum Dum jail. After weeks of treatment, he told a psychiatrist where he lived and returned home in July. 

 Close to a thousand such people are still in jails and destitute homes across the state, according to a survey. Operation Oasis, the study by an NGO, Sevac, found over 10 per cent of the inmates at correctional homes and homes for destitutes and vagrants suffered from mental disorder. 

 ?They are not criminals. Most were found loitering and sent to prison on petty charges, where they continue to languish without treatment,? said Prativa Sengupta of Sevac.

 He cited the instance of Amit Bose, who was in Dum Dum Central Jail for 24 years. After being refused bail in a petty case, he was sent to Krishnagar Jail and then moved to Dum Dum. While there, he underwent treatment by doctors attached to Sevac. He was released in January 2002.

 Commissioned by the National Human Rights Commission, the study conducted between April 2001 and March 2004 covered the Dum Dum jail, Presidency Jail, Alipore Special Jail, Behrampore Central Jail, the Kishalaya Home for Boys, the Liluah Home, the Dhakuria Male Vagrant Home, the Uttarpara Female Vagrant Home and the Home for Lunatic Vagrants in Murshidabad. 

 Among the inmates screened, 648 were suffering from various psychoses, schizophrenia, mood disorder, epilepsy, retardation, hysteria or substance abuse. The report, which has been submitted to the rights panel chief, points out: 

 In Alipore, the challenged inmates are locked up for 16 hours at a stretch on occasions. Fights are common and the authorities seldom intervene.

 In Behrampore, there is no separate cell for female mental patients. They are kept handcuffed with other prisoners.

 In Presidency Jail, mentally ill women are housed in wards for undertrials and convicts. Meals are substandard and medicine inadequate.

 At Liluah, the home office being closed on weekends, medicines are not administered to patients on these days. No doctors are at hand either. 

 The facilities at the other places were no better.

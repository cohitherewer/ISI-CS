 Parents in HC against son?s torture

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Nov. 5: The high court today asked the police chief to take action against a son who allegedly tortured and beat up his father, an 86-year-old cancer patient, for property.

 Prafulla Chandra Mitra, a resident of Canning, about 40 km from Calcutta, had earlier complained against his son, a trader at the local police station, but the officers slept on it.

 His daughter Ruby Mitra, a doctor who lives at Konnagar in Hooghly, realised her parents? misery and moved court on behalf of Mitra.

 Mitra, a freedom fighter, and his 76-year-old wife attended the court today. 

 Vacation bench judge Asim Banerjee asked the police to submit a compliance report before a regular bench after the high court reopens. The director-general of police and the South 24-Parganas superintendent were asked to ensure action against the son.

 Ruby had demanded action against the force in Canning that did nothing to rein in Siddhartha Shankar, her brother.

 The lawyer for the petitioner told the court: ?Siddhartha is trying to grab his father?s property. He has already sold out some of the landed property by forcing his father to put his signature in the sale deed.

 ?Now, he wants to sell two shops belonging to Mitra and is trying to force his father to allow him to do so. When his father declined to put his signature on the dotted line, Siddhartha beat him up.? 

 The lawyer claimed that Ruby had been driven out of the house when she came to see her ailing father. 

 Siddhartha?s lawyer claimed that Mitra had taken an advance from those about to buy the shops. ?The allegations against my client are false and fabricated.?

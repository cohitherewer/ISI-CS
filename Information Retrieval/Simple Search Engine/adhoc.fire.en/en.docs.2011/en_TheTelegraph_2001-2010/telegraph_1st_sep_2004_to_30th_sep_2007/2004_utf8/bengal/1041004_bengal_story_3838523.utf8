 Centre cap irks Buddha

 Calcutta, Oct. 3: The chief minister today expressed displeasure over Delhi?s decision to make clearance from its ministry of environment and forests mandatory for projects worth over Rs 50 crore. 

 ?Why should we seek Delhi?s clearance for a Rs 60 crore project in Haldia? Our agencies like (the) West Bengal Pollution Control Board are quite capable of assessing the impact of a project on environment and issuing no-objection certificates,? Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said. However, speaking on the draft national environment policy, he added that the state government ?does not want unnecessary confrontation with the Centre?.

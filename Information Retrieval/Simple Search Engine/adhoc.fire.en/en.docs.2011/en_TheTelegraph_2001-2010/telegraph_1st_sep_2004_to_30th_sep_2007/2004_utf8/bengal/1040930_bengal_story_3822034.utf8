 Chilli powder break-out 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Midnapore, Sept. 29: Three undertrials threw chilli powder in the eyes of five armed escorts as their van stopped at a railway level-crossing and escaped last evening. They were on their way back to Midnapore Central Jail from the Contai sub-divisional court. 

 One of them was arrested later at night, but two are untraced. A search is on. Four policemen have been suspended. 

 Police said the incident took place when the van stopped near Malka village in West Midnapore, 140 km from Calcutta, at a level-crossing. 

 ?There were seven prisoners. When the van stopped at the level-crossing, the three prisoners took out some red chilli powder and threw it in the eyes of the guards and fled. The four others remained in their seats,? an official said. 

 The fugitives were identified as Riaz Ali, Sheikh Munna and Bapi Patra, all being tried for dacoity in Contai. Riaz has been arrested. 

 The undertrials seemed to have timed their escape well. Dusk was setting in and the armed policemen had already travelled over 110 km to Contai court. 

 ?It appears that they (policemen) were tired on their way back but nevertheless an inquiry into the escape will be held,? an official said.

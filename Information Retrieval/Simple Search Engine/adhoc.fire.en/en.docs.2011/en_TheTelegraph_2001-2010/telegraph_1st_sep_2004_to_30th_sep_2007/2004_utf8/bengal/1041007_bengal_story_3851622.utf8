 Four killed in shoe unit fire

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Oct. 6: Four workers were killed and several injured when a blaze engulfed a shoe factory this evening at Memanpur on Mahestala main road. 

 About 17 fire-tenders were rushed to control the fire in the first floor which soon spread throughout the two-storey building, where work was on in full swing around 7.45 pm to meet the Puja demand. Around 25 workers are employed in the factory in three shifts. 

 Firefighters claimed the flames spread quickly feeding on the combustible adhesives and leather material. The injured, many with severe burns, were rushed to the M.R. Bangur Hospital. 

 ?The owner of the factory, Bacchu Ghosh, is struggling with severe burns,? said South 24-Parganas superintendent of police S.. Gupta. 

 An FIR has been lodged at Mahestala police station and police have begun a probe into whether the factory had met the fire regulations. 

 Preliminary probe by the firefighters suggests a bidi butt sparked the blaze. 

 Witnessed said around 7.45 pm, smoke began spewing out of the first-floor widows. Soon the flames leapt up. They claimed several workers jumped from the second floor to save their lives.

 ?Even after the fire was visible, there was not much that could be done as the gates were locked,? said Ratan Bagchi, a local CPM leader.

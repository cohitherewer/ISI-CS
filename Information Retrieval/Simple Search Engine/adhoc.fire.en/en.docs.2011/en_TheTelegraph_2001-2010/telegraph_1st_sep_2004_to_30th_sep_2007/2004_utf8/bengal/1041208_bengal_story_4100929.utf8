 Fear stalks blast belt 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Midnapore, Dec. 7: State police chief Shyamal Dutta today visited Midnapore on chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s instructions as a fear psychosis seemed to be taking hold of Kakrajhore, where suspected Naxalites blew up a forest bungalow and set ablaze vehicles used to build roads on Saturday. 

 The director-general met senior police officials like inspector-general (western range) Jogesh Chatterjee, IG (Intelligence Branch) Sandhi Mukherjee and DIG (Midnapore range) Gangeswar Singh at police superintendent Ajoy Nanda?s office. 

 ?Construction of the 12.5 km road will resume on Thursday, come what may. We will deploy policemen at all vulnerable points on the road to ward off Naxalite attacks, if necessary,? Dutta was quoted as telling the police personnel. 

 He advised them not to panic. ?If you face them with brave hearts, the Naxalites will flee. Don?t forget, we will have to rule here and not the Naxalites,? he added. 

 But people in Kakrajhore have pressed the panic button. Forest department workers have moved to the Bhulabheda range office, about 18 km from the forest.

 Some labourers working on the road between Odalchua and Kankrajhore fled on Saturday itself. They have refused to return, despite assurances of protection. 

 Among those who fled today include Kankrajhore forest beat officer Dijomoni Bera and two forest workers, Arun Sabar and Garai Hansda. Gopinath Mahato, caretaker of the Kankrajhore forest bungalow, went missing on Saturday. 

 ?We have closed down the Kankrajhore beat office and asked the workers to go elsewhere after the attack,? said a forest official. But Bijon Majumdar, Jhargram divisional forest officer, denied it.

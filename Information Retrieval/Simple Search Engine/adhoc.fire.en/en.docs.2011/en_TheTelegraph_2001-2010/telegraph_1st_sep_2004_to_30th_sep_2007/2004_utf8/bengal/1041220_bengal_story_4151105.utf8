 Pranab proposes, Mamata nays

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Dec. 19: Pranab Mukherjee today again held the welcome-to-Congress banner up for Mamata Banerjee. 

 ?Nothing is impossible in politics. So, our doors are always open for Mamata and she should make up her mind. Let them all strengthen the Congress in Bengal,? said Mukherjee, the defence minister and state Congress chief.

 If the Trinamul Congress snaps ties with the BJP-led NDA, an electoral alliance with the party is a definite possibility, he added.

 Reacting to the proposal, an angry Mamata reportedly told associates that the question does not arise as the Congress ?has become a stooge of the CPM?. 

 ?Let the Congress first sever its ties with the communists,? she is learnt to have said. 

 About two months ago, Mukherjee made a similar appeal to Mamata while addressing a news conference at the Congress office. But Mamata had snuffed out any such possibility, the way she did today. 

 Echoing Mamata, her party?s chief whip in the Assembly, Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay, ruled out any pact with the Congress in the near future. ?There has been no discussion at all on this score in the organisation. Instead (of returning to the parent party), we have decided to bring our organisation back to its former glory by undertaking a string of programmes,? he said. 

 He added that the party?s immediate task is to counter the CPM?s ?malicious campaign suggesting that our organisation has become weak?. 

 In doing so, the party has lined up a law-violation programme at Esplanade on Wednesday, in which Mamata will court arrest. 

 However, a section of Trinamul is opposed to the party?s relations with the NDA. 

 Leaders belonging to the minority community have been demanding an ?immediate break-up?. Sultan Ahmed, the chief of the party?s minority cell, said: ?We want Mamata to snap ties with BJP immediately. The beleaguered state BJP has become a burden on us.? 

 Mainul Haque Chowdhury, a mayor-in-council member in the Trinamul-controlled city civic board, echoed Ahmed. 

 ?We should not have been in the NDA even for a day after BJP president L.K. Advani decided to go ahead with his aggressive Hindutva,? said Chowdhury.

 Several state Congress leaders are hopeful of Mamata?s ?possible return?. 

 A senior Congress leader said: ?Mamata is suffering from indecision. A clear picture will emerge by early next year when the party begins its preparations for the Calcutta corporation elections, likely to be held in June.?

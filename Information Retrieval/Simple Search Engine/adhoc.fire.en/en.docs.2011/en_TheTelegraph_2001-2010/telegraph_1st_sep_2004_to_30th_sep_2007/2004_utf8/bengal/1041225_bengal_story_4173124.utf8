 Jitters over freed church raid suspects 

 RABI BANERJEE 

 Maliapota, Dec. 24: It?s Christmas-eve, yet the joy is muted. The daring raid on the church here during midnight mass two years ago is fresh on the minds of the faithful. 

 This year, fear lurks behind the sadness. The villagers are scared as the 20 persons arrested in connection with the raid were acquitted six months ago for lack of evidence. Moreover, police have failed to arrest the principal accused, Suranjan Biswas, who used to work in the church. Investigations showed he had masterminded the raid. 

 On this day in 2002, 40 masked dacoits raided the church here in Nadia?s Tehatta, 140 km from Calcutta, armed with revolvers and other weapons. They looted about 1,200 villagers assembled for the mass, the church?s safe boxes and assaulted the head priest, Father T.J. Abraham. 

 District superintendent of police Benoy Chakraborty said the police had submitted chargesheets against all the accused, but most of the witnesses did not turn up in court. 

 ?Some of them appeared, but they refused to identify the accused. So all of them were acquitted,? he said. Chakraborty added that the district police are contemplating an appeal in the high court to restart the case. 

 ?Though the dacoity took place two years ago, we are scared as the accused went scot-free. A permanent police camp has been set up here but still we have asked our women not to wear ornaments during the midnight mass,? said Biswanath Mondal, a villager. 

 The police have beefed up security around the church. 

 ?The villagers are afraid of a rerun of the incident two years ago as the arrested persons have been released. Sensing this, we have sought heavy security arrangements from the district police,? said Father Ram Sarkar, who took over as head priest after Abraham?s transfer a few months ago. 

 As a precaution, the church has asked villagers not to deposit their valuables and savings with the church. ?We just don?t want to take any chances,? said Sarkar. 

 The dacoits seemed to have been attracted to the church as the villagers of Maliapota used to trust the church with their valuables instead of a bank. 

 ?The villagers are still reluctant to deposit their incomes in banks. So we have established the Catholic Charity Centre, an NGO run by the Krishnagar Catholic Church. The money they deposit here is sent to Krishnagar every day,? said Sarkar.

 Murder hint in Citu death

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Sept. 4: A Citu leader died last night, apparently in a road mishap, when he was returning from Tarapith in Birbhum district, but the district Citu leadership is not ruling out murder as the cause of death.

 His middle-aged female co-passenger has been admitted to the Kaligunj block hospital.

 Rabi Hazra, a Citu district committee member, was travelling on a motorcycle when it collided at 8.30 pm with a lorry at Gobindapur in the Kaligunj police station area, 170 km from Calcutta.

 Hazra, 45, died on the spot on national highway 34 near Plassey, a police officer said.

 But Citu district secretary Gopal Karmakar is sceptical.

 Police told us Hazra died in an accident, but our local leadership said he was murdered, Karmakar said. They said owners of shops near the road did not hear any collision when the accident reportedly took place. We have asked the police to conduct a probe.

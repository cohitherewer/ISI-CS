 Rajdhani 

 Patna, Sept. 18: The timely detection of a crack in the Patna-Kiul railway track this morning averted the possibility of mishaps involving two Rajdhani Express trains but threw traffic in disarray. 

 Danapur divisional railway manager K.B.. Mittal said a driver noticed the ?rail fracture? near Mokama and reported it at 7.20 am. Another report said a gangman reported the two-inch crack just before the Howrah-bound Rajdhani was to pass around 7 am. 

 The train was held up for 80 minutes. The Down Guwahati Rajdhani, too, was supposed to pass around the time.

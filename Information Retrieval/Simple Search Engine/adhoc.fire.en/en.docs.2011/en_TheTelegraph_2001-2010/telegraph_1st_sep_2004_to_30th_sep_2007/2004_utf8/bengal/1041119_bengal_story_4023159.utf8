 Naxalites send police and party scurrying 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Midnapore, Nov. 18: Police today detained six people in connection with the killing of a district intelligence branch constable in an area known to be a Naxalite hotbed.

 Chunilal Maity was shot dead in Lalgarh, West Midnapore, about 8 km from the forest where six jawans of the Eastern Frontier Rifles were blown up by a landmine last month.

 The chief minister today held a meeting at Writers? Buildings with home secretary Amit Kiran Deb and director-general of police Shyamal Dutta to assess the situation in Naxalite-infested West Midnapore, Bankura and Purulia. 

 ?Massive combing operations are on and we hope to arrest Chunilal Maity?s killers soon,? said Deb.

 Police officials said investigations have revealed that those who killed Maity belonged to the same group that planted the landmines in Bankishol forest. 

 ?Six guerrillas, including a woman, comprised the squad that surrounded Maity and pumped bullets into him in a field where he had gone to collect information on Naxalites. Three persons carried out the killing and three others stood at a distance,? an official said.

 West Midnapore superintendent of police Vineet Kumar Goyal said raids are being conducted in the Lalgarh jungles. Jawans of the Eastern Frontier Rifles, the Border Security Force and special combat forces and the police are also conducting searches in neighbouring Daltikari, Tantisole, Dhansola and Amtala.

 Maity?s killing has sent shock waves through the CPM in the run-up to its local committee conferences in Naxalite-infested Belpahari, Banspahari and Lalgarh later in November. The district leadership has asked party cadre to wind up meetings by 3 pm so that delegates can return home safe. 

 Dahareswar Sen, a party district secretariat member, said: ?We have asked our leaders in Belpahari, Banspahari and Lalgarh to fold up meetings by 2 pm, at most 3. Many of our comrades will come to attend the meets from remote areas and they should be able to reach home before dark.? 

 Some of the cadre seemed to have lost faith in the security machinery. 

 ?The police are finding it difficult to protect themselves, how can they protect us?? said Himangsu Mahato, the secretary of the Belpahari local committee. 

 The police described Maity as ?a very good operative? who knew the terrain.

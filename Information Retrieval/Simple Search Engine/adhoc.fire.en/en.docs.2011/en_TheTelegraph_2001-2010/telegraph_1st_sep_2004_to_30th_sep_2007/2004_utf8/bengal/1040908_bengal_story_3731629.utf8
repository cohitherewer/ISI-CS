 Baby in bundle at school gate

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Midnapore, Sept. 7: Alerted by its cries, sweepers in Contai, 180 km from Calcutta, came upon an infant in a cloth bundle hanging from the spikes of the gates of Rakhal Chandra Das Memorial School this morning.

 Inside the bundle lay a baby girl and a message scrawled on a piece of paper. The baby is one-and-a-half months old and yet to receive inoculations. She is used to baby food. Driven by poverty, we were forced to abandon the child, the note read.

 The sweepers said they found a baby-food tin inside the bundle but could not identify the brand.

 Kajal Rani Das, councillor of Contai municipalitys ward 18, said conservancy employee Chandan Sur spotted the infant first. She added that the baby had been placed at the gate with great care. They took care to hang the bundle high from the spikes of the gate so that it was not attacked by dogs or jackals, Das said.

 Sur took the baby to his house and is tending to it along with wife Anjali.

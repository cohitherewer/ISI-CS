 Calcutta, Nov. 5: The chief minister told his CPM bosses today that Humayun Kabir, who had arrested the notorious Dilip Banerjee, was pulled out of the probe following reports suggesting that he had adopted ?unethical means? in investigating crimes.

 At a lengthy CPM state secretariat meeting, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee mentioned Kabir?s role in arresting Avtar Singh, whose Merlin Park hotel was raided on August 15 during the hunt for hatkata Dilip. 

 ?I have reason to believe neither Singh nor his wife Jyotirmoyee Sikdar (a CPM MP) was present at Merlin Park Hotel at the time of the raid,? secretariat sources quoted the chief minister as saying.

 ?Kabir telephoned the Singhs and asked for the hotelier. When Jyotirmoyee said he was having a bath, Kabir told her to tell Singh that he must come over to Merlin Park because (transport minister) Subhas Chakraborty was waiting for him,? Bhattacharjee said.

 Kabir, the Salt Lake subdivisional police officer, was shifted to a low-profile post days after Dilip?s arrest.

 ?An investigator shouldn?t take resort to brazen lies while working on a sensitive case,? Bhattacharjee said.

 Kabir had raided the hotel in search of Dilip. After drawing a blank, he arrested Singh on the charge of running a sleaze racket. The arrest of the Lok Sabha member?s husband had rocked the CPM.

 Jyoti Basu and other secretariat members today expressed concern about the popular feeling that Kabir?s transfer was programmed by the party.

 Kabir, the chief minister said, had violated ?sacred? norms by letting select reporters sit through Dilip?s interrogation minutes after his arrest from East Bengal footballer Sasthi Duley?s house at Haripal, Hooghly.

 BRIEFS

 Burdwan, Sept. 12: Shantinath Chatterjee, one of the five ration dealers charged with theft of rice meant for mid-day meals in primary schools in Ausgram, committed suicide today.

 Chatterjee, who jumped in front of a train 150 km from Calcutta, left behind a suicide note accusing local CPM members of demanding money to ?settle matters? with police. The police said the note also mentions that the party workers had threatened him with dire consequences if he did not pay up. 

 The CPM has expelled Shyamal Banerjee and Umai Bagdi for their involvement in the meal scam. The police had to open fire last Friday to disperse villagers protesting against the pilferage. 

 Chinsurah: The CPM youth wing, DYFI, will meet the chief minister tomorrow demanding the closure of online lottery counters. ?We want these gambling stations shut to save our youths,? state DYFI president Abdul Hai said here.

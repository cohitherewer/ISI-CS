 Safety dos amp; don?ts for CPM cadre

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Midnapore, Oct. 21: The CPM has reeled out instructions for party leaders and cadre in areas of West Midnapore infested by the Communist Party of India (Maoist), in the wake of last week?s mine blast that killed five Eastern Frontier Rifles jawans.

 ?We have issued the instructions in view of last week?s landmine blast. We also have information that the People?s War-Maoist Communist Centre guerrillas have targeted our comrades. So we have taken some steps and asked our members to be alert,? said Dahareswar Sen, a CPM district secretariat member.

 CPM insiders said that after the October 14 blast at Bankshol in Lalgarh, 200 km from Calcutta, party workers have been asked not to venture out alone, particularly at night.

 ?If there is a knock on the door and an unknown person calls any party member at night, he should not open the door. We have also asked our members to go out of their locality in groups,? said a senior party leader.

 Sen said eight key party workers had been killed by Naxalites in the last four years. ?We cannot sit idle fearing an onslaught from them. Instead, we have decided to fight them tooth and nail so that such things do not recur,? he said.

 Five months ago, Bhola Sarkar of the CPM was allegedly murdered by People?s War activists about 6 km from the place where the landmines had exploded last week.

 The West Midnapore superintendent of police, Vineet Goyel, said the Naxalites had prepared a hit-list of key CPM leaders but denied knowledge of who figure in it. ?We have come to know that the rebels have prepared a list, but do not know the names of those who figure in it,? he said.

 The police superintendent said investigation had revealed that those involved in the October 14 blast had assembled in the forest much in advance. Intelligence sources said a group of rebels had taken shelter at Sijua forest on October 3.

 ?During investigation, the police recovered some burnt pieces of wood from the area. This is clear evidence that the Naxalites had cooked food during their short stay in the forest,? said the police official.

 Anuj Panday, the CPM secretary of the Dharampur local committee, said a group of seven Naxalites had abducted party member Laloo Shabar last month and had taken him to the forest to extract information about CPM leaders.

 Intelligence officials confirmed that the extremists had taken Shabar hostage on September 29 to find out if CPM leaders were rough in their behaviour towards poor villagers.

 ?They also wanted to know from the CPM member if villagers were being provided with wheat, rice and other essential items under various central government schemes,? the sleuths said.

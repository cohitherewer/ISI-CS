 Stop cribbing, CM tells north

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Cooch Behar, Nov. 21: The chief minister today asked the people of north Bengal to stop accusing Writers? Buildings of not doing enough for the development of the region.

 Digressing from his speech at the open rally of the All Bengal Teachers? Association conference, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee called upon the region?s teachers, intellectuals, ministers and politicians (Forward Bloc leader Kamal Guha from Dinhata is a CPM-basher) to ?stop cribbing? and look at the developments.

 ?This blame game has to stop. There are so many things happening in these six districts of north Bengal. We have investments coming in, proposals are lined up and we are mobilising funds to implement them. There should be no reason to think that the state first looks south and then to the north,? he said.

 ?There is a lot of development in the food processing sector. We are setting up cold storages to ensure that cultivators of vegetables, fruits and flowers get the right price,? Bhattacharjee said.

 He said investments had come in the form of the Dabur fruit processing plant in Jalpaiguri. ?A large plastic unit is coming up at the industrial area here as a downstream project of Haldia Petrochemicals. We are holding talks with Delhi on the opening of the Mainaguri-Jogikhopa railway line that will facilitate freight movement. Talks are also through with the civil aviation ministry for the re-introduction of flights from here and the airfield will be refurbished,? Bhattacharjee told the gathering.

 He said the aviation ministry has agreed to permit a 52-seater turbo-prop aircraft, like the Fokker Friendship, to take off from and land here.

 The chief minister also mentioned that the environment department is being approached to find better ways to mine dolomite, which could be a major revenue earner in the region. ?There are problems and there are ways out, too,? he said.

 Bhattacharjee said the North Bengal Development Council might also be strengthened to monitor the development. ?But first, politicians and ministers from the region will have to change their mindset.?

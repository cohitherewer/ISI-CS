 BRIEFS

 Barasat, Dec. 30: Banamali Mukherjee, 49, a constable at Bagda police station in North 24-Parganas, committed suicide last night by hanging himself at the police lines at Banamalipur here. 

 Members of the Non Gazetted Police Karmachari Samity complained to district superintendent Praveen Kumar that the high-handedness of a colleague was behind the death. They said Banamali was being harassed since a woman lodged a complaint with subdivisional police officer Subhankar Chatterjee that she was abused by the constable. Chatterjee denied he had tortured Banamali. 

 Phuleswar, Howrah: The foundation stone of a 100-bed hospital, Sanjiban, was laid at Baikunthapur here. The Rs 4.5-crore hospital is being set up by a group of 22 NRI doctors. 

 Calcutta: Thirty-three persons were hurt when their bus overturned on the Panagarh-Moregram highway near Suri LC College in Birbhum around 6.45 pm. The bus, carrying students from a Durgapur school and their parents, was returning from Tarapith.

 HC focus on false report trio 

 OUR BUREAU 

 Calcutta, Dec. 17: The 

 high court today asked the government to furnish an affidavit 

 stating what steps it had taken against a magistrate, a 

 doctor and a police officer at Kakdwip, who submitted a 

 false post-mortem report. 

 The report had said that Mousumi Ari, an 18-year-old housewife at Kakdwip, South 24-Parganas, about 70 km from here, had a natural death. Residents of Tritya Bheri village had found her dead on October 25, 2003. 

 Her father Swadesh Saw, however, was not convinced and instead of performing the last rites, buried the body in the courtyard of his house. The body was covered with 70 kg of salt so that the decaying could be delayed. 

 Swadesh then went door to door to rally opinion in favour of a re-examination of the body. Responding to the appeals, two organisations came forward. 

 Today?s order followed a public interest litigation moved by the Manabadhikar Suraksha Mancha demanding court intervention.

 Earlier, following a long campaign, the executive magistrate of Diamond Harbour had ordered a second post-mortem. The body was exhumed on December 20 last year. The second report says there were injury marks on it. 

 Appearing for the Mancha, Sadhan Roy Chowdhury told a division bench presided by acting Chief Justice A.. Roy that magistrate Deepak Kanungo, Dr Gauranga Biswas and Kakdwip police station officer-in-charge Debasish Chakraborty, who were responsible for the false documents, were still in service. 

 Being told that the ?government had not taken any action against the officers?, the court asked Writers? Buildings to respond in writing.

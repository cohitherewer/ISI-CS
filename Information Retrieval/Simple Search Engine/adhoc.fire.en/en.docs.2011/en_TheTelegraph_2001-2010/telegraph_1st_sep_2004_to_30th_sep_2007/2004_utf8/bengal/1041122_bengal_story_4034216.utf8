 CPM ?link? to pilfering

 Burdwan, Nov. 21: The CPM leadership here is worried over growing resentment among the poor against ration dealers enjoying party favour. 

 These dealers are allegedly not distributing rice and other ration items, which are part of central poverty alleviation schemes like the Annapurna and Antyodaya Yojnas. 

 Many of these dealers, close to the CPM, are selling foodgrain meant for below poverty line people. A section of the party feels these dealers also enjoy police protection. 

 The superintendent of police recently imposed a ban on demonstrations against the ration dealers to cap a tendency towards violent protests. 

 In a pointer to divided opinion within the party, CPM district secretary Amal Haldar supported the ban on protests. A leader who did not want to be named opposed him.

 Cong legislator blasts MP

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

Kandi, Oct. 2: The infighting within the Congress 

in Murshidabad came to the fore today with the six-time MLA from Kandi, Atish 

Sinha, lashing out at the district leadership for ?sidelining? him in the party.

 Congress leaders said Sinha had targeted the party?s MP from Behrampore, Adhir Chowdhury, who is also the district party president.

 The immediate provocation for Sinha?s outburst is the forthcoming election to the managing committee of the Manindra Chandra Girls? School of which Sinha was appointed secretary.

 ?Enough is enough. There is a concerted effort to remove me from the post of secretary in the institution. But I am sentimentally attached to the institution as my grandfather was the brains behind it,? the legislator asserted this afternoon.

 The veteran Congress leader alleged today that eight months ago he was removed from the post of secretary at the Kandi Raj School where an election to the managing committee was held.

 Debashish Chatterjee, the then president of the Kandi unit of the Congress who is close to Chowdhury, was appointed secretary he said.

 ?This is nothing but a pre-planned attempt to sideline me and my men in the organisation. I am very much involved in building the party?s organisation in the district. But I shall not sit idle if attempts are made to malign me,? warned the legislator.

 Congress sources said Sinha had locked horns with the leadership four years ago when Chowdhury replaced him as the district president. Chowdhury loyalists even heckled Sinha when he was removed from the post.

 The MLA said he would not take up the matter with the state Congress committee. Party sources in Calcutta, however, said Sinha has informed state Congress president Pranab Mukherjee about the manner in which he is being ?humiliated? in the party.

 A senior Congress leader said the party would shortly seek a report from the district on the basis of Sinha?s complaints. ?Sinha is a senior leader and any attempt to show disrespect to him will be firmly dealt with,? he said.

 Chowdhury, when contacted at his Behrampore residence, refused to be dragged into the controversy.

 Axe on work order after Priya steps in

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Malda, Oct. 29: Buckling under pressure from the administration, the zilla parishad today cancelled the work order of Rs 1.5 crore granted for 34 projects under the Swarna Jayanti Gram Rozgar Yojana. 

 The cancellation order, issued by the executive engineer of the parishad, Rupak Mandal, comes days after Union water resources minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi told the district magistrate to probe how the work was assigned without tenders being floated. 

 The Congress, the party the minister belongs to, runs the parishad. Work order worth Rs 1.5 crore was allegedly given to contractors on October 19, a day before the puja holidays began. 

 Das Munshi, who is the MP from Raiganj, is an ex-officio member of the parishad. 

 District magistrate Ashok Bala, who had earlier maintained that his officers were kept in the dark by the parishad, refused to go into details of the cancellation order. 

 ?I had not issued the work order. Nor did I cancel it. The order has been cancelled by the person who had issued it, as there are some irregularities. I have submitted a detailed report to the government.?

 The zilla parishad sabhadhipati, Gautam Chakraborty, said the district would suffer because of the order. 

 ?I still cannot understand where the fault lies. I have asked the executive engineer to explain why the work order has been cancelled. But if we cannot utilise the funds sanctioned under the Swarna Jayanti Rojgar Yojana, we will not secure the sanction for the second instalment. As a result, Malda district will suffer,? he said.

 Chakraborty pointed out that had the money been spent within the stipulated time, the parishad would have got Rs 4 crore in the next instalment. 

 Claiming that Malda district never got the second instalment because it always failed to meet targets, Chakraborty said: ?There was a possibility that we would get the money this time. But the chances are slim after today?s decision.? 

 Das Munshi said he was happy with the decision. 

 ?I am happy that I could stop an illegal act by bringing it to the notice of the district magistrate. But I am always in favour of development. I have asked the district magistrate to ensure the implementation of the work by floating fresh tenders,? he said.

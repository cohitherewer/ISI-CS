 Siliguri set to get a smart hotel

 ANURADHA SHARMA LAKHOTIA

 Siliguri, Sept. 12: The business hub of north Bengal, which doubles as the gateway to the Northeast, is set to house a ?smart basic? hotel aimed as much at the business traveller as the tourist looking for luxury within a budget. 

 The indiOne chain, operated by a subsidiary of Indian Hotels Ltd, which owns the Taj group, is likely to choose one of four proposed locations in the town by September 20. 

 Rajeev Mahindroo, senior manager, business development, of indiOne saw the proposed sites and met tour operators here on Friday to assess the project?s prospects.

 The chief executive officer of Siliguri Jalpaiguri Development Authority, Rajesh Pandey, said: ?The indiOne chain comprises four-star hotels that cater to budget-class corporates and tourists, with room rates not exceeding Rs 1,000 per night.?

 Siliguri is one of four destinations in the state where smart basic hotels are set to come up. ?IndiOne has started one in Bangalore. In Bengal, they have also chosen Haldia, Durgapur and Calcutta,? Pandey said.

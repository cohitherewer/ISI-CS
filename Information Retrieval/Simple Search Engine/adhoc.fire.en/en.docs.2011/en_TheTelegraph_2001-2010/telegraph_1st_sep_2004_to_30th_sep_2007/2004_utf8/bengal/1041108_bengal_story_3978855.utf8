 Citu appeased, factory opens

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Burdwan, Nov. 7: After over a month, Bharat Aluminium Works in Katwa opened today as the management bowed to a Citu diktat to reinduct an axed leader.

 Keshab Bala, the secretary of the Citu-affiliated workers? union at the factory, 170 km from Calcutta, was sacked along with a woman employee for indecent behaviour last month. The CPM?s labour arm then forced the factory shut.

 A Citu district committee member and secretary of the CPM?s Katwa zonal committee, Anjan Chatterjee, today bragged that the factory was allowed to open after the owner accepted the union?s demand. 

 ?It was our demand that Keshab and the other employee be reinstated before the factory reopens. Whatever the employees may have done, we will not accept the sacking. We will find out whether they were at fault at our next subdivisional meeting. The owner of the factory can sit with us if he wants to,? he added.

 The harassed factory owner, Asim Saha, said he was forced to accept the Citu?s condition keeping in mind the interest of the employees. ?I was compelled to reinstate the two employees because I did not want others to suffer. I have informed the subdivisional officer about it,? he said.

 Over the past few years, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has been requesting the union not to foment trouble in factories. But Bharat Aluminium proves that his plea has had little effect.

 The trouble there started on October 1 after Bala was ?caught in a compromising position? with the woman employee. At a meeting the next day, attended by 32 out of 45 employees, it was decided that the two would be dismissed. 

 But the day after, Bala came armed with ?outsiders? and allegedly beat up some of the witnesses who deposed against him. Saha was forced to shut down fearing an escalation of the violence.

 On November 3, the Citu foiled an attempt to reopen the factory, saying the sacked employees had to be taken back.

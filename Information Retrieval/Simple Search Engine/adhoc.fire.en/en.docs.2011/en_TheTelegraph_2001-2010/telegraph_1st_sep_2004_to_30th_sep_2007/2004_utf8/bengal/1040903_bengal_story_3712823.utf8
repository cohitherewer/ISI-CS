 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 2: Officials of the joint sector Bengal Shristi Infrastructure Development Limited met Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee yesterday and presented a master plan for a 90-acre integrated township in Asansol.

 The Rs 350-crore project, in collaboration with Singapore-based SembCorp, will provide housing for about 7,000 families.

 The township in Asansol will be unique and the first of its kind being set up in India, said Hemant Kanoria, director of Bengal Shristi. The integrated township envisages a unique mixture of plots, houses and group housing structures.

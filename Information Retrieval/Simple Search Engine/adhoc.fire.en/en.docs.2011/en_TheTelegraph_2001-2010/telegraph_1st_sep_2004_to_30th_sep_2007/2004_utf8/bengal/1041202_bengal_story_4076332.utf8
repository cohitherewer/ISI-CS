 Krishnagar: Rupali Mondal allegedly committed suicide on Tuesday night after a shalishi (conciliation) meeting called by the panchayat upheld a demand of Rs 10,000 by her in-laws. At Dohorbuicha village in Hanskhali, 70 km from Calcutta, Rupali, 22, who was pregnant, hanged herself. Her husband Jadu, who works in Dubai and was on a holiday, has been arrested. His parents Shyamacharan and Basana and sister Usha Sarkar have also been picked up following a complaint lodged by Rupali?s father Kiran Roy. Police said there were injury marks on her body. The in-laws had been pressing her for Rs 10,000 for the past year. When she refused, they prevented her from visiting her father. ?Jadu told his wife he would give up his job and start a business and so he needed the money,? said additional superintendent of police Biswarup Ghosh.

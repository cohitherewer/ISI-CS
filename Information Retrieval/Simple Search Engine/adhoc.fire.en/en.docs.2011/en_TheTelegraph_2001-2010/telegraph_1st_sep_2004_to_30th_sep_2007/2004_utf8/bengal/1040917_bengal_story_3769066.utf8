 BRIEFS

 Barrackpore, Sept. 16: Policemen who were reluctant yesterday to register a rape case against the expelled CPM branch committee member, Adhir Acharya, did so today. 

 The father of the alleged 13-year-old victim, Kalachand Chatterjee, today moved the subdivisional judicial magistrate?s court with the complaint that the police were not recording the rape charge. But before the court gave an order, North 24-Parganas police chief Parveen Kumar instructed Ghola police station to record the complaint. 

 When Chatterjee first went to the police station, 20 km from Calcutta, he was allegedly slapped and asked to go for a conciliation. His girl used to go to Acharya?s house to take tuition. 

 Calcutta: Incessant rain has led to flooding of vast areas in Nadia and North 24-Parganas, rendering thousands homeless. In North 24-Parganas, the Ichhamati flooded Bongaon and Bagda. Parts of Simultala, Motiganj, Sindrani, Chargaht and Gaighata are also under water. In Nadia, Hanskhali and Krishnagunj were the worst hit.

 Calcutta: High tide prevented an Indian Airlines plane from landing at Port Blair on Thursday morning. An airline spokesman said the flight from Calcutta came back to the city after hovering over the islands for some time. All the 81 stranded passengers will be flown tomorrow.

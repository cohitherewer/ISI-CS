 BSF boss drugged on train and looted 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Sept. 24: A BSF deputy inspector-general was apparently drugged and looted on Kalka Mail on his way from Delhi on Wednesday.

 The DIG of the BSF?s Krishnagar sector, R.C. Saxena, was with his wife Vijaya and a relative when he was robbed of his briefcase, which had his cellphone, bank passbook, I-card, money, some official papers and his wife?s jewellery. 

 In the AC sleeper coach, Saxena was served dinner by the railway?s catering employees at Mughalsarai station. ?We took the food from the railway canteen boys around 10 pm. Everything was fine but the curd did not taste as usual. My wife nodded disapprovingly but I told her railway food can?t be bad,? Saxena said.

 Minutes later, the three of them dozed off. ?We do not remember anything after that,? he added.

 Saxena woke up around 1.45 am on Thursday and saw the others still sleeping. ?My briefcase was missing.? When the train reached Howrah, he lodged a complaint with the Government Railway Police.

 The briefcase was later found in a corner of Mughalsarai station. It had a number lock but not the combination that Saxena used. When prised open, there was nothing inside. A railway official said: ?We are probing whether Saxena had placed the order for food with the railway?s own caterers or outsiders.?

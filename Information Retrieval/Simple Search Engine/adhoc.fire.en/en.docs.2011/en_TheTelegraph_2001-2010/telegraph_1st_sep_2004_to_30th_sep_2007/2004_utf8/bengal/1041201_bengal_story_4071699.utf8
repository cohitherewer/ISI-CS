 Tales of grit lost in ?protest? 

 - A disability difficult to overcome

 Calcutta, Nov. 30: The challenged have never been so disabled by a situation beyond their control. 

 After fighting the odds for decades, some 40-plus disabled people who have been selected this year for their outstanding show of strength, are now wondering why a bandh had to come in the way of their celebrations. 

 On Friday, when the government felicitates them on the occasion of World Disabled Day, most would be without their near and dear ones or even without those with whom they would have loved to share their achievement. 

 With the Trianmul Congress threatening to assert its presence on December 3, even those from the city and its outskirts would struggle to make it to the venue. 

 The bravehearts who make it will be minus their parents, wives or children. Those from a distance would have to wait another 24 hours to return home and share the moment. 

 ?It?s a day we had been waiting for. We?d struggled to see our only son reach the heights despite shortcomings. It was tough? It would have been so nice had we both been there at the programme where he would be felicitated. But for the bandh,? lamented Bitan?s mother Mallika Goswami. 

 At 24, deaf-mute Bitan is among the state?s pick as a role model for this year. A resident of Narasingha Avenue in Nagerbazar, he is pursuing his masters in textile designing at the Government College of Arts and Crafts and has several exhibitions under his belt. 

 ?He cannot express himself in speech but has a very strong sixth sense. He would have loved to have his parents with him when getting rewarded. But it seems there is no way to make it on a bandh day?? said Mallika. 

 For the programme at Rambrahmo Sanyal Hall ? opposite the Zoological Gardens ? the social welfare department has decided to put up the awardees at several places in the city from the afternoon before. Two hotels on Surya Sen Street have been booked, besides separate arrangements at Taratolla and Scott Lane. The invitees have been asked to come with an ?escort?. 

 ?Provisions have been made for one. My brothers would miss out?? said Bholanath Dolui, a three-wheeler driver with one leg who worked tirelessly for his brothers? education. 

 K.S. Adhikari, the assistant commissioner of the department of disability, said: ?We are trying to make the necessary arrangements but even then there are problems. There is a pregnant woman, for instance, who cannot be put up in a hotel.?

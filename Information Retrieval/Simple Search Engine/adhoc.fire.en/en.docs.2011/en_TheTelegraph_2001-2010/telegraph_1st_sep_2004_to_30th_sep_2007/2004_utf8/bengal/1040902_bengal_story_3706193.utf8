 Cinema strike cloud blows over 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Sept. 1: Moved by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees appeal to shun strikes, city cinema hall owners today gave up their plan for an indefinite closure from the middle of the month in support of various demands, including a reduction in electricity charges. 

 Addressing a galaxy of industrialists in Mumbai recently, Bhattacharjee categorically said he was opposed to wildcat strikes and bandhs. He also spoke in favour of responsible trade unionism for the sake of the ongoing process of industrialisation in Bengal.

 Encouraged by the chief ministers observations on bandhs and strikes, we have decided to do away with the proposed indefinite strike. Instead, we have lined up a dharna on September 8 to realise our demands, Tapandeb Banerjee, chairman of the exhibitors section of the Eastern India Motion Pictures Association (EIMPA), said. 

 The chief minister, also in charge of cultural affairs, has already reduced the entertainment tax on Bengali movies. This has helped us thrive, Banerjee said.

 The decision was taken at an emergency meeting of the exhibitors section of EIMPA.

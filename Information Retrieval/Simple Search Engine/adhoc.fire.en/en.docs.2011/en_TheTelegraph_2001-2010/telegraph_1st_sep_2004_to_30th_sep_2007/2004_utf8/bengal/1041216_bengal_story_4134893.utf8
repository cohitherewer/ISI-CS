 Quiz draw at mela 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Santiniketan, Dec. 15: A quiz on Santiniketan is set to add novelty to this year?s Pous Mela, which will be held from December 23. 

 ?We plan to continue this quiz programme every year involving the audience,? said Visva-Bharati vice-chancellor Sujit Kumar Basu. Students from the university would perform at the mela, he added. 

 This year, the mela organising committee has invited six countries ? Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Japan, Sri Lanka and Myanmar ? to set up stalls to promote their culture and handicrafts. 

 As is the tradition, there will be a fireworks display on December 24. Though officially it is three-day affair, the mela, started in 1894 by Maharshi Debendranath Tagore, usually continues till January. 

 District police superintendent Akhil Roy said 200 policemen, including 50 officers, would be deployed at the fair.

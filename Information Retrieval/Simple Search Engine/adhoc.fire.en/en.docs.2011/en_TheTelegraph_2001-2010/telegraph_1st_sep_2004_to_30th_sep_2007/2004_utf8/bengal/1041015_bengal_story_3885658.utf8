 CU review deadline

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 14: The high court today asked Calcutta University to publish the review results of this year?s BA and BSc Part-II examinations by December 15.

 The directive followed a petition by an examinee from Ashutosh College, Ravi Shankar Sinha, challenging his BA Part-II results. 

 The judge set the deadline for the university when he came to know that it takes about a year to publish the final results of students who seek review of their answer scripts.

 Justice Jyotirmoy Bhattacharya, while giving the order, also observed that the university should take steps to expedite its procedures for publication of review results of undergraduate examinations.

 In his petition, Sinha complained that he was awarded unexpectedly poor marks ? six out of 100 ? in one of his papers in political science.

 After the university announced the results of the 2004 BA and BSc Part-II (general) examinations in August, Sinha applied last month for a re-evaluation of the political science paper.

 Noticing the inordinate delay on the part of the Calcutta University authorities to declare the review results, Sinha approached the court with a plea that his political science answer script, be produced at the court for re-examination.

 ?It takes nearly a year for Calcutta University to publish the review results,? Kallol Guhathakurta, the counsel for the petitioner, told the court.

 The court sought an explanation from the university and wanted to know how long it normally takes to declare the review results.

 The court set the deadline after the counsel for the university admitted that a long-drawn procedure is followed before the results are declared.

 Suranjan Das, the pro-vice chancellor, academic affairs, said the university had not received the court order till this evening. He added that measures had been taken to speed up the publication of the review results.

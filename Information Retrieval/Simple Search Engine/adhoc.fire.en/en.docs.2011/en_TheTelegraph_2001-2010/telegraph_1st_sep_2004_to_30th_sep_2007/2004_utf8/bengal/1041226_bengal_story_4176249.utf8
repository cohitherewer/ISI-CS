 Clinic in time of scarcity

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 25: Cancer patients and their families are struggling to cope with a morphine shortage in the city that has resulted in hospitals refusing to admit terminally ill patients or charging steeply for doing so. 

 There are about 60,000 terminally ill cancer patients across the state and about 40,000 die without any treatment in their last lap. 

 ?Even with the available facilities, the condition of these patients is sorry. And with morphine out of the market, things are really bad,? said Gautam Mukhopadhyay, a senior cancer specialist.

 But there is help at hand with a group of local onco-surgeons teaming up to open eastern India?s first palliative care unit. The Subodh Mitra Memorial Cancer Hospital, which opened in Salt Lake today, should provide relief to many.

 At the inauguration, excise minister Probodh Sinha said he would pressure the Centre to ensure the availability of morphine. 

 Subir Ganguly, a former head of Medical College?s radiology department, said the new hospital?s palliative care unit would have five beds initially, costing Rs 200 a day. 

 The hospital will also have a counselling unit for relatives to cope with the crisis in their family.

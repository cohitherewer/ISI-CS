 Priya prod to probe against Cong board 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Malda, Oct. 26: The zilla parishad has been caught on the wrong foot again.

 In July, barely a month after it was ordered to cancel ?illegally issued? tenders, the parishad had been hauled up for re-issuing the same tenders (worth Rs 60 lakh) illegally.

 Now, it is the turn of Priya Ranjan Das Munshi to turn on the heat. The Union water resources minister has asked the district magistrate to probe how the parishad assigned work under the Swarna Jayanti Gram Rozgar Yojna allegedly without floating tenders.

 The Congress, the party the minister belongs to, runs the parishad. 

 Jobs worth Rs 1.5 crore were allegedly assigned to a few contractors without tenders being floated on October 19, a day before the puja holidays began.

 It was too late when the matter became known as the contractors had already been issued orders to build roads in various blocks.

 The news reached the minister, who was holidaying at his Kaliaganj residence. He called up district magistrate Ashok Bala on Navami, but was ?shocked? to learn that the latter was ?not aware? of the developments. 

 A member of the parishad himself, Das Munshi asked Bala to probe the scam and take steps against the guilty. 

 ?I cannot remain silent and watch the taxpayers? money being looted. I wonder how the work, where such a big amount is involved, could be allotted without floating tenders,? Das Munshi told reporters here today.

 Zilla parishad sabhadhipati Gautam Chakraborty said: ?All I can say is that we did not flout norms.? 

 But the district Trinamul Congress, a key ally in the parishad board, has demanded a vigilance probe. 

 President of the party?s district unit and chairman of Englishbazar municipality Krishnendu Chowdhury today threatened to withdraw support to the board ?if things go this way?.

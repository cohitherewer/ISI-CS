 Sprinter still on interim bail 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Krishnagar, Dec. 8: A Ranaghat court today upheld interim bail to athlete Pinki Pramanik, but rejected an appeal for unconditional bail. 

 Subhendu Chatterjee, Pinki?s lawyer, said interim bail means she can be arrested again. The 17-year-old sprinter was arrested on November 23 after a one-shot pistol was found in her kit. 

 Acting sub-divisional judicial magistrate Suresh Viswakarma fixed the next date for hearing on December 22. Pinki was present at the court in Nadia, 70 km from Calcutta. 

 Assistant public prosecutor Prahllad Paul said Viswakarma, however, said Pinki would not have to report at Ranaghat police station every week. Moreover, he asked the police to return the cellphone and cash seized from her at the time of arrest. 

 Paul said the mobile phone and Rs 2,800 were returned after Ranaghat inspector-in-charge Chandan Banerjee submitted a no-objection letter to the court. 

 Pinki, who has accused five youths of teasing her and planting the gun in her bag at Habibpur station, said she has been staying with her parents at Bagmundi in Purulia since bail. 

 ?I could not attend the Commonwealth junior meet in Australia because of the incident. But I am looking forward to the coming national track and field meet and an international meet later this year,? she said.

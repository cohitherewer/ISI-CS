 Doctors? mobile ban in district hospitals 

 SUVRO ROY AND NARESH JANA

 Nov. 11: Alarmed at the flood of complaints against doctors busy talking on the mobile phone in operation theatres or while seeing patients, the government has issued a circular banning their use in OTs and intensive care units.

 The circular, issued earlier this week, is meant for doctors at non-medical college hospitals who practise in private and are allegedly busy on the phone trying to balance concerns. 

 Health officials said inquiries had revealed that general surgeons, cardiac surgeons, gynaecologists and cardiologists also attached to nursing homes had to entertain calls on their mobiles frequently.

 ?These calls often come in the middle of an operation or while a critical patient is being examined. So the health department decided to restrict the use of mobiles in the districts,? an official said.

 Hospital areas where use of mobiles has been banned also include the CT scan, ultrasonography and MRI units.

 The circular has already reached several districts. 

 Health officials said the decision was taken at a meeting on October 28 following complaints from patients and nurses, particularly from hospitals in the districts. 

 An official added that the problem is non-existent in the medical colleges across the state as the doctors there are non-practising and, moreover, a ban on mobiles in operation theatres and intensive care units already exists.

 Dilip Jha, the deputy superintendent of NRS Medical College and Hospital, said: ?We have enforced the ban on mobiles in operation theatres and ICUs. We had received complaints that calls during a surgery or in the ICU are a major distraction.? 

 The chief medical officers of North 24-Parganas and the Midnapores said they have already received the circular and sent copies to the hospitals.

 Calcutta, Dec. 22: Mamata Banerjee?s law violation programme today held up traffic in the central business district between noon and 5.30 pm. In a domino effect, the flow of vehicles was thrown out of gear across the metropolis. 

 Mamata lined up today?s ?peaceful? programme in protest against deteriorating law and order, the government?s move to introduce the shalishi bill and the Centre?s decision to hike fuel prices. 

 Police said nearly 10,000 Trinamul Congress supporters assembled at Rani Rashmoni Avenue to court arrest around 1 pm today. Mayor Subrata Mukherjee, a host of MLAs and members of the mayor-in-council were present. 

 Commissioner Prasun Mukherjee said the situation went out of control at the crossing of Bentinck Street and Lalbazar Street, when Trinamul workers deviated from the programme they had given the police. 

 Around 4 pm, a Trinamul procession suddenly veered down Bentinck Street. Another flank proceeded towards Lalbazar through Curzon Park. They started throwing stones at the policemen, prompting a lathicharge. Around 20 policemen were injured and around 1,100 protesters were arrested. 

 Around the same time, Mamata started encircling Writers? Buildings in a car with five police vehicles in tow. Stopping in the middle of a road, she told reporters: ?I am not violating any law as no law exists in Bengal. I have been circling the Assembly, governor?s house and Writers? Buildings to show my scorn for the law and order situation.?

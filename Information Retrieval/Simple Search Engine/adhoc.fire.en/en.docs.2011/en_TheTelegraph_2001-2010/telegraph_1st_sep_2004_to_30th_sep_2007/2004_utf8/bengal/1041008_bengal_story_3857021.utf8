 CM talks tough, not on Centre

 Durgapur, Oct. 7: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today blamed Mamata Banerjee?s Trinamul Congress and the state Congress for Bengal?s poor development, but refrained from making any sharp remark on the Congress-led government at the Centre.

 At a state conference of the Democratic Youth Federation of India, the CPM?s youth arm, the chief minister said the ?Bengal package? drawn up by Mamata when she was Union minister did not have an eye on ground realities. ?We don?t believe in things like Bengal package..,? he said, adding factories in Bengal were shut down during the tenures of both A.B. Vajpayee and P.V. Narasimha Rao.

 Bhattacharjee said he has told Prime Minister Manmohan Singh ?a lot of injustice was done to Bengal in the past? and the Centre must now ?redeem? itself.

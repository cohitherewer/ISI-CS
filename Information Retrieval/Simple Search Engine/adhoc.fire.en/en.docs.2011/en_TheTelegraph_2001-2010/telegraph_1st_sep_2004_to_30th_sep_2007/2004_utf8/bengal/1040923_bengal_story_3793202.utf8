 Citu union stalls Ganga plan

 Burdwan, Sept. 22: Progress in the Ganga Action Plan at Katwa has been dammed and fingers are being pointed at Citu, the labour arm of the CPM. 

 The construction of a sewage treatment plant on 13 acres of government land earmarked for the project has been held up as the Citu-controlled Mahakuma Bidi Shramik Union has built its office on one acre. It claims to have purchased the land. 

 Rabindranath Chatterjee, chairman of the Congress-controlled Katwa municipality, accused the union of encroaching on the vested land at Kathgola in ward 9 near the banks of the Bhagirathi.

 ?They have forcibly occupied the land and has constructed a building without our permission. We require 13 acres to set up the plant and the union is occupying one acre. So, we can?t use it. We have repeatedly served them notices, asking them to vacate the land but they have not paid any heed,? said Chatterjee. 

 Chatterjee, also an MLA, said the municipality had identified another 13-acre plot for the project. ?But the government did not provide the necessary funds. So, we don?t know how we can meet the deadline of setting up the plant,? he added. 

 The Centre provided Rs 1 crore in July for setting up the plant, which would treat all the sewage of Katwa town before it flows into the Bhagirathi, by December 31, 2005. 

 Anjan Chatterjee, the secretary of the CPM?s Katwa zonal committee and a district secretariat member of the Citu, said the Congress-led municipality was playing politics. ?We have purchased the land and so there is no question of returning it,? he said. 

 The executive engineer of the public health department, the agency that will implement the plant project, has visited the site to study the prospect of beginning work. In a report (memo no. 958/3) on August 24 this year, he said: ?Requisite land in connection with this project has not yet been received from Katwa Municipality though they assured us?. In the meantime, the second quarter of the financial year is on the verge of completion without any output.? 

 Officials said the treatment plant is part of phase-II of the Ganga Action Plan. Katwa municipality was included in the Plan in 1996 and the Centre sanctioned Rs 5 crore to be distributed in three phases. 

 The first instalment of Rs 50 lakh was spent on cleaning up the banks of the Bhagirathi and constructing crematoriums and bathing ghats.

 Man kills wife, child

 Chinsurah, Dec. 4: Police arrested Mathur Mandal, 40, last night from Mukundapukur for killing his wife and 11-year-old daughter.

 Mathur?s younger daughter, Samapti, raised an alarm when she saw her father hitting her mother with a brick around 1 am, police said.

 The eight-year-old told the police she was sleeping on a cot while her mother and elder sister, Aparajita, were sleeping on the floor. Mathur was in another room at their home in Goghat police station area 100 km from Calcutta.

 ?I saw my father hitting my mother with a brick and she began to bleed profusely. I opened the window and raised an alarm,? the child said.

 ?Some of our neighbours heard my cries for help and came to our house. My father also attacked our neighbours with the same brick with which he had hit my mother,? Samapti said.

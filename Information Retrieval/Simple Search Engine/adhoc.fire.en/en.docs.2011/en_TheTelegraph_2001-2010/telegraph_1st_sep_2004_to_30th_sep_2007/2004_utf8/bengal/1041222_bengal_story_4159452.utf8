 Man kills protester daughter 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Dec. 21: A former army jawan burned his 10-year-old daughter to death at Nadia?s Haringhata, about 50 km from Calcutta, early this morning. 

 Sukumar Mondal was arrested for murdering Suchandra, Mou to her family and friends. Mondal allegedly tortured his wife Manorama, a health worker, regularly as he wanted to divorce her to marry someone else. Mou, a Class V student, used to protest against his violence.

 Police said Mondal awoke Suchandra around 4 am today and took her outside. ?Probably intoxicated, Mondal sprinkled kerosene on his daughter and threw a lighted match stick? As the little girl?s dress went up in flames, a heartless Sukumar returned home and slept on the same cot as his wife and their seven-year-old son, Suvro,? an officer said.

 When neighbours, attracted by Mou?s cries, rushed out, Sukumar, who feigned ignorance, took his daughter to various hospitals. She was declared dead on arrival at the army hospital.

 Boy pushed off train

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Purulia, Sept. 27: An overzealous Railway Protection Force constable allegedly pushed 10-year-old Robi Bihari off a moving train this morning because he was not supposed to be there. 

 Four days ago, the Adra division of South-Eastern Railway ? to which the constable belongs ? had inaugurated a helpline for women and children.

 Around 9 am, moments after the Tata-Chhapra Express had left Adra station, Robi began sweeping the compartment. He said later the policeman shouted at him for being where he was but the train was moving and there was little he could do. 

 The constable, whom the railway could not identify till late tonight, then allegedly pulled him to the door and pushed him off the train. 

 Robi?s elder brother, Panchamangal, who was standing at the door of the next compartment, saw him fall and jumped off the train. Fortuitously, Robi escaped with injuries on his leg. There were two gashes on his right leg, which bore the impact of his fall. His brother was unhurt.

 When the train left the station, railway employees heard Robi crying in pain. He was given first-aid at the platform and then taken to the Adra railway hospital, where he had to be given stitches. 

 The officer-in-charge of the RPF?s Adra post, Sukhendu Bikas Sen, said he had heard about the incident. ?We will conduct an inquiry and identify the RPF constables on duty on the train. If anyone is found guilty, action will be taken,? he added. ?We will take care of the medical expenses till the boy recovers,? said the officer.

 About 50 boys and girls aged between seven and 14 operate from Adra station, sweeping the compartments of all passenger and express trains in exchange for alms and food. They mostly take free rides to the next station and return by another train. 

 The helpline was created on the occasion of the RPF Adra division?s raising day. The force had promised help at hand for women and child passengers who were asked to dial up either of two numbers ? 03251-244919 or 82808.

 Rights panel punch on ?oasis of peace?

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR

 Calcutta, Dec. 14: The state government has come under attack from the Asian Human Rights Commission, which tabled its report on atrocities in Asia to the United Nations Human Rights Commission a few days ago.

 From prison deaths and lawlessness to starvation and delayed justice, the maladies highlighted in the panel?s India report hover around Bengal, an ?oasis of peace? according to Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.

 The report points out an attack on a man and his two-year-old daughter in Behrampore for daring to raise his voice against atrocities by civic officials. 

 The report says: ?Anal Abedin and his two-year-old daughter were attacked in their house around midnight on November 12 for speaking about the misdeeds of a former municipal chairman, who led the attack.? 

 The Asian commission has criticised the police for promising an inquiry and doing nothing. ?The chief of police stated that they were inquiring into the incident and would take necessary action? the same old bluff??

 The commission?s report on India starts with the death of Abhijnan Basu, 40, who was allegedly burnt to death inside Presidency jail on November 12. The report says: ?Abhijnan Basu was doused with diesel fuel and set on fire by officers of the Presidency jail? the reason: he had dared to protest the quality and quantity of food the prisoners were being provided.? 

 The state government has denied the involvement of any jail official in the death.

 The judiciary has not been spared in the report. ?There are many reasons for delays (in judgment) but among them is the failure of the state to commit resources to the overburdened system?From the lowest clerk to the court?s presiding officer, all are corrupt,? it says. The country, it adds, is setting records for delays in court proceedings with cases being fought for decades.

 Sometime next year, Union home ministry officials will be at the UN?s rights commission headquarters in Geneva to provide explanations for the allegations levelled. 

 In the report, Bengal also figures prominently regarding the Bellilious park eviction carried out by the Howrah Municipal Corporation last year. Over 7,000 people were evicted from the park.

 According to the report, since the eviction, ?at least six persons are known to have died of starvation or related illnesses. Large number of the survivors are now living in sub-human conditions near a municipal dumping ground and a train line.?

 State home secretary Amit Kiran Deb said declined comment on the report because he had not received a copy of it. ?I will comment only when I see it,? he said.

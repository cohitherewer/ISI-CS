 Calcutta, Nov. 15: Drop in at Rabindra Sarobar in the south or Deshabandhu Park in the north of the city any morning and the scene is much the same ? boys in loose khaki shorts and white shirts undergoing physical training.

 These are Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) cadre. There could be more like them in parks and grounds across the state, if plans to increase the number of morning shakhas materialise. 

 Desperate to consolidate its base in the state despite opposition from the ruling Left, the RSS plans to enlist school and college students in larger numbers. 

 The outfit has already opened over 400 new shakhas this year in addition to the 1,500 existing, state RSS chief Jyotirmoy Chakraborty said. ?We have decided to introduce more morning shakhas to woo students and even dropouts who attend night classes or go to coaching centres during the day. These young people cannot attend afternoon shakhas,? Chakraborty said. 

 He also claimed that attendance at the daily shakhas has doubled over the past few months. 

 RSS chief K.S. Sudershan, who will be in the state in January after two years to see how the organisational machinery is working, will attend two meetings at Cooch Behar and Ulberia. 

 ?Measures to expand our base in the CPM-ruled state will top the agenda,? said Chakraborty.

 The Sangh outfit has also opened 40 primary schools in the districts under the banner of Saraswati Sishu Mandir. More than 150 such schools already exist. 

 ?We are concentrating on underdeveloped areas where children are being denied primary education. Attendance in our schools in Bankura, Purulia and other tribal-dominated districts is quite impressive,? the state RSS chief said.

 Alarmed at reports of the RSS? growth in some pockets, the CPM has sent circulars to its district units asking them not to lose sight of ?the impending danger?. 

 Veteran leader Jyoti Basu said: ?I have heard about the growing RSS activities in the state. This fascist force has to be firmly dealt with and our district leaders have been asked to discuss measures to combat it.?

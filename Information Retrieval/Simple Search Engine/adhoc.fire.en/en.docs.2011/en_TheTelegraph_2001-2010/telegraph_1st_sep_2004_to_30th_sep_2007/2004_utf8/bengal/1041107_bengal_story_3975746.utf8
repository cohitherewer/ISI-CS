 Trains collide

 OUR BUREAU

 Nov. 6: Fifty-five passengers were injured, six of them seriously, following a head-on collision between a Sealdah-bound passenger train and a goods train on the Ranaghat-Krishnanagar section today, according to railway officials.

 Government Railway Police officials, however, said 138 persons were injured but there was no report of any casualty.

 Preliminary investigations suggest the goods train disregarded the signal and hit the passenger train when the latter was entering the loop line in the single-line section around 11 am at Birnagar station of Sealdah division.

 The driver of the goods train, Kishan Munda, and his assistant, Antony Tudu, have been suspended, railway officials said. But Munda denied charges of human error and claimed that the breaks did not work, said sources.

 As the 106 down Lalgola-Sealdah passenger was entering Birnagar station, the goods train heading to Behrampore ? that was to wait at the outer signal of the station ? entered the loop line and approached the station from the opposite direction.

 Shiv Nath, the driver of the passenger train jumped out and raised an alarm. The station master also asked the passengers ? over microphone ? to jump out. ?Those who jumped on to the tracks received minor injuries,? an official said.

The impact of the collision was not much as both the 

trains were moving slowly, officials said.

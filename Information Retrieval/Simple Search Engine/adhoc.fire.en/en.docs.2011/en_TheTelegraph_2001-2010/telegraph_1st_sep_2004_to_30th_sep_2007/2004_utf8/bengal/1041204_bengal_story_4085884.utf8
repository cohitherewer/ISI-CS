 Rape cloud on neighbours 

 Barasat, Dec. 3: A mother of two was allegedly raped by two youths of her neighbourhood in North 24-Parganas early this morning. 

 The woman, who was dragged to a field in Gaighata, 70 km from Calcutta, is now at Bongaon Subdivisional Hospital. Superintendent of police Parveen Kumar said a search is on for Narayan Sarkar and Bishnupada Mondal on the basis of an FIR lodged by the woman?s husband. She lived alone with her two sons, aged five and eight, as her husband worked in a factory at Bongaon and came home for weekends.

 Ironically, a police outpost had been set up in the area four years ago after a gang-rape.

 CPM simmers in murder aftermath

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Chinsurah, Oct. 10: Fourteen 

 CPM supporters were arrested today in connection with yesterday?s 

 murder of Kazi Abdul Samad, 70, a party local committee 

 member, even as clashes erupted between rival factions.

 Hooghly superintendent of police Ajay Kumar said Samad was beaten with crowbars and his body pierced with spears by some CPM supporters at Koyrakhali village in Goghat, about 140 km from Calcutta.

 Local police said members of rival groups within the party fought a pitched battle this afternoon when Samad?s body was taken to the village. 

 Samad?s supporters clashed with a mob from neighbouring Uttar Sainthia village accusing Sheikh Jhikaria, a CPM leader, of masterminding the murder. 

 According to the police, at least 20 houses belonging to CPM supporters of rival groups were set ablaze during the clash in which arms were used in abundance. Over a dozen people were injured in the fighting. 

 Abhoy Ghosh, the secretary of the CPM?s Goghat-II zonal committee, alleged that Jhikaria had planned Samad?s murder in connivance with some Forward Bloc supporters. ?Police were spectators when Samad was murdered. I want an impartial probe,? he said.

 Ghosh warned of more clashes because of the CPM?s ongoing organisational polls preceding the state conference in February. 

 Party insiders alleged that two factions owing allegiance to Anil Basu, the CPM MP from Arambagh, were involved in the murder. 

 However, Basu refused to admit that the murder was the result of intra-party feud. ?It has nothing to do with inner party wrangles. Samad is a victim of an old dispute among rival groups in two villages,? he said.

 CPM sources said squabbles within were apparent a month ago when Basu locked horns with the CPM MP from Hooghly, Rupchand Pal, over the arrest of party members from Kodalia village in connection with a murder that took place four years ago.

 Following the arrest of four CPM members, including Kodalia panchayat pradhan Nikhil Pande, Pal and his supporters blocked GT Road for hours protesting police highhandedness. ?We shall go for a bigger movement if the police continue to harass our men,? he had warned.

 Basu had publicly resented Pal?s protest.

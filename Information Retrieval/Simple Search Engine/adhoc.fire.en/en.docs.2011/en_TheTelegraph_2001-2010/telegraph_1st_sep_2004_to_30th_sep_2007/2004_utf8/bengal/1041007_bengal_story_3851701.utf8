 Blood flows in robbery 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Purulia, Oct. 6: A gang 

 shot a jewellery shop owner last night during a raid on 

 his house but lost two members in retaliatory firing by 

 the goldsmith?s neighbours. 

 About 15 men carrying pipeguns and bombs broke into Parimal De?s house in an affluent neighbourhood at Borga village on the Purulia-Jharkhand border, about 300 km northwest of Calcutta, around 12.30 last night after snapping the telephone lines. 

 They cleaned out almirahs and cupboards, but met with resistance when they sought the keys to the safe. Angered, the dacoits shot De in the chest and he died on the spot. 

 ?They took away about Rs 4,000 in cash and a few grams of gold jewellery,? said superintendent of police R. Siva Kumar. This is the second robbery in the Joypur police station area in less than a month.

 When they were fleeing about 20 minutes later, neighbours, alerted by the commotion, fired from rooftops. ?Four families have licenced double-barrel .12 bore guns. One of the dacoits died on the spot. The others burst bombs and fled,? said Siva Kumar. 

 One of the members was seriously injured in the firing. The gang tried to drag him away, but he couldn?t make it. His body was found this morning about a kilometre away near Nagen Mor in Bokaro district in Jharkhand.

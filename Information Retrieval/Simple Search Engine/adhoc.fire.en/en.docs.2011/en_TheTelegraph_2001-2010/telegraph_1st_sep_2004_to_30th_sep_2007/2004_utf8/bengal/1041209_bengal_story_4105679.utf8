 Haldia, Dec. 8: Haldia port authorities have taken up a nearly Rs 500-crore project to set up a second basin and another lock gate to expand its cargo handling capacity. 

 ?The need to expand the port was felt with increased cargo handling. The port now handles 32 million tonnes of cargo every year and the quantity is increasing every year by 10 per cent,? said Basav Roy Chowdhury, the port manager. 

 The Haldia port, on the confluence of the Haldi and the Hooghly, became operational in 1977.

 Port officials said 20 per cent of the funds would be internally mobilised while the authorities will approach funding agencies like the Japan Bank for International Co-operation for the rest. About Rs 280 crore is needed to build the basin and the lock gate while another Rs 200 crore will be required to construct three berths. 

 The consul-general of Japan in Calcutta, who visited Haldia in the end of November, said the Japanese government was interested in investing in Haldia port. 

 Another Rs 100-crore project has been taken up to modernise the port. ?But only modernising the port will not serve the purpose of increasing cargo handling unless the new basin and the lock gate are set up,? an official said. 

 Experts from the Indian Port Association have started a technical feasibility study for the additions. The study is expected to be over by February and construction will be taken up thereafter. The second basin will come up at Bishnuram Chowk, close to the Haldia dock complex.

 The existing basin has 11 berths and construction of the 12th is on. Three more berths can be added to the basin, but it would make handling of increasing cargo difficult. 

 Officials also pointed out that large ships cannot enter the port and have to wait at the Sandheads from where smaller vessels ferry the cargo to the port. Once the new basin is constructed and new berths are set up, the number of small ships can be increased to move cargo to and from the Sandheads faster, thereby saving cost.

 Rehabilitation plea for cured lunatics 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Oct. 2: After five long years in a Gobra asylum, Subol Mullick went home last month with dreams of a new life. But hope died young. The 45-year-old was back at the institution within half an hour, after his family slammed the door on his face. 

 Come Monday, Subol and 124 others like him can begin to hope again because psychiatrists will take to the streets for the first time for them. 

 At the state-run Pavlov Mental Hospital, at least 80 inmates have been languishing for more than five to 10 years despite being certified fit. Another 45 are wasting away at the Lumbini Park facility. 

 ?All these patients are absolutely fit, but their families do not want to take them back. But we have decided to do something for these poor souls,? said R. Ghosh Roy, spokesman for the Indian Psychiatric Society (IPS). 

 As World Mental Health Day (October 10) draws closer, the psychiatrists have decided to draft a resolution on the 125 inmates who have nowhere to go and ask the government to do something about them.

 ?We will ask the government to rehabilitate them at a vacant government home in Behrampore, perhaps. Once they learn to earn their livelihood, they would not require family support,? Ghosh Roy said. 

 The campaign will take off on October 4, with two giant tableaux criss-crossing Calcutta to spread awareness among the people about the rights of the mentally-ill. 

 Around 1.30 pm, the doctors will meet at NRS Medical College and Hospital and march to Rani Rashmoni Avenue for a huge meeting. 

 On October 7, the doctors will organise a campaign inside the Pavlov and Lumbini facilities to tell the unfortunate inmates they are not alone. 

 Three days later, doctors, care-givers and officials of the mental health department will meet to draft a resolution for disowned patients. A decision will also be taken to admit all the wandering lunatics in mental hospitals. 

 Once a resolution is adopted, representatives from the IPS will meet government officials to persuade them to take the issue of rehabilitation seriously. 

 The campaign for better living conditions for the inmates in hospitals and rehabilitation will continue till November, when the IPS will launch a bigger movement until their demands are met.

 ?We will continue the campaign till the authorities sit up and take notice,? said P. Pal, a city psychiatrist. ?The government must ensure that these homeless but mentally fit persons are rehabilitated so that they have a future ahead of them.?

 Rule-break theory for Kabir transfer 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Humayun Kabir

 Calcutta, Nov. 3: In the end, it was finally the law, or rather the rulebook, that caught up with a policeman who was ?tending to become a law unto himself?. 

 The sudden transfer of Humayun 

 Kabir, the sub-divisional officer of Salt Lake, to a relatively 

 low-profile job in the intelligence department two days 

 after his ?sensational? arrest of hatkata Dilip may 

 not be entirely due to the feathers he had ruffled in the 

 CPM hierarchy, though it played a part.

 Police sources today said what tilted the balance against Kabir, already weighed down by open criticism from an influential section of the North 24-Parganas CPM unit, and triggered his sudden transfer was his penchant for controversial raids, keeping his superiors in the dark and in disregard of norms. 

 ?Invariably, these raids received wild publicity and, in the end, the concerned superintendent of police, who would be among the last to know of it, would be left holding the baby while a major controversy swirled all around him,? a police official said.

 In the latest instance, North 24-Parganas superintendent Parveen Kumar was kept in the dark till Dilip was behind bars. 

 Police officials pointed at other ?indiscretion? Kabir committed after Dilip?s arrest that irked his superiors, most notably, the presence of a journalist and a CPM leader from Rajarhat at different points of time while Dilip was being interrogated by Kabir.

 ?We were amazed to see a portion of the interrogation reproduced in a daily a day after Dilip?s arrest,? said an official connected with the probe. ?This violates the rules governing our service conduct.? 

 Officials pointed out that there have been several occasions when Kabir did not abide by norms. 

 In 2001, as a deputy superintendent of police in Howrah, Kabir carried out a ?politically explosive? raid in the Salt Lake stadium to ferret out criminals sheltered there. The then superintendent of police, Soumen Mitra, learnt about it only next morning. 

 Kabir was again accused of ?unethical practice? earlier this year, when Avtar Singh, the husband of CPM MP Jyotirmoyee Sikdar, was produced before photographers and detained for several hours at Bidhannagar (East) police station after a raid on his hotel before being arrested. 

 Officials said though Kabir is an honest officer, his ?unpredictable? behaviour has landed him in trouble. 

 ?Senior CPM leaders like Subhas Chakraborty, Amitava Nandy and Tarit Topdar were calling for his head, but that by itself would not force the administration?s hand. Ultimately, it seems it was procedural lapses and a desire to maintain discipline that led to the transfer,? said an official.

 Decibel damper on AIDS drive

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Dec. 2: The authorities of Shaktinagar District Hospital here woke up to the fact that an AIDS-prevention message was blaring out of loudspeakers on the premises after exasperated patients lodged a complaint today.

 Yesterday was World AIDS Day and an NGO had undertaken the three-day campaign, which left patients at the hospital, 85 km from Calcutta, desperate to plug their ears. Some of them today trooped into the superintendent?s room and urged him to stop the ?menace?. 

 The NGO, approved by the state AIDS society, was asked to wind up the campaign. 

 Hospital superintendent Nripati Roy said he asked it to pack up immediately after receiving complaints from the patients and some of the doctors. ?I gave them permission on condition that it would not affect work. I did not bargain for such a high-decibel campaign.?

 Keya Tarafdar, an NGO representative, said: ?How can we campaign minus loudspeakers? After all, we were not belting out Hindi film songs.?

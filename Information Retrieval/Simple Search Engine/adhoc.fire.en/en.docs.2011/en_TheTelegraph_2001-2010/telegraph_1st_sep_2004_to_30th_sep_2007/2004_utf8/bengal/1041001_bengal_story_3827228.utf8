 Durgapur, Sept. 30: The steel township went into a boil this morning after 13-year-old Puja Das was crushed by a speeding truck at Durgapur Thermal Power Station Colony. 

 The residents, mostly Central Industrial Security Force personnel and their families, went on a rampage soon after, incensed by the insensitive handling of the corpse by police. They attacked the colony outpost, injuring officer-in-charge J.. Biswas and two other policemen, and torching a Sumo on the premises. 

 Eight persons were arrested till this evening.

 Around 10.30 am, Puja, a Class VIII student of the Kendriya Vidyalaya, alighted from her schoolbus, along with two others, and was going home in the CISF barracks. 

 As they were crossing a road, a speeding truck loaded with ash hurtled towards them. Puja, daughter of a CISF cook, pushed seven-year-old Ambika Mondal out of the way, but could not jump to safety and was run over. Ambika sustained head injuries, but is safe. 

 As news of Puja?s death spread, about a thousand residents assembled at the spot. Soon the police arrived and dragged the body from under the wheels and dumped it inside a police vehicle. The seething crowd went berserk. 

 ?Is this the way to lift the body of a little girl who was killed just a few minutes ago? It was thrown into the police vehicle in front her sobbing parents. Police removed the body as if it were livestock,? said CPI councillor Sudipto Goon, who arrived after the mishap. 

 The mob attacked the policemen at the spot and then turned its ire on the outpost. A huge police contingent was rushed in from Ranigunj, Asansol and Jamuria police stations. Jawans of Rapid Action Force also reached to bring the situation under control. 

 The mob blocked the colony road for more than two hours and refused to hand over Puja?s body. The police had to resort to a lathicharge to disperse the people. 

 ?I have heard some CISF constables were involved. We will prepare a report and submit it to the deputy inspector-general of the CISF. I am surprised at the way a section of the CISF, which is known as a very disciplined force, acted,? said .K. Singh, Burdwan police superintendent.

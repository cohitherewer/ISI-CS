 Hunger hush-up

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Hariharpara, Nov. 7: The Murshidabad administration yesterday launched a damage control drive amid reports of alleged starvation deaths here, but relatives of the victims today alleged that they were being tutored to deny that hunger had claimed their kin. 

 Block development officer Avijit Bhattacharya visited Hariharpara, Choa and Gaznipur, about 225 km from Calcutta, with a video crew and interviewed the family members of those who died in the past two months. 

 The relatives of Lakshmanmal Paharia, Malati, Budhanmal Paharia and Niyati alleged that they were told before the interview to say in front of the camera that the deaths were due to illnesses, not starvation. ?The BDO told us ?don?t say your husband died of starvation?. He told me to say that my husband Lakshman died of illness,? said Malati. 

 Niyati?s experience with the BDO and his team was the same.

 District magistrate N. Manjunatha Prasad said he had asked Bhattacharya to visit the three villages with the video crew. ?We did not find any starvation deaths and we will send the recordings and a report to the government,? he added. 

 Additional district magistrate Nisith Kumar Das, who also visited the villages, indirectly admitted that there was hunger. ?We admit that the villagers who died were poverty-stricken.?

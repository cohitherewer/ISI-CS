 Molest slur on teacher

 Midnapore, Sept. 10: Guardians of pupils have locked classrooms of a madarsa at Mahishadal in East Midnapore and are demonstrating since Wednesday demanding the arrest of a teacher who allegedly molested a Class VI student.

 Mohammad Hasibul Rahman is absconding. The girl?s father, Sheikh Mustaque Ahmed, lodged a formal complaint with police today. 

 When the teacher of Atkina High Madarsa School, about 130 km from Calcutta, allegedly dragged the girl into an empty classroom, she thought he was about to punish her for laughing loudly in class.

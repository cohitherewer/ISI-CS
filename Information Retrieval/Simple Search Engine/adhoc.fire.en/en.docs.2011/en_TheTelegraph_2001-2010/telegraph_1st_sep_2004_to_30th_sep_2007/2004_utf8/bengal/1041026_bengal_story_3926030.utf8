 BRIEFS

 Krishnagar, Oct. 25: Refusing to buy the police version of what led to the suicide of Lakshmi Kar, a housewife, on Saturday, Ranaghat residents today set ablaze the furniture and belongings in her husband Sudeb?s house.

 The police had said Kar, 26, committed suicide as Subeb, a hawker in Ranaghat about 60 km from Calcutta, refused to buy her new clothes this Puja. The residents held Sudeb and his sister?s husband Manoranjan Debnath responsible for the death. Armed with rods and sticks, they also ransacked Debnath?s house. The residents alleged that Sudeb, who was arrested yesterday, used to force his wife to sleep with Debnath for money. 

 Calcutta: Murari Choudhury, a security guard at an under-construction building, was arrested from his Swinhoe Lane home on Monday night for allegedly raping a girl of 10. Police said the victim?s father, a rickshaw-puller, was hesitant to lodge a complaint against his neighbour. ?He was arrested after a medical test of the victim,? said DSP, crime, Soma Das. 

 Calcutta: Orissa agriculture minister Surendranath Naik said on Monday his state wanted to learn from Bengal?s farm policy. The minister met the state agriculture secretary.

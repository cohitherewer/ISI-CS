 Alert over rebel threat amp; rally

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Dec. 13: A day after alleged Naxalites circulated leaflets in Purulia threatening to blow up police stations, senior officials, including home secretary Amit Kiran Deb and director-general of police Shyamal Dutta, had several meetings with the chief minister at Writers? Buildings. 

 They also discussed police arrangements for the Naxalites? proposed rally at Shahid Minar on December 15. 

 Rebel leaders like Varavara Rao and Gadar from Andhra Pradesh are likely to address the meeting. Besides, key functionaries from the CPI (Maoist) ? formed by the merger of the People?s War Group and the Maoist Communist Centre ? will also be present. The new outfit has a considerable presence in Orissa and Jharkhand.

 The Naxalites, by official admission, are active in Purulia, Bankura and West Midnapore in Bengal.

 Yesterday, they dropped leaflets saying Purulia?s Jaipur, Bandwan and Jhalda police stations would be blown up.

 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today said he was not attaching any importance to the threat. Earlier, he had said the government was concerned about their ?activities? and increasing presence.

 That the government is worried about yesterday?s threat was evident from the police chief?s move to step up vigil in Purulia. ?We have an elaborate police bandobast in three police stations. Besides, all district police stations have been put on alert,? he said, minutes after a meeting with the chief minister.

 Senior Calcutta police officials, including commissioner Prasun Mukherjee, discussed arrangements for December 15. ?We have made all arrangements to ensure a peaceful rally,? said deputy commissioner of police, headquarters, Sanjoy Mukherjee.

 About 3,000 people are likely to participate in the rally and none of the banned Naxalite outfits are likely to be represented.

 The home secretary said the government is ?alert?. 

 Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim said a motion on the rise in militant activities across the state may be discussed in the winter session of the Assembly. He added: ?The violent activities of the Naxalites came up for discussion at an all-party meeting on December 10.?

 Relief for axed doctor

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 6: The high court has asked the West Bengal Medical Council to return the registration certificate of M. Kader, the former head of the department of surgery at Burdwan Medical College and Hospital who was accused of negligence and stripped off it for six months.

 The council suspended Kader last December and seized his certificate for negligence leading to the death of a patient who underwent a gall-bladder operation. The family members of the patient had lodged a complaint against Kader with the council. 

 The doctor told the court last week that even after six months, the council was not returning the certificate. 

 Asked to clarify the councils stand, lawyer Saibalendu Bhowmick told the court Kader had appealed against the councils order to the state health secretary. Until the case is disposed of by the health department, an appellate forum of the council, my client has no authority to hand over the certificate, Bhowmick said. 

 He also told the court that despite being attached to a government hospital, Kader had operated on the gall-bladder at a nursing home in North 24-Parganas. After hearing all the parties, the council had decided to suspend Kader for six months and confiscate his registration certificate.

 The court, however, ordered the council to return the certificate within a week.

 Kaders counsel Ekramul Bari told the court that the council had seized his certificate for six months only. The suspension period is already over. Now, the council has no right to hold back the registration certificate, Bari said.

 Welcoming the verdict, director of medical education Chittaranjan Maity said Kader would have to be reinstated in his previous position. He has served the term of punishment and should be returned to his department. However, it is up to the council chairman to decide.

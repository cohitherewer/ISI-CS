 CM goes to Centre over ore supply

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Nov. 18: The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government has taken up with the Centre the issue of iron-ore supply from Orissa for the proposed steel plant to be set up by the Jindal group at Kharagpur.

 The chief minister said this today while in Orissa for the seventh All-India Democratic Women?s Association conference.

 When asked about Orissa?s stand not to export iron ore unless the Jindals invested in the state, Bhattacharjee said he had not spoken to his Orissa counterpart, Naveen Patnaik, on the issue.

 ?It is in the interest of Bengal that we should work together. We should rise above petty politics and I think the problem will be resolved,? he said.

 Jindal Iron amp; Steel Co Ltd (Jisco) has proposed a 5-million-tonne steel plant in Bengal worth Rs 12,000 crore. But the company has made it clear this would be possible only if ore linkage is assured by the state government. Bengal has coal but not iron ore. 

 A final decision would take into account linkages with Orissa and Jharkhand, which together have 60 per cent of all the country?s iron-ore reserves.

 The Jindal management is believed to be negotiating with the governments of Orissa and Jharkhand for finalising the linkages. But both states are seeking value-addition in their own territories.

 Spoiler for lawyers? ceasework

 Krishnagar, Nov. 19: Government-empanelled lawyers in Nadia, who have been on strike since Wednesday, suffered a setback as the district public prosecutor today broke ranks and appeared in the Dr Chandan Sen murder trial.

 About 40 empanelled lawyers, who are on strike to protest against non-payment of dues, accused Sadhan Mondal of betraying them. 

 Lawyers in the government panel, who are hired by the state to fight its cases, are paid for each appearance. The district public prosecutor also gets a retainer. The strikers alleged that they have not got their fees for the past four years.

 ?He (Mondal) should not have appeared today. This is a serious setback to our cause,? said one of the striking lawyers, Subimal Sen.

 The lawyers did not attend a meeting called by additional district magistrate B.B. Biswas last evening. Mondal did. 

 Biswas pleaded with him to appear today. ?The case was important. We were under instructions to find a quick solution to the impasse,? he said.

 Several doctors are among the accused in the murder of Sen, a surgeon at Ranaghat Subdivisional Hospital found dead near a colleague?s house.

 Sen lands Milan MoU 

 MADHUMITA BHATTACHARYYA

 Milan, Sept. 30: A food- processing plant is the first fruit of the ministerial delegation that travelled from Calcutta to Italy. 

 A Rs 25-crore tomato and pineapple paste unit will be set up in north Bengal by Bengal Nestor?s Industries Ltd with Italian collaboration. 

 An MoU for the first factory of its kind in eastern India was signed between Bengal Nestor?s, the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC) and Fenco Spa, an Italian food processing major. Fenco will have an equity stake in the unit, expected to be operational within a year. 

 The deal was sealed after a meeting yesterday attended by industry minister Nirupam Sen, principal secretary Sabyasachi Sen, WBIDC managing director Gopal Krishna and Bengal Nestor?s managing director Prashant Jalan. 

 ?Fenco has also agreed to a deferred payment scheme by which we will only have to pay back the cost of the machinery over five years. It is also providing technical support,? said Jalan. 

 ?This was a good meeting with positive results,? said Nirupam Sen, back in Milan after a trip to the Italian plant at Asti. ?There is a lot of unexplored scope in food processing... West Bengal is a good place to cater to the needs of Southeast Asia as a whole.?

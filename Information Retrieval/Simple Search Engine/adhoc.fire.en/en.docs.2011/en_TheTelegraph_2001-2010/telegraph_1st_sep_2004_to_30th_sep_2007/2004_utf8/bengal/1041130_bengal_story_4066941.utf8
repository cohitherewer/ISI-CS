 New push in old club 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Darjeeling, Nov. 29: Planter?s Club, arguably the town?s most well-known address, has decided to go in for a major overhaul, synergising old world charm with modern comforts. 

 Maj. (retd) J.S. Rana, the secretary of the club, said a committee has given the green signal for value addition.

 ?The makeover will be slow but sure. We will build six more attic rooms, which will have telescopes through which one can view the rolling mountains. All the attic rooms (which will be like duplex structures), will enable one to get a 180-degree view of the Kanchenjunga,? said Rana.

 The present room rent is Rs 2,000 per night, but the rates are expected to be revised once the new amenities are introduced. 

 The value addition will take it in the league of elite clubs like Umed Club of Jodhpur, Chandigarh Club and Calcutta Swimming Club, with whom it has a tie-up.

 The club, run by a board of governors, most of whom are planters, ploughs its entire profits in renovation. 

 The Darjeeling Club, the less popular name of the Planter?s Club, was established in 1868. 

 The club began raking in profits over the past four years and the place, once only for planters, has today opened its doors to a wide cross- section of people.

 The club recently set up a conference room on its premises and has also tied up with Taaja?s, a restaurant chain, to cater to its clients.

 ?In the past, ladies were not allowed on the quarter deck that overlooks the street. Why or when the decision was taken, we do not know, but the restriction has been quietly removed. Membership for ladies, however, is still an exception,? Rana said.

 The oxygen cylinders of Mallory and Irvine, who lost their lives while trying to climb Everest in 1924, are also preserved at the entrance to the club, which is known to have been the starting point of their expedition.

 Suicide bid on deport delay 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Midnapore, Sept. 5: Driven by depression, 35-year-old Khaleda Bibi, a Bangladeshi woman languishing in Midnapore central jail, tried to commit suicide by hanging herself from the ceiling of a bathroom before dawn. She has been admitted in the Midnapore medical college hospital. 

 Khaledas desperate act brings to focus the plight of hundreds of infiltrators who are caught and lodged in jail. 

 Jail superintendent Panchanan Biswas said Khaleda and 77 others were brought to the jail on February 21. Though they have been officially released, we cannot send them due to procedural delay in their deportation. This is most frustrating. We cannot set them at large under the open sky until the Bangladesh government takes them back, he said. 

 Jail sources said the Bangladeshis went on a hunger strike a fortnight ago demanding that they be sent back. Where can we send them if the neighbouring country does not take any initiative to take them back? asked deputy inspector-general of prisons Anup Tripathi, who oversees Midnapore central jail. 

 Home secretary Amit Kiran Deb admitted tonight in Calcutta to problems in deporting the Bangladeshis lodged in jails here. However, we are seriously taking up the matter with Bangladesh government to expedite their deportation. 

 The frustration levels are high. Another married Bangladeshi woman in the jail had attempted suicide one-and-a-half months ago, Biswas said. 

 She told me she wanted to end her life after having heard about her husbands affair with another woman in her absence. These women sometimes insist on being shot dead as they have no takers, he said. 

 Biswas said Khaleda went to the bathroom around 2.35 am and tied a corner of her sari to the ceiling to hang herself. Timely intervention by other inmates who saw her saved her life, he added.

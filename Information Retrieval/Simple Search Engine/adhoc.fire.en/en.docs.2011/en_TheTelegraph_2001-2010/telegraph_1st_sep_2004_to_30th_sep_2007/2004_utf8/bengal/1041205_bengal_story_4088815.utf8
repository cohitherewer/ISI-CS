 Wife throttles drunk man 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Howrah, Dec. 4: Nights of drunken brawls and bickering prompted a woman to break out of her defensive shell and strangle her husband. 

 The incident occurred at Kashipur off Dasnagar in Howrah late last night. The incident came to light after the woman dragged the body out early this morning and hung it on a tree using her sari in a bid to pass it off as a suicide. 

 Ava Porel, a woman in her mid-forties, was arrested after she confessed to her crime, without much remorse.

 Gopal Porel, investigations revealed, returned home drunk every night and fought with his wife, who cribbed and protested against his habits and tendency to end up spending the day?s earning on gambling. 

 Gopal, who earned a living running errands, often quarrelled with his wife till their daughter and son-in-law intervened. 

 Residents of Bharatmata Colony said they knew about the Porels? fights, adding that on several occasions, Gopal had to be thrown out of the house for the night. 

 Soon Ava got a job of anodising items in Belgachhia. Soon after, she asked Gopal to change his habits and control his temper. Yesterday, when Gopal returned drunk and having spent all his money on satta, Ava lost control. 

 The investigating officer said: ?Around 11 pm, she lost her cool and held her husband by the throat. He tried to wriggle out but the lady held on tightly and the man choked and died on the spot. Scared at the turn of events, she kept quiet about it and didn?t even inform her daughter Moumita, who was present in an adjoining room with husband Mritunjoy and two-year-old daughter.? 

 As news of the body hanging from the tree spread, the police arrived. Ava, the officer said, confessed to her crime during interrogation. 

 The police are also probing the possible involvement of Moumita and Mritunjoy.

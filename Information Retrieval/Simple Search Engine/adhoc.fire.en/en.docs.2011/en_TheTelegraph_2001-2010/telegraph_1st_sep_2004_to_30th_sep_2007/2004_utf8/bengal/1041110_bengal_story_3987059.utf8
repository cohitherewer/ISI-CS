 CPM ?conciliator? beheaded over fine

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Nov. 9: A CPM leader, who had fined an alleged molester at a conciliation meeting, was shot and beheaded by the accused and his men in front of his wife and daughter this morning.

 At Pipulkhola in Karimpur, about 190 km from Calcutta, Ahachand Shaho?s supporters then hunted down the leader of the gang, Jabbar Ali, and thrashed him unconscious. He died at Behrampore Hospital later.

 A popular leader in the area, Shaho, 45, was a party local committee member and the deputy chief of the Dorahadaha gram panchayat.

 Police said he incurred Jabbar?s wrath by fining him Rs 15,000 in August for allegedly molesting tribal farmer Kartick Mal?s wife and sister. ?Jabbar fled the area after the shalishi meeting,? said additional superintendent of police Biswarup Ghosh. 

 ?When Shaho discovered that Jabbar had fled, he made Kartick lodge an FIR.?

 Around 4 this morning, Jabbar?s gang broke open the door to his house and barged in. One of them shot him twice from a revolver. Then, to make sure Shaho was dead, another chopped his head off. 

 The villagers rushed in attracted by cries of help from Achhia Bibi and Shaho?s 14-year-old daughter Merina. Jabbar and his associates hurled bombs as they fled.

 But Merina, a Class VIII student in a local school, recognised Jabbar even in the moments of shock. Villagers seething with anger then split into groups and launched a search. Jabbar was seen running across a field towards Domkol in Murshidabad. But the mob caught up with him. 

 When a force led by Tehatta subdivisional police officer Kankan Barui arrived, the villagers were all over Jabbar in the paddy field. He was on the ground limp, unconscious and profusely bleeding. 

 Nadia CPM secretary Ashu Ghosh said Shaho was very popular. ?He was straightforward and stubborn about rooting out crime.?

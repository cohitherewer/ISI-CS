 Laddoo gang held after loot on train

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Durgapur, Dec. 14: Four youths befriended a family on the Howrah-bound Delhi-Kalka Mail, offered laddoos and looted its members last night when they fell unconscious.

 However, police cordoned off the train at Asansol, 230 km from Calcutta, after one of the family members raised an alarm, and all were caught. 

 The Government Railway Police (GRP) said Arup Singh Roy, his wife Beauty and their children were returning from Delhi to their home in Ranaghat, Nadia.

 Sanjay Das alias Tipu Sultan, Mohammad Feroz, Mohammad Islam and Mohammad Ismail, who also boarded the train from Delhi, struck a friendship with 10-year-old Amit in no time. ?A little after we left Delhi, the youths started chatting with Amit and being friendly with Babu, who is six months old. We did not mind as they appeared to be from good families,? said Beauty, who raised the alarm. 

 After the train reached Moghulsarai, one of the youths offered the ladoos, she said. ?I refused the sweets as I was chewing pan masala. But my husband and Amit ate. After finishing the pan masala, even I ate a ladoo. An hour later, all of us started feeling uneasy and lost consciousness.? 

 When the train reached Dhanbad, Beauty woke up and found her husband and children lying on the floor. Their luggage and her gold necklace were missing. So were the youths. The other passengers in the compartment were fast asleep.

 ?I got down at Dhanbad and shouted for help. Policemen patrolling the platform advised me to register a case with the Asansol GRP,? said Beauty. As the train screeched into Asansol around 7, a GRP contingent cordoned it off. 

 Beauty identified the four youths, who were trying to sneak out.

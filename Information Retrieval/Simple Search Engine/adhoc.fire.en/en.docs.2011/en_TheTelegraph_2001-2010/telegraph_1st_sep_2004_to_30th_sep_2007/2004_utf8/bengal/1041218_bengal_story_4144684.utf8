 Scarcity hits school meals

 NARESH JANA

 Midnapore, Dec. 17: Distribution of rice to primary schools for midday meals and to those below poverty line has all but stopped in the two Midnapores since September because of inadequate supply from the Food Corporation of India (FCI). 

 About 12 lakh primary students in 7,850 schools in East and West Midnapore are now going without the meal and the authorities are worried about a spurt in dropouts. About 31 lakh below poverty line people are also not getting their subsidised rice from ration shops.

 ?We are facing some problems regarding the supply of rice. We hope the problem will be solved soon,? said Subir Dutta, the FCI?s district manager.

 The Supreme Court had said in an order that all schoolchildren up to Class V must be provided cooked midday meals by January 2005. 

 District officials said if the supply is not restored soon, the children cannot be provided the rice (100g per head per day), let alone cooked meals.

 The high dropout rate of schoolchildren in Bengal has often been attributed to the lack of midday meals. Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, too, has repeatedly emphasised the need to provide the meals to stem the number of school dropouts every year.

 An FCI official said over 12,000 tonnes of rice are required every month for the meal scheme and distribution among the poor, but the supply to the Midnapore godown has been meagre ? this month it has received 2,300 tonnes, but nothing came between September and November.

 Gorachand Das, the chairman of the district primary education council, said: ?We will not be able to reduce the number of dropouts if the supply of rice for midday meals is not regular. After the scheme started, we had lesser dropouts.?

 Officials said though the supply has been erratic, attempts are on to keep the meal scheme on in about 2,500 primary schools, where cooked food is being served from old stocks in ration shops. But, these stocks are fast depleting and about 400 schools have stopped providing meals to schoolchildren.

 Niranjan Sihi, the sabhadhipati of the East Midnapore zilla parishad, said: ?We can?t give the students their quota of rice. We have also received reports of a stop in distribution of cooked meals. It will take a Herculean effort to restore normality.?

 Sihi added that because of the rice scarcity, it is becoming difficult to implement the Sampurna Gramin Swarozgar Yojna for people below the poverty line. Under the scheme, poor villagers are employed for development work and paid partly in cash and partly in terms of rice. ?In the absence of rice, we are paying cash. But this cannot go on for long. We have informed the chief minister about it,? he said.

 The impoverished Amlashol, Belpahari, Kankrajhore, Amjharna, Odalchua, Banspahari and Jamboni in Jhargram subdivision are now reeling under the crisis.

 Father, son held for job racket 

 Durgapur, Sept. 9: A father-son duo was arrested today from South Bazar here on charges of running a railway recruitment racket at Andal, 210 km from Calcutta.

 Police said Loknath Sinha Roy, who has an art school, and his son Shanu duped youths after promising them jobs in the railway. Sinha Roy even issued appointment letters, which proved to be fake. 

 Burdwan superintendent of police Neeraj Singh said a youth, Sanjay Das, had alleged that he was cheated. ?The duo apparently took Rs 1 lakh in two instalments from Das and issued an appointment letter. We suspect that some rail employees are involved in the racket,? Singh said.

 According to the complaint, the Sinha Roys used to organise training camps at signal cabins and railway tracks in collusion with a section of railway employees.

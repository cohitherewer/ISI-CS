 Price slide blame in potato dealer death

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Chinsurah, Nov. 25: Manoj 

 Khaitan, a potato dealer and cold storage manager, committed 

 suicide in his Pandua office yesterday, apparently because 

 a fall in the tuber?s price had made it difficult for him 

 to repay his loans. 

 ?After preliminary investigation, we found he bought a huge quantity of potatoes from farmers and stocked them in the cold storage. He left a suicide note, saying he was killing himself because he would not be able to repay his loan,? said officer-in-charge of Pandua police station Priyabrata Bakshi. 

 His colleagues said a depressed Khaitan retreated into his office, located 65 km from Calcutta, last evening. When he did not come out for hours, they informed the police, who broke open the door to find that he had hanged himself from the ceiling. 

 Khaitan, a 28-year-old trader in Hooghly, which produces more than half of Bengal?s potato crop, was married only eight months ago and leaves behind his pregnant wife and parents, who live in Liluah, Howrah. 

 Khaitan?s colleagues said he had spent Rs 20 lakh to stock potato in the cold storage at the rate of Rs 400 a quintal a few months ago. But he was shattered as the prices crashed over the last three weeks. The price of potato is now about Rs 160 per quintal.

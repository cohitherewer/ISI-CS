 Language duo trips CU students

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Oct. 16: Calcutta University will probe the poor performance of candidates in compulsory language papers in this year?s BA, BSc Part-I examinations. 

 The results of the undergraduate examinations held in July were announced yesterday. Last year, 82.78 per cent students cleared the BSc Part-I (honours) examination. This year, the figure was 78.5 per cent. In the general category, 64.82 per cent passed this year compared to 70.7 per cent in 2003. In BA (honours), 82.78 per cent candidates passed this year against last year?s 83.6 per cent. The pass percentage in Arts? general category also declined. 

 University officials said ?dismal performance? in the language papers, particularly English, was a prime reason behind the low success rates. 

 ?We are worried about the trend. For the past three years, candidates have not been faring well in the compulsory English and Bengali papers. We need to stem the rot,? said Onkar Sadhan Adhikari, the varsity?s controller of examinations. 

 He added that the failure to score the minimum pass marks in the language papers after studying the subjects at the Madhyamik and the Higher Secondary levels will be investigated.

 Many of those who received marksheets today complained that they failed for not obtaining pass marks in the compulsory language papers. Two compulsory language papers of 50 marks each have to be studied at the undergraduate level along with the elective papers. Of the two language papers, English is a must. Students can opt for another regional language. The 30 per cent pass marks have to be obtained in each of the two papers. 

 Earlier, the language papers were a must but passing was not mandatory.

 Santiniketan, Oct. 1: The 

 Nobel committee has said it would send a replica of Rabindranath 

 Tagore?s medal even as sleuths are hunting for a duplicate 

 that went missing along with the original after the heist 

 in March.

 The Nobel committee informed Visva-Bharati authorities in a fax message today, the day President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam visited the varsity, that it would soon send the replica. However, the joy was dampened as sleuths revealed that a duplicate of the medal is also missing.

 The Central Bureau of Investigation and the Criminal Investigation Department probing the Tagore heist have found evidence that one ? if not two ? replica was made by Visva-Bharati in the 1970s.

 ?Dilip Mukherjee (a former registrar) told us that, under the instructions of Dilip Sinha (the then vice-chancellor), he had taken the medal out of the strong-room (in the late ?90s) to see whether it matched the photograph,? said a senior CID official.

 Mukherjee, who was arrested in connection with the Mukti Deb case in which an appointment to a lecturer?s post was made on the basis of fake marksheets, said a replica was kept for display at the museum.

 In 1981-82, the then vice-chancellor Amlan Dutta had got all valuables, including the medal, assessed by a jeweller from Calcutta.

 ?No one is sure which was kept for display ? the original or the replica. But both the original and the replica are missing. We have, however, located one replica of the medal at Rabindra Bharati University in Calcutta, which was handed over to them by the Visva-Bharati authorities,? said a CBI official.

 Fresh evidence suggests that the burglars had walked into the museum in March through the main door by using duplicate keys.

 ?We have come to the conclusion that the window was broken from inside to mislead us. The burglars had even gone to the trouble of taking a piece of paper from the museum and using it to shut the window behind them while going out,? said a CBI official.

 CBI and CID officials said the burglary is a result of two groups fighting for control over the varsity.

 The CID has sought the President?s permission for submitting a chargesheet against Sinha in the fake marksheet case. ?We have already got the permission from the vice-chancellor regarding the chargesheet to be filed against Mukti Deb and Dilip Mukherjee. The President?s nod for Sinha would reach us within a day or two,? said a CID official.

 Kalam, the varsity?s Visitor, asked the Visva-Bharati authorities to prepare a vision document to raise it to international standards.

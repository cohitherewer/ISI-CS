 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, Sept. 7: A 28-year-old woman was snatched from under her husbands nose and allegedly raped by three youths in Sonarpur.

 Police said the woman and her husband overslept on a train and missed the station at Narendrapur, where they live. They got down at the next station, Sonarpur, and crossed the tracks. When they reached the other side, the youths from a nearby slum surrounded them, the police said.

 The youths assaulted the husband and took the woman to a nearby ground where they allegedly raped her. A complaint was filed at Sonarpur police station today. 

 Calcutta: The high court on Tuesday struck down the appointment of a teacher to a Visva-Bharati affiliated school in Sreeniketan for not having the requisite qualification. 

 Bandana Sribastav was recruited during the tenure of former vice-chancellor Dilip Sinha, who was arrested on the charge of attesting forged certificates of Mukti Deb, a former applied math lecturer in the university. The verdict followed a petition by Khusi Sarkar of Santiniketan, who was among six candidates shortlisted for the post at Siksha Shastra School that Sribastav bagged. The judge ordered a fresh appointment.

 Burdwan: Kesto Halder poisoned his eight-year-old daughter Puja on Tuesday when she protested against his fourth marriage. Superintendent Niraj Singh said Halder and his fourth wife were arrested from Sudpur in Katwa, 180 km from Calcutta. Halder was unemployed and lived off his wives.

 Murshidabad: Hasi Mondal of Kurmitala, 220 km from Calcutta, suffocated her 13-month daughter to death. She tried to pass the blame onto the father but later confessed and said she was under pressure since giving birth to a second daughter.

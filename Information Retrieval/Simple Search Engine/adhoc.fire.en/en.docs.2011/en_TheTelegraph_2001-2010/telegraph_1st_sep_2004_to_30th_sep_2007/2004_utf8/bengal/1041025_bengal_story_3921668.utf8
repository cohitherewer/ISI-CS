 Rush to hospital fatal for rescuers

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Behrampore, Oct. 24: Three-year-old 

 Suman Islam had suffered burns and was crying as his aunt 

 and a neighbour were rushing him to hospital.

 Lilufa Bibi egged on the driver of the Tata Sumo to move faster so her nephew could be saved. Minutes later, she was dead after a wheel came off the speeding vehicle, which dashed into a tree.

 The neighbour, Bharat Pramanick, too, died. Suman made it to hospital and is recovering.

 ?This is a very tragic incident,? said superintendent of police Gyanwant Singh, in whose Murshidabad district the accident occurred last night at Kuptola village, about 240 km from Calcutta.

 Of the six injured ? including Khaleda Bibi, the former local panchayat pradhan ? three are serious.

 From her hospital bed, Khaleda said Suman suffered the burns around 7.30 pm. ?We immediately organised a Sumo to take him to the hospital in Behrampore. Suman?s relatives pestered the driver to move faster. I tried to reason with them. Suddenly, one of the front wheels came off and the car lost control.?

 Suman?s father, Shahidul Islam, is crushed that Lilufa, 28, and his friend Bharat, 25, are dead.

 ?Bharat had just returned home after the Durga immersion. As soon as he heard about Suman, he rushed to us. He saw me crying and nervous, so he picked up Suman and boarded the Sumo. That is the last time I saw him,? said Shahidul.

 Fifty-year-old Jarman Sheikh, also of Murshidabad, did not have Suman?s luck. A former member of Kapashdanga panchayat, Jarman injured himself when his motorcycle skidded this morning near Mirzapur village, about 180 km from Calcutta.

 On the Beldanga health centre?s advice, he was being moved to the hospital in Behrampore, when the ambulance was hit by a truck near Debkundu More. It fell into a roadside ditch, killing Jarman.

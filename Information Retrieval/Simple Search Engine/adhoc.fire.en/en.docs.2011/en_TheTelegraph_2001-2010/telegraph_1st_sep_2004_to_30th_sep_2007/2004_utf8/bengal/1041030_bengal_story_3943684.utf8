 Leader roams, officer says absconding

 RABI BANERJEE. 

 Krishnagar, Oct. 29: Police seem to have made it a habit to look the other way when it comes to arresting a CPM leader. 

 A warrant from the subdivisional judicial magistrate?s court here has been rendered toothless by the law-enforcers, who have put an absconder tag on Joydeb Hawladar, the ruling party?s Majdia local committee treasurer.

 A party youth wing leader and former pradhan of the Krishnagunj gram panchayat, about 110 km from Calcutta, Hawladar was accused of cheating and misappropriation of government funds during his tenure as the panchayat chief six years ago. 

 But months after the court issued the warrant, he roams free in the area and the police say he is ?absconding?.

 When Hawladar was said to be missing, he was appointed a ?resource person? for the Sarba Siksha Abhijan in Krishnagunj block. He has been going around villages campaigning for education for the past few months. He attended a local committee meeting today. 

 However, according to police, he is still absconding.

 The Telegraph reported last Wednesday about a rape accused, backed by the CPM unit in Burdwan, who is roaming free though the police claim he is absconding. The party had offered the victim money as compensation and suggested conciliation with Dhiraj Das, a health inspector at the Khandaghosh block health centre, 140 km from Calcutta. 

 District officials said Hawladar was charged with misappropriation of funds and cheating during his tenure as panchayat pradhan from 1993 to 1998. Then block development officer Suman Ghosh had begun a probe on the basis of complaints lodged by the Opposition parties in 1999.

 In March 2001, Ghosh lodged an FIR against Hawladar. But the police did not detain him. Instead, it referred the case to the enforcement branch. 

 The branch saw merit in the charges and petitioned the magistrate for the warrant. 

 Additional superintendent of police Biswarup Ghosh said a case was registered against Hawladar under three non- bailable charges. ?We carried out raids to arrest Hawladar, but he gave us the slip every time,? Ghosh said, adding that the police were ?trying hard?.

 BDO Kartik Mondal said though Hawladar coordinates with his office, he had ?no role in his appointment? as a resource person.

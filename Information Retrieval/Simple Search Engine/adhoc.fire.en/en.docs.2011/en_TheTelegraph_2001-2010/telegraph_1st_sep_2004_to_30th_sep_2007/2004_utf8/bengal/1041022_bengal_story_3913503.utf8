 Pollution board relief for workers

 TAMAL SENGUPTA

 Calcutta, Oct. 21: The West Bengal Pollution Control Board has stopped issuing closure notices to polluting units as this would only ?add to the unemployment problem and create social tension?.

 The board is instead setting deadlines for plants to adhere to pollution norms.

 ?Such units need to be closed. However, at the same time, we are worried about the fate of the workers. In case these units are closed, the entire workforce will suffer. The closure may also create social tension, which is not at all desirable,? said a pollution board directive.

 The board recently found three industrial units in Bengal violating pollution guidelines, including the Durgapur-based SPS Sponge Iron Ltd.

 ?The main problem of the unit is air pollution. Time and again, the unit failed to meet the norms prescribed by the Air (Prevention amp; Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, and the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986,? observed the board.

 The board initially decided to take ?effective steps for the abatement of pollution within 15 days?. It later asked the plant to introduce a pollution control system by November and meet the norms by December 31. A pollution cost of Rs 5,000 per day would be imposed on the unit, if it failed to comply.

 Failure to adhere to pollution-control norms would also entail closure of the unit, the board said. However, this would not absolve the plant of the responsibility of paying workers wages, it clarified, following a recent Supreme Court order to this effect.

 The pollution control board had also closed down Corporate Ispat Alloys, a ferro-alloy unit in Durgapur, for violating statutory provisions under the environment act, by dumping hazardous wastes.

 Ispat Alloys was inspected in August by pollution board officials who found its two furnaces emitting gaseous substances much beyond the permissible limit. ?We were supposed to impose a pollution cost on the unit and also issue a closure notice. But we refrained from doing so as the unit promised to adopt anti-pollution measures soon,? said an official.

 The board also allowed a polluting unit of Jhargram to function. ?It is a fit case for closure. However, in view of Durga Puja and the impact such an action would have on the workers, we did not slap a closure notice. We have directed the unit to pay Rs 1 lakh and execute a bank guarantee of Rs 5 lakh for its failure to check pollution,? said an official.

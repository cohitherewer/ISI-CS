 Marksheet 

tampering axe makes its debut

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Kanti: Disciplinarian

Calcutta, Oct. 5: The government 

 today dismissed a secondary school teacher in Nadia who 

 had tampered with his MA marksheet to bag a history teacher?s 

 post. 

 Rejjak Ali Mondal will be the first teacher in the state to be axed for furnishing a fake marksheet.

 School education minister Kanti Biswas said: ?Our government considers teaching a noble profession and will not allow any dishonest person to serve as a teacher in any school that receives its assistance.? 

 Mondal, who taught history at Bahirgachhi Begmara High School, did MA in philosophy from Calcutta University. Nine years ago, he erased the word ?philosophy? on his marksheet and replaced it with history.

 ?He wanted to prove that he was an MA in history because it is easier to manage a job of a history teacher in schools,? Biswas said. 

 After smelling a rat, the school authorities requested the university to ascertain the authenticity of Mondal?s marksheet. The university said Mondal had done MA in philosophy, not history.

 The minister today warned stern action against teachers caught producing fake marksheets at the time of appointment or later.

 In dropping the axe, the government revoked an earlier decision of the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education, which had recommended that Mondal be allowed to continue. 

 The school managing committee had dismissed Mondal after the irregularity was detected. But the appeal committee of the secondary board ? a body to address disputes between teaching and non-teaching employees and school authorities ? rejected the managing committee?s recommendation and reinstated Mondal.

 ?The board is an autonomous body and since 1966, when the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education Act was implemented, we never rejected any of its decisions concerning dispute with teachers. But, this time, we had to intervene because the government is determined not to tolerate malpractice with marksheets among teachers,? Biswas said.

 Recently, a teacher of a school in Midnapore and a retired teacher of a school in south Calcutta were found to have furnished fake papers.

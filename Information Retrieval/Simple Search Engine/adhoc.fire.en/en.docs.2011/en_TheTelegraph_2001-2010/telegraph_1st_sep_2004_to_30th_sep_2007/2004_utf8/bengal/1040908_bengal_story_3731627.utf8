Siliguri, Sept. 7: Parents angry at the Siliguri Boys Schools decision to write questions on the blackboard instead of providing printed papers locked classrooms and tried to get the first-term exams postponed on its first day today

 The protest paid off as the authorities decided to defer the tests till the parents take up the matter with the primary school council.

 Normal classes, however, will resume from tomorrow.

 The students saw their parents in a new role as they prevented the exams, prompting the school to call police.

 It will be difficult for the boys to read questions from the board, said Satyenmoy Saha, one of the parents who added that they were ready to pay for the printed papers.

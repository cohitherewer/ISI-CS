 Fraud salvo at civic body chief

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Behrampore, Dec. 9: Police have started an inquiry into charges of fraud against Behrampore municipality chairman Nilratan Adhya following an FIR against him by the Murshidabad District Central Cooperative Bank. 

 The row has gained an edge in view of the fact that the bank?s board is controlled by the CPM with district secretariat member Shekhar Saha as its chairman while the Congress heads the municipality. 

 Saha said the municipality?s staff credit cooperative society had taken a loan of Rs 13 lakh two years ago and disbursed it to 35 employees. 

 ?The chairman of the municipality took the responsibility of repayment of the loan as the drawing and disbursing officer. A portion of salary is being deducted from employees from October last year but not a single paisa has been deposited with the bank,? said Saha.

 Adhya accused the bank of anomalies in the loan process. ?At least 27 employees complained that they did not get the amount they wanted. I wrote to the bank and lodged a general diary with the police on November 10 last year,? he said. 

 ?I have opened a separate account to keep aside the amount deducted from the salaries of employees. I have not repaid any money to the bank. I don?t mind if I am arrested. But it is my responsibility to look after my employees,? he added.

 Store shut, children denied

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Raiganj, Oct. 10: More 

 than 3,000 children had to return home without polio drops 

 today after a vaccine shortage was reported following a 

 prolonged absence of the store in-charge of the district 

 health department. 

 Alarmed by news that the polio centres were running short of vaccine vials, Raiganj municipality chairman Mohit Sengupta rushed to Gourbandhu Chakraborty, the store in-charge of the North Dinajpur health department?s polio unit at Karnajhora, only to find him missing. He had reportedly gone out for lunch around 11 am, taking with him the store keys. 

 Sengupta waited for about an hour before lodging a written complaint with the office of the district?s chief medical officer of health. 

 It is learnt that there was adequate stock of vaccine at the district control room for today?s programme. 

 Though the municipality had requisitioned 1,050 vials, it received 800 from Raiganj Hospital?s pulse polio unit last night. On an average, 17 children can be administered the vaccine from each vial. 

 ?The hospital had been told to make up for the shortage. But no one bothered. When I started getting complaints, I rang up the control room. As they could not assure me, I visited the health department?s office. But the man in charge of the unit was apparently away for lunch,? Sengupta said.

 The programme began at 8 am in 54 centres under the municipality. By 11, the shortage was evident. Around noon, more than 100 children were waiting outside a centre near the bus terminus. 

 Nabin Sarkar, one of the guardians, said: ?We have been here for over an hour. I think we will have to go back.?

 Ruma Dey Sarkar, a health worker at the booth, said about 850 children were supposed to have been administered the vaccine. ?We needed 47 vials but received 17.?

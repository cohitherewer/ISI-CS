 Bandh brigade rejects front?s strike motion

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 21: The parties were united in their call for a resolution to protect the right to strike and call bandhs, but now that the CPM has prepared a draft, differences have begun showing.

 The Assembly was divided when Left Front chief whip Rabin Deb tabled the motion today. Trinamul Congress, Congress and SUCI members refused to support it saying that there was no mention of the right to observe bandhs. 

 The high court had banned bandhs earlier. A division bench of the court had issued directives asking the state government to foil bandhs as the Supreme Court had declared them unconstitutional. However, the bench later drew a line between strikes and bandhs. It also clarified that a strike in which no force was applied to prevent those interested from working was not illegal.

 The motion Deb moved says: ?This House is of the opinion that the right to strike is a last weapon left with the working class to press its demand. The House, therefore, urges the state government to take necessary steps with the Union government so that rights and benefits acquired by workers, including their right to strike, may not be undermined and/or curtailed in any form.?? 

 Trinamul chief whip Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay pointed out that it only deals with strikes. 

 His party, which had called the bandh on December 3 that prompted the court to issue some of the strictures, moved an amendment seeking the inclusion of the word ?bandh?.

 The Congress, which had opposed the Trinamul shutdown call, supported the inclusion of the word in the motion. But front legislators refused to accept the change and the Opposition rejected the motion.

 Two SUCI legislators ? Debaprasad Sarkar and Prabodh Purkait ? moved a separate motion on the right to observe strikes and bandhs. Moving the motion, Sarkar said there is no difference between a general strike and a bandh. 

 Congress legislature party chief Atish Sinha joined forces with Chattopadhyay and said the word ?bandh? was not made part of the motion at chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s insistence. ?Bhattacharjee publicly said bandh has become a disease in Bengal and a doctor is needed to cure it. This proves that the chief minister is against bandhs. The front chief whip has intentionally omitted the word from the motion,? he said. 

 Trinamul?s Kalyan Banerjee asked: ?If there is no mention of bandh in the motion, what is the point in moving it??

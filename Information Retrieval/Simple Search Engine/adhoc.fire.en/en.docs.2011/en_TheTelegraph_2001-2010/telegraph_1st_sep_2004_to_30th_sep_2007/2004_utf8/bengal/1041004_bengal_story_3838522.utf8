 CM?s call to check brain drain to south

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, Oct. 3: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today gave a fillip to the Left Front?s Assembly by-election campaign with a call to retain Bengal?s brains in the state.

 ?Why should we lose our talented young people with command over English and information technology to laces like Hyderabad, Bangalore or Mumbai?? the chief minister asked at a rally in north Calcutta?s Jorabagan, which will go to the polls on October 9 along with two other seats.

 ?We must create opportunities here to retain them,? he said. Bhattacharjee made it clear that the Left Front government would ensure young talents are accommodated for further studies in the state after they pass the Joint Entrance or any other competitive examination.

 ?We have already set up 65 engineering colleges across Bengal and are ready to open a few more to prevent the boys from going to other states.?

 Bengal, he claimed, had already achieved success in iron and steel, plastic, and agro-based industries. 

 ?We must also not underestimate our success in the IT sector, in which we have progressed a lot,? he said.

 The chief minister did not spare his party?s ally at the Centre, the Congress, which he said would be opposed strongly despite ?our understanding at the national level?.

 ?We must not forget that while the Congress was responsible for dividing the country between haves and have-nots, the BJP does it on the basis of religion. And Mamata Banerjee?s Trinamul Congress has brought in the BJP here. So I want you to discard all of them and instead elect our candidates.?

 CPM?s Parimal Biswas is contesting Jorabagan that fell vacant after Sudhansu Sil was elected to the Lok Sabha in the general elections in May.

 Jyoti Basu said the CPM and the Congress were sailing together because of the compulsions of ground realities.

 ?The situation has come to such a pass that we have to back the Congress to form a government at the Centre to keep the BJP at bay. Though we have opposed the party tooth and nail for 45 years, there is no denying that we are today depending on each other for survival.?

 Speaking at a state CPM programme as part of the yearlong birth centenary celebrations of the communist leader, A.K. Gopalan, the former chief minister said the party should exploit this ?advantageous position? to expand base across the country.

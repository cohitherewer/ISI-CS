 Roads and rush on radar

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

Howrah, Nov. 14: Traffic management in the districts neighbouring Calcutta is set to get a tech turn.

 Modern traffic signals, video-monitoring devices and computerised control-rooms are on the way.

 Director-general of police Shyamal Dutta today unveiled plans for an integrated project to ensure easy flow of traffic in Howrah, Hooghly and the two 24-Parganas and inaugurated a wireless video-monitoring system for areas around Howrah station and the Howrah Maidan. 

 Pictures of the two most congested places in Howrah, taken round-the-clock, will be fed to a hi-tech control room in Shibpur. 

 Dutta said the objective behind installing the video camera system was to monitor the flow of traffic and to ease congestion. ?It will also help identify the specific causes of congestion in the heart of the town and the control panel will ensure detection of the loop-holes in traffic management,? Dutta said. 

 The new system can also be used to trace vehicles involved in accidents.

 Howrah will get three more video-monitoring devices soon. Dutta said unless the suburbs are freed of congestion and modern equipment installed, the traffic mess in Calcutta will prevail. 

 ?Roads in Howrah, Hooghly and the two 24-Parganas, which are in bad shape, will be repaired by the PWD in a short time,? the police chief said.

 A proposal on integrated traffic management has been sent to the home department to ensure smoother movement and reduce accidents, said Dutta. It has already been approved and will be implemented in a few months, he added.

 ?For the benefit of the greater Calcutta traffic network, the wireless video-monitoring system will also be installed between Calcutta and Barrackpore, in Serampore, Dankuni, up to Salkia from Howrah Maidan and through Diamond Harbour Road to Joka.? 

 After this project is implemented, 200 more police personnel will be deployed to manage traffic. 

 Every year, 100 police officials will be selected from the Barrackpore Police Training College and provided specialised training in traffic at the Traffic Training School. These officials will be sent to the suburbs to manage traffic. 

 Dutta later inaugurated a single-storey barracks for constables on the Shibpur police station premises.

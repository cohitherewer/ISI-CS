 Govt watch on trickle

 OUR BUREAU

 Sept. 2: So far, it has only been a trickle. But it has been enough to send alarm bells ringing in Darjeeling and Jalpaiguri districts.

 On a day when home secretary Amit Kiran Deb, referring to the developments in Nepal, said in a situation like this people from neighbouring countries usually cross the border, the district administrations are tightlipped.

 Darjeeling superintendent of police Rajeev Mishra said there is no influx, but neither can we say that no one is crossing over to India for refuge. 

 Under the treaty with Nepal, there is free movement of citizens from either side and there is no way we can stop people entering India, Mishra said, adding: On the face of it, the number of people coming in from the Nepal side does not appear to be unusual.

 Police sources, however, confirmed that in the wake of the attacks on Muslim establishments in Nepal, several families have crossed over and made their way to some of the north Bengal districts. The reason why nothing unusual has been detected is because the number has been very small, an official said.

 According to police sources, at least 15 Muslim families have crossed into India. 

 Yesterday, seven families entered India from the Kakkarvita side of Nepal and crossed over to Panitanki in Darjeeling district. We also have information that about eight other families went towards Islampur in North Dinajpur, the official said.

 North Bengal inspector- general of police Vageesh Mishra said: Of special consequence to us are the Maoists of Nepal and whether they are also trying to sneak in to seek shelter. We have to distinguish them from other people from Nepal entering India.

 In Darjeeling, political parties and social organisations today condemned the killing of 12 Nepalis in Iraq by Islamic militants. 

 Deepak Gurung, the Darjeeling president of the Gorkha National Liberation Front, said: The act was inhuman. Our condolences are there for the bereaved families.

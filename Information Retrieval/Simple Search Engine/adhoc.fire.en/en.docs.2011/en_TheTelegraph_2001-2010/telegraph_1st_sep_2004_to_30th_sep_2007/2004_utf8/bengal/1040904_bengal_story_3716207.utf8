 Extortion slur on headmaster

 Midnapore, Sept. 3: A high school teacher in West Midnapores Daspur has accused the headmaster and a section of teachers of demanding donation and issuing threats. 

 Pankaj Mohan Pati, a Sanskrit teacher at Nandanpur High School, 120 km from Calcutta, has stopped going to work. He has complained to police, the district inspector of schools and the School Service Commission (SSC).

 Pati alleged that since he joined the school in August 2002, after clearing the SSC entrance tests, he is being pressed for donation. In February 2003, when he had chicken pox and needed leave, headmaster Biswaranjan Mondal allegedly told him that he had to pay for it. After he resumed work, between Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 was deducted from his salary every month. When he objected, Pati was apparently humiliated in front of students. 

 Mondal dismissed the allegations and said the school did well after he joined.

 Armed to the teeth, villagers clash

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Kaliachak (Malda), Nov. 23: Violence flared between two villages here over a disputed lake where two young boys were caught fishing yesterday and one reportedly hacked to death. 

 Two police vans that had gone to Srirampur village in Kaliachak block today to locate the body of the missing boy had to beat a hasty retreat after a mob of around 500 men and women attacked them with pipe guns, sickles, sticks and crude bombs.

 According to inspector-in-charge of Kaliachak police station Swapan Dasgupta, trouble started at around 7 am yesterday when Rinku Sheikh (14) and Alaul Sheikh (10) of Naranpur village were found fishing in the disputed water body by residents of Srirampur. The villagers confiscated their fishing nets and took them to Srirampur for questioning. The two villages have been feuding over rights of the ox-bow lake for four years. 

 ?As the news of their abduction spread, angry villagers of Naranpur trooped into Srirampur to free the boys. Through the day, both sides held several so-called meetings. Around 8 last night, Alaul was released but there was no news of Rinku. We have information that he was hacked to death yesterday after the two boys were taken to Srirampur,? the inspector-in-charge said. 

 Convinced that the body of Rinku was hidden somewhere in the village, Dasgupta arrived at Srirampur at noon today with two vans of policemen. As the police personnel got off the jeeps to begin their search, there was a hail of stones and bombs. More than 500 men and women, armed with weapons, had gathered outside their village, determined not to let the police in. The mob attacked the men and smashed their jeeps, injuring seven policemen. 

 As the police retreated to a safe distance, residents of Naranpur rushed in to fight their rivals. The battle lasted till evening when another large contingent of police reached the spot to calm tempers. Four houses were gutted.

 Till late tonight, there was no news of the missing boy, who is feared dead, or any arrest. A police camp has been posted at the site to prevent any retaliatory violence. 

 Assistant sub-inspector Bhajan Sarkar, who was hurt, said: ?We could not enter Srirampur. The men were firing at us from hidden positions.?

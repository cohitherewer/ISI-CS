 Polio push at Sagar 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 24: Unhappy with the lukewarm response to the pulse polio programme, the state government has decided to organise a drive during the Ganga Sagar mela beginning January 12. 

 ?We want to make the most of the Ganga Sagar mela, the district?s biggest annual event, to administer polio vaccine to a maximum number of children up to five years of age coming from various parts of the country. This will also help us popularise the programme among a vast section of the rural populace,? Vivek Kumar, district magistrate of South 24-Parganas, told a news conference this afternoon. 

 Over six lakh pilgrims are expected to visit this year. 

 Kumar said special oral dose camps would be run on January 9 in association with NGOs at Namkhana and ferry points for Sagar-bound children of the pilgrims. Health workers under the district?s chief medical officer of health will work round the clock on the mela grounds from January 10 to 15. 

 Eighteen children were affected by polio in South 24-Parganas in the last two years. ?Our district recorded the highest number of polio victims in the last two years,? Kumar said. In 2003, the district recorded 17 cases. This year, one has been detected.

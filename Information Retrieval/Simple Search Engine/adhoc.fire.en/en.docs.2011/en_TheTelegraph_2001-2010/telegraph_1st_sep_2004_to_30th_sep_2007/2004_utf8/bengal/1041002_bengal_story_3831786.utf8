 State plea on medical NRI seats

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 1: The state government has filed a special leave petition in the Supreme Court against the Calcutta High Court directive that put the admissions of 105 NRI-sponsored students to the state-run SSKM and Midnapore Medical College in jeopardy.

 ?The petition is likely to come up for hearing on Monday,? a health department official said today.

 On September 29, Justice Indira Bannerjee had held a July 19, 2003, notification calling for admission through a special quota on payment of enhanced fees as ?bad in law, illegal, arbitrary and also ultra vires? to the Constitution. This effectively cancelled the admission of 105 NRI-sponsored students to two state-run medical colleges.

 However, parents of the 2003 joint entrance examination candidates have decided to contest the state?s appeal in the Supreme Court.

 Guardians and students of the special quota were also worried. ?We are very worried and do not know what will happen to us,? one of the students said.

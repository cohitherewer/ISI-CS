 Help at hand for family of the hanged

 AMIT UKIL

 Chhatna (Bankura), Sept. 20: One month and a week after Dhananjoy Chatterjee was hanged for the rape and murder of a schoolgirl in Calcutta in 1990, his brothers Bikash and Gangadhar sounded bitter about the system. 

 They have read how the same judge, R.. Kali, had sentenced Goutam Biswas of Syedpur in East Midnapore to life imprisonment for the same crime ? rape and murder of a minor girl. ?Why was Dhananjoy given the death sentence? And how did this Biswas get bail?? they asked.

 Dhananjoy?s family believes that if it had the money and the connections, ?Dhananjoy would still have been alive?. 

 Media reports of the poverty and hardship the family faced over 14 years while fighting the case have evoked sympathy and several individuals and organisations have come forward with help.

 ?We have opened an account at Mallabhum Gramin Bank in Chhatna where the money is being deposited,? said Provash Chatterjee, who has been helping the family. ?So far, about Rs 85,000 and two quintals of rice have come as donation from Bankura, Midnapore, Murshidabad and Calcutta,? Chatterjee said.

 The family will be holding Dhananjoy?s shradh (last rituals) on September 28, a month-and-a-half after his death. 

 Normality has made a comeback to the Chatterjee household in Kuludih in the last 37 days. Gangadhar?s children have returned to school and the village to its chores.

 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, Sept. 20: Biltu Das, 30, a domestic help of Trinamul Congress MLA Sonali Guha, was found dead in the attic of her Kalighat house tonight. 

 Police said Das was found hanging from the ceiling of a room on the roof. Guha?s husband Partha Bose, a Trinamul councillor of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, said: ?Biltu was very close to us and became part of our family. Yesterday, he picked a quarrel with my wife over his drinking habit. He was missing since morning. He entered the room through a window and hanged himself.? The body has been sent for post-mortem.

 Purulia: ?Explosives? wrapped in a jute cloth next to the tracks near Jhalda station created a sensation here but it turned out to be a ?crude bomb with a rusted wire attached?. Several trains use the tracks connecting Ranchi and Bokaro with Kharagpur. Nine days ago, the chief minister had addressed a rally at Hattola, 295 km from Calcutta and a kilometre from the site.

 Calcutta: The Kalighat temple authorities received a phone call around 8 pm on Monday and an alert that a bomb was planted in the sanctum sanctorum. The call turned out to be a hoax.

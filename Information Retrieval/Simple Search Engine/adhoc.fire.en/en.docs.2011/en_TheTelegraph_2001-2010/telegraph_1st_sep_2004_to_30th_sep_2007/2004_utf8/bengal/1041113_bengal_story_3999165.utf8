 A bridge on the river Kopai

 SOUMI BHATTACHARYA 

 Siala (Birbhum), Nov. 12: For 20 years, building a bamboo bridge on the Kopai has been a post-monsoon chore for the residents of this village near Bolpur. 

 It cuts down the trudge to the town by 6 km and the panchayat would not do anything to ease their problem. So, when the winding Kopai is in spate after the rainy season, the residents of Siala take it upon themselves to build the bridge ? raise funds and lend hands. So it has been for the past two decades.

 About 3,000 people from four villages ? Uttar Siala, Darpasila, Kuthipara and Ampukurdanga ? about 200 km from Calcutta, use the 20-ft bridge. Bolpur, its high schools, hospitals and marts, is now only 2 km away.

 Twenty years ago, the villagers would have to push through chest-deep water to reach the other end. Carrying the ailing to the nearest bus stop would involve a 6-km trek through slush pools.

 ?Sometimes we crossed the river with bicycles held high over our heads. When repeated requests to the local Kasba panchayat fell on deaf ears, we thought enough was enough,? said Akshoy Ghosh, a retired primary school teacher.

 Another resident, Papu Chakraborty, remembers how the elders had finalised building the first bridge themselves. ?It was calculated that it would take at least Rs 10,000 to build a sanko (narrow bridge) across the river. Everyone contributed, a rupee, bamboo poles and labour, and the bridge came up at a cost of Rs 2,000 only.?

 But, during the next monsoon, the river flowed over the bridge and by the end of the season, the structure rotted. The bridge-building began in earnest again. And that has been the norm after every monsoon.

 The panchayat pradhan was not available for comment. The chief of the Bolpur-Sriniketan Panchayat Samiti, Supriya Ghoshal, asked: ?Did the villagers ever raise the issue at the meetings of the gram sansad??

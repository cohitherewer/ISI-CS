 Kalam stuns with meet call

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR AND SOUMI BHATTACHARYA 

 Santiniketan, Sept. 30: The shadow of the Nobel theft hung over President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam?s first visit to Visva-Bharati tomorrow, with CBI sleuths scurrying for security passes to take any queries on the probe and the university asking students to stick to academics during an interaction with the dignitary. 

 The authorities were sent in a tizzy by Kalam, who as ?Visitor? to the university, called up vice-chancellor Sujit Basu on his mobile today and requested an administrative meeting. ?This took us by surprise since this is the first time in the history of the university that a Visitor has decided to hold a 45-minute meeting to discuss ways to improve the functioning of the university,? said registrar Sunil Sarkar. 

 Shortly after becoming President, Kalam had ordered an inquiry into the affiliation scam involving Visva-Bharati. 

 Nearly six months after the Nobel prize and other memorabilia went missing, CBI officers claimed they have stumbled on an ?important angle? in Bolpur town. ?There has been significant progress? we are now keeping everything under wraps as names of some important VB officials are involved,? a sleuth said. 

 Kalam has expressed interest to visit the museum from where the Nobel was stolen. 

 After meeting students in front of Shyamali, Tagore?s residence, for about an hour, Kalam will have lunch and follow it up with the meeting. 

 The varsity has lined up a Bengali lunch including arahar dal, bhindi posto, dhokar dalna, mulor tok and a special pan from Chandannagore.

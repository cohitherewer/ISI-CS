 Traders? strike 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Calcutta, Nov. 27: All shops in Raja Katra in Burrabazar remained closed today as at least 20 traders? associations observed a bandh in protest against the killing of businessman Shekhar Roy on Tuesday. 

 Roy, 40, was shot dead by five miscreants as he was approaching the Vidyasagar Setu on his bike to deposit several lakhs in bank. 

 As Tapas Mukherjee, secretary of the Raja Katra Byabsayee Samity, complained that police had failed to find clues to the murder though almost a week had elapsed, Howrah police today claimed three persons arrested in connection with a motorcycle theft were suspected to have had a hand in the murder. 

 Senior police officials said they are being interrogated to find out whether they had any links with the five killers.

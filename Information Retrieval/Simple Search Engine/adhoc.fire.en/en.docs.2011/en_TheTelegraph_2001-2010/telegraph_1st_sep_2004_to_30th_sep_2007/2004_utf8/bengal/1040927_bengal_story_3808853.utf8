 Calcutta, Sept. 26: At long last, the government appears to have realised that the state has a tourism potential and the industry can be pivotal in revitalising rural economy. 

 Eco-tourism, beach tourism, tea tourism? new vistas are opening and the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee regime is keen to make the most by itself and involving non-government agencies.

 An advisory committee has been formed to ?ensure better coordination? among departments and agencies and ?quick implementation? of tourism projects.

 ?We have to constantly interact with a number of agencies and other state government departments for any tourism project. So there was a need to bring together all these departments and agencies for implementing a project,? a senior tourism department official said on Sunday.

 The committee headed by the chief minister comprises the tourism minister and the principal secretaries of tourism, forest and public works departments. It also includes representatives of chambers of commerce, the Indian Association of Tour Operators and the Federation of Hotel and Restaurant Association of India. 

 The official said three experts will also be part of the panel. ?We need the non-government agencies for promotion, publicity and other guidelines,? he added. 

 Tourism in Bengal is plagued by various ills.

 The government has failed 

 to develop spots outside a handful like Digha and Darjeeling

 Facilities in the destinations 

 are either poor or do not cater to all strata

 Lack of professionalism 

 in tourist offices and unprofessional promotions that have 

 failed to capture tourists? fancy

 The committee has its task 

 cut out: 

 To recommend strategy 

 to develop tourism

 Suggest ways to develop 

 infrastructure and ensure coordination within government

 Recommend planning, activities 

 and new projects

 Help in the formulation 

 of norms and policy guidelines for tourism-related activities, 

 promotion and publicity in the state and outside

 Mobilising private sector 

 participation

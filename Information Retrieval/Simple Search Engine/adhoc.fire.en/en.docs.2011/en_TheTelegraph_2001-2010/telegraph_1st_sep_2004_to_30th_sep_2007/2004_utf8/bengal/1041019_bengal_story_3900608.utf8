 Leader quits ?pro-rich? CPM

 - Partyman amp; partners put Big Brother in the dock

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Asansol, Oct. 18: Former CPM member of Parliament and Citu leader Haradhan Roy today severed his five-decades-old association with the party saying it has become pro-rich.

 Roy has sent his resignation to state CPM secretary Anil Biswas and the CPM?s Burdwan chief, Amal Halder. 

 ?After serving the party for 50 years I found that I had no other option but to quit because the CPM I knew had changed. The party no longer respects the critical minority view? I am still a believer in communism, but I realise I have no place in the party, which is controlled by contractors and the mafia,? Roy, 80, a prominent trade unionist in the coal belt, said at a news conference.

 His allegations against the party were an echo of those made by veteran leader Benoy Chowdhury, who once described the CPM as a ?party of contractors?.

 Known to be close to Jyoti Basu, he had been clashing with the CPM leadership and the government on issues like privatisation of coal mines. 

 Roy criticised the Bhattacharjee government, which is ?serving the rich and the trading community by ignoring the rights of the working class and the poor?. He also accused minister Bansagopal Chowdhury and party MP Bikash Chowdhury of ?siding with the coal mafia?.

 He said he would now work for miners and workers through the new Sara-Bharat Koyla Khani and Khani Anchal Banchao Committee, a non-political organisation. 

 In Calcutta, Biswas said the CPM has terminated the membership of Roy, ?who had been speaking against the party for the past 20 years?.

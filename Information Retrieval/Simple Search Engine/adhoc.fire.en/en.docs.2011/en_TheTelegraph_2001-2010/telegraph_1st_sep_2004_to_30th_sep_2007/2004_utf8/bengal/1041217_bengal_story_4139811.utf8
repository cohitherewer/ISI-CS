 Voice switches on radio romance 

 OUR BUREAU

 Dec. 16: When Sanyasi Burman recited Rabindranath Tagore?s Kalo Meye on radio six months ago, he won over an admirer at Mayureswar in Birbhum.

 Jayanti Biswas was so enamoured of Sanyasi?s voice that she got his phone number from the All India Radio office. The two were writing letters to each other till the Class XII student called him over to her house. 

 The 19-year-old boy from Nakashipara in Nadia, about 130 km from Calcutta, is blind since he was two and has travelled across the district to recite and perform in plays. 

 His father Ganesh, an affluent farmer, said Jayanti invited Sanyasi to her home a month ago. ?Ten days ago, he left for Mayureswar without telling his parents.?

 Wearing dark glasses, he knocked on Jayanti?s door and introduced himself. The girl, who had by then come to know that he was blind, introduced him as a friend to her parents.

 After about an hour?s chat, she told her father Adhir Biswas, a trader, that she was going to see him off at the station and did not return. 

 Adhir went to police the next day and lodged a complaint saying that she went missing with a boy who claimed to be from Nakashipara and blind. 

 Two days ago, the police found Jayanti at Sanyasi?s house. The boy and girl were married. 

 An officer said the girl told them that she was impressed by his sense of culture and married him five days ago. ?As they are both above 18, we cannot do anything about it,? said the Nadia additional superintendent of police.

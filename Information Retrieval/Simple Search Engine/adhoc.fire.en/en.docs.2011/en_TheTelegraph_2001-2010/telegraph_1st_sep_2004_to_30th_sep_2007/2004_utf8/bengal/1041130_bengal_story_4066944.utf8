 Project bonanza for Burdwan

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Burdwan, Nov. 29: Burdwan town and its adjoining areas are being showered with development projects worth Rs 600 crore. 

 The bonanza is the biggest in the 400-year history of the town, the administrative centre of Bengal?s Rice Bowl. 

 ?We have taken up these projects (see chart) as a first step to restore some order in an otherwise unplanned town. These projects will help take some load off the heavily congested town. They will also provide housing and employment opportunities,? said industry minister Nirupam Sen. He also heads the Burdwan Development Authority (BDA). 

 The development authority had invited expressions of interest for the projects and handed them to those who agreed to abide by its conditions. The implementing agencies will fund the projects. 

 The biggest of the lot is a Rs 500-crore satellite township with houses for about 40,000 people, government offices, a fire brigade station, a police station, a higher secondary school and shopping malls. 

 BDA officials said the township will come up on 257 acres at Goda, about 5 km from the centre of Burdwan town. It will be constructed by Bengal Shrachi and is expected to be ready in five years. 

 The BDA has provided land at Rs 17,000 per acre to Bengal Shrachi and will take a percentage of the profit. 

 Two bus and truck terminals with modern infrastructure like motels, weigh bridge, petrol pumps and pay-and-use toilets will come up at two ends of the town ? Nababhat and Alisha ? at a cost of Rs 60 crore. Vehicles headed out of Bengal will berth in Nababhat and those bound for Calcutta can stop at Alisha. Each terminal will have a capacity of 200 trucks and buses . 

 The Nababhat project has been given to the Burdwan-based Srijoni Shilpa Samabay Samity while the one at Alisha will be set up by the Calcutta-based Khadim Constructions. They will pay Rs 2 crore to the BDA in three years as also a percentage of profits. 

 Finally, a Rs 34-crore project to beautify and develop the court, the collectorate and its surrounding areas. The century-old buildings belonged to the royal family and will be restored by Dhiraj Promoters of the B.P. Poddar group. 

 ?They will raise the money they spend by promoting several market complexes, parking zones and residential complexes,? said Subrata Gupta, BDA executive officer.

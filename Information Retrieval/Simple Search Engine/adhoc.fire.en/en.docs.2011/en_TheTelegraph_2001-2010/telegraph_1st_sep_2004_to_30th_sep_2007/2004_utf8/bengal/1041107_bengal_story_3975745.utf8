 Bangla bandh

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Nov. 6: The SUCI has called a 24-hour Bangla Bandh on November 17 to protest against the hike in fuel prices.

 The SUCI decided to call the bandh in Bengal as the ruling CPM had supported the central government?s decision to increase the prices of petrol, diesel and cooking gas, SUCI state secretary Provash Ghosh said here today.

 ?Crores of poor and middle-class people will be at the receiving end (of the hike in fuel prices),? said Ghosh.

 The CPI(ML) Liberation echoed the SUCI by calling for a 12-hour bandh in the state on the issue on November 22.

 ?It is unfortunate that some Left parties have a secret understanding with the Centre and are putting the pressure of a hike in prices on the poor and middle-class,? said Kartik Pal, the Bengal state secretary of the organisation.

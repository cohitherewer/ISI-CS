 Buddha vows to light up villages

 AMIT UKIL

 Mukutmonipur/Taldangra (Bankura), Sept. 4: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today announced that several hundred villages in the backward areas of Bankura, Purulia and West Midnapore will have electricity by the end of 2006.

 We have excess power in the state. Often at night, we sell electricity to other states. But several of our villages are still in the dark, he pointed out.

 We have taken steps to resolve this problem. A Rs 38-crore project will bring electricity to all the villages in the region in two years, Bhattacharjee said at two public meetings he addressed during the day here.

 However, within 15 minutes of his convoy leaving Bankura town for Durgapur, the district capital was plunged into darkness for more than an hour. Even in the district headquarters in Purulia and West Midnapore, an evening power cut has almost become a daily routine.

 Bhattacharjee also promised mid-day meals at all village schools in the state in a year. We must get the 14 lakh children in Bengal to go to school. The main strength of a nation is 100 per cent literacy. We have achieved 70 per cent, he said.

 As it is the children of poor families who dont go to school, we have exempted them from paying fees or for their books. Now, a hot afternoon meal will be given.

 The chief ministers first engagement was to inaugurate a Eklabya Residential Model School for tribal children at Mukutmonipur.

 He reiterated his promises at Taldangra, 28 km south of Bankura town and about 190 km west of Calcutta.

 The chief minister said, while inaugurating a three-day 13th district DYFI sammelan, that the government had set up a committee to ensure that tribal villagers, including Sabars, get a minimum price for their kendu leaves and babui grass.

 Advani entry brings knives out in Bengal

 Calcutta, Oct. 21: A section 

 of Bengal BJP leaders, including former Union minister Tapan 

 Sikdar, has appealed to party president L .K. Advani for 

 a change of guard in the state unit.

 Sikdar and his colleagues ? buoyed by Advani?s appointment to the top party post ? said there is nothing wrong about briefing the president about the ?prevailing malaise? in the state unit.

 ?The BJP in Bengal has virtually become non-functional these days as those at the helm have stopped lining up movements against the ruling communists. There are several issues on which we can grill the government,? said Sikdar just hours before leaving for Delhi.

 The party suffered ?humiliating defeats? ? both in the 2003 panchayat elections and the Lok Sabha polls ? because of ?poor organisational network?, Sikdar said.

 The former Union minister, who was twice president of the BJP?s Bengal unit in the eighties, is known for his strained relations with the present chief, Thathagata Roy.

 Sikdar and his associates, including former vice-president Muzaffar Khan and former general secretary Pratap Banerjee, have been sidelined in the party since Roy took over as state unit chief in November 2002, six months after M. Venkaiah Naidu was appointed national president.

 Fearing criticism from the party?s apex leadership following the shuffle in Delhi, the state BJP leadership has overnight lined up a string of programmes to highlight the Left Front?s ?anti-people policies?. ?From next month onwards, we shall launch a sustained movement across Bengal on infiltration and other issues, including the law and situation,? Roy said.

 The state chief denied moves to dislodge him. ?Anybody in the party can go to Delhi to meet Advaniji. But we shall continue to be at the helm until new arrangements are made,? he said.

 BJP sources said a change of guard in the state BJP is imminent before the elections to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, slated for next year.

 ?Though I am not involved in the day-to-day affairs of the party because of my preoccupation with the all-India Haj committee, we are confident that the Bengal unit will get rejuvenated under Advaniji?s leadership,? said Khan.

 There were also some ill tidings for the BJP. Muslim leaders in Mamata Banerjee?s Trinamul Congress have decided to urge the party chief to sever ties with the party.

 ?I want Mamata to party ways with the BJP immediately. We fear that Muslims across the country will suffer more in the coming days if Advani puts forward his aggressive Hindutva policies,? said Trinamul minority-cell leader Sultan Ahmed.

 Samsuzamman Ansari, a mayor-in-council member, said Muslims will desert Mamata if she stays with the BJP with Advani at the helm.

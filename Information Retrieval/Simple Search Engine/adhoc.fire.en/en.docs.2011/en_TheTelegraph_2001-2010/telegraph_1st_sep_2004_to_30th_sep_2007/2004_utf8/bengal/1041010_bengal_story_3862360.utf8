 Flyover flood

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Oct. 9: It?s ?technically impossible?, yet it happened. Wednesday night?s downpour left a stretch of the 2.448-km AJC Bose Road flyover waterlogged. 

 ?Let the flood spell be completely over, and we?ll want to know from the agencies concerned what led to the waterlogging. There must have been some clogging somewhere?,? said finance minister Asim Dasgupta before leaving for Murshidabad, where the situation is still far from normal. 

 ?The information came to us early in the morning, and we coordinated with officials of the Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners (the implementing agency of the flyover) and saw to it that the drains of the flyover were cleared by 1.30 pm on Thursday,? said transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury, adding that the drains had become clogged. 

Water conference

 Calcutta will host a national conference on water quality on October 14. Officials said the two-day meet, jointly organised by the Union ministry of water resources and the state public health department, will discuss threadbare the surface and ground water quality of the country.

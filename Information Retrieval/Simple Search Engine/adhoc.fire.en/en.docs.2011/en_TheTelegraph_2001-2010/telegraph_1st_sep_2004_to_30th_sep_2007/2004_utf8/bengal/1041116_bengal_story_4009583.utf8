 Lewd soldiers arrested

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Durgapur, Nov. 15: Six more India Reserve Battalion jawans were arrested this evening for rioting and lewd behaviour in a residential complex here.

 Deputy inspectors-general K.C. Meena and T. Raju will carry out a joint inquiry into the incident and recommend action against the jawans who attacked residents of Bidhannagar Government Housing yesterday morning and the night before for objecting to their conduct during a soiree and pushing them out of the complex.

 The shocked neighbourhood today started a signature campaign demanding immediate transfer of the jawans. 

 ?We will submit the memorandum to home secretary Amit Kiran Deb as our repeated complaints to the battalion bosses against the indecent behaviour of the jawans have gone unheeded,? said R.K. Saha Roy, a resident of adjacent MAMC Colony and a CPM local committee secretary. 

 On Saturday, drunk jawans armed with hockey sticks and cricket bats had beaten up residents, pulled down the dais bringing the soiree to an end, smashed windowpanes and vehicles and allegedly molested women. The next morning, some of them attacked the residents at a local market. Five jawans were detained yesterday and one of them was arrested.

 A police picket has been posted at the housing complex.

 CPM drive to weed out ?corruption?

 OUR BUREAU

 Dec. 12: The CPM today dropped over half-a-dozen key functionaries from the new Burdwan and Nadia district committees, apparently in a bid to purge corrupt elements.

 Mehboob Zahedi, the MP from Katwa and a former minister, Benoy Chakraborty, the chairman of the Small Industries Development Corporation, and Harish Kar, former minister Anju Kar?s husband, were dropped for their involvement in ?anti-party activities? in Burdwan. 

 In Nadia ? where state CPM secretary Anil Biswas oversees the party organisation ? four prominent leaders, including former zilla parishad chief Radhanath Biswas, were ousted after being similarly charged.

 Unable to find a place in the committee, all four leaders walked out of the district conference today. Party functionaries said the walkout was ?unprecedented? and went against the party?s ?discipline?.

 The conference in Krishnagar town witnessed a furore when a section of delegates, including Biswas, demanded a discussion on the involvement of Avtar Singh ? husband of local MP Jyotirmoyee Sikdar ? in a sex racket that allegedly operated from his Salt Lake hotel. 

 Avtar was arrested on August 15 and the incident was a major embarrassment for Alimuddin Street. 

 Mridul Dey, a state secretariat member, thwarted the discussion saying an inquiry was pending. ?There will be no discussion other than on political matters,? he is learnt to have told the delegates. 

 Though CPM leaders claimed in Burdwan that Zahedi was dropped on health grounds, insiders said he often left the party red-faced by making ?irresponsible statements?. They also said that Kar and Chakraborty were dropped on charges of corruption. Complaints from party workers regarding their alleged nexus with realtors and contractors had reached the party office. 

 In Nadia, Radhanath Biswas said: ?I am yet to know on what grounds I was denied a berth in the new district committee. I will seek a clarification from the district secretary.?

 Addressing an open session of the conference in Burdwan, Jyoti Basu warned the party against ?corrupt elements?. He said: ?...Many anti-social elements have infiltrated into the party. They have to be driven out... Those gone astray must be given a chance to rectify. But if they refuse to change, they must be expelled.?

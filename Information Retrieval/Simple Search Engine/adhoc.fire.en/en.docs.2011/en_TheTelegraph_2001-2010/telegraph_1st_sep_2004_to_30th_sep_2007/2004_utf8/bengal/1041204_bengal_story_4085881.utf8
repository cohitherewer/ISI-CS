 Malaria deaths

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Suri, Dec. 3: Six people have died of malaria and at least 50 people have been diagnosed with the disease in the past fortnight in Mohammad Bazar block of Rampurhat. 

 The Birbhum chief medical officer of health, Shyamapada Basak, said all six died of malignant malaria ? three of them at Suri District Hospital, two at Rampurhat Subdivisional Hospital and one at home. 

 ?We have sent medical teams to the affected villages and tested blood samples of 300 people suffering from high fever and shivering frequently. So far, 50 samples have tested positive for malaria,? said Basak.

 District health officials said it was initially thought that the six who died were afflicted with meningitis. But blood tests revealed malignant malaria. They said reports of high fever with shivers are mostly pouring in from Garia, Atarua, Salbadra and neighbouring villages in Rampurhat Block-I.

 Those who died were Mary Mardi, 34, Moni Mardi, 17, Chunda Soren, 19, Digambar Mardi, 45, Laltu Sheikh, 11, and Mahadeb Murmu. Health officials have started a malaria prevention campaign in the affected areas. Villagers have been asked to use mosquito nets and watch out against stagnant water.

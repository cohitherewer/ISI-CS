 Bill to protect water

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Burdwan, Nov. 16: The government will table a bill in the winter session of the Assembly restricting indiscriminate drawing of ground water.

 ?After the bill is enacted, drawing of groundwater ? be it for domestic or commercial use or irrigation ? will not be allowed without permission from the state water investigation directorate. Anyone found violating the norm would be punished. The details of the punishment will form part of the bill,? water resources development minister Nanda Gopal Bhattacharya said today. 

 The legislation is meant to ensure conservation of depleting groundwater levels. 

 The minister refused to divulge details of the bill, but said: ?Our aim is to prevent over-extraction of groundwater and its preservation. The bill will encourage rainwater harvesting.? 

 In the town in connection with a meeting of his party, the CPI, the minister said unscientific irrigation has made the water table in the districts fall. In Calcutta, groundwater has gone down 10 feet below sea level.

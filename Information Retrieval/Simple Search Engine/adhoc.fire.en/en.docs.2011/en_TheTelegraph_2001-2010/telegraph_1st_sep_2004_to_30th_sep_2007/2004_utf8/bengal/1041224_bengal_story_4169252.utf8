 Union stalls ruin search

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Malda, Dec. 23: A trade union today again did something it allegedly does best ? trigger a lock-up.

 Work to unearth the sprawling 500-year-old palace complex at Gour Malda today came to a grinding halt with Intuc leaders locking up the doors of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) office here. Union supporters also sat on a dharna in front of the door demanding that only local labourers be hired for digging out the ruins.

 Funded by the Centre, the ASI was excavating three spots ? the Chika Mosque, the Dakhil Darwaza and the Kotwali Gate. About 70 workers were required for the project and the ASI approached district magistrate Ashok Bala, who advised help from the local Mahadipur gram panchayat. The rural body helped the ASI hire the men. 

 However, district Intuc president Biswanath Guha alleged that the ASI had not employed residents of the area. ?Our demand is simple. The ASI will have to take men from the nine villages surrounding the ruins or we will not allow them to enter the office,? Guha said.

 Bimal Bandyopadhyay, the ASI?s eastern zone director, said: ?We have been facing a lot of hurdles. If this goes on, we will have to pull out.? He added that the work environment was becoming ?insecure? for the ASI employees. ?We have reported instances of theft and there has been no response from the district administration. Unknown people have been dumping stone chips around the site of the excavation, which is very harmful for the preservation of the ruins.?

 Bala said: ?We are treating the development at the ASI office with all importance. As the ASI is not recruiting immediate locals, problems have cropped up.?

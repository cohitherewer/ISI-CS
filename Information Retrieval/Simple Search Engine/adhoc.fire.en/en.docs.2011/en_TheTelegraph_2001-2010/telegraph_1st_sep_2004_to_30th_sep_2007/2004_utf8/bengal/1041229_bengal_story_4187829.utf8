 Coal mafia combat plan

 Durgapur, Dec. 28: Eastern Coalfields, Central Industrial Security Force and Burdwan district authorities today revealed a plan to stop illegal mining in the Asansol belt. 

 Officials said the initiative followed the recent subsidence of land adjacent to the ECL headquarters triggered by illegal mining in abandoned pits. 

 A block-level committee headed by the block development officer and a subdivision-level panel led by the subdivisional officer will keep an eye on coal ?theft?. District magistrate Subrata Gupta said: ?The committees will jointly sit at least once a month.?

 Rafting lure for winter fest

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

Kalimpong, Dec. 25: The second day of the Kalimpong 

Winter Fest-2004 was dedicated to showcase the area?s potential for adventure 

sports.

 Teesta, some 14 km from here, donned the perfect carnival look with hordes of rafters, including 40 students and 30 tourists, took turns in batches of six to put their might against the swirling current.

 Later in the evening, the Mela Grounds came alive with Christmas carols and performances by local bands.

 The rafting expedition was held as part of the winter fest ? organised by residents of the area, with the support of the government and with The Telegraph as the media sponsor. The rafting expedition was inaugurated by Sandip Mathur, the president of the Tourism Youth Forum of India.

 ?It was great,? said Alicia Jordan, a tourist from the UK. ?Such a kind of promotional activity helps attract tourists.? Khokon Mondol of Calcutta could not but agree. ?The rafting expedition was just the best way to battle the winter chill,? he said.

 Tourists were ferried from Kalimpong and back free of cost. As part of the promotional drive, the rafters had to pay only Rs 100 against the normal fee of Rs 350.

 ?We have lined up a couple of adventure-related activities as part of the fest,? said Sandip Jain, the chief co-ordinator of the winter fest.

 Tomorrow will be marked by rock-climbing at Sixth Mile, a guided tour of Kalimpong and a golf tournament.

 A trekking expedition from Algarah to Jhandi Dara has been scheduled for December 29.

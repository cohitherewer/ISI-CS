 Elephant ?sale?

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 21: The government, grappling with the spiralling cost of rearing elephants, has decided to ?sell? them, forest minister Jogesh Barman said today.

 ?We have decided to sell 10 baby elephants. We are encouraging those interested to own elephants to apply to us,? the minister told reporters at Writers? Buildings.

 However, buying or selling elephants is illegal. A senior official of Barman?s department said: ?Under the law, fresh private ownership or buying and selling of elephants is not allowed. The government can exchange them with other zoos and or states and recover the incidental costs.? 

 ?Incidental costs? mean the money the government has spent on bringing up the elephants.

 Barman, who sounded keen to sell the baby elephants, also said that the price tags had not been finalised. He added that they cannot be used for commercial purposes. ?They must be used to promote eco-tourism, so owners must see to it that people?s interest in nature and animals is promoted in the process.? There should be two persons attending to an animal, including the mahout, the minister said. 

 The government has over 70 elephants, which are breeding fast. An official said a lot of money has to be spent on the babies. Elephants cannot be expected to patrol forests, take tourists around and capture wild animals till they are at least eight to 10 years old and about six feet tall.

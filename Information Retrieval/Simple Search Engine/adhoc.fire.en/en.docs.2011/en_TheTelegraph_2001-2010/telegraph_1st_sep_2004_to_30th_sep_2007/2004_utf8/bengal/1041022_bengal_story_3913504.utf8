 Man in net for Puja extortion

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Howrah, Oct. 21: Police have arrested one person this morning on charges of extorting donations for Durga Puja from the drivers of goods vehicles going through Bauria in the district.

 The arrest of Ranjan Pramanik comes a day after organisers of a puja committee in Sankrail in Howrah beat up the owner of a shoe outlet, his wife and son for not contributing Rs 501.

 Tarak Shaw and 12-year-old Dipak are undergoing medical treatment in two separate nursing homes in Andul. The police have arrested five persons and the administration has cancelled the puja.

 ?Shaw and his son will have to be under medical supervision for a few more days,? an official of the Sankrail police station said today.

 The beating up of the Shaw?s was followed by the travails of Sujit Rajak ? another resident of Sankrail. On Monday, Rajak had to undergo an eye operation after being beaten up for not contributing Rs 200 for the festivities. Police later arrested six persons.

 The Howrah police superintendent, Mihir Kumar Bhattacharya, said there were complaints of trucks being stopped to extort money.

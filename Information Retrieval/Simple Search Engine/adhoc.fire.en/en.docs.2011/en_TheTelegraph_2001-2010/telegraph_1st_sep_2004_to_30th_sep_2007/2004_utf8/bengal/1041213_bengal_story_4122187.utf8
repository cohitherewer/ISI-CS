 Taekwondo on a new high 

 DEBASISH CHATTOPADHYAY

 Calcutta, Dec. 12: Taekwondo is looking for a toehold in the city of crazy cricket lovers and football fanatics.

 Though introduced in Calcutta as early as 1975, the martial art form has begun going up the popularity charts only recently.

 ?The martial art hinges on movement of both legs and hands and helps a person keep physically fit while at the same time relieving stress. Perhaps this is the reason why we have people aged from four to 60 showing up at the training centres,? said Sunil Goel, the vice-president of the Bengal Taekwondo Association.

 Taekwondo enthusiasts in the state are gearing up for their biggest annual event, the 16th state Taekwondo championship, organised by the association. Altogether, 350 boys and girls from Calcutta and the districts are practising hard for the two-day event that will commence at Khudiram Anushilan Kendra from tomorrow.

 ?We had not imagined that within such a short period it would draw so many enthusiasts,? said Goel. A number of city schools have become the platform for the martial art.

 With over 6,000 registered members from 15 districts, the association is affiliated to the Bengal Olympic Association and the Taekwondo Federation of India. It has produced more than 125 black belts and 25 national referees.

 ?To master the art, one has to spend a lot of time in practice. This takes a toll on my study time, but what I am learning is important. Moreover, it is the ideal way for women to defend themselves,? said Sunita Singh, a post-graduate student of Calcutta University.

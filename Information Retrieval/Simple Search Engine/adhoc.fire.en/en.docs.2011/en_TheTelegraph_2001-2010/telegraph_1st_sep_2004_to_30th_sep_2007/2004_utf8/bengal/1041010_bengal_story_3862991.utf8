 No-parking bribe blow

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Oct. 9: A departmental inquiry has been slapped on a traffic constable and his annual increment put on hold after he was allegedly found to have taken a bribe of Rs 20 to let a businessman park his car in a no-parking zone. 

 Police said the allegation was made a couple of days ago when the constable was on duty on Brabourne Road. 

 ?Another constable noticed it and he informed his officers. In a prompt action, the officer-in-charge of traffic guard, Saroj Roy Chowdhury, conducted an investigation and submitted his findings to (traffic police deputy commissioner Arun) Sharma,? said an official of the traffic department.

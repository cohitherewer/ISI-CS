 Calcutta, Sept. 18: A spectacle, a treat, a cracker! Only some of the words that participants and the audience used to describe the finals of The Telegraph Open Quiz Show (TOPS). The Science City auditorium was packed to capacity today to witness a great contest, and the crowd wasn?t disappointed with the show that was put on. 

 Be it the sounds of Bhoomi kicking off the first round or models sashaying in saris in between, right up to the grand finale featuring College Street?s Mahboob Band, there was entertainment aplenty amid some serious quizzing. The event was co-sponsored by Royal Challenge Golf Accessories. 

 Five teams were chosen from around 500. They joined the regional winners of Guwahati and Jharkhand and a guest team on stage for the finals, hosted by Derek ?Brien. Q Junkies ? comprising a student (Nagesh Rajan), a doctor (Soubhadra Chakraborty) and an architect (Kinshuk Biswas) ? emerged on top, taking home goodies worth over a lakh. Runner-up was the special invitation team of IPS Sanjoy Mukherjee, Atri Bhattacharya of WBIDC and Jayashree Pohankar of Eveready, followed by DIA. 

 A name-as-you-like resulted in teams with as interesting titles as the quiz itself ? Amen (for the only all-girl team), No Chokers and Q Junkies? Eight teams turned to six and then to four as the quiz progressed. The battle eventually went down to the wire and like the best of quizzes, only the final question of the evening on the buzzer (?how many feet would 168 cm make?) decided the winner.

 There were surprises for the audience, too. During one of the rounds, the quizmaster did not have the answer with him. Each of the audience members had to reach below the chair and fish out a strip of paper. Only one of them contained the right answer. The winning strip holder got a prize, as did several others for answering questions that the teams missed. 

 A sampling of the questions: Which US president was featured a record 55 times on the cover of Time? Richard Nixon. 

 What was speedster Brett Lee advised by Carl Lewis to do to rectify his bowling action? Run blindfolded.

 Bhoomi members joined in the quizzing fun by offering their own posers. Identifying one of their instruments (answer: jingle bells) was the first question of the evening. Another asked which characters appear in what order in their hit Tomar Dekha Nai.

 The evening had its poignant moments, too. The felicitation of Neil ?Brien moistened quite a few eyes, as the grand old man of quizzing in Calcutta received a standing ovation. ?It feels wonderful to be honoured in such a way for the little contribution I?ve made to quizzing,? said Neil ?Brien, after being presented with an uttoriyo and a memento. 

 He was inducted into the quiz hall of fame for being the pioneer in quizzing, long before ?quizzing had become popular on television?, as son Derek pointed out.

 The bad news was that the entertainment and the action had to stop. The good news: TOPS will be back next year.

 FIR peep into CPM infighting 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Sankrail (West Midnapore), 

 Oct. 27: Bitter factionalism in the CPM came to light 

 with the sabhapati of a party-controlled panchayat samity 

 lodging an FIR against her party colleagues, accusing them 

 of harassing her and threatening her to quit. 

 Manorama Patra charged several party activists of holding a rally and shouting slogans against her. ?They also threatened to beat me up if I didn?t submit my resignation,? she said in the FIR. 

 She also alleged that party workers destroyed her sugarcane crop twice. Two persons have been arrested. 

 CPM sources said Patra is close to Murari Dutta, the party?s Sankrail zonal committee secretary. Another CPM faction led by Badal Rana, secretary of the party?s Kulitkiri local committee, is reportedly masterminding the attacks on Patra.

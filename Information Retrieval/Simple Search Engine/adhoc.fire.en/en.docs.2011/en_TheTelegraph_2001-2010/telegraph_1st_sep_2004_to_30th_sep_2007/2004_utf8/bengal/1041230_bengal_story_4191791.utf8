 Hope for IIT student

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Kharagpur, Dec. 29: The IIT authorities here today offered hope to Ravi Raj, the student who was suspended after being accused of selling clippings of a sex video of two Delhi schoolchildren on an online auction portal. 

 ?The matter will be dealt with sympathetically by the three-member disciplinary committee if Raj makes an application requesting that his suspension be withdrawn,? said V.R. Kalvey, dean of students? affairs at the IIT. 

 The geophysics student was picked up by Delhi police officials from the IIT campus on December 14. He has been released on bail. 

 According to IIT officials, the next semester starts on January 3 and the authorities are anxious to wrap up the matter so that Raj does not lose out on study time.

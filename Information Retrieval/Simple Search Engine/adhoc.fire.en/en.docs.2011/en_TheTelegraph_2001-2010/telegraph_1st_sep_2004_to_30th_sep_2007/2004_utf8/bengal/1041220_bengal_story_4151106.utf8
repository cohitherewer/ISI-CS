Praveen Kumar, the North 24-Parganas superintendent of police, said: ?All seven together robbed the family of Rajendra Agarwal on November 2. During interrogation, Tinku Rai, 18, and his brother Pintu, 20, who were arrested from Salt Lake, told us that their father, Chandra Bahadur, is posted in Tripura as a BSF inspector.?

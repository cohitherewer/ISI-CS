 Darjeeling, Dec. 26: Winter has arrived in this hill resort and so have tourists thirsting for the chill thrill.

 The mercury today stood a degree above freezing and the search for the ultimate ?chilled out? experience seemed to have come close to a climax. Most hotels are booked to capacity well into the second week of January and shops are doing brisk business catering to woollen-wrapped visitors .

 ?We hardly conduct much business during the winters, but this year the number of tourists has increased by around 20 per cent compared to last year,? said Dinesh Sharma of Central Resort Fortune. Subarna Rai of Windamere, the first hotel in east India to be classified ?heritage?, said winter business has always been good. ?We have regular clients.? 

 If the hoteliers had a smile on them, so had the tourists. Satish Prasad, who came from Mumbai, said: ?The cold is exciting. All that I am hoping for now is some snow.?

 The off-season boom, however, has meant the end of lean-period discounts and a spanner on budget holidays.

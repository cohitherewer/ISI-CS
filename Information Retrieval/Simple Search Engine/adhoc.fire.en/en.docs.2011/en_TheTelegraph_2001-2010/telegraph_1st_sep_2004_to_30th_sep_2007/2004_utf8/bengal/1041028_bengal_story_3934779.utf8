 Mamata forbids Cong links 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Calcutta, Oct. 27: Mamata Banerjee today warned party functionaries, particularly some MLAs and mayor-in-council members of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, against hobnobbing with the state Congress. 

 The Trinamul Congress chief conveyed her displeasure following a report that over a dozen councillors, mayor-in-council members and legislators are secretly negotiating with state Congress leaders their possible return to the party. She also resented mayor Subrata Mukherjee?s interaction with Congress leader Somen Mitra during the Pujas. 

 At Mamata?s instance, the leadership has asked Pradip Ghosh, MIC health, to rejoin the Congress publicly by resigning from the corporation. ?Enough is enough. We have heard a lot about Ghosh threatening to rejoin the Congress. It is better if he returns to the Congress,? said Trinamul youth leader Sanjoy Bakshi.

 Ghosh ducked a straight answer on whether he will move, saying ?all is not well with the Trinamul Congress these days?. 

 The Congress has hinted that all those dumping Mamata will be rewarded with tickets in the forthcoming elections.

 Effort there, effect to see

 OUR BUREAU

 Dec. 2: Arrangements to ensure normal traffic on tracks and roads are in place across Bengal. 

 Special forces are being deployed to keep an eye on railway tracks and roads. ?We will maintain normality, at any cost. We will not allow bandh supporters to obstruct roads or railway tracks,? said Akhil Roy, the Birbhum superintendent of police.

 The authorities stepped up efforts to negate the shutdown call after the high court declared tomorrow?s 12-hour bandh ?illegal? and issued instructions to ensure normal life. 

 Apart from the state police, Government Railway Police (GRP) and Railway Protection Force (RPF) jawans will be deployed to keep railway lines free of obstruction. ?We will straightaway arrest those who try to squat on the tracks or roads leading to stations,? said Nabarun Bhattacharya, the superintendent of railway police, Sealdah division.

 But reports indicated that shopkeepers and traders are reluctant to roll up their shutters. 

 Traders in Murshidabad said they ?never? keep shops open during bandhs. ?We don?t want to take chances. This time, we are more scared because of the court order and Mamata Banerjee?s challenge to make the bandh a success,? said Prasanta Bagchi, the secretary of the local chamber of commerce. Traders in several other districts echoed Bagchi.

 Mriganka Maity, the secretary of the West Midnapore Bus Owners? Association, said: ?We have told members that they can ply buses at their own risk.? 

 Schools and colleges will remain open under instruction from the administration. However, teachers said the authorities would be helpless if students do not turn up.

 Darjeeling superintendent of police Rajeev Mishra said: ?Extra policemen will be deployed at some pockets in Siliguri. Mobile patrols will also be pressed into service.? Two platoons of the State Armed Police and a Rapid Action Force platoon will be deployed. 

 Several organisations are going ahead with tomorrow?s World Disabled Day programmes.

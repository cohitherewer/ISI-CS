 BRIEFS

 Burdwan, Sept. 3: The government today closed down the blood bank of Katwa Subdivisional Hospital for not conducting proper tests before giving out pouches for transfusion. 

 Director of health services Prabhakar Chatterjee said: It is of top-most priority to ensure that the blood being transfused is safe. We will see after three weeks what measures the bank has taken to improve performance. The blood bank used to provide the hospital, 180 km from Calcutta, about 600 pouches a month. 

 Midnapore: Tribals angry over two runovers on Thursday evening blocked the road connecting Goaltore and Midnapore on Friday and attacked police with bows and arrows. A truck had crushed Malati Hansda, 22, and Binoy Hembrom, 20, at Debagram, about 175 km from Calcutta. Armed personnel have been posted in the area described as tense.

 Suri: Somnath Das, a Class III student, hanged himself at a village in Nanoor, 200 km from Calcutta. The family said he could have been trying to enact Dhananjoy Chatterjees hanging.

 BRIEFS

 Durgapur, Aug. 31: Rintu Ghosh, a Class XI student, was found with his head severed by the railway tracks near here this morning.

 The son of a Durgapur Projects Ltd employee, Rintu was apparently killed and thrown under Gammon Bridge, 200 km from Calcutta. Early investigations suggested the murder could be a fallout of a love triangle. The cousin of the girl Rintu was going around with has been arrested. 

 Calcutta: A seven-year-old girl was hit by a taxi speeding down Lockgate flyover near its crossing with BT Road on Tuesday evening, hours after it was commissioned. Police said the accident took place on the approach road, which engineers had termed faulty. The girl was rushed to hospital.

 Bolpur: Despite the bail from high court, former Visva-Bharati vice-chancellor Dilip Sinha could not be released from Bolpur Jail on Tuesday as the papers did not arrive here.

 Calcutta: The entrance tests for admission to classes VI and IX in sainik schools for the 2005-2006 session will be held on January 9. The examinations would be held in Calcutta, Burdwan, Siliguri and Purulia. Application forms have to be sent by November 30.

 Dirty dozen dropped for ragging

 Chinsurah, Oct. 8: A dozen students of Hooghly Institute of Technology, including two girls, have been suspended for ragging a junior, the college principal said today.

 At the state-run engineering college here, Shayari Majumdar, a first-year electrical engineering student, was forced to kiss a senior boy on August 3. The accused, who were part of the SFI-controlled students? union, also forced her to consume alcohol and smoke.

 Principal Ashoke K. Dey said: ?Our step will help stop ragging in our institution.?

 A college official added: ?We had submitted a report to the technical education department, which asked us to suspend the 12 students for the 2004-?05 academic year.?

 Shayari had lodged a complaint with police naming, among others, union general secretary Surajit Lahiry. 

 In another incident, Visva-Bharati today promised action against four post-graduate students accused of ragging.

 BRIEFS

 Jalpaiguri, Dec. 20: Two-year-old Laxmi Raut and 14-year-old Yuvraj died this morning after a piece of metal the boy had rummaged out of box stashed in a corner of their house exploded.

 In the labour lines of Kerbala tea garden in here, the children lived in neighbouring rooms. Yuvraj?s mother Mitthi said she had ?brought the funny-looking metal object home from the jungle a year ago? and forgotten about it. It was a mortar shell.

 Calcutta: A day after cracking down on 472 online lottery outlets run by a host of retailers, including Playwin and Super Lotto, the government initiated cases against 11 agencies in seven districts. ?We are going to move against the company directors, agents, distributors and others associated for violating the West Bengal Lottery (Regulation) Act, 1998,? said Chayan Mukherjee, inspector-general of police (law and order). Raids on online lottery counters continued across the state on Monday. City police said it came in the wake of findings that lottery laws were being violated. The act specifies an online lottery should be held only once a week with no more than six bumper draws in a calendar year. 

 Calcutta: Former footballer Chuni Goswami has been appointed the new sheriff of Calcutta. Goswami will succeed cardiologist Sadhan Chandra Roy, whose term expires on December 31. 

 Midnapore: Three bombs were found in Contai Subdivisional Jail in two days. Preliminary investigation revealed that a section of prisoners had smuggled them into the jail, 150 km from Calcutta, with the help of prison staff.

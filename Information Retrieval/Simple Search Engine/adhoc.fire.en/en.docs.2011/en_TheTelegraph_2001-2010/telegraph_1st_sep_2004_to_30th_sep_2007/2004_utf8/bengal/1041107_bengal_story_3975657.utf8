 Drug cuffs on siblings 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Nov. 6: Two siblings were arrested from Watgunge in Kidderpore with 400 gm of brown sugar. 

 Acting on a tip-off, police laid a trap for 20-year-old Parveen Begum and her brother, Ayub, who were waiting in Watgunge Street for a buyer. 

 ?We were looking for the receiver of the packet. When no one came, we did not want to take a risk,? said an official of Watgunge police station.

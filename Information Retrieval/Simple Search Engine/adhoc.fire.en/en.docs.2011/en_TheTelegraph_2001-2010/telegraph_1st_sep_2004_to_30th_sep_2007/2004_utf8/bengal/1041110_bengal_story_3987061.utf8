 Rollback pressure

 Calcutta, Nov. 9: Left leaders led by state CPM secretary Anil Biswas today criticised the Manmohan Singh government for the hike in fuel prices.

 ?The prices have been raised thrice even before the United Progressive Alliance government has completed six months. They (the Centre) did not consult us before taking a decision,? said Biswas, adding that ?if they take our support for granted, they are mistaken?.

 At a Left Front rally at the Rani Rashmani Road intersection, Biswas also said: ?We shall not keep silent if they take decisions on crucial issues without talking to us.? 

 CPI leader D. Raja said the Left parties would seek a total rollback of the raise. 

 Footballers? bail

 After nine days in custody, footballers Sasthi Duley and Dipankar Roy were granted bail by the high court today.

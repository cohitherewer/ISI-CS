 Trek trail fear factor

 ANURADHA SHARMA LAKHOTIA

 Siliguri, Oct. 3: Terror has turned a trekking trail taboo.

 Sandakphu is starving in the shadow of the Maoist menace as trekkers steer clear of the hikers? haven in search of newer, more peaceful trails.

 ?We had 11 bookings on the Sandakphu route. They were all cancelled as news of the 22-year-old Indian being gunned down by the Royal Nepal Army at Pashupatinagar spread,? said a tour operator here.

 Sandakphu?s claim to fame ? the 33-km trail criss-crosses India and Nepal ? has proved to be its undoing. The hike, which starts from Maneybhanjyang, runs parallel to the international border and at places, like the stretch between the denuded peak Phalut and Kalapokhri, it is impossible to know which side is India and which Nepal.

 Though tour operators said they were being swamped by queries about trek routes post-monsoon, they added that there were almost no takers for Sandakphu. 

 ?An unbeatable panorama of peaks and infrastructure, unlike on most more recently-opened routes, make trekking on the Sandakphu trail a pleasure. The deterrent, however, is the frequency of strikes on the other side of the border. Free movement is not allowed after a strike. Though tourists have never been attacked, flare-ups between the Maoists and the border authorities have intimidated trekkers,? said tour operator Kaushik Ghosh.

 Foreign tourists, though, have not been scared away. A Darjeeling-based tour operator who specialises in treks, K.K. Gurung, said: ?Foreigners still come, but there are almost no domestic tourists.? 

 However, that does not mean that the trekkers are staying home. ?Sikkim has seen a 20 per cent rise in the number of trekkers this year. The rush is more for routes like the Barshney and the Dzongri-Goecha-la in West Sikkim. Relatively new routes like the Tagiap-la trek and the Green Lake trek are becoming popular,? said Namgyal P. Sherpa, a pioneer trek operator in Sikkim.

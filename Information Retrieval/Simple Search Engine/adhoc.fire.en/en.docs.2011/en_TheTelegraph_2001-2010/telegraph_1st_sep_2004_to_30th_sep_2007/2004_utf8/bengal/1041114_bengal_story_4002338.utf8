 Border tour for students

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Krishnagar, Nov. 13: About a hundred students from Krishnagar will be taken to the India-Bangladesh border by the Border Security Force as part of a public relations exercise tomorrow, Children?s Day. 

 ?We are undertaking an exercise to increase mass contact with residents of border districts. There is a common perception that BSF personnel carry out all types of atrocities in the border areas. We want to change this,? said R.C. Saxena, the BSF deputy inspector-general of the Krishnagar sector. 

 The students from Krishnagar Academy, an English medium school in the heart of the town in Nadia, about 85 km from Calcutta, that has been picked for the pilot project, will be taken to the zero line in buses, along with their teachers, for greater understanding of international borders. 

 Saxena said the effort is the result of an instruction from the Union home ministry. 

 He added that the exercise would continue until all the schools in the district have been covered. 

 The students are excited. ?The moment students came to know about the trip, there was a long queue to enlist for the trip. But I told them only students of Class VIII and above can go because this knowledge will come in handy in their studies and project work,? said principal Subrata Chatterjee. 

 ?I am very excited. For the first time, I will have a glimpse of a foreign country,? said Chaitali Das, echoing feelings of the selected students.

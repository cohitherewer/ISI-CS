 Tech test change on cards at JU

 - New exam system from 2005 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Oct. 2: Jadavpur University has decided to introduce sweeping changes in the examination system of its engineering and technology courses at the undergraduate level. 

 The move, university officials said, is in response to a recent directive of the University Grants Commission asking top educational institutions ? Jadavpur is recognised as one of the five best universities in the country ? to restructure their curriculum and examination system.

 ?Major structural changes are going to take place? from the next academic session, slated to begin from July 2005,? Manoj Mitra, the dean of the university?s engineering and technology faculty, said.

 ?In a recent directive, the UGC has suggested that all our courses should be globally accepted and our proposed structural adjustments in the examination system will take place conforming to the UGC?s suggestions,? he added. 

 Officials said changes in the examination system of all post-graduate courses are already in place. 

 The boards of all the engineering and technology departments at the varsity have been asked to convene meetings to review the existing examination system in their undergraduate courses. They have also been asked to give suggestions to the university authorities as early as possible. 

 The move to alter the examination system was also prompted by the recent revamp of the guidelines for offering engineering and technology courses by the All India Council of Technical Education (AICTE). 

 Mitra said the AICTE ? the apex regulatory body for engineering and technology courses ? has reorganised its guidelines ?with a completely new vision? after a gap of 50 years. ?A restructuring of our examination system is necessary if we are to run our courses conforming to the AICTE?s new guidelines,? he added.

 Many engineering students have also been demanding the introduction of certain changes in the existing examination system. They allege that the system now is ?faulty? and offers no scope for scoring high marks. 

 One of their main demands is that more marks from class tests be taken into consideration while calculating the total score at the end of a semester. At present, a maximum of 30 per cent of the marks scored in class tests is taken into account. As a result, the students say, many of them fail to score more than 80 per cent. 

 Mitra said the students? complaints would be considered when changes are introduced in the examination system next year.

 Doors closed on girl 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Chinsurah, Sept. 7: Madhabi Murmu, an assistant sub-inspector of Bhadreswar police station in Hooghly, allegedly turned away a teenage girl who had been stalked and rescued.

 The police station, about 40 km from Calcutta, had bagged an award for being the best in the state last year. 

 Srabanti Bag, a Class IX student, left her home in Arambagh on August 2 after a quarrel with her father and took a train to Howrah. But she got down at Sheoraphuli station. A youth followed her from there. To avoid him, Srabanti took a train from Sheoraphuli the same evening and got down at Bhadreswar, about 65 km away from home. The stalker was there as well.

 Scared, Srabanti approached a woman waiting on the platform at Bhadreswar. She asked her to go to youths chatting at a nearby teastall. The girl followed the advice. The youths at the teastall bashed up the stalker but let him go. One of the youths, Badal Bhattacharjee, accompanied Srabanti to the local police station. 

 Murmu was on duty when they arrived. Badal urged her to allow Srabanti to stay the night at the police station. She refused. 

 Murmu has been suspended. Hooghly superintendent of police Ajoy Kumar confirmed that she has been dropped and added: An inquiry into her conduct is on.

 The government intends to post at least one woman officer in every police station but, in this case, a woman officer proved to be of no help to a girl in distress. Badal and his friend Bhuttu Chakraborty, an autorickshaw driver, took advantage of Murmus refusal and took the girl to Tarapith, 250 km from Calcutta, and molested her.

 Government Railway Police officer-in-charge of Sainthia Tapas Das rescued Srabanti and arrested Badal, but Bhuttu fled.

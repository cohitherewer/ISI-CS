 Bankura gets a taste of industry

 DEEPANKAR GANGULY

 Calcutta, Nov. 15: For 

 backward Bankura, with virtually no industry, a small steel 

 plant is more like a dream.

 Not after next month, though. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee will flag off the first phase of operations of a Rs 150-crore project promoted by the city-based Concast group near Bankura town, about 230 km from Calcutta .

 Managing director Sanjay Sureka said the plant will employ about 1,500 people by next Puja. It will provide immediate employment to 400 people. He added: ?We will manufacture about 75,000 tonnes of steel when running to capacity.? 

 In phase I, the company has invested Rs 60 crore, including the cost of 125 acres.

 The chief minister?s appeal to invest in backward districts like Bankura apparently prompted the group to set up the plant there. ?I had planned the plant in Dankuni, but the chief minister?s appeal made me change my mind,? Sureka said. 

 The Concast authorities then got in touch with the Bankura zilla parishad, which assured that it would organise water supply for the plant and the road infrastructure. The industry department promised a 40 per cent subsidy on the power bill.

 The mini steel plant is now almost ready but the zilla parishad has failed to supply water and construct the roads on time. The company had to invest an additional Rs 2 crore to lay an 11-km pipeline to bring in water from the Dwarakeshwari river. A 2-km road was built as well.

 Concast, however, is still keen to get the discount on the power bill. ?We need the concession because then we will be able to save about Rs 40 lakh a month,? chief executive A.K. Mukherjee said. 

 ?I have faith in industries minister Nirupam Sen and hope that he will take steps in this regard,? said Sureka.

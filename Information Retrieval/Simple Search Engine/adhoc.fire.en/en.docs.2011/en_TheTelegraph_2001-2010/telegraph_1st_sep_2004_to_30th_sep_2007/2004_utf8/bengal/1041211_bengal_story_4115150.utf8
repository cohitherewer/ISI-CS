 Subhas supports call for bus fare hike 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 10: Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty today echoed bus owners demanding a fare hike and hinted at such a possibility.

 After a meeting with representatives of bus operators? associations, the minister said the demand for a fare hike was justified as they now spend more on fuel. He did not quantify the possible hike.

 After justifying the transporters? demand, Chakraborty urged them not to go for a strike. A section of bus and mini-bus operators have called a strike on December 15 in support of their demand for a fare hike. They want the minimum fare to be Rs 5 and the rise for every subsequent stage Re 1.

 The minimum bus fare now is Rs 3, which goes up by 50 paise after every stage. The minimum mini-bus fare is Rs 3.50 and 50 paise more for each stage thereafter.

 Sadhan Das, the president of the Joint Council, the banner under which the pro-strike bus operators have united, said they would decide on calling it off on December 13. 

 ?We cannot make a commitment right now. The minister has appealed to us. We will discuss it with our members and, if they agree to wait for 15 more days, we will withdraw the strike,? Das said after the meeting with Chakraborty at Writers? Buildings.

 Swarnakamal Saha, the president of the Bengal Bus Syndicate, said: ?The minister has justified our demand and assured us a decision on the hike in a fortnight. To honour the minister, we will not launch any agitation. If the minister?s promise proves hollow, we will go for an indefinite bus and mini-bus strike.?

 Chakraborty later said: ?I heard the bus and mini-bus operators and feel it is necessary to raise fares to cover the operators? losses. 

 ?But I have to discuss the issue with the Left Front partners. The decision should be taken within a fortnight.?

 The minister asked transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury to ensure that no vehicle is denied renewal of permit because of age after the operators alleged that the public vehicles department was refusing to issue fitness certificates for vehicles registered before 1975.

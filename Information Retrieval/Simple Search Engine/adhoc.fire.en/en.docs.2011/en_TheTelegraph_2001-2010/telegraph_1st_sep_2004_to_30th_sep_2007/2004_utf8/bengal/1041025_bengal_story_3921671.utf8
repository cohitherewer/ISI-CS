 CPM trio lynched after raid

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 24: Three men in their 30s, who are said to be CPM supporters, were lynched last night at a South 24-Parganas village after allegedly raiding the house of an SUCI leader, Iran Mollah. 

 The dead were identified as Mobarak Mondal, Mahiruddin Sheikh and Raihan Mollah. Police have detained 10 people from Paschim Radhanagar village in Kultali, about 90 km from the city, for questioning. 

 Around 10 last night, a gang of 15 attacked Iran?s house, said the police. Apparently not sure if Iran was at home, the marauders ransacked his house. When the women tried to stop them, they were dragged out to the courtyard. Neighbours did not dare intervene as a duo brandishing guns and daggers stood guard outside. 

 But once the goons stepped out, the residents rushed out with bamboo sticks and stones. All but three members fled. Within minutes, the mob swelled and the three were beaten with bamboo sticks and iron rods. By the time the police reached, they were lifeless. 

 Local SUCI legislator Prabodh Purakait said Mollah escaped death once earlier. 

 The CPM admitted that the three were its supporters. District secretary Santimoy Bhattacharya said: ?They were trapped by SUCI men, who passed them off as dacoits.?

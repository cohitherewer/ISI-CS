 Bail and backing for Pinki

 Ranaghat, Nov. 25: Promising athlete Pinki Pramanik received interim bail today amid scenes of overwhelming solidarity, from the crowd as well as among the lawyers. 

 The 17-year-old was arrested on Monday from Habibpur in Nadia, 70 km from Calcutta, after a one-shot pistol was found in her bag. She has claimed that the five youth who harassed her planted it in her kit. 

 The smiling sprinter entered the sub-divisional judicial magistrate?s court flanked by a woman constable and came out, smile intact, with her lawyers surrounding her after bail was granted on a Rs 5,000 bond. 

 ?I am the victim of a deep-rooted conspiracy. But at the end of the day, I am grateful to my lawyers, the people of Nadia and the police,? she said. 

 After asking Pinki to find a local guarantor, magistrate D.P. Biswas ruled that she would not be able to leave the country on or before December 8 without the court?s permission. Moreover, she will have to visit the investigating officer of the case once in a week, said assistant public prosecutor Prahlad Paul. 

 Pinki, who arrived on the court premises around 11.30 am, sprinted inside after raising her hand to acknowledge slogans in her favour from a few thousand people assembled there. Inside, her counsel Suvendu Chatterjee moved the bail plea, which was signed by 40 other lawyers. 

 ?Sir please grant her bail, otherwise she won?t be able to run for the country. The police investigation has found no prima facie evidence against the girl. She should be allowed bail,? the lawyers said almost in a chorus. 

 Raja Banerjee, a leading lawyer in the Ranaghat court, then said: ?Sir, what will happen if tomorrow somebody plants a pistol inside the travel kit of Sachin Tendulkar? Will our people believe Tendulkar is a criminal? Police found nothing in their investigation, so we want her release.? 

 At this, Biswas turned to Paul. ?It is true that nothing was found during the two-day police remand that could establish her as a criminal. She was attacked by some ruffians near the Habibpur police station last Sunday. We have proof in her medical report that she was beaten up. She is a promising athlete of our country. So, I am not opposing the bail prayer moved by the defence lawyers,? he said.

 ?Prabir Basu, Pradip Sarkar and Uttam Barui (witnesses) gave their confessional statements to the SDJM in the morning. They told the judge they saw some of the youth put a firearm inside Pinki?s bag on that day (last Sunday). On the basis of such statement and the police report, the SDJM granted interim bail to Pinki,? Paul added.

 Chatterjee later said he would move high court against the restrictions on Pinki?s travel. ?She would have to leave for Australia for the Youth Commonwealth Games on December 30. The order could hamper that. Moreover, how can she visit the investigating officer once a week? We have a Supreme Court ruling in the famous Nandini Sathpathy case where a woman on interim bail is not required to appear before the IO regularly,? said Chatterjee.

 Trinamul gets Anil certificate 

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, Dec. 3: The CPM today did the unthinkable: it complimented Mamata Banerjee, though in a roundabout way, on the ?partial success? of the bandh. 

 The state CPM secretary, Anil Biswas, also said: ?But it will be na?ve to assume that the people who responded to her call supported the issues at stake.? 

 Mamata had called the bandh to protest against the hike in prices of fuel and other essential commodities.

 Biswas said: ?People actually made use of it (the Trinamul bandh) to protest against the growing intervention of the high court in the functioning of political parties.?

 He said there is no denying that the bandh had some impact on life in Calcutta and elsewhere in Bengal. ?But the bandh was uncalled for.?

 The CPM is not known to acknowledge the impact of bandhs called by Opposition parties. ?It?s a flop,? was Biswas? description of the November 17 bandh called by the SUCI. ?Nobody knew there was a bandh today,? he said after the November 22 bandh called by a Naxalite outfit. 

 The CPM response today was a pointer to how the Left leaders are trying to deflect attention from the price hike effected by the ?friendly? Centre and galvanise political parties and their constituencies to join a campaign to counter the court. 

 By describing the bandh as ?a partial success?, Biswas reflected the CPM brass? intention to encourage the main opposition party, the Trinamul Congress, to take on the judiciary. The communists are aware that having been in office for 27 years, they cannot attack the judiciary the way the Opposition can. 

 Moreover, the leaders feel if Trinamul is engaged in a long legal battle, it will work to the CPM?s advantage. 

 A measure of the likely scenario could be had when the CPM and Trinamul, which were making overtures for the past few days, said they would work towards a discussion on how to handle the court?s anti-bandh views.

 Mamata described the CPM moves as ?steps in the right direction to uphold democratic rights?. She added: ?We don?t mind sharing a platform with the CPM...?

 Responding to Mamata?s willingness to chalk out a common strategy, Biswas said: ?We have no objection in talking to her.?

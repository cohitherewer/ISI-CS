 Autonomy quiz for colleges

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Nov. 1: The Centre has shortlisted 32 colleges across Bengal that will have to spell out their views on autonomy.

 A national panel headed by Bengal school education minister Kanti Biswas, set up to examine to what extent higher educational institutions should be allowed independence, will soon send these colleges an eight-page questionnaire. 

 In addition to the colleges, vice-chancellors of all universities in the state will be sent the set of questions.

 Bengal has dragged its feet on granting independence to colleges even as several other states have gone ahead with it. The University Grants Commission had rapped the state for going slow, but with Biswas at the helm of a national panel, the onus is bound to shift to Bengal.

 Biswas said: ?Autonomy in higher education is a burning issue, particularly when foreign institutions are setting up more and more branches in our state and across the country. The central government intends to chalk out a concrete policy on autonomy in higher educational institutions. Before drawing up the plan, the board has decided to seek the opinion of all major institutions.? 

 A meeting of the committee members was held in Delhi on October 25. 

 The Bengal government is still undecided on whether colleges should be given autonomy to run BA, BSc and BCom courses. In the existing system, academic powers like framing syllabi, conducting examinations, appointing teachers and awarding degrees rest with the universities to which the colleges are affiliated.

 Though the UGC has recommended a number of colleges, including Presidency and the St Xavier?s in Calcutta, for autonomous status, the state government?s approval is pending.

 Biswas said UGC has picked 32 colleges out of about 320 in Bengal for the survey. ?A similar exercise will be carried out across the country. Colleges, universities, IITs and IIMs will be sent questionnaires on the issue of autonomy,? he added.

 The minister said the questions will revolve around the scope for the institutions? academic, economic and administrative independence. The colleges will also be asked to give their views on measures the government can take to ensure better interaction with the autonomous institutions.

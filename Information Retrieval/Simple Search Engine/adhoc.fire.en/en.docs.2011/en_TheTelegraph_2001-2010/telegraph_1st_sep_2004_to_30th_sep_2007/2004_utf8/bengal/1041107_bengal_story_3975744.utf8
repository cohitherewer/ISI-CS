 Patient walks out with other?s baby

 ANURADHA SHARMA LAKHOTIA

 Siliguri, Nov. 6: A patient today walked out of Siliguri?s sub-divisional hospital this morning with another woman?s day-old son, casting a cloud on the institution?s security and administration.

 Champa Sarkar had asked Sangeeta Prasad to look after her son as she was going to the toilet. However, when Sarkar returned she found that Prasad, who had been admitted to the hospital after her third miscarriage on November 3, and her baby were missing.

 ?I asked her (Sangeeta) to look after the boy as I was alone with him,? a devastated Sarkar said from her hospital bed.

 ?But when I returned after about three minutes, I found that my baby was missing and so was she. When I went down looking for them, the guard did not let me go out to look for my baby,? she said.

 By the time hospital authorities raised the alarm, the woman was nowhere to be found. To make matters worse, hospital records only have her husband?s name ? Prakash Prasad ? and a vague address at Champasari under Matigara police station.

 Nobody noticed Prasad walking away with the baby ? not even the other patients in the labour ward.

 ?It happened around 6.30 in the morning and we were all asleep. I was woken up by Champa?s loud cry, but by that time both Sangeeta and the baby were gone,? said Sabita Mondol, a patient.

 The child?s father, Biplab Sarkar, who works with a caterer in his hometown in Cooch Behar, wondered how the authorities could allow someone to walk away with a baby without checking the discharge papers. He pointed out that it was not the time for visiting patients and wondered why a woman walking away with a child did not arouse suspicion.

 ?It is an unfortunate incident. It is too early to say where the lapse could have occurred. We are inquiring into the incident,? said hospital superintendent Tapan Saha.

 The atmosphere at the hospital remained tense the whole day with Sarkar?s relatives and patients admitted to the labour ward staging a demonstration demanding action against the guards and hospital staff. The Rapid Action Force, which was called in, resorted to a mild lathicharge to disperse the crowd.

 ?We have asked for a portrait expert from Calcutta to make a sketch of the woman who is said to have stolen the child,? said the Darjeeling superintendent of police, Rajeev Mishra.

 ?We have initiated a thorough search,? said the . 

 The police official, however, ruled out the incident being part of a racket. ?There is no evidence to suggest this,? Mishra said. Preliminary investigations indicate that the woman walked away with the child because of personal attachment, he said.

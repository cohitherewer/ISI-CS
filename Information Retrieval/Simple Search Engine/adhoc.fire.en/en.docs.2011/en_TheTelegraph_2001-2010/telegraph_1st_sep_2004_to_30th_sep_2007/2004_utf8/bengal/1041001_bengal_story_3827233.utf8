 Go-slow after CPM purge

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 30: The CPM today expelled 25 members at a state committee meeting and decided to postpone any further purge till after its 21st state conference at Kamarhati in North 24-Parganas next February. 

 However, it claimed it would not ignore the complaints it has received against more then 250 members. 

 Sources said the party feared that punishing ?corrupt? members during organisational polls might encourage factionalism and put the leadership in a spot. The process of reorganising different CPM units in Bengal began on September 15. 

 CPM state secretary Anil Biswas said the party expelled 25 members, including Sadananda Hazra, a zonal committee member in Burdwan, and Sushil Bhowmick, a local committee member in the same district. 

 ?We have also initiated disciplinary measures against 55 members belonging to different local committees today,? Biswas said. 

 In another move, the leadership told all local committees to include at least one woman member in each unit.

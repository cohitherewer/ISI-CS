 Detention

 Shillong, Sept. 2: The Federation of Khasi and Garo Peoples detained 30 Nepalis on their way to coal mines in the Jaintia hills last evening and later handed them to police. 

 The Meghalaya home department today reacted sharply to the detention. Superintendent of East Khasi Hills district A.S. Rynjah said the police would ensure that no group takes the law into its hands. Checking infiltration can be allowed but no force can be used.

 The Nepalis detained included women and children.

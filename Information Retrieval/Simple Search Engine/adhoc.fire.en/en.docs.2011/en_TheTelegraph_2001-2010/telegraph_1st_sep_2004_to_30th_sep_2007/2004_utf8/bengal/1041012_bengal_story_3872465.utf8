 BRIEFS

 Behrampore, Oct. 11: Four children have died and over 300 people have been afflicted with diarrhoea in flood-hit Murshidabad. 

 The district?s chief medical officer, Sachchidananda Sarkar, said the children were between five and nine years old. ?Suti, Hariharpara, Rejinagar and Bharatpur are the worst hit. Medicines and saline pouches have been sent to the block medical officers,? said Sarkar. The health authorities have also decided to rush teams comprising a doctor, a nurse and two health workers and arrange boats to ferry the ailing to hospitals. 

 Krishnagar: Apparently unable to bear his father?s nothing-to-do taunts, Krishna Pramanik, 19, committed suicide on Sunday night. After day?s work at his hair-cutting saloon, Gour Pal returned home to see him sleeping at Betai in Tehatta, 160 km from Calcutta. He also did not like that his other sons were at a neighbour?s, to see the IFA Shield final on TV. The boy, who was shoved out of sleep and scolded, hanged himself.

 Calcutta: Former Trinamul MP Nitish Sengupta and ex-MLA Tarun Adhikari joined the Congress on Monday. State Congress president Pranab Mukherjee extended the welcome to all Trinamul leaders.

 DFID nudged on new sectors

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Dec. 9: The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government today turned the attention of the Department for International Development towards two sectors in Bengal hitherto untouched by the British funding agency. 

 ?We discussed decentralisation of the panchayati system and improvement in the rural health sector with DFID officials today,? the chief minister said at Writers? Building. The restructuring of state public sector units also found a place in the ?meaningful discussion?. 

 DFID permanent secretary Suma Chakrabarti held meetings with Bhattacharjee, industry minister Nirupam Sen and chief secretary Asok Gupta this afternoon. 

 ?We reviewed the ongoing programmes being funded by us and reaffirmed our commitment towards reforms and development in the state,? a DFID spokesman said. 

 ?The chief minister is keen to improve delivery of services to the poor and wants good governance. Our annual dialogue with Bengal begins in February, when an annual review meeting is held and programmes are chalked out. Any new project the government might have will have to be placed then,? the official added. 

 The panchayat and rural development department has sent a Rs 900-crore proposal to DFID for strengthening the panchayat system. ?The proposal is in the final stages and we are expecting their nod anytime now,? a department official said. The project would include capacity building of panchayats, improvement of their accounting system and planning process. 

 The health department has also placed a Rs 100-crore proposal for upgrade of the health units in the backward districts, including some in north Bengal. The five-year project targets improvement of primary healthcare facilities in these areas. 

 Both proposals are under consideration of the British government and will have to be cleared in their parliament.

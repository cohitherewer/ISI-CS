 Boy held with answer scripts

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Berhampore, Dec. 25: A Class IX student was arrested early this morning while on his home after stealing blank answer scripts of last year?s Madhyamik examination from his school at Lalbag in Murshidabad, 220 km from Calcutta.

 Police found 50 answer scripts and tools, including a saw-blade, from the boy?s schoolbag.

 A case has been registered on the basis of a complaint by the headmaster of the school.

 ?We arrested the boy immediately after receiving the complaint,? said Subrata Mitra, the subdivisional police officer of Lalbag.

 Preliminary investigation revealed that 14-year-old Hiran Sheikh had chalked out the plan a week ago. ?The boy had planned to sell each sheet at Rs 100. We are now trying to trace Hiran?s clients,? said Mitra.

 Hiran came to Lalbag Singhi High School yesterday, fully prepared, according to the police. Instead of going home after school, he stayed back in a place near the school building.

 ?Late last night, he cut open the lock of the school?s office room and stole the scripts,? said Nilanjan Roy, an officer of Murshidabad police station.

 ?The school was one of the centres for last year?s Madhyamik examination. I had to keep 50 answer scripts in an unlocked cupboard. The scripts were stamped and signed by the centre in-charge,? said Shamsul Islam, the headmaster.

 ?After stealing the scripts, Hiran was returning to his Roshanbag residence. But this time, fortune did not favour him. Policemen patrolling the area spotted Hiran and intercepted him,? said Mitra.

 ?Initially, he was detained. We took him into custody this afternoon. Producing him in court tomorrow will not be illegal,? said an official of Murshidabad police station.

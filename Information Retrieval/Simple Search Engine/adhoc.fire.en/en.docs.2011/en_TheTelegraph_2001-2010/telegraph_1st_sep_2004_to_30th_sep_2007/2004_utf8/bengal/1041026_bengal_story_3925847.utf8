 HIV mom wants son to die

 NARESH JANA

 Midnapore, Oct. 25: Kajal Paul wants her five-year-old son Sukanta to die before she does.

 The 30-year-old lost her husband Pradip Paul to AIDS a few years ago. After his death, she learned that Sukanta and she were both HIV-positive. A distraught Kajal says: ?I want him to die before I do, otherwise he will be all alone in this world with no one to look after and will die a painful death.?

 Seeing his mother cry, Sukanta, who is not aware of the looming tragedy, starts sobbing. ?We will die together, don?t you worry,? he tells her. 

 Kajal married Pradip, a goldsmith, 12 years ago. The family was happy at their Palashpaikamarghat home in Daspur, West Midnapore, about 120 km from Calcutta, until Pradip decided to take up a job in Mumbai. 

 On returning from Mumbai after a year, Pradip took ill. Local doctors he consulted suspected he was HIV-positive and referred him to the School of Tropical Medicine in Calcutta, where he tested positive. 

 ?When my husband returned after a year, he was infected with the virus but was not aware of it. On his return I conceived my second son five years ago, who was found to be infected with the deadly virus from birth,? Kajal recalled.

 Her elder son, 10-year-old Ratikanta, works as a goldsmith in Calcutta and does not visit his mother after he learnt of their predicament.

 Kajal and Sukanta now live in a shanty at a bamboo grove about 100 m from Pradip?s house, forsaken by his family. 

 ?How can we let them live with us under the same roof when we know that they have AIDS? If we allow them we will be risking the lives of all the family members,? said Pradip?s brother Amity.

 The widow and her son fetch water from a pond which no other villager uses. ?I have to go door to door and beg ? if they give us something, we eat, otherwise we go without food. We are completely at the villagers? mercy,? Kajal said.

 The only ones who visit the duo are members of the NGO Sparsha, which is working to spread AIDS awareness. 

 ?There are several HIV positive patients in the area and most were afflicted by the virus after they visited Mumbai. According to a survey we conducted some time back, there are nearly 200 patients, including 52 women,? said Sparsha coordinator Shyamal Kuila.

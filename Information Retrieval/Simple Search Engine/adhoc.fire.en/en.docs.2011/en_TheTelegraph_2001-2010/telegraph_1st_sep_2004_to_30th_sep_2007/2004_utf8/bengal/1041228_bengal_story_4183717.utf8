 Jail to lock out ?intimacy?

 BARUN GHOSH 

 Calcutta, Dec. 27: The city will soon have a jail exclusively for women convicts. 

 At present, over 200 women lodged in Presidency Jail share the campus with male convicts. Though living in segregation, an officer said they share the approach to the main entrance and the men often taunt and harass the women on their way to the courts. 

 Presidency Jail sources said ?complaints? about male prisoners developing ?intimacy? with the women are common.

 ?We are badly in need of a separate jail for women in the city. Though the female inmates of Presidency jail are housed at a distance from the males, we do not want them on the same campus,? said P.K. Agrawal, principal secretary, jails.

 The government has drawn up plans to convert a portion of the Alipore Special Jail, opposite National Library, into a facility for women. 

 Ramapada Bhattacharya, the deputy inspector-general, prisons, said the 5-bigha campus would be split to house the new jail. ?Only 73 non-criminal lunatics are now lodged there. So, a vast portion of it can be used.?

 Officials working on the Rs 1-crore project said the new facility, on about 70,000 sq ft, will have a vocational training centre, an auditorium and a school.

 At a meeting with PWD officials working on a project to improve the condition of prisons across the state, last week, jails minister Biswanath Chowdhury sounded keen on the women?s facility. 

 ?We shall shift all 200-odd women prisoners from Presidency to our new address as soon as it is ready,? said a senior jail official. 

 A source said there was furore a few years ago when Talat Sultana, the widow of slain Forward Bloc MLA Ramjan Ali, renewed intimacy with her paramour Nurul Islam in the jail. Both had been arrested in connection with the Bloc leader?s murder and Islam later had to be shifted to Alipore Central Jail.

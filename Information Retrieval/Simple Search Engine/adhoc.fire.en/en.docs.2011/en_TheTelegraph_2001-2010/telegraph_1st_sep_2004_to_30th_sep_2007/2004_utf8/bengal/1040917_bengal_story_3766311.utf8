 Guru held for diksha rape 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Sept. 16: A 23-year-old housewife sent by her mother-in-law to a self-styled godman for initiation was allegedly raped several times before she raised her voice. 

 Makhan Sil, guruji to the Biswases of Betai village in Tehatta, 150 km from Calcutta, has been arrested. The mother-in-law, Usha Biswas, is also behind bars, subdivisional police officer K.P. Barui said.

 Last night, angry villagers submitted a memorandum to the police alleging that the Biswases were sitting on the housewife?s complaint. 

 Officials at Tehatta police station said Sil, who saw the woman during her marriage last year, asked Usha to get her initiated for spiritual uplift two months ago. ?In the name of diksha (initiation), the guru raped and molested her repeatedly over a period of about two months,? Barui said. 

 ?She had reported the matter to her father-in-law and husband Lakshman, a labourer in Pune. But they did nothing but express sympathy.? 

 The police are puzzled by the silence of Usha and her husband Sudhir after their daughter-in-law complained. The woman did not want to trouble her mother, a widow living at Burnia in Tehatta, and did not tell her what she was going through.

 Unable to take the torture any longer, she spoke to some of the women in the village and the news spread. Angry villagers organised a conciliation meeting where Usha was asked not to send her daughter-in-law to Sil. 

 ?But Usha was obstinate and told the villagers what Sil was doing would bode well for the family. She also warned the villagers against interfering,? Barui said.

 The villagers then submitted the memorandum urging immediate action.

 The police said the woman has told them that her mother-in-law knew what she was going through. ?She held her responsible for that.?

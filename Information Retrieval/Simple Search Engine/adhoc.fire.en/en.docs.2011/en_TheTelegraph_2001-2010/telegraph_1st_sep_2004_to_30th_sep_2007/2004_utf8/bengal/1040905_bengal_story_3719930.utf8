 Shot-at cry 

 Calcutta, Sept. 4: Trinamul Congress MLA Sonali Guha today complained she was fired upon around 10.15 am on Sundari Mohan Avenue off Entally while rushing to a doctor with her ailing husband Partha Bose. 

 We have investigated into the incident and find it hard to believe. No witnesses are available and even the local shop owners deny the incident. In short, there is nothing to her claim, said Ranvir Kumar, DC, eastern suburban division.

 Crime turns foes friends

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Balurghat, Dec. 25: The bitter political rivalry between the CPM and the Congress did not prevent their party members from becoming partners in crime. A CPM leader of the district and one of the Congress have been arrested when they were caught selling rice meant for a school?s mid-day meal in South Dinajpur.

 The Harirampore block development officer, Tenzing Norgey Sherpa and the vice-president of the gram panchayat, Subhasish Pal, raided Gokarna market, about 360 km from Calcutta, following a tip-off that the two might sell 300 kg of rice allotted for the mid-day meals of the Balad Primary School.

 The officials caught Khairul Islam of the CPM and Raj Mohammad of the Congress in the act. Islam is a former pradhan of the Gokarna gram panchayat and Mohammed is a member of the Gokarna gram panchayat and the president of local education committee.

 The subdivisional police officer, M.M.H. Mirja, said the headmaster, Anil Debnath, was also involved in the racket. Debnath, who belongs to Raigunj in North Dinajpur, is absconding. An Fir has been lodged against him.

 The incident has sent ripples through political circles at Balurghat.

 ?We are shaken. This kind of conduct is not expected from people holding responsible positions, particularly when the government is trying to cover all the 57,000 state-aided primary schools under the mid-day meal scheme within the current financial year, in response to a Supreme Court directive,? said a senior official in the district administration.

 Pal, a Congress leader, said Mohammad was elected a member of the samiti. However, the party had recently received several complaints against him, on the basis of which he was expelled from the party last month, claimed the Congress leader.

 Gautam Goswami, a member of the South Dinajpur district secretariat of the CPM, said the party will not interfere if Islam is found guilty. 

 ?However, we have not heard anything about the allegation levelled against Islam,? Goswami said.

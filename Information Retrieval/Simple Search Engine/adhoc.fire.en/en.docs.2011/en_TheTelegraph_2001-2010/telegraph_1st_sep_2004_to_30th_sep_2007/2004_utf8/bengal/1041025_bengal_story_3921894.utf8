 BRIEFS

 Krishnagar, Oct. 24: The puja did not augur well for two women in Nadia. Both took their lives last night with grudges against their husbands. 

 Lakshmi Kar, 26, set herself ablaze at Ranaghat, about 60 km from Calcutta, after Sudeb, a hawker, refused to buy her new clothes. Malati Das, 40, hanged herself at Kaligunge, about 140 km from the city, after Baidyanath refused to let her visit her parents because of their child?s school examination.

 Sudeb has been arrested. Baidyanath, a state electricity board employee, is absconding. Additional superintendent of police Biswarup Ghosh said: ?We have charged Sudeb with abatement to suicide. Baidyanath will also be booked for the same crime.?

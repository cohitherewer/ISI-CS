 HRD set for curriculum debut 

 - Topic aimed at making ?all-rounder? students 

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE 

 Calcutta, Dec. 15: The government will introduce human resource development as a subject from Class VI in all state-aided schools from the next academic session in an attempt to broaden the horizon of students, mainly of Bengali-medium institutions. 

 ?Our move is to help a student go beyond the confines of his text book and thus improve his mental horizon. Without confining them to text books, we want students to acquire knowledge in myriad subjects for enhancement of their knowledge,? said board of secondary education president Dibyendu Hota. 

 ?Apart from learning usual subjects like geography, history, science and mathematics, students must know the history and culture of the country they belong to. Moreover, they must know some ethics and etiquette. This apart, students should be well equipped with general knowledge,? he added. 

 The matter was discussed in a recent meeting of key CPM functionaries, where chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee stressed the need for the course ?to make a student an all-rounder?. 

 The board has already prepared course materials for the subject. Some teachers will be trained first as resource persons and they, in turn, will equip others for taking classes on the topic. 

 ?The focus of the new subject is on knowing yourself, your family, your society and your country. In the ?know yourself? chapter, students will be taught how to maintain good health, develop proper food habits and prevent communicable diseases. Besides, we want students to be efficient in general knowledge and current affairs,? an official said. 

 Students would be given lessons on how to behave with family members, particularly their elders, and encouraged to participate in social activities like immunisation, literacy and blood donation programmes and work for the disabled and mentally-challenged. 

 They will be trained on how to take part in debates, discussions and seminars as the establishment believes Bengali-medium students lag behind their English-medium counterparts in extra-curricular activities.

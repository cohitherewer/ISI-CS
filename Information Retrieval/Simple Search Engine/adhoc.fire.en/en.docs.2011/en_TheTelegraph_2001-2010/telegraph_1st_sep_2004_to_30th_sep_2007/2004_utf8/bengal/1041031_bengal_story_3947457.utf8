 Newborn death row in hospital

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Midnapore, Oct 30: A newborn died yesterday, allegedly after falling off a trolley in Midnapore Medical College and Hospital, sparking allegations of negligence.

 However, hospital authorities claimed that the child was stillborn.

 The baby?s parents alleged that neither a nurse nor attendants were beside the cot.

 Soma Sen, a resident of Khayerpulla Chak under the Kotwali police station of West Midnapore, was admitted to the hospital at 5 pm yesterday. Her husband Ananda, a farmer, said Soma was taken to the labour room around 8. 

 ?She was kept in the labour room throughout the night. We were extremely worried as this was our first child and when we went to the hospital this morning, nurses told us that the child was stillborn,? Ananda added.

 Soma alleged that none of the doctors or nurses attended to her though she was suffering from severe pain. ?The nurses asked me to go to sleep. After giving birth to the child unattended, I fell unconscious. Later, they told me I gave birth to a stillborn.? 

 A female attendant, who was at the labour room, told The Telegraph on the condition of anonymity that the baby was crying after she fell. ?I pointed it to a nurse on duty who asked me to get back to my patient,? she said. 

 Hospital superintendent Laxmi Kanta Ghosh said: ?Since the baby was stillborn, the nurses did not pay attention. However, we are conducting a probe and if someone is found guilty, we will take action.?

 Buddha plea for flushout

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 23: The chief minister today renewed his appeal to the Centre to help the state flush out militants from camps in ?a neighbouring country? where ISI agents are allegedly training militant outfits active in the region.

 ?We have specific information that Ulfa (United Liberation Front of Asom) activist Paresh Barua and KLO (Kamtapur Liberation Organisation) chief Jiban Singha have taken refuge in the neighbouring country and are undergoing military training there. We have sought the Centre?s assistance to sort out the problem. We again seek its help,? Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee told the Assembly.

 He said the state was worried about KLO and Ulfa activities in north Bengal, the CPI (Maoist) in West Midnapore, Bankura and Purulia and the ISI in the border areas of the ?neighbouring country?. 

 ?Altogether, 137 ISI agents have been arrested in connection with 27 cases. However, the charges could be established in only one case and the agents were punished. Chargesheets were framed in 16 cases. We are worried about ISI activities in our state because the agents are being trained in our neighbouring country? They are sneaking into our territory,? Bhattacharjee added.

 He also told the House that 166 militants who received ISI?s military training had joined the KLO. ?About 80 KLO and Ulfa activists were killed in Bhutan?s flushout operations last year. But the rest of them killed 26 people, including a policeman, in different parts of north Bengal.?

 Bhattacharjee was also critical about the Jharkhand government?s role in tackling the Naxalites. ?They (the rebels) have no base in our state. They carry out their operation in the three Bengal districts and flee to neighbouring Jharkhand, where the government is unable to initiate adequate action against them.?

 Bhattacharjee said the Naxalites killed 12 civilians and 17 policemen in Bengal in a little over a year. Only one rebel was killed in an encounter with the police. 

 ?These Maoists, from Andhra Pradesh, enter our state through Orissa, Bihar and Jharkhand. If all these states fail to deal with them firmly, our problem may not be solved,? Bhattacharjee said.

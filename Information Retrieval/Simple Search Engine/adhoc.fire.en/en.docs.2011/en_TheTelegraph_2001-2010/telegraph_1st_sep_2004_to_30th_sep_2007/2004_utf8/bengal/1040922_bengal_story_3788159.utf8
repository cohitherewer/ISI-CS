 Miner widows hold reins

 - Team of 10 works better than men in Colliery

 Bulldozing odds: A woman at work at Khottadih colliery. A Telegraph picture 

 Durgapur, Sept. 21: A team 

 of 10, all widows of miners killed in mishaps, has been 

 virtually running the show at an Eastern Coalfields pit 

 near here.

 One of them, Lalmoni Yadav, was accused of witchcraft and turned out of her village in Bihar when she went back to her in-laws after her husband?s death. 

 Lalmoni returned to Pandaveswar in Burdwan, 220 km from Calcutta, with her month-old baby and Khottadih colliery has been her permanent address since.

 The others have their own tales. But they have left their past behind. Their new life is all about operating the mechanised shovels, dozers and drills to raise coal from this open cast mine and load them in dumpers. 

 With the help of eight casual women workers, the team has run eight-hour shifts for three years. 

 The mine authorities are more than happy with their discipline and honesty. 

 ?Situation has dragged them to heavy work usually meant for men. They are dedicated and more often than not more responsible towards work than their male counterparts. Elsewhere, we are used to gherao, demonstrations and labour trouble. But there is peace in Khottadih,? said Lalit Kumar Chowdhury, the mine manager.

 Lalmoni is rather indifferent to the complements. ?What will I say about myself? My husband died in a mishap and then I realised the reality. I can?t read or write? never thought I would operate these huge machines, but now it is routine for me. I was driven out from my husband?s home but now I am confident of raising my daughter,? she said with a smile.

 The women here have not heard about Women?s Day or women?s rights. ?Woh kya hai babu, humko pata nahin (What is that? I don?t know). I am only working hard to feed my child and to sustain myself,? said one of the women. 

 In their own little ways they have set an example but Taslima Bibi, Kari Devi and the others were nonchalant.

 Taslima had a demand though. She thought it would be better if they were provided uniforms and shoes for work. 

 ?I do not have any problem working hard but if the babus provide us proper shoes and uniform suitable for working in the mine, we will be able to perform better. While raising coal, we are uncomfortable in saris and sandals,? said the dozer operator.

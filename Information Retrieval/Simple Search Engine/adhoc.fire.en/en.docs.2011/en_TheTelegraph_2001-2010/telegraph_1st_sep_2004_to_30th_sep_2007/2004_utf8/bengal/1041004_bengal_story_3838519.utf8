 Calcutta, Oct. 3: Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL) has bagged the contract for setting up a 250-mw thermal power unit at Santaldih.

 BHEL and West Bengal Power Development Corporation, which handles generation by state-run plants, entered into an agreement on Friday finalising the deal.

 BHEL officials said the plant will be commissioned in 33 months. The public sector giant will design, manufacture, supply, erect, test and commission steam turbines, generators, boilers, associated auxiliaries and the civil work.

 The turbine generators and boilers will be manufactured at the company?s Hardwar and Trichy units. Its Hyderabad unit will manufacture coal mills and boiler feed pumps and Bhopal and Jhansi units supply electrical and switchyard equipment. Precipitators that control the ash produced with power and fans will come from Ranipet.

 With the new unit, Santaldih?s generating capacity will go up from 480 mw to 730 mw.

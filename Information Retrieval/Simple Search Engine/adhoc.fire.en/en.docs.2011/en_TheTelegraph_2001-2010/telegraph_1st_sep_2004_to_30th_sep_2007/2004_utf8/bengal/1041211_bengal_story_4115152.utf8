 CM sees poverty

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 10: A million children in the state still do not go to school as they have to work for their families? livelihood. Students at 44 per cent of government-run schools do not get mid-day meals, resulting in a high proportion of dropouts, the chief minister revealed today. 

 Poverty, he admitted, was at the root of the plight of children and growth of terrorism. 

 At the release of the book, The State of the World?s Children, organised by the Unicef, Bhattacharjee said: ?The planning and rural development departments have submitted a report, which shows that 4.5 million people in 4,600 villages are the poorest of poor in our state. Among them children are the worst sufferers.? 

 The chief minister said he has held meetings with education department officials to bring the million children, who are being deprived of education, to the classroom. ?Our target is to bring them to school by 2010,? he added. 

 Mid-day meals, Bhattacharjee said, were introduced to prevent dropouts. ?But students of only 56 per cent of the schools get mid-day meals.? 

 In Bengal, 26 per cent of the population lives below the poverty line. Bhattacharjee said: ?The percentage is much less compared to the national figure of 35 per cent, but we still need to be conscious.?

 Red flag to fill-in teachers

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 23: The government?s policy of recruiting ?parateachers? in schools received a blow today when the high court imposed an injunction on such appointments.

 Passing common interim orders on at least five separate cases, Justice Kalyan Jyoti Sengupta said: ?The appointment of parateachers (temporary and taken on contract) in schools is contrary to existing law and regulation.?

 Justice Sengupta said: ?It is made clear that the school authority shall not appoint any teaching and non-teaching staff other than under provisions of (the) School Service Commission or relevant recruitment rules.?

 The education department had decided to appoint 2,000 parateachers in primary and secondary schools aided by it offering an ad-hoc monthly payment of Rs 1,000 and Rs 2,000, depending on qualifications. Accordingly, applications were invited from aspirants.

 At least five cases, alleging favouritism by the schools during recruitment of parateachers, were filed in the court. All the cases were clubbed together and sent to Justice Sengupta for disposal.

 An official said the government had decided to take in temporary teachers to make the Sarva Siksha Abhiyan a success. He added: ?More than 20 lakh children below the age of 14 are out of school now. Teachers are few and we need more at both primary and secondary levels to handle so many students.?

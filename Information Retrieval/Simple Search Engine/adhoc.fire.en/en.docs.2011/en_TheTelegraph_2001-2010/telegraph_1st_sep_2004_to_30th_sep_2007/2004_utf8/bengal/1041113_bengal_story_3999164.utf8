 Doctor wife alleges baby swap

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Burdwan, Nov. 12: A doctor?s wife today accused the Burdwan Medical College and Hospital of swapping her new-born son with a girl child.

 Archana Roy Chowdhury has lodged a written complaint with the hospital superintendent.

 Admitted to the maternity ward early this morning, she delivered a baby at the labour room around 6.

 ?After the delivery, the doctor in the labour room told me I had a son. I was also shown a boy. But about 45 minutes later, when the nurse brought the baby to my bedside, I found it was a girl and refused to accept it. The sister then started scolding me and tried to force the baby on my bed. How can I not claim a son when I saw one with my own eyes?? she asked. 

 According to hospital records, three children were born between 5.45 am and 6.15 am. One of them was a male. The boy was born to one Sabita Mondal, immediately before Archana.

 Hospital superintendent Sarit Chowdhury said he would carry out the probe personally. ?We are giving priority to the complaint. The doctors and hospital employees are being questioned and a DNA test will be carried out. However, carrying out the DNA and other blood tests will take some time,? he added.

 The authorities are apparently all the more uneasy in the wake of the row as Archana is the wife of Prabir Roy Chowdhury, a general physician at Raina and a nephew of district CPM secretary Amal Haldar.

 Roy Chowdhury said: ?My wife lodged the complaint with the superintendent after speaking to our relative Amal Haldar. She is very confident about her case.? 

 He added: ?We don?t mind having a daughter. But we are sure the child given to my wife is not ours. There is no question of accepting it. If the hospital authorities fail to sort the matter out, we will be forced to go to the police.?

 Lawyers hold up trials 

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Sept. 8: Normal work in all 202 courts across the state, including Calcutta High Court, came to a virtual standstill as 26,000 lawyers ceased work and staged dharnas to protest against a police lathicharge on their colleagues in Lucknow last Friday. 

 ?There was no work in courts as we organised day-long dharnas on and outside court premises to express solidarity with the lawyers in Uttar Pradesh. It?s true that litigants suffered but we must rise to the occasion to condemn police action on our colleagues,? said Sanatan Mukherjee, chairman of the West Bengal Bar Council. 

 Among the scores of cases that could not be taken up was the trial of don Aftab Ansari in connection with the 2001 abduction of the Khadim?s owner at Alipore court. 

 Members of the pro-Left Democratic Lawyers? Association also participated in the stir. ?We do not support any ceasework. But today our members stayed away from courts as a mark of protest against police atrocities on lawyers in Uttar Pradesh,? Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya, DLA vice-president said. 

 Officials claimed that a few cases were heard in the high court where petitioners pleaded their own cases in the absence of advocates. But hearing was postponed in several such cases too as lawyers from the opposite side were not present.

 Free polio treatment

 Calcutta, Nov. 28: Mihir Ganguly was suffering from a knee ailment for a long time. An orthopaedic surgeon had advised surgery, but Ganguly, 68, did not have the money. 

 Today he learnt that the operation would be conducted free of cost at Lions Orthopaedics Hospital and Research Centre at Rani Kuthi. Ganguly will be operated tomorrow. 

 Lions Club of North Calcutta and Lions Club of Greater Calcutta, in association with the Sri Balaji Institute of Surgery, Research and Rehabilitation for Disabled, and Tirupati Tirumala Devasthanam, are organising a camp to treat polio patients free of cost for seven years. Subhas Murarka of the club said the eighth camp, which started today, will continue till December 3.

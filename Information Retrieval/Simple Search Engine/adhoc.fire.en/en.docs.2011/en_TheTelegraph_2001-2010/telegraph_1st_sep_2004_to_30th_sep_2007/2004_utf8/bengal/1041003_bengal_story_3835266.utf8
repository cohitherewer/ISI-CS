 Fire and cheer at puja meet 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Oct. 2: Fire minister Pratim Chatterjee has cracked his whip. 

 Banned: Rubber, straw, sugarcane pulp and coconut fibre as raw material for pandals. 

 Penalty for defaulters: A stiff Rs 50,000. The fire services department can use its discretion to stop any puja. 

 ?We would like to make it clear to the organisers that anyone ? irrespective of his proximity to the corridors of power ? would face the penalty this time if any attempt is made to violate the fire norms,? Chatterjee said today after a meeting with about 59 puja organisers. 

 After the lash, he spread some Puja cheer. There would be adequate police posting along with fire services personnel at the mega pujas. The police would take care of law and order, including incidents of eve-teasing, and coordinate with the fire services personnel to tackle any eventuality. 

 The minister said his department has identified around 60 high-risk pujas ? on the basis of round-the-clock crowd flow during the five days of festivities ? that would require special arrangements both by the police and fire services. 

 Chatterjee said his department has held a series of meetings with the police top brass to tackle the problems of crowd control, pick-pockets and eve-teasers. 

 All organisers will have to submit a declaration saying whether they have abided by the fire norms. 

 ?Twelve teams would tour the city a few days prior to the inauguration to make on-the-spot assessment of the arrangements. The thrust would be primarily on three areas ? exit roads, electrical wiring and hazard prevention (whether arrangements have been made to stop fire from spreading to adjoining buildings),? said Baren Sen, the director of West Bengal Fire Services.

 Besides assuring organisers total support, the fire services department has issued a string of directives. These include:

 The place for preparation of bhog should 

be at least 50 feet away from the main pandal 

 No stall with open fire arrangement should 

be allowed near the pandal 

 All pandals should have arrangements for sand, 

water, fire extinguishers and iron-hooks 

 A contractor with a government licence should 

carry out all electrical works.

 Must-check rule for teachers

 RANJAN LAHIRY

 Burdwan, Sept. 21: Burdwan University has decided to make it compulsory for college teachers to evaluate answerscripts of its undergraduate examinations.

 University registrar Shoroshi Mohan Dawn said: ?We are framing special rules to make it compulsory for all teachers to examine answerscripts. 

 ?The burden of correcting answerscripts is now being shouldered by a handful of teachers and it is increasingly arduous for them. As a result, the standard of evaluation is becoming difficult to maintain,? he said.

 A meeting of the varsity?s undergraduate council made the decision last week. 

 A varsity official said: ?We have formed a committee to work out the new rules. However, we are yet to decide how a teacher will be dealt with if he or she refuses to examine answerscripts.? 

 In the absence of a rule making it mandatory for a teacher to evaluate answerscripts, the University could not take any action once refused.

 The council also discussed complaints of ?faulty? and out-of-syllabus question papers and decided to have a panel to scrutinise them before they are approved for distribution during exams.

 The official said: ?We decided at the meeting that some kind of punishment will have to spelt out for those who set faulty and out-of-syllabus questions.?

 Last month, students? bodies had alleged that out-of-syllabus questions in Bengali, math, political science and economics led to poor BA, BSc and BCom marks in many of the 157 undergraduate colleges under the university.

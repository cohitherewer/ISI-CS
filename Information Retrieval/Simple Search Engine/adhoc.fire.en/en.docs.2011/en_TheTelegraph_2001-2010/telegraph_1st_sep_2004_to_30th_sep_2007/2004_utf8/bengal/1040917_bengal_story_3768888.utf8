 Green course compulsory

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Sept. 16: All students, from primary school to undergraduate college, will be taught environmental science as a compulsory 100-mark subject from next year.

 The government today decided to introduce the subject, which Madhyamik examinees of 2007 will have to pass. 

 Under the existing system, Madhyamik examinees study eight compulsory papers ?first language (papers I and II), second language, mathematics, physical science, life science, history and geography ? each carrying 100 marks. Environmental science will be the ninth paper.

 With the introduction, higher secondary examinees will have to study six compulsory subjects. They now study five subjects, each carrying 200 marks. 

 The Supreme Court had set a 2005 deadline for all states to introduce the new subject at primary, secondary, higher secondary and undergraduate levels. 

 West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education president Jyotirmoy Mukherjee said: ?As directed by the apex court, environmental science will be taught as a separate subject from next year. We are examining how to maintain continuity in the syllabi from the primary to the university level. The process began at a meeting today attended by experts from all levels.?

 The government was initially opposed to the introduction of environmental science as a separate subject. It felt another subject would add to the students? burden and recruiting new teachers and providing additional infrastructure would prove expensive.

 The Delhi-based Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations, which has over 500 affiliated schools in the state, has also finalised its decision to introduce environmental science as a compulsory subject in its ICSE and ISC syllabi from 2005.

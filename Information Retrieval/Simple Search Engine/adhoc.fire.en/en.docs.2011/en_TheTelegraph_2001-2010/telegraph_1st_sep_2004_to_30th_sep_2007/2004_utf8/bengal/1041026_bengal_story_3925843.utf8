 KINSUK BASU 

Calcutta, Oct. 25: A glimpse of Kanchenjungha 

from Sandakphu at the crack of dawn and a campfire deep in a Dooars forest the 

same evening ? if this sounds like a dream, hold your breath. 

 In a desperate bid to sell tourism in Bengal, two departments have decided to join hands. Forest and tourism together will throw open their facilities to those willing to savour the greens and the slopes at one go. 

 For the tourist, that will mean an end to making separate bookings for tourist department cottages and forest department lodges. A blueprint to connect the two has been worked out. Once ready, a holiday package can be booked online. 

 An official said the new system would cut down hassles and offer more variety to the tourists, who would be able to avail of the facility by the year-end.

 ?Many of the tourists want to venture into the Dooars forests on their way back from the hills. Once the lodges are connected, we would be better equipped to handle tours. A combo of the hills and the jungles would surely work wonders,? said M.K. Sengupta, the director of the West Bengal Tourism Development Corporation. 

 The tourism corporation has 23 lodges and, with the new proposal, expects a higher occupancy. The project, still at the execution level, has prompted tourism mandarins to go for a string of ad campaigns highlighting the double treat. 

 The Forest Development Corporation has 25 bungalows. Last year, it touched the Rs 1-crore revenue mark. A senior official said: ?If the lodges are connected with the cottages, we will get a greater opportunity to try more adventurous schemes.? 

 Plans to offer more to tourists are not limited to going online. Government officials working on a Mauritius model are in favour of handing cottages that are not doing too well to private players.

 The Tourism Development Corporation has already invited bids to run the lodges at Digha, the Sagar Islands, Asansol, Bankura and Mukutmanipur. 

 A senior tourism officer said: ?Privatisation will ensure that the state receives an assured sum from the otherwise low-yielding lodges. Once the facilities are properly managed, they will pull in tourists in larger numbers to these destinations.?

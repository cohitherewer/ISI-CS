 Salt Lake ?scam? in SC 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 13: The Supreme Court will hear on Friday a contempt complaint against former Calcutta High Court judge B.P. Banerjee, an alleged beneficiary of out-of-turn allotment of plots in Salt Lake sanctioned by Jyoti Basu.

 The former judge was also accused of filing a ?false affidavit? in the Supreme Court by counsel Prashant Bhushan, who was arguing for a public interest litigation.

 A division bench of Justices S.. Variava and H.K. Sema today posted the case to Friday for further hearing.

 According to the PIL, Jyoti Basu as chief minister had ?favoured? and ?patronised? many, including his biographer Surabhi Banerjee, by allotting plots in Salt Lake.

 The petitioner, Dipak Ghosh, an IAS officer who served the state as a principal secretary, alleged that Banerjee misled the apex court by stating in his affidavit that the allegations of out-of-turn allotments did not come up before him in the high court. Bhushan mentioned 15 dates on which the case came up before Banerjee.

 BRIEFS

 Burdwan, Sept. 2: A CID team today raided six alternative medicine institutions here which awarded fake degrees in allopathy, homeopathy and ayurvedic medicine. Six people, including two women, were arrested and the medical colleges sealed.

 Director of medical education C.R. Maity said the raids were carried out on the governments instruction. None of these so-called colleges is approved by the Medical Council of India and, therefore, has no authority to issue any degree in any recognised field of medical education, he said. 

 Midnapore: Farmer Ramjan Ali lodged a complaint with the block development officer of Daspur in West Midnapore on Thursday accusing his nephew, a local Trinamul Congress leader, of raping his two minor daughters. Ali, a resident of Paskan Durjdharpur village, 120 km from Calcutta, met the BDO after a complaint with police evoked no response. Ali said his 15-year-old daughter, who had been raped several times, told him of the assaults only when Bajrul Rahman was caught raping his 11-year-old daughter on Monday. Rahman is absconding.

 Bolpur: Three days after the high court allowed his bail prayer, former Visva-Bharati VC Dilip Sinha was released from the sub-divisional jail here. He was arrested on June 24 on the charge of attesting forged certificates of Mukti Deb, the former math teacher who is in jail.

 Chinsurah: Mala Paswan, 25, died of gastroenteritis and 50 others were afflicted at Champdani in Hooghly.

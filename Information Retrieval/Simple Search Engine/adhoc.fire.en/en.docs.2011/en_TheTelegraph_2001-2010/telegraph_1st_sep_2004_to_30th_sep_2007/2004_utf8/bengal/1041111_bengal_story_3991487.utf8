 Lock on caning school 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Midnapore, Nov. 10: Sadiachak residents are seething over the inhuman caning of a Class II student, who had to be taken to hospital, and have vowed not to let the school function till the teachers are punished. 

 Little Jhuma Ghunti returned home, in West Midnapore?s Ghatal, from school on Monday crying. ?I counted 12 welts that were raw,? said Ghatal subdivisional officer Amitava Maitra, who met the girl after her father filed an FIR. 

 She told her mother that her teacher, Dipak Karmakar, a Trinamul Congress functionary and former pradhan of the local Manoharpur panchayat, thrashed her when she could not understand an arithmetic problem. 

 As news spread, angry villagers gheraoed the school, demanding Karmakar?s arrest and transfer of the four other teachers of Sadiachak Primary school. Police rescued the teachers, but the villagers locked the school. 

 Additional superintendent of police Manoj Verma said a medical report on Jhuma?s injuries is with the police and steps were being taken. 

 Headmaster Pranoy Bhattacharya regretted the incident. ?We are profoundly sorry for the incident. We will bear all medical expenses for Jhuma and ensure that she doesn?t face any problem in school in future,? he said.

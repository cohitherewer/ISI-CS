 Subhas no to fare hike

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Dec. 7: Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty today ruled out any immediate hike in bus fares despite a strike called by two bus unions on December 15.

 ?I have convened a meeting with the unions on December 10. This being the festive season, it is not the right time for these activities. Besides, I think oil prices in the international market will come down soon,? the minister said.

 When it was pointed out that the Centre had not scaled down oil prices despite the recent fall in prices in the international market, Chakraborty said: ?The Centre will bring down prices when they start feeling pressurised. Also, the Prime Minister has asked us not to rake up the issue until a method is worked out to stabilise prices in the Indian market.? 

 On uneven cess and taxes on oil in states in the eastern region, the minister said: ?There should be parity in the taxes imposed in Bengal and the neighbouring states. Finance minister Asim Dasgupta is looking into the matter.?

 Asked about the petition moved against him for observing the chakka jam despite the High Court order, Chakraborty said he would appear before the Court if he is summoned.

 ?But, let me clarify that strikes are different from bandhs. Chakka jam was only a mode of protest similar to strikes and I being president of the workers? body, was part of the decision (to call for a jam). Strikes have a long history of 300 years, while bandhs entered the Oxford dictionary only in the 1980s. I am opposed to bandhs, but I believe that the Constitution of India grants a worker the right to strike in order to safeguard his interests,? the minister added.

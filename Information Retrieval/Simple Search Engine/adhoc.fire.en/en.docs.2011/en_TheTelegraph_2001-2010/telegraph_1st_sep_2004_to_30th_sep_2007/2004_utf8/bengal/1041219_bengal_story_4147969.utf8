 LLB fraud cloud on city lawyers 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Dec. 18: Ranchi University storekeeper Jagat Kishore Mondal has reportedly told police that over 500 fake LLB mark sheets have made their way to lawyers in Calcutta, courtesy a racket involved in printing false figures on blank original mark sheets. They were sold for anything between Rs 30,000 to 40,000, allegedly in connivance with a section of the varsity top brass. 

 Mondal was arrested by detective department sleuths near his residence in Ranchi a few days ago. 

 Going by Mondal?s confessions, the mark sheets found their way not only to Bengal but other parts of the country, like Haryana, Mumbai, Delhi and even Andaman and Nicobar Islands. 

 As storekeeper, Mondal used to keep tabs of the original mark sheets left behind in the university?s strongroom after the bulk was released every year. The university passed orders to ensure destruction of the blank sheets, but rarely would anyone come to implement the order. 

 ?Mondal would take the opportunity and slip out a number of blank mark sheets from the old lot and these (after the other members had filled in the numbers) would find their way to respective clients across the country,? said a police officer involved in interrogating Mondal. 

 The West Bengal Bar Council had sent some of the fake mark sheets to the university for verification, but the racketeers ensured that the candidates got the clearance. The modus operandi was simple. Whenever a letter reached Ranchi University seeking verification of a particular mark sheet, the members of the gang passed the information to their ?contacts?, like Mondal, who got in touch with the person who had bought the mark sheet. The recipient would come to Ranch, pay a hefty bribe and get away with a clean chit. The ?settlement? often cost the candidate an additional Rs 10,000 to 15,000. 

 Investigations suggest Mondal was left with barely Rs 10,000 ? of the Rs 30,000 to 40,000 price of each fake document ? after distributing the other members? share. 

 ?A look at his house doesn?t show that Mondal led an opulent life. But by keeping a small amount for himself and distributing the rest, he ensured that the racket worked for years,? said a sleuth of the investigating team. 

 Police claimed a few more arrests are in the pipeline before they take up the complaint lodged by the state bar council against lawyers allegedly using fake mark sheets. The verification of the mark sheets would begin after the racket is busted.

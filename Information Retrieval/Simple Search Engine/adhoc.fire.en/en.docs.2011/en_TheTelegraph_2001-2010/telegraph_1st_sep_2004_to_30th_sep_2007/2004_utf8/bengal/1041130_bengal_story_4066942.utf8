 Sundarbans gratitude to Lapierre

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Lapierre: 

 Benefactor

Barasat, Nov. 29: Putt-putting along the waterways of the Sundarbans to its furthest corners are four launches with doctors carrying medicines, sophisticated portable X-ray and echo-cardiograph machines and hope. 

 The residents of the Sundarbans now have a lifeline, thanks to author and philanthropist Dominique Lapierre. 

 In return, the grateful residents of Sandeshkhali in North 24-Parganas and Basanti, Gosaba and Kultali in South 24-Parganas have decided to felicitate the novelist when he comes calling on December 6. 

 After he alights at Sandeshkhali from a motor boat, the villagers will carry Lapierre in a palanquin to a nearby school for the felicitation. 

 ?It would not have been possible to run four mobile hospitals in the Sunderbans without Mr Lapierre?s financial assistance,? said M.A. Wohab, director of Southern Health Improvement Samity. 

 He said Lapierre is bringing two more physicians to help in the mobile hospitals.

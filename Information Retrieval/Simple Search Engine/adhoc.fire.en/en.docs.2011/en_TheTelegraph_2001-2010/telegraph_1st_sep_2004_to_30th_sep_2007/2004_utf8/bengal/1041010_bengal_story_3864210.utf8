 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Oct. 9: Five CPM activists were arrested last night in connection with Tuesday?s molestation of the daughter-in-law of Shefali Malakar, the local secretary of the party?s women?s wing.

 The molestation in Krishnagunj police station area, about 100 km from Calcutta, was meant as retaliation against, Sujon Malakar, the 19-year-old?s brother-in-law, said an officer of Krishnagunj police station. Sujon, the secretary of a local club, did not agree to including only CPM activists as club members.

 Additional police superintendent Biswarup Ghosh said Saumendra Biswas, Bidyut Samadder, Bidhan Laskar, Haridas Sila and Parimal Biswas were arrested last night from Majdia in the same area.

 ?We have charged them with molesting and assaulting the housewife,? he said.

 CPM ousts molest accused

 - Party penalises 67-year-old member

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Barasat, Sept. 15: Adhir 

 Acharya, a 67-year-old member of the CPM?s Panihati branch 

 committee, was expelled today on charges of molesting a 

 13-year-old girl. 

 Police registered a case (no. 166/04) against Acharya under section 354 of the IPC ? relating to molestation ? for abusing the minor girl, a student of Class VII, on September 7 following a complaint by her father, Kalachand Chatterjee. 

 ?We have initiated action against him for a certain incident which I shall not discuss with a newspaper before submitting a report to my party. After all, it is an internal party matter,? said Amitava Bose, the CPM?s North 24-Parganas district secretary. 

 Superintendent of police Parveen Kumar said he has ordered an inquiry into the charges of molestation as well as reports of police assault on the victim?s father, a priest, when he went to lodge a complaint. 

 The order follows Chatterjee?s allegation that an officer of Ghola police station slapped him when he refused to water down his complaint and take the case to a shalishi committee monopolised by local CPM functionaries. 

 According to the police, Acharya had lured the girl to his room when he was alone at home early on the morning of September 7. 

 ?Acharya was alone in the house when the girl went there around 6.30 am on September 7. The girl, who used to frequent Acharya?s place to receive tuition, did not suspect the man?s intentions. Preliminary investigation shows he molested the girl overcoming her feeble resistance,? said a police official. 

 Chatterjee alleged that his daughter came running from Acharya?s house and complained about the assault. ?My daughter started weeping... after much persuasion, she broke down and told my wife of the reprehensible incident. I subsequently lodged a complaint against the CPM man on the same day,? the father said. 

 The local thana, he said, refused to register his complaint initially and asked him to settle the matter through a shalishi meeting. ?I came under tremendous pressure from the police and the local CPM to drop the rape charge against the accused,? he said.

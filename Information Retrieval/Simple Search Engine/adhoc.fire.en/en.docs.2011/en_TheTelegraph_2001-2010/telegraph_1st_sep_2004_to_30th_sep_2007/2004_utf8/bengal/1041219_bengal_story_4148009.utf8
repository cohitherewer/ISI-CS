 No technicians for X-rays

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

Burdwan, Dec. 18: Hundreds of patients are 

being denied healthcare in the district?s apex medical facility because of the 

dearth of technicians for operating X-ray, CT scan, ECG and EEG machines.

 Cancer patients from far-flung areas have to wait for months at Burdwan Medical College and Hospital for the first dose of radiotherapy and some people with broken limbs have had to wait for about two months for a mere X-ray report.

 There are nine technicians for 17 X-ray machines, who also have to man the CT scan, ECG and EEG machines in the hospital.

 ?We have repeatedly urged the district health department to send more technicians, but in vain. We cannot serve the large number of patients with the limited staff. Sometimes, we have to take the help of students of the medical college,? said hospital superintendent Sarit Chowdhury.

 The superintendent said he has written to the district chief medical officer of health, Santosh Kumar Sarangi, urging for four more technicians. ?At least three technicians for the X-ray unit and one for the ECG machine are required,? Chowdhury wrote to Sarangi. 

 The letter also pointed to the cancer patients who have to wait for a long time to undergo radiotherapy.

 Sarangi denied having received any written intimation from the hospital authorities about lack of technicians. ?I don?t look after the affairs of the Burdwan Medical College and Hospital. I am not in a position to say whether there is any shortage of staff,? he said.

 However, the director of medical education, C.R. Maiti, admitted that he was aware of the situation and promised to look into its problems. He said reports have been sought from various hospital superintendents on this score.

 ?We are trying to improve the prevailing condition in hospitals across Bengal,? he said.

 The subdivisional hospitals present a different picture. There are five employees for two X-ray machines at the Katwa subdivisional hospital. The Kalna subdivisional hospital has as many as four technicians to operate the lone X-ray machine. The same is the situation at the Durgapur and Asansol subdivisional hospitals.

 Manju Murshed, deputy superintendent of the Burdwan Medical College and Hospital, deplored this discrepancy in staff allocation. ?While there is surplus staff in the subdivisional hospitals, we are not getting the adequate number of technicians to operate X-ray and other units,? he said.

 Health officials in Calcutta said uneven distribution of technicians across Bengal is hitting the patients hard and several meetings were held to discuss the problem.

 Menu works magic in school 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Jaigaon, Dec. 26: Amit Das, a Class-III student, now looks forward to going to school everyday. Given that he hardly went earlier, even his family was amused. 

 But Das is not the only one to do a turnaround. It is the same story for all 184 students of Hamiltonganj Board Primary School at Kalchini, Jalpaiguri.

 However, Sabita Chowdhury, the principal, is not surprised. Neither is a group of women doing the groundwork for the wonder. Their recipe is simple ? a tasty midday meal.

 The menu churned up for Christmas is probably unheard of in other state-sponsored primary schools. Amit and his fellow mates lunched on pulau and chicken curry without taxing their parents.

 ?The food this group has been serving has kindled an interest among the students to attend classes. More and more children, who earlier kept away from class, are now regulars. The lunch is incentive enough,? said Chowdhury. 

 The scenario was different even a month ago. 

 ?Before this group took over this month, we handed out slips to the children who used to collect 3 kg of rice from a particular ration shop every month. We noticed that the children attended school just for the slips and so decided to rope in this self-help group,? the principal added. 

 Asked how they were managing to feed the children well when many others were struggling to provide khichdi, group leader Maya Sutradhar said: ?The government pays us Rs 400 a month for cooking and another Rs 448 for fuel. We buy the fuel and put in the rest into buying the ingredients for the midday meal. That is why we are able to include egg curry, chicken and, sometimes, fish in the menu.?

 Asked about his sudden love for school, Amit said: ?We do not get to eat such tasty food at home...We look forward to school.? 

 Sutradhar?s 10-member group was formed early last year. Every month, each member contributes Rs 20. The savings are invested in several activities that include rearing of goats and poultry farming.

 Necklace

 Calcutta, Dec. 6: A diamond-studded gold necklace, said to be worth Rs 40 lakh, went missing tonight from an industrialist?s house on Raja Santosh Roy Road in Alipore. 

 The theft apparently took place when relatives, who had come to attend a wedding, were leaving the house. A police officer said: ?The businessman?s wife went to the door to see them off leaving half-packed jewellery in her first-floor bedroom. It seems the ornament went missing then.?

 The police suspect that the chain is still inside the house.

 A Gandhi scores over ex-babus

 OUR BUREAU 

 Calcutta Nov. 2: At least three former secretaries to the Government of India lobbied CPM leaders for appointment as governor till chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee last week decided to recommend Gopal Gandhi, a former diplomat, for the office. 

 Among the aspirants were former foreign secretary Muchkund Dubey, former home secretary K. Padmanabhaiah and former Tripura governor Romesh Bhandari, government officials and CPM managers said today. 

 ?These gentlemen and a few others met CPM leaders like Jyoti Basu, Prakash Karat, Sitaram Yechury, in addition to Buddhababu, at different points in the past few weeks,? one of them said. ?The leaders have known them for years, so they received them and listened to what they had to say.? 

 Politburo member Karat, who is tipped to become general secretary and carries a favourable impression of Mahatma Gandhi?s grandson from a few earlier meetings, brought the diplomat?s name to Bhattacharjee?s attention. 

 Bhattacharjee, who has been on the lookout for a successor to Viren J. Shah, who is due to retire next month, liked Gandhi?s background, especially his secular image, interest in education, lineage and administrative experience. 

 A few days before leaving for Delhi to attend the politburo and central committee meetings between October 29 and 31, Bhattacharjee brought Gandhi?s name to Basu?s attention and urged him to take it up for endorsement at the party?s policy-making level. 

 ?Since he (Bhattacharjee) will have to work with the governor, it is in order for us to go by his preference,? Basu told his colleagues in the politburo and the central committee. ?An elected government must have a governor with whom it is easier to work.? 

 The CPM leadership sounded Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on his opinion about Gandhi ? clearly it did not want to make a move without satisfying itself that all sides concerned with the appointment are in agreement ? and the other figures in the race. Gandhi?s name found favour with both Singh and Congress president Sonia Gandhi. 

 After ensuring the consensus, Bhattacharjee met Union home minister Shivraj Patil on Friday and formally told him of his government?s preference for Gandhi as governor. 

 If the appointment comes through, Gandhi will be the second bureaucrat, after B.D. Pande, to occupy Governor?s House in recent times.

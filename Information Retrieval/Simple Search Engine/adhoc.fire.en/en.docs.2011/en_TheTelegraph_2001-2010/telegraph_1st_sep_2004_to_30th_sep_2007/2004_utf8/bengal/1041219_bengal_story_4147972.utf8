 Fog delays flights, trains

 OUR BUREAU 

 Calcutta, Dec. 18: The fog factor has started throwing flight and train schedules into disarray. 

 Thick fog in several parts of north India today delayed most morning flights from Delhi to Calcutta and the corresponding flights (see chart). Airport officials said the fog, an annual phenomenon, will continue to hit services till late January. 

 About 10 trains from north Indian cities arrived late at the Howrah and Sealdah stations. 

 Till this afternoon, three trains leaving Calcutta had to be rescheduled because the corresponding down trains were late, officials said. The Patna Janshatabdi Express left at 3.45 pm instead of 1.55 pm and the Purbanchal Express at 4.30 pm instead of 1.25 pm. The Sealdah-Varanasi Express left over an hour late at 10.25 pm. 

 Railways officials, too, said fog would continue to delay trains till late January. ?The visibility of the driver gets impaired. It is reduced to less than 50 metres even with fog light at some places,? said Soumitra Majumdar, the chief PRO of Eastern Railway. 

 As trains running at 100 kmph need at least 900 metres to brake and halt, drivers are forced to cut speed. In foggy conditions, trains usually run at only 45 kmph.

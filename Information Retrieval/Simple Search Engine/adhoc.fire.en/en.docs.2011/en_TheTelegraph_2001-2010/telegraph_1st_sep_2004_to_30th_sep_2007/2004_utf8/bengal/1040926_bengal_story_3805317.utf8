 Kashmir pitch for Calcutta tourists 

 - Singapore woos Indians at travel meet

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Sept. 25: Two tourism boards, poles apart but with a common pitch: lure people to come on a holiday. One has sights set on the city, the other is aiming to capture the country. 

 If special Puja discounts are on offer for Calcuttans eyeing a Himalayan experience, there are incentives galore for Indians excited by the Far East. 

 ?We will give 50 per cent discount for two months (before and during the Pujas) at government guesthouses,? announced Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed today, at the 53rd Travel Agents Association of India (TAAI) convention. ?We are also asking hotels to give rebate on accommodation and the civil aviation ministry to offer special apex fares.? 

 After a formal invitation to CPM veteran Jyoti Basu today to visit his lovely state, Mufti aims to get Calcuttans trekking up the mountain passes to enjoy the chill in the air. 

 ?There were 50 lakh pilgrims to Vaishnodevi, four lakh pilgrims to Amarnath and three lakh other tourists. The situation is much better,? he said, brushing aside the recent attempt on his life. ?Things are improving because people want peace. The meeting between Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President Pervez Musharraf is a big bonus.? 

 While Mufti hawked peace, the Singapore Tourism Board quoted numbers in its aggressive pitch for the Indian market. ?Of the 5.5 million tourists so far this year to Singapore, 310,000 were Indians. That?s already a rise of 24 per cent from 2002 ? last year was SARS, so we don?t count it ? which was the second-best tourism year in our history, with 7.6 million visitors. We expect the year to end with eight million visitors, including 450,000 Indians,? said Lim Neo Chian, deputy chairman and chief executive of the board.

 While a sustained campaign is on to attract holidaymakers, the most recent target group is Bollywood. 

 ?At a film awards ceremony in May, we met a lot of producers and directors. We encouraged them to come to Singapore to make films so that Indians can see what the place is like. The response has been tremendous. In fact, we are giving them up to 50 per cent financial support for local filming. There have already been 180 days of shooting in Singapore,? he said.

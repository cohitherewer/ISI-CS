 Doctor trio to be quizzed

 KINSUK BASU 

 Calcutta, Dec. 12: The government today said that the three doctors who put in their papers recently would be called for personal interviews before a decision is taken on their resignations. 

 ?These doctors would have to serve their notice periods, during which they would be called for an interview. We would like to know the reason for their decision to quit before accepting their resignations,? said Prabhakar Chatterjee, the director of health services.

 Dipesh Mondal of Calcutta Medical College, Ashok Kar of SSKM Hospital and Kalyan Bhattacharya of NRS Medical College had quit, allegedly frustrated over the government?s inability to improve basic healthcare. 

 The government said the doctors? observations at the interviews would be taken into consideration while drafting the blueprint of a string of reforms, aimed at better delivery of healthcare. 

 Health officials also said certain other factors would be taken into account while taking a decision on the resignations. The official stand would be in keeping with the finding that a section of non-practising doctors is continuing with private practice, taking the government for a ride. 

 The health department has decided to enforce rules against private practice by non-practising doctors. 

 ?We tried to address some of the issues raised in their resignation letters, but we cannot interfere in someone?s private decision,? said Chatterjee.

 Sources said efforts are on to bridge the gap between practising and non-practising doctors by setting up a separate rung for those who are interested exclusively in hospital administration. 

 Applications for the latter from a section of senior doctors have already reached the health headquarters ? Sasthya Bhawan. Once the decks are cleared, these doctors would be shifted from health services to health administration with marginal benefits. 

 ?The thrust is on expenditure with a cause and for better services. If there has to be any additional investment, there should be a justification with support in terms of cost effectiveness,? said a health official.

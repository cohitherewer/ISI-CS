 Kalpana Pal and her husband Sushil had been living on the boat, 80 km from Calcutta, for the past few days. Police said Sushil could not take his wife to the subdivisional hospital 15 km away because he was not sure how to reach it as the entire area was inundated. He made it to the local health centre but it was shut.

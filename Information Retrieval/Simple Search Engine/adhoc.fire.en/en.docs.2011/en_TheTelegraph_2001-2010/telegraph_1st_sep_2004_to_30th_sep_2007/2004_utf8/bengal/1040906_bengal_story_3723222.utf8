Mathabhanga (Cooch Behar), Sept. 5: Seven wanted 

KLO militants were literally caught napping by the police before dawn today. 

 The rebels, who the law enforcers said had entered the country through Bangladesh with the motive of blowing up a train near Siliguri, were lying low in a flood shelter at Garibpur village in Bairagirhat gram panchayat, about 12 km from here.

 Cooch Behar police superintendent S.S. Panda said in the evening the pre-dawn raid conducted on the basis of intelligence inputs ended without a shot being fired.

 The police received information about the rebels assembly around 10 last night. The officer-in-charge of Mathabhanga police station, Prabir Dey Sarkar, led the raid, Panda said.

 The district police chief said all the militants, barring one, were asleep inside the flood shelter when the police team surrounded the place around 2 am. We are trying to ascertain whether there were others who managed to give us the slip, he added.

 Among the arms and explosives seized were four AK-56 rifles, two pistols possibly of Chinese make, 2 kg of RDX, 496 assault rifle ammunition, 21 rounds of pistol ammunition, 12 magazines, one mobile phone and two grenades. 

 The seven were produced before the subdivisional judicial magistrate amid tight security and were remanded in police custody till September 13.

 Left front minnows snipe at CPM 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Calcutta, Nov. 20: The minor Left front partners, the RSP, CPI and the Forward Bloc, today described the Supreme Court judgement in the plot case as ?shameful?. 

 ?The apex?s court ruling involving none other than Jyoti Basu has definitely shamed us. The clean image which we have maintained by being in the government for 27 years without a break has taken a beating,? said senior RSP leader Sunil Sengupta. 

 He wondered how such irregularities in distribution of Salt Lake plots could occur when a veteran leader like Basu was at the helm of affairs. 

 Another RSP functionary, preferring anonymity, ridiculed the Opposition Trinamul Congress and the Congress for keeping mum. ?Had we not been in the government, we would have stalled Bengal by launching a vigorous movement cashing in on the sensitive issue,? he said. 

 The leader also demanded an emergency Left Front meeting to discuss the case. 

 Going a step further, Forward Bloc state secretary Ashok Ghosh demanded that Basu and his party should come ?clean? on the matter. ?The apex court?s ruling involves Basu and his party and that is why we want the CPM to make its stand clear on the controversial issue,? he said. 

 The CPI was relatively muted in its reaction. ?Though we have nothing to say on the court?s ruling, the development has sent a wrong signal to the people across Bengal,? said Himanshu Das, a CPI secretariat member. 

 Samir Putatunda, an expelled CPM leader, said the ruling has exposed ?the prevailing rampant corruption? within the ruling CPM. 

 Though Alimuddin Street and Basu preferred to keep quiet on the matter after a brief discussion yesterday, many CPM leaders feel the party should come clean.

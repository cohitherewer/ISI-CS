 Vote for controlled college autonomy

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Calcutta, Sept. 29: Academics, teachers? bodies and education experts across Bengal today favoured granting more autonomy to institutions of higher education. 

 But they added a rider: the government should provide full or partial financial assistance to the institutions to exercise some control over them. 

 Recently, Calcutta University decided to grant more autonomy to its affiliate colleges for running post-graduate courses. The colleges will be able to frame syllabi and their examination systems and select their own teachers. 

 The opinion emerged at a meeting chaired by school education minister Kanti Biswas today with vice-chancellors of state-aided varsities, representatives of teachers? bodies and senior officials. 

 Biswas is the chairman of a 10-member expert committee set up by the Centre to review the issue of autonomy in higher education in the country that has been hanging fire since the 1960s. 

 ?The first meeting of the expert committee will be held in Delhi on October 11. Today?s meeting was convened to list the opinions of those handling higher education in our state on the autonomy issue,? Biswas said after the meeting. 

 Leaders of the West Bengal College and University Teachers? Association, a CPM-controlled body opposed to a central proposal to set up autonomous colleges, were invited for their opinion. 

 Also present were higher education minister Satyasadhan Chakraborty and West Bengal Council of Higher Education vice-chairman Subimal Sen.

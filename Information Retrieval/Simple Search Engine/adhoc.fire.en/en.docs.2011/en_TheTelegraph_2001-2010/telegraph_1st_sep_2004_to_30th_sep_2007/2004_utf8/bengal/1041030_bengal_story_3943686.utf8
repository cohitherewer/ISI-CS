 Memory chug in hills for Saif

 Siliguri, Oct. 29: Till 

 Saif Ali Khan reached Siliguri this afternoon, he did not 

 know that the setting for his shoot tomorrow would be the 

 same 125-year-old toy train his mother Sharmila Tagore rode 

 in Aradhana over three decades ago.

 ?I had no idea that this was the same train,? gushed Saif, surprised as he entered the lobby of a hotel here soon after alighting from a grey Mahindra Scorpio that received him at Bagdogra airport.

 ?I just hope that the train works well this time, too, and my film is as big a hit as my mother?s,? said Saif, dressed in a black T-shirt, grey jeans and sunglasses.

 He is here to shoot a song sequence for Parineeta, a Vidhu Vinod Chopra film in which he plays the role of Shekhar. Directed by adman-turned-feature film director Pradip Sarkar, the film has Vidya Balan, Sunjay Dutt, Raima Sen and Diya Mirza (in a guest appearance) in the cast. Vidya, who plays Lalita, also arrived today. Diya is expected on Sunday.

 The three-day shoot is scheduled to take place on the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway tracks between Sukna and Darjeeling and at a tea garden near Bagrakote.

 With music created by Shantanu Moitra, the song will show Shekhar missing his wife Lalita and writing a letter to her. Describing his role in Parineeta, Saif said: ?I think my role in the film is like my father?s (in real life) when he was young.?

 All praise for Bengali cinema, Saif said he would ?love to work? in one but was in no hurry. ?There are a lot of good directors here and I would love to work with them but, as of now, I don?t have any such plans,? he said.

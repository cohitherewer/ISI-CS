 State sacks teacher, school sits on order 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Krishnagar, Nov. 17: In a path-breaking move, the government sacked a teacher over a month ago for getting the job on the basis of a forged marksheet. But Rejjak Mondal has been taking classes as usual ? a situation sources attributed to his connections with the CPM. 

 The government has cracked down, dissolving the managing committee of the Bahirgachhi Bagmara Higher Secondary School in Chapra, Nadia, 140 km from Calcutta, for sitting on the service termination order. 

 The district inspector (DI) of secondary schools, Mahadeb Soren, ordered dissolution of the committee in a letter to headmaster Prabir Saha yesterday. He said no bills proposed by the dissolved committee would be reimbursed. 

 Now, the teachers are jittery about their salary as only the managing committee of a particular school can forward a salary bill. 

 Mondal was the first teacher to be sacked in the state on October 5 for furnishing a forged marksheet. 

 Mondal, who taught history, did his Masters in philosophy from Calcutta University. Nine years ago, Mondal, an expelled CPM member, had erased the word philosophy from his marksheet and replaced it with history. 

 Soren said he received a complaint early this month from managing committee president Shankar Ghosh that Mondal had not been handed the sack order. Earlier, Soren had found Mondal?s name in the salary bill sent by the school. He promptly blocked his pay.

 ?Acting on the complaint, I found the allegations against the managing committee and Mondal are true. So I disbanded the managing committee of the school,? he said. 

 Soren also alleged that committee secretary Sanat Biswas, who is said to enjoy clout with the district CPM leadership, was illegally elected. Both Biswas and headmaster Saha refused to comment. 

 In 1998, the then managing committee of the school, led by secretary Bhajahari Biswas, had lodged a complaint with the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education about Mondal?s marksheet. The board suspended Mondal early this year after an inquiry but allowed him to continue as teacher. The investigation was on. 

 Last month, school education minister Kanti Biswas overruled the board?s decision and sacked Mondal. 

 Soren said the managing committee illegally replaced Bhajahari Biswas last month after Mondal?s dismissal. ?The managing committee led by new secretary Sanat Biswas permitted Mondal to come to school even after being sacked,? he added.

 CM reins unions 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Nov. 10: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today advised central trade unions against adopting militant methods and warned of police action if violence is reported. 

 Almost in the same breath, he promised steps if the police acted against peaceful demonstrations. 

 The chief minister appealed against the practice of gherao and sought cooperation to bring in investment and help in re-industrialisation of the state. 

 In his second meeting with the trade unions since he took over from Jyoti Basu, he apparently stressed that the Left Front government is committed to the working classes. 

 Sources said the one-and-a-half-hour meeting in Writers? Buildings was primarily the result of pressure from Left parties to hear out the trade unions, especially since Bhattacharjee had ?wrongly? projected the unions in several recent speeches. 

 ?We asked him why he was saying two different things in traders? meets and workers? meets. He told us his view on militant trade unionism had been wrongly quoted? But the chief minister clarified he was against gheraos,? said Shankar Saha, president of the state committee of UTUC-Lenin Sarani.

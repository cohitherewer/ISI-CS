 Glare on clinic record tamper 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Oct. 9: Investigations into Dr Sushil Pal?s murder show Biswajyoti Basu, the arrested owner of a clinic in Bally, had tried to leave no evidence of the stay in his clinic of the woman whose advanced pregnancy Pal allegedly refused to end. 

 Sleuths have concluded that Pal was murdered after he refused to do the abortion. 

 Police believe Basu was acquainted with the woman, a doctor attached to Matri Sadan, a clinic run by the local civic authorities. Evidence with them shows Basu had gone out of his way to keep the woman?s name off the nursing home?s attendance register. 

 ?The nursing home maintained a general diary where Biswajyoti?s comments would be recorded on a day-to-day basis. We have noticed certain discrepancies in that diary, strong enough to suggest the man used all his influence to ensure there was no evidence of the lady being admitted,? said R.K. Mohanty, the additional director-general(CID). 

 Basu, a CPM zonal committee member, told his staff to keep the patient?s name and other details, including time of admission, blank. 

 The probe shows records at Matri Sadan were also tampered with. The doctor was marked absent on the day she was allegedly admitted to Basu?s clinic. Later, a correction liquid was used and ?present? put in the slot. 

 ?This, possibly, establishes the woman?s efforts in protecting Basu. Why would anyone try to do that ? at such risk ? unless she knew him well?? asked a police official.

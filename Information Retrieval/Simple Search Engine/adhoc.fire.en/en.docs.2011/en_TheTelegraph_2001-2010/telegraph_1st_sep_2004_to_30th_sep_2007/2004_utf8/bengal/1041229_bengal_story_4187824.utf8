 Training to tackle calamity

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 28: On a day the tsunami stood in the way of a bill in the Assembly, the government unveiled a disaster management plan.

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said Japanese experts, who are familiar with earthquakes and tsunami, would be consulted for training of officials in the state. 

 Civil defence minister Srikumar Mukherjee said the government would also initiate a separate training programme for volunteers at the block level from January 10. 

 ?We have identified 165 blocks as disaster prone. An army of people would be prepared to handle the aftermath of crises in future. At least 40 volunteers in each of these 165 blocks would be trained,? Mukherjee said. Initially, volunteers in seven blocks would be trained to tackle disasters probable in those areas. 

 ?We are now preparing the course contents for the 10-day training,? the minister said.

 Six possible calamities have been identified ? earthquakes, landslides, cyclones, floods and water-logging, flash-floods and industrial disasters. 

 Mentioning the programme involving the Japanese experts, Mukherjee said it has not been decided yet whether they will come here or civil defence officials would go there. 

 A similar programme would also be organised involving Bangladeshi experts, who would train officials from the state in ways to deal with flood-related crises.

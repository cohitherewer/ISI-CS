 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, Sept. 5: Defence minister Pranab Mukherjee said the Centre is yet to decide on Bengals demand for deployment of Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) along the Indo-Nepal border in view of trouble in the kingdom. 

 We have asked the state government to sound an alert along the Indo-Nepal border and control any spillover impact if any, he said.

 Behrampore: A mob ransacked the Jangipur sub-divisional hospital and an adjacent chemists shop when a patient died on being given an injection past its expiry date. The owner was arrested. 

 Krishnagar: Trinamul Congress activists paralysed train services for more than four hours by putting up blockades at about 20 stations in Nadia. It was a message that the party will not allow Krishnagar CPM MP Jyotirmoyee Sikdar, wife of Avtar Singh, who has been arrested in connection with a sleaze racket, to enter Nadia.

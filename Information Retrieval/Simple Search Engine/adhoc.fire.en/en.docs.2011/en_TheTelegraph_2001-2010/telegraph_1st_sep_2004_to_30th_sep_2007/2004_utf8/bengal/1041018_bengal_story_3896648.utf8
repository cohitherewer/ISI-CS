 Allies vent ire on CPM 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Siliguri, Oct. 17: The CPM?s allies in the Siliguri Municipal Corporation have refused to nominate their representatives to the three mayors-in-council berths offered to them in protest against the selection of a CPM man for the deputy mayor?s post. 

 Breaking convention, CPM mayor Bikash Ghosh yesterday announced the name of Nurul Islam as the new deputy mayor.

 The RSP, Forward Bloc and the CPI also warned that they might stay away from regular affairs of the civic body. 

 Islam?s nomination has exposed the ?CPM?s inability to compromise?, RSP?s Darjeeling district secretary Benoy Chakraborty said today.

 Observers feel the ?controversial nomination? could put a question mark on the functioning of the new board. Sources said the ?unilateral? CPM decision to nominate Islam defied Left Front chairman Biman Bose?s post-poll advice to resolve disputes ?amicably?.

 For the past 15 years, CPI?s Harisadhan Ghosh, who lost to Nantoo Pal of the Congress this time, had held the post.

 A front meeting in Calcutta tomorrow will debate the developments afresh, leaders among the allies said. ?The way Islam was chosen deputy mayor is without precedent in Left politics in the state. The unilateral nomination exposes the CPM?s failure to manage its allies at the local level,? said the RSP district secretary. 

 The mayor today tried to justify his selection saying: ?It was a collective decision of the party to select Islam as the deputy mayor.? 

 A political observer said the party?s choice reveals local MLA and urban development and municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya?s choice.

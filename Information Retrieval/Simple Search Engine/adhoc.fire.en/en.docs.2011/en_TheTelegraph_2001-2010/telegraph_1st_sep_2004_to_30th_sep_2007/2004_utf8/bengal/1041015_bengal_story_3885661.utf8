 Brothers avenge dad?s death

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Behrampore, Oct. 14: In a revenge murder reminiscent of vendetta killings by the mafia, two brothers hacked to death a man accused of doing the same to their father. 

 Two years ago, Atiul Sheikh had killed Azizul Haque on the day of Mahalaya following a land dispute. Mirshad and Hamidul killed Atiul with scythes yesterday, the day of Mahalaya, in Domkol, Murshidabad, 235 km from Calcutta. 

 Atiul had been arrested and released on bail later. Fearing the brothers, he had rented a house at Lakshminarayanpur, some villages away from his native Sambhunagar. 

 Superintendent of police Gyanwant Singh said the brothers, who are absconding, ?lay in wait around 8 pm yesterday, when Atiul came cycling to the Domkol market?.

 Rape arrest

 The Murshidabad police today arrested Sajed Khan, who was let off by the CPM with a fine of Rs 10,000 for raping a Class VI student. Singh said a rape case has been registered against the resident of Hariharpara, 225 km from Calcutta.

 Land whiff in child murder 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Ganesh: Victim of greed? 

 Calcutta, Dec. 24: Sleuths probing the kidnap and murder of four-year-old Ganesh Palodhi indicated that rivalry over the timber business of his father was not a motive even as two more persons were arrested last night. 

 Four persons have been held so far in the case, in which the son of a Howrah businessman was kidnapped and found strangled even after his father paid ransom. 

 CID officials believe the gang behind the crime was looking to make a fast buck by fleecing Siddhartha, Ganesh?s father. After preliminary investigation, they suggested that the gang could have been tempted by Siddhartha?s recent investments in real estate in Bauria, 40 km from Calcutta. 

 The sleuths said Siddhartha?s timber trade was being superseded as his main source of income by his dealings in real estate. He would buy small plots and hand them over to realtors for development. He could have made enemies who envied his investment spree. 

 To justify their claim, they pointed out that one of the persons arrested in connection with his son?s abduction is Jagannath Khara, a man connected to the real estate business and not the timber trade. 

 ?It appears that Siddhartha was bargaining for a plot of land, ranging between Rs 1 lakh and Rs 50,000, and those involved in the process wanted a commission, which he refused,? said a senior CID official, hinting at the revenge angle. 

 Digging into details of Siddhartha?s income, the sleuths have found that besides his timber earnings, he used to receive about Rs 12,000-13,000 as rent from his house. His wife used to earn Rs 15,000 every month as an assistant manager of Eastern Railway?s Yatri Niwas at Howrah station. 

 ?At the end of the year, he was saving close to Rs 1 lakh and wanted to invest in land to get returns. It appears that Siddhartha?s intention sent wrong signals to people close to him and also those in his family, who thought that he had lot of cash to spare,? an official said.

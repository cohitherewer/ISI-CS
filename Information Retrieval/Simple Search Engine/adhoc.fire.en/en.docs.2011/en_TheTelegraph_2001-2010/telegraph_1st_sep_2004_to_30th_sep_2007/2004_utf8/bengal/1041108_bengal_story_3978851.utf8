 Hospital puja probe

 Midnapore, Nov. 7: The government has ordered an inquiry into the construction of a Kali puja pandal on the Contai Subdivisional Hospital premises in East Midnapore.

 Director of health services Prabhakar Chatterjee said he has sought a report from the district chief medical officer of health. ?A Kali puja cannot be organised inside a hospital because it is illegal. I will take up the matter with the district authorities,? he said.

 Chatterjee had earlier ordered probe into a Durga puja inside the state general hospital at Chakdah in Nadia. ?I am yet to receive the report but the Nadia authorities have assured me that no puja will be allowed next year,? he said.

 Club Favourite, which organises the puja in Contai, 140 km from Calcutta, said it has been doing so for 19 years.

 Behrampore, Dec. 7: Murshida Bibi lay outside Behrampore Sadar Hospital gasping for breath as her distraught family was told there was no vacancy in the female ward. Finally, she was accommodated in a bed with another patient. 

 In another corner of the 40-bed ward, 70-year-old Bina Roy?s day had just begun. Her belongings were strewn around as she sipped her morning tea. It?s a ritual she has been going through for the last 15 months since she was admitted with respiratory problems. 

 She looks like she has been cured. Once or twice a week, she makes a trip by rickshaw to her son in her house in Goaljan village, half-a-kilometre from Behrampore town. But she always comes back to occupy her bed in the overcrowded 250-bed hospital, 200 km from Calcutta. 

 She gets two meals a day and the medicines she needs. The superintendent is unaware of the resident patient. 

 ?I have no place to go really. At my village home, my son Kali lives with his family. He works as a cook in a small hotel and finds it difficult to make both ends meet. I cannot stay with him as I will become a burden,? said Bina. 

 Whenever she feels like meeting Kali, she walks out and begs. Once she had raised the fare, she sets off for Goaljan.

 ?We know her (Bina) for over a year and everyone loves her. We organise food and medicines for her. Doctors make arrangements to renew her bed ticket,? said Kamalesh Chatterjee, ward master. 

 But superintendent Indranath Banerjee said: ?It is not possible for any patient to occupy a bed for 15 months. No one has told me about it. I am going to inquire and take action against those responsible.?

 50 kg stacked on tormentor jawans 

 ANURADHA SHARMA LAKHOTIA 

 Siliguri, Nov. 18: A platoon 

 commander of a paramilitary force has been suspended along 

 with a jawan and the rest of his 13-member group ordered 

 to parade 5 km everyday in an exemplary crackdown after 

 tourists complained of harassment. 

 The Sashastra Suraksha Bal platoon manning the Garibas outpost, 53 km from here, was punished after a tour operator lodged a complaint about troops misbehaviour, which forced two of his British clients to cancel a trip to Sandakphu on Monday. 

 The force is deployed along the border with Nepal and Bhutan. ?On the basis of preliminary investigations, we decided to suspend a jawan and the platoon commander of Garibas,? a senior SSB official said. ?We will decide on the final action after we get the inquiry report.? 

 SSB deputy inspector-general Tshering Namgyal, who is in charge of the paramilitary force in the region, said the platoon had been removed from the outpost on the Nepal border. 

 ?It is up to the commandant, who is conducting the probe, to decide where the parade (in full gear and with a load of 50 kg) will take place and the punishment will continue until further notice,? Namgyal said. The DIG said the final report is expected in two days. 

 Peter Lobo of Gurudongma Tours and Treks had alleged that the jawans had harassed him and his two British clients, who were on a birdwatching tour, and threatened to ?cut them into pieces? if they dared defy the jawans. 

 The chain of events began on Sunday when Lobo and the Britons were on their way to Garibas. According to the complaint, the group was accosted by a jawan who forced his luggage into their Landrover and demanded a lift. 

 ?He was politely refused. The jawan then threatened Lobo with dire consequences if he proceeded to Sandakphu,? Jimmy Singh, the president of Gurudongma Tours and Treks, said in his complaint. On Monday, Lobo was intercepted by some jawans on the way to Sandakphu and forced off the vehicle. ?He was threatened with loss of life after being branded a terrorist. They also snatched his binoculars. All this happened in front of the foreigners, who were told they will be cut to pieces,? Singh said.

 Shaken by the incident, the group called off its trip.

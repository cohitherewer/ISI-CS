 Servant trapped with widow?s wealth

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Dec. 4: The three-day domestic help of a widow today cleaned out her almirah and walked out of her apartment, but could not go far. He was caught within a few hours, waiting for a bus to Bihar, with the over Rs 6-lakh booty. 

 The alacrity of Calcutta police ? a word rarely associated with the force now ? prompted new commissioner Prasun Mukherjee to declare a cash reward for the investigating team from Bhowanipore police station. 

 Kusum Neotia, 43, was lucky. Around 10.30 am, Manoj Yadav, the new domestic help from Banka in Bihar, walked into her room when she was alone in her sprawling flat on the top floor of Alexander Court on Chowringhee Road. He asked for the keys to the almirah. As soon as she stood up, he struck her on her head with an iron rod. She collapsed in a heap and lost consciousness. 

 Manoj took ornaments worth Rs 5 lakh and Rs 1.2 lakh in cash, packed them in a bag and walked out after shutting the front door. As Kusum, who had lost her husband a few months ago, lay motionless, the 22-year-old servant headed straight for home. 

 ?Almost two-and-a-half hours later when her son called up from the ground floor office, no one responded. After there was no response to repeated calls, her 17-year-old son walked up along with others from the office in search of his mother,? said Anuj Sharma, deputy commissioner, south. 

 As they banged on the door, Kusum regained her senses and crawled to the door and opened the automatic latch. The theft was immediately discovered and those employed in the family?s export business and Kusum?s neighbours swung into action. 

 The police were called in. The detectives collected details about Manoj?s background and asked the neighbours to describe him and his gait. After a brief discussion with senior officers, the team split. One headed towards Howrah and the other for Babughat bus stand. 

 ?While scanning the crowd that would usually take the long-distance buses from the Babughat, we spotted Manoj at a distance. He realised that we were after him and immediately started running. But we chased him and arrested him,? said an investigating officer. The entire amount was recovered from him.

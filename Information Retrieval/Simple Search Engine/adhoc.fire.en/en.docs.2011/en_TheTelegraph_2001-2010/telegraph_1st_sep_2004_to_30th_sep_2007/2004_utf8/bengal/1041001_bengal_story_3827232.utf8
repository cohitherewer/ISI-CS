 Exam plan 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Calcutta, Sept. 30: Authorities of various school education boards in the state have decided to work on a strategy to introduce a continuous, round-the-year system of evaluation ? on the lines of the Delhi-based ISCE and CBSE boards ? instead of promoting students only on the basis of their performance in annual examinations. 

 The Association of Boards of School Education in Bengal ? a body of officials of the boards holding major school-leaving examinations ? began an exercise today to implement the decision by next year. 

 ?The continuous and comprehensive process of evaluation is the best way to measure achievement levels of students. It is also the best way to identify and rectify students? deficiencies,? Dibyendu Hota, president of the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education, said. The other boards that attended the discussion were West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education, West Bengal Board of Primary Education, West Bengal Board of Madarsa Education and Rabindra Mukta Vidyalaya. 

 The ISCE and CBSE-affiliated schools evaluate students on the basis of performances in class tests, unit tests, block tests, terminal examinations and, finally, the annual examination.

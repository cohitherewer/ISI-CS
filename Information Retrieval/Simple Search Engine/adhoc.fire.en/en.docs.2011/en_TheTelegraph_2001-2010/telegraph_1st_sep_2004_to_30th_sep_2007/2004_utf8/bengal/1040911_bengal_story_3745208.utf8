 Asim opens puja purse

 Calcutta, Sept. 10: The cash-strapped Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government today announced bonus and festival advance for government employees, teachers and employees of educational institutions, panchayats, municipalities and statutory bodies.

 ?The scale of payment will remain the same as last year,? finance minister Asim Dasgupta said. The government will shell out Rs 71 crore for the bonus and ex-gratia.

 Those drawing a salary of up to Rs 8,300 a month as basic plus dearness allowance would be offered an ad-hoc bonus/ex-gratia of Rs 1,000. An advance of Rs 1,000 would be given to those who draw above Rs 8,300 and up to Rs 12,000. Pensioners would be given Rs 400 as ex-gratia. The largesse would be disbursed by October 15. 

 Asked if he was willingly offering the bonus despite the funds crunch, Dasgupta said: ?When we are announcing the bonus, we want to give it.?

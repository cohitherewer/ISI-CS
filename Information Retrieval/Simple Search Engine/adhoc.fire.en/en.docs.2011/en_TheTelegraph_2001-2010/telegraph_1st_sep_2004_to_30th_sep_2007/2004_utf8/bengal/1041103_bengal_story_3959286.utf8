 Buddha industry haven in Howrah 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Howrah, Nov. 2: The chief minister today announced a string of schemes for industry here, which includes setting up of parks for the relocation of small-scale units scattered across the district.

 Addressing the 11th annual meeting of the Howrah Chamber of Commerce and Industries at Sarat Sadan, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said his government is determined to revive the glory of Howrah?s small-scale industries. 

 Dotted with small and mid-sized units, Howrah was once called the Manchester of the East. Bhattacharjee said: ?The backbone of this industrial belt is small-scale industries. We are taking all possible steps to develop such units here.?

 A location in Uluberia has already been selected for setting up a park exclusively for garment-manufacturers, the chief minister said. A hunt is on for sites to set up similar parks where foundries, food-processing, rubber, chemical and plastic units could be shifted.

 However, the chief minister promised industry representatives at the meet that the government will not force any unit to shift to the parks if they feel the relocation would make them less viable. ?Our government believes in cooperation and coordination. The units are free to remain where they are if they want to,? he said.

 The parks are likely to help the sector get more organised and rescue the district from increasing pollution. 

 After a chat on problems that industry and managements were facing in Howrah, Bhattacharjee asked mayor Gopal Mukherjee to look into demands regarding the restructuring of civic levies.

 Industrialists complained that they were paying higher power tariffs compared to those in the Asansol-Durgapur industrial belt.

 The chief minister said he will speak to the Calcutta University authorities when the industrialists wanted CU to introduce more business management and science and technology courses in the district.

 Depot deals monitor

 Twin track: A film being shot at the Tollygunge depot

 Calcutta, Sept. 18: The government has set up a five-member committee led by transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury to monitor the process of developing the Tollygunge and Gariahat tram depots by private builders. 

 ?We want to make all the deals transparent to avoid any controversy. The committee will examine the offers from the private parties, verify their capacity and efficiency, shortlist them and oversee the entire process. We will soon hold a meeting to take a decision whether the depots will be leased out or the project will be implemented as a joint venture,? Chowdhury said. 

 Other members include the chairman and managing director of the Calcutta Tram Company and two senior officers of the the transport and finance departments. 

 A paucity of funds that hampered infrastructure development apparently led to the plan. 

 The Tollygunge depot stands on 28 bighas and the Gariahat depot on 8.5 bighas. The department intends to raise at least Rs 200 crore from the projects, in addition to developing the terminuses. The funds will be utilised to repair tracks and buy the building housing the CTC headquarters on R.. Mukherjee Road.

 The committee was born in the wake of a recent controversy involving a private party in the development of the Ultadanga bus terminus of the North Bengal State Transport Corporation. The Assembly subject committee on transport, led by Trinamul Congress MLA Sadhan Pande, objected to the deal and demanded a probe. 

 CTC officials said about 50 offers 

 have been received and most of them are for constructing 

 commercial complexes.

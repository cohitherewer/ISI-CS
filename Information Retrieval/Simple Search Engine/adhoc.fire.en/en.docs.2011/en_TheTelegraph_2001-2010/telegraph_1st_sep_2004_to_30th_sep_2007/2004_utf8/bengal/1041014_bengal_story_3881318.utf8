 Barasat: A mob went on the rampage at a house in Kazipara in North 24-Parganas, 30 km from Calcutta, on Tuesday night after a 21-year-old housewife allegedly committed suicide. Police said Barnali Patra was pregnant and her relatives and friends from Khardah stormed the house, accusing her in-laws of killing her for dowry. The police held 26 persons for the raid and also arrested Barnali?s husband, Buddhadeb, and his mother.

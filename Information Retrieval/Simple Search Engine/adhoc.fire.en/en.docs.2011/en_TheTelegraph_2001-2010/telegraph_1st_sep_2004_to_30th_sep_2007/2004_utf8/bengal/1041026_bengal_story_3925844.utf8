 Get set for mountain marathon 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Darjeeling, Oct. 25: Stopping to smell the rhododendrons or soaking in the scenery will be the last thing on the minds of 49 athletes who will arrive at Mirik for the Mount Everest Challenge Marathon.

 The race, to be flagged off on Sunday, will see participants from 14 countries cover almost 128 km from Maneybhanjyang to Rimbik in five days. 

 ?The event is being organised by the Delhi-based Run and Trek group. We will provide logistical support,? said D.T. Tamlong, a Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council official. 

 The decision to hold the 2004 marathon on this route, Tamlong said, was prompted by the urge to negate bad publicity insurgents were giving to the once-favoured trail. ?Volunteers will also walk the trek track to collect the junk left behind by visitors.? 

 The runners will cover 30 km ? from Maneybhanjyang to Sandakphu ? on Day 1. After an overnight rest, they will trot down to Mollay Gaon from where they will take a ?U? turn and return to Sandakphu. 

 On Day III, they will go downhill to Rimbik via Phalut. After a night?s halt, the runners will return to Rimbick to get set for the final run back to Maneybhanjyang.

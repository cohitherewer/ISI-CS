 Sunday exception for Mother

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Sept. 4: Churches across Bengal will observe feast day on Sunday, coinciding with Mother Teresas seventh death anniversary. 

 Celebrations that started on August 26, her birth anniversary, received a boost after the Vatican allowed a requiem (special prayers) in memory of Mother Teresa, waiving the ban on personal mass on Sundays, known as Lords Day. 

 We were very happy to hear that the Vatican has made an exception and have permitted special prayers to be organised tomorrow at Mother House, said a spokesperson for the Missionaries of Charity. 

 Ever since the Vatican beatified the Nobel laureate last October conferring the title Blessed Teresa of Calcutta, it was announced by the Pope that her death anniversary would be known as feast day.

 Webel on the boil over closure

Calcutta, Sept. 28: Euphemism like early retirement 

scheme (not voluntary retirement) and industrial restructuring (instead of closure) 

and commitment to redeploy displaced labourers may go hand-in-hand with the Left?s 

pro-labour policies, but the labour unions in Webel are not convinced. 

 With the shutdown deadline of four Webel subsidiaries ? Webel Carbon and Metal Film Resistors, Webel Crystals, Webel Capacitors and Webel Video Devices ? just two days away, despair and discontent peaked in the units spread between Taratala and Salt Lake. About 450 employees will lose jobs when the curtains come down on these companies. 

 ?We think the closure notice is illegal. These companies can be revived and a report by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India supports our claim,? said a representative of Webel Banchao Sangram Committee, an umbrella organisation of various unions. 

 The members of the fledgling outfit today submitted a deputation with Webel chairman Alok Mukherjea, demanding withdrawal of the notice and staged a day-long agitation in front of Webel Bhavan. Besides slamming the government, the protesters held senior Webel officials responsible for the state of affairs in the four units. Leaders of Citu, the CPM?s labour arm, were also not spared. 

 ?Though Citu is the biggest union, it has remained silent. Disillusioned Citu supporters have joined us and we will fight till the government withdraws the decision,? said a middle-aged employee of Webel Carbon. 

 Information technology minister Manab Mukherjee, whose department controls affairs in Webel and its subsidiaries, ruled out a rethink. 

 ?The four units were not viable and so it was decided to wind them up and offer compensation to the workers. I don?t see any chance of us going back on the decision,? Mukherjee said. 

 The British Department for International Development, which has given the state a grant of Rs 220 crore, is funding the restructuring in Webel and other state-owned sick units. 

 The workers, according to the early retirement scheme, were given two options. One was computed on basic and dearness allowance of 45 days a year for the number of years in service and the other on 35 days a year for the number of years in service and 25 days a year for years left. The other components of the scheme included 25 days? gratuity per year, encashment of leaves and provident fund dues, skill augmentation programmes and insurance cover. 

 ?The compensation is not adequate and no one is accepting temporary re-employment,? a Webel employee said.

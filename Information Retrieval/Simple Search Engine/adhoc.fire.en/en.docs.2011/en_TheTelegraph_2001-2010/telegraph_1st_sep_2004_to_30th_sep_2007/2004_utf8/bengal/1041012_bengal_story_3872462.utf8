 HC orders dead teacher dues

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 11: The high court today asked the government to clear in three weeks all dues and benefits of Dulal Pal, who retired as a high school headmaster and died fighting for his rights in court.

 Justice Indira Banerjee ordered that Pal?s dues be delivered to his 95-year-old mother, Ranu Pal, who is in a coma at Nabadwip Hospital, 100 km from Calcutta. 

 Since the death of Pal, a bachelor, four years ago, his mother had been waging the war for justice.

 The management of Samudragarh High School in Burdwan suspended Pal a year before his retirement in 1988 and denied his statutory benefits. Pal challenged the suspension in the high court and demanded the dues.

 On August 4, 1988, Justice S.B. Sinha quashed the suspension order and asked the authorities to pay him all dues, including salary and pension, by that December.

 As the school management and the education department failed to comply with the order, Pal moved a contempt petition. But the files containing the case history went missing from the court and the judge could not hear the case.

 The former headmaster moved pillar to post in the court to activate officials to locate the file, but in vain. On January 16, 2000, he died without getting a paisa.

 Ranu Pal then moved the high court with the prayer that she be allowed to pursue her dead son?s case. Subir Debnath, her lawyer, told the court that ?she had every right to her late son?s money?. 

 The mother was allowed to fight for the dues and pursue the contempt suit.

 When the case came up for hearing then, the court officers could not produce the relevant file. The judge asked them to trace it out, but it was missing at the next hearing, too. Banerjee then asked the officers to reconstruct the file. 

 She took up the case today after the duplicated file was produced in court. The school and the government were slammed for harassing an ailing woman and denying a teacher his dues. In case Ranu Pal breathes her last by the time the dues are cleared, the money will go to Pal?s heir.

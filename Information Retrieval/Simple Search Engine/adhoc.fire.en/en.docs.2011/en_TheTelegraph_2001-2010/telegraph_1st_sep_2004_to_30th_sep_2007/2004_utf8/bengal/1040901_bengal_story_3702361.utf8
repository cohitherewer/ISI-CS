 Harass slur on Citu leader 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Aug. 31: A Citu leader and a Calcutta police constable have been arrested for allegedly harassing a woman and trying to grab her two-storey house.

 Police said Maya Roy, a widow living in the town about 85 km from Calcutta, had complained against Biswanath Pramanik of her locality accusing him of trying to grab her house. Roy told the police that Pramanik was accusing her of failure to repay money she owed him though she had paid back. 

 Pramanik, a policeman, was arrested last night. But Mintu Chatterjee, a Citu district committee member, allegedly dragged Roy from her house this morning and took her to the Nadia court to make her withdraw the complaint.

 The police said when Chatterjee arrived at the court with Roy, she gave him a slip and made it to Kotwali police station, a kilometre away, and lodged an FIR against Chatterjee. 

 The police said the Citu leader was held on charges of kidnapping and forcing Roy to withdraw the case.

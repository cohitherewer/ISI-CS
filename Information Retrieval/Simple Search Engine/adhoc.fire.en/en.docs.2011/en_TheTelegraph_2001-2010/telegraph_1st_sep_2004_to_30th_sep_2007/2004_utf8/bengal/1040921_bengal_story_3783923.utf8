 Aid and alarm for flood-hit five 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 20: Last week?s rain and release of water from reservoirs have led to floods in five districts and affected over 17 lakh people. 

 Finance minister Asim Dasgupta today called the situation in North 24-Parganas, Nadia, Murshidabad, Burdwan and Birbhum ?alarming? and released Rs 5 crore for relief. 

 ?The rainfall may have lessened and the quantity of water released from dams has also come down, but the situation remains alarming,? Dasgupta said. About 1.18 lakh people have taken shelter in 442 relief camps in the five districts.

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had a videoconference with the district magistrates this morning. ?I have asked Asim to take stock of the situation in North 24-Parganas and Nadia. The relief minister will tour the flood-hit areas of Murshidabad,? he said in the evening.

 Dasgupta said leaves of all concerned officials in the affected districts have been cancelled. 

 The chief medical officers of the affected districts have been put on alert and asked to stay prepared for the possible outbreak of water-borne diseases.

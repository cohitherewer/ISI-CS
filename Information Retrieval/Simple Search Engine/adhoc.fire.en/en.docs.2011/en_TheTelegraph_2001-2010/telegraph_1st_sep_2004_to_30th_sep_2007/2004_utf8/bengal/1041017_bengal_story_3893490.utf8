 Big Brother breaks norm 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Siliguri, Oct. 16: In a departure from Left Front convention, the CPM today denied its allies the deputy mayor?s post in the Siliguri Municipal Corporation. 

 Despite opposition from the front partners, CPM mayor Bikash Ghosh selected partyman Nurul Islam for the post.

 According to convention, the second largest Left party in the civic election should have selected the deputy mayor.

 The results of the Siliguri polls had thrown up a peculiar situation with no single party securing the No. 2 slot. While the CPM won 30 seats, each of the other front allies (the RSP, the CPI and the Forward Bloc) notched up two seats each.

 In the absence of a consensus despite marathon meetings regarding the candidature of Islam, whose name was suggested by local MLA and urban development and municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya, Ghosh used his prerogative. Islam was picked immediately after the oath-taking. He also retained the public works department portfolio in the civic body.

 Darjeeling district magistrate Ariz Aftab administered the oath of office to the 47 board members led by Dilip Singh, who was appointed chairman. 

 Mukul Sengupta, Paritosh Das, Partha Choudhury and Saradindu Chakraborty of the CPM were appointed mayors in council. No names were announced for the three remaining mayors-in-council posts. 

 While talking to reporters after the oath-taking, Ghosh said: ?They are left for our allies. The official declaration of the post holders will be made only after our allies submit the names they want to propose.? 

 The allies called the CPM?s ?unilateral? decision ?unprecedented?. Some of the leaders also threatened to take up the denial at the next state Left Front meeting.

 ?The decision to choose the deputy mayor from the CPM has been taken unilaterally by the CPM, which is unprecedented. Such a breach of convention has never taken place in any other municipal corporation in the state. We will discuss the matter at the state-level Left Front meeting on October 18 in Calcutta,? said Benoy Chakraborty, the district secretary of the RSP.

 In Calcutta, RSP leader Sunil Sengupta said the ?unhappy development? in Siliguri would affect front unity in the future. ?If minor Front partners continue to be sidelined this way, we will lose our relevance,? said the leader of a Left party.

 Parents shun vaccine

 - Civic issues, superstition amp; bungling stall polio drive 

 OUR BUREAU

 Oct. 10: No matter how much celluloid icons exhort parents to have their children vaccinated against polio, villages in Nadia, Murshidabad and South 24-Parganas continued to resist the pulse-polio drive.

 Many of them cited local issues like delay in electrification, bad roads and lack of flood control to justify staying away from health camps today. 

 In Nadia, about 1,000 residents of Birpur in Nakashipara, about 130 km from Calcutta, protested against the absence of electricity after 27 years of Left Front rule. 

 Health workers who sensed that no one would come to the booth went door to door, but parents of about 400 children asked them to get out. 

 When the chief of the CPM-led panchayat samiti, Tushar Kanti Ghosh, and block medical officer Himangshu Mondal went to the village, they were gheraoed for three-and-a-half hours till personnel from Nakashipara police station came to the rescue. 

 At Chhotoitna village in Kaligunj, 150 km from Calcutta, parents of more than 50 children refused to get their children vaccinated protesting against lack of arsenic-free drinking water tubewells. At Brittihuda village in Chapra, the rallying point was roads.

 In Murshidabad, several villages in Suti and Jalangi, about 250 km from Calcutta, demanded flood control measures and roads. Chief medical officer of health Sachchidananda Sarkar said: ?Over 1,000 parents refused polio drops for their children here. We have asked the administration to look into their demands.?

 Civic issues vied with superstition in keeping parents away. Residents of Hazampara in Budge Budge, 15 km from Calcutta, were told by panchayat member Shahidul Islam that the vaccine could lead to ?mad cow? disease, said South 24-Parganas chief medical officer of health P.K. Mondal. In Kulti, 110 km from Calcutta, villagers questioned the efficacy of frequent drives.

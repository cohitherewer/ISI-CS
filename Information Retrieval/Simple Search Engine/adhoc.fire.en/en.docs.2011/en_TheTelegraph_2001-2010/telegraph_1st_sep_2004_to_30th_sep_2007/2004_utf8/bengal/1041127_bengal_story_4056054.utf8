 Bullets fly in land brawl 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Nov. 26: Akbar Mal, a 37-year-old resident of Bediapara near Lake Town, was admitted to R.G. Kar hospital with bullet injuries this evening after a stand-off with a neighbour. 

 According to police, Mal?s neighbour Bashiruddin Mondal came to his house with some miscreants to settle an old score over disputed land. A heated discussion ensued and the row soon snowballed into a scuffle. Some of Bashiruddin?s accomplices fired at Mal in the melee, injuring him in a hand and a leg. 

 Sensing trouble, Bashiruddin and the others fled. No arrests had been made till late tonight.

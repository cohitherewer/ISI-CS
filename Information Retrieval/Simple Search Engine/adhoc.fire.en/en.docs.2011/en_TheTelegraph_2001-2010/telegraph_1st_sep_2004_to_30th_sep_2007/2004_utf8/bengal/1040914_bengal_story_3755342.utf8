 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, Sept. 13: Tata group chief Ratan Tata has written to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee expressing his intent of setting up a cancer hospital.

 ?There is good news. The Tatas have sent me a formal letter today about their decision to set up a cancer hospital in Calcutta,? a beaming Bhattacharjee told reporters while leaving Writer?s Buildings this evening. ?They have promised to send a detailed project report soon,? the chief minister added. During a visit to the city last week, Tata had said: ?We have not done as much as we should have done in this state. So, we?re looking at Bengal now.?

 Calcutta: The cabinet will on Wednesday decide on allotting 980 acres to the Damodar Valley Corporation for two 500 mw thermal power units in Burdwan. The planning commission has cleared the proposal.

 Krishnagar: Saurav Sharma, a Class VI student of Phulia Vidyamandir in Shantipur, who was thrown out of class for not wearing the school badge 11 days ago, is missing since. Father Sukumar said Saurav?s sister, who studies in the same school, 70 km from Calcutta, told him that the ?teacher had asked him to leave the class?. Headmaster Sunil Ghosh denied the charge.

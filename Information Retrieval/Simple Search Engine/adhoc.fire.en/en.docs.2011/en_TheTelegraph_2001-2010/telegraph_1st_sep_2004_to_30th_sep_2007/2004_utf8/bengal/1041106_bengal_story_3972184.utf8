 Calcutta, Nov. 5: The government will, at long last, release funds to get the heritage commission going. 

 Finance minister Asim Dasgupta announced the loosening of the purse strings today after Barun De, a commission member, said the body meant for collection, preservation, interpretation and analyses of heritage materials had not ?got off the ground? because of lack of wherewithal. 

 They were speaking at the opening of a seminar organised by the Centre for Archaeological Studies amp; Training on ?Archaeology of early historic South Asia.

 Earlier, Dasgupta released a collection of the writings of Hitesranjan Sanyal, the barefoot historian who studied 1,400 temples and Vaishnava kirtans single-handed and had a remarkable insight into grassroots politics.

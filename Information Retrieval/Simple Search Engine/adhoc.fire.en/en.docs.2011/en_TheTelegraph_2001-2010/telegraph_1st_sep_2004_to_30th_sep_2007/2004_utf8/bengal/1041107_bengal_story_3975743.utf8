 Sonia nod to take on CPM 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Nov. 6: Congress president Sonia Gandhi today gave a green signal to state party leaders to step up their movement against the CPM in Bengal, though the Left parties are backing the ruling coalition at the Centre.

 ?Soniaji told us that there will be no let up in our movement against the communists who have unleashed terror on innocent party activists in villages across Bengal,? said state Congress general secretary Manas Bhuniya, minutes after calling on Sonia at Raj Bhavan this afternoon.

 State party leaders, including Union ministers Pranab Mukherjee and Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, party MPs and MLAs called on Sonia.

 The state leaders urged the Congress president to address rallies in the districts to motivate party workers. ?Soniaji said she would fix the schedule after consulting Salman Khursheed (the Congress general secretary in charge of Bengal affairs),? said a party leader.

 The Congress president urged state leaders to sink differences among themselves to strengthen the organisation across Bengal and fight the communists tooth and nail. 

 While Sonia was meeting the state leaders, Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee held a rally at Mayo Road near the Gandhi statue. She also led a procession from there to Esplanade to protest against the hike in fuel prices.

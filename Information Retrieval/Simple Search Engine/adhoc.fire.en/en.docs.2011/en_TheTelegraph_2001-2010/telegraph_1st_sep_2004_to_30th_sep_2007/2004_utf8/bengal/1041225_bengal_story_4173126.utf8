 Drunken brawl at Pous Mela

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Santiniketan, Dec. 24: The shadow of an unpleasant episode hung over Pous Mela after some drunk youths harassed sleeping bauls late last night and turned their anger on an official who protested by fracturing his right wrist. 

 The three-day mela began here yesterday. 

 Krishna Gopal Garai, the assistant public relations officer of Visva-Bharati University who is also the officer in charge of functions and festival (including the mela), said he was returning home around 11.45 pm when he noticed the youths near the Binodan Mancha, where the singers perform every evening. 

 ?I found some drunk youths disturbing the sleeping baul singers by prodding them with their feet,? he said. 

 When Garai asked them to leave, they showered abuses. ?Some of them dragged me behind the stage, beat me up and fled,? he added. 

 Garai said he shouted for help, but no policeman came. A passing friend came to his rescue. A complaint was lodged with the police later.

 Bolpur circle inspector S.K. Mitra said raids are on but no arrests had been made till this evening. 

 Birbhum superintendent of police Akhil Roy has ordered an inquiry into why no policeman was available at the time of the incident though over 200 personnel have been deployed to ensure security at the mela.

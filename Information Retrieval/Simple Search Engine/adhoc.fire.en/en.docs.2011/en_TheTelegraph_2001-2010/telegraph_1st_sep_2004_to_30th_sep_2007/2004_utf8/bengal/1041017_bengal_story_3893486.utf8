 Morning walk under watch

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 16: In the wake of incidents in which morning walkers became soft targets, police have decided to step up vigil in and around parks in the city where people go for every morning strolls.

 The immediate spur for the move to protect morning walkers was Wednesday?s abduction of a businessman, S. Rajgharia, from in front of Victoria Memorial. He was walking along Casurina Avenue around 4.30 am when a gang of six armed men swooped on him. 

 Rajgharia returned home in the evening after his family paid a ransom of Rs 2 lakh. But sleuths netted one of the gang members yesterday.

 Peeyush Pandey, the detective department deputy commissioner, said: ?The police stations have been asked to keep a close watch on the parks. The moment vehicles or people are seen moving suspiciously, their identities will be checked.?

 In 1999, Exide chief S.B. Ganguly was kidnapped while walking towards the Alipore Horticultural Gardens. Immediately afterwards, vigil was beefed up around parks, but over the years it became lax.

 The police said the abductors of Pretoria Street resident Rajgharia had demanded Rs 50 lakh, but scaled it down to 2 lakh. The money was handed near the Taratala crossing.

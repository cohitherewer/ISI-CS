 Bank robbery, minus guns 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Dec. 4: Beware, confidence tricksters are striking at banks. Pretending to be bank employees, they approach clients and offer to help, whether to count cash or solve any problem. If they are trusted, they disappear with the money. 

 ?Looking at them, it is difficult to believe they are conmen,? said an officer of the detective department. A couple of incidents has woken up the sleuths. 

 ?We will first speak to the bank authorities. It is yet to be decided how we will keep an eye on those entering and leaving banks,? said the officer.

 Police said insider involvement cannot be ruled out. They believe gangs of three to six members enter a bank posing as customers and usually target women or the elderly. The police, however, ruled out the possibility of posting policemen at every bank. 

 In Salt Lake, Suresh Kheria had walked into his bank to withdraw Rs 1.25 lakh for his son?s marriage. He kept Rs 25,000 in his pocket and asked the teller to replace the remaining Rs 1 lakh to notes of higher denomination. He was asked to wait for an agent of the bank who would solve his problem, said the police.

 Soon, a man approached Kheria, identifying himself as an agent with the bank?s housing loan division. Kheria gave him the money and he took it inside. Kheria waited for more than two hours, but the man did not turn up. 

 Police have detained the man working at the teller counter, as there seems to have been a link between the gang and the teller. 

 A few months ago, an aged woman withdrew Rs 50,000 from the Gariahat branch of a nationalised bank. Soon, a person approached her. Identifying himself as a bank employee, he said he would help her count the five bundles. She allowed the man to count the cash. 

 ?Another person engrossed her in conversation so that she was unable to keep an eye on the man counting the notes. The woman raised a hue and cry when she realised her money was missing. Amidst the confusion, the second person disappeared,? said an official of Gariahat police station.

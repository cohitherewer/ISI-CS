 Tourist terror tag slapped on jawans 

 - Charge of harassment on Nepal border

 ANURADHA SHARMA LAKHOTIA IN SILIGURI

 Nov. 15: Tour operators today accused the Sashastra Suraksha Bal of ruining the already battered reputation of Sandakphu by terrorising trekkers and tour operators.

 Jawans posted on the India-Nepal border, through which the trek route passes, allegedly manhandled a tour operator and threatened to ?hack to pieces? the British bird-watchers he was escorting.

 The Sandakphu route, once a favourite with trekkers, has seen a dip in popularity with the rise in Maoist activities across the border.

 G.M. Singh, the president of Gurudongma Tours amp; Treks, said a chain of incidents began yesterday when Peter Lobo and Sudesh Pradhan were on their way to Gairibas along with the Britons. 

 ?They were accosted by an SSB jawan who forced his luggage into their Landrover and asked for a lift in a very rude manner. He was politely refused. The enraged jawan then threatened Lobo with dire consequences if he proceeded to Sandakphu,? Singh said.

 The matter ended there, or so Lobo thought as he continued with his team towards Sandakphu.

 ?Lobo was today intercepted by some jawans while on his way to Sandakphu and forced to get off the jeep. He was manhandled and threatened with loss of life after being branded a terrorist. They also snatched his binoculars. All this happened in front of the Britons. The jawans even threatened to cut the foreigners to pieces,? Singh said. 

 ?I have reported the incident to the SSB office at Rimbik. The inspector-in-charge apologised and promised to investigate,? he added.

 Shaken by the incident, the foreigners called off the trip.

 ?The tourists were initially planning to stay at Sandakphu for two days, but they have cancelled their programme and will reach Darjeeling tomorrow. They are very scared and said they would never like to return to a land where armed forces scare tourists like this,? Lobo said.

 This is not the first time that such allegations have been levelled against the SSB. In June last year, SSB personnel at Meghma, en route to Sandakphu, shot at Kiran Rai, a 20-year-old nature guide of Singalila National Park.

 Residents had called a strike to protest against the SSB?s high-handedness.

 Katherine Lobo, the cultural tour operator for Gurudongma Tours amp; Treks, said: ?The harassment by the SSB is making it difficult to carry out tourism in the area. They just harass the common people in the name of security. They are supposed to guard the border and make us feel secure, not harass and pose more problems for us.?

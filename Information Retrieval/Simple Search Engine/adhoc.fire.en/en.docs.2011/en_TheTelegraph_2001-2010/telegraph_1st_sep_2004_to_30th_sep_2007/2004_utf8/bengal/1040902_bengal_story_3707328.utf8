 Arrests expose CPM divide 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Chinsurah, Sept. 1: The arrest of two CPM leaders in connection with a murder four years ago seems to have created a rift in the partys Hooghly district unit. 

 The divide came into the open today when supporters owing allegiance to the CPMs Hooghly MP, Rupchand Pal, protested against the arrest of Nikhil Pandey, the pradhan of the Kodalia-II gram panchayat, and Benoy Chatterjee, the local secretary of the partys youth wing, the DYFI. On the other hand, Anil Basu, the MP from Arambagh, felt police had done their duty and the law should take its own course. 

 Yesterday, all hell broke loose on G.T. Road when CPM supporters clashed with the police and blocked the road for hours, forcing the police to open fire in the air. 

 We, partymen, should not interfere with the job of policemen, said Basu, who returned from Delhi today. I feel party supporters should not have blocked the G.T. Road in protest against the arrests. Did they take permission from the leadership before blocking the road? he said. 

 Pal believes the police action was unfair. He, with the wives of the two arrested leaders in tow, marched to district magistrate Roshni Sen this morning and submitted a memorandum demanding action against the policemen.

 Police indiscriminately lathicharged innocent people and burst teargas shells on them for peacefully squatting on the road in protest against the arrest. They (police) should have settled the issue through a discussion with the agitators, Pal said, minutes after meeting Sen. 

 He said he would complain to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. I was told policemen had also beaten up some women protesters yesterday, he added. 

 Sunil Sarkar, a member of the CPM Hooghly district secretariat and party spokesman, echoed Basu. Police have done their job and we should not interfere with it, he said.

 Study calls for bus fleet overhaul 

 SIMI KAMBOJ

 Calcutta, Dec. 19: As the government gets ready to undertake a UK-sponsored restructuring of five state transport undertakings, a study on their financial health and workforce has revealed some startling facts. 

 The report says about 40 per cent of the fleet is unfit for roads. Some of the transport corporations run only half their buses and Calcutta Tramways Company uses 45 per cent of its fleet of trams. 

 On an average, the buses are eight years old, says the report by a chartered accountant firm, which recommends immediate replacement of the old and unfit ones. 

 The transport department had ordered the study to determine the health of the Calcutta State Transport Corporation (CSTC), the North Bengal State Transport Corporation (NBSTC), the South Bengal State Transport Corporation (SBSTC), the West Bengal Surface Transport Corporation (WBSTC) and the Calcutta Tramways Company (CTC). 

 All the five are running at a loss. Last year, CSTC lost Rs 105.81 crore, NBSTC Rs 71.12 crore, SBSTC Rs 45.39 crore, WBSTC Rs 7.22 crore and CTC Rs 9.74 crore on buses and Rs 77.85 crore on trams. 

 Each corporation loses about Rs 7 for every person who boards a bus, the report says. 

 Expenses of each corporation exceed earnings manifold. CSTC?s operating expenses are about 200 per cent more than its earnings. In CTC?s case, it is 615 per cent. 

 The transport department is now looking for a consultant to study ways to make the units self-sufficient. Nine companies had responded to advertisements and four have been short-listed, said an official. 

 The government gave to the transport companies a subsidy of Rs 228 crore out of its cash-strapped kitty this year. Most of the money went to pay salaries to employees.

 Eco-park with fun rides in industry hub

 Waiting for a gateway?

Midnapore, Oct. 24: Haldia, the new industry destination, is now set to get a location of tourist interest within an arm?s length. 

 A 7-km stretch along the Haldi river up to the Coast Guard jetty, about 175 km from Calcutta, will be developed into an eco-tourism zone.

 For residents of Haldia and visitors, the nearest getaway now is Geonkhali, 15 km away. However, at the confluence of the Damodar, the Roopnarayan and the Hooghly, Geonkhali is more of a picnic spot. 

 The 7-km casuarina forest that will come up along the Haldi will offer a much better landscape, feel the Haldia civic authorities, who have planned the Rs 2.5-crore project.

 ?We are confident that the stretch will attract Haldia Petro, Mitsubishi and dock employees and their guests. Tourists from Calcutta will also take an interest. Once the Kukrahati bridge connecting South 24-Parganas is completed, it will be much easier for people from Calcutta to come to Haldia,? said Tamalika Seth, the municipality chairperson.

 The proposed tourist spot will house an eco-park at Balughta, where there is a casuarina forest. Designed over 100 acres, the park will house cottages, a children?s toy park, restaurants, rides and games. 

 Officials said the irrigation department was asked to prepare a report on the Haldi, based on which the municipal engineering department designed the park. ?Work will start by the year-end,? said Seth.

 The chairman of the Haldia Development Authority and local MP, Lakshman Seth, said the Golden Coast Road, which will be built at a cost of Rs 6.5 crore, will run through the township and the tourist zone along the Haldi. ?Tourists will get the feel of a marine drive,? he added.

 A proposal has also been sent to Delhi for setting up a marine museum at the confluence of the Haldi and the Hooghly near the dock. 

 A development authority official said over 3 lakh people visit Haldia every year. ?They come for business and stay for a few days. A tourist attraction will help them relax and the civic authorities, too, can earn some revenue.?

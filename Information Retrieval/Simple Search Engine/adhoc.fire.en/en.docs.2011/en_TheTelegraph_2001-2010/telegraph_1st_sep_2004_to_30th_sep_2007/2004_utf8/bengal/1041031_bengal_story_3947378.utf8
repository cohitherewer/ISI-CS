Calcutta, Oct. 30: Prized catch hatkata 

Dilip firmly in their grip, literally, police scoured several parts of North 

24-Parganas to ?collect important clues? in cases his gang was involved in. 

 The team went to Nayapatti in Salt Lake, where they made Dilip recount the events of the attack during a soiree on June 27 in which two persons were killed, and several other hideouts in Lake Town and Barasat. 

 ?The raids today will help us collect important clues about others involved in the Nayapatti case and get information on arms used and where these can be found,? an official associated with the investigation said. 

 Parveen Kumar, the superintendent of North 24-Parganas, said a ?few more arrests are expected on the basis of the information revealed by Dilip?. 

 Police interrogated Dilip from last evening till after midnight. After the rounds of the hideouts, he was produced in the Barrackpore sub-divisional judicial magistrate court?s amid tight security. 

 The courthouse courtyard was brimming with gawkers and Congress activists who shouted slogans demanding a probe into his alleged links with transport minister Subhas Chakraborty. 

 Sub-divisional judicial magistrate A.M. Nandy remanded Dilip in police custody for 11 days. He will be produced in court on November 10. 

 Youth Congress activists also held demonstrations in several parts of the city today. They burnt effigies of Chakraborty in Burrabazar and Esplanade, where police charged with batons to disperse the demonstrators. 

 CPM MP from Dum Dum Amitava Nandy today came out in support of Chakraborty. ?Some people are just being nasty and associating Subhasda?s name with Dilip. I don?t see why his name is being mentioned.? 

 Footballer Sasthi Duley?s brother Uday, who was detained for interrogation, was released today. ?I value my life and cannot say anything. My family doesn?t know anything about Dilip. Only I and Sasthi know about him. I?ve told police whatever I had to and police asked me not to open my mouth,? he said. 

 Dilip was arrested from the Duley residence in Haripal, Hooghly. 

 In another development, Baishakhi, Dilip?s wife, alleged that police beat her up ?on the pretext of interrogation? to learn the whereabouts of her husband over the past few months. 

 ?I was severely beaten up by the police and had to be admitted to a nursing home for five days. I have all the necessary documents and I am going to move the state human rights commission,? an angry and tearful Baishakhi said.

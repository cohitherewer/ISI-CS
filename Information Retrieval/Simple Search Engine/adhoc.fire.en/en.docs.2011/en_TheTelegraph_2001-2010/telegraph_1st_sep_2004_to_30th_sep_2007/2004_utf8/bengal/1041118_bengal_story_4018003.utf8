 Not another Bhopal: A plant in Haldia 

 Calcutta, Nov. 17: Haldia, the industrial capital of the state, may soon have a new slogan ? not just a place to invest in, but a safe place to invest in. 

 Possibilities of another Bhopal happening in the township, with about 15 plants dealing with hazardous substances, could be next to none once the country?s first ?foolproof environmental risk information system? is put in place within two years. That is if a joint effort of the Indian Chamber of Commerce (ICC) and the Haldia Development Authority bears fruit. 

 The project, Environmental Risk Reporting and Information System, recently awarded to the Calcutta-based chamber by the European Union, will try to ?disseminate industry environmental risk-related information to the public and provide vital assistance to responders to acquire swift control of a contingency situation, should it so arise?. 

 Nazeeb Arif, ICC secretary general, put things in perspective during the inaugural project meeting at Haldia yesterday. 

 ?Nobody has forgotten the Bhopal disaster and hence, the project is meant for the industrial townships of Haldia and Durgapur? It will also help the business in the long run and contribute to the region?s overall image as now all major companies throughout the world want to work in a risk-free environment,? he said. 

 Lakshman Seth, chairman of the Haldia Development Authority, which would act as the nodal agency, hailed the Rs 2.5-crore project as a ?Diwali bonanza? and felt ?the system will bring more investments to Haldia?.

 During the presentation attended by Haldia Petrochemicals, Indian Oil and Mitsubishi representatives, the four specific objectives of the project were unveiled:

 Establish the risk reporting system under which hazardous units are expected to volunteer information, especially about storage

 Set up the risk information system with the help of geographical information system technology and prepare a virtual library of information, to be made available in the public domain 

 Train personnel who would be responsible for risk preparedness and responding to an emergency

 Build a unified institutional framework with a risk management centre at ICC to mitigate risks in select industrial townships.

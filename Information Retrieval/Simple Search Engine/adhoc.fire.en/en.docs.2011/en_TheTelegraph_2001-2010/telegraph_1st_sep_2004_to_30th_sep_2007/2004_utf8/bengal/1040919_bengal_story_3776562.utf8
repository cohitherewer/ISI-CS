 Safe puja review 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Sept. 18: Calcutta police and other civic agencies today held a meeting with the organisers of some of the big ticket Durga pujas at Lalbazar, the city police headquarters, to thrash out concerns shared by both sides for holding a peaceful and incident-free festival. 

 While the police promised to prevent the nuisance of ragpickers stripping the decoration off the idols before they were immersed, commissioner Sujoy Chakrabarty requested the organisers to ensure drinking water was made available for thirsty pandal-hoppers. 

 The corporation promised all major roads would be repaired in time. The fire department called for bigger exits and all facilities like fire extinguishers, water and sand to prevent fires ? for the third year in a row. The fire brigade also requested the organisers to send two volunteers for training at its facilities on Free School Street or Central Avenue.

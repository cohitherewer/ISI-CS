 Govt to go by SC order on quota plots

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Nov. 23: The state government will abide by the Supreme Court?s order on cancellation of allotment of a Salt Lake plot to then Justice Bhagabati Prosad Banerjee under then chief minister Jyoti Basu?s quota.

 The decision was taken at a meeting held today in urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya?s office at Writers? Buildings. Those present were unanimous that the government would not move a petition before the apex court asking for a revision of the order.

 ?We are sending the file with our observations vis-?-vis the apex court?s order to the chief secretary for necessary action,? Bhattacharya said after the meeting.

 Basu said the government was left with no option but to go by the apex court?s order. 

 ?The court?s order may not be favourable for us, but that does not matter. We will have to carry it out in toto,? Basu said, adding that he had spoken to former advocate-general Naranarayan Gooptu, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and senior party leaders on the issue.

 Earlier, state advocate-general Balai Ray said a revision petition to the apex court would not yield any result. ?It involves a lot of hazards.?

 However, a section of the CPM is in favour of a revision petition as the apex court had pointed out ?an unholy nexus between the passing of the judicial order and the granting order of allotments?. 

 Banerjee had issued an order empowering Basu to allot plots in Salt Lake from his quota after having disallowed it.

 Calcutta, Oct. 9: With 10 days to the Pujas, residents of Jorabagan, Shyampukur and Entally seemed to prefer shopping to queuing for casting their votes, resulting in an unprecedented poor turnout for the three Assembly byelections. 

 The seats fell vacant after the three Left Front MLAs ? Sudhangsu Sil (CPM), Subrata Basu (Forward Bloc) and Mohammed Selim (CPM) ? were elected to the Lok Sabha. 

 The votes will be counted on October 16 at the Netaji Indoor Stadium. 

 District electoral officer D.K. Chakraborty said at Writers? Buildings polling was free and fair with an average turnout of 55 to 60 per cent. Normally, the figure stands at around 75 per cent.

 Jorabagan recorded the lowest turnout of 50 per cent. In the 2001 elections, Sil won after 70 per cent polling. 

 Chakraborty said the Election Commission did not receive any major complaint or demand of repoll till this evening. Over 170 people were arrested. 

 Unlike in previous polls, no long queues were to be seen in front of booths in the Jorabagan-Shyampukur areas, dominated by the trader community. 

 ?As this is a wholesale market area, all traders kept their shops open to cash in on the festive season. Today being Saturday, many voters also went for puja shopping instead of going to cast their ballots. As a result, voter turnout at Jorabagan constituency was very poor and did not cross 50 per cent,?? said Sil. 

 In Shyampukur, the polling percentage was 55 per cent and in Entally, 60. 

 Deputy commissioner of police (central) Rajeev Kumar claimed the polls were peaceful barring some stray incidents, but the Opposition Congress and Trinamul Congress complained of rigging and booth jamming by the CPM. 

 ?In Bengal, elections have become a farce these days. The ruling CPM captured almost all the booths by utilising money and muscle power. The police have become a silent spectator,? alleged Trinamul?s Pankaj Banerjee. 

 State Congress working president Pradip Bhattacharya alleged that thousands of voters in Jorabagan and Shyampukur could not cast their votes because of false voting. 

 CPM state secretary Anil Biswas dismissed the allegations. ?The allegations raised are baseless. They are saying all this apprehending electoral reverses,? he said.

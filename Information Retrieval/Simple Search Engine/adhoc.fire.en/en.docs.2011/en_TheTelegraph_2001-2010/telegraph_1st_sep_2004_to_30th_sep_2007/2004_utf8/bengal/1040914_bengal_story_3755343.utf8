 Boy kills mother amp; surrenders 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Behrampore, Sept. 13: Angered by her affairs and infidelity, Ashique Hossain, 18, stabbed his mother Ruksana Begum to death, bathed, changed and then turned up at the local police station to confess.

 The resident of Gorabazar in Murshidabad district?s Behrampore town, about 200 km from Calcutta, had repeatedly asked his mother, who owned a beauty parlour and gymnasium, to change her ways, but to no avail.

 After killing his mother this afternoon with a knife he had bought a week earlier and sharpened at home, Ashique, a Class XII student, turned up at the police station. ?This is the key to my house. I have just murdered my mother,? he told the officer on duty.

 Police, who have arrested Ashique, said Ruksana, 37, had deserted her husband, a central government employee at Farakka, and eloped with another man, taking her only son, then one-and-a-half years old, with her. 

 After being left in the lurch by him, she apparently slipped into ?a world of crime and sleaze?.

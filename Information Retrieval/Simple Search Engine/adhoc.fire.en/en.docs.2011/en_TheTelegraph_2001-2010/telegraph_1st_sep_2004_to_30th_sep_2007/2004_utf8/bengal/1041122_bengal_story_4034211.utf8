 A correction

 A picture of Balai Ray, the advocate-general, was published inadvertently on Page 7 in yesterday?s edition with the report, ?Request timing defence on plot?. The caption below mistakenly identified him as Justice (Bhagabati Prosad) Banerjee. We regret the error and apologise to the advocate-general.

 Calcutta, Sept. 18: Former students and teachers of a south Calcutta school have come out in support of a geography teacher blamed by a student for her death in her suicide note. 

 Priyanka Das, a Class XI student, jumped in front of a train at Bagha Jatin on Wednesday evening after school. She left a note at home holding her geography teacher responsible for her death. 

 Priyanka?s parents have decided not to proceed against the teacher, who is credited with an unblemished record. They had filed a missing diary with Jadavpur police station. 

 ?We have decided not to lodge a complaint with the police against the geography teacher. We might just ask her what happened between the two of them,? said Priyanka?s mother Sipra. 

 ?She was very sentimental and would get emotional at the slightest pretext. But we don?t know what prompted her to take such an extreme step. Why did my daughter take such a drastic step will remain a mystery and haunt us,? said father Pradip, breaking down. 

 At the school, students ? past and present ? and teachers put up posters reposing faith in the geography teacher. ?Our teacher is completely innocent. She would not hurt a fly, how can she instigate somebody to commit suicide?? said one student. Some of the posters expressed sympathy for Priyanka. 

 From early this morning, the students and teachers gathered in front of the school, apprehending police action against the teacher. 

 ?We can?t believe that our geography teacher is the cause of the suicide. She used to inspire us and it is because of her that we decided to take up the subject,? said Debarupa Majumdar and Urmimala Sen, who have just completed their graduation from a city college with honours in geography. 

 A few of Priyanka?s classmates were also present, expressing faith in the teacher.

 Bandana Dasgupta, secretary of the school managing committee, recalled how the geography teacher had become popular with the students shortly after taking charge. ?I appointed her 10 years back and she is as modest and polite as she was then,? she said.

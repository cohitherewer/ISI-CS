 RKM meet

 Calcutta, Dec. 20: Swami Ranganathananda, the president of Ramakrishna Math and Mission, said last evening it is most important to imbibe the ideals of Swami Vivekananda in today?s world of violence and corruption.

 At the mission?s 95th annual general meeting, he said Swami Vivekananda had emphasised on man-making, nation and character building. ?That is what we need.?

 The governing body?s report for 2003-2004 says key developments include new centres at Muzaffarpur and Chhapra in Bihar, the inauguration of an eye ward at the Sevashrama in Vrindavan and a pathological lab in Bankura. The Vivekananda polyclinic in Lucknow was also upgraded.

 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, Oct. 5: Dhananjoy Singh, who is allegedly linked with the murder of Satyendra Dubey, the IIT alumnus shot while working on a national highway project in Bihar, was arrested in Howrah late tonight.

 Police said officials from Jharkhand, where Singh is based, will be here tomorrow to take charge of him. There are at least 12 murder and extortion charges against the man now in the net. 

 Calcutta: The government is planning to evict encroachers in Calcutta and Howrah from land under the Thika Tenancy (Acquisition and Regulation) Act, 2001. The rules under the act were cleared by the cabinet today. Most of the encroached land has been turned into slums or cowsheds, the land and land reforms minister said. 

 Midnapore: Tension ran high at Midnapore Medical College and Hospital following the death of four-month-old Subhajit. The child from Pingla, West Midnapore, was admitted with respiratory problems last Friday. Subhajit?s father, Prabir De, alleged that when his condition deteriorated, no doctor came to see him. The hospital superintendent said a probe has been ordered.

 Calcutta: After a three-month break, Mamata Banerjee will address a rally on Wednesday. The meeting in support of her party nominee for the Jorabagan Assembly seat, where a bypoll is due on Saturday, follows the rally in West Midnapore during which the dais collapsed with her. In the fall, Mamata fractured two of her left ribs.

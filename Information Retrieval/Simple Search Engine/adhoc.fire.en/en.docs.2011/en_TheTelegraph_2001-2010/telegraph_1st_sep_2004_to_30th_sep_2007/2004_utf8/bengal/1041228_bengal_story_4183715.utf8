 Blood bank anaemic 

 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE 

 Barasat, Dec. 27: The blood bank at Barasat District Hospital, which caters to about 20 lakh people in North 24-Parganas, is open for only five hours a day.

 The referral hospital for Bongaon and Basirhat subdivisions does not have enough staff to keep the blood bank open for a longer period, said hospital superintendent B.K. Saha. ?We can operate the bank only for five hours a day from 11 am in the absence of adequate manpower,? he said.

 The blood bank is now being run with staff from the hospital?s pathology and medical investigation departments.

 K. Adhikary, the district?s chief medical officer of health, said: ?We, too, feel that steps should be taken to run the blood bank round-the-clock. But we need manpower and better infrastructure. I have informed my superiors.?

 A hospital employee said three eight-hour shifts have to be run everyday to keep the blood bank open 24 hours. ?At present, we have only five persons to man the blood bank.?

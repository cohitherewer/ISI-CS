 Flood survivors fight back

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 The great deluge: 1978

 Banguria, Dec. 13: The floods that ravaged Bengal in 1978 left this Nadia village in ruins. About 60 families were pushed to the brink of starvation in its aftermath.

 Twenty-six years on, they earn between Rs 50,000 and a lakh every year.

 The government, which had introduced the residents of Banguria village in Nakashipara, about 130 km from Calcutta, to sericulture, now wants to project it as a model for silk farmers across the state.

 Impressed by the villagers? performance, the Council for Advancement of People?s Agricultural and Rural Technology (Capart), a central agency, has offered grants to upgrade the farming.

 Its director L.V. Saptarshi visited Banguria yesterday. He said the state government has asked Capart to take stock of sericulture in Bengal and how Banguria?s success can be replicated elsewhere. 

 Saptarshi was the Nadia district magistrate 24 years ago, when the farmers took up sericulture as an alternative. 

 ?We went to Banguria following a request from the Bengal government. What we found was a real success story. The farmers involved in sericulture have really done a good job,? said Saptarshi. 

 The revolution in Banguria was silent and the neighbouring villages still cannot fathom its scale.

 In 1980, two years after the farmers faced the devastation, the soil at Banguria was still unfit for farming. With the help of the state sericulture department, the district administration led by Saptarshi then initiated the villagers to it. The government leased out about 300 bighas to the villagers and days of hard work with renewed vigour began. 

 With their limited resources, the villagers developed the cocoon, produced the beads in their huts and started selling the beads to the government as well as in the market. On an average, each family at Banguria now employs about 10 people from nearby villages.

 ?We had lost everything in the floods. Then Saptarshibabu helped us. Today, I earn about Rs 60,000 a year and invest about Rs 7,000 back into the business,? said one of the farmers, Mohan Ghosh.

 Saptarshi said: ?The products would have been better if there was electricity and more funds. But I still wonder at their level of performance.?

 At a meeting with Nadia district magistrate Rajesh Pandey, he sought a proposal for a project that Capart could fund.

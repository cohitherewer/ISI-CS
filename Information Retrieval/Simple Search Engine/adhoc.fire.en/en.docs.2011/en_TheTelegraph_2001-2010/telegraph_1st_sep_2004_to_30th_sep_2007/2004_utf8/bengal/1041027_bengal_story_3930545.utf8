 Funds for school homebound 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

Midnapore, Oct. 26: The headmistress of a secondary 

school in East Midnapore has been arrested for allegedly siphoning development 

funds to build her own house.

 Gouri Kala, the head of Shashibhushan Kanya Vidyapeeth, was picked up last night from her home at Padmapukuria in Marichda, about 120 km from Calcutta.

 Officials said former Trinamul Congress MP from Contai Nitish Sengupta had provided Rs 1.25 lakh from his quota of local area development funds for the extension of the school building.

 The money was deposited in a local bank through the block development officer of Contai-III, Jyotirmoy Tanti, in July this year.

 The headmistress and a student?s guardian, Paresh Chandra Mistri, were joint signatories to the account opened in the school?s name. 

 Mistri had approached the Contai subdivisional officer with the allegation that Kala made him sign several withdrawal slips. 

 An officer of the local police station said: ?Two of these slips were used to take out Rs 1.05 lakh from the bank early this month. The headmistress returned Rs 5,000 to the account.? 

 Mistri alleged that the money for the school building was being used to construct Kala?s house. 

 She apparently tried to evade an inquiry by the block development officer and the chief of the local panchayat samiti, Santosh Maiti.

 The police officer said: ?On October 16, the headmistress confessed to the BDO that she had spent the money for personal reasons and urged him not to take any action against her. She also pleaded with him for time and promised to return the money she took. The next morning, the BDO lodged an FIR.?

 But Kala could not be arrested immediately as she was ?missing?. Last night, police said, she was nabbed following a tip-off.

 Kala had been working in the school for the past 28 years, said Contai subdivisional officer Debashish Bej.

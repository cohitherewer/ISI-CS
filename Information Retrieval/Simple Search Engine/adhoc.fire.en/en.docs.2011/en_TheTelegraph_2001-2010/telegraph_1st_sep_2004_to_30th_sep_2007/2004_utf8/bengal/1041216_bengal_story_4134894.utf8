 Sons of soil plan diamond parks 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Dec. 15: Jewellery artisans who had left Bengal in search of greener pastures are now trying to set up shop in their ?homeland?. 

 About 100 members of the Bengali Association of Mumbai?s Zaveri Bazaar today approached commerce and industry minister Nirupam Sen with proposals for two diamond jewellery complexes in Calcutta. 

 The first proposal, tabled by the bigger players, is for a complex within the Manikanchan gems and jewellery park in Salt Lake. It will primarily target markets overseas. 

 The smaller entrepreneurs eyeing the domestic market have sought land on the outskirts of the city. 

 ?Having immigrated from Bengal decades ago, we want to start business here again. We believe Calcutta will soon become the gateway to Southeast Asia. The bigger players among us are targeting an annual export of Rs 18,000 crore once operations are on in full swing,? said association president Jagannath Halder this evening. The group plans to start about 100 units at Manikanchan in the first phase. 

 The diamond jewellery segment has grown by 25 per cent in Bengal over the past year.

 Halder said most of his team members, who left Bengal in search of work as artisans, now own jewellery units. ?Over three lakh jewellery artisans in Mumbai have immigrated from Bengal, especially from areas like Howrah?s Domjur and Chanditala and Dankuni in Hooghly,? he said. 

 ?The government will act as a facilitator and help them find land. The jewellers have been asked to submit a formal proposal within a month,? an official said.

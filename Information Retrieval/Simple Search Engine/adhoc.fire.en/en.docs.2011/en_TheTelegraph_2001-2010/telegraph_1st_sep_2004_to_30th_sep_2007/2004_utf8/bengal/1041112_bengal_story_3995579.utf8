 Fatal prank

 Krishnagar, Nov. 11: Tumpa Swarnakar, 11, who got a thrashing from her mother for scaring her in the guise of the Goddess on the eve of Kali puja, hanged herself last night.

 In her mother?s red sari, her face painted black and lips red, the Class V student looked scary when she tapped her mother?s shoulder from behind at their Nakashipara home, about 130 km from Calcutta. 

 Police said Tumpa?s brother Pintu helped her dress up and saw their mother shriek in fear. Unable to take the joke, mother Sunita beat up Tumpa and she went weeping into her room. She hanged herself later with the same red sari.

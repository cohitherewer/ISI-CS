 BE College block to Burdwan plan

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Burdwan, Dec. 18: The Burdwan Development Authority?s master-plan to develop Burdwan town and its adjoining areas has suffered a setback with the Bengal University of Engineering and Science in Shibpur, Howrah, failing to submit it.

 Industry minister Nirupam Sen, who is also the chairman of the development authority, had taken a personal initiative to garner funds from Unicef for developing the area.

 The responsibility of drawing up the master plan ? Perspective Plan 2025 ? had been given to the university (formerly BE College) two years ago and the varsity had agreed to submit it within three months.

 Annoyed over the delay, the development authority has now approached the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur for drawing up the plan.

 ?The BE College authorities had promised us they would draw up the master-plan. We had carried out several surveys and studies to help them, but they did not keep their promise. So, all our plans got delayed,? said the minister.

 The vice-chancellor of the university, Amal Jyoti Sengupta, declined to comment. ?This is a very sensitive issue for us. We have a relation with the state government and I don?t want to strain the relation,? he said.

 The industry minister said the authority decided to draw up a perspective plan for the development of Burdwan town and its adjoining areas in November 2002.

 ?Unicef agreed to help us with funds to prepare the report,? he said.

 Following the recommendations from the university, the development authority organised several seminars in Burdwan town where opinions were sought from experts, people?s representatives and prominent citizens.

 The executive engineer of the authority, Biswajit Choudhury, visited IIT Kharagpur this month ? after the Shibpur university?s inordinate delay ? and met B.K. Sengupta, the head of the department of architecture and regional planning department.

 ?We are giving the responsibility of drawing up the perspective plan to Kharagpur IIT. They have primarily agreed to complete the report within three months. We expect to draw up an agreement on this score by the end of this month,? said Choudhury.

 Burdwan is the second urban centre in the state around which the government wants to hasten development. The development authority has about 158 square km under its jurisdiction.

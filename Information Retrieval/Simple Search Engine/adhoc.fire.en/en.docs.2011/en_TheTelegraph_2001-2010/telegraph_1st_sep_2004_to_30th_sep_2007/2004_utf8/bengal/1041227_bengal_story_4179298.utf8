 Pension for tribals over 60

 RANJAN LAHIRY

 Burdwan, Dec. 26: The government has decided to pay a monthly pension of Rs 500 to tribals past 60 and living below the poverty line. 

 In the first phase, the scheme will be launched in 50 blocks of Burdwan, Birbhum, Bankura, Purulia and West Midnapore that have been identified by the Centre for its Integrated Tribal Development Project. If it is a success, the government will bring more areas under it.

 A study to identify tribals over 60 has begun in Burdwan and will be carried out in the other districts subsequently. 

 ?We want to start paying the pension from this financial year. We have asked the district magistrates to carry out a survey to identify tribal people over 60 years of age,? said Bilasibala Sahis, the minister of state for backward classes welfare.

 Officials of her department said according to a rough estimate, there are about five lakh tribals in the area covered by the central project. Of them, over 50,000 are over 60. ?But we need an exact headcount because local bank accounts will have to be opened from where they will draw the pension,? an official said.

 He added that a substitute plan to disburse the pension from block offices is also being contemplated. 

 Burdwan district magistrate Subrata Gupta said the SC/ST welfare committee is conducting the mouja-wise survey. ?There are 400 tribal elders in the area selected for the central project,? he added.

 Starvation and deaths have been reported from several pockets selected under the scheme. Many of the poverty-stricken areas are also infested by Naxalites. An official said: ?The rebels try to earn the sympathy of the poor tribals citing government apathy and lack of development.? 

 Gupta said: ?The old in the backward areas often find it difficult to buy medicines, even after being checked up in hospitals. If we can provide some money to them every month, they will be better off.?

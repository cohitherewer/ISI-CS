Calcutta, Oct. 12: All medical institutions across the state will have to pay an annual fee to the West Bengal University of Health Sciences to renew their affiliation.

 The move, officials said, is aimed at making the new university self-reliant.

 According to the government order, state-run institutions will have to pay Rs 50,000 every year to renew their affiliation. Private colleges will have to fork out Rs 1 lakh.

 The vice-chancellor of the university of health sciences, M.M. Chowdhury, has received a copy of the order asking him to charge the affiliation renewal fee from MBBS colleges from this year. He said: ?We have received the government order regarding the fee for allopathy colleges under our university. We are asking the institutions to pay as soon as possible.? 

 In the first phase, officials said, seven out of nine MBBS, three dental and three nursing colleges have been brought under the new system. 

 Calcutta Medical College, NRS, RG Kar, National Medical College and the MBBS institutions in Jalpaiguri, Bankura and Burdwan are in the first lot. A decision is yet to be taken on the newly set up undergraduate colleges at SSKM Hospital and Midnapore. 

 Homeopathy, ayurvedic and unani colleges will be covered under the system in the second phase, an official said. 

 At present, there are two private institutions that offer courses in medical science ? a nursing and a dental college. 

 Chowdhury said: ?We expect to earn about Rs 18 lakh a year when all the colleges start paying the fees.?

 A government official said the university?s income is expected to increase further when a number of pending proposals of private bodies to set up medical institutions get the clearance. 

 Before the university of health sciences was set up, the medical colleges did not have to pay any fees to the universities they were affiliated to.

 Officials of the health science university, which was set up three years ago, welcomed the decision to introduce the fees as it hardly has any other source of income and has to depend entirely on government grants, even for everyday expenses. 

 A university official said: ?We spend a considerable amount every year in conducting various post-graduate and undergraduate examinations. We can cover a part of the deficit once all the institutions start paying the fees.?

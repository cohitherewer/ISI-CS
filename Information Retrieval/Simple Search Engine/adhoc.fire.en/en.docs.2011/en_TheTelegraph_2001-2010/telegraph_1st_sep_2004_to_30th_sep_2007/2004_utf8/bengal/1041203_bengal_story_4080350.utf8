 Wheel jammer to bandh foiler

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 2: It changes colours fast. 

 Citu, the CPM?s labour arm, which brought city traffic to a standstill with its chakka jam programme yesterday, will play an opposite role tomorrow in a bid to ensure smooth vehicular movement during the Trinamul Congress-sponsored bandh.

 Sources said the Citu intends to utilise public transport workers, particularly bus and mini-bus drivers and conductors, to foil the bandh. Most of the unions of bus, mini-bus, truck and autorickshaw workers are controlled by the CPM?s labour arm. 

 Citu leaders associated with the transport workers? bodies held a series of discussions last night at the behest of transport minister Subhas Chakraborty to chalk out a strategy to maintain normal services on the bandh day. It was decided that the union?s supporters will bring out buses and mini-buses in the morning on their own with or without the consent of their owners. The drivers have been directed not to hand over the vehicles? keys to the owners tonight.

 Bus and mini-bus operators generally do not ply their vehicles on bandh days fearing damage by its supporters as insurance companies appear reluctant to pay compensation on such occasions. 

 ?If a bus-owner refuses to ply his vehicle, the workers will bring them out on the roads. We have asked our supporters to take control of the vehicles and, if necessary, arrange money to buy fuel. We intend to run as many buses as possible,?? said Subhas Mukherjee of the West Bengal Road Transport Workers? Federation, an apex body of transport workers? unions.

 Bus owners, too, did not appear opposed to the Citu gameplan. ?If they return them in good condition, we have no objection,? said Swarnakamal Saha, the president of the Bengal Bus Syndicate.

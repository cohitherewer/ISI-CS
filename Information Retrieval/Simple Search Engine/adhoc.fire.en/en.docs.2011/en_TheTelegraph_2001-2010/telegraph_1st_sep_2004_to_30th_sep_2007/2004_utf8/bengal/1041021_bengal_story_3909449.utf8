 CID books Sushmita 7 

 - Abduction with murder intent, conspiracy charges on friends 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Oct. 20: More than nine years after Jadavpur University student Sushmita Dhar disappeared during a vacation at Chandipur, the CID today submitted a chargesheet against seven persons arrested in connection with case. 

 ?The accused have been given a number of charges, from abduction with intent to murder to criminal conspiracy. We have enough evidence to prove them guilty,? said a senior CID official.

 Investigating officer Mahabrati Adhikary filed the chargesheet at Alipore police court. 

 On hearing the news, Sushmita?s sister, Arpita Pal, expressed confidence in the officers. ?I would like to thank all of them. But what exactly happened to my sister in Chandipur is still unknown. We don?t even know whether she is dead or alive. This is what we want to know,? she said. 

 The second-year MA student went missing in May 1995 while on a holiday at the seaside resort with her private tutor, Debanjan Das, and four classmates ? Rajiv Chowdhury, Suparna Banerjee, Soma Sengupta and Anindita Das. 

 Debanjan and Rajiv are now college teachers, while Suparna teaches in a prominent school in south Calcutta. Anindita is no longer alive. 

 The case, virtually closed following no breakthrough, was reopened by the CID after the intervention of a minister. 

 The three teachers have also been accused of causing disappearance of evidence and giving false information. 

 Sleuths first arrested Debanjan, Rajiv, Suparna and her father, Sachin, on learning he had engaged private detectives to crack the case in 1995 and later asked them to lay off after the recovery of Sushmita?s blood-stained night dress from the Chandipur hotel. 

 The two managers of the hotel, Rajesh Das and Asish Das, and a hotel boy, Purna Chandra Das, who served the group food and beverages, have also been held.

 Power and puja make friends

 OUR BUREAU

 Oct. 18: The scare of a power cut-plagued puja receded today with the National Thermal Power Corporation lighting up one of the two 200-mw units in Farakka shut down for lack of coal last Saturday.

 The power generator had said its coal stocks were depleting fast as villagers protesting against lack of flood relief in Jharkhand were holding up trains fetching coal from mines there. NTPC?s supply to the Bengal electricity board dropped sharply after the two units were shut down. Officials had said the situation could worsen if the larger units were also closed for want of coal.

 Viswarup, the general manager of the Farakka plant, today said the movement of wagons have resumed after negotiations with the protestors. The other closed unit is likely to restart generation tonight.

 Electricity board member M.K. Roy said if all the units at Farakka generate full-steam, there is no fear of power cuts during Durga puja. ?There was no shortfall this evening.? 

 Blast arrests

 Eight people were arrested today from villages in Lalgarh, West Midnapore, in connection with the October 14 explosions that killed six jawans. The government will deploy 4,000 additional police personnel in Naxalite-infested districts for the festival season.

 Kumargramduar (Alipurduar), Oct. 28: Two Kamtapur Liberation Organisation militants, wanted for murder and abduction, have been arrested in Jalpaiguri district.

 ?We arrested Parimal Basunia alias Pramod Das and Pahar Singh alias Batrish Das yesterday. Both were trained at Piping in Bhutan,? said Rahul Srivastav, the Alipurduar additional superintendent of police. ?We had information that Singh was hiding in Guwahati and that he had set up a control room to keep in touch with the Ulfa,? Srivastav said. The police also knew that Basunia was moving around in Gossaigaon, Kokrajhar, and Golokganj in Assam and Baxirhat and Toofanganj on the Assam-Bengal border. 

 Before Operation Flushout by the Royal Bhutan Army last December, Singh used to extort money and ration from Assam and Bengal and send them to the camps in Bhutan.

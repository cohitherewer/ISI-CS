 Appeal on jobless dole

 New Delhi, Nov. 15: A National Advisory Council delegation led by social activist Aruna Roy met CPI leaders today to plead with them to ask Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to accept the employment guarantee act in its present form.

 The Bengal chief minister had expressed reservations about the clause guaranteeing dole for those waiting for employment. The state, reeling under a crunch, will find it difficult to fulfil this obligation.

 ?The council wants us to ensure that all states accept the act,? CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan said. Congress president Sonia Gandhi, Bardhan said, is keen to get the act passed during the winter session of Parliament, beginning December 1. 

 There are various benchmarks for the quantum of dole ? from a fourth of the statutory minimum wage to the full minimum wage.

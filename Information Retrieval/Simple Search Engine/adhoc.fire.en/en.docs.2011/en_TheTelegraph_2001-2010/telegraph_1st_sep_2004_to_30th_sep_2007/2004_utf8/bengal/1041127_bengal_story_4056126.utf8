 Trinamul waits in bandh case

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Nov. 26: A day after Calcutta High Court issued fresh summons to Trinamul Congress leaders expecting them to ?come forward and inform the court of their stand on the subject of bandh?, the party had not made up its mind on its course of action. 

 A special bench hearing bandh-related cases has asked the party leaders to appear on Tuesday for the next hearing on a public interest litigation filed by advocate Idris Ali on behalf of the All India Minority Forum, challenging the validity of the dawn-to-dusk bandh called by Trinamul on December 3.

 The leaders did not turn up during a hearing yesterday. 

 Contacted in Beldanga in Murshidabad, former Trinamul MP and barrister Ajit Panja said: ?Two of my party MLAs ? Arunava Ghosh and Kalyan Banerjee ? are looking into the matter. They have been asked to take a decision in this regard.? 

 Panja had fought a legal battle in 1998 against a high court ruling banning bandhs in the state and his submission had prompted the court to modify the order to the extent that there should not be any application of force to implement a bandh. 

 Justice Shyamal Sen had passed both the orders on a petition moved by advocate Supradip Roy, challenging the validity of the bandh called by Trinamul. 

 ?Ajitda has rightly said that our party chief (Mamata Banerjee) has asked me to take a decision. But we have not received a copy of the summons yet,? said Kalyan Banerjee, MLA and a high court advocate. 

 ?At present, I can only say that courts have no jurisdiction to curb the fundamental right of political parties agitating against the government?s anti-people policies. It is the political parties and not courts that can decide on the mode of the agitation,? he added. 

 Arunava Ghosh, another MLA and advocate, echoed him. ?We think it is the fundamental right of political parties to observe bandhs to protest against the policies and decisions of the government. Courts cannot snatch this right. So we don?t think it is a must for us to go to the court,? he said, adding that his party has not yet received any summons from the court. 

 Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly Pankaj Banerjee said Trinamul will stick to its bandh call on December 3. ?Bandh is our fundamental right. Bandhs take place in Europe and America, too. A court cannot stop political parties from holding bandhs,? he added.

 ?There are many other affairs the court can look into. Let the courts come forward to protect the people?s fundamental rights. We are determined to make the bandh a success,? he added.

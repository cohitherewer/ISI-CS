 Shah Rukh fans flee home 

 Behrampore, Nov. 10: Parents of four teens are spending sleepless nights after the boys fled home at Goaljam here last Saturday, apparently to try their luck in Bollywood. ?Rajat used to say his main aim in life is to become a Shah Rukh Khan. We believe all four have left for Mumbai,? said Narayan Saha, father of Rajat. Police said the boy has taken Rs 6,200 from home. 

 The others accompanying him are Somnath Roy, Shibshankar Chakraborty and Kunal Ghosh. All four are students of Class VII and VIII in a local high school.

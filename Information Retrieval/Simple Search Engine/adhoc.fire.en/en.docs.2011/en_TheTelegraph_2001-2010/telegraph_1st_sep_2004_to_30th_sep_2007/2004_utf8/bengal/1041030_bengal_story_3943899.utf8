 BRIEFS

 Krishnagar, Oct. 29: A 14-year-old girl was allegedly raped by her brother?s friends on the evening of Lakshmi Puja at a village in Murutia, Nadia, about 190 km from Calcutta.

 Police said the girl, a Class-VIII student, had gone pandal-hopping on Wednesday evening when the youths aged between 16 and 20 forced her to a deserted house and repeatedly raped her. The accused were Sadhan Kirtania, Harshajit Bala, Golla Tikadar and Madan Das. Kirtania was arrested last night. The rest are absconding. Radharani Roy, the victim?s mother, launched a search when her daughter did not return home till late. Around 10 pm, the girl walked home crying. She told her mother what happened after prodding through the night. The police said her father works in Dubai and she lives with her brother and mother.

 Calcutta: The government will conduct a survey on the 31-km stretch of the Ichhamati in the state. Siltation of the river has caused heavy water-logging in North 24-Parganas over the past few years. The chief minister was mobbed when he went to oversee flood relief there.

 Burdwan: Relatives of a patient recuperating from peptic ulcer surgery at Burdwan Medical College and Hospital stormed the superintendent?s office on Friday. An official said Billa Sheikh?s relatives alleged that his surgical wound was oozing for days and it was not being attended to.

 VIP car hits, injured held

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Dec. 20: One of the symbols of babudom in India, the ubiquitous white Ambassador, made its weight known today when it hit a motorcyclist in Nadia.

 Instead of impounding the car in which Tehatta subdivisional judicial magistrate Subhas Chandra Kar car was travelling, police arrested Bidhan Ghosh, who was bleeding from his head, feet and hands at Betai Market, 150 km from Calcutta.

 As the police showed scant interest in offering first-aid to Ghosh, angry residents and traders blocked the magistrate?s car by placing wooden benches in front of and behind the vehicle. 

 The police said a section of the mob tried to drag the Kar out of the car and hurled brickbats at it.

 Subdivisional police officer Kankan Barui, who arrived with a large contingent, rescued Kar. 

 Ghosh was then sent to a hospital. 

 District superintendent of police Benoy Chakraborty said he was without a helmet and was speeding from the opposite direction. The motorcycle collided with Kar?s car even as it screeched to a halt and Ghosh was thrown off his vehicle, he added. The magistrate?s security guard jumped out and called policemen from a nearby camp. Two policemen promptly arrested Ghosh. 

 During the melee, the magistrate sat inside the car. Witnesses said Kar could have reminded the police that the injured motorcyclist needed medical attention.

 ?The motorcyclist did not have a helmet and he was arrested on charges of rash driving,? the superintendent said.

 Tarak Haldar, a trader who was one of those to block the car, said: ?It is strange that the police arrested Ghosh instead of taking him to the hospital. He did not collide with the car intentionally. Moreover, how can one say for sure that the SDJM?s car was not at fault? We found the motorcyclist seriously injured.? 

 A small group of people who blocked Kar?s way soon swelled to a huge mob and the two policemen who had Ghosh in their custody realised that the situation was spinning out of control. One of them managed to run back to the camp and call up Tehatta police station.

 The superintendent said: ?As soon as the information reached Tehatta police station, the subdivisional police officer was informed. He rushed with a big force.? Lathi-wielding policemen chased those who had gheraoed the magistrate and Haldar was held on charges of rioting.

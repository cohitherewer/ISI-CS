 Doctor shows door, delivery at quack?s 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 21: A nine-month pregnant woman was turned away from Canning Subdivisional hospital last night because a doctor there thought she had come ?early?.

 Razia Bibi, 25, was thus forced to give birth at a quack?s chamber 5 km away near Canning railway station. The child was stillborn. 

 Last Saturday, a woman gave birth to her baby in the portico of Calcutta Medical College and Hospital because the doctors there were ?busy?.

 Six-month-old Shabana Parveen died last year because her parents could not reach the medical college and hospital on time after being turned away from Howrah State General Hospital . 

 Susmita Biswas, a college student in Calcutta, died after lying unattended for hours in a corridor of SSKM Hospital?s emergency ward last October. 

 Horror stories of neglect at healthcare institutions have frequently surfaced over the past year. 

 The chief medical officer of South 24-Parganas, Pradeep Kumar Mondal, today said the doctor should not have refused Razia. ?I have asked the block medical officer of Canning to conduct a probe and submit a report in a week. There is no question of refusal in such an urgent case. It will not be possible for me to make any further comment before I receive the report,? he said.

 Razia and her relatives said the baby could not be saved because of the doctor.

 Husband Rauf Alam took Razia, who was in pain, to the subdivisional hospital, about 70 km from Calcutta, around 8.30 pm. He had started at 6 pm from his Boyer Singh village to cover the 35 km distance to the hospital.

 After checking Razia, the attendant doctor told him to take her home or to the district hospital as ?some more days were left before the delivery?.

 Doing as he was told, Rauf started for home. Around 10, with no ambulance available, he looked around for a rickshaw van to take his wife to the station. There, Razia began feeling ill and started to bleed. Passers-by, alerted by her groans, told Rauf to take his wife to Milan Haldar, the nearest quack. Razia gave birth to a stillborn boy there.

 Mihir Bhadra, a resident of the area who helped Razia to the quack?s chamber with others, said: ?She was bleeding profusely. We were at a loss. Finding no alternative we took her to Haldar.?

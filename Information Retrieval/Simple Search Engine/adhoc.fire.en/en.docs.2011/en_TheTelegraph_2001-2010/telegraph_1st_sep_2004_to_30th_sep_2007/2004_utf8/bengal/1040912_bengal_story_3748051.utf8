 Calcutta, Sept. 11: Swami Vivekananda?s birthplace at 3, Gour Mohan Mukherjee Street, will be thrown open to the public before the Pujas. 

 But it will not remain open for the four days of the Durga Puja ?as it would be difficult to handle the crowd then?. 

 The 64-cottah premises include the original house (now renovated and reconstructed), a cultural centre, a text book library and a research centre. 

 Swami Vishokananda Maharaj, of the Ramakrishna Mission, told reporters on the premises today: ?The restoration work of the house is almost complete and it will look just like it used to during Swamiji?s time. The museum will house exhibits from the life and times of Swami Vivekananda, his brothers Mahendra Nath Datta and Bhupendra Nath Datta, and mother Bhubaneswari Debi.? 

 The building was going to seed when the mission acquired it and the adjacent plot in May 1999. 

 A committee was constituted with conservation engineers of the Archaeological Survey of India and Development Consultants Limited, and bricks, mortar were brought from different parts of the country to restore the original look of the 300-year-old house. 

 The complex, bearing the ?hallowed memory of Swamiji?s birth, infancy and early childhood?, is expected to be a pilgrimage centre and a destination for tourists from all over. 

 The renovation cost Rs 20 crore, with funds coming in from the Centre (Rs 9.9 crore), the state (Rs 6 crore promised) and donations. The state has already given Rs 4 crore and chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has promised the rest soon, he said. 

 Swami Ranganathanandaji Maharaj, president of Ramakrishna Mission, will perform a ritual for the opening on September 26. 

 President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam will formally inaugurate the complex on October 1. The public would be allowed in about 10 days later. He said there would be no entry fee ?for the moment?.

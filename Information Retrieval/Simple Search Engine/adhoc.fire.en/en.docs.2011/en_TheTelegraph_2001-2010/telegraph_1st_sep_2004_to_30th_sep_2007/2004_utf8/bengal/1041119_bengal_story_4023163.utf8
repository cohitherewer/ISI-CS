 Stench amp; stray dogs

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Howrah, Nov. 18: Garbage 

 and waste kept piling in 11 hospitals and health centres 

 in the district as the indefinite strike by cleaners hired 

 on contract entered its third day today.

 Doctors, employees and relatives of patients had to attend clinics covering their nose to keep away the stench. 

 Stray dogs and cats, though, had a good time rummaging through garbage spilling over from vats, scattering them all over and dragging them near hospital corridors.

 ?The authorities should take immediate steps to change the situation because the patients cannot bear the stench,? said Mohua Das, a relative of a patient at a hospital in Uluberia. 

 The workers, who had alleged that they were not paid for the past eight months, said they would continue with the strike if the dues are not cleared. 

 Their leader, Birju Singh, claimed that his family members were starving.

 The district health authorities served an ultimatum to the striking workers. ?We have issued an ultimatum to the contractors, who employed the workers. If they refuse to get back to work tomorrow, money will be deducted from their previous bill,? chief medical officer of health Shankar Saha said.

 The health authorities are also ?thinking of deploying? other hired workers to tide over the crisis.

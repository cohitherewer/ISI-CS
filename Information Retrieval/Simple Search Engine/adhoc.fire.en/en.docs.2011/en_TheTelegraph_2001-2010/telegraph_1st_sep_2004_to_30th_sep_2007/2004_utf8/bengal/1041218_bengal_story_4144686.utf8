 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, Dec. 17: Power minister Mrinal Banerjee today defended the decision to engage China-based Dong Fang for the construction of a power plant in Murshidabad and capacity enhancement of a Burdwan unit, saying it quoted less than Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited.

 During the monsoon session of the Assembly, mayor Subrata Mukherjee had accused the minister of giving the contract to Dong Fang violating norms. He had also alleged that Dong Fang had been blacklisted by the National Hydel Power Corporation. The Chinese firm will build a 600mw unit at Sagardighi and add 300mw to a Durgapur Projects Limited plant.

 Replying to a question by leader of the Opposition Pankaj Banerjee, the minister said BHEL had demanded Rs 2.83 crore for the projects and Dong Fang Rs 2.58 crore .

 Calcutta: A faction of the state BJP led by former Union minister Tapan Sikdar on Friday defied a party whip and staged a sit-in near Metro cinema under the banner of the Shyama Prasad Jagaran Manch. Addressing the rally, Sikdar said the Manch had to protest against infiltration from Bangladesh, criminalisation of politics and manipulation of electoral rolls as the state party leaders are ?mum?. Bengal BJP chief Tathagata Roy said: ?The rally amounts to anti-party activity.?

 Chinsurah: Jahar Rakshit, 32, forced his sons, aged eight and four, to consume poison and then took it himself in Jangipara, Hooghly, about 30 km from Calcutta. The children, Soumen and Ramen, died in hospital. Hearing about the deaths, his wife Manasi consumed pesticide. The couple is fighting for their lives.

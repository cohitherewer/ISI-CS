 Postmen toting mobile phones in villages put state on top 

 M. RAJENDRAN

 New Delhi, Oct. 4: Bengal 

 has emerged as the highest revenue earner for Bharat Sanchar 

 Nigam Ltd (BSNL) from its mobile postman or Grameen Sanchar 

 Sewak scheme launched last year.

 The state has garnered over Rs 90 crore out of Rs 200 crore collected by BSNL till August.

 The project seeks to provide telephone facilities in villages where it is uneconomical to provide landline telephone services. 

 Under the programme, the local postman doubles as a grameen sanchar sewak. As he goes about his daily round of delivering letters in remote and inaccessible areas, he carries with him a mobile fixed-wireless terminal with a display unit in a carry bag, enabling him to offer a telephone facility to the villagers in these areas.

 The telephone unit, which costs about Rs 10,000, is supplied by BSNL.

 A senior BSNL official said: ?The project has taken off in a big way. It has not only received a good response from the users but also the postal department. West Bengal has done extremely well; we earn the highest revenue from this service there.?

 Other states that have contributed significantly are Orissa, Madhya Pradesh and Jharkhand. 

 Last year, the department of post and BSNL joined hands to offer door-to-door mobile phone services in rural areas through the postman. Currently, about 2,000 grameen sanchar sewaks carry the fixed-wireless set in more than 10,000 villages as franchisee for BSNL.

 Bangladesh was the first to launch a ?grameen (rural) telephone? service, which was a huge hit. The ?village phone? concept was developed by combining Grameen Bank?s experience with micro-enterprises and the latest digital wireless technology and the tested and proven idea of public call offices (PCOs) and privately operated phone centres.

 A Grameen Bank member obtains ownership of the phone under its lease-financing programme and provides the services to the people in the adjoining area. The bank collects the phone bills along with its other dues. 

 Each village phone remains in the custody of a local pay-phone operator, who is responsible for extending the services to the customers for both incoming and outgoing calls, collection of call charges according to prescribed rates and maintenance of the telephone set.

 The grameen sanchar sewaks collect a service charge of Re 1 for calls between 100 and 200 km and Rs 2 for calls beyond 200 km. They can also charge Rs 5 for passing on the message to persons concerned in the village.

 However, BSNL sources said the service needs to be improved to enhance revenue. A senior official in the department of post said: ?The sanchar sewaks should carry a ready-reckoner for easy calculation of the call cost. But the company is yet to procure them in enough numbers. As a result, there is a loss of revenue.?

 The postal department gets a 20 per cent revenue share for all outgoing calls. The grameen sanchar sewak receives 5 per cent of the total revenue from calls made from his equipment. He is required to deposit Rs 20 every month as insurance premium for the equipment and remit the same to the postal department.

 Initially, BSNL was reluctant to take up the project as it feared that it would not bring in much from unremunerative areas. In addition, the company feared that the project would place an additional burden in terms of network management and maintenance.

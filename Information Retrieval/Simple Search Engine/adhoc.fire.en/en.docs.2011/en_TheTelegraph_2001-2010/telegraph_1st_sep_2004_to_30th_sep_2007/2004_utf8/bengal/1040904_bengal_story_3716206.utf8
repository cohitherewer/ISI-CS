 In towel amp; tipsy, babu turns office a parlour

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Raiganj, Sept. 3: Sprawled 

 on a charpoy, with a towel around his waist and fingers 

 around a glass of liquor, Dhruba S. Thapa was enjoying his 

 massage. In his office. At 11 am on Friday.

 The deputy collector (preventive) of the excise department was not expecting visitors, and definitely not gatecrashers. He tried hiding the glass he was holding after being caught unawares by this correspondent and a host of residents, but the weight of the masseur on his back prevented him from doing so. 

 The half-empty bottle nearby and his inebriated colleagues in the next room did not help his case. It has been a hectic week. I thought the massage would help me relax, Thapa said.

 Residents of Tulsipara, where Thapa has his three-room office, said otherwise. 

 It is a rented house and while two rooms are used for office work, some of the staff members stay in the other three. Such drinking sessions are regular and the officers have become a nuisance, said a resident who tipped-off this correspondent about the party when he was not able to put up with the nonsense any more.

 Kalicharan Munda, the youth who was massaging Thapa, said: I massage babu every Friday morning. This is not the first time that the officers here are having a party during office hours.

 It was evident from the lavish preparations for lunch in an adjacent room. The party had just begun. 

 The table and benches had been moved to one side and occupying centrestage was an LPG cylinder connected to an oven on which meat curry was being cooked. Peels of ginger and garlic were strewn all over and a liquor bottle stood in a corner.

 Apprehensive of what the agitated residents would do, the excise officials apologised as well as they could in the intoxicated state.

 They have been vitiating the atmosphere. Such mehfils are held regularly. We wont allow such things in our locality, said Pranesh Roy, who stays a building away from the office.

 Thapa did not apologise. A colleague was recently transferred to Siliguri. We are holding his farewell party today, he said. He could not name the colleague in whose honour the party was being held.

 Hunger crusader quits CPM 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Calcutta, Dec. 29: Kailash Mura, a member of the CPM-controlled panchayat at Banspahari, today announced he was joining the Samajwadi Party. 

 Mura, who had stung the government by claiming that five persons had succumbed to hunger in Amlashol village, today alleged that West Midnapore officials and CPM leaders were persecuting him for blowing the whistle. 

 ?I am convinced that several people died in Amlashol and other villages either due to starvation or lack of medical facilities,? he added. The CPM had contested the charge, but not before initiating development work in the neglected region. 

 Mura, who was here to announce the switchover, said he also decided to join the Samajwadi Party after he was beaten up, with some CPM leaders, by Naxalite extremists at Kamthree early this month. 

 Welcoming Mura?s induction, Samajwadi state unit president Vijay Upadhay claimed ?disgruntled? CPM workers were joining his party. 

 The CPM leadership dismissed Mura?s allegations. ?We are not bothered about Mura joining the Samajwadi Party. But it is not true that development work is not being carried out in villages. In fact, we cannot carry out development work in 4,700 villages due to obstructions,? said CPM state secretary Anil Biswas.

 Dahareswar Sen, CPM district secretariat member, claimed Mura was not a primary member of the CPM. ?We backed him when he contested the panchayat elections.?

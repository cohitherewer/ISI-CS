 Youth dies in territory battle

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 18: A 35-year-old was killed early this morning as a fallout of territorial supremacy battles between the CPM and the RSP across Basanti, Kultali and Kulpi in South 24-Parganas.

 A group of youths pumped bullets from point-blank range into Akhtar Khan around 3.30 am when they spotted him at Amjora village under Basanti police station, 80 km from Calcutta. The youths disappeared before Akhtar, who was guarding a waterbody he had taken on lease for pisciculture, could raise an alarm.

 Akhtar, the son of the upapradhan of the Amjora panchayat, died before he could be rushed to hospital. Police have arrested one person, Lutfaar Khan, who residents of the area claim is an RSP worker.

 The RSP, according to the residents, had been waiting to hit back since the panchayat was grabbed by the CPM. Villagers add that Mukadaat Khan had used his influence to ensure that the particular waterbody was leased to his son.

 ?Khan and his men had thwarted attempts by an RSP member to bag the contract of the waterbody,? said a gram panchayat member. Villagers said Akhtar was also eyeing waterbodies in the RSP area.

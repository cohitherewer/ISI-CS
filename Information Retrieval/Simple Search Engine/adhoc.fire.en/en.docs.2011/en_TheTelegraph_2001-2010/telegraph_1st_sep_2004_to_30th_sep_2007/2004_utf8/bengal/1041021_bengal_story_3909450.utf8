 Board moots vigil role

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Calcutta, Oct. 20: The Madhyamik board has decided to introduce its own system of inspection to keep an eye on implementation of rules and regulations in schools in an effort to improve the quality of education. 

 The decision was taken in a meeting of the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education last week after complaints that many affiliated schools were not following its directives on syllabi, regular classes, teaching methods, a time-table for classes and wrapping up syllabi and examinations. 

 ?We were toying with the idea of setting up independent inspection teams to run regular checks on the academic activities of our affiliated schools for quite some time. We now intend to take a positive step on this score as many of our members are strongly in favour of intensifying inspection of schools,? said board secretary Swapan Bhattacharya.

 Now, inspectors of the school education department maintain a vigil on state-aided schools affiliated to the board. 

 ?The education department inspectors are supposed to monitor both administrative and academic functioning of all board-affiliated schools. But they hardly get time to detect academic irregularities because they have to devote most of their time to solving other (administrative) problems,? said a board member. 

 The members pointed out that in many schools prescribed text books are not followed, the class routines do not conform to guidelines and class tests and terminal examinations are not held according to rules. 

 Officials said the board will need a lot of additional staff to conduct inspections in 1,200 Madhyamik and junior high (till class VIII) schools affiliated to it. ?We have sent a proposal to the government seeking its permission to recruit retired teachers and retired inspectors,? the official said.

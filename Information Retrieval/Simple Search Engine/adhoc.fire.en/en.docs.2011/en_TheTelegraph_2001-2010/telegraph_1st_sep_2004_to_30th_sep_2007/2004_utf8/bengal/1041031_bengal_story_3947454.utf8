 Anger over twin mishaps 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Oct. 30: A mob tonight vented its anger on a minibus and a private bus at Ananda Palit Road in Entally after a youth was knocked down around 10 pm. He has been admitted in hospital. 

 The people also blocked the road for two hours to protest against reckless driving. 

 Tempers were frayed as a blind person, Mazur Parvez, was run over and his wife injured by a matador van at the same spot this morning. The incident occurred around 8.30 am when Mazur was crossing the road with Sultana. 

 Mazur was declared dead at Chittaranjan National Medical College and Hospital, where Sultana is battling for life. 

 Fake notes arrest: Acting on a tip-off from Mumbai police, three persons, including a Bangladeshi, were held and fake notes worth Rs 2.5 lakh in Rs 500 notes were seized in Free School Street.

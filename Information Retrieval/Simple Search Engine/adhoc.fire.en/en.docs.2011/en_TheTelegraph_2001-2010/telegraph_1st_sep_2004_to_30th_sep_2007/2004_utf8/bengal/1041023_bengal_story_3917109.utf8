 BRIEFS

 Krishnagar, Oct. 22: A gang of seven entered a pandal in Swarupgunj, about 100 km from Calcutta, early today and stole a gold necklace of the goddess, smashed lights and fled. 

 Four persons have been arrested. Police said they were part of the gang and had raided the pandal with revolvers and daggers. Nabadwip panchayat samiti chief Haridas Debnath, who is one of the organisers, said the puja is over a century old and will continue with a new idol.

 Calcutta: Members of Pragati Sangha in Purba Putiary ransacked a fire tender and roughed up firemen accusing them of arriving late at their pandal on Friday evening, fire officials said. ?The pandal wall made of straw caught fire following a short circuit caused by faulty wiring, but the organisers blamed us,? said an official.

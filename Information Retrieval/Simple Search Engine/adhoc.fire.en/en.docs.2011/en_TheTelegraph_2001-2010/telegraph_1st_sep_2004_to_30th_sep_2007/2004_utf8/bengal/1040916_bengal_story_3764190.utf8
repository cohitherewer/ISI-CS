 Rain ravage in districts

 OUR BUREAU 

 Sept. 15: Heavy rains over the past few days led to the subsidence of railway tracks near Miangram Halt in Murshidabad which was detected only half-an-hour before the Down Kamrup Express was to pass over it. 

 The continuous downpour has also resulted in severe erosion along the Padma in the district. 

 In south Bengal, prolonged power failure and disruption in telephone connections were reported after overhead cables were snapped. 

 The erosion has forced 50 families in Doyrampur, Parashpur and Taltali in Jalangi, 230 km from Calcutta, to shift to safer places yesterday. The BSF, too, had to shift its Doyrampur outpost. 

 The river claimed the original building several years ago. ?We were operating from a camp which was also taken away by the river in Doyrampur. So, the jawans had no option than to shift to a safer place,? said G.K. Sharma, the deputy inspector-general of the BSF?s Behrampore sector. 

 A 60-metre stretch of tracks near Miangram Halt in the Katwa-Azimgunj line caved in around 11 pm yesterday. Long distance trains like the Down Teesta-Torsha Express and the Up Kamrup Express were diverted through the Rampurhat-Sahebgunj line last night. The Down Janshatabdi Express was also redirected this morning. At least 10 local trains were cancelled. 

 ?The Down Kamrup Express had a providential escape. When the train reached Salar after leaving Howrah, news came that the track ahead at Miangram had subsided. The train was supposed to reach Miangram half-an-hour later,? said Phanindranath Chatterjee, station master of Katwa. 

 In Birbhum, at least 1,000 telephone lines are down in Suri town and its adjoining areas. Bolpur and its neighbourhood are reeling under severe power cuts following short circuits in at least three places. Overhead wires snapped after trees fell on them at two places. 

 Similar reports of disruption to telephone and power lines were also received from Burdwan and Hooghly districts.

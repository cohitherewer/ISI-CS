 Bar panel rein on fake marks

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, Dec. 4: The Bar 

 Council of West Bengal has set up a committee for scrutinising 

 testimonials to check the practice of submitting fake marksheets 

 for enrolment as an advocate.

 ?This is one of the series of measures we have taken to put an end to the trend of producing fake marksheets and, subsequently, getting an approval from the council for practising in different courts across the state,? Saradindu Biswas, a former chairman and presently an executive member of the bar council, said on Saturday.

 Biswas said the committee, headed by eminent city-based lawyer Bimal Chatterjee, has sought lists of successful candidates of this year?s law examinations from various universities in Bengal, Bihar and Jharkhand, from where most of the applications come.

 This is the first batch of students to have completed the course since it changed from a three-year to a five-year programme and 500 aspiring lawyers have applied for the council?s approval.

 ?We will scrutinise the credentials of every candidate,? said Biswas. The scrutiny will be done on December 6 and the approvals given the same day.

 The panel is also probing charges of producing fake marksheets levelled against several lawyers. ?We are sending the details of those lawyers against whom such allegations have come to the universities concerned for verification,? a member of the panel said.

 Parents bruised for a plot 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Burdwan, Nov. 2: Tortured and thrashed by his son, a 74-year-old man is praying for justice. But two complaints with police over the past year has not produced any result. 

 A plot of land in the town has robbed Sukumar Shau of Ghoshpara of peace. A hundred kilometres from Calcutta, he lives in fear of son Shyamal, a public health engineering department sub-assistant engineer in Durgapur. 

 Yesterday, Sukumar met local CPM MP Nikhilananda Sar who, in effect, supported Shyamal?s demand. He asked Sukumar to sell the land, valued about Rs 5 lakh, to his son. 

 ?I have asked Shyamal to make a bank fixed-deposit of Rs 1 lakh. He will also pay a certain sum every month to his parents. If Shyamal does not abide by the settlement, we will ensure that the old man gets back his land,? said Sar.

 Understandably, Sukumar is not happy. ?What happens if he doesn?t keep his promise?? 

 ?On June 6, he hit me in the face. I bled from the nose. I lodged a complaint with the Burdwan police station. Last year, in November, I had lodged a similar complaint. No action was taken,? said Sukumar.

 From Durgapur, Shyamal said: ?My father is a mental patient. He isn?t talking sense.?

 Superintendent Niraj K. Singh has ordered a probe into why the police did not react. 

 Shyamal?s mother said: ?We are fed up with the humiliation and torture??

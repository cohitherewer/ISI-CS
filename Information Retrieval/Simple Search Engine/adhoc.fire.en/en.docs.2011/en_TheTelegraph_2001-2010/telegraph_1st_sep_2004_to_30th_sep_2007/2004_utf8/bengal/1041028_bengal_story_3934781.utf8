 Purge push in Jan meet 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Oct. 27: The CPM central committee will meet here in January to discuss, among other things, measures to streamline and expand the organisation.

 CPM officials today said the January date would be an extension of the central committee?s meeting slated for October 30 and 31 in the wake of the politburo meeting scheduled for October 29 in Delhi. 

 Significantly, the Calcutta meeting will precede the party?s state conference in February. It is learnt that the state leadership is planning to bring in youthful faces in places of a few influential leaders. ?We want to bring into focus leaders who are young, new at their jobs and have a clean image,? said one official. 

 CPM insiders indicated that the state leadership will work hard to get the stamp of approval from the central leadership for its purge of ?dishonest and corrupt? leaders. ?The central committee in January will discuss the issue,? one official said. 

 In a party document, CPM state secretary Anil Biswas again hit out at corruption among the ranks, saying some trade unionists are hobnobbing with industry owners at the expense of the workers and many leaders are dabbling in the construction business for personal gains. 

 ?Sometimes, such practices are considered normal affairs and our leadership is not reacting to these vices instantly,? he said. 

 Biswas also made it clear that party membership will not be considered a ?priority? in getting jobs in government departments. ?We have to create the impression among our members that they will not get any priority in getting government jobs. Neither will their membership help them protect their self-aggrandisement,? he added.

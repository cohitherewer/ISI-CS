 Abuse amp; scolding drive girl to flames 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Burdwan, Dec. 8: A girl who was molested by a neighbour and scolded when she told her uncle what had happened set herself on fire last night in her house at Lakshmipur Math in this town. 

 Eleven-year-old Puja sustained 90 per cent burn injuries before her father doused the flames. She is battling for life at the Burdwan Medical College and Hospital.

 Mewalal Shau, the middle-aged neighbour accused of molesting her, is absconding. 

 ?We are trying to arrest Mewalal, who is absconding. The girl is in a very critical condition and she has given a statement to the police,? said Burdwan superintendent Neeraj Singh. 

 The police raided Mewalal?s house and detained his son Rajesh for interrogation. 

 Today, the girl regained consciousness for some time when the police recorded her statement. ?The girl told us what happened and we have started our investigation accordingly,? Singh said.

 Puja, daughter of tea stall owner Dilip Shau, was alone at home yesterday when Mewalal entered the room. He allegedly molested her and tried to rape her. Puja raised an alarm and her uncle Raju rushed in from outside. 

 Mewalal pushed Raju aside and fled. Police said after Mewalal escaped, Raju did not blame him. He pulled up his niece, adding to the girl?s trauma. He then locked her in the house and left in a huff. 

 When everyone went to sleep last night, Puja tiptoed to the kitchen, poured kerosene and set herself on fire.

 Alerted by her cries, the family woke up. Dilip managed to throw a blanket on her and put out the flames, but by then she was severely burnt. She was rushed to hospital in an unconscious state.

 ?My daughter killed herself not being able to bear the shame and humiliation. My brother told me that he saw his niece with the man and scolded the girl after she told her everything. I came to know about it at night after I returned home. I had decided to contact the police the next morning but my daughter could not wait,? said Dilip, tears streaming down. 

 He lodged a complaint with the police this morning.

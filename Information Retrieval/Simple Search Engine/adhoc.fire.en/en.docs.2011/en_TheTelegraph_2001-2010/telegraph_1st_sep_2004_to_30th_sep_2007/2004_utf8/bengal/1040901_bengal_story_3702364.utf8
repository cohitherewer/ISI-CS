 Father kills 4 before suicide

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Midnapore, Aug. 31: Suspicion 

 about his wifes fidelity apparently prompted Harekrishna 

 Bera, 40, a small farmer, to butcher his four children and 

 commit suicide.

 The gruesome sequence was enacted last night at Amladangri village in West Midnapore, about 200 km from Calcutta.

 Beras wife Renubala left the house in the afternoon after being beaten up. Gita, 14, Ranjit, 11, Sanjib, 7, and Rita, 3, fell asleep around 8 pm. Bera killed all four with a spade and then hanged himself from the ceiling. 

 When neighbours entered the house through a window, the children were in pools of blood. Sanjib was not dead but groaning in pain. He died on way to the hospital.

 Police said Bera suspected that his wife was having an affair with a local youth and beat her regularly. Renubala took shelter in her parents house after being driven out by her husband.

 A neighbour, Madan Bera, said: We heard some muffled sound around 10 pm and knocked on the door. It was locked from inside, but there was no response. Somehow we succeeded in opening the window of their bedroom and found the mutilated bodies. Harekrishna was hanging from the ceiling. 

 Another neighbour, Buri Bera, said the village was aware of Beras suspicion.

 Local CPM leaders had tried to settle their dispute. Tapasi Maiti, the local secretary of the partys womens wing, said: They often fought over petty issues. We tried our best to restore peace in the family, but our efforts did not yield result. Renubala came to us yesterday morning to lodge a fresh complaint against her husband. We told her that we would have another counselling session with him. Bera came to our office shortly after that and took her home.

 Officer-in-charge of Nayagram police station Swarup Basak said Beras beating the same afternoon left Renubala injured in the face.

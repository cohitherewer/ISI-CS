 Eye on unholy link after surrender 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 7: A day after Ramesh Mahato, one of Bengal?s most-wanted criminals, surrendered in a Howrah court, the Criminal Investigation Department turned the spotlight on the nexus between police and crime lords. 

 The CID today said Mahato had managed to elude the net so long because of his links with key members of the special team set up to track him down.

 With several cases of murder and kidnapping against him in Hooghly and Howrah, Mahato?s surrender brought to an end an elaborate but quiet hunt by the CID. 

 R.K. Mohanty, the additional director-general of police (CID), said: ?It will not be proper to draw a conclusion regarding police-criminal nexus on the basis of the Mahato case.? But his department has a list of officers who were in touch with Mahato all along.

 One of the crime lord?s alleged contacts was Debasish Chakraborty, the officer-in-charge of Uttarpara police station, who was suspended on Monday.

 ?We are still in the process of investigation. It appears that this particular officer was acting against the interests of the CID. Besides, there was dereliction of duty,? Mohanty said. 

 Though many of the sleuths have sealed their lips, an insider said Mahato had provided the vehicle that brought Dr Sushil Pal from Konnnagar to Bally in Howrah to perform an abortion, which he refused. 

 Pal, a resident of Bright Street, was killed. His body was found in a canal in Sankrail, Howrah, on July 4. 

 Before being posted in Uttarpara, Chakraborty was the officer-in-charge of Bhadreswar police station, which was adjudged the ?best managed? in the state. Sources said he had recently raided a hideout of Bhlolanath Das, a key figure in Hooghly?s underworld who is also said to be a CID ?source?. 

 The special team comprising several OCs, including Chakraborty, had been set up to trace Mahato. When there was no result, the CID reportedly started tapping the mobile phones of the officers and probing their activities.

 BRIEFS

 Chandernagore, Nov. 28: Subhas Dutta, a percussionist who has played with Pandit Hari Prasad Chowrasia and Shiv Kumar Sharma, was arrested today on charges of trying to produce fake visas.

 Sanatan Sandhu Khan, the owner of a printing press, was arrested along with Dutta. Hooghly superintendent of police Ajay Kumar said: ?Dutta had earlier travelled to France and Switzerland. So he knew the format of visas of those countries.? During Dutta?s stay in Delhi, one Baldev Singh apparently offered him a deal for supplying 5,000 visas of France and Switzerland. A resident of Chandernagore, he was trying to get visas replicated at Bodaichanditala, a village where he was held.

 Howrah has, Calcutta hasn?t

 Calcutta, Sept. 18: Howrah ? the name conjures images of grimy dhabas on narrow, congested roads hugged by overflowing, open drains and unplanned, ugly highrises. 

 But once a car sweeps into the sprawling Grewal Auto Service, all this seems far from your mind. 

 Even filling the tank could be, as the delicious aroma of pastries, patties and savouries tickle you taste buds before the full-bodied flavours of chicken hariyali, mutton rogan josh, tandoori aloo butter masala and much more buffets the olfactory nerves. 

 For three-months, the modern dhaba (with a clean kitchen), bakery and convenience shop attached to the fuel station has been serving Howrahites. 

 ?There are nearly 96 BPCL (Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited) pumps in Calcutta and Howrah and Grewal Auto Service is the only station in entire Howrah and Calcutta to have this three-in-one facility for customers ? a bakery, a dhaba and a Convenio shop. What makes this pump very different from others is its bakery,? said Shatrughan Rath, the Calcutta territory manager of BPCL. 

 ?The kitchen is located outside the restricted explosive zone and the permission to run the dhaba and the bakery has been granted strictly in conformity with government rules,? he added.

 Well-stocked Convenio outlets are a common sight now, but the Grewals have made their outlet unique in many respects. 

 ?Highly trained chefs with experience of working with five-star hotels in Calcutta, Mumbai and even Kuwait have been engaged in the bakery section and our products are going to be as good as the stuff produced by the well-known cake and pastry shops of the city. 

 ?Our outlet is unique also because we have installed highly sophisticated electrical gadgets in the bakery as well as in our kitchen to ensure maximum hygiene and cleanliness,? said Karan Grewal, owner of the petrol pump and a resident of south Calcutta. 

 The bakery ? fully air-conditioned ? is now producing only a few items. But they have plans of expansion. 

 ?We are not getting a very wide range of food. But the prices are affordable and we are impressed by the hospitality of the staff,? said Sumit Nag, who has visited the facilities several times.

 Laloo promise

 Calcutta, Nov. 24: Laloo Prasad Yadav has written to jails minister and Balurghat MLA Biswanath Chowdhury expressing his intent to sanction a railway line between Balurghat and Hili in South Dinajpur this financial year itself.

 The railway minister has said in a letter that provisions were made for the 25-km line in the last budget. 

 Buoyed by the news, Chowdhury wrote to the railway minister asking for commencement of train services between Eklakhi in Malda and Balurghat. The line is long in place and ticket booking counters and other offices constructed. The railway has also conducted a trial run, but trains are yet to start plying.

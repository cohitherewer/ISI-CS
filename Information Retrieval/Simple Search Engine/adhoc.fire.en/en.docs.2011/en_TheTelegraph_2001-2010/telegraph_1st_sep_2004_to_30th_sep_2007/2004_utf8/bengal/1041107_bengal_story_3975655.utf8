 Rejig plan for Basu guards

 OUR BUREAU 

 Calcutta, Nov. 6: Investigations into the ATM fraud on Jyoti Basu?s bank account continued today as Calcutta police decided to change the security detail at Indira Bhavan, the former chief minister?s residence in Salt Lake. 

 The decision to replace the personnel deployed at the house was taken after A.K. Maliwal, special security officer in charge of Basu?s security, held a meeting with Calcutta police officials. 

 ?The stolen ATM card has been destroyed but we have identified the details of the operation,? said V. Mishra, inspector-general of police (South Bengal range). ?We are expecting to recover the money soon,? he added. 

 The theft, which occurred between March 9 and 19 this year, came to light on Wednesday when Basu was examining a statement from the State Bank of India. 

 Assistant sub-inspector Ardhendu Mondal from the intelligence branch had stolen Basu?s ATM card with the help of a cook and a Group D employee and siphoned off over Rs 1 lakh. Mondal, assigned to oversee Basu?s security along with the others since 1997, has been arrested with cook Dilip Sau. 

 ?We are interrogating them,? said Mishra. 

 An investigator said over Rs 1 lakh had been taken out of Basu?s account in instalments of Rs 5,000, Rs 10,000 and Rs 15,000 without his knowledge. By March 19, the balance had been reduced to Rs 57.39. 

 The account was opened a few years ago to enable Basu to credit his pension ? Rs 3,000 a month ? and medical allowances due to him as a former MLA.

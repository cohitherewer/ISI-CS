 Rural grooming for jobs

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, Dec. 25: Undergraduate colleges outside Calcutta, which had introduced courses to improve students? communicative English to help them perform well during job interviews, are now working towards helping students develop personality to facilitate them in getting jobs in big companies.

 The colleges have embarked upon this exercise in light of reports reaching the government that young graduates from rural Bengal often cut a sorry figure at job interviews conducted by big companies. 

 ?Our finding is that the graduates passing out of colleges based in urban belts have better communication skills and are equipped with the right personality to meet the demands of the interviewers,? said a senior education official on the condition of anonymity.

 ?Students from rural colleges are equally good in academics. But they are shy and unable to present themselves well before interview boards,? said the general secretary, West Bengal Council of College Principals, Ranajit Basu.

 ?We intend to ensure proper grooming of their personality,? he said.

 Pranab Bhattacharya, the head of the Sree Chaitanya College in Habra, North 24-Parganas, cites the example of a student from his institution who secured a first class first in 2004?s B.Sc (chemistry honours) examination, but failed miserably at job interviews. ?He is very brilliant and manages English well. But his lack of personality goes against him. Young people like him need care and attention,? Bhattacharya said.

 The government, officials said, is worried at the situation in rural Bengal where the socio-economic structure is changing drastically.

 Reports with the government attribute the rural student?s inadequacies to the government?s no-English policy in the primary stage of school education for a long time from 1982. The ban was lifted last year but lakhs of students who had studied in the 57,000 state-aided institutions in the two decades developed little or no understanding of English.

 Colleges have now been asked to introduce classes in communicative English, in an acknowledgement of the importance of the language, specially in the wake of the growth of industries in the districts ? and the emphasis on the IT sector.

 Principals of all 300-odd colleges, particularly those in the rural belt, will sit together soon to chalk out a strategy. 

 Classes will be held to make students proficient in Hindi as well. Colleges will also organise career fairs, year-long seminars, workshops and group discussions.

 ? Some of the colleges in the districts have already arranged job melas and gradually such events will be made compulsory for all institutions,? Basu said.

 ? If the demands of the present employers are to be taken into consideration, teaching students merely on how to speak English will not help. Instead, they need an overall improvement of their personality to present themselves properly during the interviews,? another principal said.

 Apart from making them fluent in English, undergraduate colleges are laying stress on the following aspects of their personality development: 

 ? Talking style.

 ? Dress.

 ? Manners.

 ? Overall movement, like style of walking particularly during entry and exit to interview halls.

 ? Awareness on one?s certain bad habits like not to fidget with the table while speaking to interviewers.

 Ends.

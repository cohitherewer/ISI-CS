 Trade union leader quits

 Calcutta, Nov. 24: Dipak Mukherjee, a former CPM legislator and trade unionist, has snapped his long association with the party following a feud in the South 24-Parganas unit. 

 Mukherjee was a member of the party?s district secretariat. His resignation, ahead of the party conference in January, has ruffled leaders.

 Though district secretary Santimoy Bhattacharjee refused comment, insiders alleged that Mukherjee ?accumulated wealth misusing his position?. 

 Mukherjee, who sent his resignation two days ago, has clammed up.

 State CPM leaders are worried about any development in South 24-Parganas after former district secretary Samir Putatunda quit with several others to launch a new outfit.

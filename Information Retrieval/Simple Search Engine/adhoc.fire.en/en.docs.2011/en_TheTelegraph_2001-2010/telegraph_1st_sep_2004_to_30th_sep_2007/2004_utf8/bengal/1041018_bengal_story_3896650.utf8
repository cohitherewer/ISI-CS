 Sagar key to port success story

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 17: Once the proposed port off Sagar island is commissioned, Calcutta Port Trust will be the largest cargo handler in the country.

 ?We are expecting to handle an estimated cargo of 65 million tonnes once the port is commissioned. This will be the highest volume of cargo handled by any port in the country,? port trust chairman A.K. Chanda said today. 

 He also claimed that Calcutta Port Trust registered the highest growth in the country in the past two years and the volume of cargo handled went up by 10 million tonnes.

 Chanda was speaking on the sidelines of a programme to celebrate 134 years of Calcutta Port Trust and the diamond jubilee of Howrah Bridge.

 He said the feasibility study for the new port would be taken up by the Japan International Co-operation Agency, which is likely to start working on a detailed project report by March.

 Chanda said: ?The project cost and other details can be figured out after the study.? Twelve berths are being planned at the port, he added. Haldia has two. 

 A 3-km rail-road bridge is being planned to connect the port to the hinterland. ?We have had discussions with the Railway Board and its response was positive,? Chanda said. A team of railway officials visited the proposed site recently. 

 The port trust will also hold talks with the National Highway Authority of India. 

 Decoration, illumination and painting of the Howrah bridge began today as part of the jubilee celebrations. 

 Governor Viren J. Shah inaugurated a website on the bridge and post-master general P.K. Chatterjee released a special cover on it.

 Duo held after express heist

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Behrampore, Nov. 11: A duo has been arrested in connection with a dacoity last night on the New Alipurduar-bound Teesta-Torsha Express.

 Police have recovered some of the stolen ornaments from Shish Mohammad Sheikh and Saiful Sheikh, who were arrested from Babupur in Dhuliyan, about 280 km from Calcutta.

 The police said around 8 pm yesterday, a gang of four men armed with daggers and revolvers looted 22 passengers of gold ornaments and cash in a general compartment. 

 ?The dacoits jumped off the train before it rolled into Dhuliyan-Ganga station,? a railway official said. 

 The officer-in-charge of Shamshergunj police station, Dipak Das, said a search is on to trace the two other dacoits. 

 ?We have been told by superintendent of police Gyanwant Singh to cooperate with railway police in matters of crime on trains and we are trying our best to arrest the culprits,? he added. 

 ?Saiful Sheikh, who is from Malda, was in Sish Mohammad?s house,? said Das. 

 The arrested dacoits have been handed over to the Government Railway Police. 

 Train deaths

 Two passengers died as they fell from the over-crowded Howrah-Gaya Express in Bihar?s Nawada district. 

 Railway officials attributed the excessive rush to Diwali and Chhat puja celebrations.

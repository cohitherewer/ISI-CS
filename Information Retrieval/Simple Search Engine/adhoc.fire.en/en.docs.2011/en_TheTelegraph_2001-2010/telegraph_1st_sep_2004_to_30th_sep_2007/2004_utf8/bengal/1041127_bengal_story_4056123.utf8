 4 youths held in Pinki case

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Ranaghat, Nov. 26: Hours after athlete Pinki Pramanik was granted bail, four youths were arrested last night on charges of eve-teasing her last Sunday. 

 Police said the four were among those who harassed Pinki near Habibpur station, 70 km from Calcutta, and dragged her to the office of panchayat pradhan Saraswati Sarkar. Sarkar found a one-shot pistol in her kit, which led to her arrest. 

 Rabin Chakraborty, Uttam Ghosh, Chitta Biswas and Ashu Biswas were arrested from Shantipur, Habibpur and Fulia during night raids. 

 ?We have also found a firearm from the possession of one of them. They will be produced in Ranaghat court tomorrow,? said additional superintendent of police Biswarup Ghosh. 

 Pinki, a Group-D railway employee, had initially said she found the pistol in a toilet of the divisional railway manager?s office in Sealdah. Later, she told the police the youths had planted the gun in her bag.

 Yesterday, three traders of Habibpur told the judge who granted Pinki bail that they saw the youths put the pistol in Pinki?s bag. 

 The police said they did not find proof of links with criminals or Naxalite groups during interrogation.

 Advani stamp on ties with Trinamul 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 10: When Mamata Banerjee?s Trinamul Congress is divided over its alliance with the BJP, its president L.K. Advani called for strengthening of ties.

 A section of the Trinamul brass believes that the party?s sticking to the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance is costing it dear in elections.

 But Advani, who described the ?BJP-Trinamul combine as the only alternative to the ruling Left Front? in Bengal, said leaders of both the BJP and Trinamul should strive to improve relations between the two. 

 When Advani and party vice-president Sushil Modi addressed BJP workers in Town Hall this afternoon, Trinamul leaders Subrata Mukherjee and Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay were in the audience.

 Advani said: ?It is a matter of concern for all nationalist parties that the CPM and the CPI have gained the power to control the Congress-led government in Delhi when communist countries are trying to give up their ideals.?

 ?Till the other day, they (the Left parties) had no say in national politics. But now they are a determining factor at the Centre,? Advani added.

 Speaking on the occasion, Mukherjee, the city mayor and Trinamul legislator, criticised the CPM for not allowing a ?fair? election since the Assembly polls in 1977.

 Some Trinamul leaders, however, put the blame for the party?s electoral losses more on waning minority votes.

 The BJP, which does not have a single MP from the state, is hopeful of bagging seven in the next elections, Advani said. ?In Bengal, the CPM-led government has survived 27 years without serving the people. The Congress will not be able to dislodge them. The Trinamul-BJP combine is the alternative. You have to keep this in mind and improve relations between the parties.?

 Landmines on CM route to rebel zone 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Purulia, Sept. 9: Four 

 landmines were found yesterday on the route the chief minister 

 is likely to take two days later when he visits Jhalda in 

 the district.

 The officer-in-charge of Ranibandh police station in Bankura, Sanjoy Chakraborty, was tipped off about the explosive devices.

 A team led by the Bankura superintendent of police, Anil Kumar, scoured the area last evening with the aid of ?sources? and dug out four landmines from the road near Fuljhor village.

 ?We found four explosive devices planted within 50 metres of each other on the road. We are awaiting their examination by experts from Calcutta,? Kumar said. 

 In Calcutta, inspector-general (law and order) Chayan Mukherjee said: ?We suspect that the landmines were laid by activists of the People?s War or the MCC (Maoist Communist Centre). They were freshly planted and would have exploded at the slightest pressure.?

 The find resulted in stepped up security arrangements for Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s trip to inaugurate a two-day state conference of the West Bengal Biri Workers? Union in Jhalda town, about 290 km west of Calcutta.

 He is scheduled to arrive in Durgapur by train and then travel about 100 km by road through Bankura and Purulia town to Jhalda. Policemen will line the route and will be posted at intersections, culverts and bridges to prevent an ambush.

 ?About 4,000 state police personnel, Eastern Frontier Rifles jawans and intelligence branch officers will be deployed,? said a senior intelligence official. ?In addition, three companies of BSF jawans and two platoons of CRPF personnel will patrol the area. The borders adjoining Bokaro, Hazaribagh and Ranchi districts in Jharkhand have been sealed.?

 In November 2002, MCC rebels beheaded a landlord at Bansgarh in Jhalda-I block, and looted his property. Mines exploded there soon after, compelling the administration to seek the help of central forces. A company of BSF jawans is still posted there.

 A measure of the threat perception this time can be had from the fact that director-general of police Shyamal Dutta is likely to accompany the chief minister during the trip. 

 Three inspectors-general and three deputy inspectors-general will be in the district from tomorrow to oversee the arrangements.

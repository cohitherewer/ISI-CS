 Landmark deal for puja power

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Sept. 27: PTC India, formerly Power Trading Corporation of India, has entered into an agreement with CESC to supply power for 12 hours every day. 

 Supply to CESC under the agreement started yesterday. Even during Durga puja next month, PTC will supply 50 mw from 11 am to 11 pm. 

 Yesterday, it supplied power bought from Tripura.

 It is learnt that CESC is concerned about the peak-period supply this month and in October. Though the utility?s own plants often operate at 94-95 per cent capacity during the peak period, shortage is common. The tie-up is aimed at overcoming such shortage. 

 CESC supplies power to 12 million people across the city. Generally, it requires 1,100 mw during the peak period, but demand shoots up during the pujas. After October, the RPG power utility may review the situation and renew the contract with PTC.

 The price at which CESC will buy the power has not been decided yet. 

 The deal is a first of its kind in India, where a trading company is supplying power directly to an embedded customer of a state power system.

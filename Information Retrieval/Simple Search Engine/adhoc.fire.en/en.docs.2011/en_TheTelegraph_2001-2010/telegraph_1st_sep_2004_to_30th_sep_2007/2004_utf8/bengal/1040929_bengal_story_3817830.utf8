 Birla-style battle, 28 years on

 TAPAS GHOSH

 Calcutta, Sept. 28: There is no telling when and how the case over the will left behind by Priyamvada Birla bequeathing her assets to R.S. Lodha, an outsider to the Birla family, will end. But a similar case is pending in the high court since 1976.

 That year, the estate manager of Shyamasundari Das, a rich widow from the city, sought to execute the probate of the will that his employer had drawn up two years before her death in 1973.

 Das left behind landed property and buildings which in 1980 were valued at Rs 2 crore. The will had given liberty to estate manager Harendranath Das to execute the probate of the will after her death and wrest control over her riches.

 In so doing, she had overlooked the rights of her sons and daughters-in-law. When Harendranath sought to execute the will, the family members contested it. The case has now dragged on for 28 years.

 In 1983, the late Justice Padma Khastagir had awarded Shyamasundari?s son Pashupati the right to take possession of the property. Harendranath had filed an appeal against the order the same year. The hearing of this appeal resumed on Tuesday before the division bench of Justices Dilip Seth and P.. Sinha. In between, an interim order had appointed a special officer to look after the disputed properties.

 Shyamasundari?s husband, the late Nanda Dulal Das, was the resident and landlord of a huge property in Dharmatala in Calcutta. After his death in 1965, his widow became the owner of this and other properties in the city, as well as a 5-bigha plot in Tarapith.

 In 1973, Shyamasundari drew up a will that bequeathed the property, which also included three buildings in Behala and Turf Road and 47 kathas on Diamond Harbour Road, to Das. A small part of the property was also given to Menaka Das, Shyamasundari?s sister-in-law (younger brother?s wife). She gave nothing to her elder son Kanai?s widow and her younger son Pashupati. 

 After her death, Harendranath and Menaka moved court demanding execution of the will?s probate. Pashupati challenged it. The widow of Shyamasundari?s elder son has died. As she had no heirs, younger son Pashupati and his family are now claimants to the property.

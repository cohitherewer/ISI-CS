 Coal blow to hill train

 VIVEK CHHETRI

Darjeeling, Oct. 9: The Darjeeling Himalayan 

Railway has come to a halt because of insufficient coal supplies.

 The railway has been accorded world heritage status because of its steam locomotives ? its lure for domestic and foreign tourists.

 The special trains that take tourists for a 14-km ride through Batasia Loop till Ghoom are pulled by steam engines, of which there are 12. The two diesel engines are used only for the trains plying between Darjeeling and Siliguri.

 However, a shortage of coal following the recent floods has put a dampener on the joyride.?The joyride could not be undertaken during the day because of a shortage of coal, which is supplied from Asansol,? said T. Bhattacharya, the railways? public relations officer.

 Authorities in Darjeeling believe that ?it could take at least 10 days? for the trains to resume their journeys.

 The railway requires around 70 tonnes of coal every month and .. Pradhan, the section engineer of the Darjeeling locomotive, maintained that they had not received the coal supply since September. ?We hope that we will receive it soon,? said the railway engineer.

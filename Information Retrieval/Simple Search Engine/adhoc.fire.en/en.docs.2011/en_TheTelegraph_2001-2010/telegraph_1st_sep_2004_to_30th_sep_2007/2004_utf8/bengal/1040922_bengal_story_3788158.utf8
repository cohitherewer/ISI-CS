 HC hears dead girl dad

 Calcutta, Sept. 21: A writ 

 petition by Trilochan Maity, whose 12-year-old daughter 

 Putul was allegedly raped and murdered 17 years ago at Tamluk 

 in East Midnapore, came up for hearing today before a division 

 bench of Justices A. Talukdar and P.K. Deb.

 Goutam Biswas, the accused, was sentenced to a life term by a lower court but secured bail after seven days behind bars. The father wrote to the high court chief justice after Dhananjoy Chatterjee was hanged for a similar crime in Calcutta. The letter has been treated as a writ petition.

 Trilochan?s counsel Subroto Mukherjee said Biswas is moving about freely since securing the bail from the high court in 1990. ?Mysteriously, his appeal challenging the trial court order was not heard by the high court in 14 years,? Mukherjee said, pleading that the bail be cancelled immediately.

 March date for school lunch 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

Calcutta, Sept. 5: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has set March 31, 2005, as the deadline for all state-aided primary schools to provide a cooked meal of rice, dal and vegetables to students to check the dropout rate. 

 The move follows a Supreme Court direction to all states to provide mid-day meal to every primary student. 

 Now, each primary student in Bengal receives three kg of uncooked rice every month. 

 We need to build proper infrastructure before we implement the mid-day meal scheme in each school. A huge exercise is on so that the schools are able to provide cooked food to students within March 31, 2005, school education minister Kanti Biswas said. 

 According to officials, the government has so far introduced the scheme in only 6,000 of the 62,000 primary schools involving 1.10 crore students. 

 Studies show the mid-day meal system has worked very well in Egypt in bringing children and dropouts within the ambit of primary education, said Jyotiprakash Ghosh, the president of the West Bengal Board of Primary Education. 

 Biswas said talks are on with the finance department for funds. Finance officials said the government has already released a sizeable amount of money for setting up cooking infrastructure in the schools. This apart, the government has decided to spend Re 1 per day per student to provide vegetables and dal everyday. 

 The uncooked rice will be supplied by the Centre as earlier. The state government will have to spend Rs 33 crore every month on the meal scheme.

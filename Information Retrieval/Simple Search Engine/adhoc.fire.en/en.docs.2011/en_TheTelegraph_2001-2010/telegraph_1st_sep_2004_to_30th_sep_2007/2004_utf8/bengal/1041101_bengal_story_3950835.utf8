 Duley and Dipankar brought back

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Duley

 Calcutta, Oct. 31: Footballers Sasthi Duley and Dipankar Roy, who were in Delhi where East Bengal will play the Durand Cup, were flown back by the club tonight under instructions from police. 

 The duo took the same flight to the city as state CPM secretary Anil Biswas, who is likely to oversee a CPM probe into leaders? links with criminals.

 A senior officer said Duley, from 

 whose house in Haripal, Hooghly, Hatkata Dilip was 

 arrested on Friday, will be questioned. Roy had allegedly 

 brought Dilip to Duley?s house. 

 The police?s biggest catch of late, Dilip was interrogated for over three hours today. 

 Deputy inspector-general, Presidency range, Sanjay Chander and North 24-Parganas superintendent Praveen Kumar questioned the once-dreaded criminal, who reportedly recounted his rise as a gangster, falling out with mentor Pinaki Mitra over sharing of booty and flight to Bangladesh.

 Dilip apparently told the police that when he was in Dum Dum Central Jail in 2003, he got to know an inmate from Chittagong who sheltered him during his stay in Bangladesh. 

 He also said that he knew Duley?s brother through a common friend and that is how he landed at their home.

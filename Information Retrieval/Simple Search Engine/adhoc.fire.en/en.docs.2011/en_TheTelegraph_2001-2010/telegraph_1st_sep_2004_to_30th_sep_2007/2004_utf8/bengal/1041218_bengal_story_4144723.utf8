 Calcutta, Dec. 17: An ambulance 

 of the Border Security Force tore through a Sealdah station 

 gate tonight and entered the premises, killing a woman and 

 injuring four.

 The ambulance was empty. The officer on duty at the government railway police station said: ?Around 10 pm, the BSF ambulance broke open a shutter and came inside the station.?

 The injured were taken to NRS Medical College and Hospital, where the woman died. 

 Bystanders, who saw the vehicle ramming in at high speed, said the driver was drunk. The police said he is absconding. 

 R.K. Singh, a BSF deputy commandant, said the accident could also be the result of a mechanical fault in the vehicle.

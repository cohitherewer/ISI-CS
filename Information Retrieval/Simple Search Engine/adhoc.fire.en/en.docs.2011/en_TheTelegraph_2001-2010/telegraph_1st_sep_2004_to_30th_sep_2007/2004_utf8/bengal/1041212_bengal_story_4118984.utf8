 Setu murder suspects arrested

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Howrah, Dec. 11: Police made a breakthrough in the November 23 murder of businessman Sekhar Roy by arresting the two accused today.

 Prime accused Birbal Jaiswal was arrested from Dhanbad while Satyam was picked from a Shibpur hideout this morning. 

 Roy was shot dead by five people on Vidyasagar Setu last month while on his way to deposit Rs 4 lakh at a nationalised bank in the city ? this was the fifth attempt on his life.

 ?After a series of raids and interrogation of suspects we pieced together the jigsaw puzzle and rounded up the duo who had pulled the trigger on Roy,? said Mihir Kumar Bhattacharya, the Howrah superintendent of police. 

 ?We have got the names of three more persons who were involved in the attack on Roy. They will also be arrested soon,? he added.

 An officer working on the case said the raiding team recovered Rs 90,000 from the Dhanbad hideout. 

 Birbal, a Liluah resident, apparently pulled the trigger killing Roy on the spot. A senior police officer said: ?He confessed during interrogation that he shot Roy from close range after he tried to resist the duo.?

 Wife-killer jailed

 A fast-track court in Howrah yesterday sentenced Sanjib Nath, 29, to life imprisonment for killing his wife Sampa Nath, 27, two years ago. 

 Sampa was burnt to death at her in-laws? residence at Argori, Sankrail. The defence said Sanjib had been torturing his wife for money for 10 years and had even threatened her with death if she sought help from outsiders.

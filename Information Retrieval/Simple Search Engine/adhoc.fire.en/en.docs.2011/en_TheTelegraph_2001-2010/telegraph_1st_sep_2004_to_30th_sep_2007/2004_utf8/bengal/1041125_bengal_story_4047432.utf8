 Govt in medical quota fix

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Nov. 24: After the MBBS admission fiasco following a Supreme Court order to dereserve a large chunk of seats from NRI quota, the government is in a fix over another apex court order ? over admission to post-graduate medical courses.

 The court order says postgraduate (PG) seats available in the state should be distributed equally among candidates coming through tests conducted by the state and the Centre. That is, if 50 per cent of the seats are allotted to students clearing the entrance exam taken by the state, the remaining should go to those qualifying in the national-level tests. 

 The apex court order came last year following a petition by a student demanding equal distribution of seats.

 Officials said nearly a year after the apex court order, the state government has not received any information from the Centre on the revision of the ratio for distribution of PG medical seats. 

 It is important for the government to know the Centre?s stand soon because the entrance tests for the 2005-2006 session will have to be conducted within two months. ?It will be difficult to counsel students minus a clear idea of the seat distribution,? an official said.

 Nearly 475 seats are available in the state?s PG courses. Till last year, 75 per cent of the seats were filled by those clearing the state-level tests.

 Concerned over the Centre?s silence, health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra and senior officials of his department today held a meeting, which decided to go ahead withthe entrance tests. ?We need the Centre?s notification on the distribution of seats in the light of the Supreme Court order. But we have decided not to delay our entrance examination,? said director of medical education C.R. Maity, who attended the meeting. The admission tests would be held in January. 

 ?When we announce the dates, we will make it clear to the examinees that the information regarding number of seats available will be provided to them after we receive the central notification,? sources in the health department said. 

 The fate of 75 out of 105 students who secured admission in SSKM and Midnapore medical colleges under NRI quota after agreeing to pay enhanced fees is still hanging in the balance. The Supreme Court said last month only 15 per cent of the students could be admitted under the quota in the two institutions.

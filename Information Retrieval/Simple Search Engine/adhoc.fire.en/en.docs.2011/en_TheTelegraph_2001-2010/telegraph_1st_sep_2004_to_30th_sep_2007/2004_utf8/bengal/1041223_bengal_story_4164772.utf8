 70-yr-old stabs wife, hangs self

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Krishnagar, Dec. 22: A retired railway employee stabbed his wife and daughter and committed suicide last night. He was depressed since his sons left home and blamed his wife for the development. 

 Seventy-year-old Amit Saha?s wife Bijaylakshmi and daughter, Anita, were admitted this morning to Shaktinagar district hospital, where their condition was said to be critical. Saha hanged himself in his house at Krishnagar. 

 Police said the first shock came when Saha?s younger son Anupam shifted to Calcutta in October. Abhijeet, the elder sibling, followed suit three days ago, after a heated exchange between his wife and Bijaylakshmi, 60. 

 Additional superintendent of police Biswarup Ghosh said Bijaylakshmi was a psychiatric patient and was often rude to her daughters-in-law. Anita, a 29-year-old spinster, took her mother?s side. 

 The daughters-in-law wanted Bijaylakshmi to be shifted to an asylum, but Saha was reluctant. After his sons left, Saha started blaming his wife for the crack in his family. 

 Last night, there was an altercation between the couple. Saha lost his cool and beat up his wife and daughter. He also stabbed them repeatedly. After they fell unconscious, he hanged himself. 

 In the morning, the domestic help alerted the neighbours after her knocks failed to elicit a response. They broke open the door, took the bleeding women to hospital and called the police.

 Polite sermon to police 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Kalna, Dec. 30: State police chief Shyamal Dutta today warned personnel manning police stations against misbehaving with people who come in for help. 

 ?We will not tolerate rude behaviour by our men in police stations. We have received a lot of complaints. Stern action will be taken against those found guilty. It is our duty to behave politely with those who come to lodge complaints,? Dutta said while inaugurating the new building of Kalna police station in Burdwan district. 

 He pointed out that it is the duty of the officers-in-charge to ensure proper conduct. ?In police training schools, we are now emphasising on politeness and good behaviour and all sub-inspectors are being trained,? he said. 

 Officials said complaints of rude behaviour in police stations had been pouring in from several sources, including the Trinamul Congress, which has also said that officials often do not want to register complaints if they are not coming from the CPM. 

 Dutta said all such complaints would be scrutinised and probed. ?We will inquire into each and every allegation of rudeness and misbehaviour and take stern action against those found guilty.?

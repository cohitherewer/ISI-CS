 SFI kicks off purge 

 Calcutta, Oct 13: The SFI, 

 the CPM?s students? wing, has begun a purge of corrupt elements, 

 says a staff reporter. 

 The SFI today unveiled a 25-point guideline for its units in colleges and universities across Bengal and asked them to adhere to it strictly. It directed student leaders to be ?transparent while handling students? union funds?.

 ?We have despatched the guideline to all our units and asked them to submit the accounts of all students unions under their control by October 19,? said Sudip Sengupta, SFI state president. 

 In a joint news conference, Sengupta and state SFI secretary Apurba Chatterjee warned they will initiate disciplinary action against those found guilty of financial irregularities. 

 Sources said the move follows several complaints against SFI functionaries, the most recent being the suspension of some for misbehaving with a student in the Hooghly Institute of Technology.

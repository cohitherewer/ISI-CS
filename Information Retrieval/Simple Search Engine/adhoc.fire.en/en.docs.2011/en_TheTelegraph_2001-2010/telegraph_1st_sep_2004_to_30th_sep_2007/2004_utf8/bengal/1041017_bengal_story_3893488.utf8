 Rat-bite body 

 Calcutta, Oct. 16: A man aged about 35 was found dead in a building on BB Ganguly Street this morning. 

 Rats had nibbled on the body that lay on the staircase of 257 BB Ganguly Street with a nylon rope round his neck. 

 A Bowbazar police station officer said: ?The gates of the apartment close by 11 pm and those around said they had not seen any outsider nearby at that time. Around 4 am, the gates were reopened. Maybe the body was dumped then.?

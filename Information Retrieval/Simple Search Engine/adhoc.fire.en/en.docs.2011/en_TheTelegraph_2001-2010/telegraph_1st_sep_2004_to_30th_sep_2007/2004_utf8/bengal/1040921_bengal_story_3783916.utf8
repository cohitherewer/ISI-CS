 ?Friend? diced and passed off as foodgrain for flood relief

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Sept. 20: Prabhas 

 Mondal beheaded his one-time friend, chopped his limbs, 

 packed the pieces into an iron trunk and took it by train 

 to his flood-hit uncle as relief material last evening.

 Suren Biswas, a farmer whose 12 bighas are under water, received a windfall when his nephew came with ?foodgrain and cooking oil?.

 Prabhas had a request for his uncle in Taherpur in Nadia, 70 km from Calcutta, before he left with the promise to return soon ? not to open the trunk till he came back. But Biswas smelt something foul and saw blood oozing out of it last night.

 Police today said the body, which was difficult to recognise, is that of Saumitra Mondal, 30, a resident of Ranabandh in Chapra, 130 km from Calcutta. 

 Additional superintendent of police Biswarup Ghosh said Saumitra was probably killed a few days ago. Prabhas was arrested today. 

 ?Saumitra was beheaded first. Then his limbs were severed,? Ghosh said, adding that Prabhas has a criminal past. 

 In Taherpur, 50 km from hometown Chapra, Prabhas hired a rickshaw van because the trunk was too heavy.

 Paritosh Sarkar, a bank employee neighbour, said Suren became suspicious when a foul smell began to emanate from the trunk. ?Then he saw the blood. He rushed to us and told us what had happened. His wife was scared.? 

 Some of the neighbours called the police late last night. Four locks had to be broken to prise open the trunk with the mutilated body that had begun to decompose. ?Some of Biswas? neighbours fainted at the sight,? said a police officer. 

 When Prabhas returned to his uncle this morning, he was beaten up by the neighbours before the police could intervene. When a large contingent from Ranaghat police station rescued Prabhas, he was tied to a tree. 

 According to the police, Saumitra was killed because he objected to Prabhas? relationship with his wife Anjali.

 Ghosh said: ?They were both from Ranabandh and friends. Saumitra came to know that Prabhas was infatuated with his wife. At one point, Prabhas had also tried to abduct her. Saumitra had tried to avenge that.?

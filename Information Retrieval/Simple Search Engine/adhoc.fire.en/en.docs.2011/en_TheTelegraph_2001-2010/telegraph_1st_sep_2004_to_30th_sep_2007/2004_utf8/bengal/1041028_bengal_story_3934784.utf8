 Bangla bullets fly into India 

 AVIJIT SINHA

 Jalpaiguri, Oct. 27: Shock 

 waves swept Karjipara and Joypur early yesterday as a hail 

 of Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) bullets ripped through the hamlets, 

 peppering the roofs of houses and embedding themselves in 

 the walls. 

 The Border Security Force (BSF) and the administration branded the ?sudden firing? a ?BDR manoeuvre to reassert its presence across the border?, but rumours had it that the offensive was the result of a ?BSF pushback gone wrong?.

 District intelligence officials who visited the site near Jalpaiguri?s Tiapara border outpost said their investigations seem to lend credence to the rumours. 

 Sources said eight Bangladeshis, caught trying to enter India illegally, were slated to be pushed back ?as per instructions from Delhi?.

 ?The task was assigned to 33 Battalion of the BSF posted at Sakati, a few kilometres from Tiapara. The pushback, which began around 4.30 am yesterday, suffered a setback when residents of Chilapara and Ghagra on the other side of the border raised alarm,? the source said. ?Alerted by the commotion, the BDR jawans opened fire.?

 Unconfirmed reports said more than 100 rounds were fired. The BSF did not retaliate.

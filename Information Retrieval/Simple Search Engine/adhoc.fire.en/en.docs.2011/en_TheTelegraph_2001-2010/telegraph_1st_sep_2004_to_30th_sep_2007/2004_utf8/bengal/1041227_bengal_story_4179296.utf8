 Study shows wetlands shrinking 

 SIMI KAMBOJ

 Calcutta, Dec. 26: The government?s failure to frame a management plan for the East Calcutta Wetlands in the past decade has cost the Ramsar site dear.

 Officials today said water bodies within the perimeter of the 12,500-hectare wetlands had shrunk from over 6,100 hectares in 1992 to less than 5,850 hectares in 2003. This means, about 271 hectares of water bodies were filled up illegally.

 The fact came to light after the environment department prepared a detailed land schedule with the help of satellite images in August this year. Comparison of the mauja map against satellite images of the wetlands showed the changes that have taken place in water bodies, settlements and agricultural land. 

 Of the existing 5,850-hectare water body, only 4,400 hectares is ?active wetland?. The rest is degraded and silted.

 About 250 hectares has been turned into agricultural land and the rest into residential plots. Environment department estimates suggest that about 3,000 plots on about 2 bighas were created in the area.

 Nayabandh, Ranabhutia and Aathghara in the vicinity of Santoshpur and New Garia on the southern fringes of the city are now residential areas.

 Agricultural land has been carved out of wetlands at Tardaha and Tardaha-Kapashati, which lay in canals that fed the Vidyadhari river but are now silted. ?The canal is now being used as agricultural land,? said an official.

 The wetlands now form a Ramsar site and are protected by law from any form of encroachment. 

 Asked about the illegal conversion, Union environment secretary Prodipto Ghosh said: ?We will have to study the report carefully and have it evaluated by experts. Only then we will think of taking remedial measures.?

 State environment secretary Asim Burman said the government would encourage conversion of agricultural land back to wetlands. ?We have mentioned this in the wetlands management plan submitted to the Union ministry last week. It states that areas of settlement inside the wetlands should be frozen according to the satellite images of January 2003,? Burman added. 

 In June, the Union environment ministry had asked for a report on the status of East Calcutta Wetlands.

 Probe into thieves of food for the poor 

 SOUMI BHATTACHARYA 

 Kaleswar, Nov. 20: After battling hunger for two years, 10 families below the poverty line summoned courage to let the authorities in Birbhum know that they have not been getting the foodgrain promised to them.

 That blew the lid off another racket in which food for the poorest of poor was being robbed, possibly in connivance with a section of officials. 

 Under the Antyoday Yojna, a central poverty alleviation scheme, each villager below the poverty line is entitled to 1.75 kg of foodgrain every week at the rate of Rs 3 for a kg of rice and Rs 2 for a kg of wheat. 

 Baikuntha Mal of Kaleswar, 280 km from Calcutta, was one of those entitled to the scheme. He said: ?Two years ago, our names were selected. We were looking forward to getting the rice and wheat?We are still looking forward?? 

 The Mals and nine other families lodged the complaint after coming to know about claims of the ration dealer that it was being distributed according to norms.

 Over the past two years, the foodgrain for 10 families likely to have been diverted is about 2,000 kg. The district administration yesterday ordered a probe into the allegations of diversion of foodgrain by a section of ration dealers. District magistrate Barun Roy said the block development officer would probe the stocks and accounts of all dealers and look for anomalies. ?We will cancel the licence of the ration dealers found guilty,? he added. 

 In Burdwan, residents of Ausgram and Galsi have already protested against irregularities in the distribution of foodgrain for midday meals under the central scheme. They attacked CPM leaders who were allegedly in league with the ration dealers there. 

 The detection of irregularity in Kaleswar may open a Pandora?s box. 

 The villagers said in their complaint ration dealer Sushil Mondal claimed he had distributed the rice properly. 

 Roy promised ?stern action? against Mondal. ?We will lodge an FIR against him.?

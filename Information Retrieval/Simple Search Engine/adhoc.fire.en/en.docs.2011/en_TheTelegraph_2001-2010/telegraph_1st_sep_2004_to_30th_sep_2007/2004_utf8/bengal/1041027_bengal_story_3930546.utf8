 Scanner on judge shift 

 Calcutta, Oct. 26: The Trinamul Congress today held the CPM responsible for the transfer of Calcutta High Court judge Amitava Lala, who had imposed restrictions on workday rallies in the city. 

 Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly Pankaj Banerjee said: ?The CPM has influenced the Centre to get judges like Lala transferred.?

 He added: ?Judges like Lala had dared to establish the rule of law ignoring the CPM?s diktat.? 

 State CPM secretary Anil Biswas reacted to Banerjee?s allegations saying Lala?s transfer to Allahabad High Court was ?routine? and according to the service conditions.

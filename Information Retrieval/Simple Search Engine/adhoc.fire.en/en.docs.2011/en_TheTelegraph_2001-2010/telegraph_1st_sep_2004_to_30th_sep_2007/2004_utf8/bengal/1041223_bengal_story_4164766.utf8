 Freak death

 Calcutta, Dec. 22: Fuchia, 25, was killed when what seemed like a prank to his co-workers went horribly wrong in a rubber factory in Tiljala tonight. His friends stuck the tube of an air pump in his anus and began operating it. After a while, he collapsed and was rushed to hospital, where he was declared brought dead. Three persons have been arrested.

 Bolpur protests Express extension

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Santiniketan, Oct. 2: The Santiniketan Express? maiden run to Prantik station came a cropper today with residents of Bolpur and its adjoining areas staging a demonstration since noon at the Bolpur station against the extension.

 Teachers, non-teaching staff and students of Visva-Bharati joined in the rail blockade, which was lifted at 7.15 pm.

 The protesters said the terminus of the Santiniketan Express cannot be shifted from Bolpur, from where Rabindranath Tagore had set off on his last train journey in 1941.

 ?It is the wish of the people of Bolpur not to allow the train to be extended till Prantik. I will not allow it,? said Milan Kumar Singha, the chairman of Bolpur municipality. 

 ?This is about protecting the heritage of the station. If the train is allowed to terminate at Prantik, it will loose the relevance of its name,? said Sushovan Banerjee, a social worker of Bolpur.

 The blockade hit railway services in the Burdwan-Bolpur and Rampurhat-Bolpur sections since noon. Several mail and express trains were stranded midway because of the blockade.

 The Trivandrum-Guwahati Express, Kanchenjunga Express, Howrah-Mokama Passenger and the Howrah-Rampurhat Inter-City Express were stranded, as were the Down Kanchenjunga Express, Rampurhat-Burdwan passenger, Barharwa-Howrah Passenger and Rampurhat-Howrah Ganadebata Express.

 Members of the Birbhum Rail Jatri Samity, Bolpur Bayabsayee Samity and the Bolpur Bar Association prevailed upon railway authorities at Howrah to defer till October 7 the extension of train.

 ?We have offered to discuss the problem,? said a railway spokesperson, adding status quo would be maintained till October 7.

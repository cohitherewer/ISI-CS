 Bengal starved of IAS babus

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Nov. 1: With officers retiring every year and very few making it in their place, the Bengal cadre of the IAS is staring at a crisis. 

 The cadre is now 23 short of the sanctioned strength of 206 officers recruited through the IAS entrance examination. With four officers scheduled to retire by the year-end, the tally will go down to 179. 

 Apprehensive that the situation might affect the quality of administration, especially in the districts, chief secretary Asok Gupta wrote to the Union cabinet secretary last month asking the Centre to step up recruitment of IAS officers.

 ?Till the early 90s, the Centre recruited about 120 to 140 IAS officers annually, of which Bengal was allotted eight to 10. In 2003, the Centre recruited 52 IAS officers and 85 the next year. Bengal was allotted two and five officers respectively,? said Dilip Chakraborty, secretary, personnel and administrative reforms. 

 Gupta wrote: ?The situation has worsened with several foreign-aided projects in progress across the state. Donors demand direct-recruit officers as project officers and project managers.?

 A section of senior WBCS officers are offered IAS rank, but officials said the ?direct recruits? have an edge in dealing with foreign sponsors as they are fluent in English, have wider exposure and are young.

 The British Department for International Development and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation had reportedly insisted that IAS officers be placed at the helm of projects funded by them.

 Mamata shuns Bengal lobby

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Sept. 29: Members of Parliament from all mainline parties in the state, barring the Trinamul Congress, came together today to evolve a strategy for the state?s overall development by lobbying with the Centre to clear pending projects. 

 Mamata Banerjee and her Rajya Sabha counterpart, Dinesh Trivedi, were missing from the meeting at Writers? Buildings convened by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. 

 ?This is high time that we work together for the interest of Bengal irrespective of our political ideologies. In Delhi, almost every state has its own lobby. But Bengal does not have such a lobby in the capital so far. We must take the opportunity when a friendly government is installed at the Centre,? Jayanta Bhattacharjee, a Congress-backed Independent in the Upper House said after attending the two-hour meeting. 

 Nilotpal Bose, CPM MP in the Rajya Sabha, echoed Bhattacharjee. ?Today is a historic day. MPs from all political parties have responded positively to the chief minister?s call for working together for the benefit of Bengal. The chief minister has specified our jobs and we shall follow it up in Delhi accordingly,? Bose said. 

 Three Congress MPs, Adhir Chowdhury, Jayanta Bhattacharjee and Mannan Hossain, were critical of the Left Front government?s failure to give utilisation certificates against different central projects, saying it often stood in the way of getting fresh grants. 

 The chief minister assured steps would be taken to submit the certificates on time.

 Bangla bar on Durga puja in border villages

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Balurghat, Sept. 14: Days 

 before talks begin between the home secretaries of India 

 and Bangladesh with security concerns in focus, a shadow 

 was cast on Durga puja near the border with the Bangladesh 

 Rifles (BDR) objecting to pandals within 150 metres of the 

 frontier at Hili.

 Around 75 per cent of Hili town was given away to East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) after Partition. The rest remained in India. 

 Because of the peculiar nature of the border, the standard 150-m no-man?s land rule has never been applied at this outpost with the consent of both countries. Buildings and markets exist on both sides of the Zero Line, with the Hili station inching into Bangladeshi territory.

 Sources said the BDR?s objection to pandals in what is, at least in theory, the buffer zone follows the Border Security Force?s (BSF) protest against the construction of an embankment on the Atreyee at Samjia by the Bangladeshi force. 

 The 11th Battalion of the BSF had sent a report to the Union home ministry last month on how the BDR had been inching into Indian territory at Samjia, 32 km from here in the Kumarganj police station area, till the BSF challenged it on July 28. The standoff between the BDR and the BSF had forced residents of border villages to flee their homes fearing an exchange of fire.

 Around 12 pujas are organised on the Indian side of the town every year, including eight within 150 metres of the border. But objections were never raised earlier.

 Hili Biplabi Sangha is one of the affected puja organisers. The BDR conveyed its displeasure to the club through the BSF on Saturday. Now, along with the club members, the decorator who had been hired for the job is in a fix.

 ?Ours is a big-budget affair. People from remote areas and other districts like Malda and North Dinajpur visit our pandal,? said Ganesh Saha, the secretary of the club, which has been organising pujas for more than 50 years.

 Deputy inspector-general of police, Malda range, Nanda Kumar Biswas said: ?We have received the information. I have asked the district superintendent of police to submit a report.?

 BSF commanding officer Ram Narayan Ram said the matter would be taken up with the BDR and a report submitted to higher authorities.

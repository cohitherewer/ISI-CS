 Woman flees dowry dungeon

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Oct. 2: All her ties with the external world had been snapped. The only ray of light and hope came from a little window in a closet-like, tin-shed room, where her in-laws kept her confined for six months. 

 Twenty-four-year-old Tanushree Sen lived ? barely, on half-a-plate of rice every day ? through hell because she would not press her father for money. 

 The nightmare ended when she fled and lodged a complaint with Chetla police station. Yesterday, police raided the house and arrested Tanushree?s husband and three others. 

 Tanushree?s ordeal began when she came to live in her in-laws? house on Alipore Road in May last year after marrying Manoj Sen, a cloth merchant. ?The trouble started six months into the marriage when she was asked to bring money from her father,? said Anuj Sharma, deputy commissioner of police, south division. 

 Tanushree turned down their demands, saying her father cannot afford it. 

 Gradually, the pressure increased. ?Tanushree alleged that first, her in-laws had tortured her physically and mentally. They then forcibly locked her in the small, tin-shed room on the premises of her in-laws? house on Alipore Road. We gathered during the course of our interrogation that this was a store room,? said an official of Chetla police station. 

 According to investigators, Tanushree was not allowed to open the window. ?She was only allowed to come out to wash the family?s clothes or utensils. Her work done, she would be asked to get back to the dungeon,? said the official. ?But she never complained to her father, fearing it would lead to some other problem.? 

 Fortune favoured her on September 29. ?She found the door unlocked and fled. She came straight to the police station and lodged the complaint against her husband and in-laws. Then she went to her father?s house in Dum Dum,? said the official. 

 After investigations, police swung into action on Friday. Tanushree?s husband Manoj, brother-in-law Nirmal, father-in-law Gopal and mother-in-law Parul were arrested.

 Citu opposes VRS ceasework at Yule

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Krishnagar, Dec. 7: About 100 non-executive officers of a non-political staff association have declared a ceasework at Phoenix-Yule, a steel-cord belt manufacturer at Kalyani, in protest against the company?s decision to offer 17 of them a golden handshake. 

 They persuaded the 400 workers to join them and brought production to a halt today at the factory in Nadia, 55 km from Calcutta. As the agitating workers include accounting officers, salaries could not be disbursed today. 

 For a change, the Citu, the CPM?s labour arm, has opposed the agitation ?at a time when the company is earning good profit?. The workers belong to a Citu-led union. 

 ?The factory is doing very well and making profits. Hundreds of local people work there. So why should we take the side of some employees and create unnecessary complication?? said Subodh Ganguly, general secretary of the workers? union and a prominent Citu leader of Nadia. 

 He, however, declined comment when asked whether the union leadership would intervene and call the members back to work. 

 Jayanta Mukherjee, general manager of human resource development, said the management had informed the labour department about their decision to bring 17 employees under the voluntary retirement scheme. 

 ?The state labour department, after an inquiry, approved of our decision to give VRS to the 17 employees. Five days ago we informed them of our decision,? he said. 

 ?We will continue with our indefinite ceasework until the management withdraws the VRS notices on the 17 employees,? said Dhananjoy Roy, president of the non-executive officers? staff association.

 The Phoenix-Yule is a joint venture of Phoenix of Germany and central public sector undertaking Andrew Yule.

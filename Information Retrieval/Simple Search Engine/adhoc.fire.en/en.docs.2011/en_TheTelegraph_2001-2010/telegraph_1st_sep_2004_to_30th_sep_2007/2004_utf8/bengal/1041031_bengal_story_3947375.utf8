 Kiosk murder

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Calcutta, Oct. 30: Residents in Bally today found the body of a phone booth owner lying in a pool of blood inside his kiosk. 

 Fifty-year-old Mohan Chamaria?s throat had been slit and he was left to die in the booth at Bajrangbali market. 

 Police have learnt a middle-aged man, identified as Feroze Ahmed, was seen leaving the booth around 11.30 pm after pulling the shutters down. ?We have a strong suspicion Ahmed is the killer because he is absconding... We will trace him as early as possible,? a police official said. 

 Inquiries revealed Ahmed was once a tenant in Chamaria?s house on GT Road. They used to have regular quarrels over rent and Chamaria had thrown Ahmed out two years ago.

 Lifers get new life in HC 

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 15: The high court today acquitted four youths who had been slapped life terms by a trial court for raping and murdering a 14-year-old girl in Howrah.

 ?The process of investigation was faulty and the rape was not proved in the post-mortem,? said the division bench of Justices .A. Chowdhury and S.P. Mitra.

 According to the case diary, Raju Khamaria of Chamaria village in Liluah, Howrah, about 25 km from Calcutta, had an affair with Sumita Santra, 14, who worked in a local rope-making factory.

 Sumita?s mother was against the affair and had warned her against the relationship. The girl had apparently begun avoiding Raju.

 On the night of June 22, 1997, Raju and his friends ? Srimanta Dhara, Chandi Charan Das and Bablu Pramanik ? asked Sumita out of her house. She was allegedly abducted, raped and killed. Her body was found in a nearby lake.

 On January 30, 1999, the Howrah sessions judge convicted them for the rape and murder. The friends were in jail since then.

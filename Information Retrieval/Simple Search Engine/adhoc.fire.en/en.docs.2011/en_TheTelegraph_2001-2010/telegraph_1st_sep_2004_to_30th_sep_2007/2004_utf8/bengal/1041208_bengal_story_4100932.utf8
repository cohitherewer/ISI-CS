 Bandh ban hearing put off

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 7: Calcutta High Court today agreed to the state advocate-general?s request to postpone the hearing of the bandh ban case till January 25 and ?defuse? tension over the matter. 

 The substantial part of the hearing on the SUCI and the Trinamul Congress flouting court orders on calling the bandh off will take place then. The court has sought a clarification next Tuesday over Trinamul?s organisational structure. 

 Trinamul repeatedly refused to accept the court?s summons saying it does not have a chairman/secretary ? the summons were addressed to them.

 A division bench of Justices Pratap Ray and Jyotirmoy Bhattacharya today directed Bengal?s chief electoral officer to present before it next Tuesday the party?s organisational structure.

 Advocate-general Balai Ray today urged the court to take a more lenient view of the violation of the bandh ban order. ?The three consecutive bandhs in the state are over and the case relating to the bandhs has created excitement both inside and outside the court. As a liaison agent between the judiciary and the administration, I think it is now time for the court to defuse the matter,? Ray said. 

 He also asked that the SUCI and Trinamul?s violation of the court orders be heard together at a later date. The court, which was conducting hearings on the matter quickly, relented and set the next date of hearing for January 25. Ray then submitted a compliance report before the court listing the steps the government took to foil last week?s Citu-organised chakka jam and the Trinamul bandh. 

 The court did not proceed further as Trinamul, the main respondent, has not been served the court order.

 Sreemoyee Mitra, an advocate assisting petitioner Idris Ali, wanted contempt proceedings to be started against Jyoti Basu, the CPM?s Anil Biswas and Mamata Banerjee for ?openly defying the court?s verdict relating to bandhs?.

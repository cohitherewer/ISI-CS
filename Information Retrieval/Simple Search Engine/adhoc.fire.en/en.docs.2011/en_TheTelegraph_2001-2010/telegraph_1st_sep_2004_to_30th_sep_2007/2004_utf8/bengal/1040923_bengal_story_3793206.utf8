 Calcutta, Sept. 22: The state government will formally start handing over allotted plots in Rajarhat New Town from September 25. 

 Housing Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (Hidco) officials today said this is the first time a large number of plots is going to be handed over to those who have purchased land in this area either individually or through cooperative societies. 

 ?Individuals who get their land on September 25 will be able to start construction immediately, as Hidco has taken care of the fact that infrastructure in the entire area has been developed fully,? said transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury, who is also the managing director of Hidco. 

 Altogether 5,599 plots have been allotted so far under various categories in action area I and part of action area II. Of this, 437 plots are ready to be handed over right now. The area lies around the entry point to Rajarhat township. 

 Around 55 per cent of the total plots are meant for the lower income groups (LIG) and middle income groups (MIG). 

 Finance minister Asim Dasgupta will inaugurate the handover programme opposite the site office of Hidco at New Town on September 25. Land and land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah and minister for housing and public health engineering Gautam Deb would be present.

 A Hidco official said that in January 2003, they had handed over a large number of flats in the Balaka complex to economically weak families. Now, with 437 more plots to be handed over, there would be a spurt of activity in this area.

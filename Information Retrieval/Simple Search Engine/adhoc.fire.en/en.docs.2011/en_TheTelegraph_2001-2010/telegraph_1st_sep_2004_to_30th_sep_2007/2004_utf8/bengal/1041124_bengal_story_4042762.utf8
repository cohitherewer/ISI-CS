 Pollution panel levy on civic water

 OUR BUREAU

 Nov. 23: The state pollution control board has sent notices to 121 municipalities and corporations across the state demanding payment for water used during 2002-2003.

 Confirming that they had received the notice, several civic bodies expressed surprise because the board had never charged water cess from municipalities and corporations.

 The amount was fixed according to the population of the municipalities and the cess was charged under provisions of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977.

 Senior law officer of the board, Biswajit Mukherjee, said: ?Only industries were charged earlier. But as civic bodies can now introduce water tax, we are charging 80 paise per head per year as water cess.? The board expects to mop up Rs 1. 40 crore annually, he added. However, so far only the municipalities in Kalyani, Panihati and Barrackpore and two others have paid up.

 Authorities of the Asansol and Durgapur corporations claimed that the board had charged them ?by mistake? because ground water was not being tapped to supply water to residents.

 The Behrampore municipality authorities also refused to pay up. ?Why should we make a payment which we haven?t made before?? asked Nilratan Auddy, chairman of the Congress-led municipality.

 Minister on mobile, House on hold

 A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta, Dec. 28: A neta busy on the 

mobile and unmindful of Assembly proceedings is big worry for Speaker Hashim Abdul 

Halim.

 ?I know how to discipline an unruly MLA. I know how to handle a truant minister. I know how to face barracking. But, I do not know what to do with the mobile phone,? the Speaker said today.

 When in session, using mobile phones in the Assembly is banned. But law minister Nisith Adhikary was caught speaking on his set when Halim rapped the mobile-loving MLAs.

 Adhikary was busy on his phone when the House began discussing the fate of a (shalishi) bill that his department was to table.

 Trinamul Congress MLA Sonali Guha was the first to spot it. ?Sir, the law minister is using his mobile phone in the House,? she shouted to draw the Speaker?s attention.

 Adhikary, however, was so engrossed in his conversation that he was oblivious about the goings on around him. He continued with the conversation despite an uproar by Guha and several other Trinamul MLAs, including Saugata Roy, Gobinda Naskar and Tamanash Ghosh. 

 Halim was seen watching Adhikary who was still unaware of the developments. The Speaker allowed Adhikary to complete his call. 

 As soon as he was through, Halim said: ?I saw you talking to someone on your mobile phone. Why were you doing so despite knowing pretty well that mobiles are not allowed inside the House? You are a minister and should not flout rules and regulations. Please do not do it inside the House in future.? 

 Adhikary stood up as the Speaker admonished him and apologised later.

 He was embarrassed, he told associates. ?Actually, my phone was on vibrator mode and I received an urgent call? I had to speak,? said the minister.

 The mobile rage appears to have caught up with the MLAs. Almost half the communists in the House use mobile phones. In the Opposition, about 75 per cent are armed with it.

 Halim said the use of mobile phones in the Assembly had become rampant. 

 ?Mobile phones have been barred inside the House when it is in session. But I see several MLAs violating the rule and using the phone. In the next session, I will take up the issue seriously and take stern action against any MLA caught using it in the House,? he said.

 The restriction on the use of mobile phones inside the House was made stringent in the wake of the terrorist strike on Parliament in 2002. Ministers, MLAs, journalists and even Assembly officials were asked not to use mobile phones inside the House.

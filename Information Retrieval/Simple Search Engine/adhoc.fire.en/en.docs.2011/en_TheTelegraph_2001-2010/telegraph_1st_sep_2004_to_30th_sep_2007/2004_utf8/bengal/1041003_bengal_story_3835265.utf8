 Widow receives salary dues 42 years after cheque slur

 SWATI SENGUPTA 

Calcutta, Oct. 2: Amulya Chandra Bhattacharya, 

assistant secretary in the agriculture department, is suspended in 1962 over a 

misplaced cheque. He retires 11 years later, with the taint still on him. He is 

absolved in 1992, a year before his death. Another 12 years go by before his widow 

receives his salary dues. 

 It is 42 years since her husband was placed under suspension. Still Bela Bhattacharya, now in her eighties, is happy to have received the dues handed over to her ?with honour and respect?. 

 ?The chief minister admitted that there had been considerable delay and the remaining dues would be cleared soon,? she said at her residence in Uma Kanta Sen Lane at Paikpara. 

 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee believes in ?Do it now?, but most of Bengal doesn?t. And the Bhattacharyas know it?s better late than never. 

 ?We had made so many rounds of government offices that there was almost a feeling among our family members that the dues would never be cleared. It was a long, long ordeal of 42 years? now we are all established but we have gone through tough times,? recalled Bela Bhattacharya?s son, Tarun. 

 ?It was then that my mother wrote to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee because she believed he was the only man who could help us out of this mental torture,? he added. 

 Once the letter reached, the chief minister?s office prodded the agriculture department to take measures. The matter was sent to the personnel and administrative reforms department. 

 ?We got hold of all the necessary documents and the late Amulya Bhattacharya?s service statement was prepared. After a nod from the finance department and with reference to his acquittal from all charges, the government lifted the suspension on Bhattacharya,? a senior department official said. 

 A cheque for Rs 110,364 as salary dues was prepared and handed over to Bela Bhattacharya last month. 

 The personnel department official said they are now working on clearing dues related to Amulya Bhattacharya?s gratuity and pension and family pension. ?Very soon, the aged widow will also start getting her pension,? he added. 

 The gloom in the Bhattacharyas? life that began lifting this September had enveloped them another September 42 summers ago, when the government placed Amulya Bhattacharya under suspension. 

 A criminal case was filed against him in 1963. He retired in January 1973, still under suspension. The case was disposed of in 1992 and Bhattacharya was acquitted. But till his death in 1993, he received only Rs 142 every month as ?provisional pension?.

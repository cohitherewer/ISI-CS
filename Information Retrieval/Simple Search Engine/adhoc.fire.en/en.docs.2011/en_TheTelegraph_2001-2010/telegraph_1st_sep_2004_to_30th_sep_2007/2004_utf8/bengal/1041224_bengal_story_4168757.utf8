 Tiger jailed

 Suri, Dec. 23: Tiger Singh alias Afroz Khan, who took patients hostage at Suri Sadar Hospital and shot one of them last year, was jailed for life today. 

 On August 29, 2003, he hurled bombs at Sadananda Nayek, an Eastern Coalfields employee, in Dubrajpur, 280 km from Calcutta. On September 3, he raided the hospital and demanded that he be handed over. Nayek was shot dead during a nightlong hostage drama.

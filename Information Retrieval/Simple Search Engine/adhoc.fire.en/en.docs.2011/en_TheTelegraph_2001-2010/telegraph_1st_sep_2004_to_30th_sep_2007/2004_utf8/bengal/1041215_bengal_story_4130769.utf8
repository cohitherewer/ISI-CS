 BRIEFS

 Baxirhat (Cooch Behar), Dec. 14: Suspected Ulfa and KLO militants have allegedly abducted a trader, Netai Saha, from here.

 Car-borne assailants picked up the 50-year-old hardware merchant from Postofficepara last evening and sped towards Assam?s Dhubri district. Cooch Behar police chief S.S. Panda said: ?We are near certain that the abduction was carried out by the Ulfa; the Maruti van used bore an Assam registration number.? 

 Howrah: Police have began a probe into the alleged molestation of a BA student of a college in Howrah?s Ramrajatala by a lecturer. The student lodged a complaint with the police on Tuesday. ?We are carrying out an inquiry. We will arrest the teacher of Kanai Lal Bhattacharya College if there is reason to do so,? said Howrah police chief Mihir Kumar Bhattacharya. 

 Midnapore: A tantrik stabbed his uncle to death with a trident on Tuesday morning at Chandrakona in West Midnapore, 130 km from Calcutta. Police said Badal Das, 55, was suffering from a kidney ailment and his nephew Kalipada Das, a known local witchdoctor, wanted to treat him. After a yagna, he locked himself in a room with Badal. Villagers forced open the door hours later and saw Kalipada stabbing his uncle.

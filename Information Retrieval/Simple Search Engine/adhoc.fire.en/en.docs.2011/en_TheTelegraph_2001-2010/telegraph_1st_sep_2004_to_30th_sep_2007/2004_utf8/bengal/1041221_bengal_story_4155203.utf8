 Trinamul ruckus against bill

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 20: Screaming Trinamul Congress MLAs opposing the controversial pre- litigation conciliation board bill today prevented law minister Nisith Adhikary from making a statement.

 Assembly proceedings were disrupted for about 10 minutes from 11.28 am when the minister got up to reply to a question on the release of prisoners who turn 70.

 As Adhikary prepared to speak, Trinamul MLA Moloy Ghatak began to shout at him. The member was joined by other party colleagues. During the melee, one MLA snatched a file from Adhikary?s hands, tore the papers and flung them on the floor. 

 Trinamul member Tamonash Ghosh stood up on Assembly reporters? table in the well and, joined by others, shouted ?boycott? slogans. Repeated requests by Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim to maintain decorum went unheeded.

 Leader of the Opposition Pankaj Banerjee and other senior leaders like Ambika Banerjee, however, did not join the slogan-shouting. 

 Though Adhikary kept on speaking, his reply was not audible. Things returned to normal only when school education Kanti Biswas? turn came. 

 After a while, Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay, the Trinamul chief whip, went to Adhikary and returned the file. ?But we will continue to boycott him until the block-level pre-litigation conciliation board bill (shalishi bill) is withdrawn,? he said.

 Congress legislature party chief Atish Sinha said tonight his party would oppose the bill when it comes up for discussion on Friday. He added: ?We shall join forces with Trinamul Congress MLAs on the floor of the House to prevent the bill being passed.?

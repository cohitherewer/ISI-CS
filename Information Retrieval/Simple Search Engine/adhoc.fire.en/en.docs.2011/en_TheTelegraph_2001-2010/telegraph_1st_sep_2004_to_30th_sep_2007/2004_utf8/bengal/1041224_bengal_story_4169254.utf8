 Caller clue to boy burial 

 Howrah, Dec. 23: Police today claimed a ?tentative breakthrough? in tracing the man who called up Bauria police station to reveal the place where four-year-old Ganesh Palodhi was buried.

 A CID officer said: ?We have a suspicion about who called up the police on Monday to tell where the boy was buried. We have planned a raid.?

 Ganesh was kidnapped on the morning of December 3. He was last seen riding a cycle in front of his Bauria home, about 40 km from Calcutta. Ganesh?s father, Siddhartha Palodhi, lodged a complaint with the police at night. The next afternoon someone called him to demand Rs 25 lakh.

 Siddhartha pleaded he did not have that much money. A deal was struck and he paid Rs 72,300 on December 10. But Ganesh was not returned.

 Flight cancelled

 Alliance Air cancelled its flight from Jaipur tonight because of apprehension that it may not be able to land in Calcutta because of fog.

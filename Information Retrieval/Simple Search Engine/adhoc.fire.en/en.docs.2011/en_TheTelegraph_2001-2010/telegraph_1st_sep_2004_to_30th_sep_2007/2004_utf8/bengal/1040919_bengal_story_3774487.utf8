 Cess on big builders, sop for workers

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 18: The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government has decided to impose a one per cent cess on any construction work in the state that costs over Rs 10 lakh.

 The fund formed by collecting this cess would be used to offer several kinds of financial benefits ? including pension ? to construction workers.

 The state cabinet earlier this week passed a rule on The Building and Other Construction Workers? (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service) Act, 1996. Although the Centre passed the Act in 1996, the state government dilly-dallied for eight years before passing it.

 ?It needed a lot of discussion because the matter is complicated and even now that the rules have been framed, it will take some more time before construction workers actually start getting their benefits,? an official of the state labour directorate said today.

 To implement The West Bengal Building and Other Construction Workers? (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service) Rule, 2004, the government needs to form a board and a board fund, where the cess would be deposited. 

 Construction workers would get their benefits from this fund. The government will issue a notification on this and place it in the coming Assembly session.

 The West Bengal Building and Other Construction Workers? Welfare Board will include representatives from builders, construction workers? unions, engineers and various departments of the state government, including PWD, labour, housing and so on. 

 Construction workers ? roughly estimated at four lakh in the state ? would have to get themselves registered with the board and pay Rs 20 per month as their own contribution to the West Bengal Building and Other Construction Workers? Welfare Fund. 

 Those aged between 18 to 60 who have worked for at least 90 days as construction workers would be eligible for the benefits.

 Some of the benefits to be offered to construction workers are:

 Pension of Rs 150 per month 

 after retirement (The retirement age is 60 years)

 A worker?s family will 

 get Rs 30,000 if he dies in an accident

 In case of normal death, 

 the family will get Rs 10,000

 Construction workers would 

 also get house-building loan

 Medical assistance from 

 the board for workers and their dependent family members

 Special maternity benefits 

 for women construction workers.

 With a view to collect the cess at the source, it would be mandatory for municipalities, municipal corporations and panchayats to see that no plan is sanctioned unless the amount is paid. 

 This can then be sent as contribution in favour of the board. If required, the board might also appoint cess collectors.

 However, no cess is required to be paid in case of construction projects that cost below Rs 10 lakh.

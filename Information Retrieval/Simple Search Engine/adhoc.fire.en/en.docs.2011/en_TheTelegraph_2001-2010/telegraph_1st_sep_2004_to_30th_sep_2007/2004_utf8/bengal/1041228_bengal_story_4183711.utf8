 Police shield for bill on conciliation

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 27: The government will have the Assembly fortified when the controversial West Bengal Block-level Pre-litigation Conciliatory Board Bill (shalishi bill) is tabled tomorrow.

 The Opposition has been protesting against the bill that clears the way for settlement of disputes by a ?conciliation board? at the block level.

 The government today expressed apprehension that the bill baiters may create a ruckus outside the House tomorrow. Police said they would be ready to tackle any situation. 

 Armed policemen and Rapid Action Force personnel would be deployed. Ranvir Kumar, the deputy commissioner, headquarters, said: ?We are determined to keep the area free from trouble.? 

 Senior police officers, including the commissioner, went into a huddle today to crosscheck arrangements. ?Roads leading to the Assembly would be monitored,? said an officer.

 Trinamul Congress leaders alleged that the bill would help the CPM settle village-level disputes bypassing the judiciary. The Marxists will push their own men into the boards to influence proceedings, said a Trinamul leader.

 ?The bill will only help the CPM tighten its grip on village politics,? said Sougata Roy. 

 The MLA added: ?We have information that the government will deploy about a hundred special branch personnel inside the Assembly. Similar arrangements will also be made outside the House. This shows the government?s determination to thwart Opposition protests against the bill.?

 Trinamul chief Mamata Banerjee said MLAs from her party had urged the government not to place the bill in the wake of the death and devastation wreaked by tsunami. ?We wanted the government to first cope with the national crisis. But the CPM is more concerned about political interests.? 

 The government will get the bill passed without trouble as the Left Front enjoys a sweeping majority in the 294-member House with 203 MLAs. 

 At a meeting of the Assembly?s business advisory committee, chaired by Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim, the Opposition expressed its objections. Roy said: ?We wanted a threadbare discussion on the bill before it was tabled. We have strong reservations about certain clauses, but the government is in a hurry.?

 Debaprasad Sarkar of the SUCI demanded the bill be withdrawn. Abdul Mannan of the Congress said: ?We will resist it, but the bill will be passed because we do not have the numbers.?

 Rabin Deb, the front chief whip, said the Opposition should participate in the debate tomorrow to express its views. ?The bill will help people solve civil problems without having to knock at court doors.?

 Cave-in plan on fast track

 ABHIJEET CHATTERJEE 

 Asansol, Dec. 8: The Burdwan administration, the Asansol-Durgapur Development Authority (ADDA) and the Eastern Coalfields Limited have decided to expedite a Rs 1,800-crore project to shift residents of the subsidence-prone coal belt. 

 The decision follows a rash of 

 cave-in incidents over the past year culminating in the 

 massive one at Sanktoria near the ECL headquarters on November 

 27. Altogether 4 lakh people have to be moved across 500 

 mouzas in a 1,600 sq km area.

 The ECL has received Rs 32 crore from the Centre for demographic and socio-economic survey in the Shamdi, Bangalpara, Kenda, Harishpur, Dishergarh, Sanktoria and Barakar areas of Asansol. It will be completed in two months. 

 ?Shifting, stabilisation and rehabilitation of Sanktoria and Dishergarh villages and Barakar town have got top priority in the survey. The BCCL (Bharat Coking Coal Ltd) will provide land for shifting about 8,000 residents of Barakar and the ECL will give land for moving residents from its subsidence-prone lands. The ADDA will prepare the plans for the new townships,? said N.S. Nigam, additional district magistrate of Asansol and chief executive officer of ADDA. 

 Coal India prepared a masterplan for the project in Burdwan and parts of Birbhum, Purulia, Bankura and Jharkhand in 2003. The Centre has allotted Rs 1,800 crore for the project, which has been divided into four phases with five years for each phase.

 ECL statistics show that over 60 houses, including several employees? quarters, have collapsed over the past year. Residents of the century-old coal belt are spending sleepless nights in fear of subsidence. 

 A survey report by the Directorate-General of Mines Safety says about 1,600 sq km of BCCL and ECL land is prone to subsidence because of improper operation by private coal-mine owners till 1973, when the sector was nationalised. 

 But the Sanktoria land was not included in the subsidence-prone zone identified in the report. ECL officials said it has fuelled fear and exposed the fact that the ECL is not aware of all the pockets where subsidence may occur.

 Own school admission test banned

 - Junior classes to varsity, 

 change on the cards 

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 16: Parents of primary school students in state-aided high schools can breathe easy. They will no longer have to fret over their wards? admission tests to enter Class V of the same school. 

 The high court today said no school can be allowed to force Class IV students to take fresh admission tests for promotion to Class V in the same institution. 

 A division bench of Justice Barin Ghosh and Justice A.K. Basu today upheld an earlier order by Justice K.J. Sengupta and said that the school authorities had no jurisdiction to force students to go through the double-admission test system. 

 Thousands of students in more than 7,000 state-aided junior high (till Class VIII) and secondary schools (till Class X) across Bengal suffer from uncertainty fearing that they might not be able to continue in the same institution. 

 Many schools now compel Class IV students to pass through a sieve of tests. 

 It will be mandatory for all schools to follow the order passed by a division bench of the highest court in the state. 

 Earlier, the trial court passed a similar order and the issue became sub-judice as the authorities of Shiv Mandir Valika Vidyalaya in Howrah challenged the verdict in the high court.

 Today?s order followed a petition by Sujit Kumar Banerjee, the parent of a student of the Howrah school. 

 In his petition, Banerjee alleged that his daughter had passed the Class-IV examinations ?but the school authorities asked her to appear for a test to secure admission to Class V. As she declined to sit for the test, the authorities denied her admission?. Four other students of the school faced the same problem.

 Banerjee told the court: ?Justice K.J. Sengupta had asked the school authorities to allow my daughter in Class V. But even after the court?s order, the school authorities refused to admit her.?

 The court today said: ?This type of practice will not be tolerated.?

 The division bench had asked a representative of the Howrah school?s governing body to attend today?s hearing. 

 Along with Banerjee?s daughter, the division bench asked the school to allow all those who cleared the Class IV examinations to study in Class V. 

 An official of the secondary education board said institutions hold fresh admission tests to tackle the rush from primary schools.

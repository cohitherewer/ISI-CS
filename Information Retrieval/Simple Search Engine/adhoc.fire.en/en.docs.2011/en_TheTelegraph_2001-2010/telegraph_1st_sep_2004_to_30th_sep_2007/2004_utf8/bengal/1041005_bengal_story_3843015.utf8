 Dad admits selling daughter

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 4: A man of 50 arrested in South 24-Parganas for being part of a girl-running racket confessed to police today that he had even sold his daughter to traffickers.

 Kartick Haldar thought Rs 7,000 was a good enough price for his 17-year-old daughter, Pratima.

 His 17-year-old son Haran apparently helped him ply his trade at Joynagar, about 90 km from here. The boy?s job was to lure girls by playing lover.

 The father-son duo was caught after six-year-old Ardhendu Mondal, who went missing yesterday, was found in their house, hand and feet tied and gagged. 

 Ardhendu?s father Sukumar had lodged a complaint with the police and approached panchayat pradhan Dilip Haldar. 

 The pradhan and his men launched a house-to-house search, which led to the rescue.

 Additional superintendent of police B.C. Mondal said Kartick had smuggled nearly a dozen women to Bangladesh. He was apparently targeting boys of late.

 A resident of Krishnagar village in Joynagar, he had been running the racket for nearly a decade. Pratima was sold off five years ago.

 Police said a local youth, Sheikh Anwar, had introduced Kartick to a ?young businessman? from Bangladesh, Fazle Ali. ?He (Kartick) told us Fazle Ali wanted to marry his daughter Pratima and offered him Rs 7,000. Kartick was not ashamed of what he had done.... There was no repentance,? said an officer.

 ?What wrong have I done by giving my daughter away for Rs 7,000? I needed the money,? he apparently told interrogators.

 Haran joined his father about two years ago. He would promise girls marriage or jobs. 

 Today, angry villagers dragged the father and son out of a cowshed where they were hiding and handed them to the police. Mondal said: ?We are trying to ascertain how many girls they have sold in Bangladesh. We will also try to rescue the girls, who are mostly from Joynagar, Kultali and nearby places.?

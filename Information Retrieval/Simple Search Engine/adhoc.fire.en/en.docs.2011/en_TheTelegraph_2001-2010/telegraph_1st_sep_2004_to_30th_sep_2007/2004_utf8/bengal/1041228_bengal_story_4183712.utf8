 TB taboo isolates family

 RABI BANERJEE

 Krishnagar, Dec. 27: The family of a trader in Nadia?s Tehatta is facing a social boycott because neighbours think all its members have tuberculosis and might infect them.

 Mathura Haldar had fled Tehatta Subdivisional Hospital, about 140 km from Calcutta, a week ago after being diagnosed with TB. 

 The doctor treating him there came to his house in a bid to convince him to return to the hospital, saying the disease was curable. But Haldar did not care because a quack had told him that he had asthma. 

 The villagers heard snatches of the conversation between Haldar and doctor and word spread that the entire Haldar family had TB. The boycott followed.

 The situation at Natna village has come to such a pass that the district health authorities are sending a team of medical officers tomorrow to launch an awareness campaign. 

 Mrinal Kanti Biswas, the chief medical officer of health, said the villagers needed to be educated. ?If a family member contracts TB, it does not mean that the others in the family would get it too,? he said. Biswas will also visit the village tomorrow.

 ?We will campaign in the village to create awareness. Our team will be there till Haldar?s family is accepted like any other,? he said.

 A week ago, Haldar went to the subdivisional hospital with complaints of chest pain and severe coughing. 

 Dr R.C. Murmu, who examined him, ran a series of tests and detected an advanced stage of TB. He advised Haldar to get admitted to the hospital immediately. 

 ?He was suffering from breathlessness...there was blood in his cough. An X-ray of his chest confirmed that Mathura had TB,? said Murmu. 

 Haldar?s brother Joy also had TB, but he is cured now. However, his wife Phulkumari, an anganwadi worker engaged in cooking midday meals for students in the local primary school, is in trouble now. The guardians do not want her to cook. They think she could be having TB, too.

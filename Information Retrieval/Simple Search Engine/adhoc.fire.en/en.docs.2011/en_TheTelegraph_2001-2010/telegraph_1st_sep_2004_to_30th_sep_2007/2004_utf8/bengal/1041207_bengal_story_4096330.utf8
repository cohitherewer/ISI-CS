 Naxalites attack to keep safe distance

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Midnapore, Dec. 6: The Naxalites who set ablaze vehicles used to build roads and bombed forest bungalows at Kankrajhore on Saturday did so to keep at bay security personnel at their heels, police said today.

 Jogesh Chatterjee, the inspector-general of western range, who visited the scene of the rebel raid, about 240 km from Calcutta, said if the road was built, security forces would have had better access to the terrain and that would have posed problems for the guerrillas.

 ?The construction of the road would have improved the communication network, which would have been very useful for us. These people (the CPI-Maoist activists) want to dominate the area,? said Chatterjee.

 West Midnapore officials said the forest bungalows where blasts were triggered used to be converted to police camps during raids. 

 Three vehicles, including a road-roller and a dumper, were set on fire outside a camp for construction workers. An official said: ?We feel that the road-construction equipment and the forest bungalows came under attack because the Naxalites thought their movement would be affected because of them.?

 The Naxalites also singled out two CPM leaders and their supporters for a thrashing.

 Director-general of state police Shyamal Dutta is leaving for Kankrajhore tomorrow under instructions from the chief minister. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee reviewed the situation in the rebel zone this evening. Chief secretary Asok Gupta, home secretary Amit Kiran Deb, city police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee and Dutta were present at the meeting in which the Naxalites? December 15 rally in the Calcutta Maidan was also discussed. 

 West Midnapore district magistrate Chandan Sinha said the administration was determined to construct the 12.5-km road between Odalchua and Kankrajhore. ?We will not allow any obstruction to development. All necessary measures to implement the project will be taken,? he said.

 But scared after Saturday?s incident, the labourers working in the project have refused to return. Dusmanta Giri, the contractor for the construction job, said: ?I understand the administration?s determination, but who will do the work? The Naxalites set my vehicles on fire and I have already suffered losses worth lakhs. Even if I organise the funds and want to go ahead, who will I get to work with??

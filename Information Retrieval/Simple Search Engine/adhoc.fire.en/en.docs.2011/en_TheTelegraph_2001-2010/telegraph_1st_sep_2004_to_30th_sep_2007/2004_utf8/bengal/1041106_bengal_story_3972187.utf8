Srinagar, Nov. 5: A Calcuttan 

 was among seven people injured when militants lobbed a grenade 

 at police in the tourist resort of Pahalgam this afternoon.

 Police said Suman Sarkar, who is married, was injured along with four police officers including the local station house officer Shabir Ahmad. Two locals were also hurt.

 Of late, tourists from Bengal are flocking to the Valley to enjoy the changing colours of autumn. The famed chinars change colour from green to crimson and finally golden yellow during this season. 

 Pahalgam is a favourite with domestic and foreign tourists alike because of its alpine forests and the gushing Lidder river that divides the Pahalgam valley.

 The police said the injured were rushed to an Anantnag hospital. But three policemen were taken to Srinagar for treatment.

 ?The militants hurled the grenade at the police party near a hotel and injured seven ? four policemen, two locals and the Bengali tourist. Sarkar was discharged from hospital after treatment,? the police said.

 Security forces have reached the spot and cordoned off the area. Searches have been mounted. No one has been arrested for the attack, for which no group has claimed responsibility as yet.

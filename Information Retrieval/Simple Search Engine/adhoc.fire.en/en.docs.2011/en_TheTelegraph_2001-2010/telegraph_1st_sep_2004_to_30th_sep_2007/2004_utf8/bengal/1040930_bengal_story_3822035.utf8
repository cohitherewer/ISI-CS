 Push for private hospitals

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Sept. 29: Health 

 minister Surjya Kanta Mishra today called for a public-private 

 partnership (PPP) policy to set up hospitals, especially 

 in the districts.

 ?The people in the districts are also capable of paying money for superior healthcare facilities. Therefore, it is time for you (private hospitals) to go to the districts and set up hospitals. The government will do all it can to help you,? he said at a CII-organised healthcare meet. 

 The minister said private hospitals cater to only 20 per cent of the population. ?There is ample scope for the private sector to improve... They) must go to the rural areas in a big way,? he said. 

 Mishra lauded a proposal to set up a health city in Calcutta. ?Once the PPP policy is in place, we can project Calcutta as the best possible healthcare destination,? he said.

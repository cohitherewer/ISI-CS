 Loose tongue calls in trouble

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Behrampore, Sept. 23: Inability to keep secrets has cost a woman her 10-month-old marriage and led the police to probe into an alleged murder. 

 On the night of September 18, Bakkar Sheikh was found lying dead on the road at Colony Para in Islampur. There were no visibly serious injuries to him. His family concluded that he died of alcohol overdose and buried the body. There was no police complaint.

 In another corner of the locality the next day, Mahidul Sheikh, in whose house five villagers had assembled, was overheard by wife Tajma Bibi. They had plotted Bakkar?s murder, she heard.

 Tajma babbled off in front of her friends what she had heard. Yesterday, she even told the same to Phulsara Bibi, Bakkar?s wife.

 Word reached Mahidul that his wife has been talking about the murder. ?Talaaq, talaaq, Talaaq,? he said and turned Tajma out of the house. She returned to her father, in the same village, sobbing.

 Phulsara today went to Islampur police station and lodged a complaint.

 Murshidabad superintendent of police Gyanwant Singh said Bakkar?s body would be exhumed in the presence of a magistrate and sent for post-mortem. ?The officer in charge of Islampur has gone to the village to investigate the case,? he added. Mahidul and the four others are absconding.

 Phulsara said: ?Tajma told me two days ago that my husband did not die because of alcohol. He was murdered. I have lodged an FIR naming Mahidul and the four others.?

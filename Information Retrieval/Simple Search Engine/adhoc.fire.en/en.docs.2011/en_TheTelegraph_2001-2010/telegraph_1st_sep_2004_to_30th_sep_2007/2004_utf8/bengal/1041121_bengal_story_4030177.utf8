 Nepal duo in net for Maoist link

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Siliguri, Nov. 20: Two Nepalese citizens, suspected to be Maoists, were arrested from Darjeeling More under Matigara police station this morning.

 Police said Lalit Subba of Ewaseven in Terathum district and Padam Kalikote of Taplejung in Eastern Nepal are members of the Nepal Communist Party, Maoist, and were here to group with Indian Maoist factions. 

 Subba was allegedly involved in smuggling arms from India to Nepal. The police described his arrest as a ?big catch?. Darjeeling superintendent of police Rajeev Mishra said: ?Subba was the area organiser in the bordering areas of Eastern Nepal. He and Kalikote were wanted in an earlier case registered with the Matigara police station.? 

 Officers said they were holding a meeting at a hideout in Shivmandir when the police swooped on them.

 Two Maoists arrested in September apparently named Subba and Kalikote. ?Since then we had been drawing plans to nab them,? Mishra said.

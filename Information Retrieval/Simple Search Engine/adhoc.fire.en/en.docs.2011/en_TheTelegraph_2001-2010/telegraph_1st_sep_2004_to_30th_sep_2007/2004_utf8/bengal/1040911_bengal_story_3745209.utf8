 Blessed with bail, Goutam goes missing

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Syedpur, Sept. 10: The 

 residents of this East Midnapore village have seethed in 

 anger for 12 years since Calcutta High Court granted bail 

 to Goutam Biswas, who was sentenced to a life term for raping 

 and murdering 12-year-old Putul Maity.

 Her father Trilochan Maity, a paan and bidi seller, moved the high court yesterday citing Dhananjoy Chatterjee?s death sentence for raping and killing teenager Hetal Parekh in Calcutta and seeking to ?correct the injustice?.

 His neighbours at the village, 90 km from Calcutta, are hopeful that Goutam will also be punished for his crime.

 Goutam, who lives in a tiled single-storey house ? about two minutes? walk from Trilochan?s ? with one of six brothers, was last seen three days ago in a speeding truck. He works as a khalashi (helper).

 The same judge who sentenced Dhananjoy to death gave a life term to Goutam. He spent seven days behind bars. 

 His cousin Rohit Biswas said: ?I wonder how he could walk with his head high after such a crime.?

 One of Goutam?s elder brothers, Netai, is a retired primary school teacher and secretary of the CPM?s branch committee. He is said to have snapped ties with his brother more than a decade ago.

 The district secretariat member of the CPM, Nirmal Jana, said Netai was a popular CPM leader in the area. ?We know that he does not have any link with his brother for the past 10 to 15 years. All of us in Syedpur want Goutam to be punished for what he did.?

 Sushila Pal, 80, who lives next to the Maitys, demanded Goutam be hanged. ?Someone who can kill an innocent little girl should be hanged. This is the only punishment that suits him,? she said.

 Renu Das, a mother of two, said if Goutam escapes punishment, ?our children will be encouraged to commit more such crimes?.

 After years, Trilochan was hopeful. ?I earn little. Our hope for justice was almost shattered. After Dhananjoy?s hanging, we felt if he can go to the gallows, how can another man guilty of a similar crime roam free.? 

 His wife said she had been living in fear with her four daughters all these years.

 Goutam, an 18-year-old in 1988, had lured Putul with mangoes to a half-built house and raped and killed her there.

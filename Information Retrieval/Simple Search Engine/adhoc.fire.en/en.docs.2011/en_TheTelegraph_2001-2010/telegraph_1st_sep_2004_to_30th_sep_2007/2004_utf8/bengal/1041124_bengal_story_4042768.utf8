 Doors open to tourists

 ANURADHA SHARMA LAKHOTIA

 Lataguri, Nov. 23: Bowing to pressure from tour operators, the forest department allowed a group of Bangladeshi tourists to stay at its Hollong resort in Jaldapara Wildlife Sanctuary, reversing its decision to cancel all bookings to facilitate an animal census.

 ?It has come as a face saver for us,? said Raj Basu, the executive head of the Eastern Himalayan Travel and Tour Operators? Association, which staged a sit-in on the fringes of Gorumara National Park, around 80 km from Siliguri, to protest against cancellations without notice. 

 Over 30 government and private lodges are losing out on tourists following the move. The Bangladeshis were on the verge of cancelling their trip and returning, promising never to come back. 

 ?They had booked the Hollong lodge a month ago. We came to know about the cancellations yesterday. It is good that the government has responded to our appeal and allowed the tourists to stay on. This is positive for the industry,? said the association?s secretary.

 Conservator of forests P.T. Bhutia said: ?If the decision has been taken, it may be because the tourists had come from far and did not have a place to stay.? He added that the visitors would not be allowed to enter the sanctuary. ?That would affect the census.?

 The animal census began today in the sanctuaries and national parks of Gorumara, Jaldapara, Mahananda, Chapramari and Neora Valley.

 Teams of forest officials and NGOs scouted the jungles on foot and on elephants for dung, hoof marks or other signs of animal activity.

 Some Gorkhas rejoice, not all

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Darjeeling, Oct. 3: After the cheers, the home truths. 

 The celebrations that began after the British government?s decision to allow Gorkha soldiers to apply for citizenship have been somewhat toned down after realisation that not all would be able to do so. 

 British Prime Minister Tony Blair announced last week that immigration rules would be changed to allow Gorkhas, who have served at least four years and were discharged after July 1, 1997 ? when the British handed over Hong Kong to China ? will be eligible for ?fast-track? citizenship. 

 Around 230 soldiers are discharged every year. 

 Some former soldiers, who did not wish to be named, said the cut-off date was a ?major disappointment?. ?Is there a justification in denying immigration to a soldier who was discharged, say in 1996, after serving the army for 15 years? How is he any less entitled than the man discharged a year later?? asked one of them. 

 For others, however, the announcement was a godsend. Bijay Tamang, who retired as a captain in September 1997, said the new legislation would open job avenues. ?I will definitely like to go to Britain, if the Brigade of Gorkhas helps me find a job,? said Tamang.

 Many feel the legislation will be a step towards making the pension of the Nepalese Gorkhas on a par with their British counterparts. ?The British had contended that the standard of living in Britain and Nepal were different and so the disparity in pension. If the Nepalese Gorkhas are allowed to settle there, the argument will not hold,? said K.P. Malla, the president of the Brigade of Gorkhas? Ex-Servicemen Association.

 The British government retained Gurkha Regiment 1, 2, 6,7 and 10 at the time of Independence, which were later reorganised into Royal Gurkha Regiment 1 and 2 ? one was stationed in Brunei and the other in Britain. 

 So long, the Nepalese Gorkhas had complained of ?step-motherly? treatment as they got only a third of the pension received by their English counterparts. The new announcement is being perceived as an acknowledgement of services. ?This is great news for people like us... indication that things are improving,? said Malla.

 Till 1972, the British recruited youths from Jalaphar and Gorakhpur in India. When the process was stopped, many Gorkhas obtained Nepalese citizenship to enroll in the British army. According to the terms of employment, these soldiers are discharged at the place of their recruitment after retiring from service.

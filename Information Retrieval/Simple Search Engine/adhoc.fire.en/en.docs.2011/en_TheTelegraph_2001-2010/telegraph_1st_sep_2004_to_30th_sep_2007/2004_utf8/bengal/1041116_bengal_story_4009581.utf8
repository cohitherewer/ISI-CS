 Hospitals in north without medicines

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Siliguri, Nov. 15: Hospitals in the district have been hit by an acute shortage of medicines.

 Supplies to the district medicine reserve centre in Darjeeling dried up in the past eight months, as a result of which subdivisional, block and rural hospitals and primary health centres are going almost without medicines. 

 Some of the hospitals are just about pulling through with supplies received under special projects and schemes.

 Amit Dutta, the superintendent of Naxalbari block hospital and the block?s medical officer of health, said: ?Such was the crisis we even asked the gram panchayats to give us money to buy medicines.?

 He added: ?We had received funds from the Siliguri mahakuma parishad, with the help of which we were able to tide over the crisis. But some problems persist.? 

 Though no health official offered the exact reason why the supply of medicines stopped in the past few months, some said the government restriction was because of anomalies in the purchase of medicines in the last allotment, a probe into which is on. 

 Darjeeling chief medical officer of health T.N. Chattoraj blamed the irregular supply on the late budget after initially denying any shortage. 

 Sources said the government had sanctioned Rs 31 lakh for the chief medical officer to purchase medicines and had issued a deadline of October 31 for their disbursement. However, no one seemed to know what happened to that money.

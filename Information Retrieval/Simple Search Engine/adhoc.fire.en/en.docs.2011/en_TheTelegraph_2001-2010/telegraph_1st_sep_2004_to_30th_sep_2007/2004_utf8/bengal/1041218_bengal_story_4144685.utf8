 Sweetener for tea

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta/Siliguri, Dec. 17: The government today gave the tea cup an aroma many had been yearning for years. 

 It passed a bill in the Assembly aimed at increasing the minimum monthly wages of plantation workers from Rs 750 to Rs 6,500, though misgivings crept up on whether the amended act would be implemented.

 For once, the Assembly witnessed a rare concurrence of opinions and the Plantations Labour (West Bengal Amendment) Bill, 2004, was passed with full support from the Trinamul Congress and other Opposition parties. 

 Following the amendment, the tea garden owners of north Bengal will have to pay a minimum wage of Rs 6,500 every month to its employees. The move is expected to benefit around three lakh workers in north Bengal.

 Tabling the amendment, labour minister Mohammad Amin told the Assembly that workers in tea plantations across Bengal were deprived of various welfare schemes and health facilities provided under the Plantations Labour Act, 1951, because of the low ceiling of monthly wages fixed in the Act. ?Therefore, we decided to raise the ceiling by amending the act,? he said.

 Paras Dutta, a Trinamul MLA, said: ?We welcome the government?s gesture but at the same time are apprehensive about whether the tea workers would actually benefit from the amendment.? 

 His doubts were echoed even by the RSP, an ally in the ruling Left Front, which said the government would have to implement the act with alacrity.

 Refuting allegations by the Opposition parties that the government was not doing anything to protect the tea garden workers, the labour minister said: ?Altogether, 41 tea gardens in north Bengal were shut down in the past year. Out of these, 28 have reopened while workers of eight of the 13 closed gardens are getting a monthly allowance of Rs 500.? 

 In north Bengal, the news was greeted with a mix of joy and scepticism.

 N.K. Basu, the convener of the 

 Coordination Committee of Planters? Association, said: ?The 

 move to raise the minimum wage limit will bring a large 

 number of workers under the purview of the welfare schemes, 

 which is good.? 

 The Himalayan Plantation Workers Union reacted with doubts. ?We have to wait and watch whether the government is serious about implementing this amendment.?

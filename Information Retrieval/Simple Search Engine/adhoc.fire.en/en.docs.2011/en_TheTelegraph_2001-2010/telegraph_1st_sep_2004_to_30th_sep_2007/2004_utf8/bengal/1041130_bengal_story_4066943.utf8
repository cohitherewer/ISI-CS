 Row over JU math lecturer selection

 TAMAL SENGUPTA 

 Calcutta, Nov. 29: The selection committee for recruitment of mathematics teachers to Jadavpur University is split over preparing a panel of eight candidates for five vacancies. 

 Four of the eight committee members have put a candidate on top of the panel who, according to three other members, is less qualified than the others. 

 Vice-chancellor A.N. Basu, chairman of the selection committee, remains noncommittal. When contacted today, he refused comment. 

 The members, now divided into two groups, have decided to submit separate panels to the university executive council, its highest decision-making body. The executive council is expected to meet on December 15. 

 The development has created ripples among university teachers. ?Ours is a university which was awarded five-star status by the NAAC (National Assessment and Accreditation Council) which provided Rs 30 crore. We should be careful about recruiting teachers,? said an executive council member. 

 The selection committee interviewed about 150 candidates for the five posts of lecturer in the mathematics department early this month. Since then the committee has been divided ? in a rare instance ? over naming Avijit Lahiri on top of the panel. 

 According to documents available with The Telegraph, Lahiri has scored a first class with 63.6 per cent in MSc from JU. But he did not get a first class in BSc (46.8 per cent) from Calcutta University. In his Madhyamik examination, Lahiri had a score of 56.7 per cent and in Higher Secondary, 51.1 per cent.

 The three selectors against Lahiri want to nominate Sandip Jana, who was first-class first in both his BSc (79.75 per cent) and MSc (79.5 per cent) examinations from CU. Jana scored 86 per cent in his Madhyamik and 84.3 per cent in HS examinations. 

 Varsity insiders said a selector, the nominee of chancellor and governor Viren J. Shah, was the first to put her foot down. At one point, she threatened to boycott the selection process in protest against the attempt to put Lahiri on top of the panel. The vice-chancellor persuaded her against leaving the meeting.

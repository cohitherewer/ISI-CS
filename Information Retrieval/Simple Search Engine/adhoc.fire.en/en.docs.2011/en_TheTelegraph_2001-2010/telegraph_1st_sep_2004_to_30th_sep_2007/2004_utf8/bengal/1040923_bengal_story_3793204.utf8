 Police stumble on Bandit Queen 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Midnapore, Sept. 22: She was most wanted, but police had no idea they had their quarry when they held her and two men three weeks ago from Midnapore town for possessing arms. During interrogation, the truth tumbled out: she was the leader of a large dacoit gang responsible for a string of raids in West Midnapore and Hooghly districts last month. 

 Thirty-two year-old Uma Rani Mondal ? of medium height and dark complexion ? is Bengal?s Bandit Queen. 

 ?She is known for her ruthlessness. She is known in her circle as dacait rani. But I think she is something more than that. I have not seen someone so proud of her dacoit status,? said Manoj Verma, the additional superintendent of police (Kharagpur). 

 ?She is deft with both a pistol and a knife,? said a Chandrakona police station official. 

 In the middle of last month, her gang had pulled off a heist at Chandrakona in West Midnapore, 115 km from Calcutta. The police got wind of her gang ? of about 40 dacoits ? after the arrest of two women robbers, Sobhonara Bibi and Aslima Bibi, after that dacoity. 

 During interrogation, the police also found links to the People?s War Group. Uma was apparently supplying weapons to the Naxalites. 

 She will be produced in court on Wednesday. 

 Uma is the younger sister of Lakhsmi Roy, a CPM member. But her brother disowned her. ?We don?t have any relationship with her since she got married 13 years ago,? he said. 

 A resident of Panchkuri Bura Patna village in Keshpur, 170 km from Calcutta, Uma was a Class IX student when she eloped with a youth from Ghatal, Kalipada Khamrui. 

 About six years ago, she deserted her ill husband ? accusing him of torture ? and also left behind her son and daughter. 

 She teamed up with Asanur, a vegetable seller by day and a bandit by night of Sarisha village of Garbeta. Thus began a life of plunder, loot, arms running and deception. 

 She would often be seen riding pillion with Asanur on a motorcycle, heavily decked up and wearing dark glasses, speeding through Midnapore town.

 Police chief clean chit to Subhas 

 - Players shouldn?t have 

been arrested: Minister

 OUR BUREAU

 Subhas: Upbeat

 Nov. 7: After the party, police today absolved transport minister Subhas Chakraborty of charges of harbouring links with gangster Dilip Banerjee.

 Director-general of police Shyamal Dutta said: ?Our investigations have revealed that Chakraborty is in no way connected with the gangster. Dilip is a criminal and is being handled according to the law. Media people have dragged the minister?s name into the case without verifying facts.?

 In Birbhum to inaugurate a housing complex for his personnel, the police chief evaded a direct reply on the transfer of Humayun Kabir, the officer who picked up one of Bengal?s most wanted criminals. 

 Asked if moving the Salt Lake subdivisional police officer to a low-profile post was a ?reward? for arresting Dilip, Dutta said: ?It?s not possible for me to judge an individual officer. There are 5,000 others who are also doing well.?

 Dutta?s clean chit to Chakraborty came five days after the CPM leadership declared that it was sure the minister had no links with the man known as hatkata Dilip in his world.

 Though the chief minister is yet to comment, it can be assumed that Dutta?s clean chit could not have come without Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s approval. 

 Exonerated by the party, Chakraborty expressed unhappiness about the arrest of two footballers. 

 After inaugurating a swimming competition in Haldia, he said: ?I cannot understand what prompted the police to arrest the two players (East Bengal?s Sasthi Duley and Dipankar Roy). They could have easily conducted a probe without arresting them. They wouldn?t have fled home.? 

 ?They should have been allowed to play in the Durand Cup,? he added.

 Dilip was picked up from Duley?s home at Haripal, Hooghly. Roy had allegedly introduced him to the Duleys. 

 Chakraborty said: ?No doubt he (Sasthi) has committed a mistake by providing shelter to Dilip in his house.? He also welcomed moves to bring the duo back on field.

 However, the Barrackpore court today remanded Duley and Roy in judicial custody. Subdivisional judicial magistrate Gopal Chandra Karmakar told the police to produce them on November 16.

 East Bengal came forward with the promise of support. A club official said: ?We will appeal to the chief minister to help them come back on field. If the duo moves the high court, the club will provide 100 per cent assistance.?

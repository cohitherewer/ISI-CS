 Bank door heist a hoax

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 11: Friday?s 

 daylight robbery at Alipore has turned out to be a fraud, 

 with the ?victim? confessing he stole the money himself.

 Ramashankar Singh, a cloth merchant?s driver, had lodged a complaint yesterday saying he had been robbed of Rs 5.03 lakh at gunpoint by two youths while he was going to the State Bank of India?s Alipore branch to deposit the money.

 But today, barely 12 hours after lodging the FIR, Singh confessed to his crime before taking police officials to his house and handing them back the money. Singh also told them that he had cut his right palm with a knife to make it appear he had been stabbed when he resisted.

 During preliminary investigation, officers of Alipore police station noticed inconsistencies. ?What led us to suspect Singh was the nature of the wound on his right palm. A doctor called to examine the injury clearly told us it was self-inflicted,? said Anuj Sharma, deputy commissioner of police, south division.

 ?When we built pressure, he started making contradictory statements. He was confused about the timing of the incident,? said Singh. ?The description of the attackers was not matching with the statement Singh made immediately after the incident.?

 Singh, who worked for the cloth merchant for three years, gave in to sustained questioning around midnight. 

 Metro smoke

 There was smoke emitting from under a Metro coach today. Officials said it was spotted as a Dum Dum-bound train entered Shyambazar at 2.51 pm. A train was cancelled and 20 were rescheduled.

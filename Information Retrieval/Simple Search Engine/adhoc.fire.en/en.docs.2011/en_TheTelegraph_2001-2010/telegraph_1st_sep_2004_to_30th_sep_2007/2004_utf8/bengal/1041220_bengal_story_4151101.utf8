 Flood plan

 Midnapore, Dec. 19: Union water resources minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi today announced a Rs 40-crore ?master plan? to combat floods in seven police station areas in the two Midnapore districts.

 Speaking at Sabang in West Midnapore, about 130 km from Calcutta, Das Munshi said the package is being included in the Tenth Plan. ?The two major rivers in the area ? the Kapaleswari and the Keleghai ? will be excavated and de-silted at strategic places. We will hold talks with the chief minister (Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee) in January and begin the work,? he said.

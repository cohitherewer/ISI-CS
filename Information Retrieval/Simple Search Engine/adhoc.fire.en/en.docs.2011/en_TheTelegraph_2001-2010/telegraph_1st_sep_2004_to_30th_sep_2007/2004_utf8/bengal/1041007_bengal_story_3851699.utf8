 Sen hawks success abroad 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Oct. 6: Industries minister Nirupam Sen today called his visit to Italy last week a ?follow-up of the chief minister?s trip to the country last year? and said he highlighted some of the focus areas of business in Bengal like leather, gems and jewellery and food processing. 

 Sen had stopped over in the United Arab Emirates, where, too, he stressed on the strong point of doing business with Bengal. He said he had a one-to-one meeting with Ten Sports chief Sheikh Abdul Rahman Bukhatir at Sharjah and invited him to Bengal. 

 He mentioned the MoU signed between food-processing company Fenco SpA, Bengal Nestors and the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation in Italy for developing a food processing plant in north Bengal. 

 The WBIDC is likely to seal a deal with Italian company Simest for furthering joint ventures in Bengal. Simest identifies investment opportunities abroad and provides equity support to Italian firms going in for joint ventures.

 LIC agent held for murder

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Sept. 25: Police last night arrested Jayanta Ganguly, an LIC agent, in connection with the murder of his business partner, Arindam Saha, over four months ago. 

 Ganguly, a resident of Bagha Jatin, was absconding since the killing and police used two masons, arrested within 15 days of the murder, to lay a trap for him. Ganguly finally walked into the net yesterday. 

 Nihar Mondal and Ramakrishna Malakar, the two masons, had confessed they were engaged by Ganguly to finish Saha. The police believe Ganguly wanted his partner removed so that he could take over his large number of clients. 

 Reconstructing the murder, the police said Ganguly was escorting Saha to Barrackpore and Halisahar, places the victim were not familiar with, to meet sub-agents on May 14. At Bhutbagan, near Halisahar, the trio attacked Saha and stabbed him to death. 

 The police had been placing calls through the masons to get in touch with Ganguly. He had been avoiding the calls, but agreed to meet them at Karunamoyee last night.

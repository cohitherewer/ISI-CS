 Back to benches for college teachers

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Nov. 28: In an attempt to improve the quality of classroom lectures in universities and colleges across the state, the government is mulling making refresher courses and orientation programmes compulsory for teachers.

 The programmes are aimed at enabling teachers in undergraduate and post-graduate institutions to brush up their knowledge at regular intervals.

 ?Upgradation of knowledge after a certain period of time is extremely important for teachers in the present system in which students? quest for updated information is increasing everyday,? said Shyamapada Pal, a member of the Calcutta University syndicate and the state council for higher education.

 According to the proposal, every teacher in the science stream will have to attend these programmes once in two years till retirement. Those teaching humanities subjects will have to attend the courses at least once in three years. 

 The council has discussed the proposal and a series of meetings are on the cards to finalise the decision.

 In the existing system, college and university teachers attend orientation programmes and refresher courses only to become eligible for higher rank under the University Grants Commission?s selection grade promotion scheme. According to the system, a teacher may attend orientation and refresher courses only twice in an entire career ? once before getting promoted from lecturer to senior lecturer and then from senior lecturer to reader.

 The existing programmes comprise lectures that focus on developments in specific subjects. At the end of a programme, the teachers submit an essay on what they learnt. The recommendation for promotion depends on their performance in the programme and particularly on how they write.

 The government now plans to make to-be teachers attend these courses after being empanelled for a post in a college or university.

 Sudarsan Roychoudhury, the general secretary of the West Bengal College and University Teachers? Association, said: ?There is no denying that state-aided colleges and universities need to offer high-quality education to compete with private and foreign institutions, which are opening branches in Calcutta and elsewhere in the districts.?

 However, Roychoudhury also pointed out that huge infrastructure is required to offer the courses to nearly 12,000 teachers of about 300 colleges and seven state-aided universities in the state. 

 Education department sources said the government is considering a proposal to set up academic staff colleges in undergraduate institutions like Presidency and Ashutosh.

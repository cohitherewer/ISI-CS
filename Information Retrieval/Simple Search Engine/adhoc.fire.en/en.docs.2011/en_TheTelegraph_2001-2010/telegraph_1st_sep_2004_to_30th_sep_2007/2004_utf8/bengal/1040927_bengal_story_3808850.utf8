 School shut for children

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Behrampore, Sept. 26: A primary school near here has been fenced off, resulting in an unwelcome holiday for 327 students since early this month.

 On September 2, students on way to the school realised that it was out of bounds as the approach way had been blocked. The next day, angry guardians locked up the institution at Ramakantapur in Suti, about 265 km from Calcutta. 

 In 2002, the panchayat samiti handed the 300-m road leading to the school to two landless farmers. The farmers leased it to one Prabhat Ghosh, who fenced it off. 

 For the time being, the roadblock has been partially lifted. Last evening, block development officer Mohammad Matin, officer-in-charge of the Suti police station, Arup Pal, and block school inspector Soumen Chatterjee removed a portion of the fence to make way for the children.

 Schools being made out of bounds for children is not rare in Murshidabad. At Jibanti village in Kandi, 250 students could not attend school for days as the owner of a plot used as way to the school started building a house. 

 Teachers held classes under trees and beside a bamboo grove till the Kandi block development officer sought ?help? from villagers early this month and one of them let his plot be used as a thoroughfare.

 Bandh over, battle carries on

 Calcutta, Dec. 4: The sporadic violence that marked yesterday?s 12-hour bandh called by Mamata Banerjee was carried over today when a group of alleged CPM supporters ransacked the houses of some Trinamul Congress workers and drove them out. 

 The attack at Regent Park on the southern fringes was apparently in retaliation against their attempt yesterday to enforce the bandh.

 Pankaj Banerjee, leader of the Opposition in the Assembly and Trinamul MLA from Tollygunge, accused CPM rowdies of ransacking at least 15 houses and driving out ?our supporters? from the locality. ?Over 50 people, including women and children, had to leave their homes in fear and are still unable to return. Repeated complaints with the administration have so far fallen on deaf ears,? he said. 

 Police said the trouble was a fallout of yesterday?s ?forced? bandh by Trinamul workers. ?A clash broke out yesterday when some Trinamul workers waving party flags forced some local shop keepers to down shutters. At this, the CPM supporters protested and a scuffle ensued,? said Swapan Pal, officer-in-charge of Regent Park police station. 

 Tension had been brewing since last night when CPM activists retaliated by ransacking a cable network office and a laundry belonging to Biswajit Debnath, a South 24-Parganas Trinamul functionary, Pal added. 

 The local CPM leadership admitted that party workers were aggrieved over yesterday?s attack on them. ?Some of our activists were beaten up by Trinamul workers yesterday after they tried to resist bandh supporters. In retaliation, some of our party workers have ransacked a few houses,? said Swapan Acharya, CPM secretary of the south Jadavpur local committee. 

 Acharya later told a rally that policemen were not arresting Trinamul workers for ?beating up our people?. ?There would have been no trouble if Trinamul workers allowed local shop keepers to run their business as usual yesterday. We acted rightly by preventing bandh supporters from closing down the shops in the locality,? he added. 

 An uneasy calm prevailed as policemen patrolled the area since early this morning. Officials from both Regent Park and Sonarpur police stations have been deployed. 

 Mamata, who was briefed about the incident, asked party functionaries to step up a sustained movement against the CPM?s ?terror tactics?. 

 ?How can the CPM talk about initiating a discussion with us to work out a common strategy vis-?-vis the judiciary?s intervention in curbing our fundamental rights like calling a bandh when they terrorise our workers?? she told party functionaries at an informal meeting during the day.

 However, senior Trinamul leaders said the party would keep mum on the issue ?until feelers come from the CPM?s side?. 

 ?Let the CPM take the lead in bringing all political parties under a common platform to find out ways of upholding our democratic rights guaranteed by the Indian Constitution,? said Trinamul general secretary Mukul Roy.

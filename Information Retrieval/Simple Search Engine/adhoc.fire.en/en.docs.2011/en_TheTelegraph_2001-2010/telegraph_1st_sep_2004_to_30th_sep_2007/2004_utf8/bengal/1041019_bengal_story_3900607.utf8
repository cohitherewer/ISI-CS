 Allies up the heat on party

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 18: The state leaders of the CPI, the Forward Bloc and the RSP today echoed their Siliguri counterparts in threatening the CPM with non-cooperation in the civic body there.

 The CPM, the single largest party in the elections to the Siliguri Municipal Corporation, took the mayor?s post as well as the deputy mayor?s and only offered the allies chairs of three mayors-in-council. 

 Front leaders in Siliguri had alleged that the move was a breach of front convention and refused to accept the mayors-in-council posts. Their state leaders lent support to their anger today.

 At the CPM headquarters on Alimuddin Street, the partners asked front chairman Biman Bose to pick the deputy mayor from among them and threatened to stay away from the board if their demand was not met.

 In the elections, the CPM won 30 seats, and the RSP, the CPI and the Bloc two each. Mayor Bikash Ghosh selected CPM councillor Nurul Islam as his deputy. According to convention, the deputy mayor should have been from the second-largest party. 

 Four CPM councillors ?Mukul Sengupta, Paritosh Das, Partha Chowdhury and Saradindu Chakraborty ? were appointed mayors-in-council. Dilip Singh of the CPM was appointed the corporation chairman.

 ?Since all three of us have won two seats each, the CPM might find it difficult to select the deputy mayor. So, we have given Bimanbabu a free hand to select a councillor from any one of the three parties to the post of deputy mayor,? said a front leader.

 Disabled teen dies after rape

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Pandua (Hooghly), Dec. 4: A 19-year-old disabled girl hanged herself to death after being raped allegedly by the brother of a local Forward Bloc leader when World Disabled Day was being celebrated.

 Shyamapada Santra, 27, the brother of local Bloc leader Umapada Santra, has been arrested.

 On Friday afternoon, the girl, who suffered from polio and was staying with her maternal uncles, was alone at home when Shyamapada turned up. The accused allegedly asked for water and then forced the girl into the room.

 ?Shyamapada then raped the girl. Soon after he fled, the girl went to her neighbour?s house and narrated the entire incident before breaking down,? said Shantu Roy, a maternal uncle. The girl then limped home, he said.

 ?When we returned, the main door was closed from inside. We broke it open and found the girl hanging. She had used a saree,? said Raju Roy, an uncle.

 Early last evening, soon after the news broke, irate residents of Pakihira in Pandua, about 85 km from Calcutta, ransacked the Bloc leader?s residence and tried to set it on fire. The Santra brothers had fled by the time the crowd, mostly CPM supporters, reached their house.

 The situation was brought under control after a police contingent reached the spot.

 The accused was tracked down to Baghati under Mogra police station area this morning and arrested.

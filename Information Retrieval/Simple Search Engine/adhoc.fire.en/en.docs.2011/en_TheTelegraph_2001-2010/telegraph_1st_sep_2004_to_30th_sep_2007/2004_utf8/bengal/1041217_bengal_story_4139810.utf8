Love is blind, so is crime 

Disabled girl raped at home

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

Krishnagar, Dec. 16: A visually-impaired 19-year-old 

girl was allegedly raped at her home in Nadia last evening by two youths of her 

locality.

 Bablu Biswas and Sanjoy Mondal were arrested this morning on the basis of a complaint lodged by the girl?s mother, China Mondal.

 At Dhoradaha village in Karimpur, 190 km from Calcutta, the girl?s mother was out shopping and her father busy at his tea-stall in the local market when the duo sneaked in.

 A police officer said: ?Bablu and Sanjoy entered the house around 7pm. The girl was doing some chores and moving about with the help of a stick. The youths gagged her, forced her to a hut adjoining the courtyard and raped her for about an hour.?

 The two then fled the scene, leaving the girl groaning in pain. Her mother returned around 8 pm and found her crying in the courtyard. 

 Additional superintendent of police Biswarup Ghosh said: ?Neighbours took her to the local primary health centre. When her father Kalu returned from his stall, they advised him to lodge a complaint with the police.?

 Bablu happens to be the brother of Nasser Biswas, a CPM panchayat member. He and Sanjoy are known in the area for being ?musclemen with political links?, the officer said. 

 The girl?s mother said she was initially scared to file a complaint. ?My daughter told me that Bablu and Sanjoy threatened her saying that we should not got to the police. But the village elders asked me to fight back and lodge an FIR. There were allegations of rape against them earlier as well but no complaints were lodged,? said China. 

 Bablu and Sanjoy had been teasing her daughter for a long time. ?She recognised the two from their voices last evening. Some of the neighbours had also seen them near our house,? she added.

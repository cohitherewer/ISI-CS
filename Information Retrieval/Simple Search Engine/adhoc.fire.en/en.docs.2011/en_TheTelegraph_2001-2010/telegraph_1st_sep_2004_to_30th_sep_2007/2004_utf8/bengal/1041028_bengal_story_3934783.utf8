 Private college fee study lined up 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Calcutta, Oct. 27: The state government has set up a five-member committee to review the fee structure of about 50 private engineering colleges in the state. 

 ?There was a demand from some private engineering institutions for revision of the existing fees. A five-member committee will soon begin a review. The fixation of new fees will depend on recommendations of the committee,? higher education minister Satyasadhan Chakraborty said today. 

 The committee, headed by a retired judge, is expected to submit its report within three months. 

 The state government fixed a yearly fee ceiling of Rs 32,000 for each student in private colleges five years ago in line with a Supreme Court directive. The apex court had said that though private engineering colleges did not receive government assistance, the states have the right to fix a uniform fee structure. 

 Officials of the colleges are contending that according to another Supreme Court observation, each state government should review the fee structure every two years to examine whether an upward revision is necessary.

 ?While most other states are reviewing the fees after every two years, the exercise has never been undertaken in our state,? said an official of a private college in Calcutta. 

 The private colleges can now charge a maximum of Rs 32,000 every year for each student as tuition and development fees for studying the bachelors degree courses in engineering. 

 Those studying in government-controlled engineering institutions like Jadavpur University and Shibpur University of Engineering and Science (formerly the Shibpur Bengal Engineering College) pay much lower fees ? Rs 500 every month. 

 Officials in the higher education department said they have received several complaints from guardians and students that a section of the private colleges is charging fees higher than the ceiling. The committee will also examine these complaints. 

 ?The Rs 32,000 per year per student ceiling is being practised in our state for five years. The review of the fee structure has been pending for the last three years. We welcome the government?s move to begin the review,? said P.K. Roy, director of the MCKV Institute of Engineering and Technology, a private college in Howrah.

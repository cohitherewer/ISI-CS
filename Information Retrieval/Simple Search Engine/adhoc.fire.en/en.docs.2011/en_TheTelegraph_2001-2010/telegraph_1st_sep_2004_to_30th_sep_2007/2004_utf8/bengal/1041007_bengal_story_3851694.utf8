 Coming soon: Mars in multimedia at madarsas

 SANJAY MANDAL 

 Tell-tale: A file picture of a channel on Mars once caused by flowing water. It was taken by the Mars Express satellite. 

 Calcutta, Oct. 6: When 

 teachers take up the history of the Taj Mahal or the topography 

 of Mars, students in about 50 madarsas across the state 

 can soon expect lively classes embellished with multimedia 

 presentations. 

 Attempts are being made to put madarsas firmly on the information technology expressway with the West Bengal Board of Madarsa Education signing an MoU with Intel, a software giant, to train teachers in preparing teaching and learning material. 

 After the training, they will conduct classes in computer laboratories of their respective madarsas, where students from Classes VI to XI will be taught various subjects with the help of multimedia presentations. More than 40,000 students are expected to benefit from the tie-up.

 ?Intel is providing training in computer operations free of cost,? said board president Abdus Sattar. 

 The heads of about 44 madarsas have attended two one-day training workshops. From Monday, two 10-day workshops have started for selected teachers simultaneously in Calcutta and Malda. 

 ?This is the first time such a project has been undertaken by the state madarsa board,? Sattar said. The agreement was signed under the board?s technical aided learning system project. 

 ?They gave us an idea on how to operate computers and make CD presentations. It was very interesting and students will be attracted more to their classes,? said Sheikh Mohammad Nuruddin, teacher-in-charge of Akra High Madarsa. 

 ?Two of our teachers will receive training from Intel professionals and they will be our master trainers,? said Tapas Layak, a teacher of the madarsa. 

 Under an earlier agreement with the West Bengal University of Technology, five selected madarsas are scheduled to receive 20 computers each. Officials said a fund of Rs 12 lakh has been created.

 Employment hope

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today regretted the low employment rate among Muslims and promised to address the issue, though the Constitution does not permit job reservations on the basis of religion. 

 ?Muslims account for 25 per cent of our state?s population, but they have only 3-4 per cent of government jobs. The situation is very bad,? he said at a seminar. 

 Bhattacharjee exhorted madarsas to join the mainstream to impart job-oriented education. ?Only 508 madarsas are affiliated to the government while thousands others are operating on their own. A small group is opposing their return to the mainstream. This is suicidal,? he warned. 

 He asked the state minorities development and finance corporation to set up pilot projects for employment schemes in Murshidabad and Malda, two districts with the highest Muslim population.

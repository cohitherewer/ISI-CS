 Howrah, Dec. 11: A club house like the one at Eden Gardens. A modern dressing room with in-house medical facilities and a lush green playing arena, which the Sourav Gangulys and Bhaichung Bhutias will be proud of.

 The corporation stadium in Howrah is set for a makeover and come January sports lovers in the city will get to watch quality football, cricket and hockey from close.

 The Rs 25-lakh renovation undertaken by the Howrah Municipal Corporation is likely to be over by the first month of next year and the stadium would be ready after a six-month break.

 Mayor Gopal Mukherjee said: ?The renovation work would be completed by the first week of January.? He added that by mid-January the stadium would be re-inaugurated and thrown open. 

 ?It will be buzzing with sports in the heart of the town,? said Mukherjee.

 A corporation official, who is part of the revamp, said he was hopeful of Howrah hosting a one-day international some day.

 Sportsmen from the district had to fight bad ground conditions or travel to Calcutta to make their way to the top bracket or keep match fit. 

 Now, they can sweat it out at the new facilities.

 Corporation officials said in the absence of a clubhouse, players, including stars from the big two ? Mohun Bagan and East Bengal ? had to stay inside tents, which did not have any proper facilities. 

 ?Quality accommodation is a must for the players coming here to play football and other games. If proper facilities can be provided, heavyweights of world cricket can be here and big matches hosted,? said an official. 

 Sports bodies, who used to hire the stadium, had started complaining about the ground and other facilities. 

 The corporation officials are hopeful that the end of such complaints is close by.

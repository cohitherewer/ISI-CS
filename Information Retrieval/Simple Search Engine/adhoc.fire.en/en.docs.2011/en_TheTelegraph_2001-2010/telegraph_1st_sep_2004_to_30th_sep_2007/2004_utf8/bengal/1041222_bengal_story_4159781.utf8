 BRIEFS

 Midnapore, Dec. 21: Four tourists from Sarsuna on the southern fringes of the city were killed on their way from Digha as the fuel tank of their car exploded after hitting a trekker.

 The accident, in which four others received burn injuries, occurred on the Digha-Nandakumar road, about 185 km from Calcutta. Contai subdivisional police officer Debashis Deb said Pradip Naskar and Narayan Naskar died on the spot. Two others ? Arun Naskar and an unidentified man ? died later. The injured have been admitted to Contai Subdivisional Hospital. 

 Krishnagar: Ashok Sarkar, 40, who came back from the US after serving a prison sentence in connection with the murder of his American wife, was arrested on Tuesday. He was accused of trying to grab a property at Nadia?s Hanskhali, 75 km from Calcutta, that his aunt got from his father. Police said after Ashok was convicted, his father, a doctor in the US, denied him all his property.

 Darjeeling: The municipality here is mulling the introduction of a ?stay tax? on tourists. A similar levy ? Rs 3 per head ? introduced earlier proved to be a flop and was discontinued.

 Calcutta: Eight fishermen were kidnapped and their boats hijacked on Tuesday from Mandirarkhal in Kultali, South 24 Parganas. The area, in the Sunderbans, is about 120 km from here. A fishermen?s leader said the hijackers have demanded Rs 4 lakh.

 Cancer care in a shambles

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR 

 Calcutta, Dec. 1: Anadi Bhattacharya, 65, a Bankura resident, required urgent radiation for the cancer of throat. 

 He had to come all the way to Medical College and Hospital in Calcutta to get it because the cobalt radiotherapy machine at the Bankura hospital is out of commission.

 The doctors here said he would have to wait his turn. ?His condition is critical, but we can?t help because we have a long list of patients already waiting,? said a doctor. 

 Cancer care is on the verge of collapse, exposing the hospitals in Calcutta to a crushing load of patients from the districts. Two cobalt radiotherapy machines, at the North Bengal Medical College and Bankura Sammilani Hospital, broke down about a fortnight ago.

 The 100-odd cancer patients who receive radiation everyday have no choice but to wait endlessly at home, or head for the city, which is fighting heavy odds.

 ?We already have 160 patients lined up today for radiotherapy and we have stretched the machine beyond its limit,? said Kalyan Bhattacharya, the head of department (radiotherapy) at NRS Medical College and Hospital.

 To make matters worse, the government does not have any annual maintenance contract with the engineers for repairing the machine, apart from the ones in Medical College and NRS. 

 The engineering firm, Kirloskar, which is supposed to repair the machines, has not been confirmed payment. 

 ?There has been no commitment from the government on payment for our services. There is nothing for us to do, but wait,? a senior Kirloskar official said. 

 It is ironic that when the government is harping on reducing the load on city hospitals, it cannot pay Rs 1 lakh for the annual maintenance of machines worth over Rs 1.5 crore. Prabhakar Chatterjee, the director of health services, said he is ?looking into? the problem.

 More SC seats in Assembly

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 14: The number of Assembly seats reserved for Scheduled Caste candidates would go up following the delimitation process, chief electoral officer Basudeb Banerjee said today.

 The seats reserved for SCs will increase from 59 to 68 and there may be changes in the number of seats in individual districts or the number of reserved seats but the state?s total will remain unchanged at 294.

 ?The idea behind the delimitation exercise is to have Assembly segments of roughly the same population,? Banerjee said at Writers? Buildings.

 The last such exercise was undertaken in 1976 based on the 1971 census and the present process will be based on the 2001 census, he added.

 Banerjee said the electoral roll revision would begin across the state from tomorrow and continue till October 15, except in the three seats going to bypolls next month.

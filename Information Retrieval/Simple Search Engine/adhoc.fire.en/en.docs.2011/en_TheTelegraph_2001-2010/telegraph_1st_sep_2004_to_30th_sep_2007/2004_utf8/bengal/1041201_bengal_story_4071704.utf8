 Defiance price: fine, jail or derecognition

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Nov. 30: If the Trinamul Congress goes ahead with its December 3 bandh and violates the norms laid down by the Supreme Court, party chairperson Mamata Banerjee could at best be asked to pay a fine. 

 But should the court so decide ? depending on the circumstances and the extent of the violation ? Trinamul could face derecognition and the chairperson could be imprisoned.

 The high court has said Trinamul should file a compliance report on December 6 on the order the bench gave today. The court will thereafter decide what punitive measures, if any, should be handed out.

 Senior lawyers said the Supreme Court has held the use of the word ?bandh? by any political party as unconstitutional as it implies uses of force and intimidation. ?Thus a political party?s call for a bandh is a gross violation of the Constitution,? said Supradip Roy, a senior advocate of Calcutta High Court.

 Roy pointed out that the Supreme Court had made it binding on political parties to uphold the fundamental rights of citizens. Failure to do so could result in a court recommendation to the Election Commission to derecognise the party, he added.

 ?A recommendation to this effect by the court to the Election Commission would be binding,? Roy said.

 The Supreme Court, while hearing the ban on bandhs first imposed by Kerala High Court, had observed: ?(It is mandatory for all to have) allegiance to the Constitution of India as by law established and to the principle of socialism, secularism and democracy and uphold the sovereignty, unity and integrity of India. This would compel the political parties to respect the fundamental rights of citizens embodied in the Constitution and recognise the fundamental duties enunciated in it.?

 ?It is evident from this that calling a bandh is unconstitutional and those in violation of the apex court?s directive could have to pay the price for it,? said Subroto Mookherjee, another senior advocate of the Calcutta High Court.

 The lawyers also pointed to the recent Bombay High Court judgment imposing a fine on the Shiv Sena, saying it could set a precedent. ?Trinamul would be lucky to get away with a fine,? Mookherjee said.

 Other lawyers said Mamata could attract a term in prison if she came to the court and declared that she had wilfully violated the Supreme Court?s orders and would do so in the future.

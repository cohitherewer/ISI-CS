 Kalyani offers new courses 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Dec. 13: Kalyani University is about to launch a post-graduate diploma course in biopesticide technology as part of its distance learning programme. 

 The one-year course will be the first in the subject in Bengal. The varsity has also decided to start a three-year bachelor?s degree course in computer applications under the same programme. Both courses will be introduced in the coming academic session.

 Vice-chancellor Nityananda Saha said the courses are expected to benefit students who, for many reasons, cannot attend classes daily. 

 ?Biopesticide today is an emerging area and has demand in agro-based industries across the country,? Saha added. 

 Officials said the students, who would have to pay Rs 20,000 for the post-graduate diploma, will be provided study materials prepared by a team of agriculture experts from several universities.

 Those pursuing the six-semester degree course would have to pay Rs 18,000. The university will admit 100 students in each course initially. The number of seats will be increased with the improvement of infrastructure in the 36 colleges under it.

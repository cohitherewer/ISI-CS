 Father in court after ?torture? 

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Nov. 16: There seems to be no end to the woes of aged parents. 

 Even as psychiatrists tried to trace the reasons for the increasing incidents of cruelty against parents, an 82-year old man knocked the doors of Calcutta High Court alleging torture at the hands of his son and daughter-in-law.

 As in several such cases reported till now, police did little to look into the charges levelled by Akhil Acharya of Santoshpur.

 Acharya is one of 10 fathers to have moved the high court against their children in the past three months. Three such cases were reported in Burdwan?s Kalna subdivision in the past three months. The police dragged feet there as well. 

 In two previous cases, the court asked the police to throw out the ?inhuman? sons from home. It also directed them to ensure the parents? security. 

 Pleading on behalf of Acharya, lawyer Pradip Roy narrated how his octogenarian client and his wife were confined to a dingy room in their own house without water during Durga Puja. The couple was often denied food. 

 The court directed the South 24-Parganas superintendent of police to look into Acharya?s complaints and submit a report in a fortnight. 

 ?Such inhuman treatment of parents is unthinkable. There should be a stop to this...? Justice P.C. Ghosh said.

 Acharya, a clerk at a state government office, had to retire early on health grounds. His son Asim got a job in the office on compassionate grounds. 

 Acharya also gave Asim a house after marriage, but the son feared his father might give away his other house to his daughter.

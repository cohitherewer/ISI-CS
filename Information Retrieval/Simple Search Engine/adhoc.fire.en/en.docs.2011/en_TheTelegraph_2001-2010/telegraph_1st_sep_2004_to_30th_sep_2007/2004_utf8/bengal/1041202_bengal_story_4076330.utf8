Calcutta, Dec. 1: The World 

 Bank has promised Rs 600 crore for upgrading the primary 

 healthcare system in the state.

 Announcing this today, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said the World Bank has also agreed to provide financial support worth Rs 128 crore to the technical education sector.

 The World Bank had earlier provided about Rs 710 crore to Bengal under the State Health System Development Project-II. This project was taken up in 1996-1997 to upgrade 214 secondary healthcare units from district to rural hospitals. The project ended last March.

 World Bank representatives led by country director Michael Carter held a series of meetings at Writers? Buildings with finance minister Asim Dasgupta, various departmental secretaries, including chief secretary Asok Gupta, and the chief minister through the day.

 ?A team from the (World) bank has been here for the past few days at the state government?s invitation and has been interacting with different government departments. We feel this is the beginning of a long-term relationship,? Carter said after meeting the chief minister this evening.

 The government has briefed the team about its attempts to restructure public sector units and its plans for technical education, power, roads and transport.

 ?When it comes to lending, we have decided on two or three projects here for the next four years. One of these is the health project where we will soon identify the areas to be covered,? Carter said. 

 He added that a ?review in strategy? had prompted the World Bank to ?intensify? its work in India.

 The chief secretary chaired the meeting with secretaries of the commerce and industry, public enterprises and industrial reconstruction, labour, excise, transport and law departments. 

 Bhattacharjee said the World Bank is also considering vocational training projects at the secondary and higher secondary levels and minor irrigation programmes. ?Lakhs of children are passing out of schools every year. We have to think of their future also,? he said.

 The World Bank is currently focusing on 12 states, including Bengal, that have the maximum below-poverty line population.

 Carter said the institution had kept away from Bengal over the past five years because of a different strategy. ?Our focus and strategy have changed now and the new government in Delhi has been receptive,? he said.

 Asked to comment on the Left?s opposition to foreign direct investment in Delhi and red carpet here, Carter said: ?I haven?t met the Left in Delhi, but am impressed with the pragmatism here.?

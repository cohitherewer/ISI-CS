 Revellers hurtle to death on the road 

 OUR BUREAU

 Oct. 22: Tragedy struck pandal-hoppers and holidayers on Navami as 11 Calcuttans were killed in the city and on their way to Digha.

 Four youths died and nine others were injured when a speeding Sumo hit a tree off EM Bypass this morning. 

 The driver of the vehicle, running at over 100 kmph, lost control near Metropolitan and rammed into the roadside tree around 6.45. Tarak Sinha, 30, who was at the wheel, Subir Dey, 28, Surajit Srimani, 27, and Kartik Das, 27, died on the spot. The driver?s head was severed under the impact of the collision. 

 Another Sumo, travelling at breakneck speed on the Nandakumar-Digha State Highway this afternoon, collided with a bus from the opposite direction at East Midnapore?s Heria, 150 km from Calcutta. Six people were killed and two seriously injured.

 Subdivisional police officer Debashish Bej said the group of eight was from Ghughudanga in Lake Town. ?They were travelling very fast?

 Abhrajit Roy, 48, and his younger son Ashish, 7, were among those injured. His wife, a son of 12, parents-in-law and a friend are no more. The driver has died as well.

 The father and son were first taken to Tamluk Hospital and later shifted to Calcutta.

 Those injured in the Bypass clash were Animesh Bhattacharjee, 27, his sisters Sharmistha Bhattacharjee and Sumita Dutta, their husbands Subhankar Bhattacharjee and Manab Dutta, and Sukanta Banerjee, Tarak Dey, Sumit Mitra and Krishnakanta Banerjee. 

 They were taken to Suraksha Hospital in Salt Lake, from where Sharmistha and Krishnakanta were released after first-aid and Sumita and Manab were shifted elsewhere.

 The condition of Animesh and Tarak was said to be critical. ?Both sustained multiple injuries and are on ventilators,? said the chief executive officer of Suraksha. 

 Five members of a family and eight friends ? all from Baranagar and Cossipore in north Calcutta ? had hired the vehicle last night for a look at the top-draw pujas. 

 They started at 11.30 pm. Subhankar said: ?We saw Bosepukur and were driving towards Chaltabagan, from where we were to return home. The driver was going very fast as he had to take another group to pandals from 7.30 am. We requested him not to hurry, but in vain,? said Sarmistha.

 Inspector-in-charge of Tiljala police station Salil Bhattacharjee said: ?The vehicle first skidded on the right, then left and flew several metres before hitting the tree.?

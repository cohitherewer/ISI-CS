 Deadline over, roads deserted 

 - Maoist threat passes but fear reigns 

 VIVEK CHHETRI 

Pashupatinagar, Sept. 8: A Maoist deadline for a week-long evacuation of this town on the Indo-Nepal border ended today, but the residents ? the few who have stayed on ? still fear the worst. 

 ?As the lights went off last evening, we were sure the Maoists had attacked. It is a strange feeling when you think you could be dead anytime. I only thanked God that my family was across the border and safe. Later we came to know it was only a normal power failure,? said Pradip Agarwal, a Nepalese businessmen of Indian origin. 

 On August 22, Maoist rebels had put up a notice warning residents of Nepal?s Illam district ? Pashupatinagar falls within it ? on the border with Darjeeling to vacate their homes for a week from September 1. 

 While most had cleared out, some like Agarwal decided to stay on. But almost nobody strayed outdoors today. 

 The Zilla Suraksha Samity and the Suraksha Fauj Illam had distributed pamphlets, appealing to people not to leave, but residents openly admitted their lack of faith in the Nepalese government.

 ?There is little the government can do to protect us. That is why I have sent my family over to India. The Maoists could do anything,? said Agarwal. 

 Badri Bikram Thapa, a Nepalese police officer, said: ?There has been no untoward incident reported anywhere today. The entire area is on a heightened security level with the United Force, a special force created to tackle the Maoist problem, guarding all police stations. The deployment of the Royal Nepalese Army has also been strengthened.? 

 On the Indian side, the border was on high alert. The notice had sent Darjeeling police scurrying in fear of another offensive being launched from Indian territory. The police are wary ever since the Maoists used Indian soil to provide cover fire during an attack on Pashupatinagar this April.

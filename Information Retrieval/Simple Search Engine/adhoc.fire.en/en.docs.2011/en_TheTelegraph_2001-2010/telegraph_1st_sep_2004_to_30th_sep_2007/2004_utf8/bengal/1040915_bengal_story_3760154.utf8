 Govt admits English folly

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, Sept. 14: The government today again admitted its mistake in keeping English out of junior school syllabi for almost 20 years.

 The Left Front reintroduced the language at the primary level last year after having resisted popular pressure to do so for years.

 ?West Bengal has suffered immensely due to the withdrawal of English from schools. English has emerged as the language of the technological world, particularly in the IT and related sectors,? higher education minister Satya Sadhan Chakraborty said.

 He was inaugurating a two-day technical education meet organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) in collaboration with the All India Council of Technical Education (AICTE).

 ?Our government is now laying special emphasis on spoken English to increase the employability of job-seekers,? the minister said, stressing that the quality of students has to be improved along with that of infrastructure.

 ?The decision to remove English from junior school education was based on committee reports that assessed the situation as it was then. Over the years, things have changed, and we will reinstate English in the curriculum,? he added.

 After it reintroduced English, the government had on several occasions referred to its previous policy as outdated.

 The objective of the meet, CII (eastern region) deputy chairman Ravi Poddar said, was to focus on how technical education could be made more relevant, discuss expectations of both industry and educational institutes, and address issues like collaborative research and education and developing and retaining faculty.

 ?Technical institutes and executives should identify partners to recognise mutual benefits. An industry-academia partnership could be nurtured to increase quality of education ...,? he said.

 Hinting at greater cooperation, Chakraborty suggested the development of ?centres of excellence? that would generate quality in education and satisfy industry demands .

 Ashok Mukherjee, chief manager, human resources, Tata Consultancy Services, said there was need for private participation as the government was not in a position to invest extensively in education.

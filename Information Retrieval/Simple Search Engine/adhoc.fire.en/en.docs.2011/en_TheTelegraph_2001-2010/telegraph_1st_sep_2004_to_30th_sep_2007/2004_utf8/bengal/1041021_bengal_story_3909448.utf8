 Midday meal, at a price

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Burdwan, Oct. 20: The headmaster and four teachers of a primary school in Kalna have been showcaused for allegedly collecting 50 paise every week from each student for the midday meal that is supposed to be given free. 

 Srikumar Chakraborty, the sub-divisional officer of Kalna, 180 km from Calcutta, slapped the notice yesterday on the teachers of Madhuban Primary School and asked them to reply after the Pujas. 

 ?If the school authorities fail to provide any tangible reason behind raising of the fund from the students, we will take administrative action against the school,? said Chakraborty. 

 Headmaster Joydeb Das said they were not collecting money for distribution of midday meal. ?We are collecting 50 paise from the 165 students of our school for maintenance of the school and its development,? he said. 

 Shahidul Haque, chairman of the Burdwan primary school council, said it is illegal to raise money against distribution of midday meal. ?Our permission has to be sought for raising any kind of fund in the school and that particular school has not sought any such permission from us,? he added.

 Army to save water bodies

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A portion of the east Calcutta wetlands: Idyllic

 Calcutta, Nov. 23: After the Maidan, the Indian Army is taking initiatives to save the wetlands in and off the city.

 It will soon suggest to the government to set up an ?eco-battalion? to conserve wetlands and maintain the ecological balance. 

 On the sidelines of a seminar on the role of the Indian Army in conservation of wetlands, Major General Z.U. Shah, the general officer commanding, Bengal area, said: ?I?m going to suggest to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to set up an eco-battalion.?

 Uttaranchal, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi have already set up such battalions with the help of the Territorial Army and ex-servicemen. ?The endeavour has been very successful in those states. We will approach the Bengal government to follow them,? Shah said.

 He added that the Sunderbans and the east Calcutta wetlands have ?immense potential for eco-tourism? and could be developed by the army, but ?it is up to the state government to allow any activity there. Besides, we have our men but not (financial) resources?.

 There are a large number of wetlands in the east, three of which are internationally acknowledged ? the Sunderbans, the east Calcutta wetlands and Loktak in Manipur.

 Shah added that the army was committed to protecting the environment and beautifying parks, gardens and water bodies in the Maidan. ?The army will not allow any new activity there. Only those ongoing will be allowed.?

 While ruling out imposition of charges on political parties holding rallies in the Maidan, Shah said the army would keep a watch so that the rally restrictions imposed by the high court are maintained.

 This is the third in a series of seminars on environment organised by the army this year. The first, held in Ladakh in May, was on the army?s role in conservation of endangered species. The second, in Jodhpur, was on green governance.

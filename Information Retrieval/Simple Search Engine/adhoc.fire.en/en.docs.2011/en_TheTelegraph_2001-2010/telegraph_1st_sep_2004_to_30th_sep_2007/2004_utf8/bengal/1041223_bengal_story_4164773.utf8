 Twice-married teacher fined twice by HC 

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Dec. 22: Calcutta High Court today fined for the second time a teacher for bigamy and upheld the termination of his services by the school. 

 Four years ago, Justice S.K. Tiwari had fined him Rs 5,000 for marrying again without divorcing his first wife. Today, Justice Indira Banerjee again imposed a fine of Rs 20,400 while upholding his sack order. 

 Pashupati Das, a teacher of Rabindra Vidyamandir in Howrah town, married a woman of his native village near Tamluk in East Midnapore in 1976. Five years later, he married again in another nearby village, without divulging his first wedding. 

 Another five years later, Das? first wife came to know about the second marriage and moved the Tamluk subdivisional court. 

 In 1987, the court found Das guilty and sentenced him to one year?s simple imprisonment and fined him Rs 3,000. The teacher appealed against the order before the district judge of Midnapore. The district judge upheld the court?s order. 

 After the court verdict, the school immediately terminated his service, a decision the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education approved. 

 Das then filed two different appeals in the high court ? one challenging the validity of the district court?s order and another against the termination notice. 

 The appeal against the district court order came up for hearing first. Justice Tiwari modified the order of the Tamluk court and directed the teacher to pay a fine of Rs 5,000 instead of Rs 3,000. He also said Das would have to go to jail for three months if he failed to pay the amount. 

 Unfazed, Das continued the legal battle against his sacking. Bhudeb Bhattacharya, the counsel appearing for the board, today argued before the court that exemplary punishment should be served to Das, who instead of feeling ashamed was knocking on the doors of the judiciary.

 After hearing the lawyers of both sides, Justice Banerjee dismissed Das? petition and upheld the sack decision. She asked Das to pay Rs 20,400 to the secondary education board for wasting its time and money by filing a case against it.

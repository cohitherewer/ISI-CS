 Women policy on state plate 

 SWATI SENGUPTA 

 Calcutta, Dec. 30: The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government is keen to frame a policy that will address all issues related to women?s development and is planning to utilise a visit by Poornima Advani, chairperson of the National Commission for Women, to kickstart the endeavour. 

 Advani is scheduled to arrive on January 7 for a meeting on women?s issues, which will be attended by a host of state and central officials. 

 ?The NCW chairperson wanted to know if the government has a policy on women. We will suggest at the meeting that the state women?s commission be asked to prepare a women policy,? said S.. Haque, secretary of the women and child welfare department. 

 He explained that the women?s commission ? an independent body ? was better placed to prepare a comprehensive policy than his department. ?The response from all departments concerned, I feel, would be better, and being a women?s body, the commission would be able to frame a clear-cut policy without any bias,? Haque said.

 The idea behind framing a comprehensive women?s policy is to address all issues related to women?s development together. ?There are special programmes and schemes on women related to health, education, prisons, home, backward classes welfare, minority affairs, technical education and so on. All of them seek to provide women better opportunities and to bring about social equality... the purpose of framing a women policy is to integrate these so that a single policy can address women as a whole and show what the government plans to do for them in the state,? he added.

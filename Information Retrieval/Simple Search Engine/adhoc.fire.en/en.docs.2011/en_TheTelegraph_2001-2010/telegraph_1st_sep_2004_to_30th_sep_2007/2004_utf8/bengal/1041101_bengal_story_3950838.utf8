 Doctors looted at clinic home

 Behrampore, Oct. 31: A gang of masked dacoits last night raided the doctors? quarters on the premises of a health centre in Murshidabad. 

 Doctors Partha Mahajan and Sangita Saha, who stayed in their quarters adjoining Kandi Block Health Centre in Gokarna, about 220 km from Calcutta, were supposed to bring home their salaries yesterday. They did not.

 The revolver brandishing dacoits looted whatever they chanced upon, yards from a police picket next to a cluster of three one-storey quarters.

 Three men posing as a patient and relatives knocked Mahajan?s door around 3 am. As the block medical officer of health came near the grilled gate, keys in hand, one of them whipped out a revolver and pressed it against his temple. After looting Mahajan, the trio asked him to lead them to Saha?s quarters.

 District chief medical officer of health Sachchidananda Sarkar said he will ask for more security around doctors? quarters. A senior police officer said the dacoits were probably familiar faces and so they were masked.

 Stigma and school slam doors on teacher

 RANJAN LAHIRY

 Burdwan, Oct. 24: Subhas Chandra Dutta, a schoolteacher treated for and cured of leprosy, was not allowed to return to work despite a high court order in 2001. He retired last month a broken man.

 Dutta ran pillar to post for nearly a decade to get back his job at Sonagachhi Primary School in Manteswar, about 180 km from Calcutta, armed with a fitness certificate from Burdwan Medical College and Hospital, where he underwent treatment. He is now planning a fresh petition in the high court and to knock the doors of the human rights commission.

 The school management refused to take him back even after Dutta was cured of his ailment as the district primary school council did not issue a written order to that effect.

 Dutta, who joined the school in 1977, was diagnosed with leprosy in 1988. During treatment, he continued to go to school as doctors had told him his disease was curable and there was no harm in taking classes. 

 But he did not take into account the social stigma still associated with the disease. To the residents of Sonagachhi village, many of whom were his students? relatives, Dutta became a pariah. He stopped attending school following demonstrations by guardians in front of the school and at the panchayat office. 

 The teacher was declared fit by the hospital in 1995. Happy after years, he went back to the school. But the authorities asked him to show the order from the primary school council. 

 Sahidul Haque, the council chairman, said: ?We told Dutta he could rejoin his post if he showed us his medical certificate but he did not keep in touch...?

 Dutta denied not having kept in touch with the council. ?What the chairman said is not correct.? The teacher, who found it difficult to make ends meet, moved the high court in 2001 and got an order asking the district council and the school to reinstate him. 

 Headmaster Nidhiram Sal declined comment. District magistrate Subrata Gupta said there is no bar on a teacher or any other person, suffering from leprosy, to carry on with his work. 

 District chief medical officer S.K. Sarengi said the period of treatment of a leprosy patient should be considered a ?paid holiday?.

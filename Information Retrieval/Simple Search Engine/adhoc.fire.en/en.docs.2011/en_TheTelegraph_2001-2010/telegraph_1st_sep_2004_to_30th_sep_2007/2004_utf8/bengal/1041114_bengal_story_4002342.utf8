 Negligence blows to doctor for baby death

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Siliguri, Nov. 13: The Siliguri sub-divisional hospital where a day-old baby was stolen a week ago is in the news again ? this time over charges of negligence against a gynaecologist and counter charges of manhandling levelled by the doctor. 

 Rajiv Das? wife Chandana delivered a stillborn baby under the supervision of gynaecologist Unmesh Choudhury this morning. An irate Das, alleging negligence, confronted the doctor. 

 Das said Choudhury told him early this morning that mother and child were doing fine and a normal delivery was expected. However, around 9 am, the doctor said the baby was being strangled by the umbilical cord and asked him to get some medicines. 

 ?When I bought the medicines and waited for another two to three hours outside, nobody informed me about the condition of the child. When I enquired about the child, a hospital employee told me that my child had died,? complained Das. 

 ?If the doctor had made timely examinations, my child would have survived. How is it that the doctor could not detect the defects in the umbilical cord even after a sonography?? he asked.

 Das confronted Choudhury when the doctor was leaving the out-patients? department. ?It is true that I hit the doctor. I reacted in such a way because I could not check my anger at the doctor?s nonchalance,? Das said. 

 Police stationed at the hospital since the theft of the day-old baby cooled tempers.

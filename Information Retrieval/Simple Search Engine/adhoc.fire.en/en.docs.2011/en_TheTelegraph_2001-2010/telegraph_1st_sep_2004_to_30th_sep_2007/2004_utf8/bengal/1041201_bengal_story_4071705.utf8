 Medicine meet on, bandh or not

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR

 Calcutta, Nov. 30: When the Left Front wants to tell the world that they do not like bandhs, they know how to do it. 

 Come Friday and the pharmaceutical congress will roll out the red carpet to over 5,000 dignitaries, who will brainstorm to decide the ?role of pharmacists in healthcare system?. 

 The hitch is the bandh. But the chairman of the organising committee ? CPM member of Parliament Sujan Chakraborty ? is determined to take care of that.

 ?I had requested the Trinamul Congress to defer the bandh, but they chose to ignore it,? said Chakraborty. ?I later requested them to exempt us and allow the dignitaries to travel to the venue ? the Science City auditorium ? without trouble. That request, too, was not responded to.?

 But there was no going back on the meet to be attended by delegates from across the country.

 With the ?government?s aspiration to turn Calcutta into the gateway to Southeast Asia?s trade and business? in mind, Chakraborty was firm not to let go the opportunity to have sections of a booming industry in town.

 ?We did not want to change our date because the mandate was in favour of a fruitful meet and not the bandh. We will ensure that the entire congress gets through without a hitch,? the Jadavpur MP said.

 He is still hopeful that the bandh supporters will realise that Bengal?s ?prestige? is at stake. 

 ?The people of Bengal want progress and we will go all out to make the inaugural day of the three-day congress a grand success,? Chakraborty said.

 Organised by the Indian Pharmaceutical Congress Association (IPCA) ? the confederation of five leading associations in the pharmaceutical sector ? the meet will address issues like providing medicines at more subsidised rates and ?good manufacturing practices? by the pharmaceutical industry.

 ?Important decisions will be taken at the congress as the government is scheduled to come out with a clear cut pharmaceutical policy to invite more investment in the sector,? said Abhijit Chakraborty, a deputy drug controller and key functionary of the association. 

 Chakraborty added that issues like drug regulations, industrial infrastructure, patent licensing and training of pharma personnel will also be discussed at length in the congress.

 BRIEFS

 Krishnagar, Sept. 22: Supriya Mondal, 28, and her two-year-old daughter, Dona, were burnt to death in a fire that apparently broke out after a blast around 2 am in their bedroom at Khalsi village, 75 km from Calcutta, in Nadia. 

 Supriya?s 32-year-old husband, Sujit, is fighting for life at a hospital. Police described the blast and the fire as ?mysterious? and was not convinced by Sujit?s uncle?s suggestion of a short circuit. 

 Purulia: Miscreants, suspected to be People?s War Group activists, stopped a government bus travelling from Bandwan to Calcutta at Bansdiha, about 260 km from Calcutta on the Purulia-Bankura border, around 10 pm on Wednesday and looted four rifles, besides jewellery and cash from the passengers. The guns were being carried by two state armed police constables, an NVF and a police constable. The night service bus was heavily guarded because Naxalites are active in the area. 

 Burdwan: Mukul Sheikh was sentenced to life imprisonment for raping a 19-year-old of Bandhmura village. On June 8, 1997, he abducted the girl to Nabadwip in Nadia. She fled after a week and complained he had been raping her. 

 Midnapore: Bapi Jana, 18, was arrested on Tuesday on charges of raping a Class V student at Dantan in East Midnapore. Police said the incident occurred two days ago.

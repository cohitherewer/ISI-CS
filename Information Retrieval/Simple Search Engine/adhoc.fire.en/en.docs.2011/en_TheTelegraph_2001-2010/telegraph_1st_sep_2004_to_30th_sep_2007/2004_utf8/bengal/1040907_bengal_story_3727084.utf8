 British firm to build bridges

 DEBASHISH CHATTERJEE

 Calcutta, Sept. 6: The government will collaborate with a British construction company to connect the Sunderbans hinterland with the city by a string of bridges. 

 The British team, which was on a recce in the area last month, intends to start work by the year-end when the rivers remain quiet. 

 A government official said at least three steel bridges will be built across the Matla river at an estimated cost of Rs 35 crore. The British May Bey and Johnson Ltd has already conducted a study of the river. Stevenson Simon, an engineer, led the British survey team.

 The proposed bridges will connect Basanti, Sonakhali and Sandeshkhali with Calcutta. Once the bridges are built, the Sunderbans will be connected by road with the city.

 The British company will work with the Sunderbans Development Board and the public works department for the construction on a built-operate-transfer basis. 

 Sunderbans development minister Kanti Ganguly said: We are happy that a British construction company is collaborating with the government to build the three bridges on the Matla. The minister added that a road link between the mangrove belt and the city would draw tourists. 

 South 24-Parganas district magistrate Vivek Kumar said the project would be funded by the British company. A team of MLAs, PWD and irrigation officials has been formed to oversee the work. 

 Basanti MLA Subahs Naskar said people of the area had been demanding a road to Calcutta for years. He added: The tourism potential could not be exploited because of communication problems.

 Mamata mouthpiece

 Calcutta, Oct. 13: Mamata Banerjee today unveiled her answer to the Ganashakti ? Jaago Bangla, a 12-page weekly organ of her Trinamul Congress ? in a lacklustre function, says our special correspondent. 

 A host of Trinamul leaders, including mayor Subrata Mukherjee, skipped the function to attend the grand re-opening of the Star Theatre, in which the Trinamul-controlled Calcutta Municipal Corporation played a major role. 

 Keeping in mind that it was Mahalaya, Mamata sang two lines from the late Birendra Krishna Bhadra?s Mahishasuramardini, but did not say a word about Star Theatre. Mamata, who is apparently peeved with Subrata, turned down his invite, saying she would not share a platform with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.

 She promised to turn the party organ, which will highlight the problems of the downtrodden, into a daily in six months.

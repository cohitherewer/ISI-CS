 First-class glut in CU microbiology 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Sept. 2: Despite Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees frequent lament on brain drain, a chunk of high-scoring microbiology graduates of Calcutta University will have no option but to migrate elsewhere for further studies. 

 There is not enough seats in the universitys masters course in microbiology to accommodate its own bright and brilliant.

 The chief minister had often stressed the need to arrest the flow of good students from Bengal to ensure a rich resource pool for new hi-tech industries.

 This year, a record 91 students have completed graduation with 60 per cent or more in microbiology (honours) from nearly a dozen colleges in and around the city, but CU can only accommodate 15.

 When the subject was first introduced four years ago, it was not that sought after. So the rush was not felt when the first batch completed its three-year graduation last year. 

 But with the government weaving dreams of an industrial resurgence and promoting hi-tech subjects the situation changed dramatically.

 Five of the 15 microbiology MSc seats at CU are reserved for scheduled castes, tribes and other backward classes.

 We are concerned. All 91 students have brilliant records, said Shyamapada Pal, a member of the West Bengal Council for Higher Education.

 A member of the university syndicate, its policy-framing body, said: We should have anticipated the situation and made arrangements to prevent them from moving out. 

 Microbiology is also taught in Burdwan and North Bengal universities but there is no such problem there as the number of graduates is less. 

 The syndicate discussed the glut of first-class students at a meeting on Tuesday. 

 Education department officials admitted that microbiology is sought after because it caters to emerging sectors underlined by the government. Higher education officials have been promoting biochemistry, molecular biology and biotechnology as key subjects. 

 At present, the government does not provide financial assistance to colleges for offering a BSc course in microbiology. The expenditure is borne by the colleges.

 We had to pay Rs 700 to Rs 1,000 per month as tuition fees. Besides, as the subject was relatively new, our college did not have proper laboratory and library facilities. Despite many barriers, we performed well but will be denied the opportunity here, said a student who scored a high first-class.

 Walkout on conciliation bill date 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Dec. 22: Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim today announced the Block-level Pre-litigation Conciliation Bill, 2004, (also known as the shalishi bill) would be tabled on Friday, prompting a walkout by the Trinamul Congress, Congress and the SUCI. 

 The Opposition is convinced the controversial bill would be passed by voice vote on that day despite protests, thanks to the brute majority the Left Front enjoys in the House. 

 Trinamul had led strident protests against the bill, which its detractors believe would help the ruling parties induct their own people in village-level conciliatory bodies. The party has decided to observe Friday as a black day in protest. 

 Leader of the Opposition Pankaj Banerjee accused the government of being hasty despite the Opposition?s reservations about some clauses in the bill. It was referred to the business advisory committee following protests when it was placed in the House in August. 

 Though the committee met several times, it could not reach a conclusion on the bill and returned it to the House. 

 The Opposition parties demanded that the government reconstitute the bill before placing it in the House. The Speaker?s announcement has taken the parties by surprise. 

 The bar council, which has been protesting against the bill, said it will organise a sit-in near the Assembly on Friday.

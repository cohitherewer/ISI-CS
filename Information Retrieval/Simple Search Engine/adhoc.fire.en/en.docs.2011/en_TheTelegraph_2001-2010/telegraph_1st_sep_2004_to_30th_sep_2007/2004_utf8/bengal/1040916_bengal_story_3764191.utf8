 Capitation quota poser

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Sept. 15: Calcutta High Court today directed the medical education wing of the health department to produce all documents relating to admission of students willing to pay an enhanced fee of Rs 9 lakh for the MBBS course. 

 The order follows a petition from a candidate willing to pay the enhanced fees ? a euphemism for capitation fee ? demanding transparency in the government?s selection process. 

 The court has asked the government to file an affidavit stating its stand in two weeks. 

 Shirshasindu Dutta, an NRI-sponsored candidate, responded to a notification on July 23 last year seeking applications for the MBBS course by paying enhanced fees. 

 ?In the said notification, the government had announced that students from four categories would be taken to fill up 200 seats. It was mentioned that an equal number of candidates would be given admission from NRI, NRI-sponsored, foreigner and management quotas,? said Laksmi Pal, Dutta?s counsel. 

 Pal said Dutta was called for an interview on August 17, 2003. ?But after the publication of the results, he could not find his name on the selection list. Dutta approached the health department to learn the break-up of the selected candidates? but it declined to reveal the process of selection,? the lawyer said. 

 The government is yet to frame a policy on how many seats should be kept aside for those ready to pay the enhanced fees. A decision on the number of seats to be allotted under the different quotas is also pending.

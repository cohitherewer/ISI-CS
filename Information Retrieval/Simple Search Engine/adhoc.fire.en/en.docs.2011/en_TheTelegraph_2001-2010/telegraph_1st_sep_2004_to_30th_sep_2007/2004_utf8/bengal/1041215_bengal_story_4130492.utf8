 CPM voice for law to save strikes 

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, Dec. 14: CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury today said the party would press for a central legislation to protect the right to strike and organise bandhs. 

 Here for the swearing in of the new governor, the CPM leader said the judiciary is interfering ?with our rights? in the absence of a law. 

 ?It is our fundamental right to go for a strike or organise a bandh in support of our demands and nobody, including the court, can take it away. But the judiciary these days is interfering with our rights??

 The CPM leader said the issue will be discussed at the two-day politburo meeting beginning Friday. ?We shall later inform the Left co-ordination committee about our stand on strikes or bandhs so that it can take up the matter with the UPA (United Progressive Alliance government). We want the committee to put pressure on the Centre to introduce a legislation in the current session of Parliament,? he added.

 Veteran CPM leader Jyoti Basu had said a few days ago that he was ready to go to jail in support of bandhs.

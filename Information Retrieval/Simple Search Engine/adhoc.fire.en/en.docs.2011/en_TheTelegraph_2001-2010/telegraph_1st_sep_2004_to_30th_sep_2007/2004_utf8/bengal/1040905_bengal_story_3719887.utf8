 Ricky returns, incognito

 - Latino singer on Sabera mission

 NISHA LAHIRI

Ricky Martin

 Calcutta, Sept. 4: He came, saw and conquered hearts. And once again, he did it all incognito. 

Ricky Martin breezed into town on Wednesday to visit 

the children of Sabera Foundation, the NGO he supports, ate and played with them, 

watched TV with them, visited a Sudder Street slum with them and packed his bags 

late on Saturday, before you could say Maria. 

 The Puerto Rican singer had last come on a hush-hush visit to Sabera in June 2002. 

 I got an e-mail from his agents on Monday night and had just one day to plan things. Ricky landed here from London on Wednesday, just to see the children and spend some time with them, Carlos Duran, founder-director of Sabera, said from his Kalitala base, near Thakurpukur. 

 And that is exactly what the man famous for advising the world to Shake your bon bon did. He landed up at the Kalitala home on Friday morning, had lunch with the kids and watched the Steven Spielberg classic E.T. with them. 

 Martin, who belted out the 1998 soccer World Cup anthem La Copa Da La Vida, might have kept his singing to the minimum during this trip, but he repeated the football performance of his last trip. He took time out to kick the ball about with some of the children in the slushy fields of Kalitala.

 Most of his time though, the celebrity performer spent in Oberoi Grand. Keeping him company for long stretches were the three little Sabera girls he sponsors. He ate dinner with them at the coffee shop and watched TV in his room. 

 Ricky said he went to Sudder Street one of these days to meet the mother of the three girls, said Duran. He met her and spoke to her. She then introduced him as her friend to some of the other women in the slum where she lives. He was very touched. 

 A couple of his companions were with him throughout. One of them denied access to Martin late on Saturday, saying: He is sleeping He cant be disturbed We are on a fun trip, leave him alone.

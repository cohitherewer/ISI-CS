 OUR BUREAU

 Galsi/Sainthia/Domkal, Sept. 18: At least 13 persons were killed and 50 injured in three separate road accidents at Galsi in Burdwan, Sainthia in Birbhum and Domkal in Murshidabad to day.

 Five members of a Malaysian agency (Garmuda-WCT) overseeing the work of the Golden Quadrilateral project in Durgapur were killed when their Sumo was hit by a loaded truck on the rain-washed G.T. Road at Galigram, about 160 km from Calcutta. 

 The accident took place when the members from the Malaysian agency were travelling from Durgapur to Galsi to inspect a site.

 Traffic ground to a halt for over three hours on G.T. Road soon after. Though police impounded the truck, its driver is absconding.

 The three injured were first admitted to Burdwan Medical College Hospital from where they were shifted to a private nursing home. Police said a Malaysian citizen, Chang Chung Singh, alias Asang, was among the injured.

 In another incident, five persons were killed and 27 injured when a bus fell into a roadside ditch at Gournagar village in the Sainthia police station area, about 210 km from Calcutta this morning.

 The injured were taken to the Suri sadar hospital. Of them, seven were shifted to the Patel Nagar primary health centre after their condition deteriorated. 

 The bus (WGA-5864) was proceeding towards Sainthia from Asansol. Police said five persons travelling on the roof of the bus died on the spot.

 In the third incident, three persons were killed and 12 injured when a lorry lost control and hit the wall of a mosque at Sambhungar in the Domkal police station area, about 235 km from Calcutta, around 3 pm.

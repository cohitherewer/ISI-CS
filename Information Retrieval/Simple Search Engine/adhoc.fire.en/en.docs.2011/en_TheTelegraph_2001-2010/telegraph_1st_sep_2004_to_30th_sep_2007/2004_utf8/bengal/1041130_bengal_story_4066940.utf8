 CPM post tussle in Cong hub 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Behrampore, Nov. 29: A succession struggle is unfurling in the Murshidabad CPM with at least two leaders challenging the expected elevation of Nabagram MLA Nripen Chowdhury as district secretary. 

 Madhu Bag, who has held the post for 24 years, wants to relinquish charge due to his failing health. Chowdhury has been managing party affairs in the district since he took ill. 

 ?I am not keeping well in view of my advanced age. I have conveyed my decision to give up the post to the party leadership. I hope the party will appoint a new secretary at the district conference,? said Bag, who took over in 1980. 

 The organisational changes are expected at the party?s three-day district conference to be held here from January 2 after the zonal committee conferences in December. Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee will inaugurate the conference. 

 Chowdhury enjoys the confidence of Bag and major Left Front partners like the RSP and the Forward Bloc. But Citu leaders Tushar De and Shekhar Saha are unfazed. 

 Asked about his possible successor, Bag said: ?It is for the party to find someone to replace me. However, Chowdhury handled party affairs effectively earlier this year when I was taken ill and spent several days in hospital. Even after my release, he has been carrying out organisational responsibilities. I think he deserves the post.? 

 De, district Citu secretary and member of the district CPM secretariat, is apparently being backed by several district leaders in his bid to succeed Bag. The leader, known to be close to Bhattacharjee, is acceptable to all and has been growing in stature for three years since he was brought to Behrampore from Jangipur for his organisation skills. 

 Another group feels the party needs an aggressive leader like Saha, also a district secretariat member, to take on Adhir Chowdhury. 

 The rise of the Behrampore MP and the Congress in the district marred the second half of Bag?s stint. The Congress has tightened its grip on the district by wresting the zilla parishad and the Jangipur and Murshidabad Lok Sabha seats from the CPM. Adhir Chowdhury retained his Behrampore seat in the May polls. 

 Earlier, the Congress had defeated Left Front nominees in all 23 wards of the Behrampore municipality.

 Bag, however, feels the party workers have learnt from their mistakes and are now more united to face the Congress? challenge.

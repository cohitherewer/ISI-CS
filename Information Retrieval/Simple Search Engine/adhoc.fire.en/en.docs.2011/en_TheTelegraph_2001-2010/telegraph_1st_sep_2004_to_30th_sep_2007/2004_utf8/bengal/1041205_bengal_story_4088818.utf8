 Meet misses Nirupam

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 4: If yesterday the organisers of the Indian Pharmaceutical Congress scripted a success story by pulling off a grand show despite the Trinamul Congress bandh, Day II did much to dampen their spirits.

 The organisers scurried and scanned the venue for business managers to discuss ventures with foreign delegates during the ?regional business hour session? ? one of the most important at the three-day meet ? after commerce and industries minister Nirupam Sen, who was supposed to chair the event, opted out citing ill health. 

 Senior representatives from industries and firms in Jordan, Indonesia, Thailand, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Myanmar and Sudan and senior officials from companies across the country were awaiting Sen. 

 Yesterday, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had appealed to them to join hands with Bengal to establish trade links. Pharma companies in the state were looking forward to today?s meeting because the pharma industry, which is in poor shape in the state, is targeting foreign investments.

 The situation was salvaged somewhat after CPM MP Sujan Chakraborty, Phyto Chemical and Development Corporation chairman Puronjit Mukherjee, Deepankar Dutta Gupta of East India Pharmaceuticals and Dibnath Roy Choudhury, the secretary of the Indian Drug Manufacturers? Association participated in a short discussion with the foreign delegates. 

 Chakraborty, who is the chief organiser, said: ?There was no other choice. We will conduct the business session perhaps at a later date.? 

 However, despite the hiccup, the meeting went off well with firms from Bangladesh, Myanmar and Sudan asking companies here to come forward for joint ventures. A 15-member Thai delegation also evinced interest in possible investments. 

 ?Despite the absence of the minister, there was a lot of positive talk. Once the minister is fit, we will take the discussion forward,? said Abhijit Chakraborty, a senior functionary of the congress and a deputy drug controller.

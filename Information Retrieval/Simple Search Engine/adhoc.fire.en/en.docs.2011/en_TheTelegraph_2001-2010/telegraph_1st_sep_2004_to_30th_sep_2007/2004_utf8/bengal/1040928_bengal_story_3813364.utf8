 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, Sept. 27: The government today ordered a probe into a racket involving its own employees who issued fake SC/ST certificates.

 The employees are said to be spread across South Dinajpur, Malda, Murshidabad, Nadia and North 24-Parganas. A senior official said: ?We have reasons to believe that the racket could not have thrived without help from these rogue employees.? 

 Calcutta: Two elderly men fell victim to rash driving at the Howrah station minibus stand around 9.30 pm on Monday. One of two Harinavi-bound buses trying to outspeed the other hit Ashok Kumar Thakur, 58, as he got down from another bus. The second bus then ran over an unidentified man carrying grocery who was behind Thakur, the manager of a local fish stall.

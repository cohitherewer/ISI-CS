 Another green revolution 

 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE 

 Calcutta, Nov. 20: Bengal, it appears, is set for a green power revolution.

 Generation of renewable electricity is expected to go up from 22 mw to 418 mw in four years with the implementation of various projects undertaken by the West Bengal Renewable Energy Development Agency.

 Out of 418 mw, 400 will be from solar energy. Mini and micro hydel projects will produce 12 mw, tides 3 mw, wind 2 mw and bio-mass 1 mw. 

 ?We do not want to be solely dependent on the government to implement the projects. We would like private-public partnerships,? said S.P. Gonchowdhury, the special secretary in the power department.

 The agency received fresh impetus for generation from the department of non-conventional energy under the Union power ministry, which underscored the need for green power following guidelines set at a conference on renewable energy held in Bonn.

 ?We are trying to utilise local raw materials to generate power. We have already started solar, bio-mass, wind, tidal and mini and micro hydel power projects that feed stand-alone units for individual customers. Now we want to raise the output and connect it with the normal power grid,? he added

 The agency, Gonchowdhury said, has concluded in a survey that about 418 mw can be generated from natural resources in the state. 

 Officials said six solar power plants have been successfully commissioned in the two 24-Parganas, while bio-mass power generation has proved successful in Burdwan.

 Many rice mills in Burdwan are now running on power derived from husk, a by-product of paddy. About 5 mw is being generated from bio-mass. Bengal tops the charts in solar power generation and has about 60,000 users.

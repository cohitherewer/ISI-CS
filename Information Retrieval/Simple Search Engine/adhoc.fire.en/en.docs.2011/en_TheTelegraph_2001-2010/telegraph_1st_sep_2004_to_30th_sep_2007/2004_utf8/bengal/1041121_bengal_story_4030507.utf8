 Robbers? rage 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Nov. 20: Armed robbers stormed into a businessman?s flat this morning in Jorabagan and went on a rampage as they did not find as much money as they expected.

 The goons, carrying sharp weapons and guns, beat up the businessman?s domestic help before leaving with Rs 3,500 kept in a drawer. 

 Police said the dacoits became furious when they found the jute dealer was not present and there wasn?t any cash in three almirahs. ?It seems they had a tip-off. When they found the information false, they turned violent,? said an official of Jorabagan police station. 

 Paresh Bantia had come to the flat, which he visits occasionally, last night after settling some business in the Burrabazar-Posta area.

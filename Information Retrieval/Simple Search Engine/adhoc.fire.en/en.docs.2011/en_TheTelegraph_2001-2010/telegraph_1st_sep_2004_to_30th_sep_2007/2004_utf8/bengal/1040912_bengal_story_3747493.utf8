 Overturned tanker blaze at Bally kills three 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Howrah, Sept. 11: Three persons, including a two-month-old baby, were killed when a private tanker carrying diesel overturned and caught fire tonight on NH 34 (Delhi Road) on the approach to Bally bridge. 

 Fifteen persons were injured, 10 of them seriously. 

 One of the dead was the khalasi (helper) of the tanker; the other two are yet to be identified. 

 The injured, including two children, were rushed to the Howrah district hospital and the Uttarpara state general hospital in Hooghly. Three of them were later shifted to the Calcutta Medical College and Hospital as their condition deteriorated. 

 Police said the tanker turned turtle around 8.20 pm when it hit a pile of stone chips in high speed. The road was slippery due to the rain and the driver lost control. As the metal scraped the road, sparks flew igniting its diesel cargo. The tanker immediately burst into flames, killing the helper sleeping stop the cabin. The driver escaped with injuries. 

 The burning tanker skidded along the road, brushing two scooterists and a cycle-rickshaw. All the commuters were scalded. Some of the flaming oil rolled down the sides of the road and gutted about a dozen shanties. 

 Within 10 minutes, 10 fire tenders from the Bally fire service rushed to the spot. But it took over two hours for the flames to be put out. 

 ?We had to wait for the oil to burn itself out,? said a firefighter. ?There was nothing much we could do. The heavy rainfall helped in controlling the flames.?

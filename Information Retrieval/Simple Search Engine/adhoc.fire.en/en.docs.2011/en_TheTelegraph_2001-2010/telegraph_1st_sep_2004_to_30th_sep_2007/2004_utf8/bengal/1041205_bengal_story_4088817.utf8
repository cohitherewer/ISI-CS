 Relief for Salt Lake litigants 

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Dec. 4: A sub-divisional judicial magistrate?s court was opened in Salt Lake today. 

 Law minister Nisith Adhikari, who was present at the programme, said the court will provide relief to litigants of Salt lake and adjoining areas, who had to travel to the Barrackpore SDJM?s court for filing cases. ?The Bidhannagar sub-division was created a long time ago, the SDJM court could not be set up due to some problems,? he said. 

 The court, housed in the Mayukh Bhavan complex, will function with a judicial magistrate at the helm. It will handle all criminal cases registered with the Bidhannagar South, North and East and Lake Town police stations. 

 Criminal activity has soared in Salt Lake and the trouble of taking all the arrested persons to court in Barrackpore prompted the government to hurry up. 

 ?The proposal for a court in Salt Lake was there. But three police stations of the area were facing a problem producing those arrested in court as Barrackpore is quite far away. The police put pressure on the government to set up the court quickly,? an officer of judicial department said. 

 Inaugurating the court, Calcutta High Court judge Ashok Kumar Ganguly tried to bring down the friction generated over bandhs between the administration and the judiciary. ?The judiciary and the administration are two pillars of the democracy and one works in tandem with the other,? he said, in the light of allegations of the judiciary?s interference in ?administrative affairs?.

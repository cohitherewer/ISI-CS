 Double trouble for Metro

 A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta, Sept. 25: A suicide on the tracks 

of Girish Park station followed by a short circuit at Rabindra Sadan crippled 

Metro services for over two-and-a-half hours, sending commuters in a tizzy. 

 Around 1.30 pm, an angry mob ransacked the station master?s office at Girish Park. 

 At 11.50 am, a 35-year-old youth jumped on the tracks as a down train was pulling in. He was crushed before the driver could slam the brakes. Power was immediately cut off to the down line and an attempt began to pull out the body. 

 With the power off, services along the down line came to a halt but trains continued to ply on the up line. ?The rescue operation continued for over an hour, during which the Metro Railways put in place truncated services between Maidan and Tollygunge in the down line,? said a Metro Railway spokesman. 

 The second blow came within an hour as attempts were being made to restore services. Officials at the control room found that one of the four DC circuit-breakers of the Metro Railway sub-station near the Nehru Children?s Museum had tripped, possibly due to a short circuit, plunging Rabindra Sadan station and its adjacent tunnels into darkness. 

 Police and senior Metro engineers rushed to the power hub, from which smoke was billowing. Two Metro fire engines were pressed into service to control the fire. 

 Underground, services ground to a halt, leaving hundreds stranded on platforms and in the rakes, claustrophobic and breathless in the dark as the air-conditioning plants also shut down. 

 The disruption continued for two hours and services were restored at 2.45 pm.

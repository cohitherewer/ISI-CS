 HC bar on fresh liquor permits

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Nov. 24: The high court today passed an interim order restraining the government from issuing fresh licences for liquor shops and bars anywhere in Bengal without permission.

 Justice P.C. Ghosh passed this directive on the basis of a writ petition by the Bengal Excise License Holders? Association challenging the validity of a government circular issued last year announcing 1,000 more licences for liquor shops and bars (for foreign and country liquor) across the state.

 In its circular, the government said it had decided to issue one liquor shop licence for every 18,000 people. The circular asked district collectors to send in a list of those seeking licences.

 The excise department prepared a list, fixing quotas of licences for liquor shops in every district. It was decided that among others, North-24 Parganas would get 106 more licences, Calcutta 38, Bankura 39 and Birbhum 37.

 Appearing for the petitioners, Arunava Ghsoh and Anant Shaw challenged the circular?s legality and told the court that issuing a licence for every 18,000 people was not in keeping with the Excise Act. ?The act has clearly said that the district collectors, on the basis of public demand, would request the government for fresh licenses,? the lawyers said.

 The lawyers also told the court that the collectors of Birbhum, Burdwan and North Dinajpur had declined to accept fresh licences and told the government no further liquor shops were needed in their districts.

 Appearing for the state, Joydeep Kar said the government had decided to issue more liquor shop licences to stop widespread sale of illicit and illegal liquor.

 He added that hundreds in rural Bengal were dying after consuming illegal and poisoned liquor. ?The court should realise the problem of the government,? Kar said.

 Justice Ghosh said it was the police?s duty to stop the sale of illicit liquor. ?What is your police doing?? he asked Kar. The matter will again come up for hearing again after eight days.

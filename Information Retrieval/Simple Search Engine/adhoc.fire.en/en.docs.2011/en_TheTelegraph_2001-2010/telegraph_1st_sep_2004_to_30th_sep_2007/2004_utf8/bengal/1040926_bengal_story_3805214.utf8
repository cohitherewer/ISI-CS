 Buddha vow

 ANURADHA SHARMA LAKHOTIA

 Siliguri, Sept. 25: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today made a slew of promises ahead of the Siliguri Municipal Corporation elections scheduled to be held on October 3, including upgradation of the Bagdogra to an international airport and getting more investment into the region.

 ?We want to make Bagdogra airport the second international airport of the state and operate flights for Dhaka, Bhutan and Nepal,? said the chief minister.

 Tourism will be a focus area, Bhattacharjee said at public rallies at Ghogomalu and Baghajatin Park. ?We will strive to get more foreign tourists to this region, which abounds rare flora and fauna,? he said.

 In information technology, too, Bhattacharjee said Siliguri has been given preference for investment by big firms. He also promised a flow of investment into agriculture.

 The chief minister did not miss out the weaker sections. ?We must look after the poor. Lot of work remains to be done,? he said.

 Bhattacharjee promised drinking water and a drainage system for the 17 wards from Jalpaiguri district that were included in the Siliguri body in 1994, where civic services had taken a backseat.

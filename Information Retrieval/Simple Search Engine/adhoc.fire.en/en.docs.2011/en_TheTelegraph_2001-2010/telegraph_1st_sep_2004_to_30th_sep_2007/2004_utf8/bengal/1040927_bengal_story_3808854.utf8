 Planner rap

 Bolpur, Sept. 26: Planning Commission member Balchandra Mungekar said here today Bengal records high unemployment because of a ?faulty education policy? that it followed till a few years ago.

 Mungekar, who handles education, labour, employment, youth affairs and social justice, said: ?Though over the past 10 years Bengal has a faster economic growth compared to others...it recorded a high percentage of both educated and uneducated unemployed.?

 ?The unemployment rate is high because the state followed a century old education policy till the last decades of the last millennium. Following the education policy introduced in 1835, was a mistake,? he added.

 He also pointed out that due to this policy the chances of generating new employment scopes had become less. He underlined the need to make changes in the education policy to bring down unemployment.

 he added. 

 ?Introduction of profession oriented courses, vocational courses, courses on diversified agriculture like floriculture may help to get jobs,? said he. 

 Mungekar said he would meet finance, education and labour ministers tomorrow. He will also call on veteran CPM leader Jyoti Basu.

 He said during his meetings with the ministers he would like to know the policies adopted by the state on several issues, including education and unemployment. 

 Asked about the current controversy over inclusion of representatives of World Bank, Asian Development Bank and McKinsey in the Planning Commission, Mungekar declined to comment. 

 Ends.

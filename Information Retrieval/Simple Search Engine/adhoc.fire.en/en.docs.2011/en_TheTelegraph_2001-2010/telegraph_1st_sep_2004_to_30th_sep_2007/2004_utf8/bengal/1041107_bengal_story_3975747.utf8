 1 dies as parties clash

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Jhargram, West Midnapore, Nov. 6: A local CPM worker was killed and a member of a Jharkhand party received bullet injuries when the two groups clashed in some villages under Jamboni police station in West Midnapore district.

 The CPM has called a 12-hour bandh tomorrow at Jamboni, 185 km from Calcutta, to protest police inaction. The party?s leadership alleged that the police had failed to arrest those involved in the murder of Baidyanath Das (35), a local party leader. 

 Angry CPM supporters also attacked police vehicles, staged a string of road blocks and organised rallies in the area.

 Residents of Jhargram said the clash started yesterday afternoon when CPM supporters attacked the Jharkhand party members of Darangbahara village under Jamboni police station. Jagan Hembram of the Jharkhand party sustained bullet injuries and was admitted to the Jhargram sub-divisional hospital. 

 In retaliation, the Jharkhand activists raided the CPM-dominated Damuria village this morning. CPM supporters alleged a few hundred Jharkhand activists, armed with deadly weapons, attacked them and murdered Das.

 West Midnapore superintendent of police Vineet Kumar Goel said the situation is under control.

 ?Adequate police arrangements have been made to avert any untoward incident,? he said.

 Jharkhand activists allege that Das had led the attack on Hembram ?He (Hembram) is still fighting for life at the hospital,? said an activist.

 The CPM countered that the in-charge of the Oarn police outpost had connived with the Jharkhand activists to kill the CPM supporters. ?Sub-Inspector P. Santra, the in-charge of the outpost, should be brought to book for his nexus with the Jharkhand party members,? claimed Amar Basu, a local CPM leader.

 Players? bail plea 

 Calcutta/Chinsurah, Nov. 8: Footballers Sasthi Duley and Dipankar Roy moved Calcutta High Court for bail today.

 The East Bengal players, who have donned national colours, were taken into custody last Monday following the arrest of gangster Dilip Banerjee. 

 Dilip was picked up from Duley?s house at Haripal in Hooghly and Roy had allegedly introduced him to the Duleys. The counsel for the footballer duo, Joymalya Bagchi, said the bail petitions would be heard tomorrow. 

 Duley and Roy have been charged with criminal conspiracy, giving shelter to a criminal and hushing up evidence. 

 The man in charge of Haripal police station, Sachindranath Pariya, today became the second officer to be transferred in the wake of the arrests. Salt Lake subdivisional police officer Humayun Kabir, who arrested Dilip, was earlier transferred to a lesser post for not abiding by ?ethics?. 

 The Haripal officer-in-charge has been sent to Serampore police station, where he will serve as a sub-inspector. 

 Hooghly police chief Ajay Kumar said Pariya?s transfer was ?routine?, but officials admitted in private that he was ?shunted? because of his ignorance about a dreaded criminal hiding in his backyard for months.

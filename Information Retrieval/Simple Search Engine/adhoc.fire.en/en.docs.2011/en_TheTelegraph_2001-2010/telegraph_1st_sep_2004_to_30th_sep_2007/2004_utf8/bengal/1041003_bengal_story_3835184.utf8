 Cop cover for Siliguri polls

 ANURADHA SHARMA LAKHOTIA

 Siliguri, Oct. 2: A tight security cover has been put in place to foil any attempt to trigger violence during the polls to the Siliguri Municipal Corporation, which are less than 24 hours away.

 The police are keeping a special watch on the 15-odd wards where the contest between the CPM and the Opposition Trinamul Congress and Congress is likely to be keen. Three platoons of the Rapid Action Force will be deployed in these wards, apart from other security personnel.

 The Darjeeling superintendent of police, Rajeev Mishra, said five police officials, including one officer, will man every booth. Three additional superintendents of police and six deputy superintendents of police will oversee the arrangements. Additional forces have been brought in from adjoining districts, Mishra said.

 The Left is confident that it will win at least 40 of the 47 seats, but Opposition parties claim they will increase their share if the elections are free and fair.

 ?Going by the feedback from our campaigning, we are very positive that we will be able to win at least 40 seats,? asserted Bengal urban development and municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya. The Left Front has fielded candidates in all the 47 wards.

 However, the Trinamul Darjeeling president, Gautam Deb, said his party will be able to bag 24 seats and, with the support of its coalition partners, will be able to form the board. Trinamul is contesting 30 wards, supporting the BJP in eight, and Independent candidates in three wards.

 Opposition parties said they anticipated trouble. ?Today we have submitted a deputation to the district magistrate, Ariz Aftab, and the sub-divisional officer, Gopal Lama, demanding special security arrangements in all the 17 wards where the situation is tense,? said Deb.

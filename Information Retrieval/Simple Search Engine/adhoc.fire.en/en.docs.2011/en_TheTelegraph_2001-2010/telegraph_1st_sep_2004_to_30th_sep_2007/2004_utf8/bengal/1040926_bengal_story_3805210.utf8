 Patient ire hits hospitals

 OUR BUREAU

 Sept. 25: Mobs ransacked a city hospital and a nursing home in Howrah ? against negligence and ill treatment of patients and their relatives ? in separate incidents today.

 The relatives of Shankar Kumar Ghosh who died this afternoon allegedly broke the window panes of a city hospital. They later lodged a complaint with the Phulbagan police station alleging negligence in treatment.

 Ghosh was admitted to the hospital on Thursday with an infected wound in his left hand. He was operated upon yesterday and ?was fine? till this morning, police said. But Ghosh died this afternoon. 

 In Howrah, over 100 Youth Congress activists this morning ransacked a nursing home that had not released the body of a week-old baby for five days. The nursing home authorities kept the body as the baby?s parents were unable to pay dues of Rs 6,000.

 Youth Congress supporters waving party flags marched to the nursing home around 11 am and shouted slogans against the authorities. They stormed the nursing home, ransacked furniture and smashed widow panes and doors.

 Police from Shibpur police station reached the spot and resorted to a lathicharge. The mob pelted stones at the police personnel, injuring four of them. The protesters then blocked G.T. Road for over an hour to protest against the high-handedness.

 The Howrah police superintendent, Mihir Kumar Bhattacharya, said they had arrested 64 persons who were later released on personal bonds.

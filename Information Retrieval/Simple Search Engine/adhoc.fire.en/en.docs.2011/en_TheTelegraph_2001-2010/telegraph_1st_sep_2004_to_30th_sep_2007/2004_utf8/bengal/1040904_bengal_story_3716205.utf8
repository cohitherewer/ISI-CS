 Security recce at Tagore varsity

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Santiniketan, Sept. 3: University Grants Commission officials are here for the past two days discussing the funds required for a Visva-Bharati security step-up.

 The university authorities had sent a Rs 12-crore plan to the UGC for the revamp of the security system on the campus following recommendations of an eight-member committee. The panel headed by retired IPS officer Sujit Ghosh was constituted on March 30, a week after Rabindranath Tagores Nobel medal and other memorabilia were stolen from Rabindra Bhavan.

 The committee submitted its final report, comprising 37 recommendations, in June. After the university executive council gave it the nod on June 24, the report was sent to the UGC with a request for funds. 

 Over the past two days, UGC deputy secretary M.S. Yadav and financial adviser Pavan Agarwal were detailed about the plans and the proposals and presented a slide show. 

 We discussed the proposed security arrangements threadbare with the two UGC officials yesterday. They advised us to prepare a list on priority basis and send it so that the UGC can send us the grant in instalments, vice-chancellor Sujit Basu said.

 District magistrate Barun Roy, superintendent of police Akhil Roy and some ashramites were among those present at the meeting. 

 Supriya Mukherjee, an ashramite and a former teacher, said the residents are not opposed to the move to tighten security on the campus as long as it is in tune with the ideals of Tagore.

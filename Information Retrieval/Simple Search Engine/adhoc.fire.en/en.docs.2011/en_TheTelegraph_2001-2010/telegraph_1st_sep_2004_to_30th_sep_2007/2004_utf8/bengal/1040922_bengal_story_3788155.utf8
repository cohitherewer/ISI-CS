 Wait for letters before job

 NARESH JANA

 Midnapore, Sept. 21: Over a thousand prospective primary school teachers have been denied jobs for months by the East Midnapore Primary Education Council, which does not have money to send appointment letters by registered post.

 In February 2003, the council had issued newspaper advertisements to fill up 1,270 posts. In all, 1,165 candidates applied. Out of them, 1,020 had the required basic training in primary education. Interviews were held on December 28. However, none of the selected candidates has received an appointment letter.

 Council chairman Debakinandan Das Mahapatra said he is trying his best to despatch the letters. ?There are some technical hurdles which we are trying to overcome. The candidates will get their letters soon,? he added. 

 What Mahapatra meant by ?technical hurdle? was the lack of money to send the letters by registered post. 

 A council member who did not want to be named said: ?All the successful candidates are entitled to get the jobs. We will need about Rs 80,000 to send the appointment letters either by courier or registered post. But we don?t have the funds.? 

 Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited snapped the council?s telephone connection after it failed to clear arrears. Its electricity dues are mounting. 

 Sources said the council?s financial condition was a result of the government?s decision to stop all grants to it three months ago. 

 School education minister Kanti Biswas stopped the grants after the council failed to recover about Rs 8 lakh from its accountant, Pulak Bag, who allegedly misappropriated funds. Bag, who had been charged with defalcation of about Rs 15 lakh, was persuaded to give back Rs 7 lakh. However, he did not return the rest and is now absconding.

 A leader of the All Bengal Primary Teachers? Association, .K. Das, said: ?There are are only about 9,000 teachers in 3,216 primary schools in the district. You can imagine the state of the institutions where several posts are vacant.?

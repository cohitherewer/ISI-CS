 Suicide case bail

 Calcutta, Sept. 17: Amalendu Bikash Saha and his wife Anita, who were arrested after the sensational murder of six members of his brother?s family and the suicide of his nephew, were granted bail today as police failed to charge them within 60 days of arrest. 

 The additional chief judicial magistrate asked the couple to appear before the investigating officer and the officer-in-charge of Charu Market police station every week. Shibendu Saha committed suicide apparently after killing his parents, wife, two children and brother on July 18.

 BRIEFS

 Chinsurah, Dec. 9: Seven Naxalites were arrested last night from Atpur village in Jangipara, about 30 km from Calcutta, when they were distributing leaflets about the proposed rally of pro-Naxalite outfits in Calcutta on December 15. A mobile phone was seized from one of them. 

 Police said they were not only distributing leaflets, but ?instigating people to defy the law of the land and revolt against the police and army of the country?. 

 Calcutta: Ganesh Mahata, 35, was shot dead by a miscreant near Akra Fatak on the southern fringes of the city. Police said Ganesh was sitting at a tea stall when one Akhtar Sheikh came up to him around 9.30 pm and fired from point blank range. The assailant tried to flee after pumping in the bullets, but people caught him. He was handed over to the police. Ganesh was taken to a local hospital, where he was declared brought dead.

 Howrah: Author Dominique Lapierre inaugurated a centre for excellence at Katila in Uluberia. He funded the centre which will provide free education and treatment to 385 disabled children between three and 15 years.

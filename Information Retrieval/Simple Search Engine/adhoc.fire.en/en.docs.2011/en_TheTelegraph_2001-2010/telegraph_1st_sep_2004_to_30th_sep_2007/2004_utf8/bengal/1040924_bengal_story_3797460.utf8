 Hand of rebels in rifle raid

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Purulia, Sept. 23: It has 

 been confirmed that the ?dacoity? last night on a government 

 bus bound for Calcutta from here in which four police rifles 

 were snatched was committed by Naxalites.

 A lull in rebel activity in the Purulia-Bankura-West Midnapore belt was broken even as police today detained 11 people and suspended three of the four constables ?escorting? the passengers.

 Inspector-general (western range) Jogesh Chatterjee, deputy inspector-general (Midnapore range) Anil Kumar and the superintendents of Purulia and Bankura were among the senior security personnel who went into a huddle this morning at Ranibandh police station, about 50 km from the scene of the heist.

 Eleven days after the chief minister ?challenged? the Naxalites at a public meeting in Jhalda near here, nine armed men boarded the South Bengal State Transport Corporation bus that leaves Bandwan at 8.45 every evening posing as passengers. They had bought the tickets in advance.

 In the bus, which had about 60 passengers, they sat in twos ? in the front, middle and rear. As it crossed Kuilapal, about 11 km into its journey, one of them asked for matches from a colleague in front. As the two met in the aisle next to where the four constables were seated, one of them threw chilli powder even as another near the driver held a carbine to his head. 

 As the driver slammed the brakes, the rebels fled.

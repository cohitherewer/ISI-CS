 Drunk duo rapes in rail waiting room

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhadreswar, Sept. 18: A 

 45-year-old woman was allegedly raped by two youths inside 

 a waiting room a few yards off the Bhadreswar railway station 

 in the wee hours today.

 The drunk youths ? Bapi and Bulua ? entered the waiting room around 2.30 am and raped the woman after shooing out others from the waiting room.

 According to police, the youths first smashed the lights and stripped the woman. Then Bulua held her down and Bapi raped her.

 With no railway personnel around, the incident came to light when those who were turned out of the waiting room returned and heard the tale from the woman.

 Bhadreswar police station has registered a case under Section 376 (relating to rape), Section 354 (relating to molestation) and Section 109 (abetment to crime). 

 The victim has been sent for medical examination to Chandannagar hospital. An arrest warrant has been issued against the youths who are absconding.

 The incident comes a week after a similar attempt inside the barracks at Haroa in North 24-Parganas. Panicky locals demanded the arrest of the youths soon after the news was splashed across Bhadreswar.

 Amid trading of charges between the railway police and its counterparts in Bengal, district police superintendent Ajay Kumar said an all-out effort had been launched to trace the culprits. 

 The youths are believed to be sons of a railway official who lives in quarters close to the railway station.

 According to Biswanath Das, one of those who were asked to leave the waiting room, Bapi and Bulua barged inside and screamed and threw out all the people sleeping inside.

 This was minutes after the last local train for Asansol had left the station.

 The duo then locked the gates, smashed the lights and attacked the lady. People in the area later informed the police after which a case was lodged.

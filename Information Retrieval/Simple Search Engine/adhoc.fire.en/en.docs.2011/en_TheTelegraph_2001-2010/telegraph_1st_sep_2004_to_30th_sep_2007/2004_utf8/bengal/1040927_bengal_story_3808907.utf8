 BRIEFS

 Behrampore, Sept. 26: A 68-year-old retired assistant sub-inspector of police, Satyen Sarkar, allegedly hanged himself last night, 17 years after his twin brother Narayan did the same.

 Police said both brothers from Colony Para in Murshidabad?s Beldanga, 180 km from Calcutta, had started as constables. Satyen?s son Siddhartha said after his uncle committed suicide, a doctor had asked them to keep his father under watch as twins often die similar deaths. ?We kept an eye on him for a few years but then we ignored the caution. There was no trouble last night and my father went to bed after dinner as usual,? he said. 

 Calcutta: The Congress will launch an agitation against members of the CPM-run Sabang panchayat samiti in West Midnapore who passed a ?no-confidence motion? against the block development officer and demanded his ouster. ?The BDO had refused to support irregularities,? said general secretary Manas Bhuniya.

 Dogachhi (Nadia): Driven by poverty and the ?ignominy? of giving birth to three girls, Namita Sardar, 25, poisoned herself and her daughters aged five and three. Her youngest daughter, an eight-month-old, escaped as only a few drops of pesticide were poured down her throat. Policemen who came to the village, 100 km from Calcutta, said Namita was under pressure because of the girls and growing penury.

 A dacoit prays for pardon

 RABI BANERJEE

 Omar Ali: Turning a new leaf

 Thanarpara (Nadia), Nov. 20: ?Please forgive me,? says a man with flowing beard and folded arms to the gentleman who opens the door to him. 

 A short conversation later, he knocks on another door. ?Please forgive me,? he says again, and continues: ?Aami jani ami tomader onek dukkher karon. Aami kshama bhiksha korchhi. Tomra kshama korlei Allah amakey kshama korbey. (I know I have caused you a lot of misery. But I am begging forgiveness. Only if you do, Allah will).?

 Donning a white cap and dressed in a white kurta and chequered lungi, 50-year-old Omar Ali goes door to door begging forgiveness. 

 He had once looted the houses he now visits. The former dacoit is a farmer trying to lead a reformed life.

 At Karimpur, 190 km from Calcutta, Ali spent the past few weeks doing the rounds of Panditpur, Gomakhali, Natidanga and Pahasilnagar. 

 Over three decades, he has been charged with committing dacoities in Nadia and neighbouring Murshidabad. He was arrested several times and has walked in and out of lock-ups. He is now on bail with cases against him pending in courts in the two districts.

 A resident of Panditpur, he sets off from home early in the morning, a Quran in hand. 

 He has visited over 40 houses yet. Barring one, Ali says each one has forgiven him for his crimes. ?Every one says it is good that I am repenting for my crimes,? he says.

 Five years ago, Ali says, he decided to lead a reformed life after Suleman Sheikh was killed in a clash with villagers in Domkol, Murshidabad. ?He was a very close friend?He breathed his last on my lap when we went to commit a dacoity at Kuchumora village in Domkol. When villagers chased us, all my gang members fled. I could not?. A bullet was lodged in Suleman?s chest.? 

 That was the last time he went to loot. Ali worked as a daily labourer and then, with his savings, purchased 2 bighas on which he now cultivates.

 But returning to normal life was not to be easy. Villagers looked at him with suspicion. ?Whenever my wife and children came out of house, abuses were hurled at them. Even little boys started calling me names. Sometimes I was angry, sometimes hurt,? Ali says. 

 Unable to bear the taunts, he went to the imam of a local mosque, who told him to go door to door seeking forgiveness. 

 Mohammad Kamrujjaman, a resident of Panditpur whose father Abdul Hamid was killed during a raid by dacoits allegedly led by Ali, has now forgiven him. ?My father was killed in 1996. Now Omar is a different person,? he said.

 However, Ananda Biswas of Natidanga, a garment trader, cannot forget his house being looted 10 years ago and so, cannot forgive. ?I still remember the day... I will not be able to forgive him,? he said.

 Nadia superintendent of police Benoy Chakraboarty said Omar would have to bear whatever punishment the courts decide for him.

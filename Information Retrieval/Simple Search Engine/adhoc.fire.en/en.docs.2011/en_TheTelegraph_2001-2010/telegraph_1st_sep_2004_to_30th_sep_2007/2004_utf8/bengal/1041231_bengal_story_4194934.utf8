 Laloo guides Ghani train to Balurghat 

 OUR BUREAU 

 Dec. 30: Laloo Prasad Yadav chugged into Bengal today with a bouquet of goodies, presenting South Dinajpur its first tracks, inaugurating several new routes and indicating that fares were likely to remain unchanged. 

 ?We do not need to raise fares to increase revenue. All we need to do is ensure that the railway employees do not steal money and passengers do not indulge in ticketless travel. I have already set in motion steps to ensure this,? Laloo Prasad told the thousands who had gathered at Balurghat to watch him flag off the inaugural ? and first-ever in the district ? passenger train to Malda station via Eklakhi. 

 Prompted by guest Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, the Union water resources minister, the railway minister added: ?I am giving my word that the Atreyee Express will run to Calcutta from here as will the 1942 Express to Guwahati.? 

 The two are new trains that were proposed by a committee lobbying for the track that was inaugurated today. 

 A decision on extension of the track from Balurghat to Hili will be taken after he goes through the files in his ministry, he said. 

 ?I had inaugurated this project in 1983 only after getting the green signal from Indira Gandhi. I thank Laloo Prasad for completing the project, which had been put on the backburner for so long,? said A.B.A. Ghani Khan Chowdhury, former railway minister and Malda MP. 

 At Jiaganj in Murshidabad, Laloo Prasad laid the foundation stone of a 300m bridge over the Bhagirathi. Later, 5 km of track would be laid to link Murshidabad station directly to Sealdah. He promised that the project, costing Rs 46.7 crore, would be completed in two years.

 He added that railway employees were donating a day?s salary, totalling Rs 15 crore, to the Prime Minister?s Relief Fund. 

 He travelled to Bankura, where he opened the Mahendralalnagar-Amta route and laid the foundation stone for the Bankura-Chhatna-Mukutmanipur link. He also presided over the start of train services in the Kanthi-Digha section.

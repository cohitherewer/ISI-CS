 After baby theft, a riot

 KUHELI CHAKRAVORTY

 Siliguri, Nov. 7: A rampaging mob protesting against baby-lifting tore through Siliguri subdivisional hospital today, venting its fury on everyone and everything in its path.

 Patients, nurses, office furniture ? nothing was spared in the 15-minute frenzy sparked by the theft of a child that rocked the hospital yesterday.

 A patient in the female surgical ward had her saline drip ripped out and two nurses, Rita Biswas and Sangita Ganguly, had to be admitted to the hospital with injuries. Other patients were more lucky, getting away with minor injuries, mostly from splinters from broken windowpanes.

 The mob mainly comprised residents of Jyotinagar Colony, where Champa Sarkar stays with her family. 

 Sarkar?s child was stolen by Sangita Prasad, the patient next to her on the floor of the maternity ward. Prasad fled with the baby when Sarkar went to the toilet, keeping him in her charge. The baby?s whereabouts are still unknown.

 The violence began as a deputation around 11 am, the visiting hours in the hospital. Around 150 people had gathered to meet chief medical officer of health Taraknath Chattoraj, who was scheduled to visit the hospital for an inquiry.

 ?The crowd started shouting slogans against us, blaming us for the incident,? said ward master Suvendu Halder. 

 ?Then all hell broke loose. The mob barged into the emergency ward and assaulted a nurse. They ransacked the ward and the ward boys? office, smashing windows and breaking furniture,? he added.

 Only a handful of policemen were present at the hospital when the violence erupted. The mob ran riot until reinforcements arrived and a lathicharge was ordered.

 ?I was asleep when the roar of the crowd and the sound of window panes being smashed woke me up,? said Mousumi Rai, a patient in the surgical ward. ?Suddenly, a woman ripped out the saline drip from my arm. The other patients went scurrying for shelter.?

 After the incident, at least three patients opted for early discharge out of fear.

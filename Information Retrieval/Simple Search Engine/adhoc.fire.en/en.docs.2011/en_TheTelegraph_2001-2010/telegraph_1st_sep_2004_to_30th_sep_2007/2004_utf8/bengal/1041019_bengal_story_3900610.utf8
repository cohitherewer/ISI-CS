 Probe into teacher dress bar 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Malda, Oct. 18: As Aparna Sarkar refused to go to a school that clamped a dress code on a teacher, the district administration today ordered an inquiry into how she could be prevented from taking classes in salwar-kameez. 

 Aparna, a 26-year-old zoology teacher at Hiralal Balika Vidyalaya in Bamungola, 60 km from Malda town, lodged a complaint with police yesterday alleging that two of her senior colleagues had beaten her with umbrellas on Saturday because she wore a salwar-kameez to work.

 The managing committee of the state-aided school had taken a decision in June last year that Aparna would not be allowed to sign the attendance register if she did not wear saris. The teacher has also claimed that she was not paid her salary between June 26 and August 31, 2003, as punishment for violating the dress code.

 Malda district magistrate Ashok Bala said he was ?shocked? on reading the report. ?If such a thing has happened, it is regrettable. I have asked the district inspector of schools and the local block development officer to conduct an inquiry.?

 Even more baffling, Bala said, was the teacher?s claim that her salary was held up. ?How can the school take such a drastic step just because the teacher was insisting on wearing salwar-kameez? We have to find out if there is more to that. It could be that her pay was held up because she did not attend school. The inquiry will cover all aspects.?

 Aparna, who remained at her home in Malda town all day, said she would not go to school as ?it was not safe?. ?I was beaten with umbrellas the other day. What if they attack me with knives instead? They can also instigate the students against me.? Today was the last working day before the puja break. But Aparna is not sure if she will return once the school reopens. 

 The school authorities scoffed at the allegations. ?Her claim that she was beaten up is not true. All her charges are unfounded and baseless,? said managing committee member Kasimuddin Sarkar. He added that Aparna was ?welcome? to come back, ?in a sari or a salwar-kameez?.

 Mob battles cops on jail death

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Sept. 25: The Murutia police station near the Bangladesh border turned into a battlefield this morning when villagers attacked it to protest against the death of Dulal Tarafdar at the Krishnagar district jail.

 Police had arrested Tarafdar on Wednesday from his residence in Tarakgunj, 200 km from Calcutta, on charges of smuggling hemp plants to Bangladesh.

 Tarafdar, who was later sent to prison, hanged himself this morning with a towel from the ceiling of his cell, according to jail authorities.

 News of Tarafdar?s death soon reached Tarakgunj village. Nearly 400 villagers armed with rods and bows and arrows gathered at the police station around 12.30 pm and gheraoed it for about two hours. The villagers alleged that Tarafdar was tortured to death by the police.

 The mob ransacked the police station, smashed the window panes and damaged furniture and police vehicles.

 Police personnel at the station tried to disperse the mob but failed. Later, a large contingent of police from adjacent areas arrived at the spot and resorted to a lathicharge.

 The villagers then pelted stones at the policemen. Seven police personnel were injured, including the officer-in-charge of Hogolberia police station who was admitted to Karimpore hospital.

 District superintendent of police Benoy Chakraborty said 23 people were arrested for rioting and attacking the policemen. He said police were conducting raids in the area to arrest those involved in the attack on the police station.

 ?It was just like a battlefield.? he said. ?Tarafdar was arrested on charges of smuggling hemp plants to Bangladesh and remanded in judicial custody on September 23 by the Tehatta court. The allegation of him being tortured is baseless,? Chakraborty said.

 The Nadia district magistrate, Kanwaljeet Sing Cheema, said preliminary investigations revealed that Tarafdar had committed suicide.

 The district secretary of the Association for the Protection of Democratic Rights, Ramen Maitra, said they would move the human rights commission against the police.

 The district magistrate said a report has been sent to the state human rights? commission this morning.

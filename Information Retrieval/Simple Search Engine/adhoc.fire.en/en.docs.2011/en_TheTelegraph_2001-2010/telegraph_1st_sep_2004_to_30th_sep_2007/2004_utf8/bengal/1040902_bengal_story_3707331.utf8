 Citu leader faces probe 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Krishnagar, Sept. 1: An embarrassed CPM leadership in Nadia has begun a probe against an activist of its labour arm, the Citu, for allegedly harassing a woman and helping a person who was trying to grab her house. 

 Mintu Chatterjee was arrested yesterday. He has been sent to police custody for a week. 

 We are collecting all information relating to allegations against Chatterjee and will verify them. If he is found guilty, we shall not hesitate to take stringent action against him, said district CPM secretary Ashu Ghosh. 

 The party finds itself under a glare as recently the high court censured two leaders in Dum Dum for taking the side of a landlord and trying to forcibly settle a dispute with a tenant. 

 Ghosh admitted that the CPM has begun a cleansing process to stem the rot. We have expelled or suspended many partymen in the recent past after they were found to be involved in anti-party and corrupt activities, he said. 

 CPM functionaries said at least 20 members have been expelled and about half-a-dozen suspended over the past one-and-a-half years on charges of criminal activities, corruption and possessing disproportionate assets. 

 Police constable Biswanath Pramanik was arrested on Monday for trying to grab Maya Roys house. Chatterjee allegedly dragged Roy last morning to the Nadia court to force her to withdraw the complaint. Roy gave him the slip and lodged a complaint against Chatterjee, too, with the police. According to the police, Chatterjee and Pramanik were in league.

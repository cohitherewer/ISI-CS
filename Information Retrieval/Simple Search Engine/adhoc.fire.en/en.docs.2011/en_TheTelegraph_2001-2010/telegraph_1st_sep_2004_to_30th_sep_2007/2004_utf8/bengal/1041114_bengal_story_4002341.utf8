 Mamata firm on Disabled Day bandh 

 OUR BUREAU 

 Calcutta, Nov. 13: Mamata 

 Banerjee today refused to call off a 12-hour bandh on December 

 3, turning a deaf ear to pleas of handicapped persons and 

 arguments of party leaders. 

 ?Faced with the government circular, we cannot defer the bandh. Instead, we should launch a statewide campaign in support of the bandh,? a source quoted the Trinamul Congress chief as telling her associates. 

 She was referring to the press note issued by the government asking all district magistrates to ensure normal work on November 17, when the SUCI has called a 24-hour bandh. 

 The step follows a high court order directing the chief secretary to declare bandhs ?illegal and unconstitutional? and deduct the salary of government officials absent on such days. 

 The source said Mamata is facing pressure from within the party against the bandh over the salary issue and the fact that December 3 is World Disabled Day. 

 Trinamul general secretary Mukul Roy said the bandh should be discussed further in a general body meeting in view of the recent developments. ?We may discuss the matter after the festival is over. We have to take a collective decision vis-?-vis the bandh,? he added. 

 Another senior party functionary argued: ?We should not organise any bandh on December 3 as some disabled persons have appealed to Mamata requesting her to call it off.? He demanded a meeting next week on the issue. 

 But the SUCI and the CPI(M-L) are determined to enforce the bandhs on November 17 and 22, respectively, ?to register our protest against hike in fuel prices?. 

 Subrata Mukhopadhyay, the state?s junior standing counsel appearing in the case challenging the bandhs, today said the government will oppose the high court ruling. 

 ?We are ready to fight the case before a regular bench. We will try to convince the court that it is the fundamental right of people to protest any government decision. Bandh is only a form of protest,? said Mukhopadhyay. 

 The All India Minority Forum, a petitioner in the case, threatened to demand compensation if its members are not allowed to report for work on November 17.

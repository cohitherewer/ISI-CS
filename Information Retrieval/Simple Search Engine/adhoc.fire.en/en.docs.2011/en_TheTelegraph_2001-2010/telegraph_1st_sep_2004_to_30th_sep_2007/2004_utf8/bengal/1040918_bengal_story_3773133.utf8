 Antique find in Nobel hunt

 OUR BUREAU 

 Sept. 17: The hunt for 

 Rabindranath Tagore?s Nobel medal has led the CBI to a gang 

 dealing in priceless antiques. 

 Yesterday, a Bhagalpur-based gang was caught selling a Tibetan manuscript, containing the tenets of transcendental wisdom taught by the Buddha, at Gumbahatta in Kalimpong.

 The racketeers had tried to sell the 305-page manuscript to undercover CBI agents for Rs 3 crore. They had claimed the antique was more than 800 years old. 

 Weighing 42 kg, the manuscript had been translated from Sanskrit by Thumi Sambhota. An 8-inch antique metal idol and a 5-inch-long brass knife were also found on the gang of three.

 A CBI spokesman said Chedi Prasad Mondal, Sreekant Prasad Singh and S. Lama would be brought to Delhi for questioning to ascertain whether the gang was involved in the theft of the Nobel medal and other memorabilia from Rabindra Bhavan in Santiniketan. 

 This is the second antique racket busted since the bureau started investigating the Nobel heist.

 In July, the CBI caught two men in Goa trying to sell antique idols. During raids in Bihar, it had stumbled on a cache of arms in Katihar.

 The bureau heard of the gang during its investigation into the Nobel theft. The case had required the CBI to verify activities of antique smugglers across the country, particularly in Bengal, Bihar and Jharkhand.

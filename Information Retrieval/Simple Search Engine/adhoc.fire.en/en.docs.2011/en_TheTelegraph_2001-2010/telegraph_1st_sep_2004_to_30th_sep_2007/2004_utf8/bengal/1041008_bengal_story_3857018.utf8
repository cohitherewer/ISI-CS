 Siliguri weatherman calls it rare

 OUR NORTH BENGAL BUREAU

 Oct. 7: The rain has destroyed houses, snapped power supply, caused rivers to swell and left many homeless in the six north Bengal districts. 

 Siliguri recorded 180 mm of rainfall yesterday and 48 mm today. The minimum temperature, at 23.2 degrees Celsius, was six degrees lower than normal. 

 Subir Sarkar of the weather station said: ?Though post-monsoon showers are a common occurrence in this region, this kind of cyclonic rainfall is rare?. It generally takes place in south Bengal.

 ?It is being caused by a depression over the Bay of Bengal, one of whose axes is hovering over here. This kind of depression was responsible for torrential rainfall in 1968 and on a few rare occasions later.?

 There is unlikely to be any let-up over the next 48 hours. Sarkar warned of flash floods in the region if the rain does not stop by Friday.

 The Indian Airlines flight from Calcutta arrived at Bagdogra airport almost four hours late at 4.30 pm.

 In South Dinajpur, the four major rivers ? Atrayee, Punarbhaba, Tangon and Jamuna ? are flowing around the danger mark. At least 12 relief camps have been set up at the district headquarters, with over 40,000 people affected. 

 The situation is no better in North Dinajpur where over 500 roosting birds died at Kulik Bird Sanctuary. All five blocks in the district have been affected, with 1,500 mud houses destroyed.

 The condition in Malda is said to be ?grim?.

 Eight long-distance trains were cancelled after tracks on the Malda division subsided in six places. Hundreds of villages in the region are without power and facing scarcity of drinking water. 

 The weather proved a big disappointment for tourists and trekkers, too.

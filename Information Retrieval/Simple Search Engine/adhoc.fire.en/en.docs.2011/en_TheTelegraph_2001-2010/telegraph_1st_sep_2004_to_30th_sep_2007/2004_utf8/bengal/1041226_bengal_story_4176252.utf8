 Plea to set up special court

 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE

 Calcutta, Dec. 24: The state human rights commission wants the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government to create a separate bench to deal with rights cases which are piling up every day. 

 Thousands approach the commission after failing to secure justice from all quarters of the administration. 

 The rights panel has also suggested to the state government the necessity of a special court to try such cases. 

 Shyamal Sen, the chairman of the state rights panel, said: ?I felt there was a need to open a special bench. I?m trying to urge the government to take the issue seriously. As the decision to set up such a court must be taken by the state government, it is up to it to decide when that would be done. Just as there is a green bench for protection of environment, a court for settling consumer disputes, human rights, too, must have a separate bench.?

 Fifty-year-old Sunila Majumder approached the rights panel after her son Partha was picked up by police seven years ago. He still remains untraced. The CID finally submitted chargesheets against 11 police officers early this year under the recommendation of the commission. 

 Sabita Biswas, mother of Soumitra, a fourth-year medical student who was found dead inside the hostel of R.G Kar Medical College three years ago is still doing the rounds of the court for a trial date. The CID was instructed by the rights panel to reopen the case as it was not satisfied with the report filed by the Chitpur police station.

 The law for protection of human rights, too, underlines the need for a state to set up a special court headed by someone not less than a sessions judge. A commission official said about 6,000 rights violation cases were registered last year. ?Earlier, we used to get about 2,000 cases a year. But as awareness among people is increasing, the number of cases is rising sharply. Now we have to make about 60 recommendations every year and start criminal cases for several hundred other cases.?

 Another official said about 90 per cent of the complaints are against the police, around 8 per cent against jail authorities and the rest against the health department. 

 ?In cases of complaints against the police, we recommend a departmental inquiry. In several instances, we have to file criminal cases. Since there is no special bench to deal with our cases, we have to lodge a case in a normal court that is already burdened with a few thousand other cases. Even if we complete our inquiry in time, the complainants do not benefit as judgments take abnormally long to come,? said A. Sen, a member of the state rights panel.

 ?We would welcome a special bench,? said Sujato Bhadro, secretary of the Association for the Protection of Democratic Rights.

 Law minister Nisith Adhikary said the government does have a plan, but ?there is no infrastructure? to set up such a bench immediately.

 Plan afoot to breed fish in net 

 SIMI KAMBOJ

 Calcutta, Oct. 17: Fishetarians might as well feel good. Faced with an annual shortfall of 50,000 tonnes, the government is scouting for alternative fish breeding grounds. 

 With most ponds, canals and rivers already saturated, the virgin waters of dam reservoirs are now being targeted. The fisheries department has sent a proposal to the Union agricultural ministry for rearing fish in the reservoirs. 

 The idea was picked up from a recent workshop on cage aquaculture conducted by the Mumbai-based Central Institute of Fisheries Education. ?Our ponds, canals and rivers offer no scope for any further rearing of fish. So we had to decide on new areas,? said fisheries secretary R.P.S. Kahalon, who attended the workshop in Chandigarh. 

 Under the system, fish is reared inside a net. With low investment, easy harvesting, simple sampling and observation and protection from predators, cage aquaculture scores over normal pisciculture. Fisheries officials said the feed for fishes in cages can be utilised properly and diseases detected early. The cages are made of net or webbing supported by bamboo or fibreglass.

 The officer said: ?Rs 6.3 lakh has been sought for a pilot project at Pailan in South 24-Parganas.? The fisheries department is also initiating a project in the Kansabati reservoir at Mukutmonipur in Bankura. Delhi offers a 75 per cent subsidy on the scheme. 

 Last year, Bengal produced 11.5 lakh tonnes of fish but consumed over 12 lakh tonnes. The shortfall was made up with supplies from Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa and Bihar.

 Flood victims mob CM with neglect charge

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bongaon, Oct. 22: About 200 people pierced the chief minister?s security curtain and gheraoed Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee when he came to oversee flood relief here today.

 Around 2 in the afternoon, the chief minister arrived at a makeshift relief camp at Dinabandhu College, where inmates said the relief materials were of poor quality and alleged that the local administration was ?callous? in distributing them.

 After Bhattacharjee had listened to the complaints and as he was going towards his car, an angry mob stood in the way. 

 Tarak Roy, an inmate of the camp who was in this group, told Bhattacharjee that the local CPM leadership had handpicked a few to meet him and was not allowing the majority to speak out. 

 The demonstration took the officers accompanying Bhattacharjee by surprise. As police officers on duty strove to clear the chief minister?s way, the mob insisted that he listen to it.

 On a day?s visit to flood-hit Bongaon and Basirhat sub-divisions, Bhattacharjee did hear the protesters and later said: ?I know that the number of tarpaulins supplied to the relief camp inmates was inadequate.? 

 Hundreds of villagers have been living in relief camps for the past two months. 

 Bhattacharjee visited three camps and met flood victims at Bagda and Swarupnagar for a first-hand feel of their problems. 

 He discussed the progress of relief work with senior irrigation and relief department officials and said it will be reviewed at Writers Buildings on November 7.

 Flood victims now camping at Bongaon High School alleged that the administration had sprayed bleaching powder only to convince the chief minister that ?they are taking good care of us?. 

 One of them said: ?We became aware of an impending VIP visit when we saw some people spraying bleaching powder here. None from the local administration had bothered to visit us earlier.?

 Finance minister Asim Dasgupta, who was with Bhattacharjee, admitted that the foodgrain being distributed was of poor quality and promised to take up the issue with the Food Corporation of India.

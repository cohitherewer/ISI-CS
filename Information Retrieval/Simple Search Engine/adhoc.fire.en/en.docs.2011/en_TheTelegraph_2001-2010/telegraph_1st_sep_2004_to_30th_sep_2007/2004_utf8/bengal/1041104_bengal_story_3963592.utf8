 Player kin in chit row 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Nov. 3: Three persons were detained at Bidhannagar (North) police station this afternoon when they tried to slip in a piece of paper with a suspected message along with food to arrested footballer Dipankar Roy. 

 Notorious criminal Dilip Banerjee alias hatkata Dilip and Dipankar?s East Bengal clubmate Sasthi Duley, from whose residence the gangster was arrested, are also being held in the police station. 

 This afternoon, Dipankar?s relatives arrived at the police station with food in a tiffin carrier and left it with the sentries outside the lock-up. 

 The policemen, while checking the food, noticed something white between two rotis. They pulled out the piece of paper and immediately sent a sentry after the three. The sentry ran out and detained the trio, who had left the police station. 

 In another development late last night, a group of seven officers from the Criminal Investigation Department trooped to the police station and informally interrogated hatkata Dilip and the footballer duo. 

 The questioning continued for well over one-and-a-half hours in the presence of senior police officers from the North 24-Parganas. 

 Around 11 last night, East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick was summoned to the police station. Later, Bhowmick said he had come to pay a visit to the two players ?who were like his son? and also acknowledged that he was asked several questions. 

 Several other persons were interrogated yesterday. Besides Bhowmick, who was named by Sasthi?s uncle, Sanatan Das, a former national footballer was also called in for questioning. Insiders claimed Dipankar?s statement last night prompted sleuths to summon the footballer. 

 Among others, a promoter from Sonarpur was grilled, again reportedly on the basis of Dipankar?s statement. Before that, Sasthi?s brother Uday was questioned.

 Armed robbers lynched

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bongaon, Dec. 25: Residents of Bongaon this morning lynched seven persons who tried to rob passengers of a bus at Kadamtala, about 90 km from Calcutta.

 At 10 am, an armed gang stopped a private bus on the Bongaon-Chakdah road in North 24-Parganas, according to officials. The gang was led by Uttam Adhikary, an associate of Swapan who is wanted in connection with the Dhantala rape and murder case.

 ?The miscreants stopped the bus by posing as passengers. They then boarded it and threatened the conductor and driver,? one passenger told police. Five of the robbers boarded the bus brandishing handguns, while two stood guard outside.

 ?The passengers raised an alarm and residents of the adjoining Kamdebpur, Krishnapur and Bele areas rushed to the spot with bamboo sticks, axes and iron rods. The miscreants started running away and even fired four rounds to scare away their pursuers,? recounted Adhir Ghosh, an eyewitness.

 ?However, the robbers were caught after a chase of about a kilometre. More people then joined the villagers and started beating up the robbers. Five of the miscreants died on the spot, while two succumbed to injuries while being rushed to Bongaon hospital,? said Ghosh.

 The bus has been seized, but the driver is yet to be traced. No one has been arrested as yet.

 North 24-Parganas police superintendent Praveen Kumar said all those killed were from Nadia. ?We are contacting our counterparts in Nadia to establish the identities of the dead,? he said.

 ?We have learnt that the gang raided the bus on the basis of information that a Bangladeshi businessman, Harabilas Roy, was travelling on the bus with Rs 2 lakh in cash,? said an official.

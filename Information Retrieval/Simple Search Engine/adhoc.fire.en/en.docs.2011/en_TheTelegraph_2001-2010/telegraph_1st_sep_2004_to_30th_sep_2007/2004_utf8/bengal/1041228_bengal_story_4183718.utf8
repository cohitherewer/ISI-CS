 Late winter chills north

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Siliguri, Dec. 27: The day south Bengal felt chilly for the first time this season, north shivered as well.

 Siliguri today recorded a minimum temperature of 8.4 degrees Celsius, seven degrees below normal. In Darjeeling, the minimum hovered around one.

 Weathermen here predicted a very cold New Year for the region. The sudden dip in temperature is because of a cold spell that has gripped northwest India and is inching towards north of Bengal, the Met office said.

 ?There is a possibility of an untimely shower, caused by a low-pressure area nearby, which could send the mercury further down in the next few days,? said Subir Sarkar, who is in charge of the North Bengal University?s weather monitoring station.

 ?We started using heavy pullovers and jackets very late this year, but the chill is catching up all right. The drop in temperature is usually felt in Siliguri and the Himalayan foothills by the first week of November or late October, right after Durga Puja,? said Soumen Nag, an environmentalist.

 BRIEFS

 Chinsurah, Oct. 27: Five persons and a child were injured when a hired Tata Sumo used by the Hooghly district superintendent of police ? the red beacon flashing atop it ? rammed into a roadside stall around 10 pm at the Hooglighat station area, about 60 km from Calcutta. The superintendent was not in the car. All five have been hospitalised. 

 Angered, people torched the vehicle. A police force arrived and charged with batons to bring the situation under control. Police said Bimal, the driver, was drunk. Two firetenders were rushed to the spot to douse the fire.

 Krishnagar: The beheaded and decomposed body of 19-year-old Ujjwal Sarkar was recovered on Wednesday from the septic tank of an abandoned house behind the BDO?s office at Nakashipara in Nadia. Ujjwal left his Bikrampur residence on Thursday on his bicycle for pandal-hopping at Bethuadahari and never returned. ?It appears to be an act of more than one person and the assassins are from Ujjwal?s friend circle,? police said.

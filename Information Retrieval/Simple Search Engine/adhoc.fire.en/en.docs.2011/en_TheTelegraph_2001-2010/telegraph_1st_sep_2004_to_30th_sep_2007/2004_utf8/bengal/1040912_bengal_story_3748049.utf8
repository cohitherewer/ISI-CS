 SC drive in Susmita case

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Sept. 11: The criminal investigation department (CID) is going to move Supreme Court against a high court order rejecting its plea for custody of three accused who had been held in connection with the disappearance of Susmita Dhar at Chandipur, a seaside resort, nine years ago. 

 A team of sleuths probing the disappearance met law minister Nisith Adhikary yesterday. After getting the go-ahead, the CID is preparing papers related to the disappearance of the 22-year-old student of Jadavpur University.

 ?This is an important case and we have decided to move the Supreme Court. All papers related to the case are being sent to Delhi,? said Adhikary. 

 Susmita and four university friends ? Rajib Chowdhury, Suparna Banerjee, Anindita Roy and Soma Samanta ? along with private tutor Debanjan Das, had reached Shantinivas Lodge in Chandipur on May 13, 1995. Two days later, she went missing. 

 The case was reopened a few months ago when it came to light that Suparna?s father, Sachin Banerjee, had appointed a private detective agency to probe the disappearance. He, according to CID sources, had asked the agency to stop their investigation after the sleuths found Susmita?s blood-stained nightgown. 

 During the second phase of the investigation, CID sleuths learnt that Debanjan, Rajib, Suparna and her father had suppressed the recovery of the nightgown. ?It has strengthened our suspicion. We arrested them but could not interrogate them as they are in jail custody,? said a CID official. 

 Another CID official working on the case said: ?We have enough evidence in hand to file a petition before the apex court seeking custody of Debanjan, Rajib and Suparna.?

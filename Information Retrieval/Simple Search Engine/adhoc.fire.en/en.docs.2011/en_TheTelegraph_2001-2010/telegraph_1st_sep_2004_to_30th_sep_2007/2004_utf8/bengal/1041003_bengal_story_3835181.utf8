 Raped for son?s affair

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Durgapur, Oct. 2: Shock-waves rippled through Burdwan district late on Thursday night when a 55-year-old widow was raped and her vagina mutilated with an iron hook, allegedly by a villager in retaliation for her son?s affair with his wife.

 The woman, who was alone at home, crawled to a neighbour?s house in Gopalpur, 100 km from Calcutta.

 Doctors at the sub-divisional hospital said the widow had to be operated on and given several stitches. ?She is on oxygen and saline and three pouches of blood had to be given. Her condition is still not stable,? said a doctor.

 Residents of the village in the Kanska area beat up the alleged culprit, Ganesh Haldar, before handing him over to police.

 ?We have arrested Haldar and initiated a case against him. We have also had a medical test done on the victim. We are also investigating into the alleged affair between the victim?s son and Haldar?s wife,? said the Burdwan superintendent of police, .K. Singh.

 Haldar, a daily labourer, came to the widow?s house around midnight ? with an iron hook used to handle sacks and gunny bags ? in search of her son, Sagar Bala, whom he had caught in a compromising position with his wife, Basana.

 Not finding Sagar, Haldar allegedly dragged the widow to a garden and raped her. Then he inserted the hook in her vagina and twisted it, causing severe injuries, said the police.

 The widow crawled to a neighbour?s house. ?Around 2 am, I heard someone crying for help. When we opened the door, we found our neighbour lying in a pool of blood,? said Bimal Haldar, who immediately phoned Ajitesh Ghorami, the local CPM leader and the upapradhan of the Gopalpur gram panchayat.

 ?We admitted her to the sub-divisional hospital around 3 am. She told us the name of the culprit,? said Ghorami.

 Sagar, who learnt of the assault on his return yesterday morning, went on the rampage at the house of Haldar, who was asleep. Villagers dragged Haldar out and beat him up before handing him over to the police.

 Gang held on way to dacoity

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Oct. 2: A gang of robbers was arrested this morning in a Nadia village while on its way to Birbhum in a Maruti van for a raid.

 Led by middle-aged Manij Hazra, 11 unemployed youths between 19 and 24 years confessed they had set out on a dacoity, police said.

 A police team, led by officer-in-charge of Kaligunj station Himadri Chakraborty, raided Hazra?s home ? at Bakulnagar in Kaligunj, 150 km from Calcutta ? just before dawn on a tip-off, additional superintendent Biswarup Ghosh said.

 Hazra and his men were later caught with three revolvers, six rounds of bullets and other weapons, Ghosh said.

 The officer said Hazra had left home at the age of 12 with the ambition of becoming the leader of a dacoit gang.

 Interrogation revealed that Hazra lured unemployed youths from Jagaddal, North 24-Parganas, with the promise of making quick money.

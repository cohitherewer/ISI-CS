 Probe into puja on hospital grounds

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Krishnagar, Oct. 20: The 

 government today ordered a probe into how a state-run hospital 

 in Nadia?s Chakdah allowed a Durga puja on its campus. 

 Patients? and doctors? pleas fell on deaf ears as the organisers played Hindi film songs on loudspeakers since yesterday in the silence zone. 

 ?How did the hospital authorities allow such a puja? This is highly illegal. Moreover, loudspeakers are blaring and just think what the patients are going through. We have ordered an inquiry into the matter. I have also sought a report from the CMOH (chief medical officer of health) of Nadia district,? said Prabhakar Chatterjee, director of health services, when contacted in Burdwan. 

 CMOH Mrinal Kanti Biswas said the authorities of the hospital at Chakdah, 65 km from Calcutta, did not consult him.

 ?I have sought a detailed report from the superintendent. I have also spoken to the police and asked them to seize the loudspeakers,? he said. 

 Hospital superintendent Moloy Banerjee is on leave. The medical officer in charge of hospital administration, Sarbani Goswami, refused comment. ?Only the CMOH can speak in this regard,? she said. 

 Additional superintendent of police Biswarup Ghosh said the police gave the go- ahead as the hospital authorities did not raise any objection. ?If the hospital authorities don?t object, why should we? The puja committee furnished the superintendent?s no-objection certificate,? he said. 

 Organisers said the puja was shifted near the hospital because a ?town hall? is being constructed at their earlier venue. 

 ?We organised the puja at the earlier place for 55 years. But last year, the municipality started constructing the town hall there. We chose the hospital ground as a large portion of it lies unused,? said Shankar Dey, the secretary of the puja committee. 

 At the receiving end of their enthusiasm is 250-odd patients, many suffering from diarrhoea and malaria. ?I am in this hospital for the past three days. I can?t tolerate the noise from the loudspeakers throughout the day,? said 60-year-old Badal Chandra, a diarrhoea patient in the medicine ward. 

 Pandal gutted 

 A puja pandal was gutted this morning at Natun Pukur on the outskirts of Bolpur. Fire brigade officials said the pandal was torched by fire crackers tossed by some youth. The idols remained intact.

 Motorcycle thieves in net

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 4: Residents of Manicktala and Bagmari in north Calcutta caught three youths trying to steal motorcycles. Police claimed that a racket had been busted.

 During interrogation, the trio apparently confessed to their involvement in the racket. Police said they had links with criminals in Bangladesh and used to smuggle motorcycles to the neighbouring country through its border with North 24-Parganas.

 Nazimul Mollah and Abdul Mollah were caught in front of Sitambar temple near Manicktala. Pintu Das, who was caught at Bagmari, was trying to unlock a two-wheeler when the residents chased him. 

 Nazimul and Abdul were spotted by labourers, working in a highrise, when they were about to start the stolen motorcycle. As they raised alarm, the residents rushed and caught them. They were handed over to policemen on patrol. 

 The police said all three were part of the same gang and belonged to North 24-Parganas.

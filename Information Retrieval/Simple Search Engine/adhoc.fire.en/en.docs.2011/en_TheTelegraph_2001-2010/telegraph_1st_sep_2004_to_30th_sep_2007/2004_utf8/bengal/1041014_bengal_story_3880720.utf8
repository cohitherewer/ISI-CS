 Calcutta, Oct. 13: The US again sounded out the Left Front government on support to increased foreign investment in insurance, aviation and telecom and made it clear that a consistent view on the issue by the Left parties would be helpful. 

 A team of the American Chamber of Commerce yesterday sought the help of the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government to expedite FDI changes in the sectors. The US is laying immense importance on the views of the Left, keeping in mind they are a key ally of the government in Delhi. 

 Today, in the presence of Kenneth I. Juster, undersecretary of commerce for industry and security, US consul general George B. Sibley said there are obstacles in economic relations which are acting as a drag on the relationship. Raising FDI cap in sectors like insurance, telecom and civil aviation is an important issue. 

 ?Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has told us yesterday that the Left party has an open door policy on FDI. The Left parties are working through their policies. A consistent message will be helpful,? added Sibley. 

 Information minister Manab Mukherjee, who was present at the annual convention of the Indo-American Chamber of Commerce, reassured the US that the Bengal government is open to the idea of liberalisation. ?The Left Front government has no hidden agenda on FDI. As far as our state economy is concerned, everything is open in West Bengal,? he said. 

 Juster, who will meet Bhattacharjee and members of the Confederation of Indian Industry tomorrow, said the US is keen to develop high technology trade with India. 

 ?I will be visiting the IT companies at Salt Lake. We want to have more cooperation with India,? he said. 

 Asked if the US is not pro-export, Juster said: ?The tariff and non-tariff barriers, the multiple layers of tax, infrastructure, intellectual property rights are some of the stumbling blocks. 

 ?US companies have just begun to wet their toes in India. But they haven?t started scuba diving yet? but the water on some of the streets of Calcutta is sufficiently high to immerse their toes.?

 Will he keep the date? A tiger in the wild 

 Calcutta, Nov. 20: British wildlife filmmaker Richard Brock, the executive producer of Living Planet productions, will be in the Sunderbans for three days from November 26 to shoot and face the fusillade in an interactive session. 

 A team of wildlife filmmakers and conservationists will accompany Brock to the Sunderban Tiger Camp in Dayapur, South 24-Parganas, where seminars and workshops on film-making and environment will be held.

 Armed with his equipment, Brock is likely to spend another week in the mangrove forests, meet the residents and learn about their cohabitation with the Royal Bengal Tiger.

 The visit to the remote haven of the predator is part of a British Council initiative to bring together wildlife filmmakers, environment activists, creative professionals, NGOs, park officials and nature lovers to share their experiences. The theme for the interactions will be Wildlife Films as a Conservation Tool. 

 The director of the privately-run tiger camp, Pravir Garg, said all arrangements are final. 

 Pradeep Vyas, the director of the Sunderbans Tiger Reserve, said Brock had expressed his interest in the Sunderbans during a visit to Calcutta a few months ago. ?He is a world renowned wildlife filmmaker. If he makes a film on the Sunderbans, it will be really helpful,? Vyas said.

 Such a film, he added, will help to know the ecology, flora and fauna of the Sunderbans better. 

 ?The seminars and workshops will obviously highlight different aspects of the Sunderbans which we may not be aware of,? Vyas said. ?People like Brock have immense knowledge about wildlife and if we get a chance to share our experience with him, we will benefit,? he added. 

 A British Council official said: ?The interactions will stir up new ideas, build understanding and appreciation of each other?s contribution to natural history documentation.?

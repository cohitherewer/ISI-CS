 Scanner on school boss

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Oct. 5: The headmaster of a primary school in Nadia is facing probe for allegedly pilfering rice meant for students? mid-day meals. 

 The headmaster, Lutfar Rahaman Mollah, lodged an FIR on August 31 alleging rice theft from the school at Birpur in Nakashipara, 140 km from Calcutta, three days before that. However, after lodging the complaint, he went on leave. Mollah is now facing a magisterial inquiry.

 District officials said the headmaster had misled the administration regarding theft of two quintals of rice allocated to the school by the block development office under the central Sarba Shiksha Abhijan. 

 The officials added that after receiving the complaint, the officer-in-charge of Nakashipara police station, Anupam Chakraborty, went for an inquiry and found the school keys with a Class IV student. The headmaster had gone on leave without informing anybody.

 The school, which has about 300 students, has one teacher apart from Mollah.

 Subdivisional officer Ajay Sannamat said: ?The OC told me that the people he detained for interrogation had revealed the headmaster knew about the crime.? 

 After receiving the OC?s report, Sannamat asked the circle inspector of Nakashipara, A. Rashidujjaman, to investigate the case. 

 The circle inspector?s report apparently indicted Mollah, who claimed to be on leave during the theft. ?If I was involved, I wouldn?t have lodged a complaint,? Mollah said.

 The meal is part of a central scheme to provide food to primary students to ensure regular attendance and prevent droputs. Out of about 51,000 primary schools in Bengal, cooked food is served in 1,100. In the rest, 3 kg of rice is given to every student, every month. Complaints of theft of rice meant for the meal rocked Ausgram in Burdwan last month and angry villagers attacked CPM activists accusing them of having a role in theft. The party expelled two CPM members in this connection.

 Baidyanath Chatterjee, the Nadia inspector of primary schools, said he has ordered an inquiry against Mollah. ?It is the first case in Nadia in which the police are probing an headmaster?s alleged involvement in theft of mid-day meal rice,? Chatterjee said.

 The subdivisional officer said: ?If the allegations are proved correct, we will initiate criminal action against the headmaster.?

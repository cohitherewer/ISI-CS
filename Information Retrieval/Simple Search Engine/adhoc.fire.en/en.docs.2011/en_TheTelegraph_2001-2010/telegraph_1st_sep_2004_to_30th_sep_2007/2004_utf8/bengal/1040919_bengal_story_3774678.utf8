 In-laws burn, neighbours rescue

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar (Nadia), Sept. 18: Nineteen-year-old Kamalika Mandol, a resident of Begopara, about 65 km from Calcutta, escaped unhurt when her in-laws tried to set her ablaze last night.

 Her husband Babu, who works in a hotel in Dubai, was away when the incident took place. 

 Police said the neighbours came to Kamalika?s rescue when her husband?s brother and parents allegedly got into her room around 12 last night and splashed kerosene on her body. They then rushed her to hospital.

 Police later arrested her mother-in-law Tuku and brother-in-law Pranotosh on the basis of a complaint lodged by Kamalika. Her father in-law Rabindranath is absconding.

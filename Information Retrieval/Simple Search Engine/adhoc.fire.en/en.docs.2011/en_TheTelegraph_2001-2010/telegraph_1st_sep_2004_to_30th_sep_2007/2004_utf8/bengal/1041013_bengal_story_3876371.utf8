 Madarsas to chant harmony hymn

 SANJAY MANDAL 

 Calcutta, Oct. 12: Tagore songs and rakhis, which the poet popularised as a means to spread harmony and protest against the partition of undivided Bengal, are set to be celebrated in Muslim educational institutions.

 A city-based madarsa will host a programme later this month to mark the centenary of the Banga Bhanga Andolan and the exchanging of rakhis that became synonymous with the movement. 

 ?We have asked all madarsas to celebrate the historic movement against the division of Bengal. The main programme will be held at Akra High Madarsa on October 14 and 15,? said Abdus Sattar, the president of the West Bengal Board of Madarsa Education. 

 Raising awareness of the drive to eradicate polio and the literacy-for-all campaign will be on the agenda for the programme on the southern fringes of the city. Seven madarsas will come together to debate, participate in seminars, stage short plays and sing Tagore and patriotic songs. 

 The chief minister had over the past year underlined the need to bring madarsas closer to the mainstream with the introduction of modern subjects. The need to dispel the notion of madarsas being breeding ground for discord was also felt.

 The programme would begin with recitations from the Quran and the Upanishad. 

 ?We are excited,? said Sabura Khatun, a Class XII student of the Akra madarsa.

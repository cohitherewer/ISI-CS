 BRIEFS

 Krishnagar, Nov. 29: Four persons were killed last night when their vehicle collided with a lorry on National Highway 34 near Bethuadahari in Nadia district, 130 km from Calcutta. One person was injured. 

 Additional superintendent of police Biswarup Ghosh said the victims, members of the Indian National League, were returning from a party convention at Hariharpara in Murshidabad. 

 Calcutta: The BSF has arrested four Bangladeshi infiltrators along with an Indian citizen, Tapan Debnath, near the Haridaspur border in North 24-Parganas. After investigation, the force learnt Debnath, a resident of Bongaon, and his brother-in-law used to take between Rs 300 and 600 from each Bangladeshi to help them cross over. 

 Calcutta: The traffic wing of the state police has drawn up an Integrated Suburban Traffic Improvement Scheme to make the flow of traffic smooth and reduce accidents. Deputy inspector-general of police (traffic) M. Alam said if the scheme is approved, it will initially be implemented in South and North 24-Parganas, Howrah and Hooghly. The proposals include increasing traffic guards, widening of roads, fencing, markings on roads, and setting up video cameras at vital junctions. 

 Calcutta: The government is planning to recruit 120 policemen in four police stations in Bankura to ensure better patrolling in the Naxalite-affected areas of the district. The proposal will be placed before the cabinet on Thursday.

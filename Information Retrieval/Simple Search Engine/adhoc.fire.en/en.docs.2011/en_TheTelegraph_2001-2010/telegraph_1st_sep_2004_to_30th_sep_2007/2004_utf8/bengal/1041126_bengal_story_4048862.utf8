 Arrest order on fake paper teachers 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Behrampore, Nov. 25: School education minister Kanti Biswas today ordered the arrest of two assistant teachers for submitting fake marksheets after no action was taken despite the school inspector lodging an FIR against them in July. 

 Abdur Rahim Biswas had submitted a fake BSc marksheet to get the job and stopped coming to school after he was caught. But Abdur Razzak Biswas and Mohsin Ali, who had furnished forged MA marksheets to qualify for a higher pay scale, are taking regular classes at Lalnagar High School in Hariharpara, 220 km from Calcutta. 

 Their salaries were stopped after the cheating was brought to the notice of Murshidabad inspector of schools Subhendu Ghosh early this year. 

 ?We will not allow thieves to masquerade as teachers. I have asked the police to immediately arrest the two teachers. If the school managing committee continues to be soft on them, I will cancel the affiliation of the school and de-recognise it,? an angry Biswas told The Telegraph today. 

 Murshidabad superintendent of police Gyanwant Singh said a cheating case had been started after the FIR. ?I have sought an explanation from the officer-in-charge of Hariharpara police station as to why the three teachers have not been arrested. I have asked them to arrest them immediately,? he said after Biswas ordered immediate action. 

 School teacher-in-charge Korban Ali said an order from the Board of Secondary Education arrived two months ago, asking school authorities to take action against the teachers, but it was ignored by the managing committee.

 Ehsan Ali, former secretary of the school managing committee, who blew the whistle on the three, alleged the three are being protected by present secretary Abdul Kader, who is also a CPM local committee member and pradhan of the Humaipur panchayat. 

 When contacted, Kader defended the two teachers attending school. He said Abdur Razzak Biswas and Mohsin Ali had repaid the amount they had drawn thanks to the higher scale granted to them by virtue of the fake marksheets to the DI?s office. 

 ?Why should any action be taken against the teachers? One of them has resigned and the other two have paid back the extra amount that they had taken. That is why the managing committee did not sack the teachers,? said Kader.

 But DI Ghosh said he was not aware of any repayment. ?It is totally illegal to accept any money from teachers charged with furnishing fake marksheets,? he added. 

 The government recently dissolved the managing committee of a Nadia school after it sat on the sack order of a teacher who had altered his marksheet.

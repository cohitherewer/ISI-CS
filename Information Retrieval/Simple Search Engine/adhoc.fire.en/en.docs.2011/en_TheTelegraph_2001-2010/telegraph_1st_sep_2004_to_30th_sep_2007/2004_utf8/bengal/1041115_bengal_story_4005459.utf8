 Hospital molest charge

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Nov. 14: A woman accompanying her sick husband in hospital was allegedly molested by a Group-D employee last night.

 Subhas Mitra of the Karimpur block hospital, about 180 km from Calcutta, was detained after the woman went to police. 

 Additional superintendent Biswarup Ghosh said Mitra would be questioned on the basis of the alleged victim?s complaint. ?He will be arrested once we establish the charges against him.?

 Around Saturday midnight, the woman, a resident of Ramchandrapur in Murutia, was sleeping in the hospital?s male medical ward, a few feet from her husband Zabbarul Sheikh, a farmer. He had been admitted with diarrhoea three days ago. 

 His wife had the hospital?s permission to stay with him at night so that she could take care of him.

 The woman told the police: ?He (Mitra) grabbed me when I was asleep and threatened me with dire consequences if I made the incident public.? 

 She later narrated the incident to a nurse, who suggested she bring it to the notice of the hospital authorities. 

 The woman met the acting superintendent of the hospital, Lipika Sihi, early this morning and lodged a complaint. 

 Sihi said: ?It is unfortunate that such a thing happened in our hospital. I have started a probe and will shortly submit a report to my superiors.

 ?We shall also ask the nurses on duty what they were doing when the incident took place.?

 Last month, a woman was molested in Burdwan Medical College and Hospital when she went there to visit her ailing father. The hospital authorities had ordered an inquiry.

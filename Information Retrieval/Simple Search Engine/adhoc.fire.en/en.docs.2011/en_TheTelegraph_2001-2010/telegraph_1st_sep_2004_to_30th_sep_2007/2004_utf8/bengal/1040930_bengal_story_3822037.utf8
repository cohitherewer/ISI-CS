 Calcutta, Sept. 29: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today conceded that it was a mistake to take over 56 sick companies under pressure from trade unions. 

 ?All these 56 state PSUs are in a very bad state. We were wrong in keeping them in the public sector,? he said at the 117th annual general meeting of the Bengal National Chamber of Commerce and Industry. 

 Some of the companies taken over in the late sixties and early seventies were Lily Biscuit, National Iron and Steel, East India Pharmaceuticals, Sulekha Works and Krishna Glass Factory. 

 Bhattacharjee spoke about restructuring the units and said his government is not averse to putting them on the block. 

 ?People might think we are protesting against divestment and supporting it in the state. We are opposing (sale of) big central public sector enterprises like the ones having Navratna status. These companies are real backbones of our country and if we sell them it will affect our country,? he said. ?But in our case, the situation is different.?

 He said none of the state PSUs formed the backbone of the state economy. Hence, selling them off would not make a severe impact. 

 Bhattacharjee took a dig at his predecessors over Bengal?s failure to make the most of the opportunities in the sunrise sector. ?I agree that we are a late starter in the field of IT. When Hyderabad and Bangalore bagged most of the opportunities in this field, we were sleeping. We did not realise its importance,? he said. 

 But now, he observed, almost all the major IT companies are looking at investment opportunities in this state because of the availability of skilled manpower. 

 ?Currently about 25,000 young people are employed in IT companies here and the number is expected to double in the next one year,? he said. 

 Bhattacharjee added that IT major Infosys is expected to set up office in the state, which already boasts of offices by firms like IBM, Wipro and Cognizant. Reliance Infocomm is also expected to set up an IT training centre in Calcutta. 

 He said the Jindal group wants to start a greenfield steel project in the state.

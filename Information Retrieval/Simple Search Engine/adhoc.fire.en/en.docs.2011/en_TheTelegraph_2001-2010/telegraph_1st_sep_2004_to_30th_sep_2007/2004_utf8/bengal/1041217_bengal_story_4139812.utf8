 Officers plead sick after war zone shift

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Chinsurah, Dec. 16: Three officers-in-charge of police stations in Hooghly have gone on sick leave after being transferred to West Midnapore, a Naxalite hot bed.

 Among Samir Ranjan Lala of Bhadreswar, Sankha Biswas of Chinsurah and Arijit Dasgupta of Dankuni, Lala has already moved the state administrative tribunal opposing the transfer.

 The leave applications are being viewed by a section of officers as the OCs? reluctance to work in a district where policemen have been guerrilla targets. This year alone 14 policemen and Eastern Frontier Rifles jawans have been killed in landmine blasts in Belpahari and Lalgarh in West Midnapore.

 Hooghly superintendent of police Ajoy Kumar said: ?I received the transfer orders on December 9 and sent them to the respective officers the next day.?

 The OCs received the orders and fell sick. 

 ?I have a blood sugar level of 270, which is very high. I have to travel to Calcutta every month to consult doctors. How can I go to West Midnapore?? asked Lala, who moved the tribunal yesterday.

 Lala?s lawyer Swapan Nandi wanted to know why three OCs out of 23 in the district were singled out for an assignment to West Midnapore. 

 ?We want to know the basis on which these three officers were transferred. My client has already put in 17 years of service. Those who are younger should be sent to West Midnapore. Moreover, Lala does not have training in guerrilla combat,? said Nandi.

 Biswas said: ?My doctor has advised bed rest.?

 Dasgupta, who was on leave when the order arrived, has extended it. Repeated attempts to contact him failed.

 Additional director-general of police Ajay Prasad said according to service rules, the OCs have to accept their assignments. He added that they are free to move the tribunal.

 The district Trinamul Congress, however, alleged that the officers were ?victimised? for being close to a particular faction of the CPM.

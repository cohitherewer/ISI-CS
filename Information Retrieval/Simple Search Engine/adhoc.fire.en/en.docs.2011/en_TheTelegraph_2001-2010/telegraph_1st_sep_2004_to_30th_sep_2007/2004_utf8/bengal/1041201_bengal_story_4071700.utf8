 Cheerleaders then, chastened now

 Calcutta, Nov. 30: The high court crackdown on bandhs has evoked responses that reflect a change in the mindset of those who had themselves actively organised such shutdowns.

 Veterans of many bandhs, like transport minister Subhas Chakraborty and the CPM MP from Jadavpur, Sujan Chakraborty, admitted that bandhs have lost their relevance in today?s world. 

 ?I am opposed to all bandhs, including those called by my party (the CPM). There was a time when a lot of bandhs and hartals were called. But now the times have changed. So, the political parties will have to change their concept about bandhs, too. There are several ways of lodging a protest,? said the transport minister.

 Also a Citu leader, Subhas Chakraborty said the people are now annoyed by the mere mention of a bandh and that the ?last weapon in the hands of struggling people? had been reduced to a paid holiday. 

 ?A bandh has now basically boiled down to a holiday for government employees and most others employed elsewhere. Schools and colleges remain closed and classes are not taken. A bandh leads to the collapse of normal activities in the state and severely affects our economy. It is the daily wage-earners who are the worst hit,? the transport minister said.

 He asserted that only a bandh on major issues could be supported and not those called at the drop of a hat. 

 ?We had called a bandh in protest against terrorist activities when Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated. But, now bandhs are being called on flimsy issues like the shalishi bill (the proposed block-level pre-litigation conciliation bill), increase in number of liquor shops, bad roads and enhanced car tax,? he said.

 Echoing the transport minister, Sujan Chakraborty, a former activist of the CPM?s youth wing, the DYFI, said the people will no longer respond to bandhs and will make them failures. 

 ?The people now want progress, more industries and employment opportunities and not bandhs,? he said.

 Industrialists applauded the high court?s ruling and said shutdowns send wrong signals. 

 Welcoming the court order, CESC vice-chairman Sanjiv Goenka said bandhs are not the right means to convey messages. 

 ?Bandhs only disrupt normal lives of the people. The judgment will send a good message to all the stakeholders of the state.?

 The executive vice-chairman of Eveready Industries India, Deepak Khaitan, said bandhs send wrong signals not only to the people of other states in the country but also to the outside world. 

 ?Bengal is witnessing an industrial resurgence after many, many years. Calcutta is also becoming the preferred IT destination. A bandh at this juncture affects the image of the state. Moreover, it hurts the daily wage-earner the most,? said Khaitan.

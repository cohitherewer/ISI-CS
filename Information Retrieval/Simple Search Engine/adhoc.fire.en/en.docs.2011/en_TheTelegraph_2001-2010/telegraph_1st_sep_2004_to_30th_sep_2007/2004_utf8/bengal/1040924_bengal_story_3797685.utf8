 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, Sept. 23: The chief minister today said that the growing influx from Bangladesh was swelling the ranks of prisoners in Bengal.

 ?The jail minister has told me that jails are getting crowded on account of illegal immigrants,? Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said. The problem, he added, had aggravated over the past nine months. ?There are people who cross over illegally. Then, there are those who come and overstay.? Asked if they would be pushed back, he said: ?They are turned over to the BSF, which hands them over to the Bangladesh Rifles.? 

 Calcutta: Civil aviation minister Praful Patel will meet Left leaders on Friday to defuse the threat of an airport mass-leave from Monday against privatisation. Patel will arrive from Mumbai around 9 am and leave by noon.

 Calcutta: The school education department is trying to expedite over 15,000 court cases. Over 10,000, minister Kanti Biswas said, relate to teachers claiming recruitment though there were no sanctioned posts. The rest involve schools that claimed to be government recognised.

 Calcutta: The Supreme Court has admitted the CID?s special leave petition to take the prime accused in the Sushmita Dhar case ? Debanjan Das, Rajiv Chowdhury and Suparna Banerjee ? into custody. Dhar, an MA student at Jadavpur University, went missing while holidaying with friends at Shankarpur a decade ago.

 Calcutta: Destruction of crops by floods has prompted two farmers to commit suicide. Satish Roy, 58,of Gaighata in North 24-Parganas and a marginal farmer at Mangalkot in Burdwan consumed poison.

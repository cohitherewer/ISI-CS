 BRIEFS

 Midnapore, Oct. 26: The East Midnapore administration on Monday arranged the cremation of 26-year-old Purnima Singh, who was HIV positive.

 Residents of Purushottampur in Egra, 125 km from Calcutta, refused to touch the body of the tribal woman since her death three days ago. Purnima lived with her mother. Since testing positive about seven months ago, they were outcasts. Panchayat secretary Bishnupada Mishra said: ?The residents were so scared of contracting AIDS that they did not even allow the body to be consigned to flames in the local burning ghat.? 

 Siliguri (PTI): Nagaland governor Shyamal Datta?s son was injured when a youth attacked him at his tea estate office in Alipurduar. Police said Saibal, the manager of Sankosh Tea Garden, was hit by Anup Indowar, who lived there before leaving for Punjab. He returned on Tuesday and demanded immediate employment.

 Calcutta: Chief secretary Asok Gupta will be in North 24-Parganas on Wednesday to inspect areas waterlogged since the pre-Puja rain. He will go to Bongaon, Bagdah, Gaighata and Swarupnagar where siltation in the Ichhamati and illegal construction on its bed have compounded the problem, said an official. The chief minister had been mobbed by residents when he went to oversee relief work.

 Krishnagar: Relatives and neighbours of Biswanath Maity, a trader in Naihati, ransacked Gandhi Memorial Hospital in Kalyani, 45 km from Calcutta, after he died. Maity, 45, who suffered a stroke, was taken to the hospital around noon. The relatives, who alleged that Maity was unattended for hours, broke windowpanes, ransacked the ward master?s office and the X-ray room and raided the ward where he was.

 Calcutta: Customs officials at Dum Dum airport seized $4,000 from a passenger on Tuesday night. Sources said the money on the Bangkok-bound Indian was undeclared.

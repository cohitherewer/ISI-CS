Calcutta, Oct. 27: The British government?s development aid agency, Department for International Development (DFID), is funding a study for the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government to bring out the problems afflicting the investment climate of the state and help address it. 

 Consultants started work recently after discussions over the last few months between the agency and the state government on the possibility of conducting such a study. 

 ?ICRA Advisory Services have been appointed by DFID as consultants for the study and it will take about two months? time to prepare a draft report on the investment climate of Bengal. The consultants will prepare, among other things, a comparative analysis of the incentives offered (to investors) in Bengal and in the other states,? an official associated with the study said today. 

 The study will identify the main problems hampering the development of industry in Bengal and chalk out policy changes or measures to improve the flow of funds into the state. 

 The government offers several incentives to investors and it is essential to do a scientific comparative analysis of the incentives available in other states ? a step which will help bring out where Bengal stands, another official said. 

 The report will be placed first before the DFID and then shared with the Bhattacharjee government, he added. 

 The government wants special focus on the potential of the handloom and iron and steel sectors and how to develop these two areas. A large number of people is involved in the handloom sector and the state has immense potential here, the official said. 

 ?It is very important for the government to know how to bring about immense change here and how the manpower can be better utilised. 

 ?It (the study) is ultimately expected to throw up some issues that the government and those associated with the industry in this state need to address and, if necessary, go about for some change of government policies,? he added.

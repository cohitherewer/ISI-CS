 Bloc firm on front nominee for bypoll

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 14: The Forward Bloc today refused to oblige the Calcutta district committee of the Left Front by changing its nominee for the Shyampukur Assembly seat where a byelection is due on October 13.

 The Bloc has put up Jiban Saha, chairman of the party?s youth wing, as the front nominee from the seat.

 ?We are not going to change the party nominee, come what may. Saha was unanimously elected a Front nominee for the Shyampukur seat on September 4 following a Left Front meeting. So the question of changing our nominee does not arise,? state Bloc secretary Ashok Ghosh said here today.

 The front had earlier officially announced its candidates for the bypolls to the Jorabagan and Entally Assembly seats.

 At a meeting today, the front?s Calcutta district committee urged the state Bloc leadership to nominate a fresh person for Shyampukur.

 The lone Bloc representative on the committee, Nihar Roychowdhury, also an aspirant for the seat, skipped today?s meeting.

 Bloc sources said Roychowdhury reportedly influenced some local CPM leaders to change his party?s nominee in Shyampukur.

 The three seats fell vacant after Sudhansu Sil, Mohammad Salim and Subrata Bose won the Lok Sabha elections held in May. 

 Sil was the MLA from Jorabagan, Salim from Entally and Bose from Shyampukur.

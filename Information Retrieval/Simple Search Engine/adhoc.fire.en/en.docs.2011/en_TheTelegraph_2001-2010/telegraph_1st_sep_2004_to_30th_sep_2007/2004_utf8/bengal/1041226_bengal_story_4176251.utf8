 Hope for children of single parents

 TAPAS GHOSH 

 Calcutta, Dec. 25: Mrittika Chatterjee could not send her six-year-old daughter to Our Lady Queen of the Mission school on Parents? Day though students were told they must be accompanied by parents. 

 Chatterjee, a divorcee and a senior executive of a private firm, who stays with her daughter in south Calcutta, could not make it to the school as she was unable to leave office.

 Lopamudra Sengupta was advised by a doctor to take her son Debdutta to Shankar Netralaya in Chennai for tests. Sengupta, fighting a legal battle in Alipore Court with her former husband for alimony, had no one to accompany her on the way to Chennai.

 When the problems faced by children of divorced parents is becoming increasingly acute and organisations to help them are few, a city-based social organisation has launched Route Maker. The association, meant to help children ?bogged down by a host of problems?, will start functioning from the first day of 2005. 

 In 2004, the Alipore Civil Court alone heard more than 2,000 divorce cases, in which more than 50 per cent had agreed to separate mutually. The family court, the Alipore District Judges? Court and the Sealdah court have also heard several hundred such cases in the past year. 

 About 10,000 marriages take place in the city every year and over a thousand couples choose to live separately. 

 But the number of children of single parents is actually much more as many couples live separately without divorce, and there are also those who have become single with the death of the spouse. 

 A sister organisation of the city-based wedding planner, Relations, Route Maker will offer ?all sorts of assistance? to solve problems faced by children of single parents.

 ?Most such children feel lonely. They shy from extracurricular activities and often do not get the required medical attention as the parent is busy. In the absence of another parent, concerns like going to parent-teacher meets, school programmes and playing with the child go unattended. These issues are serious and need to be attended to because they can lead to psychological problems,? said K. Anwar, the chief executive of Route Maker.

 He added: ?After conducting an elaborate survey, we decided on setting up the association. We?ve already had an unexpected response from single parents. More than 100 children have enrolled?.

 The new organisation will make it possible for the children to attend social events that they wish to ? film fests, book fairs, circus and picnics.

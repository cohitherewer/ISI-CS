 BRIEFS

 Durgapur, Nov. 27: A part of land owned by Eastern Coalfields Limited adjacent to its headquarters at Sanktoria in Kulti, 240 km from Calcutta, subsided along with about a dozen houses this afternoon. No one was trapped or injured. 

 Four houses in the ECL complex and four houses of a neighbouring village collapsed. Besides the panic, the administration was plunged into confusion as chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee was supposed to return from Purulia via a route that passed barely a half-a-kilometre from the subsidence site. 

 Nabadwip: A police constable was killed and several others were injured when a fire broke out at a temporary police picket here. At least 15 personnel were in the camp when the blaze started around 11.45 pm. Nadia police sources said the camp was set up at the Prabhu Jagatbandhu Vidyamandir in Nabadwip to help maintain law and order during the immersion rallies of Ras Yatra.

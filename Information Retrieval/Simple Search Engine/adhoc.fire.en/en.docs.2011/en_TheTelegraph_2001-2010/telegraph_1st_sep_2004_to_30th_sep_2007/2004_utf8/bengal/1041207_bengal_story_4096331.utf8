 Shame for HS council in HC

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 6: The high 

 court today ordered the higher secondary council to state 

 in an affidavit how it can compensate a student who has 

 lost years because of its mistake.

 Jusitice Jyotirmoy Bhattacharya passed the order following a complaint filed by Tamaghna Chatterjee, who wrote the HS exam this year.

 A student of Kalna Ambika Mahishamardini Higher Secondary School in Burdwan, Tamaghna had received a letter from the council seven days before the HS results were declared. 

 The council charged him with walking out with eight sheets from his chemistry paper-II answerscript and said that he would not be cleared in 2004. Tamaghna was also barred from taking the tests in 2005.

 Clueless about the basis of the charges, the boy approached the court, which heard the case and directed the council to produce his answerscripts. 

 When they were examined in court, it was found that Tamaghna had taken eight loose sheets to write his paper and all of them had gone missing. In place of the sheets on which Tamaghna had written, was another set written by some other examinee for a different subject.

 ?This was enough to prove that Tamaghna was not at fault. Someone else at some stage during the evaluation process had misplaced Tamaghna?s loose sheets and wrongly attached the sheets that were not his,? said his lawyer Pratik Dhar.

 ?The council has done injustice to the examinee in two ways. First, it misplaced his original loose sheets. Second, it sent a wrong information to him because of which he has lost a year,? Justice Bhattacharya said. ?I need to know what should be the council?s stand on such mistakes.? 

 Tamaghna was declared ?failed? this year. Even if cleared now, he stands to lose a year because admissions to first-year college closed in August.

 A council official admitted its mistake. He said: ?We cannot deny that the mistake was ours. We apologise.?

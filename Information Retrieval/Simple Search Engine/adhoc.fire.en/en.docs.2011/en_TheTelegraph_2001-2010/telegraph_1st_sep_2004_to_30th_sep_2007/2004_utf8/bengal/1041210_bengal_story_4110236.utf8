 Father killed in children?s fight

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

Krishnagar, Dec. 9: A squabble between children 

snowballed as their fathers waded into the brawl and one killed the other. The 

surviving parent is absconding. 

 Ten children, five each of neighbours Hasan Sheikh and Hepajuddin, used to play together at Badlangi village in Nadia?s Chapra, 130 km from Calcutta. 

 This morning, the children ? all between five and 10 years ? picked up a fight and Hepajuddin?s kids returned home with bloody noses. Their father, who was home, flew into a rage, said additional superintendent of police Biswarup Ghosh. 

 He stormed into Hasan?s house and thrashed his children. Sahiruddin Sheikh, a panchyat member, said Hepajuddin also rained blows on Hasan?s wife Minu when she tried to stop him. 

 Desperate, Minu rushed to Hasan, who was working in a paddy field. He ran home and saw his children bawling in the courtyard. Boiling with rage, he picked up a crude bomb and headed for Hepajuddin?s house. 

 A police official said as Hasan entered, Hepajuddin punched him. ?Hasan hurled the bomb at Hepajuddin. The bomb exploded on him and Hepajuddin slumped to the ground in a pool of blood. One of his arms was severed from his body,? said Ghosh. 

 He was rushed to Shaktinagar hospital here, where he was declared dead. 

 Hasan is absconding. 

 Two of Hepajuddin?s children, eight-year-old Rafiq and five-year-old Salma, received splinter injuries. They are out of danger.

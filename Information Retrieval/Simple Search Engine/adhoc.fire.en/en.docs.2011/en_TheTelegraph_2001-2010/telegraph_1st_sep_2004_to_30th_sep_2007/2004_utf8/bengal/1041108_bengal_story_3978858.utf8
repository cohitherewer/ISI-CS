 New people in new town

 SANJAY MANDAL

 Calcutta, Nov. 7: New Town on the outskirts of the city received some of its first residents today as about 70 families celebrated their occupation of the apartments with a cultural programme inside Animikha, the first joint-sector housing project there.

 Housing minister Goutam Deb, who attended the function, said: ?Animikha is our first joint-venture housing project in New Town where handing over of possession and occupation has begun. Several others are in the pipeline.? 

 The Bengal Shrachi and Bengal Ambuja projects are nearing completion. ?We are expecting the allottees to get possession in a few months,? Deb said. 

 Work on the Bengal DCL project has started as on Greenfield, the only joint-venture highrise in New Town. 

 All the projects have been allotted 5 acres in the first phase of the township. Once completed, they will accommodate 16,000 people. 

 The minister said work on similar projects for the next two phases of the township will begin after that. 

 Animikha, the Rs 47-crore residential complex, a joint venture with Bengal Peerless, is located at the entry point of Rajarhat from Salt Lake. Kumar Shankar Bagchi, the Peerless managing director, said: ?A third of the allottees have been handed over possession of flats. We have also handed over the common area.? 

 The first ?multi-complex? in New Town, housing a shopping mall, sporting complex, service apartments, entertainment arena and a food court over 500,000 sq ft, is also scheduled to start this year.

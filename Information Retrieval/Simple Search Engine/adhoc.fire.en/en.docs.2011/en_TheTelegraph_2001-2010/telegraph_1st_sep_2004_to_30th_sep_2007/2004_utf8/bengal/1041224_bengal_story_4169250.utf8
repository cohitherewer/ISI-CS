 Cong offer to Mamata

 Siliguri, Dec. 23 (PTI): Former state Congress chief Somen Mitra said here today the party will accept Mamata Banerjee as its leader.

 ?If Mamata joins us, we will have no problem accepting her as the PCC (state unit) chief,? Mitra told a news conference. Over the past few months, senior Congress leaders, including state chief Pranab Mukherjee, had been pleading with her from public fora to return to her parent party. The Trinamul Congress chief, too, has been under pressure from a section of her own party to snap ties with the BJP-led NDA.

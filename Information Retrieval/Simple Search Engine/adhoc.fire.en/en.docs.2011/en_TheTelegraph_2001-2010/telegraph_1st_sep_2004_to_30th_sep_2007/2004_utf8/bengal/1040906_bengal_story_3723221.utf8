 8,000 vehicles face pushout

 A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta, Sept. 5: About 8,000 vehicles plying in the Calcutta Metropolitan Area (CMA) will have to be phased out by the end of December. 

 A survey by the transport department shows contrary to claims by transport unions, only that many vehicles fall in the pre-1975 category. Bus owners associations have gone to court against the governments policy of phasing out old vehicles, claiming it would affect 35,000 vehicles and the livelihood of the people associated with them. 

 The 8,000 vehicles in the over-30-year category comprise only 4.25 per cent of the 1.91 lakh vehicles in the metropolitan area. 

 Since we have laid down December 31 as the deadline, vehicles whose permits expire before that will be allotted temporary permits till the end of the year. From next January, permits will be issued only if the old vehicle is replaced with a Bharat Stage II complaint vehicle, a transport department official said. 

 The vehicle owners argue there is no need for a phase-out. Of all the metros, Calcutta has the lowest pollution level. So where is the need to remove older vehicles? The high court has asked the government to ensure tail-end emission norms are met. It made no mention about phasing out old vehicles, Sadhan Das, secretary of the Joint Council of Bus Owners Syndicate, said.

 Gang and gold in police haul 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Nov. 27: The two remaining members of a gang terrorising morning-walkers in south Calcutta were arrested from Thakurpukur this afternoon. Two persons were also held for buying the gang?s stolen jewellery. 

 ?We have recovered gold ornaments worth Rs 85,000 which were robbed from the walkers. Besides, three motorcycles which the miscreants used in their operations were also seized,? said Anuj Sharma, deputy commissioner of police, south division. 

 The police said the arrests were made on the basis of statements made by 23-year-old Vijay Shahranier, the gang mastermind arrested on Friday from Taratala crossing. 

 ?Vijay, during interrogation, confessed to carrying out a string of snatchings with his two accomplices ? Nepal and Chhotu. Accordingly, we carried out an extensive raid in Thakurpukur and picked up the other two members of the gang,? said Sharma.

 Nepal and Chhotu later told the police the names of the two persons to whom they had sold the ornaments. 

 ?A police team went to Amtala and netted the two. A major part of the jewellery was recovered from the possession of the duo,? said another official investigating the case.

 Sharma said he would call the complainants to identify their ornaments. ?It seems most of the jewellery was snatched from the morning-walkers in the past few weeks,? he added.

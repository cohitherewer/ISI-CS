 Quota plot judge moves SC 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Dec. 18: Former judge Bhagabati Prosad Banerjee moved a revision petition in the Supreme Court yesterday, urging the court to reconsider its order asking him to vacate his Salt Lake house for receiving the plot from the chief minister?s quota under ?inappropriate circumstances?. 

 Last month, the apex court asked the state government to auction the building Banerjee built on the plot, pay him the amount and take over the land. 

 Central Legal Aids Forum, an association of former high court and Supreme Court judges and lawyers, also filed a public interest litigation, stating that Banerjee had been made a ?scapegoat?. They sought that each and every plot allotted from the chief minister?s quota in Salt Lake be put under the scanner.

 ?The main issue has not been addressed,? said forum spokesman Jaydeep Mukherjee. ?Several judges of the high court and the Supreme Court, IAS and IPS officers and many dignitaries have obtained land in the township under the CM?s quota. So why will Banerjee be victimised? We want the apex court review the entire matter afresh and order a judicial probe.?

 Banerjee said he filed the revision petition because he had done no wrong by obtaining land under the chief minister?s quota. ?I have got a plot of land in the same way that the others have got it. I believe that the apex court will review the case and the truth will come out,? he said.

 While delivering its order, the Supreme Court had said: ?The matter could have been different if the learned judge got allotment from the chief minister?s quota simply like any other citizen.?? 

 Trinamul Congress MLA Dipak Ghosh, the main petitioner in the case, will also move court. He will file an application seeking a clarification of the judgment. Earlier, he had said he would file a revision petition seeking similar directions against several other persons who had got allotments under the quota, but decided against it. 

 ?There is no use in filing a review petition,? said Trinamul MLA and advocate Arunava Ghosh. ?There are no new submissions to make and no further arguments to offer either. This process has already been completed. On the basis of our earlier submissions, we would like the court to consider our plea of similar directions in other cases.? 

 The state government, which had expressed dismay over the order, too, decided against filing for a revision, saying it was bound to carry out the court?s order. Banerjee has been given a year by the court to vacate his house and move elsewhere.

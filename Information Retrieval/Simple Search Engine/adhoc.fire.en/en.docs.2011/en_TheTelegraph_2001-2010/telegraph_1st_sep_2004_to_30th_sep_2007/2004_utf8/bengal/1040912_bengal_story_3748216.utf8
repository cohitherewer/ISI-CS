 CM warns Naxalites on violence

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Jhalda (Purulia), Sept. 11: ?Let those who believe in bandooks and bombs be warned. We will not tolerate such activity. The perpetrators of violence will have to face dire consequences,? chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee cautioned Naxalites.

 ?Drop your weapons. We want peace, we want to work,? the chief minister said at a rally today in a region that has become known over the last two years for the presence of rebels.

 Jharkhand had become a separate state now, he pointed out. ?But armed Naxalites are roaming the province and killing policemen. Now they have entered Purulia, Bankura and West Midnapore and have resorted to violence. But they will achieve nothing by disturbing peace in Bengal.?

 The chief minister?s statement came three days after four landmines were detected at Raniband in Bankura, about 50 km from the route he took from Durgapur to the rally organised by the Federation of West Bengal Bidi and Tobacco Workers? Union.

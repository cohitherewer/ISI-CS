 Trinamul push for plot price revision

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Nov. 22: The Trinamul Congress will ask the Supreme Court to direct the state government to charge current prices for all the 294 plots distributed from the chief minister?s quota.

 In a revision petition to be filed in the court, the party is expected to suggest that the money thus collected be used for building a housing complex for people in the lower income group, who it feels should have originally got land in Salt Lake but were denied.

 This view emerged at the first meeting of petitioners Dipak Ghosh and Tarak Singh with their lawyer today to draft the revision petition.

 Singh was the original petitioner, but it was Ghosh?s petition under Article 32 of the Constitution that prompted the Supreme Court to pass judgment on the distribution of plots at Salt Lake.

 The petitioners would seek a clarification from the court on why others named in the petition as having bagged plots because of the chief minister?s ?special powers? should not also face the flak along with Justice Bhagabati Prosad Banerjee.

 If the court decides that these beneficiaries had not influenced the allotment of plots as much as Justice Banerjee, the revision petition would question why they should not be handed ?lesser punishment?.

 It was decided to draft the review petition on the clause of an error in the face of law ? asking the court for its observation on the 29 plot holders who were named along with Justice Banerjee. 

 Besides, with the apex court expressing reservation on the government policy ?with regard to the allotment of land by the chief minister from his discretionary quota?, Ghosh would question why allotment of plots distributed before 1987 by the then minister-in-charge, Prasanta Sur, should not be cancelled. 

 ?The state could go by the land rate existing in Rajarhat for fixing the value of the plots distributed under the special provisions scheme. And, in case someone failed to cough up the amount, the property could be put on auction. Chandan Basu?s plot, for instance, is the best in the entire township and the price should be accordingly judged,? said Ghosh.

 Singh, on his part, claimed that he would also go for a fresh case in the high court. ?Now that both the high court and the Supreme Court have expressed their reservations on the distribution process of the plots in Salt Lake, why shouldn?t the man behind the entire show ? Jyoti Basu ? be penalised?? asked Singh.

 Mamata Banerjee is still to make a public statement, but party insiders claimed today?s meeting with the lawyer came on the heels of a closed-door gathering at the Trinamul chief?s home yesterday.

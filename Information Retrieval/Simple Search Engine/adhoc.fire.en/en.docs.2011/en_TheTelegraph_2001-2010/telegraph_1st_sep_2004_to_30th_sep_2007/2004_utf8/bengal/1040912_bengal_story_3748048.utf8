 Bypass vrooms to Baruipur 

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE 

 Calcutta, Sept. 11: The 

 EM Bypass is going to be extended by another 11 km from 

 Kamalgazi near Sonarpur to Baruipur to take the pressure 

 off the busy Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Road which runs 

 through Garia. It will be built by CMDA at an estimated 

 cost of Rs 30 crore. 

 The CMDA will also widen the existing bypass from Ultadanga to Chingrighata to eight lanes and from Ruby hospital to Kamalgazi to six. 

 According to CMDA officials, the proposed extension from Kamalgazi will be a two-lane road to begin with. Later, it will be widened depending on vehicular movement.

 ?Thousands of commuters residing in the southern suburbs would benefit from the road as they can easily reach the central business districts or any place in the north bypassing the congested roads,? CMDA director-general Tushar Mitra said. 

 As the road will be built on land owned by the irrigation department, Mitra did not expect any legal tussle. 

 CMDA officials said the extension scheme would be the part of the Megacity project for which the Centre would provide a part of the funds. A team from the Union urban development ministry is expected in the city on Tuesday to hold discussions with CMDA officials on the project.

 ?A memorandum of understanding on the road is expected to be signed between the state and Centre after this meeting as it will be a part of the Megacity project,? Mitra said. ?We plan to start work soon after the monsoons.? 

 He said it would be a major arterial road for the proposed Baruipur township. 

 Urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya said subways or overbridges are being planned at four congested points on the bypass ? Parama Island, Kasba Gol Park, VIP market and Kamalgazi.

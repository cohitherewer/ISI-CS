 Class VII student arrested for raping 8-year-old

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Nov. 2: Prosenjit Roy, a 13-year-old student of Class VII, was arrested today for raping a girl of eight. 

 Police said a medical test on the girl from Hemaniapota village in Dhantola, about 70 km from Calcutta, has confirmed the rape.

 Around 6 pm on Saturday, he called the girl, a next-door neighbour, home on the pretext of playing. With his parents out shopping, Prosenjit allegedly raped the girl, a student of Class III.

 When she returned home around 8.30 pm, the parents saw traces of blood and injury marks on her. That night, when crying in pain, the parents pressed her and she blurted out what had happened.

 Father Tapan Das went to the local Majhergram panchayat chief, Rabindranath Pal, with the allegation against Prosenjit. Still trying to cope with the shock of the revelation, the local grocer was wary of going to the police. 

 The police said Pal had refused to ?arrange a settlement? in a rape case involving children. Das was forced to go to the police station, his daughter with him.

 Additional superintendent of police Biswarup Ghosh said a diary was registered the same night and the girl was sent to Ranaghat Subdivisional Hospital. 

 ?We received the medical report yesterday. A rape case has begun and Prosenjit has been picked up from his house,? said Ghosh.

 Prosenjit was produced in a juvenile court at Salt Lake during the day and was remanded in judicial custody. 

 Preliminary investigations have revealed that the Dases were friendly with Prosenjit, a student of Ganglapur High School. Ghosh said: ?He told us that he raped the girl because he liked her.?

 Prosenjit?s father Santosh sounded distraught. ?I don?t believe he has committed the crime. It must be his friends. My son was lately keeping company with youths who were older to him,? he said.

 Not far from where Prosenjit was held, Shibu Sarkar, 28, was arrested for allegedly raping a 16-year-old girl. 

 At Natungram, the already-married youth promised marriage to the orphan girl and became intimate. She is six months pregnant now.

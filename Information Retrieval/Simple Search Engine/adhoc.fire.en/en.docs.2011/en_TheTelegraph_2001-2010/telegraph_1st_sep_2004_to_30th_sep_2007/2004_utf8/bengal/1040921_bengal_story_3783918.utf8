 Siliguri, Sept. 20: A guest 

 appearance in Main Hoon Na, a meaty role in Parineeta. 

 The toy train is staging a sizzling comeback on the silver 

 screen after a 20-year hiatus.

 The heritage on wheels, a favourite with filmmakers in the seventies, will star in the Vidhu Vinod Chopra opus featuring Saif Ali Khan.

 In the early seventies, Rajesh Khanna and Saif?s mother Sharmila Tagore had made the hill train pan Indian with the chartbuster Mere sapnon ki rani kab ayegi tu from the smash hit Aradhana. Now, Chopra is all set for an encore.

 Saif will share screen space with the toy train in a romantic song sequence set to a tune composed by Shantanu Moitra.

 The trend towards filming in Darjeeling was set anew by the recent Shah Rukh Khan-starrer Main Hoon Na, which included a glimpse of the actor emerging from the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway station. 

 The toy train, however, will enjoy a much more prominent screen presence in Chopra?s film Parineeta, based on Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay?s novel of the same name.

 ?We have booked three rides for the steam locomotive, the dining car, one second-class coach and the brake van. We have asked the railway to spare us the Himalayan Princess, the saloon car with incomparably regal looks. We want to shoot the beauty in motion from inside the saloon car, which no other movie has done before,? said Panchali Sarkar, the film?s executive producer.

 The film, shooting for which is likely to take place between October 31 and November 4, will once again bring Darjeeling and its famed toy train back into the mind space of cinema buffs. 

 ?The film will help popularise the queen of the hills and her much-loved toy train once again,? said Sarkar.

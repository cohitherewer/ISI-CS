 Crash kills 5 near Udaipur 

 OUR BUREAU 

 Calcutta, Nov. 3: Five 

 tourists from South 24-Parganas were killed when the bus 

 they were travelling in in Rajasthan crashed into boulders 

 on a rocky terrain around 9 last night. 

 Over 55 persons were injured in the accident at Deshuri ki ghati under Charbhuja police station in Rajsamand district, about 100 km from Udaipur. Four travellers died on the spot and another succumbed to his injuries in hospital. 

 On Sunday morning, eight tourists from Uttarpara in Hooghly were killed when their bus rolled into a gorge near Lambagarh in Uttaranchal. 

 Chayan Mukherjee, inspector-general (law and order), said so far four victims of the Rajasthan mishap have been identified. They are Bholanath Mondal, 65, Badrinath Haldar, 52, Subal Haldar, 60, and Gopal Haldar, 81, all residents of Dakshin Barasat under Joynagar police station. 

 The bus, of Munai Travels, a Sonarpur-based firm, left for Rajasthan from Dakshin Barasat with 68 people ? 56 tourists and other tour staff ? on October 24, Mukherjee said. 

 The officer-in-charge of Rajsamand police station, Himanshu Singh, said on phone: ?The bus dashed against the rocks, probably because of gear failure. It appears the driver was not accustomed to driving on a rocky terrain.? 

 ?Five of the critically injured passengers have been taken to a modern hospital in Jodhpur,? Singh added.

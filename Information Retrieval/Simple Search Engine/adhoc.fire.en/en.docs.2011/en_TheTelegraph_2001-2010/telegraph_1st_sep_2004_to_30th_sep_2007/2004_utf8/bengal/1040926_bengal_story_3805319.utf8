 Rajarhat on growth route

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Sept. 25: Rajarhat New Town, the state government?s showpiece project, seems set for an expansion. Around 4,000 acres will be acquired for the Housing and Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (Hidco) in South and North 24-Parganas. 

 ?The final decision to add these lands to the Rajarhat New Town project will be taken in the next cabinet meeting,? land and land revenue minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah announced today during the formal handing over of allotted plots in New Town. 

 ?Hidco approached my department for additional land,? he added. 

 According to Mollah, of the additional land, more than 3,000 acres will be acquired from Bhangar block II in South 24-Parganas. Another 1,000 acres will be acquired from Rajarhat block in North 24-Parganas. ?In order to stop black marketeers, we have decided to stop buying and selling of land in these areas,? he added. 

 Apart from expansion, New Town is also set for major infrastructure development. Three more 10-lane major arterial roads of an average 10-km length will be constructed, connecting the township to various parts of Calcutta. These roads will be in addition to the existing 10.75 km road. 

 ?The estimated cost of construction of these roads would be Rs 300 crore,? said housing minister Goutam Deb, also the chairman of Hidco. He said work on these roads would start after the Pujas. They will connect New Town to EM Bypass (near the Science City island) and places like the Kulpi port and Baruipur. 

 Deb also announced that the Centre has approved a Rs 350-crore project to fill up parts of the township by pumping silt from the Hooghly. ?Talks are on with a Dutch company,? a Hidco official said. 

 He added that a meeting was held with power department officials earlier this week. ?We have asked them to set up an underground power supply network. This will require an additional Rs 50 crore.? 

 The minister said the online submission of building plans will begin shortly.

 Cell puzzle after dentist disappears 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Nov. 6: A dentist in his early 40s went missing early this morning under mysterious circumstances when he went for a morning walk at Santoshpur, off Jadavpur. 

 After daylong investigation, police has not been able to ascertain whether he has been abducted. ?No one has so far contacted the doctor?s family for ransom,? said an official of East Jadavpur police station, where a missing complaint was lodged.

 The police said Sukumar Purokayet left his Santoshpur residence around 5.30 am for his morning walk. ?His family members said this was unusual because he was not a morning walker. He started walking in the morning only three days ago,? said an official. ?Interestingly, Purokayet took his two cellphones.?

 The doctor?s relatives tried calling him around 8 am when he didn?t return home. But the cellphones were switched off. 

 Later in the day, they managed to contact the dentist once. ?He told us not to worry. He said he had to go to a place because of some urgent work. He said he would be back within three or four days,? a relative told the police. 

 The police followed the call routes of the two cellphones. ?The results were surprising. We found one cellphone was somewhere in Lindsay Street and another was at Champdani in Hooghly. We are trying to trace the doctor as soon as possible,? said the official.

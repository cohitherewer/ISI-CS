 BRIEFS

 Chinsurah, Dec. 16: Nine-year-old Payel, adopted from the home for destitutes in Liluah, was thrown out by her foster parents last night after a year of torture.

 Nipul Haldar and his wife Sanjukta were arrested tonight from their house in Bandel, about 50 km from Calcutta. Deputy superintendent of police Mansoor Ali Meer said Payel was born and brought up in the home till she was adopted by the childless Haldars three years ago. She was being tortured over the past year. ?Little Payel was made to work like a maid. If she broke a glass, she was beaten up.? Jayanta Majumdar, a neighbour of the Haldars, rescued her. 

 Calcutta: A fast-track court at Baruipur has sentenced Maya Karmakar and her son Raju to life terms. Raju?s wife Aparna, a girl from New Alipore, was burnt to death on June 28, 1997.

 Calcutta: Firemen rescued a kitten from a fourth-floor sunshade of a building at Chandni Chowk on Thursday. The kitten, which reached the ledge last evening, kept the neighbourhood awake with its cries all of Wednesday night.

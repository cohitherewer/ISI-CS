 Rice for schools sold in shops 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Dinhata (Cooch Behar), Sept. 14: Tonnes of foodgrain picked up from FCI godowns for the school midday-meal scheme have allegedly made their way to the market.

 The secretary of the Dinhata High School managing committee, Hiten Nag, alleged that the school had not received any rice meant for the meals in the past three years though dealers lifted its quota of foodgrain from FCI godowns. 

 Nag claimed that several schools in the district were faced with the same problem. He said about 700,000 quintals of rice were withdrawn for the meal scheme but not sent to the schools. 

 ?According to government rules, students up to Class V have to be given midday meals but our school has not received a grain of rice in three years,? Nag said. 

 ?Rice meant to feed 436 students of Dinhata Aided Primary School, an institution that no longer exists, was also picked up by the dealers. According to our estimates, rice worth Rs 54 crore has made it to the markets,? he added.

 The school committee, Nag said, notified the subdivisional officer about the non-availability of rice this August. ?We also wrote to the district inspector of primary schools on September 7,? he said.

 The district administration, which began damage control today, asked all subdivisional officers to probe whether the scheme was running properly. The Dinhata subdivisional officer, Kajal Bandyopadhyay, later confirmed that an investigation has begun.

 Burdwan: The district administration today showcaused two food inspectors. 

 They were accused of conniving with dealers in pilfering rice meant for school midday meals at Ausgram, 150 km from Calcutta.

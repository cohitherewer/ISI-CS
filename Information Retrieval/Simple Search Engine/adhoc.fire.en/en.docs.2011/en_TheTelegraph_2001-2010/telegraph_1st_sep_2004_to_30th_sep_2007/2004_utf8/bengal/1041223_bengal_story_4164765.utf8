 Wheel heist rolls with hired crane 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Dec. 22: It was a spectacle. Dacoits arrived at a godown on Hyde Road near the port with a towering crane and a truck to rob railway wagon wheels before dawn. 

 But the grand plan of Nageshwar Rajbhat, a notorious criminal, and his six accomplices went bust as the crane was hauling the fourth wheel on the truck. A police team from the West Port police station arrived on a tip-off. 

 They were overawed by the scene and took a few minutes to chase the gang. After a 10-minute race, five of the gang, including the truck driver, were intercepted and arrested. 

 Police seized the hired crane and the lorry and recovered the wheels, each of which costs between Rs 80,000 to 1 lakh. 

 ?Among the five criminals arrested, Rajbhat and Bhola Prasad have a reputation for robbery and snatching,? said Ajay Ranade, DC (Port). 

 Police said the gang turned up at the Bengal Bond Godown around 3 am and forced the guards to unlock the gates at gunpoint. Inside, the crane operator swung into action, lifting the heavy wheels and placing them on the truck. A guard managed to call the police. 

 As soon as the police arrived, the miscreants boarded the truck and drove away leaving the crane operator behind. 

 Police are grilling the crane operator and the truck driver. ?We are cross-checking their statements. Though the operator told us the robbers hired the crane pretending to be legitimate clients, we have to verify to whether they were involved in the crime,? he added. 

 Name trouble

 A passenger was detained at the airport before boarding a flight to Bhubaneswar after it was found that the name in his gun licence differed from that in the ticket. The discrepency spilled out when four cartridges were found on him and he produced the licence.

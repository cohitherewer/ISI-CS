 Flood of fake-mark teachers

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Midnapore, Sept. 12: More than a hundred schoolteachers in West Midnapore are believed to have secured jobs by submitting fake papers. 

 Officials said 150 teachers are under scanner and 125 are suspected to have submitted fake post-graduation marksheets to claim an enhanced pay-scale. The rest either submitted false graduation marks or age proofs. 

 Most of these teachers are from schools in Ghatal subdivision, 120 km from Calcutta. But sources said such teachers are spread across the district.

 District inspector of schools Nurus Salam said about 150 teachers, who had claimed higher pay by furnishing forged post-graduation marks, were denied the scale when caught last year. ?We sacked a headmaster and suspended another for producing fake marksheets,? he added.

 The government decided in the mid-1980s that teachers could apply for an enhanced scale by furnishing proof of qualification in addition to that shown while joining . 

 A district official said: ?We received applications from several thousand schoolteachers then.?

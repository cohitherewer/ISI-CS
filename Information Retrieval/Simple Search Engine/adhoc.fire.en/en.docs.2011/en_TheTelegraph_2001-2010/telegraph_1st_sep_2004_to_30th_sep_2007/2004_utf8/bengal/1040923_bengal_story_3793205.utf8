 A crore for reformed KLO

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Sept. 22: In a move to woo extremists into the mainstream, the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government today unveiled a rehabilitation package amounting to Rs 1 crore for the Kamtapur Liberation Organisation (KLO) militants who lay down arms. 

 ?The amount has been set aside from the Uttar Banga Unnayan Parishad (North Bengal Development Council) budget and will be handled by the chief minister as per his discretion,? tourism minister Dinesh Dakua said today. Dakua, CPM MLA from Mathabhanga in north Bengal, is a member of the council. 

 The minister was speaking after the council meeting, chaired by the chief minister this morning at Writers? Buildings. 

 The package will include self-employment schemes for surrendered KLO militants. The former militants are being trained in vocations like driving, motor repairing and animal husbandry. The government has roped in the North Bengal University, local colleges and NGOs for the purpose. 

 The council has a budget of Rs 10.88 crore this year, 30 per cent of which has been allocated to different schemes like construction and maintenance of roads, school buildings, drainage system, health centres, small dams and other irrigation schemes. 

 Another Rs 32.29 lakh ? 3 per cent of the amount ?will be stored in the discretionary fund of the chairman and the vice-chairman. 

 A major portion of the council?s budget ? Rs 7.18 crore ? will be set aside to bridge the gap which might arise in a project. 

 ?This money will be used to pay off the amount if a specific project overshoots its allocated budget,? said social welfare minister Biswanath Chowdhury.

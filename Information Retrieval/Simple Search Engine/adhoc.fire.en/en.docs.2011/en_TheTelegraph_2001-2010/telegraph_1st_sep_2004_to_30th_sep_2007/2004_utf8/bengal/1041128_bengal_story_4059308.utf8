 Gun-plant confession

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Ranaghat, Nov. 27: Four persons arrested yesterday for allegedly harassing athlete Pinki Pramanik near Habibpur station have confessed to planting a one-shot pistol in her bag, leading to her arrest. The sprinter has been granted bail. 

 After Rabin Chakraborty, Uttam Ghosh, Chitta Biswas and Ashu Biswas were produced before Ranaghat SDJM D.P. Biswas, assistant public prosecutor Prahlad Paul told the court that one of the accused had confessed to placing the gun in Pinki?s kit. 

 ?Chitto Biswas told police that he was part of a six-member gang that attacked Pinki with arms,? Paul said. He added that the youth said they were teasing her when she slapped one of them. At this, they turned violent and in the melee, the sprinter slumped to the ground. Biswas snatched her bag and placed his gun in it. 

 Three witnesses from Habibpur had said in a confessional statement that they had seen one of the youths put the gun in her bag. 

 Additional police superintendent Biswarup Ghosh said the police are trying to trace the other two members of the gang. The arrested youths have been booked for illegal arms possession ? police recovered a gun from one of them yesterday ? and eve-teasing. 

 Suicide on road

 A middle-aged man came out of his single- room house on Rajabagan Lane in Sinthi around 4 am, as his wife and daughter slept inside, doused his clothes in kerosene and set himself ablaze. Fifty-year-old Sailen Manna was rushed to hospital, where he succumbed to his burn injuries. 

 Police said Manna had been depressed for several years. ?He had lost his job and could not arrange for money for his daughter?s marriage. It seems financial problems forced him to commit suicide,? said an official.

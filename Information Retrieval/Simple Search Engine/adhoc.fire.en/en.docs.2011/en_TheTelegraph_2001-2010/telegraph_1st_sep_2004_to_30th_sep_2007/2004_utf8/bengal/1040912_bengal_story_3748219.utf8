 Rebel onus on Dhaka

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 11: Defence minister Pranab Mukherjee said the Bangladesh government is being ?repeatedly requested? to close down terrorist training camps in the country, but has ruled out a ?Bhutan-type operation? to flush out the militants.

 ?The Bangladesh government must show interest to flush out the militants. We cannot just go inside and bust the training camps,? explained the defence minister.

 ?We can only request the government (Bangladesh) to close them down. We have done that several times and we will continue our efforts to persuade them to close them down,? said Mukherjee.

 The defence minister?s assertion comes at a time when Delhi has been very vocal about the existence of rebel training camps across the border, despite denials by the Bangladesh government on several occasions.

 On the Indo-Pak peace talks, Mukherjee said today ? a day after a secret visit to Delhi by a Pakistan emissary to step up the peace process ? there has been little progress on the ?main issues? of the Indo-Pak peace talks.

 ?We want peace in the region and welcome all peace initiatives, although there has not been improvement in the main issues of concern in Indo-Pak relations,? said the minister after inaugurating a workshop in the city for defence correspondents.

 Mukherjee, however, promised all support to the Nepalese government in its bid to contain Maoist rebels inside Himalayan kingdom.

 Mukherjee also said that Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had spoken to him regarding deployment of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police in place of the Border Security Force on the Indo-Nepal border. ?We are discussing the issue,? he said.

 Loots ?targeting? women 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Jafala, Nov. 21: Over the past fortnight, 15 houses have been looted in 12 West Midnapore villages, which form part of health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra?s constituency.

 District police chief Vineet Kumar Goyel confirmed a rape and at least two cases of molestation during the raids.

 A massive hunt has been launched for the culprits, who have terrorised the villages in Narayangarh, about 180 km from Calcutta.

 Three people have already been arrested. A search is on for at least 12 others.

 Senior police officers who are part of the operation said the dacoits have been targeting women apart from money.

 Residents of Kautia, Rela, Nahalia, Kifaetpur, Krishnapur and Jafala claimed that at least eight women were molested and one woman was raped by the marauders.

 Police said the dacoits, who are usually masked and drunk, choose houses that are not very rich. ?They could not loot more that Rs 1,000 from a house. In a way, we are baffled why they are not targeting the more affluent,? an officer said.

 Officials at Belda police station said villagers in the area are scared for their women.

 ?We are very worried? And afraid to even allow our women to step out of house after dark,? said Ghanashyam Bhakta of Jafala, whose house was looted and wife harassed.

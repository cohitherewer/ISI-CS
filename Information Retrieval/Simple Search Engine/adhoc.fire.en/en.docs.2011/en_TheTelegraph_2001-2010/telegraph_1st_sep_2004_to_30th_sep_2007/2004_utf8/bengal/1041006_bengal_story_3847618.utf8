 Secondary permit

 Durgapur, Oct. 5: A girl here will have to repeat Class X because of the apparent negligence of her school. 

 When Payel Bhattacharjee, filled in her registration form last year for Madhyamik 2005, she was not told that she was underage. 

 A student of Nodiha High School in the Coke Oven area, about 200 km from Calcutta, Payel is three months under-age according to the board?s cut-off. ?A candidate for next year?s Madhyamik should be born before July 31, 1990. But Payel mentioned her date of birth as November 18, 1990, which the school authorities overlooked,? said a board official in Burdwan. 

 The school admitted negligence. ?It is definitely an act of negligence. How can we deny it? But the parents have to share responsibility,? said the teacher-in-charge.

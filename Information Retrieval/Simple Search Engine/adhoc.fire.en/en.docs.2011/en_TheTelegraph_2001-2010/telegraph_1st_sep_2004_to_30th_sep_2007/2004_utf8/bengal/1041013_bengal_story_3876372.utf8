 Snakebite serum under scanner

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 12: Worried 

 over increasing reports of ineffectiveness of the anti-venom 

 serum available at hospitals in South 24-Parganas, the health 

 department today ordered an inquiry.

 Director of health services Prabhakar Chatterjee said: ?I have asked the chief medical officer of health of South 24-Parganas to conduct an inquiry.? 

 A Delhi-based company supplies the serum to hospitals in the state.

 Chatterjee said: ?We have heard that the anti-venom serum is not working like it used to in Canning and Basanti. That is also possible if the snakebite victims are brought to hospital long after being bitten. If required, we will test the injections in our laboratory to find out whether they are spurious.?

 Entomologist Amiya Hati said a laboratory examination of the serum sample can determine whether a particular set of vials is spurious.

 A health official said most snakebite victims are first taken to witch doctors. ?Villagers waste valuable time and often rush to a hospital only when the victim is in the last stage. Multiple shots of the serum do not work then.?

 In South 24-Parganas, about 1,500 snakebite cases are reported every year.

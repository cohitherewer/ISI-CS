 Acre for health but still no care 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Arjundihi (Burdwan), Sept. 26: Over three decades ago, Mollah Abul Ansar was an affluent man with a vast stretch of land here in Katwa. He donated an acre for a block primary health centre, 180 km from Calcutta.

 On September 18, the 79-year-old resident of Arjundihi died of cancer at SSKM Hospital, virtually penniless. 

 His sons alleged that nurses at the hospital mistreated the man who tried his best for the failing healthcare infrastructure in the state. The brothers now want the government to be ?more sympathetic? if their mother is taken ill in future.

 ?We made the appeal because we saw how our father was neglected in a government hospital despite donating land for a health centre. We don?t want our mother to meet the same fate,? said Golam Kibria, Ansar?s eldest son.

 SSKM superintendent Santanu Tripathi said the authorities tried their best to help the patient after receiving complaints of neglect and misbehaviour from a section of hospital employees. ?The relatives did face some problem regarding availability of bed. We could not arrange free treatment because he was admitted to a paying bed. However, we tried to give the best treatment,? Tripathi said.

 Director of medical education C.R. Maity said the government was not bound to provide special facilities to Ansar because he had donated land for a clinic. ?However, the man should have been treated with care and sympathy,? he said.

 In 1970, Ansar donated the land for the Naopara block primary health centre. Later, a portion of it was encroached upon and some of it came under the land ceiling law and was distributed to marginal farmers. Ansar was taken to the subdivisional hospital on August 20 with obstructive jaundice. He was then referred to Calcutta, where the cancer was detected.

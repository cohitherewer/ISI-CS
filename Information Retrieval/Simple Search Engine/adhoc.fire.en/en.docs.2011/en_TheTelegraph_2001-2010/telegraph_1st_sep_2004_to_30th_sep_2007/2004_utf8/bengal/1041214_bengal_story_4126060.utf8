 Track crack close shave 

 Behrampore, Dec. 13: The Howrah-bound Janshatabdi Express from Malda had a close shave this morning as gangmen spotted a crack and raised an alarm.

 Near Nialishpara Halt in Murshidabad, 210 km from Calcutta, a railway team noticed the fault around 9. The train was stopped at Lalbag station, 10 km away. ?The crack could have led to a disaster,? said Haridas Sarkar, a station manager. The express left after about an hour. A local was also held up at Karna-Subarna station, 15 km from Nialishpara. Passengers stormed the station-manager?s office in protest.

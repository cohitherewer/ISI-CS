 Reward plan for school teachers

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, Dec. 25: The West Bengal Board of Secondary Education has decided to follow a carrot-and-stick policy towards teachers, embarrassed by complaints of school employees giving private tuition and the strictures from Calcutta High Court over mistakes in evaluation of Madhyamik answer papers.

 Teachers engaging in private tuition and committing mistakes in evaluation will be denied promotion and increment and may be transferred or even suspended, while those performing excellently will be rewarded and felicitated at public functions.

 ?We will take measures to punish errant teachers. But, what about the huge numbers of teachers who are dedicated to their profession and work overtime for the benefit of their students? We will soon announce our new decision to reward our teachers who perform brilliantly,? said the president of the board, Dibyendu Hota.

 The contribution of the teachers in respect of teaching, their performance in examination-related duties and their contribution towards the improvement of the students? community will be taken into account.

 ?After discussing the problems with various people, we have come to the conclusion that if we are to improve the overall education system we have to do something to encourage our teachers. I think the new move will help teachers be more devoted to their profession,? Hota said.

 The board will soon organise meetings to finalise the procedure for selecting the teachers for the rewards, he said.

 The board has also decided to publish Madhyamik results within 45 days of the examination, against the two months it takes at present. The 2005 Madhyamik examinations will begin on February 25.

 Officials said the move to punish teachers comes in the wake of a number of high court orders pulling up the board for wrong evaluation of answer scripts. The examiners? faults were detected after the students concerned moved court, which came to their rescue by making the board rectify the mistakes.

 As per the proposed rules, the examiners, who will be found guilty of major mistakes like loss of answer scripts, non-marking of any paper, under-valuation and wilful delay in depositing the evaluated answer scripts, are to be subjected to the above-mentioned modes of punishment. Stern action will be taken against the teachers who will refuse to examine answer scripts.

 IIT, Kharagpur: History calling

 Midnapore, Dec. 4: The Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, has taken up a project to map all historical structures in West Midnapore, create a data bank and make it available on the Internet.

 The project, which is aimed at providing a guide for those involved in conservation, tourism and research, has been conceived by the architecture and regional planning department. Work on the project ? cleared recently by the Union human resource development ministry ? started last month and will take three months to complete.

 ?We are particularly trying to create a data bank of places of historical and architectural value in West Midnapore. In this district, there are many places about which many of us do not know. We don?t know the condition they are in and how to reach the places,? said Sanghamitra Basu, the principal investigator of the project.

 Basu, an associate professor at the IIT?s architecture department, said the district has produced many freedom fighters who laid down their lives for the country. Pradyut Bhattacharya, Nirmaljiban Ghosh, Brajakishore Chakraborty were students of Midnapore Town School and were hanged between 1931 and 1933 for killing three British magistrates.

 Project officer Sutapa Das pointed out that this school, thus, becomes a place of historical importance.

 ?The graveyard of the St John?s Church, constructed in 1851, is the place where the three magistrates were buried. This should also attract interest,? said Das.

 ?The house in Mohaboni where Khudiram Bose was born and Vidyasagar?s birthplace in Birsingha village in Ghatal are other places of interest,? said the project officer.

 There are also several ancient shrines, including a mosque constructed by Aurangzeb and a temple with terracotta work at Chanipath in Daspur.

 ?There are about 800 such places of interest according to our estimate and we will list the details of 300 in the first phase,? said Das.

 Project officials said 35 residents of West Midnapore had been recruited and trained to help complete the project.

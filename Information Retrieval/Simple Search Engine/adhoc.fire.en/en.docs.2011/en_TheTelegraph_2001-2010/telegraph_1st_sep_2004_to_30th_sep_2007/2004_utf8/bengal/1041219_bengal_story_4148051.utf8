 Isro funds for rein on coastal erosion

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Midnapore, Dec. 18: Jadavpur University?s department of oceanography has taken up a scheme to prevent coastal erosion, measure tidal waves and identify seasonal changes in ocean-wave dynamics with financial assistance from the Indian Space Research Organisation.

 The plan involves studies along the 250-km coast from Digha in East Midnapore to the Sunderbans in South 24-Parganas.

 The varsity?s project intends to measure the waves in the backdrop of increasing silt deposits along the entire coast and help make recommendations to prevent coastal erosion.

 The studies are also expected to help the implementing agency to make forecasts on the possible damage the tidal waves may cause during a storm or cyclone.

 ?For instance, tourists could not see very high tidal waves at Digha during Sarasarir Ban in September,? observed Anandadev Mukhopadhyay, the chairman of the Digha-Shankarpur Development Authority.

 ?This was due to heavy deposit of silt in coastal Digha. The on-going studies will help us conduct risk-zone assessments and enable us to alert the nearby villages before a disaster strikes them,? he said.

 Mukhopadhyay informed that Isro has sanctioned Rs 1 crore to install the Auto Tide Gauge Current Meters at three places on the coast to measure high and low tides, detect changes in the ocean-wave dynamics and ascertain the extent of coastal erosion and silt deposit.

 He deplored the manner in which different government departments like public works, public health engineering and fisheries have so long undertaken unplanned steps to protect the sea coast, saying this did not benefit anyone.

 Gautam Sen, a professor of oceanography at Jadavpur University who is involved in the project, said a mobile computer system would be installed to alert fishermen in the deep seas about any impending disaster. ?For this purpose, we are setting up a weather-monitoring machine at Digha,? he said. 

 Mukhopadhyay said the development authority had submitted a Rs 33-crore project to the state government for setting up an infrastructure for constant monitoring of the 72-km stretch of coast from Digha to Haldia.

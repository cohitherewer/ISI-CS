 French tang to food pact 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 18: The state is all set to establish the French connection in the food-processing industry with agreements being signed for two units in the city.

 City-based Exodus Aquatics has entered into a buyback arrangement with French consultancy and marketing company, PB Conseil. The company will source the processed food and supply it to retail chains in France.

 Exodus Aquatics director T.K. Hore said: ?We will invest Rs 40 crore in the unit in the Falta SEZ. Of this, Rs 33 crore will be taken as loan from French bank Natex Banque and the remaining Rs 7 crore will come from WBIDC.? 

 Hore is awaiting approval of the loan by the French bank, which had earlier demanded a guarantee. Senator Phillipe Nogrix, who is part of a delegation visiting the city, will speak to the bank officials to sort out the matter.

 ?The unit will be a single bone fish processing unit with a 40 metric tonne capacity. All machinery is being imported from Iceland and Denmark and will meet French quality standards,? said Hore.

 Industry sources said another joint venture between a French company and the city-based Pailan Group is expected to be announced on Monday. The memorandum of understanding to set up an agro-based food-processing unit has already been signed. The French company will buy back part of the processed product and the remainder will be sold in India.

 Software parks

 The government will inaugurate two additional software technology parks in Durgapur and Kharagpur.

 ?The efforts made in the last three years have paid off and we are finally reaching the critical mass to become a major player in the IT and information technology enabled services segments. 

 ?This has prompted us to start satellite units at Kharagpur and Durgapur, which will be inaugurated on October 7 and 8 respectively,? state information technology minister Manabendra Mukherjee said.

 The IT department was evaluating prospects of two more software technology parks at Haldia and Siliguri, he added.

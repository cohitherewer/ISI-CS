 Weight monitors weigh in 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Oct. 2: Cheats beware! The consumer affairs department has decided to intensify vigil on major city markets and malls till Kali Puja in November to prevent consumers from being short-changed. 

 ?October is the time when most people in the city purchase all kinds of stuff ? garments, jewellery, sweets and even stationery. A section of traders has the habit of cheating consumers, especially during the rush hours. So, we have decided to depute our officials in major markets across the city,? said Ashok Bhattacharya, controller of the legal metrology section under the consumer affairs department. 

 His inspectors will conduct surprise raids to ensure that traders adhere to the rules related to weights and measures under the packaged commodities act. 

 Bhattacharya said the department will also hold awareness meetings with traders beginning next week about the rules and regulations and the penalty for violating them. 

 But shoppers, too, need to be alert, said officials of the consumers affairs department. Bhattacharya said they would distribute ?how not to be cheated? leaflets to consumers, telling them how to identify fake goods, what to check before buying a packaged commodity and even tips to detect a faulty weighing machine. 

 The decision to keep a vigil on markets comes after the seizure of several faulty commodities in raids over the past month in 23 city markets, like Kidderpore, New Alipore, Park Circus, Gariahat, Entally, Baghajatin, Hatibagan, Shyambazar, Posta, Beliaghata, Chitpore, Ahiritola and Baithakkhana. 

 The seized goods range from vegetable to fish, garments to jewellery, biscuit packets to imported fruit juice, grocery to toiletries, sweets to kerosene oil. They were found either deficient in weight than what was claimed or were packed in faulty packets or were ?doubtful? goods. 

 ?Though violation of rules by a section of traders has come down after taking stern action against some errant traders, a section of sellers is still reluctant to abide by the rules and have a tendency to cheat consumers in different ways. We are taking action against the traders who take up unfair practices and, at the same time, we are trying to educate the consumers. We are also involving NGOs in this exercise,?? Bhattacharya said.

 Any consumer cheated by any trader in any market can directly lodge a complaint with the legal metrology section for redress, he added.

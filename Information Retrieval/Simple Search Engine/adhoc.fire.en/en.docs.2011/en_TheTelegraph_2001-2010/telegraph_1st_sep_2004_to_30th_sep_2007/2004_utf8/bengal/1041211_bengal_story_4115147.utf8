 Basu ready to go to jail for bandh

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, Dec. 10: Jyoti Basu today vowed a battle against the high court order banning bandhs and strikes.

 ?I am willing to go to jail on this issue,? said the CPM politburo member. 

 The CPM and its allies would pressure the Congress-led Centre to introduce a bill in the current session of Parliament to protect the right of parties to call bandhs on political and popular issues, said Basu. ?We will raise the bandh ban at the meeting of the United Progressive Alliance coordination committee.? 

 At Alimuddin Street, he also said that the court ruling represented ?blatant? interference of the judiciary in the affairs of political parties. 

 The Constitution, he added, guarantees the parties? right to organise bandhs. 

 ?We still believe that it is the ultimate weapon to put pressure on the government for realising popular demands. We are determined to convince the Congress of the need for a bill to protect the right of parties to call bandhs. Our politburo will also discuss the issue at its meeting this month,? Basu said. 

 Inaugurating a hotel in Salt Lake?s KB block later, he said: ?We will move court on bandhs. If necessary, I will go to jail.? No one, Basu added, can ?snatch? the workers? right to strike.

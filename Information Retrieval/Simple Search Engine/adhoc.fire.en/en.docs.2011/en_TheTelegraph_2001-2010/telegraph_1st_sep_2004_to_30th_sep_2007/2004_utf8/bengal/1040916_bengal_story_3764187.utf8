 Hope lingers till scrutiny

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Sept. 15: The 

 higher secondary education council today requested the West 

 Bengal University of Technology to ask the private engineering 

 colleges under it not to cancel the applications of candidates 

 who were successful in the joint entrance tests but failed 

 in the council examination till their answer-scripts are 

 scrutinised. 

 The board said this in a circular submitted to Calcutta High Court after almost a hundred HS examinees moved the court this year, complaining of irregularities in their results. 

 At least 20 students said they were being denied admission to colleges despite figuring on the joint entrance examination merit list because they failed in the HS examinations. 

 It is mandatory to pass the HS examination to take up an engineering degree course. 

 The court asked the students to deposit Rs 10,000 each with the registrar and directed the council to produce their answer-scripts. Those of 12 candidates have been produced.

 The court has approved the council?s decision that students can avail of a single facility for re-examination ? either through the court or the normal post-publication scrutiny. 

 An official of the technology university said: ?We have advised the authorities of various private engineering colleges to consider the cases and keep the seats reserved for the failed candidates till the results of the PPS are announced.? 

 He said the council?s circular has been sent to all 42-odd private engineering institutions across Bengal.

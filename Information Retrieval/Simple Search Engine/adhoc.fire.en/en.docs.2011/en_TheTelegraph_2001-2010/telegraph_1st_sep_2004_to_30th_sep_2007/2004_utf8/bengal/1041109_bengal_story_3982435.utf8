 Boy beheaded by cuckold

 Krishnagar, Nov. 8: About a fortnight ago, 17-year-old Ujjal Sarkar was found beheaded in the septic tank of Uttam Haldar?s house at Nakashipara, about 130 km from Calcutta.

 Police today claimed to have cracked the mystery saying Sarkar was killed by Haldar because his wife Sufola had an affair with him. 

 A mason, Haldar saw the two together at home upon returning from work on the night of Ashtami. He apparently chopped Sarkar with his equipment in front of his wife. 

 The police had detained Sufola, 23, who narrated the events in the face of intense questioning. Haldar, who was absconding, has been picked up from Bethuadahari. 

 Additional superintendent of police Biswarup Ghosh said Sufola was not arrested because she ?agreed to become an approver?.

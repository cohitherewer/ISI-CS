 Panel positive about private university

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Nov. 24: Private universities will spring up in the state if the government heeds recommendations of a panel it had set up. 

 The committee constituted by the West Bengal Council of Higher Education to explore the prospects of private universities is in the last stages of preparing its final report and is apparently in favour of the proposal. Education department officials said the panel would soon hold its last round of meetings.

 Dilip Deb, the member secretary of the council, would not divulge the exact contents of the report, but said: ?As of now, our recommendation favours the formation of private universities.? 

 He added: ?The concept is new. We have to examine all aspects thoroughly before sending our final report to the government.? 

 The government felt the necessity to consider allowing setting up of private universities after noticing that many such institutions based in other states had opened centres in the city. Many of these centres are drawing hoards of students willing to pay for their education. 

 Deb said the government would have to bring about a legislation to allow setting up of private universities. 

 The proposed universities, which will not receive assistance from the government in any form ? like teachers? salaries or their dearness allowances ? will enjoy independent academic and administrative powers like framing syllabi, conducting examinations, recruiting teachers and employees and following their own admission procedures.

 Council sources said though the new universities would be largely independent, there will be suitable provisions in the proposed legislation, which will restrict them from charging exorbitant fees. ?We will not allow commercialisation of higher education,? a council official said. 

 At present, there is no provision in government rules to allow private agencies to run universities. There are at least a dozen universities in Bengal and they are all state-aided. Each of them is governed by a separate act. 

 An official said once the panel?s report gets the government?s nod, a draft of the rules and regulations will be prepared on the basis of the recommendations. Finally, it will be tabled in the Assembly as a bill. Once the bill is enacted, private agencies will be allowed to set up universities and offer undergraduate and post-graduate courses. 

 A higher education department official said: ?We are yet to decide whether all private universities will be governed by a single act or separate acts are going to be formulated for each one as they come up.? 

 The council has already received a proposal from the Ramakrishna Vivekananda Mission to set up a private varsity at Baranagar.

 SC action threat in judge land case 

 R. VENKATARAMAN

 New Delhi, Sept. 17: The case on the alleged out-of-turn allotment of plots in Salt Lake might lead to contempt proceedings against a former judge as the Supreme Court made it clear today it would ?take action against any judge? found to have misused his position. 

 Bhagabati Prasad Banerjee, formerly a Calcutta High Court judge, is said to be a beneficiary of former chief minister Jyoti Basu?s ?out-of-turn allotment? of residential plots in the upscale neighbourhood.

 An apex court division bench of Justice S.. Variava and Justice H.K. Sema, which heard arguments for initiating contempt proceedings against Banerjee, observed that ?it is time we put the judiciary?s house in order?. 

 As a high court judge, Banerjee had on June 20, 1986, issued notices to the state government on a public interest litigation regarding the allotments and on the same day allegedly requested Basu to allot him a plot from his discretionary quota. He made a formal application for the allotment on July 16 the same year. On June 8, 1987, he stayed the allotments in Salt Lake and three days later lifted it allegedly to secure an allotment for himself. 

 Kamini Jaiswal, the counsel for petitioner Dipak Kumar Ghosh, a former principal secretary in the state government, contended that Banerjee ?misled? the Supreme Court by filing a ?false affidavit? stating that he had not heard the allotment case. Jaiswal pointed out that Banerjee kept the matter pending ?part heard? for at least two years. 

 When senior counsel A.K. Ganguly defended Banerjee, Justice Variava told him ?not to sweep under the carpet deeds of judicial impropriety?. 

 ?A judge at least removes himself from hearing the case....Your client did not do so.... He issues notices on June 20 and on the same day writes to the chief minister requesting for an allotment of plot to himself.... Thereafter, at least, he could have recused himself.... but he continued to keep the matter pending.... We are bothered about the judiciary.... As long as a judge enjoys protection (immunity), action is difficult to initiate.... Now, it is time we clean up the judicial house?,? Justice Variava said.

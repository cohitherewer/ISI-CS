 BRIEFS

 Santiniketan, Dec. 6: Swedish foreign secretary Hans Dahlgren, who will bring the duplicate of Rabindranath Tagore?s Nobel medal and its bronze replica to India, wants to display them in Parliament on Wednesday. 

 The Swedish embassy sent a missive to Visva-Bharati this evening, informing it about the plan. Varsity officials said Dahlgren has asked the Swedish ambassador to personally deliver the medals at Santiniketan in January. But Visva-Bharati is keen to have them before the Pous Mela kicks off on December 23. 

 Calcutta: Dipak Dutta, the officer-in-charge of Karaya police station, was served a transfer order on Monday night. The shift ? to the traffic department ? comes in the wake of Saturday?s shooting on Palm Avenue, a few hundred feet from the chief minister?s house. A man shot another in the abdomen and fled from under the nose of policemen. Three people were arrested later.

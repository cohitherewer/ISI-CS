 Green zone in smoke belt

 ABHIJEET CHATTERJEE 

 Durgapur, Dec. 1: A green belt comprising 16,000 trees will be created around the sponge iron factories clustered in a 30-km stretch between Durgapur and Mangalpur. 

 The first phase of the Rs 10-lakh project ? being shared by the Asansol-Durgapur Development Authority, the pollution control board and the factory owners ? has started at the Mangalpur industrial estate, 210 km from Calcutta. 

 ?The authority has allotted land surrounding the sponge iron units in the estate and the Ranigunj municipality has been asked to prepare the land for planting trees. In the first phase, about 8,000 different types of fast-growing trees will be planted in a 5-km stretch,? said N.S. Nigam, the additional district magistrate (Asansol) and the CEO of the development authority. 

 In its second phase, another 8,000 trees would be planted in February.

 Pollution board officials said the sponge iron units release huge quantities of carbon monoxide, iron particles and coal dust into the air, causing bronchial diseases. They also contaminate water bodies, leading to skin ailments. 

 The board and the Burdwan administration have ensured enforcement of pollution control rules since an electronic pollution-level measurement system was installed a couple of years ago at the Sidhu Kanhu Indoor Stadium. Recently, the board fined four units Rs 10 lakh for not using pollution-control devices and violating norms. A major portion of the penalty would be spent on the green belt. 

 The project was taken up after industry minister Nirupam Sen expressed dissatisfaction over growing pollution in the region. 

 Officials admitted that it was not right to allow sponge iron factories in areas of human habitation. But there are at least 20 units in the area and many more are in the pipeline. 

 ?We did not realise the threat before allowing them to set up factories in residential areas,? said Bangshagopal Chowdhury, the chairman of the development authority and small-scale industries minister.

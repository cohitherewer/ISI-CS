 CPM leaders face cleansing challenge

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 9: For the CPM brass, the 21st state conference slated for February will be a tough call, party officials said today. 

 On the one hand, state CPM secretary Anil Biswas and company will have to remove hurdles in the way of the chief minister?s industrialisation bid. On the other, they will have to fashion a response to the menace of corruption.

 Veteran leader Jyoti Basu provided a clue to the task before the leadership. 

 ?Corrupt elements have entered the party taking advantage of its growth in the past few decades,? Basu told a public meeting at South 24-Parganas? Mahestala yesterday. ?The situation calls for measures against such elements.? 

 Biswas today said the ?rectification programme, which began 10 years ago?, will be taken to its logical conclusion. ?We have to keep the organisation free from corruption.? 

 The leaders? concern found an echo in a party document that admitted it was becoming increasingly difficult to keep vigil on about 2.66 lakh members in the state. It says: ?In 27 years, the CPM membership has increased fast. Naturally, corruption has set in in a section of party functionaries like ministers, MPs, MLAs and municipal councillors.? 

 Party officials said the leadership might have to bring down the axe by way of expulsion or other disciplinary measures against ?tainted? functionaries during the conference in Kamarhati, North 24-Parganas. Though Basu talked tough, it remains to be seen how the leadership handles the ?corrupt elements?. 

 A three-member party panel has already heard 115 cases relating to allegations of extortion or intimidation against party functionaries. It will submit its report during the conference. At the meet, the party will also have to endorse steps taken by the subsidiary units against the corrupt elements.

 The CPM?s zeal to drive them out will also be put to test when the organisational polls commence on September 15.

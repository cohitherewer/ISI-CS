 ?Hunger death? alarm

 ALAMGIR HOSSAIN

 Hariharpara, Nov. 5: About 225 km from Calcutta, here in Murshidabad, five deaths in two months have rekindled the memories of Amlashol, West Midnapore.

 Four of the dead in Hariharpara are tribals. The curse of hunger is so far said to have claimed victims from three villages, but its shadow hangs over several. 

 Local MLA Niamot Sheikh, an Independent, has written to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and district magistrate N. Manjunatha Prasad, drawing their attention to the deaths at Hariharpara, Choa and Gaznipur.

 ?These people are very poor and backward and work as labourers in seasonal brick kilns. But, the kilns are closed now and they are out of job. Five people in the three villages have died of starvation and about 10 others are fighting for life. Healthcare is non-existent in these areas. The villagers are now living on wild roots and tubers and other things unfit for human consumption,? Sheikh wrote. He also requested the chief minister to make immediate arrangement for food, funds and health check-up.

 Sheikh visited the villages on receiving complaints of starvation. He said those dead are Makhanmal Paharia, 25, of Hariharpara, Lakshmanmal Paharia, 30, and Raheda Bibi, 35, of Choa and Budhanmal Paharia, 28, and Sadhanmal Paharia, 40, of Gaznipur.

 About three months ago, the alleged starvation deaths of about half-a-dozen people at Amlashol had rocked Bengal. The chief minister had denied that the deaths were a result of starvation but admitted that ?conditions of starvation? prevailed in the parts of West Midnapore.

 Prasad has asked the Behrampore subdivisional officer to visit the villages tomorrow. He said: ?I have also asked the block development officer to conduct a probe.?

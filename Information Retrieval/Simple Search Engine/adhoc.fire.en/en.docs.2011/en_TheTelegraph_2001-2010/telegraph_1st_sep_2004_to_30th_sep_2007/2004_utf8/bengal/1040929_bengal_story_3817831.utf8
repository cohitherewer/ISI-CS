 CM sees Naxalites in city

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 28: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today vowed to prevent Bengal from being made a Naxalite corridor but conceded that the rebels have a presence in the city.

 The extremists have a ?committee? in Calcutta. ?We are aware of their activities here,? the chief minister said. But Bengal will not let the militants use its territory, he added. 

 ?We will safeguard our borders and not allow the extremists to use Bengal as a corridor. The PW-MCC (People?s War-Maoist Communist Centre) has a presence in three districts in Bengal and they are using Bihar as a corridor with Nepal, not our state.? 

 Bhattacharjee said the militants would not be able to hold public meetings in the districts where they have bases. 

 Earlier, he met the outgoing Nepal consul-general, Yuba Raj Bhusal, and shared the Himalayan Kingdom?s concern about increasing presence of militants in the region.

 Bhusal said: ?The activities of the Maoists and (the) People?s War in Nepal, Andhra Pradesh, Orissa, parts of Bengal and Jharkhand is a matter of common concern for the two countries. They are working together and want to destabilise this region.? 

 However, Bhattacharjee did not agree that it is ?common concern?. He said: ?The problem of Maoists in Nepal is most crucial ? the government and the army are unable to cope with the situation.?

 Bhusal tried to strengthen his point by underlining the possibility of foreign hands behind the spurt in militant activity. ?May be, there are external forces as well?. Together, they want to make this area a revolutionary zone and we have to tackle it together as a common problem,? he said.

 Bhusal said the Nepal government is working on a peaceful negotiation with the Maoists. ?May be the talks will happen soon,? he said.

 In his bid to protect the state?s porous border with Nepal, Bhattacharjee recently requested Delhi to deploy the Indo-Tibetan Border Police there. 

 ?The Maoists are holding on to Mao?s old ideas and cannot survive,? he added.

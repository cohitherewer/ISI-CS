 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, Dec. 18: State health officials, desperate to submit a compliance report before the Supreme Court, today carried out the counselling of 69 students to be admitted to SSKM and Midnapore Medical Colleges. The apex court had directed that all should be admitted and allowed to attend classes from Monday.

 The counselling was held at the central selection committee?s office at Medical College from the afternoon in presence of the principal Dr Jayshree Mitra, even as students of the NRI quota continued their agitation at the SSKM Medical College. 

 Calcutta: A 22-year-old student of a private engineering college died when a state transport corporation bus coming out of Garia depot on Saturday night knocked down three youths standing nearby. The engineering student died on the spot, while two others were taken to M.R. Bangur Hospital.

 Suri: Tiger Singh alias Afroz Khan, who had raided Suri hospital last year and shot a hospital staff after taking patients hostage, was on Saturday sentenced to 10 years in jail by the third additional sessions judge. Khan had entered the hospital on September 5, 2003, and had held patients and employees at gunpoint. The judge also slapped a fine of Rs 8,000.

 Bolpur: The Bolpur College authorities received a temporary injunction from a fast track court on Saturday regarding the college election scheduled to be held on December 20.

 Doctors in Delhi with ills in focus

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 11: Increasing 

 female foeticide in the city will feature prominently in 

 talks a 50-member women doctors? contingent from here will 

 have with the Union health ministry. 

 The team, which is already in Delhi, will also discuss the inadequate basic health infrastructure and lobby with the Centre to devise a strategy to improve the situation. 

 ?In healthcare, preference is given to VIP and posh areas within the metro, the middle-class and the poor have few options. The rural healthcare delivery system has failed and there are no private healthcare facilities for the downtrodden, even in the city. The time has come to discuss these issues openly and without reservations,? said R.D. Dubey, a joint secretary of the Indian Medical Association, the organisers of the national women doctors? convention now underway in the capital.

 According to doctors, the ills plaguing the city are many but especially female foeticide, anaemia, unsafe abortions and malnutrition among women. ?We are a big failure on the population front with a dismal 7 per cent married women using contraceptives. Many resort to unsafe methods and safe abortions and deliveries are still a distant dream,? said Kalpana Chakraborty, who is part of the team. 

 Pre-birth elimination of the girl child has increased manifold. ?Unfortunately, technology has made it possible to determine the sex of an unborn child. Worse, the girl child gets step-motherly treatment at home and is deprived of nutrition and care,? said Geeta Ganguli Mukherjee, who is leading the Bengal team in Delhi.

 According to health department statistics, over 90 per cent of girls below six are anaemic across the state. Ganguli Mukherjee said: ?It is the root cause for 40 per cent of maternal deaths.?

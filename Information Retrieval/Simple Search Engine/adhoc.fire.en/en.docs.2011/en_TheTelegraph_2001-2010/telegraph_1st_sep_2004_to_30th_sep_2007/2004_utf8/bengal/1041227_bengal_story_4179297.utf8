 Five of family killed for revenge

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Barasat, Dec. 26: Five members of a family, including an eight-year-old boy, were beaten to death with bamboo sticks and stabbed with daggers this morning at Dhuchnikhalin, about 90 km from Calcutta.

 North 24-Parganas police chief Praveen Kumar said the killings were to avenge the murder of one Dinu Kapali yesterday. BJP backer Nani Mondal allegedly killed Dinu, who is said to be a CPM supporter, after a clash. Those killed today were Nani?s parents, his elder brother and his wife and their son. 

 Kumar, who left for the village this evening, said: ?Senior officers and Rapid Action Force jawans are now in the area,? 

 An official of Sandeshkhali police station said tonight: ?We discovered Dinu?s body floating in a pond this morning. In course of our investigation, we came to know that there was a political link to the murder,? 

 Official said about a dozen of Dinu?s associates then marched to Nani?s house looking for him. Not finding him, they attacked his family members. Neighbours who had gathered after hearing the screams for help, ran away after being threatened.

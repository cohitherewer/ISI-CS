 Father stabbed, shadow on daughter

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Sept. 22: Two 

 youths entered the house of a retired state electricity 

 board employee this afternoon posing as television mechanics 

 and stabbed him to death. His wife was injured trying to 

 save him from the attackers. 

 Police have arrested a suspect, Munna, who admitted that he knew Chaitali, the couple?s only daughter. The 22-year-old is a student of Fakirchand College. 

 Preliminary investigation has led police to believe that the duo gained entry into the house at Civil Courtpara in Diamond Harbour, about 70 km from Calcutta, taking advantage of their acquaintance with Chaitali. 

 Tarun Deb, 58, took voluntary retirement as an accounts officer from the West Bengal State Electricity Board nearly a year ago and ran a rent-a-car business. He had two cars ? a Contessa and an Ambassador. 

 Police believe the finger of suspicion points at Chaitali. 

 ?It is intriguing Chaitali, instead of raising a hue and cry on seeing her parents attacked, kept herself locked in a separate room,? Bhuban Chandra Mondal, South 24-Parganas additional superintendent of police (rural) said. 

 He added police are yet to interrogate Chaitali as she is in a state of shock. ?Moreover, she is attending to her mother who is fighting for life at the Diamond Harbour sub-divisional hospital,? he said. ?Munna also told us he was a regular visitor to the Debs?,? he added. 

 A senior police official quoted Munna as saying Chaitali had tried to prevail on her father to sell one of his cars to him. ?But Deb refused, pleading it would hamper his business,? he said.

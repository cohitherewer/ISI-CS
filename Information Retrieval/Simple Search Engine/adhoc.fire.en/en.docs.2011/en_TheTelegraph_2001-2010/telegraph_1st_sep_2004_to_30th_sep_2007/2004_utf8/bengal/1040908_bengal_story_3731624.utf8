 Mother minus marriage wages war

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Lalgola, Sept. 7: An unwed mother in this town of Murshidabad district today filed a complaint against her childs father after waiting five years for him to make good his promise to marry her once he landed a job.

 However, five months after he became a teacher, Imran Hossain has chosen to marry another girl instead of Tuera Khatoon, 18, mother of his five-year-old son.

 A furious Tuera, a resident of Chamarpara in Lalgola, about 250 km from Calcutta, reacted by writing a letter to the National Commission for Women.

 Tueras plight has moved Murshidabad superintendent of police Gyanwant Singh.

 I am surprised to know that a five-year-old boy is growing up without proper knowledge of his father. I received the complaint today and started a case. I will get Imran Hossain arrested, Singh said.

 The mothers complaint says she was 13 when she visited her aunt at Gorabazar, Behrampore, in 1998. She met her cousin Imran at that time.

 Imran told me he loved me and we developed a physical relationship. Soon I became pregnant. When I told my aunt, she refused to accept the relationship and drove me out of the house, Tuera said.

 Police said village elders met to resolve the problem but Imran refused to marry Tuera.

 But Imran took me aside and told me he was unemployed and unable to marry and take the responsibility of a child at that moment. He told me he would marry me as soon he got a job. On July 22, 1999, my son was born, the teenager said.

 Imran landed a job as a teacher at a Malda high school through the School Service Commission six months ago. I heard he got the job but he did not contact me after that. I also have information that he is trying to marry another girl, Tuera said.

 In her complaint to Singh, she has demanded that her sons father marry her.

 The police said Tuera belongs to a poor family of six brothers and a sister. Her mother, who was deserted by her husband, worked as a maid to bring up the children. 

 Tueras two older brothers earn a living by plying cycle-rickshaws.

 Imran hails from a relatively well-off family his father, a resident of Gorabazar, is a government employee. His family also has ancestral property in Murshidabads Sagardighi.

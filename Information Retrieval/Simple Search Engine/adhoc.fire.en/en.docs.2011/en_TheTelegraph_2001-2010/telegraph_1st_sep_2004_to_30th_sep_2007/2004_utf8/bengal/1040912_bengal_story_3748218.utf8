 New complex

 Durgapur, Sept. 11: Industry minister Nirupam Sen today said an industrial complex would come up at Jamuria where about 700 acres have been earmarked for setting up new sponge-iron units, reports our correspondent.

 The existing sponge-iron units are not taking measures to stop pollution, Sen said at a seminar on Growing Pollution and Environment organised by the Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industries.

 Sen said the sponge-iron units at Mangalpur and Kanksa, about 200 km from Calcutta, have been asked to plant at least 10,000 trees to contain pollution. ?The increasing air pollution and iron dust pose a threat to the human habitat.?

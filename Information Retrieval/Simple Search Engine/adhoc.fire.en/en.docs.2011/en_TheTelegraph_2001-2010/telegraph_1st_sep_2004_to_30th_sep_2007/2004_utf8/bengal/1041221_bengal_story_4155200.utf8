 500-year-old palace dug out

 History revisited: The ruins at Gaur Malda. A Telegraph picture

 Malda, Dec. 20: Archaeologists excavating the ruins at Gour Malda have stumbled upon an entire palace complex over 500 years old, complete with zenana khanas and what seems to be a mint.

 At the site, Archaeological Survey of India?s (ASI) men are carefully brushing away layers of soil from what seem like large brick kilns where, most probably, the former nawabs of Bengal used expert metallurgists to mint coins. 

 Inside the kilns, the ashes ? still intact from the last fire that burned ? are also being dusted away by the workers. 

 Led by P.K. Nayar, an ASI team of 30 employees and 51 labourers resumed work on the ruins on December 6. 

 Interestingly, though this slice of history faded into oblivion about half a millennium ago, the area is still known as ?tankshal?, mint in Bengali.

 The ASI has been excavating at the site from 2003 to unearth the capital of the region that once comprised Bihar, Bengal and Orissa. According to ASI sources, the area has still a lot to throw up and is slated to become an important destination for historical tourism.

 Bimal Chattopadhyay, the ASI director for the eastern zone, said: ?It was in the 15th century, during the reign of Nawab of Bengal Rukmuddin Barbak Shah, that this palace complex was built. The brick and mortar palace had a roof made of wood. It was burnt down when Sher Shah ransacked it.?

 The archaeologist confirmed that the royal mint has been unearthed and that there is evidence of water-ducts to keep the palace cool in summer. ?It is clear from what we have found that the nawab was resourceful, as revealed in the documentation of noted historian Abed Ali Khan,? Chattopadhyay said.

 The boundary wall of the complex has also been excavated, though a major portion of it had collapsed. The palace is spread over a 700m-by-300m area. Chattopadhyay said steps would be taken to ensure the remains of the original wall are preserved.

 ?The ASI decided to carry out the excavation so that Gour Malda could be presented to Indian and foreign tourists,? the director said.

 That the Ganga once flowed past the palace is evident from the discovery of a ghat a few hundred metres away. At the old jetty, there still hangs bits and pieces of iron chains that were possibly used to moor budgerows and ships.

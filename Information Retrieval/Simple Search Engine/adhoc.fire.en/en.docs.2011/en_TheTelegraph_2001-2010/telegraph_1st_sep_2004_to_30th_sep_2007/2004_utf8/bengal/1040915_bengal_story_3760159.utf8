 Playing doctor, broom in hand

 DEBASISH CHATTERJEE

 Calcutta, Sept. 14: Ganesh Das begins his day broom in hand and ends it with scalpel in fingers, more than once.

 That?s because he is both sweeper and ?doctor? at Ramchandrapur primary health centre in Diamond Harbour, nearly 90 km from Calcutta.

 Das says he had to shoulder the dual responsibility because ?we have no qualified doctor to run the clinic?.

 ?Since the health centre was set up, I have been in charge of it despite my appointment by the government as a sweeper,? said the son of a farmer.

 His day starts early, with a broom and buckets of water. ?I have to clean the building and the adjacent grounds before taking care of the patients.?

 Then, to the doctor?s chair to listen to villagers? ailments. He listens to them, ?diagnoses? the disease and prescribes medicines.

 Das attributes it all to his observant childhood at Ramchandrapur when his family members would fall ill and travel 45 km to Diamond Harbour Hospital.

 ?I remember the medicines given to them by doctors for various diseases. I also remember the medicines I took when I was ill.?

 Falling back on his memories, ?I prescribe a Crocin or a Calpol tablet if someone has fever?, says Das.

 ?If someone comes with an upset stomach, I ask him to take a few Enterozyme tablets. I have seen them prescribed by doctors for these particular symptoms,? he adds.

 And Das is particular about ?updating? himself by speaking to some medicine-shop owners. ?Earlier, I would ask villagers to use Iodex for backaches. Now, I recommend Volini or Moove.?

 ?I have even taken care of boils with scalpels without any help,? he adds, admitting ?I know my limitations and can only handle small cases?.

 Daud Ali Ghorami, a villager who had donated the 10 bighas on which the health centre stands and Rs 10,000, has little hope left.

 ?I had felt the need for a hospital so that the poor and the needy could get proper healthcare. But now, I am doubtful whether this clinic will ever function properly,? he said.

 It was built in 2000 with funds from the World Bank as part of a project to develop rural health infrastructure.

 Chief medical officer of health Pradeep Kumar Mondol promised ?necessary action? but said he was ?not aware? of the situation at Ramchandrapur. ?I will ask our block medical officer of health to visit the place and submit a report,? he added.

 Awami patients 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Sept. 5: A large number of members of Sheikh Hasinas Awami League injured in the grenade blasts at her rally in Dhaka on August 21 has opted for the safety and professionalism of nursing homes in India. 

 At least 19 leaders, including a former member of the cabinet, are receiving treatment in various private clinics. The last group of about seven arrived in Calcutta on Friday and was taken straight to a hospital from the airport. 

 They were admitted under the care of senior doctors and most have been operated upon for multiple splinter injuries. Their condition is far from normal and we would require some more time to carry on with the observation, said Dr Sudipto Mitra, the medical superintendent of the private hospital.

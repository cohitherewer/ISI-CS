 Ransom fails to free boy, CID called in 

 OUR BUREAU 

Calcutta, Dec. 18: The inability of Howrah 

police to track down a boy and his kidnappers, who have walked off with the ransom 

without releasing him, has prompted the government to hand over the case to the 

Criminal Investigation Department. 

 State police chief Shyamal Dutta today asked CID sleuths to take the responsibility of tracing four-and-a-half-year-old Ganesh Palodhi, who was snatched from outside his house at Dakshin Budikhali, under Bauria police station, on December 3. 

 ?From now, CID will look after the case and we will assist them,? said Howrah superintendent of police Mihir Kumar Bhattacharya. 

 ?My house is just opposite my godown. On the day of the incident, Ganesh was riding his bicycle in front of my house. Before leaving the godown around 9.30 am, I asked an employee, Shaktipada Hazra, to look after him,? said Siddhartha Palodhi, a businessman. 

 He returned around 10.45 am to find his son was missing. ?I first asked Shaktipada. He said he thought Ganesh had gone with me,? recalled Palodhi. After a futile search, he lodged a missing complaint with the police. 

 Next day, a ransom call shocked Palodhi and his wife Konica. ?The first call came around 12 noon and the caller demanded Rs 25 lakh. I told the person that it was impossible,? said Palodhi. 

 He collected the PCO number from where the call was made. ?My phone has CLI facility. I contacted Bauria police and gave them the number,? he said. 

 The next call came around 5 pm on December 8. In between, he said the local police did nothing. ?This time the demand was scaled down to 2.5 lakh... I pleaded again with the kidnappers and after a 10-minute discussion, the deal was settled for Rs 1.25 lakh,? recalled Palodhi. 

 On December 10, Palodhi received several reminders from the kidnappers. 

 ?They called four times from two telephone numbers. I told them that I could manage Rs 72,000 and they agreed. They asked me to wrap the money in black cloth and keep it at the south-west corner of a pond close to my house. I relayed the entire conversation to the local police. They told me to go ahead and pay the money,? he said. 

 The money is gone and his son hasn?t come back.

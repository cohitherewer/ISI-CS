 Analysts to tackle tech course trauma

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Dec. 1: Sandip Banerjee, a student of information technology at a private engineering college in south Calcutta, left the institution last month a year after he joined the course. He felt it was too tough for him.

 Two Bengal University of Engineering and Science students committed suicide in hostel around the middle of this year after bouts of depression. 

 After schools started engaging psychologists to help children suffering from stress-related problems, engineering colleges across the city are now busy looking for professionals who can identify ?mental aberrations? in their students and suggest remedies.

 The move comes in the wake of a recent directive from the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), which makes it compulsory for every engineering college and management institute to have facilities to monitor students? behavioural problems.

 ?Counselling of students has become a very important part of engineering education, particularly in the light of the kind of high efficiency the companies are expecting from graduates,? said N.R. Banerjee, the vice-chancellor of Bengal University of Engineering and Science, earlier known as BE College.

 ?The council was right in introducing psychological counselling in engineering and management institutions. We will be appointing a psychologist soon. He is expected to start attending to the students this month,? Banerjee said.

 Sources in the council?s Calcutta office said the counselling cells are expected to identify the following:

 Depression and its roots

 Whether a student is inclined to rag a junior

 Whether a student is unable to tackle the syllabus

 Other oddities in behaviour

 Manoj Mitra, the dean of technology at Jadavpur University, said: ?After passing out of engineering colleges, many students are placed in high positions in top-notch companies, where they are expected to take a lot of work load and tackle complex situations. We are trying to help the students overcome weaknesses and build a strong a personality so that they are ready to tackle any situation even after they complete the course.?

 Silajit Ghosh, director, Future Institute of Engineering and Management, said: ?We have engaged a psychologist and are planning to make counselling a regular affair.?

 Council officials said stray suicides by engineering students, instances of students quitting studies mid-way or neglecting studies occurred earlier, too, but they are more common now. ?We need to ensure that such incidents are minimised as much as possible,? said an official. 

 No company worth its weight, he added, would like to pick a student who repeats years. Similarly, they may also not like to take students from an institution where too many incidents of suicides and ragging take place.

 LOOK BEYOND FIGURES

 Amitava Banerjee

 Mamata Banerjee perhaps thinks otherwise, but people with disability in India have enough reasons to celebrate World Disability Day on December 3. Their movement has compelled the government to take into account the disability factor. Census 2001 is the first census to include statistical data related to disability. 

 It lists 21,906,769 persons as being disabled, a figure much less than that in the National Sample Survey of India. The main reason behind the discrepancy can be attributed to the fact that only five categories of disability have been considered in the census ? vision, hearing, speech, movement and mental. But there are other kinds of disablement, unrelated to or distantly related to the specified five. There are people who move, but with difficulty, some others have non-functional upper limbs. Autism has also not been included. Dyslexia, haemophilia and so many other types of disability have not been considered. 

 Moreover, surveyors are not properly trained to identify the right person for the right category. The problem of placement in cases of multiple disability remains. There is another vital point. Many parents feel shy to disclose to any outsider the disability of their children. Because of their withholding of facts, the truth remains untold. But despite this, the government effort should be applauded.

 Low literacy

 Of the 22 million disabled, the percentage of males is greater (57.5 per cent) than females (42.5 per cent). This picture remains the same for both urban and rural areas. The reason behind a greater percentage of disability among males should be identified. Preventive measures should be taken to reduce the number of the disabled. This data will also allow the government to make proper budgetary allocations for the education, employment and rehabilitation of the disabled. 

 Only half the challenged people are literate. Sexual discrimination among them in matters of education is far acute than in the general population. Only 15.5 per cent of disabled females and one-third of disabled males are literate. It is worse in rural India. But this ratio is better among those with locomotor and visual impairment. The figures are worst among the mentally retarded. 

 The figures ring a warning bell, especially since the financial grant of the government to special schools for the disabled is being curtailed every year. The fees burden is being transferred to the pupils, resulting in increasing dropout rates. 

 Under the carpet

 The government is not only contradicting its policy, but also inducing NGOs to involve themselves in organizing sponsors from home and abroad, thus creating an unhealthy competition. Programmes for integrated education have to be intensified and expanded.

 Another problem. Only one-third of the challenged population is employed. Around 60 per cent people with movement and visual impairments are unemployed and nearly 80 per cent of the mentally retarded are jobless. The scenario in rural India is slightly better as 37 per cent are engaged in specified work in the fields or in the cottage industry. 

 Since both Central and state governments have practically stopped recruitment, the policy of 3 per cent reservation for the disabled has become unworkable. The only hope is in the private sector. Here jobs have either to be created according to the abilities of the challenged people or special training imparted to them . The industries can be awarded some tax concession against such employment. More employment fairs can be held to acquaint recruiters with the skills of the disabled. The process has started, but more time is needed for the disabled to get their due. Perhaps the next census might look different.

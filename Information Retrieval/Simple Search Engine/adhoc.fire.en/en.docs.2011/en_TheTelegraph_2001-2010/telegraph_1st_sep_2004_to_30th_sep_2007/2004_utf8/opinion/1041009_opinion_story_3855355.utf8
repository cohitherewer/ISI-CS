 OUTSIDE THE RESPECTABLE

 Sometimes, all that it takes to see through stigma and conditioning is the ability to act on the simplest human impulse. When Soorya was taken to see a shelter for HIV+ children in Chennai, what struck her before anything else was the children?s evident craving for physical affection. They crowded around her and the other women who came with her, trying to hold the women?s hands and stroke their faces. This was a ?turning point? in her life because she found herself wondering why she should not try to overcome the mental block and hold a child in her arms. And this led to another extraordinary question: ?Why should I reserve all my love and affection for healthy children?? She came back home, thought about the matter, and then, with the full support of her husband, sons and neighbours, decided to adopt Subha, one-and-a-half-years old and HIV+. Not the least extraordinary aspect of Soorya?s and her husband?s action is the fact that they live in a Chennai slum. The husband, Gajendran, is a casual labourer and ex-alcoholic, without a steady income and financially dependant on his mother- and brother-in-law. But they send their two little boys to school, and have now adopted a daughter whose medical future is deeply uncertain and likely to be expensive. And ? no less important ? the NGO running Subha?s shelter deemed them fit to adopt her and has seen the legal process through after putting both parents through intensive vigilance and training in special paediatric care.

 Children who have been affected by HIV/AIDS, directly and indirectly, are now an alarming, but still largely invisible, factor in the global HIV/AIDS scenario. They have lost one or both parents to AIDS, are themselves infected through their mothers in most cases, and are also miserably poor, apart from being traumatized by their parents? illness and death, and by their own destitution. They mostly end up on the streets, or get trafficked, or are made to labour, all of which, in turn, increase their risk of infection, if they are not already infected, and deprive them of all their rights. The current global estimate for AIDS orphans is 14 million, and is likely to become 44 million by 2010. Around 1.8 million orphans live in south and south-east Asia. In Zimbabwe, 45 per cent of children under five are HIV+, few of whom will live to be ten, given the usual incubation period of the virus. Among orphans, the female child is usually the hardest hit, often dropping out of school to take on family responsibilities.

 In India, one of the greatest sources of stigma and discrimination against HIV/AIDS, and perhaps the biggest hindrance to prevention, is middle-class respectability. To adopt Subha was Soorya?s decision ? but she had the crucial support of her husband, her family, her neighbours and the NGO. Perhaps it was in the ethos of a slum, outside the margins of respectability, that such a human community could be formed.

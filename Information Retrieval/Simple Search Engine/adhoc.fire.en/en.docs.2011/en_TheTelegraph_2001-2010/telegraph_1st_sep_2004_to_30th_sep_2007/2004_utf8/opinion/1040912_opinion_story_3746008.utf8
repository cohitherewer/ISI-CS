 AFTER KILLING CHILDREN

 How much smaller did the militants want them to be? As the images of cowering, traumatized, wounded and dead children from the desecrated school in Beslan go out into the world, this is perhaps the only question that seems relevant. On the third anniversary of the World Trade Center devastation, the world is still learning new definitions of the concept known as humanity. There is no evil, no hitherto inconceivable cruelty of which human beings are incapable. The siege at the Beslan school was not like a bombing operation, where the perpetrators could take refuge behind distance, invisibility and anonymity. In this operation, criminals and victims were designed to be face-to-face in a steaming, airless gymnasium lined with bombs, where children could be shot at point blank range, where older children could be asked to throw the dead bodies of their younger schoolmates out of the window, and a little boy racked with thirst could be bayonetted when he asked for water.

 There will be time to discuss the failures of Russia?s Chechnya policy, for in the rising spiral of hatred and bloodshed, there is always a generating moment. But now there is another question. Do those Chechens who want independence from Russia feel that their cause has been served? That is impossible, because the siege in Beslan has become identified worldwide with the most extreme revulsion and grief. That would mean that the predicament of the ordinary Chechen is far more tragic than it could have been imagined to be before Beslan. Terrorists have hijacked his dream and turned it into pure nightmare. Inhuman cruelty is also truly stupid: it goes out of its way to serve its perceived enemy. The Russian government needs no other weapon in its publicity arsenal to appeal to its own people than images of dying toddlers in the arms of unbelieving adults, of children scarred and bleeding from bullet wounds, of row upon row of bags full of twisted, mangled young limbs. And it only has to talk about ?Islamists? to the powers outside its boundaries to achieve the rest.

 Beslan is another watershed in the history of terrorism, and its effects may turn out to be more significant than those of 9/11. The most striking outcome so far has been a sudden clear voice being heard above the grief, the voice of the courageous, clear-thinking Muslim. By speaking out in unqualified condemnation of the Beslan attack, of all such attacks and killings, by differentiating uncompromisingly between the ordinary person of the community and the blood-thirsty, suicidal figure now so familiar all over the world, this voice is doing the world a great service. To this, the refusal of the radical groups to condemn Beslan is in telling contrast. Perhaps they are wondering how to escalate the horror, what is left to do after the destruction of children.

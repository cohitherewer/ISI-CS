 LOST IN THE MAYHEM

 A DAY IN THE LIFE OF

 The crossing at Bansdroni is heard to have driven a homeguard to nervous breakdown 

 Spirit of the times

 The distance between Tollygunge and Garia ought to be covered comfortably in half an hour. But life is not destined to be comfortable in this stretch, given the inevitability of an unscheduled, and tortuous, halt midway ? at the Bansdroni four-lane crossing. The crossing suffers from an embarrassment of riches ? a supermarket, bus-stop, two schools and a church with the picture of a beaming Christ painted on its wall. On a wet Monday morning, on my way to Garia, the autorickshaw in which I was travelling got caught in the traffic and came to the usual halt right in front of the church. It was only then that I noticed that the smile on Christ?s face had been replaced by a frown, no doubt by the sight that greeted his eyes.

 In the days of yore, Bansdroni was infamous for more reasons than one. The entire stretch was covered with thick vegetation and home to venomous snakes. Robberies were also not uncommon. The horrors have just found new incarnations with the passage of time. Among them are the condition of the road and the traffic, ghastly enough to chill you. 

 On the right, my stationary autorickshaw was flanked by a vegetable cart on its way to the supermarket. The cart-driver made frantic attempts to pull his run-down vehicle out of a pothole the size of a crater. With each pull, he lost a vegetable ? a brinjal here, a cabbage there ? which kept rolling in the slush like severed heads. On our left was a private bus, warming its engine for the journey ahead. Irked by the honking of a cab from behind, the bus let out a blast of black smoke through the exhaust right onto the cab-driver?s face. As if in response to the little tit-for-tat, joyous shrieks drowned the traffic noises for a moment. Children from the two schools poured out onto the streets oblivious of the vehicles all around. Two mothers, with children in tow, were discussing how their wards were doing in school right in the middle of the narrow road, impeding both vision and movement. 

 ?Where is the traffic sergeant?? I shouted at the auto-driver, barely able to contain my indignation. He replied, chuckling, that a homeguard had been posted at the crossing some months ago after five appeals to the local councillor. Unable to control chaos of such magnitude, this homeguard had suffered a breakdown. The poor man, now convalescing in a south Calcutta clinic, still tries to find ways to manage the bottleneck in his imagination. There are others who have suffered a harsher fate, added the driver. The churchyard, it is believed, is haunted by the spirits of those who could not make it across the Bansdroni crossing. I did not disbelieve him after what I had just witnessed.

 And yet, this was no more than another instance of the twin failures ? civic and of the state. Potholed roads, traffic snarls and the maddened policeman fitted neatly with the insolent bus-driver, careless mothers and indifferent pedestrians. The mayhem at the crossing reflected the spirit of our lives and times, and the reason why for every two steps forward, we take a step back.

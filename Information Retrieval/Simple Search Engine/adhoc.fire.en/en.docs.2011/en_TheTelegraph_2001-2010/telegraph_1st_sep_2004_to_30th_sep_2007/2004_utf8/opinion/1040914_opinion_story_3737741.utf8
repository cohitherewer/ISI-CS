 Letters to Editor

 Talking too much

 Sir ? What was so special about ?Musharraf man on secret trip? (Sept 11) to catapult the event to the front page on Saturday? Yes, India and Pakistan are not the best of friends, and the meeting between Tariq Aziz, secretary to Pakistan?s National Security Council, and our national security adviser, J.N. Dixit, was kept a secret. But such meetings and dialogues come a dime a dozen. And only the eternally optimistic will see this trip as a major step towards loosening the knotty ties between the neighbours. Such scepticism is not without reason. Islamabad is known to harbour hopes of Pervez Musharraf convincing Manmohan Singh to accept its terms on Kashmir, and still ensure that the peace progress stays on course. The general?s conceit seems quite incredible when one remembers that the Pakistani army chose to infiltrate into Kargil while the long-awaited Agra summit was on.

 Yours faithfully, 

A. Mandal, Calcutta

 Figure it out

 Sir ? It is not true, as is being claimed, that the fertility rate is the highest among Muslims vis-a-vis the other communities. I have studied fertility around the world, with the available fertility data for countries from the 12th century. Fertility rates have nothing to do with religion. Moreover, urban fertility rates are lower than rural fertility rates across the world, with no statistically significant exception. The thing to note is that the cost of educating children, in terms of time too, is so high that parents are compelled to have fewer children, sometimes even against the religious prohibition on birth control. 

 What is also true is that the fertility rate is below replacement in every developed country (meaning that these countries will eventually shrink in population). Schemes to provide financial help to raise children have all failed to boost fertility rates. But thriving still is the misconception that social welfare schemes encourage women to breed like rabbits so they can stay on welfare. The fear that Muslims are growing in number is baseless. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? The Bharatiya Janata Party chief, M. Venkaiah Naidu, feels that the trend of declining Hindu and rising Muslim populations is not good for the country (?Census on BJP plate?, Sept 8). Would he have been so disturbed had the census report showed the reverse trend? If India is the secular country that it claims to be, there should be no objection even if it turns into a Muslim-majority nation. 

 Yours faithfully,

Kajal Chatterjee, Sodepur

 Sir ? It is being apprehended that the Muslim population will overtake the Hindu one in the years to come. But what is probably of more import is that with the current rates of growth of all the communities, the population figure will be a staggering one very soon. One also has to factor in starvation, which is an inevitable fallout of a burgeoning population. 

 Yours faithfully,

Partho Datta, Calcutta 

 Sir ? In India, where religion, caste and creed hold a lot of sway, the new census figures are quite revealing. But then statistics on population, like exit polls, are riddled with imponderables and uncertainties. The government, even as it takes into account the census results, must accord more importance to the skewed sex ratios and the low literacy rates among women. It could consider handling the problem of female foeticide more firmly and making more women literate in order to achieve balanced development. 

 Yours faithfully,

Raghubir Singh, Pune

 Sir ? While it is true that the growth of the Muslim population is because of low literacy rates among them and their economic backwardness, another reason is their being misguided by the half-educated mullahs (?School and jobs cry after census?, Sept 8). The Mullahs teach uneducated Muslims that using contraceptives is gunah (offence) and a violation of the shariat. A somewhat similar thing was witnessed during the polio eradication campaigns when the mullahs claimed that the campaigns were an American policy to make the Muslim child infertile and reduce the Muslim population of the world. Demographers in India should focus more on the problem of population control. Blaming Muslims for their fertility or for not using contraceptives is not the solution. Ensuring education for them is. 

 Yours faithfully,

Abdus Samad, Inchon, South Korea

 Sir ? The editorial, ?Value neutral? (Sept 8), points out that the sangh parivar will exploit the census report to suit its interests. This is true, the report will be handy to the parivar while it goes about spewing venom against the Muslims. It will expectedly fall back on its pet line, that there is a sinister design behind Muslims producing more children. 

 Yours faithfully, 

Shadab Ahsan, Gaya

 Sir ? One does not necessarily have to be a religious fanatic to understand the implications of the census data on population growth rates of different religious groups in India. If the current growth rates continue, there will roughly be about three Hindus for every Muslim by 2050 and only about two Hindus for every Muslim by the turn of the next century. This is simple arithmetic which cannot be ignored or hidden under any veil of ?neutrality?. 

 Yours faithfully,

Saumitra Banerjee, Hereford, UK

 Sir ? The correlation between high growth and low literacy rates among Muslims points to the need for proper education and uplift of the minority community. However, the role of the media is not any less important than that of the politicians. Had the media taken up the important issue of birth control in earnest, the picture would have been very different. 

 Yours faithfully,

Tapan Das Gupta, Calcutta

 IN FAVOUR OF DIVERSITY

 There is a lesson for India in the two US rulings which show that the American private sector supports reservation, writes Ellora Puri

 Some affirmative action, please

 The common minimum programme of the United Progressive Alliance government has promised to extend reservation for scheduled castes, scheduled tribes and other backward classes to the private sector. This has sparked off a fierce debate. The arguments for and against have made repeated references to the recent United States supreme court judgment regarding the feasibility and desirability of affirmative action programmes.

 The judgment consists of two separate rulings passed on June 23, 2003 by the US supreme court ? one was passed in the case of Grutter vs Bollinger and the other in the Gratz vs Bollinger case. Both the cases were filed against the race-conscious admissions policy of the University of Michigan. The ruling in the former case upheld the university?s law school admissions policy and in the latter found the university?s undergraduate admissions policy unconstitutional. These seemingly contradictory rulings actually drew their justifications from the same set of principles. Both the rulings upheld the constitutionality of race-conscious admissions policies designed to promote diversity in higher education. The reason why they differed was because in spite of the same goal, the law school admissions policy differed substantially from the undergraduate admissions policy on the means to reach that end.

 The court essentially put the two policies through a five-point test: whether the programme offered competitive review of all applications; whether it provided flexible, individualized consideration of applicants so that race was only one of the several factors being considered; whether the institution had considered workable race-neutral alternatives to its programme; whether the programme put undue burden on non-minority applicants; and whether it was limited in time.

 According to the court, policies which are based on quotas are undesirable because they ?insulate the individual from comparison with all other candidates for the available seats?. Flexibility and individual consideration, in turn, require that a race-conscious policy has to consider at least some non-racial factors to ensure that ?all factors that may contribute to student body diversity are meaningfully considered alongside race in admissions decisions.? For the court, a fair and flexible admissions process that considers both non-racial and racial factors would ensure that non-minorities are competitive with minorities, and will therefore not put an undue burden on them. And finally, the court emphasized the need to have a logical end to a race-conscious policy that is a ?deviation from the norm of equal treatment of all racial and ethnic groups.? The law school passed muster on all the points. The undergraduate programme did not fulfil these requirements as its admissions policy was based on a point system, which allocated a fixed number of points for underrepresented minority group members, thus giving them undue advantage on the basis of their race.

 While the entire case for reservation in India is based on claims of social justice, the opposition to it argues solely on grounds of efficiency. The industry, and economists supporting its case, hold that reservation would undermine its competitive capacity in the international market. It has further been argued that reservation would inhibit the flow of foreign investment. The debate on the subject presumes an inherent dichotomy between the two objectives. Even V.P. Singh, who claims to have ushered ?in the first real revolution in independent India?, by implementing the Mandal Commission recommendations, doesn?t favour reservation ?at the cost of global competitiveness?. He, however, advises ?to follow the American pattern and see how they protect the minorities?. 

 But what is the American model? According to the judgment of the US supreme court, quoted above, the benefits of affirmative action ?are not theoretical but real, as major American businesses have made clear that the skills needed in today?s increasingly global marketplace can only be developed through exposure to widely diverse people, cultures, ideas, and viewpoints.? In fact, these rulings support affirmative action on the grounds of social utility. 

 In a separate line of cases, the US supreme court has also upheld the use of race-conscious and gender-conscious affirmative action programmes in private employment. In United Steelworkers of America vs Weber (1979), for example, the court upheld the use of race-conscious affirmative action policies that correct a conspicuous racial imbalance in traditionally segregated job categories, but do not ?unnecessarily trammel? the interests of non-minorities and do not pose a bar to their advancement. The court has passed similar judgments in favour of gender-conscious affirmative action. The relevant point here is that affirmative action-based recruitment programmes have benefited the industry. And these were based not just on arguments for remedying past racism/sexism but on grounds of diversity contributing to more competitive and efficient industry. The fears ? inefficiency, incompetence and uncompetitiveness ? of the Indian industry therefore seem to be misplaced.

 However, the two University of Michigan cases might point to the reason why reservation, if equated with quota, might be considered problematic by the industry. One, quotas create a segregated group which can always be accused of being uncompetitive. Two, quotas, as in the Indian case, might result in the ?creamy layer? taking over seats meant for the truly disadvantaged sections, as they do not provide for individualized attention to each applicant?s case. And three, fixing a quota means at times providing for a token presence of certain groups without ensuring that they have the proper skills and numbers to make a difference.

 What is the lesson from the American experiment? The most important one is that the arguments for affirmative action-based recruitment programmes came from the industry itself and not from the government. For the industry found it to be in its interest. The two US supreme court rulings provide a meaningful set of guidelines by which the private industry can ensure diversity and incorporation of individuals from different sections of the society without forsaking the goals that they feel would be compromised by policies promoting reservations ? competition and efficiency. Therefore, instead of appealing to the social conscience of the industry, an appeal to its enlightened self-interest may get a better response.

 Out and About

Once upon a time, Yoko ?Lennon? Ono had found in nudity 

the perfect vehicle to glory with her naked in-bed campaign with late husband 

John. Now, the former Beatle?s (in)famous wife has decided on a rewind. Ono is 

going in the buff at 71, as part of an art exhibition at Tate in London. She?s 

replaying a 40-year old show, Cut Piece, which involves her sitting on a bed (again!) 

and her garments being snipped off one by one. Will someone please tell her such 

antics went out of style 30 years ago?

 Anita Desai

India?s pass? for Anita Desai. The author?s latest book, The Zigzag Way, released at the Edinburgh Festival last week, is set in Mexico. Desai, who?s been writing mostly about the Indian middle class, says she can?t identify with India anymore. Considering she hadn?t left India until she was 45 ? she?s 67 ? that?s quite a revelation. ?I?m often mistaken for a Mexican (in a sari?),? she has said. Back home, writer Anurag Mathur, is oozing love for his country. In his latest book, The Department of Denials, he has written about a college boy who sets out to fulfil his dream of becoming India?s Prime Minister. Now, that?s what we call patriotism.

 Mark Knopfler 

Die-hard rock fans rejoice. Come March 2005, and Dire 

Straits? Mark Knopfler is coming to strum for us, right here in India. Considering 

we all thought he?ll never ever be able to play at all after his accident, leave 

alone touch Indian shores, let?s all say ?(Not) so far away?.

 DIARY

 Laloo Prasad Yadav is a great one for family planning, never mind all the shindy the intellectual-types kick up about his nine children. The adroitness with which he kept the Bihar chief minister?s chair in the family was truly commendable. Now he has plans to induct his daughter, Misa, in the family business. It is only natural that the girl, whose very name is a political statement (Laloo named her after the Maintenance of Internal Security Act under which he had been arrested at the time of her birth), should end up in politics. Misa is no stranger to the trappings of power, or the controversies that a too obvious enjoyment of them can lead to. She has managed to live down the ruckus over her residence in the capital?s Bihar Niwas, the one over her lavish wedding and earlier, her topping the Bihar medical examinations. Misa is now expected to play a crucial role in distributing tickets for the 2005 assembly elections. RJD insiders even speculate that post-elections, Misa would look after the state, while her father would concentrate on Delhi. Already, partymen are flocking around her in droves, so much so that her mother has begun feeling left out. Too bad she may have to make way for her daughter just when she was starting to enjoy the job. 

 Who?s the better actor ? Amitabh Bachchan or Shah Rukh Khan? The question seems to animate all fans of Bollywood films, from the street-side paanwallah to even Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi and their friends among the rich and famous of New Delhi. But it?s one thing to debate it out in a private conversation and quite another to have the question stage-whispered in the presence of Shah Rukh Khan himself at a private show of his recent film, Veer Zara. It must have been quite embarrassing for the King Khan, all the more so because an awkward silence followed the question and no one jumped to attest to his histrionic abilities. Even the fact that he was a Delhi boy did not sway them. A wisecrack made things even worse by saying that if speech was silver, then silence must be golden. It fell to the ever gracious and tactful Priyanka to redeem the situation by turning to Rajiv Shukla with, ?Where?s Priety? I thought she was fabulous in the movie.? 

 Bandh-disgusted Calcuttans may feel otherwise, but our didi is not as hard-hearted as she seems. Braving steep stairs despite her doctor?s warnings and her allegedly broken ribcage, she met the much-harassed speaker of the assembly, Hasim Abdul Halim, at his Kyd Street residence to express her condolences at the recent demise of his daughter. None had been aware of her plans, neither her own partymen nor her opponents, many of whom were yet to share Halim?s grief. But keen observers of the Bengal scene would remember that Mamata has shown the same alacrity before, when Jyoti Basu?s wife had died and she was among the first few to land up at the crematorium. A question. Would she be just as gallant to partake of her opponents? joy as she does of their sorrows? What if Anil Biswas?s daughter were to get married and didi was (let?s suppose) invited to the do by the proud parents? 

 The 20th anniversary of the Bhopal gas disaster was a sad occasion, but for some, it was time to make a fast buck. Hoteliers, taxi operators and private airliners cashed in on the presence of large numbers of representatives from European and American television channels, news agencies and newspapers. It also provided local journalists with the chance to make some extra money since all the foreign mediamen needed ?interpreters? who were paid anywhere between $100 to Rs 1,000 a day. The duties ? everything from ferreting out ?human interest? stories and introducing them to gas victims, to guiding them around the city, taking them sight-seeing, dining and shopping. It must have worked out well, because no one was heard complaining. 

 It isn?t just the professional politicians who run afoul of the law. Bimal Jalan and K Kasturirangan, two men who reached the very acme of their professions, have a case pending against them before the parliamentary joint committee on Offices of Profit. The allegation is that since both are members of the space commission, for which they get paid, they are ineligible to be Rajya Sabha MPs. The committee was to have taken a final view on the matter sometime in October, but its meeting was postponed to November 19 and then again to December. In the meantime, Laloo Yadav, M. Taslimuddin and party roam free.

 In Calcutta Clubland, there are different ways of preserving heritage. The RCGC, 175 years old last week, decided to look back to its heritage by planning for the future. It had 17 captains of ?Royals? across the world to celebrate the event. 

 But another club, more than 25 years older than the RCGC and with perhaps one of the most beautiful cricket fields any club in the world can boast of, decided to preserve (sic) its heritage in a bizarre way. It decided to turn a part of the ground into a parking lot for cars belonging to guests attending a wedding across the road. The going price was probably the proverbial 30 pieces of silver. A former Cambridge blue is a past president of the said club and it is not known how he felt when cars trampled on the green on which he once played his elegant drives. 

 But the Diary is certain that R.B. Lagden and T.C. Longfield groaned in their graves.

 POLITICS IN FANTASY

 Strange creatures

Iron Council

By China Mi eacute;ville, 

Macmillan, pound; 17.99

With Iron Council, China Mi?ville returns to 

the fantasy world of his earlier novel, Perdido Street Station, that won 

the Arthur C. Clark award. However, with a fresh set of characters, the novel 

works as a special treat for those who have been waiting for another look into 

the world created by Mi?ville. 

 The city-state of New Corbuzon has been at war with the Tesh for years. A stern militia controls the city. No one has the right to protest. The freedom of the press is restricted, and only what the militia deems fit to be made known gets known. However, in spite of the control, the government is unable to keep the news of its waning power from the people. One is reminded of John Steinbeck?s The Pearl, where the city is like an animal, with nerves and veins, and information has its own way of travelling despite a dominant controlling force.

 The novel has three narrative threads ? two in the present and one in the past ? woven together by the character of Judah Lowe. The narrative of the past deals with the formation of the Iron Council under the dynamic leadership of Ann-Hari. This legendary council consisted of rebels who were at one time whores, slaves and misfits, and their agenda was to overthrow the dictatorship of the Teshs. It is this myth of the Iron Council that has kept alive the citizens of New Corbuzon in the face of extreme atrocities. The novel opens in the present, where we find Cutter running through Rudewood in order to escape his assassin. His mission is his quest for Judah, who was one of the councillors. Along with Cutter?s story runs the parallel narrative of Uri, who is contemplating a terrorist attack on New Corbuzon.

 Like most science fiction, Mi?ville?s novel may also be read as a political allegory. The motif of the train in the novel maybe seen as Lenin?s famous train journey back to Russia. Mi?ville?s novel may also be read as a Romantic quest for the ?ideal?. Stretched even further on those lines, it may work as symbolic of the search for the Holy Grail. It is the fantastic mode of narration that throws up so many possible interpretations. 

 What is most intriguing about the novel is that one can hardly judge who is right and who is wrong and whether such categorical positions can at all be taken. The break-down of binary categories is one of the most explicit tropes of the book. The book dwells upon discovering non-stereotypes for the usual rhetoric ? it examines the thin line between crime and justice, it engages with bases for the moral grounding of ideologies. One of Mi?ville?s characters says, ?History is all full. And dripping. With the corpses. Of them who trusted the incorruptible.?

 Mi?ville is extremely innovative. He not only plays with concepts but also with words. Just as he creates creatures like the ?ragged and variegated? ?fReemades? ? ?Men and women with tusks or metal limbs, with tails, with gutta-percha intestines dangling oil-black in the cave of bloodless open bellies?, he comes up with words like ?shucking?, ?hotchi?, ?striae?, ?pavonine? and so on. 

 The word games are interesting, but Mi?ville?s obsession with it can put off the reader. His sentence construction is powerful but the excessive emphasis on style tends to divert the reader?s attention from the story. It even slows down the reading speed. However, once accustomed to his style, the reader remains spellbound till the end.

 If one wants to get a taste of politics in the world of fantasy, then Iron Council is the book to read.

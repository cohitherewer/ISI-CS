 DIARY

 A little smartness can take you places, but too much of it leads straight to trouble, someone should tell Jairam Ramesh. The Congress MP was at P. Chidambaram?s power lunch with Marxist ideologues Prakash Karat and Sitaram Yechury last Wednesday. Lunch and pow-wow over, Jairam felt it was time for some levity. Turning to Karat and Yechury, he said, ?So where is your...that Ambani or Abani or Advani or whatever?? The RSP leader, Abani Roy, at whose expense the joke was cracked, was not amused when he heard of it. ?These Ram-Rams are going to destroy the parties they belong to.? Roy was referring to the three Rams in Indian politics ? the BJP?s Sri Ram, the CPI(M)?s Sitaram and the Congress?s Jairam. And he does have a point. It has taken all the charm, diplomacy and adroit manoeuvring that Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh can together command to keep the left happy. The last thing they need are Ramesh?s wisecracks to rock the boat. But is Jairam listening?

 Babulal Gaur is such a pleasant surprise. In the short time he has been chief minister, he has shown that not only is he no (wo)man?s puppet but that he also has a mind of his own. The last is best reflected in his admiration for Digvijay Singh, the man his predecessor and ?mentor?, Uma Bharti, loved to hate. Not merely is he good friends with Diggy raja, but Gaur quite looks up to the latter as his role model and frequently takes tips from him. Digvijay too seems to reciprocate the good vibes since he has been telling journalists that Gaur was a seasoned politician and doing very well. 

 An independent mind is, of course, a mixed blessing. Recently, Gaur angered many of the top leaders in the BJP, including LK Advani, when he called on the party?s b?te noire, Laloo Prasad Yadav. For Gaur, a Yadav, the visit was a perfectly natural expression of caste solidarity, cutting across party line. And as chief minister, he wanted the Union railways minister to sanction a few projects for MP. Laloo, too, it is reported, has agreed to oblige a fellow yadav. Anything for a jaat bhai, it seems.

 What is Sharad Pawar up to? The Maharashtra polls are knocking at the door, but Pawar is padding up for the BCCI elections. Then the googly ? the statement that he wouldn?t have become a minister if Sonia Gandhi were PM, just days after he had called on the latter seeking her support for his BCCI venture. He also told Sonia that his party would consider merger with the parent party and also that if the NCP-Congress alliance won the polls, he would ensure the CM was a Congressman. Sonia is only now realizing that Pawar was lining the bait so that she would prevail on the Scindias, Biswals and Amins heading state cricket bodies to support him. But now that she has got his spin, she is taking rear-guard action. She has gone back to a letter from Ranbir Singh Mahendra, BCCI vice-president, who has reminded her of the Nehru-Gandhis? ties with his family (he is the son of Congress heavyweight Bansilal) and requested her support to fulfil North Zone?s legitimate right to lead the cricket body. Tacit support in the Haryana assembly elections is thrown in for good measure. Over to you, Pawar.

 An MP and his house will not be parted. Ghulam Nabi Azad has learnt this the hard way. Ever since he became urban development minister, he has been trying to empty 28 Akbar Road, but Nikhil Kumar, Delhi police commissioner-turned politician has stayed put. The majestic bungalow in Lutyens?s Delhi had been ?Police House? before Kumar used his clout to get it transferred to Shyama Sinha, only a first-time MP. Azad first had it allotted to Charanjit Singh Atwal, deputy speaker of the Lok Sabha, but within a fortnight Atwal had turned in down saying he was not interested. Azad next tried to give it to someone else. But he too turned it down advising the minister to let Kumar remain. Azad then changed tack, insisting that the house be vacated before anyone moved in. The gambit worked and 28 Akbar Road has a new occupant ? K. Rahman Khan, the Rajya Sabha deputy chairman.

 Keep Mani away ? that?s the frantic SOS the Maharashtra Congress has sent Sonia Gandhi. Mani is to be guest of honour at a function organized by an oil PSU and they want Mani to call it off since they don?t want him to add any more fuel to the Savarkar row. But Sonia is in two minds ? she knows he has entire quotes and page numbers of the Jeevanlal Kapoor inquiry report on Savarkar set to memory, that he is just waiting to use. Now that would really set the cat among the pigeons.

 Indian Airlines employees are just too forward ? they are quite unaware of what is due to a former Union minister like the BJP?s BS Khanduri. During Sushma Swaraj?s recent Savarkar Yatra, when she took along with her an entire plane-load of party MPs as her cheering squad, Khanduri was seated in the business class along with all the other lesser mortals. No amount of insisting that protocol demanded that Khanduri be upgraded to executive class worked. Finally, at Chennai airport, the retired lieutenant general got hold of a senior official and for the next 10 minutes, tried to get him to ensure that Khanduri travelled executive class, at least on the return journey. After he had heard him out, the officer told him that he was helpless. But why, spluttered the angry ex-minister. ?That?s because I work for Jet Airways, not Indian Airlines.? Dumbfounded, Khanduri asked him why he hadn?t said so at first. ?Sir, you didn?t give me a chance,? came the pat reply.

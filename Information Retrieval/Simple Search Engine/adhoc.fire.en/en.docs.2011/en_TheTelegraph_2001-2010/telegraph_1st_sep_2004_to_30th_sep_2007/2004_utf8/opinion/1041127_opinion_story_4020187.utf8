 Search deeper

 Sir ? If a woman is attacked in West Bengal by a group of men, then it is likely that the police will search and interrogate her rather than the offenders. This is what seems to have happened to the athlete, Pinki Pramanik (?Pistol pops out of shooting-star athlete?s kit?, Nov 24). Some years ago, a basketball player was teased and beaten up while jogging in the Maidan. What ? if any ? punishment the attackers got is unknown. Of course, it is possible that Pramanik?s slate is not completely clean, but that deserves a separate investigation. The fact that she was harassed by a few men cannot be shoved away just because a firearm was found in her bag. Were the men who supposedly ?brought? her to the panchayat office searched as well?

 Yours faithfully,

 Admission denied

 Sir ? The latest stance of the government of West Bengal vis-?-vis the students admitted to medical colleges under the NRI quota is surprising to say the least (?Govt in fix on medical quota?, Nov 25). Non-NRI students have been getting admitted to the IITs in the NRI quota for a long time, so why this sudden hue and cry about the same thing happening in medical colleges? 

 Knowing some of the victimized students personally, I feel angry about the way they have been reduced to shuttlecocks in the game between the court and the state government. It seems that the government is trying to wash its hands of this issue, since its legal ground is not very strong. But what about the students? Will the government ensure that they are not denied an opportunity to study medicine? In order to take admission in the medical colleges, these students left their institutions before August 9, the date from which the classes in SSKM and Midnapore Medical College were supposed to start. They have few sympathizers among the people and the media, since their parents happened to be able to to pay Rs 9 lakh for their NRI-quota admission. But it is absurd that the students should suffer because of this. They left their previous colleges to get entry into government medical colleges, not into any private institute. The students paid the stipulated fees and got admission through a transparent procedure, which included entrance test and its result, counselling, re-counselling, and finally, admission. Will the government, the judiciary, or the Medical Council of India please do something so that the bright careers awaiting these students do not get snuffed out so early? 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? After some of the fasting MBBS students fell ill, the chief minister and the health minister of West Bengal rushed to demonstrate that the state government is supporting their cause. But why encourage an exchange-mentality in education, where against Rs 9 lakh, some not-so-deserving students are admitted to medical colleges? Why not introduce a scheme for interest-free loans to poor meritorious students? 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? The Supreme Court has ruled that only 15 per cent seats may be reserved under the NRI quota in the two medical colleges of the state, SSKM and Midnapore Medical College. The judgment, on the one hand, provided a ray of hope for rank-holders in the joint entrance examination, while on the other, it has left the career of the 74 students admitted under the NRI quota to these colleges in complete darkness. What is their fault? Is it that they believed the state government?s assurance of admission? The judgment has proved that law is blind. Instead of putting obstructions in the path of the 74 students who are facing the axe, the new NRI quota of 15 per cent of the total number of seats could be made effective from 2005.

 Yours faithfully,

Rajwesh Roy, Calcutta

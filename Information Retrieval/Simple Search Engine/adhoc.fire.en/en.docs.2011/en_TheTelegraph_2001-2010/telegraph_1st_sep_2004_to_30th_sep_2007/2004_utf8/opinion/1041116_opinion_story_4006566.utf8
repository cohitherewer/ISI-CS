 WICKEDLY FREE

 The spirit of the internet is essentially and wickedly free. This is why the sins of the globalized world ? organized paedophilia and terrorism ? take on their most elusive and hydra-headed forms in that medium. And policing the internet is devilishly difficult, if not altogether impossible. From imposture to plagiarism, everything becomes that much more difficult to pin down, prove and punish. The crux of the problem lies in the degree of play the cyberworld allows with that already slippery thing ? human identity. Real people can perform virtual acts on the net without leaving a trace of who they are, and this is the most frustrating aspect of trying to implement cyber-laws. The Karnataka government will soon be starting its own efforts to implement certain features of the Centre?s Information Technology Act 2000. Its target will be the state?s cyber caf?s, particularly in Bangalore. Owners will have to maintain a logbook with names and addresses of all users, who, in turn, will have to prove their identities with documents like the voter ID card or driving licence. If users cannot produce any such document, then the caf? owners will have to photograph them on webcams and store the images. The IT Act punishes certain cyber-crimes with a maximum fine of a crore, and owners who do not follow these instructions can be fined up to Rs 25,000 and have their licences cancelled.

 The whole thing looks doomed to failure even before it has begun to be put in action. Policing cyber caf?s has been attempted, to little avail, in Delhi, Chennai and Hyderabad. It is ironic, but understandable, that cities like Bangalore and Hyderabad, which have come to be identified with the infinite possibilities opened up by IT, should also be the places where cyber-insecurity would be most intense, and therefore particularly doomed. Inevitably, the ordinary user will experience such laws as a thoroughly annoying violation of privacy, while the sheer volume of users will make it maddening for the caf?-owners to keep such detailed track of their customers. Countries that have not entirely managed to outgrow their totalitarian habits of governance ? China, for instance ? are battling on with the internet. India, though often given to censorship, has a much better democratic record. It will have to learn to be sensible about how people choose to exercise their freedom with the internet.

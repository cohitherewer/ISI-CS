 KEEPING GOOD COMPANY

Pratapaditya Pal?s PAINTED POEMS (Norton Simon 

Museum and Mapin, Rs 1,750) originally accompanied an exhibition of the compiled 

Rajput paintings donated to the Norton Simon Museum by the distinguished collectors, 

Ramesh and Urmil Kapoor. Pal gives an exhaustive account of this genre of art, 

how political patronage, as much as the religious texts, provided inspiration 

to the painters. He also makes a crucial observation, ?Fewer paintings depict 

the activities of women.? Yet the predominance of the feminine in the Pahari paintings 

belies this. Pal suggests that this could be ?just figments of imagination?. But 

the exquisite depictions of Radha (here in ? The hour of cowdust?, illustrating 

a theme from the Bhagavatapurana) or her sakhis, or courtly women, 

could not have emanated simply from fancy.

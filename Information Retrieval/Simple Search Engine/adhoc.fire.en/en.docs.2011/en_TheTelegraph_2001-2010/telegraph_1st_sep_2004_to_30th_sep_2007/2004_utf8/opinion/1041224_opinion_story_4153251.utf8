 Letters to Editor

 A different ball game

 Sir ? The Indian cricket coach, John Wright, has tried to underplay the reporting of Harbhajan Singh?s bowling action by saying that it is a ?routine? affair (?Bhajji reporting routine: Wright?, Dec 22). But can one really absolve the International Cricket Council of mischief in this incident? Isn?t it strange that five of the six bowlers who have been reported for suspect action lately hail from the subcontinent and not from other fairer parts of the world? If Harbhajan?s action is still not right, why did the ICC clear the Turbanator after his stint with Fred Titmus? One suspects that poor Harbhajan has been made to pay for the bad blood between Jagmohan Dalmiya and the ICC. But he need not worry too much. Saving the skins of Indian players comes easily to Dalmiya. Remember how dada came clean in the Clive Lloyd fiasco recently?

 Yours faithfully,

Akash Sinha, Calcutta 

 Doctored admissions

 Sir ? It is a pity that the 69 MBBS students who had been admitted under the NRI quota find themselves in a mess for no fault of theirs (?SC blow to Bengal medical quota bloc?, Dec 14). The authorities should not have admitted them without weighing the consequences of their decision to sideline the Supreme Court?s decree on the issue. Why should there be an NRI quota at all? Is it too much to expect that only meritorious students ? instead of those who can get in by paying hefty fees ? be granted admission into medical colleges? If this is not compromising on the quality of future doctors, then what is? Besides, one can hardly expect the quota students, who pay a fortune to get through the course, to practise in remote areas. In sum, admitting students to engineering and medical colleges in return for hefty fees can only have disastrous consequences. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? The plight of the dismissed medical students of the SSKM and Midnapore Medical College and Hospital makes one wonder at the apathy of the state government. The students had vested their faith in the government and opted out of engineering at Jadavpur University, physics and statistics at St Xaviers? College or microbiology at Bidhannagar College. (But why is the media making a fuss about the students? ?merit??)

 As a student of their batch, I have seen how they had to wait for a year before the Medical Council of India assented to their admission. The sad part is that the government didn?t think twice before flouting the laws and collecting the money from the students. This is what has led to the mess, despite the fact that the admissions were done openly, money was exchanged transparently and the admission notices were also put up for all to see. Getting admission under the NRI quota was not wrong, especially as the provision was made available to all those who could afford it. 

 While it is true that the students who cleared the joint entrance exam should not have been made the scapegoat, it is also true that the careers of the 69 students have been jeopardized unnecessarily. And the state government is responsible for it. The government appears to have been in too much of a hurry to collect money from the students to bail itself out of the financial mess it is in. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sayan Ghosh, Calcutta

 Sir ? Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s plans to accommodate the 69 ousted students in a new medicine faculty is risible. It is obvious now that the NRI-quota students were not as good as those who got in by clearing the JEE. The state government?s sudden rush to open a new faculty of medicine gives the impression that it thinks setting up a medical college is like starting a new business. Healthcare standards in West Bengal continue to be abysmal although most doctors are trained at bona fide medical colleges. One can imagine what the makeshift medical colleges will churn out. It is ironical that people from Bengal have to travel to other states for reliable treatment even as empty political promises like these are made. The authorities also continue to take no worthwhile action over the reports of medical lapses recurring day after day. In these circumstances, it amuses one to see the chief minister?s concern for the NRI students. It just goes to prove how money has become all-important for the communists in West Bengal. 

 Yours faithfully, 

Kunal Saha, Ohio, US

 Sir ? The 69 NRI students had almost completed the first semester of the course. In all probability, the case will be settled after some time. There was a similar case in Karnataka last year, and my son was among those affected. But the state government stepped in and made arrangements so that the students did not lose out on a year. In comparison, the Bengal government seems hopelessly incompetent. The present fiasco is a reminder of the need for a uniform admission policy for engineering and medical colleges. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sudarsan Nandi, Midnapore

 Sir ? There are consumer courts to seek redressal in when a company plays it unfair. But how does one hold the government accountable for its dubious dealings? 

 Yours faithfully,

Tapan Pal, Batanagar

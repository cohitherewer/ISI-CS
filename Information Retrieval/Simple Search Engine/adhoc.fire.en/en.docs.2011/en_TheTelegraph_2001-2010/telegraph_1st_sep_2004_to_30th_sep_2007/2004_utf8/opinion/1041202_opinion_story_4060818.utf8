 Letters to Editor

 An early start

 Sir ? It is nobody?s case that incidents like the one that rocked Delhi Public School, R.K. Puram, are confined to high-profile metropolitan schools only (?Fooling around?, Nov 28). However, unlike most sexually active teenagers in India, the two students in question did not have their better judgment clouded by raging hormones. The fact that their activity was being filmed by the boy proves beyond doubt that this sexual escapade was premeditated. There was no passion involved, all the incitements of the boy were calculated to sell ? and this is what makes the incident so distressing. The preventive steps taken by the school now are akin to treating the symptoms rather than the disease. Someone needs to explain to these children that sex is not all about fornication, that there is more to sex than mere intercourse. Teachers and parents need to make them understand that even their bodies deserve respect, and that they should channelize their energies better. 

 Yours faithfully, 

Aniket Aga, Kharagpur

 Sir ? The editorial, ?Fooling around? (Nov 29), ends with the question: ?who must learn their lessons first, the school authorities or the parents?? True, no school can dream of allowing sex on its premises. But we should also accept that breaking rules is a part of growing up. It is also true that parents often give in to the whims and fancies of their wards, and provide whatever the children demand without judging its necessity. This is clear from the fact that the two students of DPS possessed MMS enabled phones. Many parents want to show off their status through their children. This has led to the sorry state of affairs. 

 Yours faithfully,

Raza Kamal, Gaya

 Sir ? Much of the furore over the Delhi school incident is a knee-jerk reaction. And the media is going overboard in making a villain out of the cell phone, to protect the errant students, and more importantly their parents for failing to instil values and discretion in their children. Having consensual sex with a classmate is not a crime, nor is it a new phenomenon. Adolescent students were no angels before cell phones were invented. 

 As a parent, I understand the anxiety and obsession of parents to remain in touch with their wards. Banning cell phones from schools will hardly be prudent. It will not eradicate deviant sexual behaviour like exhibitionism or voyeurism. 

 The responsibility of making children beings with proper moral, ethical and humanitarian values, lies with the parents. 

 Yours faithfully, 

Tapan Pal, Batanagar

 Sir ? The front-page story, ?Scandal in school shakes up Delhi? (Nov 27) assures me that not much has changed in the attitude towards sex among senior school students in Delhi since I was one in the late Fifties and early Sixties. There were no cell phones, MMS or otherwise in our time, but young folks with active hormones did exactly what they felt was right. What is new, as the report suggests, is the reaction of the sex-on-their-minds adults ? the school authorities ? who made much noise about the incident. Didn?t the report mention that sex is not a new phenomenon in the posh Delhi schools? Why are the authorities pretending to be so shocked? 

 Yours faithfully, 

Shyamal Bagchee, Edmonton, Canada

 Sir ? No one seems interested in acknowledging the fact that sexual mores have changed and schoolchildren do have sex with each other. Surely, nobody thinks any longer that sex is something that Indians indulge in only after marriage. Sex education must be introduced early in schools, and access to, and knowledge about, contraceptives must be made easy. This will help tackle teenage sexual problems and also the awe with which inquisitive children treat sex. 

 Yours faithfully, 

Biswapriya Purkayastha, Shillong 

 Sir ? The government, while still being queasy about sex education in schools, has initiated workshops and awareness campaigns about safe sex with an intention to check the spread of AIDS. But to assume that merely shoving information down a student?s throat will make him careful and disciplined is being impractical. 

 Yours faithfully, 

Salil Gewali, Shillong

 n Sir ? What?s wrong with spiked hair and mobile phones? Some people need to grow up! Why does every self-declared elitist have to comment about the Delhi school incident? Leave the two kids alone. Leave us kids alone. Agreed, it was stupid of the boy to shoot the whole affair and then send it around. But what came to light in that MMS shouldn?t be surprising. It?s called evolution. When the apes mutated into humans, there must have been a few voices raised against the way this new being thought and walked. But everything finally fits into the groove perfectly. Teachers, it?s useless trying to stop all this. The only thing you can hope for is that the kids who do it the next time don?t spoil their life by getting the unwanted attention which these two poor souls are getting. 

 You can?t take away cell phones. And certainly none of you can do anything about the fact that incidents like this will happen every now and then. I just hope that the next time, there are no cameras around. After all, kids are not sent to school to become porn stars. Remember, the forbidden fruit was tastier than any other stuff in the garden of Eden ? and this place isn?t even that. This is not a Hollywood flick where one Morgan Freeman can inspire schoolchildren to give up all their vices. It?s the real world. Face it. Call it Californication or degradation of moral health among the youth or the effect of technology, but it?s happening and its unstoppable. 

 Yours faithfully,

Aneesh Jain, Roorkee

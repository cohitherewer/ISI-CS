 BITTER MEDICINE

 Economic development helps the people, but it does little to cure political extremists of their infantile disorders. The Maoist violence in Midnapore once again proves the point. The rebels, presumably belonging to the Communist Party of India (Maoist), struck this time to forcibly stop a development project that was to meet a long-standing demand of the poor people of the area. They attacked the contractors? labourers, working on the construction of a road passing through a forest, as well as members of the village panchayat who supervised the work. It is only a coincidence that the panchayat members belonged to the Communist Party of India (Marxist), whose rule and reformist agenda have always been anathema to the Maoists? goal of a communist revolution. A more crucial point is that the Maoists would have nothing of the development work in the area because they want to use its poverty as grist to their mill. They were clearly suspicious of the people?s involvement in the project. Economic benefits that would come with the construction of a road through forest hamlets could militate against their politics of violence. Yet, the Maoists themselves sought to exploit the lack of development in areas such as Midnapore, Bankura and Purulia in order to lure the poor into their fold. Little wonder that they see development as a threat to their cynical designs.

 However, earlier Maoist depredations in Midnapore and adjoining districts may have served a purpose. There is no denying that the Marxists? 27 years in power in West Bengal have done little to lift the people in some of these areas from their abject poverty. A cruel testimony of this came in recent reports of starvation deaths at Amlasol village, which, unsurprisingly, is next door to the forest where the Maoists struck. The rebel activities in the area stirred a lethargic government into some serious work to reduce the area?s poverty. The administration must not give up or delay the development projects that the people there urgently need. For, that would be playing into the rebels? hands. At the same time, the state government needs to assure the people that it is capable of ensuring their safety. The rebels are known to be using the forested border between West Bengal and Jharkhand, where law-enforcing agencies are not very active. The two states have a common stake in tackling the Maoist menace. It is time they worked out a common strategy too.

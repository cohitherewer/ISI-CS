 Paperback Pickings

 But hey, she?s from Jersey

Passion (Review, ?5.75) by Jude Morganis 

about the younger Romantic poets, but seen through the eyes and imaginations of 

the women who loved them, and survived them. Byron, Shelley and Keats, and Mary 

Shelley, Lady Caroline Lamb, Augusta Leigh and Fanny Brawne. This is an elaborately 

imagined book, and could have been shorter, and given to some of the sentimental 

excesses of the historical romance. It is close in spirit and texture to Ken Russell?s 

film, Gothic ? about the Byron-Shelley-Mary m?nage, out of which 

emerged Frankenstein. ?Augusta: it had been her lifelong habit never to 

throw anything away in case it came in useful.?

To the Nines (Headline, ?6.99) by Janet 

Evanovich is about the wild Ms Stephanie Plum from Jersey, bounty hunter, 

expert at turning situations her way and at always getting her man. Her cousin 

Vinnie has posted bail on Samuel Singh, who mysteriously disappears just as his 

work visa is running out. And Steph is on the case to ensure the elusive Mr Singh 

doesn?t make his disappearance more permanent. But what she uncovers is far more 

sinister. ?My name is Stephanie Plum and I was born and raised in the Chambersburg 

section of Trenton, where the top male activities are scarfing pastries and growing 

love handles. The pastry and pork rind I?ve seen first-hand. The love handles 

grow over time. Thank God for small favours.?

How I taught my grandmother to read and other stories 

(Puffin, Rs 150) by Sudha Murty recounts real-life experiences 

from a childhood spent in a village in Karnataka, without TVs, music systems or 

VCDs at home. There were only grandparents bringing alive the Kathasaritsagara, 

Arabian Nights, Panchatantra, Aesop, Birbal and Tenali Rama. In 

that ancient spirit of storytelling Murty narrates the tales which teach valuable 

lessons about the importance of what you believe is right and of having the courage 

to realize your dreams. Murty is a teacher, social worker and best-selling writer. 

She is given to instructing and informing in most of these stories with a barely 

disguised zeal that is ultimately inimical to the amoral delights of most of her 

ancient exemplars.

Beyond Indigo (HarperCollins, Rs 295) by 

Preethi Nair tells the story of Nina, a woman of Indian origin living in 

London. Nina?s passion is painting, but she is troubled by her parents? desire 

to marry her to an eligible Indian expat, an unfaithful fianc? and the void created 

by the death of her best friend, Ki. And then she leaves her job with a law firm, 

where her responsibilities included offering words of consolation to a painter 

turned away by the Turner Prize. But she keeps up the pretence of going to work 

and escapes to a studio, and paints furiously. What happens after this involves 

disguise, deceit, heartbreak, elation ? almost all the emotions in the human repertoire. 

The plot is ideal for an Indo-British film of the kind that is gaining popularity 

these days. But must all immigrants speak an English free of articles?

A little night music(Rupa, Rs 150) by 

Ruskin Bond is a collection of poems from the much-loved writer of children?s 

stories. The poems are full of childhood associations and little morals. There 

is even a poem on the babus, which goes ?Soak the rich and harry the poor/ 

That?s our motto and our law;/ We are the rulers of this land,/ We are the babus, 

a merry band...?. Perhaps not meant entirely for children.

 FIGHTING FOR ATTENTION

Peace Studies: An Introduction to the Concept, Scope 

and Themes

Edited by Ranabir Samaddar, Sage, Rs 750

Peace studies emerged as a n academic discipline first 

in the US, probably to justify Washington?s interventionist policy in underdeveloped 

states. Scandinavia also developed its own focus on peace studies. While the American 

approach mostly looked into pacification drives, especially the distribution of 

financial aid, the Scandinavian one turned attention to second and third track 

diplomatic initiatives. 

 The story is different for multi-ethnic India, whose internal troubles heighten its external security dilemma. The Indian power elite has been more concerned about keeping peace within the country than keeping peace with neighbours. Hence, peace studies in India have followed a track different from the two approaches mentioned. The essays here offer a glimpse of the discipline as it emerged in India.

 Military theoreticians now believe that war and peace represent a continuum. But there are grey areas that include low-intensity and counter-insurgency operations or limited wars. The essayists in this book explore this grey region.

 Samir Das asserts that peace is not a passive concept since one has to fight for establishing and maintaining peace. He stresses on keeping peace at the local level through dialogue instead of depending too much on the state bureaucracy. Ranabir Samaddar rightly challenges the assumption that true democracies emerged in the West and that democratic governments by nature are peaceful.

 Paula Banerjee?s essay on the India-China border problem is an empirically-dense diplomatic history, now unfairly considered as old-fashioned in India. Kanti Bajpai?s essay on India?s nuclear programme falls within the ambit of security studies. 

 Security studies and peace studies are actually two sides of the same coin. While the former over-emphasize the role of the state, the latter tend to ignore the existence of the state. Now security studies are trying to incorporate issues of human security, food security, water problems into the question of military security. Similarly, the peace analysts need to engage with the state in a more positive manner. 

 Several essays in this volume point to the problem of migration from Bangladesh. They argue for sympathetic treatment of the migrants. But no one is willing to hit the nail of the head ? that this unwanted migration is one of the principal factors behind insurgencies in the North-east. This volume nevertheless remains an essential read for those interested in contemporary politics.

 Something spooky happens when you log on to www.factoryatwork.com. A red stamp with ?The Factory? written on it jumps to the left-hand corner of an ominous black rectangle. You realise you are watching a promo for Vaastu Shastra when a blinking red box says that you move at your own risk. And then, suddenly, your mouse starts behaving eerily. You do your best to click onto a navigational link, but the cursor moves on its own to another corner of the screen. And that goes on and on. Spooky promotion of a spookfest is fine, but after several minutes of futilely trying to open the site, you ask yourself, ?Just what?s the point??

 Indian audiences are asking the same question out there in multiplexes after watching the newest product from Ram Gopal Varma?s production company, The Factory. Critics have panned it, for Vaastu Shastra ? a so-called horror film starring Sushmita Sen ? is just about as scary as Casper, the friendly ghost. Ram Gopal Varma, hailed just the other day as the director of all seasons, has produced yet another unwatchable film.

 The film may have earned praise for technical excellence, but it has left audiences wondering just why they have been subjected to bizarre camera angles, weird sound effects and flour-faced zombies. The promos may well disclaim all responsibility, but as far as the viewer is concerned, the much-hyped producer has no one to blame but himself for the consequences of a horror film that fails to horrify.

 Clearly, the consequences don?t seem too good for 43-year-old Varma, who set up The Factory with much fanfare. The media loved him, describing him as India?s own Cecil DeMille and David Selznik. To his credit, this former video library-owner from Hyderabad has truly brought about the much talked-about corporatisation of Bollywood, for he churns out four to five meticulously mounted films every year.

 But the last few films indicate that Varma is losing his touch. Vaastu Shastra, directed by Sourabh Usha Narang, is the fourth film in 2004 from Varma?s ?fearsomely fecund film factory? ? to quote an alliteration-loving film critic. The others to hit the marquee included Ek Hasina Thi, Ab Tak Chhappan and Gayab. Barring Ab Tak Chhappan which dealt with Varma?s fetish for Mumbai?s crime underbelly, the rest turned out to be minnows of the multiplexes.

 Varma?s last universally successful film was the Manoj Bajpai-starrer Satya (1998), a realistic portrayal of the Mumbai underworld. Even with Satya, Varma couldn?t reach the level of box-office success that his 1995 film, Rangeela, touched. Varma, who first made his mark as a Telugu filmmaker before joining Bollywood, made some decent money in urban centres with Jungle (2000), Company (2002) and Bhoot (2003). But lately, he has been flooding Indian theatres with small-budget films made by his assistants: Prawaal Raman, Chandan Arora, Rajat Mukherjee, Shriram Raghavan and Narang.

 His team broke Bollywood stereotypes. They experimented with new plots and ideas, prompting Varma to liken talented newcomers to Al-Qaeda guerrillas holed up in Tora Bora ? taking on the big banners of Bollywood.

 But, the promise these films showed fizzled out in the narrative and they eventually turned out to be turkeys at the box office. Now with Vaastu Shastra going the same way, analysts have begun to wonder if the film ? which promised to be ?the scariest film ever? ? would spell horror for Varma himself.

 ?In his fetish for delivering one film after the other, I fear some of his distributors may not be happy,? says Komal Nahta, editor of the trade magazine, Film Information. ?I fear that he?s too taken in by quantity than quality.?

 Trade pundits argue that the last link in Bollywood?s chain of filmmaking is the distributor, and distributors losing money spells trouble for even established film-makers. But Varma, clearly, understands the business. In February this year, he inked a unique deal with Subrato Roy?s Sahara Group to make 10 films over two years for Rs 75 crore.

 That was a first, just as Varma?s foray into horror was another much talked-of experiment. His love affair with the genre of suspense-horror dates back to 1992 when he made Raat, one of the early Hindi films to use a steadycam (where the camera is strapped to a body to give the effect of movement). Bhoot and Darna Mana Hain creditably tried to take the horror genre away from the standard Ramsay movies of plaster-of-Paris ghosts. A sequel to Darna Mana Hain, cheekily titled Darna Zaroori Hain, is already in the making.

 Still, going by the way the audiences are reacting to Vaastu Shastra, Varma?s horror-film days may well be numbered. After all, those wanting to get spooked out don?t really need to watch Vaastu Shastra. All they need to do is log onto his Website.

 A DOT IN THE TINKLING VOID

SEEKER: THE ART OF SOHAN QADRI (Mapin, Rs 1,500) 

collects the paintings ? 83 in colour and 26 in black and white ? of this Sufi-Buddhist-vajrayan-Tantric 

artist, born in the Punjab and currently resident in Denmark. Most of the paintings 

look like fashionably abstract pieces created, possibly in an epiphanic state, 

for drawing rooms belonging to mystically inclined Californians. There is a great 

deal of genital symbolism, and a profusion of wheels and dots and eggs and seeds. 

?I am a dot in the seed of the sea ? the seed of the seeds,? Qadri has written 

about himself. His volume of poems is called Dot and the Dots. This is 

an early work (1961) entitled Sea Face Sketch. Later works have titles 

like Sansara, Dissolution, Churning and Tinkling Void.

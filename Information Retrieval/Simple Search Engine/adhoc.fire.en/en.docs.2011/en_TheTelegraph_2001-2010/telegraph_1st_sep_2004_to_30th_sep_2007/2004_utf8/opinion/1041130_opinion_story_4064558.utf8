 VALID CLAIMS

 Justice delayed is not always justice denied. By inviting Mr Shibu Soren back into the Union cabinet, the prime minister, Mr Manmohan Singh, has rectified an injustice that had been done to Mr Soren when he was asked to resign from the cabinet. It is important to remember that in the eyes of the law, Mr Soren is innocent since the law courts have still not found him guilty. Till the allegations against him are upheld by a court of law, the holier-than-thou attitude that says that Mr Soren should not be a minister is nothing more than a bit of moral posturing. The charges against Mr Soren are somewhat bizarre. For one thing, they go back to a ?crime? he is supposed to have committed 30 years ago, and his case has been pending since that time. The government of the Bharatiya Janata Party, for political reasons, found it convenient to revive the case to embarrass Mr Soren and his ally, the Congress. Apart from the time factor, the specific content of the charge is also very odd. It is held that he incited a mob, during a campaign to ?drive away outsiders?, and this resulted in the death of 10 persons. The connection between Mr Soren?s alleged incitement and the killing is tenuous, to say the least.

 It is entirely possible, of course, that the reasons behind Mr Soren?s recall to the Union cabinet was not determined by such laudable notions like correcting a previous wrong. Assembly elections in Jharkhand are a few months away and Mr Soren?s party, the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha, can prove to be a formidable ally for the Congress. Mr Soren too has been playing his political cards with a certain degree of astuteness. His sudden courtship with the Nationalist Congress Party could only have sent alarm signals to the Congress. It is somewhat quixotic to believe that because Mr Singh is an upright man, he will not be conscious of his political compulsions. Mr Singh is a conscious political actor, he cannot be expected to behave in a manner befitting the head of a righteous monastic order. Mr Singh has acted within the framework of law by treating Mr Soren to be innocent since he is yet to be proven guilty. There exist no valid grounds for excluding Mr Soren from ministerial responsibility. His claims for inclusion are as valid as those of any other politician in the country. Neither Mr Singh nor Mr Soren need feel hangdog by the situation.

 DIARY

 Laloo Prasad Yadav?s GK may not be as bad as George Bush?s, but it?s only marginally better. The Union railways minister was recently in Bhopal, campaigning for the Congress party in the civic elections. Most of his meetings were held in the narrow by-lanes of the old city, and to the largely Muslim crowds that assembled at the street-corners to listen to him, Laloo couldn?t stop saying how very upset he was at the passing away of Nasir, whose funeral he had attended in Cairo. Now who could this mysterious ?Nasir? be? Gemal Abdel Naser? But that Naser had died decades ago, and the chances of Laloo attending Naser?s funeral were surely quite remote? The puzzle was finally solved when an RJD office-bearer remembered that Laloo had been to Cairo recently to attend the funeral of Yasser Arafat. Yasser or Nasir ? a simple slip of the tongue, isn?t it? Our minister was lucky that, unlike Bush, there were no television cameras to catch his gaffe. 

 J. Jayalalithaa might give the impression that she is an iron woman, the larger-than-life puratchi thalaivi whom no one dare cross, but she is only a woman. And a lonely one who best loves the company of her own sex. Recognizing this, the Congress plans to get amma a few friends within its ranks. Jayanthi Natarajan, it is said, will be the next PCC chief, and Margaret Alva, the party G-sec in charge of Tamil Nadu. Needless to say, it is only another woman, Sonia Gandhi, who could be so solicitous to another woman. 

 A woman?s touch may work with Jayalalithaa, but Sonia Gandhi has found that her own home constituency is a different kettle of fish. On a recent visit to Rae Bareilly, she was stumped at the strange demand of Mohammed Saleem from Keloli village ? a truckload of bricks. Speechless at first, Sonia said she would consider it. But Saleem wasn?t mollified ? he was tired of ?empty promises?, his sister was getting married, he was running out of money and if he didn?t have the bricks he would soon be without a roof over his head. The litany of griefs was so overpowering that the Congress president turned to her local pointsman, Sunil Kumar Agnihotri, and asked him to do the needful. By evening a truckload of bricks was making its way to Saleem?s house. The straight approach works best, doesn?t it? 

 You can?t fool all the people all the time, Abe Lincoln had said. But you can always try, M Venkaiah Naidu would say. The former BJP president had resigned and paved the way for LK Advani, citing his wife?s poor health. So what is Naidu doing in the capital, attending meetings on Bihar, Jharkhand and what have you? When asked, Naidu could only answer sheepishly, ?Do I have to answer everything?? The answer is in the question. 

 Unquiet flows the Damodar. A mini-Kurukshetra is apparently being staged over the anointment of the chairman of the DVC. Part-owner of the project, the leftist government of Bengal has a bureaucrat in mind for the post. Across the border, the government of Jharkhand, which is also part-owner, has a bureaucrat in mind too. But he is an active saffronwallah and an obvious bane for the jhandawallahs. PM Sayeed is naturally caught in a bind. But that?s not the whole story. The twist in the tale has been added by a Calcutta-based business house majoring in coal and paper (and allegedly nurtured with care by the left itself), which prefers the Jharkhandi choice, for its own business interests. The left naturally is seeing red. Let?s wait and see who is dammed.

 We all know that things have not been going too well for Uma Bharti in recent times. Now Bharti knows why. In Madmaheswar (Uttaranchal) to lick her wounds, Uma called on a seer to ask why the entire world had turned against her. The godman told her that it was all her fault. The sadhvi had failed the test that the gods had set up for her by succumbing to the temptations of the post of BJP gen-sec, thus interrupting the yog sadhana she had been engaged in at the time. Suitably chastised, Uma seems to have gone back to her religious practices ? until temptation knocks at her door again, probably. Or perhaps, she is hoping worldly goodies will follow her bout of asceticism. When she will abandon her sadhana to grab the opportunity. But won?t the gods be angry then? After all, who better than the saffron lady to know that the gods are a jealous lot?

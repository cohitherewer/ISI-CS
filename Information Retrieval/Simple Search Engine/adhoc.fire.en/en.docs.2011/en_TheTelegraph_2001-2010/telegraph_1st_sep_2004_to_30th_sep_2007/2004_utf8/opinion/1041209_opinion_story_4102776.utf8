 MOST FOUL

 Death is the last thing one associates with sport. At the heart of any sport is enjoyment, for the sportsman as well as for the spectators. Death on the playing field throws the shadow of tragedy not only because it takes away a life but also because it vitiates the entire atmosphere of enjoyment. The death of Cristiano de Lima Junior, while scoring a goal in the Federation Cup against Mohun Bagan, has raised a number of uncomfortable questions which have brought disrepute to the way in which soccer is played and administered in India. Thanks to the available television footage, certain things are quite obvious. The most important of these is the fact that when the Mohun Bagan goalkeeper, Subrata Pal, struck Junior on the chest, the ball was nowhere near Junior. Pal had played the man and not the ball. This is a familiar ploy in football, but competent referees invariably come down very heavily on players who engage in that kind of unfair play. But in Bangalore, the referee allowed Pal to go scot-free when the least punishment that his foul deserved was a red card. The referee and the linesmen ignored the infringement. There are reasons to suspect that this was not a genuine mistake on the part of officials who were running the game. Indian referees, over the years, have shown a pronounced disinclination to take a strict line against players belonging to big and powerful clubs like Mohun Bagan.

 It is entirely possible that Pal did not strike Junior with intent to harm, let alone kill. But strike he did. Moreover, his general behaviour through the course of the match was bizarre and thoroughly unbecoming of a sportsman. There was a clear case here for making Pal undergo a dope test. It is not unknown for footballers of today to be on drugs to enhance their capabilities. There are set rules that apply to players who fail the dope test. Pal was not even subjected to a test. It is also important to remember that Pal has a track record of bad and rough behaviour on the field. In the finals of the Durand Cup, he misbehaved with the referee and hit a player belonging to East Bengal. The assumption that Pal is completely innocent of any kind of infringement seems to be a completely misplaced one.

 It is evident that the circumstances of Junior?s death have not been properly investigated. The unseemly haste smells of a cover-up. The world body of soccer, Fifa, is justified in awaiting a full report on the incident including a final post mortem report. It is quite clear that a number of lapses have gone into the making of the incident. The most glaring of these are the lapses on the part of the referee. Indian football is nowhere near global standards. One reason for this is the fact that the strict rules that govern football the world over are absent in India.

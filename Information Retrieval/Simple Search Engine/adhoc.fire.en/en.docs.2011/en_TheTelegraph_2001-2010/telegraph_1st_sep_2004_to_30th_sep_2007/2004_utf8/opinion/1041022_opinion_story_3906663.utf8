 AN EXPAT LAUNCH BREAK

 Neha Sahay

 A new ?expat association? was formed a few weeks ago in one of south China?s coastal cities, soon after the long summer break ended. Its launch, the activities scheduled for the first three months, are all good enough indicators of the lifestyle of foreigners living in China ? and there are hordes of them. Most of them are American, but there?s a whole German block, an equally impressive French block, a small Swiss contingent and, of course, a rather large British presence. Guangzhou (Canton), the capital of south China?s Guangdong province, now has a new international airport, with direct flights to Paris and Frankfurt. So foreigners needn?t make the expensive journey by ferry to Hong Kong to catch their flights home ? yet another step by the mainland to reduce dependence on its newly-acquired territory. Sadly, Air India is out of all such moves, so Indians have no option but to travel to Hong Kong.

 Tickets for the five-star expat launch cost 150 yuan each. When emails to the expat list didn?t take care of all the tickets printed, volunteers spread out to stalk prospective customers inside an expensive Japanese supermarket and a five-star chain, both known haunts of white expats. The sales pitch was aggressive ? every non-Chinese was approached; the responses often equally so: ?I?ve never heard of any expat association and I don?t want to be part of it.?

 English, not Indians

 Nevertheless, the launch saw a surprisingly large turn-out; no one could have imagined there could be so many foreigners living in one of China?s smallest, most low-profile cities. Of course, the majority were white, for some of whom the launch provided an opportunity to expand their business. Opening lines ranged from ?Don?t you want to learn English?? to ?You must be looking for an apartment?, with business cards being handed over simultaneously.

 Teaching English is more than an expat pastime in China. With the craze for English among Chinese youth, every retired/jobless teacher in the West applies for a job to China and gets it. Not just teachers; you have grounded pilots from the US (post 9/11) and microbiologists from Canada offering English courses at universities. A potential goldmine here for Indians.

 Interestingly, despite having a large presence in one of the city?s most famous English-teaching institutes, Indians were conspicuous by their absence at the launch. One enterprising Goan however, had come all the way from Hong Kong, where he has been running a garment business for the last seven years.

 Not even for charity

 The menu at the launch was advertised in the invite, and wisely so. Food is a big issue with white expats. So the organizers made sure the food was absolutely upto the mark: French and German fare, French wine provided free from a French gourmet shop in Macao, desserts from the humble caramel custard to a French pastry platter. Nothing remotely Indian, though the only Indian restaurant in the city is a hit with whites, its bright orange butter chicken, naan and mango lassi as much in demand as its paan masala.

 But weekly ?coffee mornings? at a beach bar, not ?lassi mornings? at the Indian kitchen, will constitute the regular activity of the expat association for the first three months, interspersed with trips to nearby islands and pool tournaments, all of it ending with a grand ?pub-crawling nite?.

 This lotus-eater?s schedule costs 200 yuan a year. There is also talk of doing charity ? if the authorities permit it, of course. Foreigners are more than welcome to invest in China, in sectors still closed to them in India. But unlike in India, China?s poor aren?t open to foreign inspection, even for charity purposes.

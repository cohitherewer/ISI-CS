 SHARKS, RAYS AND CHIMERAS

 Excerpts from the World Conservation Union?s Red List of Threatened Species, 2004

 The 2004 International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources Red List contains 15,589 species threatened with extinction. The assessment includes species from a broad range of taxonomic groups including vertebrates, invertebrates, plants and fungi. However, this figure...is based on an assessment of less than 3 per cent of the world?s 1.9 million described species.

 Among major species groups, the percentage of threatened species ranges between 12 per cent and 52 per cent. The IUCN Red List identifies 12 per cent of birds as threatened, 23 per cent of mammals, and 32 per cent of amphibians. Although reptiles have not been completely assessed, the turtles and tortoises are relatively well-reviewed, with 42 per cent threatened...Roughly a third of sharks, rays and chimeras have been assessed and 18 per cent of this group is threatened. Regional case studies on freshwater fishes indicate that these species might be more threatened than marine species. Of plants, only conifers and cycads have been completely assessed with 25 per cent and 52 per cent threatened respectively. 

 The first complete assessment of amphibians reveals that they are likely to be the most threatened vertebrates. Not only are amphibians significantly more threatened than other assessed vertebrate groups, but they also have a higher proportion of species on the verge of extinction. This high level of threat might be an underestimate, as 23 per cent of amphibians could not be assessed because sufficient data were not available. These poorly known species are often rare and have small distributions. 

 There are major gaps in our knowledge of the status of threatened species. While the status of vertebrates is relatively well documented, we know little about non-terrestrial systems (freshwater and marine), or many species-rich habitats (such as tropical forests or the ocean depths), or species-rich groups such as invertebrates, plants and fungi (which together compose the overwhelming majority of species). 

 Threatened species are not randomly distributed across orders and families...This non-random distribution of threats across the tree of life means that entire evolutionary lineages are liable to go extinct very quickly. For example, of the birds, the albatrosses, cranes, parrots, pheasants, and pigeons are significantly more threatened than other groups. Of the mammals, the ungulates, carnivores, primates, dugongs and manatees are particularly at risk. 

 Extinction in Recent Times: As we learn more about the status of species, the world?s list of extinctions continues to increase...Over the past 20 years, 27 documented extinctions or extinctions in the wild have occurred. These numbers certainly underestimate the true number of extinctions in historic times as the majority of species have not been described, most described species have not been comprehensively assessed, and proving that a species has gone extinct can take years to decades.

 Recent extinction rates far exceed the rates of extinction in the fossil record ...Although the estimates vary greatly, it appears that current extinction rates are at least two to four orders of magnitude above background rates.

 Extinctions are becoming increasingly common on continents. While the vast majority of extinctions since 1500 AD have occurred on oceanic islands, continental extinctions are now as common... This trend is consistent with the fact that most terrestrial threatened species are continental.

 DUBIOUS PACKAGE

 It is not a very exciting prospect to have to think of Mr Narendra Modi as part of one?s private, conjugal decisions. But the chief minister of Gujarat could become an important factor in the size of the family that an elected representative in Mr Modi?s state might be allowed to have. His government will bring a bill in the next assembly session that will impose, on becoming an act, the two-child norm on all elected representatives from the panchayats to parliament. This is technically unexceptionable. The Supreme Court has upheld the Haryana assembly?s legal competence to impose such a norm on a member of the municipality. Last year, the court had done the same with panchayats and zilla parishads. So the next step in Haryana should logically be an imposition of the norm on members of parliament and legislative assemblies. The court has said that this will not amount to an infringement on the democratic or fundamental rights of the people (contesting elections is not a fundamental right), nor will it be an abuse of religious freedom. The growth of population in India is an immediate enough menace to justify invoking the idea of ?national interest?. Hence the court, and some concerned chief ministers, are sending out an urgent message about the crisis.

 Yet why does the prospect of such a bill appear not entirely innocuous, and even somewhat ominous, in a state like Gujarat? The last genocide in the state, together with its continuing aftermath, has placed Gujarat in a certain light with regard to the abuse of the rights of minorities ? their rights to life and liberty. In the state machinery?s sectarian propaganda, led by Mr Modi, the procreative powers of the minority community had featured cleverly and perniciously, bolstered with unsound mathematics. It is possible for such a machinery to shift gear, quite effortlessly, from sectarian rant to the jargon of development. The latest impetus behind the two-child bill is supposed to be part of the ?packaged? approach to population control being worked out by Mr Modi?s state-of-the-art mode of governance. The imposition of the norm is problematic enough in a country where inequality of education and opportunities, and therefore of representation, is endemic and complex. Laws become what human beings do with them, and Mr Modi?s most historic actions do not inspire much hope in his government?s ?legal competence?.

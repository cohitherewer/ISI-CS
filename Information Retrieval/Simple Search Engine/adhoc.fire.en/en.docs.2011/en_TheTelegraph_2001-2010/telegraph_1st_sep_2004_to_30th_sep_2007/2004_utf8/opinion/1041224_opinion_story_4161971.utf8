 TWO WORLDS IN ONE

 Into their minds

The Dictators: Hitlers Germany, Stalins 

Russia 

By Richard Overy, 

Penguin, pound;18

Stalin and Hitler have both been much written about 

and discussed. Marxist historiography depicts Stalin as one who betrayed the socialist 

revolution and Hitler as a racist monster. In his book, Richard Overy attempts 

a comparative analysis of Hitler?s Germany with Stalinist Russia.

 Among the many scholars before Overy who have dealt with these two dictators, Alan Bullock portrays the parallels in their careers in Hitler and Stalin (London, 1991). Unlike Bullock?s narrative style, Overy structures his volume around certain themes. Overy emphasizes on the importance of individuals in totalitarian dictatorship and tries to unravel the thinking process of the two dictators and their relationships with the host societies. 

 Overy is dismissive of the political scientists? attempt to construct a typology of totalitarianism. He asserts that both the dictatorships were products of crisis situations. It was war that gave birth to these two dictatorial states and they remained obsessed with warfare, albeit in different ways. While Hitler?s mentality was shaped by the life he led in the trenches during World War I, Stalin was deeply affected by the Civil War within Russia. Hitler conceptualized war in nationalistic-racist framework and Stalin visualized it as an aspect of class-struggle. For Hitler, the enemy was the global anti-German coalition led by the Bolshevik-Jewish elements. In Stalin?s paradigm, the threat was represented by global capitalism. Hitler conceived that it was his duty to save Aryan Germany and Stalin perceived himself as the only one only could protect Lenin?s revolutionary state in Russia. 

 The demands for survival, argued Hitler and Stalin, required one-party dictatorial rule. The liberal bourgeois order with its multi-party parliamentary democracy was regarded by both as rotten. Germany and Russia had experienced political instability after World War I. And they longed for political stability, even at the cost of democracy. 

 Overy challenges the assertion that Hitler and Stalin were weak dictators. The Nationalist Socialist Party and the Communist Party were cadre-based parties without any intra-party democracy. After 1926, Hitler became the undisputed leader of the former and by 1935, Stalin had become the master of the latter in the erstwhile USSR. They initiated violent social revolutions. While Stalin eliminated the Kulaks, Hitler destroyed the Prussian Junker. On this point, Overy somewhat draws on David Schoenbaum?s Hitler?s Social Revolution. Further, both the states maintained camps for political dissidents. 

 The debate whether Hitler had a blueprint for starting a global war or whether he was a mere opportunist aiming to overthrow the Versailles settlement, remains unresolved. Overy accepts that Hitler was planning for total war after 1933. But instead of concentrating merely on political and diplomatic affairs, he provides data on Hitler?s economic policy. Interestingly, rather than the market, the state played the dominant role in the Russian and German economies. Drawing on his earlier work, The Nazi Economic Recovery (Cambridge, 1996), Overy writes that Hitler constructed a war economy by the mid-Thirties. 

 The Dictators is a brilliant survey. However, Marxists may cry foul against the claim that Stalin?s Russia, till 1945, looked very similar to Hitler?s Germany.

 A SONG IN THE WIND 

 OBITUARY

 M.S. Subbulakshmi (1916-2004) 

 The legendary singer and Bharat 

 Ratna, M.S. Subbulakshmi, was ?MS? to countless Carnatic 

 music lovers in India and abroad. She was the ?Queen of 

 Song? to Nehru, who paid her the compliment thrice, the 

 first time in 1949, when she had already become a cult figure. 

 Born on September 16, 1916, to 

 Madurai Shanmukhavadivu Ammal and Subrahmaniya Iyer, in 

 Madurai, Subbulakshmi started learning classical music and 

 playing the veena, first from her mother, an accomplished 

 veena player herself, and then under Karur Venkarama Bhagavatar. 

 She was soon accompanying her mother, both at veena recitals 

 and concerts.

 Affectionately called Kunjamma 

 at home, MS, with her amazing musical virtuosity, heightened 

 by her extraordinarily lovely face, fast became a star. 

 In 1933, at the age of 17, she gave her first concert at 

 the Madras Music Academy. Earlier, at the Mahamaham festival 

 in Kumbakonam, MS had already created a sensation.

 In June 1936, when she had already 

 settled down in Madras with her mother, it was a chance 

 meeting with T. Sadasivam, then advertising manager for 

 the popular Tamil weekly, Ananda Vikatan, which ushered 

 in a new phase in her life. In 1940, she married Sadasivam, 

 who became her ?friend, philosopher and guide?. 

 The music rings

 Besides her mother, MS had the 

 good fortune to learn music from the leading lights of the 

 day ? Musuri Subramania Iyer, Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer, 

 Madurai Srinivasa Iyengar and Seithur Sundaresa Bhattar. 

 MS?s wide musical contacts, including that with the famous 

 ?Veena? Dhanammal family, helped her replenish her repertoire. 

 There was a Bengal connection too. MS learnt bhajans 

 from Dilip Kumar Roy of the Aurobindo Ashram in Pondicherry. 

 Subbulakshmi also had a brief 

 but memorable career in films. All the four films she had 

 acted in were great musicals of that era, including the 

 famous Meera (1945), produced in both Tamil and Hindi, 

 which catapulted her to national fame. 

 Given Sadasivam?s connections 

 with the Congress, MS drew appreciation from national leaders 

 like Gandhi, Nehru and C. Rajagopalachari. Bapu equated 

 listening to her with ?losing oneself in god?.

 In 1944, MS gave five benefit 

 music recitals for the Kasturba Memorial Fund, in fulfilment 

 of a promise Rajaji had made to Gandhi. Since then, MS gave 

 hundreds of performances for charitable causes throughout 

 the country. 

 Some landmarks

 From the early Forties, various 

 awards came MS?s way ? the Isai Vaani, followed by the Padma 

 Bhushan in 1954, the Sangeet Natak Academy award in 1956, 

 the Sangeetha Kalanidhi award in 1968, the Magsaysay in 

 1974, the Padma Vibhushan in 1975, the Kalidas Samman, and 

 finally the Bharat Ratna, India?s highest civilian award, 

 in 1998. 

 A landmark in her musical career 

 was the invitation to the international music festival at 

 Edinburgh in 1963. In October 1966, MS took the UN general 

 assembly in New York by storm with a stunning recital. As 

 part of the Festival of India in Britain in 1982, MS gave 

 a scintillating performance at the Royal Albert Hall in 

 London and in Paris in 1985. She was conferred honorary 

 degrees by various universities. It was a rare honour when 

 MS was elected Member d? Honneur? by the International Music 

 Council in 1981. 

 In 2002, the Music Academy in 

 Madras conferred a ?lifetime achievement? award on MS. As 

 her health did not allow her to make the journey to receive 

 the award, the president of India, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, in 

 a rare gesture, went to her house to deliver the award. 

 With her ends an era.

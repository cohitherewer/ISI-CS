 Letters to Editor

 When wishes die

 Sir ? K.Venkatesh?s unfulfilled last wish shifts the focus to a much-neglected issue (?Death-wish patient denied last plea?, Dec 16). In India, where there is an immense shortage of donors, and thousands waiting for transplants, the government continues to ignore the need for a review of the Human Organ Transplant Act of 1994, which has been more of a hindrance and has enabled a huge illegal organ market to flourish. Why is the government shying away from looking at the practical side? What is the use of having a clause that allows relatives to reverse the dead donor?s wish of donating his organs? How is the act supposed to help when the body cannot be dissected for 48 hours, after which it becomes useless. Eye donations picked up ever since Aishwarya Rai pledged her eyes. Why can?t the government work towards creating awareness about other organ transplants as well?

 Yours faithfully,

S. Agarwal, Calcutta

 Poor show

 Sir ??Hometown stands by smut- scarred IIT boy? (Dec 17) does a good job of tracing the past of Raviraj Singh, the IIT student accused of selling the Delhi school clipping on the internet. But a foray into IIT Kharagpur would have provided more startling revelations. With internet connections in every room, and with no regulatory mechanism in place, porn is freely available. Moreover, the local area network allows pornographic material to be freely circulated. True, every student at IIT Kharagpur does not try to make money out of sleaze. But then exceptions are inevitable.

 The problem is much more deep-rooted than what is evident. IITs are located at places far removed from major cities, and far from apparent distractions of any kind. The academic environment is imposed on students by eliminating avenues of entertainment. Most students, seemingly, take a peek into pornographic sites after a hard day?s work. 

 The suspension and arrest of Raviraj Singh will not solve the greater ?problem?. True, he crossed the line, but an IIT student is prone to believing that he can do anything and get away with it. But everyone, the students themselves as well as the authorities, needs to realize that IITians are ordinary human beings and should be treated as such. 

 Yours faithfully,

A. Banerjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? As an ex-IITian, I am pained at the way the institution has been dragged into a controversy. Don?t bigger fry get away with more heinous crime than what Raviraj Singh has committed? May be it is time to remind IITians that their institute has the distinction to impart technical education of the highest quality. Let us not allow anybody to fling mud at it. 

 Yours faithfully,

Arun Chatterjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? The episode of ?sex in school? was forgotten by the media till the clipping found its way to the internet. But given that one can download an immense volume of pornography from the net ? free or paid ? the attention appears strange. If the baazee.com CEO is held accountable for whatever is traded on the site, the same parameters should apply to Google. Are the Indian authorities willing to go that distance?

 Yours faithfully,

Arunava Choudhury, Calcutta

 Sir ? The sex scandal involving the Delhi school has been hotting up again. But given that sleaze in India is not unknown, nor are pornographic sites uncommon, one wonders why this incident is being singled out. The arrest of the baazee.com chief may be a way to show the authorities? alertness, but what are we going to gain from it? If students have committed an immoral act within the school premises, they should be questioned and punished for it, not the entire world. 

 As for the IIT student who wanted to make a quick buck, one can only say that he is terribly unlucky. The two minute act, rumours have it, is still available for those who know how to seek it on the internet. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sumant Poddar, Calcutta 

 Sir ? The arrest of the baazee.com chief executive is one of the most retrograde steps in recent memory. Baazee.com represents an area in a knowledge-driven industry where the educated youth are trying to get a foothold. Such entrepreneurship adds to the wealth of the nation; the IT boom has already shown how. The government has to show maturity and restraint when it comes to this area. 

 However, there is no doubt that entrepreneurship is not a way to become rich quickly. This only suggests that we have a serious situation in front of us. Given that more than 50 per cent of the population is under 30 years of age, how do we propose to provide them with gainful employment? Entrepreneurship therefore is important, but we should also strive to make the process friendly, transparent and honourable.

 Yours faithfully,

A. Dutta, Calcutta

 Sir ? Raviraj Singh, far from being punished, needs to be congratulated for forcing the authorities to wake up to a social evil. It is his immature act that has refocussed attention on crime in the school campus, the callousness of school authorities and pornography on the internet. 

Yours faithfully, 

Bubun Roy Choudhury, Calcutta 

 Sir ? The 17-year-old accused in the mobile phone scandal was produced before the juvenile court in the company of his father and the Delhi Police ?in charge? of him. He should have been treated like any other criminal. 

 Yours faithfully,

Ghulam Rasul, Calcutta

 SOUND

 AND

 FURY

 The BJP didn?t think she was an able CM. It didn?t like her backing an in-party lobby. And it did not approve of her brother. Small wonder Uma Bharti is on the warpath

THORNS 

IN THE SIDE

The three who irked 

Bharti: 

 Pramod Mahajan: BJPs favourite backroom 

boy stopped Umas tiranga march from entering Maharashtra

 M. Venkaiah Naidu: The former BJP president announced 

that A.B. Vajpayee would not attend the last leg of the march

 Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi: The former spokesperson publicly 

chastised Uma for indiscipline.

 When Babulal Gaur distributed juicy jalebis to a group of people who had gathered at his Bhopal residence for lunch earlier this week, there was ? in that innocuous sweet ? a homily for all us. Life may appear sweet, the Madhya Pradesh chief minister?s dessert table seemed to stress, but look out for its twists and turns.

 It is a lesson that Uma Bharti ? a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) mascot for the last 15 years ? is being forced to learn. On Wednesday, when she was unceremoniously dumped by the BJP for being rude to party president L.K. Advani, it seemed to underline the fact that in politics, you never know what?s coming.

 Who would have thought on December 6, 1992 ? when photographers captured Bharti exulting with foe-turned-friend Murli Manohar Joshi as the Babri Masjid fell ? that sections of the BJP would actually be cheering her six-year-long suspension from the party? But the 45-year-old self-styled sanyasin, largely credited with steering her party to victory in Madhya Pradesh last year, doesn?t care. She is still taking potshots at Advani.

 Truly, equations change more often in politics than on a school blackboard. Till just the other day, Uma was one of Advani?s blue-eyed girls, a member of his select coterie that?s a who?s-who of the party?s second-rung leaders. Advani lieutenant Arun Jaitley was her firm supporter, as was the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, an outfit that?s otherwise not so fond of women. And even Babulal Gaur was Uma?s final choice for chief minister, after she was forced to step down from the post in September.

 Now Gaur is distributing jalebis. Jaitley is said to be upset with Uma and her shenanigans. The RSS is looking the other way. And Advani is not entertaining her, at least not yet.

 But then, Uma didn?t quite write the book on how an ideal politician should behave. When Sushma Swaraj ? with her modestly-draped pallu and sindoor-billowing hair parting ? was the BJP?s idea of a perfect woman, Uma had trendily cropped hair, wore an outlandish saffron outfit, looked after some well-bred dogs and drove around in a Gypsy. It was also said that she collected perfume bottles and Mattel products.

 To many, Uma Bharti was a maverick. Some saw her as a woman who got into trouble because of her habit of speaking out her mind. A few even thought that Uma never got her due because she was a woman, and belonged to the Other Backward Classes.

 There was something of the lost girl in her ? a sense of romance enhanced by the fact that Uma had forsaken her personal life for a medley of politics and religion. For long years, newspapers and party insiders had talked about the close ties that Uma shared with BJP?s former ideologue, K.N. Govindacharya. A few months ago, Uma said that Govindacharya had once wanted to marry her, but she?d turned him down because she couldn?t give up her quaint brand of sanyas.

 It was, after all, the only life that Uma had known for long. When she was small ? some say all of six ? she moved around her home state, Madhya Pradesh, reciting Hindu scriptures. At some point of time, she caught the eye of BJP?s M.P. leader, Vijayaraje Scindia. With the Rajmata?s firm support, Uma kept going up the BJP ladder.

 Despite her mercurial disposition, the problems that Uma has been facing are of recent origin ? a reflection of the wild infighting that is going on inside the party. The second rung ? a group that includes Bharti and Jaitley, besides Pramod Mahajan, M.Venkaiah Naidu and Sushma Swaraj ? has been eyeing the top post in the party, especially since the two stalwarts ? Advani and A.B. Vajpayee ? are well into their 70s. So, Swaraj does not like Jaitley, who does not like Mahajan, who does not like Uma, who does not like Naidu.

 In such a hostile climate, all that Uma wanted was her place under the sun. When she was denied that, she began to air her grouses. The party had asked her to step down after a non-bailable warrant was issued against her in connection with an old case in Karnataka. She resigned, but was not reinstated when the case was withdrawn. 

 The BJP leadership thought its reasons were sound. Uma was not quite an able chief minister, and was giving too much of space to an in-party anti-globalisation lobby led by S. Gurumurthy and Govindacharya. And then there was her controversial and unpopular brother, Swami Prasad Lodhi, who was said to be calling the shots in Bhopal while she sat on the gaddi.

 So, not surprisingly, Uma was smouldering ? and waiting to burst. It happened at Wednesday?s meeting. Now Uma watchers are waiting for the next act. Will she, like mentor Govindacharya, retire into a shell till accepted by the BJP? Or will she, like former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Kalyan Singh, try and harm the party?

 Politics, like a good jalebi, will take its own course.

 STILL NOT OUT

 Sports bodies in India are of no consequence and command no public interest. The only exception to this statement is the Board of Control for Cricket in India. This is not because of any virtue embedded in the BCCI but it is a function of the status that the game of cricket has come to acquire in India. This special status is only partially related to the performance of the Indian cricket team on the playing fields. After India won the World Cup in 1983 and began to win other tournaments and test matches, and after cricket was made available on television, cricket became a national obsession. The fan following of cricket witnessed an exponential increase. There was also a change in the attitude of Indian cricketers who became more professional, more disciplined and more eager to win. All these developments happened simultaneously with an enormous amount of money pouring into cricket. Almost overnight, cricketers became millionaires and the BCCI became one of the wealthiest sports bodies in the world. One consequence of this is the sharp increase in interest in the activities of the BCCI. People from different walks of life evince a desire to get involved in the activities of the BCCI, and those who do not want to know what is happening within the BCCI.

 Unfortunately, the running of the BCCI has not quite kept pace with the professionalization visible in the game it seeks to regulate and run. Feudalism is inscribed as a birthmark on the body politic of the BCCI. Cricket in India, after all, was born under the patronage of the native princes. That patronage has, of course, evaporated but the feudal ambience continues. The BCCI continues to be run by powerful and influential individuals. Among such individuals, Mr Jagmohan Dalmiya is without doubt the most successful and with perhaps the biggest possible contribution in making the BCCI a force to reckon with in the International Cricket Council. But this should not serve as a justification for Mr Dalmiya?s latest appointment as patron-in-chief. This appointment means that Mr Dalmiya will continue in a super-luminary position even after his tenure as president of the BCCI comes to an end. This smacks of feudalism and is a throwback to the days of the princes when professionalism was unknown. This appointment obstructs the greater professionalization of the BCCI. Mr Dalmiya would have played cricket if he had raised his bat and gone back to the pavilion to a rousing applause.

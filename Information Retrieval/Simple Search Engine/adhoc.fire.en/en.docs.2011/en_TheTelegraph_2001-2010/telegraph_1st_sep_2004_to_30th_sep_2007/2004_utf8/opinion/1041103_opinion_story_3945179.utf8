 Letters to Editor

 The fall girl

 Sir ? Poor Sushma Swaraj. First, she accused Sonia Gandhi of having her eyes set on the prime minister?s chair. Sadly, her acerbic comments earned her more brickbats than bouquets. Sonia went on to renounce the top job, which left Sushma with egg on her face. So after the results were declared in Maharashtra, Swaraj decided to bury the hatchet, saying that the Congress owed its success to Sonia. Sadly, her plans have now gone haywire with the hawks forcing her to retract her statement (?Sushma does Sonia U-turn?, Oct 18). Ticking off Swaraj for praising Sonia is wrong. But giving the Congress chief the sole credit for her party?s success is not correct either. If the BJP came a cropper in Maharashtra, it is because it continues to shut its eyes to the electorate?s changing preferences. The Hindu right just doesn?t sell anymore. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Tame surrender

 Sir ? Australia?s first series win on Indian soil after 35 years can be attributed to two factors ? hard work and confidence in their own abilities. The losing side was found lacking in both these aspects ? even before the Nagpur test began, the Indians had given up all hope about the outcome. Sourav Ganguly?s decision to sit out of the game at the last moment and complaints about the pitch not only sapped the morale of the side but also portrayed the skipper in poor light. 

 The team selection has been very poor and the players are short on form as well as confidence. These factors have not gone unnoticed by the Australians who are renowned for their meticulous preparation. Before the Australian series began, the Board of Control for Cricket in India did not find it necessary to organize practice matches. This is why several players, despite their lack of form, have still managed to find place in the team. Again, given the circumstances, Ganguly should have been relieved of his duties. But then there might be no need for it now, as his replacement is unlikely to be any better. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sanjeev Sinha, Belmont, US

 Sir ? I have a few suggestions to improve India?s performance. Rahul Dravid should open the innings. In any case, he is at the crease within the first three overs. Our batsmen should also double up as bowlers. After all, it is the tail-enders who are making all the runs. Why should the batsmen then be paid a huge amount of money for spending just 20 minutes at the crease? That brings us to Sachin Tendulkar. He can?t be dropped from the team ? after all, he is a national icon. However, someone should introduce him to the joys of tennis so that he can get afflicted with tennis elbows with less tension. The national selectors will then have less problems dropping Tendulkar from the team. More important, this will create a free slot in the team which can be filled by some other talented youngster.

 Yours faithfully,

S. Ghose, Calcutta

 Sir ? There are many reasons for India?s dismal performance against Australia. First, the cricket board?s offer of a lucrative contract to a few old hands was made to garner their support. This kind of politics has vitiated the atmosphere and affected the team spirit ? India?s performance in the Asia Cup and the ICC championship bears testimony to this fact. Second, one does not know if the players really follow John Wright?s strategy on the field. They are more interested in the money and glamour, and refuse to take the game seriously, as they are more or less assured of their place in the side. Finally, what hurt the Indians most in the series against Australia was their casual approach. The team did not even put up a semblance of a fight and ended up losing tamely to its formidable opponent.

 Yours faithfully,

N.C. Chakrabarti, Calcutta

 Sir ? A pathetic and spineless batting performance brought about India?s downfall against a quality opposition in Nagpur. None of the batsmen lived up to their reputation. Sachin Tendulkar may be excused as he was making a comeback after an injury, but what happened to the other heavyweights like Dravid and Ganguly? The real reason for India?s humiliating loss was the batsmen?s inability to bat on fast, bouncy wickets. Indian batsmen are used to batting on slow-turners. But then quality players should be able to perform consistently on any track. Perhaps it is time for the BCCI to scout for fresh talent. 

 Yours faithfully,

Richard Saviel, Highgate, Australia

 Sir ? Most Indians would be hanging their heads in shame after the debacle in Nagpur, except the national cricketer. But then he has very little to complain about. His performance on field has no bearing on his fat bank balance. All he is concerned about is his performance in ad-films where he is competing with Big B himself. Moreover, he has the right to fall sick at will, citing one injury or the other. The BCCI needs to be congratulated for devising a novel system for selecting and rewarding our non-performing players. 

 Yours faithfully,

P.K. Shome, Rourkela

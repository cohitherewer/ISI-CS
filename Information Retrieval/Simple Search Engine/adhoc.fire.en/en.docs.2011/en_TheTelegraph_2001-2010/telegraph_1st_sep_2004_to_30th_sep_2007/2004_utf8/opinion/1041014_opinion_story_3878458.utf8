 ICON OF DOUBT AND INTERPRETATION

 OBITUARY

 Jacques Derrida (1930-2004)

 An author is dead as soon as he writes a text. The text lives and is open to reading and interpretation. Jacques Derrida died on October 9, but the contribution he made to the art of reading will continue to influence interpretation. He was born in 1931 in Algeria and his parents were Sephardic Jews.

 He came to France when he was 19 and then went to Harvard on a scholarship in 1956-7. In the Sixties, he was among those who were associated with the avant garde journal, Tel Quel. In Paris, he taught at the ?cole Normale Sup?rieure. In the US, he held visiting appointments in Yale and in Johns Hopkins. His first work, published in 1932, was a translation of Edmund Husserl?s L? Origine de le Geometrie to which he wrote a long introduction. This won Derrida recognition among a handful of phenomenologists. It was only in 1967 that Derrida announced his presence to the intellectual world with the publication of three books, Of Grammatology, Writing and Difference, and Speech and Phenomena. These books established Derrida as a major philosopher, but this was not a term with which Derrida was ever comfortable. In 1981, he said, ?I am of course a ?philosopher? in the institutional sense that I assume the responsibilities of a teacher of philosophy. But I am not sure that the ?site? of my work, reading philosophical texts and posing philosophical questions, is itself properly philosophical. Indeed, I have attempted more and more systematically to find a non-site, or a non-philosophical site, from which to question philosophy.??

 The key to Derrida?s oeuvre are the words, ?to question philosophy?. His writings question established notions and reverse existing hierarchies. He has argued through interlocutions of philosophical texts that there is a common and inescapable logocentrism in all philosophical systems. Derrida called this the ?metaphysics of presence?? that posits first and final causes from which forms of existence can be deduced and through which they can be explained and endowed with meaning.

 Metaphysics, according to Derrida, comprehends the world through binary oppositions, one of which is prior and superior to the other. The first term of the binary is then claimed, in metaphysics, to be the foundational and self-sufficient term. The secondary term which challenges this self-sufficiency is then sought to be effaced. Derrida upturned this hierarchy and argued that the term considered secondary and derivative is primordial and general. Identity, Derrida argued, exists not only through difference, but its existence is also deferred. Hence Derrida?s neologism, differance, a combination of the two verbs, differ and defer. In Derrida?s hands everything is only as it differs from and defers something else. Derrida attacked the notions of absolute truth and foundational or grounding concepts.

 Knowledge, according to Derrida, is not a systematic tracking down of a truth that is hidden but may be found. Rather, knowledge is about free play in a field of infinite relations. Derrida looked at what a text suppresses, where a text slips, where it doesn?t work. His project was not to reconstruct a text but to deconstruct it. Derrida thus took away the assurance of a text?s authority and made the source of a critique lie in the text itself. Derrida gave to the reader a sense of liberation. He blessed the reader with the ?joyous affirmation of the free play of the world and without truth, without origin, offered to an active interpretation.? 

 The liberation was the aftermath of radical doubt and the collapse of all dogmas.

 It was an irony that Derrida, the iconoclast, himself became an icon.

 Letters to Editor

 Picture of restraint

 Sir ? The controversy over Sonia Gandhi?s portrait in the Speaker?s Hall is precisely the kind of ugly mess Manmohan Singh wanted to avoid when, immediately after coming to power, he forbade his portrait to be hung in government offices (?No clues in Sonia riddle?, Oct 21). But such directions have no meaning in the face of the party workers? determination to show their devotion to the leader. And who can blame them? One never knows if the leaders really mean what they say? In the circumstances, they might as well be hanged for disobedience than for disrespect. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sunita Mukherjee, Calcutta

 Screen test

 Sir ? First they politicized religion, then cricket. Now our politicians have not even spared the film censor board (?Kher cut out, Sharmila steps in?, Oct 14). The inexplicable sacking of the chairman of the Central Board of Film Certification, Anupam Kher, and his replacement with Sharmila Tagore, a known Congress ?sympathizer?, shows the United Progressive Alliance to be no better than the National Democratic Alliance, which had showed similar favouritism in the appointment of governors. The film community ought to unitedly oppose this decision. The government should keep sports and art free of politics. Instead, it should focus on graver issues like poverty, insurgency and communal unrest. The UPA should realize that the electorate voted for it not to be served the same wine in a fresh bottle. If it doesn?t realize this, it may as well give up hopes of coming to power again.

 Yours faithfully,

Sourav Sengupta, Durgapur 

 Sir ? If Anupam Kher finds being identified with the RSS repulsive, why did he accept a position of responsibility from the BJP; known to be the RSS?s political arm? Kher should think constructively. He should not allow his immense talent to be led astray by anger.

 Yours faithfully,

Sushant Chatterjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? Anupam Kher?s mistake, in the eyes of the UPA, was to stall Final Solutions, the documentary on the Gujarat riots. Telecasting it would have helped the Congress revile the BJP. But the Congress is no better. Look at how it stopped the telecast of Prakash Jha?s documentary on Jayaprakash Narayan simply because it showed some Congress leaders in bad light. 

 Yours faithfully,

Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur

 Sir ? How can Sharmila Tagore be expected to censor vulgar scenes from films when she herself was criticized for wearing a bikini? At present, government-funded ?autonomous? bodies are hard pressed to work owing to political pressure. It would be far better to have a system of self-imposed censorship. 

 Yours faithfully,

M. Agrawal, Dariba

 Sir ? Doordarshan?s refusal to exhibit Prakash Jha?s film on JP shows the myopia of ruling politicians. The film had at first been accepted for exhibition but second thoughts ? or advice ? compelled DD to ask Jha to drop some references to Emergency excesses, which are merely historical facts. These facts cannot be suppressed simply because they are unpalatable to the Congress. It is such dishonesty which had earlier made the UPA government remove the NCERT director, J.S. Rajput, and NCERT change textbooks on the grounds of ?saffronization?. The changed feathers of Laloo Prasad Yadav, who was imprisoned during Emergency and who now praises Indira Gandhi, also comes as a shock. The UPA cannot afford to take Anupam Kher lightly. He has the support of the world of films as well as the opposition. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Balram Misra, New Delhi

 CIVIL WELCOME

 The decision of the government of India to allow a large group of journalists from Pakistan to visit Jammu and Kashmir needs to be welcomed and supported. By all accounts, the visit, so far, has been hugely successful. The task now is to build on this visit to generate greater people-to-people contact between the two countries. As is well known, the government of India has traditionally been reluctant to allow foreigners, and especially Pakistanis, to visit Jammu and Kashmir since the onset of militancy in 1990. However, as the political situation in Jammu and Kashmir changed, New Delhi has encouraged foreigners to visit different parts of the state, including Kashmir valley. But Jammu and Kashmir was, till recently, out of bounds for Pakistanis. The new government led by Mr Manmohan Singh seems to have now reversed that decision. Indeed, it is the first time that nearly 20 Pakistani journalists, representing virtually the whole spectrum of the media in the country, are visiting Kashmir. They represent major national dailies like The News, The Nation, Dawn and the Daily Jang and newly established private television channels like GEO TV and Indus TV. In Jammu, the journalists visited migrant camps of Kashmiri Pandits, interacted with local media, spoke at a meeting of the Chamber of Commerce, and discussed political issues with academics and students. No restrictions whatsoever have been put on their movements. In the Kashmir valley, the visiting press delegation will meet the separatist leadership of the All Party Hurriyat Conference and government officials, including the chief minister. This is unprecedented and path-breaking. For the first time, the Pakistani people will get a first-hand account of the situation in the valley from their own citizens.

 The message that New Delhi clearly wants to convey is that there is nothing to hide in Kashmir and that the Pakistan government?s propaganda may have been off-target. The visit of the journalists may also help to create a conducive atmosphere for the further strengthening of the peace process between India and Pakistan. It may also help to provide the Pakistan president, Mr Pervez Musharraf, if he is so inclined, the space to move down from his absolutist stand on Kashmir. The government of India must now build on this latest initiative. It is clear that one of the greatest strengths of India is its democracy and its vibrant civil society. It must allow Pakistan?s people to be exposed to India?s civil society without demanding any reciprocity from Islamabad.

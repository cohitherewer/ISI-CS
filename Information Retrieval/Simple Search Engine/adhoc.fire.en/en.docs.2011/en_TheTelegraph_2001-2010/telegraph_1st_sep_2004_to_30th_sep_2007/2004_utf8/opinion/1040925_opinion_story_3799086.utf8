 OLD TUNE, NEW LYRICS

 While laying down the guidelines of India?s foreign policy, Jawaharlal Nehru made foreign relations the fundamental feature of independence. Nehru?s view was global. He wanted India?s voice to be heard on the world stage despite pressing problems with Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. There are echoes of this concern in Mr Manmohan Singh?s debut speech to the United Nations general assembly. Mr Singh?s speech marked a departure as well as a retrieval. It is a departure from the recent past. The previous prime minister, Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who was a better orator than Mr Singh, invariably focussed on India?s problems with Pakistan and the activities of Islamic jihadis in Jammu and Kashmir. The rest of Mr Vajpayee?s foreign policy radiated from this focal point. This won Mr Vajpayee brownie points at home but reduced India to a local player concerned about its own local autonomy. Even Mr Vajpayee?s bonhomie with Washington was driven by the need to eradicate violence in Kashmir and not by any deep philosophical consideration about the character of Indian foreign policy.

 The retrieval is noticeable in the way Mr Singh has recalled some aspects of Nehru?s vision. Mr Singh spoke of the transnational dimensions of all problems that confront the nation states. Correspondingly, he said, the responses to problems would have to be global; the major national problems can only be resolved through a world consensus. These views are nothing if not Nehruvian. Mr Singh followed this up quite aptly by referring to Rajiv Gandhi who as prime minister of India addressed issues that affected the world and could only be resolved by the cooperation of all nations. Mr Singh?s appeal to a ?global consensus of willing nations? has a long and distinguished lineage in Indian policy-making. The emphasis on the world has not been a consistent and an unbroken line but it has certainly been a prominent ? if not dominant ? strand in Indian foreign policy.

 It tends to be overlooked in the mindless debates about Indian foreign policy that the underlining of the global can only be done by the leader of a nation that is confident and secure in itself. Like Nehru, Mr Singh spoke to the world from a secure site and not from fear. Mr Singh?s speech to the UN was refreshing because it was so remarkably non-partisan. It is tempting to use the word non-aligned but for the fact that non-alignment had the Cold War as its determining context. Mr Singh has taken the basic tenets of Nehruvian non-alignment and adapted it to altered circumstances. Mr Singh?s speech is an assertion of independence and of the need to pose long-term values against immediate ends. The speech will be remembered not for its oratory but for its cerebral qualities. Content prevailed over rhetoric.

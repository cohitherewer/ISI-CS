 Letters to Editor

 United colours

 Sir ? While the exit of Colin Powell, the man famously described by Harry Belafonte as a ?house slave?, is not unwelcome, it is unlikely that his replacement will be any better (?Popular Powell puts in papers?, Nov 16). George W. Bush (now re-empowered and well-ensconced in his position as the supreme commander of a brain-dead race) will never nominate anybody who does not belong to his own bizarre ideological mindset to the crucial post of the secretary of state just vacated. Anyone who feels tempted to mourn Powell?s resignation would do well to recollect his performance on the floor of the United Nations in February 2003, when he presented his case for the alleged non-compliance of Iraq with UN disarmament requirements. A case that, as is well known, was based on ?evidence? that has proved to be a bag of lies.

 Yours faithfully,

Biswapriya Purkayastha, Shillong 

 Unjust cause

 Sir ? Rudrangshu Mukherjee?s ?Say no to bandhs? (Nov 14) was a timely reminder of the state of affairs in West Bengal. The most striking paradox in the state is that here the government acts like a political party and the ruling party acts as the government. It is understandable if political parties protest against a court ruling that declares bandhs to be illegal and suggests deduction in the salary of government employees. The government, whose function is to serve as an arm of the state and not agitate, should see that the court?s directive is carried out. Yet, here we have a Left Front government challenging the court verdict. If the government finds strike justifiable, by an extension of the same logic, it should consider all other kinds of anarchy justifiable as well. Would Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee please ponder this point before he sends his next invitation to industrialists to set up shop in West Bengal?

 Yours faithfully,

Arunava Choudhury, Calcutta

 Sir ? I agree with Rudrangshu Mukherjee about the need for a bandh-free state to further development. However, despite its shortcomings, the ruling party seems to have understood the need for creating the right environment for industries. Less priority is accorded to labour union demands. There are also indications that the importance accorded to land reforms has decreased with time. However, it will remain a mystery why the left continues to place such premium on its right to strike work. Does it realize that a single such act nullifies years of its own efforts to turn the situation around?

 Yours faithfully,

Abdus Samad, Incheon,

 Sir ? With so many bandhs a year how can West Bengal even think of going global? The fuel price hike may be an issue close to the heart of the left?s electorate, but what will the Socialist Unity Centre of India gain from a strike? Will it change the international pricing policy of oil or will it pressurize the Central government to reduce prices? How can SUCI leaders fail to see that the huge loss of revenue adds to the gap in the ratio of balance of payments? 

 Yours faithfully,

Sumant Poddar, Calcutta

 Sir ? In a communist country, strikes are never allowed on the assumption that the administration, which consists of elected representatives of the working class, knows what is best for its electorate. Strike is unheard of in a dictatorship. Bandhs are a unique feature of a democratic society. It is true that most strikes observed since independence have yielded no result. It is also not expected that the SUCI strike and those of others will yield any result. Issues causing dissatisfaction vary from group to group, section to section, even person to person. One cannot expect all sections of people to agree to a common agenda for calling a strike or not calling it. But this does not mean that strikes have lost their relevance. It is important because it gives various sections of people an avenue to vent their energy in a safe manner.

 Yours faithfully,

Sanjoy Ghose, Calcutta

 Sir ? That the government attorney should become ?agitated? at the laudable anti-bandh stance by the Calcutta high court is not surprising (?Court orders bandh salary slash?, Nov 11). Political parties have always used the bandh in their interest. The huge financial loss on a bandh day is understandable. There is no reason for a government counsel to be upset only because the administration has been criticized. The job of the public advocate is to protect the interests of the citizens and not to shield the ruling party. Unfortunately, like most other public sectors, the judicial branch of the Bengal government may also have been infiltrated by ruling party cadre. This is probably why the attorney for the government did not waver from ?raising? his voice against the judges inside the courtroom. 

 It is a disgrace that the ruling government should scathingly attack the judiciary and get away with it. The Justice Amitava Lala episode is still fresh in public memory. All this is resulting in the loss of public trust in the judicial system. Some of this trust may be retrieved by strict measures against the government counsel who candidly affronts judges in the courtroom by virtue of his political backing. 

 Yours faithfully,

Kunal Saha, Columbus, US

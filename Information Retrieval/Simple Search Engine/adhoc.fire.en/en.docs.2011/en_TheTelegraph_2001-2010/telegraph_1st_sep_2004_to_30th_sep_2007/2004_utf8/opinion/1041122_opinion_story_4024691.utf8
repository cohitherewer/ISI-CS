 Letters to Editor

 Human rights and wrongs

 Sir ? The prime minister, Manmohan Singh, has claimed that India?s armed forces are enjoined to respect human rights. Perhaps he is unaware that the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act places the army above the law, and the Jammu and Kashmir Public Safety Act gives the police the power to detain people for up to two years without trial. Is this ?respect for human rights?? If the Central government truly believes in his statement, it ought to immediately withdraw these laws and swiftly begin investigation and prosecution of the soldiers and police personnel responsible for the long list of atrocities reported from the north-eastern states and Jammu and Kashmir. When no such initiative is taken, it is hardly surprising that Kashmiris remain cynical about a government that condemns militants? violence but does nothing to check the brutality originating from its own end?

 Yours faithfully,

Shankar Gopalakrishnan, Kodaikanal

 Small consolation

 Sir ? In ?The power of weakness? (Oct 28), Pratap Bhanu Mehta claims that there are ?obvious ways in which those who possess great power are constrained in the exercise of their power?. The claim seems plausible, but is it true? Look at the first Gulf War. On August 2, 1990, the Ba?athist government of Iraq invaded Kuwait. In retaliation, Iraq was extensively bombed by the forces of the United States of America, over a period of six weeks, in January and February 1991. During the six-month period between the Iraqi occupation and the American attack, did the US ever look constrained in exercising its powers? 

 The administration of George Bush Sr made no attempt to resolve the problem in a peaceful, diplomatic way, as international law requires all countries to do. Second, the administration also rebuffed the many proposals put forward by Iraq, of withdrawing its forces from Kuwait provided that its well-known territorial claims in the area were brought to the negotiating table. Third, the US media suppressed both its government?s unilateral refusal to negotiate and the Iraqi proposals. Also, the US government machinery used the six months to frighten its citizens into believing that Iraq possessed a monstrously powerful military. 

 The American public either knew, or could easily have found out, that the Iraqi military had failed miserably to defeat a decimated, post-revolution Iranian army, in a conflict that lasted from 1980 to 1988, even though it had been liberally supported in its efforts by the US, Soviet Union, Europe and the Arab oil states. That the one society that is widely supposed to be the model of a modern, working democracy can be sold so egregious a lie tells us that ideas like Mehta?s are not in consonance with the ground realities. Nation states, or the elites that control them, are usually administered by very clever people. When it is clear that they can no longer hope to coerce people into obedience, they work out that the same end can be reached by thought control. The idea has been best explained by Walter Lippmann who saw the people as a ?bewildered herd?, and held that their views had to be formed by a ?manufacture of consent?. It is astonishing how successfully this scheme of control has been used by powerful groups in modern societies

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? Pratap Bhanu Mehta?s views are reminiscent of traditional Indian foreign policy as it emerged after independence, characterized by gullibility and na?vet?. No wonder we were ?astonished? by the drubbing we received at the hands of our Chinese bhais in the North-east. 

 Mehta?s idea of dangling carrots in front of weaker neighbours like Bangladesh does not take into account the fact that there has been a generational change in their perception towards India over the last two decades. General Zia-ul-Haq, on his first visit to Bangladesh in the mid-Eighties, hailed the Mukti Bahini heroes as his heroes too. It was an admission of atrocities committed by West Pakistani forces during 1971. The present Pakistani establishment sends out emissaries to Dhaka who refer to the same freedom struggle as run by miscreants. This has been possible because the present government in Bangladesh is made up of the very forces who wanted east and west Pakistan to be together, since the majority in both countries had the same religion, and a common enemy, India. The circumstances in Bangladesh today are ideal for Pakistan?s Inter-Services Intelligence to plan its anti-India activities. It is safer than infiltrating into Kashmir, which would attract international attention and condemnation. Hence trying to mollify Bangladesh is useless, it would be read as a sign of India?s weakness.

 Yours faithfully,

Susenjit Guha, Calcutta

 Sir ? The power of the small or the inferior has been brought out very well by Pratap Bhanu Mehta. This is very much in evidence during elections in India, where small regional parties have been more successful of late than big national parties. It is only by allying with the former that the big parties are able to stake their claim on government-formation. 

 Yours faithfully,

Bibhabari Rath, Cuttack

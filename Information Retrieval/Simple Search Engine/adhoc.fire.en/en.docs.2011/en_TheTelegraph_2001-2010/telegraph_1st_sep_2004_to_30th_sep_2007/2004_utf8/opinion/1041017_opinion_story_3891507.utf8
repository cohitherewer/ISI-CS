 MISSING PRINCIPLE

 Anupam Kher is very angry. He is angry because he was sacked as the head of the all-India censor board. Kher believes his dismissal was unfair since he was first given a bad name and then hanged. According to him, he lost his position as a direct consequence of Mr Harkishen Singh Surjeet?s description of him as ?a RSS man??. What Kher?s anger does not take into account is the fact that his appointment to the censor board was an act of patronage bestowed on him by the previous political dispensation. The word patronage should not be misunderstood. Political regimes appoint various persons from a whole range of fields to government and semi-government posts. Some of these appointments come by way of reward for loyalty and some as a recognition of merit in a particular field. Sometimes ambassadors and heads of various bodies are appointed in this manner. These appointments should be clearly distinguished from posts given to bureaucrats as advancement in their careers as mandarins or policemen and so on. Those who are not government servants and yet receive posts from the government are receiving political appointments. Kher?s appointment falls into this category and by accepting it he implicitly accepted that another political regime could remove him.

 Anupam Kher could have avoided the humiliation, which he feels he has suffered, by offering to resign as soon as the National Democratic Alliance fell from power. This is true not just of Kher but of all the others who had been given government posts by the NDA government. Unfortunately, this is not the convention in Indian public life. At the root of the problem and Kher?s anger lies this absence of principle. Kher could derive consolation from the fact that he did what others in a similar position have always done. But others have not got hot under the collar when asked to quit. It is deplorable that most people, when they receive an official position, tend to cling on to their job and its perquisites. They forget that the position and the perquisites are linked to a political regime. Kher is conveying the impression that he is the victim of a political witch-hunt. There is no evidence of such a conspiracy. However, Kher will have to accept that he knowingly entered a political arena when he became the head of the censor board. He could have escaped the unseemly side of politics by submitting his resignation to his new political master.

 The level of public debate in India is suggested by the counter-claim made by Mr Surjeet?s comrades that he did not call Kher a RSS man. The principle, or more correctly the absence of one, behind the controversy has not entered the public discourse. Kher may continue to be angry but he could have avoided humiliation by acting in accordance with the spirit of democracy.

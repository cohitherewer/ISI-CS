 IS IT SAURA, OR ARE YOU HAPPY TO SEE ME?

 A DAY IN THE LIFE OF

 It is foolish to think that the film festival in Calcutta is just about watching films

 Wait until dark

 Some myths take very, very long to explode. Take the myth about Calcutta being the most sporting cricket-venue anywhere in the world. The idea had been nurtured for a long time with fondness and care ? though no one much cared whether the city actually managed to live up to this reputation. It took one fateful flood-lit evening of 1996 for that myth to be broken for good. 

 Till last Tuesday, I could have chopped off your right thumb for so much as suggesting that Calcutta might not be the best city in the country to host an international film festival. But don?t worry, that was only till last Tuesday, the penultimate day of the 10th Kolkata Film Festival. The annual event, instead of becoming bigger and better with the entry of the once-forbidden group called sponsors, has been robbed of much of the vigour surrounding it. The daily update about films went missing from the newspapers, and the theatres selected some years back for public (meaning out-of-the-Nandan-complex) screenings wore a desolate look.

 But that, I thought, was good for those who, like me, did not possess the much-coveted ?delegate card?, or an invitation to the Nandan-complex shows. There were plenty of tickets left around noon at the New Empire ticket-counter for the evening show of Carlos Saura?s film, The Seventh Day. 

 An adequately obscure Moroccan film, The Jail Bird, was shown to a handful of viewers who had bought tickets for the 5 pm show. After a seemingly endless ? though spanning less than two hours ? tour of cold prison cells in authoritarian Morocco, one could not be faulted for wanting some fresh air. And Saura was not coming on till 7.30.

 When I resurfaced in front of the theatre around 7.10, a snaking queue had almost reached Lindsay Street. But of course, this Spanish maker of films, which are lyrical and documentary at the same time, is a favourite of our home-bred aantels. But the faces I passed as I made my way to the end of the queue did not belong to the bearded, kurta-clad young men alone. There were private-firm executives, Writers? Buildings babus, even local puja-committee dadas. 

 One of them, while rushing past others to get the best seat, informed all and sundry that Saura?s films had a lot of ?iye? (common Bengali word, in this context meaning ?steamy scenes?). But he need not have rushed, his Rs 40 still got him a seat in the lower level, while those who cared to spend only Rs 10 were allotted the balcony seats. Festival rules, the usher explained, however bizarre they might be.

 If sitting between two men who were strangers was not uncomfortable enough, I found out soon that both were, in Mae West?s famous words, ?happy to see me?, more than they were to see the film. When I tried to ask the right-hand-side groper to go out if he didn?t like the film, I was asked by the people sitting behind us to keep my voice down. In the admirable silence of the hall ? broken, of course, by mobile phones ringing every now and then ? I could hear a zipper sliding down, and up. 

 I was foolish enough to think that the most civil thing to do ? without disturbing the rest ? would be to wait till the end to teach these ?film-buffs? a lesson. Both left minutes before the film ended. 

 Emerging into the lights again and hearing the voices discussing the finer points of the film were not reassuring. I think the next time I decide to watch a film, it will be a blockbuster at Inox.

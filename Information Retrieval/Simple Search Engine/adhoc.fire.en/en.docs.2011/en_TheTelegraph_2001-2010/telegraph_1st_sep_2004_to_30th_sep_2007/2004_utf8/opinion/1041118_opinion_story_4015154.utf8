 MORE THAN A GESTURE

 Sudipta Bhattacharjee

 In this season of elections, another has popped up online. This one pertains to Manipur, the state Manmohan Singh is scheduled to visit on Monday. Right above the ?vote? button appears this query: ?Do you think the Prime Minister would be able to offer any ground-breaking plans??

 It does not require much effort to guess the result of this referendum. There has been an outcry in Manipur for the repeal of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958, ever since the custodial death of Thangjam Manorama in July. A 10-member delegation of the Apunba Lup (an amalgam of organizations spearheading the agitation) met the prime minister in New Delhi earlier this month and was assured that the controversial legislation would be reviewed or replaced by a more humane act.

 Arambam Lokendra, who led the delegation, said Singh had told the team that it is his ?hope, prayer and belief? that it will be possible to work together with the people of Manipur to write a new chapter in the history of the state. When Y. Leirik Leima, a woman delegate, broke down during the proceedings, the prime minister rose to offer her a glass of water in what Lokendra described was ?a beautiful gesture.? This, in consonance with Singh?s promise to review the act, worked as an unprecedented balm on the people. As a result, there is now a sense of optimism, tinged with apprehension, about the prime minister?s forthcoming visit.

 Eventful journey

 This is because previous heads of state have paid lip-service to the demands of the people. The AFSPA has spurred protests in the North-east and Jammu and Kashmir, but given the security concerns, there has been no move to amend or review its clauses. The defence forces are, not surprisingly, unhappy with the developments and are keeping a wary eye on the events expected to unfold with the visit.

 It is significant that the prime minister offered to visit Imphal during a month which has been and promises to be particularly eventful. It was in November that the delegation met Singh. The same week marked the fifth anniversary of the hunger strike by 32-year-old Irom Sharmila Chanu. The Ningol Chakkouba festival was observed on Sunday, November 14. But the families of Sharmila and Manorama refrained from participating in the festivities and observed it as a ?mourning day.? And, finally, it is in November that the C. Upendra Singh commission inquiring into Manorama?s death will be submitting its findings. 

 Building bridges

 It was in keeping with these that B. Loitongbam of Human Rights Alert, Imphal, mobilized conflict management graduates in a university in Virginia, US, to observe a day of remembrance marking the fifth anniversary of Sharmila?s hunger strike and her arrest. At the well-attended gathering on a cold November night, he welcomed the prime minister?s ?warm gesture?, wishing that his refreshing attitude will hopefully contribute to long-term trust-building in the region. With the issue touching the heart so many thousands of miles away, one can only hope that the sense of anticipation among the wary population is not belied in the days to come.

 T.K.A. Nayar, special secretary to the prime minister, visited Imphal last week to oversee preparations for Singh?s maiden two-day trip. The only spanner in the works appears to be the sudden spate of abductions and the United Naga Council?s decision to block the two national highways in the state for 10 days from November 17-26. This would effectively halt the movement of essential commodities.

 It would certainly be a pity if this opportunity for healing and rapprochement went unheeded just because of the machinations of some vested interests.

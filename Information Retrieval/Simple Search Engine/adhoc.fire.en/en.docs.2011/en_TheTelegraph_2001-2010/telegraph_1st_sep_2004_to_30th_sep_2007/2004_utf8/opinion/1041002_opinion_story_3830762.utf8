 BALLAD

 OF A THIN

 MAN

 His memoirs have found their way to the press weeks ahead of their appearance between covers. And everyone?s hoping they?ll unwrap a bit of the riddle called Bob Dylan

POETS 

SOCIETY

Some other icons of the times: 

 Allen Ginsberg: The poet and activist was the guru of counter-culture

 Timothy Leary: The American writer and drug campaigner was a staunch 

proponent of LSD

 Pete Seeger: The folk singer who popularised We Shall Overcome is still 

a voice of the underdog.

 In the shrine of culthood, there are no short-cuts. And a group of old schoolfriends and worshippers of the same god knew that hardship was a pretty good indicator of devotion. So, when Delhi pickled under a blistering sun in the month of May, they made elaborate plans for a gala afternoon in the heat. Year after year, they got together on the 24th of the month for a birthday bash. They cut a cake and dutifully sang Blowin? in the Wind for the birthday boy ? a rebel called Bobby Dylan.

 Bob Dylan was god, because, to a generation that grew up on his poetry, he was the last of the radicals. He spoke against war, and he talked of love. He wept for the small farmer, and for the miner facing closure. He warned of impending doom and wrote of civil rights . He was the last icon of the tumultous Sixties, the rebel of all times. And then, he went on to rebel against rebellion itself.

 So, nobody was really greatly surprised when the 63-year-old Dylan revealed, in an extract from his memoirs carried by newspapers earlier this week, that he was a reluctant symbol of counter-culture. In the first volume of the three-set autobiography to be released on October 12, Dylan describes himself as an unwilling rebel who yearned for a nine-to-five existence.

 That was a new one, even though everybody who knew Dylan knew that he had long distanced himself from the dreamers. But what is truly endearing about Robert Allen Zimmerman ? as he was known before he dropped his Jewish identity for a name inspired by the poet, Dylan Thomas ? is that his magic still holds. Music lovers in Shillong and Calcutta still swing to his poetry all night long at special Dylan concerts on his birthday. And in Delhi, students of Miranda House remember how they nearly persuaded the students? union to name its annual cultural festival after a Dylan novel: unfortunately titled Tarantula.

 That?s because ? as one fan puts it ? for as long as Dylan was there, there was no one quite like him. And the writer of songs such as Masters of War, A Hard Rain?s A-Gonna Fall and The Times They are A-Changin? was there for long years ? ever since he sang the Jewish folk song, Hava Nagila at an informal concert at Greenwich Village in 1961. Dylan had left home in Duluth, Minnesota, for New York to meet his musical mentor, the ailing Woody Guthrie. He made a mark playing in small clubs. Joan Baez, singer, partner and sometime lover, describes her earliest recollection of hearing him sing. ?I heard a squeaky little rat singing in the Folk club in the Village and I was just stoned. I mean he was obviously one out of a couple of million.?

 Dylan really arrived after a favourable review appeared in the New York Times on September 29, 1961, attracting music talent scout John Hammond. It was Hammond who led him to a deal for an album with Columbia Records. And Dylan went on to ride the crest of fame, only to say later: ?After a while you learn that privacy is something you can sell, but you can?t buy it back.?

 Dylan?s memoirs ? Chronicles: Volume One ? should throw some light on his early years for the Simon amp; Schuster publication consists of ?first-person narratives focusing on significant periods? in his life and career. And since there are these big, gaping holes in the life and career of the radicals? favourite poster-boy, the memoirs should unwrap a bit of the riddle called Dylan.

 Quite possibly, it would look into Dylan?s love-hate relationship with religion, explaining how and why he enveloped himself with religion, and then stripped it off him, only to embrace it again. Born Jewish, Dylan mocked the religion, finding faith in Christianity. Dylanphiles have counted 61 biblical references in his album, John Wesley Harding. He became a born-again Christian in 1978, after considering moving to a kibbutz in Israel in the early Seventies.

 As the Palestine movement gained ground, Dylan?s endorsement of Israel emerged as a matter of concern for the liberals. Dylan?s 1974 comeback tour was dogged by rumours that it was a fundraiser for the Israel Emergency Fund. Folk singer Mimi Farina even picketed his San Francisco concerts.

 The questions ? mostly revolving around what made Dylan take an about-turn ? have never been answered satisfactorily. But what is clear is that the Dylan saga continues, long after he renounced his crown of thorns. The man who hit the headlines in recent months by getting a Grammy and then lending his voice to an advertisement for female underwear is not going to be out of the news for long.

 And Dylan himself tells you why. It?s because, he says, he is no longer there to please anybody.

If I can?t please everybody (he writes)

I might as well not please nobody at all

But

(There?s so many people

And I just can?t please them all)

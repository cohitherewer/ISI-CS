 EQUAL TO ZERO

 - A great diplomatic non-event

 Getting along famously?

Engaging India: Diplomacy, Democracy and the Bomb

By Strobe Talbott, 

Viking, Rs 395

Ever since diplomatic history was banished to the 

boon docks and replaced by something called international relations, the human 

dimensions of foreign policy have become the prerogative of journalism. It is 

from either the instant history that journalism dishes out or from memoirs written 

many years after the event, that we can glean that diplomacy was conducted by 

individuals who added another dimension to lifeless position papers.

 In 1998, barely a month after the first genuine non-Congress prime minister was sworn in, India triggered a nuclear explosion in the Rajasthan desert. Barely a fortnight later, Pakistan resisted Western blandishments to desist from undertaking a copy-cat blast and joined the nuclear club formally.

 For the West, particularly the United States of America, Pokhran II was more than just a colossal intelligence failure. It threatened the entire non-proliferation crusade, a euphemism for the institutionalization of nuclear apartheid, that the Clinton administration had hoped would make the world a safer place.

 India?s daring entry into the five-member N-club was more than an act of brazenness. It contested almost every orientalist stereotype. A stupefied and infuriated US was left with two options: to either kick India into submission or bribe it into voluntary emasculation. The bludgeoning approach, which was to the liking of our Chinese neighbour, was not really practical. You couldn?t after all bomb a democracy into submission. India, for all its faults, was never remotely a rogue regime. Consequently, the Clinton administration was left with no alternative but to engage India diplomatically and, using the sanctions to good effect, pressure the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government to sign the NPT.

 There was no one of any significance in the Clinton administration who wanted to undertake this thankless job. The responsibility finally devolved on Strobe Talbott, one of Madeleine Albright?s many deputies, whose claim to fame was that he was a Friend Of Bill from his Oxford days. Talbott?s expertise was, first, the Soviet Union ? a core competence that was rendered obsolete by history ? and, second, writing cover stories for Time magazine.

 It is fortuitous that Talbott utilized his undeniable competence as a writer to pen an extended journalistic report of his interminable and ultimately fruitless strategic dialogue with Jaswant Singh. Unlike traditional diplomatic histories, Talbott has produced a gripping account of how the UStried to inveigle India into signing on the dotted line and how India prevaricated its way into safety. By the time Clinton bowed out of the White House, the Senate had successfully killed his non-proliferation dream, leaving India the luxury of getting on with life without sanctimonious sermons from a power that had more N-warheads than the number of wickets taken by Shane Warne.

 So, this is a great book about a great diplomatic non-event. Apart from securing lots of air miles for some officials on both sides and enriching a number of Italian restaurants in various agreeable corners of the western hemisphere, the Tabott-Jaswant strategic dialogue produced absolutely nothing. Yet the fact remains that Talbott?s book is among the few detailed accounts of Indian diplomacy, seen from the perspective of someone who was leading the other side. It tells us as much about the Indian approach as it does about the American style. More to the point, it has been written barely four years after the event, much before the events have transited from current affairs to contemporary history.

 For a start, it was a master-stroke on the part of Vajpayee and his foreign policy honcho, Brajesh Mishra, to have deputed Jaswant to keep Uncle Sam at bay. At the best of times, Jaswant is an enigma. Whereas Talbott expected either a paan-chewing Hindu nationalist or a slick diplomat oozing third world angst, he got an Indian Tory paternalist in the William Whitelaw mould. Whether in food habits or style of articulation, Jaswant defied every piece of conventional wisdom. He had the amazing knack of combining charm and military precision with verbal acrobatics. To use an inappropriate cricketing analogy, Jaswant had Talbott both stumped and bowled at the same time.

 Take this as an example: ?During my visit in New Delhi, Jaswant and I made several brief appearances together before the press. I let him do most of the talking, not just because he was the host, but because of his ability to keep the substance of our talks confidential while creating the impression that the two of us were getting along famously. He was a master of public statements that made up in panache what they lacked in content and sometimes even in discernible meaning. Two of my favourites were, ?The totally moral has become the realistically moral? and ?If strategic deterrence is not on the negotiating table, how can you have a missile-development programme on the table?? The journalists dutifully scribbled down these oracular utterances, never asking for clarification or amplification, and then reported them to their readers as though they provided insight into what was going on in the talks.?

 I don?t think it was the stenographers masquerading as journalists who were made complete asses of. In days to come, American scholars will have to determine whether or not Talbott also fell into this category. 

 Jaswant gave the Americans umpteen assurances, including a promise to sign the NPT by a particular date. He strung the Americans along and then offered a gracious apology for his inability to keep his word. Meanwhile, the Indian government counted the minutes before hard-nosed Republican senators would puncture Clinton?s non-proliferation policy and render it meaningless.

 It used to be said that Swaran Singh was the great Indian prevaricator. I think Jaswant did rather well. He upheld Indian interests by pretending to be America?s favourite in the Indian cabinet.

 Talbott?s book must be read by all those who imagine that Indian diplomacy lacks sophistication. It underlines why politicians make better negotiators than journalists. But it is also reveals that journalists can create an enthralling story out of absolutely nothing. This book has more worthwhile anecdotes than any gossip columnist can muster in a whole year. It is a must read for all the political buffs.

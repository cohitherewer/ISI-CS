 IN THE NAME OF WELFARE 

 Neha Sahay

 Mumbai?s journey towards becoming another Shanghai started on a very Chinese note: a slum-dweller set himself on fire after his hut was razed to make way for a parking lot. Chinese who find themselves in similar situations have been using this means of protest. Only here, they do it in Beijing?s Tiananmen Square, the symbol of state power. Their deaths don?t make headlines, as they do in Mumbai. But while in Mumbai nobody bothered to follow up on the ?encroacher?s tragedy?, here, such deaths provoke not just editorials, but even a change in policy. 

 A constitutional amendment stating that, ?Legally obtained private property shall not be violated?, was introduced this year after a spate of protests, some violent, against forced evictions by ?developers?. Five such developers were arrested ? one of them had actually tied up a family before demolishing their home. But two of the most prominent lawyers representing tenants were also jailed.

 Unlike in Mumbai, here, even the wealthy aren?t spared. In Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong, China?s richest province, a villa complex on the banks of the Pearl River was razed to make way for a grand ?university town?. More demolitions are expected as Guangzhou readies itself for the next Asian Games. 

 In Beijing too, those making way for the futuristic new city which will dazzle visitors to the 2008 Olympics are not necessarily poor. Their fault is that they live in the city?s old hutongs, where families occupy separate rooms within the same courtyard. The hutongs now remain as a quaint ?must-see? on the tourist itinerary, to be covered in half-a-day. Old-time Beijingers estimate that 80 per cent of the hutongs have been demolished.

 The disappearance of the hutongs marks the end of an era. It is captured movingly in The Bath, a film revolving around a community bathing house in Beijing. The film ends with the death of the owner, followed by the arrival of the demolition squad. In real life, the sequence of events is reversed. Last year, a hutong resident protesting against demolition jumped off a bridge in full view of thousands of revellers on October 1, National Day, the anniversary of the founding of the People?s Republic of China.

 Behind the gloss

 Responding to Western criticism at the wiping out of Beijing?s historic cultural symbols, the government has, publicly at least, declared a stop to further demolitions of hutongs. But no such armour shields the villages where small fields are being turned into expressways, factories, golf courses, exhibition venues, or worse, high-rise apartments which remain unoccupied.

 The new glittering cities that make up the special economic zones of the south were all fishing villages in 1980. Their transformation wasn?t all blood and gore. Most of the farmers, whose produce was then controlled by the state, were only too glad to sell off their land. Some of them received so much compensation that they are still living off it, spending their days playing mahjong and drinking in bars. 

 In India, governments in league with builders play havoc with the homes of the poor. In China, the situation is more complex, but the end result is the same. All urban land belongs to the state, and rural land to rural collectives. Residents are given ?land use rights? for long periods, which can only be taken away for welfare projects. But local governments take the land back and sell it to ?developers?.

 In a long piece entitled, ?Respect for residents? rights?, the state-run China Daily had a new take on this human-rights issue; it bemoaned the ?forcible relocation? that causes the ?consumption line to break down by depriving chances for poorer citizens?. ?A fair society should always prioritize the protection of property rights,? it concluded.

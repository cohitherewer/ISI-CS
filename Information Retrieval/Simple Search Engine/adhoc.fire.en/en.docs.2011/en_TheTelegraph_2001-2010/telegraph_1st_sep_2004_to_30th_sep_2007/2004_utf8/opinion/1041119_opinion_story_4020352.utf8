 CHANGE OF TUNE

 Only the most obstinate of politicians will refuse to read this writing on the wall. The unequivocal public rejection of Wednesday?s Bangla bandh call may well be a turning point in the state?s politics. Never before did such a wide cross-section of the people refuse to be cowed down by the diktat of a political party. It had little to do with the relatively small support for the Socialist Unity Centre of India which had called the bandh. The public disapproval, which bordered on anger, was directed at a culture that has crippled Bengal?s economy and stigmatized its politics for decades. The signal is loud and clear for all parties, including the original sinner, the Communist Party of India (Marxist). It cannot afford to pat itself on the back because it opposed this bandh and will oppose the two others called by a Naxalite group and the Trinamool Congress in the next two weeks. Ironically, the warning for the Marxists has come from none other than its minister in the state government, Mr Subhas Chakraborty. He warned that time may have finally come when the people would ?bash up? irresponsible politicians, including those of his own party, who held their lives to ransom by calling bandhs. As the worst perpetrator of this abuse of political rights, the CPI(M) must mend its ways first. 

 The other important message came from the judiciary. It is understandable why the Calcutta high court intervened to protect the people?s right to move freely and attend work on a bandh day. Its directive to the state government to deduct a day?s wages from the absenting employees cannot be seen as an interference in the executive?s functions. Instead, it should be seen as the judiciary?s effort to make the government work by the rule book. The failure of a government to punish such errant employees amounts to its complicity with the sponsors of bandhs. By raising its voice against bandhs, the court actually acted on guidelines set by the Supreme Court which had earlier held them to be unlawful and unconstitutional. But the issues raised by the Calcutta high court go beyond the obligations of the state government. It has also raised a fundamental question as to whether the recognition of a political party can be withheld if it violates the Supreme Court?s directive against bandhs. Politicians of all hues must heed the warning or face increasing public ire.

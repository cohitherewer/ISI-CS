 GOODBYE, GALLIWASP!

 The Vietnamese warty pig and Fernandina rice rat are back from the dead. They have been spotted again, after being written off as extinct in the mid-Nineties. But this has not been the fate of the St Helena olive, Sao Tome free-tailed bat and Giant Hispaniolan galliwasp. The last St Helena olive plant died in 2003. The free-tailed bat and galliwasp are both critically endangered ? the bat by tourism and agriculture, while the galliwasp has lost its habitat to crops and pastures, and some have been killed by people, dogs, cats and mongooses. All these creatures, lost or restored, are agents as well as victims in the global drama of the extinction of species, which is both a natural process and a crisis. It is more a crisis today because the rapid loss of species that the earth is witnessing now is estimated to be between 100 and 1,000 times higher than the expected natural rate of extinction. 

 The World Conservation Union?s annual Red List of endangered species is out. It lists 15,589 species as threatened with extinction. One in every four mammals and one in every eight birds are facing a high risk of extinction in the near future, together with one in three amphibians and almost half of all tortoises and freshwater turtles. And the report also makes it clear that things have come to this primarily because of human beings. Habitat loss because of agriculture and tourism, over-exploitation through hunting and fishing, pollution and global climate-change are the various ways in which human beings can threaten or kill off plants and animals forever. The 2004 report also shows that threatened species are mostly concentrated in densely populated areas. These areas are usually in countries with a low gross national income per capita ? like Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Peru and the Philippines ? which are unable to implement the required conservation measures without international assistance.

 These countries will have to realize that the conservation of threatened species is not a question of ?being kind? to animals and plants ? or not just that. Biodiversity is crucial to human survival. The precarious balance between different ecosystems keeps the planet habitable, and concerted human action alone can prevent many species from becoming extinct. And this is not simply about President Bush signing the Kyoto Protocol or Queen Noor saying no to pashmina shawls. Intensive and locally adapted community action must continue to play an important role in conservation, apart from ?re-introductions? or maintaining protected areas. Farmers on the Yangtze must realize that the critically endangered Chinese alligator is important, though indirectly, for their livelihood, or Indians understand that if vultures die feeding on dead animals treated with Diclofenac, then natural scavenging will be hampered, making dogs fill that void and spread rabies among human beings. Nature is a complicated system. By putting himself at the centre of it, man is taking on a complicated responsibility.

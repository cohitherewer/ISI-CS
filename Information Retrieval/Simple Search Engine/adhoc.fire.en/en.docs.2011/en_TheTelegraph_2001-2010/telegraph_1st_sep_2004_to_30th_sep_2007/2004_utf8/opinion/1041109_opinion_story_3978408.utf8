 Letters to Editor

 Together we die

 Sir ? Ever since Shibendu Saha killed himself and six members of his family, there have been quite a few instances of entire families being wiped out by committing suicide collectively. Usually a letter, written by the person whose problems may have led to the tragedy, is cited by the police as indisputable proof of collective suicide. But is it impossible for a person to write such a letter under an external threat to his life? We already know from our social history books that few of the satis of 18th-century India voluntarily accompanied their dead husbands to the pyre. Isn?t it hard to believe then that modern, educated, urban women of the 21st century are hanging themselves to express solidarity with their husbands who have fallen into debt traps? It is equally unbelievable that the women would rather commit suicide than try to help their partners in tiding out of the hard times.

 Yours faithfully,

Sanjoy Ghose, Calcutta

 Fear of flying

 Sir ? My wife and I flew British Airways from Delhi to London and also from London to Calcutta. But we were very disappointed with the flight from London to Calcutta.

 For one, the flight was much delayed. The ground staff could not provide any reason for the delay, or tell us when the flight was rescheduled. When I went back to the counter after some time, I found everyone had disappeared. When I went for a third time, there were two people who said that they did not know the exact time of departure of this flight. I told them that the passengers of the delayed flight should be served coffee and some snacks and also be allowed to do some duty-free shopping. We were told that we must wait where we were. 

 Second, on board the aircraft, I was greeted with very casual service, far from what we received on the flight from Delhi to London. When I wanted my jacket which I had asked to be kept in the closet, the hostess told me curtly that she was very busy and could only attend to my request when she finished her work. I was not prepared for such rudeness.

 The quality of the food served was poor, particularly the morning snack before landing.

 The impression I gained was that there being no major airline operating in the London-Calcutta sector to give British Airways tough competition, it does not much care for the comfort of passengers. On the other hand, in the Delhi-London sector, where it faces more competition, passengers receive better service. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? I am extremely disturbed at the harassment my children, Jahnabi Chakravarty and Abhishek Chakravarty, were subjected to by Jet Airways officials at the Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Airport in Calcutta on October16.

 Jet Airways requires its passengers to check in an hour before the departure time. Accordingly, my children, holding ?OK? tickets, reported an hour before the scheduled time at the Jet Airways counter at the airport. It was there that they were informed that since their tickets were purchased using the Apex scheme, they could not board the flight. Both being minors, they were frightfully confused. They were asked to wait, and the supervisor, one Debashis Das, was called to resolve the matter. He informed them that the flight was overbooked and there was only a remote possibility of their boarding the flight. This was shocking to the children, and they broke down. Their mother would be waiting to receive them.

 They were told to remain in the waiting area, while the officials went to see if they could find seats for the two confirmed ticket-holders. There were a few others there who had been victimized similarly. The children went back to the supervisor?s office and tried to explain to him that they had to catch a connecting flight from Mumbai to Ahmedabad the same day, and on no account could they miss that. He refused to listen, though. People were already beginning to queue up for boarding. By this time it had become obvious that the children were not getting on that flight. Another girl, also forced to wait, had contacted her travel agent who, after speaking to the Jet Airways head office, informed her that the flight was overbooked and some people needed to be offloaded. It turned out that those people were all minors, and all carrying apex tickets.

 The children then tried to find out if they could get seats on a later flight. They were informed that they could, but only after paying the balance amount.

 While this was happening in Calcutta, my wife was waiting at Ahmedabad airport. When her children failed to turn up, she had a nervous breakdown and had to be taken to the hospital. Not to mention that our entire travel plan was upset, causing me a loss in business to the tune of Rs 10 crore.

 It is important that more people know what callousness Jet Airways is capable of.

 Yours faithfully,

Aniruddha Chakravarty, Calcutta

 Babu culture

 Sir ? ?Bengal starved of IAS babus? (Nov 2) puts the position of our home-bred WBCS vis-?-vis the IAS in proper perspective. WBCS officers, especially in the districts, think themselves on a par with, if not superior to, their IAS bosses. The state government too has done its bit to give the impression that they are a notch higher than the other specialized group ?A? cadre services like West Bengal Audit and Accounts Service or Cooperative Service. Now, with foreign donors demanding that IAS officers be at the helm of projects funded by them, the myth may finally be broken. Not that it will make our WBCS babus take a fresh look at their lot. But will the state government please see reason, and put the WBCS on a par with other group ?A? cadre services? 

 Yours faithfully,

Chameli Pal, Batanagar

 Paperback Pickings

 Madge, Descartes and Hobbes

Mad Madge (Rupa, ?5.20) by Katie 

Whitaker combines solid research and readability to present the story of Margaret 

Cavendish ? the duchess of Newcastle, royalist, writer and romantic. In Whitaker?s 

account, modern readers will find a woman at once sophisticated and multifaceted, 

canny and audacious, the possessor of both ?considerable intellect and intrepid 

originality?. She was also a versatile writer of poetry, prose and drama. Born 

in 1623, Margaret Lucas went into Court service, accompanying the Queen during 

the Civil War and sharing her escape to France in 1644. She married William Cavendish, 

Marquis of New Castle, and together they became part of the ?migr? royalist circle 

that included aristocrats and the intellectual giants of the day, like Descartes 

and Hobbes. This is one of the illustrated frontispieces which Margaret created 

for her books in Antwerp, in which she appears in a classically heroic mode, flanked 

by Minerva and Apollo, patrons of learning and the arts.

The ordinary princess (Puffin, Rs 150) by 

M.M. Kaye is about the Princess Amethyst of Phantasmorania, who is given a 

rather unfairytale-like blessing by the Fairy Crustacea: ?I am going to give you 

something that will bring you more happiness than all these fal-lals and fripperies 

put together. You shall be Ordinary!? Born in India, and having travelled 

with her soldier husband to Kenya, Zanzibar and Egypt, M.M. Kaye should know all 

about Phantasmorania. This is the same Kaye who wrote The Far Pavilions 

and Shadow of the Moon.

Carnatic summer (EastWest, Rs 295) by Sriram V. looks at the lives of a select group of twenty top-ranking Carnatic musicians. A colourful lot, much has been written about their art and the way they presented it. But very little has been written about their lives and their lifestyles, which must have had a significant bearing on their art. All of them were powerful personalities in their own right. Among others, and apart from M.S. Subbulakshmi, there are Ariyakkudi T. Ramanuja Iyengar, Chembai Vaidyanatha Bhagavatar, Madurai Mani Iyer, the Alathoor brothers, Kumbhakonam Rajamanikkam Pillai, Palani Subramania Pillai and Semmangudi R. Srinivasa Iyer. The music of great names.

 OIL SLICK

 Standing for the welfare of the underprivileged is a very noble cause and those that uphold it consistently deserve society?s respect. The important word in the previous sentence is consistent. This is the test that the established left parties fail. The left?s disapproval of the government?s decision to raise the prices of petroleum products is evidence of this failure. By no stretch of the imagination can it be argued that liquefied petroleum gas, petrol and diesel ? commodities whose prices have been raised ? are articles that are frequently used by the people who are really poor in India. For those who live under the poverty line in India, petroleum products are akin to luxury items. By protesting against the rise in prices of petroleum products, the left has revealed that its concerns are focussed on the urban middle and lower middle classes. These social groups by no means represent India?s poor and underprivileged. The left?s protest is a sign of its own confusion about the nature of Indian society. The protests of the Bharatiya Janata Party smack of tokenism and opportunism since the chances are that if it were in power, it would not have hesitated to raise the prices of petroleum products in keeping with global price trends.

 It is worth noting that global prices have doubled. Much of this rise has been absorbed by the government and the oil companies since in India, prices of petroleum products have gone up only by about 50 per cent. It is unavoidable that some of this rise should pass on to the consumer. The government?s decision is a step in that direction. For the government, it has not been an easy decision to take, for it was predictable that the price rise would not be popular. The government took the plunge, and as the subsequent statements of the prime minister, Mr Manmohan Singh, suggest, the government has no intentions of rolling back the price hike.

 The government is responding to global market prices, but this response is still inadequate. It is yet to establish a body of rules which will regulate the activities of the oil sector. There was a decision taken in 1997 that over a five-year period, administered pricing of petroleum products would come to an end. The decision is now in limbo: nobody quite knows its fate. This failure of implementation is a function of a hangover ? a hangover produced by the heady mixture of socialism and populism. There are no logical reasons for the government to be involved in pricing. Oil should also be divorced from politics and made completely open to competition and global economic trends. Only this can fulfil the promise of liberalization that Mr Singh made to the nation in his avatar as finance minister more than a decade ago.

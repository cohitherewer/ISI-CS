 NO EASY PATH

 The determination of India and Pakistan to sustain the composite dialogue will be welcomed. Although the differences between New Delhi and Islamabad were evident during the visit of Pakistan?s prime minister, Mr Shaukat Aziz, there is clearly a new willingness on both sides to not let the bilateral talks get derailed again. This is a heartening development, given the history of the relationship over the last 57 years. Moreover, important progress seems to have been made towards introducing further confidence-building measures. 

 New Delhi and Islamabad seem committed to starting the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad and Jammu-Sialkot bus services. It is believed that the modalities would be worked out during the official-level talks in early December. Differences that existed about the travel documents to be used by the passengers of the bus services seem to have been narrowed down. Significantly, the two countries have agreed to establish banking relations. This should dramatically improve trade in goods and services between them. The two sides have also discussed a number of proposals to push the SAARC process forward, including the proposal of setting up a ?high economic council?, which would include the finance and commerce ministers from the member states. There seems to be a growing understanding that the pipeline from Iran to India through Pakistan would be to the advantage of both India and Pakistan. The latter has made it clear that it will go ahead with this transnational project whether India joins it or not. New Delhi?s earlier reluctance seems to have softened since the new Congress-led government took office. 

 This progress should not, of course, suggest that the path of normalization is going to be easy. There is a long way to go before India-Pakistan relations can be described as really stable. The challenge will be in discussions over Jammu and Kashmir. It is here that both sides have strident positions and national passions are involved. This has been obvious over the past few weeks. Pakistan reacted strongly to Mr Manmohan Singh?s assertion, in Srinagar, that there can be no redrawing of lines between the two states, and that a second partition of the country is not acceptable to India. Earlier, New Delhi had found it surprising that Mr Musharraf should suggest proposals for resolving Kashmir at a party in Islamabad. The obvious lesson is that both sides need to ensure that they do not carry on diplomacy through the media. Discretion is a clear need, even as both sides may seek to explore options that have not been thoroughly scrutinized in the past. It must, however, be clear that there can be no quick fix, no easy formula to resolve the complex issues that divide India and Pakistan. Sustained engagement alone provides the answer.

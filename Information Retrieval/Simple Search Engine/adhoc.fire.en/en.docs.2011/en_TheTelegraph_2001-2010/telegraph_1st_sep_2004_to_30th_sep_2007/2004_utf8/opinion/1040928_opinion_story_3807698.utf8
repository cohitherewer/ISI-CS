 HOW TO GO ON AND ON

 Malvika Singh

 And the left goes on and on with the same predictable refrain. It is behaving as if it is the leading member of the ruling coalition, as if this is its god-given last chance to shout out its rhetoric, which has hardly been heard over the last few decades. The left is fast becoming a laughing stock, trying to usurp spaces that are not within its jurisdiction. Its arrogant manner when speaking about how it will compel the government to do x, y and z is beginning to smack of blackmail. This neither brings it any respect nor does it give its sloganeering any credence.

 The leftists are not the only ones whose hearts and souls bleed for India, there are many who believe that the real problems of this country have been neglected and exploited by all political parties and that the time has come to rectify this horror. The only saviours are not the CPs. There are others too, including the Manmohan Singh-led government.

 The Planning Commission nautanki concluded in an anticlimax, revealing the democratic intolerance of extremism. Extremism of any ideological type, left or right, is detrimental to growth. It leads to divisiveness in a society that is intrinsically liberal in mind, one that encompasses divergent opinions and attitudes. This is one of the reasons why the static left and the stubborn nationalist right have remained marginal to the national political scheme. Jyoti Basu talks about ?foreigners?. But it was not long ago that the CPI(M) was inextricably tied to a ?foreign? communist party, as was the CPI. 

 Why are these men and women running scared of dialogue and discourse? Why do they fear a debate with those who oppose their stances? Why are they so insecure about who is foreign and who is not? 

 Last ditch

 Delhi is abuzz with many rumours. One such talks about how the venerable, aged sardarji of the CPI(M) is in cahoots with another high-profile political party, hoping to pull the rug from under this government in an attempt to put together a ?third front?, with a split Congress led by Pranab Mukherjee replacing Manmohan Singh. Well, not really feasible at all because the Congress is not about to split away from Sonia Gandhi, and definitely not for Pranab Mukherjee. If the wily CPI(M) sardar thinks he will have Manmohan replaced by Pranab with a bit of blackmail, he is mistaken. Dignity in politics is the new mantra and that is what new India wants. Oldies, your days are numbered, and somewhere you know this, which is why this ?last ditch attempt?.

 We deserve better

 It is so unpleasant to see these strange players on the political stage, people who stall and prevent, who haven?t delivered the goods themselves, who exploit ?poverty? in their rhetoric and who have only ?manipulation? to show as their skill. The old-time political manipulators across the board stand exposed in the public domain. Varying forms of blackmail have entered the scene. And the characters are the same, those same die-hard chaps who have always been destructive in playing this game. They are known only for their underhand manipulation, not for having improved the lives of their constituents.

 Jyoti Basu?s public comment on television about Montek Ahluwalia ? ?He belongs to the World Bank? ? was unwarranted and in bad taste. One never expected a suave and sophisticated national political stalwart to descend to this level, the same level as Yashwant Sinha when he referred to Manmohan Singh as a shikhandi. There really is no difference in the games played by the two extremes. Maybe the left should topple the government and join hands with the BJP. How about that? Surely the Indian people deserve better, dignified human beings as their leaders.

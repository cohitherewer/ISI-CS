 WINNING TREND

 The trend that was prominent in the general elections earlier in the year has been confirmed by the assembly elections in Maharashtra. The victory of the Congress alliance was by no means narrow as most pollsters had predicted. The spin doctors within the Bharatiya Janata Party will have to wake up to two very clear facts. One, the rejection of the BJP by the electorate is undeniable. Two, Ms Sonia Gandhi cannot be written off as a leader of no consequence who can be defeated by a campaign that targets her foreign origins. Before any other implication of the Maharashtra electoral verdict is worked out, it must be acknowledged that the vote is an unequivocal acceptance of Ms Gandhi and her leadership. If the victory belongs to anybody, it belongs to her. Last Sunday, at an election, the prime minister, Mr Manmohan Singh, asked the electorate to vote to strengthen the hands of Ms Gandhi. The electorate of Maharashtra has done precisely that. This victory will serve as a boost to Mr Singh?s government in New Delhi and give to it a measure of stability and confidence. The BJP leadership has to accept the political reality that, astrological predictions notwithstanding, here is a government to stay and perform.

 The inner dynamics of the voting illustrates the strength of alliance politics. The Congress-Nationalist Congress Party alliance ensured that the anti-BJP votes did not get split. Or to put it in another way, the existence of the alliance guaranteed that the Congress votes fell into one basket. The alliance served as an umbrella which drew under it various political formations, all sharing a common viewpoint despite minor differences. The model is similar to the one perfected by the left in West Bengal. The success of the model when applied in the correct political context is as foolproof as anything can be in politics. Ms Gandhi led an ideological campaign against the BJP-Shiv Sena combination, but the campaign was underpinned by very solid political arithmetic. It can be argued that the election results have somewhat upset the power equations within the Congress-NCP coalition. Mr Sharad Pawar, given the fact that his party has emerged as the single largest one, will obviously demand a bigger share of the power cake in Maharashtra and perhaps even in New Delhi. This is a matter of adjustment which is par for the course in any coalition politics. Such negotiations should not be allowed to blur the overall significance of the results for Ms Gandhi, the Congress and the country.

 FULL OF DOUBT

 The most important things in life are never in black or white. The grey areas in between are invariably the crucial ones. Unfortunately, no census questionnaire can quite record facts that are by definition somewhat ambiguous. This qualification needs to be kept in mind while looking at the figure for the number of people in West Bengal who do not believe in god or religion. The total number of such people is 54,000. This appears to be ridiculously low even though it has risen by 50,000 in the last two decades. It is difficult to accept such a low figure for a state where 250,000 persons are cardholding members of the Communist Party of India (Marxist). Most communists are by definition atheists and there are atheists who are not communists. Hence, the serious question mark over the figure of 54,000. The problem probably lies in the nature of the enquiry itself. Census operations seldom have any space for complexities and ambiguities. The questions in a census operation are designed to produce a yes or no answer. But there can be situations in which people for a variety of reasons may not be able to say a straightforward aye or no to a question like ?Do you believe in god?? or ?Are you an atheist?? There can be people who may not be willing to declare themselves atheists or completely deny their belief in god. Such people live with their doubts and are not practitioners of any given religion. Conversely, there are people who go through the rituals of religious practice as part of a social convention but are not confirmed believers in god.

 Agnostics are thus never part of the census figures that record the number of atheists in society. It is important to emphasize that, in philosophical terms, atheism is a position entrenched in certainty. It leaves no scope for doubt. To that extent, however paradoxical this might sound, atheism is contrary to the most fundamental premise of rationalism, doubt. The failure of census operations in this regard is very significant. A census is an attempt on the part of the state to classify its citizens. An atheist is as easily typecast as a believer, but an agnostic defies classification. An agnostic cannot answer yes or no to the question ?Do you believe in god?? The moral of the story is that census figures can never mirror beliefs and attitudes in society. A mind, according to a famous detective in fiction, is composed of grey cells.

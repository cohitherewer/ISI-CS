 BRIEF PLEASURES

 Is it possible to be quick and cool without appearing to be unlettered? This is the modern question posed by the ubiquitous SMS ? although vast swathes of messaging humanity remain blissfully untroubled by it. Yet seeds of anxiety are beginning to be planted here and there. In schools, among booksellers, and even in the corporate world, the drastic and seemingly unstoppable abbreviation of linguistic exchange is being seen as an alarming form of mass lobotomy that not only degrades the English language but also rots the brain. ?Texting? demands that everything has to be said within 160 characters. But haters of SMS-speak see this brevity as the soul of dim-wittedness. A British secondary-school English teacher was shocked recently when a 13-year-old pupil handed in an entire essay written SMS-style. Singapore runs public campaigns to purify the English spoken by its business community of both SMS lingo and ?Singlish?, a hybrid of English, Chinese, Malay and Indian languages. Yet, the French thought that the best way to tell youngsters about the dangers of smoking was to write a novel about it purely in ?text?.

 The problem is when people lose their powers of discrimination. It is perfectly logical to write brief, functional messages on the phone, and it is even possible to pack in excitement or profundity in these bits of text. But to use the same shorthand in other forms of formal communication, and to do this habitually, are certainly a failure of intelligence. Yet, to conclude from this that the English language is being turned nasty, short and brutish might be a trifle excessive. After all, the English language has weathered all kinds of corruption and has, almost always, emerged the richer from it.

 Making love and making money are both founded on the manipulation of human language. The forms of linguistic exchange that sustain commerce are undoubtedly enhanced by SMS. But the link between romance and SMS or email is more double-edged. A recent survey in India indicates that more women than men prefer to use SMS, and that 45 per cent of the respondents would rather flirt in ?text? than in person. The unique mix of quickness, immediacy and relative anonymity offered by SMS ? as, in other ways, by email and chatting ? has certainly changed the pace and intensity of amorous interactions in the contemporary world. It has also opened up newer possibilities of deception, irresponsibility and abuse. Yet love and lust have always existed at the limits of what can be expressed in words. But they have also inspired extraordinary feats of articulacy in the most ordinary human beings. 

 Courtship and seduction are essentially civilized activities because of their basis in pleasure, style and wit. It would be a pity if the postmodern style galante had to submit to the tyranny of those 160 characters.

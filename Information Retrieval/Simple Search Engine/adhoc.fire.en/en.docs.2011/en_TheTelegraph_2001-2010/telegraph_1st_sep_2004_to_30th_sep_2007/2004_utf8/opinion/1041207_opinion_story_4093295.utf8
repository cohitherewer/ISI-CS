 EARNING TRUST

 Ethnic politics is primarily a quest for identity. It is understandable, therefore, why Mr Thuingaleng Muivah, general secretary of the National Socialist Council of Nagalim, wants ?the uniqueness of the history of the Naga people? to be the basis of its peace negotiations with New Delhi. This is actually at the heart of India?s longest ethnic insurgency. To the rebels, territorial and other issues are relevant only insofar as they help in giving the Nagas the identity they want for themselves. The problem, however, lies in differing perceptions of what the Nagas can or should get in order to have this identity. The biggest difficulty relates to the demand for integration of all Naga-inhabited areas with a Greater Nagaland. Many of these areas being in Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh, a redrawing of the boundaries of these states may well be seen as an assault on the people?s ideas of their territorial identities. That this is always a possibility was proved by the violent protests in Imphal two years ago against New Delhi?s tentative response to the Naga demand. It should be good news that Mr Muivah and the NSCN chairman, Mr Isak Chisi Swu, have now arrived in India to resume the peace talks. Until recently, a cloud hung over their passage to India and over the peace process. 

 From New Delhi?s point of view, however, the crux lies in striking a balance between the Nagas? aspirations and questions of national security and sovereignty. Since the Nagas too want some form of ?sovereignty? for themselves, it may not be easy to find solutions strictly within the framework of the Indian Constitution. There is no reason to assume that Messrs Muivah and Swu are unaware of the complexity of the issues. The important thing, as rightly suggested by New Delhi?s interlocutor, Mr K. Padmanabhaiah, is to ?narrow down? the differences in the two sides? perceptions. The Naga leaders cannot, however, expect New Delhi to do anything that could compromise the country?s security. No country would put its security on the negotiating table. The heartening thing about the peace process so far is that the Naga leaders too seem to have accepted this. In fact, the country?s security is absolutely essential for the success of any peace formula for Nagaland. A permanent peace in Nagaland may still be some distance away. The crucial thing is that the two sides seem to have earned each other?s trust.

 GRANDFATHER TO THE RESCUE 

 Taxpayers may rest easy since the 

 Kelkar task force reverses some of the Kelkar committees 

 proposals on exemptions, writes S. Venkitaramanan 

 Convincing arithmetic 

 The recommendations of the Kelkar 

 task force on direct taxes follow the path set out in the 

 proposals made by the Kelkar committee last year. They centre 

 around the removal of exemptions so as to widen the tax 

 base and seek to improve compliance by introducing information 

 technology into the direct tax assessment and collection 

 mechanism. The recommendations also involve changes in the 

 treatment of depreciation. The proposals for containing 

 expenditure revisit some of the perennials of the subject, 

 such as enabling better audit of outcomes, cutting subsidies 

 and reducing Centrally-sponsored schemes. 

 With regard to the removal of 

 exemptions, the Kelkar task force is an improvement on the 

 Kelkar committee. The main criticism of Kelkars earlier 

 proposals on exemptions was that tax-payers, who had made 

 certain investments in the expectation of getting income-tax 

 concessions, may feel a legitimate sense of grievance if 

 these exemptions were suddenly withdrawn. The Kelkar task 

 force takes into account this argument by introducing the 

 concept of grandfathering such exemptions. These grandfathered 

 exemptions will entitle the assessee to profit from them 

 even after they are removed, provided he has acted on them 

 before the removal. 

 Particularly relevant is the task 

 forces proposal with regard to savings instruments. It 

 proposes the removal of a number of exemptions with regard 

 to savings, especially section 88. So also, it proposes 

 removing exemption on interest income under sections 10 

 (10D), 10 (11), 10 (12) and 10 (13). The Kelkar task force, 

 however, proposes that these exemptions be grandfathered. 

 Similarly, exemptions under Section 80 (CC) are also to 

 be removed. Contributors to existing accounts of the public 

 provident fund will, similarly, continue to enjoy the benefits 

 of exemptions on outstanding amounts while new contributions 

 will cease to enjoy the exemptions.

 While grandfathering may be a 

 good idea in the United States of America, I wonder how 

 it will fare with litigation-minded tax-payers in India. 

 It is quite likely that a litigant will file a writ alleging 

 discrimination in favour of those entitled to exemption 

 under grandfathering, while some others are left out. The 

 lawyers and courts will have a field day. Hopefully, the 

 Kelkar task force has done its homework well in making this 

 recommendation.

 The task force has proposed a 

 new scheme for pension-contribution called the industrial 

 savings account. This seems to be based on the individual 

 retirement accounts in the US. Contributions to the ISA 

 will be exempt at the time of paying, and so will the accumulations. 

 It will, however, be taxed at the time of withdrawal. All 

 withdrawals from the ISA will be subject to a tax-deducted-at-source 

 rate of 20 per cent a rate which seems to be high considering 

 the average income levels of likely contributors, who are 

 restricted to a maximum contribution of Rs 1 lakh a year. 

 How far this scheme will be popular depends on details like 

 what interest the ISA contributions will earn. Whether individuals 

 will be entitled to assign contributions to particular mutual 

 funds is also not clear. 

 It is with respect to corporate 

 tax that the Kelkar task force makes radical proposals. 

 It proposes a reduction in the depreciation rate from the 

 current 25 per cent to 15 per cent, while at the same time 

 marginally reducing the corporate tax rate to 30 per cent. 

 It proceeds to show, by an elaborate set of calculations, 

 that assuming a benign inflation and application of value-added 

 tax on capital goods, the extant rate of 10 per cent depreciation 

 results in an accumulation of a depreciation reserve which 

 will be higher than the original cost of capital equipment. 

 This is, in the task forces view, an avoidable loss to 

 the fisc. 

 The Kelkar task forces arithmetic 

 is convincing. Whether the assumptions on which it is based 

 will hold for all time is not clear, especially the inflation 

 factor. A fairer method would be to compare our depreciation 

 rates with what are allowed in comparable economies with 

 which we wish to compete to attract investments. It is well-known 

 that many developed countries practise liberal depreciation 

 and investment allowances. The real touchstone of comparison 

 with regard to depreciation allowances will be the effective 

 depreciation rate in force in China and south-east Asia, 

 apart from countries in Europe. 

 Progressive income-tax regimes 

 have recognized that depreciation allowances form a source 

 of internal resources for corporates the largest source 

 for capital in many economies. It is regrettable that the 

 Kelkar task force ignores this aspect.

 Further, the task force suggests 

 that exemptions and special treatments for backward areas 

 be removed and substituted with direct grants. While, in 

 principle, this is a commendable idea, it takes away the 

 attractiveness of investment in backward regions. To substitute 

 these with straightforward budgetary grants will mean bringing 

 in the uncertainties of government control of procurement, 

 and all that it implies. 

 Turning to the containment of 

 expenditure, the Kelkar task force makes some valuable suggestions. 

 But, these are essentially a restatement of earlier recommendations 

 by other expert bodies. The idea was found attractive but 

 difficult to implement, given the dominance of vested interests, 

 both political and bureaucratic, in retaining Central control 

 over local initiatives. 

 A well-meaning suggestion of the 

 Kelkar task force is to entrust the comptroller and auditor 

 generals office with the expanded scope of audit of outcomes, 

 instead of merely confining it to expenditure and revenue. 

 While the suggestion is, no doubt, well-intentioned, it 

 may end up by masking the CAGs main purpose of audit of 

 appropriations and expenditure. The audit of outcomes is, 

 more appropriately, the province of evaluation specialists, 

 who know the field being investigated. It would be far better 

 to strengthen the machinery of independent evaluation, with 

 experts who are technically qualified to assess the outcomes 

 in the field. Perhaps a representative of the CAG may be 

 included in the evaluation team. 

 Montek Singh Ahluwalia has had 

 a lot of experience running an independent evaluation outfit 

 while he was in the International Monetary Fund. He could 

 get suitable evaluation agencies installed for assessing 

 outcomes of public expenditure initiatives. He could revive 

 and reinvigorate the existing Programme Evaluation Agency 

 at Yojana Bhavan, besides triggering and incentivizing similar 

 efforts in the states.

 Overall, the Kelkar task forces 

 report is a thought-provoking exercise. But the government 

 must solicit the views of the public on the far-reaching 

 proposals in the report before embarking on final decisions. 

 This would also be in keeping with the tradition of transparency, 

 which has characterized the finance ministrys approach 

 since the commencement of reforms. There is time enough 

 for P. Chidambaram to embark on this exercise before he 

 finalizes his next budget.

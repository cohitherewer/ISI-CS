 LEFT TO DIE

 Very few people in West Bengal know how to deal with cardiac arrest. And this includes a shamefully large number of doctors, nurses and paramedical staff. It is an ugly fact that ought to be publicly acknowledged, especially after the death of Cristiano de lima Junior. The footballer might have lived had Indians been properly trained in certain vital civic and practical matters. The solution is actually devastatingly simple. It just requires a few minutes of basic training in cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Trying to revive the heart and lungs after cardiac arrest requires no specialized medical expertise. Anybody can be taught to do it, thereby immensely increasing the chances of surviving the arrest. Since any human being might find himself in such an emergency, there is no reason why it should not be part of everybody?s compulsory education. CPR-training is perhaps as basic to civilized and healthy social existence as being toilet-trained. Hence, providing such basic education ought to be an essential responsibility of the civic authorities in any society. Valuing the life of others should follow from valuing one?s own life. This is as much a question of specifically trained reflexes as of ethics and law. 

 At a more concrete level, not only hospitals, nursing homes and medical colleges, but also schools, colleges, universities, corporate houses, building societies, civic bodies and a wide range of other public institutions can quite easily make training and awareness regarding CPR part of their essential activities. Sporting teams, associations and venues will, of course, be of particular importance here. An immeasurably foolish callousness regarding life-saving regulations characterizes modern Indian society. National attitudes to fire regulations, crash helmets and seat-belts remain glaring examples of this. Securely helmeted parents lovingly carry their unprotected offspring on motorcycles, often in front of the driver. Seat-belts are purely cosmetic strips of black ribbon pulled on by drivers to deceive policemen. All along Park Street in Calcutta, the pedestrian lights remain dangerously uncoordinated with the traffic lights. All this in a state where the health sector is in a shambles, and pollution control has been declared impossible by the government. It is no point trying to persuade people to put their money in a state that is brutally indifferent to keeping them alive.

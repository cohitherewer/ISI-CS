 OTHER?S PRIDE

 Belonging is always a dicey business. Vijai Singh, who has just emerged as the world?s number one golfer, in legal terms does not belong to India. He is a native of Fiji. But belonging cannot be defined by the possession of a passport. In a far more profound way ? in the way perhaps his and his forefathers? DNA has been processed and structured ? there is a sense of belonging to India. In Vijai Singh?s genealogy, there is the story of a migration. Groups of people in the 19th century from various parts of India moved to different parts of the world to create the Indian diaspora. Vijai Singh belongs to that scattering of the Indian population. But the Indian origins of Vijai Singh contain a moral which is not exactly complimentary for India. It could be argued that Vijai Singh is at the top of his chosen calling precisely because he and his forefathers moved away from India. India is the graveyard of talent of all kinds. Both Amartya Sen and S. Chandrasekhar who were awarded the Nobel Prize did most of their work outside India. It is easy to recall other physicists and economists, as talented as Sen and Chandrasekhar, who never quite made the grade. The fact that Vijai Singh teed off from Fiji and not from India is one of the reasons for his success.

 The factors that explain this peculiar paradox need to be investigated. In any field ? from sports to scholarship ? the facilities that are available abroad are infinitely superior to the best in India. Libraries, laboratories, gyms and training facilities are better not only in advanced countries in the West like the United States of America but even in the smaller but affluent countries of south-east Asia. The lack of success is also related to a very pronounced character trait of Indians. Indians are stricken by envy and a complete inability to appreciate the success and superiority of another Indian. Therefore, a successful Indian has a proliferation of detractors who pull him down. Witness the kind of criticism that the film actress Nargis Dutt made of Satyajit Ray. These factors are compounded by the absence of challenges and competition. Indian achievers fall prey to complacency.

 Mother India has very little to be proud of these days especially in the world of sports. She could feed vicariously on the success of men like Vijai Singh who are her sons but once removed. Those who worship Mother India and are gung-ho at the slightest pretext have good reasons for introspection. The triumphs of persons of Indian origin do not bring laurels to the country but they do point to what is being missed and why. Indians love to come in on success because it is so rare, but they often forget that they are partially responsible for the scarcity.

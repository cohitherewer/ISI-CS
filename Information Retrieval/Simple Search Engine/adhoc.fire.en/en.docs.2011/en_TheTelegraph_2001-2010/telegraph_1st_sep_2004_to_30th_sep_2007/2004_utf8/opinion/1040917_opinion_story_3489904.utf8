 MIND YOUR BUSINESS

 Ashok Ganguly

 A couple of months ago, the annual NATO summit was held in Turkey. As usual there were bilateral meetings on the sidelines. One of these was President George W. Bush?s meeting with the Turkish prime minister, Tayyip Erdogan, after which Bush described Turkey as a shining example of democracy thriving in an Islamic state. The compliment to modern Turkey, founded by Kemal Ataturk, was well deserved but not surprising. Bush then urged the heads of states of the European Union to set a definite date to fulfil Turkey?s long-pending demand of joining the EU. 

 This remark brought an immediate rejoinder from the France president, Jacques Chirac, who said it was not for the United States of America to advise the EU on its domestic matters. Chirac went on to comment that the US might not appreciate it if the EU were to publicly advise it on how to conduct its relationship with Mexico. The NATO summit was meant to be a meeting of reconciliation between the EU and the US following the Iraq war fall-out between France, Germany and the US. The topic of Turkey?s entry into the EU scuppered that opportunity, leaving red faces all around.

 Religious divide

 Britain and Italy have been actively pushing Turkey?s candidature, while France and Germany favour delaying it indefinitely. For the EU, the Turkish dilemma is a long-standing one as Turkey would be the first Islamic member of what is essentially a Christian club. The reference to god in the European draft constitution is itself a contentious and, as yet unresolved, issue. So where does an Islamic state fit into the scheme of things?

 But the moot point of the whole unseemly debate over Turkey boils down to one nation?s undue interference in the affairs of another. That the Americans and some Europeans voiced open disagreement over such a sensitive issue is a reminder of similar interferences in other parts of the world.

 Which reminds me of a recent visit of a delegation of the European parliament to Jammu and Kashmir. They not only met various political factions to discuss affairs in Jammu and Kashmir but, at the end of their visit, the newspapers reported the delegation?s observations on Jammu and Kashmir, which is entirely India?s internal affair. Now what gave the right to the EU to make observations on India?s domestic matter is not at all clear.

 Double standards

 Is it a right they have assumed, based on any EU concessions on aid and trade? Should India not have reacted the same way as Chirac did to Bush?s advice on Turkey?s entry into the EU? One could make similar observations following the recent visit of Riaz Khokhar and his meetings with the Hurriyat groups in Kashmir. What was his locus standi in undertaking this initiative?

 The EU and USA are active in sending observers, particularly during elections, to Africa and Asia. This is supposed to be a mechanism to monitor elections and promote democracy in these countries. One does not hear of such observer groups being sent to, say, Hong Kong or to the west Asian regions. China, of course, is a different matter as it does not hold elections.

 Bush may have overstepped the line with his advice to the EU regarding Turkey?s membership. Chirac?s rejoinder reflects normal national sensitivities. It is to be hoped that the Europeans remember the episode in Turkey when they plan to send observers or delegations to other sovereign nations. Regrettably, the event in Istanbul may not have advanced Turkey?s case to join the EU, but it was another reminder of the divide that still remains between the West and the East. What better place for the drama to be played out than on the shores of the Bosphorus?

 Letters to Editor

 One hand in the pocket

 Sir ? When god closes all doors he opens a window, they say. That logic can be extended to our government?s current austerity drive (?Austerity axe falls on cars to cash cows?, Sept 29). The government?s 20-point list to save Rs 2,000 crore a year is impressive. But what is bewildering is how it has enfolded profit-making PSUs in its cost-cutting exercise by ordering them to declare a minimum dividend of 20 per cent on equity or a dividend payout of the same amount on net profit. Such a move, and the government?s justification that this will tighten its control over these companies, does not make sense since it is the major shareholder in these PSUs. It would have been more credible had the focus been only on slashing expenditure bills. That the Centre is ensuring an easy source of income for itself simultaneously raises doubts about the credibility of such ?austerity?. 

 Yours faithfully,

Ashish Mazumdar, Calcutta

 Triangle of love

 Sir ? The Gudiya-Taufiq-Arif episode makes it difficult to believe that we live in a civilized society (?Gudiya goes back to Arif, with child?, Sept 23). It is ironical that Gudiya was sent back to her first husband even though her present circumstances did not warrant such a decision. It is also ironical that the decision was taken by the wiseacres of the very society that the three characters in this story belong to. The decision makes a mockery of the larger society we inhabit ? whose values we are brought up in and always reminded of. It also mocks a woman?s dignity and self-respect. She is caught in the crossfire, and is handled like a commodity. And, what about Arif?s sense of morality? 

 Arif lived with Gudiya for only seven days, while Taufiq lived with her for more than a year and a half. Gudiya had given up the past ? which seemed hopeless ? to try and build a new future. And her love for Taufiq was all too obvious. It would have been better had Gudiya stood by what her heart really wanted. Besides, has the National Commission for Women been sleeping all this while?

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? Arif, who had been captured by the Pakistani army and imprisoned for five years, has received his fair share of sympathy. But what became of Gudiya in the m?l?e that followed his return? Muslim scholars have been heard arguing about what should have been done. But are not such discussions a little irrelevant now? 

 The manner in which the whole incident took shape raises questions about the state of development we are in. It is appalling to see that no one spared a thought for the very pregnant Gudiya, or the relationship that had developed between her and Taufiq who has now been left in the lurch so thoughtlessly.

 Yours faithfully,

Sumant Poddar, Calcutta 

 Sir ? It is strange that Arif has shown scant respect for Gudiya?s feelings. In claiming his wife, he had initially even refused to accept the child conceived out of her second marriage despite knowing all along that Gudiya was forced by her stepmother into marrying again. The Mundali panchayat has been inconsiderate in shoving its decision down Gudiya?s throat. Should it not be the woman who decides whom she wants to live with?

 Gudiya, instead of obeying what the village elders decided, should have consulted women?s organizations and put her foot down against such unreasonableness. When will Indian women learn to speak up for their rights? 

 Yours faithfully, 

Deepti Berry, Calcutta

 Sir ? Mohammad Arif, Gudiya?s first husband, has set a very bad precedent. Arif was initially given up for a deserter. So when Taufiq married her, it was for anything but the lure of money. It was more out of genuine love and concern for the well-being of the girl. It is unfortunate that this unsung hero, who wanted to do his bit for the social rehabilitation of Gudiya, has to now pay through his nose for his consideration by bearing all the expenses of the unborn child. 

 Does not Gudiya?s deserting Taufiq in this manner breach Islamic laws? It may well be that this incident will encourage more such breach of laws. In the bid to lionize and please a war hero, several wrongs have been committed. The sooner the community leaders realize this, the better.

 Yours faithfully, 

Tapan Pal, Batanagar

 Sir ? It was sad to see Gudiya?s options being closed by the so-called sentinels of society. How easily decisions were taken and changed ? first goading Gudiya to get married to Taufiq and then forcing her to return to her first husband, Arif. But then, why was the man wronged who made her his wife, with due respect and honour? 

 In contrast, Gulabo did what Gudiya could not (?As women come into their own?, Sept 22). She reinforced her will and defied the social norms because they did not suit her. This young girl from Haryana asserted her individuality, and believed that demanding her rights was not wrong. She represents a new class of women who have shown the way to many. They are their own masters. Women are surely coming of age. 

 Yours faithfully, 

Somashree Bhattacharya, Dhanbad

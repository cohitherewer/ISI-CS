 Letters to Editor

 Foe turns friend

 Sir ? The sangh parivar has been blessed with a fertile imagination. So the Shiv Sena had no difficulty in comparing itself with Christ and the opposition with ?scheming Romans? (?Passion on streets in run-up to polls?, Oct 7). Garnering votes in the name of religion is an old trick. But what makes this one special is that the sainiks are now wooing Christians, who, till recently, were their ?enemy number two? ? remember Graham Staines?s murder by saffron goons? But what if the Maharashtra voters see through this familiar strategy and turn their backs on the Sena?

 Yours faithfully,

Anand Mukherjee, Calcutta 

 Reign of terror

 Sir ?The recent bomb blasts in Nagaland and Assam show that the North-east continues to be a disturbed area (?Terror bursts, blood gushes? Oct 3). These attacks prove that the presence of the army is a necessity, despite calls for its withdrawal.

 The strikes are the result of the growing gulf between the local people and the Centre. The government needs to get rid of its lackadaisical attitude and bridge this divide by undertaking the following steps ? restoring the people?s confidence in the administration, implementing policies for the betterment of the common people and redressing their grievances. These measures would help in erasing the suspicion that lurks in the minds of the populace. However, they can only be put in place with the help of an effective policy based on ground realities.

 Yours faithfully,

Arvind K. Pandey, Allahabad 

 Sir ? The situation in the North-east is going from bad to worse. After Manipur, it is now the turn of Assam and Nagaland to experience disturbances. After the crackdown on the terrorists of United Liberation Front of Asom, it was being assumed that the threat of militancy had reduced. But latest attacks prove that the militants have regrouped and are still capable of conducting deadly strikes that kill innocent civilians to attract global attention and terrorize the people. 

 One suspects that the strikes were organized by terrorists operating from Bangladesh, which has become a safe haven for insurgents. If Bangladesh fails to stop the export of terror to India, our country reserves the right to launch a premptive strike to destroy the militant camps situated in that country.

 Yours faithfully,

Tapan Das Gupta, Calcutta

 Sir ? A week before the bomb blasts in Nagaland and Assam, we had the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isak-Muivah) ordering the closure of schools in Nagaland. This shows that the militants care little about the welfare of the Nagas. The NSCN (I-M) is fighting for a separate country. But even before their dream comes true, the militants have started harassing ordinary people by denying them their right to education.

 Not only that, the militants are also indifferent to the real needs of the people. For example, Nagaland is afflicted by a shortage of drinking water. Instead of indulging in violence, it would have been better if the ultras did something about this first. Killing people and raising patriotic slogans would not bring any solace to the Nagas who do without many basic amenities. The closing of schools has shattered their hopes for a brighter future. 

 Yours faithfully,

J.S. Kulathunkal, Jorhat

 Sir ? The state governments of Nagaland and Assam should take a cue from Andhra Pradesh and Orissa which have suspended anti-terrorist operations and invited the insurgents for talks. Without such peaceful overtures, violence would continue unabated in these states. 

 Yours faithfully,

R. Sekar, Angul

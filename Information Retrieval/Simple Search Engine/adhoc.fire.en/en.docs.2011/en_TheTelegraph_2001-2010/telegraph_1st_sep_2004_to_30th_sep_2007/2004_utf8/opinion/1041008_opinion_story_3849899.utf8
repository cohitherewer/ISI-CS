 SPEAKING IS DISSENT

AGAINST HISTORY, AGAINST STATE: COUNTERPERSPECTIVE 

FROM THE MARGINS 

By Shail Mayaram, Permanent Black, Rs 695

The Meos are pastoral peasant Muslims who have lived 

in the region called Mewat for at least the last seven centuries. They form one 

of the largest Muslim communities in India and owing to the proximity of Mewat 

(meaning ?the land of Meos?) to Delhi, they have had to constantly withstand political 

upheavals. 

 The Meos have been witness to several state formations ? from the sultanate to the Mughal and British, and later, to those of the Jaipur and Alwar kingdoms ? without being integrated into any one of them. They preserved their autonomy from the overpowering state mechanisms which sought to legitimize themselves ideologically through the formal discourses of history ? be it colonial or Indo-Persian.

 Against History: Against State is primarily an ethnographic case-study of the Meos which has been incorporated into a larger project which pertains to a study of the biases in Indo-Persian historiography and British ethnography. Shail Mayaram analyses the Meoite ?oral tradition?, transmitted through ballads and folk epics, to bring to the fore the community?s resistance to state dominance and cultural hegemony. In the process, she also challenges the traditional notion which privileges writing over speech, and history over myth, as historical proof. 

 Mayaram?s discovery of a subaltern voice coincides with her exposition of the ?logocentrism? of post-Enlightenment Western thought. She extends Ricoeur?s definition of a text as one ?having a referential dimension? to the Meos? oral ?texts? which she prefers to view not as ?paraliteratures? but as ?mytho-historical? narratives.

 The ten chapters of the book, which scrutinize the historical construction of Meo criminality, the power distribution within the Meo polity and the versified sagas of Meo bandit-heros, among other issues, efficiently project ?history from below?. Mayaram?s approach is uncompromising without being radical. 

 It is heartening to note that Mayaram recognizes ?radicalism? as dangerously close to ?reductionism? even as she dismisses Ashis Nandy?s contention that the ?historical consciousness? is a purely Western import. The same outlook comes through in her guarding against the ?romanticization? of Meo resistance. This she accepts is ?the community?s partial reconciliation with the reality of state formation? and also ?the internalization of the form and content of written texts? by the Meo oral tradition.

 Pawar and the glory

 - Pawar commands 19 of 31 votes for BCCI post: Dungarpur

Sharad Pawar, some say, is a man with a vision. Others 

think not. But everyone agrees that in plotting out an election strategy ? both 

in Maharashtra and the BCCI ? the man is indefatigable. Bishakha De Sarkar

As symbols go, Sharad Pawar?s party emblem ? a clock ? is particularly eloquent, for it can be read the way one would wish to. Supporters of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief would see it as a portent of a time to come; his critics, on the other hand, would focus on its two still hands. 

 Last April, when Pawar was wheeled into a Mumbai hospital for surgery on a mouth ulcer, time, once again, was at the centre of a debate that enveloped him. Most believed that it was time to write him off. And a section ? led by Pawar himself ? held that he had to battle time. 

 But earlier this week, when Sharadchandra Govindrao Pawar hit the headlines, it became clear that the Maratha strongman was in no hurry to hang up his watch. This, clearly, is Pawar?s week ? he has managed to wrest a fair share of seats from his coalition partner, the Congress. To top it, opinion polls ? though no longer considered a very credible barometer of success ? indicate that the NCP-Congress combine may well retain power in Maharashtra. And if that isn?t enough, the indomitable Pawar is looking beyond the electoral platform and into the world of cricket.

 Though it is not yet official, Pawar has made it clear that he will contest for the presidency of the powerful Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) in the elections scheduled on September 29. Though there is no direct link with the state Assembly elections, which follow on October 13, a victory in BCCI is going to be a bonus for Pawar in the polls. ?It can always add to his glory,? says party general secretary D.P. Tripathi.

 Pawar, many believe, has already got the BCCI election all stitched up. With politicians controlling a number of cricketing associations, the battle may well turn into a cakewalk for him. Support is already coming in from different quarters. Railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav, who controls the railway vote, says he will back Pawar. Cricket administrator Raj Singh Dungarpur lauds his ?unquestionable leadership qualities?. Adds selector Chandu Borde: ?Pawar is a man with a vision. Cricket would benefit immensely by Pawar at the helm of BCCI.?

 There is another school of thought on that, but the issue on which everybody is unanimous is that Pawar is indefatigable. The 63-year-old agriculture minister is holding negotiations with political partners, lobbying hard with heads of cricket associations and planning out an intricate electoral strategy ? both in Maharashtra and the BCCI. ?I think he is working with a renewed vigour,? says Tripathi. The Delhi-based party spokesperson points out that Pawar?s speeches are getting longer ? an indication that the minister is pumping adrenalin.

 In April, when Pawar was in hospital, many had thought that the NCP star campaigner would not be around for the gruelling Lok Sabha poll that came days after his surgery. But Pawar not only led the NCP all the way, he bagged the key agriculture portfolio ? an important ministry given the rural belt he represents ? in the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA).

 The relatively smooth relationship between the Congress and the NCP, many stress, indicates that Pawar?s rocky differences with the Congress and its chief, Sonia Gandhi, have temporarily been buried. NCP leader Tariq Anwar points out that in the NCP-Congress negotiations, there was a generous element of give-and-take. NCP leaders, for instance, were at one point of time convinced that the Congress would not yield more than 115 seats to the NCP, and were pleasantly surprised when it agreed to 128 ? not much lower than the 130 to 135 the NCP had demanded.

 Sonia Gandhi had apparently asked the Congress scrutiny committee headed by A.K. Anthony not to take any decision that would hurt Pawar because he was a willing electoral partner. Pawar, in turn, has told his party that if the alliance retained power, the NCP would not make a clamour for the chief minister?s post, which would go to the Congress. ?The message has gone down to the cadre that we are not interested in the top post,? says Anwar.

 Pawar, who has been a staunch critic of Gandhi?s foreign origins, has shown a mellowed streak in recent weeks. ?In politics, you can have differences, but you require extraordinary understanding and maturity to understand the person airing those differences. Like Indiraji and Rajivji, it is present in Soniaji as well,? Pawar told a leading Marathi daily on Wednesday.

 In 1999, when the Baramati baron unceremoniously quit the Congress, few believed that a rapprochement would ever be possible. These days, even though Anwar laughs it off as mere speculation, senior leaders in the Congress are actually talking about the NCP merging with the party. ?But Sharad Pawar would want that to happen from a position of strength,? says a minister in the central UPA government.

 And strength, clearly, is going to be one of the offshoots of the BCCI election. Just as strength is the reason why he is there in the first place. It was Pawar?s political strength that prompted a senior member of the cricketing hierarchy to urge him at a meeting in Delhi last week to fight for the BCCI president?s post, in an effort aimed at marginalising the all-powerful Jagmohan Dalmiya.

 Pawar?s candidature got wide support because everybody wants a strong man as the president at a time when Jagmohan Dalmiya is the chief patron of the cricket board,? says the high-ranking official who persuaded Pawar. ?Someone like Bansi Lal?s son, Ranbir Singh, would be far too submissive and it would mean Dalmiya would virtually be the chief patron and the de facto president of the BCCI,? he says.

 So now that the dual race has been flagged off, Pawar is out on the field. The electoral campaign will begin after September 27, once the Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations and the run-up to the BCCI election are over and done with. He will start his campaign and address a series of meetings with Sonia Gandhi in Solapur, Aurangabad, Nagpur and Mumbai. Pawar will also tour Baramati once at the beginning and then on the last day of the campaign.

 Baramati ? the constituency that he first won in 1967 and one that has never let Pawar down ? is the least of his worries, though. There is little that his constituents need to grumble about. His pocket borough gets its water from the Ujini Dam and electricity from Koyna. There is a thriving milk cooperative, industry, sugar mills, vineyards, and even a wine-processing plant. And there are numerous schools and colleges.

 ?Baramati is a great experiment,? says Tripathi. ?And its development has nothing to do with state largess. Baramati has been developed by arousing the initiative of the people,? he says.

 Pawar won the seat from Baramati in the last Lok Sabha election with the highest victory margin ? 4.22 lakh ? in the country. And Pawar returned the compliment by opting for a ministry that he felt could help him redress the problem of drought and scarcity in Maharashtra, an issue that the Opposition combine, the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Shiv Sena, has been chasing in the run-up to the Assembly elections. It also allowed him to consolidate his stronghold over the sugar belt in western Maharashtra, controlled by his support base, the cash-rich Maratha lobby.

 The portfolio is important not just because 60 per cent of Maharashtra?s population is in the rural areas, but because over 100 co-operative sugar factories in the state have been on the verge of closure, a situation that sugar factories in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh have been facing as well.

 ?As the agricultural minister, Pawar offered the people relief of up to Rs 1800 crore and slashed the interest rates on loans from 16 to nine per cent,? says NCP spokesperson Vasant Chavan. ?He also allowed sugar co-operatives to import sugar, polish it and sell it in the world markets,? he says. The state had been given a mere Rs 50 crore and food grains worth Rs 100 crore when the National Democratic Alliance government ruled at the Centre.

 But while Maharashtra is Pawar?s backyard, the minister, clearly, has other things on his mind. The state CM?s post is no longer something that he aspires for, since he first ruled the state when he was 38 ? a feat he accomplished by toppling the Congress government of Vasantdada Patil in 1978, splitting the party and forming a government in coalition with the Janata Party.

 Some months ago, there would have been the usual speculation about Pawar making a bid for the Prime Minister?s post. Now, it seems that Pawar is more pragmatic about the future. A few days ago, he candidly admitted in a television interview that he would not be PM, because he was the leader of a small party.

 So, it would appear that for the son-in-law of former Indian leg spinner Sadashivrao Shinde, a key player in Nawab Pataudi?s 1946 cricket team, the world, right now, is a cricket ball. 

 For the last three years, Pawar has been the president of the Mumbai Cricket Association and has won the support of its cricket world. Borde points out that Pawar has enormous administrative skills and a great ability to generate resources. ?He has already managed to get a 13-acre plot to build a new stadium at Bandra-Kurla complex,? says Borde.

 If Mumbai?s cricketing board is to be believed, the election is a foregone conclusion. Cricket administrator Dungarpur does a quick round of sums to state that Pawar has the support of at least 19 of the 31 votes that elect the BCCI chief. He holds that Pawar would get all six votes from the west zone and two from MP and Vidarbha associations. From the north zone, he would get votes from Punjab, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu amp; Kashmir. Three votes would come from the central government controlled Railways, Services and Universities. And Dungarpur says that Pawar would also get one vote from Tamil Nadu Cricket Association, two from Andhra Pradesh and one from Assam.

 ?My experience shows that when you have 20, you end up getting 24,? says Dungarpur.

 But despite the optimism in the western sector, the September 29 election outcome is still anybody?s bet, for the hold that Pawar?s target ? the equally determined Jagmohan Dalmiya ? has over the BCCI is legendary.

 The week promises to be a busy one for Pawar. There is the BCCI election on Wednesday, and a day later, Pawar will address joint rallies with Sonia Gandhi to flag off a new chapter in his political life. It?s going to be a new day for Pawar ? whichever way the ball turns.

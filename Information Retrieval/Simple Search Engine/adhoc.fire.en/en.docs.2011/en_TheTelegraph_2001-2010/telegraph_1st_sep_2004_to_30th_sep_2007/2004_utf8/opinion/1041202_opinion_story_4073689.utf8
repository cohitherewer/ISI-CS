 ON THE BEAT 

 Violence is an intoxicating habit. There is no better exemplar of this than the police in West Bengal. Last week, a police sergeant was suspended for physically assaulting a constable. The latter was on duty checking cars for security purposes. Since the car in which the sergeant was travelling was being driven recklessly, the men on duty stopped it and asked the driver for his papers. The sergeant erupted in abuse, punches and kicks, an assault that was spiced up by hitting one of the constables in the face with the butt of a revolver. The sergeant has been suspended, but it would be reasonable to ask whether the same action would have been taken, and taken so quickly, had the victim not been a policeman himself. 

 The answer should be looked for in another incident last Tuesday. The state chairman of the Left Front, Mr Biman Bose, was travelling to Calcutta, when his convoy was held up at the railway crossing near Kamarkundu on the Howrah-Burdwan line. The flashing red light of his car impressed the gate-keeping personnel into raising the bar for a while since the train was still far off. That in itself is astonishing ? even the rules of safety can be bent if the personage is considered important. Inevitably, this little bit of indiscipline led to some more, and other cars tried to squeeze past as well. A car coming from the opposite direction came too close to the VIP?s convoy in the confusion. The policemen on duty in the convoy could not let this piece of impertinence pass. They chased the car and broke the windshield and rear window with lathis. Then they pulled the driver out by his hair and beat him up so hard so that he had to be taken bleeding to hospital. It would be interesting to know if the leader of the party of the people objected to the conduct of his security staff, whether someone will be held responsible and penalized, and who would be paying for damage to the car, for the driver?s hospitalization, trauma and wasted time. It is now normal in West Bengal to feel relieved if an ordinary citizen escapes with minimum damage after an experience of the heady combination of self-importance, arrogance and violence that has become the hallmark of political leaders and the police. And when they are together, the outcome can be shattering. The common man?s dignity is not even an issue. The culture of violence has been carefully nurtured; it is a difficult lesson to unlearn.

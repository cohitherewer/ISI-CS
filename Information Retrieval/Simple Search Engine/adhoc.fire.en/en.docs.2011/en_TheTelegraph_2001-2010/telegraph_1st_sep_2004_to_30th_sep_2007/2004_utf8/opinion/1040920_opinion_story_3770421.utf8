 HURDLES IN THE WAY

 NARESH KUMAR

 After the hockey debacle in the Olympics, K.P.S. Gill, president of the Indian Hockey Federation, said, in a television interview, that we needed to look again at the whole structure. At the end of the programme the interviewer quipped, ?I hope they will start at the top!? 

 Both are absolutely spot on. Everyone knows of the various shortcomings of Indian sports. In brief ? the lack of modern facilities, top-level coaches, exposure to international competition and meaningful financial support, as also administrative shortcomings. It is the last, which is of serious concern. 

 The associations are autonomous and over the years have not been accountable to the government or the public for their dismal performance, as the Union sports minister recently acknowledged.

 Sports today is a tough business. Sporting success can change the image of a nation, and have a telling impact on commerce. The successful organization of the Olympic games helped Australia overcome an adverse balance of trade. Training and promotion costs can run into thousands of crores. China reportedly spent Rs 5,000 crore on the recent Olympic games in Athens. In contrast, India spent a frugal Rs 150-200 crore. With the economy booming and increasing government support, a lot of money will pour into Indian sports over the next few years. 

 Election strategy

 But do our sports associations have the professional infrastructure to handle large sums of money and deliver the goods? How can it be ensured that things are run properly and funds are not misused? 

 As far as I can see, the root of the problem lies in the constitution of the federations. Very often one reads of various amendments passed ?unanimously?. Voting rights are the key to the whole problem. National associations consist of affiliated state associations. Some state associations exist on paper and are propped up by minimal qualification requirements, which can be adjusted according to convenience in order to affiliate with the national body. The associations normally have equal voting rights and can tilt the balance in the election of office-bearers. 

 Perhaps, a fairer system would be to give weight according to the level of activity in the state. I remember about 50 years ago in the All India Tennis Association, voting strength was determined by the number of clubs affiliated to a state association. Every year before the elections, there was a rush to affiliate more clubs ? at times private lawns were tagged as clubs. The aspirants to power would pay the necessary affiliation fees. 

 Best practices

 After the election is won, the elected office-bearers are committed to look after those who helped in the victory, with the help of lavish hospitality, trips abroad, allocation of matches, appointments as manager of teams, and so on. 

 It is not possible to eliminate this, but I am sure the role of these floating votes can be made as minimal as possible. A model constitution may be drawn up for sports associations by a high-level retired official of the status of election commissioner, with the help of representatives of sports bodies and players, which the government should insist be adopted by national sports bodies. Statutory obligations of proper accounting and timely audit should be clearly laid down and enforced. Any change in the constitution should be cleared by the government. 

 Not that there are no good administrators in Indian sports. Jagmohan Dalmiya has shown immense dynamism, vision and financial acumen to change Indian cricket. There are murmurs about the opaque workings of the BCCI but these can be remedied. As patron-in-chief, he will enjoy an even more exalted status if he can choose a worthy successor, and hand over the reigns of power.

 A CHANGE FOR THE BETTER

 DOCUMENT

 Excerpts from the 10th conference of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, December 2004

 Defining goals

 Acknowledging that change in the Earth?s climate and its adverse effects are a common concern of humankind,

 Concerned that human activities have been substantially increasing the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases...and that this...may adversely affect natural ecosystems and humankind,

 Noting that the largest share of historical and current global emissions of greenhouse gases has originated in developed countries, that per capita emissions in developing countries are still relatively low and that the share of global emissions originating in developing countries will grow to meet their social and development needs,...

 Acknowledging that the global nature of climate change calls for the widest possible cooperation by all countries and their participation in an effective and appropriate international response,... 

 Recalling also that States have,...the sovereign right to exploit their own resources pursuant to their own environmental and developmental policies, and the responsibility to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other states or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction,...

 Recognizing that states should enact effective environmental legislation, that environmental standards, management objectives and priorities should reflect the environmental and developmental context to which they apply, and that standards applied by some countries may be inappropriate and of unwarranted economic and social cost to other countries, in particular developing countries,...

 Recognizing that steps required to understand and address climate change will be environmentally, socially and economically most effective if they are based on relevant scientific, technical and economic considerations...

 Recognizing also the need for developed countries to take immediate action in a flexible manner on the basis of clear priorities, as a first step towards comprehensive response strategies at the global, national and, where agreed, regional levels...

 Recognizing that all countries... need access to resources required to achieve sustainable social and economic development and that, in order for developing countries to progress towards that goal, their energy consumption will need to grow taking into account the possibilities for achieving greater energy efficiency and for controlling greenhouse gas emissions in general, including through the application of new technologies...

 Determined to protect the climate system for present and future generations,

 Have agreed as follows:

 Article 1: Definitions for the purposes of this Convention:

 1. ?Adverse effects of climate change? means changes in the physical environment or biota resulting from climate change which have significant deleterious effects on the composition, resilience or productivity of natural and managed ecosystems or on the operation of socio-economic systems or on human health and welfare.

 2. ?Climate change? means a change of climate which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable time periods.

 3. ?Climate system? means the totality of the atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere and geosphere and their interactions.

 4. ?Emissions? means the release of greenhouse gases and/or their precursors into the atmosphere over a specified area and period of time.

 5. ?Greenhouse gases? means those gaseous constituents of the atmosphere, both natural and anthropogenic, that absorb and re-emit infrared radiation.

 6. ?Regional economic integration organization? means an organization constituted by sovereign States of a given region which has competence in respect of matters governed by this Convention or its protocols and has been duly authorized, in accordance with its internal procedures, to sign, ratify, accept, approve or accede to the instruments concerned.

 7. ?Reservoir? means a component or components of the climate system where a greenhouse gas or a precursor of a greenhouse gas is stored.

 8. ?Sink? means any process, activity or mechanism which removes a greenhouse gas, an aerosol or a precursor of a greenhouse gas from the atmosphere.

 9. ?Source? means any process or activity which releases a greenhouse gas, an aerosol or a precursor of a greenhouse gas into the atmosphere.

 TO BE CONCLUDED

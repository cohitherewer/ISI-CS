 Letters to Editor

 Caught napping

 Sir ? What is it with men unwilling to let go of their precious hours of sleep? (?Baby bawls, Dad dozes?, Sept 10). British dads prefer to sleep it off rather than attend to wailing kids in the middle of the night. The French president, Jacques Chirac, did one better by taking a 1,200-mile detour en route to a conference, to catch up on his sleep. The price of Chirac?s antics can be calculated in terms of the fuel lost. But how does one measure the troubles of British moms, stuck between dozing husbands and crying babies?

 Yours faithfully,

Taniya Sen, Calcutta

 Old wounds

 Sir ? Laloo Prasad Yadav?s ordering of a new inquiry into the burning of the train at Godhra can be compared with his other antics ? gobbling delicacies in front of TV cameras while an ordinary Bihari went without two square meals and confiscating brand new vehicles from Patna showrooms to ferry guests during his daughter?s wedding. By reopening the Godhra files, Laloo Yadav aims at hitting two birds with one stone; he wants to throw a spanner in the works of the Nanavati commission and also distract the Muslim community?s attention from other pressing matters. Unfortunately, ordinary Hindus and Muslims will have to bear the brunt of the railways minister?s decision which is likely to fuel further unrest.

 Yours faithfully,

P. Kulkarni, Hyderabad

 Sir ? The fresh probe into the Godhra train carnage may reveal some facts that were swept under the carpet by the previous government led by the Bharatiya Janata Party. The howls of protest from the BJP, and the Gujarat government?s contention that the probe will ignite communal passions, do not hold much water. However,with assembly elections in two states around the corner, it is possible that the probe will be just another political gimmick, to appease the minority community. 

 Yours faithfully,

Shadab Ahsan, Gaya

 Sir ? Communal massacres with clear political overtones have taken place repeatedly in India. This shows that our netas have little or no concern for the victims of such violence.All that matters to them is political power, even if it comes at the expense of human lives. While Indian voters need to rise above the caste and communal divide while casting their votes, our politicians must also refrain from sowing the seeds of religious violence that only invite fearful retributions in these present dangerous times. 

 Yours faithfully,

Raghubir Singh, Pune

 Sir ? It is unfortunate that both the government and the opposition are trying their best to exploit the infamous Godhra tragedy for political reasons. The apex court, which has been keeping a close watch on Gujarat riot cases, should merge the Banerjee committee with the Nanavati commission to hasten the unravelling of the truth.

 Yours faithfully,

S.C. Agrawal, Dariba

 Sir ? The ordering of a high-level departmental inquiry into the Godhra incident proves that the Congress-led coalition government is trying to stoke an old fire. The UPA government should concentrate more on governance and less on political witch-hunts for the sake of the nation?s progress.

 Yours faithfully,

T.R. Anand, Calcutta

 Sir ? The truth about the carnage at Godhra cannot be unearthed by the Banerjee committee. An independent investigation by special intelligence agencies is the only way to reveal facts that still remain hidden from the public.

 Yours faithfully,

S.S. Almal, Calcutta
